Would not people be deprived of this flimsy pretext for staying at home if their homes could be towed up to the church door? Or, better yet, granting that the churches followed out the same plan, and were themselves constructed like canal-boats, how easy it would be for the sexton to drive the church around the town and collect the absentees. In the same manner it would be glorious for men like ourselves, who have to go to their daily toil. For a consideration, Mrs. Pedagog could have us driven to our various places of business every morning, returning for us in the evening. Think how fine it would be for me, for instance, instead of having to come home every night in an overcrowded elevated train or on a cable-car, to have the office-boy come and announce, 'Mrs. Pedagog's Select Home for Gentlemen is at the door, Mr. Idiot.' I could step right out of my office into my charming little bedroom up in the bow, and the time usually expended on the cars could be devoted to dressing for tea. Then we could stop in at the court-house for our legal friend; and as for Doctor Capsule, wouldn't he revel in driving this boarding-house about town on his daily rounds among his patients?\"  \"What would become of my office hours?\" asked the Doctor. \"If this house were whirling giddily all about the city from morning until night, I don't know what would become of my office patients.\"  \"They might die a little sooner or live a little longer, that is all,\" said the Idiot. \"If they weren't able to find the house at all, however, I think it would be better for us, for much as I admire you, Doctor, I think your office hours are a nuisance to the rest of us. I had to elbow my way out of the house this morning between a double line of sufferers from mumps and influenza, and other pleasingly afflicted patients of yours, and I didn't like it very much.\"  \"I don't believe they liked it much either,\" returned the Doctor. \"One man with a sprained ankle told me about you. You shoved him in passing.\"  \"Well, you can apologize to him in my behalf,\" returned the Idiot; \"but you might add that he must expect very much the same treatment whenever he and a boy with mumps stand between me and the door. Sprained ankles aren't contagious, and I preferred shoving him to the other alternative.\"  The Doctor was silent, and the Idiot rose to go. \"Where will the house be this evening about six-thirty, Mrs. Pedagog?\" he asked, as he pushed his chair back from the table.  \"Where? Why, here, of course,\" returned the landlady.  \"Why, yes--of course,\" observed the Idiot, with an impatient gesture. \"How foolish of me! I've really been so wrapped up in my canal-boat ideal that I came to believe that it might possibly be real and not a dream, after all. I almost believed that perhaps I should find that the house had been towed somewhere up into Westchester County on my return, so that we might all escape the city's tax on personal property, which I am told is unusually high this year.\"  With which sally the Idiot kissed his hand to Mr. Pedagog and retired from the scene.     II   \"Let's write a book,\" suggested the Idiot, as he took his place at the board and unfolded his napkin.  \"What about?\" asked the Doctor, with a smile at the idea of the Idiot's thinking of embarking on literary pursuits.  \"About four hundred pages long,\" said the Idiot. \"I feel inspired.\"  \"You are inspired,\" said the School-Master. \"In your way you are a genius. I really never heard of such a variegated Idiot as you are in all my experience, and that means a great deal, I can tell you, for in the course of my career as an instructor of youth I have encountered many idiots.\"  \"Were they idiots before or after having drank at the fount of your learning?\" asked the Idiot, placidly.  Mr. Pedagog glared, and the Idiot was apparently satisfied. To make Mr. Pedagog glare appeared to be one of the chiefest of his ambitions.  \"You will kindly remember, Mr. Idiot,\" said Mrs. Pedagog at this point, \"that Mr. Pedagog is my husband, and such insinuations at my table are distinctly out of place.\"  \"I ask your pardon, Mrs. Pedagog,\" rejoined the offender, meekly. \"Nevertheless, as apart from the question in hand as to whether Mr. Pedagog inspires idiocy or not, I should like to get the views of this gathering on the point you make regarding the table. _Is_ this your table? Is it not rather the table of those who sit about it to regale their inner man with the good things under which I remember once or twice in my life to have heard it groan? To my mind, the latter is the truth. It is _our_ table, because we buy it, and I am forced to believe that some of us pay for it. I am prepared to admit that if Mr. Brief, for instance, is delinquent in his weekly payments, his interest in the table reverts to you until he shall have liquidated, and he is not privileged to say a word that you do not approve of; but I, for instance, who since January 1st have been compelled to pay in advance, am at least sole lessee, and for the time being proprietor of the portion for which I have paid. You have sold it to me. I have entered into possession, and while in possession, as a matter of right and not on sufferance, haven't I the privilege of freedom of speech?\"  \"You certainly exercise the privilege whether you have it or not,\" snapped Mr. Pedagog.  \"Well, I believe in exercise,\" said the Idiot. \"Exercise brings strength, and if exercising the privilege is going to strengthen it, exercise it I shall, if I have to hire a gymnasium for the purpose. But to return to Mrs. Pedagog's remark. It brings up another question that has more or less interested me. Because Mrs. Smithers married Mr. Pedagog, do we lose all of our rights in Mr. Pedagog? Before the happy event that reduced our number from ten to nine--\"  \"We are still ten, are we not?\" asked Mr. Whitechoker, counting the guests.  \"Not if Mr. Pedagog and the late Mrs. Smithers have become one,\" said the Idiot. \"But, as I was saying, before the happy event that reduced our number from ten to nine we were permitted to address our friend Pedagog in any terms we saw fit, and whenever he became sufficiently interested to indulge in repartee we were privileged to return it. Have we relinquished that privilege? I don't remember to have done so.\"  \"It's a question worthy of your giant intellect,\" said Mr. Pedagog, scornfully. \"For myself, I do not at all object to anything you may choose to say to me or of me. Your assaults are to me as water is to a duck's back.\"  \"I am sorry,\" said the Idiot. \"I hate family disagreements, and here we have Mrs. Pedagog taking one side and Mr. Pedagog the other. But whatever decision may ultimately be reached, of one thing Mrs. Pedagog must be assured. I on principle side against Mr. Pedagog, and if it be the wish of my good landlady that I shall refrain from playing intellectual battledore and shuttlecock with her husband, whom we all revere, I certainly shall refrain. Hereafter if I indulge in anything that in any sense resembles repartee with our landlord, I wish it distinctly understood that an apology goes with it.\"  \"That's all right, my boy,\" said the School-Master. \"You mean well. You are a little new, that's all, and we all understand you.\"  \"I don't understand him,\" growled the Doctor, still smarting under the recollection of former breakfast-table discomfitures. \"I wish we could get him translated.\"  \"If you prescribed for me once or twice I think it likely I should be translated in short order,\" retorted the Idiot. \"I wonder how I'd go translated into French?\"  \"You couldn't be expressed in French,\" put in the Lawyer. \"It would take some barbarian tongue to do you justice.\"  \"Very well,\" said the Idiot. \"Proceed. Do me justice.\"  \"I can't begin to,\" said Mr. Brief, angrily.  \"That's what I thought,\" said the Idiot. \"That's the reason why you always do me such great injustice. You lawyers always have to be doing something, even if it is only holding down a chair so that it won't blow out of your office window. If you haven't any justice to mete out, you take another tack and dispense injustice with lavish hand. However, I'll forgive you if you'll tell me one thing. What's libel, Mr. Brief?\"  \"None of your business,\" growled the Lawyer.  \"A very good general definition,\" said the Idiot, approvingly. \"If there's any business in the world that I should hate to have known as mine it is that of libel. I think, however, your definition is not definite. What I wanted to know was just how far I could go with remarks at this table and be safe from prosecution.\"  \"Nobody would ever prosecute you, for two reasons,\" said the lawyer. \"In a civil action for money damages a verdict against you for ten cents wouldn't be worth a rap, because the chances are you couldn't pay. In a criminal action your conviction would be a bad thing, because you would be likely to prove a corrupting influence in any jail in creation. Besides, you'd be safe before a jury, anyhow. You are just the sort of idiot that the intelligent jurors of to-day admire, and they'd acquit you of any crime. A man has a right to a trial at the hands of a jury of his peers. I don't think even in a jury-box twelve idiots equal to yourself could be found, so don't worry.\"  \"Thanks. Have a cigarette?\" said the Idiot, tossing one over to the Lawyer. \"It's all I have. If I had a half-dollar I should pay you for your opinion; but since I haven't, I offer you my all. The temperature of my coffee seems to have fallen, Mrs. Pedagog. Will you kindly let me have another cup?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Pedagog. \"Mary, get the Idiot another cup.\"  Mary did as she was told, placing the empty bit of china at Mrs. Pedagog's side.  \"It is for the Idiot, Mary,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, coldly. \"Take it to him.\"  \"Empty, ma'am?\" asked the maid.  \"Certainly, Mary,\" said the Idiot, perceiving Mrs. Pedagog's point. \"I asked for another cup, not for more coffee.\"  [Illustration: \"CERTAINLY. I ASKED FOR"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18881"],["title","The Idiot (#2)"],["body","CUP\"]  Mrs. Pedagog smiled quietly at her own joke. At hair-splitting she could give the Idiot points.  \"I am surprised that Mary should have thought I wanted more coffee,\" continued the Idiot, in an aggrieved tone. \"It shows that she too thinks me out of my mind.\"  \"You are not out of your mind,\" said the Bibliomaniac. \"It would be a good thing if you were. In replenishing your mental supply you might have the luck to get better quality.\"  \"I probably should have the luck,\" said the Idiot. \"I have had a great store of it in my life. From the very start I have had luck. When I think that I was born myself, and not you, I feel as if I had had more than my share of good-fortune--more luck than the law allows. How much luck does the law allow, Mr. Brief?\"  \"Bosh!\" said Mr. Brief, with a scornful wave of his hand, as if he were ridding himself of a troublesome gnat. \"Don't bother me with such mind-withering questions.\"  \"All right,\" said the Idiot. \"I'll ask you an easier one. Why does not the world recognize matrimony?\"  Mr. Whitechoker started. Here, indeed, was a novel proposition.  \"I--I--must confess,\" said he, \"that of all the idiotic questions I--er--I have ever had the honor of hearing asked that takes the--\"  \"Cake?\" suggested the Idiot.  \"--palm!\" said Mr. Whitechoker, severely.  \"Well, perhaps so,\" said the Idiot. \"But matrimony is the science, or the art, or whatever you call it, of making two people one, is it not?\"  \"It certainly is,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"But what of it?\"  \"The world does not recognize the unity,\" said the Idiot. \"Take our good proprietors, for instance. They were made one by yourself, Mr. Whitechoker. I had the pleasure of being an usher at the ceremony, yielding the position of best man gracefully, as is my wont, to the Bibliomaniac. He was best man, but not the better man, by a simple process of reasoning. Now no one at this board disputes that Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog are one, but how about the world? Mr. Pedagog takes Mrs. Pedagog to a concert. Are they one there?\"  \"Why not?\" asked Mr. Brief.  \"That's what I want to know--why not? The world, as represented by the ticket-taker at the door, says they are not--or implies that they are not, by demanding tickets for two. They attempt to travel out to Niagara Falls. The railroad people charge them two fares; the hackman charges them two fares; the hotel bills are made out for two people. It is the same wherever they go in the world, and I regret to say that even in our own home there is a disposition to regard them as two. When I spoke of there being nine persons here instead of ten, Mr. Whitechoker himself disputed my point--and yet it was not so much his fault as the fault of Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog themselves. Mrs. Pedagog seems to cast doubt upon the unity by providing two separate chairs for the two halves that make up the charming entirety. Two cups are provided for their coffee. Two forks, two knives, two spoons, two portions of all the delicacies of the season which are lavished upon us out of season--generally after it--fall to their lot. They do not object to being called a happy _couple_, when they should be known as a happy single. Now what I want to know is why the world does not accept the shrinkage which has been pronounced valid by the church and is recognized by the individual? Can any one here tell me that?\"  [Illustration: \"DEMANDS TICKETS FOR TWO\"]  No one could, apparently. At least no one endeavored to. The Idiot looked inquiringly at all, and then, receiving no reply to his question, he rose from the table.  \"I think,\" he said, as he started to leave the room--\"I think we ought to write that book. If we made it up of the things you people don't know, it would be one of the greatest books of the century. At any rate, it would be great enough in bulk to fill the biggest library in America.\"     III   \"I wish I were beginning life all over again,\" said the Idiot one spring morning, as he took his accustomed place at Mrs. Pedagog's table.  \"I wish you were,\" said Mr. Pedagog from behind his newspaper. \"Then your parents would have you shut up in a nursery, and it is even conceivable that you would be receiving those disciplinary attentions with a slipper that you seem to me so frequently to deserve, were you at this present moment in the nursery stage of your development.\"  \"My!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"What a wonder you are, Mr. Pedagog! It is a good thing you are not a justice in a criminal court.\"  \"And what, may I venture to ask,\" said Mr. Pedagog, glancing at the Idiot over his spectacles--\"what has given rise to that extraordinary remark, the connection of which with anything that has been said or done this morning is distinctly not apparent?\"  \"I only meant that a man who was so given over to long sentences as you are would probably make too severe a judge in a criminal court,\" replied the Idiot, meekly. \"Do you make use of the same phraseology in the class-room that you dazzle us with, I should like to know?\"  \"And why not, pray?\" said Mr. Pedagog.  \"No special reason,\" said the Idiot; \"only it does seem to me that an instructor of youth ought to be more careful in his choice of adverbs than you appear to be. Of course Doctor Bolus here is under no obligation to speak more grammatically or correctly than he does. People call him in to prescribe, not to indulge in rhetorical periods, and he can write his prescriptions in a sort of intuitive Latin and nobody be the wiser, but you, who are said to be sowing the seeds of knowledge in the brain of youth, should be more careful.\"  \"Hear the grammarian talk!\" returned Mr. Pedagog. \"Listen to this embryonic Samuel Johnson the Second. What have I said that so offends the linguistic taste of Lindley Murray, Jun.?\"  \"Nothing,\" returned the Idiot. \"I cannot say that you have said anything. I never heard you say anything in my life; but while you can no doubt find good authority for making use of the words 'distinctly not apparent,' you ought not to throw such phrases around carelessly. The thing which is distinct is apparent, therefore to say 'distinctly not apparent' to a mind that is not given to analysis sounds strange. You might as well say of a beautiful girl that she is plainly pretty, meaning of course that she is evidently pretty; but those who are unacquainted with the idiomatic peculiarities of your speech might ask you if you meant that she was pretty in a plain sort of way. Suppose, too, you were writing a novel, and, in a desire to give your reader a fair idea of the personal appearance of a homely but good creature, you should say, 'It cannot be denied that Rosamond Follansbee was pretty plain?' It wouldn't take a very grave error of the types to change your entire meaning. To save a line on a page, for instance, it might become necessary to eliminate a single word; and if that word should chance to be the word 'plain' in the sentence I have given, your homely but good person would be set down as being undeniably pretty. Which shows, it seems to me, that too great care cannot be exercised in the making of selections from our vocabu--\"  \"You are the worst I _ever_ knew!\" snapped Mr. Pedagog.  \"Which only proves,\" observed the Idiot, \"that you have not heeded the Scriptural injunction that you should know thyself. Are those buckwheat cakes or doilies?\"  Whether the question was heard or not is not known. It certainly was not answered, and silence reigned for a few minutes. Finally Mrs. Pedagog spoke, and in the manner of one who was somewhat embarrassed. \"I am in an embarrassing position,\" said she.  \"Good!\" said the Idiot, _sotto-voce_, to the genial gentleman who occasionally imbibed. \"There is hope for the landlady yet. If she can be embarrassed she is still human--a condition I was beginning to think she wotted not of.\"  \"She whatted what?\" queried the genial gentleman, not quite catching the Idiot's words.  \"Never mind,\" returned the Idiot. \"Let's hear how she ever came to be embarrassed.\"  \"I have had an application for my first-floor suite, and I don't know whether I ought to accept it or not,\" said the landlady.  \"She has a conscience, too,\" whispered the Idiot; and then he added, aloud, \"And wherein lies the difficulty, Mrs. Pedagog?\"  \"The applicant is an actor; Junius Brutus Davenport is his name.\"  \"A tragedian or a comedian?\" asked the Bibliomaniac.  \"Or first walking gentleman, who knows every railroad tie in the country?\" put in the Idiot.  \"That I do not know,\" returned the landlady. \"His name sounds familiar enough, though. I thought perhaps some of you gentlemen might know of him.\"  \"I have heard of Junius Brutus,\" observed the Doctor, chuckling slightly at his own humor, \"and I've heard of Davenport, but Junius Brutus Davenport is a combination with which I am not familiar.\"  \"Well, I can't see why it should make any difference whether the man is a tragedian, or a comedian, or a familiar figure to railroad men,\" said Mr. Whitechoker, firmly. \"In any event, he would be an extremely objec--\"  \"It makes a great deal of difference,\" said the Idiot. \"I've met tragedians, and I've met comedians, and I've met New York Central stars, and I can assure you they each represent a distinct type. The tragedians, as a rule, are quiet meek individuals, with soft low voices, in private life. They are more timid than otherwise, though essentially amiable. I knew a tragedian once who, after killing seventeen Indians, a road-agent, and a gross of cowboys between eight and ten P.M. every night for sixteen weeks, working six nights a week, was afraid of a mild little soft-shell crab that lay defenceless on a plate before him on the evening of the seventh night of the last week. Tragedians make agreeable companions, I can tell you; and if J. Brutus Davenport is a tragedian, I think Mrs. Pedagog would do well to let him have the suite, provided, of course, that he pays for it in advance.\"  \"I was about to observe, when our friend interrupted me,\" said Mr."]]]
