J. Peters & Son, Boston                            To                  My Grand Nephew                RICHARD LABAN ADAMS                     This Book            Is Affectionately Dedicated     PREFACE   \"FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT\" is the fifth and last but one of \"The Blue and the Gray Series.\" The character of the operations in connection with the war of the Rebellion, and the incidents in which the interest of the young reader will be concentrated, are somewhat different from most of those detailed in the preceding volumes of the series, though they all have the same patriotic tendency, and are carried out with the same devotion to the welfare of the nation as those which deal almost solely in deeds of arms.  Although the soldiers and sailors of the army and navy of the Union won all the honors gained in the field of battle or on the decks of the national ships, and deserved all the laurels they gathered by their skill and bravery in the trying days when the republic was in peril, they were not the only actors in the greatest strife of the nineteenth century. Not all the labor of \"saving the Union\" was done in the trenches, on the march, on the gun deck of a man-of-war, or in other military and naval operations, though without these the efforts of all others would have been in vain. Thousands of men and women who never \"smelled gunpowder,\" who never heard the booming cannon, or the rattling musketry, who never witnessed a battle on sea or land, but who kept their minds and hearts in touch with the holy cause, labored diligently and faithfully to support and sustain the soldiers and sailors at the front.  If all those who fought no battles are not honored like the leaders and commanders in the loyal cause, if they wear no laurels on their brows, if no monuments are erected to transmit their memory to posterity, if their names and deeds are not recorded in the Valhalla of the redeemed nation, they ought not to be disregarded and ignored. It was not on the field of strife alone in the South that the battle was fought and won. The army and the navy needed a moral, as well as a material support, which was cheerfully rendered by the great army of the people who never buckled on a sword, or shouldered a musket. Their work can not be summed up in deeds, for there was little or nothing that was brilliant and dazzling in their career. They need no monuments; but their work was necessary to the final and glorious result of the most terrible war of modern times.  No apology is necessary for placing the hero of the story and his skilful associate in a position at a distance from the actual field of battle. They were working for the salvation of the Union as effectively as they could have done in the din of the strife. They were \"Fighting for the Right,\" as they understood it, though it is not treason to say, thirty years later, that the people of the South were as sincere as those of the North; and they could hardly have fought and suffered to the extent they did if it had been otherwise.  The incidents of the volume are more various than in the preceding stories, which were so largely a repetition of battle scenes; but the hero is still as earnest as ever in the cause he loves. He attains a high position without any ambition to win it; for, like millions of others who gave the best years of their lives to sustain the Union, who suffered the most terrible hardships and privations, so many hundreds of thousands giving their lives to their country, Christy fought and labored for the cause, and not from any personal ambition. It is the young man's high character, his devotion to duty, rather than the incidents and adventures in which he is engaged, that render him worthy of respect, and deserving of the honors that were bestowed upon him. The younger participants in the war of the Rebellion, Christy Passford among the number, are beginning to be grizzled with the snows of fifty winters; but they are still rejoicing in \"A Victorious Union.\"    William T.

In fact, I have been ready to return to my duty at any time within the last month,\" replied Christy very cheerfully. \"It would be a shame for me to loiter around home any longer, when I am as able to plank the deck as I ever was. In truth, I think I am better and stronger than ever before, for I have had a long rest.\"  \"Your vacation has been none too long, for you were considerably run down, the doctor said, in addition to your two wounds,\" added Captain Passford, senior; for the young man had held a command, and was entitled to the same honorary title as his father.  \"These doctors sometimes make you think you are sicker than you really are,\" said Christy with a laugh.  \"But your doctor did not do so, for your mother and I both thought you were rather run out by your labors in the Gulf.\"  \"If I was, I am all right now. Do I look like a sick one? I weigh more than I ever did before in my life.\"  \"Your mother has taken excellent care of you, and you certainly look larger and stronger than when you went to sea in the Bronx.\"  \"But I am very tired of this inactive life. I have been assigned to the Bellevite as second lieutenant, a position I prefer to a command, for the reasons I have several times given you, father.\"  \"I am certainly very glad to have you returned to the Bellevite, though the honors will be easier with you than they were when you were the commander of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18803"],["title","Fighting for the Right (#1)"],["body","Bronx.\"  \"But I shall escape the responsibility of the command, and avoid being pointed at as one who commands by official influence,\" said Christy, rather warmly; for he felt that he had done his duty with the utmost fidelity, and it was not pleasant to have his hard-earned honors discounted by flings at his father's influence with the government.  \"It is impossible to escape the sneers of the discontented, and there are always plenty of such in the navy and the army. But, Christy, you wrong yourself in taking any notice of such flings, for they have never been thrown directly at you, if at all. You are over-sensitive, and you have not correctly interpreted what your superiors have said to you,\" said Captain Passford seriously.  His father recalled some of the conversations between the young officer and Captain Blowitt and others, reported to him before. He insisted that the remarks of his superiors were highly complimentary to him, and that he had no right to take offence at them.  \"I dare say I am entirely wrong, father; but it will do me no harm to serve in a subordinate capacity,\" added Christy.  \"I agree with you here; but I must tell you again, as I have half a dozen times before, that I never asked a position or promotion for you at the Navy Department. You have won your honors and your advancement yourself,\" continued the father.  \"Well, it was all the same, father; you have used your time and your money very freely in the service of the government, as you could not help doing. I know that I did my duty, and the department promoted me because I was your son,\" said Christy, laughing.  \"Not at all, my son; you deserved your promotion every time, and if you had been the son of a wood-chopper in the State of Maine, you would have been promoted just the same,\" argued Captain Passford.  \"Perhaps I should,\" answered the young officer rather doubtfully.  \"After what you did in your last cruise with the Bronx, a larger and finer vessel would have been given to you in recognition of the brilliant service you had rendered,\" added the father. \"I prevented this from being done simply because you wished to take the position of second lieutenant on board of the Bellevite.\"  \"Then I thank you for it, father,\" replied Christy heartily.  \"But the department thinks it has lost an able commander,\" continued the captain with a smile.  \"I am willing to let the department think so, father. All I really ask of the officials now is to send me back to the Gulf, and to the Bellevite. I believe you said that I was to go as a passenger in the Chateaugay.\"  \"I did; and she has been ready for over a week.\"  \"Why don't she go, then?\" asked Christy impatiently.  \"On her way to the Gulf she is to engage in some special service,\" replied Captain Passford, as he took some letters from his pocket.  \"Letters!\" exclaimed the young lieutenant, laughing as he recalled some such missives on two former occasions. \"Do you still keep your three agents in the island of Great Britain?\"  \"I don't keep them, for they are now in the employ of the government, though they still report to me, and we use the system adopted some two years ago.\"  \"What is it this time, father?\" asked Christy, his curiosity as well as his patriotism excited by this time at the prospect of capturing a Confederate man-of-war, or even a blockade-runner.  \"There are traitors in and about the city of New York,\" answered Captain Passford, as he returned the letters to his pocket. \"We had a rebel in the house here at one time, you remember, and it is not quite prudent just now to explain the contents of the letters.\"  \"All right, father; but I suppose you will read them to me before I sail for the South.\"  \"I will talk to you about it another time,\" added the captain, as a knock was heard at the door. \"Come in!\"  It was the man-servant of the house, and he brought in a tray on which there was a card, which Captain Passford took.  \"Captain Wilford Chantor,\" the captain read from the card. \"Show him in, Gates. Lieutenant Chantor is appointed to the command of the Chateaugay, Christy, in which you take passage to the Gulf; but she will not go there directly.\"  \"Captain Chantor,\" said Gates, as he opened the door for the visitor.  \"I am happy to see you, Captain Chantor, though I have not had the pleasure of meeting you before,\" said the captain, as he rose from his chair, and bowed to the gentleman, who was in the uniform of a lieutenant.  \"I presume I have the honor to address Captain Horatio Passford,\" said the visitor, as he took a letter from his pocket, bowing very respectfully at the same time, and delivering the letter.  \"I am very glad to meet you, Captain Chantor,\" continued Captain Passford, taking the hand of the visitor. \"Allow me to introduce to you my son, Lieutenant Passford, who will be a passenger on your ship to the Gulf.\"  \"I am very happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Passford, for I need hardly say that I have heard a great deal about you before, and this is a very unexpected pleasure,\" replied Captain Chantor.  \"Thank you, Captain, and I am equally happy to meet you, as I am to be a passenger on your ship,\" added Christy, as they shook hands very cordially.  \"I had three other passengers on board, but they have been transferred to the store-ship, which sails to-day, and you will be my only passenger.\"  \"At my suggestion,\" said Captain Passford smiling, doubtless at the puzzled expression of the captain of the Chateaugay at his statement.  \"I am to attend to some special service on my voyage to the Gulf, and I am ordered to take my instructions from you,\" added Captain Chantor.  \"Precisely so; but I hold no official position, and your orders will be put in proper form before you sail,\" replied Christy's father. \"Now, if you will be patient for a little while, I will explain the nature of the special service.\"  \"I shall be very glad to understand the subject, and I am confident my patience will hold out to any extent you may require.\"  The conversation so far had taken place in the library. The owner of Bonnydale rose from his arm-chair, opened the door into the hall, and looked about him very cautiously. Then he closed a window which the unusual warmth of an April day had rendered it necessary to open. He conducted his companions to the part of the room farthest from the door, and seated them on a sofa, while he placed his arm-chair in front of them. Even Christy thought his father was taking extraordinary precautions, and the visitor could make nothing of it.  \"As I have had occasion to remark before to-day, there are traitors in and about New York,\" the captain began.  \"If you have any private business with Captain Chantor, father, I am perfectly willing to retire,\" suggested Christy.  \"No; I wish you to understand this special service, for you may be called upon to take a hand in it,\" replied Captain Passford; and the son seated himself again. \"There are traitors in and about New York, I repeat. I think we need not greatly wonder that some of the English people persist in attempting to run the blockade at the South, when some of our own citizens are indirectly concerned in the same occupation.\"  This seemed to the captain of the Chateaugay an astounding statement, and not less so to Christy, and neither of them could make anything of it; but they were silent, concluding that the special service related to this matter.  \"In what I am about to say to you, Captain Chantor, I understand that I am talking to an officer of the utmost discretion,\" continued Captain Passford, \"and not a word of it must be repeated to any person on board of the Chateaugay, and certainly not to any other person whatever.\"  \"I understand you perfectly, sir,\" replied the officer. \"My lips shall be sealed to all.\"  \"I wish to say that the command of the Chateaugay would have been offered to my son, but I objected for the reason that he prefers not to have a command at present,\" said the captain.  \"That makes it very fortunate for me.\"  \"Very true, though the change was not made for your sake. You were selected for this command as much on account of your discretion as for your skill and bravery as an officer.\"  \"I consider myself very highly complimented by the selection.\"  \"Now to the point: I have information that a fast steamer, intended to carry eight guns, called the Ovidio, sailed from the other side of the ocean some time since, and she is to be a vessel in the Confederate navy. Her first port will be Nassau, New Providence.\"  \"Does that prove that any Americans are traitors in and about New York, father?\" asked Christy.  \"She is to run the blockade with a cargo consisting in part of American goods.\"  Captain Passford took a file of papers from his pocket.     CHAPTER II  A COMPLICATED CASE   Captain Passford looked over his papers for a moment; but it was soon evident from his manner that he had secrets which he would not intrust even to his son, unless it was necessary to do so. He seemed to be armed with documentary evidence upon which to act, but he did not read any of his papers, and soon returned them to his pocket.  \"The American goods of which I speak are certain pieces of machinery to be used in the manufacture of arms,\" continued the captain. \"They cannot be obtained in England, and the traitors have decided to send them direct, rather than across the ocean in the first instance. These will form the principal and most important part of the cargo of a steamer now loaded, though she will carry other goods, such as the enemy need most at the present time.\"  \"I did not suppose any Americans were wicked enough to engage in such an enterprise for the sake of making money,\" said Christy indignantly.  \"The steamer of which you speak is already loaded, is she?\" asked Captain Chantor.  \"She is; and now I wish both of you to go with me, and I will point out the vessel to you, and you must mark her so well that you can identify her when occasion requires.\"  The trio left the house "]]]
