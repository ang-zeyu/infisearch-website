We have borne much silently. Can we not be a little patient now?\"  \"I _hate_ them!\" sobbed the girl, abandoning all caution. \"They drove him away and we will see him no more,--my brother--Armand!\"  \"Hush, my daughter,\" her mother pleaded. \"Listen! I heard a footstep. They are spying and have heard.\"  For a moment neither spoke and there was no sound but the girl's quick breaths as she tried to control herself. Then there was a slight rustling in the shrubbery and they waited in breathless suspense.  \"I knew it,\" whispered Madame; \"we are always watched. Now it has come.\"  Still they waited, fearfully. Another sound, and old Pierre rose, pushed his rustic chair from him and stood with a fine, soldierly air, waiting. His wife was trembling pitiably and Florette, her eyes wide with grief and terror, watched the dark bushes like a frightened animal.  Suddenly the leaves parted and they saw a strange disheveled figure. For a moment it paused, uncertain, then looked stealthily about and emerged into the open. The stranger was hatless and barefoot and his whole appearance was that of exhaustion and fright. When he spoke it was in a strange language and spasmodically as if he had been running hard.  \"Leteur?\" he asked, looking from one to the other; \"the name--Leteur? I can't speak French,\" he added, somewhat bewildered and clutching an upright of the arbor.  \"What do you wish here?\" old Pierre demanded in French, never relaxing his military air.  The stranger leaned wearily against the arbor, panting, and even in the dusk they could see that he was young and very ragged, and with the whiteness of fear and apprehension in his face and his staring eyes.  \"You German? French?\" he panted.  \"We are French,\" said Florette, rising. \"I can speak ze Anglaise a leetle.\"  \"You are not German?\" the visitor repeated as if relieved.  \"Only we are Zherman subjects, yess. Our name ees Leteur.\"  \"I am--American. My name--is Tom Slade. I escaped from the prison across there. My--my pal escaped with me----\"  The girl looked pityingly at him and shook her head while her parents listened curiously. \"We are sorry,\" she said, \"so sorry; but you were not wise to escape. We cannot shelter you. We are suspect already.\"  \"I have brought you news of Armand,\" said Tom. \"I can't--can't talk. We ran----Here, take this. He--he gave it to me--on the ship.\"  He handed Florette a little iron button, which she took with a trembling hand, watching him as he clutched the arbor post.  \"From Armand? You know heem?\" she asked, amazed. \"You are American?\"  \"He's American, too,\" said Tom, \"and he's with General Pershing in France. We're goin' to join him if you'll help us.\"  For a moment the girl stared straight at him, then turning to her father she poured out such a volley of French as would have staggered the grim authorities of poor Alsace. What she said the fugitive could not imagine, but presently old Pierre stepped forward and, throwing his one arm about the neck of the young American, kissed him several times with great fervor.  Tom Slade was not used to being kissed by anybody and he was greatly abashed. However, it might have been worse. What would he ever have done if the girl who spoke English in such a hesitating, pretty way had taken it into _her_ head to kiss him?     CHAPTER III  TOM'S STORY   \"You needn't be afraid,\" said Tom; \"we didn't leave any tracks; we came across the fields--all the way from the crossroads down there. We crawled along the fence. There ain't any tracks. I looked out for that.\"  Pausing in suspense, yet encouraged by their expectant silence, he spoke to some one behind him in the bushes and there emerged a young fellow quite as ragged as himself.  \"It's all right,\" said Tom confidently, and apparently in great relief. \"It's them.\"  \"You must come inside ze house,\" whispered Florette fearfully. \"It is not safe to talk here.\"  \"There isn't any one following us,\" said Tom's companion reassuringly. \"If we can just get some old clothes and some grub we'll be all right.\"  \"Zere is much danger,\" said the girl, unconvinced. \"We are always watched. But you are friends to Armand. We must help you.\"  She led the way into the house and into a simply furnished room lighted by a single lamp and as she cautiously shut the heavy wooden blinds and lowered the light, the two fugitives looked eagerly at the first signs of home life which they had seen in many a long day.  It was in vain that the two Americans declined the wine which old Pierre insisted upon their drinking.  \"You will drink zhust a leetle--yess?\" said the girl prettily. \"It is make in our own veenyard.\"  So the boys sipped a little of the wine and found it grateful to their weary bodies and overwrought nerves.  \"Now you can tell us--of Armand,\" she said eagerly.  Often during Tom's simple story she stole to the window and, opening the blind slightly, looked fearfully along the dark, quiet road. The very atmosphere of the room seemed charged with nervous apprehension and every sound of the breeze without startled the tense nerves of the little party.  Old Pierre and his wife, though quite unable to understand, listened keenly to every word uttered by the strangers, interrupting their daughter continually to make her translate this or that sentence.  \"There ain't so much need to worry,\" said Tom, with a kind of dogged self-confidence that relieved Florette not a little. \"I wouldn't of headed for here if I hadn't known I could do it without leaving any trace, 'cause I wouldn't want to get you into trouble.\"  Florette looked intently at the square, dull face before her with its big mouth and its suggestion of a frown. His shock of hair, always rebellious, was now in utter disorder. He was barefoot and his clothes were in that condition which only the neglect and squalor of a German prison camp can produce. But in his gaunt face there shone a look of determination and a something which seemed to encourage the girl to believe in him.  \"Are zey all like you--ze Americans?\" she asked.  \"Some of 'em are taller than me,\" he answered literally, \"but I got a good chest expansion. This feller's name is Archer. He belongs on a farm in New York.\"  She glanced at Archer and saw a round, red, merry face, still wearing that happy-go-lucky look which there is no mistaking. His skin was camouflaged by a generous coat of tan and those two strategic hills, his cheeks, had not been reduced by the assaults of hunger. There was, moreover, a look of mischief in his eyes, bespeaking a jaunty acceptance of whatever peril and adventure might befall and when he spoke he rolled his R's and screwed up his mouth accordingly.  \"Maybe you've heard of the Catskills,\" said Tom. \"That's where _he_ lives.\"  \"My dad's got a big apple orrcharrd therre,\" added Archer.  Florette Leteur had not heard of the Catskills, but she had heard a good deal about the Americans lately and she looked from one to the other of this hapless pair, who seemed almost to have dropped from the clouds.  \"You have been not wise to escape,\" she said sympathetically. \"Ze Prussians, zey are sure to catch you.--Tell me more of my bruzzer.\"  \"The Prussians ain't so smarrt,\" said Archer. \"They're good at some things, but when it comes to tracking and trailing and all that, they're no good. You neverr hearrd of any famous Gerrman scouts. They're clumsy. They couldn't stalk a mud turrtle.\"  \"You are not afraid of zem?\"  \"Surre, we ain't. Didn't we just put one overr on 'em?\"  \"We looped our trail,\" explained Tom to the puzzled girl. \"If they're after us at all they probably went north on a blind trail. We monkeyed the trees all the way through this woods near here.\"  \"He means we didn't touch the ground,\" explained Archer.  \"We made seven footprints getting across the road to the fence and then we washed 'em away by chucking sticks. And, anyway, we crossed the road backwards so they'd think we were going the other way. There ain't much danger--not tonight, anyway.\"  Again the girl looked from one to the other and then explained to her father as best she could.  \"You are wonderful,\" she said simply. \"We shall win ze war now.\"  \"I was working as a mess boy on a transport,\" said Tom; \"we brought over about five thousand soldiers. That's how I got acquainted with Frenchy--I mean Armand----\"  \"Yes!\" she cried, and at the mention of Armand old Pierre could scarcely keep his seat.  \"He came with some soldiers from Illinois. That's out west. He was good-natured and all the soldiers jollied him. But he always said he didn't mind that because they were all going to fight together to get Alsace back. Jollying means making fun of somebody--kind of,\" Tom added.  \"Oh, zat iss what he say?\" Florette cried. \"Zat iss my brother--Armand--yess!\"  She explained to her parents and then advanced upon Tom, who retreated to his second line of defence behind a chair to save himself from the awful peril of a grateful caress.  \"He told me all about how your father fought in the Franco-Prussian War,\" Tom went on, \"and he gave me this button and he said it was made from a cannon they used and----\"  \"Ah, yess, I know!\" Florette exclaimed delightedly.  \"He said if I should ever happen to be in Alsace all I'd have to do would be to show it to any French people and they'd help me. He said it was a kind of--a kind of a vow all the French people had--that the Germans didn't know anything about. And 'specially families that had men in the Franco-Prussian War. He told me how he escaped, too, and got to America, and about how he hit the German soldier that came to arrest you for singing the _Marseillaise_.\"  The girl's face colored with anger, and yet with pride.  \"Mostly what we came here for,\" Tom added in his expressionless way, \"was to get some food and get rested before we start again. We're going through Switzerland to join the Americans--and if you'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18954"],["title","Tom Slade with the Boys Over There (#2)"],["body","a little while you can sing the _Marseillaise_ all you want.\"  Something in his look and manner as he sat there, uncouth and forlorn, sent a thrill through her.  \"Zey are all like you?\" she repeated. \"Ze Americans?\"  \"Your brother and I got to be pretty good friends,\" said Tom simply; \"he talked just like you. When we got to a French port--I ain't allowed to tell you the name of it--but when we got there he went away on the train with all the other soldiers, and he waved his hand to me and said he was going to win Alsace back. I liked him and I liked the way he talked. He got excited, like----\"  \"Ah, yess--my bruzzer!\"  \"So now he's with General Pershing. It seemed funny not to see him after that. I thought about him a lot. When he talked it made me feel more patriotic and proud, like.\"  \"Yess, yess,\" she urged, the tears standing in her eyes.  \"Sometimes you sort of get to like a feller and you don't know why. He would always get so excited, sort of, when he talked about France or Uncle Sam that he'd throw his cigarette away. He wasted a lot of 'em. He said everybody's got two countries, his own and France.\"  \"Ah, yess,\" she exclaimed.  \"Even if I didn't care anything about the war,\" Tom went on in his dull way, \"I'd want to see France get Alsace back just on account of him.\"  Florette sat gazing at him, her eyes brimming.  \"And you come to Zhermany, how?\"  \"After we started back the ship I worked on got torpedoed and I was picked up by a submarine. I never saw the inside of one before. So that's how I got to Germany. They took me there and put me in the prison camp at Slopsgotten--that ain't the way to say it, but----\"  \"You've got to sneeze it,\" interrupted Archer.  \"Yes, I know,\" she urged eagerly, \"and zen----\"  \"And then when I found out that it was just across the border from Alsace I happened to think about having that button, and I thought if I could escape maybe the French people would help me if I showed it to 'em like Frenchy said.\"  \"Oh, yess, _zey will_! But we must be careful,\" said Florette.  \"It was funny how I met Archer there,\" said Tom. \"We used to know each other in New York. He had even more adventures than I did getting there.\"  \"And you escaped?\"  \"Yop.\"  \"We put one over on 'em,\" said Archer. \"It was his idea (indicating Tom). They let us have some chemical stuff to fix the pump engine with and we melted the barbed wire with it and made a place to crawl out through. I got a piece of the barbed wirre for a sooveneerr. Maybe you'd like to have it,\" Archer added, fumbling in his pockets.  Florette, smiling and crying all at once, still sat looking wonderingly from one to the other of this adventurous, ragged pair.  \"Those Germans ain't so smart,\" said Archer.  The girl only shook her head and explained to her parents. Then she turned to Tom.  \"My father wants to know if zey are all like you in America. Yess?\"  \"_He_ used to be a Boy Scout,\" said Archer. \"Did you everr hearr of them?\"  But Florette only shook her head again and stared. Ever since the war began she had lived under the shadow of the big prison camp. Many of her friends and townspeople, Alsatians loyal still to France, were held there among the growing horde of foreigners. Never had she heard of any one escaping. If two American boys could melt the wires and walk out, what would happen next?  And one of them had blithely announced that these mighty invincible Prussians \"couldn't even trail a mud turtle.\" She wondered what they meant by \"looping our trail.\"     CHAPTER IV  THE OLD WINE VAT   \"We thought maybe you'd let us stay here tonight and tomorrow,\" said Tom after the scanty meal which the depleted larder yielded, \"and tomorrow night we'll start out south; 'cause we don't want to be traveling in the daytime. Maybe you could give us some clothes so it'll change our looks. It's less than a hundred miles to Basel----\"  \"My pappa say you could nevaire cross ze frontier. Zere are wires--electric----\"  \"Electric wirres are ourr middle name,\" said Archer. \"We eat 'em.\"  \"We ain't scared of anything except the daylight,\" said Tom. \"Archy can talk some German and I got Frenchy's--Armand's--button to show to French people. When we once get into Switzerland we'll be all right.\"  He waited while the girl engaged in an animated talk with her parents. Then old Pierre patted the two boys affectionately on the shoulder while Florette explained.  \"It iss not for our sake only, it iss for yours. You cannot stay in ziss house. It iss not safe. You aire wonderful, zee how you escape, and to bring us news of our Armand! We must help you. But if zey get you zen we do not help you. Iss it so? Here every day ze Prussians come. You see? Zey do not follow you--you are what you say--too clevaire? But still zey come.\"  Tom listened, his heart in his throat at the thought of being turned out of this home where he had hoped for shelter.  \"We are already suspect,\" Florette explained. \"My pappa, he fought for France--long ago. But so zey hate him. My name zey get--how old----All zeze zings zey write down--everyzing. Zey come for me soon. I sang ze _Marseillaise_--you know?\"  \"Yes,\" said Tom, \"but that was years ago.\"  \"But we are suspect. Zey have write it all down. Nossing zey forget. Zey take me to work--out of Alsace. Maybe to ze great Krupps. I haf' to work in ze fields in Prussia maybe. You see? Ven zey come I must go. Tonight, maybe. Tomorrow. Maybe not yet----\"  She struggled to master her emotion and continued. \"Ziss is--what you call--blackleest house. You see? So you will hide where I take you. It iss bad, but we cannot help. I give you food and tomorrow in ze night I bring you clothes. Zese I must look for--Armand's. You see? Come.\"  They rose with her and as she stood there almost overcome with grief and shame and the strain of long suspense and apprehension, yet thinking only of their safety, the sadness of her position and her impending fate went to Tom's heart.  Old Pierre embraced the boys affectionately with his one arm, seeming to confirm all his daughter had said.  \"My pappa say it is best you stay not here in ziss house. I will show you where Armand used to hide so long ago when we play,\" she smiled through her tears. \"If zey come and find you----\"  \"I understand,\" said Tom. \"They couldn't blame it to you.\"  \"You see? Yess.\"  To Archer, who understood a few odds and ends of German old Pierre managed to explain in that language his sorrow and humiliation at their poor welcome.  All five then went into an old-fashioned kitchen with walls of naked masonry and a great chimney, and from a cupboard Florette and her mother filled a basket with such cold viands as were on hand. This, and a pail of water the boys carried, and after another affectionate farewell from Pierre and his wife, they followed the girl cautiously and silently out into the darkness.  Tom Slade had already felt the fangs of the German beast and he did not need any one to tell him that the loathsome thing was without conscience or honor, but as he watched the slender form of Armand's young sister hurrying on ahead of them and thought of all she had borne and must yet bear and of the black fear that must be always in her young heart, his sympathy for her and for this stricken home was very great.  He had not fully comprehended her meaning, but he understood that she and her parents were haunted by an ever-present dread, and that even in their apprehension it hurt them to skimp their hospitality or suffer any shadow to be cast on a stranger's welcome.  Florette led the way along a narrow board path running back from the house, through an endless maze of vine-covered arbor, which completely roofed all the grounds adjacent to the house. Tom, accustomed only to the small American grape arbor, was amazed at the extent of this vineyard.  \"Reminds you of an elevated railroad, don't it,\" said Archer.  On the rickety uprights (for the arbor like everything else on the old place was going to ruin under the alien blight) large baskets hung here and there. At intervals the structure sagged so that they had to stoop to pass under it, and here and there it was broken or uncovered and they caught glimpses of the sky.  They went over a little hillock and, still beneath the arbor, came upon a place where the vines had fallen away from the ramshackle trellis and formed a spreading mass upon the ground.  \"You see?\" whispered the girl in her pretty way. \"Here Armand he climb. Here he hide to drop ze grapes down my neck--so. Bad boy! So zen it break--crash! He tumbled down. Ah--my pappa so angry. We must nevaire climb on ze trellis. You see? Here I sit and laugh--so much--when he tumble down!\"  She smiled and for a moment seemed all happiness, but Tom Slade heard a sigh following close upon the smile. He did not know what to say so he simply said in his blunt way:  \"I guess you had good times together.\"  \"Now I will zhow you,\" she said, stooping to pull away the heavy tangle of vine.  Tom and Archer helped her and to their surprise there was revealed a trap-door about six feet in diameter with gigantic rusty hinges.  \"Ziss is ze cave--you see?\" she said, stooping to lift the door. Tom bent but she held him back. \"Wait, I will tell you. Zen you can open it.\" For a moment pleasant recollections seemed to have the upper hand, and there was about her a touch of that buoyancy which had made her brother so attractive to sober Tom.  \"Wait--zhest till I tell you. When I come back from ze school in England I have read ze story about 'Kidnap.' You know?\"  \"It's by Stevenson; I read it,\" said Archer.  \"You know ze cave vere ze Scotch man live? So ziss is our cave. Now you lift.\"  The door did not stir at first and Florette, laughing softly, raised the big L band which bent over the top and lay in a rusted padlock eye.  \"Now.\"  The boys raised the heavy door, to which many strands of the vine clung, and Florette placed a stick to hold it up at an angle. Peering within by the light of a match, they saw "]]]
