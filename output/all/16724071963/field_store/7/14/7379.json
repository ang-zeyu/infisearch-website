As to whether he would turn the world upside down to straighten out some little error, perhaps Pete was right there, too. Roy Blakeley had once said that if Tom dropped his scout badge out of a ten-story window, he'd jump out after it. Indeed that _would_ have been something like Tom.  Anyway the saying was very much like Roy.     CHAPTER VI  \"THE WOODS PROPERTY\"   When Tom reached the office he took a few matters in to Mr. Burton.  \"Well, how are things coming on?\" his superior asked him cheerily. \"Getting back in line, all right? This early spring weather ought to be a tonic to an old scout like you. Here--here's a reminder of spring and camping for you. Here's the deed for the woods property at last--a hundred and ninety acres more for Temple Camp. We'll be as big as New York pretty soon, when we get some of that timber down, and some new cabins up.  \"I'm glad we got it,\" Tom said.  \"Well, I should hope,\" Mr. Burton came back at him. \"That's off the Archer farm, you know. Gift from Mr. Temple. Runs right up to the peak of the hill--see?\"  Tom looked at the map of the new Temple Camp property, which almost doubled the size of the camp and at the deed which showed the latest generous act of the camp's benevolent founder.  \"Next summer, if we have the price, we'll put up a couple of dozen new cabins on that hill and make a bid for troops from South Africa and China; what do you say? This should be put in the safe and, let's see, here are some new applications--Michigan, Virginia--Temple Camp is getting some reputation in the land.\"  \"I had an application from Ohio yesterday,\" Tom said; \"a three-patrol troop. I gave them the cabins on the hill. They're a season troop.\"  Mr. Burton glanced suddenly at Tom, then began whistling and drumming his fingers on the desk. He seemed on the point of saying something in this connection, but all he did say was, \"You find pleasure and relaxation in the work, Tom?\"  \"It's next to camping to be here,\" Tom said.  \"Well, that's what I thought,\" Mr. Burton said encouragingly. \"You must go slow and take it easy and pretty soon you'll be fit and trim.\"  \"I got to thank you,\" Tom said with his characteristic blunt simplicity.  \"I don't know what we should do in the spring rush without your familiar knowledge of the camp, Tom,\" Mr. Burton said.  \"I think he thinks more of the office than he does of the scouts,\" Margaret ventured to observe. She was sitting alongside Mr. Burton's desk awaiting his leisure, and Tom was standing awkwardly close by.  \"I suppose it's because they don't grow fast enough,\" Mr. Burton laughed; \"they can't keep up with him. To my certain knowledge young Peewee, as they call him, hasn't grown a half an inch in two years. It isn't because he doesn't eat, either, because I observed him personally when I visited camp.\"  \"Oh, he eats _terrifically_,\" Margaret said.  \"I like the troop better than anything else,\" Tom said.  \"Well, I guess that's right, Tom,\" Mr. Burton observed; \"old friends are the best.\"  He gathered up an armful of papers and handed them to Tom who went about his duties.  The day was long and the routine work tedious. The typewriter machine rattled drowsily and continuously on, telling troops here and there that they could have camp accommodations on this or that date. Tom pored over the big map, jotting down assignments and stumblingly dictated brief letters which Miss Ellison's readier skill turned out in improved form.  He was sorry that it was not Friday so that he might go to troop meeting that night. It was only Tuesday and so there were three long, barren nights ahead of him, and to him they seemed like twenty nights. All the next day he worked, making a duplicate of the big map for use at the camp, but his fingers were not steady and the strain was hard upon his eyes. He went home (if a hall-room in a boarding house may be called home) with a splitting headache.  On Wednesday he worked on the map and made the last assignment of tent accommodations. Temple Camp was booked up for the season. It was going to be a lively summer up there, evidently. One troop was coming all the way from Idaho--to see Peewee Harris eat pie, perhaps. I can't think for what other reason they would have made such a journey.  \"And _you_ will live in the pavilion in all your glory, won't you?\" Margaret teased him. \"I suppose you'll be very proud to be assistant to Uncle Jeb. I don't suppose you'll notice poor _me_ if I come up there.\"  \"I'll take you for a row on the lake,\" Tom said. That was saying a good deal, for _him_.  On Thursday he sent an order for fifteen thousand wooden plates, which will give you an idea of how they eat at Temple Camp. He attended to getting the licenses for the two launches and sent a letter up to old Uncle Jeb telling him to have a new springboard put up and notifying him that the woods property now belonged to the camp. It was a long slow day and a longer, slower night.  Once, and only once, since his return, he had tried the movies. The picture showed soldiers in the trenches and the jerky scenes and figures made his eyes ache and set his poor sick nerves on edge. Once he had _almost_ asked Margaret if he might go over to East Bridgeboro and see her. He was glad when Friday morning came, and the day passed quickly and gayly, because of the troop meeting that night. He counted the hours until eight o'clock.  When at last he set out for the troop room he found that he had forgotten his scout badge and went back after it. He was particular always to wear this at meetings, because he wished to emphasize there, that he was still a scout. He was always forgetting something these days. It was one of the features of shell-shock. It was like a wound, only you could not _see_ it....     CHAPTER VII  JUST NONSENSE   How should those scouts know that Tom Slade had been counting the days and hours, waiting for that Friday night? They were not mind readers. They knew that Tom Slade, big business man that he was, had much to occupy him.  And they too, had much to occupy them. For with the coming of Spring came preparations for the sojourn up to camp where they were wont to spent the month of August. At Temple Camp troops were ever coming and going and there were new faces each summer, but the Bridgeboro Troop was an institution there. It was because of his interest in this troop, and particularly in Tom's reformation, that Mr. John Temple of Bridgeboro, had founded the big camp in the Catskills. There was no such thing as favoritism there, of course, but it was natural enough that these boys, hailing from Mr. Temple's own town, where the business office of the camp was maintained, should enjoy a kind of prestige there. Their two chief exhibits (A and B) that is, Roy Blakeley and Peewee Harris strengthened this prestige somewhat, and their nonsense and banter were among the chief features of camp entertainment.  Temple Camp without P. Harris, some one had once said, would be like mince pie without any mince. And surely Peewee had no use for mince pie without any mince.  \"Oh, look who's here!\" Roy Blakeley shouted, as Tom quietly took a seat on the long bench, which always stood against the wall. \"Tomasso, as I live! I thought you'd be down at the Opera House to-night.\"  \"I don't care thirty cents about the movies,\" Tom said, soberly.  \"You should say thirty-three cents, Tomasso,\" Roy shot back at him: \"don't forget the three cents war tax.\"  \"Are you going to play that geography game?\" Tom asked hopefully.  \"Posilutely,\" said Roy; \"we'll start with me. Who discovered America? Ohio. Correct.\"  \"What?\" yelled Peewee.  \"Columbus is in Ohio; it's the same thing--only different,\" said Roy; \"you should worry. How about it, Tomasso?\"  Tom was laughing already. It would have done Mr. Burton and Mr. Ellsworth good to see him.  \"We were having a hot argument about the army, before you came in,\" Connie Bennett said. \"Peewee claims the infantry is composed of infants....\"  \"Sure,\" Roy vociferated, \"just the same as the quartermaster is the man who has charge of all the twenty-five cent pieces. Am I right, Lucky Luke? Hear what Lucky Luke says? I'm right. Correct.\"  \"Who's going to boss the meeting to-night?\" Doc Carson asked.  \"How about you, Tom?\" Grove Bronson inquired.  Tom smiled and shook his head. \"I just like to watch you,\" said he.  \"It's your job,\" Doc persisted, \"as long as Mr. Ellsworth is away.\"  There was just the suggestion of an uncomfortable pause, while the scouts, or most of them, waited. For just a second even Roy became sober, looking inquiringly at Tom.  \"I'd rather just watch you,\" Tom said, uneasily.  \"He doesn't care anything about the scouts any more,\" Dorry Benton piped up.  \"Since he's a magnet,\" Peewee shouted.  \"You mean a magnate,\" Doc said.  \"What difference does it make what I mean?\" the irrepressible Peewee yelled.  \"As long as you don't mean anything,\" Roy shouted. \"Away dull care; let's get down to business. To-morrow is Saturday, there's no school.\"  \"There's a school, only we don't go to it,\" Peewee shouted.  \"For that take a slap on the wrist and repeat the scout law nineteen times backward,\" Roy said. \"Who's going to boss this meeting?  \"I won't let anybody boss me,\" Peewee yelled.  Roy vaulted upon the table, while the others crowded about, Tom all the while laughing silently. This was just what he liked.  \"Owing to the absence of our beloved scoutmaster,\" Roy shouted, \"and the sudden rise in the world of Tomasso Slade, alias Lucky Luke, alias Sherlock Nobody Holmes, and his unwillingness to run this show, because he saw General Pershing and is too chesty, I nominate for boss and vice-boss of this meeting, Blakeley and Harris, with a platform....\"  \"We don't need any platform,\" Peewee shouted; \"haven't we got the table?\"  \"It's better to stand on the table than to stand on ceremonies,\" Dorry Benton vociferated.  \"Sure, or to stand "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18943"],["title","Tom Slade at Black Lake (#4)"],["body","our dignity like Tomasso Slade,\" Westy Martin shouted.  \"Put away your hammer, stop knocking,\" Doc said. \"Are we going to hike to-morrow or are we going to the city?\"  \"Answered in the affirmative,\" Roy said.  \"Which are we going to do?\" Peewee yelled.  \"We are!\" shouted Roy.  \"Do we go to the city?\" Doc asked seriously.  \"Posilutely,\" said Roy; \"that's why I'm asking who's boss of this meeting; so we can take up a collection.\"  \"All right, go ahead and be boss as long as you're up there,\" Connie Bennett said, \"only don't stand on the cake.\"  \"Don't slip on the icing,\" Westy shouted.  \"I'll slip on your neck if you don't shut up,\" Roy called. \"If I'm boss, I'd like to have some silence.\"  \"Don't look at me, _I_ haven't got any,\" Peewee piped up.  \"Thou never spak'st a truer word,\" Westy observed.  \"I would like to have a large chunk of silence,\" said Roy; \"enough to last for at least thirty seconds.\"  \"You'd better ask General Slade,\" said Doc; \"he's the only one that carries that article around with him.\"  \"How about that, Tommy?\" Wig Weigand asked pleasantly.  Tom smiled appreciatively, and seemed on the point of saying something, but he didn't.  There was one other scout, too, who made a specialty of silence in that hilarious Bedlam, and that was a gaunt, thin, little fellow with streaky hair and a pale face, who sat huddled up, apparently enjoying the banter, laughing with a bashful, silent laugh. He made no noise whatever, except when occasionally he coughed, and the others seemed content to let him enjoy himself in his own way. His eyes had a singular brightness, and when he laughed his white teeth and rather drawn mouth gave him almost a ghastly appearance. He seemed as much of an odd number as Tom himself, but not in the same way, for Tom was matter-of-fact and stolid, and this little gnome of a scout seemed all nerves and repressed excitement.  \"Let's have a chunk of silence, Alf,\" Roy called to him.  \"Go ahead,\" Doc shouted.  \"If there's going to be a collection, let's get it over with,\" Westy put in.  Roy, standing on the table, continued:  \"SCOUTS AND SCOUTLETS:  \"Owing to the high cost of silence, which is as scarce as sugar at these meetings, I will only detain you a couple of minutes....\"  \"Don't step on the cake,\" Doc yelled.  \"The object of this meeting is, to vote on whether we'll go into the city to-morrow and get some stuff we'll need up at camp.  \"Artie has got a list of the things we need, and they add up to four dollars and twenty-two cents. If each fellow chips in a quarter, we'll have enough. Each fellow that wants to go has to pay his own railroad fare--Alf is going with me, so he should worry.  \"I don't suppose that Marshall Slade will condescend and we should worry. If we're going up to camp on the first of August, we'll have to begin getting our stuff together--the sooner the quicker--keep still, I'm not through. We were all saying how numbers look funny on scout cabins--five, six, seven. It reminds you too much of school. Uncle Jeb said it would be a good idea for us to paint the pictures of our patrol animals on the doors and scratch off the numbers, because the way it is now, the cabins all look as if they had automobile licenses, and he said Daniel Boone would drop dead if he saw anything like that--Cabin B 26. _Good night!_\"  \"Daniel Boone is already dead!\" shouted Peewee.  \"Take a demerit and stay after school,\" Roy continued. \"So I vote that we buy some paint and see if we can't paint the heads of our three patrol animals on the three cabins. Then we'll feel more like scouts and not so much like convicts. If we do that, it will be thirty cents each instead of twenty-five.\"  Before Roy was through speaking, a scout hat was going around and the goodly jingle of coins within it, testified to the troops' enthusiasm for what he had been saying. Tom dropped in three quarters, but no one noticed that. He seemed abstracted and unusually nervous. The hat was not passed to little Alfred McCord. Perhaps that was because he was mascot....  [Illustration: TOM'S HAND CLUNG TO THE BACK OF THE BENCH. Tom Slade at Black Lake--Page 44]     CHAPTER VIII  FIVE, SIX, AND SEVEN   Then Tom Slade stood up. Any one observing him carefully would have noticed that his hand which clung to the back of the bench moved nervously, but otherwise he seemed stolid and dull as usual. For just a second he breathed almost audibly and bit his lip, then he spoke. They listened, a kind of balm of soothing silence pervaded the room, because he spoke so seldom these days. They seemed ready enough to pay him the tribute of their attention when he really seemed to take an interest.  \"I got to tell you something,\" he said, \"and maybe you won't like it. Those three cabins are already taken by a troop in Ohio.\"  \"Which three?\" Westy Martin asked, apparently dumbfounded.  \"Oh boy, suppose that was true!\" Roy said, amused at the very thought of such a possibility.  \"Which three?\" Westy repeated, still apparently in some suspense.  \"Tomasso has Westy's goat,\" Roy laughed.  \"Look at the straight face he's keeping,\" Doc laughed, referring to Tom.  \"I might as well tell you the truth,\" Tom said. \"I forget things sometimes; maybe you don't understand. Maybe it was because I wasn't here last year--maybe. But I didn't stop to think about those numbers being your--our--numbers. Now I can remember. I assigned those cabins to a troop in Ohio. They wanted three that were kind of separate from the others and--and--I--I didn't remember.\"  He seemed a pathetic spectacle as he stood there facing them, jerking his head nervously in the interval of silence and staring amazement that followed. There was no joking about it and they knew it. It was not in Tom's nature to \"jolly.\"  \"What do you mean, assigned them?\" Connie asked, utterly nonplussed. \"You don't mean you gave our three cabins on the hill to another troop?\"  \"Yes, I did,\" Tom said weakly; \"I remember now. I'm sorry.\"  For a moment no one spoke, then Dorry Benton said, \"Do you mean that?\"  \"I got to admit I did,\" Tom said in his simple, blunt way.  \"Well I'll be----\" Roy began. Then suddenly, \"You sober old grave digger,\" said he laughing; \"you're kidding the life out of us and we don't know it. Let's see you laugh.\"  But Tom did not laugh. \"I'm sorry, because they were the last three cabins,\" he said. \"I don't know how I happened to do it. But you've got no right to misjudge me, you haven't; only yesterday I told Mr. Burton I liked the troop, you fellows, best----\"  Roy Blakeley did not wait for him to finish; he threw the troop book on the table and stared at Tom in angry amazement. \"All right,\" he said, \"let it go at that. Now we know where you stand. Thanks, we're glad to know it,\" he added in a kind of contemptuous disgust. \"Ever since you got back from France I knew you were sick and tired of us--I could see it. I knew you only came around to please Mr. Ellsworth. I knew you forgot all about the troop. But I didn't think you'd put one like that over on us, I'll be hanged if I did! You mean to tell me you didn't know those three cabins were ours, after we've had them every summer since the camp started? Mr. Burton will fix it----\"  \"He can't fix it,\" Tom said; \"not now.\"  \"And I suppose we'll have to take tent space,\" Connie put in. \"Gee williger, that's one raw deal.\"  \"But _you_ won't have to take tent space, will you?\" Roy asked. \"You should worry about _us_--we're nothing but scouts--kids. We didn't go over to France and fight. We only stayed here and walked our legs off selling Liberty Bonds to keep you going. Gee whiz, I knew you were sick and tired of us, but I didn't think you'd hand us one like that.\"  \"Don't get excited, Roy,\" Doc Carson urged.  \"Who's excited?\" Roy shouted. \"A lot _he_ has to worry about. He'll be sleeping on his nice metal bed in the pavilion--assistant camp manager--while we're bunking in tents if we're lucky enough to get any space. Don't talk to _me_! I could see this coming. I suppose the scoutmaster of that troop out in Ohio was a friend of his in France. We should worry. We can go on a hike in August. It's little Alf I'm thinking of mostly.\"  It was noticeable that Tom Slade said not a word. With him actions always spoke louder than words and he had no words to explain his actions.  \"All I've got to say to _you_\" said Roy turning suddenly upon him, \"is that as long as you care so much more about scouts out west than you do about your own troop, you'd better stay away from here--that's all I've got to say.\"  \"That's what I say, too,\" said Westy.  \"Same here,\" Connie said; \"Jiminies, after all we did for you, to put one over on us like that; I don't see what you want to come here for anyway.\"  \"I--I haven't got any other place to go,\" said Tom with touching honesty; \"it's kind of like a home----\"  \"Well, there's one other place and that's the street,\" said Roy. \"We haven't got any place to go either, thanks to you. You're a nice one to be shouting home sweet home--you are.\"  With a trembling hand, Tom Slade reached for his hat and fingering it nervously, paused for just a moment, irresolute.  \"I wouldn't stay if I'm not wanted,\" he said; \"I'll say good night.\"  No one answered him, and he went forth into the night.  He had been put out of the tenement where he had once lived with his poor mother, he had been put out of school as a young boy, and he had been put out of the Public Library once; so he was not unaccustomed to being put out. Down near the station he climbed the steps of Wop Harry's lunch wagon and had a sandwich and a cup of coffee. Then he went home--if one might call it home....     CHAPTER IX  ROY'S NATURE   Roy Blakeley was a scout of the scouts, and no sooner had he got away from the atmosphere of resentment and disappointment which pervaded the troop room, then he began to feel sorry for what he had said. The picture of Tom picking up his hat and going forth into the night and to his poor home, lingered in Roy's mind and"]]]
