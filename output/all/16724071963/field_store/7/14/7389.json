He had a peculiar way of talking as if he spoke through his nose. Though Dickie Deer Mouse had seen him before, he had paid scant attention to Mr. Pine Finch. But when he caught sight of him on a certain chilly morning there were so few birds stirring that Dickie stopped short and watched Mr. Pine Finch, who was so busy in a tree-top that he didn't know anybody else was near him.  He was talking to himself. And as nearly as Dickie Deer Mouse could tell, he was remarking--through his nose--that he was having a good breakfast.  That news made Dickie Deer Mouse prick up his big ears. A good breakfast was something that he had not enjoyed for a long, long time.  At first Dickie couldn't quite see what Mr. Pine Finch was about. It was he, beyond a doubt. There could be no more mistaking his odd voice than his plump, black-streaked back, with its splashes of yellow at the base of his tail, and his yellow-edged wings. Dickie had a good view of Mr. Pine-Finch's back, because its owner hung upside down from the tips of the branches of the tree where Dickie spied him.  To Dickie Deer Mouse the sight, at first, was somewhat of a puzzle. He stood quite still, gazing upward in wonder. And then all at once he discovered what Mr. Pine Finch was doing. Something struck Dickie Deer Mouse lightly on his back--something that made him jump.  He looked all around to see what had hit him. And there, on the snow beside him, lay a bud off the tree above him.  Then Dickie Deer Mouse understood what Mr. Pine Finch was about. He was eating the buds that clung to the tips of the branches.  Dickie Deer Mouse quickly ate that bud; and then he waited, watching eagerly every move that Mr. Pine Finch made.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  XXIII  A FEAST AT LAST   To Dickie Deer Mouse, waiting impatiently for Mr. Pine Finch to drop another bud out of the tree-top, it began to seem as if his good luck were short lived. Could it be possible that Mr. Pine Finch was so careful that he lost a bud only once in a long time--perhaps only once a year?  But as Dickie Deer Mouse wondered, a small shower of buds came rattling down upon the snow-crust. And Dickie Deer Mouse snatched them up, every one, and ate them hungrily.  In a little while he felt so much better that he called out to Mr. Pine Finch:  \"Shake a lot of 'em down--there's a good fellow!\"  Mr. Pine Finch fluttered to a perch on a limb and looked down in great surprise.  \"Did you speak?\" he inquired.  \"Yes!\" Dickie Deer Mouse piped up. \"You know, I can climb a tree; but I can't crawl out to the tips of the branches, because I'm too heavy. So you'll oblige me if you'll drop a few dozen more of those buds.\"  The request surprised Mr. Pine Finch. His face told that much.  \"_Buds!_\" he exclaimed. \"Why do you want _buds_?\"  \"I eat them--when I can get them,\" Dickie Deer Mouse informed him.  The streaked gentleman in the tree looked quite blank.  \"What a strange thing to do!\" he cried through his nose--or so it seemed.  \"Strange!\" Dickie Deer Mouse echoed. \"Why, you've just been eating some yourself!\" And he couldn't help thinking that Mr. Pine Finch was even odder than he sounded.  \"That's so,\" Mr. Pine Finch admitted. \"In fact, I may say that I'm very, very fond of tree-buds. But I'm a bird. And of course everybody knows that you're a rodent.\"  \"I'm hungry, anyway,\" Dickie Deer Mouse retorted. He didn't mind Mr. Finch's calling him names, if only he would drop some more buds.  \"You're hungry, eh?\" the odd gentleman in the tree replied. \"That reminds me that I'm still hungry myself. So I can't stop to talk with you any longer just now.\"  Then he turned himself upside down, as he picked out a promising cluster of buds. And before he had finished his breakfast he had dropped so many buds that Dickie Deer Mouse called to him and thanked him for his kindness.  \"What! Are you still there?\" Mr. Pine Finch exclaimed, gazing down at Dickie as if he were greatly surprised to see him lingering beneath the tree. \"I must go away now,\" Mr. Pine Finch added. \"But I'll make this remark before I leave: If you have anything more to say to me, you can find me here almost any morning soon after daybreak.\" And then he flew off.  Dickie Deer Mouse told himself that he was in luck. By coming to that spot early every day he could pick up buds enough--dropped carelessly by Mr. Pine Finch--to feed himself until spring came and the snow melted and uncovered the ground, where he knew he could find food.  So he went home and slept as he had not slept for weeks. And the next morning, when he went back to the tree where he had found Mr. Pine Finch, his eighteen cousins followed him. For Dickie Deer Mouse told them of his good fortune and asked them to share it with him.  As for Mr. Pine Finch, he looked queerer than ever when he saw that Dickie had brought eighteen of his relations with him. However, he bade them all good morning. And he seemed to be even clumsier than he had been the day before. He dropped an enormous number of buds; so many, in fact, that Dickie Deer Mouse wondered how Mr. Pine Finch managed to get enough breakfast for himself.  Perhaps that odd gentleman knew what he was about. To tell the truth, he had noticed the day before that Dickie Deer Mouse looked thin and hungry. His coat, too, struck Mr. Pine Finch as being somewhat shabby. But he said nothing to show Dickie Deer Mouse that he knew there was anything wrong. And if he dropped tree-buds on purpose, he never let anyone know it.  Anyhow, Mr. Pine Finch did not fail to appear at that tree a single morning during the rest of the winter. Before spring came the Deer Mouse family had long since decided that he was the best friend they had in all Pleasant Valley. And they all agreed that his voice, although he did talk through his nose, was the pleasantest they had ever heard.  At last the breakfast parties beneath Mr. Pine Finch's favorite tree came to an end. The snow vanished. Warm weather made the underground chamber in Farmer Green's pasture seem crowded and stuffy. And Dickie Deer Mouse said farewell to his eighteen cousins, because he wanted to look for a pleasant place in which to spend the summer.

In the good old days when Alsace was a part of France the old house stood there and was the scene of joy and plenty. In these evil days when Alsace belongs to Kaiser Bill, it stands there, its dim arbor and pretty, flower-laden trellises in strange contrast to the lumbering army wagons and ugly, threatening artillery which pass along the quiet road.  And if the prayers of its rightful owners are answered, it will still stand there in the happy days to come when fair Alsace shall be a part of France again and Kaiser Bill and all his clanking claptrap are gone from it forever.  The village in which this pleasant homestead stands is close up under the boundary of Rhenish Bavaria, or Germany proper (or improper), and in the happy days when Alsace was a part of France it had been known as Leteur, after the French family which for generations had lived in the old gray house.  But long before Kaiser Bill knocked down Rheims Cathedral and black-jacked Belgium and sank the Lusitania, he changed the name of this old French village to Dundgardt, showing that even then he believed in Frightfulness; for that is what it amounted to when he changed Leteur to Dundgardt.  But he could not very well change the old family name, even if he could change the names of towns and villages in his stolen province, and old Pierre Leteur and his wife and daughter lived in the old house under the Prussian menace, and managed the vineyard and talked French on the sly.  On a certain fair evening old Pierre and his wife and daughter sat in the arbor and chatted in the language which they loved. The old man had lost an arm in the fighting when his beloved Alsace was lost to France and he had come back here still young but crippled and broken-hearted, to live under the Germans because this was the home of his people. He had found the old house and the vineyard devastated.  After a while he married an Alsatian girl very much younger than himself, and their son and daughter had grown up, German subjects it is true, but hating their German masters and loving the old French Alsace of which their father so often told them.  While Florette was still a mere child she committed the heinous crime of singing the _Marseillaise_. The watchful Prussian authorities learned of this and a couple of Prussian soldiers came after her, for she must answer to the Kaiser for this terrible act of sedition.  Her brother Armand, then a boy of sixteen, had shouted \"_Vive la France!_\" in the very faces of the grim soldiers and had struck one of them with all his young strength.  In that blow spoke gallant, indomitable France!  For this act Armand might have been shot, but, being young and agile and the German soldiers being fat and clumsy, he effected a flank move and disappeared before they could lay hands on him and it was many a long day before ever his parents heard from him again.  At last there came a letter from far-off America, telling of his flight across the mountains into France and of his working his passage to the United States. How this letter got through the Prussian censorship against all French Alsatians, it would be hard to say. But it was the first and last word from him that had ever reached the blighted home.  After a while the storm cloud of the great war burst and then the prospect of hearing from Armand became more hopeless as the British navy threw its mighty arm across the ocean highway. And old Pierre, because he was a French veteran, was watched more suspiciously than ever.  Florette was nearly twenty now, and Armand must be twenty-three or four, and they were talking of him on this quiet, balmy night, as they sat together in the arbor. They spoke in low tones, for to talk in French was dangerous, they were already under the cloud of suspicion, and the very trees in the neighborhood of a Frenchman's home seemed to have ears....     CHAPTER II  AN APPARITION   \"But how could we hear from him now, Florette, any better than before?\" the old man asked.  \"America is our friend now,\" the girl answered, \"and so good things must happen.\"  \"Indeed, great things will happen, dear Florette,\" her father laughed, \"and our beloved Alsace will be restored and you shall sing the _Marseillaise_ again. _Vive l'Amerique!_ She has come to us at last!\"  \"Sh-h-h,\" warned Madame Leteur, looking about; \"because America has joined us is no reason we should not be careful. See how our neighbor Le Farge fared for speaking in the village but yesterday. It is glorious news, but we must be careful.\"  \"What did neighbor Le Farge say, mamma?\"  \"Sh-h-h. The news of it is not allowed. He said that some one told him that when the American General Pershing came to France, he stood by the grave of Lafayette and said, 'Lafayette, we are here.'\"  \"Ah, Lafayette, yes!\" said the old man, his voice shaking with pride.  \"But we must not even know there is a great army of Americans here. We must know nothing. We must be blind and deaf,\" said Madame Leteur, looking about her apprehensively.  \"America will bring us many good things, my sweet Florette,\" said her father more cautiously, \"and she will bring triumph to our gallant France. But we must have patience. How can she send us letters from Armand, my dear? How can she send letters to Germany, her enemy?\"  \"Then we shall never hear of him till the war is over?\" the girl sighed. \"Oh, it is my fault he went away! It was my heedless song and I cannot forgive myself.\"  \"The _Marseillaise_ is not a heedless song, Florette,\" said old Pierre, \"and when our brave boy struck the Prussian beast----\"  \"Sh-h-h,\" whispered Madame Leteur quickly.  \"There is no one,\" said the old man, peering cautiously into the bushes; \"when he struck the Prussian beast, it was only what his father's son must do. Come, cheer up! Think of those noble words of America's general, 'Lafayette, we are here.' If we have not letters from our son, still America has come to us. Is not this enough? She will strike the Prussian beast----\"  \"Sh-h-h!\"  \"There is no one, I tell you. She will strike the Prussian beast with her mighty arm harder than our poor noble boy could do with his young hand. Is it not so?\"  The girl looked wistfully into the dusk. \"I thought we would hear from him when we had the great news from America.\"  \"That is because you are a silly child, my sweet Florette, and think that America is a magician. We must be patient. We do not even know all that her great president said. We are fed with lies----\"  \"Sh-h-h!\"  \"And how can we hear from Armand, my dear, when the Prussians do not even let us know what America's president said? All will be well in good time.\"  \"He is dead,\" said the girl, uncomforted. \"I have had a dream that he is dead. And it is I that killed him.\"  \"This is a silly child,\" said old Pierre.  \"America is full of Prussians--spies,\" said the girl, \"and they have his name on a list. They have killed him. They are"]]]
