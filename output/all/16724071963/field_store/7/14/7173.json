It is one of the partners in a very close combination where, by doing a particular work, it, shares in the profits of all. What is true of the hand is true of every other organ of the body.  *An Organization.*—The relations which the different organs sustain to each other and to the body as a whole suggest the possibility of classifying the body as an organization. This term is broadly applied to a variety of combinations. An organization is properly defined as _any group of individuals which, in working together for a common purpose, practices the division of labor_. This definition will be better understood by considering a few familiar examples.  A baseball team is an organization. The team is made up of individual players. These work together for the common purpose of winning games. They practice the division of labor in that the different players do different things—one catching, another pitching, and so on. A manufacturing establishment which employs several workmen may also be an organization. The article manufactured provides the common purpose toward which all strive; and, in the assignment of different kinds of work to the individual workmen, the principle of division of labor is carried out. For the same reason a school, a railway system, an army, and a political party are organizations.  An organization of a lower order of individuals than these human organizations is to be found in a hive of bees. This is made up of the individual bees, and these, in carrying on the general work of the hive, are known to practice the division of labor.  *Is the Body an Organization*?—If the body is an organization, it must fulfill the conditions of the definition. It must be made up of separate or individual parts. These must work together for the same general purpose, and, in the accomplishment of this purpose, must practice the division of labor. That the body practices the division of labor is seen in the related work of the different organs. That it is made up of minute, but individual, parts will be shown in the chapter following. That it carries on a _general work_ which is accomplished through the combined action of its individual parts is revealed through an extended study of its various activities. _The body is an organization._ Moreover, it is one of the most complex and, at the same time, most perfect of the organizations of which we have knowledge.  *Summary.*—Viewed from the outside, the body is seen to be made up of divisions which are more or less familiar. Viewed internally, it is found to consist of different kinds of materials, called tissues. The tissues are adapted, by their properties, to different purposes both in the construction of the body and in carrying on its work. The working parts of the body are called organs and these in their work combine to form systems. The entire body, on account of the method of its construction and the character of its work, may be classed as an organization.  *Exercises.*—1. Name and locate the chief external divisions of the body.  2. What tissues may be found by dissecting the leg of a chicken?  3. Name the most important properties and the most important uses of muscular tissue, osseous tissue, and connective tissue.  4. Define an organ. Define a system. Name examples of each.  5. Name the chief cavities of the body and the organs which they contain.  6. What tissues are present in the hand? How does each of these aid in the work of the hand?  7. Define an organization. Show that a railway system, an army, and a school are organizations.  8. What is meant by the phrase \"division of labor\"? In what manner is the division of labor practiced in a shoe or watch factory? What are the advantages?  9. What are the proofs that the body is an organization?    PRACTICAL WORK   *Observation on the Tissues.*—Examine with care the structures in the entire leg of a chicken, squirrel, rabbit, or other small animal used for food. Observe, first of all, the external covering, consisting of cuticle and hair, claws, scales, or feathers, according to the specimen. These are similar in structure, and they form the epidermis, which is one kind of _epithelial_ tissue. With a sharp knife lay open the skin and observe that it is attached to the parts underneath by thin, but tough, threads and sheaths. These represent a variety of _connective_ tissue. The reddish material which forms the greater portion of the specimen is a variety of _muscular_ tissue, and its divisions are called muscles. With a blunt instrument, separate the muscles, by tearing apart the connective tissue binding them together, and find the glistening white strips of connective tissue (tendons) which attach them to the bones. Find near the central part of the leg a soft, white cord (a nerve) which represents one variety of _nervous_ tissue. The bones, which may now be examined, form the _osseous_ tissue. At the ends of the bones will be found a layer of smooth, white material which represents one kind of _cartilaginous_ tissue. The _adipose_, or fatty, tissue, which is found under the skin and between the other tissues, is easily recognized.  *Relation of the Tissues to the Organs.*—Observe in the specimen just studied the relation of the different tissues to the organ as a whole (regarding the leg as an organ), _i.e._, show how each of the tissues aids in the work which the organ accomplishes. Show in particular how the muscles supply the foot with motion, by tracing out the tendons that connect them with the toes. Pull on the different tendons, noting the effect upon the different parts of the foot.     CHAPTER III - THE BODY ORGANIZATION   What is the nature of the body organization? What are the individual parts, or units, that make it up? What general work do these carry on and upon what basis do they practice the division of labor? The answers to these questions will suggest the main problems in the study of the body.                                   [Fig. 3]     Fig. 3—Diagram showing the relation of the cells and the intercellular             material. _C._ Cells. _I._ Intercellular material.   *Complex Nature of the Tissues.*—To the unaided eye the tissues have the appearance of simple structures. The microscope, however, shows just the reverse to be true. When any one of the tissues is suitably prepared and carefully examined with this instrument, at least two classes of materials can be made out. One of these consists of minute particles, called _cells_; the other is a substance lying between the cells, known as the _intercellular material_ (Fig. 3). The cells and the intercellular material, though varying in their relative proportions, are present in all the tissues.  *The Body a Cell Group.*—The biologist has found that the bodies of all living things, plants as well as animals, consist either of single cells or of groups of cells. The single cells live independently of one another, but the cells that form groups are attached to, and are more or less dependent upon, one another. In the first condition are found the very lowest forms of life. In the second, life reaches its greatest development. The body of man, which represents the highest type of life, is recognized as a group of cells. In this group each cell is usually separate and distinct from the others, but is attached to them, and is held in place by the intercellular material.  *Protoplasm, the Cell Substance.*—The cell is properly regarded as an _organized_ bit of a peculiar material, called _protoplasm_. This is a semi-liquid and somewhat granular substance which resembles in appearance the white of a raw egg. Its true nature and composition are unknown, because any attempt to analyze it kills it, and dead protoplasm is essentially different from living protoplasm. It is known, however, to be a highly complex substance and to undergo chemical change readily. It appears to be the only kind of matter with which life is ever associated, and for this reason protoplasm is called the _physical basis of life_. Its organization into separate bits, or cells, is necessary to the life activities that take place within it.  *Structure of the Cell.*—Though all portions of the cell are formed from the protoplasm, this essential substance differs both in structure and in function at different places in the cell. For this reason the cell is looked upon as a complex body having several distinct parts. At or near the center is a clear, rounded body, called the _nucleus_. This plays some part in the nourishment of the cell and also in the formation of new cells. If it be absent, as is sometimes the case, the cell is short-lived and unable to reproduce itself. The variety of protoplasm contained in the nucleus is called the _nucleoplasm_.                                   [Fig. 4]   Fig. 4—Diagram of a typical cell (after Wilson). 1. Main body. 2. Nucleus. 3. Attraction sphere. 4. Food particles and waste. 5. Cell-wall. 6. Masses        of active material found in certain cells, called plastids.   Surrounding the nucleus is the _main body_ of the cell, sometimes referred to as the \"protoplasm.\" Since the protoplasm forms all parts of the cell, this substance is more properly called the _cytoplasm_, or cell plasm. Surrounding and inclosing the cytoplasm, in many cells, is a thin outer layer, or membrane, which affords more or less protection to the contents of the cell. This is usually referred to as the _cell-wall_. A fourth part of the cell is also described, being called the _attraction sphere_. This is a small body lying near the nucleus and coöperating with that body in the formation of new cells. Food particles, wastes, and other substances may also be present in the cytoplasm. The parts of a typical cell are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],["title","Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#3)"],["body","in Fig. 4.  *Importance of the Cells.*—The cells must be regarded as the living, working parts of the body. They are the active agents in all of the tissues, enabling them to serve their various purposes. Working through the tissues, they build up the body and carry on its different activities. They are recognized on this account as _the units of structure and of function_, and are the \"individuals\" in the body organization. Among the most important and interesting of the activities of the cells are those by which they build up the body, or cause it to grow.  *How the Cells enable the Body to Grow.*—Every cell is able to take new material into itself and to add this to the protoplasm. This tends to increase the amount of the protoplasm, thereby causing the cells to increase in size. A general increase in the size of the cells has the effect of increasing the size of the entire body, and this is one way by which they cause it to grow. There is, however, a fixed limit, varying with different cells, to the size which they attain, and this is quite low. (The largest cells are scarcely visible to the naked eye.) Any marked increase in the size of the body must, therefore, be brought about by other means. Such a means is found in the formation of new cells, or _cell reproduction_. The new cells are always formed _by_ and _from_ the old cells, the essential process being known as _cell-division_.                                   [Fig. 5]   Fig. 5—Steps in cell-division (after Wilson). Note that the process begins with the division of the attraction sphere, then involves the nucleus, and                      finally separates the main body.   *Cell-Division.*—By dividing, a single cell will, on attaining its growth, separate into two or more new cells. The process is quite complex and is imperfectly understood. It is known, however, that the act of separation is preceded by a series of changes in which the attraction sphere and the nucleus actively participate, and that, as a result of these changes, the contents of the old cell are rearranged to form the new cells. Some of the different stages in the process, as they have been studied under the microscope, are indicated in Fig. 5.  Gradually, through the formation of new cells and by the growth of these cells after they have been formed, the body attains its full size. When growth is complete, cell reproduction is supposed to cease except where the tissues are injured, as in the breaking of a bone, or where cells, like those at the surface of the skin, are subject to wear. Then new material continues to be added to the protoplasm throughout life, but in amount only sufficient to replace that lost from the protoplasm as waste.                                   [Fig. 6]   Fig. 6—A tumbler partly filled with marbles covered with water, suggesting                  the relations of the cells to the lymph.   *Cell Surroundings.*—All cells are said to be _aquatic_. This means simply that they require water for carrying on their various activities. The cells, in order to live, must take in and give out materials, and water is necessary to both processes. It is also an essential part of the protoplasm. Deprived of water, cells become inactive and usually die. Aquatic surroundings are provided for the cells of the body through a liquid known as the _lymph_, which is distributed throughout the intercellular material (Fig. 6). This consists of water containing oxygen and food substances in solution. Besides supplying these to the cells, the lymph also receives their wastes. Through the lymph the necessary conditions for cell life are provided in the body.  *The General Work of Cells.*—In handling the materials derived from the lymph, the cells carry on three well-defined processes, known as absorption, assimilation, and excretion.  _Absorption_ is the process of taking water, food, and oxygen into the cells.  _Assimilation_ is a complex process which results in the addition of the absorbed materials to the protoplasm. Through assimilation the protoplasm is built up or renewed.  _Excretion_ is the throwing off of such waste materials as have been formed in the cells. These are passed into the lymph and thence to the surface of the body.  Absorption, assimilation, excretion, and also reproduction are performed by all classes of cells. They are, on this account, referred to as the _general work of cells_.  *The Special Work of Cells.*—In addition to the general work which all cells do in common, each class of cells in the body is able to do some particular kind of work—a work which the others cannot do or which they can do only to a limited extent. This is spoken of as the _special work of cells_. Examples of the special work of cells are found in the production of motion by muscle cells and in the secretion of liquids by gland cells. It may be noted that while the general work of cells benefits them individually, their special work benefits the body as a whole. Another example of the special work of cells is found in the                                   [Fig. 7]     Fig. 7—Cartilage cells, surrounded by the intercellular material which                            they have deposited.   *Production of the Intercellular Material.*—Though most of the cells of the body deposit to a slight extent this material, the greater part of it is produced by a single class of cells found in bone, cartilage, and connective tissue. Cartilage, bone, and connective tissue differ greatly from the other tissues in the amount of intercellular material which they contain, the difference being due to these cells. In the connective tissue they deposit the fibrous material so important in holding the different parts of the body together. In the cartilage they produce the gristly substance which forms by far its larger portion (Fig. 7). In the bones they deposit a material similar to that in the cartilage, except that with it is mixed a mineral substance which gives the bones their hardness and stiffness.(4) The intercellular material, in addition to connecting the cells, supplies to certain tissues important properties, such as the elasticity of cartilage and the stiffness of the bones.  *Nature of the Body Organization.*—The division of labor carried on by the different organs, as shown in the preceding chapter, is in reality carried on by the cells that form the organs. To see that this is true we have only to observe the relation of cells to tissues and of tissues to organs. The cells form the tissues and the tissues form the organs. This arrangement enables the special work of different kinds of cells to be combined in the work of the organ as a whole. This is seen in the hand which, in grasping, uses motion supplied by the muscle cells, a controlling influence supplied by the nerve cells, a framework supplied by the bone cells, and so on. The cells supply the basis for the body organization and, properly speaking, the body is _an organization of cells_(5) (Recall the definition of an organization, page 10.) In this organization there are to be observed:  1. A definite arrangement of the cells to form the tissues. A tissue is a group of like cells.  2. A definite arrangement of the tissues in the organ. Each organ contains the tissues needed for its work.  3. In several instances there is a definite arrangement of organs to form systems.  4. The body as a whole is made up of organs and systems, together with the structures necessary for their support and protection.  There now remains a further question for consideration. What is the one supreme end, or purpose, toward which all the activities of the body organization are directed? This purpose will naturally have some relation to the maintenance, or preservation, of the cell group which we call the body.  *The Maintenance of Life.*—The preservation of any cell group in its natural condition, whether it be plant or animal, is accomplished through keeping it alive. If life ceases, the group quickly disintegrates and its elements become scattered, a fact which is verified through everyday observation. Though the nature of life is unknown, it may be looked upon as the organizer and preserver of the protoplasm. But in preserving the protoplasm it also preserves the entire cell group, or body. Life is thus the most essential condition of the body. _With life all portions of the body are concerned, and toward its maintenance all the activities of the body organization are directed_.  *The Nutrient Fluid in its Relations to the Cells.*—The maintenance of life within the cells requires, as we have seen, that they be supplied with water, food, and oxygen, and that they be relieved of such wastes as they form. This double purpose is accomplished through the agency of an internal nutrient fluid, a portion of which has already been referred to as the lymph. Not only does this fluid supply the means for keeping the cells alive, but, through the cells, it is also the means of preserving the life of the body as a whole.  The cells, however, rapidly exhaust the nutrient fluid. They take from it food and oxygen and they put into it their wastes. To prevent its becoming unfit for supplying their needs, food and oxygen must be continually added to this fluid, and waste materials must be continually removed. This is not an easy task. As a matter of fact, the preparation, distribution, and purification of the nutrient fluid requires the direct or indirect aid of practically all parts of the body. It supplies for this reason a broad basis for the division of labor on the part of the cells.  *Relation of the Body to its Environment.*—While life is directly dependent upon the internal nutrient fluid, it is indirectly dependent upon the physical surroundings of the body. Herein lies the need of the _external_ organs—the feet and legs for moving about, the hands for handling things, the eyes for directing movements, etc. That the great needs of the body are supplied from"]]]
