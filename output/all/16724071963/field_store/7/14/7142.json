This illustrates   the extremely unreal and untrue conception of the earth   among Moslem students, especially those who followed the   theories of Ptolomy--_e.g._, in the extension to   Africa eastward, so as practically or actually to join   China, making the Indian Ocean an inland sea.     THE MAPPE-MONDE OF ST. SEVER                             48    (B. Mus., Map room, shelf 35 [5], sheet 6). Of uncertain   date, between _c._ 780-980 but probably not later   than the 10th century. One of the earliest examples of   Christian map-making.     THE ANGLO-SAXON MAP                                      54    (B. Mus., Cotton mss., Tib. B.V., fol. 59). This gives   us the most interesting and accurate view of the world   that we get in the pre-Crusading Christian science. The   square, but not conventional outline is detailed with   considerable care and precision. The writing, though   minute, is legible; but the Nile, which, like the Red   Sea in Africa, is coloured _red_, in contrast to the   ordinary _grey_ of water in this example, is made to   wander about Africa from side to side, with occasional   disappearances, in a thoroughly mythical fashion. This   map, from a ms. of Priscian's _Peviegesis_, appears   to have been executed at the end of the 10th century; it   is on vellum, highly finished, and has been engraved, in   outline, in Playfair's _Atlas_ (Pl. I), and more fully   in the _Penny Magazine_ (July 22, 1837). In the reign   of Henry II., it appears to have belonged to Battle Abbey.     THE TURIN MAP OF THE 11TH CENTURY                        76    (B. Mus., Map room. From Ottino's reproduction).   One of the oldest and simplest of Christian Mappe-Mondes,   giving a special prominence to Paradise, (with the figures   of Adam, Eve, and the serpent), to the mountains and   rivers of the world, and to the four winds of heaven. It is   to be associated with the Spanish map of 1109, and the   Mappe-Monde of St. Sever.     THE SPANISH-ARABIC"]]]
