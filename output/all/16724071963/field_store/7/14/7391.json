It was, perhaps, seven feet in depth and the same in diameter and the bottom was covered with straw.  \"It is ze vat--ze wine vat,\" whispered Florette, amused at their surprise. \"Here we keep ze wine zat will cost so much.--But no more.--We make no wine ziss year,\" she sighed. \"Ziss makes ze fine flavor--ze earth all around. You see?\"  \"It's a dandy place to hide,\" said Archer.  \"So here you will stay and you will be safe. Tomorrow in ze night I shall bring you more food and some clothes. I am so sorry----\"  \"There ain't anything to be sorry about,\" said Tom. \"There's lots of room in there--more than there is in a bivouac tent. And it'll be comfortable on that straw, that's one sure thing. If you knew the kind of place we slept in up there in the prison you'd say this was all right. We'll stay here and rest all day tomorrow and after you bring us the things at night we'll sneak out and hike it along.\"  \"I will not dare to come in ze daytime,\" said Florette, \"but after it is dark, zen I will come. You must have ze cover almost shut and I will pull ze vines over it.\"  \"We'll tend to that,\" said Tom.  \"We'll camouflage it, all right,\" Archer added.  For a moment she lingered as if thinking if there were anything more she might do for their comfort. Then against her protest, Tom accompanied her part way back and they paused for a moment under the thickly covered trellis, for she would not let him approach the house.  \"I'm sorry we made you so much trouble,\" he said; \"it's only because we want to get to where we can fight for you.\"  \"Oh, yess, I know,\" she answered sadly. \"My pappa, it break his heart because he cannot make you ze true welcome. But you do not know. We are--how you say--persecute--all ze time. Zey own Alsace, but zey do not love Alsace. It is like--it is like ze stepfather--you see?\" she added, her voice breaking. \"So zey have always treat us.\"  For a few seconds Tom stood, awkward and uncomfortable; then clumsily he reached out his hand and took hers.  \"You don't mean they'll take you like they took the people from Belgium, do you?\" he asked.  \"Ziss is worse zan Belgium,\" Florette sobbed. \"Zere ze people can escape to England.\"  \"Where would they send you?\" Tom asked.  \"Maybe far north into Prussia. Maybe still in Alsace. All ze familees zey will separate so zey shall meex wiz ze Zhermans.\" Florette suddenly grasped his hand. \"I am glad I see you. So now I can see all ze Americans come--hoondreds----  \"Tomorrow in ze night I will bring you ze clothes,\" she whispered, \"and more food, and zen you will be rested----\"  \"I feel sorry for you,\" Tom blurted out with simple honesty, \"and I got to thank you. Both of us have--that's one sure thing. You're worse off than we are--and it makes me feel mean, like. But maybe it won't be so bad. And, gee, I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow night, too.\"  \"I will bring ze sings, _surely_,\" she said earnestly.  \"It isn't--it isn't only for that,\" he mumbled, \"it's because I'll kind of look forward to seeing you anyway.\"  For another moment she lingered and in the stillness of night and the thickly roofed arbor he could hear her breath coming short and quick, as she tried to stifle her emotion.  \"Is--is it a sound?\" she whispered in sudden terror.  \"No, it's only because you're scared,\" said Tom.  He stood looking after her as she hurried away under the ramshackle trellis until her slender figure was lost in the darkness.  \"It'll make me fight harder, anyway,\" he said to himself; \"it'll help me to get to France 'cause--'cause I _got_ to, and if you _got_ to do a thing--you can....\"     CHAPTER V  THE VOICE FROM THE DISTANCE   \"My idea,\" said Archer, when Tom returned, \"is to break that stick about in half and prop the doorr just wide enough open so's we can crawl in. Then we can spread the vines all overr the top just like it was beforre and overr the opening, too. What d'ye say?\"  \"That's all right,\" said Tom, \"and we can leave it a little open tonight. In the morning we'll drop it and be on the safe side.\"  \"Maybe we'd betterr drop it tonight and be on the safe side,\" said Archer. \"S'pose we should fall asleep.\"  \"We'll take turns sleeping,\" said Tom decisively. \"We can't afford to take any chances.\"  \"You can bet I'm going to get a sooveneerr of this place, anyway,\" said Archer, tugging at a rusty nail.  \"Never you mind about souvenirs,\" Tom said; \"let's get this door camouflaged.\"  \"I could swap that nail for a jack-knife back home,\" said Archer regretfully. \"A nail right fresh from Alsace!\"  But he gave it up and together they pulled the tangled vine this way and that, until the door and the opening beneath were well covered. Then they crawled in and while Archer reached up and held the door, Tom broke the stick so that the opening was reduced to the inch or two necessary for ventilation. Reaching out, they pulled the vine over this crack until they felt certain that no vestige of door or opening could be seen from without, and this done they sat down upon the straw, their backs against the walls of the vat, enjoying the first real comfort and freedom from anxiety which they had known since their escape from the prison camp.  \"I guess we're safe herre forr tonight, anyway,\" said Archer, \"but believe _me_, I think we've got some job on our hands getting out of this country. It's going to be no churrch sociable----\"  \"We got this far,\" said Tom, \"and by tomorrow night we ought to have a good plan doped out. We got nothing to do all day tomorrow but think about it.\"  \"Gee, I feel sorry for these people,\" said Archer; \"they'rre surre up against it. Makes me feel as if I'd like to have one good whack at Kaiser Bill----\"  \"Well, don't talk so loud and we'll get a whack at him, all right.\"  \"I'd like to get his old double-jointed moustache for a sooveneerr.\"  \"There you go again,\" said Tom.  Now that the excitement was over, they realized how tired they were and indeed the strain upon their nerves, added to their bodily fatigue, had brought them almost to the point of exhaustion.  \"I'm all in,\" said Archer wearily.  \"All right, go to sleep,\" said Tom, \"and after a while if you don't wake up I'll wake you. One of us has got to stay awake and listen. We can't afford to take any chances.\"  Archibald Archer needed no urging and in a minute he was sprawled upon the straw, dead to the world. The daylight was glinting cheerily through the interstices of tangled vine over the opening when he awoke with the heedless yawns which he might have given in his own beloved Catskills.  \"Don't make a noise,\" said Tom quickly, by way of caution. \"We're in the wine vat in Leteur's vineyard in Alsace, remember.\" It took Archer a moment to realize where they were. They ate an early breakfast, finding the simple odds and ends grateful enough, and then Tom took his turn at a nap.  Throughout most of that day they sat with their knees drawn up, leaning against the inside of the great vat, talking in hushed tones of their plans. There was nothing else they could do in the half darkness and the slow hours dragged themselves away monotonously. They had lowered the door, but still left it open upon the merest crack and out of this one or the other would peek at intervals, listening, heart in throat, for the dreaded sound of footfalls. But no one came.  \"I thought I hearrd a kind of rustling once,\" Archer said fearfully.  \"There's a couple of cows 'way over in a field,\" said Tom; \"they might have made some sound.\"  After what seemed to them an age, the leaves over the opening seemed bathed in a strange new light and glistened here and there.  \"That crack faces the west,\" said Tom. \"The sun's beginning to go down.\"  \"How do you know?\" asked Archer.  \"I always knew that up at Temple Camp. I don't know _how_ I know. The morning sun is different from the afternoon sun, that's all. I think it'll set now in about two hours.\"  \"I wonder when she'll come,\" Archer said.  \"Not till it's good and dark, that's sure. She's got to be careful. Maybe this place can be seen from the road, for all we know. Remember, we didn't see it in the daylight.\"  \"Sh-h-h,\" said Archer. \"Listen.\"  From far, far away there was borne upon the still air a dull, spent, booming sound at intervals.  \"It's the fighting,\" whispered Tom.  \"Wherre do you suppose it is?\" Archer asked, sobered by this audible reminder of their nearness to the seat of war.  \"I don't know,\" Tom said. \"I'm kind of mixed up. That feller in the prison had a map. Let's see. I think Nancy's the nearest place to here. Toul is near that. That's where our fellers are--around there. Listen!\"  Again the rumbling, faint but distinctly audible, almost as if it came from another world.  \"The trenches run right through there--near Nancy,\" said Tom.  \"Maybe it's _ourr_ boys, hey?\" Archer asked excitedly.  Tom did not answer immediately. He was thrilled at this thought of his own country speaking so that he, poor fugitive that he was, could hear it in this dark, lonesome dungeon in a hostile land, across all those miles.  \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice catching the least bit. \"They're in the Toul sector. A feller in prison told me. You don't feel so lonesome, kind of, when you hear that----\"  \"Gee, I hope we can get to them,\" said Archer.  \"What you _got_ to do, you can do,\" Tom answered. \"I wonder----\"  \"Sh-h. D'you hearr that?\" Archer whispered, clutching Tom's shoulder. \"It was much nearerr--right close----\"  They held their breaths as the reverberation of a sharp report died away.  \"What was it?\" Archer asked tensely.  \"I don't know,\" Tom whispered, instinctively removing the short stick and closing the trap door tight. \"Don't move--hush!\"     CHAPTER VI  PRISONERS AGAIN   \"Do you hear footsteps?\" Archer breathed.  Tom listened, keen and alert. \"No,\" he said at last. \"There's no one coming.\"  \"What do you s'pose it was?\"  \"I don't know. Sit down and don't get excited.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18954"],["title","Tom Slade with the Boys Over There (#4)"],["body","  But Tom was trembling himself, and it was not until five or ten minutes had passed without sound or happening that he was able to get a grip on himself.  \"Push up the door a little and listen,\" suggested Archer.  Tom cautiously pressed upward, but the door did not budge. \"It's stuck,\" he whispered.  Archer rose and together they pressed, but save for a little looseness the door did not move.  \"It's caught outside, I guess,\" said Tom. \"Maybe the iron hasp fell into the padlock when I put it down, huh?\"  That, indeed, seemed to be the case, for upon pressure the door gave a little at the corners, but not midway along the side where the fastening was. Archer turned cold at the thought of their predicament, and for a moment even Tom's rather dull imagination pictured the ghastly fate made possible by imprisonment in this black hole.  \"There's no use getting excited,\" he said. \"We get some air through the cracks and after dark she'll be here, like she said. It's beginning to get dark now, I guess.\"  But he could not sit quietly and wait through the awful suspense, and he pressed up against the boards at intervals all the way along the four sides of the door. On the side where the hinges were it yielded not at all. On the opposite side it held fast in the center, showing that by a perverse freak of chance it had locked itself. Elsewhere it strained a little on pressure, but not enough to afford any hope of breaking it.  \"If it was only lowerr,\" Archer said, \"so we could brace our shoulderrs against it, we might forrce it.\"  \"And make a lot of noise,\" said Tom. \"There's no use getting rattled; we'll just have to wait till she comes.\"  \"Yes, but it gives you the willies thinkin' about what would happen----\"  \"Well, don't let's think of it, then,\" Tom interrupted. \"We should worry.\" And suiting his action to the word, he seated himself, drew up his knees, and clasped his hands over them. \"We'll just have to wait, that's all.\"  \"What do you suppose that sound was?\" Archer asked.  \"I don't know; some kind of a gun. It ain't the first gun that's been shot off in Europe lately.\"  For half an hour or so they sat, trying to make talk, and each pretended to himself and to the other that he was not worrying. But Tom, who had a scout's ear, started and his heart beat faster at every trifling stir outside. Then, as they realized that darkness must have fallen, they became more alert for sounds and a little apprehensive. They knew Florette would come quietly, but Tom believed he could detect her approach.  After a while, they abandoned all their pretence of nonchalant confidence and did not talk at all. Of course, they knew Florette would come in her own good time, but the stifling atmosphere of that musty hole and the thought of what _might_ happen----  Suddenly there was a slight noise outside and then, to their great relief, the unmistakable sound of footfalls on the planks above them, softened by the thick carpet of matted vine.  \"Sh-h, don't speak!\" Tom whispered, his heart beating rapidly. \"Wait till she unfastens it or says something.\"  For a few seconds--a minute--they waited in breathless suspense. Then came a slight rustle as from some disturbance of the vine, then footfalls, again, modulated and stealthy they seemed, on the door just above them. A speck of dirt, or an infinitesimal pebble, maybe, fell upon Archer's head from the slight jarring of some crack in the rough door. Then silence.  Breathlessly they waited, Archer nervously clutching Tom's arm.  \"Don't speak,\" Tom warned in the faintest whisper.  Still they waited. But no other sound broke upon the deathlike solitude and darkness....     CHAPTER VII  WHERE THERE'S A WILL----   \"They're hunting for us,\" whispered Tom hoarsely. \"It's good it was shut.\"  \"I'd ratherr have them catch us,\" shivered Archer, \"than die in herre.\"  \"We haven't died yet,\" said Tom, \"and they haven't caught us either. Don't lose your nerves. She'll come as soon as she can.\"  For a few minutes they did not speak nor stir, only listened eagerly for any further sound.  \"What do you s'pose that shot was?\" Archer whispered, after a few minutes more of keen suspense.  \"I don't know. A signal, maybe. They're searching this place for us, I guess. Don't talk.\"  Archer took comfort from Tom's calmness, and for half an hour more they waited, silent and apprehensive. But nothing more happened, the solemn stillness of the countryside reigned without, and as the time passed their fear of pursuit and capture gave way to cold terror at the thought of being locked in this black, stifling vault to die.  What had happened? What did that shot mean, and where was it? Why did Florette not come? Who had walked across the plank roof of that musty prison? The fact that they could only guess at the time increased their dread and made their dreadful predicament the harder to bear. Moreover, the air was stale and insufficient and their heads began to ache cruelly.  \"We can't stand it in here much longer,\" Tom confessed, after what seemed a long period of waiting. \"Pretty soon one of us will be all in and then it'll be harder for the other. We've got to get out, no matter what.\"  \"Therre may be a Gerrman soldierr within ten feet of us now,\" Archer said. \"They'rre probably around in this vineyarrd _somewherre_, anyway. If we tried to forrce it open they'd hearr us.\"  \"We couldn't force it, anyway,\" Tom said.  \"My head's pounding like a hammerr,\" said Archer after a few minutes more of silence.  \"Hold some of that damp straw to it.--How many matches did she give you?\"  \"'Bout a dozen or so.\"  \"Wish I had a knife.--Have you got that piece of wire yet?\"  \"Surre I have,\" said Archer, hauling from his pocket about five inches of barbed wire--the treasured memento of his escape from the Hun prison camp. \"You laughed at me for always gettin' sooveneerrs; now you see---- What you want it for?\"  \"Sh-h. How many barbs has it?\" asked Tom in a cautious whisper.  \"Three.\"  \"Let's have it; give me a couple o' matches, too.\"  Holding a lighted match under the place where he thought the iron padlock band must be, he scrutinized the under side of the door for any sign of it.  \"I thought maybe the ends of the screws would show through,\" he said.  \"What's the idea?\" Archer asked. \"Gee, but my head's poundin'.\"  \"If that hasp just fell over the padlock eye,\" Tom whispered, \"and didn't fit in like it ought to, maybe if I could bore a hole right under it I could push it up. Don't get scared,\" he added impassively. \"There's another way, too; but it's a lot of work and it would make a noise. We'd just have to settle down and take turns and dig through with the wire barbs. I wish we had more matches. Don't get rattled, now. I know we're in a dickens of a hole----\"  \"You said something,\" observed Archer.  \"I didn't mean it for a joke,\" said Tom soberly.  \"This has got the trenches beat a mile,\" Archer said, somewhat encouraged by Tom's calmness and resourcefulness.  Striking another match, Tom examined more carefully the area of planking just in the middle of the side where he knew the hasp must be. He determined the exact center as nearly as he could. While doing this he dug his fingernails under a large splinter in the old planking and pulled it loose. Archer could not see what he was doing, and something deterred him from bothering his companion with questions.  For a while Tom breathed heavily on the splintered fragment. Then he tore one end of it until it was in shreds.  \"Let's have another match.\"  Igniting the shredded end, he blew it deftly until the solid wood was aflame, and by the light of it he could see that Archer was ghastly pale and almost on the point of collapse. Their dank, unwholesome refuge seemed the more dreadful for the light.  \"You got to just think about our getting out,\" Tom said, in his usual dull manner. \"We won't suffocate near so soon if we don't think about it, and don't get rattled. We _got_ to get out and so we _will_ get out. Let's have that wire.\"  All Archer's buoyancy was gone, but he tried to take heart from his comrade's stolid, frowning face and quiet demeanor.  \"We can set fire to the whole business if we have to,\" said Tom, \"so don't get rattled. We ain't going to die. Here, hold this.\"  Archer held the stick, blowing upon it, while Tom heated an end of the wire, holding the other end in some of the damp straw. As soon as it became red hot he poked it into the place he had selected above him. It took a long time and many heatings to burn a hole an eighth of an inch deep in the thick planking, and their task was not made the pleasanter by the thought that after all it was like taking a shot in the dark. It seemed like an hour, the piece of splintered wood was burned almost away, and what little temper there was in the malleable wire was quite gone from it, when Tom triumphantly pushed it through the hole.  \"Strike anything?\" Archer asked, in suspense.  \"No,\" said Tom, disappointed. He bent the wire and, as best he could, poked it around outside. \"I think I can feel it, though. Missed it by about an inch. There's no use getting discouraged. We'll just have to bore another one.\"  Long afterward, Archibald Archer often recalled the patience and doggedness which Tom displayed that night.  \"As long's the first hole has helped us to find something out, it's worth while, anyway,\" he said philosophically.  Resolutely he went to work again, like the traditional spider climbing the wall, heating the almost limp wire and by little burnings of a sixteenth of an inch or so at a time he succeeded in making another hole through the heavy planking. But this time the wire encountered a metallic obstruction. Sure enough, Tom could feel the troublesome hasp, but alas, the wire was now too limber to push it up.  \"I can just joggle it a little,\" he said, \"but it's too heavy for this wire.\"  However, by dint of doubling and twisting the wire, he succeeded after many attempts and innumerable straightenings of the wire,"]]]
