Against this summary verdict the observer sets the beast's industry, its talent as a weaver, its wiliness in the chase, its tragic nuptials and other characteristics of great interest.  Yes, the Spider is well worth studying, apart from any scientific reasons; but she is said to be poisonous and that is her crime and the primary cause of the repugnance wherewith she inspires us.  Poisonous, I agree, if by that we understand that the animal is armed with two fangs which cause the immediate death of the little victims which it catches; but there is a wide difference between killing a Midge and harming a man.  However immediate in its effects upon the insect entangled in the fatal web, the Spider's poison is not serious for us and causes less inconvenience than a Gnat-bite. That, at least, is what we can safely say as regards the great majority of the Spiders of our regions.  Nevertheless, a few are to be feared; and foremost among these is the Malmignatte, the terror of the Corsican peasantry.  I have seen her settle in the furrows, lay out her web and rush boldly at insects larger than herself; I have admired her garb of black velvet speckled with carmine-red; above all, I have heard most disquieting stories told about her.  Around Ajaccio and Bonifacio, her bite is reputed very dangerous, sometimes mortal.  The countryman declares this for a fact and the doctor does not always dare deny it.  In the neighbourhood of Pujaud, not far from Avignon, the harvesters speak with dread of _Theridion lugubre_, {1} first observed by Leon Dufour in the Catalonian mountains; according to them, her bite would lead to serious accidents.  The Italians have bestowed a bad reputation on the Tarantula, who produces convulsions and frenzied dances in the person stung by her.  To cope with 'tarantism,' the name given to the disease that follows on the bite of the Italian Spider, you must have recourse to music, the only efficacious remedy, so they tell us.  Special tunes have been noted, those quickest to afford relief.  There is medical choreography, medical music.  And have we not the tarantella, a lively and nimble dance, bequeathed to us perhaps by the healing art of the Calabrian peasant?  Must we take these queer things seriously or laugh at them?  From the little that I have seen, I hesitate to pronounce an opinion.  Nothing tells us that the bite of the Tarantula may not provoke, in weak and very impressionable people, a nervous disorder which music will relieve; nothing tells us that a profuse perspiration, resulting from a very energetic dance, is not likely to diminish the discomfort by diminishing the cause of the ailment.  So far from laughing, I reflect and enquire, when the Calabrian peasant talks to me of his Tarantula, the Pujaud reaper of his _Theridion lugubre_, the Corsican husbandman of his Malmignatte.  Those Spiders might easily deserve, at least partly, their terrible reputation.  The most powerful Spider in my district, the Black-bellied Tarantula, will presently give us something to think about, in this connection.  It is not my business to discuss a medical point, I interest myself especially in matters of instinct; but, as the poison-fangs play a leading part in the huntress' manoeuvres of war, I shall speak of their effects by the way.  The habits of the Tarantula, her ambushes, her artifices, her methods of killing her prey: these constitute my subject. I will preface it with an account by Leon Dufour, {2} one of those accounts in which I used to delight and which did much to bring me into closer touch with the insect.  The Wizard of the Landes tells us of the ordinary Tarantula, that of the Calabrias, observed by him in Spain:     '_Lycosa tarantula_ by preference inhabits open places, dry, arid,    uncultivated places, exposed to the sun.  She lives generally--at    least when full-grown--in underground passages, regular burrows, which    she digs for herself.  These burrows are cylindrical; they are often    an inch in diameter and run into the ground to a depth of more than a    foot; but they are not perpendicular.  The inhabitant of this gut    proves that she is at the same time a skilful hunter and an able    engineer.  It was a question for her not only of constructing a deep    retreat that could hide her from the pursuit of her foes: she also had    to set up her observatory whence to watch for her prey and dart out    upon it.  The Tarantula provides for every contingency: the    underground passage, in fact, begins by being vertical, but, at four    or five inches from the surface, it bends at an obtuse angle, forms a    horizontal turning and then becomes perpendicular once more.  It is at    the elbow of this tunnel that the Tarantula posts herself as a    vigilant sentry and does not for a moment lose sight of the door of    her dwelling; it was there that, at the period when I was hunting her,    I used to see those eyes gleaming like diamonds, bright as a cat's    eyes in the dark.     'The outer orifice of the Tarantula's burrow is usually surmounted by    a shaft constructed throughout by herself.  It is a genuine work of    architecture, standing as much as an inch above the ground and    sometimes two inches in diameter, so that it is wider than the burrow    itself.  This last circumstance, which seems to have been calculated    by the industrious Spider, lends itself admirably to the necessary    extension of the legs at the moment when the prey is to be seized.  The    shaft is composed mainly of bits of dry wood joined by a little clay    and so artistically laid, one above the other, that they form the    scaffolding of a straight column, the inside of which is a hollow    cylinder.  The solidity of this tubular building, of this outwork, is    ensured above all by the fact that it is lined, upholstered within,    with a texture woven by the Lycosa's {3} spinnerets and continued    throughout the interior of the burrow.  It is easy to imagine how    useful this cleverly-manufactured lining must be for preventing    landslip or warping, for maintaining cleanliness and for helping her    claws to scale the fortress.     'I hinted that this outwork of the burrow was not there invariably; as    a matter of fact, I have often come across Tarantulas' holes without a    trace of it, perhaps because it had been accidentally destroyed by the    weather, or because the Lycosa may not always light upon the proper    building-materials, or, lastly, because architectural talent is    possibly declared only in individuals that have reached the final    stage, the period of perfection of their physical and intellectual    development.     'One thing is certain, that I have had numerous opportunities of    seeing these shafts, these out-works of the Tarantula's abode; they    remind me, on a larger scale, of the tubes of certain Caddis-worms.    The Arachnid had more than one object in view in constructing them:    she shelters her retreat from the floods; she protects it from the    fall of foreign bodies which, swept by the wind, might end by    obstructing it; lastly, she uses it as a snare by offering the Flies    and other insects whereon she feeds a projecting point to settle on.    Who shall tell us all the wiles employed by this clever and daring    huntress?     'Let us now say something about my rather diverting Tarantula-hunts.    The best season for them is the months of May and June.  The first    time that I lighted on this Spider's burrows and discovered that they    were inhabited by seeing her come to a point on the first floor of her    dwelling--the elbow which I have mentioned--I thought that I must    attack her by main force and pursue her relentlessly in order to    capture her; I spent whole hours in opening up the trench with a knife    a foot long by two inches wide, without meeting the Tarantula.  I    renewed the operation in other burrows, always with the same want of    success; I really wanted a pickaxe to achieve my object, but I was too    far from any kind of house.  I was obliged to change my plan of attack    and I resorted to craft.  Necessity, they say, is the mother of    invention.     'It occurred to me to take a stalk, topped with its spikelet, by way    of a bait, and to rub and move it gently at the orifice of the burrow.    I soon saw that the Lycosa's attention and desires were roused.    Attracted by the bait, she came with measured steps towards the    spikelet.  I withdrew it in good time a little outside the hole, so as    not to leave the animal time for reflexion; and the Spider suddenly,    with a rush, darted out of her dwelling, of which I hastened to close    the entrance.  The Tarantula, bewildered by her unaccustomed liberty,    was very awkward in evading my attempts at capture; and I compelled    her to enter a paper bag, which I closed without delay.     'Sometimes, suspecting the trap, or perhaps less pressed by hunger,    she would remain coy and motionless, at a slight distance from the    threshold, which she did not think it opportune to cross.  Her    patience outlasted mine.  In that case, I employed the following    tactics: after making sure of the Lycosa's position and the direction    of the tunnel, I drove a knife into it on the slant, so as to take the    animal in the rear and cut off its retreat by stopping up the burrow.    I seldom failed in my attempt, especially in soil that was not stony.    In these critical circumstances, either the Tarantula took fright and    deserted her lair for the open, or else she stubbornly remained with    her back to the blade.  I would then give a sudden jerk to the knife,    which flung both the earth and the Lycosa to a distance, enabling me    to capture her.  By employing this hunting-"]]]
