He was quite clearly to be seen in the moonlight. His thick, grey fur, that looked as if he was wrapped up to keep out the most terrible cold weather; his short, stumpy, big legs, and little sharp face with big bushy ears, could be seen as distinctly as in daylight. Dot had never seen one so near before, and she loved it at once, it looked so innocent and kind.  \"You dear little Native Bear!\" she exclaimed, at once stroking its head.  \"Am I a Native Bear?\" asked the animal in a meek voice. \"I never heard that before. I thought I was a Koala. I've always been told so, but of course one never knows oneself. What are you? Do you know?\"  \"I'm a little girl,\" replied Dot, proudly.  The Koala saw that Dot was proud, but as it didn't see any reason why she should be, it was not a bit afraid of her.  \"I never heard of one or saw one before,\" it said, simply. \"Do you burrow, or live in a tree?\"  \"I live at home,\" said Dot; but, wishing to be quite correct, she added, \"that is, when I am there.\"  \"Then, where are you now?\" asked the Koala, rather perplexed.  \"I'm not at home,\" replied Dot, not knowing how to make her position clear to the little animal.  \"Then you live where you don't live?\" said the Koala; \"where is it?\" and the little Bear looked quite unhappy in its attempt to understand what Dot meant.  \"I've lost it,\" said Dot. \"I don't know where it is.\"  \"You make my head feel empty,\" said the Koala, sadly. \"I live in the gum tree over there. Do you eat gum leaves?\"  \"No. When I'm at home I have milk, and bread, and eggs, and meat.\"  \"Dear me!\" said the Koala. \"They're all new to one. Is it far? I should like to see the trees they grow on. Please show me the way.\"  \"But I can't,\" said Dot; \"they don't grow on trees, and I don't know my way home. It's lost, you see.\"  \"I don't see,\" said the Native Bear. \"I never can see far at night, and not at all in daylight. That is why I came here. I saw your fur shining in the moonlight, and I couldn't make out what it was, so I came to see. If there is anything new to be seen, I must get a near view of it. I don't feel happy if I don't know all about it. Aren't you cold?\"  \"Yes, I am, a little, since my Kangaroo left me,\" Dot said.  \"Now you make my head feel empty again,\" said the Koala, plaintively. \"What has a Kangaroo got to do with your feeling cold? What have you done with your fur?\"  \"I never had any,\" said Dot, \"only these curls,\" and she touched her little head.  \"Then you ought to be black,\" argued the Koala. \"You're not the right colour. Only Blacks have no fur, but what they steal from the proper owners. Do you steal fur?\" it asked in an anxious voice.  \"How do they steal fur?\" asked Dot.  The Koala looked very miserable, and spoke with horror. \"They kill us with spears, and tear off our skins and wear them because their own skins are no good.\"  \"That's not stealing,\" said Dot; \"that's killing\"; and, although it seemed very difficult to make the little Bear understand, she explained, \"Stealing is taking away another person's things; and when a person is dead he hasn't anything belonging to him, so it's not stealing to take what belonged to him before, because it isn't his any longer--that is, if it doesn't belong to anyone else.\"  \"You make my head feel empty,\" complained the Koala. \"I'm sure you're all wrong; for an animal's skin and fur is his own, and it's his life's business to keep it whole. Everyone in the bush is trying to keep his skin whole, all day long, and all night too. Good gracious! what is the matter up there?\"  A terrible hullabaloo between a pair of Opossums up a neighbouring gum tree arrested the attention of both Dot and the Koala. Presently the sounds of snarling, spitting, and screaming ended, and an Opossum climbed out to the far end of a branch, where the moonlight shone on his grey fur like silver. There he remained snapping and barking disagreeable things to his mate, who climbed up to the topmost branch, and snarled and growled back equally unpleasant remarks.  \"Why don't you bring in gum leaves for to-morrow, instead of sleeping all day and half the night too?\" shouted the Opossum on the branch to his wife. \"You know I get hungry before daylight is over and hate going out in the light.\"  \"Get them yourself, you lazy loon!\" retorted the lady Opossum. \"If you disturb my dreams again this way, I'll make your fur fly.\"  \"Take care!\" barked back her husband, \"or I'll bring you off that branch pretty quickly.\"  \"You'd better try!\" sneered his wife. \"Remember how I landed you into the billabong the other night!\"  The taunt was too much for the Opossum on the branch; he scuttled up the tree to reach his mate, who sprang forward from her perch into the air. Dot saw her spring with her legs all spread out, so that the skinny flaps were like furry wings. By this means she was able to break her fall, and softly alighting on the earth, a moment after, she had scrambled up another tree, followed by her mate. From tree to tree, from branch to branch, they fled or pursued one another, with growls, screams, and splutters, until they disappeared from sight.  \"How unhappy those poor Opossums must be, living in the same tree,\" said Dot; \"why don't they live in different trees?\"  \"They wouldn't be happy,\" observed the Koala, \"they are so fond of one another.\"  \"Then why do they quarrel?\" asked Dot.  \"Because they live in the same tree of course,\" said the Koala. \"If they lived in different trees, and never quarrelled, they wouldn't like it at all. They'd find life dull, and they'd get sulky. There's nothing worse than a sulky 'possum. They are champions at that.\"  \"They make a dreadful noise with their quarrelling,\" said Dot. \"They are nearly as bad as the Flying Foxes over there. I wonder if they made that fearful sound I heard just before you came?\"  [Illustration: DOT, THE NATIVE BEAR, AND THE OPOSSUM]  \"I expect what you heard was from me,\" said the Koala; \"I had just awakened, and when I saw the moon was up I felt pleased.\"  \"Was all that sound and many noises yours?\" asked Dot with astonishment, as she regarded the shaggy little animal on the tree trunk.  The Koala smiled modestly. \"Yes!\" it said; \"when I'm pleased there is no creature in the bush can make such a noise, or so many different noises at once. I waken everyone for a quarter of a mile round. You wouldn't think it, to see me as I am, would you?\" The Koala was evidently very pleased with this accomplishment.  \"It isn't kind of you to wake up all the sleeping creatures,\" said Dot.  \"Why not?\" asked the Koala. \"You are a night creature, I suppose, or you wouldn't be awake now. Well, don't you think it unfair the way everything is arranged for the day creatures?\"  \"But then,\" said Dot, \"there are so many more day creatures.\"  \"That doesn't make any difference,\" observed the Koala.  \"But it does,\" said Dot.  \"How?\" asked the Native Bear.  \"Because if you had the day it wouldn't be any good to you, and if they had the night it wouldn't be any good to them. So your night couldn't be their day, and their day couldn't be your night.\"  \"You make my head feel empty,\" said the Koala. \"But you'd think differently if a flock of Kookooburras settled on your tree, and guffawed idiotically when you wanted to sleep.\"  \"As you don't like being waked yourself, why do you wake others then?\" asked Dot.  \"Because this is a free country,\" said the Koala. While Dot was trying to understand why the Koala's reason should suffice for one animal making another's life uncomfortable, she was rejoiced to see the Kangaroo bound into sight. She forgot all about the Koala, and rushed forward to meet it.     CHAPTER VII   \"I'm so glad you've come back!\" she exclaimed.  The Kangaroo was a little breathless and excited. \"We are not in danger at present,\" she said, \"but one never knows when one will be, so we must move; and that will be more dangerous than staying where we are.\"  \"Then let us stay,\" said Dot.  \"That won't do,\" replied the Kangaroo. \"This is the conclusion I have jumped to. If we stay here, the Blacks might come this way and their dingo dogs hunt us to death. To get to a safe place we must pass their camp. That is a little risky, but we must go that way. We can do this easily if the dogs don't get scent of us, as all the Blacks are prancing about and making a noise, having a kind of game in fact, and they are so amused that we ought to get past quite safely. I've done it many times before at night.\"  Dot looked round to say good-bye to the Koala, but the little animal had heard the Kangaroo speak of Blacks, and that word suggested to its empty little head that it must keep its skin whole, so, without waiting to be polite to Dot, it had sneaked up its gum tree and was well out of sight.  Without wasting time, Dot settled in the Kangaroo's pouch, and they started upon their perilous way.  For some distance the Kangaroo hopped along boldly, with an occasional warning to Dot to shut her eyes as they plunged through the bushes; but after crossing a watercourse, and climbing a stiff hill, she whispered that they must both keep quite silent, and told Dot to listen as she stopped for a moment.  Dot could hear to their right a murmuring of voices, and a steady beating sound. \"Their camp is over there,\" said the Kangaroo, \"that is the sound of their game.\"  \"Can't we go some other way?\" asked Dot. \"No,\" answered the Kangaroo, \"because past that place we can reach some very wild country where it would be hard for them to pursue us. We shall have to pass quite close to their playground.\" So in perfect silence they went on.  [Illustration: THE CORROBOREE]  The Kangaroo seemed to Dot to approach the whereabouts of the Blackfellows as cautiously as when they had visited the water-hole the first night.

The object of this series of text-books is to provide concise teachable histories of art for class-room use in schools and colleges. The limited time given to the study of art in the average educational institution has not only dictated the condensed style of the volumes, but has limited their scope of matter to the general features of art history. Archæological discussions on special subjects and æsthetic theories have been avoided. The main facts of history as settled by the best authorities are given. If the reader choose to enter into particulars the bibliography cited at the head of each chapter will be found helpful. Illustrations have been introduced as sight-help to the text, and, to avoid repetition, abbreviations have been used wherever practicable. The enumeration of the principal extant works of an artist, school, or period, and where they may be found, which follows each chapter, may be serviceable not only as a summary of individual or school achievement, but for reference by travelling students in Europe.  This volume on painting, the first of the series, omits mention of such work in Arabic, Indian, Chinese, and Persian art as may come properly under the head of Ornament--a subject proposed for separate treatment hereafter. In treating of individual painters it has been thought best to give a short critical estimate of the man and his rank among the painters of his time rather than the detailed facts of his life. Students who wish accounts of the lives of the painters should use Vasari, Larousse, and the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ in connection with this text-book.  Acknowledgments are made to the respective publishers of Woltmann and Woermann's History of Painting, and the fine series of art histories by Perrot and Chipiez, for permission to reproduce some few illustrations from these publications.
