Did you make a report of your voyage home, Lieutenant Passford?\" continued the captain, pointing at Corny.  \"I did, sir; for we captured a privateer on the voyage,\" answered Corny.  \"Did you keep a copy of that report?\"  \"I did, captain; I keep copies of all my reports. I have them in my valise,\" answered he of the South in a matter-of-fact manner.  Christy laughed in spite of the importance of the investigation at the coolness and self-possession of his cousin; but he could not understand how Corny would be able to produce a copy of his report, which was in his valise with several such papers.  \"I must trouble you to produce it, Lieutenant Passford,\" added the commander.  \"Perhaps I ought to say in the beginning that it is not in my own handwriting, for after I had written it, Mr. Jones copied it for me,\" Corny explained, and, perhaps, thought he might be called upon to give a specimen of his chirography.  \"That is immaterial,\" added Captain Battleton, as Corny left the cabin to procure the document. \"Have you a copy of your report, Lieutenant Passford?\" He pointed to Christy.  \"I have, captain; and it is in my own handwriting,\" replied the officer addressed.  \"Produce it, if you please.\"  He had placed his valise in the gangway, and he had not far to go to procure the report, his first draft of the document, which he had revised and copied at Bonnydale.  \"I don't think we are getting ahead at all, Mr. Salisbury,\" said the captain, while the cousins were looking for their reports.  \"I confess that I am as much in the dark as I was in the beginning,\" replied the executive officer.  \"I can make nothing of it,\" added the surgeon. \"It looks to me as though the commission alone would have to settle this matter.\"  \"I don't see how I can go behind the official documents,\" replied the commander as Corny presented himself at the door.  A minute later Christy appeared with his report in his hand, and both of them were presented to the captain. The handwriting was as different as possible in the two papers. Corny's was in a large, coarse hand, but it was a fair copy, while Christy's contained several corrections and inter-lineations. No one could recognize the writing of either of the claimants, and the documents proved nothing at all. The captain was evidently weary of the investigation, and nothing but the commission seemed to throw any reliable light upon the claim of either one or the other.  \"Any further questions, Mr. Salisbury?\" asked the captain, bestowing a bored look upon the executive officer.  \"Nothing more, Captain Battleton.\"  \"Dr. Connelly?\"  \"Nothing, captain.\"  \"Now, gentlemen, I will thank you to retire to the ward room, and I will send for you to hear my decision,\" continued the commander, and the cousins retired together, and both of them appeared to be as good-natured as though they were in perfect accord on the question in dispute.  \"What is your opinion, Mr. Salisbury?\" asked the captain, when the claimants had retired, careful not to indicate his own conclusion.  \"While I acknowledge that I am somewhat prepossessed in favor of the Lieutenant Passford who came on board this morning, I do not think he has established his claim to be the true Lieutenant Christopher Passford. The other uses some peculiarly Southern phrases, as though he had been 'raised' in the South, and he is not perfect in the geography of Bonnydale. I think the commission is the only evidence upon which you can properly rely,\" replied the first lieutenant.  \"Your views, if you please, Dr. Connelly.\"  \"One of these officers is evidently a Confederate, and the other a loyal citizen. The commission, as Mr. Salisbury suggests, outweighs all the rest of the evidence. One or the other of the two men is an impostor, and without the commission, I should decide that my patient was the false Lieutenant Passford,\" answered the surgeon.  \"We appear to agree, gentlemen, for you have expressed my own views as well as I could state them myself,\" added the captain. \"But when I decide that the holder of the commission, which I am satisfied is a genuine document, is the loyal officer, and entitled to be received as the future commander of the Bronx, I must declare that the other is a Confederate; and not only that, but also that he is acting as a spy; that he is on board of the Vernon with mischievous intentions. It will be my duty to regard him as a prisoner of war, at least. What do you think of it, Mr. Salisbury?\"  \"I do not see how you can escape that conclusion,\" replied the first lieutenant.  \"I am a sort of peace officer,\" added Dr. Connelly, when the captain glanced at him, \"and I will express no opinion as to the status of the officer, though it appears to be as you describe it.\"  \"This is an informal conference, doctor, and I hope you will express your views freely,\" said the captain.  \"There is something in the situation which I cannot explain. I will only say that it is just possible there is a conspiracy at the bottom of the whole affair; and I should think it would be well to keep a close watch upon both of these officers. Why, on the voyage of the Bronx to the Gulf, Ensign Passford, as he was then, discovered two Confederate officers in his crew, and squarely defeated their efforts to capture his ship in the action with the Scotian, I believe it was.\"  \"I have heard of it; and in quite a number of instances, Confederates have been put on board of steamers for the purpose of taking them from their officers,\" added the captain. \"At the same time, I do not see that I can decide this question on any other evidence than that of the commission and other official documents.\"  Both of the other officers assented to this view, and the captain sent for the two claimants. Neither of them had spoken a word to the other during their stay in the ward room. Christy looked upon his cousin as a Confederate who was serving what he called his country, and he had not the slightest disposition to quarrel with him, and especially not to lead him to utter any unnecessary falsehoods. Possibly Corny was somewhat diffident about playing his assumed character before his cousin when they were alone, for they had always been the best of friends.  \"Gentlemen, I have come to a decision in this matter,\" said the captain, when the two claimants had placed themselves before him in a standing position. \"I cannot go behind the commission presented by the officer who came on board last evening, and I consider it my duty to regard him as the real Lieutenant Passford, recently promoted to his present rank. There is nothing more to be said.\"  \"Of course I expected that would be your decision,\" replied Corny, as he took the papers which the captain returned to him, including his commission and report.  \"You may retire now, if you please, Mr. Passford,\" added the commander.  Corny bowed politely to the officers at the table, and left the cabin. He did not even glance at Christy, and his face did not look like that of one who had just won a decided victory. Christy remained standing where he had placed himself; and he began to wonder what disposition would be made of him under present circumstances.     CHAPTER VIII  THE PRISONER OF WAR   After rendering his decision it was evident that Captain Battleton had something to say to Christy, for he waited in silence till Corny had closed the door behind him before he even looked at the officer standing before him. The lieutenant from the moment the envelopes were opened and their contents exposed to the view of all present, had fully expected the result just announced. Whatever he thought, suspected, or surmised when he saw the blank papers taken from his official envelope, he kept to himself.  \"You have heard the decision I have just given, Mr. Passford, for I have no doubt that is your real name,\" said the captain, when the cabin door was closed.  \"I have, captain,\" replied Christy, bowing respectfully.  \"Have you anything to say in regard to it?\"  \"Nothing at all,\" replied Christy, bowing again, and bearing himself with the dignity of a veteran officer; and in the matter of demeanor, the Confederate Captain Carboneer had presented to him one of the best models he had seen, both in action and as a prisoner.  \"You do not wish to make any explanation of the remarkable situation in which you find yourself placed at the present moment?\"  \"At present, I do not, captain.\"  \"You certainly could not have been aware that your official envelope contained only blank paper. I cannot believe that one more simple-minded than I believe you to be would have had the effrontery to present such matter as evidence that he was an officer of the United States Navy,\" continued Captain Battleton, with a look of greater severity than he had before assumed, possibly because he realized that the real Lieutenant Passford was higher in rank than he was himself.  \"I supposed the official envelope contained my commission and orders.\"  \"You believe that your papers were taken from you, and the blanks substituted for them?\"  \"I cannot explain the matter at present, and you must excuse me from offering merely vague suspicions and conjectures.\"  \"Do you realize your present situation, Mr. Passford?\" asked the captain, apparently disappointed at the unwillingness of the young man to attempt an explanation.  \"I think I do, captain, and I submit to your authority as the commander of the ship,\" answered Christy, with a dignified bow.  \"As I said before, I have no doubt you are a Passford; and I have been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18817"],["title","Ralestone Luck (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                                       RALESTONE LUCK                               By ANDRÉ NORTON                       _Author of_ The Prince Commands                          ILLUSTRATED BY JAMES REID   D.

CHAPTER I  THE RALESTONES COME HOME   \"Once upon a time two brave princes and a beautiful princess set out to make their fortunes--\" began the dark-haired, dark-eyed boy by the roadster.  \"Royalty is out of fashion,\" corrected Ricky Ralestone somewhat indifferently. \"Can't you do better than that?\" She gave her small, pert hat an exasperated tweak which brought the unoffending bowl-shaped bit of white felt into its proper position over her right eyebrow. \"How long does it take Rupert to ask a single simple question?\"  Her brother Val watched the gas gage on the instrument board of the roadster fluctuate wildly as the attendant of the station shook the hose to speed the flow of the last few drops. Five gallons--a dollar ten. Did he have that much? He began to assemble various small hoards of change from different pockets.  \"Do you think we're going to like this?\" Ricky waved her hand vaguely in a gesture which included a dilapidated hot-dog stand and a stretch of road white-hot under the steady baking of the sun.  \"Well, I think that Pirate's Haven is slightly different from our present surroundings. Where's your proper pride? Not everyone can be classed among the New Poor,\" Val observed judiciously.  \"Nobility in the bread line.\" His sister sniffed with what she fondly believed was the air of a Van Astor dowager.  \"Nobility?\"  \"We never relinquished the title, did we? Rupert's still the Marquess of Lorne.\"  \"After some two hundred years in America I am afraid that we would find ourselves strangers in England. And Lorne crumbled to dust long ago.\"  \"But he's still Marquess of Lorne,\" she persisted.  \"All right. And what does that make you?\"  \"Lady Richanda, of course, silly. Can't you remember the wording of the old charter? And you're Viscount--\"  \"Wrong there,\" Val corrected her. \"I'm only a lord, by courtesy, unless we can bash Rupert on the head some dark night and chuck him into the bayou.\"  \"Lord Valerius.\" She rolled it upon her tongue. \"Marquess, Lady, and Lord Val, out to seek their fortunes. Pity we can't do it in the traditional family way.\"  \"But we can't, you know,\" he protested laughingly. \"I believe that piracy is no longer looked upon with favor by the more solid members of any community. Though plank-walking is an idea to keep in mind when the bill collectors start to draw in upon us.\"  \"Here comes Rupert at last. Rupert,\" she raised her voice as their elder brother opened the door by the driver's seat, \"shall we all go and be pirates? Val has some lovely gory ideas.\"  \"Not just yet anyway--we still have a roof over our heads,\" he answered as he slid in behind the wheel. \"We should have taken the right turn a mile back.\"  \"Bother!\" Ricky surveyed as much of her face as she could see in the postage-stamp mirror of her compact. \"I don't think I'm going to like Louisiana.\"  \"Maybe Louisiana won't care for you either,\" Val offered slyly. \"After all, we dyed-in-the-wool Yanks coming to live in the deep South--\"  \"Speak for yourself, Val Ralestone.\" She applied a puff carefully to the tip of her upturned nose. \"Since we've got this barn of a place on our hands, we might as well live in it. Too bad you couldn't have persuaded our artist tenant to sign another lease, Rupert.\"  \"He's gone to spend a year in Italy. The place is in fairly good condition though. LeFleur said that as long as we don't use the left wing and close off the state bedrooms, we can manage nicely.\"  \"State bedrooms--\" Val drew a deep breath which was meant to be one of reverence but which turned into a sneeze as the roadster's wheels raised the dust. \"How does it feel to own such magnificence, Rupert?\"  \"Not so good,\" he replied honestly. \"A house as big as Pirate's Haven is a burden if you don't have the cash to keep it up properly. Though this artist chap did make a lot of improvements on his own.\"  \"But think of the Long Hall--\" began Ricky, rolling her eyes heavenward.  \"And just what do you know about the Long Hall?\" demanded Rupert.  \"Why, that's where dear Great-great-uncle Rick's ghost is supposed to walk, isn't it?\" she asked innocently. \"I hope that our late tenant didn't scare him away. It gives one such a blue-blooded feeling to think of having an active ghost on the premises. A member of one's own family, too!\"  \"Sure. Teach him--or it--some parlor tricks and we'll show it--or him--off every afternoon between three and four. We might even be able to charge admission and recoup the family fortune,\" Val suggested brightly.  \"Have you no reverence?\" demanded his sister. \"And besides, ghosts only walk at night.\"  \"Now that's something we'll have to investigate,\" Val interrupted her. \"Do ghosts have union rules? I mean, I wouldn't want Great-great-uncle Rick to march up and down the carriage drive with a sign reading, 'The Ralestones are unfair to ghosts,' or anything like that.\"  \"We'll have to use the Long Hall, of course,\" cut in Rupert, as usual ignoring their nonsense. \"And the old summer drawing-room. But we can shut up the dining-room and the ball-room. We'll eat in the kitchen, and that and a bedroom apiece--\"  \"I suppose there are bathrooms, or at least a bathroom,\" his brother interrupted. \"Because I don't care to rush down to the bayou for a good brisk plunge every time I get my face dirty.\"  \"Harrison put in a bathroom at his own expense last fall.\"  \"For which blessed be the name of Harrison. If he hadn't gone to Italy, he would have rebuilt the house. How soon do we get there? This touring is not what I thought it might be--\"  The crease which had appeared so recently between Rupert's eyes deepened.  \"Leg hurt, Val?\" he asked quietly, glancing at the slim figure sharing his seat.  \"No. I'm expressing curiosity this time, old man, not just a whine. But if we're going to be this far off the main highway--\"  \"Oh, it's not far from the city road. We ought to be seeing the gate-posts any moment now.\"  \"Prophet!\" Ricky leaned forward between them. \"See there!\"  Two gray stone posts, as firmly planted by time as the avenue of live-oaks they headed, showed clearly in the afternoon light. And from the nearest, deep carven in the stone, a jagged-toothed skull, crowned and grinning, stared blankly at the three in the shabby car. Beneath it ran the insolent motto of an ancient and disreputable clan, \"What I want--I take!\"  \"This is the place all right--I recognize Joe there.\" Val pointed to the crest. \"Good old Joe, always laughing.\"  Ricky made a face. \"Horrid old thing. I don't see why we couldn't have had a swan or something nice to swank about.\"  \"But then the Lords of Lorne were hardly a nice lot in their prime,\" Val reminded her. \"Well, Rupert, let's see the rest.\"  The car followed a graveled drive between tall bushes which would have been the better for a pruning. Then the road made a sudden curve and they came out upon a crescent of lawn bordering upon a stone-paved terrace three steps above. And on the terrace stood the home a Ralestone had not set foot in for over fifty years--Pirate's Haven.  \"It looks--\" Ricky stared up, \"why, it looks just like the picture Mr. Harrison painted!\"  \"Which proves why he is now in Italy,\" Val returned. \"But he did capture it on canvas.\"  \"Gray stone--and those diamond-paned windows--and that squatty tower. But it isn't like a Southern home at all! It's some old, old place out of"]]]
