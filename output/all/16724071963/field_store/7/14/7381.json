They had seen it coming, but it had hurt just the same.  And so the days went by, and the breath of Spring grew heavier in the air, and the dandelions sprang up in the field down by the river, and tree blossoms littered the sidewalks, and the frogs began croaking in the marshes. When the frogs begin croaking it is time to think of camp.  But Tom Slade, late of the scouts, was ahead of the dandelions and the blossoms and the frogs, for on that very day of his talk with Roy, and while the three patrols were off on their shopping bee in the city, he went into Mr. Burton's private office and asked if he might talk to him about an idea he had.  \"Surest thing you know, Tommy,\" said his superior cheerily. \"You want to go to the North Pole now?\"  For Mr. Burton knew Tom of old.     CHAPTER XIV  THE REALLY HARD PART   \"Maybe you'll remember how you said this would just be a kind of an experiment, my starting to work again in the office, and maybe it would turn out to be better for me to go away in the country,\" said Tom.  \"Yes sir,\" said Mr. Burton, with prompt good nature intended to put Tom at his ease.  \"I was wondering if maybe you could keep a secret,\" Tom said.  \"Well, I could make a stab at it,\" Mr. Burton said, laughing.  \"Do you think Margaret could?\" Tom asked.  \"Oh, I dare say, but you know how girls are. What's the trouble?\"  \"I want to go away,\" Tom said; \"I can't do things right and I want to go away. I'm all the time forgetting.\"  \"I think you're doing fine,\" said Mr. Burton.  \"I want to go up to Temple Camp until I feel better,\" Tom said.  Mr. Burton scrutinized him shrewdly and pursed up his lips and said, \"Don't feel first rate, eh?\"  \"I get rattled awful easy and I don't remember things,\" Tom said. \"I want to go up to camp and stay all alone with Uncle Jeb, like you said I could if I wanted to.\"  Again Mr. Burton studied him thoughtfully, a little fearfully perhaps, and then he said, \"Well, I think perhaps that would be a very good thing, Tom. You remember that's what I thought in the first place. You made your own choice. How about the secret?\"  \"It isn't anything much, only I thought of something to do while I'm up there. I got to square myself. I gave the troop cabins to a troop out west----\"  \"Well, I was wondering about that, my boy; but I didn't want to say anything. You'll have Roy and Peewee and those other gladiators sitting on your neck, aren't you afraid?\"  \"They got no use for me now,\" Tom said.  \"Oh, nonsense. We'll straighten that out. You send a letter----\"  \"The scoutmaster of that troop out west is a friend of mine,\" said Tom, \"but I never knew it until this morning, when I got a letter from him. They think I did it because I knew it was him all the time and liked him better, but I don't care what they think as long as nobody loses anything; that's all I care about. So if you'd be willing,\" he continued in his dull, matter-of-fact way, as if he were asking permission to go across the street, \"I'd like to go up and stay at Temple Camp before the season opens and fell some of those trees on the new woods property and put up three cabins on the hill for Roy and the troop to use when they get there. I wouldn't want anybody to know I'm doing it.\"  \"What?\" said Mr. Burton.  \"I want to go up there and stay and put up three cabins,\" said Tom dully.  \"Humph,\" said Mr. Burton, sitting back and surveying him with amused and frank surprise. \"How about the difficulties?\"  \"That's the only thing,\" Tom said; \"I was thinking it all over, and the only difficulty I can think about is, would Margaret keep it a secret until the work is done, and you too. They think I'm not a scout any more, and I'm going to show them. If you think I can't do it, you ask Pete, the janitor. And if I straighten things out that way nobody'll get left, see? The hard part is really _your_ part--keeping still and making her keep still.\"  \"I see,\" said Mr. Burton, contemplating the stolid, almost expressionless face of Tom, and trying not to laugh outright.  \"My part is easy,\" said Tom.     CHAPTER XV  A LETTER FROM BARNARD   When Tom reached Temple Camp he found a letter awaiting him there. It was stuck up among the antlers of Uncle Jeb's moose head which hung in the old camp manager's cabin. He found Uncle Jeb alone in his glory, and mighty glad to see him.  It was characteristic of the old western scout and trapper whom Mr. Temple had brought from Arizona, that he was never surprised at anything. If a grizzly bear had wandered into camp it would not have ruffled him in the least. He would have surveyed it with calm, shrewd deliberation, taken his corncob pipe out of his mouth, knocked the ashes out of it, and proceeded to business. If the grizzly bear had been one of the large fraternity who believe in \"safety first\" he would have withdrawn immediately upon the ominous sound of old Uncle Jeb's pipe knocking against the nearest hard substance. Uncle Jeb, like Uncle Sam, moved slowly but very surely.  It was not altogether uncommon for some nature loving pilgrim to drop in at camp out of season, and such a one was always sure of that easy-going western welcome. But if all the kings and emperors in the world (or such few of them as are left) had dropped in at camp, Uncle Jeb Rushmore would have eyed them keenly, puffed some awful smoke at them, and said, \"Haow doo.\" He liked people, but he did not depend on them. The lake and the trees and the wild life talked to him, and as for human beings, he was always glad of their company.  It was also characteristic of Uncle Jeb that no adventurous enterprise, no foolhardy, daredevil scheme, ever caused him any astonishment. Mr. Burton, engrossed in a hundred and one matters of detail and routine had simply laughed at Tom's plan, and let him go to Temple Camp to discover its absurdity, and then benefit by the quiet life and fresh air. It would have been better if Tom had been sent up there long before. He had humored him by promising not to tell, and he was glad that this crazy notion about the cabins had given Tom the incentive to go. He had believed that Tom's unfortunate error could be made right by the romantic expedient of a postage stamp. Mr. Burton was not a scout. And Tom Slade was the queerest of all scouts.  So now Uncle Jeb removed his pipe from his mouth, and said, \"Reckoned you'd make a trip up, hey?\"  \"I'm going to stay here alone with you until the season opens,\" Tom said; \"I got shell-shocked. I ain't any good down there. I assigned our three cabins to a troop in Ohio. So I got to build three more and have 'em ready by August first. I'm going to build them on the hill.\"  \"Yer ain't cal'latin' on trimming yer timbers much are yer?\" Uncle Jeb asked, going straight to the practical aspects of Tom's plan.  \"I'm going to put them up just like the temporary cabins were when the camp first opened,\" Tom said.  \"Ye'll find some of them same logs under the pavilion,\" Uncle Jeb said; \"enough for two cabins, mebbe. Why doan't you put up four and let that Peewee kid hev one all by hisself?\"  \"Do you think I can do it in six weeks?\" Tom asked.  \"I've seed a Injun stockade throwed up in three days,\" Uncle Jeb answered. \"Me'n General Custer throwed up Fort Bendy in two nights; that wuz in Montanny. Th' Injuns thought we wuz gods from heaven. But we wuzn't no gods, as I told the general; leastways _I_ was'n, n'never wuz. But I had a sharp axe.  \"I knew I could do it,\" Tom said, \"but I wanted it to be a stunt, as you might say.\"  \"'Tain't no stunt,\" Uncle Jeb said. \"Who's writin' yer from out in Ohio? I see the postmark. 'Tain't them kids from out Dayton way, I hope?\"  Tom opened the letter and read aloud:      DEAR TOM:      When I save a fellow's life I claim the right to call him by his     first name, even if I've never seen him. If anybody ever tells me     again that the world is a big place, I'll tell them it's about the     size of a shell-hole, no bigger, and that's small enough, as you and     I know. All I can say is, \"Well, well!\" And you're the same Thomas     Slade!      And the funny part of it is, we wouldn't know each other if we met     in the street. That's because we met in a shell-hole. I tried to     hunt you up along the line, made inquiries in the hospital at     Rheims, and tried to get a line on you from the Red Cross and     Y.M.C.A. Nothing doing. Somebody told me you were in the Flying     Corps. I guess I must have fainted while they were taking you away.     Anyway, when I woke up I was in a dressing station, trying to get my     breath. I asked what became of you and nobody seemed to know. One     said you were in the Messenger Service. When I left France I didn't     even know you were alive.      And now you turn up in Temple Camp office and tell me to write you     at Temple Camp. What are you doing up there before the season opens,     anyway? I bet you're there for your health.      Do you know what I'm thinking of doing? I'm thinking of making a     trip to camp and looking over our dug-outs and seeing what kind of a     place you have, before I bring my scouts. How would that strike you?     I've got three patrols and take it from me, they're a bigger job     than winning the war. They're all crazy for August first to arrive.      Well, Tommy old boy, I'm glad I've met you at last. I have a hunch     you're kind of tall, with gray eyes and curly hair. Am I right? I'm     about medium height and very handsome. Hair red--to suggest the     camp-fire.      I don't know whether my scouts will let me off for a week or two,     but my boss wants me to take a good rest before I knuckle down to     work. I'm off for August anyway. Don't expect me before that, but if     I should show up on a surprise raid, don't drop dead. I may go over     the top some fine day and drop in on you like a hand grenade. Are     you there all alone?      Write me again and let's get"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18943"],["title","Tom Slade at Black Lake (#8)"],["body","ed. I'd send you a photo, only     I gave my girl the last one I had.                                                  So long,                                              BILLY BARNARD,                                                    Scoutmaster.     CHAPTER XVI  THE EPISODE IN FRANCE   Uncle Jeb smoked his pipe leisurely, listening to this letter. \"Kind of a comic, hey?\" he said. \"I reckon ye'd like to hev 'em come. Hain't never seed each other, hey?\"  Tom was silent. The letter meant more to him than Uncle Jeb imagined. It touched one of the springs of his simple, stolid nature, and his eyes glistened as he glanced over it again, drinking in its genial, friendly, familiar tone. So he had at least one friend after all. Cut of all that turmoil of war, with its dangers and sufferings, had come at least one friend. The bursting of that shell which had seemed to shake the earth, and which had shattered his nerves and lost him Roy and all those treasured friends and comrades of his boyhood, had at least brought him one true friend. He had never felt the need of a friend more than at that very moment. The cheery letter seemed for the moment, to wipe out the memory of Roy's last words to him, that he was a liar. And it aroused his memories of France.  \"Maybe you might like to hear about it,\" he said to Uncle Jeb, in his simple way. \"Kind of, now it makes me think about France. I wouldn't blame the scouts for not having any use for me--I wouldn't blame Roy--but anyway, it was that shell that did it. If you say so I'll start a camp-fire. That's what always makes me think about the scouts--camp-fire. Maybe you'll say I was to blame. Anyway, they won't lose anything. And when they come I'll go back home, if they want me to. That's only fair. Anyway, I like Temple Camp best of all.\"  \"Kinder like home, Tommy,\" Uncle Jeb said.  The sun was going down beyond the hills across the lake and flickering up the water and casting a crimson glow upon the wooded summits. The empty cabins, and the boarded-up cooking shack, shone clear and sharp in the gathering twilight. High above, a great bird soared through the dusk, hastening to its home in the mountains, where Silver Fox trail wound its way up through the fastness, and where Tom and Roy had often gone. And the memory of all these fond associations gripped Tom now, and he had to tighten his big ugly mouth to keep it from showing any tremor of weakness.  \"Maybe it won't be as easy as Uncle Jeb thinks,\" he said to himself, \"but anyway, I'll be here and I won't be interfering with them, and I'll get the cabins finished and I'll go away before they come. They'll have to like Billy Barnard, that's sure; and maybe he'll tell them about my not knowing who he was until after I gave them the cabins. They'll all be on the hill together and they'll have to be friends....\"  Yes, they would all be on the hill together, save one, and they would be friends and there would be some great times. They would all hike up the mountain trail, all save one, and see Devil's Pool up there. Tom hoped that Roy would surely show Barnard and his troop that interesting discovery which he and Roy had made. The hard part was already attended to--making Margaret and Mr. Burton keep still. And, as usual, Lucky Luke's part was the easiest part of all--just building three cabins and going away. It was a cinch.  \"Shall I build a camp-fire?\" he asked of Uncle Jeb.  And so, in the waning twilight, Tom Slade, liar and forgetter of his friends, built a camp-fire, on this first night of his lonely sojourn at Temple Camp. And he and Uncle Jeb sat by it as the night drew on apace, and it aroused fond memories in Tom, as only a camp-fire has the magic to do, and stilled his jangling nerves and made him happy.  \"In about a month there'll be a hundred fellows sitting around one like this,\" he said.  \"En that Peewee kid'll be trying to defend hisself agin Roay's nonsense,\" Uncle Jeb remarked.  \"I ain't going to stay to be assistant camp manager this season,\" Tom said; \"I'm going back to work. I'm having my vacation now. I kind of like being alone with you.\"  \"What is them shell-holes?\" Uncle Jeb asked. \"Yer got catched into one, huh?\"  And then, for the first time since Tom had returned from France, he was moved to tell the episode which he had never told the scouts, and which he had always recalled with agitation and horror. Perhaps the camp-fire and Uncle Jeb's quiet friendliness lulled him to repose and made him reminiscent. Perhaps it was the letter from Barnard.  \"That's how I got shell-shocked,\" he repeated. \"When you get shell-shocked it doesn't show like a wound. There's a place named Veronnes in France. A German airman fell near there. It was pretty near dark and it was raining, but anyhow I could just see him fall. I could see him falling down through the dark, like. I was on my way back to the billets for relief. I had to go through a marsh to get to that place where he fell. I thought I'd sink, but I didn't.  \"When I got there I saw his machine was all crumbled up, and he was all mixed up with the wires and he was dead. I was going to give him first aid if he wasn't. But anyway, he was dead. So then I searched him and he had a lot of papers. Some of them were maps. I knew it wouldn't be any use to take them to billets, because the wires were all down on account of the rain. So I started through the marshes to get into the road to Rheims. Those marshes are worse than the ones we have here. Sometimes I had to swim. It took me two hours, I guess. Anyway, if you _have_ to do a thing you can do it.  \"When I got to the road it was easy. I knew that road went to Rheims because when I was in the Motorcycle Service I knew all the roads. Pretty soon I got to a place where a road crossed it and there were some soldiers coming along that road. I kept still and let them pass by and they didn't see me. I knew there were more coming and I could hear the sound of tanks coming, too. Maybe they were coming back from an attack.  \"All of a sudden everything seemed bright and I saw a fellow right close to me and then there was a noise that made my ears ring and dirt flew in my face and I heard that fellow yell. As soon as I took a couple more steps I stumbled and fell into a place that was hot--the earth was hot, just like an oven. That was a new shell-hole I was in.  \"I just lay there and my arm hurt and my ears buzzed and there was a funny kind of a pain in the back of my neck. That's how shell-shock begins. I heard that fellow say, 'Are you all right?' I couldn't speak because my throat was all trembling, like. But I could feel my sleeve was all wet and my arm throbbed. I heard him say, 'We must have had our fingers crossed.' Because you know how kids cross their fingers when they're playing tag, so no one can tag them? The way he says things in this letter sounds just like the way he said. He's happy-go-lucky, that fellow, I guess.  \"There was a piece of the shell in there and it was red hot and by that he saw my arm was hurt, and he bandaged it with his shirt. He saw my scout badge that I wore and he asked me my name. That's all he knows about me. Pretty soon something that made a lot of noise moved right over the hole and I guess it got stuck there. He said it must be a tank that got kind of caught there. Pretty soon I could hardly breathe, but I could hear him hollering and banging with a stone or something up against that thing. I heard him say we could dig our way out with his helmet. Pretty soon I didn't know anything.  \"The next thing I knew there was fresh air and people were carrying me on a stretcher. When I tried to call for that fellow it made me sob--that's the way it is when you're shell-shocked. You wring your hands, too. Even--even--now--if I hear a noise----\"  Tom Slade broke down, and began wringing his hands, and his face which shone in the firelight was one of abject terror. And in another moment he was crying like a baby.     CHAPTER XVII  ON THE LONG TRAIL   That night he bunked in Uncle Jeb's cabin, and slept as he had not slept in many a night. In the morning his stolid, stoical nature reasserted itself, and he set about his task with dogged determination. Uncle Jeb watched him keenly and a little puzzled, and helped him some, but Tom seemed to prefer to work alone. The old man knew nothing of that frightful malady of the great war; his own calm, keen eyes bespoke a disciplined and iron nerve. But his kindly instinct told him to make no further reference to the war, and so Tom found in him a helpful and sympathetic companion. Here at last, so it seemed, was the medicine that poor Tom needed, and he looked forward to their meals, and the quiet chats beside their lonely camp-fire, with ever-growing pleasure and solace.  He hauled out from under the porch of the main pavilion the logs which had been saved from the fire that had all but devastated the camp during its first season, and saved himself much labor thereby. These he wheeled up the hill one by one in a wheelbarrow. There were enough of these logs to make one cabin, all but the roof, and part of another one.  When Tom had got out the scout pioneer badge which Roy had noticed on him, it had been by way of defying time and hardship and proclaiming his faith in himself and his indomitable power of accomplishment. As the work progressed it became a sort of mania with him; he was engrossed in it, he lived in it and for it. He would right his wrong to the troop by scout methods if he tore down the whole forest and killed himself. That was Tom Slade.  Up on the new woods property, which included the side of the hill away from the camp, he felled such trees as he needed, hauling them up to the summit by means of a block and falls, where he trimmed them and notched them, and rolled or pried them up into place. At times whole days would be spent on that further slope of the hillside and Uncle Jeb, busy with preparations for the first arrivals, could not"]]]
