He had those papers--those simply invaluable papers!  And he was alarmed by two Belgian boys in Boy Scout uniform--thought they were soldiers coming to arrest him!  He took to his heels and naturally, being boys, they followed!  He dropped his papers going over a fence! When he missed them he went back.  But he found no trace of them.  He is sure that the two boys got them.\"  \"Donnerwetter!  That's a bad business, Froebel!  I fear for our friend Ridder!  The intelligence department will not be altogether pleased by this.  But what if the boys have them?  Is there a chance, do you think, that they will understand them?\"  \"Who knows?  Some devil might lead them to take them to a Belgian officer!  However--even so, there is this much of good about it.  There is no time for them to do anything.  They can't get at our gun platforms.  If they had a week!  But you say General von Emmich is already on the march?  That means that war has been declared?\"  \"No, only that it has begun,\" said Poertner, with a smile.  \"It is no longer the fashion to declare war formally---unless the enemy is like Russia with us--so far away that we can't strike first.  No.  The modern way is to begin fighting and let the other side declare war.  So they seem to take the aggressive.\"  \"I see,\" said Froebel.  \"Well, at any rate, it is the time I am thinking of.  They are fairly well prepared here at Liege.  The forts are in order; they have good men, and plenty of ammunition for their guns.  But against our Krupp pieces--\"  He laughed to express the chance that the stout forts of Liege were to have against the German artillery.  And outside Arthur, listening, ground his teeth.  He was glad that he had come; already he had learned facts likely to prove of the first importance.  No matter how well the garrison of Liege was prepared for any emergency, it would be vastly helpful to know when the blow might be expected to fall.  It is one thing to be prepared for a trouble that may come some day; it is quite another to know that it is imminent, and to make plans accordingly.  In Arthur's mind an idea now began to take root.  The voices of the two Germans inside died away, and he seized the opportunity to make his way quietly to the front of the cottage.  There, lying on its side, was the motorcycle of which the new arrival had spoken.  Arthur had ridden motorcycles himself, and now he went up to this one and examined it carefully.  He found that while it was different from the ones he had ridden, the points of difference were really trifling and that he could understand it easily enough.  Then he went back for another peep in the window.  The two German officers were busily engaged now in eating, and were washing down the sausage, amid a good deal of laughter at the rough fare, with two bottles of wine.  \"When we have finished,\" said Poertner, \"we will have a look at your little arsenal below.\"  \"It's a real arsenal,\" said Froebel, proudly.  \"That was rather well managed, I think.  We have managed to bring in the guns, one part at a time and the ammunition piecemeal, in the same way.  These stupid Belgians never even suspected.  It is only just lately that they have even begun to dream that there might be danger for them if it came to war.  Before they woke up everything was here!\"  \"Well, your guns will be at work before many hours if all goes well,\" said Poertner.  \"This sausage of yours is not so bad, after all!  Food is food when you are hungry!  Ah, it will be some time, at best, before we can eat again in Berlin, my friend!\"  \"Yes.  There will be garrison work, even after we have taken Paris. Still, even so, it should not be so long.  Three weeks perhaps--that should be enough to beat the French this time.  We are better prepared than we were in 1870.\"  \"So are they, I hear.  Well, they couldn't be worse off than they were then!  No matter, though--we shall outnumber them from the start.  Will the English fight, do you think?\"  \"Pah--the English!  No!  They will be too busy with their troubles at home.  They will have a rebellion on their hands in Ulster.  No, England will have too many troubles of her own at home, to be able to cross the sea to look for more.\"  Arthur had heard all he needed.  Now he drew back from the window, picking up several good-sized stones as he did so.  And when he was some distance away, but still able to see the two Germans, he stopped and waited.  He waited until the two officers had finished their meal and had risen. Even then he waited until they moved, together, to the trap door. Then, raising his arm, he let fly the first of his stones.  It crashed through the window, shattering the glass.  At once he threw another, and then still another.  He had counted, and not in vain, on the instinct that would move the two Germans.  With a single motion they leaped to the door.  As they did so, even as they rushed out, he ran diagonally, so as to get away from them, toward the front of the house. As they stormed around in the direction from which he had thrown the stones, and so out of sight of the front of the house, he stopped. They passed within half a dozen feet of him, but, naturally, they had not expected him to come right toward them, and they passed him unnoticed.  Then, as soon as they were out of sight, he made for the cottage.  He meant to call Paul.  But Paul was at the door as he reached it for he had understood, from what he had been able to hear, something of what had happened.  \"Come on!  Here's a motorcycle we can take!\" cried Arthur, eagerly.  He lifted the machine.  In a moment he had started the motor, and Paul leaped up behind him as he got it going.  \"Hurry!  Here they come!\" shouted Paul.  The put-put of the motor had aroused the Germans to what was going on. Now they stormed back around the cottage.  They were just in time to see the motorcycle being ridden madly off; in time, too, to fire a couple of shots apiece from their pistols.  But their aim was bad: the boys heard the bullets whistling over their heads.  In less than a minute they were safe!     CHAPTER V  PURSUIT  They had no thought of any further danger, as they sped along the road on the stolen--or, rather, the captured motorcycle.  The road was smooth and good.  There was nothing to detain them.  Behind them the furious shouts of the Germans, even the firing, died away, until the only sound they could hear was the noise of the engine.  The machine was a good one, evidently built for the hard work of an army in the field.  Before them now was the searchlight from Fort Boncelles, picking up one patch of darkness after another, flooding it suddenly with light, and then passing on to the next, swinging about endlessly in a great arc, so that the slightest movement that was out of the ordinary was sure to be seen.  From time to time the great beam of light struck the road, before them or behind them.  Then they were in the midst of it, riding in a sea of light.  The searchlight winked off, came back to them, and went with them for nearly half a mile.  \"They've spotted us, Arthur!\" said Paul, with a laugh.  \"Well, I hope they're not frightened!\"  \"They must want to make sure of what we're doing, I suppose, Paul! Look at the other lights!  It's a great sight when they all swing up together, isn't it?\"  From the forts that ringed the ancient city the darting searchlights swept the heavens.  At times all of them met, for a moment, making a blinding reflection against the sky.  They would stay thus; then, one after another, the lights would go swooping down, keeping their vigil. Behind each were watchful eyes, ready to report immediately the first, the slightest sign of what might come now at any moment.  \"Those searchlights make the idea of war seem more real than anything else has, Paul,\" said Arthur.  Paul gave a short laugh.  \"If you'd seen those shells and the parts of the guns, all ready to be put together in that cellar, you wouldn't say that!\" he exclaimed. \"And how about the German officer--in uniform, on the soil of a friendly country?  That's almost an act of war itself, Arthur!  He has no business here!\"  \"I don't see what difference it makes, Paul.  If they're coming, there'll be so many more that one more or less won't count.\"  \"Well, they're coming!  I'm more sure of that than ever since we found that house.  I say, Arthur, I think you'd better stay right out here in the road with the motorcycle, while I run in and get the plans.  If we both went, we might be caught--and I don't want to have to explain anything until we've told what we know to the staff officers.\"  \"All right, Paul.  But don't be long.\"  \"I won't!  Here we are!  Now you wait--and I'll get back just as soon as I can.\"  It was an easy matter, as it turned out, for Paul to slip into the grounds and retrieve the plans.  But it took time, and time, had he only known it, was the one thing he could not afford to waste just then.  Somehow neither he nor Arthur had given a further thought to the two Germans they had so cleverly eluded in the mysterious cottage. They had felt that these two enemies, at least, might be counted out for that night.  And so Paul, returning to the spot where he had left Arthur, took no particular pains to conceal himself.  He called out as he vaulted the low wall between the grounds of his uncle's place and the road.  \"It was easy!\" he cried.  \"No one was about.  They're probably so excited that they haven't even missed us yet!  Start your engine! We've got to hurry now.\"  Arthur tried to obey.  But there was some slight hitch in the starting of the engine.  Then the spark worked, and the motor began to throb. The cycle started; Paul leaped up to his place behind.  And then, behind them, came a sudden roar, the sound of another motorcycle, and a flash of light swept over them.  \"Stop!\" cried a voice--a voice they knew!  It was one of the Germans!  \"Go"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18838"],["title","The Belgians to the Front (#5)"],["body","!  Hurry!\" cried Paul.  \"Perhaps we can get away from them--we're ahead, anyhow!\"  The motorcycle leaped forward now, but from behind they could still hear the barking of the exhaust of the other machine, and the excited cries of the Germans.  Luck was with them, however, for just at that most critical of moments something must have gone wrong with the pursuing machine.  The noise of its motor ceased behind them.  The shouting continued, but only one voice was raised.  Plainly the other man was busy.  While their luck held, Arthur pushed the machine at the best speed he could get out of it.  And it was well that he did, since the trouble with the other motor was soon mended.  It sprang into sputtering life again behind them.  But now they had a good lead and were racing on toward the forts, toward the circle of wide swinging searchlights.   \"How are we getting on, Paul?\" asked Arthur.  \"Are we gaining?\"  \"I'm afraid--no, we're not.  They're coming along awfully fast.  That must be a much more powerful machine than this.\"  \"I don't think it's that.  I'm awfully afraid that our gasoline is running low!  That German must have ridden a long way.  Probably he expected to fill his tank back there!  There's so much noise that I'm not sure, but I'm afraid one cylinder is missing.  That's what is making us slower.\"  Over their heads now a bullet sang out sharply.  There could be no doubt about it at all, now; the other motorcycle was rapidly making up lost ground.  Then while they still raced on, and when the other machine was less than a hundred yards behind, the whole road was paved in light again, as the Boncelles searchlight swung around and down, and was focused full on the chase.  Still the other cycle gained, but there were no more shots.  The reason for that was made plain in a few moments by a call to surrender.  \"They're only boys!\" one of the Germans had yelled to the other.  \"We can catch them.  Don't let's hurt them.\"  And then, with the distance between the two machines being reduced every minute, they could hear one of the Germans shouting to them.  \"Stop!  Surrender!\" he cried.  \"You can't escape--we're gaining all the time!  If you stop now, you won't be hurt!\"  Then the searchlight swung away, and in that same moment Paul had an inspiration.  He remembered that in his pocket was a glass flask that had contained water.  He took this out now, and broke it against the steel frame of the motorcycle.  The fragments cut his fingers, but he ignored the cuts and the flow of blood.  At the risk of hurting himself still more, he broke the fragments again in his hand.  Then he began dropping the sharp pieces of glass.  And in a minute he had his reward. From behind came two sharp explosions, and looking back, he saw the other motorcycle swerve and fall.  The two riders went sprawling.  \"Get all you can out of her, Arthur!\" he shouted.  \"I spilled them. The glass punctured both their tires!  That was luck!  It won't stop them for long, but it's given us a little more time.  I don't believe they'll put on new tires, even if they're carrying them.  And if they don't, it will make them much slower.  You can't go so fast on rims as you can on rubber tires!\"  \"That was fine!  I never thought of doing that!\" exclaimed Arthur.  \"I do believe it's going to save us, too.  We can't be more than a mile and a half from Boncelles now.\"  \"We'll get there--unless our gasoline gives out altogether before that, Arthur.  And it may.  The engine is certainly missing all the time, now.  Oh, if it will only hold out!\"  Their speed was greatly reduced now.  And from behind the other motor started again.  \"I admire those Germans!\" said Paul.  \"A good many people wouldn't keep at it the way they're doing.  It's no joke to ride on a motorcycle with both tires gone.  They'll remember to-night for some time, I think! They'll be sore and shaken to pieces before they're done.\"  \"They'll be better off than their machine,\" said Arthur, philosophically.  \"There won't be enough of that left to sell for junk if they ride it very far in that condition.\"  \"Well, I don't believe they'll care about that, if they only catch us and get the plans--\"  It was a sudden lurch of the machine, accompanied by a sputtering and a stopping of the motor, that interrupted him.  The two scouts sprang off just in time, steadying the machine.  \"Drop it!  Into the fields here!\" cried Paul.  \"We can't run any longer.  We must try to elude them by tricking them.  Come on!\"  And so they were obliged to abandon the machine that had served them so well, leaving it lying in the road.  They ran across a ditch that bordered the road, and into a field where they managed to conceal themselves in a hedge.  They could still see the white road, and the collapsed motorcycle, but there was a chance, even if it was a slim one, that they themselves would not be seen.  Arthur wanted to run across the field, but Paul stopped him.  \"That's what they'll expect us to do, isn't it?\" he said.  \"And, besides, they could see us.  There's no shelter for a long way.  Here they may overlook us, just because we're so close--and it's the only chance we have, anyhow.\"  \"Here they come!\" cried Arthur, and crouched down, staring.  For a moment it seemed that the pursuers might ride straight by, and Paul groaned suddenly.  \"We ought to have dragged the machine in here with us!\" he said.  \"Then I don't believe they'd have known we had stopped for quite a distance! I never thought of it, though, and now it's too late!\"  It was too late, indeed, for the other machine stopped within a few feet of the overturned cycle.  \"Ha!  Now we'll have them!  They can't have gone far!\" said one of the Germans.  \"Accursed boys!  They have given me a fright!\"  \"You haven't caught us yet!\" whispered Paul, defiantly.  It was true, as the Germans soon discovered.  For when they began looking for the two boys, they found that it was one thing to know that they must be somewhere about, and quite another to find out just where. They did not begin to look immediately in the field, but went along the road, toward Liege, evidently looking for footprints.  Then when they did take to the field, they crossed the ditch fully a hundred yards further along the road.  \"Come on!\" said Paul, suddenly.  \"We got one of their machines--why shouldn't we take the other?\"  Arthur saw the point as quickly as Paul.  The carelessness of the two Germans had once more given them an opportunity.  In a moment they dashed out, and, just as the Germans, with a yell of fury, saw them, they were off.  Bullets flew about them, but they bent low over the machine, and they were going fast.  Still two bullets found their mark, one puncturing the rear tire, the other perforating the gasoline tank. Once more they seemed to be caught.  And then a searchlight swept down upon them again.  But this time it was not the great light from Boncelles.  It was the huge headlight of an automobile, and behind it they saw an armored car.  Soldiers sprang from it, and in a moment the tables had been completely turned.  It was the two German officers who were made prisoners, while officers eagerly pressed about the scouts, asking question upon question.  \"I must be taken to General Leman at once,\" said Paul, stoutly.  \"We have information of the utmost importance.\"  The Belgian officers laughed at him at first.  But he was so earnest and persistent that he had his way at last.     CHAPTER VI  AT HEADQUARTERS  The armored automobile, a queer looking affair with its machine guns and its steel parapets, pierced with holes through which rifles could be fired, made good time on the way back to Liege.  It was really a fairly large motor lorry, converted very readily from a commercial use to its new purpose, and even the untrained eyes of the two scouts could see that it was likely to prove a formidable weapon in time of war.  \"It would take a heavy gun to stop it.  Rifle fire wouldn't bother us at all, you see,\" explained one of the Belgian officers.  \"Even the driver is thoroughly protected, because he could only be shot from above.  I expect we'll have a lot of use for these.\"  \"Are there many of them?\"  \"Not so many here.  We don't need them.  But at Brussels, where the field army is being mobilized now, there are a lot, and all through the open country where there will probably be a good deal of fighting.\"  \"Will the Germans get so far?\"  \"They're sure to.  We'll hold Liege with a small force as long as we can.  But you must remember that they can send a million men against us!  We're not supposed to beat them--no one expects us to do that. All we have to do is to hold them back as long as possible.\"  \"But if there are so many of them, why can't they go right around us here?\"  \"They can, and they probably will.  But even so, they'll have to account for the fortress of Liege and of Namur, as well, before they can get so very far.\"  \"That's what I don't quite understand,\" said Arthur.  \"It seems to me that unless we have soldiers enough here to stop them they could go right on without bothering about Liege at all.\"  \"You haven't studied strategy yet, I can see, my scout!\" said the officer, with a laugh.  \"But I'll try to explain.  You see, the Germans want to reach France--to conquer the French army and capture Paris, as they did in 1870.  Then they went right through Alsace and Lorraine--beat the French around Metz, locked up the beaten army in that fortress, beat the only other army France had and captured it at Sedan, and then walked right through to Paris.\"  \"Yes, I've read of that,\" said Arthur.  \"They didn't go through Belgium then, either.\"  \"They didn't have to.  But since then, you see, the French have learned their lesson.  They've got the most powerful fortified line in the world, I suppose, all the way from Belfort to Verdun.  It would take the Germans weeks to break through there, and by that time the whole French army would be mobilized behind that line of"]]]
