And if I'm to unpick the blue muslin curtains, and take them down from where they was hung by my late blessed mistress's orders, in the spare room, and to fit them into the primrose room over the porch--for she says there's a Miss Virginy and a Master Paul coming, and the primrose room with the blue curtains is for one of them, she says. And I want to know from you, please, Doctor, if Miss Polly is to mistress it over me? And to take away the keys of the linen-press from me, and to follow me round, and to upset all my work, what I never stood, nor would stand. I want to know if it's your wish, Doctor?\"  \"The fact is, Alice,\" began the Doctor--he put his hand to his brow, and a dim look came over his eyes--\"the fact is--ah, that is my patients' bell, I must ask you to go, Alice, and to--to moderate your feelings. I have been anxious to give Miss Polly a lesson in experience, and it is only for a week. You will oblige me very much, Alice, by helping me in this matter.\"  The Doctor walked to the door as he spoke, and opened it courteously.  \"Come in, Johnson,\" he said, to a ruddy-faced farmer, who was accompanied by a shy boy with a swelled face. \"Come in; glad to see you, my friend. Is Tommy's toothache better?\"  Alice said afterwards that she never felt smaller in her life than when Dr. Maybright opened the study door to show her out.  \"Ef I'd been a queen he couldn't have done it more elegant,\" she remarked. \"Eh, but he's a blessed man, and one would put up with two Miss Pollys for the sake of serving him.\"  The Doctor having conquered Alice, again forgot his second daughter's vagaries, but a much sterner and more formidable interview was in store for him; it was one thing to conquer Alice, who was impressionable, and had a soft heart, and another to encounter the stony visage and rather awful presence of Mrs. Power.  \"It's to give notice I've come, Dr. Maybright,\" she said, dropping a curtsey, and twisting a corner of her large white apron round with one formidable red hand. \"It's to give notice. This day month, please, Doctor, and, though I says it as shouldn't, you won't get no one else to jelly your soups, nor feather your potatoes, nor puff your pastry, as Jane Power has done. But there's limits, Dr. Maybright; and I has come to give you notice, though out of no disrespect to you, sir.\"  \"Then why do you do it, Mrs. Power?\" said the Doctor. \"You are an honest and conscientious servant, I know that from your late mistress's testimony. You cook very good dinners too, and you make suitable puddings for the children, and pastry not too rich. Why do you want to leave? I don't like change; and, if it is a question of wages, perhaps I may be able to meet you.\"  \"I'm obligated to you, Doctor; but it ain't that. I has my twenty-two pounds paid regular, and all found. I ain't grumbling on that score, and Jane Power was never havaricious nor grasping. I'm obligated too by what you says with respect to the pastry; but, Doctor, it ain't in mortal woman to stand a chit of a child being put over her. So I'm going this day month; and, with your leave, I'll turn the key in the kitchen-door next week, or else I'll forfeit my wage and go at once.\"  \"Dear, dear,\" said the Doctor. \"This is really embarrassing. I never thought that Polly's experience would upset the household economy in so marked a manner. I am really annoyed, for I certainly gave her leave to housekeep for a week.\"  \"It isn't as I minds youth, Dr. Maybright,\" continued Mrs. Power. \"I makes due allowances for the young, for I says to myself, 'Jane Power, you was once, so to speak, like an unfledged chick yourself;' but there's youth _and_ youth, Dr. Maybright; and Miss Polly's of the kind as makes your 'air stand on hend.\"  \"Poor Polly,\" said the Doctor.  \"No, sir, begging your parding, if you was in the kitchen, it's 'poor Mrs. Power' you'd be a-saying. Now I don't say nothing agin Miss Nelly--she's the elder, and she have nice ways with her--she takes a little bit after my poor dear mistress; oh, what a nature was hers, blessed angel!\"  Here Mrs. Power rolled her eyes skywards, and the Doctor, turning his back, walked to the window.  \"Be brief,\" he said, \"I am pressed for time.\"  \"Sir, I was never one for long words; agen' Miss Helen I haven't a word to say. She comes down to the kitchen after breakfast as pretty as you please, and she says, 'Power,' says she, 'you'll advise me about the dinner to-day,' says she. 'Shall we have minced collops, or roast beef? And shall we have fruit tart with custard?' Pretty dear, she don't know nothink, and she owns it, and I counsel her, as who that wasn't the most hard-hearted would. But Miss Polly, she's all on wires like, and she bounds in and she says that I pepper the soup too strong, and that I ought to go to cookery schools, and ef I'll go with her that blessed minit she'll tell me what I wants in my own store-room. There's limits. Dr. Maybright, and Miss Polly's my limits; so, ef you'll have no objection, sir, I'll go this day month.\"  \"But I have an objection,\" replied Dr. Maybright. \"Even Polly's experiment must not cost me a valuable servant. Mrs. Power, I have promised my little girl, and I feel more than convinced that her week's trial will ensure to you the freedom you desire and deserve in the future. Listen, I have a plan. Suppose you go for a week's holiday on Monday?\"  \"Oh, my word, sir! And are you to be poisoned hout and hout?\"  \"That is unlikely. Maggie, your kitchen-maid, is fond of cooking, and she won't quarrel with Miss Polly. Let us consider it arranged, then. A week's holiday won't do you any harm, cook, and your expenses I will defray. Now, excuse me, I must go out at once. The carriage has been at the door for some time.\"     CHAPTER X.  INDIGESTION WEEK.   It was quite early on the following Monday morning when a light tap was heard outside the door of the room where Helen and Polly slept. It was a very light, modest, and uncertain tap, and it has not the smallest effect upon Helen, who lay in soft slumber, her pretty eyes closed, her gentle face calm and rounded and child-like, and the softest breathing coming from her rosy, parted lips.  Another little girl, however, was not asleep. At that modest tap up sprang a curly head, two dark, bright eyes opened wide, two white feet sprang quickly but noiselessly on to the floor, and Polly had opened the bedroom door wide to admit the short, dumpy, but excited little person of Maggie, the kitchen-maid.  \"She's a-going, Miss Polly--she's a-packing her bandbox now, and putting the strap on. She's in a hawful temper, but she'll be out of the house in less than half an hour. There's a beautiful fire in the kitchen, Miss, and the pan for frying bacon is polished up so as you could 'most see yourself in it. And the egg-saucepan is there all 'andy, and the kettle fizzing and sputtering. I took cook up her breakfast, but she said she didn't want none of our poisonous messes, and she'd breakfast with her cousin in the village if we'd no objection. She'll be gone in no time now, Miss Polly, and I'm a-wanting to know when you'll be a-coming down stairs.\"  \"I'm going to dress immediately, Maggie,\" said Polly. \"I've scarcely slept all night, for this is an anxious moment for me. I'll join you in half an hour at the latest, Maggie, and have lots of saucepans and frying-pans and gridirons ready. Keep the fire well up too, and see that the oven is hot. There, fly away, I'll join you soon.\"  Maggie, who was only sixteen herself, almost skipped down the passage. After the iron reign of Mrs. Power, to work for Polly seemed like play to her.  \"She's a duck,\" she said to herself, \"a real cozy duck of a young lady. Oh, my word, won't we spin through the stores this week! Won't we just!\"  Meanwhile Polly was hastily getting into her clothes. She did not wish to wake Helen, for she was most anxious that no one should know that on the first morning of her housekeeping she had arisen soon after six o'clock. Her plans were all laid beforehand, and a wonderfully methodical and well arranged programme, considering her fourteen years, was hers; she was all agog with eagerness to carry it out.  \"Oh, won't they have a breakfast this morning,\" she said to herself. \"Won't they open their eyes, and won't Bob and Bunny look greedy. And Firefly--I must watch Firefly over those hot cakes, or she may make herself sick. Poor father and Nell--they'll both be afraid at first that I'm a little too lavish and inclined to be extravagant, but they'll see by-and-by, and they'll acknowledge deep down in their hearts that there never was such a housekeeper as Polly.\"  As the little maid dreamed these pleasant thoughts she scrambled somewhat untidily into her clothes, gave her hair a somewhat less careful brush than usual, and finally knelt down to say her morning prayer. Helen still slept, and Polly by a sudden impulse chose to kneel by Helen's bed and not her own. She pressed her curly head against the mattress, and eagerly whispered her petitions. She was excited and sanguine, for this was to her a moment of triumph; but as she prayed a feeling of rest and yet of longing overpowered her.  \"Oh, I am happy to-day,\" she murmured--\"but oh, mother, oh, mother, I'd give everything in all the wide world to have you back again! I'd live on bread and water--I'd spend years in a garret just for you to kiss me once again, mother, mother!\"  Helen stirred in her sleep, for Polly's last impulsive words were spoken aloud.  \"Has mother"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18668"],["title","In Search of the Unknown (#0)"],["body","*       *       *       *       *      +--------------------------------------------------------------+     | Transcriber's Note:                                          |     |                                                              |     | Inconsistent hyphenation matches the original document.      |     |                                                              |     | A number of obvious typographical errors have been corrected |     | in this text.

CHAMBERS  AUTHOR OF \"THE MAIDS OF PARADISE\" \"THE MAID-AT-ARMS\" \"CARDIGAN\" \"THE CONSPIRATORS\" ETC.     NEW YORK AND LONDON HARPER & BROTHERS PUBLISHERS 1904     Copyright, 1904, by ROBERT W. CHAMBERS.  _All rights reserved._ Published June, 1904.                TO         MY FRIEND     E. LE GRAND BEERS      MY DEAR LE GRAND,--You and I were early drawn together by a     common love of nature. Your researches into the natural     history of the tree-toad, your observations upon the     mud-turtles of Providence Township, your experiments with the     fresh-water lobster, all stimulated my enthusiasm in a     scientific direction, which has crystallized in this helpful     little book, dedicated to you.      Pray accept it as an insignificant payment on account for all     I owe to you.                THE AUTHOR.     PREFACE   It appears to the writer that there is urgent need of more \"nature books\"--books that are scraped clear of fiction and which display only the carefully articulated skeleton of fact. Hence this little volume, presented with some hesitation and more modesty. Various chapters have, at intervals, appeared in the pages of various publications. The continued narrative is now published for the first time; and the writer trusts that it may inspire enthusiasm for natural and scientific research, and inculcate a passion for accurate observation among the young.    THE AUTHOR.    _April 1, 1904._         Where the slanting forest eaves,     Shingled tight with greenest leaves,     Sweep the scented meadow-sedge,     Let us snoop along the edge;     Let us pry in hidden nooks,     Laden with our nature books,     Scaring birds with happy cries,     Chloroforming butterflies,     Rooting up each woodland plant,     Pinning beetle, fly, and ant,     So we may identify     What we've ruined, by-and-by.     IN SEARCH OF THE UNKNOWN   I   Because it all seems so improbable--so horribly impossible to me now, sitting here safe and sane in my own library--I hesitate to record an episode which already appears to me less horrible than grotesque. Yet, unless this story is written now, I know I shall never have the courage to tell the truth about the matter--not from fear of ridicule, but because I myself shall soon cease to credit what I now know to be true. Yet scarcely a month has elapsed since I heard the stealthy purring of what I believed to be the shoaling undertow--scarcely a month ago, with my own eyes, I saw that which, even now, I am beginning to believe never existed. As for the harbor-master--and the blow I am now striking at the old order of things--But of that I shall not speak now, or later; I shall try to tell the story simply and truthfully, and let my friends testify as to my probity and the publishers of this book corroborate them.  On the 29th of February I resigned my position under the government and left Washington to accept an offer from Professor Farrago--whose name he kindly permits me to use--and on the first day of April I entered upon my new and congenial duties as general superintendent of the water-fowl department connected with the Zoological Gardens then in course of erection at Bronx Park, New York.  For a week I followed the routine, examining the new foundations, studying the architect's plans, following the surveyors through the Bronx thickets, suggesting arrangements for water-courses and pools destined to be included in the enclosures for swans, geese, pelicans, herons, and such of the waders and swimmers as we might expect to acclimate in Bronx Park.  It was at that time the policy of the trustees and officers of the Zoological Gardens neither to employ collectors nor to send out expeditions in search of specimens. The society decided to depend upon voluntary contributions, and I was always busy, part of the day, in dictating answers to correspondents who wrote offering their services as hunters of big game, collectors of all sorts of fauna, trappers, snarers, and also to those who offered specimens for sale, usually at exorbitant rates.  To the proprietors of five-legged kittens, mangy lynxes, moth-eaten coyotes, and dancing bears I returned courteous but uncompromising refusals--of course, first submitting all such letters, together with my replies, to Professor Farrago.  One day towards the end of May, however, just as I was leaving Bronx Park to return to town, Professor Lesard, of the reptilian department, called out to me that Professor Farrago wanted to see me a moment; so I put my pipe into my pocket again and retraced my steps to the temporary, wooden building occupied by Professor Farrago, general superintendent of the Zoological Gardens. The professor, who was sitting at his desk before a pile of letters and replies submitted for approval by me, pushed his glasses down and looked over them at me with a whimsical smile that suggested amusement, impatience, annoyance, and perhaps a faint trace of apology.  \"Now, here's a letter,\" he said, with a deliberate gesture towards a sheet of paper impaled on a file--\"a letter that I suppose you remember.\" He disengaged the sheet of paper and handed it to me.  \"Oh yes,\" I replied, with a shrug; \"of course the man is mistaken--or--\"  \"Or what?\" demanded Professor Farrago, tranquilly, wiping his glasses.  \"--Or a liar,\" I replied.  After a silence he leaned back in his chair and bade me read the letter to him again, and I did so with a contemptuous tolerance for the writer, who must have been either a very innocent victim or a very stupid swindler. I said as much to Professor Farrago, but, to my surprise, he appeared to waver.  \"I suppose,\" he said, with his near-sighted, embarrassed smile, \"that nine hundred and ninety-nine men in a thousand would throw that letter aside and condemn the writer as a liar or a fool?\"  \"In my opinion,\" said I, \"he's one or the other.\"  \"He isn't--in mine,\" said the professor, placidly.  \"What!\" I exclaimed. \"Here is a man living all alone on a strip of rock and sand between the wilderness and the sea, who wants you to send somebody to take charge of a bird that doesn't exist!\"  \"How do you know,\" asked Professor Farrago, \"that the bird in question does not exist?\"  \"It is generally accepted,\" I replied, sarcastically, \"that the great auk has been extinct for years. Therefore I may be pardoned for doubting that our correspondent possesses a pair of them alive.\"  \"Oh, you young fellows,\" said the professor, smiling wearily, \"you embark on a theory for destinations that don't exist.\"  He leaned back in his chair, his amused eyes searching space for the imagery that made him smile.  \"Like swimming squirrels, you navigate with the help of Heaven and a stiff breeze, but you never land where you hope to--do you?\"  Rather red in the face, I said: \"Don't you believe the great auk to be extinct?\"  \"Audubon saw the great auk.\"  \"Who has seen a single specimen since?\"  \"Nobody--except our correspondent here,\" he replied, laughing.  I laughed, too, considering the interview at an end, but the professor went on, coolly:  \"Whatever it is that our correspondent has--and I am daring to believe that it _is_ the great auk itself--I want you to secure it for the society.\"  When my astonishment subsided my first conscious sentiment was one of pity. Clearly, Professor Farrago was on the verge of dotage--ah, what a loss to the world!  I believe now that Professor Farrago perfectly interpreted my thoughts, but he betrayed neither resentment nor impatience. I drew a chair up beside his desk--there was nothing to do but to obey, and this fool's errand was none of my conceiving.  Together we made out a list of articles necessary for me and itemized the expenses I might incur, and I set a date for my return, allowing no margin for a successful termination to the expedition.  \"Never mind that,\" said the professor. \"What I want you to do is to get those birds here safely. Now, how many men will you take?\"  \"None,\" I replied, bluntly; \"it's a useless expense, unless there is something to bring back. If there is I'll wire you, you may be sure.\"  \"Very well,\" said Professor Farrago, good-humoredly, \"you shall have all the assistance you may require. Can you leave to-night?\"  The old gentleman was certainly prompt. I nodded, half-sulkily, aware of his amusement.  \"So,\" I said, picking up my hat, \"I am to start north to find a place called Black Harbor, where there is a man named Halyard who possesses, among other household utensils, two extinct great auks--\"  We were both laughing by this time. I asked him why on earth he credited the assertion of a man he had never before heard of.  \"I suppose,\" he replied, with the same half-apologetic, half-humorous smile, \"it is instinct. I feel, somehow, that this man Halyard _has_ got an auk--perhaps two. I can't get away from the idea that we are on the eve of acquiring the rarest of living creatures. It's odd for a scientist to talk as I do; doubtless you're shocked--admit it, now!\"  But I was not shocked; on the contrary, I was conscious that the same strange hope that Professor Farrago cherished was beginning, in spite of me, to stir my"]]]
