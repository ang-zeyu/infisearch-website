The remainder is knowledge.\"  There were doors on every side of that egg-shaped cave, each set cunningly into a natural fold of rock, so that they seemed to have been inset when it was molten, in the way that nuts are set into chocolate--pushed into place by a pair of titanic thumbs. And at last we seemed to have reached a place where the Gray Mahatma might not enter uninvited, for he selected one of the doors after a moment's thought and knocked.  We stood there for possibly ten minutes, without an answer, the Mahatma seeming satisfied with his own meditation, and we not caring to talk lest he should overhear us.  At last the door opened, not cautiously, but suddenly and wide, and a man stood square in it who filled it up from frame to frame--a big-eyed, muscular individual in loin-cloth and turban, who looked too proud to assert his pride. He stood with arms folded and a smile on his firm mouth; and the impression he conveyed was that of a master-craftsman, whose skill was his life, and whose craft was all he cared about.  He eyed the Mahatma without respect or flinching, and said nothing.  Have you ever watched two wild animals meet, stand looking at each other, and suddenly go off together without a sign of an explanation? That was what happened. The man in the doorway presently turned his back and led the way in.  The passage we entered was just exactly wide enough for me to pass along with elbows touching either wall. It was high; there was plenty of air in it; it was as scrupulously clean as a hospital ward. On either hand there were narrow wooden doors, spaced about twenty feet apart, every one of them closed; there were no bolts on the outside of the doors, and no keyholes, but I could not move them by shoving against them as I passed.  The extraordinary circumstance was the light. The whole passage was bathed in light, yet I could not detect where it came from. It was not dazzling like electricity. No one place seemed brighter than another, and there were no shadows.  The end of the passage forked at a perfect right angle, and there were doors at the end of each arm of the fork. Our guide turned to the right. He, King and the Mahatma passed through a door that seemed to open at the slightest touch, and the instant the Mahatma's back had passed the door-frame I found myself in darkness.  I had hung back a little, trying to make shadows with my hands to discover the direction of the light; and the strange part was that I could see bright light in front of me through the open door, but none of it came out into the passage.  It was intuition that caused me to pause at the threshold before following the others through. Something about the suddenness with which the light had ceased in the passage the moment the Mahatma's back was past the door, added to curiosity, made me stop and consider that plane where the light left off. Having no other instrument available, I took off my turban and flapped it to and fro, to see whether I could produce any effect on that astonishing dividing line, and for about the ten thousandth time in a somewhat strenuous career it was intuition and curiosity that saved me.  The instant the end of the turban touched the plane between light and darkness it caught fire; or rather, I should say fire caught it, and the fire was so intense and swift that it burned off that part of the turban without damaging the rest. In other words, there was a plane of unimaginably active heat between me and the rest of the party--of such extraordinary heat that it functioned only on that plane (for I could not feel it with my hand from an inch away); and I being in pitch darkness while they were in golden light, the others could not see me.  They could hear, however, and I called to King. I told him what happened, and then showed him, by throwing what was left of the turban toward him. It got exactly as far as the plane between light and darkness, and then vanished in a silent flash so swiftly and completely as to leave no visible charred fragment.  I could see all three men standing in line facing in my direction, hardly ten feet away, and it was difficult to remember that they could not see me at all--or at any rate that King could not; the others may have had some trained sixth sense that made it possible.  \"Come forward!\" said the Gray Mahatma. \"We three came by. Why should it harm you?\"  King sized up the situation instantly. If they intended to kill me and keep him alive, that would not be with his permission or connivance, and he stepped forward suddenly toward me.  \"Stop!\" commanded the Mahatma, showing the first trace of excitement that he had yet betrayed, but King kept on, and I suppose that the man who was acting showman did something, because King crossed the line without anything happening and then stood with one foot on each side of the threshold while I crossed.  \"There are two of us in this!\" he said to the Gray Mahatma then. \"You can't kill one and take the other.\"  We were in a chamber roughly fifty feet square, whose irregular corners were proof enough that it had been originally another of those huge blow-holes in volcanic stone; the roof, too, had been left rough, but the greater part of the side-walls had been finished off smooth with the chisel, and hand-rubbed.  There was a big, rectangular rock exactly in the middle of the room, shaped like a table or an altar, and polished until it shone. I decided to sit down on it--whereat the Mahatma ceased to ignore me.  \"Fool!\" he barked. \"Keep off that!\"  I tore a piece off the rag I was wearing for a loin-cloth and tossed it on the polished surface of the stone. It vanished instantly and left no trace; it did not even leave a mark on the stone, and the burning was so swift and complete that there was no smell.  \"Thanks!\" I said. \"But why your sudden anxiety on my account?\"  He turned to King again.  \"You have seen the _camera obscura_ that shows in darkness the scenery near at hand, provided the sun is shining? The _camera obscura_ is a feeble imitation of the true idea. There are no limits to the vision of him who understands true science. What city do you wish to see?\"  \"Benares,\" King answered.  Suddenly we were in darkness. Equally suddenly the whole top surface of the stone table became bathed in light of a different quality--light like daylight, that perhaps came upward from the stone, but if so came only a little way. To me it looked much more as if it began suddenly in mid-air and descended toward the surface of the stone.  And there all at once, as clearly as if we saw it on the focusing screen of a gigantic camera, lay Benares spread before us, with all its color, its sacred cattle in the streets, its crowds bathing in the Ganges, temples, domes, trees, movement--almost the smell of Benares was there, for the suggestion was all-inclusive.  \"But why is it daylight in Benares while it's somewhere near midnight here?\" King demanded.  That instant the sunshine in Benares ceased and the moon and stars came out. The glow of lamps shone forth from the temple courtyards, and down by the river ghats were the lurid crimson flame and smoke where they cremated dead Hindus. It was far more perfect than a motion picture. Allowing for scale it looked actually real.  Suddenly the chamber was all suffused in golden light once more and the picture on the granite table vanished.  \"Name another city,\" said the Gray Mahatma.  \"London,\" King answered.  The light went out, and there sure enough was London--first the Strand, crowded with motor-busses; then Ludgate Hill and St. Paul's; then the Royal Exchange and Bank of England; then London Bridge and the Tower Bridge and a panorama of the Thames.  \"Are you satisfied?\" the Gray Mahatma asked, and once again the cavern was flooded with that peculiarly restful golden light, while the picture on the granite table disappeared.  \"Not a bit,\" King answered. \"It's a trick of some sort.\"  \"Is wireless telegraphy a trick then?\" retorted the Mahatma. \"If so, then yes, so this is. Only this is as far in advance of wireless telegraphy, as telegraphy is in advance of the semaphore. This is a science beyond your knowledge, that is all. Name another city.\"  \"Timbuctu,\" I said suddenly; and nothing happened.  \"Mombasa,\" I said then, and Mombasa appeared instantly, with Kilindini harbor fringed with palm-trees.  I had been to Mombasa, whereas I never had seen Timbuctu. Almost certainly none present had ever seen the place, or even a picture of it.  The Gray Mahatma said something in a surly undertone and the golden light turned itself on again, flooding the whole chamber. King nodded to me.  \"You can speak into a phonograph and reproduce your voice. There's no reason why you can't think and reproduce that too, if you know how,\" he said.  \"Aye!\" the Mahatma interrupted. \"If you know how! India has always known how! India can teach these sciences to all the world when she comes into her freedom.\"  Throughout, the man who had admitted us had not spoken one word. He stood with arms folded, as upright as a soldier on parade. But now he unfolded his arms and began to exhibit signs of restlessness, as if he considered that the session had lasted long enough. However, he was still silent.  \"Your honor is extremely clever. I've enjoyed the exhibition,\" I said to him in Hindustanee, but he took not the slightest notice of me, and if he understood he did not betray the fact.  \"Let us go,\" said the Gray Mahatma, and proceeded to lead the way.  The Gray Mahatma took the other turning of the passage, and knocked on the door at the end. It was opened by a little man, who once had been extremely fat, for his skin hung about him in loose folds.  His cavern was smaller than the other, but as clean, and similarly flooded with the restful golden light. But he was only host; the Gray Mahatma was showman. He said:  \"All energy is vibrations; yet that is only one fraction of the truth. All is vibration."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18990"],["title","Billy Whiskers' Adventures (#0)"],["body","made available by the Library of Congress)              *       *       *       *       *      +------------------------------------------------------------+     | Transcriber's Note:                                        |     |                                                            |     | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in        |     | this text.

Billy saw the man raise the mop to come after him.  Billy overtook her and gave her a gentle butt that landed her in the middle of the bed.  It was Stubby's and Button's frantic efforts to escape that had caused all the fun and laughter.  \"Aren't you ashamed of yourself to take the baby's bottle away from it!\" reproved Nannie.  \"Oh, oh! Where did you come from?\" wailed one little girl when the kids jumped out of the shrubbery and grabbed her bag of popcorn.     _Billy Whiskers' Adventures_   CHAPTER I  THE CHUMS RETURN TO THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE BRAVE   Billy Whiskers, Stubby and Button sailed by the Goddess of Liberty and entered New York harbor after being in France ever since our troops entered the War. They had gone over on one of the troop ships and it just so happened that they returned on the same ship and with the same Captain and crew.  They were returning home covered with scars and wounds received while performing acts of bravery, but what cared they for scars and wounds so long as they had not lost an eye, ear or leg, and were feeling perfectly well and strong? To be sure, Billy had lost the tip of his tail when he was blown up by a bomb, but that did not matter.  You never saw three such happy animals as these were to be able once again to lay eyes on their beloved country,--the United States of America, that glorious country of the free and the brave.  \"Gee, I feel so happy I could jump out of my skin!\" exclaimed Billy with glowing eyes as the three stood on deck watching the familiar shores slip by them and the skyscraper buildings grow taller and taller and taller as they approached them.  \"See!\" said Billy. \"We are about to dock. Now the next thing to settle is where we are going when we first land.\"  But the question was settled for them in a most unexpected way. For before Billy's remark could be answered, all three of them felt ropes being slipped around their necks, and heard the loud guffaws of three sturdy sailors as they pulled the ropes tighter, saying, \"This is the time we caught you fellows off your guard!\"  \"We surely caught you slick as a whistle,\" remarked one of the sailors. \"And now we have you, we are going to carry out the Captain's orders and look after you until he hears from France whether we are to take you back to your regiments when we return with more troops or keep you here.\"  \"Return to France?\" whined Stubby. \"Just when we reach home safe and sound after braving all the terrors of submarines, sunken mines and dropping bombs? To be captured and sent back is really too much! I don't feel as if I would survive the disappointment, do you, Billy?\"  \"Not on your life will I go back!\" replied Billy. \"Not unless they take me over dead. For I shall fight to the last drop of my blood before I submit to being shipped back.\"  \"And so will I,\" said Button. \"I'll scratch their eyes out first. And from this day forward I shall begin to let my claws grow long and sharp for that very purpose. I'll see whether or not they take _me_ back!\"  \"But they haven't started back yet, and 'There's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip.' We'll have two or three weeks to make a getaway before they sail as they have to coal the ship before even thinking of sailing. And if in that time we three can't put our heads together and think of some way to slip through their fingers, we are pretty stupid and deserve to be shipped back. Don't pull back or make any fuss,\" counseled Billy, \"but just go along with the sailors and watch for a chance to escape. It may come any minute. And remember if any one of us sees a chance, he is to take it and not wait for the others. Just get free and then wait around until the rest of us get loose.\"  \"Seems to me you have a good deal of baaing to do this morning, Mr. Billy,\" said the sailor who was holding the rope around Billy's neck as he stood watching the ship tie up at the dock.  \"Guess he must be giving orders to his Chums,\" replied a second sailor who had Stubby in charge.  \"Seems like it,\" said the one who held Button. \"I expected them to fight like the very dickens, didn't you?\"  [Illustration]  \"I surely did,\" answered the one who had spoken first. \"But it is not too late for them to show fight yet, and I bet all that talking His Royal Highness, King Billy, has been doing has been orders to his Chums to fight later on. You just wait and see.\"  Just then the Captain appeared on deck and ordered the sailors to take the goat, dog and cat ashore and tie them in the warehouse on the dock until he could find some place to board them until he heard from France what to do with them.  \"They are too valuable to leave just on the dock. They might get loose or be stolen. Feed and water them and when I go up to the city I will look for some trustworthy person to take care of them. By the way, don't one of you know some one ashore who could house and feed them until we hear?\"  \"Aye, aye, sir!\" replied one of the sailors. \"I have an uncle who lives close to the docks. He keeps a small, cheap boarding-house for sailors. He is a very kind-hearted man and fond of pets. I could take them there and I am sure he would give them the best of care for very little recompense.\"  \"Just the thing! Just the place for them!\" exclaimed the Captain. \"You may take them over there as soon as the gangplank is out. And you two boys go with him. He might have trouble trying to manage all three alone. Here is money to pay for the animals and to buy your own dinners. Tell your Uncle I'll foot the bill before we sail and throw in an extra dollar or two if he turns them over to me in good shape when we call for them.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir!\" replied the sailor.  \"Well, this beats all the good luck I ever heard of,\" said Billy, \"for we can get away from that boarding-house as easily as a cat laps cream.\"  \"You are right, we can, and have plenty of time too to lay our plans as to what we will do when we escape,\" agreed Button.  \"It looks as if we would sleep on feathers and eat fowl,\" said Stubby.  The three sailors took the three Chums over to the chop-house, where they were given a hearty welcome by the sailor's uncle. He was so glad to have his nephew back from the War unhurt that he gladly took in the animals to please him. And I really think that had his nephew asked him to let the Chums sleep in his beds instead of in a shed in the back yard, he would have consented. As it was, Stubby and Button came near having fits from the amount of meat they ate as the Uncle had given them the scrapings from the plates, making a pile of beef and chop bones a foot high. He also gave Billy so many vegetables and so much juicy fruit that he had cramps all night.  In the morning there was still plenty of food left for their breakfast, but the Uncle insisted on giving them a fresh supply of food and water.  \"He is a mighty fine old man,\" said Billy, \"and I feel like a villain planning to run away from him, but we must or run the risk of being sent back to our regiments in France, and I for one am sick to death of war.\"  About ten o'clock in the morning the Uncle and the three sailors came into the yard to see how the animals were faring, and the sailors seemed pleased with the way they looked.  \"Now we can tell the Captain when we return to the ship that we saw the animals just before we went to the boat and that they were"]]]
