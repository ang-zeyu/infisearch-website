Right then she called to one of the cockerels, who was near-by. \"Just skip across the yard and ask the Rooster--\" she began.  The cockerel broke right in upon her message.  \"Oh! I can't do that!\" he exclaimed. \"I've never gone up to the Rooster and spoken to him. If I did, he'd be sure to fight me.\"  \"Just tell him that I sent you,\" said Henrietta. And she made the cockerel listen to her message. But he wouldn't be persuaded. He told Henrietta that the Rooster would be sure to jump at him the moment he opened his mouth. \"Besides,\" he added, \"it wouldn't do any good, anyhow. The Rooster can't wait until after daylight, before he begins to crow.\"  \"He can't, eh?\" Henrietta Hen spoke up somewhat sharply. \"I'd like to know the reason why!\" And fixing her gaze sternly upon the Rooster, she marched straight across the farmyard towards him, to find out.     VII  WARNING THE ROOSTER   \"Good Afternoon!\" Henrietta Hen greeted the Rooster. He had not seen her as she walked towards him. And when she spoke he hastily arranged his two long tail-feathers in what he considered a more becoming droop.  \"Good afternoon, madam!\" he answered--for the Rooster prided himself that he was always polite to the ladies. \"Er--there's nothing wrong, I hope,\" he added quickly as he noticed an odd gleam in Henrietta Hen's eye.  \"Yes--there is,\" she said. The cockerels might fear the Rooster, but Henrietta certainly didn't. She considered him a good deal of a braggart. Indeed, she even had an idea that she could have whipped him herself, had she cared to be so unladylike as to fight. \"I've been bothered for a long time because you crow so early in the morning. You make such a racket that you wake me up every day.\"  The Booster hemmed and hawed. Somehow he felt uncomfortable.  \"That's unfortunate,\" he stammered. And then he had a happy thought. \"Anyhow,\" he continued, with a smile at Henrietta, \"you don't look as if you lacked for sleep, madam. You grow more beautiful every day.\"  Henrietta Hen admitted that it was so. \"But,\" she said, \"I believe I'd be even handsomer if I weren't disturbed so early. I don't like to get up while it's dark. So I'm going to ask you to delay your crowing, from now on, until after sunrise.\"  \"Impossible!\" cried the Rooster. \"I'm sorry to disoblige you, madam. But what you ask can't be done.\"  \"That's just what the cockerel said!\" Henrietta Hen exclaimed.  \"The cockerel!\" the Rooster echoed angrily. \"Which one? Has one of those upstarts been talking about me? Point him out to me and I'll soon teach him a lesson.\"  Henrietta Hen said that she hadn't noticed which cockerel it was. Somehow they all looked alike to her.  \"Good!\" the Rooster cried. \"Then I'll have to whip them all, to make sure of punishing the guilty one.\" He looked very fierce.  \"Don't be absurd!\" Henrietta told him. \"I asked one of the cockerels to give you a message about not crowing so early. And he declined. He said it wouldn't do any good.\"  \"It wouldn't have done _him_ any good,\" the Rooster declared, stamping a foot and thrusting his bill far forward, to show Henrietta Hen how brave he was.  \"What's the matter?\" she inquired. \"Have you eaten something that disagrees with you?\"  The Rooster couldn't help looking foolish. Henrietta Hen believed in letting him know that she stood in no awe of him. And while he was feeling ill at ease she hastened to tell him that hereafter he must _hold onto_ his first crow until after sunrise.  \"I can't do that,\" he told her again, unhappily.  \"Don't you dare let go of it!\" she warned him. \"If that first crow gets away from you while it's dark, there'll be so many others to follow it that I shan't be able to close an eye for even a cat-nap.\"     VIII  WHY THE ROOSTER CROWED   Henrietta Hen had commanded the Rooster to wait until daylight before he began to crow.  He saw that she had made up her mind that he must obey her. But he knew he couldn't. And he always took great pains to be polite to the ladies.  It was a wonder the Rooster didn't turn red in the face. He had never found himself in such a corner before.  \"You don't understand,\" he blurted. \"I'd be delighted to oblige you, but if I didn't crow until after the sun rose I'd never crow again.\"  \"We could stand that,\" was Henrietta Hen's grim reply.  \"Perhaps!\" he admitted--for she made him feel strangely humble. \"But could you stand it if the night lasted forever?\"  \"You're talking nonsense now,\" she declared.  \"You don't understand,\" he told her again. \"And I must say I'm surprised, madam, that you didn't know it was I that waked the sun up every morning. _That's_ why I crow so early.\"  Henrietta Hen was so astonished that she didn't know what to say. She thought deeply for a time--or as deeply as she could.  \"Have you not noticed,\" the Rooster inquired, \"that the sun never rises until I've crowed loudly a good many times?\"  \"No! No--I haven't,\" Henrietta murmured. \"But now that you speak of it, I see that it's so.\"  \"Exactly!\" he said. \"And often, madam, I have to crow a long time before he peeps over Blue Mountain. It's lucky I have a good, strong voice,\" the Rooster, added with a smirk, for he was feeling more at his ease. \"If I had a thin, squeaky crow such as those worthless cockerels have, Farmer Green would have had to do many a day's work in the dark.\"  \"Goodness!\" Henrietta Hen gasped. \"Do crow your loudest the moment you wake up, Mr. Rooster! Do make all the noise you can!\" And he promised faithfully that he would.  Henrietta left him then. Somehow she couldn't get their talk out of her mind. And soon she had an unhappy thought. What if anything should happen to the Rooster's voice?  The moment that question popped into her head, Henrietta Hen hurried back to the Rooster.  \"Do be careful!\" she besought him. \"Don't get your feet wet! For if you caught cold you might be so hoarse that you couldn't speak above a whisper.\"  The Rooster thanked her politely for thinking of his health.  \"I always take good care of myself,\" he assured her.  \"It looks like rain this minute,\" she said as she cast an anxious glance at the sky. \"Hadn't you better run into the barn?\"  He thought otherwise--and said as much.  \"You ought to wear rubbers every day,\" she chided him, as she went away again.  Soon Henrietta returned once more to urge the Rooster to carry an umbrella. And it wasn't long after that when she came bustling up to him and informed him that a warm muffler about his throat wouldn't be amiss.  There seemed to be no end to her suggestions. And though at first the Rooster had liked to hear them (without having any idea of following them) after a time Henrietta's attentions began to annoy him.  \"Great cracked corn!\" he exclaimed. \"This Henrietta Hen is getting to be a pest.\"     IX  HAUGHTY HENRIETTA   Feeling as important as she did, Henrietta Hen liked to have her own way. She said that she couldn't be expected to do just as others wished.  \"I'll take orders from nobody,\" she often declared. \"And if I lay eggs for Farmer Green I shall lay them when and where I please.\"  Henrietta took special delight in laying her eggs in out-of-the-way places. She was never content to lay two in the same nest.  \"If they left them for me perhaps I'd feel differently,\" she explained to her neighbors. \"But Johnnie Green gathers every egg that he can find. And if he takes my eggs I'll make him hunt for them, anyhow.\"  The older, more staid hens shook their heads when Henrietta talked like that. They told her she was ungrateful.  \"Farmer Green gives you a snug home and plenty of food,\" they reminded her. \"And the least you can do is to repay him. You ought not to make trouble by hiding your eggs.\"  But Henrietta Hen couldn't--or wouldn't--agree with them.  \"It's all very well for you to talk,\" she retorted. \"If my eggs were undersized I shouldn't mind losing them as fast as I laid them. But I lay the biggest and finest eggs to be had. So it's only natural that I should like to have at least _one_ around to look at--and to show to callers.\"  Now, there were plenty of other hens in the flock that laid eggs exactly as big--or even bigger--than Henrietta Hen's. Some of them told her as much. Yet it did them no good to talk to her. She wouldn't believe that there were any eggs in the world to compare with hers. So her neighbors learned after a while that they might as well let Henrietta Hen manage her affairs as she pleased. They couldn't help hoping, however, that somehow Farmer Green would find a way to outwit her.  \"What can Henrietta Hen be so boastful about now?\" the hens asked one another one day. \"She acts as if she thought more highly of herself than ever.\"  They soon discovered the reason for Henrietta's unusually pompous manner. For she began to make calls on all her friends. And she invited everybody to come to her latest nest high up in the haymow.  \"I've something there to show you,\" she said with an air of mystery. \"You'll be surprised to see it.\"  Most of Henrietta's neighbors did not show any great curiosity to see the surprise. They smiled at one another. \"She's laid another egg--that's all!\" they whispered.  But there are always some that can't rest until they know everybody else's business. And it was lucky that Henrietta Hen hurried home to receive her callers, because she had a good many. They came even earlier in the afternoon than was strictly fashionable. And they came in a crowd, too. That, however, didn't bother Henrietta Hen. Nor could they have arrived too soon to suit her.  \"Look!\" she cried, when they reached her nest high up in the haymow. \"Did you ever see anything to beat that?\"     X  THE BIG, WHITE EGG   When Henrietta Hen's callers crowded about her nest in the haymow they expected to see something wonderful. But when they "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18652"],["title","The Tale of Henrietta Hen (#3)"],["body","their necks and peered into the little hollowed-out snuggery in the hay they couldn't help being disappointed. And when they didn't burst forth with cries of surprise and praise Henrietta Hen looked quite unhappy.  \"I thought,\" she said, \"you'd want to see this egg. I'm sure you never beheld a bigger nor a whiter one than this.\"  They admitted that the egg was big and that it was very, very white. And if their praise was faint, Henrietta never noticed it.  \"Are you going to let Farmer Green have that egg?\" one of the company inquired.  \"No doubt Johnnie Green will grab it as soon as he finds my nest,\" said Henrietta with something like a sigh. \"If I could only keep this one I wouldn't care how many others he took.\"  Polly Plymouth Rock turned to old Whitey, a hen who had come with her to the haymow.  \"What do you think?\" Polly asked. \"Is Henrietta in danger of losing this egg that she thinks so much of?\"  \"She needn't be alarmed,\" old Whitey answered. \"If Johnnie Green robs her of this one, I'll miss my guess.\"  \"Oh! I'm glad to hear you say that!\" Henrietta Hen cried. \"Now I won't need to worry--that is, if you know what you're talking about.\"  That, of course, was a most impolite way for Henrietta Hen to speak to anybody of old Whitey's age. Whitey was the oldest hen in the flock. And what she didn't know about such things as nests and eggs and roosts wasn't worth knowing.  Polly Plymouth Rock didn't like Henrietta Hen's remark. She opened her mouth.  And no doubt she would have said something quite sharp in reply. But old Whitey stopped her.  \"Never mind!\" said Whitey. \"The day will come when Henrietta Hen will agree that my guess is a good one.\"  Still Henrietta Hen felt uneasy about that big, white egg.  \"I do hope Johnnie Green won't find this new nest of mine,\" she remarked.  \"If he does, I fear he'll take my beautiful egg away from me.\"  \"Lay another!\" said old Whitey. \"Lay another and he'll take that and leave this one.\"  \"I suppose I may as well try your scheme,\" Henrietta replied, \"since nobody suggests anything better.\"  \"My idea's a good one, or I'll miss my guess,\" said old Whitey.  There was some snickering among Henrietta Hen's callers as they bade her good afternoon and left her.  \"They're laughing at old Whitey,\" she said to herself. She hadn't the slightest notion that they could be giggling at _her_. \"Old Whitey must be wrong,\" she thought. \"But I may as well take her advice, for I don't know what else to do.\"  Not long afterward Henrietta Hen came fluttering down from the haymow, squawking at the top of her lungs for old Whitey. And as soon as she found her, Henrietta cried, \"Come up to my nest right away! I want to ask your advice.\"  Although she didn't say \"Please!\" old Whitey went with her.  [Illustration: \"Come Up to My Nest!\" Cried Henrietta Hen. (_Page 50_)]     XI  OLD WHITEY'S ADVICE   Old Whitey--the most ancient hen in the flock--scrambled with some difficulty up to the top of the haymow in Farmer Green's barn. She could scarcely keep up with Henrietta Hen, whom she was following--by request. And when she arrived, breathless, at Henrietta's nest that proud and elegant creature turned a troubled face toward her.  \"See!\" said Henrietta. \"I've taken your advice and laid another egg. But it's nothing like the beautiful, big, white one. This last egg is much smaller; and it's brown.\"  Old Whitey nodded her head. \"Well!\" she said. \"What's your difficulty?\"  \"Don't you think,\" said Henrietta, \"that if Johnnie Green finds my nest he'll be sure to take both eggs?\"  \"No, I don't,\" was old Whitey's blunt answer.  \"Then he'll be sure to take the big, white one,\" Henrietta Hen wailed.  \"No, he won't,\" old Whitey told her. \"If he does, I'll miss my guess.\"  Well, that was really too much for Henrietta Hen to believe.  \"That boy will never take a little egg and leave a big one,\" she declared.  \"You wait and see if he doesn't,\" old Whitey advised her.  So Henrietta waited. Though she had little faith in old Whitey's advice, Henrietta could think of nothing else to do. And the next morning, to her great surprise, when Johnnie Green climbed into the haymow and found her nest he took the small brown egg and put it in his hat. And he never touched the big, white egg at all. He didn't even pick it up and look at it!  Perched on a beam overhead Henrietta Hen watched him breathlessly. And as soon as he had gone she went flopping down to the barn floor and set up a great clamor for old Whitey.  \"What is it now?\" old Whitey asked, sticking her head inside the doorway.  \"Your guess was a good one!\" cried Henrietta Hen. \"He came; and he took the small one.\"  \"There!\" said old Whitey. \"I told you so! I knew Johnnie Green wouldn't rob you of that big egg. And if you keep laying small eggs in that same nest you'll find he'll let you keep the big one.\"  Henrietta Hen fairly beamed at her companion.  \"How delightful!\" she exclaimed. \"I've become very, very fond of that big egg. I love to look at it. But there's another thing that worries me now. If that big egg should get broken--\"  \"Don't let that trouble you!\" said old Whitey.  \"I'm almost afraid to sit on my nest,\" Henrietta Hen confessed. \"If the shell of that egg should happen to be thin--\"  Old Whitey seemed much amused by Henrietta's fears.  \"Let me know if you break it,\" she said. And then she left Henrietta with her treasure.  \"I'll be very careful,\" Henrietta called after the old dame.     XII  PLAYING TRICKS   Now, the hen known as old Whitey was something of a gossip. She went straight to the farmyard and told everybody what had happened--what Henrietta Hen had said to her and what she had said to Henrietta Hen. The whole flock had a great laugh over the affair.  To Henrietta Hen's delight, all her neighbors took a keen interest in the wonderful white egg. They asked her countless questions about it. Above all, they always took pains to inquire whether she had been so unlucky as to crack the shell. And if Henrietta hadn't displeased Polly Plymouth Rock one day, the truth might never have come out.  Anyhow, Polly Plymouth Rock told Henrietta Hen that if she had any sense she would stop making such a fuss over a china egg.  \"China egg!\" cried Henrietta. \"I don't know what you mean.\"  \"That's not a real egg that you're so proud of,\" Polly Plymouth Rock declared. \"It's nothing but a make-believe one. Johnnie Green left it in your nest to fool you, so you'd keep that nest and lay eggs in it, right along.... You're so careful not to break that china egg! Why, if you _tried_ to break it you'd find that it's solid as a rock.\"  Henrietta Hen couldn't believe the terrible news.  \"I laid that egg myself!\" she shrieked.  \"You think you did; but you didn't,\" Polly Plymouth Rock snapped. \"Johnnie Green took an egg of yours one day and left that other one in its place, to deceive you. And everybody on the farm--except you--knows that he succeeded.\"  Henrietta Hen didn't wait to hear anything more. She rushed squalling into the barn and went straight to her nest. One good, hard peck at the big white egg told her beyond all doubt that she had been betrayed. The beautiful, big, white egg wasn't an egg after all!  Now that Henrietta Hen knew it she wondered how it could ever have deceived her. She saw that it was shiny and altogether unlike any egg she had ever seen anywhere.  \"Johnnie Green has played a mean trick on me,\" Henrietta Hen cackled. \"And now I'll play one on him! He can have his old china egg. I'll leave it here for him. But he'll find none of _my_ beautiful little brown eggs beside it. I'll have my nest where he'll never discover it--not if he hunts for it all summer long!\"  So saying, she left the haymow. And going into the carriage shed, her roving eyes chanced to light on an old straw hat of Johnnie Green's that lay upside down upon a high shelf.  Henrietta Hen managed to flutter up beside it. And then with many a chuckle she laid a brown egg in the hat.  \"There!\" she cackled. \"This is the safest place on the farm. Johnnie Green hasn't had this hat on his head since last summer.\"     XIII  TWO IN A GARDEN   Jimmy Rabbit was enjoying a few nibbles at one of Farmer Green's cabbages. He hadn't noticed that there was anybody but himself in the garden. So it startled him to hear a shrill voice cry, \"Get out of our garden!\"  Jimmy Rabbit jumped. But he didn't jump far, for he soon saw that it was only Henrietta Hen speaking to him.  \"Why should I get out of _our_ garden?\" Jimmy Rabbit inquired mildly.  \"I should have said, 'Farmer Green's garden,'\" said Henrietta Hen.  \"Thank you very much for the warning; but I don't think we need go away just yet--if old dog Spot isn't sniffing around,\" said Jimmy Rabbit. \"I don't believe there's any danger.\"  \"You don't understand,\" Henrietta Hen cried. \"I _ordered_ you out of the garden.\"  \"_You_ ordered me?\" said Jimmy Rabbit, acting as if he were astonished.  \"Yes!\" Henrietta declared. \"And I'd like to know when you're going to obey me.\"  \"It's easy to answer that,\" Jimmy Rabbit replied. \"I'm going away as soon as I've finished my luncheon.\" Nobody could have been pleasanter than he. Yet Henrietta Hen seemed determined to be disagreeable.  \"I don't see your lunch basket,\" she remarked, looking all around.  \"No!\" he replied. \"I forgot it. I meant to bring one with me and carry a cabbage-head home in it.\"  Henrietta Hen spoke as if she were very peevish.  \"You've no right,\" she said, \"to take one of the cabbages away with you.\"  \"I'm not going to,\" Jimmy Rabbit explained.  \"You were nibbling at one when I first noticed you,\" Henrietta Hen insisted.  \"Was I?\" he gasped. \"Are you sure you're not mistaken? Are you sure you weren't pecking at a cabbage-leaf yourself?\"  Now, the truth of the matter was that Henrietta had herself come to the garden to eat cabbage. Really she was no better than he was. But somehow Henrietta Hen never could believe that she was in the wrong.  \"You're impertinent,\" she told Jimmy  [Illus"]]]
