He might cut himself in this heavy going.\"  Twinkleheels sniffed as he heard what Farmer Green said.  \"This is all nonsense,\" he grumbled to the old horse Ebenezer as Johnnie led him into his stall. \"Farmer Green doesn't know what he's talking about. I'm a hundred times sprier than Bright. And I'm a hundred times sprier than Broad. That makes me two hundred times sprier than both of them. It's silly to put me in my stall and take them out. They won't be able to move. They'll get stuck fast in a drift, and goodness knows how we'll ever haul them out.\"  \"I shouldn't worry about the oxen if I were you,\" Ebenezer replied. \"It seems to me Bright and Broad are old enough and big enough to look out for themselves.\"  \"That's just the trouble!\" cried Twinkleheels. \"They're too old and they're too big. They're terribly heavy. If they were stuck in a drift I don't believe you and the bays could pull them out--not even if I helped you.\"  Ebenezer sighed deeply.  \"I'm going to sleep now,\" he told Twinkleheels.  Soon Twinkleheels could hear Farmer Green shouting \"Gee!\" and \"Haw!\"  \"There!\" Twinkleheels called to the two bays. \"There's Farmer Green talking to Bright and Broad. I hope they're not helpless already.\"  The bays snickered.  \"Don't laugh!\" Twinkleheels begged them. \"It's not funny. It would be awful for them to spend the rest of the winter in a snow bank.\"  \"We weren't laughing at Bright and Broad,\" the bays explained.  Twinkleheels tried to look at them; but old Ebenezer's bony back was in the way.  \"I don't know what amuses you, then,\" he snapped.  \"Maybe you'll find out later,\" the bays told him.  And he did. When Johnnie Green next led him out of the barn Twinkleheels discovered that a broad path had been opened from the barn to the highway. And a little distance up the road Farmer Green and Bright and Broad were battling with the drifts.     XIV  STUCK IN A DRIFT   Outside the barn, in the snow-covered farmyard, Johnnie Green mounted Twinkleheels and rode him beyond the gate, where he could watch the fun up the road.  Yoked to a sort of plough, Bright and Broad, the oxen, tore through the piled-up snow and threw it to either side in great ridges.  \"I'm going ahead to the crossroads,\" Johnnie Green told his father.  That plan pleased Twinkleheels. Before Farmer Green could speak he plunged out of the broken road and wallowed in snow up to his neck. He was going to show Bright and Broad that he could get to the crossroads before they did.  \"Don't do that!\" Farmer Green shouted to Johnnie.  He was too late. The words were scarcely out of his mouth before Twinkleheels was reaching desperately for a footing. His toes found nothing firm beneath them--nothing but yielding snow. And his frantic struggles only made him sink the deeper.  Johnnie Green slid off Twinkleheels' back and tried to help him.  He could do nothing. And he turned a somewhat frightened face to his father.  \"We're stuck!\" he faltered. \"I can get out; but Twinkleheels can't. Do you suppose Bright and Broad could pull him out?\"  \"They could yank twenty of him back on the road,\" Farmer Green declared. \"But we don't need them. I'll dig the pony out.\"  Seizing a shovel, Johnnie's father slowly dug his way to Twinkleheels, who had stopped struggling and was waiting glumly for help. In a few minutes more he had scrambled out of the ditch and gained the road again, through the path that Farmer Green made for him.  \"Now,\" said Farmer Green, \"don't leave the broken road. This pony's too small to handle himself in these drifts. I wouldn't try to put even a full-sized horse through them. It takes oxen in such going. They're slow; but they're strong and sure-footed, too. And they can go where horses couldn't do anything but flounder and probably cut themselves with their own feet. That's why we always use Bright and Broad to gather sap in the sugar-bush.\"  \"I'll put Twinkleheels in the barn again,\" said Johnnie. \"Then I'll come back on foot and help you.\"  So he rode Twinkleheels back and hitched him in his stall once more.  Old Ebenezer woke up as Twinkleheels pattered over the barn floor.  \"What!\" cried the old horse. \"Back again so soon? Did you race with Bright and Broad?\"  \"The snow's too deep for a good race,\" Twinkleheels told him.  \"Bright and Broad don't mind the snow much, do they?\" Ebenezer asked.  \"Oh, no!\" Twinkleheels answered. \"They're getting on slowly, up the road. They take their time, of course.\"  \"Couldn't they beat you to the crossroads if you raced with them to-day?\"  \"Well--yes!\" Twinkleheels admitted. And he gave Ebenezer a sharp look. \"Who's been talking with you?\" he demanded.  \"Nobody!\" said Ebenezer. \"I've been dozing here all the morning.\"  \"Not even a sparrow?\" Twinkleheels asked.  \"No! Nobody has said a word to me.\"  \"That's strange,\" Twinkleheels mused. \"I was almost sure a little bird had told you something.\"     XV  STEPPING HIGH   Twinkleheels was feeling quite important. Something that Farmer Green had said to Johnnie in his hearing made him hold his head higher than he usually did--and step higher, too.  \"You seem very proud to-day,\" the old horse Ebenezer said to him. \"When Johnnie Green led you back from the watering trough I noticed that you were strutting in quite a lordly fashion. You made me think of Turkey Proudfoot.\"  \"Ah!\" Twinkleheels exclaimed. \"I've just heard some news. I'm going to the blacksmith's to-day to be shod. You know I've never worn any shoes. And I've always wanted some.\"  Old Ebenezer smiled down at Twinkleheels.  \"Well, well!\" he said. \"I don't blame you for feeling a bit proud. I remember the day I got my first set of shoes. You see, I was young once myself.\"  The old horse seemed to feel like talking. Twinkleheels was glad of that, for he felt that he _must_ chatter about the new shoes he was going to have--or burst.  \"Of course,\" said Twinkleheels, \"most folks are shod before they're as old as I am. But I've spent a good deal of my time in the pasture and I don't often travel over hard roads.... How old were you when you first visited the blacksmith's shop?\"  Ebenezer shut his eyes for a moment or two. And Twinkleheels feared he was going to sleep. But he was only thinking hard.  \"I must have been about two months old,\" Ebenezer declared.  \"Goodness!\" cried Twinkleheels. \"I didn't suppose colts of that age ever wore shoes.\"  \"They don't,\" Ebenezer replied. \"You didn't ask me when I had my first shoes. You asked me when I first visited a smithy. At the age of two months I jogged alongside my mother when she went to be shod. I must have been about three years old when the blacksmith nailed my first shoes to my feet.\"  Twinkleheels gave Ebenezer an uneasy glance.  \"Does it hurt,\" he asked, \"when they drive the nails into your hoofs?\"  \"Oh, no!\" Ebenezer assured him. \"To be sure, a careless blacksmith could prick you. But Farmer Green always takes us to the best one he can find.\"  \"To tell the truth,\" Twinkleheels confessed, \"I'm a bit timid about going to the smithy. I don't know what to do when I get there. I don't know which foot to hold up first.\"  \"Don't worry about that!\" said old Ebenezer. \"They'll tell you everything. Just pay attention and obey orders and you won't have any trouble.\"  Twinkleheels thanked Ebenezer.  \"It's pleasant,\" he said, \"to have a kind, wise horse like you in the next stall. There are some matters that I shouldn't care to mention to the bays. They're almost sure to laugh at me if I ask them a question.\"  The old horse Ebenezer nodded his head.  \"They're young and somewhat flighty,\" he admitted. \"You know, they even ran away last summer. You'll be better off! if you don't seek their advice about things.\"  \"I wish you were going to the blacksmith's shop with me,\" Twinkleheels told Ebenezer wistfully. \"Somehow I'd feel better about being shod if you were there.\"  \"I shouldn't be surprised if I went along with you,\" Ebenezer told him. \"I cast a shoe yesterday. And the three that I have left are well worn.\"  And sure enough! Inside a half hour Farmer Green harnessed Ebenezer to an open buggy. Johnnie Green brought Twinkleheels out of the barn by his halter, led him up behind the buggy, and jumped in and sat beside his father.  Then they started off.  \"We're going to the village to get some new shoes,\" Twinkleheels called to old dog Spot. \"Why don't you come, too?\"  \"I would,\" Spot barked, \"but I always follow right behind the buggy; and you've gone and taken my place.\"     XVI  THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP   Twinkleheels trotted proudly behind the buggy in which the old horse Ebenezer was pulling Johnnie Green and his father towards the village. Once Twinkleheels would have chafed at having to suit his pace to Ebenezer's. He would have thought Ebenezer's gait too slow. But ever since Ebenezer won a race with him in the pasture Twinkleheels had thought more highly of his elderly friend. He knew that if Ebenezer chose to take his time it wasn't because he couldn't have hurried had he cared to.  They reached the blacksmith shop at last, where Ebenezer and Twinkleheels were to get new shoes. Having been there many a time before, Ebenezer was quite calm. Twinkleheels, however, was somewhat uneasy. He had never visited a smithy. And he looked with wide, staring eyes at the low, dingy building. On the threshold he drew back, as he sniffed odors that were strange to him.  Johnnie Green spoke to him and urged him forward.  \"I'll wait for Ebenezer,\" Twinkleheels decided. And he wouldn't budge until Farmer Green led the old horse into the smithy. Then Twinkleheels followed.  \"Goodness!\" he cried to Ebenezer a moment later. \"This place is afire. Let's get outside at once!\" He had caught sight of a sort of flaming table against one of the walls.  \"Don't be alarmed!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18656"],["title","The Tale of Pony Twinkleheels (#5)"],["body","\" Ebenezer said. \"That's only the forge. That's where the blacksmith heats the shoes red hot, so he can pound them into the proper shape to fit the feet.\"  Twinkleheels had trembled with fear. And now he had scarcely recovered from his fright when a terrible clanging clatter startled him. He snorted and pulled back. He would have run out of the smithy had not Johnnie Green tied his halter rope to a ring in the wall.  \"Don't do that!\" the old horse Ebenezer called to him. \"There's no danger. That noise is nothing to be afraid of. It's only the smith pounding a horseshoe on his anvil.\"  Twinkleheels looked relieved--and just a bit sheepish.  \"I'm glad you came with me,\" he said, \"I'd have been frightened if you--.\" A queer hiss made Twinkleheels forget what he was saying. \"What's that?\" he cried. \"Is there a goose hidden somewhere in the smithy?\"  \"No! The smith put the hot shoe into a tub of water, to cool,\" Ebenezer explained. He couldn't help smiling a bit.  A scrubby looking white mare who was being shod turned her head and stared at Ebenezer and his small companion.  \"It's easy to see,\" she exclaimed, \"that that colt has never been in a smithy before. In my opinion he ought to be at home with his mother. This is no place for children.\"  Before Ebenezer could answer her, Twinkleheels himself spoke up sharply.  \"I don't know who you are, madam,\" he snapped. \"But I'd like you to understand that I'm no colt. I'm a pony. And I must say that I think you owe me an apology.\"     XVII  A WHITE VIXEN   The white mare that the blacksmith was shoeing looked much surprised when Twinkleheels told her he was not a colt.  \"Well, well!\" she cried. \"A pony, eh? Who'd have thought it? Anyhow, you've never been shod in your life. I can tell that by the way you act.\" And she cackled in a most unpleasant fashion.  \"What shall I say to her?\" Twinkleheels asked Ebenezer. \"She hasn't apologized to me.\"  \"Pay no attention to her,\" the old horse advised him in an undertone. \"She's a low bred person. I've often met her on the road and she always wants to stop and talk. But I hurry past her.\"  \"What are you saying?\" the white mare asked in a sour tone. \"Are you gossiping about me?\" She laid her ears back and showed her yellow teeth.  \"You see why I don't care to have anything to do with her,\" Ebenezer muttered to Twinkleheels.  \"I'd kick you if I could reach you--and that pony too,\" the white mare squealed. \"I'm a lady--I am. And you'd better be careful what you say about me.\"  Because she was angry and couldn't kick either Twinkleheels or Ebenezer she felt that she must kick somebody. So she let fly at the blacksmith, who had just stepped up beside her.  Strangely enough, instead of jumping away from her, the blacksmith crowded as close to her as he could get. He knew what he was about. He hadn't shod horses for twenty years without learning something about them. He stood so near the white mare that her kick hadn't room to get going well. And the blacksmith wasn't hurt. He was merely disgusted.  \"I declare,\" he said to Farmer Green, \"this mare is the meanest critter that comes into my shop. She doesn't know anything except how to kick and bite. That old horse of yours is worth a dozen like her. I'd give more for his tail than I would for her.\"  Ebenezer tried to look unconcerned. The blacksmith had a hearty voice. Nobody in the shop could help hearing what he said. And Twinkleheels made up his mind that the blacksmith shouldn't have any reason to speak of him as he had of the silly white mare.  Twinkleheels watched sharply as the blacksmith captured a hind foot of the white mare's and held it between his knees. Then he began to nail on the shoe.  One thing puzzled Twinkleheels. Every time the blacksmith struck a blow with his hammer he gave a funny grunt. Twinkleheels nudged Ebenezer with his nose.  \"Do you hear that?\" he asked. \"Is he related to Grunty Pig--a sort of cousin, perhaps?\"  The old horse Ebenezer gasped.  \"Bless you, no!\" he exclaimed.  \"Then why does he grunt?\"  \"Oh, that's just a way he has,\" said Ebenezer. \"Some blacksmiths think it's stylish to grunt like that.\"  By this time the white mare seemed to be in a pleasanter frame of mind. At least, she let the blacksmith nail a shoe on each of her feet without making any objection--except to switch her tail now and then. And just as the blacksmith finished with her a man came and led her away.  \"Now,\" said the blacksmith, \"I'm ready to shoe the pony. And if he's as clever as he looks I shan't have a bit of trouble with him.\"  When he heard that, Twinkleheels made up his mind that he would behave his best, no matter what happened.     XVIII  NEW SHOES   The blacksmith patted Twinkleheels and picked up one of his forefeet. Then the blacksmith took a chisel and began to pare away at the horny hoof. Twinkleheels looked over the blacksmith's shoulder. And what he saw gave him a start.  \"Great green grass!\" he cried to Ebenezer. \"Is he going to cut my foot off?\"  \"No, indeed!\" Ebenezer answered. \"The blacksmith always pares my feet a bit when he fits new shoes. He may have to trim yours a good deal, because you've never worn shoes and your feet have never been pared.\"  In spite of his resolve to be on his best behavior, Twinkleheels had been tempted to pull his foot from between the blacksmith's knees. And if Ebenezer hadn't explained that he was in no danger of losing a foot there's no knowing what might have happened. Twinkleheels breathed a sigh of relief; and he made not the slightest trouble for the blacksmith, but waited patiently while his little shoes were being hammered into shape.  When the blacksmith took the first one that he made and held it by a pair of pincers against Twinkleheels' hoof there was a quick sizzling. And a horrid smoke arose. Twinkleheels snorted with fear.  \"Easy! Easy, boy!\" the blacksmith said to him. And old Ebenezer made haste to explain that there was no danger.  \"Won't my foot be burned?\" Twinkleheels faltered.  \"Not enough to do any harm,\" said Ebenezer. \"You don't feel any pain, do you?\"  \"No!\"  \"The shoe's not very hot; and the blacksmith wouldn't hold it against your hoof long enough to harm you,\" Ebenezer assured him.  Twinkleheels wriggled his nose.  \"I must say I don't care for this smoke,\" he remarked.  \"It's no pleasanter for the blacksmith than for you,\" Ebenezer reminded him. \"If I were you I shouldn't complain. Just see what pretty shoes the blacksmith has made for you!\"  [Illustration: Spot Tells Twinkleheels He is Slow. (Page 90)]  \"They're the nicest I've ever seen,\" Twinkleheels said. \"After I wear them a while and they get shiny on the bottoms, how they will twinkle in the sunlight when I'm trotting along the road!\"  In a few minutes more the blacksmith had nailed all of Twinkleheels' four shoes to his feet. It seemed to Twinkleheels that he could never wait until Ebenezer was shod. He was in a great hurry to get out on the street and show his new shoes to the people in the village.  At last Ebenezer too was fitted out with new shoes. As Farmer Green led him out of the shop, and Johnnie Green led Twinkleheels, a queer look came over Twinkleheels' face.  \"My goodness!\" he cried. \"My feet feel very strange.\"  \"What's the matter?\" Ebenezer asked him. \"Surely your new shoes don't hurt you!\"  \"No! They don't hurt, exactly,\" Twinkleheels replied. \"But my feet feel terribly heavy. These iron shoes aren't as comfortable to wear as I had expected.\"  \"You'll soon get used to them,\" said Ebenezer. \"In a short time you won't know you're wearing shoes--unless you happen to lose one.\"  Twinkleheels had supposed that when they reached Farmer Green's place everybody that he met would speak about his new shoes. But nobody paid any attention to them. Everybody seemed to stare at Johnnie Green as soon as he jumped out of the buggy.  \"Why are folks looking at Johnnie?\" Twinkleheels asked old dog Spot, who had come running up to meet him.  \"Haven't you noticed?\" Spot cried. \"Didn't you _hear_ anything when Johnnie began to walk on the barn floor?\"  \"No!\"  \"Well, you're slow to-day,\" said Spot. \"Johnnie Green's wearing some new shoes that his father bought for him in the village. It's queer that you didn't notice them.... Aren't they nice and squeaky?\"     XIX  THRASHING TIME   The pair of bays were feeling grumpy. Thrashing time had come. And they knew that they would have to spend long hours in the tread mill out in the field, where the oats were stacked. They grumbled a good deal, as they stood in their stalls.  \"I don't see why you object to turning the tread mill for Farmer Green,\" Twinkleheels said to them. \"I'd like to try my hand at it--or my feet, I should say. I should think it would be great fun. Yesterday I saw Johnnie Green and some other boys walking on the tread mill and making it go. They seemed to find it a lark.\"  \"Huh!\" said one of the bays. \"They'd _hate_ it if they had to walk up hill hour after hour and never get anywhere. The noise of the tread mill and the thrashing machine is most unpleasant.\"  \"It wouldn't be so bad,\" said his mate, \"if Farmer Green would let us eat all we wanted of the oats that we help thrash. But he doesn't give us even an extra measure.\"  \"We'd run away,\" remarked the bay that had spoken first, \"except that running away wouldn't do us any good. All our running would only make the mill turn faster.\"  \"We can't even stand still if we want to,\" his mate muttered. \"There's a bar that crosses the top of the tread mill, right in front of us. Farmer Green ties us to it. There we are! When he unlocks the tread mill we have to start walking or we'd slide down backwards; and unless our halters broke, our necks would get a terrible stretching.\"  The old horse Ebenezer, who stood between Twinkleheels and the bays and couldn't miss hearing what was said, looked scornfully at the two grumblers.  \"Think of the oats Farmer Green gives you every day!\" he exclaimed. \"I should suppose you'd be glad to earn some of them."]]]
