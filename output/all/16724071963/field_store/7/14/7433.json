In 1548 a remarkable measure was enacted with this object, not so much, it is to be feared, out of any genuine concern for religion as for the benefit of the fishing community, whose interests had been injuriously affected by recent ecclesiastical changes.  \"Albeit,\" it recites, \"the King's subjects now having a more perfect and clear light of the Gospel and true word of God, through the infinite cleansing and mercy of Almighty God, by the hand of the King's Majesty and his most noble father of famous memory, promulgate, shewed, declared and opened, and thereby perceiving that one day or one kind of meat of itself is not more holy, more pure, or more clean than another, for that all days and all meats be of their nature of one equal purity, cleanness, and holiness, and that all men should by them live to the glory of God, and at all times and for all meats give thanks unto Him, of which meats none can defile Christian men or make them unclean at any time, to whom all meats be lawful and pure, so that they be not used in disobedience or vice; yet forasmuch as divers of the King's subjects turning their knowledge therein to satisfy their sensuality, when they should thereby increase in virtue, have in late time more than in times past, broken and contemned such abstinence which hath been used in the Realm upon the Fridays _and Saturdays_, the Embering days, and other days commonly called Vigils, and in the time commonly called Lent and other accustomed times: the King's Majesty, considering that due and godly abstinence is a means to virtue, and to subdue men's bodies to their soul and spirit, and considering also especially that Fishers, and men using the trade of living by fishing in the sea, may thereby the rather be set on work, and that by eating of fish much flesh shall be saved and increased, and also for divers other considerations and commodities of this realm, doth ordain 'that all statutes and constitutions regarding fasting be repealed, but that all persons neglecting to observe the ordinary fast days--Fridays, _Saturdays_, Ember days, and Lent--be subject to a fine of ten shillings and ten days' imprisonment for the first offence.'\"  This measure, so inconsistent with the spirit of the age and so contradictory in its terms, was re-enacted at various dates during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. It is perhaps the last \"word\" as regards the Lady Fast, but the legislature by no means suspended its vigilance in enforcing abstinence at the proper season. Discussion of post-Reformation fasting, however, or fasting in general, forms no part of our present undertaking.     ECCLESIASTICAL  CHAPTER IV  CHILDREN OF THE CHAPEL   The fact may not have escaped notice that Domina Alicia Seynt Johan de Baggenet \"took the vow of widowhood in the chapel of the Lord of Amberley.\" Possession of a private chapel was, as it still is, a mark of social distinction. \"It was once the constitution of the English,\" runs a law of King Athelstan, \"that the people and their legal condition went according to their merits; and then were the councillors of the nation honoured each one according to his quality, the earl and the ceorl, the thane and the underthane. If a ceorl throve so as to have five hides booked to him, a church, bell-tower, a seat in the borough, and an office in the King's court, from that time forward he was esteemed equal in honour to a thane.\" Again, the laws of King Edgar relating to tithe ordain \"that God's church be entitled to every right, and that every tithe be rendered to the old minster to which the district belongs, and be then so paid, both from the thane's inland and from geneat land, as the plough traverses it. But if there be any thane who on his boc-land has a church at which there is a burial-place, let him give the third part of his own tithe to his church. If anyone hath a church at which there is not a burial-place, then of the same nine parts let him then give to his priest what he will.\"  Domestic chapels were extremely common all through the Middle Ages. In the parish of Tiverton, Devon, there were at least seventeen, some of them within less than a mile of each other. Allusions to these oratories are found in the registers of the Bishops of Exeter, by whom they were severally licensed for the convenience of the owner, his family, and his tenants. As a rule, they were in rooms of the house or castle, not separate buildings. Andrew Boorde, in his directions for the construction of a sixteenth-century mansion, remarks: \"Let the privy chamber be annexed to the great chamber of estate, with other chambers necessary for the building, _so that many of the chambers may have a prospect into the chapel_.\"  Great nobles of the post-Conquest period were not content with the services of a priest only. They maintained an establishment of singing men and boys analogous to the vicars-choral and choristers of the present time, who were described as \"the gentlemen and children of the chapel.\" From the household books of the Earl of Northumberland (A.D. 1510-11) we learn that he had \"daily abidynge in his household--Gentillmen of the Chapel, ix; viz., the maistre of the Childre, j; Tenors, ij; Counter-tenors, iiij; the Pistoler, j; and oone for the Orgayns; Childer of the Chapell, vj.\"  Particulars are recorded of the daily allowances of bread, beer, and fish during Lent. On Scambling Days it was usual not to provide regular meals, each having to scramble or shift for himself, but things were otherwise ordered in the mansion of the Percy, where the service of meat and drink \"upon Scambling Days in Lent yerely\" was properly seen to. Not only are we furnished with the \"Ordre of all suche Braikfasts that shall be lowable daily in my Lordes hous thorowte the yere as well on Flesche days as Fysch days in Lent, and out of Lent,\" but accounts are supplied of the liveries of wine, white wine, and wax, and also of wood and coal, of which the Master and the Children of the Chapel were entitled to one peck _per diem_. The cost of the washing of surplices, etc., was not to exceed a stated sum. \"Then shal be paid for the Holl weshing of all manner of Lynnon belonging to the Lordes Chappell for a Holl yere but xvij_s._ iiij_d._ And to be weshed for every Penny iij Surplesses or iij Albes. And the said Surplesses to be weshed in the yere xvj tymes against these Feasts following,\" &c.  The salaries of the choir were paid at definite intervals, and formed a charge on his lordship's property in Yorkshire. The scale of remuneration was as follows:  \"Gentillmen of the Chappell x (as to saye, Two at x marks a pece, iij at iiij_l._ a pece, Two at v marks a pece, Oon at iiij marks, Oon at xx_s._, and Oon at xx_s._; viz., ij Bassis, ij Tenors and vj Counter-tenors). Childeryn of the Chappell vj, after xxv_s._ a pece. And so the whole somme for full contentacion of the said Chappell wagies for oone hole yere ys--xxxv_l._ xv_s._\"  The gentlemen slept two in a bed, as seems to have been the custom for priests also; the children, three in a bed. (\"There shall be for vj Prests iij Beddes after ij to a Bedde; for x Gentillmen of the Chapell v Beddes, after ij to a Bedde; for vj Children ij Beddes after iij to a Bedde.\")  Not only noblemen, but the Princes of the Church had their private chapels, for which the services of children were retained. George Cavendish, in his \"Life of Wolsey,\" gives a glowing account of the Cardinal's palatial appointments, in the course of which he observes: \"Now I will declare unto you the officers of his chapel and singing men of the same. First he had there a dean, a great divine, and a man of excellent learning; and a sub-dean, a repeater of the choir, a gospeller and epistler of the singing-priests, and a master of the children [therefore, of course, children]; in the vestry a yeoman and two grooms, besides other retainers that came thither at principal feasts.... And as for the furniture of the chapel it passeth my weak capacity to declare the number of the costly ornaments and rich jewels that were occupied in the same, for I have seen in procession about the hall forty-four rich copes of one settle worn, besides the candlesticks and other necessary ornaments to the furniture of the same.\" Such were the sumptuous surroundings in which \"children of the chapel\" were wont sometimes to perform their office.  An element of distinction enjoyed by peer and prelate was not likely to be absent from the first estate of the realm; and, in point of fact, the phrase \"children of the chapel,\" so far as it is known, is more commonly associated with the King's court than any of the castles or episcopal palaces of the land. Certain of the King's \"Gentlemen of the Chapel\" seem to have received payment in money, including extraordinary fees, and provided for themselves, whilst others had board and lodging. The following table, though less complete than the Northumberland accounts, throws light on the rate of requital:                                               _Â£  s. d._    Master of the children, for his wages   and board wages                            30  0  0    Gospeller, for wages,                      13  6  8    Epistoler,  \"    \"                         13  6  8    Verger,     \"    \"                         20  0  0    Yeomen of the Vestry                      {10  0  0                                             {10  0  0    Children of the Chapel, ten                56 13  4  Another ordinance states that \"The Gentlemen of the Chapell, Gospeller, Episteller, and Sergeant of the Vestry shall have from the last day of March forward for their board wages, everie of them, 10_d._ per diem; and the Yeomen and Groomes of the Vestry, everie of them, 2_s._ by the weeke.\" When not on board wages, they had \"Bouche of Court,\" like the physicians. \"Bouche of Court\" signified the daily livery or allowance of food, drink,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19004"],["title","The Customs of Old England (#6)"],["body","fuel, and this, in the case of the Master of the Children, exceeded that of the surgeons to the value of about Â£1 1_s._ per annum. Thus it will be seen that the style \"Gentlemen,\" as applied to the grown-up members of the choir, was not merely complimentary, but indicative of their actual status.  Meals were served at regular hours. \"It is ordeyned that the household, when the hall is kept, shall observe certyne times for dinner and souper as followeth: that is to say, the first dynner in eating dayes to begin at tenn of the clock, or somewhat before; and the first souper at foure of the clock on worke dayes.\"  The duties of the choir also are plainly laid down: \"Forasmuch as it is goodly and honourable that there should be alwayes some divine service in the court ... when his grace keepeth court and specially in riding journeys: it is ordeyned that the master of the children and six men ... shall give their continual attendance in the King's court, and dayly in the absence of the residue of the chappell, to have a masse of our Lady before noone, and on Sundayes and holy dayes masse of the day besides our Lady masse, and an anthem in the afternoone.\"  It was part of the business of the Master of the Children to instruct his young charges in \"grammar, songes, organes, and other vertuous things\"; and, on the whole, the lot of the choristers might have been deemed enviable. It is evident, however, that it was not always regarded in that light, for a custom existed of impressing children. This practice was authorized by a precept of Henry VI. in 1454, and one of its victims was Thomas Tusser, afterwards author of \"Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry,\" who thus alludes to the matter:    There for my voice I must (no choice)   Away of force, like posting horse;   For sundry men had placards then             Such child to take.  Moreover, it has been shrewdly suspected that the whipping-boy, who vicariously atoned for the sins of a prince of the blood--in other words, was thrashed, when he did wrong--was picked from the Children of the Chapel. Certainly Charles I. had such a whipping-boy named Murray; and judging from this instance the expedient was not commended by its results.  Members of the choir were expected to be persons of exemplary life and conversation, to ensure which state of things there was a weekly visitation by the Dean. Every Friday he sought out and avoided from office \"all rascals and hangers upon thys courte.\" The tone of discipline, to conclude from the poems of Hugh Rhodes, was undoubtedly high; and, whatever difficulties he may have encountered in training the boys to his own high standards, his \"Book of Nurture\" must always possess considerable value as a reflex of the moral and social ideals of a Master of the Children in the sixteenth century.  Rhodes's successor in the days of Elizabeth was Richard Edwards, a man of literary taste and the compiler of a \"Paradise of Dainty Devices.\" The Master had now a salary of forty pounds a year; the Gentlemen nineteen pence a day, in addition to board and clothing; and the Children received largesse at high feasts and on occasions when their services were used for purposes apart from their ordinary duties. In this way the Chapel Royal is closely connected with the rise of the English drama. Edwards wrote light pieces for the children to act before Her Majesty, and, encouraged by success, fell to composing set comedies, which were also performed by the boys, under his instructions, in the presence of the Court.  We have limited our retrospect mainly to the Tudor period. As an extension of the subject would call for more space than we have at our disposal, those who desire more information concerning the \"Children of the Chapel\" will do well to consult a recent work entitled \"The King's Musick\" (edited by H. C. de Lafontaine: Novello & Co.), which carries on the record into the age of the Stuarts. Entries cited in this excellent compilation relate to eminent English composers. In December, 1673, for example, there was a \"warrant to pay Henry Purcell, late one of the children of his Majesty's Chappell Royall, whose voyce is changed and gone from the Chappell, the sum of Â£30 by the year, to commence Michaelmas, 1673.\" This was in consequence of the sensible custom of retaining as supernumeraries boys who had given evidence of musical ability. Such is certainly true of Purcell, who, at the early age of eleven, had shown promise of his future career by an ode called \"The Address of the Children of the Chapel Royal to the King and their Master, Captain Cooke, on His Majestie's Birthday, A.D. 1670, composed by Master Purcell, one of the Children of the said Chapel.\"     ECCLESIASTICAL  CHAPTER V  THE BOY-BISHOP   Mention has been made of Hugh Rhodes and his \"Book of Nurture.\" It is pretty evident that this master of music was attached to the older form of faith, since he published in Queen Mary's reign a poem bearing the extravagant title: \"The Song of the Chyld-Bysshop, as it was songe before the Queen's Maiestie in her priuie chamber at her mannour of Saint James in the feeldes on Saynt Nicholas' Day and Innocents' Day this yeare now present by the chylde bisshop of Poules church with his company. Londini in Ã¦dibus Johannis Cawood typographi reginÃ¦, 1555.\" This effusion Warton derides as a \"fulsome panegyric\" on the Queen's devotion; and the censure is not wholly unjust, since the author, without much regard for accuracy, likens that least lovable of our sovereigns to Judith, Esther, and the Blessed Virgin. Meanwhile, who or what was the \"Chyld-Bysshop,\" or, as he is usually styled, the Boy-Bishop?  In the first place it may be noted that the Latin equivalent of the phrase was not, as might be expected, _Episcopus puerilis_, but _Episcopus puerorum_, suggesting that the boy, if boy he was, was elevated above his compeers and possessed perhaps some jurisdiction over them. There is no question of the access of dignity, but the amount of authority enjoyed by him would have depended on the humour of his fellows, and boys are not always docile subjects even of rulers of their own election. This, however, is a minor consideration, since the Boy-Bishop, when we first make his acquaintance, has already emerged from the obscurity of school and playground, and made good his claim to the homage of superiors in age and station. Hence the term \"Boy-Bishop\" appears to define more accurately than its Latin analogue the rank and privileges of the immature prelate.  It seems to lie in the nature of things that the Boy-Bishop was originally an institution of the boys themselves, the chief figure in a game in which they aped, as children so commonly do, the procedure of their elders, and that, in course of time, those elders, for reasons deemed good and sufficient, extended their patronage to the innocent parade, and made it a constituent of their own festal round.  In tracing the migration of the custom from the precincts to the interior of the church we must not forget the tradition of the Roman Saturnalia, with the season and spirit of which it accorded, and to which the Christian festival, with its greater purity and decorum, may have been prescribed as an antidote. The pagan holiday was held on December 17th, and as the Sigillaria formed a continuation of it, the joyous celebration endured a whole week. The Boy-Bishop's term of office was yet longer, extending from St. Nicholas' Day (December 6th) to Holy Innocents' Day (December 28th).  The distinctive feature of the Saturnalia was the inversion of ordinary relationships; the world was turned upside down, and the licence that prevailed, by dint of long usage and inviolable sentiment, imparted to the merry-making a rough and even immoral character. Slaves assumed the position of masters, and masters of slaves; and the general nature of the observance is aptly described by the patron deity in Lucian's play on the subject: \"During my reign of a week no one may attend to his business, but only to drinking, singing, playing, making imaginary kings, playing servants at table with their masters.\"  The advent of Christianity was impotent to arrest the annual scenes of disorder; and, in some form or another--sometimes tolerated, sometimes the object of the Church's anathema--the tradition held its own down through the Dark Ages, and we meet with the substance of the Saturnalia, during the centuries immediately preceding the Reformation, in the burlesque festivals with which the rule of the Boy-Bishop has been often identified. We shall see presently how far this judgment is correct. An example will, no doubt, readily recur to the reader from a source to which we owe so many impressions of the Middle Ages, some true, others false or at least exaggerated--we mean the historical romances of Sir Walter Scott. That writer has introduced into \"The Abbot\" an Abbot of Unreason, and he explains in a note that \"The Roman Catholic Church connived at the frolics of the rude vulgar, who, in almost all Catholic countries, enjoyed, or at least assumed, the privilege of making some Lord of the Revels, who, under the name of the Abbot of Unreason, the Boy-Bishop, or the President of Fools, occupied the churches, profaned the holy places by a mock imitation of the sacred rites, and sang indecent parodies of the hymns of the church.\" The last touch, at any rate, may be safely challenged as untrue, and the whole picture has the appearance of being largely overdrawn. This is certainly the case as regards England, though there is evidence that on the Continent the Boy-Bishop celebration was, at certain times and in certain places, not free from objectionable features. In 1274 the Council of Salzburg was moved to prohibit the \"noxii ludi quos vulgaris eloquentia Episcopus puerorum appellat\" on the ground that they had produced great enormities. Probably this sentence referred to the accessories, such as immoral plays, but it is quite possible that "]]]
