Ask him what those Doernberg-Giardanos are like. And then let me ask you: Suppose some moron fixed up something that would go wrong, or made the wrong kind of a mistake himself, around one of those reactors?\"  It was purely a rhetorical question, but, much later, when he would have time to think about it, Scott Melroy was to wonder if ever in history such a question had been answered so promptly and with such dramatic calamitousness.  Three seconds after he stopped speaking, the lights went out.         *       *       *       *       *  For a moment, they were silent and motionless. Then somebody across the table from Melroy began to say, \"What the devil--?\" Doris Rives, beside him, clutched his arm. At the head of the table, Lyons was fuming impatiently, and Kenneth Leighton snapped a pocket-lighter and held it up.  The Venetian-screened windows across the room faced east. In the flicker of the lighter, Melroy made his way around to them and drew open the slats of one, looking out. Except for the headlights of cars, far down in the street, and the lights of ships in the harbor, the city was completely blacked out. But there was one other, horrible, light far away at the distant tip of Long Island--a huge ball of flame, floating upward at the tip of a column of fiery gas. As he watched, there were twinkles of unbearable brightness at the base of the pillar of fire, spreading into awesome sheet-flashes, and other fireballs soared up. Then the sound and the shock-wave of the first blast reached them.  \"The main power-reactors, too,\" Melroy said to himself, not realizing that he spoke audibly. \"Too well shielded for the blast to get them, but the heat melted the fissionables down to critical mass.\"  Leighton, the lighter still burning, was beside him, now.  \"That's not--God, it can't be anything else! Why, the whole plant's gone! There aren't enough other generators in this area to handle a hundredth of the demand.\"  \"And don't blame that on my alleged strike-breakers,\" Melroy warned. \"They hadn't got security-cleared to enter the reactor area when this happened.\"  \"What do you think happened?\" Cronnin asked. \"One of the Doernberg-Giardanos let go?\"  \"Yes. Your man Crandall. If he survived that, it's his bad luck,\" Melroy said grimly. \"Last night, while Fred Hausinger was pulling the fissionables and radioactives out of the Number One breeder, he found a big nugget of Pu-239, about one-quarter CM. I don't know what was done with it, but I do know that Crandall had the maintenance gang repack that reactor, to keep my people from working on it. Nobody'll ever find out just what happened, but they were in a hurry; they probably shoved things in any old way. Somehow, that big subcritical nugget must have got back in, and the breeding-cans, which were pretty ripe by that time, must have been shoved in too close to it and to one another. You know how fast those D-G's work. It just took this long to build up CM for a bomb-type reaction. You remember what I was saying before the lights went out? Well, it happened. Some moron--some untested and undetected moron--made the wrong kind of a mistake.\"  \"Too bad about Crandall. He was a good kid, only he didn't stop to think often enough,\" Cronnin said. \"Well, I guess the strike's off, now; that's one thing.\"  \"But all those people, out there!\" Womanlike, Doris Rives was thinking particularly rather than generally and of humans rather than abstractions. \"It must have killed everybody for miles around.\"  Sid Keating, Melroy thought. And Joe Ricci, and Ben Puryear, and Steve Chalmers, and all the workmen whom he had brought here from Pittsburgh, to their death. Then he stopped thinking about them. It didn't do any good to think of men who'd been killed; he'd learned that years ago, as a kid second lieutenant in Korea. The people to think about were the millions in Greater New York, and up the Hudson Valley to Albany, and as far south as Trenton, caught without light in the darkness, without heat in the dead of winter, without power in subways and skyscrapers and on railroads and interurban lines.  He turned to the woman beside him.  \"Doris, before you could get your Board of Psychiatry and Neurology diploma, you had to qualify as a regular M.D., didn't you?\" he asked.  \"Why, yes--\"  \"Then you'd better report to the nearest hospital. Any doctor at all is going to be desperately needed, for the next day or so. Me, I still have a reserve major's commission in the Army Corps of Engineers. They're probably calling up reserve officers, with any radios that are still working. Until I hear differently, I'm ordering myself on active duty as of now.\" He looked around. \"Anybody know where the nearest Army headquarters is?\"  \"There's a recruiting station down on the thirty-something floor,\" Quillen said. \"It's probably closed, now, though.\"  \"Ground Defense Command; Midtown City,\" Leighton said. \"They have a medical section of their own; they'll be glad to get Dr. Rives, too.\"  Melroy helped her on with her coat and handed her her handbag, then shrugged into his own overcoat and belted it about him, the weight of the flashlight and the automatic sagging the pockets. He'd need both, the gun as much as the light--New York had more than its share of vicious criminals, to whom this power-failure would be a perfect devilsend. Handing Doris the light, he let her take his left arm. Together, they left the room and went down the hallway to the stairs and the long walk to the darkened street below, into a city that had suddenly been cut off from its very life-energy. A city that had put all its eggs in one basket, and left the basket in the path of any blundering foot."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18953"],["title","The Tale of Dickie Deer Mouse (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: The Tale of Dickie Deer Mouse]  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: \"Why do you want buds?\"]  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  THE TALE OF DICKIE DEER MOUSE  BY ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY  AUTHOR OF THE CUFFY BEAR BOOKS SLEEPY-TIME TALES, ETC.

Throughout Pleasant Valley there was no one else so gentle as he.  To be sure, Jasper Jay wore beautiful--perhaps even gaudy--clothes; but his manners were so shocking that nobody would ever call him a gentleman.  As for Dickie Deer Mouse, he was always tastefully dressed in fawn color and white. And except sometimes in the spring, when he needed a new coat, he was a real joy to see. For he both looked and acted like a well-bred little person.  It is too bad that there were certain reasons--which will appear later--why some of his feathered neighbors did not like him. But even they had to admit that Dickie was a spick-and-span young chap.  Wherever he was white he was white as snow. And many of the wild people wondered how he could scamper so fast through the woods and always keep his white feet spotless.  Possibly it was because his mother had taught him the way when he was young; for his feet--and the under side of him--were white even when he was just a tiny fellow, so young that the top side of him was gray instead of fawn colored.  How his small white feet would twinkle as he frisked about in the shadows of the woods and ran like a squirrel through the trees! And how his sharp little cries would break the wood-silence as he called to his friends in a brisk chatter, which sounded like that of the squirrels, only ever so far away!  In many other ways Dickie Deer Mouse was like Frisky Squirrel himself. Dickie's idea of what a good home ought to be was much the same as Frisky's: they both thought that the deserted nest of one of the big Crow family made as fine a house as any one could want. And they couldn't imagine that any food could possibly be better than nuts, berries and grain.  To be sure, Dickie Deer Mouse liked his nuts to have thin shells. But that was because he was smaller than Frisky; so of course his jaws and teeth were not so strong.  Then, too, Dickie Deer Mouse had a trick of gathering good things to eat, which he hid away in some safe place, so that he would not have to go hungry during the winter, when the snow lay deep upon the ground. And even Frisky Squirrel was no spryer at carrying beechnuts--or any other goody--to his secret cupboard than little white-footed Dickie Deer Mouse.  It was no wonder that Dickie could be cheerful right in the dead of winter, when he had a fine store of the very best that the fields and forest yielded, to keep him sleek and fat and happy. So even on the coldest nights, when the icy wind whipped the tree-tops, and the cold, pale stars peeped down among the branches, Dickie scampered through the woods with his friends and had the gayest of times.  No one would have thought that he had a care in the world.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  II  HUNTING A HOME   Warm weather was at hand. And Dickie Deer Mouse gave up frolicking with his friends for a time, because he needed to find a pleasant place in which to spend the summer.  He had his eye on a nest high in the top of a tall elm, where a certain black rascal known as old Mr. Crow had lived for a long while.  Now, Dickie had heard a bit of gossip, to the effect that the old gentleman had moved to another tree nearer to Farmer Green's cornfield. So Dickie wanted to lose no time. He was afraid that if he waited, some brisk member of the Squirrel family would settle himself in Mr. Crow's old home.  Without telling anybody what was in his head, Dickie Deer Mouse set forth one pleasant, warm night in the direction of the great elm, where he hoped to pass a number of delightful months.  It was some distance to the tall tree. But the night was fine, and Dickie enjoyed his journey, though once he stopped and shivered when he heard the wailing whistle of a screech owl.  \"That's Simon Screecher!\" Dickie Deer Mouse exclaimed under his breath. \"I know his voice. And I hope he won't come this way!\"  Dickie halted for a few minutes, near an old oak with spreading roots, under which he intended to hide in case Simon Screecher should suddenly appear.  But he soon decided that Simon was headed for another part of the woods, for his quavering cry grew fainter and fainter. So Dickie promptly forgot his fright and scampered on again faster than before, to make up the time he had lost.  Though he travelled through the flickering shadows like a brown and white streak, he did not pant the least bit when he reached old Mr. Crow's elm. He did not need to pause at the foot of the tree to get his breath, but scurried up it as if climbing was one of the easiest things he did.  Mr. Crow's big nest was so far from the ground that many people would not have cared to visit it except with the help of an elevator. But Dickie Deer Mouse never stopped to think of such a thing. Of course it would have done him no good, anyway, to wish for an elevator, for there was none in all Pleasant Valley. In fact, even Johnnie Green himself had only heard of--and never seen--one.  It took Dickie Deer Mouse only a few moments to reach the top of the tall elm, where Mr. Crow's bulky nest, built of sticks and lined with grass and moss, rested in a crotch formed by three branches.  Dickie had never before been so close to Mr. Crow's old home. And now he stood still and looked at it with great interest. It was ever so much bigger than he had supposed, and exactly the sort of dwelling--cool and airy--that he had hoped to find for his summer home.  \"I don't see what sort of house the old gentleman can want that would be better than this,\" Dickie Deer Mouse remarked to himself. \"But it is a long way from the cornfield, to be sure.\" And then he climbed quickly up the side of the nest and whisked down inside it.  The next moment a great commotion frightened him nearly out of his wits. A deafening squawking smote Dickie Deer Mouse's big ears. And something struck him a number of blows that knocked his breath quite out of him.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  III  A STARTLED SLEEPER   Of course Dickie Deer Mouse ought not to have been so ready to believe that stray bit of gossip about Mr. Crow. It is true that the old black scamp had _talked_ about moving to a new place nearer Farmer Green's cornfield. But his plan had gone no further than that.  He was sound asleep in his bed when Dickie Deer Mouse jumped down beside him. And when Mr. Crow suddenly waked up it would be very hard to say which of the two was the more startled.  For a few moments Mr. Crow screamed loudly for help. And he flapped and floundered about as if he didn't know which way to turn, nor what to do.  During the uproar Dickie Deer Mouse managed to slip out of Mr. Crow's house without being seen. But he was too polite to run away. Instead of hurrying off to escape a scolding from Mr. Crow he clung to a near-by branch and called as loudly as he could:  \"Don't be alarmed, sir! There's no one here but me. And I ask your pardon for disturbing you.\"  Dickie Deer Mouse had to repeat that speech several times before Mr. Crow noticed him. But at last the old gentleman caught sight of his visitor. And when he heard what Dickie said he looked far from pleasant.  \"_Asking_ my pardon is one thing,\" Mr. Crow spluttered. \"And _receiving_ it is another.\"  \"I'm very sorry,\" Dickie Deer Mouse replied. \"I didn't mean to frighten you.\"  Mr. Crow gave a sudden hoarse _haw-haw_.  \"Pooh!\" he cried. \"You don't think I was scared, do you?\"  \"You called for help,\" Dickie reminded him.  \"Certainly I did,\" Mr. Crow agreed. \"I wanted somebody to help you out of my house, before I trampled on you and broke one of your legs--or maybe two or three of 'em.\"  That explanation gave Dickie Deer Mouse another surprise; for he had supposed all the time that Mr. Crow didn't know who--or what--had awakened him.  \"Oh!\" he cried. \"I thought that you thought I was somebody else.\"  Mr. Crow glared at him.  \"I thought that you thought that I thought----\" he squalled. He was so angry that his tongue became sadly twisted; and he all but choked.  Meanwhile Dickie Deer Mouse waited respectfully until Mr. Crow had recovered his speech.  \"What are"]]]
