It had been twenty minutes since he had backed the jeep into the barn, on that distant other time-line; the same delicate lines of white cirrus were etched across the blue above. The constancy of the weather, even across two hundred thousand parayears of perpendicular time, never failed to impress him. The long curve of the mountains was the same, and they were mottled with the same autumn colors, but where the little village of Rutter's Fort stood on that other line of probability, the white towers of an apartment-city rose--the living quarters of the plant personnel.  The rocket that was to take him to headquarters was being hoisted with a crane and lowered into the firing-stand, and he walked briskly toward it, his rifle and musette slung. A boyish-looking pilot was on the platform, opening the door of the rocket; he stood aside for Verkan Vall to enter, then followed and closed it, dogging it shut while his passenger stowed his bag and rifle and strapped himself into a seat.  \"Dhergabar Commercial Terminal, sir?\" the pilot asked, taking the adjoining seat at the controls.  \"Paratime Police Field, back of the Paratime Administration Building.\"  \"Right, sir. Twenty seconds to blast, when you're ready.\"  \"Ready now.\" Verkan Vall relaxed, counting seconds subconsciously.  The rocket trembled, and Verkan Vall felt himself being pushed gently back against the upholstery. The seats, and the pilot's instrument panel in front of them, swung on gimbals, and the finger of the indicator swept slowly over a ninety-degree arc as the rocket rose and leveled. By then, the high cirrus clouds Verkan Vall had watched from the field were far below; they were well into the stratosphere.  There would be nothing to do, now, for the three hours in which the rocket sped northward across the pole and southward to Dhergabar; the navigation was entirely in the electronic hands of the robot controls. Verkan Vall got out his pipe and lit it; the pilot lit a cigarette.  \"That's an odd pipe, sir,\" the pilot said. \"Out-time item?\"  \"Yes, Fourth Probability Level; typical of the whole paratime belt I was working in.\" Verkan Vall handed it over for inspection. \"The bowl's natural brier-root; the stem's a sort of plastic made from the sap of certain tropical trees. The little white dot is the maker's trademark; it's made of elephant tusk.\"  \"Sounds pretty crude to me, sir.\" The pilot handed it back. \"Nice workmanship, though. Looks like good machine production.\"  \"Yes. The sector I was on is really quite advanced, for an electro-chemical civilization. That weapon I brought back with me--that solid-missile projector--is typical of most Fourth Level culture. Moving parts machined to the closest tolerances, and interchangeable with similar parts of all similar weapons. The missile is a small bolt of cupro-alloy coated lead, propelled by expanding gases from the ignition of some nitro-cellulose compound. Most of their scientific advance occurred within the past century, and most of that in the past forty years. Of course, the life-expectancy on that level is only about seventy years.\"  \"Humph! I'm seventy-eight, last birthday,\" the boyish-looking pilot snorted. \"Their medical science must be mostly witchcraft!\"  \"Until quite recently, it was,\" Verkan Vall agreed. \"Same story there as in everything else--rapid advancement in the past few decades, after thousands of years of cultural inertia.\"  \"You know, sir, I don't really understand this paratime stuff,\" the pilot confessed. \"I know that all time is totally present, and that every moment has its own past-future line of event-sequence, and that all events in space-time occur according to maximum probability, but I just don't get this alternate probability stuff, at all. If something exists, it's because it's the maximum-probability effect of prior causes; why does anything else exist on any other time-line?\"  Verkan Vall blew smoke at the air-renovator. A lecture on paratime theory would nicely fill in the three-hour interval until the landing at Dhergabar. At least, this kid was asking intelligent questions.  \"Well, you know the principal of time-passage, I suppose?\" he began.  \"Yes, of course; Rhogom's Doctrine. The basis of most of our psychical science. We exist perpetually at all moments within our life-span; our extraphysical ego component passes from the ego existing at one moment to the ego existing at the next. During unconsciousness, the EPC is 'time-free'; it may detach, and connect at some other moment, with the ego existing at that time-point. That's how we precog. We take an autohypno and recover memories brought back from the future moment and buried in the subconscious mind.\"  \"That's right,\" Verkan Vall told him. \"And even without the autohypno, a lot of precognitive matter leaks out of the subconscious and into the conscious mind, usually in distorted forms, or else inspires 'instinctive' acts, the motivation for which is not brought to the level of consciousness. For instance, suppose, you're walking along North Promenade, in Dhergabar, and you come to the Martian Palace Caf√©, and you go in for a drink, and meet some girl, and strike up an acquaintance with her. This chance acquaintance develops into a love affair, and a year later, out of jealousy, she rays you half a dozen times with a needler.\"  \"Just about that happened to a friend of mine, not long ago,\" the pilot said. \"Go on, sir.\"  \"Well, in the microsecond or so before you die--or afterward, for that matter, because we know that the extraphysical component survives physical destruction--your EPC slips back a couple of years, and re-connects at some point pastward of your first meeting with this girl, and carries with it memories of everything up to the moment of detachment, all of which are indelibly recorded in your subconscious mind. So, when you re-experience the event of standing outside the Martian Palace with a thirst, you go on to the Starway, or Nhergal's, or some other bar. In both cases, on both time-lines, you follow the line of maximum probability; in the second case, your subconscious future memories are an added causal factor.\"  \"And when I back-slip, after I've been needled, I generate a new time-line? Is that it?\"  Verkan Vall made a small sound of impatience. \"No such thing!\" he exclaimed. \"It's semantically inadmissible to talk about the total presence of time with one breath and about generating new time-lines with the next. _All_ time-lines are totally present, in perpetual co-existence. The theory is that the EPC passes from one moment, on one time-line, to the next moment on the next line, so that the true passage of the EPC from moment to moment is a two-dimensional diagonal. So, in the case we're using, the event of your going into the Martian Palace exists on one time-line, and the event of your passing along to the Starway exists on another, but both are events in real existence.  \"Now, what we do, in paratime transposition, is to build up a hypertemporal field to include the time-line we want to reach, and then shift over to it. Same point in the plenum; same point in primary time--plus primary time elapsed during mechanical and electronic lag in the relays--but a different line of secondary time.\"  \"Then why don't we have past-future time travel on our own time-line?\" the pilot wanted to know.  That was a question every paratimer has to answer, every time he talks paratime to the laity. Verkan Vall had been expecting it; he answered patiently.  \"The Ghaldron-Hesthor field-generator is like every other mechanism; it can operate only in the area of primary time in which it exists. It can transpose to any other time-line, and carry with it anything inside its field, but it can't go outside its own temporal area of existence, any more than a bullet from that rifle can hit the target a week before it's fired,\" Verkan Vall pointed out. \"Anything inside the field is supposed to be unaffected by anything outside. _Supposed to be_ is the way to put it; it doesn't always work. Once in a while, something pretty nasty gets picked up in transit.\" He thought, briefly, of the man in the black tunic. \"That's why we have armed guards at terminals.\"  \"Suppose you pick up a blast from a nucleonic bomb,\" the pilot asked, \"or something red-hot, or radioactive?\"  \"We have a monument, at Paratime Police Headquarters, in Dhergabar, bearing the names of our own personnel who didn't make it back. It's a large monument; over the past ten thousand years, it's been inscribed with quite a few names.\"  \"You can have it; I'll stick to rockets!\" the pilot replied. \"Tell me another thing, though: What's all this about levels, and sectors, and belts? What's the difference?\"  \"Purely arbitrary terms. There are five main probability levels, derived from the five possible outcomes of the attempt to colonize this planet, seventy-five thousand years ago. We're on the First Level--complete success, and colony fully established. The Fifth Level is the probability of complete failure--no human population established on this planet, and indigenous quasi-human life evolved indigenously. On the Fourth Level, the colonists evidently met with some disaster and lost all memory of their extraterrestrial origin, as well as all extraterrestrial culture. As far as they know, they are an indigenous race; they have a long pre-history of stone-age savagery.  \"Sectors are areas of paratime on any level in which the prevalent culture has a common origin and common characteristics. They are divided more or less arbitrarily into sub-sectors. Belts are areas within sub-sectors where conditions are the result of recent alternate probabilities. For instance, I've just come from the Europo-American Sector of the Fourth Level, an area of about ten thousand parayears"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19067"],["title","Police Operation (#3)"],["body"," depth, in which the dominant civilization developed on the North-West Continent of the Major Land Mass, and spread from there to the Minor Land Mass. The line on which I was operating is also part of a sub-sector of about three thousand parayears' depth, and a belt developing from one of several probable outcomes of a war concluded about three elapsed years ago. On that time-line, the field at the Hagraban Synthetics Works, where we took off, is part of an abandoned farm; on the site of Hagraban City is a little farming village. Those things are there, right now, both in primary time and in the plenum. They are about two hundred and fifty thousand parayears perpendicular to each other, and each is of the same general order of reality.\"  The red light overhead flashed on. The pilot looked into his visor and put his hands to the manual controls, in case of failure of the robot controls. The rocket landed smoothly, however; there was a slight jar as it was grappled by the crane and hoisted upright, the seats turning in their gimbals. Pilot and passenger unstrapped themselves and hurried through the refrigerated outlet and away from the glowing-hot rocket.         *       *       *       *       *  An air-taxi, emblazoned with the device of the Paratime Police, was waiting. Verkan Vall said good-by to the rocket-pilot and took his seat beside the pilot of the aircab; the latter lifted his vehicle above the building level and then set it down on the landing-stage of the Paratime Police Building in a long, side-swooping glide. An express elevator took Verkan Vall down to one of the middle stages, where he showed his sigil to the guard outside the door of Tortha Karf's office and was admitted at once.  The Paratime Police chief rose from behind his semicircular desk, with its array of keyboards and viewing-screens and communicators. He was a big man, well past his two hundredth year; his hair was iron-gray and thinning in front, he had begun to grow thick at the waist, and his calm features bore the lines of middle age. He wore the dark-green uniform of the Paratime Police.  \"Well, Vall,\" he greeted. \"Everything secure?\"  \"Not exactly, sir.\" Verkan Vall came around the desk, deposited his rifle and bag on the floor, and sat down in one of the spare chairs. \"I'll have to go back again.\"  \"So?\" His chief lit a cigarette and waited.  \"I traced Gavran Sarn.\" Verkan Vall got out his pipe and began to fill it. \"But that's only the beginning. I have to trace something else. Gavran Sarn exceeded his Paratime permit, and took one of his pets along. A Venusian nighthound.\"  Tortha Karf's expression did not alter; it merely grew more intense. He used one of the short, semantically ugly terms which serve, in place of profanity, as the emotional release of a race that has forgotten all the taboos and terminologies of supernaturalistic religion and sex-inhibition.  \"You're sure of this, of course.\" It was less a question than a statement.  Verkan Vall bent and took cloth-wrapped objects from his bag, unwrapping them and laying them on the desk. They were casts, in hard black plastic, of the footprints of some large three-toed animal.  \"What do these look like, sir?\" he asked.  Tortha Karf fingered them and nodded. Then he became as visibly angry as a man of his civilization and culture-level ever permitted himself.  \"What does that fool think we have a Paratime Code for?\" he demanded. \"It's entirely illegal to transpose any extraterrestrial animal or object to any time-line on which space-travel is unknown. I don't care if he is a green-seal thavrad; he'll face charges, when he gets back, for this!\"  \"He _was_ a green-seal thavrad,\" Verkan Vall corrected. \"And he won't be coming back.\"  \"I hope you didn't have to deal summarily with him,\" Tortha Karf said. \"With his title, and social position, and his family's political importance, that might make difficulties. Not that it wouldn't be all right with me, of course, but we never seem to be able to make either the Management or the public realize the extremities to which we are forced, at times.\" He sighed. \"We probably never shall.\"  Verkan Vall smiled faintly. \"Oh, no, sir; nothing like that. He was dead before I transposed to that time-line. He was killed when he wrecked a self-propelled vehicle he was using. One of those Fourth Level automobiles. I posed as a relative and tried to claim his body for the burial-ceremony observed on that cultural level, but was told that it had been completely destroyed by fire when the fuel tank of this automobile burned. I was given certain of his effects which had passed through the fire; I found his sigil concealed inside what appeared to be a cigarette case.\" He took a green disk from the bag and laid it on the desk. \"There's no question; Gavran Sarn died in the wreck of that automobile.\"  \"And the nighthound?\"  \"It was in the car with him, but it escaped. You know how fast those things are. I found that track\"--he indicated one of the black casts--\"in some dried mud near the scene of the wreck. As you see, the cast is slightly defective. The others were fresh this morning, when I made them.\"  \"And what have you done so far?\"  \"I rented an old farm near the scene of the wreck, and installed my field-generator there. It runs through to the Hagraban Synthetics Works, about a hundred miles east of Thalna-Jarvizar. I have my this-line terminal in the girls' rest room at the durable plastics factory; handled that on a local police-power writ. Since then, I've been hunting for the nighthound. I think I can find it, but I'll need some special equipment, and a hypno-mech indoctrination. That's why I came back.\"  \"Has it been attracting any attention?\" Tortha Karf asked anxiously.  \"Killing cattle in the locality; causing considerable excitement. Fortunately, it's a locality of forested mountains and valley farms, rather than a built-up industrial district. Local police and wild-game protection officers are concerned; all the farmers excited, and going armed. The theory is that it's either a wildcat of some sort, or a maniac armed with a cutlass. Either theory would conform, more or less, to the nature of its depredations. Nobody has actually seen it.\"  \"That's good!\" Tortha Karf was relieved. \"Well, you'll have to go and bring it out, or kill it and obliterate the body. You know why, as well as I do.\"  \"Certainly, sir,\" Verkan Vall replied. \"In a primitive culture, things like this would be assigned supernatural explanations, and imbedded in the locally accepted religion. But this culture, while nominally religious, is highly rationalistic in practice. Typical lag-effect, characteristic of all expanding cultures. And this Europo-American Sector really has an expanding culture. A hundred and fifty years ago, the inhabitants of this particular time-line didn't even know how to apply steam power; now they've begun to release nuclear energy, in a few crude forms.\"  Tortha Karf whistled, softly. \"That's quite a jump. There's a sector that'll be in for trouble, in the next few centuries.\"  \"That is realized, locally, sir.\" Verkan Vall concentrated on relighting his pipe, for a moment, then continued: \"I would predict space-travel on that sector within the next century. Maybe the next half-century, at least to the Moon. And the art of taxidermy is very highly developed. Now, suppose some farmer shoots that thing; what would he do with it, sir?\"  Tortha Karf grunted. \"Nice logic, Vall. On a most uncomfortable possibility. He'd have it mounted, and it'd be put in a museum, somewhere. And as soon as the first spaceship reaches Venus, and they find those things in a wild state, they'll have the mounted specimen identified.\"  \"Exactly. And then, instead of beating their brains about _where_ their specimen came from, they'll begin asking _when_ it came from. They're quite capable of such reasoning, even now.\"  \"A hundred years isn't a particularly long time,\" Tortha Karf considered. \"I'll be retired, then, but you'll have my job, and it'll be your headache. You'd better get this cleaned up, now, while it can be handled. What are you going to do?\"  [Illustration]  \"I'm not sure, now, sir. I want a hypno-mech indoctrination, first.\" Verkan Vall gestured toward the communicator on the desk. \"May I?\" he asked.  \"Certainly.\" Tortha Karf slid the instrument across the desk. \"Anything you want.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\" Verkan Vall snapped on the code-index, found the symbol he wanted, and then punched it on the keyboard. \"Special Chief's Assistant Verkan Vall,\" he identified himself. \"Speaking from office of Tortha Karf, Chief Paratime Police. I want a complete hypno-mech on Venusian nighthounds, emphasis on wild state, special emphasis domesticated nighthounds reverted to wild state in terrestrial surroundings, extra-special emphasis hunting techniques applicable to same. The word 'nighthound' will do for trigger-symbol.\" He turned to Tortha Karf. \"Can I take it here?\"  Tortha Karf nodded, pointing to a row of booths along the far wall of the office.  \"Make set-up for wired transmission; I'll take it here.\"  \"Very well, sir; in fifteen minutes,\" a voice replied out of the communicator.  Verkan Vall slid the communicator back. \"By the way, sir; I had a hitchhiker, on the way back. Carried him about a hundred or so parayears; picked him up about three hundred parayears after leaving my other-line terminal. Nasty-looking fellow, in a black uniform; looked like one of these private-army storm troopers you find all through that sector. Armed, and hostile. I thought I'd have to ray him, but he blundered outside the field almost at once. I have a record, if you'd care to see it.\"  \"Yes, put it on,\" Tortha Karf gestured toward the solidograph-projector. \"It's set for miniature reproduction here on the desk; that be all right?\"  Verkan Vall nodded, getting out the film and loading it into the projector. When he pressed a button, a dome of radiance appeared on the desk top; two"]]]
