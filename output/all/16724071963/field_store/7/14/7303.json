FORESTERS  BY FRANCIS ROLT-WHEELER  With Thirty-eight Illustrations from Photographs taken by the U. S. Forest Service  BOSTON  LOTHROP, LEE & SHEPARD CO.  1910     To My Son Roger's Friend  WILBUR UFFORD     PREFACE   Much of the wilderness is yet but little trod. Great stretches of virgin forest still remain within whose dim recesses nothing is changed since the days the Indians dwelt in them. The mystery and the adventure are not sped, the grandeur and the companionship still pulse among the glades, the \"call of the wild\" is an unceasing cry, and to that call the boy responds.  But if this impulse to return to the shelter of the wilds be still so strong, how greatly more intense does it become when we awaken to the fact that the forest needs our help even more than we need its sense of freedom. When we perceive that the fate of these great belts of untamed wilderness lies in the hands of a small group of men whose mastery is absolute, when first we realize that national benefits--great almost beyond the believing--are intrusted to these men, surely Desire and Duty leap to grip hands and pledge themselves to the service of the forests of our land. To breathe the magnificent spaces of the West, to reveal the wealth and beauty of our great primeval woods, to acclaim the worth of the men who administer them, and to show splendid possibilities to a lad of grit and initiative is the aim and purpose of  THE AUTHOR.

FORESTERS   CHAPTER I  ENTERING THE SERVICE   \"Hey, Wilbur, where are you headed for?\"  The boy addressed, who had just come through the swing-doors of an office building in Washington, did not slacken his pace on hearing the question, but called back over his shoulder:  \"To the forest, of course. Come along, Fred.\"  \"But--\" The second speaker stopped short, and, breaking into a run, caught up with his friend in a few steps.  \"You certainly seem to be in a mighty big hurry to get there,\" he said.  \"We don't loaf on our service,\" answered the boy with an air of pride.  His friend broke into a broad grin. He had known Wilbur Loyle for some time, and was well aware of his enthusiastic nature.  \"How long has it been 'our' service?\" he queried, emphasizing the pronoun.  \"Ever since I was appointed,\" rejoined Wilbur exultantly.  \"I'm glad the appointment has had time to soak in; it didn't take long, did it?\" Wilbur flushed a little, and his chum, seeing this, went on laughingly: \"Don't mind my roasting, old man, only you were 'way up in the clouds.\"  The boy's expression cleared instantaneously, and he laughed in reply.  \"I suppose I was,\" he said, \"but it's great to feel you've got the thing you've been working for. As you know, Fred, I've been thinking of this for years; in fact, I've always wanted it, and I've worked hard to get it. And then the Chief Forester's fine; he's just fine; I liked him ever so much.\"  \"Did you have much chance to talk with him?\"  \"Yes, quite a lot. I thought I was likely enough to meet him, and p'raps he would formally tell me I was appointed and then bow me out of the office. Not a bit of it. He told me all about the Service, showed me just what there was in it for the country, and I tell you what--he made me feel that I wanted to go right straight out on the street and get all the other boys to join.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well, he showed me that the Forest Service gave a fellow a chance to make good even better than in the army or the navy. There you have to follow orders mainly; there's that deadly routine besides, and you don't get much of a chance to think for yourself; but in the Forest Service a chap is holding down a place of trust where he has a show to make good by working it out for himself.\"  \"Sounds all right,\" said the older boy. \"Anyway, I'm glad if you're glad.\"  \"What I like about it,\" went on Wilbur, \"is the bigness of the whole thing and the chance a chap has to show what he's made of. Glad? You bet I'm glad!\"  \"You weren't so sure whether you were going to like it or not when you went in to see about it,\" said Fred.  \"Oh, yes, I was. I knew I was going to like it all right. But I didn't know anything about where I might be sent or how I would be received.\"  \"I think it's just ripping,\" said his friend, \"that it looks so good to you, starting out. It makes a heap of difference, sometimes, how a thing begins.\"  \"It surely does. Right now, the whole thing seems too good to be true.\"  \"Well,\" said the other, \"as long as it strikes you that way I suppose you're satisfied now for all the grind you did preparing for it. But I don't believe it would suit me. It might be all right to be a Forest Ranger, but you told me one time that you had to start in as a Fire Guard, a sort of Fire Policeman, didn't you?\"  \"Sure!\"  \"Well, that doesn't sound particularly exciting.\"  \"Why not? What more excitement do you want than a forest fire! Isn't that big enough for you?\"  \"The fire would be all right,\" answered the older boy, \"but it's the watching and waiting for it that would get me.\"  \"You can't expect to have adventures every minute anywhere,\" said Wilbur, \"but even so, you're not standing on one spot like a sailor in a crow's nest, waiting for something to happen; you're in the saddle, riding from point to point all day long, sometimes when there is a trail and sometimes when there isn't, out in the real woods, not in poky, stuffy city streets. You know, Fred, I can't stand the city; I always feel as if I couldn't breathe.\"  \"All right, Wilbur,\" said the other, \"it's your own lookout, I suppose. Me for the city, though.\"  Just then, and before Fred could make any further reply, a hand was laid on Wilbur's shoulder, and the lad, looking around, found the Chief Forester walking beside them.  \"Trying to make converts already, Loyle?\" he asked with a smile, nodding pleasantly to the lad's companion.  \"I was trying to, sir,\" answered the boy, \"but I don't believe Fred would ever make one of us.\"  The Chief Forester restrained all outward trace of amusement at the lad's unconscious coupling of the head of the service and the newest and youngest assistant, and, turning to the older boy, said questioningly:  \"Why not, Fred?\"  \"I was just saying to Wilbur, sir,\" he replied in a stolid manner, \"that a Forest Guard's life didn't sound particularly exciting. It might be all right when a fire came along, but I should think that it would be pretty dull waiting for it, week after week.\"  \"Not exciting enough?\" The boys were nearly taken off their feet by the energy of the speaker. \"Not when every corner you turn may show you smoke on the horizon? Not when every morning finds you at a different part of the forest and you can't get there quick enough to convince yourself that everything is all right? Not when you plunge down ravines, thread your way through and over fallen timber, and make up time by a sharp gallop wherever there's a clearing, knowing that every cabin you pass is depending for its safety on your care? And then that is only a small part of the work. If you can't find excitement enough in that, you can't find it in anything.\"  \"Yes--\" began Fred dubiously, but the Chief Forester continued:  \"And as for the responsibility! I tell you, the forest is the place for that. We need men there, not machines. On the men in the forest millions of dollars' worth of property depends. More than that, on the care of the Forest Guards hangs perhaps the stopping of a forest fire that otherwise would ravage the countryside, kill the young forest, denude the hills of soil, choke with mud the rivers that drain the denuded territory, spoil the navigable harbors, and wreck the prosperity of all the towns and villages throughout that entire river's length.\"  \"I hadn't realized there was so much in it,\" replied Fred, evidently struck with the Forester's earnestness.  \"You haven't any idea of how much there is in it. Not only for the work itself, but for you. Wild horses can't drag a man out of the Service once he's got in. It has a fascination peculiarly its own. The eager expectancy of vast spaces, the thrill of adventure in riding off to parts where man seldom treads, and the magnificent independence of the frontiersman, all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18874"],["title","The Boy With the U. S. Foresters (#1)"],["body","become the threads of which your daily life is made.\"  \"It sounds fine when you put it that way, sir,\" said Fred, his eyes kindling at the picture. \"But it's hardly like that at first, is it?\"  \"Certainly it is! Does the life of a fireman in a big city fire department strike you as being interesting or exciting?\"  \"Oh, yes, sir!\"  \"It isn't to be compared with that of the Forest Guard. A city fireman is only one of a company huddled together in a little house, not greatly busy until the fire telegraph signal rings. But suppose there were only one fireman for the whole city, that he alone were responsible for the safety of every house, that instead of telegraphic signaling he must depend on his trusty horse to carry him to suitable vantage points, and on his eyesight when there; suppose that he knew there was a likelihood of fire every hour out of the twenty-four, and that during the season he could be sure of two or three a week, don't you think that fireman would have a lively enough time of it?\"  \"He surely would,\" said Wilbur.  \"Aside from the fact that there are not as many people involved, that's not unlike a Forest Guard's position. I tell you, he's not sitting around his shack trying to kill time.\" Then, turning sharply to the older boy, the Chief Forester continued:  \"What do you want to be?\"  \"I had wanted to be a locomotive engineer, sir,\" was the boy's reply, \"but now I think I'll stay in the city.\"  \"It was the excitement of the life that appealed to you, was it?\"  \"Yes, sir. I guess so.\"  \"True, there's a good deal of responsibility there, when you stand with your hand on the throttle of a fast express, knowing that the lives of the passengers are in your hand. There's a good deal of pride, too, in steering a vessel through a dangerous channel or in a stormy sea; there's a thrill of power when you sight a big gun and know that if you were in warfare the defense of your country might lie in your skill and aim. But none of these is greater than the sense of power and trust reposing in the men of the Forest Service, to whom Uncle Sam gives the guardianship and safe-keeping of millions of acres of his property and the lives of thousands of his citizens.\"  The Chief Forester watched the younger of his companions, who was striding along the Washington street, and casting rapid glances from building to building as he went along, as though he expected to see flame and smoke pouring from every window, and that the city's safety lay in his hands. Smiling slightly, very slightly, and addressing himself to the older boy, although it was for the benefit of his new assistant that he was speaking, the Forester continued:  \"It's really more like the work of a trusted army scout than anything else. In the old days of Indian warfare,\"--both boys gave a quick start of increased attention--\"the very finest men and the most to be trusted were the scouts. They were men of great bravery, of undaunted loyalty, of great wariness, and filled with the spirit of dashing adventure. They were men who took their lives in their own hands. Going before the main body of the army, single-handed, if need be, they would stave off the attacks of Indian foes and would do battle with outposts and pickets. If the force were too great, they would map out the lay of the land and devise a strategical plan of attack, then, without rest or food often, would steal back to the main body, and, laying their information in the hands of the general, would act as guides if he ordered a forward movement.\"  \"But how--\" interrupted Fred.  \"I was just coming to that,\" replied the Forester in response to his half-uttered query. \"A Forest Guard is really a Forest Scout. There have been greater massacres at the hands of the Fire Tribe than from any Indian tribe that ever roamed the prairies. Hundreds, yes, thousands of lives were lost in the days before the Forest Service was in existence by fires which Forest Scouts largely could have prevented. Why, I myself can recall seeing a fire in which nearly a thousand and a half persons perished.\"  \"In one fire?\"  \"Just in one fire. What would you think if you were told that in a forest in front of you were several thousand savages, all with their war-paint on, waiting a chance to break forth on the villages of the plain, that you had been chosen for the post of honor in guarding that strip of plain, and that the lives of those near by depended on your alertness? If they had picked you out for that difficult and important post, do you think that you would go and stand your rifle up against a tree and look for some soft nice mossy bank on which to lie down and go to sleep?\"  \"I'd stay on the job till I dropped,\" answered Wilbur quickly and aggressively.  \"There's really very little difference between the two positions,\" said the Chief Forester. \"No band of painted savages can break forth from a forest with more appalling fury than can a fire, none is more difficult to resist, none can carry the possibility of torture to its hapless victims more cruelly, none be so deaf to cries of mercy as a fire. Instead of keeping your ears open for a distant war-whoop, you have to keep your eyes open for the thin up-wreathing curl of smoke by day, or the red glow and flickering flame at night, which tells that the time has come for you to show what stuff you are made of. On the instant must you start for the fire, though it may be miles away, crossing, it may be, a part of the forest through which no trail has been made, plunging through streams which under less urgency would make you hesitate to try them, single-handed and 'all on your own,' to fight Uncle Sam's battles against his most dangerous and most insistent foe.\"  \"But if you can't put it out?\" suggested Fred.  \"It has got to be put out,\" came the sharp reply, with an insistence of manner that told even more than the words. \"There isn't anything else to it. If you have to get back to headquarters or send word there, if all the Rangers in the forest have to be summoned, if you have to ride to every settlement, ranch, and shack on the range, yes, if you have to rouse up half the State, this one thing is sure--the fire has got to be put out.\"  \"But can you get help?\"  \"Nearly always. In the first place, the danger is mutual and everybody near the forest or in it will suffer if the fire spreads. In the second place, the Service is ready to pay men a fair wage for the time consumed in putting out a fire, and even the Ranger has the right to employ men to a limited extent. Sometimes the blaze can be stopped without great difficulty, at other times it will require all the resources available under the direction of the Forest Supervisor, but in the first resort it depends largely upon the Guard. A young fellow who is careless in such a post as that is as great a traitor to his country as a soldier would be who sold to the enemy the plans of the fort he was defending, or a sailor who left the wheel while a battle-ship was threading a narrow and rocky channel.\"  \"What starts these forest fires, sir?\" asked Fred.  \"All sorts of things, but most of them arise from one common cause--carelessness. There are quite a number of instances in which fires have been started by lightning, but they are few in number as compared with those due to human agency. The old tale of fires being caused by two branches of a dead tree rubbing against each other is, of course, a fable.\"  \"But I should think any one would know enough not to start a forest fire,\" exclaimed the older boy. \"I'm not much on the woods, but I think I know enough for that.\"  \"It isn't deliberate, it's careless,\" repeated the Forester. \"Sometimes a camper leaves a little fire smoldering when he thinks the last spark is out; sometimes settlers who have to burn over their clearings allow the blaze to get away from them; when Indians are in the neighborhood they receive a large share of the blame, and the hated tramp is always quoted as a factor of mischief. In earlier days, sparks from locomotives were a constant danger, and although the railroad companies use a great many precautions now to which formerly they paid no heed, these sparks and cinders are still a prolific cause of trouble. And beside this carelessness, there is a good deal of inattention and neglect. The settlers will let a little fire burn for days unheeded, waiting for a rain to come along and put it out, whereas if a drought ensues and a high wind comes up, a fire may arise that will leap through the forest and leave them homeless, and possibly even their own lives may have to pay the penalty of their recklessness.\"  \"But what I don't understand,\" said Fred, \"is how people get caught. It's easy enough to see how a forest could be destroyed, but I should think that every one could get out of the way easily enough. It must take a tree a long while to burn, even after it gets alight, especially if it's a big one.\"  \"A big forest fire, fanned by a high wind, and in the dry season,\" answered the Chief Forester, \"could catch the fastest runner in a few minutes. The flames repeatedly have been known to overtake horses on the gallop, and where there are no other means of escape the peril is extreme.\"  \"But will green trees burn so fast?\" the older boy queried in surprise. \"I should have thought they were so full of sap that they wouldn't burn at all.\"  \"The wood and foliage of coniferous trees like spruce, fir, and pine are so full of turpentine and resin that they burn like tinder. The heat is almost beyond the power of words to express. The fire does not seem to burn in a steady manner, the flames just breathe upon an immense tree and it becomes a blackened skeleton which will burn for hours.  \"The actual temperature in advance of the fire is so terrific that the woods begin to dry and to release inflammable vapors before the flames reach them, when they flash up and add their force to the fiery hurricane. It is almost unbelievable, too, the way a crown-fire will"]]]
