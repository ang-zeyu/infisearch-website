Mrs. Pemberton descended the stairs, followed by Susan and Fred, who had just returned from the front window, where he had exhibited the flag, which the crowd outside were still cheering.  \"Who can it be?\" continued the old lady, as she slowly and cautiously walked forward to the scene of the catastrophe.  \"I don't know,\" replied the squire, in whom the presence of his family had spurred up a semblance of courage; for if a man ever is brave, it is in the presence of his wife and children. \"If it is one of the ruffians who came here to destroy my house, I am glad he has lost his life in the attempt. It is a righteous retribution upon him for his wickedness.\"  Mrs. Pemberton took the lantern, and the squire, still excited and terrified, bent over the prostrate form of the young marauder. The victim lay upon his face, and the squire had to turn him over to obtain a view of his countenance.  \"I declare it is one of the Somers boys!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pemberton, as her husband brought the face of Thomas to her view.  \"The young villain!\" ejaculated the squire. \"It is lucky he was killed, or the house would have been in flames before this time. He is a desperate young scoundrel.\"  \"But he isn't dead, father!\" said Mrs. Pemberton, as she knelt upon the cold ground, and felt the pulse of the insensible boy. \"He is only stunned.\"  \"I am sorry for it. If it had killed him, it would have served him right,\" added the squire, who had suddenly become as bold as a lion--as bold as two lions.  \"Come, father, let's carry him up stairs, and put him to bed.\"  \"Do you think I am going to do anything for this young scoundrel!\" exclaimed the squire, indignantly. \"Why, he stoned Fred and me to-day, and stoned the horse, and made him run away and break the chaise all to pieces.\"  \"But we mustn't leave him here in this situation. He may die.\"  \"Let him die.\"  \"But what will folks say?\"  The more humane wife evidently understood the weak point of the squire, for nothing but slavery and the Southern Confederacy could have induced him to set at defiance the public sentiment of Pinchbrook.  \"Well, carry him up stairs then; but he never will get out of my house till he has been severely punished for his crimes.\"  The squire and Fred took hold of the senseless form of poor Tom, and carried it up stairs, where it was placed upon the sofa in the sitting room. Mrs. Pemberton had the reputation of being \"an excellent hand in sickness,\" and she immediately applied herself to the duty of restoring the sufferer to consciousness.  \"Don't you think you had better go after the doctor, father?\" asked the good woman. \"Some of his bones may be broken, or he may be injured inwardly.\"  \"I shall not go for any doctor,\" snarled the squire. \"Do you think I will trust myself out doors while that howling mob is hanging round the house?\"  \"Fred can go,\" suggested Susan.  \"He can, but he shall not,\" growled the squire, throwing himself into his arm chair in the corner, with an appearance of indifference and unconcern, which were far from representing the actual state of his mind.  Mrs. Pemberton said no more, but she and Susan went to work upon the sufferer with camphor and hartshorn in good earnest, and in a short time they had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes. They continued the treatment for some time longer, with the most satisfactory result, till Tom astonished them by jumping off the sofa, and standing up in the middle of the room. He rubbed his forehead, hunched up his left shoulder, and felt of his shins.  \"Are you hurt, Thomas?\" asked Mrs. Pemberton, with more of tenderness in her tones than the squire deemed proper for the occasion.  \"No, marm, I guess not,\" replied Tom. \"My shoulder feels a little stiff, and I think I barked one of my shins; but I shall be as good as new by to-morrow.\"  But there was an ugly bump on the side of his head, which he had not yet discovered, but which Susan pointed out to him. He acknowledged the bump, but declared it was only a little sore and would be all right by the next day.  \"I feel pretty well,\" continued Tom, \"and I guess I'll go home now.\"  \"I think you won't, young man,\" interposed Squire Pemberton.  Tom looked at him, and for the first time since he had come to himself, he remembered in what manner he had received his injuries. He immediately came to the conclusion that he had got into a bad scrape. He was in the house of, and in the presence of, his great enemy. The events of the day passed in rapid succession through his mind, and he could not help thinking that he was destined to be the first victim in Pinchbrook to the war spirit which had just been awakened all over the country.  The squire thought he would not go home, which was as much as to say he would not let him go home. Tom's wits were a little confused, after the hard knock he had received upon the head, and all he could do was to stand and look at the oracle of Pinchbrook, and wait for further developments.  \"Young man,\" said the squire, sternly, and in tones that were intended to make a deep impression upon the mind of the young man, \"your time has come.\"  The squire paused, and looked at the culprit to ascertain the effect of the startling announcement; but Tom seemed to be perfectly cool, and was not annihilated by the suggestive remark of the great man of Pinchbrook.  \"You have become a midnight marauder,\" added the squire, poetically.  \"It isn't seven o'clock yet,\" said Tom pointing to the great wooden clock in the corner of the room.  \"You joined a mob to pillage and destroy the property of a peaceable citizen. You broke in--\"  \"No, sir; the cellar door broke in,\" interposed the culprit.  \"You broke into my house to set it afire!\" continued the squire, in a rage.  \"No, sir, I did not. I only went round there to see the fun,\" replied Tom, pointing to the rear of the house; \"and the cellar door broke down and let me in. I did not mean to do you or your house any harm; and I didn't do any, except breaking the cellar door, and I will have that mended.\"  \"Don't tell me, you young villain! You meant to burn my house.\"  \"No, I didn't mean any thing of the kind,\" replied Tom, stoutly. \"I was going off when the door broke down. The boards were rotten, and I should think a man like you ought to have better cellar doors than those are.\"  The squire didn't relish this criticism, especially from the source whence it came. There was a want of humility on the part of the culprit which the magnate of Pinchbrook thought would be exceedingly becoming in a young man in his situation. The absence of it made him more angry than before. He stormed and hurled denunciations at the offender; he rehearsed the mischief he had done during the day, and alluded in strong terms to that which he intended to perpetrate in the \"dead watches of the night\"--which was the poetical rendering of half-past six in the evening; for the squire was fond of effective phrases.  Tom ventured to hint that a man who would not stand by his country when her flag was insulted and \"trailed in the dust\"--Tom had read the daily papers--ought to be brought to his senses by such expedients as his fellow-citizens might suggest. Of course this remark only increased the squire's wrath, and he proceeded to pronounce sentence upon the unlucky youth, which was that he should be taken to the finished room in the attic, and confined there under bolts and bars till the inquisitor should further declare and execute his intentions.  Mrs. Pemberton and Susan remonstrated against this sentence, prudently suggesting the consequences which might result from detaining the boy. But the squire declared he should not go till he had at least horsewhipped him; and if there was any justice left in the land, he would send him to the county jail in the morning.  Tom wanted to resist the execution of his sentence, but he was still weak from the effects of his fall, and he could not expect to vanquish both the squire and his son; so, with an earnest protest, he permitted himself to be led to the attic chamber. The squire thrust him into the room, and after carefully securing the door, left our hero to meditate upon the reverse of fortune which had overtaken him.     CHAPTER VI.  THE WAY IS PREPARED.   \"Where do you suppose Thomas is?\" said Mrs. Somers, as she glanced at the clock, which indicated half-past nine.  \"I don't know,\" replied John. \"He can't be a great ways off. I saw him in front of the squire's house when the committee went in.\"  \"The boy's gone down to the Harbor again with the rest of the folks, talking about the war,\" added gran'ther Greene, as he rose from his chair, and hobbled into his chamber adjoining the kitchen.  At ten o'clock, the mother began to be a little uneasy; and at eleven, even John had some fears that all was not well with his brother. Neither of them was able to suggest anything that could possibly have happened to the absentee. There had been no battle fought, and so nobody could have been killed. There had been no violence used in the transactions of the evening further than breaking in the front door of Squire Pemberton, so that it was not easy to believe that any accident had happened to him.  John had given a glowing account of the proceedings at the house of the squire and the family had been much interested and excited by the stirring narrative. His mother was perfectly satisfied, as no one had been injured, and hoped the great"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14595"],["title","The Soldier Boy; or, Tom Somers in the Army: A Story of the Great Rebellion (#6)"],["body","of Pinchbrook would be brought to his senses. All these topics had been fully discussed during the evening. John had informed his mother that Captain Benson, who had formerly commanded the Pinchbrook Riflemen, intended to raise a company for the war. He mentioned the names of half a dozen young men who had expressed their desire to join. The family had suggested that this and that man would go, and thus the long evening passed away.  \"I don't see what has become of Thomas,\" said Mrs. Somers, when the clock struck eleven, as she rose from her chair and looked out of the window.  \"Well, I don't see, either,\" replied John. \"I don't believe there is anything going on at this time of night.\"  \"I hope nothing has happened to him,\" continued the anxious mother, as she went to the door and looked out, hoping, perhaps, to discover him in the gloom of the night, or to hear his familiar step.  \"What could have happened to him?\" asked John, who did not believe his brother was fool enough to fall overboard, or permit any serious accident to happen to him.  \"I don't know. I can't see what has got the boy. He always comes home before nine o'clock. Have you heard him say anything that will give you an idea where he is?\"  \"He hasn't said anything to me.\"  \"Try, and see if you can't think of something,\" persisted the anxious mother.  \"He hasn't talked of anything but the war since yesterday morning.\"  \"What did he say?\"  \"I don't know, now,\" answered John, musing. \"He said he should like to join the army, and go down and fight the rebels.\"  Mrs. Somers had heard as much from him, but she had given no particular attention to his remarks on this subject, for they seemed wild and visionary. John's words, under the present circumstances, appeared to be full of importance; and taking her stocking, she seated herself before the stove, and resumed her knitting. She was silent now, for her heart was heavy with the premonitions of impending trouble.  \"I will take a walk down to the Harbor, mother, and see if I can find anything of him. There may be something going on there that I don't know about. He may be at the store, talking about the war with Captain Barney and the rest of the folks.\"  Mrs. Somers offered no objection to this plan, and John put on his cap, and left the house. The poor mother brooded upon her trouble for another hour, and with every new moment, the trouble seemed more real. The clock struck twelve before John returned; and more than once during his absence, as she plied her needles, she had wiped away a tear that hung among the furrows of her care-worn cheek. She had been thinking of her husband, as well as of her son. He was, or soon would be, in the midst of the traitors, and she trembled for him. Uncle Wyman was a secessionist; and, beyond this, she had not much confidence in his integrity, and if Captain Somers came home at all, his property would all be swept away, and he would be a beggar.  The events of that day were not calculated to conciliate Squire Pemberton towards them, and the farm and the cottage would pass away from them. All these things had been considered and reconsidered by the devoted mother. Poverty and want seemed to stare her in the face; and to add to all these troubles, Thomas did not come home, and, as fond mothers will, she anticipated the worst.  John entered the kitchen, and carelessly flung his cap upon the table. Mrs. Somers looked at him, and waited patiently to hear any intelligence he might bring. But John threw himself into a chair, looking more gloomy than before he left the house. He did not speak, and therefore he had no good news to tell.  \"You didn't see anything of him--did you?\" asked Mrs. Somers; but it was a useless question, for she had already interpreted the meaning of his downcast looks.  \"No, mother; there isn't a man, woman, or child stirring in the village; and I didn't see a light in a single house.\"  \"What do you suppose can have become of him?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know. Tom is old enough and smart enough to take care of himself.\"  \"It's very strange.\"  \"So it is. I haven't any idea what has become of him.\"  \"Did you look around Squire Pemberton's house, where he was seen last?\"  \"I looked about on both sides of the road, going and coming from the Harbor. I whistled all the way, and if he had been any where round, he would have whistled back, as he always does.\"  \"What do you _suppose_ has become of him?\" demanded the poor mother, worried beyond expression at the mysterious disappearance of her son.  \"I can't tell, mother.\"  \"Don't you think we had better call up the neighbors, and have something done about it?\"  \"I don't know,\" replied John, hardly less anxious than his mother.  \"I don't suppose they would be able to find him if we did,\" added Mrs. Somers, wiping away the tears from her face.  \"I can't think anything has happened to him, mother. If he had been on the water, or anything of that kind, I should feel worse about it.\"  \"If I only knew where he was, I shouldn't feel so bad about it,\" said she; and her position, certainly, was a reasonable one.  \"What's the matter, sister?\" called gran'ther Greene, from his chamber. \"Hasn't that boy got home yet?\"  \"No, he hasn't come yet, and I am worried to death about him,\" replied Mrs. Somers, opening the door of her brother's room.  \"What o'clock is it?\"  \"After twelve. Thomas never stayed out so late in his life before. What do you suppose has become of him?\"  \"Law sake! I haven't the leastest idea,\" answered the old man. \"Thomas is a smart boy, and knows enough to keep out of trouble.\"  \"That's what I say,\" added John, who had unlimited confidence in his brother's ability to take care of himself.  \"I'll tell you what _I_ think, John,\" said Mrs. Somers, throwing herself into her chair with an air of desperation.  But she did not tell John what she thought: on the contrary, she sat rocking herself in silence, as though her thought was too big and too momentous for utterance.  \"Well, what do you think, mother?\" asked John, when he had waited a reasonable time for her to express her opinion on the exciting topic.  Mrs. Somers rocked herself more violently than before, and made no reply.  \"What were you going to say?\"  \"I think the boy has gone off to Boston, and gone into the army,\" replied she, desperately, as though she had fully made up her mind to commit herself to this belief.  \"Do you think so, mother?\"  \"I feel almost sure of it.\"  \"I don't think so, mother. Tom wouldn't have gone off without saying something to me about it.\"  \"If he wouldn't say it to me, he wouldn't be likely to say it to you, John. It don't look a bit like Thomas to go off and leave his mother in this way,\" moaned the poor woman, wiping away a deluge of tears that now poured from her eyes.  \"I don't believe he has done any such thing, mother,\" protested John.  \"I feel almost certain about it, now. If the boy wanted to go, and couldn't stay at home, he ought to have told me so.\"  \"He did say he wanted to go.\"  \"I didn't think he really meant it. I want my boys to love their country, and be ready to fight for it. Much as I should hate to part with them, if they are needed, they may go; but I don't like to have them run away and leave me in this mean way. I shouldn't feel half so bad if I knew Thomas was in the army now, as I do to think he ran away from home, just as though he had done some mean thing. I am willing he should go, and he wouldn't be a son of mine if he wasn't ready to go and fight for his country, and die for her too, if there was any need of it. I didn't think Thomas would serve me in this way.\"  \"I don't believe he has.\"  \"I know he's gone. I like his spunk, but if he had only come to me and said he _must_ go, I wouldn't have said a word; but to go off without bidding us good by--it's too bad, and I didn't think Thomas would do such a thing.\"  Mrs. Somers rose from her chair, and paced the room in the highest state of agitation and excitement. The rockers were not adequate to the duty required of them, and nothing less than the whole floor of the kitchen was sufficient for the proper venting of her emotion.  \"Do you mean to say, mother, that you would have given him leave to go, even if he had teased you for a month?\" asked John.  \"Certainly I should,\" replied his mother, stopping short in the middle of the floor. \"I'm ready and willing to have my boys fight for their country, but I don't want them to sneak off as though they had been robbing a hen-roost, and without even saying good by to me.\"  \"If Tom were here, do you mean to say you would let him go?\" demanded John, earnestly.  \"Certainly I do; I mean so. But I don't think there is any need of boys like him going, when there are men enough to do the fighting.\"  \"You told Tom he shouldn't go.\"  \"Well, I didn't think he really meant it. If he had--What's that, John?\" asked she, suddenly, as a noise at the window attracted her attention.  \"Only the cat, mother.\"  \"If Thomas or you had asked me in earnest, and there was need of your going, I wouldn't have kept either of you at home. I would go to the poorhouse first. My father and my brother both fought for their country, and my sons shall when their country wants them.\"  \"Then you are willing Tom should go?\"  \"I am, but not to have him sneak off like a sheep-stealer.\"  \"Three cheers for you, mother!\" shouted Thomas, as he threw up the window at which he had been standing for some ten minutes listening to this interesting conversation.  \"Where have you been, Thomas?\" exclaimed the delighted mother.  \"Open the door, Jack, and let me in, and I will tell you all about it,\" replied the absentee.  \"Come in; the door isn't locked,\" said John.  He came in; and what he had to tell will interest the reader as well as his mother and his brother.     CHAPTER VII.  A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE.
