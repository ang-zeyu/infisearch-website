It was the time when Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia were taking their tea in the sitting room sacred to themselves.  At this hour a great deal of talking was done, and a great many secrets changed hands, particularly if the younger pupils behaved themselves well, and did not squabble or run about noisily, which it must be confessed they usually did.  When they made an uproar the older girls usually interfered with scolding and shakes.  They were expected to keep order, and there was danger that if they did not, Miss Minchin or Miss Amelia would appear and put an end to festivities. Even as Lavinia spoke the door opened and Sara entered with Lottie, whose habit was to trot everywhere after her like a little dog.  \"There she is, with that horrid child!\" exclaimed Lavinia in a whisper. \"If she's so fond of her, why doesn't she keep her in her own room? She will begin howling about something in five minutes.\"  It happened that Lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to play in the schoolroom, and had begged her adopted parent to come with her. She joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner. Sara curled herself up in the window-seat, opened a book, and began to read.  It was a book about the French Revolution, and she was soon lost in a harrowing picture of the prisoners in the Bastille--men who had spent so many years in dungeons that when they were dragged out by those who rescued them, their long, gray hair and beards almost hid their faces, and they had forgotten that an outside world existed at all, and were like beings in a dream.  She was so far away from the schoolroom that it was not agreeable to be dragged back suddenly by a howl from Lottie.  Never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book. People who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment.  The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage.  \"It makes me feel as if someone had hit me,\" Sara had told Ermengarde once in confidence.  \"And as if I want to hit back.  I have to remember things quickly to keep from saying something ill-tempered.\"  She had to remember things quickly when she laid her book on the window-seat and jumped down from her comfortable corner.  Lottie had been sliding across the schoolroom floor, and, having first irritated Lavinia and Jessie by making a noise, had ended by falling down and hurting her fat knee.  She was screaming and dancing up and down in the midst of a group of friends and enemies, who were alternately coaxing and scolding her.  \"Stop this minute, you cry-baby!  Stop this minute!\"  Lavinia commanded.  \"I'm not a cry-baby ... I'm not!\" wailed Lottie.  \"Sara, Sa--ra!\"  \"If she doesn't stop, Miss Minchin will hear her,\" cried Jessie. \"Lottie darling, I'll give you a penny!\"  \"I don't want your penny,\" sobbed Lottie; and she looked down at the fat knee, and, seeing a drop of blood on it, burst forth again.  Sara flew across the room and, kneeling down, put her arms round her.  \"Now, Lottie,\" she said.  \"Now, Lottie, you PROMISED Sara.\"  \"She said I was a cry-baby,\" wept Lottie.  Sara patted her, but spoke in the steady voice Lottie knew.  \"But if you cry, you will be one, Lottie pet.  You PROMISED.\" Lottie remembered that she had promised, but she preferred to lift up her voice.  \"I haven't any mamma,\" she proclaimed.  \"I haven't--a bit--of mamma.\"  \"Yes, you have,\" said Sara, cheerfully.  \"Have you forgotten?  Don't you know that Sara is your mamma?  Don't you want Sara for your mamma?\"  Lottie cuddled up to her with a consoled sniff.  \"Come and sit in the window-seat with me,\" Sara went on, \"and I'll whisper a story to you.\"  \"Will you?\" whimpered Lottie.  \"Will you--tell me--about the diamond mines?\"  \"The diamond mines?\" broke out Lavinia.  \"Nasty, little spoiled thing, I should like to SLAP her!\"  Sara got up quickly on her feet.  It must be remembered that she had been very deeply absorbed in the book about the Bastille, and she had had to recall several things rapidly when she realized that she must go and take care of her adopted child.  She was not an angel, and she was not fond of Lavinia.  \"Well,\" she said, with some fire, \"I should like to slap YOU--but I don't want to slap you!\" restraining herself.  \"At least I both want to slap you--and I should LIKE to slap you--but I WON'T slap you.  We are not little gutter children.  We are both old enough to know better.\"  Here was Lavinia's opportunity.  \"Ah, yes, your royal highness,\" she said.  \"We are princesses, I believe.  At least one of us is.  The school ought to be very fashionable now Miss Minchin has a princess for a pupil.\"  Sara started toward her.  She looked as if she were going to box her ears.  Perhaps she was.  Her trick of pretending things was the joy of her life.  She never spoke of it to girls she was not fond of. Her new \"pretend\" about being a princess was very near to her heart, and she was shy and sensitive about it.  She had meant it to be rather a secret, and here was Lavinia deriding it before nearly all the school. She felt the blood rush up into her face and tingle in her ears. She only just saved herself.  If you were a princess, you did not fly into rages.  Her hand dropped, and she stood quite still a moment. When she spoke it was in a quiet, steady voice; she held her head up, and everybody listened to her.  \"It's true,\" she said.  \"Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess.  I pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one.\"  Lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say.  Several times she had found that she could not think of a satisfactory reply when she was dealing with Sara.  The reason for this was that, somehow, the rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her opponent. She saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly. The truth was, they liked princesses, and they all hoped they might hear something more definite about this one, and drew nearer Sara accordingly.  Lavinia could only invent one remark, and it fell rather flat.  \"Dear me,\" she said, \"I hope, when you ascend the throne, you won't forget us!\"  \"I won't,\" said Sara, and she did not utter another word, but stood quite still, and stared at her steadily as she saw her take Jessie's arm and turn away.  After this, the girls who were jealous of her used to speak of her as \"Princess Sara\" whenever they wished to be particularly disdainful, and those who were fond of her gave her the name among themselves as a term of affection.  No one called her \"princess\" instead of \"Sara,\" but her adorers were much pleased with the picturesqueness and grandeur of the title, and Miss Minchin, hearing of it, mentioned it more than once to visiting parents, feeling that it rather suggested a sort of royal boarding school.  To Becky it seemed the most appropriate thing in the world. The acquaintance begun on the foggy afternoon when she had jumped up terrified from her sleep in the comfortable chair, had ripened and grown, though it must be confessed that Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia knew very little about it.  They were aware that Sara was \"kind\" to the scullery maid, but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments snatched perilously when, the upstairs rooms being set in order with lightning rapidity, Sara's sitting room was reached, and the heavy coal box set down with a sigh of joy. At such times stories were told by installments, things of a satisfying nature were either produced and eaten or hastily tucked into pockets to be disposed of at night, when Becky went upstairs to her attic to bed.  \"But I has to eat 'em careful, miss,\" she said once; \"'cos if I leaves crumbs the rats come out to get 'em.\"  \"Rats!\" exclaimed Sara, in horror.  \"Are there RATS there?\"  \"Lots of 'em, miss,\" Becky answered in quite a matter-of-fact manner. \"There mostly is rats an' mice in attics.  You gets used to the noise they makes scuttling about.  I've got so I don't mind 'em s' long as they don't run over my piller.\"  \"Ugh!\" said Sara.  \"You gets used to anythin' after a bit,\" said Becky.  \"You have to, miss, if you're born a scullery maid.  I'd rather have rats than cockroaches.\"  \"So would I,\" said Sara; \"I suppose you might make friends with a rat in time, but I don't believe I should like to make friends with a cockroach.\"  Sometimes Becky did not dare to spend more than a few minutes in the bright, warm room, and when this was the case perhaps only a few words could be exchanged, and a small purchase slipped into the old-fashioned pocket Becky carried under her dress skirt, tied round her waist with a band of tape.  The search for and discovery of satisfying things to eat which could be packed into small compass, added a new interest to Sara's existence.  When she drove or walked out, she used to look into shop windows eagerly. The first time it occurred to her to bring home two or three little meat pies, she felt that she had hit upon a discovery. When she exhibited them, Becky's eyes quite sparkled.  \"Oh, miss!\" she murmured.  \"Them will be nice an' fillin.' It's fillin'ness that's best.  Sponge cake's a 'evenly thing, but it melts away like--if you understand, miss.  These'll just STAY in yer stummick.\"  \"Well,\" hesitated Sara, \"I don't think it would be good if they stayed always, but I do believe they will be satisfying.\"  They were satisfying--and so were beef sandwiches, bought at a cook-shop--and so were rolls and Bologna sausage.  In time, Becky began to lose her hungry, tired feeling, and the coal box did not seem so unbearably heavy.  However heavy it was, and whatsoever the temper of the cook, and the hardness of the work heaped upon her shoulders, she had always the chance of the afternoon to look forward to--the chance that Miss Sara would be able to be in her sitting room.

As I may, without vanity, presume that the name and official description prefixed to this Proem will secure it, from the sedate and reflecting part of mankind, to whom only I would be understood to address myself, such attention as is due to the sedulous instructor of youth, and the careful performer of my Sabbath duties, I will forbear to hold up a candle to the daylight, or to point out to the judicious those recommendations of my labours which they must necessarily anticipate from the perusal of the title-page. Nevertheless, I am not unaware, that, as Envy always dogs Merit at the heels, there may be those who will whisper, that albeit my learning and good principles cannot (lauded be the heavens) be denied by any one, yet that my situation at Gandercleugh hath been more favourable to my acquisitions in learning than to the enlargement of my views of the ways and works of the present generation. To the which objection, if, peradventure, any such shall be started, my answer shall be threefold:  First, Gandercleugh is, as it were, the central part--the navel (SI FAS SIT DICERE) of this our native realm of Scotland; so that men, from every corner thereof, when travelling on their concernments of business, either towards our metropolis of law, by which I mean Edinburgh, or towards our metropolis and mart of gain, whereby I insinuate Glasgow, are frequently led to make Gandercleugh their abiding stage and place of rest for the night. And it must be acknowledged by the most sceptical, that I, who have sat in the leathern armchair, on the left-hand side of the fire, in the common room of the Wallace Inn, winter and summer, for every evening in my life, during forty years bypast (the Christian Sabbaths only excepted), must have seen more of the manners and customs of various tribes and people, than if I had sought them out by my own painful travel and bodily labour. Even so doth the tollman at the well-frequented turn-pike on the Wellbraehead, sitting at his ease in his own dwelling, gather more receipt of custom, than if, moving forth upon the road, he were to require a contribution from each person whom he chanced to meet in his journey, when, according to the vulgar adage, he might possibly be greeted with more kicks than halfpence.  But, secondly, supposing it again urged, that Ithacus, the most wise of the Greeks, acquired his renown, as the Roman poet hath assured us, by visiting states and men, I reply to the Zoilus who shall adhere to this objection, that, DE FACTO, I have seen states and men also; for I have visited the famous cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, the former twice, and the latter three times, in the course of my earthly pilgrimage. And, moreover, I had the honour to sit in the General Assembly (meaning, as an auditor, in the galleries thereof), and have heard as much goodly speaking on the law of patronage, as, with the fructification thereof in mine own understanding, hath made me be considered as an oracle upon that doctrine ever since my safe and happy return to Gandercleugh.  Again--and thirdly, If it be nevertheless pretended that my information and knowledge of mankind, however extensive, and however painfully acquired, by constant domestic enquiry, and by foreign travel, is, natheless, incompetent to the task of recording the pleasant narratives of my Landlord, I will let these critics know, to their own eternal shame and confusion as well as to the abashment and discomfiture of all who shall rashly take up a song against me, that I am NOT the writer, redacter, or compiler, of the Tales of my Landlord; nor am I, in one single iota, answerable for their contents, more or less. And now, ye generation of critics, who raise yourselves up as if it were brazen serpents, to hiss with your tongues, and to smite with your stings, bow yourselves down to your native dust, and acknowledge that yours have been the thoughts of ignorance, and the words of vain foolishness. Lo! ye are caught in your own snare, and your own pit hath yawned for you. Turn, then, aside from the task that is too heavy for you; destroy not your teeth by gnawing a file; waste not your strength by spurning against a castle wall; nor spend your breath in contending in swiftness with a fleet steed; and let those weigh the Tales of my Landlord, who shall bring with them the scales of candour cleansed from the rust of prejudice by the hands of intelligent modesty. For these alone they were compiled, as will appear from a brief narrative which my zeal for truth compelled me to make supplementary to the present Proem.  It is well known that my Landlord was a pleasing and a facetious man, acceptable unto all the parish of Gandercleugh, excepting only the Laird, the Exciseman, and those for whom he refused to draw liquor upon trust. Their causes of dislike I will touch separately, adding my own refutation thereof.  His honour, the Laird, accused our Landlord, deceased, of having encouraged, in various times and places, the destruction of hares, rabbits, fowls black and grey, partridges, moor-pouts, roe-deer, and other birds and quadrupeds, at unlawful seasons, and contrary to the laws of this realm, which have secured, in their wisdom, the slaughter of such animals for the great of the earth, whom I have remarked to take an uncommon (though to me, an unintelligible) pleasure therein. Now, in humble deference to his honour, and in justifiable defence of my friend deceased, I reply to this charge, that howsoever the form of such animals might appear to be similar to those so protected by the law, yet it was a mere DECEPTIO VISUS; for what resembled hares were, in fact, HILL-KIDS, and those partaking of the appearance of moor-fowl, were truly WOOD PIGEONS and consumed and eaten EO NOMINE, and not otherwise.  Again, the Exciseman pretended, that my deceased Landlord did encourage that species of manufacture called distillation, without having an especial permission from the Great, technically called a license, for doing so. Now, I stand up to confront this falsehood; and in defiance of him, his gauging-stick, and pen and inkhorn, I tell him, that I never saw, or tasted, a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house of my Landlord; nay, that, on the contrary, we needed not such devices, in respect of a pleasing and somewhat seductive liquor, which was vended and consumed at the Wallace Inn, under the name of MOUNTAIN DEW. If there is a penalty against manufacturing such a liquor, let him show me the statute; and when he does, I’ll tell him if I will obey it or no.  Concerning those who came to my Landlord for liquor, and went thirsty away, for lack of present coin, or future credit, I cannot but say it has grieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own. Nevertheless, my Landlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul, and would permit them, in extreme need, and when their soul was impoverished for lack of moisture, to drink to the full value of their watches and wearing apparel, exclusively of their inferior habiliments, which he was uniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain, for the credit of the house. As to mine own part, I may well say, that he never refused me that modicum of refreshment with which I am wont to recruit nature after the fatigues of my school. It is true, I taught his five sons English and Latin, writing, book-keeping, with a tincture of mathematics, and that I instructed his daughter in psalmody. Nor do I remember me of any fee or HONORARIUM received from him on account of these my labours, except the compotations aforesaid. Nevertheless this compensation suited my humour well, since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait till quarter-day.  But, truly, were I to speak my simple conceit and belief, I think my Landlord was chiefly moved to waive in my behalf the usual requisition of a symbol, or reckoning, from the pleasure he was wont to take in my conversation, which, though solid and edifying in the main, was, like a well-built palace, decorated with facetious narratives and devices, tending much to the enhancement and ornament thereof. And so pleased was my Landlord of the Wallace in his replies during such colloquies, that there was no district in Scotland, yea, and no peculiar, and, as it were, distinctive custom therein practised, but was discussed betwixt us; insomuch, that those who stood by were wont to say, it was worth a bottle of ale to hear us communicate with each other. And not a few travellers, from distant parts, as well as from the remote districts of our kingdom, were wont to mingle in the conversation, and to tell news that had been gathered in foreign lands, or preserved from oblivion in this our own.  Now I chanced to have contracted for teaching the lower classes with a young person called Peter, or Patrick, Pattieson, who had been educated for our Holy Kirk, yea, had, by the license of presbytery, his voice opened therein as a preacher, who delighted in the collection of olden tales and legends, and in garnishing them with the flowers of poesy, whereof he was a vain and frivolous professor. For he followed not the example of those strong poets whom I proposed to him as a pattern, but formed versification of a flimsy and modern texture, to the compounding whereof was necessary small pains and less thought. And hence I have chid him as being one of those who bring forward the"]]]
