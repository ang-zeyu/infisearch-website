The child's name was Hulreich, but as he had always called himself Hunne, the other children and the parents had adopted the nick-name. Moreover, Julius, the eldest brother, declared that the baby's little stumpy nose made him look like a Hun, and so the name was very appropriate. But his mother would not admit the resemblance.  The little one had so much to tell his father, that there was not time to wait for the end of his story, and it had to be cut short.  \"Bye and bye, little Hunne, you shall tell me all about it. Now it is time for Wili and Lili.\" And giving the twins each a kiss he asked them, \"Well now, have you been very good and happy? and obedient, too, all this long time?\"  \"Almost always,\" replied Wili rather timidly, while Lili, recalling certain deviations from perfect obedience during her father's absence, thought it best not to make any answer. The twins were eight years old, and perfectly inseparable, never more so than in planning and carrying out various delightful plans, of whose mischievousness they were really only half conscious.  \"And you, Rolf, how is it with you?\" said the father, turning to a twelve-year old lad with a high forehead, and a strong, firm neck. \"Plenty of Latin learned? More new puzzles ready?\"  \"I have been doing both, father,\" said the boy. \"But the children will not guess my riddles, and my mother has not time to try.\"  \"That is too bad,\" said his father, kindly and turning to the eldest daughter, a girl of nearly thirteen, he drew her to his side and said tenderly,  \"And you Paula, are you still alone in your garden walks? have you no dear friend with you yet?\"  \"No, of course not, father, but it is beautiful to have you at home again,\" she answered as she embraced him.  \"And I hope my 'big Jule,' is using his vacation in some sensible way?\"  \"I combine the agreeable with the useful,\" said Julius gaily, returning his father's embrace. \"You must know, father, that the hazel-nuts are almost ripe and I am watching them carefully, and meantime I am riding Castor a good deal, so that he may not grow too lazy.\"  Julius was at home now only for the summer holidays, his school being in a distant town. He was seventeen, and tall, even too tall for his years so that in the family he was generally called \"Big Jule.\"  Mr. Birkenfeld now turned to shake hands with the children's governess and the dear friend of the family, Miss Hanenwinkel, when Jule interrupted him.  \"Come papa, I beg that you will do the rest of your greetings in the garden, where a most astonishing reception awaits you.\"  But his words cost him dear, for Wili and Lili sprang upon him as he spoke, pinching, pounding and thumping him to give him to understand that the \"surprise\" was not a thing to be talked about beforehand. He defended himself to the best of his ability.  \"Lili, you little gad-fly, you, stop, stop, I tell you. I will make it all right,\" and he shouted to his father,  \"I mean you are to go into the garden where my mother has prepared all sorts of delicious things for your supper, to celebrate your return.\"  \"That is delightful. We shall find a big table spread under my favorite apple-tree. That is a surprise worth having. Come then let us all go into the garden.\"  He drew his wife's arm in his, and they walked out to the garden, the whole swarm following, Wili and Lili capering about in most noisy delight that their father should suppose that he knew what the \"surprise\" was already.  As they passed out into the garden they passed under the great triumphal arch, with red lanterns hung on each side, lighting up the large tablet, on which was an inscription in big letters.  \"Oh, oh, how splendid!\" cried the father, now really surprised, \"a beautiful arch and a poem of welcome. I must read them aloud:\"      \"Here we stand in welcome         Beside the garden door,      How glad we are that you're at home!         We feared you'd come no more,      So long you've stayed--but now to-day         Forgot is all our pain.      The whole world now is glad and gay,         Papa is here again!\"  \"That is fine--Rolf must have been the author of that, was he not?\" and Wili and Lili jumped about more than ever, crying out,  \"Yes, yes, Rolf wrote it, but we planned it all out and he made the verses, and Jule put up the poles and then we fetched the fir twigs.\"  \"That was a delightful surprise, my children,\" said their father, much gratified. \"How pretty the garden looks, all lighted up with red and blue and yellow lanterns. It looks like an enchanted spot, and now for my favorite apple-tree.\"  The garden did look very pretty. The little paper lanterns had been made up a long time before, and this very morning Jule had fastened them about on all the trees and high bushes, and while the hand-shaking and kissing had been going on in the house, Battiste and Trine had lighted the candles. The big apple-tree was dotted all over with them, so that it looked like a huge out-of-doors Christmas tree, and the red apples shone so prettily in the flickering light, that altogether it would have been difficult to imagine a more charming scene.  The table, spread with a white cloth and loaded with all sorts of nice dishes, looked irresistibly attractive.  \"What a beautiful banquet-hall,\" cried the delighted father, \"and how good the feast will taste! But what is this? Another poem?\" and to be sure, a large white placard hung by two cords from the high bushes behind the apple-tree, and on it were the following lines:      \"My first is good for man to be--             Better than wealth.      My second we have longed to see             Our father do in health.      My whole with merry hearts we cry      Today, and shout it to the sky.\"  \"A riddle! Rolf made this too, I am sure,\" said he, clapping the boy kindly on the shoulder. \"I will begin to guess it as soon as I can. Now we must sit down and enjoy these good things before us, and the pleasure of being all together again.\"  So they all took their places at the table, and each had his or her own story to tell of what had happened, and what had been done during the separation. There was so much to say that there seemed no chance for a pause.  At last however, came a silence, when lo! Mr. Birkenfeld drew a huge bundle from beneath his chair, and began to open the wrapper, while the children looked on with the greatest interest, knowing very well that that bundle held some gift for each one of them. First came a pair of shining spurs for \"big Jule,\" then a lovely book with blue covers for Paula. Next a long bow with a quiver and two feather arrows. \"This is for Rolf,\" said the father, adding as he showed the boy the sharp points of the arrows, \"and for Rolf only, for he knows how to use it properly. It is not a plaything, and Wili and Lili must never dream of playing with it, for they might easily hurt themselves and others with it.\"  There was a beautiful Noah's Ark for the twins, with fine large animals all in pairs, and Noah's family, all the men with walking-sticks and all the women with parasols, all ready for use whenever they should leave the ark.  Last of all, little Hunne had a wonderfully constructed nutcracker, that made a strange grimace as if he were lamenting all the sins of the world. He opened his big jaws as if he were howling, and when they were snapped together, he gnashed his teeth as if in despair, and cracked a nut in two without the slightest trouble so that the kernel fell right out from the shell.  The children were full of admiration over both their own and each others' presents, and their joy and gratitude broke out afresh at every new inspection of each.  At last the mother stood up and said that they must all go into the house, for it was long after the children's usual bed-time. At this their father arose, and called out,  \"Who has guessed the charade?\"  Not one had even thought of it, except to be sure, the author.  \"Well, I have guessed it myself,\" said their father, as no one spoke. \"It must be 'welcome,' is it not, Rolf? I will touch glasses with you, my boy, and thank you very much for your charade.\"  Just as Rolf was raising his glass towards his father's to drink his health, a terrible shriek arose, \"It is burning, it is burning!\" Everybody ran from under the apple-tree; Battiste and Trine came from the house with tubs and buckets, Hans from the stable with a pail in each hand; all screaming and shouting together.  \"The bush is on fire! the hedge is on fire!\" There was terrible noise and confusion.  \"Dora! Dora!\" cried a voice of distress from the cottage behind the hedge, and Dora rose from her hiding place and hurried into the house. She had been so completely absorbed by what had been taking place under the apple-tree, though indeed she saw and heard but imperfectly, that she had entirely forgotten everything else, and it was full two hours that she had been lying all doubled up in the gap under the hedge.  Her aunt was flying back and forth, complaining and scolding. She had collected all her things from the drawers and the presses, and heaped them together, ready for flight.  \"Aunt Ninette,\" said the little girl timidly, for she knew she had staid out too long, \"you need not be frightened; it is all dark again in the garden; the fire is all out.\"  Her aunt cast a rapid glance from the window, and saw that this was true; everything was dark, even the last lantern extinguished. Some one was moving about among the trees, evidently to make sure that all was safe.  \"This is too terrible! Who would have believed that such things could happen?\" said Aunt Ninette, half scolding, half-whimpering. \"Go to bed now Dora. To-morrow we will move away, and find another house, or leave the place altogether.\"  The child obeyed quickly, and went up to her little bedroom, but it was long, very long, before she could sleep. She still saw the illuminated garden, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14710"],["title","Uncle Titus and His Visit to the Country (#6)"],["body","apple tree, and the father and mother with their happy children gathered about them. She thought of the time when she too could tell her father everything, and the thought doubled her sense of her own loneliness, and of the happiness of those other children.  And the child had become so much interested in the life beyond the hedge, and so almost fond of that good father and mother, whom she had been watching, that the thought of going away again as her aunt threatened, was a very sad one. She could not go to sleep. Presently she seemed to see the children with their kind father again, and her own father was standing with them, and she heard these words,      \"God holds us in his hand,     God knows the best to send.\"  And so she fell asleep, and in her dreams she again saw the shining apple-tree, and the merry group under its branches.  On investigating the cause of the fire, it was discovered that Wili and Lili had conceived the happy thought of turning the riddle into a transparency, so that suddenly the company might see it shining with red light behind it, like the motto behind the Christmas tree, \"Glory to God in the highest.\"  So they withdrew silently from the company, fetched two candles, climbed upon some high steps, which had been brought when the placard was put in place, and held the candles as near as possible to the card. As they did not perceive any expression of surprise on the faces of the company at the table, they raised their candles higher and higher, nearer and nearer, until the paste-board suddenly took fire, and the flame quickly spread to the bushes above.  The twins readily confessed themselves the cause of the mischief, and were sent to bed with but a gentle reproof, so as not to spoil the general effect of the festivity, but they were seriously warned never to play with fire again as long as they lived.  Soon all was quiet in the great house, and the moon looked peacefully down on the trees and the sleeping flowers in the silent garden.     CHAPTER IV.  ALL SIX.   \"We shall not be able to remain here; Mrs. Kurd,\" were the first words spoken by Mrs. Ehrenreich when she came to breakfast the next morning. \"We have come into such an objectionable neighborhood that we must move away today.\"  Mrs. Kurd stood still in the middle of the room, quite speechless, and stared at the lady as if unable to grasp her meaning.  \"I am fully convinced of the absolute necessity of our immediate departure,\" said Aunt Ninette, with emphasis.  \"But indeed no more respectable, no quieter spot can be found in all Tannenburg than this. You cannot hope to be more comfortable anywhere else; either you or the gentleman,\" asserted the good widow as soon as she had recovered from her surprise.  \"How can you say so, Mrs. Kurd, after hearing that intolerable uproar last evening? noises far surpassing anything that I described to you in my letters as 'absolutely to be avoided.'\"  \"Oh, my dear lady, that was only the children! You know they were having a family festival, and they were of course unusually lively.\"  \"Indeed! if this is your method of celebrating family festivals in these parts, first a tempest of shouts and cries and then a fire with all its accompanying noise and hubbub, I can only say that such a neighborhood seems to me not only undesirable for an invalid, but positively dangerous.\"  \"I do not think you can call the fire a part of the celebration,\" said Mrs. Kurd gently. \"It was an accident, and it was very quickly extinguished, you must admit. A more orderly and well regulated family is nowhere to be found, and I cannot understand how the lady and gentleman can seriously think of leaving. I can assure you that no other such spot is to be found in all Tannenburg! If the gentleman needs quiet he will do well to walk into the wood, where it is healthful and quiet too.\"  After talking awhile, Mrs. Ehrenreich became more composed, and seated herself at the breakfast table, where Mr. Titus and Dora also took their places.  At the other house, breakfast had long been finished. The father had gone about his business, and the mother was occupied with her household affairs. Rolf was off to his early recitations in Latin, with the pastor of a neighboring parish. Paula was taking her music-lesson of the governess, and Wili and Lili took this opportunity to look over their lessons once more. Little Hunne sat in the corner with his newly-acquired nut-cracker before him, gravely studying its grotesque face.  Presently 'big Jule' came in, whip in hand, all booted and spurred from his morning ride.  \"Who will pull off my riding boots?\" he asked, throwing himself into a chair, stretching out his legs, and gazing admiringly at his new spurs. Wili and Lili sprang quickly from their seats, delighted at the chance of doing something that was not a lesson, and each seized a foot and began to pull with such force that before Jule knew what they were about he found himself slipping from his chair. In the next second he had grasped the side of his chair with the result that that also was pulled along the floor. He called out hastily \"Stop! Stop!\" while little Hunne, who saw the situation from his corner, now flew to his elder brother's assistance, hung on to the chair from behind, planting his little feet firmly on the ground, and throwing his weight backward as well as he knew how. His efforts were insufficient, however, and he was dragged along the floor as if he were on a coast. Wili and Lili were determined to finish their undertaking, and kept on pulling and pulling.      \"Stop! Stop! Wiling and Liling      You terrible twinning\"  cried Jule, while little Hunne added his voice to swell the tumult.  At this the mother made her appearance upon the scene, and the uproar was stilled at once. Jule swung himself panting back into his chair, and Hunne slowly regained his equilibrium.  \"My dear Jule, why do you make the children behave so badly? You ought to know better at your age,\" said his mother reprovingly.  \"Certainly, mother, certainly, in future I will do better, but if you will look at it from another side, I am doing something, in affording the twins an opportunity to be of use, instead of carrying on their usual mischievous pranks.\"  \"Jule, Jule, that does not look like doing better,\" said his mother warningly. \"Lili, go down stairs and practise your exercises until Miss Hanenwinkel has finished Paula's music lesson. Wili, go on with your studying, and the best thing you can do, Jule, to help me, is to amuse the little one until I am at leisure.\"  The \"big Jule\" was ready to help to restore order after his bit of fun, and Lili ran down stairs to the piano as she was bidden. She found herself too much excited after the exertion of playing boot-jack for her brother, and her exercises did not run smoothly, so she took up one of her \"pieces\" to work off her superfluous energy upon, and began to play with great emphasis,      \"Live your life merrily,       While the lamp glows,     Ere it can fade and die,       Gather the rose.\"  Uncle Titus and his wife were just finishing their breakfast in a neighboring house when the affair of the boots began. Uncle Titus hastened to his room, closing the windows and fastening them against the noise. His wife summoned their hostess rather peremptorily, and asked her \"just to listen to that\" for herself. It did not seem to make much impression upon Mrs. Kurd however, who only said smilingly,  \"Oh, how merry the dear children are, to be sure,\" and when Aunt Ninette went on to explain that such disturbances were the very worst thing for her poor invalid, the hostess only again recommended the walk in the woods for quiet and fresh air! The noise in the next house would not last long, she said, the young gentleman would soon return to college, and it would be much more quiet then. As she spoke, the sound of Lili's merry music came across through the open window on the morning breeze.  \"And that too, is that the work of the young gentleman, who will soon return to college?\" asked Mrs. Ehrenreich excitedly. \"It is unendurable; continually some new noise or tumult or uproar. What do you say to this last, Mrs. Kurd?\"  \"I never have thought of it as noise,\" said the good woman simply, \"the dear child is making such progress with her music, it is a pleasure to hear her.\"  \"And Dora, where can Dora be? Is she bewitched too? It is time for her to begin her sewing; where can she be? Dora! Dora! Have you gone into the garden again?\"  Aunt Ninette's voice was querulous and excited. To be sure, Dora had crept down again to peer through her opening in the hedge, and she was now listening as if enchanted, to Lili's gay music. She came back at once at the sound of her aunt's voice, and took her appointed place at the window where she was to sit and sew all day.  \"Well, we cannot stay here, that is certain,\" said Mrs. Ehrenreich as she left the room.  The tears started to Dora's eyes at these words. She did so long to remain here, where she could hear and partly see now and then, the merry healthy life of these children in the beautiful garden beyond the hedge. It was her only knowledge of true child-life. As she sewed, she was planning and puzzling her brain with plans for prolonging their stay, but could think of nothing that seemed likely to be of use.  It was now eleven o'clock. Rolf came scampering home from his recitations, and catching sight of his mother through the open door of the kitchen, he ran to her, calling out before he reached the threshold, \"Mamma, mamma, now guess. My first--\"  \"My dear Rolf\" interrupted his mother, \"I beg of you to find some one else to guess. I have not time now, truly. Go find Paula, she has just gone into the sitting-room.\"  Rolf obeyed.  \"Paula,\" he called out, \"My first--\"  \"No, Rolf, please, not just now, I am looking for my blank-book to write my French translation in. There is Miss Hanenwinkel, she is good at guessing, ask her.\"  \"Miss Hanenwinkel,\""]]]
