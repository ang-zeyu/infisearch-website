But we can hardly both be spared from home. It should be kept from grandpa as long as possible, and if he saw us both rushing off in the direction she has taken, he would know at once that something very serious had happened her.\"  \"Yes, you are right, and for the first time I envy you your medical knowledge and skill. She's with Virginia, the message is sent by her,\" glancing again at the paper which he still held in his hand. \"I'm glad of that--that she has at least one of her children with her, if----\"  He paused and Arthur finished the sentence. \"If she will be of any use or comfort to her, you were about to say? Well, we can only hope that so terrible an emergency has developed some hitherto unsuspected excellencies in Virginia's character.\"  A horse came galloping up the avenue. Calhoun glanced from the window.  \"Another telegram!\" he cried, and both brothers dashed out upon the veranda.  This was directed to Calhoun, sent from Philadelphia by their uncle Edward Allison. He and Adelaide would be with Mrs. Conly in two hours, telegraph at once in what condition they found her, and if practicable start with her immediately for her home.  The brothers consulted together, and Arthur decided to go on with his preparations, but delay setting out upon his journey until the coming of the promised message.  It came in due time, and from it they learned that their mother was already on her way home.  The sad tidings had now to be communicated to the other near relatives, but it was deemed best to keep them from the younger children and the feeble old father until the day when she might be expected to arrive.  As gently and tenderly as possible the old gentleman's son broke the news to him.  He was much overcome. \"She will never get over it, I fear,\" he sighed, the tears coursing down his furrowed cheeks. \"One bereavement is apt to tread closely upon the heels of another, and she will probably soon follow her sister. But oh if I only knew that she had been washed from her sins in the precious blood of Christ, that she had accepted His invitation, 'Come unto me,' so that death would be but falling asleep in Him, safe in His arms, safe on His gentle breast--I think I could let her go almost willingly, for my race is well nigh run, and it can hardly be long ere I too shall get my summons home.\"  \"Dear father, if such be the will of God, may you be spared to us for many years yet,\" returned his son with emotion. \"And Louise! We do not know her exact condition, but let us hope that God will in His great mercy give her yet more time--months or years--in which to prepare for eternity. We will cry earnestly for her, and in the name of Christ, to Him who hath said, 'I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth,' but bids them 'Turn yourselves and live ye.'\"  \"Yes; and whose promise is, 'If two of you shall agree on earth, as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven!'\"  Silence fell between them for a moment, then the old gentleman asked, \"What arrangements have the boys made? She will hardly be able to drive home in a carriage.\"  \"Oh no! they will meet her at the depôt with an ambulance, and I shall be there with the carriage for Mr. Allison, Adelaide, and Virginia.\"  \"Virginia is coming too?\"  \"We do not know certainly, but expect to see her with the others.\"  \"I cannot say that I hope you will. I never saw a more useless person; she will be only in the way; and--I cannot banish a suspicion that she has brought this attack upon her poor mother. I strongly suspect that Virginia's match has turned out a very bad one, and that she has heaped reproaches upon her mother for the hand she had in bringing it about.\"  \"I hope not!\" his son exclaimed with energy; \"for if so it must surely be the cause of life-long self-reproach to her. Will you go with us to the depôt, father?\"  \"No, no, my son! let my first sight of my poor stricken child be where we will not be the gazing stock of an idle, curious crowd. I shall meet her here at my own door.\"  The train steamed into the depôt, and Mrs. Allison, glancing from a window of the parlor-car, saw her brother and nephews standing near the track.  They saw her, too, and lifted their hats with a sad sort of smile. All felt that the invalid must be unable to sit up or her face also would have been in sight.  In another moment the train had come to a stand-still, and the next the three gentlemen were beside the couch on which Mrs. Conly lay.  She looked up at her sons with eyes full of intelligence, made an effort to speak, but in vain; and the big tears rolled down her cheeks.  They bent over her with hearts and eyes full to overflowing.  \"Mother, dear mother, we are glad you have come to us alive,\" Calhoun said in low, tremulous tones.  \"And we hope we shall soon have you much better,\" added Arthur.  \"Yes,\" said Adelaide, \"she is already better than when we first saw her in New York, but has not yet recovered her speech and can not help herself at all. One side seems to be quite paralyzed.\"  \"We have an ambulance waiting,\" said Calhoun. \"As soon as the crowd is out of the way it shall be brought close to the platform of this car and we will lift her into it.\"  Greetings were exchanged while they waited.  \"Where is Virginia?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore.  \"She preferred to remain behind,\" replied Mrs. Allison in a low-toned aside, \"and as she would have been of no use whatever, we did not urge her to come.\"  \"It is just as well,\" was Mr. Dinsmore's comment.  Very tenderly and carefully the poor invalid was lifted and placed in the ambulance by her sons and brothers. The former accompanied her in it, while the latter, with Mrs. Allison, entered the Roselands family carriage, and drove thither considerably in advance of the more slowly moving ambulance.  \"Has Virginia made a really good match?\" Mr. Dinsmore asked, addressing his sister Adelaide.  \"Good! it could hardly be worse!\" she exclaimed. \"Would you have believed it? we found them in a tenement-house, living most wretchedly.\"  \"Is it possible! He was not wealthy then? Or has he lost his means since the marriage?\"  \"As far as I can learn,\" said Mr. Allison, \"he has always lived by his wits; he is a professional gambler now.\"  \"Dreadful! How does he treat his wife?\"  \"Very badly indeed, if we may credit her story. They live, as the saying is, like cat and dog, actually coming to blows at times. They are both bitterly disappointed, each having married the other merely for money; which neither had.\"  Mr. Dinsmore looked greatly concerned. \"Virginia was never a favorite of mine,\" he remarked, \"but I do not like to think of her as suffering from either poverty or the abusive treatment of a bad husband. Can nothing be done to better her condition?\"  \"I think not at present,\" said Adelaide; \"she has made her bed and will have to lie in it. I don't believe the man would ever proceed to personal violence if she did not exasperate him with taunts and reproaches; with slaps, scratches, and hair pulling also, he says.\"  \"O disgraceful!\" exclaimed her uncle. \"I have no pity for her if she is really guilty of such conduct.\"  \"She told me herself that on one occasion she actually threw a cup of coffee in his face in return for his accusation that she and her mother had inveigled him into the marriage by pretences to wealth they did not possess. Poor Louise! I have no doubt her attack was brought on by the discovery of the great mistake she and Virginia had made, and reproaches heaped on her for her share in making the match.\"  \"'Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,'\" sighed Mr. Dinsmore. \"I presume Virginia was too proud to show herself here among relatives whose approval of the match had not been asked, and acquaintances who had heard of it as a splendid affair?\"  \"Your conjecture is entirely correct,\" said Adelaide. \"She gave vent to her feelings on the subject in her mother's presence, supposing, I presume, as I did, that not being able to speak or move, she was also unable to hear or understand, but it was evident from the piteous expression her countenance assumed and the tears coursing down her cheeky that she did both.\"  \"Poor Louise! she has a sad reaping--so far as that ungrateful, undutiful daughter is concerned; but Isa, Calhoun, and Arthur are of quite another stamp.\"  \"Yes, indeed! she will surely find great comfort in them. I wish Isa was not so far away. But you have not told me how my dear old father is. How has he borne this shock?\"  \"It was a shock of course, especially to one so old and feeble; but I left him calmly staying himself upon his God.\"  They arrived at Roselands some time before the ambulance. They found the whole household, and also Mrs. Howard, her husband and sons, and Mrs. Travilla, gathered upon the veranda to receive them.  Lora stood by her father's side and Elsie too was very near, both full of loving care for him in this time of sore trial.  And Adelaide's first thought, first embrace, were for him. They wept a moment in each other's arms.  \"Is she--is she alive?\" he faltered.  \"Yes, father, and we hope may get up again. Be comforted for her and for yourself; because 'He doeth all things well,' and 'We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.'\"  \"Yes, yes; and who can tell but this may be His appointed means for bringing her into the fold!\"  There had been time for an exchange of greetings all around and a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],["title","Grandmother Elsie (#7)"],["body","comforting words to the younger Conlys, when the ambulance was seen entering the avenue.  With beating hearts and tearful eyes they watched its slow progress. Lying helpless and speechless in the shadow of death, Louise Conly seemed nearer and dearer than ever before to father, children, brothers and sisters.  The ambulance stopped close to the veranda steps, and the same strong, loving arms that had placed her in it now lifted her anew and bore her into the house, the others looking on in awed and tearful silence.  She was carried to her own room, laid upon the bed, and one by one they stood for an instant at her side with a kiss of welcome.  It was evident that she knew them all, though able to speak only with those sad, wistful eyes that gazed with new yearning affection into the faces of father and children.  But presently Arthur, by virtue of his medical authority, banished all from the room except Lora, Elsie, and a faithful and attached old negress who had lived all her days in the family and was a competent nurse.     CHAPTER VI.      \"Then come the wild weather--come sleet or come snow,      We will stand by each other, however it blow;      Oppression and sickness, and sorrow and pain,      Shall be to our true love as links to the chain.\"                    --_Longfellow_. (From the German.)   \"Courage, sister dear!\" whispered Edward Travilla, putting an arm tenderly about Elsie's waist as they found themselves at the very door of Lester Leland's studio.  Her face had grown very pale and she was trembling with agitation.  Still supporting her with his arm, Edward rapped gently upon the door, and at the same instant it was opened from within by the attending physician, who had just concluded his morning call upon his patient.  He was an Italian of gentlemanly appearance and intelligent countenance.  \"Some friends of Signor Leland: from America?\" he said in good English and with a polite bow.  \"Yes. How is he?\" Edward asked, stepping in and drawing his sister on with him.  \"Sick, signor, very sick, but he will grow better now. I shall expect to see him up in a few weeks,\" the doctor answered with a significant glance and smile as he turned, with a second and still lower bow, to the sweet, fair maiden.  She did not see it, for her eyes were roving round the room--a disorderly and comfortless place enough, but garnished with some gems of art; an unfinished picture was on the easel; there were others with their faces to the wall; models, statues in various stages of completion, and the implements of painter and sculptor were scattered here and there; a screen, an old lounge, a few chairs, and a table littered with books, papers, and drawing materials, completed the furniture of the large, dreary apartment.  An open door gave a glimpse into an inner room, from which came a slight sound as of a restless movement, a sigh or groan.  Pointing to the chairs, the physician invited the strangers to be seated.  Edward put his sister in one and took possession of another close at her side.  \"How soon can we see Mr. Leland?\" he asked, putting his card into the doctor's hand.  \"I will go and prepare Signor Leland for the interview,\" the doctor answered, and disappeared through the open doorway.  \"Good news for you, signor!\" they heard him say in a quiet tone.  \"Ah! let me hear it,\" sighed a well-known voice. \"'As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.'\"  \"You are right, signor, it comes from far-off America. A friend--a young signor has arrived, and asks to see you.\"  \"Ah! his name?\" exclaimed the sick man, with a tremor of gladness in his feeble tones.  \"Here is his card.\"  \"'Edward Travilla!'--ah what joy! Let me see him at once. 'Twill be like a breath of home air!\"  Every word had reached the ears of the two in the studio.  \"Go! go!\" cried Elsie, scarcely above her breath, and Edward rose and went softly in.  \"Not much talk now, signores,\" Elsie heard the doctor say.  \"No; we'll be prudent,\" Edward said, grasping Lester's hand.  \"So good! so kind! more than I dared hope! But how is she? my darling?\" Elsie heard in feeble, faltering, yet eager accents.  \"Well, very well, and longing to come here and nurse you back to health.\"  \"Ah, a glimpse of her sweet face I think would bring me back from the borders of the grave! But I could not expect or ask such a sacrifice.\"  Elsie could wait no longer; she rose and glided with swift, almost noiseless steps to the bedside.  Edward made way for her. Lester looked up, caught sight of her, and a flash of exceeding joy lighted up his pale, emaciated features.  \"Elsie!\"  \"Lester!\"  She dropped on her knees, laid her face on the pillow beside his, and their lips met in a long kiss.  \"O love, love! how sweet, how kind, how dear in you!\" he murmured.  \"I have come to be your nurse,\" she said, with a lovely blush and smile, \"come to stay with you always while God spares our lives.\"  Soon Edward went out and left them together. He had much to attend to, with Dinah and Ben for his helpers. Other and better apartments were speedily rented, cleaned, and comfortably, even elegantly furnished. Their mother had sent them off with full purses and carte blanche to draw upon her bankers for further supplies as they might be needed; and Edward knew it would be her desire to see Elsie and Lester surrounded by the luxuries to which she had been accustomed from her birth.  When night came the doctor pronounced his patient already wonderfully improved.  \"But the signora must leave him to me and the nurse to night,\" he said; \"she is fatigued with her long journey and must take her rest and sleep, or she too will be ill.\"  So Elsie took possession of the pleasant room which had been prepared for her, and casting on the Lord all care for herself and dear ones, and full of glad anticipations for the future, slept long and sweetly.  It was early morning when she woke. That day and several succeeding ones were spent at Lester's side in the gentle ministrations love teaches. There was little talk between them, for he was very weak, and love needs few words; but he slept much of the time with her hand in his, and waking gazed tenderly, joyously into the sweet face.  Happiness proved the best of medicines, and every hour brought a slight increase of strength, a change for the better in all the symptoms.  Meanwhile Edward and the two servants were busy with the laying in of needed supplies and the preparation of the suite of apartments which were to form the new home--Elsie giving a little oversight and direction.  At length their labors were completed, and she was called in to take a critical survey and point out any deficiency, if such there were.  She could find none. \"My dear brother, how can I thank you enough?\" she said, with a look of grateful affection.  \"You are satisfied?\"  \"Oh, entirely! I only wish mamma and the rest could see how comfortable, tasteful, really beautiful you have made these rooms!\"  \"I am very glad our work pleases you. And the doctor tells me that under the combined influence of good nursing and unexpected happiness, Lester is gaining faster than he could have deemed possible. What is the time fixed upon for the ceremony which is to rob you of your patronymic, sister mine?\"  \"Add to it, you should say,\" she corrected, with a charming blush. \"Noon of day after to-morrow is the hour. Edward, do you know that our good doctor is a Waldensian?\"  \"No, I did not, and am pleased to learn it; though I was satisfied that he was no Papist.\"  \"Yes, he is one of that long-persecuted noble race, and will take you to see his pastor on our behalf. I have so greatly admired and loved the Waldenses that I really feel that to be married by one of their pastors will be some small compensation for--for being so far from home and--mamma. O Edward, if she were but here!\"  Her tears were falling fast. He put his arm about her waist, her head dropped upon his shoulder and he smoothed her hair with caressing hand.  \"It is hard for you,\" he said tenderly; \"so different from what you and all of us have looked forward to. But you have been very brave, dear; and what a blessing that your coming is working such a cure for Lester!\"  \"Yes, oh yes! God is very good to me, His blessings are unnumbered!\"  \"It seems a sad sort of bridal for you,\" he said, \"but I shall telegraph the hour to mamma immediately, and they will all be thinking of and praying for you.\"  \"Oh, that is a comfort I had not thought of!\" she exclaimed, with glad tears shining in her eyes. \"What a blessing you are to me, brother dear!\"  Lester was not able to leave his bed or likely to be for weeks, but that she might devote herself the more entirely to him Elsie had consented to be married at once.  She laid aside her mourning for the occasion, and Dinah helped her to array herself for her bridal in a very beautiful evening dress of some white material which had been worn but once before.  \"Pity dars no time to get a new dress, Miss Elsie,\" remarked the handmaiden half regretfully. \"Doe sho' nuff you couldn't look no sweeter and beautifuller dan you does in dis.\"  \"I prefer this, Dinah, because they all--even dear, dear papa--have seen me in it,\" Elsie said, hastily wiping away a tear; \"and I remember he said it became me well. Oh, I can see his proud, fond smile as he said it, and almost feel the touch of his lips; for he bent down and kissed me so tenderly.\"  \"Miss Elsie, I jes b'lieves he's a lookin' at you now dis bressed minute, and ef de res' of dose dat lubs you is far away he'll be sho to stan' close side o' you when de ministah's a saying de words dat'll make you Massa Leland's wife.\"  \"Ah, Dinah, what a sweet thought! and who shall say it may not be so!\"  \"Dar's Massa Edward!\" exclaimed Dinah, as a quick, manly step was heard, followed by a light rap upon the door.  She hastened to open it \"We's ready, Marse Ed'ard.\"  He did not seem to hear or heed her; his eyes were fastened upon his beautiful sister,"]]]
