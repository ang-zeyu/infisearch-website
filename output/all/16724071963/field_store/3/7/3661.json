Burt Company New York  1916        [Illustration]     CHAPTER I.  A MYSTERY.   \"What I would like to know,\" said Frank Chadwick, \"is just how long England intends to put up with the activities of the German submarines in the waters surrounding the British Isles.\"  \"How long?\" echoed Jack Templeton. \"Surely you know that England is already conducting a vigorous campaign against them.\"  \"I don't seem to have heard anything of such a campaign,\" returned Frank dryly; \"but another big liner was torpedoed and sunk off the coast of Ireland yesterday. What are we going to do about it? That's what I want to know.\"  \"I'll tell you a little something you don't seem to know,\" said Jack. \"In the last thirty days, in the neighborhood of a hundred German submarines have disappeared--sunk or captured--no one seems to know which. Nevertheless, it is a fact. Through diplomatic channels word has been received in London that a large number have failed to return to their bases. The German government is much disturbed.\"  \"Where have they gone?\" asked Frank, with some surprise.  \"I don't know. Nobody knows--unless, perhaps, a few high government officials. They have just naturally disappeared--vanished.\"  \"How do you know all this?\"  \"I happened to hear Lord Hastings discussing it with Mr. Churchill while you were out the other day.\"  \"But, of course, Mr. Churchill knows what has happened to the submarines.\"  \"Of course; but he's not telling everything he knows.\"  \"But doesn't Lord Hastings know?\"  \"I suppose so; but he is keeping his information to himself.\"  \"Well, I didn't know any of them had disappeared.\"  \"They have, though, and I heard Mr. Churchill say that the government hoped within another month to have rid British waters entirely of the German submersibles.\"  \"I hope his hope comes true,\" said Frank with a smile.  \"And I; but I would like to know something more of the mystery of these vanishing submarines.\"  Both lads were to learn something more, even sooner than they could possibly have hoped.  The door opened and a man strode into the room. Attired in the full uniform of a British naval commander, he made a striking appearance in his gold and lace. He greeted the two lads with a smile.  \"Well, boys?\" he said.  The newcomer was Lord Hastings, erstwhile distinguished secret service agent and new commander in his British majesty's royal navy. Also, though the fact was known to few, he was a distant cousin of the king himself and one of the most highly trusted officers of the empire.  \"Well, boys?\" he repeated.  \"Well, sir,\" said Frank, \"we were just discussing the mystery of the vanishing submarines.\"  Lord Hastings gazed at the lad in surprise.  \"Vanishing submarines!\" he repeated. \"And tell me, how did you know there were such things as vanishing submarines?\"  \"Why, Jack told me, sir,\" replied Frank.  \"And how did you know it?\" demanded Lord Hastings of Jack.  \"I heard you and Mr. Churchill discussing it, sir,\" replied Jack.  Lord Hastings drew a long breath, evidently of relief.  \"I didn't know we had been so indiscreet,\" he said, half to himself. \"However, there is no harm done, for I know you boys are to be trusted not to repeat what you overhear. I'll tell you this, you two are among the very few who know that any of the German submarines have been accounted for.\"  \"Then it is true?\" asked Frank.  \"Oh, it's true enough,\" replied Lord Hastings. \"Perhaps a hundred of them have disappeared.\"  \"And where are they, sir?\" asked Frank. \"At the bottom?\"  \"That,\" said Lord Hastings with a slow smile, \"is the mystery the German government would like to solve.\"  \"But surely you know, sir.\"  \"If I did, I would not repeat it within these four walls,\" declared Lord Hastings. \"Walls have ears, you know, as is proven by the fact that Jack overheard my conversation with Mr. Churchill.\"  \"I didn't mean to listen, sir,\" interrupted Jack.  \"Oh, I know that,\" replied Lord Hastings. \"But now take my advice, and keep what you know locked close within you.\"  \"We shall, sir,\" replied both lads.  \"Good! Now I have a piece of news for you.\"  The two lads stepped forward eagerly.  \"Are we to go on active service again, sir?\" asked Frank anxiously.  \"It's about time we did,\" mumbled Jack, half to himself.  Lord Hastings smiled as he saw the eager looks upon the faces of both.  \"Well, we have a little work cut out for us,\" he replied quietly.  \"Hooray!\" cried Frank.  A pleased expression fluttered across Jack's face, but he gave voice to no exclamation; he was never as effusive as his chum.  \"I'm glad you're pleased,\" returned Lord Hastings. \"Yes, we shall see active service, at once.\"  \"When do we start, sir?\" asked Frank, his face shining.  \"In the morning.\"  Frank's face fell.  \"I was in hopes it was to-night,\" he replied.  \"Scouting, submarine or what?\" demanded Jack.  \"You will have to wait for an answer to that question,\" said Lord Hastings. \"In the meantime, it would be well this afternoon to get whatever equipment you may need. Your other things, together with mine, are at the bottom of the sea with the old D-16.\"  \"And perhaps,\" said Frank slyly, glancing at Lord Hastings, \"before our present work is over we may know something of the mystery\"--he lowered his voice--\"of the vanishing submarines.\"  Lord Hastings eyed him somewhat coldly.  \"Perhaps,\" he said, and, turning on his heel, left the room.  \"You shouldn't have said that, Frank,\" declared Jack, when they were left alone. \"You remember what he said about the walls having ears.\"  \"I know it,\" said Frank, with sincere regret. \"It just slipped out.\"  \"If you'll take my advice, you'll see that it doesn't slip out again,\" advised Jack.  \"I'll be mum from now on,\" said his chum with a slight smile. \"But now I guess we may as well get what things we may need.\"  \"All right,\" said Jack.  They picked up their caps and made their way from the house.  And while they are engaged in the task of out-fitting themselves for the coming expedition, a few words concerning the two chums may well be written.  Jack Templeton was an English boy some eighteen years of age. Born in the British Isles, he had nevertheless spent most of his life in Africa, his father having conducted a small trading station upon the coast of that continent. Jack's father was a scholar and from him the boy had acquired a good education.  Jack's father died, leaving the boy as a legacy nothing but the little African trading store; and Jack set about to make his own living there and to put by enough so that within a few years he would be able to return to the land of his birth.  And then fate took a hand in shaping his career.  A party from a passing schooner stopped for supplies at Jack's store, and, in the lad's absence, departed without paying for the provisions. Jack set forth to collect. He climbed aboard the schooner before it hove anchor, and, payment being refused by the schooner's crew, a fight ensued.  Jack was forced to take refuge in the hold, while the ship got under way. He succeeded in making his way to the next compartment, where he was surprised to find two other prisoners. These he released, and they proved to be a British secret service agent and Frank Chadwick.  Frank was an American boy. He had been separated from his father, and while seeking him in Naples had been shanghaied aboard the schooner, and there he was, following a mutiny among the crew, as Jack found him. By some resourcefulness and not a little fighting, the lads overcame the crew and made their way back to Jack's home, taking the other prisoner with them.  Here they joined an expedition in which the secret service agent was implicated, and in this manner met Lord Hastings. The latter took an interest in them at once, and, after they had proved their mettle, the British nobleman took them aboard his own vessel as midshipmen.  Then followed a series of exciting adventures, which had led them to many parts of the world. They had been instrumental in the first big victory of the British fleet off Heligoland; they had taken part in the pursuit of the German cruiser _Emden_, \"the terror of the seas,\" and had been in at the death; they had been with the British fleet that had sunk the last German squadron upon the oceans--off the Falkland Islands; they had taken part in many and dangerous other exploits, having more than once been in the heart of the enemy's territory; and always they had returned safely.  But there was once when it seemed that all--Lord Hastings, Frank and Jack--had come to their end. It came about in this wise: After a long cruise, which resulted in great successes, their submarine, D-16, had come to grief in the Dardanelles. They were caught below and it seemed that all must perish.  Then Jack had decided that it was futile for all to die; there was safety for all but one. A deck of cards decided who was to stay, and Jack had drawn the fatal card--the ace of spades.  Officers and crew were launched to safety by means of a torpedo tube; and Jack sat down to await the end. But, in some unaccountable manner, the submarine had suddenly risen to the surface, and Jack, taking advantage of the single instant the vessel was above water before it took its final death plunge, flung himself clear. And thus all were saved.  But, because of their desperate experiences, they were unfit to immediately resume new duties; so all had returned to England until such time as they would be physically in shape again.  Now Jack Templeton, although young in years, was wise in the ways of the world. Also he was of huge stature and as strong as an ox, as he had proved more than once when put to the test. Frank, although"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14711"],["title","The Boy Allies Under the Sea; Or, The Vanishing Submarines (#1)"],["body"," no means as large as his chum, was sturdy and strong, and able to give a good account of himself when occasion required.  The one noticeable difference between the two was that Frank was high-tempered and quick, whereas Jack was always cool and collected. And this very fact had more than once showed that Jack, while not exactly more dependable, could always be relied upon to keep his head.  While both were skillful in the use of weapons, here was a place where Frank excelled. He was a dead shot with rifle or revolver and was a strong swordsman. Jack was a good shot himself and a skillful fencer, but he was not in Frank's class when it came to the use of sword or firearms.  Upon their last expedition Jack and Frank had acted as first and second officers respectively of the submarine, and both now held the rank of first lieutenant. Their promotions had come deservedly. They had the implicit confidence of Lord Hastings and more than once had offered valuable advice, which Lord Hastings had acted upon.  Now a few words about the progress of the war. The seven seas had for some time, save for the presence of the German submarines, been swept clear of German, Austrian and Turkish fighting ships. Not a one remained at large to prey upon the shipping of the Allies. The real fighting strength of the navies of the three central powers still remained in their own fortified bases, well guarded by mines.  The Allies had established such an effective blockade that none dared to venture forth. So the naval situation was practically at a standstill, where indications pointed to its remaining until the main German fleet, bottled up in Heligoland, and the main Austrian fleet in the Adriatic should summon sufficient courage to sally forth and give battle; and there had been nothing to indicate any sudden action on the part of either.  On several occasions British submarines had penetrated the mine fields and created considerable havoc, and aircraft had dropped bombs from the air. But along these lines the German submarines had been more successful and now were the one real menace confronting the naval supremacy of the Entente powers.  Hundreds of ships, large and small, had fallen easy prey to these under-sea terrors. Big ocean liners, crowded with passengers, non-combatants, had been sent to the bottom with terrible loss of innocent lives. Chief among these tragedies laid to the door of the German submarines was the sinking of the Cunard liner _Lusitania_, in which more than a thousand men, women and children had been drowned.  And, so far as the British public knew, England had taken no steps to combat this under-sea peril. However, as Lord Hastings had told the boys at the opening of this story, Great Britain had taken such steps, and that they were effective was evident from his additional statement that in the neighborhood of a hundred submarines had \"vanished.\"  But this warfare was not to end until the submarine evil had been eradicated. The German under-sea craft must be disposed of so effectively as to preclude further danger to British shipping. And it was in this work that Jack and Frank were soon to play a prominent part.     CHAPTER II.  ON ACTIVE SERVICE AGAIN.   For some reason unknown to Jack and Frank, when morning came, Lord Hastings announced that the start would not be made until after nightfall, at which both lads showed keen disappointment.  \"I'll tell you what you can do,\" said Lord Hastings. \"I'll give you an order for my motorboat and you can go to Gravesend during the day if you care to. I'll meet you there at the Lion Inn to-night at 10 o'clock.\"  Frank was delighted.  \"That's better than hanging around here all day, waiting for night to come,\" he said. \"What do you say, Jack?\"  \"Anything to humor you,\" replied the latter with a smile.  \"Take all your things with you,\" said Lord Hastings; \"and, above all, hang on to that motorboat. Don't let anybody get it away from you.\"  \"We'll hang on to it, never fear,\" replied Frank. \"Come on, Jack.\"  \"Wait a minute,\" ordered Lord Hastings. \"You'll need this written order to get the boat.\"  \"I'd forgotten, sir,\" said Frank.  Lord Hastings scribbled rapidly on a piece of paper, which he passed to Jack.  \"This will fix you up,\" he said. \"Now remember, 10 o'clock sharp.\"  The boys nodded their understanding of this order, saluted and left. Getting their things together, they hurried to the river, where Lord Hastings kept his motorboat; and an hour and a half later they were proceeding slowly down the river.  \"Guess none of the enemy will ever get in here,\" declared Frank, after a careful survey of the river.  \"Guess not,\" replied Jack. \"Look at the boats. You wouldn't think we were at war.\"  \"Not if it wasn't for the warships,\" agreed Frank. \"And there are enough of them to make it hot for any hostile fleet. But it's a wonder to me some of these German submarines haven't taken a little trip up the Thames.\"  \"Mines,\" replied Jack briefly.  \"True,\" said Frank, \"but you will remember we took a pretty long jaunt up the Dardanelles, and passed through the Kiel canal.\"  \"And when you stop to think of it, we're pretty lucky to be here right now,\" returned Jack dryly.  \"Well, so we are, if that's the way you look at it. However, I wouldn't mind having another such chance.\"  \"You'll probably get it.\"  Conversation lagged as the boys took in the scenes about them; and there was little more talk during the trip. They stopped more than once, and, loitering along, it was dark when they neared their destination.  As they would have drawn up to the wharf there was a sudden flash of light--gone in a moment--followed by a dark body that swished by them like a flash.  Frank uttered an exclamation of astonishment.  \"See that?\" he demanded.  \"Yes. What could it have been?\"  \"You've got me, but it's heading toward the open sea. Great Scott! Maybe it's an enemy.\"  \"An enemy?\"  \"Yes; you know how anxious the Germans are over this submarine business. Maybe this fellow has been spying about. May be going to report to a German submarine out there some place.\"  \"Think we had better follow and have a look?\" asked Jack.  \"Believe it would be a good idea. Let's go.\"  Without another word, Jack brought the boat about and headed after the one that had so recently dashed by them. In the darkness ahead there was nothing to be seen.  \"Like looking for a needle in a haystack,\" Jack called to Frank.  \"That fellow can't be up to any good,\" declared Frank. \"He showed no light and was going in a terrible hurry. There's something up.\"  \"Does seem that way,\" agreed Jack.  \"Say! Is this as fast as this thing can go?\" demanded Frank. \"We won't ever get any place this way. Let her out a bit.\"  Jack did so and the little boat seemed literally to fly over the dark water. This terrific speed Jack kept up for some time and then slowed down.  \"We'll bump into something at this rate,\" he said; \"and that would settle the whole business. We must be cautious.\"  \"Cautious!\" repeated Frank. \"We won't find that German being cautious.\"  \"If we weren't cautious, it wouldn't do us any good if we did find him,\" argued Jack. \"First thing you know we would be at the bottom.\"  Frank considered this point a moment.  \"Guess you're right,\" he said at last.  \"Swish!\" went something at this moment, and, turning quickly, Frank saw a dark shape speeding away up the river.  \"Hey! There went one the other way,\" he cried to Jack.  \"That so?\" replied Jack anxiously. \"There is something up here, and I'm going to find out what it is.\"  He slowed down even more, and, striking a match, lighted the searchlight, which, until this moment, he had not deemed advisable.  As the light flashed over the water, the lad made out another small motorboat dead ahead, upon which signs of life became apparent. Jack saw figures gesticulating violently; then the boat headed directly for the one occupied by the two boys.  \"Guns, Frank!\" said Jack quietly. \"They are coming at us.\"  \"Leave it to me,\" replied Frank. \"You run the boat. I'll do the rest.\"  \"Don't shoot unless you have to,\" warned Jack.  Frank made no reply.  Jack kept the light full upon the approaching boat. He could see several oilskin-clad figures and that was all; and then came a hail from the oncoming boat.  \"What do you want here?\"  The query was in English. Jack answered the hail.  \"What are you doing here yourself?\" he demanded. \"We are British officers. I command you to surrender.\"  \"More likely German officers,\" was the response. \"Heave to now. I'm coming aboard you.\"  \"If you do you'll get a warm welcome,\" replied Jack.  He stopped the boat and drew his own revolvers.  \"Stand back!\" he cried, as the other boat came closer.  In the glint of the searchlight the men aboard the other boat made out the boys' uniforms. The boat slowed down and the men talked among themselves.  \"They wear British uniforms,\" said one in a low voice.  \"That's no sign they are English,\" said another.  \"Tell 'em to give the countersign,\" said a third.  Another hail came from the boat.  \"Pass the countersign,\" it said.  \"I don't know any countersign,\" replied Jack, and would have said more, had not a voice from the other boat interrupted him.  \"I thought not; hands up now or you are dead men. Quick!\"  Jack made his decision in a moment. Much as he would have liked to fight it out, he determined upon a wiser course.  \"Hands up, Frank,\" he said quietly. \"They've got the drop on us.\"  He raised his hands in the air.  Not so Frank.  \"They won't get me without a fight,\" declared the lad angrily, and, raising his voice, he cried:  \"Come and get me, if you want me.\"  At the same moment he raised his revolver and fired.  \"Here,\" cried Jack angrily, \"don't be a fool. Give me that gun.\"  He seized Frank's wrist and wrenched the revolver from his grasp.  The latter turned on his chum angrily.  \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded. \"Have you turned coward, that you surrender to a couple of Germans without a fight?\"  \"I haven'"]]]
