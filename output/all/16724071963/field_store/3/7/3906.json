Before the Negro got to   the top one white man had hold of his legs, while another rushed up,   pistol in hand. The man who was holding the darkey's legs was jostled   out of the way and the man with the pistol, standing directly beneath   the Negro, sent two bullets at him.    There was a wild scramble, and the vision of a fleeing form in the   Linden yard, but that was the last seen of the black man. The yard was   entered and searched, and neighboring yards were also searched, but not   even the trace of blood was found. It is almost impossible to believe   that the Negro was not wounded, for the man who fired at him held the   pistol almost against the Negro's body.    The shots brought out almost everybody--white--in town, and though there   was nothing to show for the exciting work, except the arrest of the   Negro, who doesn't answer the description of the man wanted, Gretna's   male population had its little fan and felt amply repaid for all the   trouble it was put to, and all the ammunition it wasted.   +BRUTALITY IN NEW ORLEANS+  Mob rule reigned supreme Wednesday, and the scenes that were enacted challenge belief. How many colored men and women were abused and injured is not known, for those who escaped were glad to make a place of refuge and took no time to publish their troubles. The mob made no attempt to find Charles; its only purpose was to pursue, beat and kill any colored man or woman who happened to come in sight. Speaking editorially, the _Picayune_ of Thursday, the twenty-sixth of July, said:   +ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES+  At the Charity Hospital Wednesday night more than a score of people were treated for wounds received at the hands of the mob. Some were able to tell of their mistreatment, and their recitals are briefly given in the _Picayune_ as follows:    Alex. Ruffin, who is quite seriously injured, is a Pullman car porter, a   native of Chicago. He reached New Orleans at 9:20 o'clock last night,   and after finishing his work, boarded a Henry Clay Avenue car to go to   Delachaise Street, where he has a sick son.    \"I hadn't ridden any way,\" said he, \"when I saw a lot of white folks.   They were shouting to 'Get the Niggers.' I didn't know they were after   every colored man they saw, and sat still. Two or three men jumped on   the car and started at me. One of them hit me over the head with a   slungshot, and they started to shooting at me. I jumped out of the car   and ran, although I had done nothing. They shot me in the arm and in the   leg. I would certainly have been killed had not some gentleman taken my   part. If I had known New Orleans was so excited I would never have left   my car.\"    George Morris is the name of a Negro who was badly injured by a mob   which went through the Poydras Market. Morris is employed as watchman   there. He heard the noise of the passing crowd and looked out to see   what the matter was. As soon as the mob saw him its members started   after him.    \"One man hit me over the head with a club,\" said George, after his   wounds had been dressed, \"and somebody cut me in the back. I didn't   hardly think what was the matter at first, but when I saw they were   after me I ran for my life. I ran to the coffee stand, where I work, for   protection, but they were right after me, and somebody shot me in the   back. At last the police got me away from the crowd. Just before I was   hit a friend of mine, who was in the crowd, said, 'You had better go   home, Nigger; they're after your kind.' I didn't know then what he   meant. I found out pretty quick.\"    Morris is at the hospital. He is a perfect wreck, and while he will   probably get well, he will have had a close call.    Esther Fields is a Negro washerwoman who lives at South Claiborne and   Toledano Streets. She was at home when she heard a big noise and went   out to investigate. She ran into the arms of the mob, and was beaten   into insensibility in less time than it takes to tell it. Esther is   being treated at the charity hospital, and should be able to get about   in a few days. The majority of her bruises are about the head.    T.P. Sanders fell at the hands of the Jackson Avenue mob. He lives at   1927 Jackson Avenue, and was sitting in front of his home when he saw   the crowd marching out the street. He stayed to see what the excitement   was all about, and was shot in the knee and thorax and horribly beaten   about the head before the mob came to the conclusion that he had been   done for, and passed on. The ambulance was called and he was picked up   and carried to the charity hospital, where his wounds were dressed and   pronounced serious.    Oswald McMahon is nothing more than a boy. He was shot in the leg and   afterward carried to the hospital. His injuries are very slight.    Dan White is another charity hospital patient. He is a Negro roustabout   and was sitting in the bar room at Poydras and Franklin Streets when a   mob passed along and espied him. He was shot in the hand, and would have   been roughly dealt with had some policeman not been luckily near and   rescued him.    In addition to the Negroes who suffered from the violence of the mob   there were several patients treated at the hospital during the night who   had been with the rioters and had been struck by stray bullets or   injured in scuffles. None of this class were hurt to any extent. They   got their wounds dressed and went out again.   +WAS CHARLES A DESPERADO?+  The press of the country has united in declaring that Robert Charles was a desperado. As usual, when dealing with a negro, he is assumed to be guilty because he is charged. Even the most conservative of journals refuse to ask evidence to prove that the dead man was a criminal, and that his life had been given over to lawbreaking. The minute that the news was flashed across the country that he had shot a white man it was at once declared that he was a fiend incarnate, and that when he was killed the community would be ridden of a black-hearted desperado. The reporters of the New Orleans papers, who were in the best position to trace the record of this man's life, made every possible effort to find evidence to prove that he was a villain unhung. With all the resources at their command, and inspired by intense interest to paint him as black a villain as possible, these reporters signally failed to disclose a single indictment which charged Robert Charles with a crime. Because they failed to find any legal evidence that Charles was a lawbreaker and desperado his accusers gave full license to their imagination and distorted the facts that they had obtained, in every way possible, to prove a course of criminality, which the records absolutely refuse to show.  Charles had his first encounter with the police Monday night, in which he was shot in the street duel which was begun by the police after Officer Mora had beaten Charles three or four times over the head with his billy in an attempt to make an illegal arrest. In defending himself against the combined attack of two officers with a billy and their guns upon him, Charles shot Officer Mora and escaped.  Early Tuesday morning Charles was traced to Dryades Street by officers who were instructed to kill him on sight. There, again defending himself, he shot and killed two officers. This, of course, in the eyes of the American press, made him a desperado. The New Orleans press, in substantiating the charges that he was a desperado, make statements which will be interesting to examine.  In the first place the _New Orleans Times-Democrat_, of July 25, calls Charles a \"ravisher and a daredevil.\" It says that from all sources that could be searched \"the testimony was cumulative that the character of the murderer, Robert Charles, is that of a daredevil and a fiend in human form.\" Then in the same article it says:    The belongings of Robert Charles which were found in his room were a   complete index to the character of the man. Although the room and its   contents were in a state of chaos on account of the frenzied search for   clews by officers and citizens, an examination of his personal effects   revealed the mental state of the murderer and the rancor in his heart   toward the Caucasian race. Never was the adage, \"A little learning is a   dangerous thing,\" better exemplified than in the case of the negro who   shot to death the two officers.  His room was searched, and the evidence upon which the charge that he was a desperado consisted of pamphlets in support of Negro emigration to Liberia. On his mantel-piece there was found a bullet mold and an outfit for reloading cartridges. There were also two pistol scabbards and a bottle of cocaine. The other evidences that Charles was a desperado the writer described as follows:    In his room were found negro periodicals and other \"race\" propaganda,   most of which was in the interest of the negro's emigration to Liberia.   There were Police Gazettes strewn about his room and other papers of a   similar character. Well-worn textbooks, bearing his name written in his   own scrawling handwriting, and well-filled copybooks found in his trunk   showed that he had burnt the midnight oil, and was desirous of improving   himself intellectually in order that he might conquer the hated white   race. Much of the literature found among his chattels was of a   superlatively vituperative character, and attacked the white race in   unstinted language and asserted the equal rights of the Negro.    Charles was evidently the local agent of the _Voice of Missions_, a   \"religious\" paper, published at Atlanta, as great bundles of that sheet   were found. It is edited by one Bishop Turner, and seems to be the   official organ of all haters of the white race. Its editorials are   anarchistic in the extreme, and urge upon the negro that the sooner he   realizes that he is as good as the white man the better it will be for   him.

FREDERICK DOUGLASS'S LETTER  DEAR MISS WELLS:  Let me give you thanks for your faithful paper on the lynch abomination now generally practiced against colored people in the South. There has been no word equal to it in convincing power. I have spoken, but my word is feeble in comparison. You give us what you know and testify from actual knowledge. You have dealt with the facts with cool, painstaking fidelity, and left those naked and uncontradicted facts to speak for themselves.  Brave woman! you have done your people and mine a service which can neither be weighed nor measured. If the American conscience were only half alive, if the American church and clergy were only half Christianized, if American moral sensibility were not hardened by persistent infliction of outrage and crime against colored people, a scream of horror, shame, and indignation would rise to Heaven wherever your pamphlet shall be read.  But alas! even crime has power to reproduce itself and create conditions favorable to its own existence. It sometimes seems we are deserted by earth and Heaven--yet we must still think, speak and work, and trust in the power of a merciful God for final deliverance.  Very truly and gratefully yours, FREDERICK DOUGLASS Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C.

Beginning with the emancipation of the Negro, the inevitable result of unbribled power exercised for two and a half centuries, by the white man over the Negro, began to show itself in acts of conscienceless outlawry. During the slave regime, the Southern white man owned the Negro body and soul. It was to his interest to dwarf the soul and preserve the body. Vested with unlimited power over his slave, to subject him to any and all kinds of physical punishment, the white man was still restrained from such punishment as tended to injure the slave by abating his physical powers and thereby reducing his financial worth. While slaves were scourged mercilessly, and in countless cases inhumanly treated in other respects, still the white owner rarely permitted his anger to go so far as to take a life, which would entail upon him a loss of several hundred dollars. The slave was rarely killed, he was too valuable; it was easier and quite as effective, for discipline or revenge, to sell him \"Down South.\"  But Emancipation came and the vested interests of the white man in the Negro's body were lost. The white man had no right to scourge the emancipated Negro, still less has he a right to kill him. But the Southern white people had been educated so long in that school of practice, in which might makes right, that they disdained to draw strict lines of action in dealing with the Negro. In slave times the Negro was kept subservient and submissive by the frequency and severity of the scourging, but, with freedom, a new system of intimidation came into vogue; the Negro was not only whipped and scourged; he was killed.  Not all nor nearly all of the murders done by white men, during the past thirty years in the South, have come to light, but the statistics as gathered and preserved by white men, and which have not been questioned, show that during these years more than ten thousand Negroes have been killed in cold blood, without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution. And yet, as evidence of the absolute impunity with which the white man dares to kill a Negro, the same record shows that during all these years, and for all these murders only three white men have been tried, convicted, and executed. As no white man has been lynched for the murder of colored people, these three executions are the only instances of the death penalty being visited upon white men for murdering Negroes.  Naturally enough the commission of these crimes began to tell upon the public conscience, and the Southern white man, as a tribute to the nineteenth-century civilization, was in a manner compelled to give excuses for his barbarism. His excuses have adapted themselves to the emergency, and are aptly outlined by that greatest of all Negroes, Frederick Douglass, in an article of recent date, in which he shows that there have been three distinct eras of Southern barbarism, to account for which three distinct excuses have been made.  The first excuse given to the civilized world for the murder of unoffending Negroes was the necessity of the white man to repress and stamp out alleged \"race riots.\" For years immediately succeeding the war there was an appalling slaughter of colored people, and the wires usually conveyed to northern people and the world the intelligence, first, that an insurrection was being planned by Negroes, which, a few hours later, would prove to have been vigorously resisted by white men, and controlled with a resulting loss of several killed and wounded. It was always a remarkable feature in these insurrections and riots that only Negroes were killed during the rioting, and that all the white men escaped unharmed.  From 1865 to 1872, hundreds of colored men and women were mercilessly murdered and the almost invariable reason assigned was that they met their death by being alleged participants in an insurrection or riot. But this story at last wore itself out. No insurrection ever materialized; no Negro rioter was ever apprehended and proven guilty, and no dynamite ever recorded the black man's protest against oppression and wrong. It was too much to ask thoughtful people to believe this transparent story, and the southern white people at last made up their minds that some other excuse must be had.  Then came the second excuse, which had its birth during the turbulent times of reconstruction. By an amendment to the Constitution the Negro was given the right of franchise, and, theoretically at least, his ballot became his invaluable emblem of citizenship. In a government \"of the people, for the people, and by the people,\" the Negro's vote became an important factor in all matters of state and national politics. But this did not last long. The southern white man would not consider that the Negro had any right which a white man was bound to respect, and the idea of a republican form of government in the southern states grew into general contempt. It was maintained that \"This is a white man's government,\" and regardless of numbers the white man should rule. \"No Negro domination\" became the new legend on the sanguinary banner of the sunny South, and under it rode the Ku Klux Klan, the Regulators, and the lawless mobs, which for any cause chose to murder one man or a dozen as suited their purpose best. It was a long, gory campaign; the blood chills and the heart almost loses faith in Christianity when one thinks of Yazoo, Hamburg, Edgefield, Copiah, and the countless massacres of defenseless Negroes, whose only crime was the attempt to exercise their right to vote.  But it was a bootless strife for colored people. The government which had made the Negro a citizen found itself unable to protect him. It gave him the right to vote, but denied him the protection which should have maintained that right. Scourged from his home; hunted through the swamps; hung by midnight raiders, and openly murdered in the light of day, the Negro clung to his right of franchise with a heroism which would have wrung admiration from the hearts of savages. He believed that in that small white ballot there was a subtle something which stood for manhood as well as citizenship, and thousands of brave black men went to their graves, exemplifying the one by dying for the other.  The white man's victory soon became complete by fraud, violence, intimidation and murder. The franchise vouchsafed to the Negro grew to be a \"barren ideality,\" and regardless of numbers, the colored people found themselves voiceless in the councils of those whose duty it was to rule. With no longer the fear of \"Negro Domination\" before their eyes, the white man's second excuse became valueless. With the Southern governments all subverted and the Negro actually eliminated from all participation in state and national elections, there could be no longer an excuse for killing Negroes to prevent \"Negro Domination.\"  Brutality still continued; Negroes were whipped, scourged, exiled, shot and hung whenever and wherever it pleased the white man so to treat them, and as the civilized world with increasing persistency held the white people of the South to account for its outlawry, the murderers invented the third excuse--that Negroes had to be killed to avenge their assaults upon women. There could be framed no possible excuse more harmful to the Negro and more unanswerable if true in its sufficiency for the white man.  Humanity abhors the assailant of womanhood, and this charge upon the Negro at once placed him"]]]
