Amen._     A CHRISTMAS PRAYER FOR LONELY FOLKS     Lord God of the solitary,   Look upon me in my loneliness.   Since I may not keep this Christmas in the home,   Send it into my heart.    Let not my sins cloud me in,   But shine through them with forgiveness in the face of the child           Jesus.   Put me in loving remembrance of the lowly lodging in the stable of           Bethlehem,   The sorrows of the blessed Mary, the poverty and exile of the           Prince of Peace.   For His sake, give me a cheerful courage to endure my lot,   And an inward comfort to sweeten it.    Purge my heart from hard and bitter thoughts.   Let no shadow of forgetting come between me and friends far away:   Bless them in their Christmas mirth:   Hedge me in with faithfulness,   That I may not grow unworthy to meet them again.    Give me good work to do,   That I may forget myself and find peace in doing it for Thee.   Though I am poor, send me to carry some gift to those who are           poorer,   Some cheer to those who are more lonely.   Grant me the joy to do a kindness to one of Thy little ones:   Light my Christmas candle at the gladness of an innocent and           grateful heart.    Strange is the path where Thou leadest me:   Let me not doubt Thy wisdom, nor lose Thy hand.   Make me sure that Eternal Love is revealed in Jesus, Thy dear Son,   To save us from sin and solitude and death.   Teach me that I am not alone,   But that many hearts, all round the world,   Join with me through the silence, while I pray in His name:    _Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name._   _Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven._   _Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we           forgive our debtors._   _And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:_   _For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.           Amen._         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14573"],["title","The Truce of God (#0)"],["body","TRUCE OF GOD  by  MARY ROBERTS RINEHART  Decorations by Harold Sichel  New York George H. Doran Company  1920        [Illustration: \"Softly,\" he said ... \"No harsh words.\"]    [Illustration]    [Illustration: Chapter One]     The Truce of God  I   Now the day of the birth of our Lord dawned that year grey and dreary, and a Saturday. But, despite the weather, in the town at the foot of the hill there was rejoicing, as befitted so great a festival. The day before a fat steer had been driven to the public square and there dressed and trussed for the roasting. The light of morning falling on his carcass revealed around it great heaps of fruits and vegetables. For the year had been prosperous.  But the young overlord sulked in his castle at the cliff top, and bit his nails. From Thursday evening of each week to the morning of Monday, Mother Church had decreed peace, a Truce of God. Three full days out of each week his men-at-arms polished their weapons and grew fat. Three full days out of each week his grudge against his cousin, Philip of the Black Beard, must feed on itself.  His dark mood irritated the Bishop of Tours, who had come to speak of certain scandalous things which had come to his ears. Charles heard him through.  \"She took refuge with him,\" he said violently, when the Bishop had finished. \"She knew what hate there was between us, yet she took refuge with him.\"  \"The question is,\" said the Bishop mildly, \"why she should have been driven to refuge. A gentle lady, a faithful wife--\"  \"Deus!\" The young _seigneur_ clapped a fist on the table. \"You know well the reason. A barren woman!\"  \"She had borne you a daughter.\"  But Charles was far gone in rage and out of hand. The Bishop took his offended ears to bed, and left him to sit alone by the dying fire, with bitterness for company.  Came into the courtyard at midnight the Christmas singers from the town; the blacksmith rolling a great bass, the crockery-seller who sang falsetto, and a fool of the village who had slept overnight in a manger on the holy eve a year before and had brought from it, not wit, but a voice from Heaven. A miracle of miracles.  The men-at-arms in the courtyard stood back to give them space. They sang with eyes upturned, with full-throated vigour, albeit a bit warily, with an anxious glance now and then toward those windows beyond which the young lord sulked by the fire.      \"The Light of Light Divine,     True Brightness undefiled.     He bears for us the shame of sin,     A holy, spotless Child.\"  They sang to the frosty air.  When neither money nor burning fagot was flung from the window they watched, they took their departure, relieved if unrewarded.  In former years the lady of the Castle had thrown them alms. But times had changed. Now the gentle lady was gone, and the _seigneur_ sulked in the hall.  With the dawn Charles the Fair took himself to bed. And to him, pattering barefoot along stone floors, came Clotilde, the child of his disappointment.  \"Are you asleep?\"  One arm under his head, he looked at her without answer.  \"It is the anniversary of the birth of our Lord,\" she ventured. \"Today He is born. I thought--\" She put out a small, very cold hand. But he turned his head away.  \"Back to your bed,\" he said shortly. \"Where is your nurse, to permit this?\"  The child's face fell. Something she had expected, some miracle, perhaps, a softening of the lord her father, so that she might ask of him a Christmas boon.  The Bishop had said that Christmas miracles were often wrought, and she herself knew that this was true. Had not the Fool secured his voice, so that he who had been but lightly held became the village troubadour, and slept warm and full at night?  She had gone to the Bishop with this the night before.  \"If I should lie in a manger all night,\" she said, standing with her feet well apart and looking up at him, \"would I become a boy?\"  The Bishop tugged at his beard. \"A boy, little maid! Would you give up your blue eyes and your soft skin to be a roystering lad?\"  \"My father wishes for a son,\" she had replied and the cloud that was over the Castle shadowed the Bishop's eyes.  \"It would not be well,\" he replied, \"to tamper with the works of the Almighty. Pray rather for this miracle, that your father's heart be turned toward you and toward the lady, your mother.\"  So during much of the night she had asked this boon steadfastly. But clearly she had not been heard.  \"Back to your bed!\" said her father, and turned his face away.  So she went as far as the leather curtain which hung in the doorway and there she turned.  \"Why do they sing?\" she had asked the Bishop, of the blacksmith and the others, and he had replied into his beard, \"To soften the hard of heart.\"  So she turned in the doorway and sang in her reedy little voice, much thinned by the cold, sang to soften her young father's heart.      \"The Light of Light Divine,     True Brightness undefined.     He bears for us the shame of sin,     A holy, spotless Child.\"  But the song failed. Perhaps it was the wrong hour, or perhaps it was because she had not slept in the manger and brought forth the gift of voice.  \"Blood of the martyrs!\" shouted her father, and raised himself on his elbow. \"Are you mad? Get back to your bed. I shall have a word with someone for this.\"  Whether it had softened him or not it had stirred him, so she made her plea.  \"It is His birthday. I want to see my mother.\"  Then she ducked under the curtain and ran as fast as she could back to where she belonged. Terror winged her feet. She had spoken a forbidden word.  All sleep was gone from Charles the Fair. He lay on his elbow in his bed and thought of things that he wished to forget: of the wife he had put away because in eight years she had borne him no son; of his great lands that would go to his cousin, Philip of the Black Beard, whom he hated; of girls in the plain who wooed him with soft eyes and whom he passed by; of a Jew who lay in a dungeon beneath the Castle because of usury and other things.  After a time he slept again, but lightly, for the sun came in through the deep, unshaded window and fell on his face and on the rushes that covered the floor. And in his sleep the grimness was gone, and the pride. And his mouth, which was sad, contended with the firmness of his chin.  Clotilde went back to her bed and tucked her feet under her to warm them. In the next room her nurse lay on a bed asleep, with her mouth open; outside in the stone corridor a page slept on a skin, with a corner over him against the draught.  She thought things over while she warmed her feet. It was clear that singing did not soften all hearts. Perhaps she did not sing very well. But the Bishop had said that after one had done a good act one might pray with hope. She decided to do a good act and then to pray to see her mother; she would pray also to become a boy so that her father might care for her. But the Bishop considered it a little late for such a prayer.  She made terms with the Almighty, sitting on her bed.  \"I shall do a good act,\" she said, \"on this the birthday of Thy Son, and after that I shall ask for the thing Thou knowest of.\"  After much thinking, she decided to free the Jew. And being, after all, her father's own child, she acted at once.  It was a matter of many cold stone steps and much fumbling with bars. But Guillem the gaoler had crept up to the hall and lay sleeping by the fire, with a dozen dogs about him. It was the time of the Truce of God, and vigilance was relaxed. Also Guillem was in love with a girl of the village and there was talk that the _seigneur_, in his loneliness, had seen that she was beautiful. So Guillem slept to forget, and the Jew lay awake because of rats and anxiety.  The Jew rose from the floor when Clotilde threw the grating open, and blinked at her with weary and gentle eyes.  \"It is the birthday of our Lord,\" said Clotilde, \"and I am doing a good deed so that I may see my mother again. But go quickly.\" Then she remembered something the Bishop had said to her, and eyed him thoughtfully as he stared at her.  \"But you do not love our Lord!\"  The Jew put out his foot quietly so that she could not close the grating again. But he smiled into her eyes.  \"Your Lord was a Jew,\" he said.  This reassured her. It seemed to double the quality of mercy. She threw the door wide and the usurer went out cautiously, as if suspecting a trap. But patches of sunlight, barred with black, showed the way clear. He should have gone at once, but he waited to give her the blessing of his people. Even then, having started, he went back to her. She looked so small in that fearsome place.  \"If there is something you wish, little maid, and I can secure it for you--\"  \"I wish but two things,\" she said. \"I wish to be a boy, only I fear it is too late for that. The Bishop thinks so. And I wish to see my mother.\"  And these being beyond his gift, and not contained in the pack he had fastened to his shoulders, he only shook his head and took his cautious way toward freedom.  Having tried song and a good deed, Clotilde went back again to her room, stepping over the page, who had curled himself up in a ball, like a puppy, and still slept. She crossed her hands on her breast and raised her eyes as she had been taught.  \"Now, O Lord,\" she said, \"I have tried song and I have tried a good deed. I wish to see my mother.\"  Perhaps it was merely coincidence that the level rays of the morning sun just then fell on the crucifix that hung on the wall, and that although during all the year it seemed to be but of wood and with closed eyes, now it flashed as with life and the eyes were open.  \"He was one of Your people,\" she said to the crucifix, \"and by now he is down the hill.\"     [Illustration: Chapter Two]     II   Now it was the custom on the morning of the Holy day for the _seigneur_ to ride his finest stallion to the top of the hill, where led a steep road down into the town.
