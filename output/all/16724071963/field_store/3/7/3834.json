I wish the whole world could see you!\"  \"Our own little world at Ion is all I should ask for,\" she responded in tremulous tones.  \"Yes, it must be very hard for you,\" he said; \"especially not to have mamma here, you who have always clung to her so closely. Such a different wedding as it is from hers! But it's very romantic you know,\" he added jocosely, trying to raise her drooping spirits.  \"Ah, I am forgetting a piece of news I have to tell I met an American gentleman and his daughter, the other day, fell into conversation with him, and learned that we have several common acquaintances I think we were mutually pleased, and I have asked him and his daughter in to the wedding; thinking it would not be unpleasant to you, and we should thus have two more witnesses.\"  \"Perhaps it is best we should,\" she returned, in her sweet, gentle way, yet looking somewhat disturbed.  \"I'm afraid I ought to have consulted you first,\" he said. \"I'm sorry, but it is too late now His name is Love; his daughter--an extremely pretty girl by the way--he calls Zoe.\"  Ben now came to the door to say that all was in readiness--the minister, the doctor, and the other gentleman and a lady had arrived.  Edward gave his arm to his sister and led her into the room, to which Lester had been carried a few moments before, and where he lay on a luxurious couch, propped up with pillows into a half-sitting posture.  A touch of color came into his pale cheeks, and his eyes shone with love and joy as they rested upon his lovely bride, as Edward led her to the side of his couch.  Dinah and Ben followed, taking their places near the door and watching the proceedings with interest and sympathy.  The minister stood up, the doctor, the stranger guests, the nurse also, and the ceremony began.  Elsie's eyes were full of tears, but her sweet low tones were distinct and clear as she took the marriage vows.  So were Lester's; his voice seemed stronger than it had been for weeks, and when he took the small white-gloved hand in his, the grasp was firm as well as tender.  \"One kiss, my love, my wife!\" he pleaded when the ceremony was ended.  A soft blush suffused the fair face and neck, but the request was granted; she bent over him and for an instant their lips met.  Then Edward embraced her with brotherly affection and good wishes. He grasped Lester's hand in cordial greeting, then turned and introduced his new-made friends to the bride and groom.  A table loaded with delicacies stood in an adjoining room, and thither the brother and sister and their guests now repaired, while for a short season the invalid was left to quietness and repose that he might recover from the unwonted excitement and fatigue.     CHAPTER VII.      \"Therein he them fall fair did entertain,      Not with such forged shows as fitter been      For courting fools, that courtesies would faine,      But with entire affection plain.\"           --_Spenser's \"Fairy Queen.\"_   One bright morning in November the Ion family were gathered about the breakfast-table. Rosie and Walter were there for the first time since their severe illness, a trifle pale and thin still, but nearly in usual health, and very glad to be permitted to take their old places at the table.  Mrs. Dinsmore had returned from her sojourn at the Laurels, the home of her daughter Rose; the grandchildren there, whom she had been nursing, having also recovered their health; and so the places of the eldest son and daughter of the house were the only vacant ones.  Both Elsie and Edward were sorely missed, especially by the mother and Violet.  \"It seems time we had letters again from our absentees, papa,\" Mrs. Travilla remarked as she poured the coffee. \"We have had none since the telegram giving the hour for the wedding.\"  \"No, but perhaps we may hear this morning--the mail has not come yet.\"  \"Yes, grandpa; here comes Solon with it,\" said Harold, glancing from the window.  In a few moments the man came in bringing the mail-bag, which he handed to Mr. Dinsmore.  All looked on with interest, the younger ones in eager expectation, while their grandfather opened it and examined the contents.  \"Yes, daughter, there is a letter from each of them, both directed to you,\" he said, glancing over the addresses on several letters which he now held in his hand. \"Here, Tom,\" to the servant in waiting, \"take these to your mistress. Don't read them to the neglecting of your breakfast,\" he added with a smile, again addressing Mrs. Travilla.  \"No, sir; they will keep,\" she answered, returning the smile; \"and you shall all share the pleasure of their perusal with me after prayers. Doubtless they give the particulars we all want so much to learn.\"  They all gathered round her at the appointed time. She held the letters open in her hand, having already given them a cursory examination lest there should be some little confidence intended for none but \"mother's\" eye.  \"Papa,\" she said, looking up half tearfully, half smilingly at him as he stood at her side, \"the deed is indeed done, and another claims my first-born darling as his own.\"  \"You have not lost her, Elsie dearest, but have gained a son; and I trust we shall have them both with us ere long,\" he responded, bending down to touch his lips to the brow still as smooth and fair as in the days of her girlhood.  \"Poor dear Elsie! how she must have missed and longed for you, dearest mamma!\" Violet sighed, kneeling close to her mother's chair and putting her arms around her.  \"What is it? all about Elsie's wedding?\" asked Herbert. \"Please let us hear it, mamma. The telegram told nothing but the hour when it was to be, and I was so surprised, for I never understood that that was what she went away for.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Harold; \"though I suppose it was very stupid in us not to understand.\"  \"Who did get married with my sister Elsie, mamma?\" asked little Walter.  \"Mr. Leland, my son.\"  \"But I thought he was most dead,\" remarked Rosie in surprise.  \"He has been very ill,\" her mother said, \"but is improving fast, though not yet able to sit up.\"  Rosie, opening her eyes wide in astonishment, was beginning another question when Harold stopped her.  \"Wait, Rosie, don't you see mamma is going to read the letters? They will tell us all about it, I presume.\"  \"I shall read Edward's first, it gives a very minute account of what they have done since he wrote us last, just after their arrival in Rome,\" the mother said. \"He is a good boy to take the trouble to tell us everything in detail; is he not, papa?\"  \"Yes,\" Mr. Dinsmore assented, seating himself by her side and taking Rosie upon one knee, Walter on the other; \"and so good a mother richly deserves good, thoughtful sons and daughters, ever ready to do all in their power to promote her happiness, or afford her pleasure. Does she not, children?\"  \"Yes, grandpa, indeed she does!\" they replied in chorus.  Her sweet soft eyes glistened with happy tears as she sent a loving glance round the little circle; then all becoming perfectly quiet and attentive, she began to read.  Edward's first item of news was that the marriage had just taken place; the next that Lester's health was steadily improving. Then came a description of the rooms they were occupying; both as they were when first seen by Elsie and himself and as they had become under his renovating and improving hands.  After that he drew a vivid picture of Elsie's appearance in her bridal robes, told who were present at the ceremony, who performed it, how the several actors acquitted themselves, and what refreshments were served after it was over.  He said he thought happiness was working a rapid cure with Lester, and that from all he could see and hear, his success as both painter and sculptor was already assured.  Elsie's themes were the same, but she had much to say of Edward's kind thoughtfulness, his energy and helpfulness; \"the best and kindest of brothers,\" she called him, and as she read the words the mother's eyes shone with love and pride in her eldest son.  But her voice trembled, and the tears had to be wiped away once and again when she came to that part of the letter in which Elsie told of her feelings as she robed herself for her bridal with none to assist but Dinah; how sad was her heart, dearly as she loved Lester, and how full of longing for home and mother and all the dear ones so far away; then of the comfort she found in the idea that possibly the dear departed father might be near her in spirit.  \"Was it wrong, mamma,\" she asked, \"to think he might perhaps be allowed to be a ministering spirit to me in my loneliness? and to find pleasure in the thought?\"  \"Mamma, what do you think about it?\" asked Herbert.  \"I do not know that we have any warrant for the idea in the Scriptures,\" she answered; \"it seems to be one of the things that is not revealed; yet I see no harm in taking comfort in the thought that it may be so. My poor lonely darling! I am glad she had that consolation. Ah, papa, what a different wedding from mine!\"  \"Yes,\" he said, \"and from what we thought hers would be. But I trust she will never see cause to regret the step she has taken. Lester is worth saving even at the sacrifice she has made.\"  His daughter looked at him with glistening eyes. \"Thank you, papa, that is a good thought, and consoles me "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14884"],["title","Famous Violinists of To-day and Yesterday (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team.

In \"Famous Violinists\" the writer has endeavoured to follow the same general plan as in \"Famous Singers,\" viz., to give a \"bird's-eye view\" of the most celebrated violinists from the earliest times to the present day rather than a detailed account of a very few. Necessarily, those who have been prominently before the public as performers are selected in preference to those who have been more celebrated as teachers.  It was at first intended to arrange the chapters according to \"schools,\" but it soon became evident that such a plan would lead to inextricable confusion, and it was found best to follow the chronological order of birth.  The \"Chronological Table\" is compiled from the best existing authorities, and is not an effort to bring together a large number of names. If such were the desire, there would be no difficulty in filling up a large volume with names of the violinists of good capabilities, who are well known in their own cities.  HENRY C. LAHEE.

CHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTORY.   There is no instrument of music made by the hands of man that holds such a powerful sway over the emotions of every living thing capable of hearing, as the violin. The singular powers of this beautiful instrument have been eloquently eulogised by Oliver Wendell Holmes, in the following words:  \"Violins, too. The sweet old Amati! the divine Stradivari! played on by ancient maestros until the bow hand lost its power, and the flying fingers stiffened. Bequeathed to the passionate young enthusiast, who made it whisper his hidden love, and cry his inarticulate longings, and scream his untold agonies, and wail his monotonous despair. Passed from his dying hand to the cold virtuoso, who let it slumber in its case for a generation, till, when his hoard was broken up, it came forth once more, and rode the stormy symphonies of royal orchestras, beneath the rushing bow of their lord and leader. Into lonely prisons with improvident artists; into convents from which arose, day and night, the holy hymns with which its tones were blended; and back again to orgies, in which it learned to howl and laugh as if a legion of devils were shut up in it; then, again, to the gentle _dilettante_, who calmed it down with easy melodies until it answered him softly as in the days of the old maestros; and so given into our hands, its pores all full of music, stained like the meerschaum through and through with the concentrated hue and sweetness of all the harmonies which have kindled and faded on its strings.\"  Such, indeed, has been the history of many a noble instrument fashioned years and years ago, in the days when violin playing did not hold the same respect and admiration that it commands at the present time.  The evolution of the violin is a matter which can be traced back to the dark ages, but the fifteenth century may be considered as the period when the art of making instruments of the viol class took root in Italy. It cannot be said, however, that the violin, with the modelled back which gives its distinctive tone, made its appearance until the middle of the sixteenth century. In France, England, and Germany, there was very little violin making until the beginning of the following century. Andrea Amati was born in 1520, and he was the founder of the great Cremona school of violin makers, of which Nicolo Amati, the grandson of Andrea, was the most eminent. The art of violin making reached its zenith in Italy at the time of Antonio Stradivari, who lived at Cremona. He was born in 1644, and lived until 1737, continuing his labours almost to the day of his death, for an instrument is in existence made by him in the year in which he died. It is an interesting fact that the art of violin making in Italy developed at the time when the painters of Italy displayed their greatest genius, and when the fine arts were encouraged by the most distinguished patronage.  As the art of violin making developed, so did that of violin playing, but, whereas the former reached its climax with Stradivari, the latter is still being developed, as new writers and players find new difficulties and new effects. While there are many proofs that orchestras existed, and that violins of all sizes were used in ecclesiastical music, there is still some doubt as to who was the first solo violinist of eminence. The earliest of whom we have any account worthy of mention, was Baltazarini, a native of Piedmont, who went to France in 1577 to superintend the music of Catharine de Medici. In 1581 he composed the music for the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeuse with Mlle. de Vaudemont, sister of the queen, and this is said to have been the origin of the heroic and historical ballet in France.  The progress of violin playing can also be judged somewhat by the compositions written for the instrument. Of these the earliest known is a \"Romanesca per violone Solo e Basso se piaci,\" and some dances, by Biagio Marini, published in 1620. This contains the \"shake.\" Then there is a \"Toccata\" for violin solo, by Paolo Quagliati, published in 1623, and a collection of violin pieces by Carlo Farina, published in 1627 at Dresden, in which the variety of bowing, double stopping, and chords shows a great advance in the demands upon the execution.  Farina held the position of solo violinist at the Court of Saxony, and has been called the founder of the race of violin virtuosi. One of his compositions, named \"Cappriccio Stravagante,\" requires the instrument to imitate the braying of an ass, and other sounds belonging to the animal kingdom, as well as the twanging of guitars and the fife and drum of the soldier.  Eighteen sonatas composed by Giovanni Battista Fontana, and published at Venice in 1641, show a distinct advance in style, and Tomasso Antonio Vitali, himself a famous violinist, wrote a \"Chaconne\" of such merit that it was played by no less a virtuoso than Joachim, at the Monday popular concerts in London, in 1870, nearly two hundred years after its composition.  Italy was the home of the violin, of composition for the violin, and of violin playing, for the first school was the old Italian school, and from Italy, by means of her celebrated violinists, who travelled and spread throughout Europe, the other schools were established.  Violin playing grew in favour in Italy, France, Germany, and England at about the same time, but in England it was many years before the violinist held a position of any dignity. The fiddle, as it was called, was regarded by the gentry with profound contempt. Butler, in \"Hudibras,\" refers to one Jackson, who lost a leg in the service of the Roundheads, and became a professional \"fiddler:\"    \"A squeaking engine he apply'd   Unto his neck, on northeast side,   Just where the hangman does dispose,   To special friends, the knot or noose;   For 'tis great grace, when statesmen straight   Dispatch a friend, let others wait.    His grisly beard was long and thick,   With which he strung his fiddle-stick;   For he to horse-tail scorned to owe,   For what on his own chin did grow.\"  Many years later Purcell, the composer, wrote a catch in which the merits of a violin maker named Young, and his son, a violin player, are recorded. The words are as follows:    \"You scrapers that want a good fiddle, well strung,   You must go to the man that is old while he's Young;   But if this same Fiddle, you fain would play bold,   You must go to his son, who'll be Young when he's old.   There's old Young and young Young, both men of renown,   Old sells and young plays the best Fiddle in town,   Young and old live together, and may they live long,   Young to play an old Fiddle; old to sell a new song.\"  In the course of time the English learned to esteem all arts more highly, and in no country was a great musician more sure of a warm welcome.  Two celebrated violinists were born in the year 1630, Thomas Baltzar, and John Banister, the former in Germany, at Lubec, and the latter in London.  Baltzar was esteemed the finest performer of his time, and is said to have been the first to have introduced the practice of \"shifting.\" In 1656 Baltzar went to England, where he quite eclipsed Davis Mell, a clockmaker, who was considered a fine player, and did much to give the violin an impetus toward popularity. The wonder caused by his performances in England, shortly after his arrival, is best described in the quaint language of Anthony Wood, who \"did, to his very great astonishment, hear him play on the violin. He then saw him run "]]]
