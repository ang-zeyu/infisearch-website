Do you know, the only connotation—(are you familiar with that word?)—the only suggestion it has for me is a _jury_?”  He scored distinctly. Geoffrey had nothing to say in reply.  It was McVay himself, who, disliking a pause, observed that it was almost time to begin on the preparation of the Christmas dinner. They all rose as if glad of a break. As they passed out of the door, Geoffrey laid his hand on McVay’s arm.  “Why do you deliberately try to exasperate me?” he said.  McVay smiled. “Why do little boys lay their tongues to lamp-posts in freezing weather? Don’t I amuse you? Be candid.”  “No.”  McVay looked regretful. “As I remembered you, Holland, as a boy, you had more sense of humour,” he said gently.     VI   In the kitchen McVay made it evident that his talents were for organisation rather than for hard labour. He drew a chair near the wall, and tilting back at his ease, watched Geoffrey and Cecilia at work. Geoffrey, engaged in lighting the range-fire, looked up at her as she moved about filling the kettle and washing out pots and pans, and thought that he and she presented the aspect of a young couple of the labouring class with no further ambition than to keep a roof over their heads. He almost had it in his heart to wish that they were.  She proved herself infinitely more capable than the two men had been, discovering tins of butter and soup and sardines, a package of hominy, apples and potatoes in the cellar, and an old box of wedding cake, which, with a burning brandy sauce, she declared would serve very well for plum-pudding.  Manual labour was such a novelty to Geoffrey that he soon forgot even his irritation against McVay and the triangular intercourse was more friendly than before, until marred by an unfortunate incident.  He was standing in the middle of the kitchen with a steaming pot in each hand, when McVay, without warning, advanced toward him, handkerchief in hand, exclaiming:  “My dear fellow, such a smut on your forehead, pray allow me—”   [Illustration: “My dear fellow—pray allow me”]   “Look out,” roared Geoffrey, realising how easily in another second his revolver might be taken from him. The tone was alarming, and McVay sprang back ten feet. “I was afraid of burning you with the soup,” Geoffrey explained politely.  “I own you made me jump,” said McVay.  The girl said nothing, and Geoffrey feared the incident had made an unfortunate impression on her.  It appeared to be completely forgotten, however, when they presently sat down to their Christmas dinner, of which they all expressed themselves as inordinately proud. There was canned soup, and sardines and toasted biscuits, canned corned beef, potatoes and fried hominy, bacon and a potato salad, a bottle of champagne, and finally the wedding cake.  Now to say that by the time dessert was put on table McVay was drunk would be to do him a gross injustice. All the more genial side of this nature, however, was distinctly emphasised. The better part of a quart of champagne had not produced any signs of intoxication; his eye was clear, his speech perfect, and he was more than usually aware of his own powers, confident of appreciation.  As he finished his share of cake, he rose to his feet, and leaning the tips of his fingers on the table, addressed Geoffrey.  “My dear Holland,” he said, “I will not wish you a Merry Christmas, for it has already been as merry as it has lain within my poor capacity to make it. Let me, however, express my own gratitude to you for this delightful occasion. You have referred to the fare as meagre, to our position as constrained, but believe me, I am not exaggerating when I say that I so little agree with you that I am confident that, during many of the remaining years of my life I shall look back to this Christmas as one of unusual luxury and freedom. It is, perhaps, the warm glow of friendship that gilds all small discomforts, for in situations like ours characters are tested, and yours, Holland,” he paused impressively, “has stood the test.”  Geoffrey bowed gratefully, and McVay continued:  “I have here a slight token in honour of the day. It is of little pecuniary value, but between us, Holland, pecuniary value is no longer mentioned. I feel that it will be recommended to you more than mere worth could recommend it by the fact that it is peculiarly my own,—my own as few human possessions can be said to be. I offer it,” he said, drawing from his pocket a square flat little package, “with best wishes for a happy New Year.”   [Illustration: “I Have Here A Slight Token, In Honor Of The Day”]   The idea that McVay was going to give him a present had never crossed Geoffrey’s mind, and now it struck him as so characteristic, so perfectly in keeping with McVay’s consuming desire to triumph in minor matters, that he was able to smile pleasantly and receive it appropriately. He exchanged a glance of real appreciation with the donor, and received a grave bow in return.  Cecilia smiled, too, “I don’t know exactly why you should think Mr. Holland wants your picture, Billy,” she said.  “It may be of the greatest service to him,” said McVay.  The girl turned to Geoffrey. “I can’t make a speech like Billy’s,” she said, “but I have a small present for you which I hope you won’t despise because it is not new. I mean I have worn it myself for some time, and I hope _you_ will now, in remembrance of the time when you sheltered the houseless.” She held out on her pink palm a flat gold pencil with a single topaz set in the top.  The thing was of some value and Geoffrey, looking up, caught McVay’s eye in which danced such a delicious merriment that Geoffrey’s half-formed question was answered. McVay was undergoing such paroxysms of delight at the idea that Geoffrey was about to become a receiver of stolen goods that he could not well conceal it. And instinctively Geoffrey drew back his hand. The next moment he realised that he must at once accept the gift with decent gratitude, whatever he might choose to do with it afterward, but unfortunately the girl had noticed his hesitation.  She said nothing whatsoever, but she closed her hand on the pencil, rose from the table, and left them to dispose of the remains of the feast as best they could.  McVay, as if he had observed nothing, threw himself at once into the part of a waiter, tucked a napkin round his waist, flung another over his arm and began to clear the table.  “Wait a moment,” said Geoffrey, who had not followed his example; “I have something to say to you. I see you are in possession of my sentiments in regard to your sister.... I think her a wonder,—that’s all it is necessary for you to know.”  “Quite naturally, Holland. She is, she is.”  “I won’t discuss that with you. The point is that you seem to be under the impression that this will do you some good. Well, it won’t. You stand just where you did before. You go to jail when the snow melts. Then I settle my affairs.”  McVay’s face fell. “Really, Holland,” he said, “I don’t see how, if you are fond of a woman you can want ...”  “... to spare her such a brother as you. Think it over.”  “There are worse brothers than I,” replied McVay, “how many men would have sacrificed what I have sacrificed in order to keep her comfortably.”  “Not many, I hope.”  “She is extraordinarily fond of me.”  “Perhaps. You see she has not any one else to be fond of.”  “We can scarcely say that _now_,” returned McVay encouragingly.  “I won’t discuss it with you.”  “You can’t mean to tell me that you are in love with my sister and mean to send me to state’s prison?”  “I mean exactly that.”  “Why, she’d never forgive you.”  Geoffrey thought this so probable that he had no answer to give and presently McVay, who had been grumbling over the matter to himself, asked: “Are you serious, Holland?”  “What do you suppose I am?” Geoffrey roared, and McVay, shaking his head went on with the work of clearing the table. He was very silent and abstracted and for the first time seemed to realise his position. When they had put away the last plate, Geoffrey said:  “Now come to the library. I am going to give you a pipe, confound you.”  “A pipe! Why?”  “Because I want to give your sister something, and I think she would be more apt to take it.”  “I’m afraid she is rather offended by the way you treated her little gift. As a matter of fact I was the person to be offended, for I had given her the pencil. A pretty little thing, singularly like one which you may have seen Mrs.—”  “Don’t tell me where you took it from. I don’t want to know. Come and get your pipe and mind you are grateful.”  “A pipe,” observed McVay thoughtfully. “I think I’ll take that large meerschaum on the mantelpiece.”  Geoffrey laughed. “I think you won’t,” he answered. “The best pipe I own! No, indeed, you’ll take a horrid little one that won’t draw. It will be just the thing for you.”  “No,” said McVay, “no. You must give me the big one. Otherwise I shall make it appear that you promised the other to me, and turned mean at the last moment. And I can do it, Holland.” His little eyes gleamed at the thought. “I shall say, ‘My dear fellow, I’m glad you changed your mind about the meerschaum; it was as you say, too handsome for a man in my position.’ That will make her mad if anything will. You know she is not quite satisfied with the way you treat me, as it is.”  This was quite true, and Geoffrey, remembering that the object of the gift was to please the girl, reluctantly agreed to part with his favourite pipe. The affair went off well. McVay affected to hesitate over accepting so handsome an offering, and Geoffrey pressed it upon him with a good grace.  As far as his present to the girl was concerned, he found himself less and less willing to make it in McVay’s presence, and more and more unable to think of any way of getting rid of him except murder or the cedar-closet. His anxiety was rendered more acute by the fact that once or twice he could not help "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14837"],["title","The Tale of Tom Kitten (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]     THE TALE OF TOM KITTEN  BY BEATRIX POTTER  _Author of_ _\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\", &c._  [Illustration]  FREDERICK WARNE  First published 1907     1907 by Frederick Warne & Co.     Printed and bound in Great Britain by William Clowes Limited, Beccles and London     DEDICATED TO ALL PICKLES, --ESPECIALLY TO THOSE THAT GET UPON MY GARDEN WALL     [Illustration]  Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.  They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.  But one day their mother--Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).  Then she brushed their fur, (this one is Mittens).  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).  Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.  Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. His mother sewed them on again.  When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.  \"Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.  When they stood up there were several green smears!  \"Let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall,\" said Moppet.  They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.  He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.  Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three Puddle-Ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  They stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.  Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.  \"Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck,\" said Moppet--\"Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.  But he put them on _himself!_ They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.  \"It's a very fine morning!\" said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.  \"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,\" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.  She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: _not_ in the least.  Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.  And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!  [Illustration]  As for the Puddle-Ducks--they went into a pond.  The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since."]]]
