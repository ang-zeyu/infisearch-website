Captain indicates point on which corporal of base squad is to march.  COMPANY RIGHT is executed as explained for front rank of Company, but at 1/2 pace intervals.   DEPLOYMENTS.  _From Line, to Form Skirmish Line to Front._  As SKIRMISHERS, GUIDE RIGHT, MARCH.--1. If marching, corporal commands, Follow Me. Corporal of base squad moves straight to front, deploys as soon as possible and advances until Company, Halt, is given.    Other squads move to left front and place squads on the line.    If guide is center, other corporals on right of center squad move to the right, and squads on the left to the left, and bring their squads on the line.    If guide is left, other corporals move to right front.  2. If at halt, base squad deploys abreast of its corporal, 3 paces in front of the former line, as soon as it has room.    Other squads are conducted by the left flank, to their places.  TO DEPLOY FROM COLUMN OF SQUADS, FORMING SKIRMISH LINE TO THE FRONT.--If at a halt, base squad deploys abreast of its corporal 3 paces in front of its former position.    If marching, base squad deploys and moves straight to the front.    If guide is right, other corporals move to left front and place squads on line.    If guide is center, corporals in front move to right (if at a halt, to right rear), the corporals in rear of center squad move to left and come on line in succession.    Column of twos or files are deployed by same commands in same manner.    If deployment in an oblique direction is desired, the captain points out desired direction.    Column of squads may be turned to the flank or rear and then deployed.  ASSEMBLE, MARCH.--In skirmish line, men assemble at a run, to their places individually. Squads do not assemble and march to places as units as do platoons.  PLATOONS, ASSEMBLE.--Men assemble individually on the run, in their platoons and are then marched to relative position on base platoon as indicated by position or command of captain.  PLATOON COLUMNS.--Platoon leaders should be sure to go through center of platoon.    Platoon guides in rear.    Columns should be 20 yards apart, or more.    (Used to take advantage of few favorable routes where cover is poor or ground difficult.)  SQUAD COLUMNS.--Men oblique and follow squad leader. No advantage in cover, but used to advance more quickly over rough or brush grown ground.    (It might be desirable to teach men to take squad columns from column of squads.)   In assembling from Platoon or Squad columns, the men reform by platoons or squads and are conducted by their leaders to point indicated by captain.    _Thin lines_ are used to cross wide stretches under artillery fire or heavy, long range rifle fire which cannot be profitably returned.  No. 1's FORWARD, MARCH.    First line is led by platoon leader, right platoon.    Second line is led by platoon guide, right platoon.    Third line is led by platoon leader, next platoon, etc.    Quick time, unless conditions otherwise demand.  CAPTAIN POINTS OUT NEW LINE.--Original intervals preserved.  DISADVANTAGE.--Serious loss of control over company.  ADVANTAGE.--Offers less definite target and is less likely to draw fire.   BEING IN SKIRMISH LINE.  BY PLATOON (2 PLATOONS, SQUADS, 4 MEN, ETC.), FROM THE RIGHT, RUSH.--Leader of rush usually platoon leader.     (1) Selects new line.    (2) Cease firing.    (3) Prepare to rush.    (4) Follow me.    (5) Commence firing.  When whole company rushes, it is led by Captain. Platoon leader lead their platoons.   COMMANDS.  Commands should be so given as to be distinctly heard by all the men who have to execute them. It is unfair to expect good execution of a slovenly command or one that cannot be heard. A sufficient interval should be allowed between the preparatory command and the command of execution, proportioned to the size of the command, so that each man has time to grasp the movement before execution is required.   School of the Battalion.  BASIS.--4 companies to a battalion.  ARRANGEMENT.--Right to left by rank of Captains. After formation order is not kept with reference to rank of Captains.  NUMBER.--From right to left in whatever direction.  CENTER.--Actual center or right center company.  BAND.--Places itself as if it were an adjoining battalion on right.  DRESSING.--Each company is dressed by its Captain who places himself on the flank toward which the dress is to be made.  In battalion line beside the guide (or beside flank file of the front rank if guide is not in line) facing front.  In column of companies--2 paces from the guide and facing down the line.   To Form the Battalion.  OTHER THAN CEREMONIES.--Column of squads. Adjutant does not take his post until companies are formed. Each Captain halts company and salutes Adjutant. Adjutant returns salutes and when last Captain has saluted, faces Major and reports \"Sir, the Battalion is formed.\" He joins Major without command.  FOR CEREMONIES.--Or when directed, Battalion is formed in line. Adjutant places himself 6 paces to right of right company and facing in direction line is to extend. Guides precede companies on line by 20 paces. Adjutant causes guides to cover. Companies are halted one pace in rear of line and dressed to right against arm of guide. When guides of left company have been posted, Adjutant by shortest route moves to post facing Battalion midway between post of Major and center of Battalion. Adjutant commands: 1. Guides, 2. Posts, 3. Present, 4. Arms. He then faces about and reports, \"Sir, the Battalion is formed.\" Major commands, \"Take your post, sir.\"  TO DISMISS THE BATTALION.--Dismiss your companies.  TO RECTIFY THE ALIGNMENT.--See Infantry Drill Regulations, paragraphs 273-274.  TO RECTIFY THE COLUMN.--See Infantry Drill Regulations, paragraph 275.  HELPFUL HINTS TO BEGINNERS.--These hold good with few exceptions.    When in column of squads; first command of Captain begins with word \"Column.\"    When in column of companies; first command of Captain begins with word \"Squads.\"  IN COLUMN OF SQUADS.--  Major: _On right (left) into line._  First Captain: Squads right. (Captain marches beside right guide.)  Rear Captains: Continue to march (If halted, forward).  Major: _March_.  Rear Captains: (Upon uncovering preceding company) Squads right.  Major: _Battalion_.  First Captain: Company.  Major: _Halt_.  First Captain: Right Dress, Front.  Rear Captains: (Coming on line). Company Halt, Right Dress, Front.  Major: _Right (left) front into line._  First Captain: Column right.  Rear Captains: Column half right.  Major: _March_.  First Captain: (Halts and allows company to pass him and form column of squads to right.) Squads left, Company Halt, Left Dress, Front.  Rear Captains: When company in column of squads arrives one pace in rear of the right flank of the company that has formed in line. Column half right, March. The Captain then takes 5 paces beyond the flank of the last company in line, allows company to pass him, and as rear guide reaches him, commands: Squads left, March, Company Halt, Left Dress, Front.  Major: _Line of companies at_ (seven) paces, guide left (right). (Close on first company from column of squads is no longer used in Battalion drill.)  First Captain: Continue to march (if halted, forward).  Rear Captains: Column half right.  Major: _March_.  Rear Captains: (When company reaches a position 7 paces to the flank of the leading company.) Column half right.  Major: _Battalion_.  All Captains: Company.  Major: _Halt_.  Major: _Column of companies, first company_ squads right (left).  First Captain: Squads right.  Rear Captains: Continue to march (if halted, forward.).  As each company reaches the point where the first company formed line the Captain commands: Squads right, March.  IN COLUMN OF COMPANIES OR CLOSE COLUMN OF COMPANIES.--  Major: _On right (left) into line._  First Captain: Right turn.  Rear Captains: Continue to march (if halted, forward).  Major: _March_.  Rear Captains: Each Captain takes 5 paces beyond the left flank of the company that has just executed the turn and commands: Right turn, March.  Major: _Battalion_.  First Captain: Company.  Major: _Halt_.  First Captain: Right Dress, Front.  Rear Captains: (As they come on line.) Company Halt, Right Dress, Front.  Major: _Right (left) front into line._  First Captain: Company.  Second Capt: Right by Squads.  Third and fourth Captains: Squads Right.  Major: _March_.  First Captain: Halt, Left Dress, Front.  Rear Captains: Column half left, March, Column half right March. Taking 5 paces from the flank of the company last on line and allowing the company to pass by him until the rear guide reaches him, Captain commands: Squads left, March, Company Halt, Left Dress, Front.  Major: _Close on first company_ (Never any other).  First Captain: Company.  Rear Captains: Continue to march (if halted, forward).  Major: _March_.  First Captain: Halt.  Rear Captains: As each successive company closes to 8 paces from the company immediately in front, the Captain commands: Company Halt.  Major: _Extend on fourth company._ (Never any other.)  First Captain: Continue to march (if halted, forward).  Rear Captains: Company.  Major: _March_.  Rear Captains: Halt. Then as each company in rear of the leading company gets the proper distance (company front plus 5 paces) the Captain commands: Forward March.  Close column not extended in double time.  Major: _Column of squads, first company_ squads right (left).  First Captain: Squads right.  Rear Captains: Continue to march (if halted, forward). As each company reaches the point where the first company formed column of squads, the Captain commands: Squads right, March.  Major: _Column right (left)._  First Captain: Right turn.  Rear Captains: Continue to March (if halted, forward).  Major: _March_.  First Captain: When the marching flank of the company is one pace from the new line the Captain commands:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14626"],["title","The Boy Allies with the Victorious Fleets; Or, The Fall of the German Navy (#0)"],["body","Team       The Boy Allies With the Victorious Fleets  OR The Fall of the German Navy  By ENSIGN ROBERT L.

PLYMOUTH   \"Sail at 4 a.m.,\" said Captain Jack Templeton of the U.S.S. Plymouth, laying down the long manila envelope marked \"Secret.\" \"Acknowledge by signal,\" he directed the ship's messenger, and then looked inquiringly about the wardroom table.  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the first officer, Lieutenant Frank Chadwick.  \"Ready at four, sir,\" said the engineer officer, Thomas; and left his dinner for a short trip to the engine room to push some belated repairs.  \"Send a patrol ashore to round up the liberty party,\" continued Captain Templeton, this time addressing the junior watch officer. \"Tell them to be aboard at midnight instead of eight in the morning.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the junior watch officer, and departed in haste.  There was none of the bustle and confusion aboard the U.S.S. Plymouth, at that moment lying idle in a British port, that the landsman would commonly associate with sailing orders to a great destroyer. Blowers began to hum in the fire rooms. The torpedo gunner's mates slipped detonators in the warheads and looked to the rack load of depth charges. The steward made a last trip across to the depot ship. Otherwise, things ran on very much as before.  At midnight the junior watch officer called the captain, who had turned in several hours earlier, and reported:  \"Liberty party all on board, sir.\"  Then he turned in for a few hours' rest himself.  The junior watch was astir again at three o'clock. He routed out a sleepy crew to hoist boats and secure for sea. Seven bells struck on the Plymouth.  Captain Templeton appeared on the bridge. Lieutenant Chadwick was at his side, as were Lieutenants Shinnick and Craib, second and third officers respectively. Captain Templeton gave a command. The cable was slipped from the mooring buoy. Ports were darkened and the Plymouth slipped out. A bit inside the protection of the submarine nets, but just outside the channel, she lay to, breasting the flood tide. There she lay for almost an hour.  \"Coffee for the men,\" said Captain Templeton.  The morning coffee was served on deck in the darkness.  Lights appeared in the distance, and presently another destroyer joined the Plymouth. Running lights of two more appeared as the clock struck 4 a.m.  Captain Templeton signalled the engine room for two-thirds speed ahead. Running lights were blanketed on the four destroyers, and the ships fell into column.  Lieutenant Chadwick felt a drop on his face. He held out a hand.  \"Rain,\" he said briefly.  Jack--Captain Templeton--nodded.  \"So much the better, Frank,\" he replied.  The four destroyers cleared the channel light and spread out like a fan into line formation.  \"Full speed ahead!\" came Jack's next command.  The Plymouth leaped ahead, as did her sister ships on either side.  \"We're off,\" said Frank.  Away they sped in the darkness, a division of four Yankee destroyers, tearing through the Irish sea on a rainy morning; Frank knew there were four ships in line, but all he could see was his guide, a black smudge in the darkness, a few ship lengths away on his port bow. Directly she was blotted from sight by a rain squall.  \"Running lights!\" shouted Frank.  The lights flashed. Frank kept an eye forward. Directly he got a return flash from the ship ahead, and then picked up her shape again.  Morning dawned and still the fleet sped on. Toward noon the weather cleared. Officer and men kept their watches by regular turn during the day. At sundown the four destroyers slowed down and circled around in a slow column. The eyes of every officer watched the clock. They were watching for something. Directly it came--a line of other ships, transports filled with wounded soldiers returning to America. These must be safely convoyed to a certain point beyond the submarine zone by the Plymouth and her sister ships.  On came the transports camouflaged like zebras. The Plymouth and the other destroyers fell into line on either side of the transports.  \"Full speed ahead,\" was Captain Templeton's signal to the engine room.  \"Take a look below, Frank,\" said Jack to his first officer.  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  Frank descended a manhole in the deck. He closed the cover and secured it behind him. At the foot of the ladder was a locked door. As it opened, came a pressure on Frank's ear drums like the air-lock of a caisson. Frank threaded his way amid pumps and feed water heaters and descended still further to the furnace level.  Twenty-five knots--twenty-eight land miles an hour--was the speed of the Plymouth at that moment. It was good going.  Below, instead of dust, heat, the clatter of shovels, grimy, sweating fireman, such as the thought of the furnace room of a ship of war calls to the mind of the landsman, a watertender stood calmly watching the glow of oil jets feeding the furnace fire. Now and then he cast an eye to the gauge glasses. The vibration of the hull and the hum of the blower were the only sounds below.  For the motive power of the Plymouth was not furnished by coal. Rather, it was oil--crude petroleum--that drove the vessel along. And though oil has its advantage over coal, it has its disadvantages as well. It was Frank's first experience aboard an oil-burner, and he had not become used to it yet. He smelled oil in the smoke from the funnels, he breathed it from the oil range in the galley. His clothes gathered it from stanchions and rails.  The water tanks were flavored with the seepage from neighboring compartments. Frank drank petroleum in the water and tasted it in the soup. The butter, he thought, tasted like some queer vaseline. But Frank knew that eventually he would get used to it.  \"How's she heading?\" Frank asked of the chief engineer.  \"All right, sir,\" was the reply. \"Everything perfectly trim. I can get more speed if necessary.\"  Frank smiled.  \"Let's hope it won't be necessary, chief,\" he replied.  He inspected the room closely for some moments, then returned to the bridge and reported to Captain Templeton.  The sea was rough, but nevertheless the speed of the flotilla was not slackened. It was the desire of Captain Petlow, in charge of the destroyer fleet, to convoy the transports beyond the danger point at the earliest possible moment.  The Plymouth lurched up on top of a crest, then dived head-first into the trough. On the bridge the heave and pitch of the vessel was felt subconsciously, but the eyes and minds of the officers were busied with other things. At every touch of the helm the vessel vibrated heavily.  Eight bells struck.  \"Twelve o'clock,\" said Frank. \"Time to eat.\"  The bridge was turned over to the second officer, and Frank and Jack went below.  \"Eat is right, Frank,\" said Jack as they sat down. \"We can't dine in this weather.\"  It was true. The rolling boards, well enough for easy weather, proved a mockery in a sea like the one that raged now. Butter balls, meat and vegetables shot from plates and went sailing about. It was necessary to drink soup from teacups and such solid foods as Jack and Frank put into their stomachs was only what they succeeded in grabbing as they leaped about on the table.  The two returned on deck.  The day passed quietly. No submarines were sighted, and at last the flotilla reached the point where the destroyers were to leave the homeward bound transports to pursue their voyage alone. The transports soon grew indistinguishable, almost, in the semi-darkness. The senior naval officer aboard the Plymouth hoisted signal flags.  \"Bon Voyage,\" they read.  Through a glass Jack read the reply.  \"Thank you for your good work. Best of luck.\"  From the S.N.O. (senior naval officer) came another message. Frank picked it up.  \"Set course 188 degrees. Keep lookout for inbound transports to be convoyed. Ten ships.\"  Again the destroyer swung into line. It was almost seven o'clock--after dark--when the lookout aboard the Plymouth reported:  \"Smoke ahead!\"  Instantly all was activity aboard the destroyers. Directly, through his glass, Jack sighted nine rusty, English tramp steamers, of perhaps eight thousand tons, and a big liner auxiliary flying the Royal Navy ensign.  Under the protection of the destroyers, the ships made for an English port. The night passed quietly. With the coming of morning, the flotilla was divided. The Plymouth stood by to protect the big liner, while the other three destroyers and the tramp steamers moved away toward the east.  \"This destroyer game is no better than driving a taxi,\" Frank protested to Jack on the bridge that afternoon. You never see anything. I'd like to get ashore for a change. I've"]]]
