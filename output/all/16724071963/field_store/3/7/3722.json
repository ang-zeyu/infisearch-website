Up The Chimney  BY  SHEPHERD KNAPP  [Illustration]     Preface   This play is intended, not only for acting, but also for reading. It is so arranged that boys and girls can read it to themselves, just as they would read any other story. Even the stage directions and the descriptions of scenery are presented as a part of the narrative. At the same time, by the use of different styles of type, the speeches of the characters are clearly distinguished from the rest of the text, an arrangement which will be found convenient when parts are being memorized for acting.  The play has been acted more than once, and by different groups of people; sometimes on a stage equipped with footlights, curtain, and scenery; sometimes with barely any of these aids. Practical suggestions as to costumes, scenery, and some simple scenic effects will be found at the end of the play.  What sort of a Christmas play do the boys and girls like, and in what sort do we like to see them take part? It should be a play, surely, in which the dialogue is simple and natural, not stilted and artificial; one that seems like a bit of real life, and yet has plenty of fancy and imagination in it; one that suggests and helps to perpetuate some of the happy and wholesome customs of Christmas; above all, one that is pervaded by the Christmas spirit. I hope that this play does not entirely fail to meet these requirements.  Worcester, Mass.  SHEPHERD KNAPP.     The Introduction   _Before the curtain opens_, MOTHER GOOSE _comes out, and this is what she says_:  Good evening, dear children. I see you are all expecting me to show you a Christmas Play. Well, I have one ready, sure enough. And now let me see, what shall I tell you about it? For one thing it will take place on Christmas Eve, and then it will be all about Christmas, of course. The first scene will be in the house, where a little girl and a little boy live, with their father, who is a doctor, and their mother. It is evening and the weather is very cold outside. The little girl and boy are writing letters--can you guess to whom they are writing?--and the mother is knitting, and the father is reading his newspaper; as you will see in a moment for yourselves. So be very quiet, for now it is going to begin.     Up The Chimney   The First Scene   _The curtain opens, and you see a room in a house and four people, just as Mother Goose promised. On one side is a fire-place, and notice the stockings hanging by it. At the back is a window, looking out into the street, but you cannot see anything there, because it is dark out of doors. The little girl's name is Polly, but the first one to speak is her brother, named_ JACK, _who looks up from his letter and says_:  Mother, how do you spell \"friend\"?  MOTHER _answers_: F, r, i, e, n, d. Have you nearly finished your letter, Jack?  Yes, _says_ JACK, _still writing. Then he stops, straightens up and says_, There! It's all done. Shall I read it to you, Mother?  Do, MOTHER _answers. And Father puts down his newspaper to listen, and Polly stops writing. Mother goes on knitting, because she can knit and listen at the same time_.  _So_ JACK _reads_: \"Dear Santa Claus, I have been very good this year--most of the time; and I wish you would bring me a toy soldier. I am very well and I hope you are. Your loving little friend, Jack.\" Is that all right, Mother?  It is a very good letter, _says_ MOTHER; only I thought you were going to speak about that pair of warm gloves for Father.  Oh, I forget that, _says_ JACK, _looking a little bit ashamed_. I'll put it in a postscript. _So he goes on writing, and so does Polly_. JACK _says his words aloud while he writes them_: \"P.S.--Fa--ather--would--like--a--pair--of--warm--gloves.\"  MOTHER _looks over at Polly, who seems to have finished, and says_: Polly, let us hear your letter.  _So_ POLLY _reads_: \"Dear Santa Claus, I am so glad that tomorrow is Christmas. We have all hung up our stockings, and I think I would like best to have a doll in short dresses. I love you very much. Your little friend, Polly. P.S.--I think Mother would like a ball of white knitting cotton.\" I had to put that in a postscript, Mother, because I forgot, too.  _And now_ FATHER, _who has been listening all this time, says_: Where will you put the letters?--on the mantel-piece or in the stockings?  Oh, on the mantel-piece, _answers_ JACK. We always put them on the mantel-piece. Don't you remember that, Father?  Yes, I believe I do, now that you speak of it, _says_ FATHER.  _Then the children put the two letters on the mantel-piece, standing them against the clock, so that they can be easily seen. While they are doing this, some one passes the window, walking along the street, and there comes a knock at the door_.  Come in, _says_ FATHER; _and in comes a little woman, rather old, and rather bent, and rather lame_.  Why, if it isn't little Nurse Mary, _cries_ FATHER, _and they all rise up to greet her. She kisses both the children, and shakes hands with Father and Mother._  Here's a chair for you, Nurse Mary, _says_ JACK.  Let me take your cloak and hood, Nurse Mary, _says_ POLLY.  _When they were all seated again_, FATHER _says_, I am afraid I shall have to give you a little scolding, Mary, for coming out on such a cold night. It really don't do, you know.  Now, Doctor John, NURSE MARY _answers_, What do you expect? Haven't I seen you every Christmas Eve since you were half the size of Master Jack here, and didn't I knit with my own hands the first little stocking you ever hung up for Santa Claus, and don't I remember how frightened you were that time when we heard the reindeers on the roof, and when the handful of walnuts came tumbling down the chimney? And do you expect me to stay away on Christmas Eve, like some lonely old woman, who never was nurse to any children at all, let alone two generations of them? What are you thinking of, Doctor John?  I am thinking, _says_ FATHER _smiling_, that if you hadn't come, we should have missed you dreadfully. But tell me, Nurse Mary, how are you feeling?  Well, _answers_ NURSE MARY, to speak the truth, Doctor John, I think you must give me some medicine.  Medicine? _cries_ MOTHER.  Are you sick, Nurse Mary? _asks_ POLLY.  Yes, Miss Polly, sick, and very sick, too, NURSE MARY _answers_.  But how? _asks_ FATHER. What's wrong? Where is the trouble?  First of all, in my back, Doctor John, _says_ NURSE MARY. Today, after sweeping and scrubbing a little, and baking a Christmas cake, I just ironed out a few pieces, my best cap and apron, and the likes of that, and before I had finished, I give you word my back began to ache. Now what do you make of it? And then, my joints--stiff! Yes, Dr. John, stiff! How am I to do my work with stiff joints, I'd like to know?  I see, _says_ FATHER, _shaking his head._ This is a serious matter. But cheer up, Nurse Mary; I believe I have the very thing that will help you. _He opens his medicine case, which stands on the table, and takes out a little bottle._ Here it is, _he says_, and let me tell you how to take it; for with this medicine that is the most important part. You must find some children to give it to you. If you take it from grown-up people, it will do you no good at all, so you must find a child somewhere, or two would be better, one to pour it out and one to hold the spoon--  Oh, let me pour it out, _cries_ JACK.  And let me hold the spoon, _cries_ POLLY.  Why, that will do finely, _says_ FATHER, _and hands Jack the bottle._ And now I must go out, _he continues_; for old Mrs. Cavendish is sick and has sent for me. It may be quite late, when I come home. _He begins to put on his overcoat._  And I, _says_ MOTHER, have some Christmas bundles to tie up. If Nurse Mary goes before I come back, will you both go quietly to bed like good children?  Yes, Mother, _cry_ POLLY _and_ JACK _together._  Well, good night, then, Mary dear, _says_ MOTHER.  Good night, Nurse Mary, _says_ FATHER. _Then Mother and Father both go out, the one to her own room and the other to the street._  Come, Nurse Mary, _says_ JACK, you must take your medicine.  Do you suppose it is very bitter? _asks_ NURSE MARY.  I think it is, _says_ JACK, _looking into the bottle and smelling it_. It looks bitter and it smells bitter.  But you mustn't mind that, Nurse Mary, _says_ POLLY; because it will make you well.  All right, _says_ NURSE MARY. Pour it out.  _Then Polly holds the spoon, and Jack carefully pours the medicine into it. Nurse Mary opens her mouth, swallows the dose, and makes a wry face, shuddering._  Was it horrid? _asks_ JACK.  Horrid! _answers_ NURSE MARY.  Do you feel better? _asks_ POLLY.  I can't tell yet, _answers_ NURSE MARY. I suppose I must wait a little for the medicine to work.  And while we are waiting, _says_ JACK, tell us about when Father was a little boy.  _So Nurse Mary sits down, and takes Polly on her lap, while Jack sits on a stool at her feet, and then_ NURSE MARY _begins_, When Dr. John was a very little boy--  But, Nurse Mary, JACK _says, interrupting_, he wasn't named \"Dr. John\" then, was he?  No, _answers_ NURSE MARY, he was just \"Master John\" then. Well, when he was a very little boy, so that I could carry him upstairs to bed without any trouble at all, he was the most beautiful boy you ever saw. He had fat rosy cheeks, and fine big eyes, and stout little legs.  Was he big enough to walk, when you first took care of him? _asks_ POLLY.  No, indeed, _answers_ NURSE MARY; and the first time he ever went to a Christmas tree, I had to carry him. I held him up to see the candles.  Did he like it? _asks_ JACK.  I think that he was just a wee bit frightened, _says_ NURSE MARY, but I'll tell you what he did like. You know the little figures of Mary and Joseph and the Christ Child in the manger, that you always set out on Christmas Day, with the cows and the sheep standing all about? _The children both nod_. Well, when your father saw that, and heard your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14786"],["title","Up the Chimney (#1)"],["body","and all the older brothers and sisters singing \"The Carol of the Friendly Beasts\"--just as you will sing it again tomorrow--he held out his hands and danced up and down in my arms. I tell you, I could hardly hold him.  Nurse Mary, _says_ POLLY, won't you sing us \"The Carol of the Friendly Beasts\" now?  In my old cracked voice? _says_ NURSE MARY. Well, if you will both help me, I'll try.  _So the three of them together sing_:   THE CAROL OF THE FRIENDLY BEASTS[1]    Jesus our brother, strong and good,   Was humbly born in a stable rude,   And the friendly beasts around him stood.    I, said the cow, all white and red,   I gave him my manger for his bed,   I gave him my hay to pillow his head.    I, said the camel, yellow and black,   Over the desert, upon my back,   I brought him a gift in the wise man's pack.    I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown,   I carried his mother uphill and down,   I carried her safely to Bethlehem town.    I, said the sheep, with the curly horn,   I gave him my wool for his blanket warm,   He wore my coat on Christmas morn.    I, said the dove, from my rafter high,   Cooed him to sleep that he should not cry,   We cooed him to sleep my mate and I.    And every beast, by some good spell   In the stable dark, was glad to tell   Of the gift he gave Immanuel.   [Footnote 1: By Robert Davis.]   _When the carol is finished_, NURSE MARY _looks at the clock, and says_, My dears, it is time we were all in bed, or Santa Claus when he comes, will find us awake, and that would never do. So I must be going home.  But how do you feel? _asks_ POLLY. Has the medicine done your back good?  My back? _says_ NURSE MARY. Why, I had forgotten all about my back--not an ache in it.  And your joints? _asks_ JACK.  I wouldn't know I had any joints, _answers_ NURSE MARY. I declare, I believe I could dance the Highland Fling. But where is my cloak?  _Then Polly gets the cloak and hood, and helps her put them on, and as Nurse Mary goes out at the door_,  Good-night, Nurse Mary, _cry_ JACK _and_ POLLY.  Good-night, my dears, NURSE MARY _answers. And the door closes behind her_.  _Now while the children had their backs turned, a funny thing happened, for out of the fire-place there stepped, without making a sound, a little man dressed all in green. Jack and Polly, when they turn about, see him standing there._  Why, who are you? _asks_ JACK, _standing still, but very bravely keeping in front of Polly._  _The little green man says never a word, but after waiting a moment with his finger on his lips, he beckons to them to come forward, and slowly, for they are a little frightened, they obey him. When they are quite close, he looks cautiously around, and then draws a large white letter out of his pocket, and hands it to Jack. Jack looks at it, and shows it to Polly. Then he looks at the little green man, who nods his head with a funny little jerk._  Shall I open it? _asks_ JACK. _And the little green man nods again. So Jack opens it._  Shall I read it? _asks_ JACK. _And the little green man nods again. So Jacks begins to read:_ \"My dear Children all over the world, I, who write you this letter, am your old friend Santa Claus, and how shall I tell you the sad news, for tonight is the night when I ought to get into my reindeer sleigh and go about filling your precious stockings with Christmas gifts, and I cannot do it because I am sick. My back aches like a tooth ache, and every joint in my whole body is so stiff that I can hardly move. Old Father Time, who pretends to be something of a doctor, says the trouble is that I am growing old--the idea of it! I sent him packing about his business, I can tell you. But all the same I do feel mighty queer, and that's a fact. And the worst of it is that this is Christmas Eve, and here I am shut up indoors in my house at the North Pole, and every stocking in the world is hanging empty. I cannot bear to have Christmas come and go without any word at all from me, so I have gotten my good little friends the gnomes and fairies and elves to help me out. They had some old fairy toys, that are almost as good as new, and these they are going to carry about to all the children; and although these gifts are rather different from what you usually receive from me, I hope they will at least keep you from forgetting poor old Santa Claus.\"  _Jack and Polly look sadly at one another, and then at the little green man. He reaches out his hand, takes the letter, folds it up, replaces it in the envelope, and tucks it away in his pocket. Then he brings out two little packages, all in green paper, tied with green string, and gives one to Polly and one to Jack. Then, quick as a flash, he has disappeared in the fire-place._  Where did he go to? _asks_ POLLY, _after a moment of surprise._  Up the chimney, _says_ JACK.  But what has he given to us? _says_ POLLY, _looking at the little green package in her hand._  Let's open them, _says_ JACK.  _So the two children untie the strings, and open the papers, and soon hold up the things they have found inside. Jack has a pair of spectacles with large round glasses and black rims. Polly has a curious little brown cap. They look at them in perplexity._  Oh, there is some writing fastened to mine, _says_ POLLY.  And to mine, too, _adds_ JACK.  POLLY _reads:_    \"A fairy wishing-cap am I;   So put me on, and away you fly.   Wherever you wish, 'tis there you'll be,   And quicker than saying three-times-three.\"   _Polly puts the cap on her head. Then_ JACK _reads_:    \"Fairy spectacles are we;   Put us on, and you shall see   Things you never saw before,   Easy as saying four-times-four.\"   _Jack puts the spectacles on his nose, and begins to go about the room looking at everything through them_.  Oh, Polly, _he exclaims_, I can see all sorts of queer things. I can see what is in the table drawer without opening it, and I can see the pictures in the books right through the covers. And oh, Polly, look here. _He is looking into the fire-place, when he says this_. I can see now how the little green man went up the chimney, for there are steps in the side, all the way up. Look at them.  POLLY _looks. Then she says_, I don't see any steps, Jack.  It's the fairy spectacles, Polly, _cries_ JACK. Isn't it wonderful?  Jack! _says_ POLLY _suddenly_, do you know what we must do? We must go to Santa Claus, and carry him the medicine that cured Nurse Mary's back and joints. You will go first up the chimney, and I will go after, stepping just where I see you step, and then at the top I will take tight hold of your hand, and with my wishing cap on I will wish to be at Santa Claus' house at the North Pole.  Splendid! Let's start this minute, _cries_ JACK.  _Polly takes the spoon, and Jack takes the medicine bottle, and one after the other they go up the chimney._  _A moment later_ MOTHER _comes in._ Children, _she begins, looking about; but then she continues_, Oh, I see: they have gone to bed. _She goes across to the other door and listens. Then she says_: Not a sound! They are fast asleep already.  _So she takes the lamp from the table, and carries it out with her, leaving the room all in black darkness._  _And that is the end of the First Scene._         *       *       *       *       *     Interlude   _While the curtain is closed_, MOTHER GOOSE _comes out, and this is what she says:_  Children, did you see Jack and Polly go up that chimney? Well, as soon as they got to the top, Polly took fast hold of Jack's hand and wished to be at the North Pole, and away they went flying through the air. They have gotten there already, I think. Hark! Yes, they are just going in at the gate that leads up to Santa Claus's house, and soon they will be knocking at his door. Then you will see them come in, for you will be there before they are; and when the curtain opens, as it will in just a moment, you will see the inside of the house where Santa Claus lives. You must be very quiet for Santa Claus is sick, remember, and a noise might make his head ache. Hush! It is going to begin.         *       *       *       *       *     The Second Scene   _When the Curtain opens, you again see a room, but quite different from the first one. There is a door on one side, and at the back is a sort of tall box with closed doors in the front of it, a kind of cupboard. On shelves at the sides of the room are some toys and packages, and a bag, nearly full, leans against the wall. There are two people in the room. One of them, of course, is Santa Claus, but oh, how sick he looks. The other person is a woman, you will see, and she must be Mrs. Santa Claus. There are two other figures that look a good deal like people, but they are only big toys that Santa Claus and his wife have been making, a soldier on one side, and a doll on the other._  SANTA CLAUS, _who is sitting, wrapped up in a great blanket wrapper, and is leaning his head on his hand, while he holds a cane in the other is saying_, What is the use of working any longer, for if I can't carry the presents to the children, what is the good of finishing them?  But you might feel better at the last moment, _says_ MRS. SANTA CLAUS, _who is tieing a sash on the big doll that stands beside her._  That's true, _says_ SANTA CLAUS. Well, I believe I'll finish this soldier, then. He's the last one I need to make, and he's all done except to have his cheeks painted. I'll get my paint out and finish him.  _So Santa Claus rises up very stiffly and painfully, and hobbles across the room to get his paint and paintbrush. Then he sits down again in front of the big toy soldier, and paints both its cheeks a fine bright red. Just as he is finishing, there comes a knock at the door._  Come in, _says_ MRS. SANTA CLAUS. _And in walk Jack and Polly, hand in hand, wearing the fairy spectacles and the wishing cap, one holding the bottle and the other the spoon._  Donner and Blitzen! _exclaims_ SANTA CLAUS, _laying down his brush,_ if it isn't Polly and Jack!  Oh, Santa,"]]]
