It was rather annoying to Conrad that any one should have a boat as good as his own, but this was something he could not help. He consoled himself, however, by reflecting that he was a better oarsman than Valentine.  He had been out practicing during the afternoon, accompanied by John Larkin, a neighbor's son. John stood on the bank and timed him.  \"Well, John, how do I row?\" he asked, when he returned from his trial trip.  \"You did very well,\" said John.  \"There won't be any one else that can row against me, eh?\"  \"I don't think of any one. Valentine has as good a boat--\"  \"I don't admit that,\" said Conrad, jealously.  \"I would just as soon have his as yours,\" said John, independently; \"but he can't row with you.\"  \"I should think not.\"  \"Jimmy Morris is a pretty good rower, but he has no boat of his own, and would have to row in one of Serwin's boats. You know what they are.\"  \"He couldn't come up to me, no matter in what boat he rowed,\" said Conrad.  \"Well, perhaps not; I don't know.\"  \"Well, you ought to know, John Larkin.\"  \"My opinion's my own, Conrad,\" said John, manfully.  \"All the same, you are mistaken.\"  \"If Valentine would lend his boat to Jimmy we could tell better.\"  \"He won't do it. He will want it himself,\" said Conrad.  \"As matters stand now, I think you will win the prize.\"  \"I think so myself.\"  It may be thought surprising that nothing was said of Andy Grant and his chances, but, in truth, his boy friends in Arden had never seen him row during the last two years.  As a matter of fact, he had been the champion oarsman of Penhurst Academy, but this they did not know. During his vacations at home he had done very little rowing, his time being taken up in other ways.  \"I wonder whether Andy Grant can row?\" said John Larkin.  Conrad laughed.  \"He can hoe corn and potatoes better than he can row, I fancy,\" he said.  \"He's a first-rate fellow,\" said Larkin, warmly.  \"He's poor and proud, that's what he is. I called at the farm this morning and he insulted me.\"  \"Are you sure it wasn't the other way?\"  \"Look here, John Larkin, if you don't treat me with more respect I won't associate with you.\"  \"Do as you like,\" said John, independently. \"I'd just as soon associate with Valentine or Andy.\"  \"My father can buy out both their fathers.\"  \"That don't make you any the better fellow. Why are you so anxious to win this prize? Is it the money you are after?\"  \"No. If I want ten dollars my father will give it to me. It isn't the money, but the glory that I think of.\"  \"If I had your practice I'd go in for it myself. I shouldn't mind pocketing ten dollars.\"  \"No doubt it would be welcome to you.\"  \"Let me try your boat for a few minutes.\"  \"You can have it for ten minutes.\"  \"I would like it long enough to row over the course.\"  \"You can have it that long. I'm going over it again myself as soon as I have got rested from the last trial.\"  John Larkin got into the boat and rowed very creditably, but was soon called in by the owner of the craft.  John began to ask himself what benefit he got from associating with Conrad, who showed his selfishness on all occasions.  \"I wish he would get beaten, after all,\" thought John; \"but I don't know who there is to do it. Valentine is only a passable rower, and Jimmy Morris has no boat of his own.\"  Conrad came back in good spirits. He had beaten his former record by three-quarters of a minute.  \"I'm sure of the prize,\" he said, in exultation.     CHAPTER V.  THE BOAT RACE.   As Andy rowed only in the evening, and Conrad practiced in the afternoon, it chanced that the coming rivals never met; nor was Conrad aware that Andy proposed to dispute the prize with him.  Even at first Valentine was surprised and pleased to observe how Andy handled the oars. Before the evening was over he demonstrated the fact that he was a first-class oarsman, much to the satisfaction of his friend.  \"You must have had a good deal of practice at the gymnasium,\" said Valentine.  \"Yes; the director of the gymnasium, who is an all-around athlete, gave the boys special instruction, by which we all profited. He was a graduate of Harvard, and an old member of the University crew.\"  \"That accounts for it. Your rowing has a style to it that Conrad cannot show.\"  \"Probably he has never had any instructions.\"  \"Whatever he has accomplished has come by practice. He pulls a strong oar, but there is a roughness and lack of smoothness about his work. Still, he gets over the water pretty fast.\"  \"And that counts. How does his speed compare with mine?\"  \"As you rowed to-night, I think the race would be a close one. But this is only the first evening. Keep on practicing daily, and I will bet on you every time.\"  Andy looked pleased.  \"I am glad to hear you say this,\" he said. \"I shall not row for glory, but for the ten dollars, which I shall find very useful. You have a fine boat, Val. How does Conrad's compare with yours?\"  \"I should hardly know how to choose between them. His boat is a fine one, but mine is quite as good.\"  \"And I suppose there is no other on the pond as fine.\"  \"No; Serwin's boats are old style, and have been in use for years. If you rowed in one of those against Conrad you would be sure to be beaten.\"  \"Then if I win I shall be indebted to you for the victory.\"  Valentine smiled.  \"I should be glad to think I had anything to do with gaining the prize for you, even indirectly; but it will be due in a large measure to your own good rowing. Only, keep up your practicing.\"  \"I will do so.\"  \"I want you to win; and, besides, I want Conrad to lose. I hope he won't hear anything of your entering the race.\"  Two days before the picnic Valentine happened to meet Conrad at his father's store.  \"Are you going to enter the boat race at the picnic?\" asked the latter.  \"I am not certain.\"  \"You have the only boat that can compare with mine. Have you been practicing any?\"  \"I have been rowing a little.\"  \"I shall have to look out,\" said Conrad, but his manner did not indicate apprehension. \"Probably the prize will go either to you or me.\"  \"Thank you for the compliment.\"  \"Suppose we have a little trial by ourselves? It may do us both good.\"  \"I don't mind. When shall it be?\"  \"Say to-morrow afternoon.\"  \"Very well. I will be at the pond at four o'clock.\"  \"All right.\"  The two boys met according to agreement, and the race took place.  Conrad beat easily by eight lengths, although Valentine exerted himself to the best of his ability.  \"That settles it,\" said Conrad, triumphantly. \"You can't row against me.\"  \"I am afraid you are right,\" returned Valentine, with an air of chagrin.  \"You will need more practice, though you row fairly well. I think you pull the best oar next to me,\" said Conrad, in a patronizing tone.  \"Yes, I see that I must practice more.\"  \"There will be no need for me to practice,\" said Conrad to himself. \"I've got a dead sure thing.\"  It might have been supposed that Conrad would be indifferent to the money value of the prize offered, but he had extravagant tastes, and found his allowance from his father, though a liberal one, insufficient for his needs. He began to consider in what way he would spend the money, which he considered as good as won.  At length the day for the picnic dawned. The day previous had been unpleasant, and there had been considerable anxiety lest the weather should prove unpleasant. But greatly to the general satisfaction it was bright with sunshine, and the temperature was delightful.  The young people of both societies turned out _en masse_ and looked forward to a good time.  The race had been fixed for half-past three o'clock. At that hour the superintendent of the Sunday school came forward and said:  \"Owing to the liberality of Mr. Gale, of New York, a boarder at the hotel, a prize of ten dollars has been offered to the best oarsman who may compete for it. Boats will start from the pier, and the course will be to the opposite bank of the pond and back. I am sure that this will prove a very attractive feature of our picnic. Boys who intend to compete will now present themselves.\"  The first to come forward was Conrad Carter. He was dressed in a handsome boating costume, and his manner indicated great confidence. He looked around for Valentine, but the latter made no motion toward the shore, though his boat was in the pond drawn up with the rest.  \"Aren't you going to row, Valentine?\" asked Conrad, in surprise.  \"No; I have lent my boat to Andy Grant.\"  At the same time Andy, in his ordinary attire, came forward, and stepped into Valentine's boat.  Conrad arched his brows in surprise. He had been disappointed to find that Valentine would not row, but he was quite as well pleased at the prospect of beating Andy.  He was rather surprised, however, as he had never heard that Andy could row.  \"He must be a fool to think of rowing against me,\" he said to himself.  Next came Jimmy Morris, who took his place in one of Serwin's boats.  Two other boys also appeared in hired boats, one of them being Dennis Carlyle, a friend of John Larkin.  When the boats were in line, a superintendent gave the signal.  Conrad got the first start. The others kept together, a length or two behind Conrad. Andy did not appear to be exerting himself, but his strokes showed a smoothness that was lacking in any of the rest.  Mr. Gale, the donor of the prize, who was himself a good rower, took notice of him.  \"Who is that boy?\" he asked, pointing to Andy. \"I don't think I have seen him before.\"  \"It is Andy Grant, the son of Farmer Grant.\"  \"Why haven't I seen him before?\"  \"He has been absent at school--at Penhurst Academy.\"  \"He knows how to row. See how he handles his oars.\"  \"I didn't know he was a rower.\"  \"He is, and a good one. I shouldn't be surprised if he wins the race.\"  \"What, against Conrad Carter?\" asked the superintendent, incredulously.  \"Yes. It is easy to see that he has been trained, while Conrad, though he pulls a strong "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14831"],["title","Andy Grant's Pluck (#4)"],["body","oar, rows like a country amateur.\"  Conrad was so intent upon his own work that he had not had an opportunity of watching his competitors. When he had nearly reached the point selected on the other bank, he turned about and saw Andy close behind him.  Andy was not apparently exerting himself, but pulled a strong, steady stroke, and seemed quite free from excitement. For the first time Conrad saw that he was a competitor not to be despised.  After the turn Conrad and Andy led the procession. Next came Jimmy Morris, and last of all Dennis Carlyle.  The latter managed to catch a crab, and in his attempt to right himself tumbled into the water.  \"Don't mind me!\" he called out humorously. \"I am only taking a bath.\"  So the other contestants kept on, in the same order.  But this was not to continue. Suddenly Andy made a spurt and forged ahead of Conrad. The young aristocrat could hardly believe his eyes when he saw Valentine's boat, impelled by a competitor whom he had despised, take the leading place.  He flushed with vexation and made a desperate effort to regain his lost position. But he was excited, and did not use his strength to the best advantage.  To his great annoyance he saw that Andy was continuing to gain upon him, and that without any great effort. His smooth, steady stroke was most effective. Even the unpracticed eye could see his superiority to any of his competitors.  When the goal was reached he was five lengths ahead of Conrad, and twelve lengths ahead of Jimmy Morris.  It was a genuine surprise to the spectators, and a great shout went up.  \"Three cheers for Andy Grant!\"  Andy smiled, and he raised his hat in acknowledgment of the compliment.  Mr. Gale pressed forward and greeted the young victor.  \"You have done yourself credit,\" he said. \"You know how to row. Where did you learn?\"  \"At Penhurst Academy; I was trained by a Harvard oarsman.\"  \"He understood his business, and so do you. I have great pleasure in presenting you with the prize.\"  With a sullen look Conrad listened to those words. Without a word he sprang on shore, and, as soon as he could, turned his back upon the picnic.  \"Conrad is terribly disappointed!\" said Valentine. \"You have made yourself famous, Andy.\"     CHAPTER VI.  A LIBERAL OFFER.   Thoroughly mortified and crestfallen, Conrad went home. He hoped to go up to his room without observation, but his father noticed his entrance.  \"Well, Conrad,\" he said, with a smile, \"did you carry off the honors at the picnic?\"  \"No, I didn't,\" answered Conrad, bitterly.  \"Did Valentine Burns defeat you?\"  \"No.\"  \"Who did win the prize?\"  \"Andy Grant.\"  Squire Carter was amazed.  \"Can he row?\" he ejaculated.  \"Yes, a little.\"  \"But he beat you?\"  \"I tell you how it was, father,\" said Conrad, who had decided upon his story. \"I was well ahead till we got halfway back, when I got a terrible pain in my arm. I must have strained it, I think. Of course I couldn't do anything after that, and Andy, who was next to me, went in and won.\"  Squire Carter never thought of doubting Conrad's story. His pride extended to his family and all connected with him, and he felt satisfied that Conrad was the best rower in the village.  \"Where did the Grant boy learn to row?\" he asked.  \"I heard him tell Mr. Gale that he learned at the academy.\"  \"You don't think he is equal to you?\"  \"Of course he isn't. I am miles ahead of him.\"  \"It was very unfortunate that your arm gave out. You had better speak to your mother, and she will put some arnica on it.\"  \"I will,\" said Conrad cunningly. \"I would rather have had any boy beat me than that upstart, Andy Grant. He will put on no end of airs. Besides, I shall miss the money.\"  \"That, at any rate, I can make up to you. Here are two five-dollar bills.\"  \"Thank you, father,\" said Conrad, as, with much satisfaction, he pocketed the bills. \"It was lucky I thought about the strain,\" he said to himself. \"All the same, it is awfully humiliating to be beaten by that beggar.\"  \"How do you think Conrad accounts for his defeat, Andy?\" said Valentine the next day.  \"I can't tell.\"  \"He says he strained the muscles of his arm.\"  Andy smiled.  \"If it will make him feel any better, I have no objection to that explanation.\"  \"His father has given him ten dollars, so he will not lose any money. But he won't get any of the boys to believe his story.\"  \"The money is very acceptable to me,\" said Andy. \"If I had lost, my father couldn't have made it up to me.\"  At five o'clock, on his way to the post office, Andy met Mr. Gale.  Walter Gale was a young man about twenty-five. He had a pleasant face, and his manner was genial. He had a strong sympathy with boys, and he was a favorite with them.  \"Well, Andrew,\" he said; \"have you recovered from your exertions in the boat race?\"  \"Oh, yes; I am used to rowing, and felt very little fatigue.\"  \"I hear that Conrad is very much mortified by his defeat.\"  \"I believe he is. He felt sure of winning.\"  \"And he would have done so if you had remained out of the list.\"  \"He told Valentine Burns that he strained the muscles of his arm, and that this defeated him.\"  \"I should think better of him if he would acknowledge that he was fairly beaten. Are you at leisure this evening?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Then call upon me at the hotel. I shall be glad to know you better.\"  This invitation Andy was very glad to accept. He was drawn to the young man, and felt that he was likely to prove a sincere friend.  At seven o'clock he left the farmhouse, and on arriving at the hotel found Mr. Gale sitting on the piazza.  \"I was looking for you,\" said the young man. \"Come up to my room.\"  He led the way to a front corner apartment on the second floor. It was the best room in the hotel, and he had furnished it in the most comfortable and attractive manner. Pictures hung on the walls, and there was a bookcase containing a goodly array of volumes.  \"What a pleasant room!\" exclaimed Andy.  \"Yes; I have tried to make myself comfortable. What I lack most is society.\"  \"I wonder that you are content to live in the country. Are you not accustomed to the city?\"  \"Yes; but I had a severe sickness in the spring, and the doctors recommended me to absent myself for a time from the excitement of the town and take up my residence in the country.\"  \"Didn't that interfere with your business?\"  Walter Gale smiled.  \"Fortunately, or unfortunately,\" he answered, \"I have no business. Until two years since I was employed in an insurance office in the city. The death of an uncle has made me pecuniarily independent, so that I had leisure to be sick.\"  \"You look in good health now.\"  \"Yes; but I have a nervous temperament, and am obliged to be careful. Now tell me about yourself. You have been for some time at Penhurst Academy?\"  \"Yes; for two years.\"  \"Do you go back there?\"  \"No; my father has met with serious losses, and can no longer afford to send me. I must stay at home and help him.\"  \"And this is a disappointment to you?\"  \"Yes; I was expecting to go to college in a few months.\"  \"I believe your father is a farmer?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do you expect to assist him on the farm?\"  \"Till I can get something to do. I shall try to get some business situation. Business pays better than farming.\"  \"I suppose you are a good Latin and Greek scholar?\"  \"Yes; that is, I like the languages, and stood high in my classes.\"  \"My own education is limited. Though I am rich now, I was a poor boy. At sixteen I had made some progress in Latin and commenced Greek, when my father's failure obliged me to seek employment. The uncle who has now made me rich would do nothing for me; so I left school half educated.\"  \"You would be able to make up deficiencies now,\" suggested Andy.  \"That is what I have been thinking of, if I can get a satisfactory teacher.\"  \"I don't think you can find a classical teacher in Arden.\"  \"I know of one, if he would be willing to undertake the task.\"  \"Who is it?\" asked Andy, puzzled.  \"Andrew Grant,\" answered this young man, with a smile.  \"Do you mean me?\" asked Andy, with a wondering face.  \"Certainly. You are fresh from school, and I am sure you would be competent to teach me.\"  \"But I am only a boy.\"  \"Age has nothing to do with a teacher's qualifications, except as to discipline. You wouldn't find me a very advanced pupil. I had read one book in _Caesar_ when I was compelled to leave school, and had begun to translate Greek a little. Now the question is, are you willing to teach me?\"  \"If you think I am competent, Mr. Gale.\"  \"I don't doubt that. We will begin, if you like, next Monday. Perhaps, in order to avoid village gossip, it will be well to pass yourself off as my private secretary. Indeed, I will employ you a little in that way also.\"  \"I shall be very glad to serve you in any way.\"  \"Then come to-morrow morning at nine and remain with me till twelve. Now about the compensation.\"  \"Fix that to suit yourself, Mr. Gale. I am almost ashamed to ask anything.\"  \"The laborer is worthy of his hire, Andy. Suppose I pay you six dollars a week to begin with?\"  \"The money will be very acceptable, but I am afraid you will be overpaying me.\"  \"I will take my risk of that. On the whole, I will call it nine dollars a week, and we will spend the afternoon together also. I will send to the city for a boat, and you shall give me lessons in rowing.\"  Andy's eyes sparkled. Nothing would please him better, and the prospect of earning nine dollars a week made him feel like a millionaire.     CHAPTER VII.  AN ENCOUNTER WITH A TRAMP.   It is hardly necessary to say that Andy's parents were equally surprised and pleased at his new engagement.  \"You will like that better than working on the farm, I expect, Andy?\" said Sterling Grant.  \"Yes, father. I am willing to work, but I don't feel much interest in farming.\"  \"It is hard work and poor pay, Andy, but I like it. I was brought up to it when a boy, and there is nothing else I can do.\"  \"Andy is already beginning to get some advantage from his education,\" said Mrs."]]]
