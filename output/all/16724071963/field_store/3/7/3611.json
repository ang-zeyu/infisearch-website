So he ran off as fast as he could.  [Illustration: Boy throwing snowball through window.]  7. As soon as he got round the next corner, George stopped, because he was very sorry for what he had done.  8. He said to himself, \"I have no right to spend my silver dollar, now. I ought to go back, and pay for the glass I broke with my snowball.\"  9. He went up and down the street, and felt very sad. He wished very much to buy something nice. He also wished to pay for the broken glass.  10. At last he said, \"It was wrong to break the window, though I did not mean to do it. I will go and pay for it, if it takes all my money, I will try not to be sorry. I do not think the man will hurt me if I pay for the mischief I have done.\"    LESSON LXI.  mer'chant    hon'est ly    rang    mind  part'ner     with out'     rich    bell   THE BROKEN WINDOW. (CONCLUDED.)  1. George started off, and felt much happier for having made up his mind to do what was right.  2. He rang the doorbell. When the man came out, George said, \"Sir, I threw a snowball through your window. But I did not intend to do it. I am very sorry, and wish to pay you. Here is the dollar my father gave me as a New- year gift.\"  3. The gentleman took the dollar, and asked George if he had no more money. George said he had not. \"Well,\" said he, \"this will do.\"  [Illustration: George paying for broken window.]  4. So, after asking George his name, and where he lived, he called him an honest boy, and shut the door.  5. George went home at dinner time, with a face as rosy, and eyes as bright, as if nothing had gone wrong. At dinner, Mr. Ellet asked him what he had bought with his money.  6. George very honestly told him all about the broken window, and said he felt very well without any money to spend.  7. When dinner was over, Mr. Ellet told George to go and look in his cap. He did so, and found two silver dollars there.  8. The man, whose window had been broken, had been there, and told Mr. Ellet about it. He gave back George's dollar and another besides.  9. A short time after this, the man came and told Mr. Ellet that he wanted a good boy to stay in his store.  10. As soon as George left school, he went to live with this man, who was a rich merchant. In a few years he became the merchant's partner.

Hour-glass and flowers on table between them.]   FRANK AND THE HOURGLASS.  1. Frank was a very talkative little boy. He never saw a new thing without asking a great many questions about it.  2. His mother was very patient and kind. When it was proper to answer his questions, she would do so.  3. Sometimes she would say, \"You are not old enough to understand that, my son. When you are ten years old, you may ask me about it, and I will tell you.\"  4. When his mother said this, he never teased any more. He knew she always liked to answer him when he asked proper questions.  5. The first time Frank saw an hourglass, he was very much amused; but he did not know what it was.  6. His mother said, \"An hourglass is made in the shape of the figure 8. The sand is put in at one end, and runs through a small hole in the middle. As much sand is put into the glass as will run through in an hour.\"  7. Frank watched the little stream of sand. He was impatient, because it would not run faster. \"Let me shake it, mother,\" said he; \"it is lazy, and will never get through.\"  8. \"Oh yes, it will, my son,\" said his mother, \"The sand moves by little and little, but it moves all the time. 9. \"When you look at the hands of the clock, you think they go very slowly, and so they do; but they never stop.  10, \"While you are at play the sand is running, grain by grain, The hands of the clock are moving, second by second.  11. \"At night, the sand in the hourglass has run through twelve times. The hour hand of the clock has moved all around its great face.  12. \"This because they keep work every minute. They do not stop to think how much they have to do, and how long it will take them to do it.\"  13. Now, Frank's mother wanted him to learn a little hymn; but he said \"Mother, I can never learn it.\"  14. His mother said, \"Study all the time. Never stop to ask how long it will take to learn it. You will be able to say it very soon.\"  15. Frank followed his mother's advice. He studied line after line, very busily; and in one hour and a half he knew the hymn perfectly.

Then she answers, \"He is going,      Going on his way.  4. \"Poor old Winter does not love you;      But his time is past;    Soon my birds shall sing above you;--      Set you free at last.\"                                 Mary Mapes Dodge.

She won't be caught.\"  [Illustration: Man and boy chasing horse.]  2. Such was the report the hired man brought in to Mrs. Templar one pleasant May morning, when she had been planning a ride.  3. \"I suppose it can not be helped, but I wanted her very much,\" she said, as she turned away.  4. \"What was it you wanted, mother?\" asked Jenny Templar, a bright, brown-haired, brown-eyed girl of twelve, who had just come into the room.  5. \"Fanny,\" said the mother. \"It is such a beautiful morning, I meant to drive down to the village, get some groceries, then call for your Aunt Ann, have a nice ride up the river road, and bring her home to dinner.  6. \"But father is away for all day, and the men have been trying nearly an hour to catch Fanny; one of the men says she can't be caught.\"  7. \"Maybe she can't by him,\" said Jenny, with a merry laugh. \"But, get ready, mother; you shall go if you like. I'll catch Fanny, and harness her, too.\"  8. \"Why, my child, they say she jumped the ditch three or four times, and acted like a wild creature. You'll only be late at school, and tire yourself for nothing.\"  9. \"It won't take me long, mother. Fanny will come to me,\" said Jenny, cheerily. She put on her wide straw hat, and was off in a moment, down the hill, to the field where the horse was grazing.  10. The moment Fanny heard the rustle of Jenny's dress, she pricked up her ears, snorted, and, with head erect, seemed ready to bound away again.  [Illustration: Girl leading horse.]  11. \"Fanny! O Fanny!\" called Jenny, and the beautiful creature turned her head. That gentle tone she well knew, and, glad to see her friend, she carne directly to the fence, and rubbed her head on the girl's shoulder. As soon as the gate was opened, she followed Jenny to the barn.  12. The men had treated her roughly, and she remembered it. But she knew and loved the voice that was always kind, and the hand that often fed and caressed her. She gave love for love, and willing service for kindness.

The bell had rung, and the children had run out into the bright sunshine, wild with laughter and fun.   2. All but poor Davy. He came out last and very slowly, but he did not laugh. He was in trouble, and the bright, golden sunlight did not make him glad.  3. He walked across the yard, and sat down on a stone behind the old maple. A little bird on the highest branch sang just to make him laugh.  4. But Davy did not notice it. He was thinking of the cruel words that had been said about his ragged clothes. The tears stole out of his eyes, and ran down his cheeks.  [Illustration: Boy sitting alone under tree in schoolyard. Other children playing in background.]  5. Poor Davy had no father, and his mother had to work hard to keep him at school.  6. That night, he went home by the path that led across the fields and through the woods. He still felt sad.  7. Davy did not wish to trouble his mother; so he lingered a while among the trees, and at last threw himself on the green moss under them.  [Illustration: Woman talking to boy.]  8. Just then his teacher came along. She saw who it was, and stopped, saying kindly, \"What is the matter, Davy?\"  9. He did not speak, but the tears began again to start.  10. \"Won't you tell me? Perhaps I can help you.\"  11. Then he told her all his trouble.  When he ended, she said, cheerily, \"I have a plan, Davy, that I think will help you.\"  12. \"Oh, what is it?\" he said, sitting up with a look of hope, while a tear fell upon a blue violet.  l3. \"Well, how would you like to be a little flower merchant?\"  14. \"And earn money?\" said Davy. \"That would be jolly. But where shall I get my flowers?\"  15. \"Right in these woods, and in the fields,\" said his teacher. \" Here are lovely blue violets, down by the brook are white ones, and among the rocks are ferns and mosses. Bring them all to my house, and I will help you arrange them.\"  16. So, day after day, Davy hunted the woods for the prettiest flowers, and the most dainty ferns and mosses. After his teacher had helped to arrange them, he took them to the city that was near, and sold them.  17. He soon earned money enough to buy new clothes."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1467"],["title","Some Christmas Stories (#0)"],["body","from the 1911 Chapman and Hall Christmas Stories edition, Volume 1, by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org                             SOME SHORT CHRISTMAS STORIES                                     by                              CHARLES DICKENS   CONTENTS.

[1850]   I HAVE been looking on, this evening, at a merry company of children assembled round that pretty German toy, a Christmas Tree.  The tree was planted in the middle of a great round table, and towered high above their heads.  It was brilliantly lighted by a multitude of little tapers; and everywhere sparkled and glittered with bright objects.  There were rosy-cheeked dolls, hiding behind the green leaves; and there were real watches (with movable hands, at least, and an endless capacity of being wound up) dangling from innumerable twigs; there were French-polished tables, chairs, bedsteads, wardrobes, eight-day clocks, and various other articles of domestic furniture (wonderfully made, in tin, at Wolverhampton), perched among the boughs, as if in preparation for some fairy housekeeping; there were jolly, broad-faced little men, much more agreeable in appearance than many real men—and no wonder, for their heads took off, and showed them to be full of sugar-plums; there were fiddles and drums; there were tambourines, books, work-boxes, paint-boxes, sweetmeat-boxes, peep-show boxes, and all kinds of boxes; there were trinkets for the elder girls, far brighter than any grown-up gold and jewels; there were baskets and pincushions in all devices; there were guns, swords, and banners; there were witches standing in enchanted rings of pasteboard, to tell fortunes; there were teetotums, humming-tops, needle-cases, pen-wipers, smelling-bottles, conversation-cards, bouquet-holders; real fruit, made artificially dazzling with gold leaf; imitation apples, pears, and walnuts, crammed with surprises; in short, as a pretty child, before me, delightedly whispered to another pretty child, her bosom friend, “There was everything, and more.”  This motley collection of odd objects, clustering on the tree like magic fruit, and flashing back the bright looks directed towards it from every side—some of the diamond-eyes admiring it were hardly on a level with the table, and a few were languishing in timid wonder on the bosoms of pretty mothers, aunts, and nurses—made a lively realisation of the fancies of childhood; and set me thinking how all the trees that grow and all the things that come into existence on the earth, have their wild adornments at that well-remembered time.  Being now at home again, and alone, the only person in the house awake, my thoughts are drawn back, by a fascination which I do not care to resist, to my own childhood.  I begin to consider, what do we all remember best upon the branches of the Christmas Tree of our own young Christmas days, by which we climbed to real life.  Straight, in the middle of the room, cramped in the freedom of its growth by no encircling walls or soon-reached ceiling, a shadowy tree arises; and, looking up into the dreamy brightness of its top—for I observe in this tree the singular property that it appears to grow downward towards the earth—I look into my youngest Christmas recollections!  All toys at first, I find.  Up yonder, among the green holly and red berries, is the Tumbler with his hands in his pockets, who wouldn’t lie down, but whenever he was put upon the floor, persisted in rolling his fat body about, until he rolled himself still, and brought those lobster eyes of his to bear upon me—when I affected to laugh very much, but in my heart of hearts was extremely doubtful of him.  Close beside him is that infernal snuff-box, out of which there sprang a demoniacal Counsellor in a black gown, with an obnoxious head of hair, and a red cloth mouth, wide open, who was not to be endured on any terms, but could not be put away either; for he used suddenly, in a highly magnified state, to fly out of Mammoth Snuff-boxes in dreams, when least expected.  Nor is the frog with cobbler’s wax on his tail, far off; for there was no knowing where he wouldn’t jump; and when he flew over the candle, and came upon one’s hand with that spotted back—red on a green ground—he was horrible.  The cardboard lady in a blue-silk skirt, who was stood up against the candlestick to dance, and whom I see on the same branch, was milder, and was beautiful; but I can’t say as much for the larger cardboard man, who used to be hung against the wall and pulled by a string; there was a sinister expression in that nose of his; and when he got his legs round his neck (which he very often did), he was ghastly, and not a creature to be alone with.  When did that dreadful Mask first look at me?  Who put it on, and why was I so frightened that the sight of it is an era in my life?  It is not a hideous visage in itself; it is even meant to be droll, why then were its stolid features so intolerable?  Surely not because it hid the wearer’s face.  An apron would have done as much; and though I should have preferred even the apron away, it would not have been absolutely insupportable, like the mask.  Was it the immovability of the mask?  The doll’s face was immovable, but I was not afraid of _her_.  Perhaps that fixed and set change coming over a real face, infused into my quickened heart some remote suggestion and dread of the universal change that is to come on every face, and make it still?  Nothing reconciled me to it.  No drummers, from whom proceeded a melancholy chirping on the turning of a handle; no regiment of soldiers, with a mute band, taken out of a box, and fitted, one by one, upon a stiff and lazy little set of lazy-tongs; no old woman, made of wires and a brown-paper composition, cutting up a pie for two small children; could give me a permanent comfort, for a long time.  Nor was it any satisfaction to be shown the Mask, and see that it was made of paper, or to have it locked up and be assured that no one wore it.  The mere recollection of that fixed face, the mere knowledge of its existence anywhere, was sufficient to awake me in the night all perspiration and horror, with, “O I know it’s coming!  O the mask!”  I never wondered what the dear old donkey with the panniers—there he is! was made of, then!  His hide was real to the touch, I recollect.  And the great black horse with the round red spots all over him—the horse that I could even get upon—I never wondered what had brought him to that strange condition, or thought that such a horse was not commonly seen at Newmarket.  The four horses of no colour, next to him, that went into the waggon of cheeses, and could be taken out and stabled under the piano, appear to have bits of fur-tippet for their tails, and other bits for their manes, and to stand on pegs instead of legs, but it was not so when they were brought home for a Christmas present.  They were all right, then; neither was their harness unceremoniously nailed into their chests, as appears to be the case now.  The tinkling works of the music-cart, I _did_ find out, to be made of quill tooth-picks and wire; and I always thought that little tumbler in his shirt sleeves, perpetually swarming up one side of a wooden frame, and coming down, head foremost, on the other, rather a weak-minded person—though good-natured; but the Jacob’s Ladder, next him, made of little squares of red wood, that went flapping and clattering over one another, each developing a different picture, and the whole enlivened by small bells, was a mighty marvel and a great delight.  Ah!  The Doll’s house!—of which I was not proprietor, but where I visited.  I don’t admire the Houses of Parliament half so much as that stone-fronted mansion with real glass windows, and door-steps, and a real balcony—greener than I ever see now, except at watering places; and even they afford but a poor imitation.  And though it _did_ open all at once, the entire house-front (which was a blow, I admit, as cancelling the fiction of a staircase), it was but to shut it up again, and I could believe.  Even open, there were three distinct rooms in it: a sitting-room and bed-room, elegantly furnished, and best of all, a kitchen, with uncommonly soft fire-irons, a plentiful assortment of diminutive utensils—oh, the warming-pan!—and a tin man-cook in profile, who was always going to fry two fish.  What Barmecide justice have I done to the noble feasts wherein the set of wooden platters figured, each with its own peculiar delicacy, as a ham or turkey, glued tight on to it, and garnished with something green, which I recollect as moss!  Could all the Temperance Societies of these later days, united, give me such a tea-drinking as I have had through the means of yonder little set of blue crockery, which really would hold liquid (it ran out of the small wooden cask, I recollect, and tasted of matches), and which made tea, nectar. And if the two legs of the ineffectual little sugar-tongs did tumble over one another, and want purpose, like Punch’s hands, what does it matter? And if I did once shriek out, as a poisoned child, and strike the fashionable company with consternation, by reason of having drunk a little teaspoon, inadvertently dissolved in too hot tea, I was never the worse for it, except by a powder!  Upon the next branches of the tree, lower down, hard by the green roller and miniature gardening-tools, how thick the books begin to hang.  Thin books, in themselves, at first, but many of them, and with deliciously smooth covers of bright red or green.  What fat black letters to begin with!  “A was an archer, and shot at a frog.”  Of course he"]]]
