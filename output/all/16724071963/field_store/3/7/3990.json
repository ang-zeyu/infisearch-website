ABSTRACTED FROM THE FOLIO EDITION,  BY THE AUTHOR,  SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.         *       *       *       *       *  TO WHICH IS PREFIXED,  DR. JOHNSON'S PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL FOLIO EDITION,  AND  HIS GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.  1812.         *       *       *       *       *  A GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE.  GRAMMAR, which is the art of using words properly, comprises four parts: Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.      In this division and order of the parts of grammar I follow the common     grammarians, without inquiring whether a fitter distribution might not     be found. Experience has long shown this method to be so distinct as to     obviate confusion, and so comprehensive as to prevent any inconvenient     omissions. I likewise use the terms already received, and already     understood, though perhaps others more proper might sometimes be     invented. Sylburgius, and other innovators, whose new terms have sunk     their learning into neglect, have left sufficient warning against the     trifling ambition of teaching arts in a new language.  ORTHOGRAPHY is the art of combining letters into syllables, and syllables into words. It therefore teaches previously the form and sound of letters.  The letters of the English language are,  Roman.      Italick.    Name.

Our letters are commonly reckoned twenty-four, because anciently i and     j as well as u and v were expressed by the same character; but as those     letters, which had always different powers, have now different forms,     our alphabet may be properly said to consist of twenty-six letters  Vowels are five, a, e, i, o, u.  Such is the number generally received; but for i it is the practice to write y in the end of words, as thy, holy; before i, as from die, dying; from beautify, beautifying; in the words says, days, eyes; and in words derived from the Greek, and written originally with υ, as sympathy, συμπαθεια, system, συστημα.  For u we often write w after a vowel, to make a diphthong; as, raw, grew, view, vow, flowing; lowness.  The sounds of all the letters are various.      In treating on the letters, I shall not, like some other grammarians,     inquire into the original of their form, as an antiquarian; nor into     their formation and prolation by the organs of speech, as a mechanick,     anatomist, or physiologist; nor into the properties and gradation of     sounds, or the elegance or harshness of particular combinations, as a     writer of universal and transcendental grammar. I consider the English     alphabet only as it is English; and even in this narrow disquisition I     follow the example of former grammarians, perhaps with more reverence     than judgment, because by writing in English I suppose my reader     already acquainted with the English language, and consequently able to     pronounce the letters of which I teach the pronunciation; and because     of sounds in general it may be observed, that words are unable to     describe them. An account, therefore, of the primitive and simple     letters, is useless, almost alike to those who know their sound, and     those who know it not.  OF VOWELS  A.  A has three sounds, the slender, open, and broad.  A slender is found in most words, as face, mane, and in words ending in ation, as creation, salvation, generation.      The a slender is the proper English a, called very justly by Erpenius,     in his Arabick Grammar, a Anglicum cum e mistum, as having a middle     sound between the open a and the e. The French have a similar sound in     the word pais, and in their e masculine.  A open is the a of the Italian, or nearly resembles it; as father, rather, congratulate, fancy, glass.  A broad resembles the a of the German; as all, wall, call.      Many words pronounced with a broad were anciently written with au; as     sault, mault; and we still say, fault, vault. This was probably the     Saxon sound, for it is yet retained in the northern dialects, and in     the rustick pronunciation; as maun for man, haund for hand.  The short a approaches to the a open, as grass.  The long a, if prolonged by e at the end of the word, is always slender, as graze, fame.  A forms a diphthong only with i or y, and u or w. Ai or ay, as in plain, wain, gay, clay, has only the sound of the long and slender a, and differs not in the pronunciation from plane, wane.  Au or aw has the sound of the German a, as raw, naughty.      Ae is sometimes found in Latin words not completely naturalized or     assimilated, but is no English diphthong; and is more properly     expressed by single e, as Cesar, Eneas.  E.      E is the letter which occurs most frequently in the English language.  E is long, as in scēne; or short, as in cĕllar, sĕparate, cĕlebrate, mĕn, thĕn.  It is always short before a double consonant, or two consonants, as in vĕx, pĕrplexity, relĕnt, mĕdlar, rĕptile, sĕrpent, cĕllar, cĕssation, blĕssing, fĕll, fĕlling, dĕbt.  E is always mute at the end of a word, except in monosyllables that have no other vowel, as the; or proper names, as Penelope, Phebe, Derbe; being used to modify the foregoing consonants, as since, once, hedge, oblige; or to lengthen the preceding vowel, as băn, bāne; căn, cāne; pĭn, pīne; tŭn, tūne; rŭb, rūbe; pŏp, pōpe; fĭr, fīre; cŭr, cūre; tŭb, tūbe.      Almost all words which now terminate in consonants ended anciently in     e, as year, yeare; wildness, wildnesse; which e probably had the force     of the French e feminine, and constituted a syllable with its associate     consonant; for in old editions words are sometimes divided thus,     clea-re, fel-le, knowled-ge. This e was perhaps for a time vocal or     silent in poetry as convenience required; but it has been long wholly     mute. Camden in his Remains calls it the silent e.  It does not always lengthen the foregoing vowel, as glŏve, lĭve, gĭve.  It has sometimes in the end of words a sound obscure, and scarcely perceptible, as open, shapen, shotten, thistle, participle, metre, lucre.      This faintness of sound is found when e separates a mute from a liquid,     as in rotten, or follows a mute and liquid, as in cattle.  E forms a diphthong with a, as near; with i, as deign, receive; and with u or w, as new, stew.  Ea sounds like e long, as mean; or like ee, as dear, clear, near.  Ei is sounded like e long, as seize, perceiving.  Eu sounds as u long and soft.  E, a, u, are combined in beauty and its derivatives, but have only the sound of u.  E may be said to form a diphthong by reduplication, as agree, sleeping.      Eo is found in yeoman, where it is sounded as o short; and in people,     where it is pronounced like ee.  I.  I has a sound long, as fīne; and short as fĭn.      That is eminently observable in i, which may be likewise remarkable in     other letters, that the short sound is not the long sound contracted,     but a sound wholly different.  The long sound in monosyllables is always marked by the e final, as thĭn, thīne.  I is often sounded before r, as a short u; as flirt, first, shirt.  It forms a diphthong only with e, as field, shield, which is sounded as the double ee; except friend, which is sounded as frĕnd.      I is joined with eu in lieu, and ew in view; which triphthongs are     sounded as the open u.  O.  O is long, as bōne, ōbedient, corrōding; or short, as blŏck, knŏck, ŏblique, lŏll.  Women is pronounced wimen.      The short o has sometimes the sound of close u, as son, come.  O coalesces into a diphthong with a, as moan, groan, approach: oa has the sound of o long.      O is united to e in some words derived from Greek, as œconomy; but as     being not an English diphthong, they are better written as they are     sounded, with only e, economy.  With i, as oil, soil, moil, noisome.      This coalition of letters seems to unite the sounds of the two letters,     as far as two sounds can be united without being destroyed, and     therefore approaches more nearly than any combination in our tongue to     the notion of a diphthong.  With o, as boot, hoot, cooler; oo has the sound of the Italian u.  With u or w, as our, power, flower; but in some words has only the sound of o long, as in soul, bowl, sow, grow. These different sounds are used to distinguish different significations: as bow an instrument for shooting; bow, a depression of the head; sow, the she of a boar; sow, to scatter seed; bowl, an orbicular body; bowl, a wooden vessel.  Ou is sometimes pronounced like o soft, as court; sometimes like o short, as cough; sometimes like u close, as could; or u open, as rough, tough, which use only can teach.      Ou is frequently used in the last syllable of words which in Latin end     in or and are made English, as honour, labour, favour, from honor,     labor, favor.      Some late innovators have ejected the u, without considering that the     last syllable "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],["title","A Grammar of the English Tongue (#1)"],["body","the sound neither of or nor ur, but a sound between     them, if not compounded of both; besides that they are probably derived     to us from the French nouns in eur, as honeur, faveur.  U.  U is long in ūse, confūsion; or short, as ŭs, concŭssion.  It coalesces with a, e, i, o; but has rather in these combinations the force of the w consonant, as quaff, quest, quit, quite, languish; sometimes in ui the i loses its sound, as in juice. It is sometimes mute before a, e, i, y, as guard, guest, guise, buy.      U is followed by e in virtue, but the e has no sound.      Ue is sometimes mute at the end of a word, in imitation of the French,     as prorogue, synagogue, plague, vague, harangue.  Y.  Y is a vowel, which, as Quintilian observes of one of the Roman letters, we might want without inconvenience, but that we have it. It supplies the place of i at the end of words, as thy, before an i, as dying; and is commonly retained in derivative words where it was part of a diphthong, in the primitive; as, destroy, destroyer; betray, betrayed, betrayer; pray, prayer; say, sayer; day, days.      Y being the Saxon vowel y, which was commonly used where i is now put,     occurs very frequently in all old books.  GENERAL RULES.  A vowel in the beginning or middle syllable, before two consonants, is commonly short, as ŏppŏrtunity.  In monosyllables a single vowel before a single consonant is short; as stag, frog.      Many is pronounced as if it were written manny.         *       *       *       *       *  OF CONSONANTS.  B.  B has one unvaried sound, such as it obtains in other languages.  It is mute in debt, debtor, subtle, doubt, lamb, limb, dumb, thumb, climb, comb, womb.      It is used before l and r, as black, brown.  C.  C has before e and i the sound of s; as sincerely, centrick, century, circular, cistern, city, siccity: before a, o, and u, it sounds like k, as calm, concavity, copper, incorporate, curiosity, concupiscence.      C might be omitted in the language without loss, since one of its     sounds might be supplied by, s, and the other by k, but that it     preserves to the eye the etymology of words, as face from facies,     captive from captivus.  Ch has a sound which is analyzed into tsh, as church, chin, crutch. It is the same sound which the Italians give to the c simple before i and e, as citta, cerro.  Ch is sounded like k in words derived from the Greek, as chymist, scheme, choler. Arch is commonly sounded ark before a vowel, as archangel, and with the English sound of ch before a consonant, as archbishop.      Ch, in some French words not yet assimilated, sounds like sh, as     machine, chaise.      C, according to English orthography, never ends a word; therefore we     write stick, block, which were originally, sticke, blocke. In such     words c is now mute.      It is used before l and r, as clock, cross.  D.  Is uniform in its sound, as death, diligent.      It is used before r, as draw, dross; and w as dwell.  F.  F, though having a name beginning with a vowel, is numbered by the grammarians among the semivowels, yet has this quality of a mute, that it is commodiously sounded before a liquid, as flask, fry, freckle. It has an unvariable sound, except that of is sometimes spoken nearly as ov.  G.  G has two sounds; one hard, as in gay, go, gun; the other soft, as in gem, giant.  At the end of a word it is always hard, as ring, snug, song, frog.  Before e and i the sound is uncertain.  G before e is soft, as gem, generation, except in gear, geld, geese, get, gewgaw, and derivatives from words ending in g, as singing, stronger, and generally before er at the ends of words, as finger.  G is mute before n, as gnash, sign, foreign.  G before i is hard, as give, except in giant, gigantick, gibbet, gibe, giblets, Giles, gill, gilliflower, gin, ginger, gingle, to which may be added Egypt and gypsy.  Gh in the beginning of a word has the sound of the hard g, as ghostly; in the middle, and sometimes at the end, it is quite silent, as though, right, sought, spoken tho', rite, soute.  It has often at the end the sound of f, as laugh; whence laughter retains the same sound in the middle; cough, trough, sough, tough, enough, slough.      It is not to be doubted, but that in the original pronunciation gh has     the force of a consonant deeply guttural, which is still continued     among the Scotch.      G is used before h, l, and r.  H.  H is a note of aspiration, and shows that the following vowel must be pronounced with a strong emission of breath, as hat, horse.  It seldom begins any but the first syllable, in which it is always sounded with a full breath, except in heir, herb, hostler, honour, humble, honest, humour and their derivatives.      It sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded, as     blockhead; or derived from the Latin, as comprehend.  J.  J consonant sounds uniformly like the soft g, and is therefore a letter useless, except in etymology, as ejaculation, jester, jocund, juice.  K.  K has the sound of hard c, and is used before e and i, where, according to English analogy, c would be soft, as kept, king, skirt, skeptick, for so it should be written, not sceptick, because sc is sounded like s, as in scene.      It is used before n, as knell, knot, but totally loses its sound in     modern pronunciation.  K is never doubled; but c is used before it to shorten the vowel by a double consonant, as cockle, pickle.  L.  L has in English the same liquid sound as in other languages.      The custom is to double the l at the end of monosyllables, as kill,     will, full. These words were originally written kille, wille, fulle;     and when the e first grew silent, and was afterward omitted, the ll was     retained, to give force, according to the analogy of our language, to     the foregoing vowel.  L, is sometimes mute, as in calf, half, halves, calves, could, would, should, psalm, talk, salmon, falcon.      The Saxons, who delighted in guttural sounds, sometimes aspirated the l     at the beginning of words, as hlaf, a loaf, or bread; hlaford, a lord;     but this pronunciation is now disused.  Le at the end of words is pronounced like a weak el, in which the e is almost mute, as table, shuttle.  M.  M has always the same sound, as murmur, monumental.  N.  N has always, the same sound, as noble, manners.  N is sometimes mute after m, as damn, condemn, hymn.  P.  P has always the same sound which the Welsh and Germans confound with b.  P is sometimes mute, as in psalm, and between m and t, as tempt.  Ph is used for f in words derived from the Greek, as philosopher, philanthropy, Philip.  Q.  Q, as in other languages, is always followed by u, and has a sound which our Saxon ancestors well expressed by cw, as quadrant, queen, equestrian, quilt, inquiry, quire, quotidian. Qu is never followed by u.  Qu is sometimes sounded, in words derived from the French, like k, as conquer, liquor, risque, chequer.  R.  R has the same rough snarling sound as in the other tongues.      The Saxons used often to put h before it, as before l at the beginning     of words.      Rh is used in words derived from the Greek, as myrrh, myrrhine,     catarrhous, rheum, rheumatick, rhyme.  Re, at the end of some words derived from the Latin or French, is pronounced like a weak er, as theatre, sepulchre.  S.  S has a hissing sound, as sibilation, sister.      A single s seldom ends any word, except in the third person of verbs,     as loves, grows; and the plurals of nouns, as trees, bushes,     distresses; the pronouns this, his, ours, yours, us; the adverb thus;     and words derived from Latin, as rebus, surplus; the close being always     either in se, as house, horse, or in ss, as grass, dress, bliss, less,     anciently grasse, dresse.  S, single at the end of words, has a grosser sound, like that of z, as trees, eyes, except this, thus, us, rebus, surplus.  It sounds like z before ion, if a vowel goes before it, as intrusion; and like s, if it follows a consonant, as conversion.  It sounds like z before e mute, as refuse, and before y final, as rosy; and in those words, bosom, desire, wisdom, prison, prisoner, present, present, damsel, casement.      It is the peculiar quality of s, that it may be sounded before all     consonants, except x and z, in which s is comprised, x being only ks,     and z a hard or gross s. This s is therefore termed by grammarians suæ     potestatis litera; the reason of which the learned Dr. Clarke     erroneously supposed to be, that in some words it might be doubled at     pleasure. Thus we find in several languages.  Σβεννυμι, scatter, sdegno, sdrucciolo, sfavellare, σφιγξ, sgombrare, sgranare, shake, slumber, smell, snipe, space, splendour, spring, squeeze, shrew, step, strength, stramen, stripe, sventura, swell.  S is mute in isle, island, demesne, viscount.  T.  T has its customary sound; as take, temptation.  Ti before a vowel has the sound of si as salvation, except an s goes before, as question; excepting likewise derivatives from words ending in ty, as mighty, mightier.  Th has two sounds; the one soft, as thus, whether; the other hard, as thing, think. The sound is soft in these words, then, thence, and there, with their derivatives and compounds, and in that, these, thou, thee, thy, thine, their, they, this, those, them, though, thus; and in all words between two vowels, as, father, whether; and between r and a vowel, as burthen.  In other words it is hard, as thick, thunder, faith, faithful. Where it is softened at the end of a word, an e silent must be added, as breath, breathe; cloth, clothe.  V.  V has a sound of near affinity to that of f, as vain, vanity.      From f in the Islandick alphabet, v is only distinguished by a     diacritical point.  W.  Of w, which in diphthongs is often an undoubted vowel, some grammarians have doubted whether it ever be a consonant; and not rather as it is called a double u, or ou, as water may be resolved into"]]]
