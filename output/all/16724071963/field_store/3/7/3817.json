Oh, dear! oh, dear!\"  \"Oh, Molly, are you much hurt? shall I go for the doctor?\" asked Dick, coming to her side pale with fright. \"Mac's right here at the door, ready saddled and bridled, and----\"  \"Go for the doctor?\" interrupted Molly. \"No, indeed! It's very good in you, Dick, but I don't want him; I am going to Ion with the rest of you. I'm ready now.\"  \"You don't look much like it; you're as pale as a ghost,\" he said, Calhoun adding, \"You'd better lie still for a while, Molly; Dick or I will take you over this evening, if you find yourself able to go then.\"  \"Thank you, but I'm going now,\" she answered with decision, getting up and taking Dick's arm.  He helped her to the carriage, where Isadore, Virginia, and some of the younger ones sat waiting, and placed her in it.  She wiped away her tears and tried to smile, while answering the questions and condolences of the others, and the party moved on.  By the time Ion was reached, most of them had nearly forgotten Molly's accident, till Elsie remarked that she was looking pale, and asked if she were quite well.  That brought out the story of her fall.  Elsie heard it with grave concern but asked few questions as Molly seemed annoyed that the subject had been introduced. It was a habit of her mother's to scold her for awkwardness, and the child was sensitive on that point.  When the young people had left and the older members of the Roselands family called, Elsie seized a favorable opportunity to speak of Molly's pale looks and urge the importance of calling in a physician that if there were any reason to apprehend serious results from the fall, measures might be promptly taken to avert the danger.  \"She can't have been seriously hurt,\" returned Enna coldly, \"or she wouldn't have been ready to get into the carriage the next minute and ride over here.\"  \"By the way,\" said her father, \"I haven't heard what caused her fall.\"  \"She's an awkward child, always tumbling about,\" returned Enna reddening.  \"Especially since she wears those fashionable boots with the high narrow heels,\" he remarked. \"Had she them on when she fell?\"  Enna reluctantly admitted that such was the fact.  \"I'll send them into town to-day, with orders that full half the heel shall be taken off,\" he said with angry decision.     CHAPTER THIRD.                        \"'Tis a goodly scene--     Yon river, like a silvery snake, lays out     His coil i' the sunshine lovingly.\"                                 --HUNT.   The family at Ion presently fell into the old routine of study, work and play, Elsie resuming the duties of governess; but as the heated term drew on, she and the little ones, especially the babe, began to droop.  \"You must go north for the summer,\" said Dr. Barton, \"start as soon as possible and don't return till October.\"  \"Would you recommend the seashore?\" asked Mr. Travilla.  \"H'm! that might answer very well, but mountain air would, I think, be better.\"  \"Oh then, mamma!\" cried Vi, who was present and had been an eager but hitherto silent listener, \"won't you accept Aunt Lucy's invitation?\"  \"Perhaps, daughter,\" Elsie said smiling indulgently into the bright little face, \"but we will take time to consider what will be best.\"  \"Where is that?\" asked the doctor, \"Lucy Ross, I suppose, but I've forgotten where they live.\"  \"On the banks of the Hudson a few miles south of Newburgh. The Crags they call their place, and a beautiful one it is. 'Twas only yesterday I received a letter from Lucy, urging us to come and spend the summer with her.\"  \"I should say go by all means,\" said the doctor, taking leave.  There were reasons for hesitation on the part of the careful parents of which the physician knew nothing. The young Rosses, all unused to control, were a willful set not likely to exert a beneficial influence over other children; that was the demur.  However the final decision was in favor of the visit, and a few days later they set out upon their journey; Mr. Horace Dinsmore taking charge of them, as business made it inconvenient for Mr. Travilla to leave just at that time.  From New York they passed up the Hudson in a steamboat; the carriage from the Crags was found in waiting at the landing, and a short drive brought them to the house, which stood high up above the river, in the midst of magnificent mountain scenery.  The Ion children, taught from early infancy to notice the beauties of nature, were in ecstasies of delight, exclaiming anew at every turn in the road, calling each other's, mamma's or grandpa's attention to the sparkling river, the changing shadows on the mountainsides, here a beetling crag, there a waterfall or secluded glen. Having rested the previous night, sleeping soundly at a hotel, they were not wearied with travel but seemed fresher now than when they left their home.  Lucy and her little flock, gathered on the front porch to receive their guests, gave them a warm welcome. The two ladies had lost none of the affection for each other which had been one of the happinesses of their childhood and early youth, and each loved the children of the other for the mother's sake if not for their own. They numbered the same, but Sophie, Lucy's youngest, was now in her fifth year, and Baby Lily was greeted with many expressions and demonstrations of delight.  Lucy excused her husband's absence: he was away on business, she said, but would be at home before night.  \"Where's Phil?\" asked Eddie, turning to Gertrude.  \"Oh, he's at boarding-school, don't you know?\" she answered. \"He'll be home in vacation; but that doesn't begin for two weeks yet.\"  Mr. Dinsmore tarried for a few days, then returned to the neighborhood of Philadelphia, where he had left his wife and Rosie, who were visiting their northern relatives.  Miss Fisk was still governess at the Crags, and when the children had had a week of play together, it was thought best by the mammas, that two hours of each morning should be devoted to lessons.  Knowing Miss Fisk to be not only well educated and refined, but also a conscientious and good woman, Elsie was willing to entrust her children to her care; the more so, because Lily in her feeble state, required much of her own time and attention.  In the midst of a beautiful grove of oaks and maples, on the side of a hill, scarce more than a stone's throw from the mansion, and within full view of its windows, stood a small brick building owned by Mr. Ross, and used as a summer schoolroom for the children.  It was a cool shady spot, enlivened by the songs of the wild birds who built their nests in the trees, and the musical tinkle of a little waterfall that came tumbling down from the heights above not half-a-dozen yards from the door.  Mr. Ross had furnished the room with comfortable and convenient chairs and desks, and Lucy had made it pretty and tasteful with white muslin curtains and neatly papered walls of a soft neutral tint, enlivened by a few gayly colored pictures. Woodwork and floor were stained a rich dark brown, bright soft rugs were scattered here and there; and altogether the place was as inviting as a lady's parlor.  The Ion children were well content to spend here two or three hours of that part of the day when the sun was too hot for them to be exposed to his rays with safety and comfort: the others found lessons made much more agreeable by the companionship of their young guests, and Miss Fisk was glad to take them under her charge, because by their intelligence they added greatly to the interest of her work, while their respectful obedient behavior exerted an excellent influence upon her other pupils.  Before leaving home, Elsie, after careful and prayerful consideration, thought it best to have a plain talk with her older children about the temptations that were likely to assail them during their visit to the Crags.  They had had some past experience of the ways of Lucy's children, and she knew they had not forgotten it; and reminding them of the Bible declaration, that \"evil communications corrupt good manners,\" she bade them, while refraining as far as possible from judging their little friends, at the same time to carefully avoid following their example in anything they knew to be wrong.  \"Mamma,\" said Vi, \"perhaps sometimes we mightn't know if it was wrong!\"  \"I think you will, daughter, if you take a moment to think; and if you are doubtful, you may be pretty sure it is wrong.\"  \"Mamma, we mustn't tell tales to you?\"  \"No, dear; but perhaps you can consult me without that; and do not forget that you can always lift up your heart to God for help to know and do the right.\"  \"Yes, mamma,\" returned the little girl thoughtfully, \"and I do believe Elsie will 'most always be there and know what's right.\"  \"I'm not sure,\" said her sister, with a grave shake of the head, \"I wish we could always have mamma by to tell us.\"  \"But mamma cannot be with you always, darlings,\" Elsie said, regarding them with yearning tenderness, \"and so, as your papa and I have often told you, you must learn to think and decide for yourselves; about some things now, and about others as you grow older and wiser. Some things the Bible tells us plainly, and in regard to those we have nothing to do but obey.\"     CHAPTER FOURTH.      \"A child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.\"                                       --PROVERBS xxix. 15.   Lucy, too, had a talk with her children, in which she begged them quite pathetically, not to disgrace her before the expected guests, Mr. Dinsmore especially, who was so very strict in his ideas of how children ought to be brought up, and how they should behave.  They promised readily enough to \"behave splendidly\" and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14875"],["title","Elsie's children (#3)"],["body"," a few days did so astonishingly well that, as she laughingly said, \"she began to grow frightened lest they were becoming too good to live.\"  But she need not have been alarmed; the reaction was not long in coming and was sufficient to relieve all apprehension that they were in immediate danger from an overplus of goodness.  It began on the morning after Mr. Dinsmore's departure. Gertrude was late to breakfast, and when reproved by her mother answered in a manner so disrespectful as to quite astonish the young Travillas. They expected to see her banished at once from the table and the room; but her mother only looked grave and said in a tone of displeasure, \"Gertrude, I cannot have you speak to me in that way--Don't do it again.\"  \"I don't care; you needn't scold so about every little trifle then,\" muttered the delinquent in an undertone, pulling the dish of meat toward her, helping herself and spilling the gravy on the clean tablecloth.  Mrs. Ross did not seem to hear, she was spreading a piece of bread with the sweetest and freshest of butter, for Sophie.  \"I don't want it, I want waffles!\" screamed the child, snatching up the bread the instant it was laid on her plate, and dashing it on to the carpet.  \"You are not well this morning, dear, and mamma thinks waffles might make her darling worse,\" said Lucy in a soothing tone. \"Come now be a good baby, and eat the bread. Shall mamma spread another piece?\"  \"No, no, naughty mamma! I'll jus' frow it on the floor if you do,\" cried the child, bursting into angry sobs.  \"Shall mamma have some toast made for her?\" (coaxingly).  \"No, no! waffles! and butter on waffles, and 'lasses on butter, and sugar on 'lasses!\"  The mother laughed. It seemed to irritate the child still further; and she screamed louder than ever, slid down from her chair and stamped her foot with rage.  Mrs. Ross was deeply mortified at the exhibition. \"Pick her up and carry her to the nursery,\" she said to a servant.  Sophie kicked and struggled, but the girl,--a strong and determined one--carried her away by main force.  \"I'm dreadfully ashamed of her, Elsie,\" Lucy said, turning to her friend; \"but she's a nervous little creature and we must try to excuse her.\"  \"A few hearty slaps would reverse the nervous currents and do her an immense amount of good, Mrs. Ross,\" remarked the governess in her slow, precise way.  \"Slaps, Miss Fisk,\" returned Lucy reddening, \"_I_ don't approve of corporal punishment, as _I_ have told you more than once. I was never whipped, and I don't intend that any of my children shall be.\"  \"Most assuredly not, madam; but I was recommending it not as a punishment for disobedience or ill temper, but simply as a remedial agent. I have never experienced anything of the kind myself, Mrs. Ross, but have heard it remarked that nervousness occasions greater suffering than what is generally understood by the term pain; therefore I suggested it as I should the amputation of a diseased member when necessary in order to preserve life.\"  \"Permit me to remark,\" returned Lucy, \"that unmasked advice is seldom acceptable, and now a truce to discussion, if you please. My dear Elsie,\" turning to Mrs. Travilla, \"I beg you to excuse our ill-manners. It strikes me that none of us are behaving quite as we ought this morning. Hal and Archie, what's wrong between you now?\" For the two boys, seated side by side, were scowling at each other, and muttering angrily half under their breath.  \"Why, ma, he went and took the very piece of meat I just said I was going to have,\" whimpered Archie, digging his fists into his eyes.  \"Well, I don't care,\" retorted Harry, \"I'd as good a right as you, and I was ready first.\"  \"Give him a part of it, can't you?\" said his mother.  \"'Tain't more'n I want myself.\"  \"I won't have it after it's been on his plate,\" exclaimed both together.  \"Boys, I'm ashamed of you!\" said Lucy, \"I wish your father were here to keep you straight. You don't dare behave so before him. I'm sure your little friends would never act so. Don't you see how your naughtiness astonishes them? Vi, would you talk to your mamma as my children do to me?\"  The large blue eyes opened wide upon the questioner in half incredulous, reproachful surprise, then turned upon the beautiful, gentle face of Mrs. Travilla with an expression of ardent affection mingled with admiration and respect. \"O Aunt Lucy! could you b'lieve I'd do that to my mamma?\"  The very thought of so wounding that tender mother heart was evidently so full of pain to the little one, that Elsie could not refrain from responding to the appeal, \"Mamma knows you would not, darling.\"  \"Oh, no, mamma, 'cause I love you!\" cried the child, the young face growing bright with smiles.  \"Atmospheric influences have often a great deal to do with these things; do you not find it so?\" Elsie said, turning to her friend.  \"Yes, I have noticed that!\" Lucy said, catching gladly at the suggestion: \"and the air is certainly unusually oppressive this morning. I feel nervous myself. I think we'll have a gust before night.\"  The last words were spoken in an undertone, but the quick ear of Gertrude caught them. \"Then I shan't go to school,\" she announced decidedly.  \"Nonsense,\" said her mother, \"'twon't be here till afternoon; probably not till night, if at all.\"  \"Now, ma, you're just saying that. Aunt Elsie, do you really think it won't come soon?\"  Glancing through the open window at the mountains and the sky, Elsie answered that she saw no present indications of a storm; there was nothing to betoken it but the heat and closeness of the air.  \"Are you afraid of thunder, Aunt Elsie?\" asked Harry.  \"Lightning, you silly boy,\" corrected Gertrude, \"nobody's afraid of thunder.\"  \"Yes, you are,\" he retorted. \"You just ought to see, Ed, how scared she gets,\" and Harry laughed scornfully.  Gertrude was ready with an indignant retort, but her mother stopped her. \"If you are really brave, Gertrude, you can have an excellent opportunity to show it when the storm comes.\" Then to Harry, \"Let your sister alone, or I'll send you from the room.\"  The gust, a very severe one, came in the afternoon. Before it was fairly upon them, Lucy, herself pale with terror, had collected her children in a darkened room and seated them all on a feather-bed, where they remained during the storm, half stifled by the heat, the little ones clinging to their mother, hiding their heads in her lap and crying with fear.  Elsie and her children formed a different group; the mother the central figure here also, her darlings gathered closely about her, in her dressing-room--at a safe distance from the open windows--watching with awed delight, the bursting of the storm clouds over the mountain-tops, the play of the lightning, the sweep of the rain down from the heights into the valleys and river below, listening to the crash and roar of the thunder as it reverberated among the hills, one echo taking it up after another, and repeating it to the next, till it sounded like the explosions of many batteries of heavy artillery, now near at hand, now farther and farther away.  \"Mamma, isn't it grand?\" exclaimed Eddie, in one of the brief pauses in the wild uproar of the elements.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"the thunder of his power who can understand?\"  \"Is it God, mamma? does God make it?\" asked little Herbert.  \"Yes, dear; 'when he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.'\"  \"We needn't be 'f'aid, mamma?\"  \"No, darling, no; for God is our Father; He loves us and will take care of us.\"  The storm was very violent while it lasted, but soon passed away; the sun shone out, and a beautiful rainbow spanned the eastern sky above the mountain-tops.  Elsie's children clapped their hands in ecstasy, and ran to call their little friends to enjoy the sight with them. Mrs. Ross followed, looking so pale and exhausted, that Elsie inquired with concern if she were ill.  \"Oh, it was the storm!\" she said, \"wasn't it fearful? I was sure the house would be struck and some of us killed. Weren't you frightened?\"  \"No,\" Elsie said, with a kindly reassuring smile, \"I presume my nerves are stronger than yours, and I am not naturally timid in regard to thunder and lightning. Besides, I know so well that he who guides and controls it is my Father and my Friend. Come, look at his bow of promise.\"  The children were in a group about the window, gazing and admiring.  \"Let's ask mamma for the story of it,\" Vi was saying.  \"The story of it?\" repeated Archie Ross.  \"Yes; don't you know? about Noah and the flood.\"  \"I never heard it.\"  \"Oh, Archie, it's in the Bible; grandma told it to us once,\" exclaimed his sister Gertrude.  \"I didn't hear it, anyhow,\" persisted the boy, \"do, Vi, coax Aunt Elsie to tell it.\"  The petition was readily granted. Mrs. Travilla was an inimitable story-teller, and Lucy, whose knowledge of Scripture history was but superficial, listened to the narrative with almost as much interest and pleasure as did the children.  \"I would give anything for your talent for story-telling, Elsie,\" she said at its conclusion.  \"Oh, another! another! Please tell us another?\" cried a chorus of young voices.  Mrs. Travilla drew out her watch, and holding it up with a smile, \"Not just now, my dears,\" she said, \"see it is almost tea-time, and,\" she added playfully, \"some of us have need to change our dresses and smooth our tangled tresses.\"  \"That is true,\" said Lucy, rising hastily, \"and I expect my husband home. I must send the carriage off at once to the depot; for the train is nearly due.\"  Thereupon a cry was raised among the Rosses as they flew after their mother, \"I want to go for papa!\" \"and I!\" \"It's my turn, I say, and I will go!\" \"No, you shan't, for it's mine.\"     CHAPTER FIFTH.      \"She fed me first to God;      Her words and prayers were my young spirit's"]]]
