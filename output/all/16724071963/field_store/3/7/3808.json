WITH  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS AND EXAMPLES,  ESTIMATES OF QUANTITIES, AND VALUABLE TABLES.  Illustrated by four Plates and Thirty Figures.  BY G.B.N. TOWER,  CIVIL AND MECHANICAL ENGINEER,  _Formerly Chief Engineer U.S. Navy, and late Chandler Instructor in Civil_ _Engineering at Dartmouth College._  BOSTON:  A. WILLIAMS & COMPANY,  135 WASHINGTON STREET.  1874.    Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1874, by   A. WILLIAMS & CO.,  in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D.C.     PREFACE.   This little treatise was written for the purpose of supplying a want felt by the author while giving instruction upon the subject. It was intended for an aid to the young Engineer, and is not to be considered as a complete substitute for the more elaborate works on the subject.  The first portion of this work mentions the various strains to which beams are subjected, and gives the formulæ used in determining the amount of those strains, together with a few examples to illustrate their application, and also the method of calculating a simple truss.  The second portion names and explains the various members of a Bridge Truss, and, by means of examples, shows the method of calculating the strains upon the various timbers, bolts, etc., as well as their proper dimensions; and gives, in addition, several useful tables.  The explanatory plates, which are referred to freely throughout the work, are believed to be amply sufficient for the purpose intended.  So much has been written on this subject that it is next to impossible to be wholly original, and no claim of that nature is preferred. It is simply an arrangement of ideas, gleaned from the various works of standard authorities, and modified by the author's practice, embodied in book form. To give a correct list of all the books consulted would be simply impossible;--but it is well to state that the Hand-book of Railroad Construction, by Prof. G.L. Vose, under whom the author served as an Engineer, has been used as authority in many cases where there has been a difference of opinions among other authors. Some parts have been quoted entirely; but due credit has been given, it is believed, wherever such is the case.  It is not claimed that this little work covers the whole ground, but it is intended to describe, and explain thoroughly, three or four of the more prominent styles of Truss, leaving the other forms of Wooden Bridges to a subsequent volume.  Abutments and Piers, as well as Box and Arch Culverts, belonging more properly to masonry, will be treated of hereafter under that head.  Iron Bridges form a distinct class, and may be mentioned separately at some future period.  If this small volume should lead the student of Engineering to examine carefully the best Bridges of modern practice, and study the larger scientific works on this art, the author will feel satisfied that his efforts have not been entirely in vain.  _Cambridge, February 23, 1874._     TOWER'S  Modern American Bridge Building.     BRIDGE BUILDING   The simplest bridge that can be built, is a single beam, or stick of timber, spanning the opening between the abutments--but this is only of very limited application--(only for spans of 20 feet and less) owing to the rapid increase in sectional dimensions which is required as the span becomes greater.  Next comes the single beam supported by an inclined piece from each abutment meeting each other at the middle point of the under side of the beam--or, another arrangement, of two braces footing securely on the beam and meeting at a point above the middle point of the beam, which is suspended from the apex of the triangle formed by them, by means of an iron rod--These arrangements may be used up to 50 feet. For any span beyond 50 feet, modifications of this arrangement are used which will be described hereafter. Now let us investigate shortly the different strains that the various parts of a bridge have to bear--and the strength of the materials used. The theory of strains in bridge trusses is merely that of the Composition and Resolution of Forces. The various strains, to which the materials of a bridge are subjected--are compression, extension and detrusion.  Wood and Iron are the materials more generally employed in bridge construction--and in this pamphlet we shall take the following as the working strength of the materials--per square inch of section.               Tension.  Compression.  Detrusion.  Wood,          2000       1000          150  Wro't Iron,   15000      11000  Cast Iron,     4500      25000   =Tension.= If a weight of 2000 lbs. were hung to the lowest end of a vertical beam, so that the line of action of the weight and axis of the beam formed one and the same straight line--the tension on the beam would be 2000 lbs. But, if the beam were inclined, and the force acted in a vertical direction, then the strain would be increased in the ratio of the increase of the diagonal of inclination over the vertical;--suppose the beam is 20 ft. long and inclined at an angle of 45°--and let 2000 lbs., as before, be suspended from its lower end. Now the diagonal being 20°,--the vertical will be 14.014 ft.--and the strain will be found as follows,--    14.014 : 20 :: 2000 : 2854--lbs.  The greater the angle of inclination from the horizontal, the less the strain from a given load--and when the beam is vertical the weight causes the least strain.   =Compression.= If we load a vertical post with a weight of 2000 lbs., the strain of compression exerted upon the post will be 2000 lbs. Now, if we incline the post--the strain will be increased, as we have shown above under the head of tension, and in like manner, dependent upon the inclination.  But when wood, iron, or any other material is used for a pillar or strut, it has not only to resist a crushing force, but also a force tending to bend or bulge it laterally.  A post of circular section with a length of 7 or 8 diameters will not bulge with any force applied longitudinally, but will split. But if the length exceeds this limit--it will be destroyed by an action similar to that of a transverse strain.  A cast iron column of thirty diameters in length, is fractured by bending; when the length is less than this ratio--by bending and splitting off of wedge shaped pieces. But by casting the column hollow, and swelling it in the middle, its strength is greatly increased.  Barlow's formula for finding the weight that can be sustained by any beam, acting as a pillar or strut, before bending, is:--    WL²                    bd³ x 80 E   ---- = bd³, whence W = -----------   80 E                       L²  [TeX: $\\frac{WL^2}{80 E} = {bd^3}$, whence $W = \\frac{{bd^3} x 80 E}{L^2}$]  now, having the weight given, and assuming the dimensions of the cross-section--we shall have            -----          / WL²              WL²   d =  ³/ -----,  and b = ------       \\/  80 Eb           80 Ed³  [TeX: $d = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{WL^2}{80 EB}}$, and $b = \\frac{WL^2}{80 ED^3}$]  in the above formulæ,    W = weight in pounds.   L = length in feet.   E = a constant.   b = breadth in inches.   d = depth in inches.   =Transverse Strains.= The strain caused by any weight, applied transversely, to a beam supported at both ends, is directly as the breadth, and square of the depth, and inversely as the length. It causes the beam to be depressed towards the middle of its length, forming a curve, concave to the horizontal and below it. In assuming this form--the fibres of the upper part of the beam are compressed, and those of the lower part are extended--consequently there must be some line situated between the upper and lower surfaces of the beam where the fibers are subjected to neither of these two forces, this line is called the _neutral axis_.  These two strains of compression and extension must be equal in amount--and upon the relative strength of the material to resist these strains, as well as its form and position, the situation of this axis depends. If wood resists a compression of 1000 lbs. per square inch of section, and a tension of 2000 lbs. the axis will be twice as far from the top as from the bottom in a rectangular beam.  The following table by Mr. G.L. Vose gives, with sufficient accuracy for practice, the relative resisting powers of wood, wrought, and cast iron, with the corresponding positions of the axis.                                                   Dist. of axis                Resistance  Resistance            from top in                    to          to                frac's of   Material.    Extension.  Compression.  Ratio.  the depth.    Wrought Iron,    90          66        90/66   90/156, or 0.58.    Cast Iron,       20         111       20/111   20/131, or 0.15.    Wood,             2           1          2/1    2/3, or 0.66.   Thus we see that the resistance of a beam to a cross strain, as well as to tension and compression, is affected by the incompressibility and inextensibility of the material.  The formula for the dimensions of any beam to support a strain transversely is        4 bd²   S = ----        l  [TeX: $S = \\frac{4 bd^2}{l}$]    S = the ultimate strength in lbs.   b = the breadth in inches.   d = the depth in inches.   l = the length in inches.   =Detrusion.= Detrusion is the crushing against some fixed point, such as obtains where a brace abuts against a chord, or where a bridge rests on a bolster; and the shearing of pins, bolts and rivets, also comes under this head.   =General Abstract.= The resistance to the above mentioned strains varies as the area of the cross section; so that by doubling the area we double the strength. Any material will bear a much greater strain for a short time than for a long one. The working strength of materials, or the weight which does not injure them enough, to render them unsafe, is a mooted point, and varies, according to the authority, from 1-3 to 1-10 of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14873"],["title","Instructions on Modern American Bridge Building (#1)"],["body","ultimate strength. The ratio of the ultimate strength to the working strength is called the _factor of safety_.  The following is a table of ultimate and working strengths of materials, and factors of safety:    Weight                Ult.    Ult.   Working Strengths Factor  Safety.   in lbs.  Materials.

Barlow's experiments give the lateral adhesion of fir as 600 lbs. per square inch, and the factor of safety employed varies in practice from 4 to 6, giving a working strength of from 150 to 100 lbs. per square inch.   =TABLE OF COMPRESSIVE RESISTANCE OF TIMBER.=    Length      Safety       Length    Safety     Length    Safety   given in    Weig't in   given in   Wt. in    given in   Wt. in   Diameters.

PRACTICAL RULES.  =Tensional Strain.=    Let T = whole tensional strain.   \"   S = strength per square inch.   \"   a = sectional area in inches.   Then we have T = Sa.  Now to find the necessary sectional area for resisting any strain, we have the following general formula:         T   a = ---        S  [TeX: $a = \\frac{T}{S}$]  or, by substituting the working strengths for the various materials in the formula, we have for wood,                    a = T/2000    Wrought Iron,   a = T/1500    Cast Iron,      a = T/4500  But, in practice, cast iron is seldom used except to resist compression.  =Strains of Compression.= Allowing the same letters to denote the same things as above, we have for    Wood, a = T/1000    Wrought Iron, a = T/12000    Cast Iron, a = T/25000  As this pamphlet has to do with wooden bridges only, nothing will be said of the proper relative dimensions of cast-iron columns to sustain the strains to which they may be subjected, but a table of the strength of columns will be found further on.  =Transverse Strains.=    Let W = breaking weight in lbs.    \"  s = constant in table.    \"  b = breadth in inches.    \"  d = depth in inches.    \"  L = length in inches.  Then, for the power of a beam to resist a transverse strain, we shall have,        4 sbd²   W = ------         L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{4 sbd^2}{L}$]  This formula has been derived from experiments made by the most reliable authorities.  The constant, 1250, adopted for wood in the following formula, is an average constant, derived from the table, of those woods more commonly used.  Now to reduce the formula to the most convenient shape for use, we substitute the value of s, and we have        4 x 1250 bd²   W = ------------,            L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{4 \\times 1250 bd^2}{L}$]  or        5000 bd²   W = --------.           L   [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 bd^2}{L}$]  But, to reduce the load to the proper working strain, we must divide this equivalent by 4, the factor of safety, and we shall have        5000 bd²   W = --------.          4L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 bd^2}{4 L}$]  Let us apply the formula--    Case I. Given a span of 14 feet,                 a breadth of 8 inches,                 a depth of 14 inches.  Required the safe load.                    5000 bd²   The formula W = --------                      4L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 bd^2}{4 L}$]  becomes, by substitution,        5000 x 8 x 196   W = -------------- = 11.666 lbs.           4 x 8  [TeX: $W = \\frac{5000 \\times 8 \\times 196}{4 \\times 168} = 11,666$ lbs.]    Case II. Given the safety load 18000 lbs.                  the breadth 9 inches,                  the length 14 feet.  Required the depth. From the above formula we have           -------         / W X 4L   d =  /  ------      \\/   5000 b   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt{\\frac{w \\times 4L}{5000 b}}$]  substituting           ----------------         / 18000 x 168 x 4      ------   d =  /  --------------- =   / 268.8 = 16, inches nearly.      \\/      5000 x 9       \\/   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt{\\frac{1800 \\times 168 \\times 4}{5000 \\times 9}}  = \\sqrt{268.8} = 16$]    Case III. Given the safety load 22,400 lbs.   the depth 18 inches.   the length 14 feet.  Required the breadth. Deriving b from the foregoing, we have,          W x 4L   b = ----------       5000 x d²  [TeX: $b = \\frac{W \\times 4L}{5000 \\times d^2}$]  substituting        22400 x 4 x 168   b = --------------- = 9.3 inches nearly.         5000 x 324  [TeX: $b = \\frac{22400 \\times 4 \\times 168}{5000 \\times 324} = 9.3$]  For a cast iron beam or girder--Mr. Hodgkinson found from numerous carefully conducted experiments that, by arranging the material in the form of an inverted T--thus creating a small top flange as well as the larger bottom one, the resistance was increased, per unit of section, over that of a rectangular beam, in the ratio of 40 to 23.  In this beam the areas of the top and bottom flanges are inversely proportional to the power of the iron to resist compression and extension. Mr. Hodgkinson's formula for the dimensions of his girder, is         26 ad   W = ------          L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{26 ad}{L}$]  The factor of safety being 6 for cast iron beams--the formula for the working load will be,         26 ad   W = ------         6 L  [TeX: $W = \\frac{26 ad}{6 L}$]  and, to find area of lower flange, we shall have        6 WL   a = ----       26 d  [TeX: $a = \\frac{6 WL}{26 d}$]  The general proportions of his girders are as follows:    Length,             16   Height,              1   Area Top Flange,     1.0   Area Bottom Flange,  6.1  In the above formula for cast iron beams,    W = weight in tons.   a = area in square inches of bottom flange.   d = depth in inches.   h = length in inches.  The web uniting the two flanges must be made solid--as any opening, by causing irregularity in cooling, would seriously affect the strength of the beam.  _Example._--Required the dimensions of a Hodgkinson girder--for a span of 60 feet--with a load of 10 tons in the centre.        6 x 10 x 60 x 12   a = ---------------- = 37 inches nearly.             60 x 12        26 x -------               16  [TeX: $a = \\frac{6 \\times 10 \\times 60 \\times 12}{26 \\times \\frac{60 \\times 12}{16}} = 37$]  and the area of the top flange will be,    37   -- = 6.16 inches--   6  [TeX: $\\frac{37}{6} = 6.16$]  so that our dimensions will be as follows:    Length,              30 feet.   Depth,               45 inches.   Area Top Flange,      6.16 inches.   Area Bottom Flange,  37 inches.  [Illustration: Pl. 1.]  The thickness of web is usually a little greater at the bottom than at the top, and varies from 1/14 to 1/24 of the depth of the girder. The bottom rib is usually made from six to eight times as wide as it is thick, and the top rib from three to six times as wide as thick, so that, in the example above given, we could have as dimensions for the parts    Top Flange,     4 1/4 x 1 1/2 inches nearly.   Bottom Flange,  6 x 2 1/2 inches nearly.   Web,            1 1/2 inches thick.  The simplest bridge, consisting of a single stick, to span openings of 20 feet and under, is calculated according to the formula            ------          /  4WL   d =   / ------ --       \\/  5000 b   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 WL}{5000 b}}$]  _Example._--The depth of a beam, of 12 feet span and 12 feet wide, to support a load of 22400 lbs. will be            ------       --------------------          / 4WL        / 4 X 22400 x 12 x 12      -------   d =   / ------ =   /  ------------------- =   / 215.04 = 15 in. nearly       \\/  5000 b   \\/        5000 x 12        \\/   [TeX: $d = \\sqrt\\frac{4 WL}{5000 b}} = \\sqrt\\frac{4 \\times 22400 \\times 12 \\times 12}{5000 \\times 12} = \\sqrt{215.04} = 15$]  The following Table was calculated by the above rule--and the dimensions altered according to the actual practice of the writer.    Span.  Breadth.  Depth.      4       10       12     6       10       12     8       12       12    10       12       13    12       12       15    16       12       18    18       12       20    20       12       22  These dimensions will give ample strength and stiffness. Fig. 1, Plate I. gives an illustration of this kind of bridge--in which a, a, are the bolsters or wall plates, shown in section, to which the bridge beams are notched and bolted. Fig. 1, A, Plate I, shows the method of diagonally bracing these beams by planks, dimensions of which in general use are 6 to 8 by 2 to 3 inches. The track should rest on ties, about 6 inches by 8 or 10 inches--the same bolt confining the ends of the ties and diagonal braces when practicable. These ties should be notched on the string pieces 2 or 3 inches--without cutting "]]]
