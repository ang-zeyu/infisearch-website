All day beneath the ruins of Donn' Anna gaunt and black,     The boats of fisher-folk go by with song and trailing net;   And dim the cloud of Capri where the red feluccas tack--     But still the belching funnels smirch the trail I can't forget.    Virgil's tomb gapes empty where the oranges are bright,     Above the Roman corridors that goats and beggars tread;   Soft voices and thin music and laughter all the night--     I only see a thousand leagues the Channel lights burn red;    I only hear dear English tongues forever calling me,     Across the high white English cliffs and flowers of the foam;   I only breathe sweet lilac bloom a-blowing out to sea--     A-blowing down the long sea-lanes to lead a lover home!     The Changing Year    Summer, autumn, winter, spring--   Back and forth the seasons swing;     Sun and snows returning ever,   Like the wild geese on the wing.    When the clean sap climbs the tree,   When the strong winds groan and flee--     Dance the daisies on the hill-tops   To the thin tune of the bee.    When the golden noons hang still,   Crimson flames run down the hill,     And the musk-rats in the bayou   Feel the waters growing chill.    Wood-smoke mists the naked moor;   Dead leaves shroud the forest floor;     When the white frosts cross the threshold,   Summer softly shuts the door.    Like cold love and empty pain,   Fades the sun and drifts the rain.     Tips the world and slips the season,   Swinging wide the doors again.     Runners of the Rain    Gaunt and black the naked pines are scrawled across the sky;     The wild wet winds are clinging where the hard peaks lift and soar;   They watch our long gray hosts of rain forever marching by,     While up through all the canyons we send our sullen roar.    From every sodden meadow we've trodden out the sun;     We've ground the pale green stalks of grass              that lifted through the hills;   Across the yelping torrents a thousand feet have run,     Till waters scream in anger and the wide-mouthed valley fills.    Among the moaning spruces we threshed our heedless way;     And out upon the barrens where the lonely spaces hide,   We stamped the miles of mosses and blackened out the day,     And waked the awful silence where all the winds have died.    The stars flamed brave before us and the greater light hung still     When the white smoke of our breath blew up           and drowned the hollow night.   We crushed them out beneath our feet and leapt from hill to hill,     Till east to east the sweep of space was rocking with our flight.    The little walls of man uprose like shields beneath our feet;     We beat upon their hollow cells a million shafts of rain;   Our wild song of freedom was loud in every street,     While down along the slimy wharves the great ships lift and strain.    The dawn pushed pale thin fingers above the flattened sea,     Groping blind white fingers that clawed the shroud of night;   'Till from the straining eddies the pale forms turned to flee,     And a million tongues of madness rose singing through the fight.    Across the quaking marshes we turned and wandered back;     The trapper in the clearing heard the wan thin hosts of rain.   We moved between the steaming trails where all the woods dripped black,     And high among the empty hills we pitched our tents again.     Spring Madness    I stoop and tear the sandals from my feet   While the green fires glimmer in the gloom;   The hot roar of madness   Swells my veins with gladness;   I smell the rotting wood-stuff   And the drift of willow-bloom,   And the moon's wet face   Lifts above the place   Till gaunt and black the shadows are crowding close for room.    The alder thickets brush against my limbs;   The heavy tramp of water shakes the night;   I cross the naked hills,   Where the thin dawn lifts and fills;   All the black woods wail behind me--   They cannot stay my flight   Till the sun's red stain   Dyes the world again   And winds beyond the heavens are dancing in the light.     One Morning when the Rain-Birds Call    The snows have joined the little streams and slid into the sea;     The mountain sides are damp and black and steaming in the sun;   But Spring, who should be with us now, is waiting timidly     For Winter to unbar the gates and let the rivers run.    It matters not how green the grass is lifting through the mold,     How strong the sap is climbing out to every naked bough,   That in the towns the market-stalls are bright with jonquil gold,     And over marsh and meadowland the frogs are fluting now.    For still the waters groan and grind beneath the icy floor,     And still the winds are hungry-cold that leave the valley's mouth.   Expectantly each day we wait to hear the sullen roar.     And see the blind and broken herd retreating to the south.    One morning when the rain-birds call across the singing rills,     And the maple buds like tiny flames shine red among the green,   The ice will burst asunder and go pounding through the hills--     An endless gray procession with the yellow flood between,    Then the Spring will no more linger, but come with joyous shout,     With music in the city squares and laughter down the lane;   The thrush will pipe at twilight to draw the blossoms out,     And the vanguard of the summer host will camp with us again.     Spring's Singing      Spring once more is here--     Joyous, sweet, and clear--   Singing down the leafless aisles     To the budding year.      Her chanting is the thrush     Through the twilight hush,   And the silver tongues of waters     Where the willows blush;      Stir of lifting heads     Over violet beds;   Piping of the first glad robin     Through the greens and reds;      Croak of sullen crows     When the south wind blows,   Sighing in the shaggy spruces     Wet with melted snows;      Whisper of the rain     Down the hills again,   And the heavy feet of waters     Tramping on the plain.      Now the Goddess Spring     Makes the woodlands ring,   Bringing with a hundred voices     Joy to everything.     The Flutes of the Frogs    'Tis not the notes of the homing birds through the first warm April rain,   Or the scarlet buds and the rising green come back to the land again,   That stirs my heart from its winter sleep to pulse to the old refrain;    But when from the miles of bubbling marsh and           the valley's steaming floor,   Shrilling keen with a million flutes the ancient spring-time lore,   I hear the myriad emerald frogs awake in the world once more.    All day when the clouds drive overhead and the shadows run below,   Crossing the wind-swept pasture lots where the thin, red willows glow,   There's not a throat in the joyous host that does not swell and blow.    And all night long to the march of stars the wild mad music thrills,   Voicing the birth of the glad wet spring in a thousand stops and trills,   Till the pale sun lifts through the rosy mists           and floats from the harbour hills.     Miss Pixie    _Did you ever meet Miss Pixie of the Spruces?     Did you ever glimpse her mocking elfin face?   Did you ever hear her calling while the whip-poor-wills were calling,     And slipped your pack and taken up the chase?_    Her feet are clad in moccasins and beads.     Her dress?  Oh, next to nothing.  Though undressed,   Her slender arms are circled round with vine     And dusky locks cling close about her breast.    Red berries droop below each pointed ear;     Her nut-brown legs are criss-crossed white with scratches;   Her merry laughter sifts among the pines;     Her eager face gleams pale from milk-weed patches.    And though I never yet have reached her hand--     God knows I've tried with all my heart's desire;--   One morning just at dawn she caught me sleeping     And with her soft lips touched my soul with fire.    And once when camping near a foaming rip,     Lying wide-eyed beneath the milky stars,   Sudden I heard her voice ring sweet and clear,     Calling my soul beyond the river bars.    Dear, dancing Pixie of the wind and weather,     Aglow with love and merriment and sun,   I chase thee down my dreams, but catch thee never--     God grant I catch thee ere the trail is done!    _Did you ever meet Miss Pixie of the Thickets,     Where the scarlet leaves leap tinkling from your feet?   Have you ever heard her calling while a million feet were falling,     And a million lights were crowding all the street?_     A-Fishing    Now is the time for the luring fly   Spring is awake and the waters high,   Hackle and Doctor and Montreal,   Bend to your cast that a king may die.    Armed with a gaff and a clicking reel,   High jack-boots and an empty creel,   A yard of gut, a split bamboo,   Beginner's luck and a fisherman's zeal.    Over the hills at the rise of day,   Through a sea of mist when the world is grey   I hie me down to the river's bend,   Where the shadows gloom and the ripples play.    Then all the length of an afternoon,   The light reel sings to a thrilling tune,   Till the basket sags with the speckled trout,   And I wander home by an April moon.     The Berry Pickers    When summer winds like scented waves bear fluffy flakes           of cruising seeds,   Above the stems of tawny grass and pale white wreaths of flowered weeds,   And berries splash their scarlet stains across the dipping hills of sun,   Their laughter lifts like silver bells and tinkling echoes sweetly run.    Their faces far below the crests of rippling gold and shadowed green,   They hear the dreams of drowsy bees and watch those buccaneers unseen   Cling yellow to the clover masts and trailing ropes of wild blue pea,   And breathe the brine of daisy froth that drifts           between the walls of sea.    Their fingers pluck the glowing fruit, their lips and cheeks           are smeared and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14782"],["title","England over Seas (#2)"],["body","d;   Their snowy bonnets brush the grass like lifting top-sails on a tide;   And when their little pails brim red and rosy hands will hold no more,   They steer long shadows down the waves that float           their tired feet to shore.     The Wood Trail    Down between the branches drops a low, soft wind.     Where the narrow trail begins there start I.   Yellow sun and shadow are spinning gold behind,     Long brakes are clutching as my knees brush by.    Hidden glades are pink with the twin linnaea,     Sweet with scented fronds and the warm, wet fern;   Flute the far-off rain-birds sad and clear,     Flash the pigeon blossoms at each sharp turn.    Pungent breathe the balsams by the stream's low banks;     Rotting wood and violets lie side by side;   Glows the scarlet fungus through the alder ranks,     Burning like a light on a still, green tide.    Hilltops bid me linger where the winds run cool;     Hollows hold my feet in the deep, black loam,   But marking purple shadows in the purring pool,     I lift my silent feet on the long trail home.     The Fruit-Rancher    He sees the rosy apples cling like flowers to the bough;     He plucks the purple plums and spills the cherries on the grass;   He wanted peace and silence,--God gives him plenty now,--     His feet upon the mountain and his shadow on the pass.    He built himself a cabin from red cedars of his own;     He blasted out the stumps and twitched the boulders from the soil;   And with an axe and chisel he fashioned out a throne     Where he might dine in grandeur off the first-fruits of his toil.    His orchard is a treasure-house alive with song and sun,     Where currants ripe as rubies gleam and golden pippins glow;   His servants are the wind and rain whose work is never done,     Till winter rends the scarlet roof and banks the halls with snow.    He shouts across the valley, and the ranges answer back;     His brushwood smoke at evening lifts a column to the moon;   And dim beyond the distance, where the Kootenai winds black,     He hears the silence shattered by the laughter of the loon.     From Exile    Call to me, call to me, fields of poppied wheat!     Purple thistles by the road call me to return!   Now a thousand shriller throats echo down the street,     And I cannot hear the wind camping in the fern.    Little leaves beside the trail dance your way to town,     Till you find your brother here who remembers yet;   For though a river runs between and the bridge is down,     I've a heart that's roaming and a soul that won't forget.    A sun squats on the house-tops, but his face is hard and dry;     A rain walks up and down the streets, but her voice is harsh--   Sunlight is a different thing where the swallows fly,     And rain-tongues sing with sweeter voice when they're on the marsh.    Once a thousand bending blades stoop to let me pass,     When I sped barefooted through your crowding lines--   Whisper to me gently in the language of the grass,     How I watched the crows of night nest among the pines.    Still the golden pollen smokes, silver runs the rain,     Still the timid mists creep out when the sun lies down--   Oh, I am weary waiting to return to you again,     So take a pale, familiar face out beyond the town.     The Warm Green Sea    The winds run warm on the waves of the grass           that lifts like a scented sea.   No sound of the surf, no sob of the tides;           but the drone of the drowsy bee   Is drawing me out from the purple shades           to wade in the daffodils,   Where the long green billows go drifting by           to lap the feet of the hills.    Like the snow-white spume on the shattered waves           the daisies twist and cream,   Over their heads in a painted mist the myriad           insects gleam.   And the still sea sways in the sun's soft breath           and breaks on the green, green sand,   Till I bare my limbs to the noiseless surf           and wade from the silent land.    The pale stalks eddy from knee to waist and rise           to my sun-flecked face;   Cool on my lips is the daisy foam and the spray           of the Queen Anne's lace.   With half-shut eyes and outstretched arms I swim           through the scented heat.   Oh, never were broad sea winds so warm,           nor Southern seas so sweet?     There's Music in My Heart To-day    There's music in my heart to-day;     The Master-hand is on the keys,   Calling me up to the windy hills     And down to the purple seas.    Let Time draw back when I hear that tune--     Old to the soul when the stars were new--   And swing the doors to the four great winds,     That my feet may wander through.    North or South, and East or West;     Over the rim with the bellied sails,   From the mountain's feet to the empty plains,     Or down the silent trails--    It matters not which door you choose;     The same clear tune blows through them all,   Though one harp leaps to the grind of seas     And one to the rain-bird's call.    However you hide in the city's din     And drown your ears with its siren songs,   Some day steal in those thin, wild notes,     And you leave the foolish throngs.    God grant that the day will find me not     When the tune shall mellow and thrill in vain--   So long as the plains are red with sun,     And the woods are black with rain.     August on the River      The swooning heat of August       Swims along the valley's bed.     The tall reeds burn and blacken,       While the gray elm droops its head,   And the smoky sun above the hills is glaring             hot and red.      Along the shrinking river,       Where the salmon-nets hang brown,     Piles the driftwood of the freshets,       And the naked logs move down   To the clanking chains and shrieking saws             of the mills above the town.      Outside the booms of cedar,       The fish-hawks drop at noon;     When night comes trailing up the stars,       We hear the ghostly loon;   And watch the herons swing their flight             against the crimson moon.     The Wind Tongues    I wandered in the woodlands where the red glades begin,   And a wind in every tree-top was talking small and thin:   \"The dead hand of Winter is knocking at the door,   And the white froth of flowers will float no more.    \"The gray ranks of grasses are bared of their bees,   Their voices sound like falling spume between the leaden seas;   We hear beyond the alders where the long swamps lie   The creak of broken rushes and the last snipe's cry.\"    And I marked the poignant sorrow in each high tree tongue,   Conferring there above me where the blue moss hung;   Till anguish grew from far away and broke in sullen roar,   As when a smoking surf meets a rock-ribbed shore.     Musk-Rats    When the mists move down from the barren hill,   To roll where the waters are black and chill,   When the moonlight gleams on the lily-pads   And even the winds are still.    The musk-rats slip from the clammy bank,   Where the tangled reeds are long and dank,   Where the dew lies white on the iris bed,   And the rushes stand in rank.    Their black heads furrow the stagnant stream,   While the water breaks in a silver gleam,   Till it joins the reeds where the night lies hid   And the purple herons dream.    Through the mist and the moon's mysterious light   They hear the honking geese take flight,   Threshing up from the arrow-heads   As the lonely East grows white.     The Kill    Black and white the face of night,     And roar the rapids to the moon;   Dust of stars beyond the bars,     And mirthless laughter of the loon.    Swirling blades through inky shades,     And ghostly shadows slipping by;   Clogging beds of arrowheads,     And jagging spruce tops in the sky,    Rasping groans of birchen cones     Re-answering from shore to shore;   Through the hush the snapping brush--     Then silence, and the stars once more.    Mutters slow, appealing, low,     The throaty pleading of the bark;   Roar of might that rends the night--     His body bulking through the dark.    Then the white, cruel tongue of light     Leaps stinging in his startled eyes;   Red and black the night falls back,     The rocking echo drifts and dies.     On the Marshes    Out on the marsh in the misty rain,   The air is full of the harsh refrain;   The long swamps echo the beat of wings;   The birds are back in the reeds again.    Down from the north they wing their way.   Out of the east they cross the bay.   From north and east they're steering home   To the inland ponds at the close of day.    Hid in the sea of reeds we lie,   And watch the wild geese driving by;   And listen to the plover's piping,--   The gray snipe's thin and lonely cry.    All day over the tangled mass,   The marsh-birds wheel and scream and pass.   The smoke hangs white in the broken rice.   The feathers drift in the water-grass.     The Scarlet Trails    Crimson and gold in the paling sky;   The rampikes black where they tower on high,--   And we follow the trails in the early dawn   Through the glades where the white frosts lie.    Down where the flaming maples meet;   Where the leaves are blood before our feet   We follow the lure of the twisting paths   While the air tastes thin and sweet    Leggings and jackets are drenched with dew   The long twin barrels are cold and blue;   But the glow of the Autumn burns in our veins,   And our eyes and hands are true.    Where the sun drifts down from overhead   (Tangled gleams in the scarlet bed),   Rush of wings through the forest aisle--   And the leaves are a brighter red.    Loud drum the cocks in the thickets nigh;   Gray is the smoke where the ruffed grouse die.   There's blackened shell in the trampled fern   When the white moon swims the sky.     At the Year's End    The plowed field sinks in the drifting snows.   The last gray feather to southward goes.   Rattle the reeds in the frozen swamp,   When the lonely north-wind blows.    The harrow and sickle are laid away.   The"]]]
