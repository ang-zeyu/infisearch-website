Perhaps we can get out and pick some wild flowers or wade in a brook.\"  \"Not to-day,\" said her father, \"but some days you may do that to your heart's content. The whole trip is going to be just one long picnic, and we're going to get all the fun out of it we possibly can.\"  \"I think it's delicious,\" said Kitty, in her quiet way; \"I think it's fun enough just to glide along like this, with the blue sky shining all over us, and the trees waving their boughs at us, and even the fences jig-jigging along at our side.\"  \"You're so poetical, Kitty,\" said Marjorie; \"I love the blue sky and the green trees too, but just now I want to see a red apple and a brown ginger-snap!\"  \"Midget, I believe you could eat at any time,\" said her mother, laughing.  \"Yes, I could,\" said Midget, contentedly, \"'cept when I've just had enough. And I do feel like eating, but I feel like singing, too.\"  \"You can't do both at once,\" said her brother.  \"No, but I can do first one and then the other. Now I'll tell you, Father, what to do. You make a little song for us, while I eat this apple. A kind of a little motor song, you know.\"  So while Marjorie ate her apple, and the other children engaged in the same pursuit, Mr. Maynard made a little song for them.  This was a favorite game of the Maynards. Father Maynard had a knack of turning off verses, and they usually sang them to some well-known air, or perhaps made up a little crooning tune of their own.  So when the apples were finished and the cores flung away, Mr. Maynard lined out his little song, and the children quickly learned it.  After two or three attempts they were able to sing it correctly, and they stowed it away in their memory as one of their favorite songs, and at intervals throughout the day their young voices filled the air with these sentiments:  \"Very happy the Maynards are; Taking a tour in their motor car Gaily to Grandma's lickety-split Marjorie, Rosamond, Kingdon, and Kit Mothery, fathery, also along,-- Gaily we sing our motor car song!     Hooray, hooray!     For our holiday May for the Maynards!     Maynards for May!\"     CHAPTER IV  VISITING A CAMP   Rockwell was soon left far behind, and the Maynards' car flew along the country road, now passing through a bit of woods, and now through a little town, or again crossing a picturesque brook.  The children were delighted with the new experience, and chatted all at once, about the roadside sights.  Pompton, the English chauffeur, though he said little or nothing, was secretly amazed at the gaiety and volubility of the young people. The children were allowed to take turns sitting in the front seat, and, as was their nature, they talked rapidly and steadily to the somewhat taciturn driver.  \"What a funny name you have, Pompton,\" said Marjorie, as she sat beside him; \"at least it seems funny to me, because I never heard it before.\"  \"It's a good old English name, Miss,\" he returned, a little gruffly, \"and never been dishonored, as I know of.\"  \"Oh, I think it's a very nice name,\" said Marjorie, quickly, for she had had no intention of being unpleasantly critical, \"only I think it's a funny name. You see Pompton sounds so much like pumpkin.\"  \"Do you think so, Miss?\"  \"Oh, well, it doesn't matter about a name, anyway. Tell me about your people. Have you any little boys and girls?\"  \"No, Miss; I never was married, Miss. And I ain't overly fond of children.\"  \"Really, aren't you, Pompton? Well, you'll have to begin being fond of them, because you see, us Maynard children just can't stand anybody around who isn't fond of us. Though of course we've never tried, for everybody who has lived with us has always been terribly fond of us.\"  \"Maybe it'll be a pleasant change then, Miss, to try another sort.\" Pompton's eyes twinkled good-naturedly as he said this, and Marjorie instinctively recognized that he was trying to joke.  \"Ah, you're fond of us already, Pompton, and you needn't say you're not! It's a funny thing,\" she went on, confidentially, \"but everybody loves us Maynards,--and yet we're such a bad lot.\"  \"A bad lot, Miss?\"  \"Well, full of the old scratch, you know; always cutting up jinks. Do you know what jinks are, Pompton?\"  \"No, Miss; what are they?\"  \"Why they're just jinks; something to cut up, you know.\"  \"Cut up, Miss?\"  \"Oh, Pompton, you're just like a parrot! You just repeat what I say! Don't you know _anything_?\"  \"Very little, Miss.\"  But as they rode along, and Marjorie asked her interminable string of questions about the car, or about the trees or flowers they were passing, or about sundry roadside matters, she found that Pompton was a very well-informed man, indeed, as well as being kind and obliging in answering questions.  As they spun along a bit of straight road, Marjorie saw, some distance ahead, a girl sitting on a large stone by the roadside. The girl's face was so weary and pained-looking that Marjorie felt a sudden thrill of pity for her, and as a second glance showed that the girl was lame, she impulsively begged Pompton to stop a moment that they might speak to her.  The chauffeur turned around to see if the order were corroborated by the older people, and Mrs. Maynard said, \"Yes, Pompton, let us stop and see what the poor girl wants.\"  So the car stopped, and Marjorie impetuously jumped out, and ran to speak to the girl, who seemed ill and suffering. Mr. Maynard joined them at once, and they listened to the girl's story.  She said her name was Minnie Meyer, and that she had to walk to the neighboring town to buy some provisions for her mother. But being lame she had become so tired that she sat down to rest by the way.  \"How far have you to go, child?\" asked Mr. Maynard, kindly.  \"I have already walked a mile, sir, and it's two miles more to Pelton, where I must go. I have often walked the distance, but my foot is very bad just now, and it is hard going. I have been ill, and I am not yet very strong.\"  \"I should think not!\" exclaimed King, who had jumped out to see what was going on. \"Look here, Father, we're going directly to Pelton; it is a straight road, and I can't miss the way. You let this girl take my place in the car, and I'll walk.\"  \"Now that's good of you, King,\" said his father with an approving glance at the boy, \"for this poor child is pretty well tired out. How can you get home again, Minnie?\"  \"Oh, sir, I shall have a ride home. A neighbor of ours will take me; but I have to walk over to Pelton and get my things by the time he's ready to start.\"  \"And what time does he start for home?\"  \"About two o'clock, sir.\"  The child's face was very white, and her eyes were large and dark. Though probably no older than Marjorie, she looked careworn and troubled beyond her years.  \"You are a good boy, King,\" his mother called out from the car, \"and I think, Ed, we had better take the girl with us. Kingdon won't mind a two miles' walk, I know, when it is in such a good cause.\"  \"I'm going with King,\" announced Marjorie; \"I shan't mind the walk, either, and it will be fun for both of us to be together, while it would be awful lonesome for King all alone.\"  \"Good for you, Mopsy Midget!\" cried King, \"you're a trump! Come on, we'll get there before the car does.\" King grasped his sister's hand, and they set off merrily at a good pace along the straight road to Pelton.  Meantime, Mr. Maynard had assisted the lame girl into the car, and Kitty tucked rugs and shawls around her to make her comfortable.  Minnie Meyer was both awestruck and delighted. She had never been in an automobile before, and it had all happened so quickly she scarcely realized her good fortune.  \"I think you must all be angels,\" she said; \"and I'm sorry the young lady and gentleman have to walk so far, and all just for me.\"  \"But they're better able to walk than you are,\" said practical Kitty.  \"That may be, Miss, but it seems queer for the likes of me to be riding in their place. My! But it goes fast!\"  The car passed King and Marjorie, who waved their hands gaily, and watched it rapidly disappear along the road in front of them.  \"I'm glad we're doing a deed of charity, Midget,\" said her brother, \"for if we weren't I shouldn't relish this long walk very much.\"  \"Now, King, don't go and spoil your noble deed by growling about it! It was lovely of you to let that girl ride in your place, but if you're going to kick about walking, you'll spoil it all.\"  \"I'm not kicking. And anyway, Mops, you were the noble one yourself. You walked just so I shouldn't be lonesome.\"  \"'Course I did! What's lots of fun for two is awful poky for one. Come on, I'll race you to that big sticking-out tree!\"  They flew along the road with their heels kicking out behind, and though King reached the tree first, he was only a few steps ahead of Marjorie, who came up panting, and threw herself on the grass by his side.  \"We mustn't do that again,\" she said, \"it makes us too much out of breath, and we can't walk afterward. Now let's rest a minute, and then walk on just middling fast,--because it's a long way yet. What time do you suppose we'll get there?\"  \"Pomp said if we'd walk straight along we ought to get to the inn by half-past twelve. They won't have lunch till we get there.\"  \"You bet they won't! Do you know where the inn is?\"  \"Well, I've never been there, but when we get to Pelton I rather guess we can find the inn! Come on, Mops, if you're rested, we'd better get a move on!\"  Then they trudged on together, finding the way very pleasant, and many things to interest them as they passed along.  The road was a public highway, and there were many motor cars and much other traffic.  But as the children kept on a grassy path by the side of the road they were in no danger, and there was no possibility of losing their way.  \"It's just a matter of keeping at it,\" said King, \"but it does seem longer than I thought. We're not halfway yet.\"  \"How"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15072"],["title","Marjorie's Maytime (#5)"],["body"," you know?\"  \"'Cause Pomp said when we came to the sign-board pointing to Mossville we'd be halfway, and we haven't come to that yet.\"  \"What makes you call him Pomp?\"  \"Oh, just for short; and besides he's kind of pompous, you know,--sort of stuffy and English.\"  \"Yes, he is. I like him, though, and I think he's going to like us, but he doesn't understand us yet. I hope Father will ask that lame girl to lunch with us. I think she looked hungry.\"  \"She looked awful poor, and I s'pose poor folks are always hungry. It must be awful to be always hungry, Mops!\"  \"Well, I'm 'most always hungry myself.\"  \"Oh, that isn't real hunger; that's just wanting something to eat. Hello, here's the Mossville sign now! See it?\"  \"Yes; so now we must be halfway. I'm not tired, are you?\"  \"No, not a bit. I'd like a drink of water, though. Perhaps we'll come to a brook.\"  But they walked on considerably further without seeing any brook, or even a farmhouse where they might stop for a drink of water. But when they were about half a mile from Pelton, King saw a little bridge off toward the right, and exclaimed, \"That bridge must be over water of some sort. If you want to, Midget, we can go over and see if it's clean enough to drink.\"  \"Come on, then; it won't take long, and I'm 'most choked to death.\"  They walked across an intervening field, and came to the little bridge which did cross a small but clear and sparkling brook.  \"What can we drink out of?\" asked Midget.  \"Have to drink out of our hands, I guess; wish we had a cup or something. Oh, look at that man!\"  Midget looked in the direction King pointed, and saw a man seated on the ground, busily working at something which seemed to be made of long rushes of reeds.  \"He's making a basket,\" cried King, greatly interested. \"Let's go and look at him.\"  They trotted over to the man, and King said, politely, \"Is that a basket you're making, sir?\"  \"Yes,\" came the answer in a gruff voice, and when the man looked up at them, they saw he was a strange-looking person indeed. His complexion was dark, his coarse black hair rather long, and his black eyes had a shrewd expression, but were without kindliness. \"What do you want?\" he said, still in his gruff voice.  \"We don't want anything p'ticular,\" said Marjorie, who did not wish to be intrusive; \"we did want a drink of water out of the brook, but we had nothing to drink from, and then we saw you building a basket, and we just came over to look at you. You don't mind, do you?\"  \"No, I don't mind,\" and the man's voice was a little less gruff as he looked at Marjorie's pretty smiling face. Then he gave her another look, somewhat more scrutinizing, and then he looked again at King. \"You want a drink of water, do you?\" and the look of interest in his round black eyes seemed to become intensified. \"Well, I'll tell you what to do; you go right straight along that little path through the grass, and after a few steps, you'll find some people, and they'll give you a drink of water with pleasure, and a nice cup to drink it out of.\"  \"Is it far?\" asked Marjorie, for she couldn't see any signs of habitation, and did not wish to delay too long.  \"No; 'tain't a dozen steps. Just behind that clump of trees yonder; you can't miss it.\"  \"A farmhouse, I suppose,\" said King.  \"Well, not just exactly a farmhouse,\" said the man, \"but you go on, you youngsters, and whoever you see when you get there, tell 'em Jim sent you.\"  \"We will; and thank you, Jim,\" said Marjorie, suddenly remembering her manners.  \"You're welcome,\" said the man, and again his voice was gruff as at first.  \"Somehow I don't like it, Mops,\" said King, who had a troubled look on his face as they walked swiftly along the path indicated.  \"Don't like what?\"  \"His sending us over here. And I don't like him; he didn't look right.\"  \"I thought he was very kind to tell us about the farmhouse, and if his voice is sort of gruff, I s'pose he can't help that.\"  \"It isn't that exactly; but I think he's a,--a--\"  \"A what?\"  \"Never mind; here we are at the place. Why, Mops, it isn't a house at all! It's a tent,--a lot of tents.\"  \"So it is! It must be an encampment. Do you think there are soldiers here?\"  \"Soldiers? No! I only wish they _were_ soldiers.\"  As King was speaking, a young woman came walking toward them, smiling in an ingratiating way. Like the man, Jim, she was dark-haired and dark-skinned. Her black eyes flashed, and her smiling red lips showed very white teeth as she spoke kindly to the children.  \"Come in,\" she said, in a wheedling voice; \"come in; I love little boys and girls. What do you want?\"  Marjorie began to say, \"We want a drink of water,\" when King pinched her elbow as a sign to be quiet, and he spoke to the woman himself. \"We don't want anything,\" he said, \"we're just passing by on our way to Pelton. Good-morning.\"  Grasping Marjorie's arm he turned to go away, but the woman stopped him, saying, \"Oh, don't go so quickly; come in and rest a moment, and I will give you a drink of milk, and then you can go on to Pelton.\"  \"Yes, let's do that, King,\" said Marjorie, looking at her brother, amazed at his ungracious actions.  But King persisted in his determination. \"No, thank you,\" he said to the woman in a decided way; \"you're very kind, but we don't care for any milk, and we must go right on to Pelton.\"  \"And I say you must stay right here,\" said the woman, in much sterner tones than she had used before, and taking the children each by an arm, she pushed them ahead of her inside of the largest tent.     CHAPTER V  HELD CAPTIVE   Then King's fears were realized. He had suspected these people were gypsies, and now he discovered that they were. Inside the tent were three or four men and women, all of the dark, gypsy type, and wearing the strange, bright-colored garments characteristic of their tribe. They did not seem ill-disposed toward the visitors, but welcomed them cordially, and one of the women went at once for a pitcher of milk, and brought it, with two glasses, which she set on the table.  King was not exactly frightened, for they all seemed pleasant and kind enough, but he couldn't help remembering how gypsies were credited with the habit of stealing children, and holding them for ransom. \"But only babies,\" he thought to himself; \"I don't believe they ever steal such big kids as Marjorie and me.\"  King was fifteen, and tall for his age, and as he looked at Marjorie he realized that she was a big girl, too, and he felt sure they were beyond the age of being kidnapped. But as he noted the furtive glances which were cast at them by the gypsies, he again felt alarmed, and glanced at Marjorie to see if her thoughts were like his own.  But they were not. Marjorie was chatting gaily with the good-looking young woman who had brought her into the tent, and she was accepting an invitation to have a glass of milk and a cracker.  As an old gypsy woman poured the milk from the pitcher into the glass, she turned her back to Marjorie, but King's alert eyes could see her shaking a small portion of white powder into the milk.  Like a flash it came to King what it all meant! They were kidnappers, these wicked gypsies, and they meant to put some drug in the milk that the children drank, so they would go to sleep, and then the kidnappers would carry them away!  King thought rapidly. He couldn't let Marjorie drink that milk,--and yet if he made a fuss about it, they could easily overpower him. He determined to use strategy.  \"Let me pass the glass to my sister,\" he said, jumping up, and going to take the glass from the old woman who had poured it. Unsuspectingly, she let him take it, but as he turned, he stumbled, purposely, against the table leg, and spilled all the milk on the ground.  \"Oh, excuse me,\" he said, politely. \"Now we shall have to go without a drink of milk! But we are just as much obliged, and we bid you good-morning. Come, Midget.\"  Marjorie was at a loss to understand King's actions, but she knew her brother well enough to know that his tone and his look meant that something very serious was the matter, and she was quite ready to obey him without knowing why.  But though he grasped her arm, and endeavored to lead her out of the tent, they were suddenly stopped. Two stalwart men who had been sitting in shadow at the back of the tent came forward, and grasping the children's shoulders, pushed them back into their seats rather roughly.  \"You set down there!\" said one of the men, \"and don't you move till you're told to! We ain't decided just what to do with you yet, and when we see fit, we'll tell you, and not till then, so you just keep still!\"  Marjorie suddenly sensed the situation. These people were enemies, not friends! She understood King's efforts to get her away, and she remembered, too, his misgivings as they were on their way across the field.  Moreover, it was she who had insisted on coming, and so she felt, in a way, responsible for what had happened to them. She jumped to her feet as soon as the man let go of her shoulder, and cried, with flashing eyes, \"I will not keep still! What do you mean by treating me like that? Don't you know who I am? We're Maynards! We're Edward Maynard's children,--and everybody loves the Maynards!\"  \"Oh, they do, do they!\" said the man who had spoken before. \"Then that's a mighty good reason why we should keep you here a little while.\"  \"Keep us here!\" stormed Marjorie, not at all realizing that they were being kidnapped, but merely thinking these people were playing some sort of a joke upon them. \"Why should you keep us here? We want to go on.\"  \"You want to go on, do you?\" And the man fairly snarled at them; \"well, you can't go on, and you may as well understand that! Didn't Jim send you?\"  \"Yes, Jim sent us,\" said Marjorie, remembering what the man who was weaving the basket had said.  \"Then if Jim sent you, you're here to stay. And as it's just impossible for you to get away, there's small use in your trying! So you may as well make the"]]]
