There are syncopes somewhat harder; from tempore, time; from nomine,     name, domina, dame; as the French homme, femme, nom, from homine,     fœmina, nomine. Thus pagína, page; ποτηριον, pot; κυπελλα, cup;     cantharus, can; tentorium, tent; precor, pray; preda, prey; specio,     speculor, spy; plico, ply; implico, imply; replico, reply; complico,     comply; sedes episcopalis, see.      A vowel is also cut off in the middle, that the number of the syllables     may be lessened; as amita, aunt; spiritus, spright; debitum, debt;     dubito, doubt; comes, comitis, count; clericus, clerk; quietus, quit,     quite; acquieto, to acquit; separo, to spare; stabilis, stable;     stabulum, stable; pallacium, palace, place; rabula, rail, rawl, wrawl,     brawl, rable, brable; quæsito, quest.      As also a consonant, or at least one of a softer sound, or even a whole     syllable, rotundus, round; fragilis, frail; securus, sure; regula,     rule; tegula, tile; subtilis, subtle; nomen, noun; decanus, dean;     computo, count; subitaneus, sudden, soon; superare, to soar; periculum,     peril; mirabile, marvel; as magnus, main; dignor, deign; tingo, stain;     tinctum, taint; pingo, paint; prædari, reach.      The contractions may seem harder, where many of them meet, as κυριακος,     kyrk, church; presbyter, priest; sacristanus, sexton; frango, fregi,     break, breach; fagus, φηγα, beech, f changed into b, and g into ch,     which are letters near akin; frigesco, freeze, frigesco, fresh, sc into     sh, as above in bishop, fish, so in scapha, skiff, skip, and     refrigesco, refresh; but viresco, fresh; phlebotamus, fleam; bovina,     beef; vitulina, veal; scutifer, squire; pœnitentia, penance;     sanctuarium, sanctuary, sentry; quæsitio, chase; perquisitio, purchase;     anguilla, eel; insula, isle, ile, island, iland; insuletta, islet,     ilet, eyght, and more contractedly ey, whence Owsney, Ruley, Ely;     examinare, to scan; namely, by rejecting from the beginning and end e     and o, according to the usual manner, the remainder xamin, which the     Saxons, who did not use x, writ csamen, or scamen, is contracted into     scan: as from dominus, don; nomine, noun; abomino, ban; and indeed apum     examen; they turned into sciame; for which we say swarme, by inserting     r to denote the murmuring; thesaurus, store; sedile, stool; ‛υετος,     wet; sudo, sweat; gaudium, gay; jocus, joy; succus, juice; catena,     chain; caliga, calga; chause, chausse, French, hose; extinguo, stand,     squench, quench, stint; foras, forth; species, spice; recito, read;     adjuvo, aid; αιων, ævum, ay, age, ever; floccus, lock; excerpo, scrape,     scrabble, scrawl; extravagus, stray, straggle; collectum, clot, clutch;     colligo, coil: recolligo, recoil; severo, swear; stridulus, shrill;     procurator, proxy; pulso, to push; calamus, a quill; impetere, to     impeach; augeo, auxi, wax; and vanesco, vanui, wane; syllabare, to     spell; puteus, pit; granum, corn; comprimo, cramp, crump, crumple,     crinkle.      Some may seem harsher, yet may not be rejected, for it at least     appears, that some of them are derived from proper names, and there are     others whose etymology is acknowledged by every body; as, Alexander,     Elick, Scander, Sander, Sandy, Sanny; Elizabetha, Elizabeth, Elisabeth,     Betty, Bess; Margareta, Margaret, Marget, Meg, Peg; Maria, Mary, Mal,     Pal, Malkin, Mawkin, Mawkes; Mathæus, Mattha, Matthew; Martha, Mat,     Pat; Gulielmus, Wilhelmus, Girolamo, Guillaume, William, Will, Bill,     Wilkin, Wicken, Wicks, Weeks.      Thus cariophyllus, flos; gerofilo, Italian, giriflee, gilofer, French,     gilliflower, which the vulgar call julyflower, as if derived from the     month July; petroselinum, parsley; portulaca, purslain; cydonium,     quince; cydoniatum, quiddeny; persicum, peach; eruca, eruke, which they     corrupt to earwig, as if it took its name from the ear; annulus     geminus, a gimmal, or gimbal-ring; and thus the word gimbal or jumbal     is transferred to other things thus interwoven; quelques choses,     kickshaws. Since the origin of these, and many others, however forced,     is evident, it ought to appear no wonder to any one if the ancients     have thus disfigured many, especially as they so much affected     monosyllables; and, to make the sound the softer, took this liberty of     maiming, taking away, changing, transposing, and softening them.      But while we derive these from the Latin, I do not mean to say, that     many of them did not immediately come to us from the Saxon, Danish,     Dutch, and Teutonick languages, and other dialects; and some taken more     lately from the French or Italians, or Spaniards.      The same word, according to its different significations, often has a     different origin; as, to bear a burden, from fero; but to bear, whence     birth, born, bairn, comes from pario; and a bear, at least if it be of     Latin original, from fera. Thus perch, a fish, from perca; but perch, a     measure, from pertica, and likewise to perch. To spell is from syllaba;     but spell, an inchantment, by which it is believed that the boundaries     are so fixed in lands that none can pass them against the master's     will, from expello; and spell, a messenger, from epistola; whence     gospel, good-spell, or god-spell. Thus freese, or freeze, from     frigesco; but freeze, an architectonick word, from zophorus; but     freeze, for cloth, from Frisia, or perhaps from frigesco, as being more     fit than any other for keeping out the cold.      There are many words among us, even monosyllables, compounded of two or     more words, at least serving instead of compounds, and comprising the     signification of more words that one; as, from scrip and roll comes     scroll; from proud and dance, prance; from st of the verb stay or stand     and out, is made stout; from stout and hardy, sturdy; from sp of spit     or spew, and out, comes spout; from the same sp with the termination     in, is spin; and adding out, spin out: and from the same sp, with it,     is spit, which only differs from spout in that it is smaller, and with     less noise and force; but sputter is, because of the obscure u,     something between spit and spout: and by reason of adding r, it     intimates a frequent iteration and noise, but obscurely confused;     whereas spatter, on account of the sharper and clearer vowel a,     intimates a more distinct poise, in which it chiefly differs from     sputter. From the same sp and the termination ark, comes spark,     signifying a single emission of fire with a noise; namely sp, the     emission, ar, the more acute noise, and k, the mute consonant,     intimates its being suddenly terminated; but adding l, is made the     frequentative sparkle. The same sp, by adding r, that is spr, implies a     more lively impetus of diffusing or expanding itself; to which adding     the termination ing, it becomes spring: its vigour spr imports; its     sharpness the termination ing; and lastly in acute and tremulous,     ending in the mute consonant g, denotes the sudden ending of any     motion, that it is meant in its primary signification, of a single, not     a complicated exilition. Hence we call spring whatever has an elastick     force; as also a fountain of water, and thence the origin of any thing:     and to spring, to germinate, and spring, one of the four seasons. From     the same spr and out, is formed sprout, and wit the termination ig,     sprig; of which the following, for the most part, is the difference:     sprout, of a grosser sound, imports a fatter or grosser bud; sprig, of     a slenderer sound, denotes a smaller shoot. In like manner, from str of     the verb strive, and out, comes strout, and strut. From the same str,     and the termination uggle, is made struggle; and this gl imports, but     without any great noise, by reason of the obscure sound of the vowel u.     In like manner, from throw and roll is made troll, and almost in the     same sense is trundle, from throw or thrust, and rundle. Thus graff or     grough is compounded of grave and rough; and trudge from tread or trot,     and drudge.  In these observations it is easy to discover great sagacity and great extravagance, an ability to do much defeated by the desire of doing more than enough. It may be remarked,  1. That Wallis's derivations are often so made, that by the same license any language may be deduced from any other.  2. That he makes no distinction between words immediately derived by us from the Latin, and those which being copied from other languages, can therefore afford no example of the genius of the English language, or its laws of derivation.  3. That he derives from the Latin, often with great harshness and violence, words apparently Teutonick; and therefore, according to his own declaration, probably older than the tongue to which he refers them.  4. That some of his derivations are apparently erroneous.         *       *       *       *       *  SYNTAX.      The established practice of grammarians requires that I should here     treat of the Syntax; but our language has so little inflection, or     variety of terminations, that its construction neither requires nor     admits many rules. Wallis, therefore, has totally neglected it; and     Jonson, whose desire of following the writers upon the learned     languages made him think a syntax indispensably necessary, has     published such petty observations as were better omitted.  The verb, as in other languages, agrees with the nominative in number and person; as, Thou fliest from good; He runs to death.  Our adjectives and pronouns are invariable.  Of two substantives the noun possessive is in the genitive; as, His father's glory; The sun's heat.  Verbs transitive require an oblique case; as, He loves me; You fear him.

NOVEMBER 25, 1789.   ANECDOTES OF GOVERNOR PHILLIP.  Arthur Phillip is one of those officers, who, like Drake, Dampier, and Cook, has raised himself by his merit and his services, to distinction and command. His father was Jacob Phillip, a native of Frankfort, in Germany, who having settled in England, maintained his family and educated his son by teaching the languages. His mother was Elizabeth Breach, who married for her first husband, Captain Herbert of the navy, a kinsman of Lord Pembroke. Of her marriage with Jacob Phillip, was her son, Arthur, born in the parish of Allhallows, Bread-street, within the city of London, on the 11th of October, 1738.  Being designed for a seafaring life, he was very properly sent to the school of Greenwich, where he received an education suitable to his early propensities. At the age of sixteen, he began his maritime career, under the deceased Captain Michael Everet of the navy, at the commencement of hostilities, in 1755: and at the same time that he learned the rudiments of his profession under that able officer, he partook with him in the early misfortunes, and subsequent glories of the seven years war. Whatever opulence Phillip acquired from the capture of the Havannah, certain it is, that, at the age of twenty-three, he there was made a Lieutenant into the Stirling-castle, on the 7th of June, 1761, by Sir George Pococke, an excellent judge of naval accomplishments.  But of nautical exploits, however they may raise marine officers, there must be an end. Peace, with its blessings, was restored in 1763. And Phillip now found leisure to marry; and to settle at Lyndhurst, in the New Forest, where he amused himself with farming, and like other country gentlemen, discharged assiduously those provincial offices, which, however unimportant, occupy respectably the owners of land, who, in this island, require no office to make them important.  But sailors, like their own element, are seldom at rest. Those occupations, which pleased Phillip while they were new, no longer pleased him when they became familiar. And he hastened to offer his skill and his services to Portugal when it engaged in warfare with Spain. His offer was readily accepted, because such skill and services were necessary amidst an arduous struggle with a too powerful opponent. And, such was his conduct and such his success, that when the recent interference of France, in 1778, made it his duty to fight for his king, and to defend his country, the Portugueze court regretted his departure, but applauded his motive.  His return was doubtless approved by those who, knowing his value, could advance his rank: For he was made master and commander into the Basilisk fireship, on the 2d of September, 1779. But in her he had little opportunity of displaying his zeal, or of adding to his fame. This step, however, led him up to a higher situation; and he was made post-captain into the Ariadne frigate, on the 13th of November, 1781, when he was upwards of three and forty. This is the great epoch in the lives of our naval officers, because it is from this that they date their rank. In the Ariadne, he had little time for active adventures, or for gainful prizes, being appointed to the Europe of sixty-four guns, on the 23d of December, 1781. During the memorable year 1782, Phillip promoted its enterprises, and shared in its glories. And in January, 1783, he sailed with a reinforcement to the East Indies, where superior bravery contended against superior force, till the policy of our negotiators put an end to unequal hostilities by a necessary peace.  The activity, or the zeal of Phillip, was now turned to more peaceful objects. And when it was determined to form a settlement on that part of New Holland, denominated New South Wales, he was thought of as a proper officer to conduct an enterprize, which required professional knowledge, and habitual prudence. His equipment, his voyage, and his settlement, in the other hemisphere, will be found in the following volume. When the time shall arrive that the European settlers on Sydney Cove demand their historian, these authentic anecdotes of their pristine legislator will be sought for as curious, and considered as important.   ERRATA (These have been corrected in this eBook) Page, line 1, 15, for enterprizes, read enterprises. 13, penult. for only fifty, read an hundred. Ibid. ult. for Penryn, read Penrhyn. 75, 7, for Surprize, read Surprise. 87, 14, after 17, dele th. 96, 13, for into, read in. 149, 10, for Kangooroo, read Kanguroo. The orthography of a word             derived only from oral sound is in some degree arbitrary; but             it ought to be consistant. The plates, by mistake, have Kangooroo. 185, 14, for it were were, read if it were. 203, 3, for Fobn, read Thomas. 213, 10, for four, read forty. 228, 23, bis, for Macauley, read Macaulay. 231, 15, for Patri, read Pabi. 252, Margin, for May, read June. 253, Ditto. 255, Margin, for July, read June. 256, Ditto. 232, 18, for Taha, read Toha. 242, 9, for who, read whom. 246, 25, for veer'd, read near'd.   N. B. Some of the early impressions of the plates have erroneously Wulpine Oppossum for Vulpine Opossum. After a few were work'd off the fault was perceived, and corrected.   ADVERTISEMENT.  The arrangement of materials in this volume being in some respects less perfect than might be wished, it is necessary that something should be said to obviate any imputation of negligence. The truth will be the best, and, as it ought, the only apology. The official papers of Governor Phillip, which were liberally communicated by Government, formed at first our principal source of intelligence. These, from their nature, could contain but little information on subjects of natural history, and many other points, concerning which the curiosity of every reader would naturally be excited. The efforts of the publisher to give satisfaction to the public in these respects produced a gradual influx of materials; and the successive arrival of different vessels from the Indian seas, occasioned additions to the work, which made it necessary to engrave new plates. While, therefore, the completion of the book was anxiously pressed by many who were eager to possess it, that desirable point has constantly been deferred by the communications of those who were studious to render it more valuable; and the word Finis, has seemed to fly from us, like Italy before the wandering Trojans. From the combination of these circumstances it has arisen, that every separate part has been hurried on in the execution; and yet, in the finishing of the whole, more time has elapsed, than would have been necessary to complete a much more ample volume. The defects that proceed from these causes, it is hoped, the reader will forgive, and accept with complacency a volume in which, it is confidently hoped, nothing material has been omitted that is connected with its principal object, the formation of a settlement promising both glory and advantage to this country; in which several important discoveries are announced; no small accession is made to the stores of natural history; and interesting notices are communicated of countries visited before, and persons in whose fate the public has long felt an interest.  The publisher thinks it his duty, in this place, to return thanks to the following noblemen and gentlemen, for their kind assistance and free communications. The Marquis of Salisbury, Viscount Sydney, Lord Hood, Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. Mr. Rose, Mr. Nepean, Mr. Stephens, Sir Charles Middleton, Sir Andrew Snape Hammond, Mr. Dalrymple, and Mr. Chalmers: but, to Mr. Latham particularly, the most grateful acknowledgements are due, for having furnished many drawings and accurate descriptions, which stamp a value on the natural history contained in this work, and must for ever render it an object of attention to all lovers of that science: and to Lieutenant Shortland, Lieutenant Watts, and Captain Marshall, of the Scarborough transport, the public owe whatever important discoveries and useful knowledge may be found in their journals, which they communicated with a disinterestedness that the publisher will be always happy to acknowledge.   ACCOUNT OF THE VIGNETTE.  The elegant vignette in the title-page, was engraved from a medallion which the ingenious Mr. Wedge-wood caused to be modelled from a small piece of clay brought from Sydney Cove. The clay proves to be of a fine texture, and will be found very useful for the manufactory of earthern ware. The design is allegorical; it represents Hope encouraging Art and Labour, under the influence of Peace, to pursue the employments necessary to give security and happiness to an infant settlement. The following verses upon the same subject, and in allusion to the medallion, were written by the author of The Botanic Garden, and will speak more powerfully for themselves than any encomium we could bestow.
