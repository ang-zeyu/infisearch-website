While she was looking at them, she heard the mother bird chirp, as if she said, \"Do not touch my children, little girl, for I love them dearly.\"  The little girl now thought how dearly her own mother loved her.  So she left the birds. Then picking some flowers, she went home, and told her mother what she had seen and heard.

They all have books in their hands, and Fanny is reading.  They are all good girls, and would not be rude even in playing school.  Kate and Mary listen to Fanny as she reads from her book.  What do you think she is reading about? I will tell you. It is about a poor little boy who was lost in the woods.  When Fanny has finished, the three girls will go home.

I think she knew the cat would not like that, and she did it to tease her.  When Lucy pets the cat, Polly flies up into the old apple tree, and will not come when she calls her. Then Lucy says, \"What a silly bird!\"    LESSON XLVI. REVIEW.   \"Well, children, did you have a nice time in the woods?\"  \"Oh yes, mother, such a good time!

The children are not far from home. In a little while the sun will set, and it will be bedtime.  Have you ever been at the seaside?

Frank has just pulled a fine fish out of the water. How proud he feels!  See what a nice, quiet spot they have found.
