Come with me, and I will show you your rooms.\"  They followed her up the stairs, and each was shown into a very pleasant room furnished tastefully and with every comfort and convenience.  Lulu's had two doors, one opening into the hall, the other into her mamma's bedroom.  Elsie explained this, adding, \"So, if you are in want of anything or should feel frightened or lonely in the night, you can run right in to the room where you will find your mamma and Gracie.\"  \"Yes, ma'am, that is very nice; and oh, what a pretty room! How kind and good you are to me! and to my brother and sister, too!\" cried Lulu, her eyes shining with gratitude and pleasure.  \"I am very glad to be able to do it,\" Elsie said, taking the little girl's hand in one of hers and smoothing her hair caressingly with the other--for Lulu had taken off her hat. \"I want to be a mother to you, dear child, and to your brother and sister, since my dear daughter is too young for so great care and responsibility. I love you all, and I want you to come freely to me with all your troubles and perplexities, your joys and sorrows, just as my own children have always done. I want you to feel that you have a right to do so, because I have invited you.\"  She bent down and kissed Lulu's lips, and the little girl threw her arms about her neck with impulsive warmth, saying, \"Dear Grandma Elsie, I love you and thank you ever so much! And I mean to try ever so hard to be good,\" she added, with a blush and hanging her head shamefacedly. \"I know I'm often very naughty; papa said I gave him more anxiety than Max and Gracie both put together; and I'm afraid I can't be good all the time, but I do mean to try hard.\"  \"Well, dear, if you try with all your might, asking help from on high, you will succeed at last,\" Elsie said. \"And now I will leave you to wash and dress. I see your trunk has been brought up and opened, so that you will have no difficulty.\"  With that she passed on into Violet's rooms to see how Gracie was. She found her sleeping sweetly in Violet's bed, the latter bending over her with a very tender, motherly look on her fair young face.  \"Is she not a darling, mamma?\" she whispered, turning her head at the sound of her mother's light footstep.  \"She is a very engaging child,\" replied Elsie. \"I think we are all fond of her, but you especially.\"  \"Yes, mamma, I love her for herself--her gentle, affectionate disposition--but still more because she is my husband's child, his dear baby girl, as he so often called her.\"  \"Ah, I can understand that,\" Elsie said, with a loving though rather sad look and smile into Violet's azure eyes, \"for I have often felt just so in regard to my own children. What does Arthur say about her?\"  \"That she is more in need of rest and sleep than anything else at present. He will see her again to-morrow, and will probably be able then to give me full directions in regard to her diet and so forth.\"  \"You will come down to supper? you will not think it necessary to stay with her yourself?\" Elsie said inquiringly.  \"Oh, no, mamma! I shall dress at once. I should not like to miss being with you all,\" Violet answered, moving away from the bedside. \"Ah!\" with sudden recollection, \"I have been quite forgetting Max and Lulu.\"  \"I have seen them to their rooms,\" her mother said, \"and now I must go and attend to Rosie and Walter, and to my own toilet.\"  \"Dear mamma, thank you!\" Violet said heartily.  \"My dear, I consider them quite as much my children, and therefore my especial charge, as yours, perhaps a trifle more,\" Elsie returned with sprightly look and tone as she left the room.  Agnes was in attendance on her young mistress, and was presently sent to ask if Lulu was in need of help, and to say that her mamma would like to see her before she went down-stairs.  \"I don't need anything till I'm ready to have my sash tied,\" answered Lulu, \"and then I'll come in to Mamma Vi and you to have it done. She was very good to send you, Agnes, and you to come.\"  \"La! chile, it's jus' my business to mind Miss Wilet,\" returned Agnes. \"An' she's good to eberybody, ob cose--always was.\"  \"What did you want to see me for, Mamma Vi?\" asked Lulu, as she presently entered her young stepmother's dressing-room.  \"Just to make sure that your hair and dress are all right, dear. You know we have company to-night, and I am particularly anxious that my little Lulu shall look her very best.\"  The child's face flushed with pleasure. She liked to be well and becomingly dressed, and it was gratifying to have Mamma Vi care that she should be. Mrs. Scrimp was so different; she had never cared whether Lulu's attire was tasteful and becoming or quite the reverse, but always roused the child's indignation by telling her it was all sufficient if she were only neat and clean.  \"Am I all right?\" she asked.  \"Pretty nearly; we will have you quite so in a minute,\" Violet answered. \"Tie her sash Agnes, and smooth down the folds of her dress.\"  \"Mamma Vi, is that strange lady any relation to you?\" asked Lulu.  \"Yes, she is my aunt, mamma's sister.\"  \"She is pretty, but not nearly so pretty as Grandma Elsie.\"  \"No; I have always thought no one else could be half so beautiful as mamma.\"  \"Why, Mamma Vi, you are yourself!\" exclaimed Lulu in a tone of honest sincerity that made Violet laugh.  \"That is just your notion, little girl,\" she said, giving the child a kiss.  \"Oh, I have eyes and can see! besides, papa thinks so, too, and Max and Gracie.\"  \"Yes, my dear husband! he loves me, and love is very blind,\" murmured Vi, half to herself, with a sigh and a far-off look in the lovely azure eyes. Her thoughts were following him over the deep, wide, treacherous sea.  She stole on tiptoe into the next room for another peep at his sleeping baby girl, Lulu going with her; then hearing the tea-bell, they went down to the dining-room together.  They gathered about the table, a large cheerful party, the travellers full of satisfaction in being at home again, the others so glad to have them there once more.  Zoe was very merry and Rosie in almost wild spirits, but Max and Lulu, to whom all was new and strange, were quite quiet and subdued, scarcely speaking except when spoken to, \"Mamma,\" Rosie said, when they had adjourned to the parlor, \"it's lovely out of doors, bright moonlight and not a bit cold; mayn't I take Max and Lulu down to the lakelet?\"  \"Do you think the evening air would be injurious to them, Arthur?\" Mrs. Travilla asked, turning to her cousin.  \"I think there is malaria in it, and would advise them to stay within doors until after breakfast to-morrow morning,\" he answered, drawing Rose to a seat upon his knee.  \"Then you'd better let us go,\" she said archly, \"so you can have some more patients. Don't you like to have plenty of patients?\"  \"That's a leading question, little coz,\" he said laughingly, toying with her curls. \"When people are sick I like to have an opportunity to exercise my skill in trying to relieve and cure them, but I hope I don't want them made sick in order to furnish me with employment.\"  \"I want to show Lulu and Max the beauties of Ion, and don't know how to wait till to-morrow,\" she said.  \"Then take them about from one room to another, and let them look out through the windows upon its moonlit lawn, alleys, gardens and lakelet.\"  \"Oh, yes, yes! that will do!\" she cried, leaving his knee in haste to carry out his suggestion.  Max and Lulu, nothing loath, accepted her invitation, and they ran in and out, up stairs and down, the young strangers delighted with the views thus obtained of their new home and its surroundings.  Rosie said she hoped they would not be required to begin lessons immediately, but would be allowed a few days in which to enjoy walks, rides, drives, and boating.  \"I'll ask grandpa and mamma if we may,\" she added, as they re-entered the parlor. She hastened to present her petition, and it was granted; the children were told they should have a week in which to enjoy themselves and recover from the fatigue of their journey, and would be expected to show their appreciation of the indulgence by great industry afterward.  Lulu was standing a little apart from the rest, gazing out of the window upon the moonlit lawn, when a step drew near; then some one took her by the arm, and in a twinkling she found herself seated upon a gentleman's knee.  Looking up into his face, she saw that it was Mr. Horace Dinsmore who had thus taken possession of her.  \"Well, my little dark-eyed lassie,\" he said, \"no one has thought it worth while to introduce us, but we won't let that hinder our making acquaintance. Do you know who I am?\"  \"I heard Rosie call you Uncle Horace.\"  \"Then suppose you follow Rosie's example. If you are as good as you are bonny, I shall be proud to claim you as my niece.\"  \"But I'm not,\" she said frankly. Then hastily correcting herself, \"I don't mean to say I'm bonny, but I'm not good. Aunt Beulah used to say I was the worst child she ever saw.\"  \"Indeed! you are honest, at all events,\" he said, with a look of amusement. \"And who is Aunt Beulah?\"  \"The person Gracie and I lived with before papa got married to Mamma Vi.\"  \"Ah! well I shall not regard her opinion, but wait and form one for myself, and I shall certainly be much surprised if you don't turn out a pattern good girl, now that you are to live with my sweet sister Elsie. In the mean while, will it please you to call me Uncle Horace?\"  \"Yes, sir, since you ask me to,\" Lulu replied, looking much gratified.  At this moment the door opened, and Mr. Lacey walked in. He had come for his wife, and when he and the others had exchanged greetings, she rose to make ready for departure.  Calhoun Conly rose also, saying to his brother, \"Well, Art, perhaps it would be as well for us to go, too; our friends must be tired after their long journey, and will want to get to bed early.\"  \"Suppose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14909"],["title","Elsie's New Relations (#8)"],["body","all delay a little and unite with us in evening family worship,\" said Mr. Dinsmore. \"It is a good while since I have had all three of my children present with me at such a service.\"  All complied with his request, and immediately afterward took leave. Then with an exchange of affectionate good-nights the family separated and scattered to their rooms.  Lulu was not quite ready for bed when Violet came in, and putting her arm around her, asked, with a gentle kiss, \"Do you feel strange and lonely in this new place, little girl?\"  \"Oh, no, Mamma Vi! it seems such a nice home that I am very glad to be in it.\"  \"That is right,\" Violet said, repeating her caress. \"I hope you will sleep well and wake refreshed. I shall leave the door open between your room and mine, so that you need not feel timid, and can run right in to me whenever you wish. Good-night, dear.\"  \"Good-night, Mamma Vi. Thank you for being so good to me, and to Gracie and Max,\" Lulu said, clinging to her in an affectionate way.  \"My child,\" returned Violet, \"how could I be anything else to the children of my dear husband? Ah, I must go! Mamma calls me,\" she added, hurrying away as a soft, sweet voice was heard coming from the adjoining room.  Lulu finished undressing, said her prayers, and had just laid her head on her pillow, when some one glided noiselessly to the bedside and a soft hand passed caressingly over her hair.  The child opened her eyes, which had already closed in sleep, and saw by the moonlight a sweet and beautiful face bending lovingly over her.  \"Grandma Elsie,\" she murmured sleepily.  \"Yes, dear. Rosie and Walter never like to go to sleep without a good-night kiss from mamma, and you must have the same now, as you are to be one of my dear children.\"  Lulu, now wide awake, started up to put both arms round the neck of her visitor. \"Oh, I do love you!\" she said, \"and I'll try hard to be a good child to you.\"  \"I believe it, dear,\" Elsie said, pressing the child to her heart. \"Will you join my children in their half-hour with mamma in her dressing-room before breakfast? I shall be glad to have you, but you must do just as you please about it.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am; I'll come,\" said Lulu.  \"That is right. Now lie down and go to sleep. You need a long night's rest.\"     CHAPTER VII.      \"Her fancy followed him through foaming wares      To distant shores.\"                                 --Cowper.   Violet in her night-dress and with her beautiful hair unbound and hanging about her like a golden cloud, stood before her dressing-table, gazing through a mist of unshed tears upon a miniature which she held in her hand.  \"Ah, where are you now, love?\" she sighed half aloud.  Her mother's voice answered close at her side, in gentle, tender accents, \"In God's keeping, my darling. He is the God of the sea as well as of the land.\"  \"Yes, mamma, and his God as well as mine,\" Violet responded, looking up and smiling through her tears. \"Ah, what comfort in both assurances, and in the precious promise, 'Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest.' It is his and it is mine.\"  \"Yes, dearest. I feel for you in your loneliness,\" her mother said, putting her arms around her. \"Elsie is very happy in her husband and baby, Edward in his wife; they need me but little, comparatively, but you and I must draw close together and be a comfort and support to each other; shall we not, my love?\"  \"Yes, indeed, dearest mamma. Oh, what a comfort and blessing you are to me, and always have been! And I am happier and less lonely for having my husband's children with me, especially my darling little Gracie. I feel that in caring for her and nursing her back to health I shall be adding to his happiness.\"  \"As no doubt you will,\" her mother said. \"It will be a pleasure to me to help you care for her, and the others also. Now, good-night, daughter; we both ought to be in bed.\"  Violet presently stretched herself beside the sleeping Gracie with a murmured word of endearment drew the child closer to her, and in another moment was sharing her slumbers.  When she awoke the sun was shining, and the first object her eyes rested upon was the little face by her side. The pallor and look of exhaustion it had worn the night before were quite gone, a faint tinge of pink had even stolen into the cheeks.  Violet noted the change with a feeling of relief and thankfulness, and raising herself upon her elbow, touched her lips lightly to the white forehead.  The child's eyes flew open and with a sweet engaging smile, she asked, \"Have you been lying beside me all night, mamma?\"  \"Yes, Gracie. You have had a long sleep, dear; do you feel quite rested?\"  \"Yes, mamma, I feel very well. This is such a nice soft bed, and I like to sleep with you. May I always?\"  \"For all winter, I think, dear. I like to have your papa's baby girl by my side.\"  \"I'm very much obliged to him for finding me such a sweet, pretty new mamma. I told him so one day,\" remarked the child innocently, putting an arm about Vi's neck.  \"Did you?\" Violet asked with an amused smile; \"and what did he say?\"  \"Nothing; he just smiled and hugged me tight and kissed me ever so many times. Do you know what made him do that, mamma?\"  \"Because he likes to have us love one another. And so we will, won't we, dear?\"  \"Yes, indeed! Mamma, I feel a little hungry.\"  \"I'm glad to hear it, for here comes Agnes with a glass of nice rich milk for you. And when you have drunk it she will wash and dress you. We will all have to hurry a little to be ready in good time for breakfast,\" she added, springing from the bed and beginning her toilet. \"Grandpa Dinsmore never likes to have us late.\"  \"Miss Rosie and Miss Lulu's up and dressed and gone into Miss Elsie's room, Miss Wilet,\" remarked Agnes, holding the tumbler she had brought to Gracie's lips.  \"Ah, that is well,\" said Violet, with a pleased look. \"Lulu has stolen a march on us, Gracie.\"  The week that followed their arrival at Ion was a delightful one to all, especially the children, who had scarce anything to do but enjoy themselves. The weather was all that could be desired, and they walked, rode, drove, boated, fished, and went nutting.  Mr. Dinsmore and Edward were every day more or less busied with the affairs of the plantation, but some one of the older people could always find time to be with the children, while Zoe never failed to make one of the party, and seemed almost as much a child as any of the younger ones.  Every nook on the plantation and in its neighborhood was explored, and visits were paid to Fairview, the Laurels, the Pines, the Oaks, Roselands and Ashlands; the dwellers at each place having first called upon the family at Ion.  Both Max and Lulu had long desired to learn to ride on horseback, and great was their delight on learning that now this wish could be gratified.  A pony was always at the service of each, and lessons in the art of sitting and managing it were given them, now by Mr. Dinsmore and now by Edward, who was a great admirer of his brother-in-law, Captain Raymond, had become much attached to him, and took a very kindly interest in his children.  Gracie was given a share in all the pleasures for which she was considered strong enough, and when not able to go with the others on their expeditions, was well entertained at home with toys and books filled with pictures and stories suited to her age.  Both Elsie and Violet watched over the little girl with true motherly love and care; she warmly returning the affection of both, but clinging especially to Violet, her \"pretty new mamma.\"  Gracie was a docile little creature, and seemed very happy in her new life. She was deeply interested in the riding lessons of her brother and sister, and when, near the end of the week, Dr. Arthur, to whom she was becoming much attached, set her on the back of a Shetland pony and led it about the grounds for a few minutes, promising her longer rides as her strength increased, she was almost speechless with happiness.  With the second week lessons began for the children. Each task had its appointed hour, and they were required to be as systematic, punctual and well prepared for recitations as pupils in an ordinary school, but at the same time great care was taken that neither mind nor body should be overtaxed, and they enjoyed many liberties and indulgences which could not have been granted elsewhere than at home.  The mornings were spent by Rosie and Lulu in the school-room in study and recitation, under the supervision of either \"Grandma Elsie\" or \"Mamma Vi.\"  Grace and Walter would be there also at the start, but their short and easy tasks having been attended to, they might stay and amuse themselves quietly, or if inclined for noisy sport, go to the nursery or play-room to enjoy it there.  Max conned his lessons alone in his own room, joining the others only when the hour arrived for reciting to Mr. Dinsmore, who took sole charge of his education, and of the two little girls, so far as concerned Latin and arithmetic. Rosie and Max were together in both these studies, but Lulu--because of being younger and not so far advanced--was alone in both, much to her dissatisfaction, for she was by no means desirous to have Mr. Dinsmore's attention concentrated upon herself for even a short space of time.  His keen dark eyes seemed to look her through and through, and though he had never shown her any sternness, she was quite sure he could and would if she gave him any occasion.  But for that there was no necessity, his requirements being always reasonable and only such as she was fully capable of meeting. She had a good mind, quick discernment and retentive memory, and she was quite resolved to be industrious and to keep her promise to her father to be a good girl in every way. Also her ambition was aroused to attempt to overtake her brother and Rosie.  She was moderately fond of study, but had a decided repugnance to plain sewing, therefore looked ill-ple"]]]
