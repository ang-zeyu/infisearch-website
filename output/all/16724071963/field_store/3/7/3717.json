George's mother was very poor. Instead of having bright, blazing fires in winter, she had nothing to burn but dry sticks, which George picked up from under the trees and hedges. 2. One fine day in July, she sent George to the woods, which were about two miles from the village in which she lived. He   THIRD READER.  87 was to stay there all day, to get as much wood as he could collect. 3. It was a bright, sunny day, and George worked very hard; so that by the time the  sun was high, he was hot, and wished for a cool place where he might rest and eat his dinner. 4. While he hunted about the bank he saw among the moss some fine, wild strawberries, which were a bright scarlet with ripeness.   88  ECLECTIC SERIES. 5. \"How good these will be with my bread and butter!\" thought George; and lining his little cap with leaves, he set to work eagerly to gather all he could find, and then seated himself by the brook. 6. It was a pleasant place, and George felt happy and contented. He thought how much his mother would like to see him there, and to be there herself, instead of in her dark, close room in the village. 7. George thought of all this, and just as he was lifting the first strawberry to his mouth, he said to himself, \"How much mother would like these;\" and he stopped, and put the strawberry back again. 8. \"Shall I save them for her?\" said he, thinking how much they would refresh her, yet still looking at them with a longing eye. 9. \"I will eat half, and take the other half to her,\" said he at last; and he divided them into two heaps. But each heap looked so small, that he put them together again. 10. \"I will only taste one,\" thought he; but, as he again lifted it to his mouth, he saw that he had taken the finest, and he put it back. \"I will keep them all for her,\"   THIRD READER.  89 said he, and he covered them up nicely, till he should go home. 11. When the sun was beginning to sink, George set out for home. How happy he felt, then, that he had all his strawberries for his sick mother. The nearer he came to his home, the less he wished to taste them. 12. Just as he had thrown down his wood, he heard his mother's faint voice calling him from the next room. \"Is that you, George? I am glad you have come, for I am thirsty, and am longing for some tea.\" 13. George ran in to her, and joyfully offered his wild strawberries. \"And you saved them for your sick mother, did you?\" said she, laying her hand fondly on his head, while the tears stood in her eyes. \"God will bless you for all this, my child.\" 14. Could the eating of the strawberries have given George half the happiness he felt at this moment?     90  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XXXV.    THE LORD'S PRAYER.  1. Our Father in heaven, We hallow thy name; May thy kingdom holy On earth be the same; Oh, give to us daily Our portion of bread; It is from thy bounty, That all must be fed.  2. Forgive our transgressions. And teach us to know The humble compassion That pardons each foe; Keep us from temptation, From weakness and sin, And thine be the glory Forever! Amen!   THIRD READER.  91 AN EVENING PRAYER.     92  ECLECTIC SERIES.     LESSON XXXVI.      FINDING THE OWNER. 1. \"It's mine,\" said Fred, showing a white handled pocketknife, with every blade perfect and shining. \"Just what I've always   THIRD READER.  93 wanted.\" And he turned the prize over and over with evident satisfaction. 2. \"I guess I know who owns it,\" said Tom, looking at it with a critical eye.  3. \"I guess you do n't,\" was the quick response. \"It is n't Mr. Raymond's,\" said Fred, shooting wide of the mark. 4. \"I know that; Mr. Raymond's is twice as large,\" observed Tom, going on with his drawing lesson. 5. Do you suppose Fred took any comfort in that knife? Not a bit of comfort did he take. He was conscious all the time of having something in his possession that did   94  ECLECTIC  SERIES. not belong to him; and Tom's suspicion interfered sadly with his enjoyment. 6. Finally, it became such a torment to him, that he had serious thoughts of burning it, or burying it, or giving it away; but a better plan suggested itself. 7. \"Tom,\" said he, one day at recess, \"did n't you say you thought you knew who owned that knife I found?\" 8. \"Yes, I did; it looked like Doctor Perry's.\" And Tom ran off to his play, without giving the knife another thought. 9. Dr. Perry's! Why, Fred would have time to go to the doctor's office before recess closed: so he started in haste, and found the old gentleman getting ready to visit a patient. \"Is this yours?\" cried Fred, in breathless haste, holding up the cause of a week's anxiety. 10. \"It was,\" said the doctor; \"but I lost it the other day.\" 11. \"I found it,\" said Fred, \"and have felt like a thief ever since. Here, take it; I've got to run.\" 12. \"Hold on!\" said the doctor. \"I've got a new one, and you are quite welcome to this.\"   THIRD READER.  95 13. \"Am I? May I? Oh! thank you!\"  And with what a different feeling he kept it from that which he had experienced for a week!  LESSON XXXVII.  BATS. 1. Bats are very strange little animals, having hair like mice, and wings like birds. During the day, they live in crevices of rocks, in caves, and in other dark places. 2. At night, they go forth in search of food; and, no doubt, you have seen them flying  96  ECLECTIC SERIES. about, catching such insects as happen to be out rather late at night. 3. The wings of a bat have no quills. They are only thin pieces of skin stretched upon a framework of bones. Besides this, it may be said that while he is a quadruped, he can rise into the air and fly from place to place like a bird. 4. There is a funny fable about the bat, founded upon this double character of beast and bird, which I will tell you. 5. An owl was once prowling about, when he came across a bat. So he caught him in his claws, and was about to devour him. Upon this, the bat began to squeal terribly; and he said to the owl, \"Pray, what do you take me for, that you use me thus?\" 6. \"Why, you are a bird, to be sure,\" said the owl, \"and I am fond of birds. I love dearly to break their little bones.\" 7. \"Well,\" said the bat, \"I thought there was some mistake. I am no bird. Do n't you see, Mr. Owl, that I have no feathers, and that I am covered with hair like a mouse?\" 8. \"Sure enough,\" said the owl, in great surprise; \"I see it now. Really, I took you   THIRD READER.  97 for a bird, but it appears you are only a kind of mouse. I ate a mouse last night, and it gave me the nightmare. I can't bear mice! Bah! it makes me sick to think of it.\" So the owl let the bat go.  9. The very next night, the bat encountered another danger. He was snapped up by puss, who took him for a mouse, and immediately prepared to eat him. 10. \"I beg you to stop one moment,\" said the bat. \"Pray, Miss Puss, what do you suppose I am?\" \"A mouse, to be sure!\" said the cat. \"Not at all,\" said the bat, spreading his long wings. 11. \"Sure enough,\" said the cat: \"you seem to be a bird, though your feathers are 3,7.   98  ECLECTIC SERIES. not very fine. I eat birds sometimes, but I am tired of them just now, having lately devoured four young robins; so you may go. But, bird or mouse, it will be your best policy to keep out of my way hereafter.\" 12. The meaning of this fable is, that a person playing a double part may sometimes escape danger; but he is always, like the bat, a creature that is disgusting to everybody, and shunned by all. S. G. Goodrich--Adapted.  LESSON XXXVIII.    A SUMMER DAY.  1. This is the way the morning dawns: Rosy tints on flowers and trees, Winds that wake the birds and bees, Dewdrops on the fields and lawns-- This is the way the morning dawns.  2. This is the way the sun comes up: Gold on brook and glossy leaves,   THIRD READER.  99  Mist that melts above the sheaves, Vine, and rose, and buttercup-- This is the way the sun comes up.   0  3. This is the way the river flows: Here a whirl, and there a dance; Slowly now, then, like a lance, Swiftly to the sea it goes-- This is the way the river flows.   100  ECLECTIC SERIES.  4. This is the way the rain comes down: Tinkle, tinkle, drop by drop, Over roof and chimney top; Boughs that bend, and skies that frown-- This is the way the rain comes down.  5. This is the way the birdie sings: \"Baby birdies in the nest, You I surely love the best; Over you I fold my wings\"-- This is the way the birdie sings.  6. This is the way the daylight dies: Cows are lowing in the lane, Fireflies wink on hill and plain; Yellow, red, and purple skies-- This is the way the daylight dies. George Cooper.     THIRD READER.  101  LESSON XXXIX.     I WILL THINK OF IT. 1. \"I will think of it.\" It is easy to say this; but do you know what great things have come from thinking? 2. We can not see our thoughts, or hear, or taste, or feel them; and yet what mighty power they have! 3. Sir Isaac Newton was seated in his garden on a summer's evening, when he saw an apple fall from a tree. He began to think, and, in trying to find out why the apple fell, discovered how the earth, sun, moon, and stars are kept in their places. 4. A boy named James Watt sat quietly by the fireside, watching the lid of the tea kettle as it moved up and down. He began to think; he wanted to find out why the steam in the kettle moved the heavy lid.   102  ECLECTIC SERIES.   5. From that time he went on thinking and thinking; and when he became a man, he improved the steam engine so much that it could, with the greatest ease, do the work of many horses. 6. When you see a steamboat, a steam mill, or a locomotive, remember that it would never have been built if it had not been for the hard thinking of some one. 7. A man named Galileo was once standing in the cathedral of Pisa, when he saw a chandelier swaying to and fro.   THIRD READER.  103 8. This set him thinking, and it led to the invention of the pendulum. 9. James Ferguson was a poor Scotch shepherd boy. Once, seeing the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14766"],["title","McGuffey's Third Eclectic Reader (#7)"],["body","of a watch, he was filled with wonder. \"Why should I not make a watch?\" thought he. 10. But how was he to get the materials out of which to make the wheels and the mainspring? He soon found how to get them: he made the mainspring out of a piece of whalebone. He then made a wooden clock which kept good time. 11. He began, also, to copy pictures with a pen, and portraits with oil colors. In a few years, while still a small boy, he earned money enough to support his father. 12. When he became a man, he went to London to live. Some of the wisest men in England, and the king himself, used to attend his lectures. His motto was, \"I will think of it;\" and he made his thoughts useful to himself and the world. 13. Boys, when you have a difficult lesson to learn, do n't feel discouraged, and ask some one to help you before helping yourselves. Think, and by thinking you will learn how to think to some purpose.   104  ECLECTIC SERIES. LESSON XL. CHARLIE AND ROB. 1. \"Do n't you hate splitting wood?\" asked Charlie, as he sat down on a log to hinder Rob for a while. 2. \"No, I rather like it. When I get hold of a tough old fellow, I say, 'See here, now, you think you're the stronger, and are going to beat me; so I'll split you up into kindling wood.\" 3. \"Pshaw!\" said Charlie, laughing; \"and it's only a stick of wood.\" 4. \"Yes; but you see I pretend it's a lesson, or a tough job of any kind, and it's nice to conquer it.\" 5. \"I do n't want to conquer such things; I do n't care what becomes of them. I wish I were a man, and a rich one.\" 6. \"Well, Charlie, if you live long enough you'll be a man, without wishing for it; and as for the rich part, I mean to be that myself.\" 7. \"You do. How do you expect to get your money? By sawing wood?\" 8. \"May be--some of it; that's as good a   THIRD READER.  105    way as any, so long as it lasts. I do n't care how I get rich, you know, so that it's in an honest and useful way.\" 9. \"I'd like to sleep over the next ten years, and wake up to find myself a young man with a splendid education and plenty of money.\"   106  ECLECTIC SERIES. 10. \"Humph! I am not sleepy--a night at a time is enough for me. I mean to work the next ten years. You see there are things that you've got to work out--you can't sleep them out.\" 11. \"I hate work,\" said Charlie, \"that is, such work as sawing and splitting wood, and doing chores. I'd like to do some big work, like being a clerk in a bank or something of that sort.\" 12. \"Wood has to be sawed and split before it can be burned,\" said Rob. \"I do n't know but I'll be a clerk in a bank some time; I'm working towards it. I'm keeping father's accounts for him.\" 13. How Charlie laughed! \"I should think that was a long way from being a bank clerk. I suppose your father sells two tables and six chairs, some days, does n't he?\" 14. \"Sometimes more than that, and sometimes not so much,\" said Rob, in perfect good humor. 15. \"I did n't say I was a bank clerk now.  I said I was working towards it. Am I not nearer it by keeping a little bit of a book than I should be if I did n't keep any book at all?\"   THIRD READER.  107 16. \"Not a whit--such things happen,\" said Charlie, as he started to go. 17. Now, which of these boys, do you think, grew up to be a rich and useful man, and which of them joined a party of tramps before he was thirty years old?    LESSON XLI.  RAY AND HIS KITE. 1. Ray was thought to be an odd boy. You will think him so, too, when you have read this story. 2. Ray liked well enough to play with the boys at school; yet he liked better to be alone under the shade of some tree, reading a fairy tale or dreaming daydreams. But there was one sport that he liked as well as his companions; that was kiteflying. 3. One day when he was flying his kite, he said to himself, \"I wonder if anybody ever tried to fly a kite at night. It seems   108  ECLECTIC SERIES. to me it would be nice. But then, if it were very dark, the kite could not be seen. What if I should fasten a light to it, though? That would make it show. I'll try it this very night.\" 4. As soon as it was dark, without saying a word to anybody, he took his kite and lantern, and went to a large, open lot, about a quarter of a mile from his home. \"Well,\" thought he, \"this is queer. How lonely and still it seems without any other boys around! But I am going to fly my kite, anyway.\" 5. So he tied the lantern, which was made of tin punched full of small holes, to the tail of his kite. Then he pitched the kite, and,     THIRD READER. 109 after several attempts, succeeded in making it rise. Up it went, higher and higher, as Ray let out the string. When the string was all unwound, he tied it to a fence; and then he stood and gazed at his kite as it floated high up in the air. 6. While Ray was enjoying his sport, some people who were out on the street in the village, saw a strange light in the sky. They gathered in groups to watch it. Now it was still for a few seconds, then it seemed to be jumping up and down; then it made long sweeps back and forth through the air. 7. \"What can it be?\" said one person. \"How strange!\" said another. \"It can not be a comet; for comets have tails,\" said a third. \"Perhaps it's a big firefly,\" said another. 8. At last some of the men determined to find out what this strange light was--whether it was a hobgoblin dancing in the air, or something dropped from the sky. So off they started to get as near it as they could. 9. While this was taking place, Ray, who had got tired of standing, was seated in a fence corner, behind a tree. He could see   110  ECLECTIC SERIES. the men as they approached; but they did not see him. 10. When they were directly under the light, and saw what it was, they looked at each other, laughing, and said, \"This is some boy's trick; and it has fooled us nicely. Let us keep the secret, and have our share of the joke.\" 11. Then they laughed again, and went back to the village; and some of the simple people there have not yet found out what that strange light was. 12. When thc men had gone, Ray thought it was time for him to go; so he wound up his string, picked up his kite and lantern, and went home. His mother had been wondering what had become of him. 13. When she heard what he had been doing, she hardly knew whether to laugh or scold; but I think she laughed, and told him that it was time for him to go to bed.     THIRD READER.  111  LESSON XLII. BEWARE OF THE FIRST DRINK.  1. \"Uncle Philip, as the day is fine, will you take a walk with us this morning?\" 2. \"Yes, boys. Let me get my hat and cane, and we will take a ramble. I will tell you a story as we go. Do you know poor old Tom Smith?\" 3. \"Know him! Why, Uncle Philip, everybody knows him. He is such a shocking drunkard, and swears so horribly.\" 4. \"Well, I have known him ever since we were boys together. There was not a more decent, well-behaved boy among us. After he left school, his father died, and he was put into a store in the city. There, he fell into bad company. 5. \"Instead of spending his evenings in reading, he would go to the theater and to balls. He soon learned to play cards, and of course to play for money. He lost more than he could pay. 6. \"He wrote to his poor mother, and told her his losses. She sent him money to pay his debts, and told him to come home.   112  ECLECTIC SERIES. 7. \"He did come home. After all, he might still have been useful and happy, for his friends were willing to forgive the past. For a time, things went on well. He married a lovely woman, gave up his bad habits, and was doing well. 8. \"But one thing, boys, ruined him forever. In the city, he had learned to take strong drink, and he said to me once, that when a man begins to drink, he never knows where it will end. 'Therefore,' said Tom, 'beware of the first drink!' 9. \"It was not long before he began to follow his old habit. He knew the danger, but it seemed as if he could not resist his desire to drink. His poor mother soon died of grief and shame. His lovely wife followed her to the grave. 10. \"He lost the respect of all, went on from bad to worse, and has long been a perfect sot. Last night, I had a letter from the city, stating that Tom Smith had been found guilty of stealing, and sent to the state prison for ten years. 11. \"There I suppose he will die, for he is now old. It is dreadful to think to what an end he has come. I could not but think,   THIRD READER.  113 as I read the letter, of what he said to me years ago, 'Beware of the first drink!' 12. \"Ah, my dear boys, when old Uncle Philip is gone, remember that he told you  the story of Tom Smith, and said to you, 'Beware of the first drink!' The man who does this will never be a drunkard.\"     114  ECLECTIC SERIES.  LESSON XLIII.  SPEAK GENTLY.  1. Speak gently; it is better far To rule by love than fear: Speak gently; let no harsh words mar The good we might do here.  2. Speak gently to the little child; Its love be sure to gain; Teach it in accents soft and mild; It may not long remain.  3. Speak gently to the aged one; Grieve not the careworn heart: The sands of life are nearly run; Let such in peace depart.  4. Speak gently, kindly, to the poor; Let no harsh tone be heard; They have enough they must endure, Without an unkind word.  5. Speak gently to the erring; know They must have toiled in vain; Perhaps unkindness made them so; Oh, win them back again.   THIRD READER.  115  6. Speak gently: 'tis a little thing Dropped in the heart's deep well; The good, the joy, which it may bring, Eternity shall tell. George Washington Langford.     LESSON XLIV.  THE SEVEN STICKS. 1. A man had seven sons, who were always quarreling. They left their studies and work, to quarrel among themselves. Some bad men were looking forward to the death of their father, to cheat them out of their property by making them quarrel about it. 2. The good old man, one day, called his sons around him. He laid before them seven sticks, which were bound together. He said, \"I will pay a hundred"]]]
