Wh has a sound accounted peculiar to the English, which the Saxons better expressed by hw, as, what, whence, whiting; in whore only, and sometimes in wholesome, wh is sounded like a simple h.  X.  X begins no English word: it has the sound of ks, as axle, extraneous.  Y.  Y, when it follows a consonant, is a vowel; when it precedes either a vowel or a diphthong, is a consonant, as ye, young. It is thought by some to be in all cases a vowel. But it may be observed of y as of w, that it follows a vowel without any hiatus, as rosy youth.      The chief argument by which w and y appear to be always vowels is, that     the sounds which they are supposed to have as consonants, cannot be     uttered after a vowel, like that of all other consonants; thus we say     tu, ut; do, odd; but in wed, dew; the two sounds of w have no     resemblance to each other.  Z.  Z begins no word originally English; it has the sound, as its name izzard or s hard expresses, of an s uttered with a closer compression of the palate by the tongue, as freeze, froze.      In orthography I have supposed orthoepy, or just utterance of words, to     be included; orthography being only the art of expressing certain     sounds by proper characters. I have therefore observed in what words     any of the letters are mute.      Most of the writers of English grammar have given long tables of words     pronounced otherwise than they are written, and seem not sufficiently     to have considered, that of English, as of all living tongues, there is     a double pronunciation, one cursory and colloquial, the other regular     and solemn. The cursory pronunciation is always vague and uncertain,     being made different in different mouths by negligence, unskilfulness,     or affectation. The solemn pronunciation, though by no means immutable     and permanent, is yet always less remote from the orthography, and less     liable to capricious innovation. They have however generally formed     their tables according to the cursory speech of those with whom they     happened to converse; and concluding that the whole nation combines to     vitiate language in one manner, have often established the jargon of     the lowest of the people as the model of speech.      For pronunciation the best general rule is, to consider those as the     most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words.      There have been many schemes offered for the emendation and settlement     of our orthography, which, like that of other nations, being formed by     chance, or according to the fancy of the earliest writers in rude ages,     was at first very various and uncertain, and is yet sufficiently     irregular. Of these reformers some have endeavoured to accommodate     orthography better to the pronunciation, without considering that this     is to measure by a shadow, to take that for a model or standard which     is changing while they apply it. Others, less absurdly indeed, but with     equal unlikelihood of success, have endeavoured to proportion the     number of letters to that of sounds, that every sound may have its own     character, and every character a single sound. Such would be the     orthography of a new language, to be formed by a synod of grammarians     upon principles of science. But who can hope to prevail on nations to     change their practice, and make all their old books useless? or what     advantage would a new orthography procure equivalent to the confusion     and perplexity of such an alteration?      Some ingenious men, indeed, have endeavoured to deserve well of their     country, by writing honor and labor for honour and labour, red for read     in the preter-tense, sais for says, repete tor repeat, explane for     explain, or declame for declaim. Of these it may be said, that as they     have done no good they have done little harm; both because they have     innovated little, and because few have followed them.      The English language has properly no dialects; the style of writers has     no professed diversity in the use of words, or of their flexions and     terminations, nor differs but by different degrees of skill or care.     The oral diction is uniform in no spacious country, but has less     variation in England than in most other nations of equal extent. The     language of the northern counties retains many words now out of use,     but which are commonly of the genuine Teutonick race, and is uttered     with a pronunciation which now seems harsh and rough, but was probably     used by our ancestors. The northern speech is therefore not barbarous,     but obsolete. The speech in the western provinces seems to differ from     the general diction rather by a depraved pronunciation, than by any     real difference which letters would express.         *       *       *       *       *  ETYMOLOGY.  Etymology teaches the deduction of one word from another, and the various modifications by which the sense of the same word is diversified; as horse, horses; I love, I loved.  Of the ARTICLE.  The English have two articles, an or a, and the.  AN, A.  A has an indefinite signification, and means one, with some reference to more; as This is a good book; that is, one among the books that are good; He was killed by a sword; that is, some sword; This is a better book for a man than a boy; that is, for one of those that are men than one of those that are boys; An army might enter without resistance; that is, any army.  In the senses in which we use a or an in the singular, we speak in the plural without an article; as these are good books.      I have made an the original article, because it is only the Saxon an,     or æn, one, applied to a new use, as the German ein, and the French un;     the n being cut off before a consonant in the speed of utterance.  Grammarians of the last age direct, that an should be used before h; whence it appears that the English anciently asperated less. An is still used before the silent h; as an herb, an honest man; but otherwise a; as    A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.       Shakespeare.  An or a can only be joined with a singular: the correspondent plural is the noun without an article, as, I want a pen, I want pens; or with the pronominal adjective some, as, I want some pens.  THE.  The has a particular and definite signification.                    The fruit   Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste   Brought death into the world.       Milton.  That is, that particular fruit, and this world in which we live. So, He giveth fodder for the cattle, and green herbs for the use of man; that is, for those beings that are cattle, and his use that is man.  The is used in both numbers.    I am as free as Nature first made man,   Ere the base laws of servitude began,   When wild in woods the noble savage ran.       Dryden.  Many words are used without articles; as  1. Proper names, as John, Alexander, Longinus, Aristarchus, Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, London. GOD is used as a proper name.  2. Abstract names, as blackness, witch-craft, virtue, vice, beauty, ugliness, love, hatred, anger, good-nature, kindness.  3. Words in which nothing but the mere being of any thing is implied: This is not beer, but water; this is not brass, but steel.         *       *       *       *       *  Of NOUNS SUBSTANTIVE.  The relations of English nouns to words going before or following are not expressed by cases, or changes of termination, but, as in most of the other European languages, by prepositions, unless we may be said to have a genitive case.  Singular.  Nom. Magister,        a Master, the Master.  Gen. Magistri,        of a Master, of the Master,                       or Master's, the Master's.  Dat. Magistro,        to a Master, to the Master.  Acc. Magistrum,       a Master, the Master.  Voc. Magister,        Master, O Master.  Abl. Magistro,        from a Master, from the Master.  Plural.  Nom. Magistri,        Masters, the Masters.  Gen. Magistrorum,     of Masters, of the Masters.  Dat. Magistris,       to Masters, to the Masters.  Acc. Magistros,       Masters, the Masters.  Voc. Magistri,        Masters, O Masters.  Abl. Magistris,       from Masters, from the Masters.  Our nouns are therefore only declined thus:  Master,     Gen. Master's.        Plur. Masters.  Scholar,    Gen. Scholar's.       Plur. Scholars.      These genitives are always written with a mark of elision, master's,     scholar's, according to an opinion long received, that the 's is a     contraction of his, as the soldier's valour, for the soldier his     valour: but this cannot be the true original, because 's is put to     female nouns, Woman's beauty; the Virgin's delicacy; Haughty Juno's     unrelenting hate; and collective nouns, as Women's passions; the     rabble's insolence; the multitude's folly: in all these cases it is     apparent that his cannot be understood. We say likewise the     foundation's strength; the diamond's lustre; the winter's severity: but     in these cases his may be understood, he and his having formerly been     applied to neuters in the place now supplied by it and its.      The learned and sagacious Wallis, to whom every English grammarian owes     a tribute of reverence, calls this modification of the noun an     adjective possessive; I think with no more propriety than he might have     applied the same to the genitive in equitum decus, Trojæ oris, or any     other Latin genitive. Dr. Lowth, on the other part, supposes the     possessive pronouns mine and thine to be genitive cases.      This termination of the noun seems to constitute a real genitive     indicating possession. It is derived to us from the Saxon's who     declined smith, a smith; Gen. smither, of a smith; Plur. smither or     smithar,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],["title","A Grammar of the English Tongue (#3)"],["body","ths; and so in two other of their seven declensions.      It is a further confirmation of this opinion, that in the old poets     both the genitive and plural were longer by a syllable than the     original word: knitis for knight's, in Chaucer; leavis for leaves, in     Spenser.      When a word ends in s, the genitive may be the same with the     nominative, as Venus temple.  The plural is formed by adding s, as table, tables; fly, flies; sister, sisters; wood, woods; or es where s could not otherwise be sounded, as after ch, s, sh, x, z; after c sounded like s, and g like j; the mute e is vocal before s, as lance, lances; outrage, outrages.      The formation of the plural and genitive singular is the same.      A few words still make the plural in n, as men, women, oxen, swine, and     more anciently eyen, shoon. This formation is that which generally     prevails in the Teutonick dialects.  Words that end in f commonly form their plural by ves, as loaf, loaves; calf, calves.      Except a few, muff, muffs; chief, chiefs. So hoof, roof, proof, relief,     mischief, puff, cuff, dwarf, handkerchief, grief.      Irregular plurals are teeth from tooth, lice from louse, mice from     mouse, geese from goose, feet from foot, dice from die, pence from     penny, brethren from brother, children from child.  Plurals ending in s have no genitives; but we say, Womens excellencies, and Weigh the mens wits against the ladies hairs.      Dr. Willis thinks the Lords' house may he said for the house of Lords;     but such phrases are not now in use; and surely an English ear rebels     against them. They would commonly produce a troublesome ambiguity, as     the Lord's house may be the house of Lords, or the house of a Lord.     Besides that the mark of elision is improper, for in the Lords' house     nothing is cut off.      Some English substantives, like those of many other languages, change     their termination as they express different sexes; as prince, princess;     actor, actress; lion, lioness; hero, heroine. To these mentioned by Dr.     Lowth may be added arbitress, poetess, chauntress, duchess, tigress,     governess, tutress, peeress, authoress, traytress, and perhaps othets.     Of these variable terminations we have only a sufficient number to make     us feel our want; for when we say of a woman that she is a philosopher,     an astronomer, a builder, a weaver, a dancer, we perceive an     impropriety in the termination which we cannot avoid; but we can say     that she is an architect, a botanist, a student. because these     terminations have not annexed to them the notion of sex. In words which     the necessities of life are often requiring, the sex is distinguished     not by different terminations but by different names, as a bull, a cow;     a horse, a mare; equus, equa; a cock, a hen; and sometimes by pronouns     prefixed, as a he-goat, a, she-goat.         *       *       *       *       *  Of ADJECTIVES.  Adjectives in the English language are wholly indeclinable; having neither case, gender, nor number, and being added to substantives in all relations without any change; as, a good woman, good women, of a good woman; a good man, good men, of good men.  The Comparison of Adjectives.  The comparative degree of adjectives is formed by adding er, the superlative by adding est, to the positive; as, fair, fairer, fairest; lovely, lovelier, loveliest; sweet, sweeter, sweetest; low, lower, lowest; high, higher, highest.  Some words are irregularly compared; as, good, better, best; bad, worse, worst; little, less, least; near, nearer, next; much, more, most; many (for moe), more (for moer) most (for moest); late, later, latest or last.  Some comparatives form a superlative by adding, most, as nether, nethermost; outer, outermost; under, undermost; up, upper, uppermost; fore, former, foremost.  Most is sometimes added to a substantive, as, topmost, southmost.  Many adjectives do not admit of comparison by terminations, and are only compared by more and most, as, benevolent, more benevolent, most benevolent.  All adjectives may be compared by more and most, even when they have comparatives and superlatives regularly formed; as, fair, fairer, or more fair; fairest, or most fair.      In adjectives that admit a regular comparison, the comparative more is     oftener used than the superlative most, as more fair is oftener written     for fairer, than most fair for fairest.  The comparison of adjectives is very uncertain; and being much regulated by commodiousness of utterance, or agreeableness of sound, is not easily reduced to rules.  Monosyllables are commonly compared.  Polysyllables, or words of more than two syllables, are seldom compared otherwise than by more and most, as, deplorable, more deplorable, most deplorable.  Dissyllables are seldom compared if they terminate in some, as fulsome, toilsome; in ful, as, careful, spleenful, dreadful; in ing, as trifling, charming; in ous, as porous; in less, as, careless, harmless; in ed, as wretched; in id, as candid; in al, as mortal; in ent, as recent, fervent; in ain, as certain; in ive, as missive; in dy, as woody; in fy, as puffy; in ky, as rocky, except lucky; in my, as roomy; in ny, as skinny; in py, as ropy, except happy; in ry, as hoary.      Some comparatives and superlatives are yet found in good writers formed     without regard to the foregoing rules; but in a language subjected so     little and so lately to grammar, such anomalies must frequently occur.  So shady is compared by Milton.      She in shadiest covert hid,   Tun'd her nocturnal note.       Par. Lost.  And virtuous.      What she wills to say or do,   Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.       Par. Lost.  So trifling by Ray, who is indeed of no great authority.      It is not so decorous, in respect of God, that he should immediately do     all the meanest and triflingest things himself, without making use of     any inferior or subordinate minister. Ray on the Creation.  Famous, by Milton.      I shall be nam'd among the famousest   Of women, sung at solemn festivals.       Milton's Agonistes.  Inventive, by Ascham.      Those have the inventivest heads for all purposes, and roundest tongues     in all matters. Ascham's Schoolmaster.  Mortal, by Bacon.      The mortalest poisons practised by the West Indians, have some mixture     of the blood, fat, or flesh of man. Bacon.  Natural, by Wotton.      I will now deliver a few of the properest and naturalest considerations     that belong to this piece. Wotton's Architecture.  Wretched, by Jonson.      The wretcheder are the contemners of all helps; such as presuming on     their own naturals, deride diligence, and mock at terms when they     understand not things. Ben Jonson.  Powerful, by Milton.    We have sustain'd one day in doubtful fight,   What heav'n's great king hath pow'rfullest to send   Against us from about his throne.       Par. Lost.      The termination in ish may be accounted in some sort a degree of     comparison, by which the signification is diminished below the     positive, as black, blackish, or tending to blackness; salt, saltish,     or having a little taste of salt; they therefore admit no comparison.     This termination is seldom added but to words expressing sensible     qualities, nor often to words of above one syllable, and is scarcely     used in the solemn or sublime style.         *       *       *       *       *  Of PRONOUNS.  Pronouns, in the English language, are, I, thou, he, with their plurals, we, ye, they; it, who, which, what, whether, whosoever, whatsoever, my, mine, our, ours, thy, thine, your, yours, his, her, hers, theirs, this, that, other, another, the same, some.  The pronouns personal are irregularly inflected.                   Singular.   Plural.  Nom.             I,          We.  Accus. and       Me,         Us. other oblique cases.  Nom.             Thou,       Ye.  Oblique.         Thee,       You.  You is commonly used in modern writers for ye, particularly in the language of ceremony, where the second person plural is used for the second person singular, You are my friend.                   Singular.   Plural.  Nom.             He,         They,       Applied to masculines.  Oblique.         Him,        Them.  Nom.             She,        They,       Applied to feminines.  Oblique.         Her,        Them.  Nom.             It,         They,       Applied to neuters or things.  Oblique.         Its,        Them.  For it the practice of ancient writers was to use he, and for its, his.  The possessive pronouns, like other adjectives, are without cases or change of termination.  The possessive of the first person is my, mine, our, ours; of the second, thy, thine, your, yours; of the third, from he, his; from she, her, and hers; and in the plural, their, theirs, for both sexes.      Ours, yours, hers, theirs, are used when the substantive preceding is     separated by a verb, as These are our books. These books are ours. Your     children excel ours in stature, but ours surpass yours in learning.      Ours, yours, hers, theirs, notwithstanding their seeming plural     termination, are applied equally to singular and plural substantives,     as, This book is ours. These books are ours.      Mine and thine were formerly used before a vowel, as mine amiable lady:     which though now disused in prose, might be still properly continued in     poetry: they are used as ours and yours, when they are referred to a     substantive preceding, as thy house is larger than mine, but my garden     is more spacious than thine.  Their and theirs are the possessives likewise of they, when they is the plural of it, and are therefore applied to things.  Pronouns relative are, who, which, what, whether, whosoever, whatsoever.  Nom.                     Who.  Gen.                     Whose.  Other oblique cases.     Whom.  Nom.                     Which.  Gen.                     Of which,"]]]
