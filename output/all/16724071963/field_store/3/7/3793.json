Soon we will be eating them on the table. They are not the kind that will keep well all winter, and I am planting that kind now. I am going to win the ten dollar prize by raising a bigger crop of potatoes than you can raise of corn or beans, little ones,\" and he smiled at Hal and Mab.  Then he went on cutting the eyes out of the potatoes, while the children watched him. They saw that each potato chunk had in it two or three of the queer dimple-spots.  \"A potato is not like other things that grow in the garden,\" said Uncle Pennywait. \"It does not have its seeds separate from it, as beans have theirs in a pod, or as corn has its kernels or seeds on a cob, or a pumpkin or apple has seeds inside it. A potato's seeds are part of itself, buried in the white part that we cook for the table, and each potato has in it many seeds or eyes.  \"Of course I could plant whole potatoes, one in each hill, but that would be wasting seed, so I cut the potatoes up into chunks and plant the little chunks, each one with two or more seeds in it.\"  \"And do you only plant one chunk?\" asked Mab.  \"No, I drop in two or three, according to the size and the number of eyes. This is done so that if one set of seeds doesn't grow the other will. Now you watch me.\"  Uncle Pennywait had smoothed off a nice bit of his garden where, as yet, he had planted nothing, and into the long earth-rows of this he now began to plant his potato seed. He walked along the rows with a bag of the cut-up pieces hung around his neck, and as he dropped in the white chunks he covered them with dirt by using a hoe.  \"When my potatoes grow up into nice green vines, and the striped bugs come to have a feast on them, you may help me drive the bad creatures away,\" said Uncle Pennywait to the children. \"In fact some of my early potatoes need looking after now.\"  \"Are there bugs on them?\" asked Mab, when her uncle had finished his planting.  \"Indeed there are! Come and I'll show you.\"  Over they went to the early-potato part of Uncle Pennywait's garden. There, on many of the green vines, were a lot of blackish and yellowish bugs, crawling and eating the leaves.  \"We'll just give them a dinner of Paris Green,\" said Uncle Pennywait, \"and they won't eat any more of my vines.\"  \"What's Paris Green?\" asked Mab.  \"It is a deadly poison, for grown folks or children as well as bugs, and you must never touch it, or handle it, unless I am with you, or your father is near,\" said Uncle Pennywait. \"Here is some of it.\"  He showed the children a bright, green powder, some of which he stirred into a sprinkling pot full of water. This water he sprayed over the potato vines.  \"The poison in the water goes on the potato leaves,\" explained Uncle Pennywait, \"and when the bugs eat the leaves they also eat the poison, and die. We have to kill them or they would eat away the leaves of the vines until they all died, and we would have no potatoes. The potato bugs are very harmful, and we must get rid of them.\"  Then he let Hal and Mab sprinkle the potato vines with the Paris Green, afterward making the children carefully wash their hands so there would be no danger.  \"Is that the only way to drive away the potato bugs?\" asked Hal.  \"Sometimes farmers go through their potato field and knock the bugs from the vines into a can full of kerosene oil,\" said Uncle Pennywait, \"or they may use another poison instead of Paris Green. But the bugs must be killed if we are to have potatoes.\"  Just then Mab saw Aunt Lolly going into her garden with a bottle in her hand.  \"Are you going to poison bugs too?\" asked the little girl.  \"No, I am going to make a cucumber grow inside this,\" was the answer.  \"Make a cucumber grow in a bottle?\" exclaimed Hal. \"Why, how funny!\"  \"Let's go see!\" cried Mab, and together they ran over to Aunt Lolly's garden.     CHAPTER VI  THE CORN SILK   \"Maybe this is another joke, like the eyes of the potatoes,\" said Hal to his sister, as they ran along.  \"That wasn't a joke--the eyes were REAL, though they couldn't see nor blink at you,\" Mab answered.  \"The potato eyes must see a little, else how could they find their way to grow up out of the dark ground?\" Hal wanted to know.  \"Well, my beans didn't have any eyes, and they grew up,\" Mab answered. \"Even if they did grow upside down, or I thought they did,\" and she laughed. \"But let's see what Aunt Lolly is doing.\"  Uncle Pennywait's wife was out among the cucumber vines now. She had planted them about the same time Hal had put in the five kernels of corn in each hill.  Aunt Lolly's cucumber seeds had also been planted in hills, so there would be a raised mound of earth for the roots to keep moist in, and in order that the vines, at the start, would be raised up from the other ground around them. Now the cucumber plants were quite lengthy, running along over their part of the garden, and in some places there were growing tiny little pickles--or they would be pickles, when put in salt, vinegar and spices.  \"Are you really going to make a cucumber grow in a bottle?\" asked Mab as she saw her aunt, with a bottle in her hand, stooping over one of the vines.  \"I really am,\" was the answer. \"It is only a little trick, though, and really does no good. But I thought you children would like to see it.\"  \"How are you going to do it?\" asked Hal.  \"You see this little cucumber, or pickle,\" spoke Aunt Lolly, and she showed one to Hal and Mab. \"Well now I'm going to slip it inside this bottle, but not pull the pickle from the vine. If I did that the cucumber would stop growing and die.\"  She had a bottle with a neck large enough so the pickle would go in it. The bottle was an odd shape.  \"The pickle will grow large and completely fill the bottle,\" went on Aunt Lolly. \"It will grow because it is not broken off the stem, and the bottle, being glass, will let in the sunshine. The neck is also large enough so air can get in, for without air, sunlight and the food it gets through the stem the pickle would not live.  \"But as it grows it will swell and fill every part of the bottle and it also will grow just to the shape of the bottle, so that in the Fall, when it can't grow any more, because of the strong glass, I can break the bottle and I will have a pickle shaped just like it, curves, queer twists and everything else.\"  \"Oh, how funny!\" cried Hal \"I wonder if I could grow an ear of corn in a bottle?\"  \"No,\" answered his aunt. \"An ear of corn has to grow inside the husk, and you could not, very well, put a bottle over that.\"  \"Could I over one of my beans?\" asked Mab.  \"Well, you might, but it would have to be a very long and thin bottle, for a bean is that shape when it has grown as large as it will ever get. So I don't believe I'd try it, if I were you. Ill let you each have one of my pickles to grow inside a bottle.\"  Hal and Mab thought this would be fun so they found other bottles with which to do the funny trick of making cucumbers grow inside the glass.  \"I wish Daddy would give a prize for the funniest shaped cucumber,\" said Mab, when she had fixed her bottle with a pickle inside it.  \"Maybe he will,\" spoke her brother. \"We'll ask him.\"  But when Daddy Blake came home that evening he had a package in his arms, and the children were so interested about what might be in it that they forgot to ask for the cucumber prize.  \"What are you going to do now?\" asked Mab.  \"I'm going to take you and Hal down to the garden and show you how to set out cabbage plants,\" said Daddy Blake.  \"But we've got some cabbage plants!\" cried Hal.  \"Yes, I know. But these are a kind that will get a head, or be riper, later in the Fall. This is Winter cabbage that we will keep down cellar, and have to eat when there is snow on the ground, for cabbage is very good and healthful. We can eat it raw, or made into sauer-kraut or have it boiled with potatoes. We must save some cabbage for Winter and that is the kind I am going to plant now.\"  \"And may we help?\" asked Mab.  \"Yes, come on to the garden.\"  Daddy Blake had asked Uncle Pennywait, that day, to smooth off a plowed and harrowed place ready for the cabbage plants to be put in that evening, and the long rows, dug in the brown soil, were now waiting.  \"Where did you get the cabbage plants?\" Mab wanted to know. \"Did you grow them in a little box down at your office, Daddy, as we did the tomatoes here?\"  \"No, Mab, not quite that way, though I might have done that if I had had room. I bought these cabbage plants in the market on my way home. Some farmers, with lots of ground, plant the cabbage seed early in the spring in what are called 'hot-frames.' That is they are like our tomato boxes only larger, and they are kept out of doors. But over the top are glass windows, so the cold air can not get in. But the warm sun shines through the glass as it did through our tomato box, and soon the cabbage seeds begin to sprout.  \"Then the plants grow larger and larger, until they are strong enough to be set out, as the tomatoes were. In this way you can grow the vegetables better than if you waited until it was warm enough to put the seed right out in the garden, and let the plants grow up there from the beginning. Putting the seeds in the hot frame gives them a good start. Now we'll set out the cabbage plants, and you may both help.\"  Daddy Blake gave Hal and Mab each a small handful of the little cabbage plants, some of which had two and others three light green leaves on. There were also small roofs, with a little wet dirt clinging to them, from where they had been pulled out of their early home in which they first grew.  \"Oh, Hal! That isn't the way to do it!\" cried Daddy Blake, when he had watched his little boy walking along the cabbage row for a while, dropping the plants, the roots of which were afterward to be covered with the brown earth.  \"Why not?\" Hal asked.  \"Because you must only drop ONE plant in a place. You are letting two and three fall at once. You"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14859"],["title","Daddy Takes Us to the Garden (#8)"],["body","'t make a bouquet of them,\" and his father laughed. \"Only one cabbage plant in a spot.\"  \"Am I doing it right?\" asked Mab, who was on the other side of the cabbage plot.  \"Well, not exactly. Hal dropped his too close together and yours are too far apart. The cabbage plants ought to be about two and a half feet apart, in rows and the rows should be separate one from the other by about twenty inches. Here, I'll cut you each a little stick for a measure. You don't need to worry about the rows, as Uncle Pennywait marked them just the right distance apart as he made them.\"  So after that Hal and Mab measured, with sticks Daddy Blake gave them to get one cabbage plant just as far from the one next to it in the row as Daddy Blake wanted. Then, with a hoe, the children's father covered the roots with dirt and the cabbages were planted, or \"set out,\" as the gardener calls it.  \"Now let me take a look at your corn and beans,\" said Mr. Blake to the two children, when the cabbages had been left to grow. \"I want to see who has the best chance of winning that ten dollar gold prize.\"  \"Hal's corn is very nice,\" said Mab.  \"And so are her beans,\" added Mab's brother kindly. \"I guess maybe she'll get the prize.\"  \"Well, it will be quite a little while before we can tell,\" spoke Daddy Blake. \"Corn and beans will not be gathered until Fall, though we may eat some of Hal's corn earlier, for he has some rows of the sweet variety which can be boiled and gnawed off the ears.\"  Daddy Blake found a few places in Mab's bean patch where the useless weeds needed hoeing away, so they would not steal from the brown earth the food which the good plants needed.  \"And one or two of your corn hills could be made a little higher, Hal,\" said his father. \"If you look at the corn stalks you will see, down near where they are in the ground, some little extra roots coming out above the earth. In order that these roots may reach the soil, and take hold, the dirt must be hoed up to them.\"  Mr. Blake showed the children what he meant, and Mab cried:  \"Those roots are just like the ropes we had on our tent when we went camping.\"  \"That's it,\" said Daddy Blake. \"These roots keep the tall corn stalks from blowing over just as the ropes keep the tent from falling down.\"  \"Oh, look!\" cried Mab, as she passed one stalk of corn that was larger than any of the others. \"There's something growing on this that's just like my doll's hair. I'm going to pull it off.\"  \"No, you mustn't do that,\" her father said. \"That is corn silk.\"  \"Oh, I know what it is,\" said Hal. \"It's brown stuff and sometimes when you're eating corn it gets in your mouth and tickles you.\"  \"Corn silk isn't brown until it gets old and dried,\" said his father. \"At first it is a light green, like this. And the silk is really part of the corn blossom.\"  \"I didn't know corn had a blossom,\" said Mab.  \"Yes,\" said her father, \"it has. Part of the blossom is up top here, on these things that look like long fingers sticking out,\" and he pointed to the upper part of the stalk. \"On these fingers grows a sort of fine dust, called pollen, and unless this falls down from the top of the corn stalk, and rests on the silk which grows out from the ear, there would be no more corn seed. Or, if corn seed, or kernels, did form on the ear, they would be lifeless, and when planted next year no corn would grow from them. The pollen dust and the silk must mingle together to make perfect ears of corn, so don't pull off the silk, even if you do want to make it into hair for your doll.\"  Mab promised she would not, though she loved the feel of the soft corn silk. Then she and Hal noticed where some of the light yellow pollen had already been blown by the wind down on the silk to help make the perfect ear of corn.  As the children walked along through the garden with Daddy Blake they heard voices over the fence where Mr. Porter lived. Then they heard Sammie calling:  \"Oh, Daddy! Look what I got! It's a big green bug, an' Roly-Poly is barkin' at him! Come quick!\"  \"I hope Roly-Poly isn't making any more trouble as he did with the fly paper,\" said Mr. Blake as he walked toward the fence.     CHAPTER VII  EARLY TOMATOES   \"What's the matter, Mr. Porter?\" asked Mr. Blake, looking over the fence where Sammie's father was working in his garden. \"Has our little poodle dog been scratching up your plants?\"  \"Oh, no. Roly is very good. He seems to know we want the thing's in our gardens to grow, and he only walks carefully between the rows, and doesn't scratch a bit,\" answered the neighbor.  \"What is he barking at now?\" asked Mab, for the little poodle dog had crawled under the fence and had gone next door, as he often did. He was standing near red-haired Sammie now.  \"He's barkin' at a big, green bug,\" said the little boy.  \"A green bug; eh?\" spoke Mr. Porter. \"Maybe we'd better see what it is,\" he added, speaking to Daddy Blake.  \"I rather think we had. There are so many bugs, worms and other things trying to spoil our gardens, that we must not let any of them get away.\"  \"He's a awful big bug, almost as long as Roly's tail,\" called Sammie from where he stood near a tomato plant.  \"Well, Roly's tail isn't very big,\" laughed Daddy Blake. \"But a bug or worm of that size could eat a lot of plant leaves.\"  \"Don't touch it--Daddy will kill it!\" called Mr. Porter to his little boy. But Sammie had no idea of touching the queer bug he had seen, and at which the poodle dog was barking.  \"Oh, it's one of the big green tomato worms!\" exclaimed Mr. Blake when he saw it. \"They can do a lot of damage. I hope they don't get in my garden. We must kill as many as we can,\" and he knocked the worm to the ground and stepped on it. Roly-Poly barked harder than ever at this, thinking, perhaps, that he had helped get rid of the unpleasant, crawling thing.  \"We'll look over your tomato patch and see if there are any more worms,\" suggested Mr. Blake to his neighbor.  \"Yes, and then I'll come and help you clear your plants of the pests,\" said Mr. Porter. \"We want to have our gardens good this year, so we won't have to spend so many of our pennies for food next Winter.\"  A few more of the green worms were found on the tomato vines, and there were more on Daddy Blake's. So many were found that he could not be sure he had knocked them all off.  \"I think I will have to spray the plants with Paris Green as I did the potatoes,\" he said. \"The tomatoes will not be ready to pick--even the earliest--for some weeks and by that time the poison will have been washed off by the rain.\"  \"Making a garden is lots of work\" said Hal, next day, when he and Mab had helped their father spray the tomato plants.  \"Yes, indeed,\" agreed Mr. Blake. \"But, like everything else in this world, you can't have anything without working for it.\"  \"I thought all you had to do in a garden,\" said Mab, \"was to plant the seed and it would grow into cabbage, radishes, corn, beans or whatever you wanted.\"  \"You are beginning to learn otherwise,\" spoke her father, \"and it is a good thing. Mother Nature is wise and good, but she does not make it too easy for us. She will grow beautiful flowers, and useful fruits and vegetables from tiny seeds, but she also grows bad weeds and sends eating-bugs that we must fight against, if we want things to grow on our farms and gardens. So we still have much work before us to make our gardens a success.\"  \"We haven't had much to eat from them yet,\" said Mother Blake, who had been hoeing among her carrots. \"I hope we can pick something soon.\"  \"We had radishes,\" said Hal.  \"And well soon have tomatoes,\" added his father. \"Now that I have driven away the eating worms the vines will grow better and the tomatoes will ripen faster.\"  A week later on some of the vines there were quite large green tomatoes. Hal and Mab watched them eagerly, noting how they grew and swelled larger, until, one day, Mab came running in, crying:  \"Oh, one tomato has a red cheek!\"  \"That's where it got sunburned,\" said her father with a smile. \"That shows they are getting ripe. Soon we will have some for the table.\"  In a few days more tomatoes on the vines had red, rosy cheeks, some being red all over. These Daddy Blake let Hal and Mab pick, and they brought them in the house.  \"Oh, we shall have some of our own tomatoes for lunch!\" cried Mother Blake when she saw them. \"How fine! Our garden is beginning to give us back something to pay us for all the work we put on it.\"  \"But these are Daddy's tomatoes,\" said Hal. \"He had the first thing, after the radishes, for the table from his garden, and Mab and I haven't anything. Daddy'll get his own prize.\"  \"No, I promise you I will not take the prize for these tomatoes, even if I did raise them in my part of the garden,\" said Daddy Blake with a smile. \"And I won't count the radishes we had before the tomatoes were ripe, either. Those belonged to all of us.  \"The prize isn't going to be given away until all the crops are harvested, or brought in, and then we'll see who has the most and the best of things that will keep over Winter.\"  \"Can you keep tomatoes all Winter?\" asked Mab of her father.  \"Well, no, not exactly. But Mother can put them into cans, after they have been cooked, and she can make ketchup and spices of them--chili sauce and the like--as well as pickles, so, after all, you might say my tomatoes will last all Winter.  \"Sometimes you can keep tomatoes fresh for quite a while down in a cool, dry cellar, if you pull the vines up by the roots, with the tomatoes still on them, and cover the roots with dirt. But they will not keep quite all Winter, I believe. At any rate I'm not going to keep ours that way. We'll can them.\"  Mother Blake sliced the garden tomatoes for supper. She also made a dressing for them, with oil, vinegar and spices, though Hal and Mab liked their tomatoes best with just salt on.  \"Tomatoes are not only good to eat--I mean they taste good--but they are healthful for one,\" said Daddy Blake. \"It is not so many years "]]]
