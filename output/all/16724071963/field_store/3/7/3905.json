Men were chased, beaten and killed by white brutes, who boasted of their crimes, and the murderers still walk the streets of New Orleans, well known and absolutely exempt from prosecution. Not only were they exempt from prosecution by the police while the town was in the hands of the mob, but even now that law and order is supposed to resume control, these men, well known, are not now, nor ever will be, called to account for the unspeakable brutalities of that terrible week. On the other hand, the colored men who were beaten by the police and dragged into the station for purposes of intimidation, were quickly called up before the courts and fined or sent to jail upon the statement of the police. Instances of Louisiana justice as it is dispensed in New Orleans are here quoted from the _Times-Democrat_ of July 26:    +Justice Dealt Out to Folk Who Talked Too Much+    All the Negroes and whites who were arrested in the vicinity of   Tuesday's tragedy had a hard time before Recorder Hughes yesterday. Lee   Jackson was the first prisoner, and the evidence established that he   made his way to the vicinity of the crime and told his Negro friends   that he thought a good many more policemen ought to be killed. Jackson   said he was drunk when he made the remark. He was fined $25 or thirty   days.    John Kennedy was found wandering about the street Tuesday night with an   open razor in his hand, and he was given $25 or thirty days.    Edward McCarthy, a white man, who arrived only four days since from New   York, went to the scene of the excitement at the corner of Third and   Rampart Streets, and told the Negroes that they were as good as any   white man. This remark was made by McCarthy, as another white man said   the Negroes should be lynched. McCarthy told the recorder that he   considered a Negro as good as a white in body and soul. He was fined $25   or thirty days.    James Martin, Simon Montegut, Eddie McCall, Alex Washington and Henry   Turner were up for failing to move on. Martin proved that he was at the   scene to assist the police and was discharged. Montegut, being a   cripple, was also released, but the others were fined $25 or thirty days   each.    Eddie Williams for refusing to move on was given $25 or thirty days.    Matilda Gamble was arrested by the police for saying that two officers   were killed and it was a pity more were not shot. She was given $25 or   thirty days.   +INSOLENT BLACKS+  \"Recorder Hughes received Negroes in the first recorder's office yesterday morning in a way that they will remember for a long time, and all of them were before the magistrate for having caused trouble through incendiary remarks concerning the death of Captain Day and Patrolman Lamb.\"  \"Lee Jackson was before the recorder and was fined $25 or thirty days. He was lippy around where the trouble happened Tuesday morning, and some white men punched him good and hard and the police took him. Then the recorder gave him a dose, and now he is in the parish prison.\"  \"John Kennedy was another black who got into trouble. He said that the shooting of the police by Charles was a good thing, and for this he was pounded. Patrolman Lorenzo got him and saved him from being lynched, for the black had an open razor. He was fined $25 or thirty days.\"  \"Edward McCarthy, a white man, mixed up with the crowd, and an expression of sympathy nearly cost him his head, for some whites about started for him, administering licks and blows with fists and umbrellas. The recorder fined him $25 or thirty days. He is from New York.\"  \"Then James Martin, a white man, and Simon Montegut, Eddie Call, Henry Turner and Alex Washington were before the magistrate for having failed to move on when the police ordered them from the square where the bluecoats were Tuesday, waiting in the hope of catching Charles. All save Martin and Montegut were fined.\"  \"Eddie Williams, a little Negro who was extremely fresh with the police, was fined $10 or ten days.\"   +SHOCKING BRUTALITY+  The whole city was at the mercy of the mob and the display of brutality was a disgrace to civilization. One instance is described in the _Picayune_ as follows:    A smaller party detached itself from the mob at Washington and Rampart   Streets, and started down the latter thoroughfare. One of the foremost   spied a Negro, and immediately there was a rush for the unfortunate   black man. With the sticks they had torn from fences on the line of   march the young outlaws attacked the black and clubbed him unmercifully,   acting more like demons than human beings. After being severely beaten   over the head, the Negro started to run with the whole gang at his   heels. Several revolvers were brought into play and pumped their lead at   the refugee. The Negro made rapid progress and took refuge behind the   blinds of a little cottage in Rampart Street, but he had been seen, and   the mob hauled him from his hiding place and again commenced beating   him. There were more this time, some twenty or thirty, all armed with   sticks and heavy clubs, and under their incessant blows the Negro could   not last long. He begged for mercy, and his cries were most pitiful, but   a mob has no heart, and his cries were only answered with more blows.    \"For God's sake, boss, I ain't done nothin'. Don't kill me. I swear I   ain't done nothin'.\"    The white brutes turned  +  A DEAF EAR TO THE PITYING CRIES+    of the black wretch and the drubbing continued. The cries subsided into   moans, and soon the black swooned away into unconsciousness. Still not   content with their heartless work, they pulled the Negro out and kicked   him into the gutter. For the time those who had beaten the black seemed   satisfied and left him groaning in the gutter, but others came up, and,   regretting that they had not had a hand in the affair, they determined   to evidence their bravery to their fellows and beat the man while he was   in the gutter, hurling rocks and stones at his black form. One   thoughtless white brute, worse even than the black slayer of the police   officers, thought to make himself a hero in the eyes of his fellows and   fired his revolver repeatedly into the helpless wretch. It was dark and   the fellow probably aimed carelessly. After firing three or four shots   he also left without knowing what extent of injury he inflicted on the   black wretch who was left lying in the gutter.    +MURDER ON THE LEVEE+   One part of the crowd made a raid on the tenderloin district, hoping to find there some belated Negro for a sacrifice. They were urged on by the white prostitutes, who applauded their murderous mission. Says an account:    The red light district was all excitement. Women--that is, the white   women--were out on their stoops and peeping over their galleries and   through their windows and doors, shouting to the crowd to go on with   their work, and kill Negroes for them.    \"Our best wishes, boys,\" they encouraged; and the mob answered with   shouts, and whenever a Negro house was sighted a bombardment was started   on the doors and windows.  No colored men were found on the streets until the mob reached Custom House Place and Villiers Streets. Here a victim was found and brutally put to death. The _Picayune_ description is as follows:    Some stragglers had run a Negro into a car at the corner of Bienville   and Villere Streets. He was seeking refuge in the conveyance, and he   believed that the car would not be stopped and could speed along. But   the mob determined to stop the car, and ordered the motorman to halt. He   put on his brake. Some white men were in the car.    \"Get out, fellows,\" shouted several of the mob.    \"All whites fall out,\" was the second cry, and the poor Negro understood   that it was meant that he should stay in the car.    He wanted to save his life. The poor fellow crawled under the seats. But   some one in the crowd saw him and yelled that he was hiding. Two or   three men climbed through the windows with their pistols; others jumped   over the motorman's board, and dozens tumbled into the rear of the car.   Big, strong hands got the Negro by the shirt. He was dragged out of the   conveyance, and was pushed to the street. Some fellow ran up and struck   him with a club. The blow was heavy, but it did not fell him, and the   Negro ran toward Canal Street, stealing along the wall of the Tulane   Medical Building. Fifty men ran after him, caught the poor fellow and   hurried him back into the crowd. Fists were aimed at him, then clubs   went upon his shoulders, and finally the black plunged into the gutter.    A gun was fired, and the Negro, who had just gotten to his feet, dropped   again. He tried to get up, but a volley was sent after him, and in a   little while he was dead.    The crowd looked on at the terrible work. Then the lights in the houses   of ill-fame began to light up again, and women peeped out of the blinds.   The motorman was given the order to go on. The gong clanged and the   conveyance sped out of the way. For half an hour the crowd held their   place at the corner, then the patrol wagon came and the body was picked   up and hurried to the morgue.    Coroner Richard held an autopsy on the body of the Negro who was forced   out of car 98 of the Villere line and shot down. It was found that he   was wounded four times, the most serious wound being that which struck   him in the right side, passing through the lungs, and causing   hemorrhages, which brought about death.    Nobody tried to identify the poor fellow and his name is unknown.   +A VICTIM IN THE MARKET+   Soon after the murder of the man on the street car many of the same mob marched down to the market place. There they found a colored market man named Louis Taylor, who had gone to begin his early morning's work. He was at once set upon by the mob and killed. The _Picayune_ account says:    Between 1 and 2 o'clock this morning a mob of several hundred men"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14976"],["title","Mob Rule in New Orleans (#7)"],["body","boys, made up of participants in many of the earlier affairs, marched on   the French Market. Louis Taylor, a Negro vegetable carrier, who is about   thirty years of age, was sitting at the soda water stand. As soon as the   mob saw him fire was opened and the Negro took to his heels. He ran   directly into another section of the mob and any number of shots were   fired at him. He fell, face down, on the floor of the market.    The police in the neighborhood rallied hurriedly and found the victim of   mob violence seemingly lifeless. Before they arrived the Negro had been   beaten severely about the head and body. The ambulance was summoned and   Taylor was carried to the charity hospital, where it was found that he   had been shot through the abdomen and arm. The examination was a hurried   one, but it sufficed to show that Taylor was mortally wounded.    After shooting Taylor the members of the mob were pluming themselves on   their exploit. \"The Nigger was at the soda water stand and we commenced   shooting him,\" said one of the rioters. \"He put his hands up and ran,   and we shot until he fell. I understand that he is still alive. If he   is, he is a wonder. He was certainly shot enough to be killed.\"    The members of the mob readily admitted that they had taken part in the   assaults which marked the earlier part of the evening.    \"We were up on Jackson Avenue and killed a Nigger on Villere Street. We   came down here, saw a nigger and killed him, too.\" This was the way they   told the story.    \"Boys, we are out of ammunition,\" said someone.    \"Well, we will keep on like we are, and if we can't get some before   morning, we will take it. We have got to keep this thing up, now we have   started.\"    This declaration was greeted by a chorus of applauding yells, and the   crowd started up the levee. Half of the men in the crowd, and they were   all of them young, were drunk.    Taylor, when seen at the charity hospital, was suffering greatly, and   presented a pitiable spectacle. His clothing was covered with blood, and   his face was beaten almost into a pulp. He said that he had gone to the   market to work and was quietly sitting down when the mob came and began   to fire on him. He was not aware at first that the crowd was after him.   When he saw its purpose he tried to run, but fell. He didn't know any of   the men in the crowd. There is hardly a chance that Taylor will recover.    The police told the crowd to move on, but no attempt was made to arrest   anyone.   +A GRAY-HAIRED VICTIM+  The bloodthirsty barbarians, having tasted blood, continued their hunt and soon ran across an old man of seventy-five years. His life had been spent in hard work about the French market, and he was well known as an unoffending, peaceable and industrious old man.  But that made no difference to the mob. He was a Negro, and with a fiendishness that was worse than that of cannibals they beat his life out. The report says:    There was another gang of men parading the streets in the lower part of   the city, looking for any stray Negro who might be on the streets. As   they neared the corner of Dauphine and Kerlerec, a square below   Esplanade Avenue, they came upon Baptiste Thilo, an aged Negro, who   works in the French Market.    Thilo for years has been employed by the butchers and fish merchants to   carry baskets from the stalls to the wagons, and unload the wagons as   they arrive in the morning. He was on his way to the market, when the   mob came upon him. One of the gang struck the old Negro, and as he fell,   another in the crowd, supposed to be a young fellow, fired a shot. The   bullet entered the body just below the right nipple.    As the Negro fell the crowd looked into his face and they discovered   then that the victim was very old. The young man who did the shooting   said: \"Oh, he is an old Negro. I'm sorry that I shot him.\"    This is all the old Negro received in the way of consolation.    He was left where he fell, but later staggered to his feet and made his   way to the third precinct station. There the police summoned the   ambulance and the students pronounced the wound very dangerous. He was   carried to the hospital as rapidly as possible.    There was no arrest.  Just before daybreak the mob found another victim. He, too, was on his way to market, driving a meat wagon. But little is told of his treatment, nothing more than the following brief statement:    At nearly 3 o'clock this morning a report was sent to the Third Precinct   station that a Negro was lying on the sidewalk at the corner of Decatur   and St. Philip. The man had been pulled off of a meat wagon and riddled   with bullets.    When the police arrived he was insensible and apparently dying. The   ambulance students attended the Negro and pronounced the wounds fatal.    There was nothing found which would lead to the discovery of his   identity.   +FUN IN GRETNA+  If there are any persons so deluded as to think that human life in the South is valued any more than the life of a brute, he will be speedily undeceived by reading the accounts of unspeakable barbarism committed by the mob in and around New Orleans. In no other civilized country in the world, nay, more, in no land of barbarians would it be possible to duplicate the scenes of brutality that are reported from New Orleans. In the heat of blind fury one might conceive how a mad mob might beat and kill a man taken red-handed in a brutal murder. But it is almost past belief to read that civilized white people, men who boast of their chivalry and blue blood, actually had fun in beating, chasing and shooting men who had no possible connection with any crime.  But this actually happened in Gretna, a few miles from New Orleans. In its description of the scenes of Tuesday night, the _Picayune_ mentions the brutal chase of several colored men whom the mob sought to kill. In the instances mentioned, the paper said:    Gretna had its full share of excitement between 8 and 11 o'clock last   night, in connection with a report that spread through the town that a   Negro resembling the slayer of Police Captain Day, of New Orleans, had   been seen on the outskirts of the place.    It is true that a suspicious-looking Negro was observed by the residents   of Madison and Amelia Streets lurking about the fences of that   neighborhood just after dark, and shortly before 8 o'clock John Fist, a   young white man, saw the Negro on Fourth Street. He followed the darkey   a short distance, and, coming upon Robert Moore, who is known about town   as the \"black detective,\" Fist pointed the Negro out and Moore at once   made a move toward the stranger. The latter observed Moore making in his   direction, and, without a word, he sped in the direction of the Brooklyn   pasture, Moore following and firing several shots at him. In a few   minutes a half hundred white men, including Chief of Police Miller,   Constable Dannenhauer, Patrolman Keegan and several special officers,   all well-armed, joined in the chase, but in the darkness the Negro   escaped.    Just as the pursuing party reached town again, two of the residents of   Lafayette Avenue, Peter Leson and Robert Henning, reported that they had   just chased and shot at a Negro, who had been seen in the yard of the   former's house. They were positive the Negro had not escaped from the   square. Their report was enough to set the appetite of the crowd on   edge, and the square was quickly surrounded, while several dozens of   men, armed with lanterns and revolvers, made a search of every yard and   under every house in the square. No Negro was found.    The crowd of armed men was constantly swelling, and at 10 o'clock it had   reached the proportions of a small army. At 10:30 o'clock an outbound   freight train is due to pass through Gretna on the Texas and Pacific   Road, and the crowd, believing that Captain Day's slayer might be aboard   one of the cars attempting to leave the scene of his crime, resolved to   inspect the train. As the train stopped at the Madison Street crossing   the engineer was requested to pull very slowly through the town, in   order that the trucks of the cars might be examined. There was a string   of armed men on each side of the railroad track and in a few moments a   Negro was espied riding between two cars. A half dozen weapons were   pointed at him and he was ordered to come out. He sprang out with   alacrity and was pounced upon almost before he reached the ground.   Robert Moore grabbed him and pushed an ugly-looking Derringer under his   nose and the Negro threw up both hands. Constable Dannenhauer and   Patrolman Keegan took charge of him and hustled him off to jail, where   he was locked up. The Negro does not at all resemble Robert Charles, but   it was best for his sake that he was placed under lock and key. The   crowd was not in a humor to let any Negro pass muster last night. The   prisoner gave his name as Luke Wallace.    But now came the real excitement. The train had slowed down almost to a   standstill, in the very heart of town. Somebody shouted: \"There he goes,   on top of the train!\" And sure enough, somebody was going. It was a   Negro, too, and he was making a bee-line for the front end of the train.   A veritable shower of bullets, shot and rifle balls greeted the flying   form, but on it sped. The locomotive had stopped in the middle of the   square between La voisier and Newton Streets, and the Negro, flying with   the speed of the wind along the top of the cars, reached the first car   of the train and jumped to the tender and then into the cab. As he did   several white men standing at the locomotive made a rush into the cab.   The Negro sprang swiftly out of the other side, on to the sidewalk. But   there were several more men, and as he realized that he was rushing   right into their arms he made a spring to leap over the fence of Mrs.   Linden's home, on the wood side of the"]]]
