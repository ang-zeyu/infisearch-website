In the creeping night the black winds cry.   The daylight comes like a stifled sigh.   The hearths gleam red, while the long smoke   Crawls up to a grayer sky.     Winter Winds    Like a hard cruel lash the long lean winds             are laid on the back of the land,     Curling over the breast of the hills and cutting             the feet of the plain,   Till the naked limbs of the forest host cringe             at the lift of the hand,     And the white-ribbed waves on the granite shore             moan and sob in their pain.    Never a sail on that sharp straight line             that marks the steel of the sky;     Never a wing flees in from death to crouch             in the rattling reeds;   In the shaggy heads of the black coast pines             the frozen spume drives high;     And even the hand of the leering sun lies cold             on the tattered weeds.    A month ago and the warm winds ran over the stalks             of gold,     With the grass-heads wet in the morning mists             and the daisies topped with bees;   And now the last of the year lies dead,             the world walks bent, and old,     And only the bitter lash of the wind sweeps             in from the iron seas.     Dead Days    The haws cling to the thorn,   Shrivelled and red;   The limbs long dead   Clutch at a leaf long torn--   It taps all day on the spikes   As the spume licks over the dikes.    The reeds creak in the dawn   By the dead pond;   Dry tongues respond   From grasses yellow and drawn;   And ever scourged by the wind,   The alders clatter and grind.    Vines furred with the frost   String from the wall:   Their bones recall   Summer leaves long lost,   Cricket and fly and bee   And their low melody.    No bird wails to the waste   Of scentless snow,   Where streaming low   The steel-blue shadows haste;   But through the hard night   The dead moon takes flight     The Winter Harvest    Between the blackened curbs lie stacked the             harvest of the skies,     Long lines of frozen, grimy cocks befouled             by city feet;   On either side the racing throngs, the crowding             cliffs, the cries,     And ceaseless winds that eddy down to whip             the iron street.    The wagons whine beneath their loads, the             raw-boned horses strain;     A hundred sullen shovels claw and heave the             sodden mass--   There lifts no dust of scented moats, no cheery             call of swain,     Nor birds that pipe from border brush across             the yellow grass.    No cow-bells honk from upland fields, no sunset             thrushes call     To swarthy, bare-limbed harvesters beyond             the stubble roads;   But flanges grind on frosted steel, the weary             snow-picks fall,     And twisted, toiling backs are bent to pile the             bitter loads.    No shouting from the intervales, no singing from             the hill,     No scent of trodden tansy weeds among the             golden grain----,   Only the silent, cringing forms beneath the             aching chill.     Only the hungry eyes of want in haggard             cheeks of pain.     Flowers of the Sky    The snow was four feet deep beyond my door.   (I never knew the cold so cruel before.)   The frost was white as death, and in the wood   Shattered the aching aisles of solitude.   Here lay the winter wrapped about with gloom;   But overhead God's flowers were in bloom!    At dawn, above the ink-black trunks and night,   A pale pink petal drifted with the light;   And presently the gates of sun swung wide,   And through them flowed a crimson, scented tide:   Roses that bloomed and bloomed again and died,   Staining the lonely hills on either side.    And scarce were God's fields swept of this warm glow,   When purest gold fell softly to the snow--   Petals of gold from where there rolled on high   A sea of tulips lapping all the sky.   The blossoms clung so close I could not see   One nook of empty blue where more could be.    Snow and the winds that eat into the bone,   Here where the sun lies cold and waters moan.   God's pastures still are bearing for His feet   A million purple blooms all dewy sweet:   Violets and asters, hyacinths and phlox,   And streaming shafts of starry hollyhocks.    Late in the day when I crawled up the hills,   Dogged by the cold that tortures ere it kills;   I needs must stand and stare beyond the rim,   And watch the garden once more laid for Him;   Until the moon's great dripping calyx came,   And all the myriad star-buds burst in flame.    Then bitter envy gnawed upon my heart.   Flowers in Heaven, and I stand here apart!   \"O God,\" I cried, \"take me from this place,   Where I may feel the warm grass brush my face!\"   Then 'cross the snow a whisper caught my ear:   \"Peace, for the Spring--the Spring once more is here.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14785"],["title","Down the Chimney (#0)"],["body","Team.            Down The Chimney  BY  SHEPHERD KNAPP  [Illustration]    1921  THE HEIDELBERG PRESS          *       *       *       *       *  TO THOSE  WHO FIRST ACTED IN THIS PLAY  TO THOSE WHO WITH SO MUCH SKILL AND PATIENCE  TRAINED THE PARTICIPANTS  AND TO THE FRIENDLY AUDIENCES OF BOYS AND GIRLS  WHO ENCOURAGE US BY THEIR APPLAUSE  IT IS DEDICATED         *       *       *       *       *     Preface   This play is intended, not only for acting, but also for reading. It is so arranged that boys and girls can read it to themselves, just as they would read any other story. Even the stage directions and the descriptions of scenery are presented as a part of the narrative. At the same time, by the use of different styles of type, the speeches of the characters are clearly distinguished from the rest of the text, an arrangement which will be found convenient when parts are being memorized for acting.  The play has been acted more than once, and by different groups of people; sometimes on a stage equipped with footlights, curtain, and scenery; sometimes with barely any of these aids. Practical suggestions as to costumes, scenery, and some simple scenic effects will be found at the end of the play.  What sort of a Christmas play do the boys and girls like, and in what sort do we like to see them take part? It should be a play, surely, in which the dialogue is simple and natural, not stilted and artificial; one that seems like a bit of real life, and yet has plenty of fancy and imagination in it; one that suggests and helps to perpetuate some of the happy and wholesome customs of Christmas; above all, one that is pervaded by the Christmas spirit. I hope that this play does not entirely fail to meet these requirements.  Worcester, Mass.  SHEPHERD KNAPP.         *       *       *       *       *     Down the Chimney   The First Scene   _Now the curtain opens, and you see the Roof of a House, just as Mother Goose promised. Keep your eyes open to see what will happen next, for here comes_ JACK FROST, _who is dressed all in white. He walks with a quick and nimble step, and this is what he says_:  Would you believe from the look of things, that to-morrow is Christmas? There is not a flake of snow anywhere. This roof is as clear as it is in summer. These pine trees, whose boughs hang over the roof, are all green. The chimney has not even an icicle on it. I hear people saying that we have no old-fashioned winters any more. Even old Mother Cary said to me the other day, \"Jack Frost,\" said she, \"when are you going to give them a real snow-storm?\" But I told her not to be impatient: I would attend to it all in good time. And when I do begin, it doesn't take me long to get up a fine old storm, I can tell you. _Now he walks up to the Chimney, and knocks on the side of it_. Say, old fellow. _He waits a moment; then knocks again_. Wake up there. _He waits a moment; then knocks again_. Wake up, I say.  _And now--would you believe it?--the Chimney opens, first, one of his eyes, then the other; and then his mouth and nose appear together. Each of his eyes is exactly the shape and size of one brick. So is his nose. And his mouth is as long as two bricks side by side. They all turn a very bright red, when they appear, as though light were shining through them._  JACK FROST _goes on talking_: What do you mean, Mr. Chimney, by going to sleep in winter, I'd like to know? Summer is the time for you chimneys to go to sleep; but in winter when the people in the houses have their fires burning, you ought to keep wide awake, so as to carry off the smoke; don't you know that? Sleepy head! You ought to be ashamed of yourself.  THE CHIMNEY _answers_: Nothing of the sort. Have you forgotten what night this is, Jack Frost? Don't you know that this is Christmas Eve, when the fires are all put out, so that Santa Claus can climb down without getting burned? That's why I was taking a little nap. See? _He winks with one eye._  JACK FROST _says_: Oh, that's it, is it? Well, that's true enough. I hadn't thought of old Santa Claus. He'll be here before long, probably.  Yes, too soon, _says_ THE CHIMNEY; for I haven't had my sleep half out, and here you are, keeping me awake for nothing. With your kind permission, I'll take another forty winks.  _And now his eyes close, then his nose and mouth disappear, and in a moment he is sound asleep again._  Lazy old fellow! _exclaims_ JACK FROST. Well, I must get to work if we are to have a real old-fashioned storm before morning. And first for some wind. Where are those Wind Fairies, I wonder? They ought to be here by now. _He puts his hands beside his mouth, and calls in a high voice:_ Hoo--oo! Hoo--oo!  THE WIND FAIRIES _are heard from far, far away, calling in answer:_ Hoo-oo! Hoo-oo!  JACK FROST, _as soon as he hears them, says joyfully:_ There they are. They'll be here in a second.  _And now you can hear the Wind Fairies coming gradually nearer, making the wind-noise as the come, like this:_    z--z--z z--z--z z--Z--Z--Z--z--z--z   z--z--z z--z--z z--Z--Z--Z--z--z--z   _This grows louder and louder, till suddenly in come the Wind Fairies, running. They are all in gray; they have on gray peaked caps, gray capes which comes down to their knees, and long gray stockings; and they have gray masks over the upper parts of their faces. The Fairies stop short before Jack Frost, and make him a low bow. Then they sing their song, which is called_   THE SONG OF THE WIND FAIRIES[1]    Do you hear us blow, in our coats of gray?   Do you hear us blow, till the trees rock and sway?   Do you hear us blow--for from far, far away   We have come with a storm for your Christmas.    REFRAIN    Oh, the sound of the wind is strange for to hear;   And the breath of the wind, it is cold and clear;   You'll hear us blow, as we fly thro' the air,   And we've brought you a storm for your Christmas.    You can hear us sigh at the window-pane;   And we moan and cry in the snow and the rain.   Then away we fly, for we may not remain,   But we leave you a storm for your Christmas.    REFRAIN    Oh, the sound of the wind is strange for to hear;   And the breath of the wind, it is cold and clear;   You'll hear us blow, as we fly thro' the air,   And we've brought you a storm for your Christmas.   [Footnote 1: To the tune \"_D' ye ken John Peel?_\"]  _As soon as the song is over, off run the Wind Fairies, making the wind-noise as they go, which grows fainter and fainter as they get further and further away, like this_    Z--Z--Z--z--z--z  z--z--z  z--z--z   Z--Z--Z--z--z--z  z--z--z  z--z--z   _When the sound of the wind has quite died away_, THE CHIMNEY _opens one eye, and speaking slowly and sleepily, says:_ Look here, Jack, something's going on in my inside. _He opens the other eye, and his nose and mouth appear. He speaks more briskly_: It feels as though there were something hot in there. Do you suppose those stupid people in the house down below have forgotten all about Santa Claus, and are lighting the fire on the hearth? I believe they are. I wish you'd just climb up on my shoulder, and shout down to them to stop. Do: there's a good fellow.  JACK FROST _climbs up, puts his head over the chimney, then draws back coughing_. Fire? _cries he_. I should say there was, and smoke, too; enough to choke a locomotive. _He cautiously peers down_. Hello there, you people, put that fire out. Do you hear? Put it out. Santa Claus is coming. Do you hear what I say? SANTA CLAUS IS COMING. Put out that fire.  _There is a pause; then a hissing sound, loud at first, then dying away, like this_:    S--S--S--s--s--s--s--s--s   There! _says_ JACK FROST, they've thrown a pitcherful of water on it. _He climbs down from the chimney_.  THE CHIMNEY, _who has now grown sleepy again, says to him, in a voice that grows fainter and fainter_: Thank you, my dear fellow: you--real--ly (_Here one eye closes_) are--ver--y--ki--_And he never finishes the sentence, for the other eye closes, and the nose and mouth \"go out\" at the same moment._  Asleep again, I declare, says JACK FROST, _with disgust_. Well, now for the Snow Fairies.  _He walks to the edge of the roof at one side, and blows a shrill blast on a whistle. Almost at once snow begins to fall from the sky, slowly at first, then more and more. Jack Frost looks up at it and nods his head approvingly. When it is snowing very hard, in come on tip-toe, very softly, the Snow Fairies, dressed in snowy white, with white hoods and muffs. Some of them quietly spread snow on the boughs of the trees, taking it out of their muffs; others hang flakes on the Chimney, in such a way as to make eyebrows, mustache, and beard for the face. But this doesn't show at first, because the Chimney is still asleep. Then the Fairies, standing in front of the Chimney, so that they hide it, sing their song, which is called_   THE SONG OF THE SNOW FAIRIES[2]    When children go to bed at night,   We fairies come with snow-flakes white;   Cover the earth, silent and still;   House-top, and tree-top, and field and hill.    When children wake at morning light,   They find the world all snowy white.   Where, then, are we? Who of you know?   Cosily tucked in our beds of snow.   [Footnote 2: To the tune of Schumann's \"_Kindernacht._\"]  THE CHIMNEY, _who is still hidden behind the Snow Fairies, wakes up while they are singing the last line, and calls out_: What's this, I'd like to know? Who's been decorating my face?  _The Snow Fairies stand back on either side, so that his face can now be seen, with its white eyebrows and mustache and beard, all made of snow-flakes; and he goes on talking in a jolly voice_: Oh, you sly ones, you are at your old tricks. Well, well, I'm really glad to see you. It seems like old times to have snow at Christmas. Now don't mind me; go on with your work; cover me up with your snowflakes as much as you choose--eyes, nose, mouth, and all; I don't mind it a bit.  _So the Snow Fairies, moving softly about, hang"]]]
