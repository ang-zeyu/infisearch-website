I earned it all myself. It wasn't yours!\"  \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" interposed the father in gentle reproof. \"Little girls mustn't talk like that to dear mother. Come, get up here on father's knee--so.\" He took off the red cap, tucked the brown curly head in the bend of his arm, his chin resting on the top of it as he went on, with the child's small hands clutching at his. \"Mary must always do what mother says; but, so far as this money is concerned, you can make me something that I would like far better than anything you could buy. Why don't you make me another pincushion, for instance? The one you gave me last year is quite worn out.\"  \"A pink one?\" asked Mary faintly.  \"Yes. What's the matter now?\" The child had suddenly wriggled to a kneeling posture in his hold and had her little strangling arms round his neck in a tempest of sobs.  \"I don't want to give you a pi-ink pincushion--I don't want to! I want my dollar! I want my dollar--to spend! I want--Father, I want my dollar--my do-o-ol-lar! I want my--\"  \"What did I tell you, Mary Langshaw?\" cried Clytie. She appealed to her husband. \"It's just the way I knew she'd act. Now I suppose you'll have to give it to her. Mary, be still a moment--her head is so hot!\"  \"There, there!\" said Langshaw soothingly. \"She shall have her money this minute.\"  \"Of course she doesn't deserve it,\" said Clytie, but with a tone of relief in her voice that seemed oddly greater than the occasion warranted. Mary had wound herself round him passionately; her sobs were dying away happily in long, deep breaths at intervals. Baby, being undressed on her mother's lap, was laughing over some pieces of gilt paper. In the heart of this domesticity it was as if the father and mother were embarked with this little company on a full and swelling river of love, of which they felt the exquisite soothing ripples.  Langshaw put his hand into his pocket.  \"No, I can't give you the dollar this minute, little girl; father has only a ten-dollar bill. I'll get it changed right after dinner. Isn't dinner 'most ready, Clytie?\"  \"We'll go down just as soon as I get Baby in bed,\" said the mother peacefully. \"I don't see why George isn't here. Goodness! There he is now,\" she added as a tremendous slam of the front door announced the fact. The next moment a small boy, roguishly blue-eyed and yellow-haired like Baby, with an extremely dirty face and a gray sweater half covered with mud, hurled himself into the room, surreptitiously tickling one of Baby's bare feet and pulling Mary's curls on his way to greet his father.  \"What have you been doing to get so dirty?\"  \"Playing cops and robbers,\" said the boy, serenely. His dimples appeared suddenly; his eyes lit up. \"Say, mother\"--he turned to her irresolutely--\"shall I tell father now?\"  \"Not until after dinner,\" returned the mother inexorably. \"Go and make yourself clean!\"  \"May I put on my white silk tie?\" George's white tie was the banner of festivity.  \"Yes.\"  \"You rouse my curiosity. This seems to be a great occasion,\" said Langshaw.  \"Oh, it is!\" agreed the mother happily. She murmured in his ear as they went downstairs: \"I hope you'll show that you're pleased, dear. You know sometimes when you really are pleased you don't show it at once--and George has been trying so hard. If you'll only show that you're pleased--\"  \"Yes--all right!\" returned the husband a little impatiently. Clytie had a sensitive consideration for her son's feelings which struck him at times as exaggerated. He thought of the delightful secret back in his own mind; there was no reason for talking any more about the rod until he bought it; he would manage to replace the dollar abstracted from the reserve fund.  If he gave absent answers during the meal Clytie seemed to be preoccupied also. Little Mary, who sat by him, tucked her hand into his as she prattled.  \"Now, George!\" said his mother at last suddenly when the rice pudding had been finished. George rose, clean and red-cheeked, looking more than ever like a large edition of Baby, in spite of his jacket and knickerbockers, as he stepped over to his father with a new dignity and handed him a folded sheet of paper.  \"What's this?\" asked Langshaw genially opening it. He read aloud the words within, written laboriously in a round, boyish hand:       To George Brander Langshaw, from father.        You Oh me five dolars.                           Reseived paiment.  \"Hello! Hello! What does this mean?\" asked Langshaw slowly, with an unpleasant startled sensation that any such sum in connection with George was out of all reason.  \"It means a bill for you from me!\" announced George. His cheeks grew redder, his blue eyes looked squarely at his father. \"It's for this!\" He pulled from his pocket a school report card divided into tiny ruled squares, filled with figures for half its length, and flung it down proudly on the table before his parent.  \"It's the Deportment--since September. You said when Miss Skinner sent that last note home about me that if I could get a hundred in Deportment for every month up to Christmas you'd be willing to pay me five dollars. You can see there for yourself, father, the three one hundreds--no, not that line--that's only fifty-five for spelling; nobody ever knows their spelling! Here is the place to look--in the Deportment column. I've tried awful hard to be good, father, to surprise you.\"  \"The way that child has tried!\" burst forth Clytie, her dark eyes drowned in sparkles. \"And they're so unfair at school--giving you a mark if you squeak your chair, or speak, or look at anybody; as if any child could be expected to sit like a stone all the time! I'm sure I love to hear children laughing--and you know yourself how hard it is for George to be quiet! We had a little talk about it together, he and I; and now you see! It's been such work keeping his card from you each month when you asked for it. One day he thought he had a bad mark and he couldn't eat any dinner--you thought he was ill; but he went to Miss Skinner the next day and she took it off because he had been trying so hard to be good. Joe, why don't you speak?\"  \"George, I'm proud of you!\" said Langshaw simply. There was a slight huskiness in his voice; the round face and guileless blue eyes of his little boy, who had tried \"awful hard to be good,\" seemed to have acquired a new dignity. The father saw in him the grown-up son who could be depended upon to look after his mother if need were. Langshaw held out his hand as man to man; the two pairs of eyes met squarely. \"Nothing you could have done would have pleased me more than this, George. I value it more than any Christmas present I could have.\"  \"Mother said you'd like it,\" said the beaming George, ducking his head suddenly and kicking out his legs from behind.  \"And you'll pay the five dollars?\" supplemented Clytie anxiously.  \"Surely!\" said Langshaw. The glances of the parents met in one of the highest pleasures that life affords: the approval together of the good action of their dear child. \"George can go out and get this ten-dollar bill changed.\"  \"If you can't spare it, father--\" suggested the boy with some new sense of manliness, hanging back.  \"I'm glad to be able to spare it,\" said the father soberly. \"It's a good deal of money,\" he added. \"I suppose, of course, you'll put it in the bank, George?\"  \"Now you mustn't ask what he's going to do with it,\" said Clytie.  \"Oh, isn't it much!\" cried little Mary.  \"Dear me, there's the doorbell,\" said Clytie. \"Who can it be at this hour? Run, George, and see!\"  \"It's a letter for you, mother,\" announced George, reappearing. \"There's a man in the hall, waiting for an answer.\"  \"It looks like a bill,\" said Clytie nervously, tearing open the envelope; \"but I don't owe any bill. Why, it's two and a quarter, from the tailor, for fixing over my old suit last fall! I'm positive I paid it weeks ago. There's some mistake.\"  \"He says he's been here three times, but you were out.\"  \"Have you any money for it, Clytie?\" asked her husband.  Clytie looked as if a thunderbolt had struck her.  \"Yes, I have; but--oh, I don't want to take it for that! I need every penny I've got.\"  \"Well, there's no need of feeling so badly about it,\" said Langshaw resignedly.  \"Give the ten-dollar bill to the man, George, and see if he can change it.\" He couldn't resist a slight masculine touch of severity at her incapacity. \"I wish you'd tend to these things at the time, Clytie, or let me know about them.\" He took the money when George returned. \"Here's your dollar now, Mary--don't lose it again!--and your five, George. You might as well take another dollar yourself, Clytie, for extras.\"  He pocketed the remainder of the change carelessly. After his first pang at the encroachment on the reserve fund the rod had sunk so far out of sight that it was almost as if it had never been. He had, of course, known all along that he would not buy it. Even the sting of the \"Amount due\" quickly evaporated.  Little Mary gave a jump that bumped her brown curly head against him.  \"You don't know what I'm going to give you for Christmas!\" she cried joyously.     II   Langshaw was one of those men who have an inherited capacity for enjoying Christmas. He lent it his attention with zest, choosing the turkey himself with critical care as he went through the big market in town, from whence he brought also wreaths and branches of holly that seemed to have larger and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14946"],["title","The Blossoming Rod (#2)"],["body","berries than could be bought in the village. On Christmas Eve he put up the greens that decorated the parlour and dining-room--a ceremony that required large preparations with a step-ladder, a hammer, tacks, and string, the removal of his coat, and a lighted pipe in one corner of his mouth; and which proceeded with such painstaking slowness on account of his coming down from the ladder every other moment to view the artistic effect of the arrangements, that it was only by sticking the last branches up any old way at Clytie's wild appeal that he ever got it finished at all.  Then he helped her fill the stockings, his own fingers carefully giving the crowning effect of orange and cornucopia in each one, and arranging the large packages below, after tiptoeing down the stairs with them so as not to wake the officially sleeping children, who were patently stark awake, thrashing or coughing in their little beds. The sturdy George had never been known to sleep on Christmas Eve, always coming down the next day esthetically pale and with abnormally large eyes, to the feast of rapture.  On this Saturday--Christmas Eve's eve--when Langshaw finally reached home, laden with all the \"last things\" and the impossible packages of tortuous shapes left by fond relatives at his office for the children--one pocket of his overcoat weighted with the love-box of really good candy for Clytie--it was evident as soon as he opened the hall door that something unusual was going on upstairs. Wild shrieks of \"It's father! It's father!\" rent the air.  \"It's father!\"  \"Fardie! Fardie, don't come up!\"  \"Father, don't come up!\"  \"Father, it's your present!\"  There was hasty scurrying of feet, racing to and fro, and further shrieks. Langshaw waited, smiling.  It was evidently a \"boughten\" gift, then; the last had been a water pitcher, much needed in the household. He braced himself fondly for immense enthusiasm over this.  An expression of intense excitement was visible on each face when finally he was allowed to enter the upper room. Mary and Baby rushed at him to clasp his leg, while his wife leaned over to kiss him as he whispered:  \"I brought out a lot of truck; it's all in the closet in the hall.\"  George, standing with his hands in his pockets, proclaimed loudly, with sparkling eyes:  \"You nearly saw your present! It's from mother and us. Come here, Baby, and pull brother's leg. Say, father, do you like cut glass?\"  \"O-oh!\" came in ecstatic chorus from the other two, as at a delightful joke.  \"It's a secret!\" announced Baby, her yellow hair falling over one round, blue eye.  \"I believe it's a pony,\" said the father. \"I'm sure I heard a pony up here!\"  Shouts of renewed joy greeted the jest.  All the next day, Christmas Eve itself, whenever two or three of the family were gathered together there were secret whisperings, more scurryings, and frenzied warnings for the father not to come into the room. In spite of himself, Langshaw began to get a little curious as to the tobacco jar or the fire shovel, or whatever should be his portion. He not only felt resigned to not having the trout-rod, but a sort of wonder also rose in him that he had been bewitched--even momentarily--into thinking he could have it. What did it matter anyway?  \"It's worth it, old girl, isn't it?\" he said cryptically as he and Clytie met once unexpectedly in the hall, and he put his arm round her.  \"Yes!\" answered his wife, her dark eyes lustrous. Sometimes she didn't look much older than little Mary. \"One thing, though, I must say: I do hope, dear, that--the children have been thinking so much of our present to you and saving up so for it--I do hope, Joe, that if you are pleased you'll show it. So far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter; but sometimes--when, of course, I know how pleased you really are--you don't show it at once to others. That's why I hope you'll show it to-morrow if--\"  \"Great Scott! Clytie, let up on it! What do you want me to do--jump up and down and make a fool of myself?\" asked her husband scornfully. \"You leave me alone!\"  It was Langshaw's firm rule, vainly protested even by his wife, that the household should have breakfast on Christmas Day before tackling the stockings--a hurried mockery of a meal, to be sure, yet to his masculine idea a reënforcement of food for the infant stomach before the long, hurtling joy of the day. The stockings and the piles under them were taken in order, according to age--the youngest first and the others waiting in rapt interest and admiration until their turn arrived--a pretty ceremony.  In the delicious revelry of Baby's joy, as her trembling, fat little fingers pulled forth dolls and their like, all else was forgotten until it was Mary's turn, and then George's, and then the mother's. And then, when he had forgotten all about it: \"Now father!\" There was seemingly a breathless moment while all eyes turned to him.  \"It's father's turn now; father's going to have his presents. Father, sit down here on the sofa--it's your turn now.\"  There were only a blue cornucopia and an orange and a bottle of olives in his stocking, a Christmas card from his sister Ella, a necktie from grandmamma, and nothing, as his quick eye had noted, under it on the floor; but now George importantly stooped down, drew a narrow package from under the sofa and laid it beside his father, pulling off the paper. Inside was a slim, longish, gray linen bag. Langshaw studied it for a moment before opening it.  \"Well, I'll be jiggered!\" he breathed, with a strange glance round at the waiting group and an odd, crooked smile. \"I'll be jiggered!\"  There in its neatly grooved sections lay the rod, ready to be put together--not a rod, but, as his eye almost unbelievingly reassured him, _the_ rod--the ticket of the shop adorning it--in all its beauty of golden shellac and delicate tip. His fingers touched the pieces reverently.  \"Well, will you look at that! How did you ever think of getting it?\"  \"How did I think of it? Because you talked about it all the time,\" said his wife scornfully, with her arms round his neck from behind, while the children flung themselves upon him. \"Oh, I know you thought you didn't; but you did just the same. George heard you, too. We got Mr. Wickersham to pick it out. He said it was the one you wanted. And the reel--you haven't noticed that box there--the reel is the right kind, he says; and the line is silk--the best. There's the book of flies too--six. Baby's crazy over them! Mr. Wickersham said it was all just what you ought to have. We've been saving up for the longest time; but we had to wait, you see, for George's deportment before the things could be bought. If it isn't right--\"  \"Right? Say, this is the finest present I ever had!\" said Langshaw with glittering eyes and that little crooked smile. \"It just beats everything!\"  He rose, scattering his adoring family, and, walking to the window, threw it open to the frosty December air and called across to a neighbour standing on the walk.  \"Want to come over here, Hendon? Got something to show you. Will you look at this! Present from my wife and the kids--been saving up for it. It's a peach, I'll tell you that! I'm going to take George off fishing this spring--What? Well, come over later, when you've got time to take a good look at it.\"  \"Do you like it, father?\" came from three different voices at once.  \"Do I like it? You can just bet I do,\" said Langshaw emphatically. He bent and kissed the three upturned faces, and leaned toward his wife afterward to press her sweet waiting lips with his; but his eyes, as if drawn by a magnet, were only on the rod--not the mere bundle of sticks he might have bought, but transformed into one blossoming with love.  \"And do you know, we hardly saw a thing of him all day!\" Clytie proudly recounted afterward to her sister. \"My dear, he would hardly take time to eat his dinner or speak to any one; he was out in the back yard with Henry Wickersham and Mr. Hendon until dark, flapping that rod in circles--the silliest thing! He nearly sent a hook into George's eye once. George acted as bewitched as he did. Joe kept telling every single person who came along that it was 'a present from his wife and the kids.' He certainly showed that he was pleased.\"  \"It's been a pretty nice day, hasn't it?\" Langshaw said to his wife that Christmas night when the children were at last in bed. \"Best Christmas I ever had! To think of you and the kids doing all this for me.\"  His hand rested lovingly on the rod, now once again swathed in the gray linen bag. He would have been the last to realize that, in his humble way, he typified a diviner Fatherhood to the little family who trusted in his care for them--for all things came of him, and of his own had they given him."]]]
