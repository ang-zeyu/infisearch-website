Who knoweth not that from high Heaven first came     Our light, from God Himself the rushing fire?     For Moses erst, amid the prickly brier,   Saw God made manifest in lambent flame.    Ah, happy he! deemed worthy face to face     To see heaven's Lord within that sacred brake;     Bidden the sandals from his feet to take,   Nor with his shoon defile that holy place.    The mighty children of the chosen name,     Saved by the merits of their sires, and free     After long years of savage tyranny,   Through the drear desert followed still that flame.    Striking their camp beneath the silent night     Where'er they went, to lead their darkling way,     The cloud of glory lent its guiding ray   And shone more splendid than the noonday light.    But, mad with jealous fury, Egypt's king     Calls his great host to battle for their lord:     Swiftly the cohorts gather at his word,   And down the mail-clad lines the clarions ring.    Girding their trusty swords the warriors go     To fill the ranks; hoarse bugles rend the air;     These seize their massy javelins, these prepare   The death-winged arrow and the Cretan bow.    The footmen throng in close battalions pressed;     The chariots thunder; to the saddle spring     The riders of the Nile, as forth they fling   Egypt's proud banner with the serpent crest.    And now, forgetful of the bondage past,     Thy children, tortured by the desert heat,     Drag to the Red Sea's brink their weary feet,   And on its sandy margin rest at last.    See! with their forsworn king the savage foe     Draws nigh: the threatening squadrons nearer ride;     But ever onward urged the intrepid guide   And through the waves bade Israel fearless go.    Before that steadfast march the billows fall,     Then raise on either hand their crystal mass,     While through the sundered deep Thy people pass   And ocean guards them with a liquid wall.    But, mad with baffled rage, the dusky horde     Of Egypt, by their impious despot led,     Athirst the hated Hebrews' blood to shed   Pursued, all reckless of the o'er-arching flood.    Swift as the wind the royal squadrons ride,     But swifter yet the crystal barriers break,     The waves exultantly their bounds forsake   And roll together in a roaring tide.    'Mid steeds and chariots and drifting mail     The drownèd lords of Egypt found a grave     With all their swart retainers 'neath the wave;   And in their haughty courts the mourners wail.    What tongue, O Christ, Thy glories can unfold?     Thine was the arm, outstretched in wrath, that made     The stricken land of Pharaoh, sore afraid,   Bow down before Thy minister of old.    Thy pathless deep did at the voice restrain     Its surging billows, till with Thee for guide     Thy host passed scathless, and the refluent tide   Swept down the wicked to the engulfing main.    At Thy command the desert, parched and dry,     Breaks into laughing rills, and water clear     Wells from the smitten rock Thy flock to cheer   And quench their thirst beneath that brazen sky.    Then Marah's bitterness grew passing sweet,     Touched by the mystic tree; so by the grace     Of Thine own Tree, O Christ, our sinful race   Regains its lost hopes at Thy piercèd feet.    Faster than icy hail the manna falls,     Like snow down drifting from a wintry sky;     The feast is set: they heap the tables high   With that rich food from Thy celestial halls.    Fresh blow the breezes from the distant shore     And bear a fluttering cloud that hides the light,     Till the frail pinions, faltering in their flight,   Sink in the wilderness to rise no more.    How great the love of God's own Son, that shed     Such wondrous bounty on His chosen race!     And still to us He proffers in His grace   The mystic Feast, wherewith our souls are fed.    Through the world's raging sea He bids us come,     And 'twixt the sundered billows guides our path,     Till, spent and wearied with the ocean's wrath,   He calls His storm-tossed saints to Heaven and home.    There in His paradise red roses blow,     With golden daffodils and lilies pale     And gentle violets, and down the vale   The murmuring rivulets for ever flow.    Sweet balsams, welling from the slender tree,     And precious spices fill the fragrant air,     And, hiding by the stream, that blossom rare   Whose leaves the river hurries to the sea.    There the blest souls with one accord unite     To hymn in dulcet song their Saviour's praise,     And as the chanting quire their voices raise   They tread with shining feet the lilies bright.    Yea, e'en the spirits of the lost, that dwell     Where the black stream of sullen Acheron flows,     Rest on that holy night when Christ arose,   And for a while 'tis holiday in Hell.    No sun from ocean rising drives away     Their darkness, with his flaming shafts far-hurled,     But from the cross of Christ o'er that wan world   There streams the radiance of a new-born day.    The sulphurous floods with lessened fury glow,     The aching limbs find respite from their pain,     While, in glad freedom from the galling chain,   The tortured ghosts a short-lived solace know.    In holy gladness let this night be sped,     As here we gather, Lord, to watch and pray;     To Thee with one consent our vows we pay   And on Thy altar set the sacred Bread.    From pendent chains the lamps of crystal blaze;     By fragrant oil sustained the clear flame glows     With strength undimmed, and through the darkness throws   High o'er the fretted roof a golden haze,    As 'twere Heaven's starry floor our wondering eye     Beheld, wherein the Bears their light display,     Where Phosphor heralds the approach of day   And Hesper's radiance floods the evening sky.    Meet is the gift we offer here to Thee,     Father of all, as falls the dewy night;     Thine own most precious gift we bring--the light   Whereby mankind Thy other bounties see.    Thou art the Light indeed; on our dull eyes     And on our inmost souls Thy rays are poured;     To Thee we light our lamps: receive them, Lord,   Filled with the oil of peace and sacrifice.    O hear us, Father, through Thine only Son,     Our Lord and Saviour, by Whose love bequeathed     The Paraclete upon our hearts has breathed,   With Him and Thee through endless ages one.    Through Christ Thy Kingdom shall for ever be,     Thy grace, might, wisdom, glory ever shine,     As in the Triune majesty benign   He reigns for all eternity with Thee.                             VI. HYMNUS ANTE SOMNUM       Ades Pater supreme,   quem nemo vidit unquam,   Patrisque sermo Christe,   et Spiritus benigne.      O Trinitatis huius             5   vis una, lumen unum,   Deus ex Deo perennis,   Deus ex utroque missus.      Fluxit labor diei,   redit et quietis hora,          10   blandus sopor vicissim   fessos relaxat artus.      Mens aestuans procellis   curisque sauciata   totis bibit medullis            15   obliviale poclum.      Serpit per omne corpus   Lethaea vis, nec ullum   miseris doloris aegri   patitur manere sensum.          20      Lex haec data est caducis   Deo iubente membris,   ut temperet laborem   medicabilis voluptas.      Sed dum pererrat omnes        25   quies amica venas,   pectusque feriatum   placat rigante somno:      Liber vagat per auras   rapido vigore sensus,           30   variasque per figuras,   quae sunt operta, cernit.      Quia mens soluta curis,   cui est origo caelum,   purusque fons ab aethra         35   iners iacere nescit.      Imitata multiformes   facies sibi ipsa fingit,   per quas repente currens   tenui fruatur actu.             40      Sed sensa somniantum   dispar fatigat horror,   nunc splendor intererrat   qui dat futura nosse.      Plerumque dissipatis          45   mendax imago veris   animos pavore maestos   ambage fallit atra.      Quem rara culpa morum   non polluit frequenter,         50   nunc lux serena vibrans   res edocet latentes.      At qui coinquinatum   vitiis cor inpiavit,   lusus pavore multo              55   species videt tremendas.      Hoc patriarcha noster   sub carceris catena   geminis simul ministris   interpres adprobavit.           60      Quorum reversus unus   dat poculum tyranno,   ast alterum rapaces   fixum vorant volucres.      Ipsum deinde regem            65   perplexa somniantem   monuit famem futuram   clausis cavere acervis.      Mox praesul ac tetrarches   regnum per omne iussus          70   sociam tenere virgam   dominae resedit aulae.      O quam profunda iustis   arcana per soporem   aperit tuenda Christus,         75   quam clara! quam tacenda!      Evangelista summi   fidissimus magistri   signata quae latebant   nebulis videt remotis:          80      ipsum tonantis agnum   de caede purpurantem,   qui conscium futuri   librum resignat unus.      Huius manum potentem          85   gladius perarmat anceps   et fulgurans utrimque   duplicem minatur ictum.      Quaesitor ille solus   animaeque corporisque           90   ensisque bis timendus   prima ac secunda mors est.      idem tamen benignus   ultor retundit iram   paucosque non piorum            95   patitur perire in aevum.      Huic inclitus perenne   tribuit Pater tribunal,   hunc obtinere iussit   nomen supra omne nomen.        100      Hic praepotens cruenti   extinctor antichristi,   qui de furente monstro   pulchrum refert tropaeum.      Quam bestiam capacem         105   populosque devorantem,   quam sanguinis charybdem   Ioannis execratur.      Haec nempe, quae sacratum   praeferre nomen ausa est,      110   imam petit gehennam   Christo perempta vero.      Tali sopore iustus   mentem relaxat heros,   ut spiritu sagaci              115   caelum peragret omne.      Nos nil meremur horum,   quos creber inplet error,   concreta quos malarum   vitiat cupido rerum.           120      Sat est quiete dulci   fessum fovere corpus:   sat, si nihil sinistrum   vanae"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],["title","The Hymns of Prudentius (#6)"],["body","umbrae.      Cultor Dei memento           125   te fontis et lavacri   rorem subisse sanctum,   te chrismate innotatum.      Fac, cum vocante somno   castum petis cubile,           130   frontem locumque cordis   crucis figura signet.      Crux pellit omne crimen,   fugiunt crucem tenebrae:   tali dicata signo              135   mens fluctuare nescit.      Procul, o procul vagantum   portenta somniorum,   procul esto pervicaci   praestigiator astu!            140      O tortuose serpens,   qui mille per Maeandros   fraudesque flexuosas   agitas quieta corda,      Discede, Christus hic est,   145   hic Christus est, liquesce:   signum quod ipse nosti   damnat tuam catervam.      Corpus licet fatiscens   iaceat recline paullum,        150   Christum tamen sub ipso   meditabimur sopore.                             VI. HYMN BEFORE SLEEP     Draw near, Almighty Father,     Ne'er seen by mortal eye;   Come, O Thou Word eternal,     O Spirit blest, be nigh.    One light of threefold Godhead,     One power that all transcends;   God is of God begotten,     And God from both descends.    The hour of rest approaches,     The toils of day are past,   And o'er our tired bodies     Sleep's gentle charm is cast.    The mind, by cares tormented     Amid life's storm and stress,   Drinks deep the wondrous potion     That brings forgetfulness.    O'er weary, toil-worn mortals     The spells of Lethe steal;   Sad hearts lose all their sorrow,     Nor pain nor anguish feel.    For to His frail creation     God gave this law to keep,   That labour should be lightened     By soft and healing sleep.    But while sweet languor wanders     Through all the pulsing veins,   And, wrapt in dewy slumber,     The heart at rest remains,    The soul, in wakeful vigour,     Aloft in freedom flies,   And sees in many a semblance     The hidden mysteries.    For, freed from care, the spirit     That came from out the sky,   Born of the stainless aether,     Can never idle lie.    A thousand changing phantoms     She fashions through the night,   And 'midst a world of fancy     Pursues her rapid flight.    But divers are the visions     That night to dreamers shows;   Rare gleams of straying splendour     The future may disclose;    More oft the truth is darkened,     And lying fantasy   Deceives the affrighted sleeper     With cunning treachery.    To him whose life is holy     The things that are concealed   Lie open to his spirit     In radiant light revealed;    But he whose heart is blackened,     With many a sin imbued,   Sees phantoms grim and ghastly     That beckon and delude.    So in the Egyptian dungeon     The patriarch of old   Unto the king's two servants     Their fateful visions told:    And one is brought from prison     The monarch's wine to pour,   One, on the gibbet hanging,     Foul birds of prey devour,    He warned the king, distracted     By riddles of the night,   To hoard the plenteous harvests     Against the years of blight.    Soon, lord of half a kingdom,     A mighty potentate,   He shares the royal sceptre     And dwells in princely state.    But ah! how deep the secrets     The holy sleeper sees   To whom Christ shows His highest,     Most sacred mysteries.    For God's most faithful servant     The clouds were rolled away,   And John beheld the wonders     That sealed from mortals lay.    The Lamb of God, encrimsoned     With sacrificial stains,   Alone the Book can open     That destiny contains.    By His strong hand is wielded     A keen, two-edgèd brand   That, flashing like the lightning,     Smites swift on either hand.    Before His bar of judgment     Both soul and body lie;   He whom that dread sword smiteth     The second death shall die.    Yet mercy tempers justice,     And few the Avenger sends   (Whose guilt is past all pardon)     To death that never ends.    To Him the Father yieldeth     The judgment-seat of Heaven;   To Him a Name excelling     All other names is given.    For by His strength transcendent     Shall Antichrist be slain,   And from that raging monster     Fair trophies shall He gain:    That all-devouring Dragon,     With blood of martyrs red,   On whose abhorrèd power     John's solemn curse is laid.    And thus the proud usurper     Of His high name is cast   By Him, the true Christ, vanquished     To deepest hell at last.    Upon the saint heroic     Such wondrous slumber falls   That, in the spirit roaming,     He treads heaven's highest halls.    We may not, in our weakness,     To dreams like these aspire,   Whose souls are steeped in error     And evil things desire.    Enough, if weary bodies     In peaceful sleep may rest;   Enough, if no dark powers     Our slumbering souls molest.    Christian! the font remember,     The sacramental vow,   The holy water sprinkled,     The oil that marked thy brow!    When at sleep's call thou seekest     To rest in slumber chaste,   Let first the sacred emblem     On breast and brow be traced.    The Cross dispels all darkness,     All sin before it flies,   And by that sign protected     The mind all fear defies.    Avaunt! ye fleeting phantoms     That mock our midnight hours;   Avaunt! thou great Deceiver     With all thy guileful powers.    Thou Serpent, old and crafty,     Who by a thousand arts   And manifold temptations     Dost vex our sleeping hearts,    Vanish! for Christ is with us;     Away! 'tis Christ the Lord:   The sign thou must acknowledge     Condemns thy hellish horde.    And, though the weary body     Relaxed in sleep may be,   Our hearts, Lord, e'en in slumber,     Shall meditate on Thee.                           VII. HYMNUS IEIUNANTIUM        O Nazarene, lux Bethlem, verbum Patris,   quem partus alvi virginalis protulit,   adesto castis Christe parsimoniis,   festumque nostrum rex serenus adspice,   ieiuniorum dum litamus victimam.              5      Nil hoc profecto purius mysterio,   quo fibra cordis expiatur uvidi,   intemperata quo domantur viscera,   arvina putrem ne resudans crapulam   obstrangulatae mentis ingenium premat.       10      Hinc subiugatur luxus et turpis gula,   vini atque somni degener socordia,   libido sordens, inverecundus lepos,   variaeque pestes languidorum sensuum   parcam subactae disciplinam sentiunt.        15      Nam si licenter diffluens potu et cibo   ieiuna rite membra non coerceas,   sequitur frequenti marcida oblectamine   scintilla mentis ut tepescat nobilis,   animusque pigris stertat in praecordiis.     20      Frenentur ergo corporum cupidines,   detersa et intus emicet prudentia:   sic excitato perspicax acumine   liberque flatu laxiore spiritus   rerum parentem rectius precabitur.           25      Elia tali crevit observantia,   vetus sacerdos, ruris hospes aridi:   fragore ab omni quem remotum et segregem   sprevisse tradunt criminum frequentiam,   casto fruentem syrtium silentio.             30      Sed mox in auras igneis iugalibus   curruque raptus evolavit praepete,   ne de propinquo sordium contagio   dirus quietum mundus adflaret virum,   olim probatis inclitum ieiuniis.             35      Non ante caeli principem septemplicis   Moyses tremendi fidus interpres throni   potuit videre, quam decem recursibus   quater volutis sol peragrans sidera   omni carentem cerneret substantia.           40      Victus precanti solus in lacrimis fuit:   nam flendo pernox inrigatum pulverem   humi madentis ore pressit cernuo,   donec loquentis voce praestrictus Dei   expavit ignem non ferendum visibus.          45      Ioannis huius artis hand minus potens,   Dei perennis praecucurrit filium,   curvos viarum qui retorsit tramites   et flexuosa conrigens dispendia   dedit sequendam calle recto lineam.          50      Hanc obsequelam praeparabat nuntius   mox adfuturo construens iter Deo,   clivosa planis, confragosa ut lenibus   converterentur, neve quidquam devium   inlapsa terris inveniret veritas.            55      Non usitatis ortus his natalibus   oblita lactis iam vieto in pectore   matris tetendit serus infans ubera:   nec ante partu de senili effusus est,   quam praedicaret virginem plenam Deo.        60      Post in patentes ille solitudines   amictus hirtis bestiarum pellibus   setisve tectus hispida et lanugine   secessit, horrens inquinari et pollui   contaminatis oppidorum moribus.              65      Illic dicata parcus abstinentia   potum cibumque vir severae industriae   in usque serum respuebat vesperum,   parvum locustis et favorum agrestium   liquore pastum corpori suetus dare.          70      Hortator ille primus et doctor novae   fuit salutis, nam sacrato in flumine   veterum piatas lavit errorum notas:   sed tincta postquam membra defaecaverat,   caelo refulgens influebat spiritus.          75      Hoc ex lavacro labe dempta criminum   ibant renati non secus, quam si rudis   auri recocta vena pulchrum splendeat,   micet metalli sive lux argentei,   sudum polito praenitens purgamine.           80      Referre prisci stemma mine ieiunii   libet fideli proditum volumine,   ut diruendae civitatis incolis   fulmen benigni mansuefactum Patris   pie repressis ignibus pepercerit.            85      Gens insolenti praepotens iactantia   pollebat olim, quam fluentem nequiter   conrupta vulgo solverat lascivia,   et inde bruto contumax fastidio   cultum superni negligebat numinis.           90      Offensa tandem iugis indulgentiae   censura iustis excitatur motibus,   dextram perarmat rhompheali incendio   nimbos crepantes et fragosos turbines   vibrans tonantum nube flammarum quatit.      95      Sed paenitendi dum datur diecula,   si forte vellent inprobam libidinem   veteresque nugas condomare ac frangere,   suspendit ictum terror exorabilis   paullumque dicta substitit sententia.       100      Ionam prophetam mitis ultor excitat,   paenae inminentis iret ut praenuntius,   sed nosset ille qui minacem iudicem   servare malle, quam ferire ac plectere,   tectam latenter vertit in Tharsos fugam.    105      Celsam paratis pontibus scandit ratem,"]]]
