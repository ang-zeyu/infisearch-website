Fleet of what?\" asked Jack, with some sarcasm. \"Fleet of motorboats, perhaps?\"  \"Precisely,\" said Lord Hastings with a smile, and added: \"You don't seem to think much of the idea.\"  \"No, I don't, sir,\" was the reply. \"I was in hopes that we were to feel a real vessel beneath our feet once more. What good is a motorboat against a submarine, anyway?\"  \"That's what I would like to know,\" agreed Frank.  \"I'll tell you,\" replied Lord Hastings. \"But first let me ask you something. Do you remember, the other day, of asking me to explain the mystery of the vanishing submarines?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied both lads.  \"Very well. The solution of this mystery is, primarily, motorboats.\"  \"What do you mean, sir?\" exclaimed Jack.  \"Just what I say. In the main, the possible hundred German submarines that have disappeared recently have been accounted for by high-speed, powerfully armed motorboats. The government has discovered, after much experimenting, that the one craft with an advantage over a submarine is a powerful motorboat; and England now has a fleet of several hundred scouring the seas in the proximity of the British Isles.\"  \"But I can't see where they would do any good,\" said Jack.  \"In the first place,\" said Lord Hastings, \"they are so small that they escape the notice of a submarine until the motorboat is almost upon them; and then it is too late for them to act. Also, the motorboat, being small, is a much more difficult object to hit with a torpedo--it is, in fact, a very poor target. Then again, a motorboat is so much swifter than a submarine that the advantage is all with the motorboat.\"  \"By Jove, sir! the way you explain it I can see the advantages,\" said Jack eagerly.  \"And so can I,\" agreed Frank.  Lord Hastings smiled.  \"You are easily convinced,\" he replied. \"Had some of the admiralty officials been convinced half so easily, this submarine menace might have been effectually stopped long before this.\"  As the motorboat continued down the Thames, each occupant remained busy with his thoughts. It was Frank who broke the silence.  \"What has happened to the torpedoboat destroyers, sir?\" he asked. \"I understood they were the real submarine foe, with their heavy nets.\"  \"They are still in use,\" replied Lord Hastings. \"You know how they work their nets, I suppose?\"  \"Why, I think so, sir. The net is carried by two ships, and when a submarine crashes into the net she either tangles her nose or her stern in the net and can be disposed of with ease.\"  \"Yes, but what I want to know,\" said Jack, \"is why she doesn't fire a torpedo through the net and sink the torpedoboat?\"  \"Because,\" said Lord Hastings, with a smile, \"being beneath the water, she is blind. She doesn't know in which direction to fire it. You forget that the German submarines are not equipped as was the D-16.\"  \"The good old D-16,\" said Jack. \"How I wish we had her again, sir.\"  \"And I,\" agreed Lord Hastings. \"And yet she came near being the death of all of us.\"  \"So she did,\" said Frank, \"but at the same time I wouldn't mind being aboard another such craft.\"  \"Well, just between the three of us,\" said Lord Hastings, \"I may tell you that another such craft now is nearing completion and probably will be at our disposal within a month.\"  \"You don't mean it, sir!\" exclaimed Frank happily.  \"If he didn't mean it he wouldn't say so,\" Jack reproved his chum.  \"Oh, I know that,\" replied Frank. \"But it seems too good to be true.\"  \"But just where are we bound now, sir?\" asked Jack.  \"Well,\" said Lord Hastings, \"at first we shall do a little cruising off the Irish coast. In fact, most of the motorboat fleet is in Irish waters. Since the sinking of the _Lusitania_, most of the work has been done there; and apparently the German government is still bent upon the destruction of big passenger ships, neutral or not.\"  \"Well, the sooner we can get busy the better it will suit me,\" declared Frank.  \"I agree with you there,\" said Jack.  It was a long voyage for the little motorboat, and though Lord Hastings wished to join the others of the fleet at the earliest possible moment, he did not push the little craft, which bore the name of _The Hawk_.  Therefore, it was late the next day when they came to where the motorboat fleet had its base--Bantry Bay, on the extreme southern coast of Ireland.  As the little motorboat nosed its way into the harbor, several others dashed forward, with guns bared and alert figures standing ready for action. It was not until Lord Hastings had been satisfactorily identified that the warlike atmosphere disappeared.  The two lads looked about curiously. The bay was black with the little craft.  \"Great Scott! There are more than two hundred here, if you ask me,\" declared Frank.  \"Looks that way to me, too,\" agreed Jack.  They mentioned the matter to Lord Hastings.  \"Captain Smithers just told me,\" replied Lord Hastings, \"that at this moment there are in the neighborhood of a thousand of these little craft here. However, the bulk of them probably will be sent to other stations before long.\"  \"You mean distributed up and down the coast?\" asked Frank.  \"Exactly.\"  \"And when are we going to get busy, sir?\" asked Jack.  Again Lord Hastings smiled.  \"To-night,\" he said, after a moment's hesitation, \"I think I can promise you a little excitement to-night. Captain Smithers has a tip that he intends to follow, and we have been selected for the job.\"     CHAPTER VII.  AN ENEMY.   _The Hawk_ crept over the still black waters as silently as the night itself. Not a light showed aboard the little craft--not a human voice was heard. Now and then the faint exhaust of the engine could have been heard by a keen ear, but the engine was muffled and whatever sound it might make carried but a few yards at most.  _The Hawk_, with Lord Hastings, Jack and Frank and the other few members of the crew, was stalking the foe--no particular foe, perhaps--but any enemy that might be foolhardy enough to show itself.  Aboard, each member of the crew, besides his revolvers, was equipped with a small hand flashlight; and the larger searchlight in the bow was ready for instant use--to flash in the eyes of an enemy to blind him and to spoil his aim.  And the two heavy guns--one forward, the other aft--were ready for action.  The men stood at their posts--had stood there now for two hours--ever since _The Hawk_ had crept silently from the friendly shelter of Bantry Bay. The crew had been ordered to silence and the crew of _The Hawk_, commanded by Lord Hastings, obeyed orders.  So far _The Hawk_ had come upon nothing that had justified its lonesome and silent vigil--not an object of any kind had been encountered, and the hour was now after midnight. Still, keen eyes aboard the little craft peered untiringly ahead and swept the waters in all directions, trying to pierce the darkness of the night.  The night, though dark, was perfectly calm and peaceful, albeit black, overhanging clouds heralded the approach of a storm. But Lord Hastings, than whom there were few better weather prophets, announced that the storm would not break before well along toward morning and held to his quest without trepidation.  Frank and Jack were now becoming somewhat restless, for they had begun to fear that the night's venture would not bear fruit. However, each remembered what Lord Hastings had said regarding a \"tip,\" so they knew that their commander had some object in view. Also, since leaving port, _The Hawk_ had held steadily to her course.  Now and then the commander of _The Hawk_, by the faint glare of his searchlight, shielded by his hand, consulted a chart and several times muttered low directions to the man at the wheel.  Suddenly there came a subdued command from Lord Hastings, and in response the engines were stopped. Lord Hastings placed a hand to his ear and listened intently.  \"Did any of you hear anything?\" he asked in a low voice.  No one had.  \"Strange,\" muttered Lord Hastings; \"I could have sworn I heard something moving through the water.\"  He gave the command to go ahead again; but less than five moments later once more brought _The Hawk_ to a pause.  \"I am sure I heard something,\" he said to Frank, who stood near him.  \"I thought I did myself, that time,\" replied the lad. \"Sounded like a boat, and not a great distance away.\"  \"We shall have to be careful,\" said his commander. \"I know that there is not another British vessel in these waters to-night. If there is a second craft out here, it must be an enemy.\"  \"Shall we flash our light about?\" asked Frank.  \"And betray our own presence? Not much. No; we shall just remain here for half an hour and see if we can't pick up the other fellow in the darkness.\"  Again the silence of death hung over _The Hawk_.  Then, suddenly, Jack, aft, gave a subdued exclamation.  Lord Hastings hurried to his side.  \"What is it?\" he demanded.  \"Small craft of some kind bearing down on us, sir,\" he replied quickly. \"She'll bump us!\"  Lord Hastings took in the situation at a glance. Less than 150 yards away a small object was coming toward _The Hawk_.  Lord Hastings gave a quick command.  \"Full speed ahead!\" he cried, and in response to this command, _The Hawk_ leaped forward.  Lord Hastings hurled a second quick command to the man at the wheel, and _The Hawk_ came about in a broad circle; and at the same instant a blinding glare flashed into the faces of all aboard.  A searchlight from the other craft had been turned upon them, lighting _The Hawk_ up like day, while all those aboard could see was the blinding glare, the other boat being shielded by this light.  A shot rang out over the water--the sound of a heavy gun.  Lord Hastings took prompt action, in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14711"],["title","The Boy Allies Under the Sea; Or, The Vanishing Submarines (#7)"],["body"," of the fact he could not make out the enemy.  \"Turn the searchlight on him!\" he shouted.  A second shot rang out and Frank heard the whistle of a heavy missile overhead.  He sprang quickly to the searchlight, and with a single movement, whirled it about. In another moment a second white glare lighted up the sea.  Frank pointed his light squarely at the point from which he could see the other light came. While he was unable to see the other boat, because of its light, he knew that once his own searchlight had found its object, those aboard the other craft would no longer be able to see _The Hawk_.  Then came the sound of a third shot, but this time the missile was not even heard, and Frank knew that he had been successful. The enemy had lost the range.  \"Good!\" shouted Lord Hastings. \"And just in time, I should say. The next shot would have hit us.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Frank quietly. \"He's blinded us, sir, but we have done the same for him. Now what, sir?\"  \"By Jove! I don't know,\" replied Lord Hastings. \"Here, Jack, stand by this forward gun, and be ready to let her go the first moment you can see the enemy. If we can manage to work out from under his light we may be able to get him. Frank, don't you let that light off him a minute.\"  \"I'll keep it on him, sir,\" replied the lad.  So there the two boats were, less than a hundred yards apart, but still unable to do one another harm, unless by a chance shot. For, although the occupants aboard each craft could see the light of the other, they couldn't gauge its origin with accuracy.  Several times the enemy fired, but without result.  \"Well, we've got to do something,\" declared Lord Hastings. \"Can any of you suggest anything?\"  \"I believe I have a plan, sir,\" declared Frank.  \"Let's have it quick,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"Well, sir, I should say that if you would stand by the gun, Jack and I can slip over the side in one of the small boats. We'll make a slight detour, to get out of the blinding glare, then row toward the enemy. Without the light in our eyes, we should be able to pick off a couple of the enemy with rifles. Then he'll have to shift his light to hunt new foes. You can be ready and sink him the moment he does so.\"  \"That's not a half bad idea,\" declared Lord Hastings. \"It shall be done. Over with you, lads.\"  Quickly Frank and Jack got a little boat over the side, procured a rifle apiece, and rowed away.  In spite of the fact that the glare of the enemy's searchlight was squarely upon them, they could not be seen because of the light aboard _The Hawk_ playing upon the eyes of the foe. So, though they rowed rapidly, they knew they were safe enough.  Out of the glare of the searchlight, they shaped their course toward the enemy, whose bulk they could now see looming up in the darkness.  \"By Jove! It's another motorboat,\" Frank whispered.  Jack nodded his head in the darkness, but did not reply.  Less than a hundred feet from the enemy, Frank made out several forms forward.  \"This is close enough,\" he whispered to Jack.  Jack shipped his oars and picked up his rifle. Frank did likewise.  \"You get the one on the left; I'll take the one on the extreme right,\" said Frank. \"Then get the one next your first man if you have time before he ducks, and I'll do the same.\"  \"All right,\" said Jack. \"Give the word when you're ready.\"  \"Ready! Aim! Fire!\" said Frank quietly.  Two sharp cracks broke the stillness of the night, followed almost instantly by two more.  When the lads lowered their rifles and gazed toward the foe, there was not a man in sight.  \"Don't know whether we got them or they just ducked,\" said Frank. \"We'll fire a couple of more shots, enough to make them take their light off _The Hawk_.\"  They did so, and a moment later their efforts were rewarded. The searchlight aboard the enemy, moved by an unseen hand, turned and swept the sea carefully.  \"Row back!\" shouted Frank, and seized his oar.  Jack followed suit. Quickly the little boat was brought about and headed back in the general direction of _The Hawk_.  And the enemy's boat was now lighted up by the glare of _The Hawk_ alone.  Suddenly the flashlight of the enemy fell squarely upon the two boys.  \"We're gone now, unless Lord Hastings sinks them first,\" said Frank quietly.  \"Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!\"  Bullets began to spatter around the two lads. One grazed Frank's ear.  \"Guess we had better go overboard,\" he said, \"They'll----\"  \"Boom!\"  The voice of a single big gun spoke once.  \"_The Hawk!_\" cried Frank.  \"Boom!\"  The voice came again.  And then the boys were left again in darkness as the enemy sought out _The Hawk_ with his searchlight.  \"Boom!\"  It was the third word of the forward gun of _The Hawk_.  Cries of terror and confusion came from the direction of the foe, followed by hoarse German cries of command.  \"Bully for Lord Hastings!\" exclaimed Jack. \"He has scored a hit.\"  \"Hurrah!\" cried Frank, and raised his voice in a series of cheers.  The big gun aboard _The Hawk_ did not speak again, and following _The Hawk's_ searchlight with their eyes, the two lads saw a mass of wreckage floating a short distance away.  \"That,\" said Frank quietly, \"is the end of her.\"  \"Right you are,\" agreed Jack. \"Now we'll go back to _The Hawk_.\"  Both lads bent to their oars with a will.     CHAPTER VIII.  FRANK IN TROUBLE.   Now perfectly happy, the two boys rowed back to _The Hawk_ as rapidly as possible. They were happy for two reasons--first because they were once more in active service, and second, because they had just emerged successfully from a desperate venture.  A light glowed brightly aboard the little motorboat, now that the enemy had been disposed of; so the two lads had no trouble making their way back. Lord Hastings greeted them with outstretched hands as they went over the side.  \"A pretty good job you made of it,\" he declared.  \"Well, we did pick off a couple before you got busy, sir,\" agreed Frank. \"But if you hadn't fired the moment you did they would have potted us sure. They had a couple of shots at us, but fortunately, they didn't have time to get the accurate range.\"  \"I had no idea you were so hard pressed,\" replied Lord Hastings. \"I fired the moment I caught sight of the foe. Even when the searchlight was turned from _The Hawk_, it was a moment or so before I could make out the enemy. The light had all but blinded me.\"  \"There is no harm done, anyhow,\" Jack put in. \"The enemy is at the bottom of the sea and we are safe again.\"  \"Then we may as well continue a bit,\" declared Lord Hastings. He turned to give an order, when Frank interrupted him.  \"Are you sure we are safe, sir?\" he questioned.  \"What do you mean?\" demanded his commander.  \"Why, I was just wondering if by any chance there might be more of the enemy in these waters?\"  \"To tell the truth, I hadn't thought of that,\" replied Lord Hastings.  Without another word, he turned on his heel and made his way to the searchlight, which still threw its brilliant rays across the silent waters. Quickly he snapped it off; then returned to the lads.  \"We won't be spotted so easily now,\" he remarked.  \"Unless we have been spotted already,\" said Jack dryly.  And Jack proved to be a better prophet than he really meant to be.  At a signal from Lord Hastings, _The Hawk_ now moved slowly forward again.  \"Can you tell us just where we are bound, sir?\" asked Jack.  \"Well, not exactly,\" was his commander's reply. \"I have information that leads me to believe an enemy, or several enemies, may be prowling about around----\"  An interruption came suddenly and from an altogether unexpected source, and with the interruption all aboard became suddenly silent, except Lord Hastings, who sprang quickly to the wheel, and before the astonished helmsman knew what was going on, threw the wheel over hard.  For the interruption which had come so suddenly was the voice of a big gun.  Lord Hastings threw the wheel over with such violence that the motorboat careened desperately and all but capsized. Frank and Jack saved themselves from being thrown overboard by a quick grasp at the rail, to which they clung with all their might.  And then, before Lord Hastings could flash the searchlight across the water, had such been his intention, a blinding glare lighted up _The Hawk_. The enemy had been too quick for those aboard.  Now another shot rang out and the boys heard a terrible whistling overhead.  \"Pretty close,\" said Jack quietly. \"They are liable to get us next time.\"  An idea suddenly struck Frank, and he dashed aft. There he picked up his rifle and hurried forward again.  \"Hold her steady a minute, sir,\" he called to Lord Hastings.  And the latter, realizing that the lad had some plan, did as requested without asking a question.  Quickly Frank raised his rifle to his shoulder, and pausing just long enough to take careful aim, fired.  Frank's keen mind had detected the one hope of salvation for those aboard _The Hawk_. The enemy was very close and the lad realized that the next shot must find its mark. There was but one thing to do. The light aboard the enemy must be destroyed; without it _The Hawk_ could escape, for minus the light, which was its eye, the foe could not hope to detect them.  As Frank's finger pressed the trigger he knew that he had not missed; and at the same moment he cried to Lord Hastings:  \"Hard-a-port!\"  Again _The Hawk_ careened desperately in response to the quick turn of the helm; but it was well that Lord Hastings had acted upon the instant; for even as Frank had fired there was another heavy \"boom\" and a heavy shell passed the spot where _The Hawk_ had been a moment before.  But with the sound of the shot, the glare of the enemy's searchlight vanished. Frank's aim had been true.  \"I shot her eye out, sir,\" he cried to Lord Hastings.  \"I see you did,\" chuckled his commander. \"Now it's time for us to get busy. Mr. Templeton, see if you can pick up the enemy with our light.\"  Jack sprang to the searchlight eagerly, and under his guiding"]]]
