She never used an unkind word, but tried to do whatever would please her playmates best.  7. One day, a poor little girl with a very ragged dress was going by and Susie heard some children teasing her and making fun of her.  8. She at once ran out to the gate, and asked the poor little girl to come in. \"What are you crying for?\" Susie asked.  9. \"Because they all laugh at me,\" she said.  10. Then Susie took the little girl into the house. She cheered her up with kind words, and gave her a nice dress and a pair of shoes.  11. This brought real joy and gladness to the poor child, and she, too, thought that Susie was rightly called Sunbeam.

I would steal among them,      Softest light I'd shed,    Until every lily      Raised its drooping head.  2. \"If I were a sunbeam,      I know where I'd go;    Into lowly hovels,      Dark with want and woe:    Till sad hearts looked upward,      I would shine and shine;    Then they'd think of heaven,      Their sweet home and mine.\"  3. Are you not a sunbeam,      Child, whose life is glad    With an inner brightness      Sunshine never had?    Oh, as God has blessed you,      Scatter light divine!    For there is no sunbeam      But must die or shine.

Henry was a kind, good boy. His father was dead, and his mother was very poor. He had a little sister about two years old.  2. He wanted to help his mother, for she could not always earn enough to buy food for her little family.  3. One day, a man gave him a dollar for finding a pocketbook which he had lost.  4. Henry might have kept all the money, for no one saw him when he found it. But his mother had taught him to be honest, and never to keep what did not belong, to him.  5. With the dollar he bought a box, three brushes, and some blacking. He then went to the corner of the street, and said to every one whose boots did not look nice, \"Black your boots, sir, please?\"  6. He was so polite that gentlemen soon began to notice him, and to let him black their boots. The first day he brought home fifty cents, which he gave to his mother to buy food with.  7. When he gave her the money, she said, as she dropped a tear of joy, \"You are a dear, good boy, Henry. I did not know how I could earn enough to buy bread with, but now I think we can manage to get along quite well,\"  8. Henry worked all the day, and went to school in the evening. He earned almost enough to support his mother and his little sister.    LESSON XV.  tread     whis'per     soft'ly     talk     cheer ful'     care'ful   DON'T WAKE THE BABY.

A boy was once sent from home to take a basket of things to his grandmother.  2. The basket was so full that it was very heavy. So his little brother went with him, to help carry the load.  3. They put a pole under the handle of the basket, and each then took hold of an end of the pole. In this way they could carry the basket very nicely.  4. Now the older boy thought, \"My brother Tom does not know about this pole.  5. \"If I slip the basket near him, his side will be heavy, and mine light; but if the basket is in the middle of the pole, it will be as heavy for me as it is for him.  6. \"Tom does not know this as I do. But I will not do it. It would be wrong, and I will not do what is wrong.\"  7. Then he slipped the basket quite near his own end of the pole. His load was now heavier than that of his little brother.  8. Yet he was happy; for he felt that he had done right. Had he deceived his brother, he would not have felt at all happy.

All the day long, with your busy contriving, Into all mischief and fun you are driving; See if your wise little noddle can tell What you are good for. Now ponder it well.\"                   2. Over the carpet the dear little feet Came with a patter to climb on my seat; Two merry eyes, full of frolic and glee, Under their lashes looked up unto me; Two little hands pressing soft on my face, Drew me down close in a loving embrace; Two rosy lips gave the answer so true, \"Good to love you, mamma, good to love you.\"                               Emily Huntington Miller.

The kingbird is not bigger than a robin.  2. He eats flies, and worms, and bugs, and berries.  3. He builds his nest in a tree, near some house.  4. When there are young ones in the nest, he sits on the top of a tree near them.  5. He watches to see that no bird comes to hurt them or their mother.  6. If a hawk, a crow, or even an eagle comes near, he makes a dash at it.  7. Though he is so small, he is brave, and he is also very active.  8. He never fails to drive off other birds from his nest.  9. He flies around and around the eagle, and suddenly strikes him with his sharp bill.  10. He strikes at his eye, and then darts away before the eagle can catch him.  11. Or he strikes from behind, and is off again before the eagle can turn round.  12. In a short time, the great eagle is tired of such hard blows, and flies away. He is very glad to get rid of his foe.  13. Is not the little fellow a brave bird?  14. Because he can drive off all other birds, he is called the KINGBIRD.

Under a great tree in the woods, two boys saw a fine, large nut, and both ran to get it.  2. James got to it first, and picked it up.  3. \"It is mine,\" said John, \"for I was the first to see it.\"  4. \"No, it is mine\" said James, \"for I was the first to pick it up.\"  [Illustration: Three boys standing by a fence, one older than the others.]  5. Thus, they at once began to quarrel about the nut.  6. As they could not agree whose it should be, they called an older boy, and asked him.  7. The older boy said, \"I will settle this quarrel.\"  8. He took the nut, and broke the shell. He then took out the kernel, and divided the shell into two parts, as nearly equal as he could.  9. \"This half of the shell,\" said he, \"belongs to the boy who first saw the nut.  10. \"And this half belongs to the boy who picked it up.  11. \"The kernel of the nut, I shall keep as my pay for settling the quarrel.  12. \"This is the way,\" said he, laughing, \"in which quarrels are very apt to end.\"    LESSON XXI.  crea'tures    drones     in'side    hive     i'dle  de fense'     driv'en    killed     cells    size  work'ers      queen      stings     shape    wax   THE BEE.  1. Bees live in a house that is called a hive. They are of three kinds,--workers, drones, and queens.  2. Only one queen can live in each hive. If she is lost or dead, the other bees will stop their work.  [Illustration: Three bee-hives; wooden boxes about two feet square and four feet high, with a sloped roof.]  3. They are very wise and busy little creatures. They all join together to build cells of wax for their honey.  4. Each bee takes its proper place, and does its own work. Some go out and gather honey from the flowers; others stay at home and work inside the hive.  5. The cells which they build, are all of one shape and size, and no room is left between them.  6. The cells are not round, but have six sides. 7. Did you ever look into a glass hive to see the bees while at work? It is pleasant to see how busy they always are.  8. But the drones do not work. Before winter comes, all the drones are driven from the hive or killed, that they may not eat the honey which they did not gather.  9. It is not quite safe for children to handle bees. They have sharp stings that they know well how to use in their defense.    SLATE WORK.  [Illustration: Script Exercise:  How doth the little busy bee   Improve each shining hour.

Buzz! buzz! buzz!      This is the song of the bee.    His legs are of yellow;    A jolly, good fellow,      And yet a great worker is he.  2. In days that are sunny    He's getting his honey;    In days that are cloudy      He's making his wax:    On pinks and on lilies,    And gay daffodillies,    And columbine blossoms,      He levies a tax!  3. Buzz! buzz! buzz!    The sweet-smelling clover,    He, humming, hangs over;    The scent of the roses      Makes fragrant his wings:    He never gets lazy;    From thistle and daisy,    And weeds of the meadow,      Some treasure he brings.  4. Buzz! buzz! buzz!    From morning's first light    Till the coming of night,    He's singing and toiling      The summer day through.

Mary Armstrong was a pretty little girl, but she was heedless about some things.  2. Her way of leaving her books and playthings just where she had used them last, gave her mother much trouble in picking them up and putting them in their proper places.  3. She had often told Mary the evil effects of being so careless. Her books became spoiled, and her toys broken.  4. But worse than this was the growing habit of carelessness, which would be of great harm to her all her life. It would make her unhappy, and would annoy her friends.  5. One day Mary and her mother went out into their pleasant yard, to spend an hour in the open air. Mrs. Armstrong took her work with her.  6. Mary ran about and played with Dash, her pet dog, and was having a happy time.  7. But in a corner of the yard she found her nicest doll all torn and broken, and its dress covered with mud.  8. She knew, at once, that Dash had done this, and she scolded him harshly.  9. Carrying the broken doll to her mamma. she showed it to her, and could hardly keep from crying.  10. Mrs. Armstrong asked Mary if she had not left the doll on the porch where Dash could easily get it; and Mary had to answer, \"Yes, ma'am.\"  11. \"Then you must not blame the dog, Mary, for he does not know it is wrong for him to play with your doll. I hope this will be a lesson to you hereafter, to put your things away when you are through playing.\"  12. \"I will try,\" said Mary. And her mother promised to mend the doll as well as she could.

Sheep are washed and sheared some time in the month of June. This should be done quite early in the month, before the hot days begin.  2. It is fine sport for those who look on, but not much fun for the sheep.   3. It is best for the sheep to have the wool taken off; otherwise they would suffer in the summer time.  4. When the time comes for washing the sheep, they are driven to a pond or a little river.  5. Then they are thrown into the water, one at a time. The men who are in the water catch them, and squeeze the wet wool with their hands to get the dirt all out of it.  6. Then the wool is thoroughly dried, the sheep are taken to the shearer; and he cuts off the wool with a large pair of shears.  7. It is then dyed, spun, and woven into cloth.  8. In a short time, before the cold winter comes, new wool grows out on the sheep. By the corning of spring there is so much, that it must be cut off again.

Little Patty lives in a log house near a great forest. She has no sisters, and her big brothers are away all day helping their father.  2. But Patty is never lonely; for, though the nearest house is miles away, she has many little friends. Here are two of them that live in the woods.  3. But how did Patty teach them to be so tame? Patty came to the woods often, and was always so quiet and gentle that the squirrels soon found they need not be afraid of her.  4. She brought her bread and milk to eat under the trees, and was sure to leave crumbs for the squirrels.  5. When they came near, she sat very still and watched them. So, little by little, she made them her friends, till, at last, they would sit on her shoulder, and eat from her hand.  6. Squirrels build for themselves summer houses. Those are made of leaves, and sticks, and moss. They are nice and cool for summer, but would never do for the winter cold and snow.  7. So these wise little people find a hollow in an old tree. They make it warm and snug with soft moss and leaves; and here the squirrels live all through the long winter.

Sam had spent all his money for the book, but he was a happy boy.  3. At length he came into the highroad, where there was a gate. A blind man stood, holding it open.  4. The poor man said, \"Please give me a few cents to buy some bread!\" But Sam gave him nothing.  5. What! did Sam give the poor blind man nothing? Yes; for, as I told you, he had spent all his money.  6. So Sam walked on, very sad. Soon after, a fine carriage came up, and in it were Harry and his mother.  7. The blind man stood, and held out his hat. \"Let us give the poor man something,\" said Harry to his mother.  8. His mother gave him some cents. Harry took them, but did not put them into the man's hat.  9. He threw them into the hedge as far as he could. The poor man could not find them, for, you know, ho was blind.  10. Sam had turned back to look at the fine carriage. He saw Harry throw the cents into the hedge; so he came back at once, and looked for the money until he found it all for the blind man.  11. This took so long a time, that he almost lost his supper.  12. Which of the boys do you think was truly kind to the poor man?  13. I know which he thanked most in his heart.
