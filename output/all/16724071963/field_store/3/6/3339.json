I reined Shylock sharply out of the trail, saw a place where the fence looked a bit lower than the average, and put him straight at it with quirt and spurs. He would have swung off, but I've ridden to hounds, and I had seen hunters go over worse places; I held him to it without mercy. He laid back his ears, then, and went over--and his hind feet caught the top wire and snapped it like thread. I heard it hum through the air, and I heard those behind me shout as though something unlooked-for had happened. I turned, saw them gathered on the other side looking after me blankly, and I waved my hat airily in farewell and went on about my business.  [Illustration: \"His hind feet caught the top wire and snapped it like thread.\"]  I felt that they would scarcely chase me the whole twelve or fifteen miles of the pass, and I was right; after I turned the first bend I saw them no more.  At camp I was received with much astonishment, particularly when Ballard saw that I had brought an answer to his note.  \"Yuh must 'a' rode King's Highway,\" he said, looking at me much as Perry Potter had done the night before.  I told him I did, and the boys gathered round and wanted to know how I did it. I told them about jumping the fence, and my conceit got a hard blow there; with one accord they made it plain that I had done a very foolish thing. Range horses, they assured me, are not much at jumping, as a rule; and wire-fences are their special abhorrence. Frosty Miller told me, in confidence, that he didn't know which was the bigger fool, Shylock or me, and he hoped I'd never be guilty of another trick like that.  That rather took the bloom off my adventure, and I decided, after much thought, that I agreed with Frosty: King's Highway was bad medicine. I amended that a bit, and excepted Beryl King; I did not think she was \"bad medicine,\" however acid might be her flavor.     CHAPTER VI.  I ask Beryl King to Dance.   If I were just yarning for the fun there is in it, I should say that I was back in King's Highway, helping Beryl King gather posies and brush up her repartee, the very next morning--or the second, at the very latest. As a matter of fact, though, I steered clear of that pass, and behaved myself and stuck to work for six long weeks; that isn't saying I never thought about her, though.  On the very last day of June, as nearly as I could estimate, Frosty rode into Kenmore for something, and came back with that in his eyes that boded mischief; his words, however, were innocent enough for the most straight-laced.  \"There's things doing in Kenmore,\" he remarked to a lot of us. \"Old King has a party of aristocrats out from New York, visiting--Terence Weaver, half-owner in the mines, and some women; they're fixing to celebrate the Fourth with a dance. The women, it seems, are crazy to see a real Montana dance, and watch the cowboys _chasse_ around the room in their chaps and spurs and big hats, and with two or three six-guns festooned around their middles, the way you see them in pictures. They think, as near as I could find out, that cowboys always go to dances in full war-paint like that--and they'll be disappointed if said cowboys don't punctuate the performance by shooting out the lights, every so often.\" He looked across at me, and then is when I observed the mischief brewing in his eyes.  \"We'll have to take it in,\" I said promptly. \"I'm anxious to see a Montana dance, myself.\"  \"We aren't in their set,\" gloomed Frosty, with diplomatic caution. \"I won't swear they're sending out engraved invitations, but, all the same, we won't be expected.\"  \"We'll go, anyhow,\" I answered boldly. \"If they want to see cow-punchers, it seems to me the Ragged H can enter a bunch that will take first prize.\"  Frosty looked at me, and permitted himself to smile. \"Uh course, if you're bound to go, Ellis, I guess there's no stopping yuh--and some of us will naturally have to go along to see yuh through. King's minions would sure do things to yuh if yuh went without a body-guard.\" He shook his head, and cupped his hands around a match-blaze and a cigarette, so that no one could tell much about his expression.  \"I'm bound to go,\" I declared, taking the cue. \"And I think I do need some of you to back me up. I think,\" I added judicially, \"I shall need the whole bunch.\"  The \"bunch\" looked at one another gravely and sighed. \"We'll have t' go, I reckon,\" they said, just as though they weren't dying to play the unexpected guest. So that was decided, and there was much whispering among groups when they thought the wagon-boss was near, and much unobtrusive preparation.  It happened that the wagons pulled in close to the ranch the day before the Fourth, intending to lay over for a day or so. We were mighty glad of it, and hurried through our work. I don't know why the rest were so anxious to attend that dance, but for me, I'm willing to own that I wanted to see Beryl King. I knew she'd be there--and if I didn't manage, by fair means or foul, to make her dance with me, I should be very much surprised and disappointed. I couldn't remember ever giving so much thought to a girl; but I suppose it was because she was so frankly antagonistic that there was nothing tame about our intercourse. I can't like girls who invariably say just what you expect them to say.  When we came to get ready, there was a dress-discussion that a lot of women would find it hard to beat. Some of the boys wanted to play up to, the aristocrats' expectations, and wear their gaudiest neckerchiefs, their chaps, spurs, and all the guns they could get their hands on; but I had an idea I thought beat theirs, and proselyted for all I was worth. Rankin had packed a lot of dress suits in one of my trunks--evidently he thought Montana was some sort of house-party--and I wanted to build a surprise for the good people at King's. I wanted the boys to use those suits to the best advantage.  At first they hung back. They didn't much like the idea of wearing borrowed clothes--which attitude I respected, but felt bound to overrule. I told them it was no worse than borrowing guns, which a lot of them were doing. In the end my oratory was rewarded as it deserved; it was decided that, as even my capacious trunks couldn't be expected to hold thirty dress suits, part of the crowd should ride in full regalia. I might \"tog up\" as many as possible, and said \"togged\" men must lend their guns to the others; for every man of the \"reals\" insisted on wearing a gun dangling over each hip.  So I went down into my trunks, and disinterred four dress suits and three Tuxedos, together with all the appurtenances thereto. Oh, Rankin was certainly a wonder! There was a gay-colored smoking-jacket and cap that one of the boys took a fancy to and insisted on wearing, but I drew the line at that. We nearly had a fight over it, right there.  When we were dressed--and I had to valet the whole lot of them, except Frosty, who seemed wise to polite apparel--we were certainly a bunch of winners. Modesty forbids explaining just how _I_ appear in a dress suit. I will only say that my tailor knew his business--but the others were fearful and wonderful to look upon. To begin with, not all of them stand six-feet-one in their stocking-feet, or tip the scales at a hundred and eighty odd; likewise their shoulders lacked the breadth that goes with the other measurements. Hence my tailor would doubtless have wept at the sight; shoulders drooping spiritlessly, and sleeves turned up, and trousers likewise. Frosty Miller, though, was like a man with his mask off; he stood there looking the gentleman born, and I couldn't help staring at him.  \"You've been broken to society harness, old man, and are bridle-wise,\" I said, slapping him on the shoulder. He whirled on me savagely, and his face was paler than I'd ever seen it.  \"And if I have--what the hell is it to you?\" he asked unpleasantly, and I stammered out some kind of apology. Far be it from me to pry into a man's past.  I straightened Sandy Johnson's tie, turned up his sleeves another inch, and we started out. And I will say we were a quaint-looking outfit. Perhaps my meaning will be clearer when I say that every one of us wore the soft, white \"Stetson\" of the range-land, and a silk handkerchief knotted loosely around the throat, and spurs and riding-gloves. I've often wondered if the range has ever seen just that wedding of the East and the West before in man's apparel.  We'd scarcely got started when the wind caught Frosty's coat-tails and slapped them down along the flanks of his horse--an incident that the horse met with stern disapproval. He went straight up into the air, and then bucked as long as his wind held out, the while Frosty's quirt kept time with the tails of his coat.  When the two had calmed down a bit, the other boys profited by Frosty's experience, and tucked the coat-tails snugly under them--and those who wore the Tuxedos congratulated themselves on their foresight. We were a merry party, and we were willing to publish the fact.  When we had overtaken the others we were still merrier, for the spectacular contingent plumed themselves like peacocks on their fearsomeness, and guyed us conventionally garbed fellows unmercifully.  When the thirty of us filed into the long, barn-like hall where they were having the dance, I believe I can truthfully say that we created a sensation. That \"ripple of excitement\" which we read about so often in connection with belles and balls went round the room. Frosty and I led the way, and the rest of the \"biscuit-shooter brigade,\" as the others called us, followed two by two. Then came the real Wild West show, with their hats tilted far back on their heads and brazen faces which it pained me to contemplate. We arrived during that humming hash which comes just after a number, and every one stared impolitely, and some of them not overcordially. I began to wonder if we hadn't done a rather ill-bred"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],["title","Music Talks with Children (#0)"],["body","TALKS WITH CHILDREN  by  THOMAS TAPPER  Philadelphia Theodore Presser  1898          \"Dear child! dear girl! that walkest with me here,   If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,   Thy nature is not therefore less divine:        *       *       *       *       *   \"God being with thee when we know it not.\"                              --WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.

PREFACE   A book of this kind, though addressed to children, must necessarily reach them through an older person. The purpose is to suggest a few of the many aspects which music may have even to the mind of a child. If these chapters, or whatever may be logically suggested by them, be actually used as the basis of simple Talks with children, music may become to them more than drill and study. They should know it as an art, full of beauty and of dignity; full of pure thought and abounding in joy. Music with these characteristics is the true music of the heart. Unless music gives true pleasure to the young it may be doubted if it is wisely studied.  Our failure to present music to the young in a manner that interests and holds them is due not so much to the fact that music is too difficult for children, but because the children themselves are too difficult for us. In our ignorance we often withhold the rightful inheritance. We must not forget that the slower adult mind often meets a class of difficulties which are not recognized by the unprejudiced child. It is not infrequent that with the old fears in us we persist in recreating difficulties.  There should be ever present with the teacher the thought that music must be led out of the individuality, not driven into it.  The teacher's knowledge is not a hammer, it is a light.  While it is suggested that these chapters be used as the subject-matter for talks with the children, they may read verbatim if desired. All foot-note references and suggestions are addressed to the older person--the mother or the teacher. There is much in the literature of art that would interest children if given to them discriminatingly.  THOMAS TAPPER.  BOSTON, October 30, 1896     CONTENTS   CHAPTER         PREFACE      I.

It abounds in high artistic thought and insight.\"--_The Boston Times._     CHAPTER I.  WHAT THE FACE TELLS.     \"And the light _dwelleth_ with him.\"--_Daniel II: 22._   Once a master said to a child:  \"If thou wilt study diligently, learn, and do good unto others, thy face shall be filled with light.\"  So the child studied busily, learned, and sought how she could do good unto others. And every little while she ran to the glass to see if the light was coming. But at each time she was disappointed. No light was there. Try as faithfully as she would, and look as often as she would, it was always the same.  I do not know if she doubted the master or not; but it is certain she did not know what to make of it. She grieved, and day after day her disappointment grew. At length she could bear it no longer, so she went to the master and said:  \"Dear master, I have been so diligent! I have tried to learn and to do good unto others. Yet every time I have sought in my face the light _which you promised_, it has not been there. No, not a single time.\"  Now the master listened intently, and watching her face as she spoke, he said:  \"Thou poor little one, in this moment, as thou hast spoken to me, thy face has been so filled with light that thou wouldst not believe. And dost thou know why? It is because every word thou hast spoken in this moment has come from thy heart.  \"Thou must learn _in the first days_ this lesson: When the thought and the deed are in the heart, then the light is in the face, always, and it is there at no other time. It could not be. And what is in thy heart when thou art before the glass? In that moment hast thou turned away from diligence, and from learning, and from the love of doing good unto others and in thy heart there is left only the poor curiosity to see the light which can never shine when it is sought. Thou canst never see the light of thy own face. For thee that light is forever within, and it will not prosper thy way to want to look upon it. It is only as thou art faithful that this is added unto thee.\"  Sorrowing yet more than before the little child said:  \"Master, I do not understand what thou hast said, yet I believe thee; but the wish is yet within me to see the light of my face, if only for once. Thou who art wise, tell me why it is denied me.\"  And the master made answer:  \"It is denied to us all. No one may see the light of his own face. Therefore thou shalt labor daily with diligence that thy light shall shine before others. And if thou wouldst see the light thou shalt cause it to shine _in another_. That is the greatest of all--to bring forth the light. And to do this, thou shalt of thyself be faithful in all things. By what thou art thou must show diligence, the love for learning, and the desire to do good unto others, even as these things have been taught thee.\"     CHAPTER II.  WHY WE SHOULD STUDY MUSIC.     \"Music makes people more gentle and meek, more modest and   understanding.\"--_Martin Luther._[1]  It was this same music lover who said once, \"Music is the fairest gift of God.\" Just these words should be a sufficient answer to the question which we have asked in this Talk, but a little more may make it clearer. Here we are, gathered together to talk about music. We know music is pleasing; to many of us it is even more than a pleasure; of course, it is difficult to get the lessons properly and we must struggle and strive. Often the way seems so rude and stony that we cannot advance. We are hurt, and hot tears of discouragement come, and we sit down dejected feeling it were best never to try again. But even when the tears flow the fastest we feel something within us which makes us listen. We can really hear our thoughts battling to tell us something,--prompted by the heart, we may be sure.  And what is music making our thoughts say?  \"Have I not been a pleasure and a comfort to you? Have I not set you to singing and to dancing many and many times? Have I not let you sing your greatest happiness? And am I not ever about you, at home, in school, in church? even in the streets I have never deserted you. Always, _always_ I have made you merry. But this was music you _heard_. Now you have said you wished to know me yourself; to have me come to dwell in your heart that you might have me understandingly, and because I ask labor of you for this, you sit here with your hot tears in your eyes and not a bit of me present in your heart. Listen! Am I not there? Yes, just a bit. Now more and more, and now will you give me up because I make you work a little?\"  Well, we all have just this experience and we always feel ashamed of our discouragements; but even this does not tell us why we should study music. Some people study it because they have to do so; others because they love it. Surely it must be best with those who out of their hearts choose to learn about tones and the messages they tell.  Did you ever notice how people seem willing to stop any employment if music comes near? Even in the busiest streets of a city the organ-man will make us listen to his tunes. In spite of the hurry and the crowd and the jumble of noises, still the organ-tones go everywhere clear, full, melodious, bidding us heed them. Perhaps we mark the music with the hand, or walk differently, or begin to sing with it. In one way or another the music will make us do something--that shows its power. I have seen in many European towns a group of children about the organ-man,[2] dancing or singing as he played and enjoying every tune to the utmost. This taught me that music of every kind has its lover, and that with a little pains and a little patience the love for music belongs to all alike, and may be increased if other things do not push it aside.  Now, one of the first things to be said of music is that it makes happiness, and what makes happiness is good for us, because happiness not only lightens the heart, but it is one of the best ways to make the light come to the face. The moment we study music we learn a severe lesson, and that is this: There can be no use in our trying to be musicians"]]]
