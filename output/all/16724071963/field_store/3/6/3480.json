[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1452"],["title","Native Life in South Africa (#4)"],["body"," first year of the Union, it would seem that General Botha made an honest attempt to live up to his London promises, that are mentioned by Mr. Merriman in his speech (reproduced elsewhere) on the second reading of the Bill in Parliament.  It would seem that General Botha endeavoured to allay British apprehensions and concern for the welfare of the Native population.  In pursuance of this policy General Botha won the approbation of all Natives by appointing Hon. H. Burton, a Cape Minister, to the portfolio of Native Affairs.  That the appointment was a happy one, from the native point of view, became manifest when Mr. Burton signalized the ushering in of Union, by releasing Chief Dinizulu-ka-Cetywayo, who at that time was undergoing a sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Natal Supreme Court, and by the restoration to Dinizulu of his pension of 500 Pounds a year. Also, in deference to the wishes of the Native Congress, Mr. Burton abrogated two particularly obnoxious Natal measures, one legalizing the \"Sibalo\" system of forced labour, the other prohibiting public meetings by Natives without the consent of the Government. These abrogations placed the Natives of Natal in almost the same position as the Cape Natives though without giving them the franchise. So, too, when a drastic Squatters' Bill was gazetted early in 1912, and the recently formed Native National Congress sent a deputation to interview Mr. Burton in Capetown; after hearing the deputation, he graciously consented to withdraw the proposed measure, pending the allotment of new Locations in which Natives evicted by such a measure could find an asylum.  In further deference to the representations of the Native Congress, in which they were supported by Senators the Hon. W. P. Schreiner, Colonel Stanford, and Mr. Krogh, the Union Government gazetted another Bill in January, 1911, to amend an anomaly which, at that time, was peculiar to the \"Free\" State: an anomaly under which a Native can neither purchase nor lease land, and native landowners in the \"Free\" State could only sell their land to the white people.  The gazetted Bill proposed to legalize only in one district of the Orange \"Free\" State the sale of landed property by a Native to another Native as well as to a white man, but it did not propose to enable Natives to buy land from white men.  The object of the Bill was to remove a hardship, mentioned elsewhere in this sketch, by which a \"Free\" State Native was by law debarred from inheriting landed property left to him under his uncle's will.  But against such small attempts at reform, proposed or carried out by the Union Government in the interest of the Natives, granted in small instalments of a teaspoonful at a time -- reforms dictated solely by feelings of justice and equity -- ex-Republicans were furious.  From platform, Press, and pulpit it was suggested that General Botha's administration was too pro-English and needed overhauling. The Dutch peasants along the countryside were inflamed by hearing that their gallant leader desired to Anglicize the country. Nothing was more repellent to the ideas of the backveld Dutch, and so at small meetings in the country districts resolutions were passed stating that the Botha administration had outlived its usefulness. These resolutions reaching the Press from day to day had the effect of stirring up the Dutch voters against the Ministry, and particularly against the head.  At this time General Botha's sound policy began to weaken.  He transferred Hon. H. Burton, first Minister of Natives, to the portfolio of Railways and Harbours, and appointed General Hertzog, of all people in the world, to the portfolio of Native Affairs.  The good-humoured indulgence of some Dutch and English farmers towards their native squatters, and the affectionate loyalty of some of these native squatters in return, will cause a keen observer, arriving at a South African farm, to be lost in admiration for this mutual good feeling. He will wonder as to the meaning of the fabled bugbear anent the alleged struggle between white and black, which in reality appears to exist only in the fertile brain of the politician.  Thus let the new arrival go to one of the farms in the Bethlehem or Harrismith Districts for example, and see how willingly the Native toils in the fields; see him gathering in his crops and handing over the white farmer's share of the crop to the owner of the land; watch the farmer receiving his tribute from the native tenants, and see him deliver the first prize to the native tenant who raised the largest crop during that season; let him also see both the Natives and the landowning white farmers following to perfection the give-and-take policy of \"live and let live\", and he will conclude that it would be gross sacrilege to attempt to disturb such harmonious relations between these people of different races and colours. But with a ruthless hand the Natives' Land Act has succeeded in remorselessly destroying those happy relations.  First of all, General Hertzog, the new Minister of Native Affairs, travelled up and down the country lecturing farmers on their folly in letting ground to the Natives; the racial extremists of his party hailed him as the right man for the post, for, as his conduct showed them, he would soon \"fix up\" the Natives.  At one or two places he was actually welcomed as the future Prime Minister of the Union. On the other hand, General Botha, who at that time seemed to have become visibly timid, endeavoured to ingratiate himself with his discontented supporters by joining his lieutenant in travelling to and fro, denouncing the Dutch farmers for not expelling the Natives from their farms and replacing them with poor whites. This became a regular Ministerial campaign against the Natives, so that it seemed clear that if any Native could still find a place in the land, it was not due to the action of the Government. In his campaign the Premier said other unhappy things which were diametrically opposed to his London speeches of two years before; and while the Dutch colonists railed at him for trying to Anglicize the country, English speakers and writers justly accused him of speaking with two voices; cartoonists, too, caricatured him as having two heads -- one, they said, for London, and the second one for South Africa.  The uncertain tenure by which Englishmen in the public service held their posts became the subject of debates in the Union Parliament, and the employment of Government servants of colour was decidedly precarious. They were swept out of the Railway and Postal Service with a strong racial broom, in order to make room for poor whites, mainly of Dutch descent.  Concession after concession was wrung from the Government by fanatical Dutch postulants for office, for Government doles and other favours, who, like the daughters of the horse-leech in the Proverbs of Solomon, continually cried, \"Give, give.\" By these events we had clearly turned the corner and were pacing backwards to pre-Union days, going back, back, and still further backward, to the conditions which prevailed in the old Republics, and (if a check is not applied) we shall steadily drift back to the days of the old Dutch East Indian administration.  The Bill which proposed to ameliorate the \"Free\" State cruelty, to which reference has been made above, was dropped like a hot potato. Ministers made some wild and undignified speeches, of which the following spicy extract, from a speech by the Rt. Hon. Abraham Fischer to his constituents at Bethlehem, is a typical sample --  \"What is it you want?\" he asked.  \"We have passed all the coolie* laws and we have passed all the Kafir laws.  The `Free' State has been safeguarded and all her colour laws have been adopted by Parliament. What more can the Government do for you?\"  And so the Union ship in this reactionary sea sailed on and on and on, until she struck an iceberg -- the sudden dismissal of General Hertzog.  -- * A contemptuous South African term for British Indians. --  To the bitter sorrow of his admirers, General Hertzog, who is the fearless exponent of Dutch ideals, was relieved of his portfolios of Justice and Native Affairs -- it was whispered as a result of a suggestion from London; and then the Dutch extremists, in consequence of their favourite's dismissal, gave vent to their anger in the most disagreeable manner.  One could infer from their platform speeches that, from their point of view, scarcely any one else had any rights in South Africa, and least of all the man with a black skin.  In the face of this, the Government's timidity was almost unendurable. They played up to the desires of the racial extremists, with the result that a deadlock overtook the administration.  Violent laws like the Immigration Law (against British Indians and alien Asiatics) and the Natives' Land were indecently hurried through Parliament to allay the susceptibilities of \"Free\" State Republicans.  No Minister found time to undertake such useful legislation as the Coloured People's Occupation Bill, the Native Disputes Bill, the Marriage Bill, the University Bill, etc., etc. An apology was demanded from the High Commissioner in London for delivering himself of sentiments which were felt to be too British for the palates of his Dutch employers in South Africa, and the Prime Minister had almost to apologize for having at times so far forgotten himself as to act more like a Crown Minister than a simple Africander. \"Free\" State demands became so persistent that Ministers seemed to have forgotten the assurances they gave His Majesty's Government in London regarding the safety of His Majesty's coloured subjects within the Union. They trampled under foot their own election pledges, made during the first Union General Election, guaranteeing justice and fair treatment to the law-abiding Natives.  The campaign, to compass the elimination of the blacks from the farms, was not at all popular with landowners,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1452"],["title","Native Life in South Africa (#5)"],["body","made huge profits out of the renting of their farms to Natives. Platform speakers and newspaper writers coined an opprobrious phrase which designated this letting of farms to Natives as \"Kafir-farming\", and attempted to prove that it was almost as immoral as \"baby-farming\". But landowners pocketed the annual rents, and showed no inclination to substitute the less industrious \"poor whites\" for the more industrious Natives.  Old Baas M----, a typical Dutch landowner of the \"Free\" State, having collected his share of the crop of 1912, addressing a few words of encouragement to his native tenants, on the subject of expelling the blacks from the farms, said in the Taal: \"How dare any number of men, wearing tall hats and frock coats, living in Capetown hotels at the expense of other men, order me to evict my Natives?  This is my ground; it cost my money, not Parliament's, and I will see them banged (barst) before I do it.\"  It then became evident that the authority of Parliament would have to be sought to compel the obstinate landowners to get rid of their Natives.  And the compliance of Parliament with this demand was the greatest Ministerial surrender to the Republican malcontents, resulting in the introduction and passage of the Natives' Land Act of 1913, inasmuch as the Act decreed, in the name of His Majesty the King, that pending the adoption of a report to be made by a commission, somewhere in the dim and unknown future, it shall be unlawful for Natives to buy or lease land, except in scheduled native areas. And under severe pains and penalties they were to be deprived of the bare human rights of living on the land, except as servants in the employ of the whites -- rights which were never seriously challenged under the Republican regime, no matter how politicians raved against the Natives.     Chapter II      The Grim Struggle between Right and Wrong,                   and the Latter Carries the Day    Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness     which they have prescribed;   To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the fruit     from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey,     and that they may rob the fatherless.                                        Isaiah.    On February 18, 1913, General L. Lemmer, member for Marico, Transvaal, asked the Minister of Lands: --  (a)  How many farms or portions of farms in the Transvaal Province have during the last three years been registered in the names of Natives; (b) what is the extent of the land so registered; and (c) how much was paid for it?  The Minister of Lands replied:  (a) 78 farms; (b) 144,416 morgen; and (c) 94,907 Pounds.  Some very disturbing elements suggest themselves in this question and in its prompt answer.  A question of the kind should have taken some time to reach Pretoria from the seat of Parliament; more time to search for and compile the necessary information, and further time to get the answer to the Table of the House of Assembly in Capetown. For instance, on March 11 Mr. T. L. Schreiner called for an explanation in connexion with the same return.  He had to ask again on April 1, the answer in each instance being that the required \"information had been telegraphed for and would be laid on the table when it is available\" (vide Union Hansard, pp. 777 and 1,175).  It was only on May 13 -- two months and two days after -- that an answer to Mr. Schreiner's question of March 11 could be furnished.  Again, on May 20 Mr. Schreiner called for a similar return, embracing the four Provinces of the Union.*  If it were so easy for General Lemmer to get a reply in regard to the Transvaal, where most of the registration took place, it should have been relatively more easy to add the information from the Cape and Natal, since no registration could have taken place in the Orange \"Free\" State, where Natives cannot buy land.  But strange to say, all that Mr. Schreiner could get out of the Minister was a promise to furnish a reply when it is available, and it does not appear to be on record that it was ever furnished during that session.  Therefore, a Native cannot be blamed for suspecting that when General Lemmer asked his question, the return was \"cut and dried\" and available to be laid on the table as soon as it was called for.  -- * It does not appear to have occurred to any one to call for a return   showing transfers of land from blacks to whites. --  Another significant point is that the questioner did not want to know the extent of land bought by Natives, but of the land \"registered in their names\" during the period; and Mr. Schreiner was able to show later in the session by an analysis of the return that it mainly comprised land awarded to Native tribes by the Republican Government, some of it when they conquered the country. They include farms bought or awarded to Natives as long ago as the early 60's and 70's, but the owners were not able to obtain titles as the late Republican Government did not allow Natives to register land in their own names.  They had been held in trust for them by European friends or missionaries, and it was only during the last three years that the owners claimed direct titles, which right was restored to them since the British occupation.  But the Lemmer Return did its fell work.  It scared every white man in the country.  They got alarmed to hear that Natives had during the past three (!) years \"bought\" land to the extent of 50,000 morgen per annum.  Thanks to Mr. Schreiner's questions, however, the misleading features of the statistical scarecrow were revealed -- but, unfortunately too late.       Origin of the Trouble  On February 28, 1913, Mr. J. G. Keyter (a \"Free\" State member) moved: That the Government be requested to submit to the House DURING THE PRESENT SESSION a general Pass and Squatters Bill to prohibit coloured people (1) from WANDERING ABOUT WITHOUT A PROPER PASS; (2) from SQUATTING ON FARMS; and (3) from SOWING ON THE SHARE SYSTEM.  Mr. T. P. Brain,* another \"Free\" Stater, seconded the motion.  -- * This gentleman died during 1913. --  Mr. P. G. W. Grobler,* a Transvaaler, moved (as an amendment) to add at the end of the motion:  \"and further TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO RESTRICT THE PURCHASE AND LEASE OF LAND BY NATIVES.\"  -- * Mr. Grobler forfeited his seat when he was convicted of complicity   in the recent rebellion. --  Mr. Schreiner strongly protested against both the motion and the amendment.  The Minister for Native Affairs* spoke somewhat against Mr. Keyter's motion but promised to comply with Mr. Grobler's amendment, which promise he redeemed by introducing a Natives' Land Bill.  -- * Hon. J. W. Sauer, Minister of Native Affairs, died a month after the Bill   became law. --  Before the Bill was introduced, the Minister made the unprecedented announcement that the Governor-General had given his assurance that the Royal Assent would not be withheld from the Natives' Land Bill. Section 65 of the South African Constitution provides that the King may disallow an Act of Parliament within twelve months after the Governor-General signed it.  And the abrogation of the Constitution, as far as this Bill is concerned, literally gave licence to the political libertines of South Africa; as, being thus freed from all legislative restraint, they wasted no further time listening to such trifles as reason and argument.  The following are extracts from the debates on the Natives' Land Bill as reported in the Union Hansard of 1913.  == The adjourned debate on the motion for the second reading of the Natives Land Bill was resumed by  MR. J. X. MERRIMAN (Victoria West).  It was with very great reluctance (the right hon. gentleman said) that he rose to speak on this measure. It would have been more convenient to have given a silent vote, but he felt, and he was afraid, that after many years of devoted attention to this question of the native policy of South Africa, he would not be doing his duty if he did not give this House -- for what it was worth -- the result of his experience through these years.  He should like to emphasize a brighter side of the question, and that was to point out that the Natives, if they were well managed, were an invaluable asset to the people of this country.  (Hear, hear.) Let them take our trade figures and compare them with the trade figures of the other large British Dominions. Our figures were surprising when measured by the white population, but if they took the richest Dominion that there was under the British Crown outside South Africa, and took the trade value of those figures per head of the white population, and multiply those figures by our European population, then they might very well apply any balance they had to our native population, and then they would see, strangely enough, that upon that basis it worked out that the actual trade of three Natives was worth about that of one white man. That, of course, was a very imperfect way of looking at the value of these people, because the trade value of some of these Natives was far greater than the trade value of some of our white people. He had merely indicated these trade figures to show what an enormous asset we had in the Natives in that respect.  Let them think what the industry of the Natives had done for us.  Who had built our railways, who had dug our mines, and developed this country as far as it was developed? Who had been the actual manual worker who had done that?  The Native: the coloured races of this country.  We must never forget that we owed them a debt in that respect -- a debt not often acknowledged by what we did for them.  Proceeding, he said that they ought to think what they owed to the docility of the Natives, and the wonderfully easy way in which they had been governed when treated properly.  He also paid a tribute to the honesty of the Natives.  What must strike any one was the fact that though this Bill was really, to a certain extent, a"]]]
