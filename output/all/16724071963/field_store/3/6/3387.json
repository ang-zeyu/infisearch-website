It has one hundred and seventy-six verses.  It is unique because of its arrangement. It is divided into twenty-two equal parts. Each part contains eight verses.  Again, the 119th Psalm is an acrostic, or an alphabetical Psalm. It is built around the Hebrew alphabet. Each of the twenty-two portions begins with one of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.  The Psalm is unique because of its content. It is given over entirely to a consideration of the law and commandments of God. Indeed, if you will read the Psalm, you will find that every verse says something about the precepts, or the statutes, or the commandments, or the word of God.  The 119th Psalm contains some of the verses with which we are most familiar. \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy word.\" \"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.\" \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\"  The Psalm reaches its highest point, and finds its fullest expression in the 94th verse, three words, \"I am thine.\"  Young people, I want you to read this 119th Psalm, and when you come to the 94th verse I want you to stop and say over very earnestly, very prayerfully, \"I am thine.\" And may you be His for all time is my prayer.  MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 119: 94  \"I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.\"  MEMORY HYMN [342]      _\"Lord, I am thine, entirely thine.\"_     THE FATHER'S CARE   I have here a nut. It is a pecan. It grows in our southern states. It is a well formed nut with a hard shell. This nut I have is cracked. I open it and I notice just inside a thin, brown coating that covers the meat. I touch this coating to my lips. It is bitter and causes me to pucker my lips. This is the Creator's blessed provision for the protection of the nut in its growing stage. The bitter coating keeps insects and pests away.  On my way to church this morning I looked up and saw a long piece of yarn flying across the street at a rapid rate. I wondered what could cause that. Then at the front end of the yarn I saw a bird. The bird flew to the gable of a big house. There, in a protected corner, she was making her nest. The yarn was to be woven into her new spring house. So God gives instinct to birds and all his creatures as a mark of his loving care.  The most delicate, sensitive portion of your body is the eye. When I consider how tender and open to harm the eye is I wonder that so many of us go through life with our eyes unhurt. But God has provided a sleepless protection for our eyes. There is a guard, always on duty. Whenever danger comes near, that guard, our eyelid, closes and effectively wards off impending trouble.  We started with the lowest form of life, an inanimate nut. Now we come to the highest, the soul of man. For in each one of you there is something eternal, something akin to God himself. The name we give that eternal spirit is the soul. For the protection of our soul God gives us faith, a sense of right and wrong, conscience, the still small voice. He surrounds us with Christian homes, the Church, helpful fellowship, the means of grace. All these things are a protection for the soul.  MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 6: 28, 29  \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\"  MEMORY HYMN [517]      _\"While thee I seek, protecting power.\"_     YOKES   A Yoke is a help, not a hindrance. Our first thought is that a yoke is burdensome. A little study reveals to us the great usefulness of the yoke.  Have you ever seen a yoke of oxen? What heavy, slow-moving creatures they are! But they are pullers of heavy loads. These loads could not be drawn by them were they not yoked together.  Now there are different kinds of yokes, that is, there are many ways of rendering easier the carrying of heavy loads. For example, there is the Oriental way. First, there is the manner in which one man will carry a heavy load. He takes a pole, on each end of the pole hangs a rope. Then he divides his load, fastening half of his load to either rope. He gets beneath the pole, which is shaped to fit his shoulder, lifts, and off he trots as easily and jauntily as can be. Sometimes the load is too heavy for one man. He then summons a companion. They get a longer, heavier pole, with a much stouter rope. This time they do not divide the load, rather they keep it together. They fasten the rope securely about it, and then tie it about the pole. The men stoop, one at each end of the heavy pole. They stand up straight, the load is lifted from the ground, only a few inches perhaps, but enough to clear the ground, then, singing and laughing, keeping perfect time each with the other, they swing down the street. It is incredible the heavy loads they carry. I could not believe my eyes when I looked upon some of them.  Jesus perfectly understood the helpfulness and value of the yoke. He made it most beautiful in that he told his followers that he would help them, that he would carry his part of the burden, that he would share with them the other side of the yoke.  MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 11: 29-30      \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly     in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is     easy and my burden is light.\"  MEMORY HYMN [449]      _\"My times are in thy hand.\"_     GOOD ADVICE   Most of us, men and women as well as girls and boys, do not take kindly to advice. We very much prefer that people keep their advice to themselves. There are times, however, when we are compelled to listen to advice, because of the source. Here is a bit of advice that commands our attention. It is from the great English novelist, Charles Dickens.  Charles Dickens' youngest boy, Edward, left home when he was sixteen years of age and went to Australia. His father wrote him a parting letter, which is worth while for all boys, whether or no they leave home. In that letter the great Dickens said,  \"I put a New Testament among your books for the very same reasons and with the very same hopes that made me write an easy account of it for you when you were a little child. Because it is the best book that ever was or ever will be in the world. And because it teaches you the best lessons by which any human creature who tries to be truthful and faithful to duty can possibly be guided. As your brothers have gone away, one by one, I have written to each such words as I am now writing to you and have entreated them all to guide themselves by this book, putting aside the interpretations and inventions of men. Never abandon the wholesome practice of saying your own private prayers, night and morning. I have never abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of it.\"  Now that we are done reading this letter it does not sound like advice at all, does it. It is all so wholesome and sturdy that we feel like speaking right out loud, \"Thank you, Mr. Dickens, thank you very much.\"  MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 119: 9      \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his ways? By taking heed     thereto according to thy word.\"  MEMORY HYMN [205]      _\"Lamp of our feet.\"_     IF I WERE A BOY AGAIN   Chicago University, one of the great schools of America and the world, received its impetus from the tireless energy and brilliant leadership of its great President, Dr. Harper. After his death there was found among his papers a memorandum which read as follows:  \"If I were a boy again I would strive to find out from goods books how good men lived.  \"If I were a boy again I would study the Bible even more than I did. I would make it a mental companion. The Bible is a necessity for every boy.  \"If I were a boy again I would more and more cultivate the company of those older whose graces of person and mind would help me on in my good work. I would always seek good company.  \"If I were a boy again I would study the life and character of our Saviour, persistently, that I might become more and more like unto him.\"  Now President Harper was a great, wise and good man. If he felt that he would do certain things were he a boy again, surely the rest of us could improve upon our boyhood years had we the chance.  If I were a boy again I would be more attentive to Church and Sunday School and the things that were taught me there. If I were a boy again I would get my day school lessons with greater care. If I were a boy again I would be more obedient to and more thoughtful of my parents.  Why should I talk like this, for I cannot be a boy again? But you boys have your boyhood. It is a present reality. Let President Harper teach you. Be the boy he pictures.  MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 103: 1-5      \"Bless the Lord, O my soul ... who satisfieth thy mouth with good     things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.\"  MEMORY HYMN [678]      _\"By cool Siloam's shady rill.\"_     ONE BY ONE   Here is this great church building. It is a beautiful structure, is it not? It is so substantial, it has stood here so many years, we take it so for granted that it seems as though it had always been here. But there was a day when the ground upon which this building stands was vacant ground. Then men came with picks and shovels, wagons and plows, and set to work. They laid the foundations, stone upon stone. Then the walls rose, stone upon stone. Then the spire, stone upon stone, until the very peak was reached, for our church is stone from the foundation to the top of the spire. How were these thousands of stones put in place? One by one.  Think also of the roof of our church. It is a tile roof. How in the world did they get all those tiles up on the roof and fitted in place? Did some man who was very strong stand back and throw a handful of tile at the roof? No, it was done one by one.  To-day it is snowing outside. Some one"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14411"],["title","The Children's Six Minutes (#6)"],["body","figured that in a square mile one foot of snow would weigh 65,000 tons. If you should take sleds and horses, and put a ton of snow on each sled, and arrange the horses and sleds in a procession, the sleds carrying the snow from that square mile of territory would reach from Philadelphia to New York, and beyond New York, straight up the Hudson, almost to Albany. That is only one square mile, and there are thousands of square miles every winter covered with snow. How does this snow come? In tiny flakes, one by one.  It is the same with life. God gives us many days, but he sends them one at a time. He also sends us many duties, but they do not come en masse. He is good and sends them one by one.  MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew 6: 34_      \"Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall     take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is     the evil thereof.\"  MEMORY HYMN [419]      _\"One more day's work for Jesus.\"_     COME   There is not a girl or boy here this morning who does not feel within the desire to do good. The drawing power of good--in other words, the drawing power of God. He it is who says to you, \"Come.\"  I want to illustrate this by a few things which I have here. The first is this magnet. And here are some small nails. These tiny nails represent girls and boys of about eleven or twelve years of age. I apply the magnet to these nails and I lift up--can you see me--twenty-five or thirty nails. You see it is a great deal easier to respond to the drawing power of good, to answer the great \"Come,\" in girlhood and boyhood.  Now here are some nails that are a little larger. I can lift up only five or six of these larger nails. They represent young people of eighteen or nineteen. As one gets older he does not hear as readily, at least he does not answer, Christ's blessed \"Come.\"  Next we have some nails still larger. The magnet will lift up only one or two of these. They stand for men and women in mature life. Oh, if one has not responded to Christ's call in childhood or youth, it becomes increasingly difficult as the years pass. How seldom, how very seldom, does an aged one answer the divine call and give his heart to the Lord!  Here is a very large nail, and it is rusty. Indeed it is literally coated with rust. This represents the life that is deep in sin. For long years this life has been persisting in his evil ways. As the magnet must be very strong to penetrate the rust and grip the nail, so Christ's call must be strong and loving to reach the sinful soul. Christ can save \"from the uttermost,\" but how much better it is to say in early youth, \"I hear thy voice, my Lord. Gladly I come.\"  MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 11: 28      \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will     give you rest.\"  MEMORY HYMN [462]      _\"In heavenly rest abiding.\"_     LOVE AND LOYALTY   Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was a man who had a wife and two sons. There was a famine in the land where he lived, so he said to his wife and sons, \"We will journey down to another country where the crops have not failed. There shall we find plenty to eat, and there will we make our home.\"  So the family moved to the strange land where they prospered and were happy. In time the boys grew to young manhood and married young women of the new land where they dwelt. Then sorrow entered their homes, as sorrow comes sooner or later to every home. The father and the two sons died, and the mother and her two daughters-in-law were left alone. The mother, whose name was Naomi, said, \"I am going back to the land where I lived in former days, back to the people of my girlhood.\" The young women said, \"We shall go with you also.\" \"No,\" replied Naomi, \"you must not do that. Go back to your homes, there you shall be cared for, and may the Lord deal gently with you.\"  The names of these two daughters-in-law were Ruth and Orpah. It was Ruth who then spoke up and said in words that are not surpassed in all the English language:      \"Intreat me not to leave thee, Or to return from following after     thee; For whither thou goest I will go; And where thou lodgest I     will lodge; Thy people shall be my people, And thy God my God;     Where thou diest will I die, And there will I be buried; The Lord     do so to me, and even more, If ought but death part thee and me.\"  Great words are these, words of love and loyalty.  MEMORY VERSE, _Exodus_ 20: 12      \"Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon     the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\"  MEMORY HYMN [668]      _\"O perfect love, all human thought transcending.\"_     KUMMOGOKDONATTOOTTAMMOCTITEAONGANNUNNONASH   What do you think of this word? It contains forty-two letters.  What does it mean? What language is it? It means \"catechism.\" It is the Indian language.  Now for the story. Many years ago, soon after the landing of the first Pilgrim Fathers in New England, there was a man by the name of John Eliot, who came to this new and unsettled country of America. He was a devoted Christian, an earnest, patient, persistent missionary. He lived for sixty years in Massachusetts, and most of those years were spent among the redskins who inhabited that section. He loved them, worked with them, learned their language, reduced it to writing, then translated for them the Scriptures. He was called, and he is still known by the name, \"Apostle to the Indians.\" The word at the head of the page shows what labors he entered into. All this was made possible through putting into practice his own motto, \"Prayer and pains, through faith in Christ, will do anything.\"  What good John Eliot did for the Indians some one must have done for the human race. Who invented the first alphabet? Who conceived the idea of letters? Who planned out the putting of certain letters together to form a word, then placing certain words in a string to form a sentence, that sentence conveying an idea? Who did all this? We do not know. The blessed work has gone on, until the knowledge of letters is so taken for granted that we have a saying, \"as plain as ABC.\"  The Bible has almost kept pace with language. There are few languages to-day into which the Word has not been translated. We shall not rest until every child of every tongue is able to read God's message of love and salvation in the language in which he was born.  MEMORY VERSE, _Luke_ 4: 16  \"And Jesus came to Nazareth ... and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.\"  MEMORY HYMN [200]      _\"O word of God incarnate.\"_     WHAT THE TREES SAID TO ME   Across the street from my home is a large and beautiful park. It has inviting, winding paths, great quantities of flowers and many varieties of trees. Early one summer day, before most people were up, I strolled through the park. I thought I was all alone, but suddenly I heard a voice, \"Stand erect. Do not walk with stooping shoulders. Head up, shoulders back!\" Now I confess I was walking, and thinking as I walked, with shoulders bent and head forward. At once I straightened up and looked about to see who was speaking. It was the voice of a pine tree, growing hard by the path, tall and straight as a plumb line. \"Thank you,\" I said to the pine.  No sooner had I left the pine, and was again deep in thought, when I heard another voice. \"Be courteous, you can never accomplish anything by scolding, insulting or driving people. Be fair and just. Be like Christ, a Christian gentleman.\" Now who in the world is speaking to me? I looked everywhere and there was not the sign of a person in all the park. \"Here I am,\" the voice said. I looked and there, right before me, was a graceful elm tree, smiling and courteously bowing low to me. \"I shall try and heed your word,\" I said.  Going on my way I was no longer absorbed in thought, for I knew that other trees would have something to say. Sure enough, \"Be steadfast,\" I heard. What tree could that be? I should have known at once. The maple, of course.  Now the white birch beckons. How its face shines in the light of the early morning! But dark or light I can distinguish it from all its fellows. Always white of face and clean of life. So I hear it say, \"Be clean.\"  Turning my steps homeward I said to the kindly trees, \"Good-by, and thank you. I shall never forget this morning's walk.\"  MEMORY VERSE, _Isaiah_ 61: 3  \"To give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.\"  MEMORY HYMN [745]      _\"Into the woods my Master went.\"_     BANKS   Here is a bank. I have been reading lately about banks. You know that in Jesus' day they did not have banks such as we have. People took their treasures and jewels and hid them in a vessel, or dug a hole in the earth and covered their valuable possessions with dirt. But now one of the most prominent institutions of any community is the bank.  What does this bank stand for? In the first place it means Strength. It is made of very heavy, hard material. There is money in this bank. It does not belong to me, it is the property of our Beginners' Department. Each Sunday they put their birthday money in here, then at the end of the year they open it and the contents is given to our Sunday School Missionary Society. That the money may be kept safe and sound to the end of the year the bank is made very strong.  In the second place I notice that there is a single opening and that the opening is made very small. It is meant for small coins, I could not possibly get a one dollar piece into this opening. No, it is meant for dimes, nickels and pennies. That is, it stands for Thrift. Each little child brings his or her amount, small in itself, but when they are all together there is a considerable sum.  Again, I see that this bank is made in the form of a church. It is really quite a beautiful"]]]
