It may not be an easy thing to settle the right of rebellion--to determine the question, when a people have a right forcibly to resist the execution of regularly enacted Law. But we _can_ tell _something_ about it. There are some things perfectly clear on this point.  1. To justify rebellion, (or what is the same thing, forcible resistance of the laws,) a government must be so bad, as to fail manifestly of its just end, that is, to promote the happiness of the people. If it does promote that general happiness, it answers the just end of government--it is a good government, and ought not to be overthrown.  2. To justify rebellion, the injustice or failure of a government must be so great, that it cannot be endured,--so great, that it will manifestly be better on the whole, to run all the risks of a bloody conflict, of civil war, than to endure the execution of the governmental laws.  3. To justify rebellion, there must be little or no prospect that the government can be peaceably altered, as ours may be, or that the injustice or oppression of the government can be made to cease by any peaceable means. Violence against government, rebellion, civil war, are no small matters. They bring horrid evils along with them. The injury of government must be very great to justify the introduction of such evils; and if the injury can be made to cease, by any peaceable means and within any reasonable time, it would be better to bear the injury for a while, than to involve the nation in confusion and blood, with uncertainty as to _the result_.--The last four years' experience of nations in Europe may read us a lesson.  A republic is different from a despotism. A nation where a Constitution forming the foundation of Law, limiting its enactments and establishing courts, is plainly written out in language that everybody can understand,--where Constitution and Law provide for their own amendment at the will of the sovereign people expressed in a regular and solemn manner,--where the will of the people thus governs, and (for example,) there is no \"taxation without representation,\"--where the elective franchise is free, and every man capable of intelligently exercising the right may give his voice for altering the Constitution or Law,--and where, therefore, there can be no necessity of violently opposing the laws, and no excuse for meanly evading them;--_such_ a nation is very differently conditioned from what it would be, if the will of one man or of a few governed. In such a nation, rebellion, or any evasion of Law, becomes a more serious moral evil. Rebellion _there_ can scarcely be called for; and it were difficult to gauge the dimensions of its unrighteousness!  4. To justify rebellion, it is necessary that there should be a fair prospect of successful resistance--of an overthrow of the government. If the resistance is not likely to be successful for good, but is only likely to cost the lives of the resisting individuals and others; then, such individuals are sacrificing themselves and others for no good purpose,--which is a thing that cannot be justified to reason or religion. A man has no right to fling away his life for a mere sentiment, and leave his wife a widow, or his gray-haired parents without a son to solace them. There must be some fair prospect of great good to come from it, before one can justly fling his life into the scale, in a violent contest with the government.  5. To justify rebellion, there must be a fair prospect of the firm _establishment of a letter government_, and the enactment of more just laws, after the present government is overturned. Nothing can justify a revolution, a conflict, a waste of treasure and blood, which are not going _to gain anything_ in the end.--Again, the last four years' experience of European nations may read us a lesson.  6. To justify rebellion, or what is the same thing, violent resistance to the execution of the laws, it is necessary that something more than a _small fraction_ of the people should rise in such a resistance. If the people in general are ready for it, and are willing to run all the hazards of a rebellious conflict with the government, conscious that they have righteousness and the God of righteousness on their side; this is a very different affair from what it would be, if only a minority of the people were ready for rebellion. Such a minority have no right, on account of their deemed injuries, to plunge the nation into a civil war, for the purpose of over-turning a government which suits the great mass of the people;--a civil war, in which there is every prospect, that the government and the majority who aim to support it will prevail; and prevailing, must crush their hostile opponents, this hasty and reckless minority.  These are some of the things which appear necessary, in order to justify violent resistance of Law. They must _all_ exist, or such resistance would be criminal,--contrary to reason, to benevolence, and to Christ.  It is not a thing to be expected at all among mankind, that all laws should be right, or \"just and equal.\" Human legislation must be expected to bear the marks of an imperfection, which attaches itself to everything human. If obedience to government were obligatory, only on the condition that all the laws of that government are just; then, such obedience would mean nothing at all, and every man would be absolved from all allegiance to the government, and from all obligations to obey. Such is man, so limited his wisdom and so imperfect his holiness, that human laws must necessarily be imperfect, and must, therefore, necessarily operate hardly in some instances, upon more or less of the people. It is impossible, that the thing should be otherwise--in the very nature of the case, it is impossible. And if every individual were allowed to be the judge in his own case, whether or not the law operated so hardly upon him that he might disobey; _then_ his _obligation_ to obedience would mean just nothing at all, and Law would be nothing more to him than mere advice. It might be very good advice, but he might spurn it, if he chose. _I_ may think it hard and unjust upon myself, that, in the great \"Empire State,\" by a sort of \"bill of attainder,\" (I know not what else to call it,--I suppose I must not call it a _slave law_,) I am prohibited from holding any \"office of profit or trust,\" because I _will preach_ the gospel, and people will hear me;--but notwithstanding this law, (which you will not allow me to call by any hard name,) you think me under obligation to obey the government,--and I think so too. I shall not rebel.  The _execution_ of the Law also, must necessarily be imperfect, for the same great reason--human imperfection: judges and jurors are not infallible. But, what then? _God knew all this_ when he ordained human government, and commanded us to be subject to it. Such government, with all its unavoidable imperfection and errors, on the whole is beneficial--indispensable--we could not do without it.--And rarely, very rarely indeed, is there a single instance of an individual man, here or beyond the Potomac, whom Law has injured _more_ than it has benefited. Even if that Law unjustly takes away his liberty or his life, it may have done him more good than injury; his liberty or his life might have been sooner and more cruelly destroyed without it. It would be hard to prove the contrary, in any one case that ever existed or ever will, here or elsewhere.  The best and wisest Laws ever enacted by man, or that ever will be enacted by man, may sometimes operate hardly, even destructively, upon some particular persons. An innocent man may be accused of murder, tried, convicted, and sentenced to ignominious execution. But, _what then_? May this man, who _knows_ his innocence, justly arm himself with deadly weapons, and kill the officer who would execute the sentence of the Law upon him,--and thus get out of his hands? May this innocent man's neighbors, who know his innocence as well as he, \"_lawfully interpose their own persons_\" betwixt him and the officer of Law, and thus rescue him?--and may they do this, because they have decided for themselves, that this is not a case \"_where the administration of justice is concerned_?\" If so, then all Law and Government must soon come to an end, and anarchy, mobs and confusion reign! If so, then each man becomes really his own Lawmaker, and when _he thinks_ the Law unjust towards him, may resist it unto blood! If one man is at liberty to \"_be fully prepared for_ his own defense,\" and calling the legal officer an \"assailant,\" or an \"assassin,\" may resist the execution of one law which he deems hard upon him, then another man may do the same thing in reference to another law; and the consequence inevitably must be, that all Government, Law and security are at end! If my neighbor may arm _himself_, and kill a legal officer who attempts the discharge of his sworn duty; then I may arm _myself_ also, when I deem the Law unjust to me, and kill another legal officer, who attempts to execute the Law! And if all this may be, LAW is nothing but a bugbear or a bubble--is a dead letter--and the texts of God's word which we have just read to you may be disobeyed, and ought to be blotted from the Bible!  My brethren, this is a very solemn subject! No theme of earth could be more so. All our earthly benefits, and no small part of our spiritual privileges and hopes are wrapped up in it. Religion _cannot_ prosper, if Law is not potential--if the minds of the people are to be perpetually agitated, distracted and tormented, by confusion, fear and uncertainty!         *       *       *       *       *  I have stated these great principles, and made these general remarks upon the subject presented in our texts, on account of some recent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13988"],["title","Fugitive Slave Law (#3)"],["body","which have been put forth as _religious_--put forth in _religious_ publications, by _ministers_ of the gospel. I have no reference to mere politics--to political papers or political parties, whig or democrat. I have never entered into such matters: other things occupy me. I have never given but one vote in any legal election, during the eighteen years I have resided in the State since I returned to it; and I never expect to give another. And if principles opposite to those I have laid down in this sermon were promulgated among us, only by politicians and political parties and papers, I should not advert to them here. I have always supposed, that some extravagant and evil principles would be occasionally promulgated for party purposes and political effect, and that the people very well understand this, and therefore will not be led very far astray by them. And whenever such evil principles have been put forth in the name of religion, by men whose fanatical phrensy contemned the Sabbath and other institutions of God, (like some of our Northern fanatics, \"men of one idea\" and not capable of two,) I have very seldom adverted to them at all, but have supposed it best to leave them to be counteracted by their own extravagance and by the character of their advocates, and let them die by their own contemptibility. But now, principles, contrary to the plain meaning of the texts before us, come to our ears from some more respectable quarters, and in the name of religion. I should be a traitor to the high trust of this pulpit, if I did not caution you against them. Forbearance and delicacy must sometimes have limits. We owe duties to truth and Christianity, which tenderness must not make us violate.  The \"New York Evangelical Congregational Association\" recently passed the following Resolution in respect to the \"Fugitive-Slave Law,\"--a Law regularly enacted by the Congress of the United States:--  \"Resolved, That we cannot recognize this Law, as of any binding force upon the citizens of our country.\"--(I am thankful that these modest men did not go on, like him of the triple crown, to absolve \"the citizens of our country\" from all allegiance to the government, and give our rulers over into the hands of a majesty fit to take care of them.)  A _religious_ paper, edited by Congregational clergymen, holding respectable stations, Pastors of churches,--a paper professedly devoted to the cause of Christ,--holds the following language in an _Editorial_ article, under the caption, \"How to oppose the Fugitive-Slave Law\":--  This _religious_ paper says,--\"To the fugitives themselves ... this Law is no Law ... and to resist it even unto death, is their right, and it may be their duty.... To each _individual_ fugitive, to every man or woman, who having escaped from bondage and tasted liberty, is in hourly peril of being seized and dragged back to slavery, we say,--Be fully prepared for your own defense. If to you death seems better than slavery, then refuse not to die--whether on the way-side, at your own threshold, or even as a felon upon the gallows. Defend your liberty and the liberty of your wife and children, as you would defend your life and theirs against the assassin. If you die thus, you die nobly, and your blood shall be the redemption of your race. Should you destroy the life of your assailant, you will pass into the custody of the criminal Law ... under an indictment for murder; but the verdict of the community, and the verdict of almost any jury will be, justifiable homicide in self-defense.... Or should a different verdict be found, and you be condemned to die as a murderer, your ignominious death shall be luminous with the halo of a martyr, and your sacrifice shall be for the deliverance of your people.\"  Such are the _religious_ principles, and such is the _religious_ advice of these _religious_ ministers!  I am sorry to see this. _I never read more wicked and abominable principles!_ They deserve not only the reprehension of every Christian, but the entire indignation of _all civilized mankind_! They advise private arming with bloody weapons--they advise violent resistance and murder--the murder of officers of civil Law engaged in the discharge of the duty which they have sworn to perform! I have no words to express my abhorrence of these wicked and outrageous sentiments, so directly contrary to the whole nature of all civilized society, to the precepts of the Bible, and the whole spirit of Christianity! I speak not of the _men_. Good men may err. But these principles, which these ministers have published as religious ones, are horribly and outrageously wicked!  There are other things in this religious paper, which we think are calculated to do immense mischief. This editorial article \"would utter its remonstrance against all violent resistance to the execution of the Law.\" Indeed! Very quiet and peaceful, after having talked about being \"fully prepared for defense\"--about death \"on the wayside, at the threshold and on the gallows\"--about \"murder,\" and about \"martyrdom.\" Away with such morality! aiming at one thing and professing another!--\"If one sees a fellow man struggling with his captors,... he may lawfully interpose his own person between the parties and separate them.\" Away with such morality! encouraging people to \"act a lie,\" by opposing Law while professing to obey it! And this species of morality is virtually commended to the jury-box; and its inmates are furnished in advance with a verdict here prepared for their use--\"justifiable homicide in self-defense\"! Away with such morality! encouraging a juror to violate his oath, by disregarding the Law, which he has just sworn to his country and to his God, shall govern his verdict! and encouraging a fugitive to expect him to do so!--We may yet see whether the jurymen of our country will regard their oath, or will follow the religious counsel of this religious paper.  I am not justifying slavery. I am pleading obedience to the texts before me. Slavery may be wrong. Be it so; there is still a _righteous_ method to get rid of it. But if slavery _is_ wrong, that does not make violence and murder _right_.  I am not justifying the fugitive-slave Law. It may be wrong: it may be unwise and unconstitutional. I think that any wise and modest man would hesitate much to pronounce it unconstitutional, after its enactment by a body of men who _aimed_ to abide by the constitution, and who studied the matter most intensely, with every opportunity for information and with minds trained for years in the depths of legal science. But, be it wrong--be it unwise and unconstitutional; there are civil courts to decide upon its constitutionality, and no man has _any right_ to decide for _himself_ that it is unconstitutional, and act upon that decision: if he had such a right, then every man would be his own Lawmaker, and public Constitution and Law would be nothing but a bugbear or a bubble! Be it wrong; there is a peaceful, prescribed way of amending both Law and Constitution,--and a wrong in the Law does not make false-swearing by the juryman and murder by the fugitive _right_!  It is a most marvellous thing, what a number of clergymen north of Mason and Dixon's line, have, all of a sudden, become such great _Constitutional lawyers_! Never before was anything like it! It is a modern miracle! A decision upon a great constitutional question is nothing to them! How amazingly these profound legalists, these clergyman jurists, would adorn the high courts of the country if they would only consent to take their seat upon the bench! The Judges of the United States Supreme Court ought to be thankful, that these clergymen Judges have done their duty for them in advance, deciding the law to be unconstitutional and no more is to be done! Benevolent men, these clergymen! Some have done the duty of the jurors for them and others the duty of the judges--the verdict and the decision are both recorded! yea indeed, in advance, and without pay!  But seriously, it were far better, that these clergymen should attend to their own appropriate duties to which their Master has bidden them, than to be engaged in fostering excitements among their people, which _never can_ result in any good, civil or religious. If we shall have the rebellion, disunion, and civil war, to which these evil principles and these excitements tend, the guilt of such clergymen will not be small! I would not have their accountability for all the gold of Ophir!  But it is not all the clergymen of this part of the country, nor the most of them, nor the half of them, who have turned Constitutional lawyers, or turned law opposers. I hesitate not to say, it is only a small minority, and those in general who are not entitled to the most respect for erudition, sense, or excellence of character. The (New School) Synod of New York and New Jersey, as respectable a body of ministers and elders as is to be found in the Presbyterian Church, at their late meeting in this city, had good sense enough, and good religion enough, to \"leave the constitutionality of the recent enactment\" (the Fugitive Slave Law) \"to be adjudicated by the civil tribunals of the country.\" They deserve the thanks of the country and of all mankind. The solid sense and real religion of the land will respect their decision.  I have nothing to do with politics or party. I am only insisting upon religious obedience to Law. I am preaching the texts before me. Such obedience is a religious duty. It is the will of God. I appeal to the texts. They proclaim the Law of God. Peaceful subjection to government _is_ his law; and men are guilty of sophistry and falsehood, when, to excuse wicked evasion of Law or violent resistance, they pretend to appeal to what they call \"the higher laws of God.\" _There are no such higher laws._ The texts before me are his law. If one man has a moral right, either cunningly to evade or openly to violate Law, under such pleading, then another man has the"]]]
