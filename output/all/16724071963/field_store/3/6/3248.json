Oleron had returned wrathfully to his own house, and thenceforward, looking out of his windows, had seen Barrett's face at odd times, lifting blinds or peering round curtains, as if he sought to put himself in possession of Heaven knew what evidence, in case it should be required of him.  The unfortunate occurrence made certain minor differences in Oleron's domestic arrangements. Barrett's tongue, he gathered, had already been busy; he was looked at askance by the dwellers of the square; and he judged it better, until he should be able to obtain other help, to make his purchases of provisions a little farther afield rather than at the small shops of the immediate neighbourhood. For the rest, housekeeping was no new thing to him, and he would resume his old bachelor habits....  Besides, he was deep in certain rather abstruse investigations, in which it was better that he should not be disturbed.  He was looking out of his window one midday rather tired, not very well, and glad that it was not very likely he would have to stir out of doors, when he saw Elsie Bengough crossing the square towards his house. The weather had broken; it was a raw and gusty day; and she had to force her way against the wind that set her ample skirts bellying about her opulent figure and her veil spinning and streaming behind her.  Oleron acted swiftly and instinctively. Seizing his hat, he sprang to the door and descended the stairs at a run. A sort of panic had seized him. She must be prevented from setting foot in the place. As he ran along the alley he was conscious that his eyes went up to the eaves as if something drew them. He did not know that a slate might not accidentally fall....  He met her at the gate, and spoke with curious volubleness.  \"This is really too bad, Elsie! Just as I'm urgently called away! I'm afraid it can't be helped though, and that you'll have to think me an inhospitable beast.\" He poured it out just as it came into his head.  She asked if he was going to town.  \"Yes, yes--to town,\" he replied. \"I've got to call on--on Chambers. You know Chambers, don't you? No, I remember you don't; a big man you once saw me with.... I ought to have gone yesterday, and--\" this he felt to be a brilliant effort--\"and he's going out of town this afternoon. To Brighton. I had a letter from him this morning.\"  He took her arm and led her up the square. She had to remind him that his way to town lay in the other direction.  \"Of course--how stupid of me!\" he said, with a little loud laugh. \"I'm so used to going the other way with you--of course; it's the other way to the bus. Will you come along with me? I am so awfully sorry it's happened like this....\"  They took the street to the bus terminus.  This time Elsie bore no signs of having gone through interior struggles. If she detected anything unusual in his manner she made no comment, and he, seeing her calm, began to talk less recklessly through silences. By the time they reached the bus terminus, nobody, seeing the pallid-faced man without an overcoat and the large ample-skirted girl at his side, would have supposed that one of them was ready to sink on his knees for thankfulness that he had, as he believed, saved the other from a wildly unthinkable danger.  They mounted to the top of the bus, Oleron protesting that he should not miss his overcoat, and that he found the day, if anything, rather oppressively hot. They sat down on a front seat.  Now that this meeting was forced upon him, he had something else to say that would make demands upon his tact. It had been on his mind for some time, and was, indeed, peculiarly difficult to put. He revolved it for some minutes, and then, remembering the success of his story of a sudden call to town, cut the knot of his difficulty with another lie.  \"I'm thinking of going away for a little while, Elsie,\" he said.  She merely said, \"Oh?\"  \"Somewhere for a change. I need a change. I think I shall go to-morrow, or the day after. Yes, to-morrow, I think.\"  \"Yes,\" she replied.  \"I don't quite know how long I shall be,\" he continued. \"I shall have to let you know when I am back.\"  \"Yes, let me know,\" she replied in an even tone.  The tone was, for her, suspiciously even. He was a little uneasy.  \"You don't ask me where I'm going,\" he said, with a little cumbrous effort to rally her.  She was looking straight before her, past the bus-driver.  \"I know,\" she said.  He was startled. \"How, you know?\"  \"You're not going anywhere,\" she replied.  He found not a word to say. It was a minute or so before she continued, in the same controlled voice she had employed from the start.  \"You're not going anywhere. You weren't going out this morning. You only came out because I appeared; don't behave as if we were strangers, Paul.\"  A flush of pink had mounted to his cheeks. He noticed that the wind had given her the pink of early rhubarb. Still he found nothing to say.  \"Of course, you ought to go away,\" she continued. \"I don't know whether you look at yourself often in the glass, but you're rather noticeable. Several people have turned to look at you this morning. So, of course, you ought to go away. But you won't, and I know why.\"  He shivered, coughed a little, and then broke silence.  \"Then if you know, there's no use in continuing this discussion,\" he said curtly.  \"Not for me, perhaps, but there is for you,\" she replied. \"Shall I tell you what I know?\"  \"No,\" he said in a voice slightly raised.  \"No?\" she asked, her round eyes earnestly on him.  \"No.\"  Again he was getting out of patience with her; again he was conscious of the strain. Her devotion and fidelity and love plagued him; she was only humiliating both herself and him. It would have been bad enough had he ever, by word or deed, given her cause for thus fastening herself on him ... but there; that was the worst of that kind of life for a woman. Women such as she, business women, in and out of offices all the time, always, whether they realised it or not, made comradeship a cover for something else. They accepted the unconventional status, came and went freely, as men did, were honestly taken by men at their own valuation--and then it turned out to be the other thing after all, and they went and fell in love. No wonder there was gossip in shops and squares and public houses! In a sense the gossipers were in the right of it. Independent, yet not efficient; with some of womanhood's graces forgone, and yet with all the woman's hunger and need; half sophisticated, yet not wise; Oleron was tired of it all....  And it was time he told her so.  \"I suppose,\" he said tremblingly, looking down between his knees, \"I suppose the real trouble is in the life women who earn their own living are obliged to lead.\"  He could not tell in what sense she took the lame generality; she merely replied, \"I suppose so.\"  \"It can't be helped,\" he continued, \"but you do sacrifice a good deal.\"  She agreed: a good deal; and then she added after a moment, \"What, for instance?\"  \"You may or may not be gradually attaining a new status, but you're in a false position to-day.\"  It was very likely, she said; she hadn't thought of it much in that light--  \"And,\" he continued desperately, \"you're bound to suffer. Your most innocent acts are misunderstood; motives you never dreamed of are attributed to you; and in the end it comes to--\" he hesitated a moment and then took the plunge, \"--to the sidelong look and the leer.\"  She took his meaning with perfect ease. She merely shivered a little as she pronounced the name.  \"Barrett?\"  His silence told her the rest.  Anything further that was to be said must come from her. It came as the bus stopped at a stage and fresh passengers mounted the stairs.  \"You'd better get down here and go back, Paul,\" she said. \"I understand perfectly--perfectly. It isn't Barrett. You'd be able to deal with Barrett. It's merely convenient for you to say it's Barrett. I know what it is ... but you said I wasn't to tell you that. Very well. But before you go let me tell you why I came up this morning.\"  In a dull tone he asked her why. Again she looked straight before her as she replied:  \"I came to force your hand. Things couldn't go on as they have been going, you know; and now that's all over.\"  \"All over,\" he repeated stupidly.  \"All over. I want you now to consider yourself, as far as I'm concerned, perfectly free. I make only one reservation.\"  He hardly had the spirit to ask her what that was.  \"If _I_ merely need _you_,\" she said, \"please don't give that a thought; that's nothing; I shan't come near for that. But,\" she dropped her voice, \"if _you're_ in need of _me_, Paul--I shall know if you are, _and you will be_--then I shall come at no matter what cost. You understand that?\"  He could only groan.  \"So that's understood,\" she concluded. \"And I think that's all. Now go back. I should advise you to walk back, for you're shivering--good-bye--\"  She gave him a cold hand, and he descended. He turned on the edge of the kerb as the bus started again. For the first time in all the years he had known her she parted from him with no smile and no wave of her long arm.   IX  He stood on the kerb plunged in misery, looking after her as long as she remained in sight; but almost instantly with her disappearance he felt the heaviness lift a little from his spirit. She had given him his liberty; true, there was a sense in which he had never parted with it, but now was no time for splitting hairs; he was free to act, and all was clear ahead. Swiftly the sense of lightness grew on him: it became a positive rejoicing in his liberty; and before he was halfway home he had decided what must be done next.

Here is a story about the oldest of the three little Parlin girls, \"sister Susy;\" though so many things are always happening to Prudy that it is not possible to keep her out of the book.  I hope my dear little friends will see how kind it was in God to send the \"slow winter\" and the long nights of pain to little Prudy.  If trouble should come to us, let us grow gentle, and patient, and lovely.  Little friends, be sure of one thing--our dear Father in heaven sends us something hard to bear only because he loves us.     SISTER SUSY.  CHAPTER I.  KEEPING SECRETS.   We might begin this story of Susy Parlin on a New Year's day, only it is so hard to skip over Christmas. There is such a charm about Christmas! It makes you think at once of a fir tree shining with little candles and sparkling with toys, or of a droll Santa Claus with a pack full of presents, or of a waxen angel called the Christ-child.  And it is just as well to date from the twenty-fifth of December, because, as \"Christ was born on Christmas day,\" that is really the \"Happy New Year.\"  For a long while the three little Parlin girls had been thinking and dreaming of presents. Susy's wise head was like a beehive, full of little plans and little fancies, which were flying about like bees, and buzzing in everybody's ears.  But it may be as well to give you a short description of the Parlin family.  Susy's eyes were of an \"evening blue,\" the very color of the sky in a summer night; good eyes, for they were as clear as a well which has the \"truth\" lying at the bottom of it. She was almost as nimble as a squirrel, and could face a northern snow storm like an engineer. Her hair was dark brown, and as smooth and straight as pine-needles; while Prudy's fair hair rippled like a brook running over pebbles. Prudy's face was sunny, and her mouth not much larger than a button-hole.  The youngest sister was named Alice, but the family usually called her Dotty, or Dotty Dimple, for she was about as round as a period, and had a cunning little dimple in each cheek. She had bright eyes, long curls, and a very short tongue; that is, she did not talk much. She was two years and a half old before she could be prevailed upon to say anything at all. Her father declared that Dotty thought there were people enough in the world to do the talking, and she would keep still; or perhaps she was tired of hearing Prudy say so much.  However, she had a way of nodding her curly head, and shaking her plump little forefinger; so everybody knew very well what she meant. She had learned the use of signs from a little deaf and dumb boy of whom we shall hear more by and by; but all at once, when she was ready she began to talk with all her might, and soon made up for lost time.  The other members of the family were only grown people: Mr. and Mrs. Parlin, the children's excellent parents; Mrs. Read, their kind Quaker grandmother; and the Irish servant girl, Norah.  Just now Mrs. Margaret Parlin, their \"aunt Madge,\" was visiting them, and the little girls felt quite easy about Christmas, for they gave it all up to her; and when they wanted to know how to spend their small stock of money, or how much this or that pretty toy would cost, Prudy always settled it by saying, \"Let's go ask auntie: _she'll_ know, for she's been through the Rithmetic.\"  Prudy spoke these words with awe. She thought \"going through the Rithmetic\" was next thing to going round the world.  \"O Auntie, I'm so glad you came,\" said Susy, \"for I didn't see how I was ever going to finish my Christmas presents: I go to school, you know, and it takes me all the rest of the time to slide!\"  The children were busy making wonderful things \"all secret;\" or they would have been secret if Prudy hadn't told.  For one thing, she wondered very much what Susy could be doing with four pins stuck in a spool. She watched the nimble fingers as they passed the worsted thread over the pin-heads, making stitches as fast as Susy could wink.  \"It looks like a tiny snake all sticked through the hole in the spool,\" said Prudy, eager with curiosity. \"If you ain't a-goin' to speak, I don't know what I _shall_ do, Susy Parlin!\"  When poor Susy could not pretend any longer not to hear, she answered Prudy, half vexed, half laughing, \"O, dear, I s'pose you'll tease and tease till you find out. Won't you never say a word to anybody, _never_?\"  \"Never in my world,\" replied the little one, with a solemn shake of her head.  \"Well, it's a lamp-mat for auntie. It's going to be blue, and red, and all colors; and when it's done, mother'll sew it into a round, and put fringe on: won't it be splendid? But remember, you promised not to tell!\"  Now, the very next time Prudy sat in her auntie's lap she whispered in her ear,--  \"You don't know what _we're_ making for you, _all secret_, out of worsted, and _I_ shan't tell!\"  \"Mittens?\" said aunt Madge, kissing Prudy's lips, which were pressed together over her sweet little secret like a pair of sugar-tongs clinching a lump of sugar.  \"Mittens? No, indeed! Better'n that! There'll be fringe all over it; it's in a round; it's to put something on,--to put the _lamp_ on!\"  \"Not a lamp-mat, of course?\"  \"Why, yes it is! O, there, now you've been and guessed all in a minute! Susy's gone an' told! I didn't s'pose she'd tell. I wouldn't for nothin' in my world!\"  Was it strange that Susy felt vexed when she found that her nice little surprise was all spoiled?  \"Try to be patient,\" said Mrs. Parlin, gently. \"Remember how young and thoughtless your sister is. She never means any harm.\"  \"O, but, mamma,\" replied Susy, \"she _keeps_ me being patient all the whole time, and it's hard work.\"  So Susy, in her vexation, said to Prudy, rather sternly, \"You little naughty thing, to go and tell when you promised not to! You're almost as bad as Dotty. What makes you act so?\"  \"Why, Susy,\" said the child, looking up through her tears, \"have I _acted_? I didn't know I'd acted! If you loved me, you wouldn't look that way to me. You wrinkle up your face just like Nanny when she says she'll shake the naughty out of me, Miss Prudy.\"  Then what could Susy do but forgive the sweet sister, who kissed her so coaxingly, and looked as innocent as a poor little kitty that has been stealing cream without knowing it is a sin?  It was plain that it would not do to trust Prudy with secrets. Her brain could not hold them, any more than a sieve can hold water. So Mrs. Parlin took pity upon Susy, and allowed her and her cousin Florence Eastman to lock themselves into her chamber at certain hours, and work at their presents without interruption.  While the little girls sat together busily employed with book-marks and pin-cushions, the time flew very swiftly, and they were as happy as bees in a honeysuckle.  Mrs. Parlin said she believed nothing less than Christmas presents would ever make Susy willing to use a needle and thread; for she disliked sewing, and declared she wished the man who made the needles had to swallow them all.  The family were to celebrate Christmas evening; for Mr. Parlin was away, and might not reach home in season for Christmas eve.  For a wonder they were not to have a Tree, but a Santa Claus, \"just for a change.\"  \"Not a truly Santa Claus, that comes puffin' down the chimney,\" explained Prudy, who knew very well it would be only cousin Percy under a mask and white wig.     CHAPTER II.  BEFORE DAYLIGHT.   On Christmas morning, at three o'clock, there was a great bustle and pattering of little feet, and buzzing of little voices trying to speak in whispers. Susy and Prudy were awake and astir.  \"Where _do_ you s'pose the stockings are?\" buzzed Prudy, in a very loud whisper.  \"Right by the bed-post, Prudy Parlin; and if you don't take care we'll wake everybody up.--'Sh! 'Sh!\"  \"Mine's pinned on,\" said Prudy; \"and I've pricked my fingers. O deary me!\"  \"Well, of course you've waked 'em all now,\" exclaimed Susy, indignantly: \"I might have pricked my fingers to pieces, but I wouldn't have said a word.\"  Mr. and Mrs. Parlin, who were in the next room, were wide awake by this time; but they said nothing, only listened to the whispers of the children, which grew fainter, being smothered and kept down by mouthfuls of candy, lozenges, and peanuts.  The little girls longed for daybreak. The sun, however, seemed to be in no haste, and it was a long while before there was a peep of light. Susy and Prudy waited, wondering whether the sun would really forget to show his face; but all the while they waited they were eating candy; so it was neither dull nor lonely. As for closing their eyes again, they would have scorned the idea. It would be a pity indeed to fall asleep, and lose the pleasure of saying \"Merry Christmas\" to everybody. Norah, the Irish servant, had said she should be up very early to attend High Mass: they must certainly waylay her on the stairs. How astonished she would be, when she supposed they were both soundly asleep!  \"Let me do it myself,\" said Susy: \"you stay here, Prudy, for you'll be sure to make a noise.\"  \"I'll go on my tippy toes,\" pleaded Prudy, her mouth half filled with chocolate drops.  So through their mother's room they stole softly, only throwing over one chair, and hitting Dotty's crib a little in their haste. Dotty made a sleepy sound of alarm, and Prudy could not help laughing, but only \"in her sleeve,\" that is, in her \"nightie\" sleeve, which she put up to her mouth to smother the "]]]
