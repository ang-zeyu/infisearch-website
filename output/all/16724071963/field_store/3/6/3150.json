There comes a moment in a storm at sea when people say to one another, \"It is at its worst; it can blow no harder,\" and then there is a blast ten times more fierce than any before it. So it was in these British trenches.  There were no stouter hearts in the whole world than the hearts of these men; but even they were appalled as this seven-times-heated hell of the German cannonade fell upon them and overwhelmed them and destroyed them. And at this very moment they saw from their trenches that a tremendous host was moving against their lines. Five hundred of the thousand remained, and as far as they could see the German infantry was pressing on against them, column upon column, a grey world of men, ten thousand of them, as it appeared afterwards.  There was no hope at all. They shook hands, some of them. One man improvised a new version of the battlesong, \"Good-bye, good-bye to Tipperary,\" ending with \"And we shan't get there\". And they all went on firing steadily. The officers pointed out that such an opportunity for high-class, fancy shooting might never occur again; the Germans dropped line after line; the Tipperary humorist asked, \"What price Sidney Street?\" And the few machine guns did their best. But everybody knew it was of no use. The dead grey bodies lay in companies and battalions, as others came on and on and on, and they swarmed and stirred and advanced from beyond and beyond.  \"World without end. Amen,\" said one of the British soldiers with some irrelevance as he took aim and fired. And then he remembered--he says he cannot think why or wherefore--a queer vegetarian restaurant in London where he had once or twice eaten eccentric dishes of cutlets made of lentils and nuts that pretended to be steak. On all the plates in this restaurant there was printed a figure of St. George in blue, with the motto, _Adsit Anglis Sanctus Geogius_--May St. George be a present help to the English. This soldier happened to know Latin and other useless things, and now, as he fired at his man in the grey advancing mass--300 yards away--he uttered the pious vegetarian motto. He went on firing to the end, and at last Bill on his right had to clout him cheerfully over the head to make him stop, pointing out as he did so that the King's ammunition cost money and was not lightly to be wasted in drilling funny patterns into dead Germans.  For as the Latin scholar uttered his invocation he felt something between a shudder and an electric shock pass through his body. The roar of the battle died down in his ears to a gentle murmur; instead of it, he says, he heard a great voice and a shout louder than a thunder-peal crying, \"Array, array, array!\"  His heart grew hot as a burning coal, it grew cold as ice within him, as it seemed to him that a tumult of voices answered to his summons. He heard, or seemed to hear, thousands shouting: \"St. George! St. George!\"  \"Ha! messire; ha! sweet Saint, grant us good deliverance!\"  \"St. George for merry England!\"  \"Harow! Harow! Monseigneur St. George, succour us.\"  \"Ha! St. George! Ha! St. George! a long bow and a strong bow.\"  \"Heaven's Knight, aid us!\"  And as the soldier heard these voices he saw before him, beyond the trench, a long line of shapes, with a shining about them. They were like men who drew the bow, and with another shout their cloud of arrows flew singing and tingling through the air towards the German hosts.  The other men in the trench were firing all the while. They had no hope; but they aimed just as if they had been shooting at Bisley. Suddenly one of them lifted up his voice in the plainest English, \"Gawd help us!\" he bellowed to the man next to him, \"but we're blooming marvels! Look at those grey... gentlemen, look at them! D'ye see them? They're not going down in dozens, nor in 'undreds; it's thousands, it is. Look! look! there's a regiment gone while I'm talking to ye.\"  \"Shut it!\" the other soldier bellowed, taking aim, \"what are ye gassing about!\"  But he gulped with astonishment even as he spoke, for, indeed, the grey men were falling by the thousands. The English could hear the guttural scream of the German officers, the crackle of their revolvers as they shot the reluctant; and still line after line crashed to the earth.  All the while the Latin-bred soldier heard the cry: \"Harow! Harow! Monseigneur, dear saint, quick to our aid! St. George help us!\"  \"High Chevalier, defend us!\"  The singing arrows fled so swift and thick that they darkened the air; the heathen horde melted from before them.  \"More machine guns!\" Bill yelled to Tom.  \"Don't hear them,\" Tom yelled back. \"But, thank God, anyway; they've got it in the neck.\"  In fact, there were ten thousand dead German soldiers left before that salient of the English army, and consequently there was no Sedan. In Germany, a country ruled by scientific principles, the Great General Staff decided that the contemptible English must have employed shells containing an unknown gas of a poisonous nature, as no wounds were discernible on the bodies of the dead German soldiers. But the man who knew what nuts tasted like when they called themselves steak knew also that St. George had brought his Agincourt Bowmen to help the English.      The Soldiers' Rest  The soldier with the ugly wound in the head opened his eyes at last, and looked about him with an air of pleasant satisfaction.  He still felt drowsy and dazed with some fierce experience through which he had passed, but so far he could not recollect much about it. But--an agreeable glow began to steal about his heart--such a glow as comes to people who have been in a tight place and have come through it better than they had expected. In its mildest form this set of emotions may be observed in passengers who have crossed the Channel on a windy day without being sick. They triumph a little internally, and are suffused with vague, kindly feelings.  The wounded soldier was somewhat of this disposition as he opened his eyes, pulled himself together, and looked about him. He felt a sense of delicious ease and repose in bones that had been racked and weary, and deep in the heart that had so lately been tormented there was an assurance of comfort--of the battle won. The thundering, roaring waves were passed; he had entered into the haven of calm waters. After fatigues and terrors that as yet he could not recollect he seemed now to be resting in the easiest of all easy chairs in a dim, low room.  In the hearth there was a glint of fire and a blue, sweet-scented puff of wood smoke; a great black oak beam roughly hewn crossed the ceiling. Through the leaded panes of the windows he saw a rich glow of sunlight, green lawns, and against the deepest and most radiant of all blue skies the wonderful far-lifted towers of a vast, Gothic cathedral--mystic, rich with imagery.  \"Good Lord!\" he murmured to himself. \"I didn't know they had such places in France. It's just like Wells. And it might be the other day when I was going past the Swan, just as it might be past that window, and asked the ostler what time it was, and he says, 'What time? Why, summer-time'; and there outside it looks like summer that would last for ever. If this was an inn they ought to call it _The Soldiers' Rest_.\"  He dozed off again, and when he opened his eyes once more a kindly looking man in some sort of black robe was standing by him.  \"It's all right now, isn't it?\" he said, speaking in good English.  \"Yes, thank you, sir, as right as can be. I hope to be back again soon.\"  \"Well well; but how did you come here? Where did you get that?\" He pointed to the wound on the soldier's forehead.  The soldier put his hand: up to his brow and looked dazed and puzzled.  \"Well, sir,\" he said at last, \"it was like this, to begin at the beginning. You know how we came over in August, and there we were in the thick of it, as you might say, in a day or two. An awful time it was, and I don't know how I got through it alive. My best friend was killed dead beside me as we lay in the trenches. By Cambrai, I think it was.  \"Then things got a little quieter for a bit, and I was quartered in a village for the best part of a week. She was a very nice lady where I was, and she treated me proper with the best of everything. Her husband he was fighting; but she had the nicest little boy I ever knew, a little fellow of five, or six it might be, and we got on splendid. The amount of their lingo that kid taught me--'We, we' and 'Bong swot' and 'Commong voo potty we' and all--and I taught him English. You should have heard that nipper say ''Arf a mo', old un!' It was a treat.  \"Then one day we got surprised. There was about a dozen of us in the village, and two or three hundred Germans came down on us early one morning. They got us; no help for 'it. Before we could shoot.  \"Well there we were. They tied our hands behind our backs, and smacked our faces and kicked us a bit, and we were lined up opposite the house where I'd been staying.  \"And then that poor little chap broke away from his mother, and he run out and saw one of the Boshes, as we call them, fetch me one over the jaw with his clenched fist. Oh dear! oh dear! he might have done it a dozen times if only that little child hadn't seen him.  \"He had a poor bit of a toy I'd bought him at the village shop; a toy gun it was. And out he came running, as I say, Crying out something in French like 'Bad man! bad man! don't hurt my Anglish or I shoot you'; and he pointed that gun at the German soldier. The German, he took his bayonet, and he drove it right through the poor little chap's throat.\"  The soldier's face worked and twitched and twisted itself into a sort of grin, and he sat grinding his teeth and staring at the man in the black robe. He was silent for a little. And then he found his voice, and the oaths rolled terrible, thundering from him, as he cursed that murderous wretch, and bade him go down and burn for ever in hell. And"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14044"],["title","The Angels of Mons: The Bowmen and Other Legends of the War (#3)"],["body"," tears were raining down his face, and they choked him at last.  \"I beg your pardon, sir, I'm sure,\" he said, \"especially you being a minister of some kind, I suppose; but I can't help it, he was such a dear little man.\"  The man in black murmured something to himself: \"_Pretiosa in conspectu Domini mors innocentium ejus_\"--Dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of His innocents. Then he put a hand very gently on the soldier's shoulder.  \"Never mind,\" said he; \"I've seen some service in my time, myself. But what about that wound?\"  \"Oh, that; that's nothing. But I'll tell you how I got it. It was just like this. The Germans had us fair, as I tell you, and they shut us up in a barn in the village; just flung us on the ground and left us to starve seemingly. They barred up the big door of the barn, and put a sentry there, and thought we were all right.  \"There were sort of slits like very narrow windows in one of the walls, and on the second day it was, I was looking out of these slits down the street, and I could see those German devils were up to mischief. They were planting their machine-guns everywhere handy where an ordinary man coming up the street would never see them, but I see them, and I see the infantry lining up behind the garden walls. Then I had a sort of a notion of what was coming; and presently, sure enough, I could hear some of our chaps singing 'Hullo, hullo, hullo!' in the distance; and I says to myself, 'Not this time.'  \"So I looked about me, and I found a hole under the wall; a kind of a drain I should think it was, and I found I could just squeeze through. And I got out and crept, round, and away I goes running down the street, yelling for all I was worth, just as our chaps were getting round the corner at the bottom. 'Bang, bang!' went the guns, behind me and in front of me, and on each side of me, and then--bash! something hit me on the head and over I went; and I don't remember anything more till I woke up here just now.\"  The soldier lay back in his chair and closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them he saw that there were other people in the room besides the minister in the black robes. One was a man in a big black cloak. He had a grim old face and a great beaky nose. He shook the soldier by the hand.  \"By God! sir,\" he said, \"you're a credit to the British Army; you're a damned fine soldier and a good man, and, by God! I'm proud to shake hands with you.\"  And then someone came out of the shadow, someone in queer clothes such as the soldier had seen worn by the heralds when he had been on duty at the opening of Parliament by the King.  \"Now, by _Corpus Domini_,\" this man said, \"of all knights ye be noblest and gentlest, and ye be of fairest report, and now ye be a brother of the noblest brotherhood that ever was since this world's beginning, since ye have yielded dear life for your friends' sake.\"  The soldier did not understand what the man was saying to him. There were others, too, in strange dresses, who came and spoke to him. Some spoke in what sounded like French. He could not make it out; but he knew that they all spoke kindly and praised him.  \"What does it all mean?\" he said to the minister. \"What are they talking about? They don't think I'd let down my pals?\"  \"Drink this,\" said the minister, and he handed the soldier a great silver cup, brimming with wine.  The soldier took a deep draught, and in that moment all his sorrows passed from him.  \"What is it?\" he asked?  \"_Vin nouveau du Royaume_,\" said the minister. \"New Wine of the Kingdom, you call it.\" And then he bent down and murmured in the soldier's ear.  \"What,\" said the wounded man, \"the place they used to tell us about in Sunday school? With such drink and such joy--\"  His voice was hushed. For as he looked at the minister the fashion of his vesture was changed. The black robe seemed to melt away from him. He was all in armour, if armour be made of starlight, of the rose of dawn, and of sunset fires; and he lifted up a great sword of flame.    Full in the midst, his Cross of Red Triumphant Michael brandished,   And trampled the Apostate's pride.      The Monstrance    Then it fell out in the sacring of the Mass that right as the   priest heaved up the Host there came a beam redder than any rose and   smote upon it, and then it was changed bodily into the shape and   fashion of a Child having his arms stretched forth, as he had been   nailed upon the Tree.--Old Romance.  So far things were going very well indeed. The night was thick and black and cloudy, and the German force had come three-quarters of their way or more without an alarm. There was no challenge from the English lines; and indeed the English were being kept busy by a high shell-fire on their front. This had been the German plan; and it was coming off admirably. Nobody thought that there was any danger on the left; and so the Prussians, writhing on their stomachs over the ploughed field, were drawing nearer and nearer to the wood. Once there they could establish themselves comfortably and securely during what remained of the night; and at dawn the English left would be hopelessly enfiladed--and there would be another of those movements which people who really understand military matters call \"readjustments of our line.\"  The noise made by the men creeping and crawling over the fields was drowned by the cannonade, from the English side as well as the German. On the English centre and right things were indeed very brisk; the big guns were thundering and shrieking and roaring, the machine-guns were keeping up the very devil's racket; the flares and illuminating shells were as good as the Crystal Palace in the old days, as the soldiers said to one another. All this had been thought of and thought out on the other side. The German force was beautifully organised. The men who crept nearer and nearer to the wood carried quite a number of machine guns in bits on their backs; others of them had small bags full of sand; yet others big bags that were empty. When the wood was reached the sand from the small bags was to be emptied into the big bags; the machine-gun parts were to be put together, the guns mounted behind the sandbag redoubt, and then, as Major Von und Zu pleasantly observed, \"the English pigs shall to gehenna-fire quickly come.\"  The major was so well pleased with the way things had gone that he permitted himself a very low and guttural chuckle; in another ten minutes success would be assured. He half turned his head round to whisper a caution about some detail of the sandbag business to the big sergeant-major, Karl Heinz, who was crawling just behind him. At that instant Karl Heinz leapt into the air with a scream that rent through the night and through all the roaring of the artillery. He cried in a terrible voice, \"The Glory of the Lord!\" and plunged and pitched forward, stone dead. They said that his face as he stood up there and cried aloud was as if it had been seen through a sheet of flame.  \"They\" were one or two out of the few who got back to the German lines. Most of the Prussians stayed in the ploughed field. Karl Heinz's scream had frozen the blood of the English soldiers, but it had also ruined the major's plans. He and his men, caught all unready, clumsy with the burdens that they carried, were shot to pieces; hardly a score of them returned. The rest of the force were attended to by an English burying party. According to custom the dead men were searched before they were buried, and some singular relies of the campaign were found upon them, but nothing so singular as Karl Heinz's diary.  He had been keeping it for some time. It began with entries about bread and sausage and the ordinary incidents of the trenches; here and there Karl wrote about an old grandfather, and a big china pipe, and pinewoods and roast goose. Then the diarist seemed to get fidgety about his health. Thus:    April 17.--Annoyed for some days by murmuring sounds in my head. I   trust I shall not become deaf, like my departed uncle Christopher.    April 20.--The noise in my head grows worse; it is a humming sound.   It distracts me; twice I have failed to hear the captain and have   been reprimanded.    April 22.--So bad is my head that I go to see the doctor. He speaks   of tinnitus, and gives me an inhaling apparatus that shall reach, he   says, the middle ear.    April 25.--The apparatus is of no use. The sound is now become like   the booming of a great church bell. It reminds me of the bell at St.   Lambart on that terrible day of last August.    April 26.--I could swear that it is the bell of St. Lambart that I   hear all the time. They rang it as the procession came out of the   church.  The man's writing, at first firm enough, begins to straggle unevenly over the page at this point. The entries show that he became convinced that he heard the bell of St. Lambart's Church ringing, though (as he knew better than most men) there had been no bell and no church at St. Lambart's since the summer of 1914. There was no village either--the whole place was a rubbish-heap.  Then the unfortunate Karl Heinz was beset with other troubles.    May 2.--I fear I am becoming ill. To-day Joseph Kleist, who is next   to me in the trench, asked me why I jerked my head to the right so   constantly. I told him to hold his tongue; but this shows that I am   noticed. I keep fancying that there is something white just beyond   the range of my sight on the right hand.    May 3.--This whiteness is now quite clear, and in front of me. All   this day it has slowly passed before me. I asked Joseph Kleist if he   saw a piece of newspaper just beyond the trench. He stared at me   solemnly--he is a stupid fool--and said, \"There is no paper.\"    May 4.--It looks like a white robe. There was a strong smell of   incense to-day in the trench. No one seemed to notice it. There is   decidedly a white robe, and I think I can see feet, passing very   slowly before me at this moment while I"]]]
