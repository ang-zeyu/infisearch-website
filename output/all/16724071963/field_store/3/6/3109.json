His sons had been sold, and remained in      slavery.       JAMES COTES, free man of color, residing in Gibson County,      Indiana, went to Jeffersonville, (Ind.,) to take the cars for      Indianapolis. On going to the depot, at 6, A.M., for the      morning train, he was knocked down, \"beat over the head with      a brick-bat, and cut with a bowie-knife, until subdued. He      was then tied, and in open daylight in full view of our      populace, borne off bleeding like a hog.\" He was undoubtedly      taken to the jail, in Louisville. On crossing the river to      Louisville he met the captain of a steamboat, who knew him to      be a free man. (About June 1, 1854.) The kidnapper was      arrested and held to bail in the sum of $1,000, to take his      trial at next Circuit Court.       _Near Cedarville, Ohio, May 25, 1854_, about noon, \"a colored      man, of middle age and respectable appearance, was walking on      the Columbus and Xenia turnpike. He was alone. A man in a      buggy overtook him, and invited him to ride, saying he was a      friend to the colored man, and promising to assist him in      obtaining his liberty.\" He took the colored man to the house      of one Chapman, \"three miles south of Selma, in Greene      county.\" There Chapman and the other, (whose name was William      McCord,) fell upon the colored man, struck him with a _colt_      upon the head, so that he bled severely, and bound his hands      behind him. \"Soon after the negro got loose and ran down the      road; McCord ran after him, crying 'Catch the d----d horse      thief,' &c., Chapman and his son following; negro picked up      a stone, the man a club and struck him on the head, so that      he did not throw the stone. He was then tied, and helped      by McCord and Chapman to walk to the buggy. McCord asked      Chapman, the son, to accompany him to Cincinnati with the      colored man, promising to give him half the reward ($200) if      he would. They then started, driving very fast.\" \"We had not      gone over two or three miles,\" said Chapman, \"before the      negro died, and after taking him two or three miles further,      put him out, and left him as now discovered,\"--viz. in a      thick wood, one mile south of Clifton. The above facts are      taken from the testimony given at the coroner's inquest      over the body. \"The jury gave in substance the following      verdict:--Deceased came to his death by blows from a colt      and club in the hands of one William McCord, assisted by      the two Chapmans.\" Chapman, the son, said that McCord made      him a proposition to join and follow kidnapping for a      business, stating that he knew where he could get four      victims immediately. McCord was taken and lodged in Xenia      jail. The Chapmans bound over to take their trial for      kidnapping.--_Wilmington (Ohio) Herald of Freedom_.       _Columbus, Indiana._ A Kentuckian endeavored to entice a      little negro boy to go with him, and both were waiting to      take the cars, when mischief was suspected, and a crowd of      people proceeded to the depot, and made the kidnapper      release his intended victim. (June, 1854.)--_Indiana Free      Democrat_.       ---- BROWN, a resident of Henderson, Kentucky, was arrested      for aiding four female slaves to escape from Union County,      Kentucky, to Canada. United States Marshal Ward and Sheriff      Gavitt, of Indiana, made the arrest. He was lodged in      Henderson jail.--_Evansville (Ind.) Journal_, June 2, 1854.       Several Kentucky planters, among them Archibald Dixon, raised      $500 in order to secure Brown's conviction and sentence to      penitentiary.       [Transcriber's note: The following note appears as a footnote      to this section without specific reference to any of the      cited cases.]       --> The case of SOLOMON NORTHUP, though not under the      Fugitive Law, is so striking an illustration of the power      which created that law, and of the constant danger which      impends over every colored citizen of the Northern States,      fast threatening to include white citizens also, that it must      not he passed over without mention. He was kidnapped in 1841,      from the State of New York, and kept in slavery twelve years.      Two men, named Merrill and Russell, were arrested and tried      as his kidnappers, and the fact fully proven. But the case      was got into the United States Courts, and the criminals went      unpunished. [end of note]       _Nine slaves_ left their masters in Boone County, Kentucky,      on Sunday, June 11, 1854, having three horses with them.      Arrived at the river, they turned the horses back, and taking      a skiff crossed at midnight to the Ohio shore. After      travelling two or three miles, they hid during Monday in a      clump of bushes. At night they started northward again. A      man, named John Gyser, met them and promised to assist them.      He took them to a stable, where they were to remain until      night. He immediately went to Covington, Kentucky, learned      that $1,000 reward was offered for their apprehension, and      gave information of their place of concealment. At evening a      strong band of Kentuckians, with United States Deputy Marshal      George Thayer, assisted by three Cincinnati officers,      surrounded the stable and took the nine prisoners, on a      warrant issued by United States Commissioner Pendery. They      were all given up to their claimants, and taken back to      Kentucky.       _A New Orleans correspondent of the New York Tribune_, in a      letter dated July 3, 1854, writes, \"During a recent trip up      the river I was on several steamers, and on every boat they      had one or more runaway slaves, who had been caught and were      being taken in _irons_ to their _masters_.\"       _On the Steamer Alvin Adams_, at Madison, Indiana, a man was      arrested as a fugitive and taken to Louisville, Kentucky.      He was claimed as the slave of John H. Page, of Bowling      Green. The _Louisville Journal_, edited by a Northern man,      stigmatised him as a \"rascal,\" for his attempt to be free.      (July, 1854.)       _Two colored men_, on their way to Chicago, were seized and      taken from the cars at Lasalle, Illinois, by three men, who      said they were not officers. The colored men were known to      be free; one was \"a respectable resident of Chicago.\" Some of      the passengers interfered; but it being night, and very dark,      and the cars starting on the colored men were left in the      hands of their kidnappers.       _Chicago, Illinois._ Three men from Missouri, with a warrant      from the Governor of that State, to take a certain fugitive      slave, seized a man whom they met in the street, bound him      with a handkerchief, and to quicken his steps beat him with      the butt of a pistol. He succeeded in shaking off his captors      and fled, a pistol-bullet being sent after him, which did not      hit him. He made good his escape. The men were arrested and      held to trial for assault with deadly weapons. By an      extraordinary conspiracy on the part of District Attorney      Hoyne, Sheriff Bradley, and others, these men were taken from      jail to be carried to Springfield, Illinois, two hundred      miles distant, to appear before Chief Justice Treat, that he      might inquire \"whether said alleged kidnappers were justly      held to bail and imprisoned.\" It was so suddenly done that      the counsel for the kidnapped man and for the State of      Illinois had not time to reach Springfield before the men      were discharged and on their way to Missouri. The Grand Jury      of the County (in which Chicago is) had found a true bill      against them, of which the Sheriff professed to be ignorant,      (which was deemed hardly possible,)--under which bill they      would probably have been convicted and sentenced to the State      Prison. Thus the omnipotent Slave Power reaches forth its      hand into our most Northern cities, end saves its minions      from the punishment which their lawless acts have justly      merited.--_Chicago Daily Tribune_, Sept. 21, 1854.  --> The three kidnappers published a statement in the _St. Louis Republican_ of September 26.       HENRY MASSEY, at Philadelphia, September, 1854, was brought      before United States Commissioner E.D. Ingraham, claimed by      Franklin Bright, of Queen Anne's County, Maryland, as his      slave. Arrested in Harrisburg.       HARVEY, arrested near Cumminsville, Ohio,--escaped,--taken      again in Goshen, about ten miles from Cincinnati, and lodged      in the jail of that city. An investigation of the case was      had before United States Commissioner Pendery, and the      slave remanded to the custody of his master.--_Cincinnati      Commercial_, September 22, 1854.       _Byberry, Pennsylvania, September 18, 1854._ A carriage load      of suspicious looking men came to this place in the      afternoon. They waited until nightfall, when they burst into      the house of a colored family, \"seized the man in presence of      his wife and another woman, threatening to shoot them if they      interfered--dragged him out, beating him over the head with a      mace. The poor fellow continued to scream for help until his      voice was stifled by his groans; they forced him into their      carriage and drove off, before any effectual assistance      could be offered.\" He was a sober and industrious man, and      much respected. His wife was left heartbroken, with one      child.--_Norristown (Pa.) Olive Branch_.       _The Frankfort (Ky.) Yeoman_, of November 18, 1854,      said:--\"Kidnapping free negroes in Ohio, and deluding our      slaves from their masters to recapture and sell"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13993"],["title","Dere Mable: Love Letters of a Rookie (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Dere O...

Youll never know how near you was to right. We got the tents up at last, though, so I got a minit to rite. I guess they choose these camps by mail order. The only place there flat is on the map. Where our tents is would make a good place for a Rocky Mountin goat if he didnt break his neck. The first day the Captin came out an says \"Pitch your tents here.\" Then he went to look for someone quick before anyone could ask him how. I wish I was a Captin. I guess he thought we was Alpine Chasers. Eh, Mable? But you probably dont know what those are.  Honest, Mable, if Id put in the work I done last week on the Panamah Canal it would have been workin long before it was. Of course there was a lot of fellos there with me but it seemed like all they did was to stand round and hand me shovels when I wore em out.  The Captin appresheates me though. The other day he watched me work awhile and then he says \"Smith.\" He calls me Smith now. We got very friendly since I been nice to him. I noticed none of the other fellos had much to say to him. I felt kind of sorry for him. Hes a human bein even if he is a Captin, Mable. So every time I saw him I used to stop him and talk to him. Democratic. Thats me all over, Mable. \"Smith\" he says \"If they was all like you round here war would be hell, no joke.\" By which he meant that we would make it hot for the Boshes.  I been feelin awful sorry for you, Mable. What with missin me and your fathers liver gone back on him again things must have been awful lonesome for you. It isnt as if you was a girl what had a lot of fellos hangin round all the time. Not that you couldnt have em, Mable, but you dont an theres no use makin no bones about it. If it hadnt been for me I guess things would have been pretty stupid though I dont begrudge you a cent. You know how I am with my money. I guess you ought to anyway. Eh, Mable? Never talk of money matters in connexun with a woman. Thats me all over.  [Illustration: \"THE ONLY PLACE THERE FLAT IS ON THE MAP\"]  [Illustration: \"YOU CAN READ EM TO YOUR GRANCHILDREN\"]  Now I got started an found a fountin pen an the Y.M.C.A. givin away paper like it does Im goin to rite you regular. They say there goin to charge three sents for a letter pretty soon. That aint goin to stop me though, Mable. There aint no power in heavin or earth, as the poets say, as can come between you and me, Mable. You mite send a few three sent stamps when you rite. That is if your fathers able to work yet. And willin, I should add.  Of course it aint nothin to me but Id keep these letters what you get from me as a record of the war. Some day you can read em to your granchildren an say \"Your Granfather Bill did all these things.\" Aint I the worst, Mable? Serious though I havnt found noone so far what has thought of doin this except the newspapers. I guess Ill get a lot of inside stuff that theyll never see. So this may be the only one of its kind. But it doesnt matter to me what you do with them, Mable.  Later Ill tell you all about everything but I guess you wont understand much cause its tecknickle. Lots of the fellos are gettin nitted things and candy and stuff right along. Dont pay no attenshun to that, though, or take it for a hint cause it aint. I just say it as a matter of rekord. Independent if nothin. Thats me all over.       Yours till the war ends           _Bill_    _Dere Mable:_  Having nothin better to do I take up my pen to rite.  We have been here now three weeks. As far as I am concerned I am all ready to go. I told the Captin that I was ready any time. He said yes, but that wed have to wait for the slow ones cause they was all goin together. I says was I to go out to drill with the rest. He said yes more for the example than anything else. Its kind of maddening to be hangin round here when I might be over there helpin the Sammies put a stop to this thing.  [Illustration: \"YOU WALK A POST BUT THERE AINT NO POST\"]  In the mean time I been doin guard duty. Seems like I been doin it every night but I know what there up against and I dont say nothin. Guard duty is something like extemperaneus speakin. You got to know everything your goin to say before you start. Its very tecknickle. For instance you walk a post but there aint no post. An you mount guard but you dont really mount nothin. An you turn out the guard but you dont really turn em out. They come out them selves. Just the other night I was walkin along thinkin of you Mable an my feet which was hurtin. It made me awful lonesome. An officer come up and he says why dont you draw your pistol when you here someone comin. An I says I dont wait till the sheep is stole I drew it this afternoon from the Supply sargent. An I showed it to him tucked inside my shirt where noone could get it away from me without some tussel, you bet, Mable. But it seems that you got to keep on drawin it all the time. Then later I here footsteps. I was expectin the relief so I was right on the job. An a man come up and I poked my pistol right in his face an says Halt. Who goes there? And he says Officer of the day. An bein disappointed as who wouldnt be I says Oh hell. I thought it was the relief. An he objected to that. The relief, Mable--but whats the use you wouldnt understand it.  Theres some mistake up north Mable about the way were built, Mable. Its kind of depresin to think that you could forget about us so quick. Everyones gettin sweters without sleeves and gloves without fingers. We still got everything we started with Mable. Why not sox without feet and pants without legs. If your makin these things for after the war I think your anticipatin a little. Besides its depresin for the fellos to be reminded all the time. Its like givin a fello a life membership to the Old Soldiers home to cheer him up when he sails. I was sayin the other day that if the fellos at Washington ever get onto this theyll be issuin soleles shoes and shirtles sleves.  Its gettin awful cold. No wonder this is a healthy place. All the germs is froze. I guess there idea of the hardenin proces is to freeze a fello stiff. The Captin said the other day we was gettin in tents of trainin. Thats all right but Id kind of like to see those steam heated barraks. Youve red about those fellos that go swimmin in the ice in winter. I guess thed like our shouer baths. They say Cleanliness is next to Godliness, Mable. I say its next to impossible.  I started this letter almost a weak ago. I just found it in my bakin can. They call it a bakin can but its too small to bake nothin. I keep my soap in it. I got some news for you. The regiment is to be dismantled. The Captin called me over this mornin and asked me where Id like to be transferred. I said home if it was the"]]]
