After the late encounter of grit, the atmosphere was relieved of storm. The children, the primitive, pagan, dangerous children, forgot all about whiskey, and lusted joyously for Christmas. Christmas was coming! No work! A shooting-match! A big feed! Cheerfulness bubbled at the Malheur Agency. The weather itself was in tune. Castle Rock seemed no longer to frown, but rose into the shining air, a mass of friendly strength. Except when a rare sledge or horseman passed, Mr. Bolles's journeys to the school were all to show it was not some pioneer colony in a new, white, silent world that heard only the playful shouts and songs of the buccaroos. The sun overhead and the hard-crushing snow underfoot filled every one with a crisp, tingling hilarity.  Before the sun first touched Castle Rock on the morning of the feast they were up and in high feather over at the bunk-house. They raced across to see what Sam was cooking; they begged and joyfully swallowed lumps of his raw plum-pudding. “Merry Christmas!” they wished him, and “Melly Clismas!” said he to them. They played leap-frog over by the stable, they put snow down each other's backs. Their shouts rang round corners; it was like boys let out of school. When Drake gathered them for the shooting-match, they cheered him; when he told them there were no prizes, what did they care for prizes? When he beat them all the first round, they cheered him again. Pity he hadn't offered prizes! He wasn't a good business man, after all!  The rounds at the target proceeded through the forenoon, Drake the acclaimed leader; and the Christmas sun drew to mid-sky. But as its splendor in the heavens increased, the happy shoutings on earth began to wane. The body was all that the buccaroos knew; well, the flesh comes pretty natural to all of us--and who had ever taught these men about the spirit? The further they were from breakfast the nearer they were to dinner; yet the happy shootings waned! The spirit is a strange thing. Often it dwells dumb in human clay, then unexpectedly speaks out of the clay's darkness.  It was no longer a crowd Drake had at the target. He became aware that quietness had been gradually coming over the buccaroos. He looked, and saw a man wandering by himself in the lane. Another leaned by the stable corner, with a vacant face. Through the windows of the bunk-house he could see two or three on their beds. The children were tired of shouting. Drake went in-doors and threw a great log on the fire. It blazed up high with sparks, and he watched it, although the sun shown bright on the window-sill. Presently he noticed that a man had come in and taken a chair. It was Half-past Full, and with his boots stretched to the warmth, he sat gazing into the fire. The door opened and another buckaroo entered and sat off in a corner. He had a bundle of old letters, smeared sheets tied trite a twisted old ribbon. While his large, top-toughened fingers softly loosened the ribbon, he sat with his back to the room and presently began to read the letters over, one by one. Most of the men came in before long, and silently joined the watchers round the treat fireplace. Drake threw another log on, and in a short time this, too, broke into ample flame. The silence was long; a slice of shadow had fallen across the window-sill, when a young man spoke, addressing the logs:  “I skinned a coon in San Saba, Texas, this day a year.”  At the sound of a voice, some of their eyes turned on the speaker, but turned back to the fire again. The spirit had spoken from the clay, aloud; and the clay was uncomfortable at hearing it.  After some more minutes a neighbor whispered to a neighbor, “Play you a game of crib.”  The man nodded, stole over to where the board was, and brought it across the floor on creaking tip-toe. They set it between them, and now and then the cards made a light sound in the room.  “I treed that coon on Honey,” said the young man, after a while--“Honey Creek, San Saba. Kind o' dry creek. Used to flow into Big Brady when it rained.”  The flames crackled on, the neighbors still played their cribbage. Still was the day bright, but the shrinking wedge of sun had gone entirely from the window-sill. Half-past Full had drawn from his pocket a mouthorgan, breathing half-tunes upon it; in the middle of “Suwanee River” the man who sat in the corner laid the letter he was beginning upon the heap on his knees and read no more. The great genial logs lay glowing, burning; from the fresher one the flames flowed and forked; along the embered surface of the others ran red and blue shivers of iridescence. With legs and arms crooked and sprawled, the buccaroos brooded, staring into the glow with seldom-winking eyes, while deep inside the clay the spirit spoke quietly. Christmas Day was passing, but the sun shone still two good hours high. Outside, over the snow and pines, it was only in the deeper folds of the hills that the blue shadows had come; the rest of the world was gold and silver; and from far across that silence into this silence by the fire came a tinkling stir of sound. Sleighbells it was, steadily coming, too early for Bolles to be back from his school festival.  The toy-thrill of the jingling grew clear and sweet, a spirit of enchantment that did not wake the stillness, but cast it into a deeper dream. The bells came near the door and stopped, and then Drake opened it.  “Hello, Uncle Pasco!” said he. “Thought you were Santa Claus.”  “Santa Claus! H'm. Yes. That's what. Told you maybe I'd come.”  “So you did. Turkey is due in--let's see--ninety minutes. Here, boys! some of you take Uncle Pasco's horse.”  “No, no, I won't. You leave me alone. I ain't stoppin' here. I ain't hungry. I just grubbed at the school. Sleepin' at Missouri Pete's to-night. Got to make the railroad tomorrow.” The old man stopped his precipitate statements. He sat in his sledge deeply muffled, blinking at Drake and the buccaroos, who had strolled out to look at him, “Done a big business this trip,” said he. “Told you I would. Now if you was only givin' your children a Christmas-tree like that I seen that feller yer schoolmarm doin' just now--hee-hee!” From his blankets he revealed the well-known case. “Them things would shine on a tree,” concluded Uncle Pasco.  “Hang 'em in the woods, then,” said Drake.  “Jewelry, is it?” inquired the young Texas man.  Uncle Pasco whipped open his case. “There you are,” said he. “All what's left. That ring'll cost you a dollar.”  “I've a dollar somewheres,” said the young man, fumbling.  Half-past Full, on the other side of the sleigh, stood visibly fascinated by the wares he was given a skilful glimpse of down among the blankets. He peered and he pondered while Uncle Pasco glibly spoke to him.  “Scatter your truck out plain!” the buccaroo exclaimed, suddenly. “I'm not buying in the dark. Come over to the bunk-house and scatter.”  “Brass will look just the same anywhere,” said Drake.  “Brass!” screamed Uncle. “Brass your eye!”  But the buccaroos, plainly glad for distraction, took the woolly old scolding man with them. Drake shouted that if getting cheated cheered them, by all means to invest heavily, and he returned alone to his fire, where Bolles soon joined him. They waited, accordingly, and by-and-by the sleigh-bells jingled again. As they had come out of the silence, so did they go into it, their little silvery tinkle dancing away in the distance, faint and fainter, then, like a breath, gone.  Uncle Pasco's trinkets had audibly raised the men's spirits. They remained in the bunkhouse, their laughter reaching Drake and Bolles more and more. Sometimes they would scuffle and laugh loudly.  “Do you imagine it's more leap-frog?” inquired the school-master.  “Gambling,” said Drake. “They'll keep at it now till one of them wins everything the rest have bought.”  “Have they been lively ever since morning?”  “Had a reaction about noon,” said Drake. “Regular home-sick spell. I felt sorry for 'em.”  “They seem full of reaction,” said Bolles. “Listen to that!”  It was now near four o'clock, and Sam came in, announcing dinner.  “All ready,” said the smiling Chinaman.  “Pass the good word to the bunk-house,” said Drake, “if they can hear you.”  Sam went across, and the shouting stopped. Then arose a thick volley of screams and cheers.  “That don't sound right,” said Drake, leaping to his feet. In the next instant the Chinaman, terrified, returned through the open door. Behind him lurched Half-past Full, and stumbled into the room. His boot caught, and he pitched, but saved himself and stood swaying, heavily looking at Drake. The hair curled dense over his bull head, his mustache was spread with his grin, the light of cloddish humor and destruction burned in his big eye. The clay had buried the spirit like a caving pit.  “Twas false jewelry all right!” he roared, at the top of his voice. “A good old jimmyjohn full, boss. Say, boss, goin' to run our jimmyjohn off the ranch? Try it on, kid. Come over and try it on!” The bull beat on the table.  Dean Drake had sat quickly down in his chair, his gray eye upon the hulking buccaroo. Small and dauntless he sat, a sparrow-hawk caught in a trap, and game to the end--whatever end.  “It's a trifle tardy to outline any policy about your demijohn,” said he, seriously. “You folks had better come in and eat before you're beyond appreciating.”  “Ho, we'll eat your grub, boss. Sam's cooking goes.” The buccaroo lurched out and away to the bunk-house, where new bellowing was set up.  “I've got to carve this turkey, friend,” said the boy to Bolles.  “I'll do my best to help eat it,” returned the school-master, smiling.  “Misser Dlake,” said poor Sam, “I solly you. I velly solly you.”   IV  “Reserve your sorrow, Sam,” said Dean Drake. “Give us your soup for a starter. Come,” he said to Bolles. “Quick.”  He went into the dining-room, prompt in his seat at the head of the table, with the school-master next to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],["title","The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#4)"],["body","him.  “Nice man, Uncle Pasco,” he continued. “But his time is not now. We have nothing to do for the present but sit like every day and act perfectly natural.”  “I have known simpler tasks,” said Mr. Bolles, “but I'll begin by spreading this excellently clean napkin.”  “You're no schoolmarm!” exclaimed Drake; “you please me.”  “The worst of a bad thing,” said the mild Bolles, “is having time to think about it, and we have been spared that.”  “Here they come,” said Drake.  They did come. But Drake's alert strategy served the end he had tried for. The drunken buccaroos swarmed disorderly to the door and halted. Once more the new superintendent's ways took them aback. Here was the decent table with lights serenely burning, with unwonted good things arranged upon it--the olives, the oranges, the preserves. Neat as parade drill were the men's places, all the cups and forks symmetrical along the white cloth. There, waiting his guests at the far end, sat the slim young boss talking with his boarder, Mr. Bolles, the parts in their smooth hair going with all the rest of this propriety. Even the daily tin dishes were banished in favor of crockery.  “Bashful of Sam's napkins, boys?” said the boss. “Or is it the bald-headed china?”  At this bidding they came in uncertainly. Their whiskey was ashamed inside. They took their seats, glancing across at each other in a transient silence, drawing their chairs gingerly beneath them. Thus ceremony fell unexpected upon the gathering, and for a while they swallowed in awkwardness what the swift, noiseless Sam brought them. He in a long white apron passed and re-passed with his things from his kitchen, doubly efficient and civil under stress of anxiety for his young master. In the pauses of his serving he watched from the background, with a face that presently caught the notice of one of them.  “Smile, you almond-eyed highbinder,” said the buccaroo. And the Chinaman smiled his best.  “I've forgot something,” said Half-past Full, rising. “Don't let 'em skip a course on me.” Half-past left the room.  “That's what I have been hoping for,” said Drake to Bolles.  Half-past returned presently and caught Drake's look of expectancy. “Oh no, boss,” said the buccaroo, instantly, from the door. “You're on to me, but I'm on to you.” He slammed the door with ostentation and dropped with a loud laugh into his seat.  “First smart thing I've known him do,” said Drake to Bolles. “I am disappointed.”  Two buccaroos next left the room together.  “They may get lost in the snow,” said the humorous Half-past. “I'll just show 'em the trail.” Once more he rose from the dinner and went out.  “Yes, he knew too much to bring it in here,” said Drake to Bolles. “He knew none but two or three would dare drink, with me looking on.”  “Don't you think he is afraid to bring it in the same room with you at all?” Bolles suggested.  “And me temperance this season? Now, Bolles, that's unkind.”  “Oh, dear, that is not at all what--”  “I know what you meant, Bolles. I was only just making a little merry over this casualty. No, he don't mind me to that extent, except when he's sober. Look at him!”  Half-past was returning with his friends. Quite evidently they had all found the trail.  “Uncle Pasco is a nice old man!” pursued Drake. “I haven't got my gun on. Have you?”  “Yes,” said Bolles, but with a sheepish swerve of the eye.  Drake guessed at once. “Not Baby Bunting? Oh, Lord! and I promised to give you an adult weapon!--the kind they're wearing now by way of full-dress.”  “Talkin' secrets, boss?” said Half-past Full.  The well-meaning Sam filled his cup, and this proceeding shifted the buccaroo's truculent attention.  “What's that mud?” he demanded.  “Coffee,” said Sam, politely.  The buccaroo swept his cup to the ground, and the next man howled dismay.  “Burn your poor legs?” said Half-past. He poured his glass over the victim. They wrestled, the company pounded the table, betting hoarsely, until Half-past went to the floor, and his plate with him.  “Go easy,” said Drake. “You're smashing the company's property.”  “Bald-headed china for sure, boss!” said a second of the brothers Drinker, and dropped a dish.  “I'll merely tell you,” said Drake, “that the company don't pay for this china twice.”  “Not twice?” said Half-past Full, smashing some more. “How about thrice?”  “Want your money now?” another inquired.  A riot of banter seized upon all of them, and they began to laugh and destroy.  “How much did this cost?” said one, prying askew his three-tined fork.  “How much did you cost yourself?” said another to Drake.  “What, our kid boss? Two bits, I guess.”  “Hyas markook. Too dear!”  They bawled at their own jokes, loud and ominous; threat sounded beneath their lightest word, the new crashes of china that they threw on the floor struck sharply through the foreboding din of their mirth. The spirit that Drake since his arrival had kept under in them day by day, but not quelled, rose visibly each few succeeding minutes, swelling upward as the tide does. Buoyed up on the whiskey, it glittered in their eyes and yelled mutinously in their voices.  “I'm waiting all orders,” said Bolles to Drake.  “I haven't any,” said Drake. “New ones, that is. We've sat down to see this meal out. Got to keep sitting.”  He leaned back, eating deliberately, saying no more to the buccaroos; thus they saw he would never leave the room till they did. As he had taken his chair the first, so was the boy bound to quit it the last. The game of prying fork-tines staled on them one by one, and they took to songs, mostly of love and parting. With the red whiskey in their eyes they shouted plaintively of sweethearts, and vows, and lips, and meeting in the wild wood. From these they went to ballads of the cattle-trail and the Yuba River, and so inevitably worked to the old coast song, made of three languages, with its verses rhymed on each year since the first beginning. Tradition laid it heavy upon each singer in his turn to keep the pot a-boiling by memory or by new invention, and the chant went forward with hypnotic cadence to a tune of larkish, ripping gayety. He who had read over his old stained letters in the homesick afternoon had waked from such dreaming and now sang:       “Once jes' onced in the year o' 49,      I met a fancy thing by the name o' Keroline;      I never could persuade her for to leave me be;      She went and she took and she married me.”  His neighbor was ready with an original contribution:       “Once, once again in the year o' '64,      By the city of Whatcom down along the shore--      I never could persuade them for to leave me be--      A Siwash squaw went and took and married me.”  “What was you doin' between all them years?” called Half-past Full.  “Shut yer mouth,” said the next singer:       “Once, once again in the year o' 71      ['Twas the suddenest deed that I ever done)--      I never could persuade them for to leave me be--      A rich banker's daughter she took and married me.”  “This is looking better,” said Bolles to Drake.  “Don't you believe it,” said the boy.  Ten or a dozen years were thus sung.  “I never could persuade them for to leave me be” tempestuously brought down the chorus and the fists, until the drunkards could sit no more, but stood up to sing, tramping the tune heavily together. Then, just as the turn came round to Drake himself, they dashed their chairs down and herded out of the room behind Half-past Full, slamming the door.  Drake sat a moment at the head of his Christmas dinner, the fallen chairs, the lumpy wreck. Blood charged his face from his hair to his collar. “Let's smoke,” said he. They went from the dinner through the room of the great fireplace to his office beyond.  “Have a mild one?” he said to the schoolmaster.  “No, a strong one to-night, if you please.” And Bolles gave his mild smile.  “You do me good now and then,” said Drake.  “Dear me,” said the teacher, “I have found it the other way.”  All the rooms fronted on the road with doors--the old-time agency doors, where the hostiles had drawn their pictures in the days before peace had come to reign over this country. Drake looked out, because the singing had stopped and they were very quiet in the bunk-house. He saw the Chinaman steal from his kitchen.  “Sam is tired of us,” he said to Bolles.  “Tired?”  “Running away, I guess. I'd prefer a new situation myself. That's where you're deficient, Bolles. Only got sense enough to stay where you happen to be. Hello. What is he up to?”  Sam had gone beside a window of the bunkhouse and was listening there, flat like a shadow. Suddenly he crouched, and was gone among the sheds. Out of the bunk-house immediately came a procession, the buccaroos still quiet, a careful, gradual body.  Drake closed his door and sat in the chair again. “They're escorting that jug over here,” said he. “A new move, and a big one.”  He and Bolles heard them enter the next room, always without much noise or talk--the loudest sound was the jug when they set it on the floor. Then they seemed to sit, talking little.  “Bolles,” said Drake, “the sun has set. If you want to take after Sam--”  But the door of the sitting-room opened and the Chinaman himself came in. He left the door a-swing and spoke clearly. “Misser Dlake,” said he, “slove bloke” (stove broke).  The superintendent came out of his office, following Sam to the kitchen. He gave no look or word to the buccaroos with their demijohn; he merely held his cigar sidewise in his teeth and walked with no hurry through the sitting-room. Sam took him through to the kitchen and round to a hind corner of the stove, pointing.  “Misser Dlake,” said he, “slove no bloke. I hear them inside. They going kill you.”  “That's about the way I was figuring it,” mused Dean Drake.  “Misser Dlake,” said the Chinaman, with appealing eyes, “I velly solly you. They no hurtee me. Me cook.”  “Sam, there is much meat in your words. Condensed beef don't class with you. But reserve"]]]
