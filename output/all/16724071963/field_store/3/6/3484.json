We feel that the life-force which yet remains and impels us onward still has its source and supply from those cataracts.  School time was ended, the first fleeting years of university life were over, and many beautiful life-dreams were over also.  But one of them still remained: Faith in God and man.  Otherwise life would have been circumscribed within one's narrow brain.  Instead of that, a nobler consecration had preserved all, and even the painful and incomprehensible events of life became a proof to me of the omnipresence of the divine in the earthly.  \"The least important thing does not happen except as God wills it.\"  This was the brief life-wisdom I had accumulated.  During the summer holidays I returned to my little native city.  What joy in these meetings again!  No one has explained it, but in this seeing and finding again, and in these self-memories, lie the real secrets of all joy and pleasure.  What we see, hear or taste for the first time may be beautiful, grand and agreeable, but it is too new. It overpowers, but gives no repose, and the fatigue of enjoying is greater than the enjoyment itself.  To hear again, years afterward, an old melody, every note of which we supposed we had forgotten, and yet to recognize it as an old acquaintance; or, after the lapse of many years, to stand once more before the Sistine Madonna at Dresden, and experience afresh all the emotions which the infinite look of the child aroused in us for years; or to smell a flower or taste a dish again which we have not thought of since childhood--all these produce such an intense charm that we do not know which we enjoy most, the actual pleasure or the old memory.  So when we return again, after long absence, to our birth-place, the soul floats unconsciously in a sea of memories, and the dancing waves dreamily toss themselves upon the shores of times long passed.  The belfry clock strikes and we fear we shall be late to school, and recovering from this fear feel relieved that our anxiety is over.  The same dog runs along the street on whose account we used to go far out of our way.  Here sits the old huckster whose apples often led us into temptation, and even now, we fancy they must taste better than all other apples in the world, notwithstanding the dust on them.  There one has torn down a house and built a new one. Here the old music-teacher lived.  He is dead--and yet how beautiful it seemed as we stood and listened on summer evenings under the window while the True Soul, when the hours of the day were over, indulged in his own enjoyment and played fantasies, like the roaring and hissing engine letting off the steam which has accumulated during the day. Here in this little leafy lane, which seemed at that time so much larger, as I was coming home late one evening, I met our neighbor's beautiful daughter.  At that time I had never ventured to look at or address her, but we school-children often spoke of her and called her \"the Beautiful Maiden,\" and whenever I saw her passing along the street at a distance I was so happy that I could only think of the time when I should meet her nearer.  Here in this leafy walk which leads to the church-yard, I met her one evening and she took me by the arm, although we had never spoken together before, and asked me to go home with her. I believe neither of us spoke a word the whole way; but I was so happy that even now, after all these years, I wish it were that evening, and that I could go home again, silently and blissfully, with \"the Beautiful Maiden.\"  Thus one memory follows another until the waves dash together over our heads, and a deep sigh swells the breast, which warns us that we have forgotten to breathe in the midst of these pure thoughts.  Then all at once, the whole dream-world vanishes, like uprisen ghosts at the crowing of the cock.  As I passed by the old castle and the lindens, and saw the sentinels upon their horses, how many memories awakened in my soul, and how everything had changed!  Many years had flown since I was at the castle.  The Princess was dead.  The Prince had given up his rule and gone back to Italy, and the oldest prince, with whom I had grown up, was regent.  His companions were young noblemen and officers, whose intercourse was congenial to him, and whose company in our early days had often estranged us.  Other circumstances combined to weaken our young friendship.  Like every young man who perceives for the first time the lack of unity in the German folk-life, and the defects of German rule, I had caught up some phrases of the Liberal party, which sounded as strangely at court as unseemly expressions in an honest minister's family.  In short, it was many years since I had ascended those stairs, and yet a being dwelt in that castle whose name I had named almost daily, and who was almost constantly present in my memory. I had long dwelt upon the thought that I should never see her again in this life.  She was transformed into an image which I felt neither did nor could exist in reality.  She had become my good angel--my other self, to whom I talked instead of talking with myself.  How she became so I could not explain to myself, for I scarcely knew her.  Just as the eye sometimes pictures figures in the clouds, so I fancied my imagination had conjured up this sweet image in the heaven of my childhood, and a complete picture of phantasy developed itself out of the scarcely perceptible outlines of reality.  My entire thought had involuntarily become a dialogue with her, and all that was good in me, all for which I struggled, all in which I believed, my entire better self, belonged to her.  I gave it to her.  I received it from her, from her my good angel.  I had been at home but a few days, when I received a letter one morning.  It was written in English, and came from the Countess Marie:   _Dear Friend_: I hear you are with us for a short time.  We have not met for many years, and if it is agreeable to you, I should like to see an old friend again.  You will find me alone this afternoon in the Swiss Cottage.           Yours sincerely, MARIE.   I immediately replied, also in English, that I would call in the afternoon.  The Swiss Cottage constituted a wing of the castle, which overlooked the garden, and could be reached without going through the castle yard. It was five o'clock when I passed through the garden and approached the cottage.  I repressed all emotion and prepared myself for a formal meeting.  I sought to quiet my good angel, and to assure her that this lady had nothing to do with her.  And yet I felt very uneasy, and my good angel would not listen to counsel.  Finally I took courage, murmuring something to myself about the masquerade of life, and rapped on the door, which stood ajar.  There was no one in the room except a lad whom I did not know, and who likewise spoke English, and said the Countess would be present in a moment.  She then left, and I was alone, and had time to look about.  The walls of the room were of rose-chestnut, and over an openwork trellis, a luxuriant broadleaved ivy twined around the whole room.  All the tables and chairs were of carved rose-chestnut.  The floor was of variegated woodwork.  It gave me a curious sensation to see so much that was familiar in the room.  Many articles from our old play-room in the castle were old friends, but the others were new, especially the pictures, and yet they were the same as those in my University room--the same portraits of Beethoven, Handel and Mendelssohn, as I had selected--hung over the grand piano.  In one corner I saw the Venus di Milo, which I always regarded as the masterpiece of antiquity.  On the table were volumes of Dante, Shakspeare, Tauler's Sermons, the \"German Theology,\" Ruckert's Poems, Tennyson and Burns, and Carlyle's \"Past and Present,\"--the very same books--all of which I had had but recently in my hands.  I was growing thoughtful, but I repressed my thoughts and was just standing before the portrait of the deceased Princess, when the door opened, and the same two servants, whom I had so often seen in childhood, brought the Countess into the room upon her couch.  What a vision!  She spoke not a word, and her countenance was as placid as the sea, until the servants left the room.  Then her eyes sought me--the old, deep, unfathomable eyes.  Her expression grew more animated each instant.  At last her whole face lit up, and she said:  \"We are old friends--I believe; we have not changed.  I cannot say 'You,' and if I may not say 'Thou,' then we must speak in English.  Do you understand me?\"  I had not anticipated such a reception, for I saw here was no masquerade--here was a soul which longed for another soul--here was a greeting like that between two friends who recognize each other by the glance of the eye, notwithstanding their disguises and dark masks.  I seized the hand she held out to me, and replied: \"When we address an angel, we cannot say 'You.'\"  And yet how singular, is the influence of the forms and habits of life! How difficult it is to speak the language of nature even to the most congenial souls!  Our conversation halted, and both of us felt the embarrassment of the moment.  I broke the silence and spoke out my thoughts: \"Men become accustomed to live from youth up as it were in a cage, and when they are once in the open air they dare not venture to use their wings, fearing, if they fly, that they may stumble against everything.\"  \"Yes,\" replied she, \"and that is very proper and cannot well be otherwise.  One often wishes that he could live like the birds which fly in the woods, and meet upon the branches and sing together without being presented to each other.  But, my friend, even among the birds there are owls and sparrows, and in life it is well that one can pass them without"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],["title","Memories: A Story of German Love (#4)"],["body","them.  It is sometimes with life as with poetry. As the real poet can express the Truest and most Beautiful, although fettered by metrical form, so man should know how to preserve freedom of thought and feeling notwithstanding the restraints of society.\"  I could not help recalling the words of Platen: \"That which proves itself everlasting under all circumstances, told in the fetters of words, is the unfettered spirit.\"  \"Yes,\" said she, with a cordial but sweetly playful smile; \"but I have a privilege which is at the same time my burden and loneliness.  I often pity the young men and maidens, for they cannot have a friendship or an intimacy without their relatives or themselves pronouncing it love, or what they call love.  They lose much on this account.  The maiden knows not what slumbers in her soul, and what might be awakened by earnest conversation with a noble friend; and the young man in turn would acquire so much knightly virtue if women were suffered to be the distant witnesses of the inner struggles of the spirit.  It will not do, however, for immediately love comes in play, or what they call love--the quick beating of the heart--the stormy billows of hope--the delight over a beautiful face--the sweet sentimentality--sometimes also prudent calculation--in short, all that troubles the calm sea, which is the true picture of pure human love------\"  She checked herself suddenly, and an expression of pain passed over her countenance.  \"I dare not talk more to-day,\" said she; \"my physician will not allow it.  I would like to hear one of Mendelssohn's songs--that duet, which my young friend used to play years ago.  Is it not so?\"  I could not answer, for as she ceased speaking and gently folded her hands, I saw upon her hand a ring.  She wore it on her little finger--the ring which she had given me and I had given her.  Thoughts came too fast for utterance, and I seated myself at the piano and played.  When I had done, I turned around and said: \"Would one could only speak thus in tones without words!\"  \"That is possible,\" said she; \"I understood it all.  But I must not do anything more to-day, for every day I grow weaker.  We must be better acquainted, and a poor sick recluse may certainly claim forbearance. We meet to-morrow evening, at the same hour; shall we not?\"  I seized her hand and was about to kiss it, but she held my hand firmly, pressed it and said: \"It is better thus.  Good bye.\"     FIFTH MEMORY.  It would be difficult to describe my thoughts and emotions as I went home.  The soul cannot at once translate itself perfectly in words, and there are \"thoughts without words,\" which in every man are the prelude of supreme joy and suffering.  It was neither joy nor pain, only an indescribable bewilderment which I felt; thoughts flew through my innermost being like meteors, which shoot from heaven towards earth but are extinguished before they reach the goal.  As we sometimes say in a dream, \"I am dreaming,\" so I said to myself \"thou livest\"--\"it is she.\" I tried again to reflect and calm myself, and said, \"She is a lovely vision--a very wonderful spirit.\"  At another time, I pictured the delightful evenings I should pass during the holidays.  But no, no, this cannot be.  She is everything I sought, thought, hoped and believed.  Here was at last a human soul, as clear and fresh as a spring morning.  I had seen at the first glance what she was and how she felt, and we had greeted and recognized one another.  And my good angel in me, she answered me no more.  She was gone and I felt there was no place on earth where I should find her again.  Now began a beautiful life, for I was with her every evening.  We soon realized that we were in truth old acquaintances and that we could only call each other Thou.  It seemed also as if we had lived near and with one another always, for she manifested not an emotion that did not find its counterpart in my soul, and there was no, thought which I uttered to which she did not nod friendly assent, as much as to say: \"I thought so too.\"  I had previously heard the greatest master of our time and his sister extemporize on the piano, and scarcely comprehended how two persons could understand and feel themselves so perfectly and yet never, not even in a single note, disturb the harmony of their playing. Now it became intelligible to me.  Yes, now I understood for the first time that my soul was not so poor and empty as it had seemed to me, and that it had been only the sun that was lacking to open all its germs, and buds to the light.  And yet what a sad and brief spring-time it was that our souls experienced!  We forget in May that roses so soon wither, but here every evening reminded us that one leaf after another was falling to the ground.  She felt it before I did, and alluded to it apparently without pain, and our interviews grew more earnest and solemn daily.  One evening, as I was about to leave, she said: \"I did not think I should grow so old.  When I gave you the ring on my confirmation day I thought I should have to take my departure from you all, very soon. And yet I have lived so many years, and enjoyed so much beauty--and suffered so very much!  But one forgets that!  Now, while I feel that my departure is near, every hour, every minute, grows precious to me. Good night!  Do not come too late to-morrow.\"  One day as I went into her room, I met an Italian painter with her. She spoke Italian with him, and although he was evidently more artisan than artist, she addressed him with such amiability and modesty, with such respect even, one could not avoid recognizing that nobility of soul which is the true nobility of birth.  When the painter had taken his leave, she said to me: \"I wish to show you a picture which will please you.  The original is in the gallery at Paris.  I read a description of it, and have had it copied by the Italian.\"  She showed me the painting, and waited my opinion.  It was a picture of a man of middle age, in the old German costume.  The expression was dreamy and resigned, and so characteristic that no one could doubt this man once lived.  The whole tone of the picture in the foreground was dark and brownish; but in the background was a landscape, and on the horizon the first gleams of daybreak appeared.  I could discover nothing special in the picture, and yet it produced a feeling of such satisfaction that one might have tarried to look at it for hours at a time.  \"There is nothing like a genuine human face,\" said I; \"Raphael himself could not have imagined a face like this.\"  \"No,\" said she.  \"But now I will tell you why I wished to have the picture.  I read that no one knew the artist, nor whom the picture represents.  But it is very clearly a philosopher of the Middle Ages. Just such a picture I wanted for my gallery, for you are aware that no one knows the author of the 'German Theology,' and moreover, that we have no picture of him.  I wished to try whether the picture of an Unknown by an Unknown would answer for our German theologian, and if you have no objections we will hang it here between the 'Albigenses' and the 'Diet of Worms,' and call it the 'German Theologian.'\"  \"Good,\" said I; \"but it is somewhat too vigorous and manly for the Frankforter.\"  \"That may be,\" replied she.  \"But for a suffering and dying life like mine, much consolation and strength may be derived from his book.  I thank him much, for it disclosed to me for the first time the true secret of Christian doctrine in all its simplicity.  I felt that I was free to believe or disbelieve the old teacher, whoever he may have been, for his doctrines had no external constraint upon me; at last it seized upon me with such power that it seemed to me I knew for the first time what revelation was.  It is precisely this fact that bars so many out from true Christianity, namely: that its doctrines confront us as revelation before revelation takes place in ourselves.  This has often given me much anxiety; not that I had ever doubted the truth and divinity of our religion, but I felt I had no right to a belief which others had given me, and that what I, had learned and received when a child, without comprehending, did not belong to me.  One can believe for us as little as one can live and die for us.\"  \"Certainly,\" said I; \"therein lies the cause of many hot and bitter struggles; that the teachings of Christ, instead of winning our hearts gradually and irresistibly, as they won the hearts of the apostles and early Christians, confront us from the earliest childhood as the infallible law of a mighty church, and demand of us an unconditional submission, which they call faith.  Doubts arise sooner or later in the breast of every one who has the power of thinking and reverence for the truth; and then even when we are on the right road, to overcome our faith, the terrors of doubt and unbelief arise and disturb the tranquil development of the new life.\"  \"I read recently in an English work,\" she interrupted, \"that truth makes revelation, and not revelation truth.  This perfectly expressed what I found in reading the 'German Theology.' I read the book, and I felt the power of its truths so overwhelmingly that I was compelled to submit to it.  The truth was revealed to me; or rather, I was revealed to myself, and I felt for the first time what belief meant.  The truth which had long slumbered in my soul belonged to me, but it was the word of the unknown teacher which filled me with light, illuminated my inner vision, and brought out my indistinct presentiments in fuller clearness before my soul.  When I had thus experienced for the first time how the human soul can believe, I read the Gospels as if they, too, had been written by an Unknown man, and banished the thought as well as I could that they were an inspiration from the Holy Ghost to the apostles, in some wonderful manner; that they had been endorsed by the councils and proclaimed by the church as the supreme authority of"]]]
