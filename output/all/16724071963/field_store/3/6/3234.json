How did you happen to die?\"  \"I fell off the stable roof, sir.\"  \"Well, you got off easily.\" He asked no other questions, to John's relief, but said, \"Your hands look as if you had fought our big tom-cat.\"  John had risen on his uncle's approach. Now Penhallow said, \"Sit down. Put some court-plaster on those scratches, Ann, or a postage stamp--or--so--Come, Leila, the horses are here. Run upstairs and get my riding-whip. That fool brought me down in a hurry. When the chimney took fire last year he ran through the village yelling that the house was burned down. Don't let your aunt coddle you, John.\"  \"Do let the boy alone, James.\"  \"Come, Leila,\" he said.  \"I think I won't ride to-day, Uncle Jim.\"  A faint signal from his wife sent him on his way alone with, \"All right, Leila. Any errands, my dear?\"  \"No--but please call at the grocer's and ask him why he has sent no sugar--and tell Mrs. Saul I want her. If Pole is in, you might mention that when I order beef I do not want veal.\"  While John was being plastered and in dread of the further questions which were not asked, Leila went upstairs, and the Squire rode away to the iron-works smiling and pleased. \"He'll do,\" he murmured, \"but what the deuce was my young dandy doing on the roof?\" The Captain had learned in the army the wisdom of asking no needless questions. \"Leila must have been a pretty lively instructor in mischief. By and by, Ann will have it out of the boy, and--I must stop that. Now she will be too full of surgery. She is sure to think Leila had something to do with it.\" He saw of late that Ann was resolute as to what to him would be a sad loss. Leila was to be sent to school before long--accomplishments! \"Damn accomplishments! I have tried to make a boy out of her--now the inevitable feminine appears--she was scared white--and the boy was pretty shaky. I am sure Leila will know all about it.\" That school business had already been discussed with his wife, and then, he thought, \"There is to come a winter in the city, society, and--some nice young man, and so good-bye, my dear comrade. Get up, Brutus.\" He dismissed his cares as the big bay stretched out in a gallop.  After some surgical care, John was told to go to his room and lie down. He protested that he was in no need of rest, but Ann Penhallow, positive in small ways with every one, including her husband, sent John away with an imperative order, nor on the whole was he sorry to be alone. No one had been too curious. He recognized this as a reasonable habit of the family. And Leila? He was of no mind to be frank with her; and this he had done was a debt paid to John Penhallow! He may not have so put it, but he would not admit to himself that Leila's contemptuous epithet had had any influence on his action. The outcome was a keen sense of happy self-approval. When he had dressed for dinner, feeling pretty sore all over, he found Leila waiting at the head of the stairs.  \"John Penhallow, you threw your cap on the roof and went up to get it, you did.\"  \"I did, Leila, but how did you know?\"  She smiled and replied, \"I--I don't know, John. I am sorry for what I said, and oh! John, Uncle Jim, he was pleased!\"  \"Do you think so?\"  \"Yes.\" She caught his hand and at the last landing let it fall. At dinner, the Squire asked kindly: \"Are you all right, my boy?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" and that was all.  Mark Rivers, who had heard of this incident from Mrs. Penhallow, and at last from Leila, was alone in a position to comprehend the motives which combined to bring about an act of rashness. The rector had some sympathy with the boy and liked him for choosing a time when no one was present to witness his trial of himself. He too had the good sense like the Squire to ask no questions.  Meanwhile, Tom McGregor came no more, feeling the wound to his pride, but without the urgent need felt by John to set himself in a better position with himself. He would have thought nothing of accepting Leila's challenge, but very much wanted to see the polite girl-boy brought to shame. In fact, even the straightforward Squire, with all his ready cordiality, at times found John's extreme politeness ridiculous at his age, but knew it to be the result of absurd training and the absence of natural association with other and manly boys. To Tom it was unexplained and caused that very common feeling of vague suspicion of some claim to superiority which refined manners imply to those who lack manners altogether.     CHAPTER IV   April passed, the arbutus fragrance was gone, while the maples were putting forth ruddy buds which looked like a prophecy of the distant autumn and made gay with colour the young greenery of spring. Meanwhile, school went on, and John grew stronger and broader in this altogether wholesome atmosphere of outdoor activity and indoor life of kindness and apparently inattentive indifference on the part of his busy uncle.  On an evening late in May, 1856 (John long remembered it), the Squire as usual left their little circle and retired to the library, where he busied himself over matters involving business letters, and then fell to reading in the _Tribune_ the bitter politics of Fremont's contest with Buchanan and the still angry talk over Brooks's assault on Senator Sumner. He foresaw defeat and was with cool judgment aware of what the formation of the Republican Party indicated in the way of trouble to come. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise had years before disturbed his party allegiance, and now no longer had he been able to see the grave question of slavery as Ann his wife saw it. He threw aside the papers, set his table in order, and opening the door called John to come in and pay him a visit. The boy rose surprised. Never once had this over-occupied man talked to him at length and he had never been set free to wander in the tempting wilderness of books, which now and then when James Penhallow was absent were remorselessly dusted by Mrs. Ann and the maid, with dislocating consequences over which James Penhallow growled in belated protest.  John went in, glanced up at the Captain's sword over the mantelpiece, and sat down as desired by the still-needed fire.  \"John,\" said his uncle in his usual direct way, \"have you ever been on the back of a horse?\"  \"Yes, sir, once--in Paris at a riding-school.\"  \"Once! You said 'once'--well?\"  \"I fell off--mother was with me.\"  \"And you got on again?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Why not?\"  John flushed and hesitated, watched by the dark-eyed Squire. \"I was afraid!\" He would not say that his mother forbade it.  \"What is your name?\"  \"John, sir,\" he returned astonished.  \"And the rest--the rest, sir,\" added his uncle abruptly.  John troubled by the soldier's impatient tones said: \"Penhallow, sir.\" He was near to a too emotional display.  \"And you, John Penhallow, my brother's son, were afraid?\"  \"I was.\" It was only in part true. His mother had forbidden the master to remount him.  \"By George!\" said Penhallow angrily, \"I don't believe you, I can't!\"  John rose, \"I may be a coward, Uncle James, but I never lie.\"  Penhallow stood up, \"I beg your pardon, John.\"  \"Oh! no, Uncle James. I--please not.\" He felt as if the tall soldier was humiliating himself, but could not have put it in words.  \"I was hasty, my boy. You must, of course, learn to ride. By the way, do you ever read the papers?\"  \"Not often, sir--hardly ever. They are kept in your library or Aunt Ann's.\"  \"Well, it is time you did read them. Come in here when you want to be alone--or any time. You won't bother me. Take what books you want, and ask me about the politics of the day. The country is going to the devil, but don't discuss this election with your aunt.\"  \"No, sir.\" He had gathered from the rector enough to make him understand the warning.  John went out with the idea that this business of learning to ride was somewhere in the future. He was a little disturbed when the next day after breakfast his uncle said, \"Come, John, the horses are in the training-ring.\"  Mrs. Ann said, \"James, if you are going to apply West Point riding-school methods to John, I protest.\"  \"Then protest, my dear,\" he said.  \"You will kill him,\" she returned.  \"My dear Ann, I am not going to kill him, I am going to teach him to live. Come, John. I am going to teach him to ride.\" Raising horses was one of the Squire's amusements, and the training-course where young horses were broken usually got an hour of his busy day.  \"May I come?\" asked Leila.  \"Please, not,\" said John, anticipating disaster and desiring no amused spectators.  \"In a week or so, yes, Leila,\" said Penhallow, \"not now.\"  There were two stable-boys waiting and a pony long retired on grassy pension. \"Now,\" said Penhallow, \"put a foot on my knee and up you go.\"  \"But, there's no saddle.\"  \"There are two. The Lord of horses put one on the back of a horse and another under a man. Up! sir.\" John got on. \"Grip him with your legs, hold on to the mane if you like, but not by the reins.\" The pony feeling no urgency to move stood still and nibbled the young grass. A smart tap of the Squire's whip started him, and John rolled off.  \"Come, sir, get on.\" The boys from the stable grinned. John set his teeth. \"Don't stiffen yourself. That's better.\"  He fell once again, and at the close of an hour his uncle said, \"There that will do for to-day, and not so bad either.\"  \"I'd like to try it again, sir,\" gasped John.  \"You young humbug,\" laughed Penhallow. \"Go and console your distracted aunt. I am off to the mills.\"  The ex-captain was merciless enough, and day after day John was so stiff that, as he confessed to Leila, a jointed doll was a trifle to his condition. She laughed, \"I went through it once, but one day it came.\"  \"What came, Leila?\"  \"Oh! the joy of the horse!\"  \"I shall never get to that.\" But he did, for the hard riding-master scolded, smiled, praised, and when at last John sat in the saddle the bareback lessons gave him a certain confidence. The training went on day after "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14153"],["title","Westways: A Village Chronicle (#8)"],["body","day, under the rule of patient but relentless efficiency. It was far into June when, having backed without serious misadventures two or three well-broken horses, Penhallow mounted him on Leila's mare, Lucy, and set out to ride with him.  \"Let us ride to the mills, John.\" The mare was perfectly gaited and easy. They rode on, talking horses.  \"You will have to manage the mills some day,\" said Penhallow. \"You own quite a fifth of them. Now I have three partners, but some day you and I will run them.\" The boy had been there before with Rivers, but now the Squire presented him to the foreman and as they moved about explained the machinery. It was altogether delightful, and this was a newly discovered uncle. On the way home the Squire talked of the momentous November elections and of his dread of the future with Buchanan in power, while he led the way through lanes and woods until they came to the farm.  \"We will cross the fields,\" he said, and dismounting took down the upper bars of a fence. Then he rode back a little, and returning took the low fence, crying, \"Now, John, sit like a sack--loosely. The mare jumps like a frog; go back a bit. Now, then, give her her head!\" For a moment he was in the air as his uncle cried, \"You lost a stirrup. Try it again. Oh! that was better. Now, once more, come,\" and he was over at Penhallow's side. He had found the joy of the horse! \"A bit more confidence and practice and you will do. I want you to ride Venus. She shies at a shadow--at anything black. Don't forget that.\"  \"Oh, thank you, Uncle James!\"  \"It is Uncle Jim now, my boy. I knew from the first you would come out all right. I believe in blood--horses and men. I believe in blood.\" This was James Penhallow all over. A reticent man, almost as tenderly trustful as a woman, of those who came up to his standards of honour, truth and the courage which rightly seemed to him the backbone of all the virtues.  What John thought may be readily imagined. Accustomed to be considered and flattered, his uncle's quiet reserve had seemed to him disappointing, and now of late this abrupt praise and accepting comradeship left the sensitive lad too grateful for words. The man at his side was wise enough to say no more, and they rode home and dismounted without further speech.  After dinner John sought a corner with Leila, where he could share with her his new-born enthusiasm about horses. The Squire called to the rector and Mrs. Ann to come into his library. \"Sit down, Mark,\" he said, \"I am rash to invite you; both you and Ann bore me to death with your Sunday schools and the mill men who won't come to church. I don't hear our Baptist friend complain.\"  \"But he does,\" said Rivers.  \"I do not wonder,\" said Ann, \"that they will not attend the chapel.\"  \"If,\" said Penhallow, \"you were to swap pulpits, Mark, it would draw. There are many ways--oh, I am quite in earnest, Ann. Don't put on one of your excommunicating looks. I remember once in Idaho at dusk, I had two guides. They were positive, each of them, that certain trails would lead to the top. I tossed up which to go with. It was pretty serious--Indians and so on--I'll tell you about it some time, rector. Well, we met at dawn on the summit. How about the moral, Ann?\"  Ann Penhallow laughed. In politics, morals and religion, she held unchanging sentiments. \"My dear James, people who make fables supply the morals. I decline.\"  \"Very good, but you see mine.\"  \"I never see what I do not want to see,\" which was pretty close to the truth.  \"The fact is,\" said Rivers, \"I have preaccepted the Squire's hint. Grace is sick again. I tell him it is that last immersion business. I have promised to preach for him next Sunday, as your young curate at the mills wants to air his eloquence here.\"  \"Not really!\" said Mrs. Ann, \"at his chapel?\"  \"Yes, and I mean to use a part of our service.\"  \"If the Bishop knew it.\"  \"If! he would possibly forbid it, or be glad I did it.\"  Mrs. Ann totally disapproved. She took up her knitting and said no more, while Rivers and Penhallow talked of a disturbance at the works of no great moment. The rector noticed Mrs. Penhallow's sudden loss of interest in their talk and her failure to comment on his statement, an unusual thing with this woman, who, busy-minded as the bee, gathered honey of interest from most of the affairs of life. In a pause of the talk he turned to her, \"I am sorry to have annoyed you,\" he said--\"I mean about preaching for Grace.\"  \"But why do you do it?\"  \"Because,\" he returned, \"my Master bids me. Over and over one finds in His Word that he foreknew how men would differ and come to worship Him and use His revelations in ways which would depend on diversity of temperaments, or under the leadership of individual minds of great force. It may be that it was meant that we should disagree, and yet--I--yet as to essentials we are one. That I never can forget.\"  \"Then,\" she said quickly, \"you are of many creeds.\"  \"No and yes,\" he returned smiling. \"In essentials yes, in ceremonial usage no; in some other morsels of belief held by others charitably dubious--I dislike argument about religion in the brief inadequateness of talk--especially with you from whom I am apt to differ and to whom I owe so much--so very much.\"  She took up her knitting again as she said, \"I am afraid the balance of debt is on our side.\"  \"Then,\" said Penhallow, who, too, disliked argument on religion, \"if you have got through with additions to the useless squabbles of centuries, which hurt and never help, I--\"  \"But,\" broke in his wife, \"I have had no answer.\"  \"Oh, but you have, Ann; for me, Rivers is right.\"  \"Then I am in a minority of one,\" she returned, \"but I have not had my say.\"  \"Well, dear, keep it for next time. Now I want, as I said, a little counsel about John.\"  \"And about Leila, James. Something has got to be done.\"  The Squire said ruefully, \"Yes, I suppose so. I do not know that anything needs to be done. You saw John's condition before dinner. He had a swollen nose and fair promise of a black eye. I asked you to take no notice of it. I wanted first to hear what had happened. I got Leila on the porch and extracted it by bits. It seems that Tom was rude to Leila.\"  \"I never liked your allowing him to play with the children, James.\"  \"But the boy needs boy-company.\"  \"And what of Leila? She needs girl-company.\"  \"I fear,\" said Rivers, \"that may be the case.\"  \"It is so,\" said Mrs. Ann decisively, pleased with his support. \"What happened, James?\"  \"I did not push Leila about what Tom did. John slapped his face and got knocked down. He got up and went at Tom like a wildcat. Tom knocked him down again and held him. He said that John must say he had had enough.\"  \"He didn't,\" said Rivers, \"I am sure he didn't.\"  \"No, Mark, he said he would die first, which was what he should have said. Then Billy had the sense to pull the big boy off, and as Leila was near tears I asked no more questions. It was really most satisfactory.\"  \"How can you say that?\" said his wife. \"It was brutal.\"  \"You do not often misunderstand me, Ann. I mean, of course, that our boy did the right thing. How does it strike you, Mark?\"  He had a distinct intention to get the rector into trouble. \"Not this time, Squire,\" and he laughed. \"The boy did what his nature bade him. Of course, being a nice little boy, he should have remonstrated. There are several ways--\"  \"Thanks,\" said Penhallow. \"Of course, Ann, the playing with Tom will end. I fancy there is no need to interfere.\"  \"He should be punished for rudeness to Leila,\" said Mrs. Penhallow.  \"Oh, well, he's a rough lad and like enough sorry. How can I punish him without making too much of a row.\"  \"You are quite right, as I see it,\" said Rivers. \"Let it drop; but, indeed, it is true that Leila should have other than rough lads as school-companions.\"  \"Oh, Lord! Rivers.\"  \"I am glad to agree with you at least about one thing,\" said Mrs. Penhallow. \"In September John will be sixteen, and Leila a year or so younger. She is now simply a big, daring, strong boy.\"  \"If you think that, Ann, you are oddly mistaken.\"  \"I am,\" she said; \"I was. It was only one end of my reasons why she must go to school. Before John came and when we had cousins here--girls, she simply despised them or led them into dreadful scrapes.\"  \"Well, Ann, we will talk it over another time.\"  Rivers smiled and Ann Penhallow went out, longing to attend to the swollen face now bent low over a book. The two men she left smoked in such silence as is one of the privileges of friendship. At last Penhallow said, \"Of course, Mark, my wife is right, but I shall miss the girl. My wife cannot ride with me, and now I am to lose Leila. After school come young men. Confound it, rector, I wish the girl had less promise of beauty--of--well, all the Greys have it--attractiveness for our sex. Some of them are fools, but they have it all the same, and they keep it to the end. What is most queer about it is that they are not easily won. The men who trouble hearts for a game do not win these women.\"  \"Some one will suffer,\" said Rivers reflectively. He wondered if the wooing of Ann Grey by this masterful man had been a long one. A moment he gave to remembrance of his own long and tender care of the very young wife he had won easily and seen fade with terrible slowness as her life let fall its joys as it were leaf by leaf, with bitter sense of losing the fair heritage of youth. Now he said, \"Were all these women, Squire, who had the gift of bewitchment, good?\"  \"No, now and then hurtful, or honest gentlewomen, or like Ann Grey too entirely good for this wicked world--\"  \"As Westways knows,\" said Rivers, thinking how the serene beauty of a life of noble ways had contributed spiritual charm to whatever Ann Penhallow had of attractiveness. \"But,\" he went on, \"Leila cannot go until the fall, and you will still have the boy. I had my doubts of your method of education, but it has worked well. He has a good mind and is so "]]]
