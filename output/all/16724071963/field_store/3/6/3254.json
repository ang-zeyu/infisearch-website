[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],["title","The Kybalion (#2)"],["body","Masters wrote, long ages ago: \"He who grasps the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to Mastery.\" And these words are as true today as at the time they were first written. Without this Master-Key, Mastery is impossible, and the student knocks in vain at the many doors of The Temple.  2.  The Principle of Correspondence      \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that there is always a Correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life. The old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\" And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. There are planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that would otherwise be unknowable to us. This Principle is of universal application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material, mental, and spiritual universe--it is an Universal Law. The ancient Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid from view the Unknown. Its use even tore aside the Veil of Isis to the extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess might be caught. Just as a knowledge of the Principles of Geometry enables man to measure distant suns and their movements, while seated in his observatory, so a knowledge of the Principle of Correspondence enables Man to reason intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.  Studying the monad, he understands the archangel.  3.  The Principle of Vibration      \"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\"--The     Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is in motion\"; \"everything vibrates\"; \"nothing is at rest\"; facts which Modern Science endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify.  And yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by the Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that the differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all is in vibration--the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale, there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem at rest. Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion. This is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes. An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas, enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. \"He who understands the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power,\" says one of the old writers.  4.  The Principle of Polarity      \"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its     pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are     identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet;     all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be     reconciled.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is dual\"; \"everything has two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which were old Hermetic axioms. It explains the old paradoxes, that have perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites are the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same time\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\"; \"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. It explains that in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that \"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with many varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold, although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins! There is no such thing as \"absolute heat\" or \"absolute cold\"--the two terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\" is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So \"heat\" and \"cold\" are simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"--and the phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and Darkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does \"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between \"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"? Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. The same Principle operates on the Mental Plane. Let us take a radical and extreme example--that of \"Love and Hate,\" two mental states apparently totally different.  And yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of Love, and a middle point in which we use the terms \"Like or Dislike,\" which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss to know whether we \"like\" or \"dislike\" or \"neither.\" And all are simply degrees of the same thing, as you will see if you will but think a moment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance by the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to the vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others. Many of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the involuntary rapid transition from Love to Hate, and the reverse, in your own case and that of others.  And you will therefore realize the possibility of this being accomplished by the use of the Will, by means of the Hermetic formulas. \"Good and Evil\" are but the poles of the same thing, and the Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short, the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master the art.  5.  The Principle of Rhythm      \"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;     all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in     everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the     measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.\"--The     Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide and low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. There is always an action and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind, energy, and matter.  This law is manifest in the creation and destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of all things; and finally in the mental states of Man (and it is with this latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most important). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its universal application, and have also discovered certain means to overcome its effects in themselves by the use of the appropriate formulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. They cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar methods, consist the Art of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which would tend to carry him to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously, but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like a pendulum. This Principle and that of Polarity have been closely studied by the Hermetists, and the methods of counteracting, neutralizing, and USING them form an important part of the Hermetic Mental Alchemy.  6.  The Principle of Cause and Effect      \"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause;     everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name     for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation,     but nothing escapes the Law.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the fact "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],["title","The Kybalion (#3)"],["body","there is a Cause for every Effect; an Effect from every Cause. It explains that:  \"Everything Happens according to Law\"; that nothing ever \"merely happens\"; that there is no such thing as Chance; that while there are various planes of Cause and Effect, the higher dominating the lower planes, still nothing ever entirely escapes the Law. The Hermetists understand the art and methods of rising above the ordinary plane of Cause and Effect, to a certain degree, and by mentally rising to a higher plane they become Causers instead of Effects. The masses of people are carried along, obedient to environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than themselves; heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about like pawns on the Chessboard of Life. But the Masters, rising to the plane above, dominate their moods, characters, qualities, and powers, as well as the environment surrounding them, and become Movers instead of pawns. They help to PLAY THE GAME OF LIFE, instead of being played and moved about by other wills and environment. They USE the Principle instead of being its tools. The Masters obey the Causation of the higher planes, but they help to RULE on their own plane. In this statement there is condensed a wealth of Hermetic knowledge--let him read who can.  7.  The Principle of Gender      \"Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine     and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all     planes.\"--The Kybalion.  This Principle embodies the truth that there is GENDER manifested in everything--the Masculine and Feminine Principles ever at work. This is true not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the Spiritual Planes. On the Physical Plane, the Principle manifests as SEX, on the higher planes it takes higher forms, but the Principle is ever the same.  No creation, physical, mental or spiritual, is possible without this Principle. An understanding of its laws will throw light on many a subject that has perplexed the minds of men. The Principle of Gender works ever in the direction of generation, regeneration, and creation. Everything, and every person, contains the two Elements or Principles, or this great Principle, within it, him or her. Every Male thing has the Female Element also; every Female contains also the Male Principle.  If you would understand the philosophy of Mental and Spiritual Creation, Generation, and Re-generation, you must understand and study this Hermetic Principle. It contains the solution of many mysteries of Life. We caution you that this Principle has no reference to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a prostitution of the great natural principle of Gender. Such base revivals of the ancient infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind, body and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning note against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust, licentiousness, and perversion of Nature's principles. If you seek such teachings, you must go elsewhere for them--Hermeticism contains nothing for you along these lines. To the pure, all things are pure; to the base, all things are base.    CHAPTER III  MENTAL TRANSMUTATION      \"Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted,     from state to state; degree to degree; condition to condition;     pole to pole; vibration to vibration. True Hermetic Transmutation     is a Mental Art.\"--The Kybalion.  As we have stated, the Hermetists were the original alchemists, astrologers, and psychologists, Hermes having been the founder of these schools of thought. From astrology has grown modern astronomy; from alchemy has grown modern chemistry; from the mystic psychology has grown the modern psychology of the schools. But it must not be supposed that the ancients were ignorant of that which the modern schools suppose to be their exclusive and special property. The records engraved on the stones of Ancient Egypt show conclusively that the ancients had a full comprehensive knowledge of astronomy, the very building of the Pyramids showing the connection between their design and the study of astronomical science. Nor were they ignorant of Chemistry, for the fragments of the ancient writings show that they were acquainted with the chemical properties of things; in fact, the ancient theories regarding physics are being slowly verified by the latest discoveries of modern science, notably those relating to the constitution of matter. Nor must it be supposed that they were ignorant of the so-called modern discoveries in psychology--on the contrary, the Egyptians were especially skilled in the science of Psychology, particularly in the branches that the modern schools ignore, but which, nevertheless, are being uncovered under the name of \"psychic science\" which is perplexing the psychologists of to-day, and making them reluctantly admit that \"there may be something in it after all.\"  The truth is, that beneath the material chemistry, astronomy and psychology (that is, the psychology in its phase of \"brain-action\") the ancients possessed a knowledge of transcendental astronomy, called astrology; of transcendental chemistry, called alchemy; of transcendental psychology, called mystic psychology. They possessed the Inner Knowledge as well as the Outer Knowledge, the latter alone being possessed by modern scientists. Among the many secret branches of knowledge possessed by the Hermetists, was that known as Mental Transmutation, which forms the subject matter of this lesson.  \"Transmutation\" is a term usually employed to designate the ancient art of the transmutation of metals--particularly of the base metals into gold. The word \"Transmute\" means \"to change from one nature, form, or substance, into another; to transform\" (Webster). And accordingly, \"Mental Transmutation\" means the art of changing and transforming mental states, forms, and conditions, into others. So you may see that Mental Transmutation is the \"Art of Mental Chemistry,\" if you like the term--a form of practical Mystic Psychology.  But this means far more than appears on the surface. Transmutation, Alchemy, or Chemistry on the Mental Plane is important enough in its effects, to be sure, and if the art stopped there it would still be one of the most important branches of study known to man. But this is only the beginning. Let us see why!  The first of the Seven Hermetic Principles is the Principle of Mentalism, the axiom of which is \"THE ALL is Mind; the Universe is Mental,\" which means that the Underlying Reality of the Universe is Mind; and the Universe itself is Mental--that is, \"existing in the Mind of THE ALL.\" We shall consider this Principle in succeeding lessons, but let us see the effect of the principle if it be assumed to be true.  If the Universe is Mental in its nature, then Mental Transmutation must be the art of CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE UNIVERSE, along the lines of Matter, Force and mind. So you see, therefore, that Mental Transmutation is really the \"Magic\" of which the ancient; writers had so much to say in their mystical works, and about which they gave so few practical instructions. If All be Mental, then the art which enables one to transmute mental conditions must render the Master the controller of material conditions as well as those ordinarily called \"mental.\"  As a matter of fact, none but advanced Mental Alchemists have been able to attain the degree of power necessary to control the grosser physical conditions, such as the control of the elements of Nature; the production or cessation of tempests; the production and cessation of earthquakes and other great physical phenomena. But that such men have existed, and do exist today, is a matter of earnest belief to all advanced occultists of all schools. That the Masters exist, and have these powers, the best teachers assure their students, having had experiences which justify them in such belief and statements. These Masters do not make public exhibitions of their powers, but seek seclusion from the crowds of men, in order to better work their may along the Path of Attainment. We mention their existence, at this point, merely to call your attention to the fact that their power is entirely Mental, and operates along the lines of the higher Mental Transmutation, under the Hermetic Principle of Mentalism.      \"The Universe is Mental\"--The Kybalion.  But students and Hermetists of lesser degree than Masters--the Initiates and Teachers--are able to freely work along the Mental Plane, in Mental Transmutation. In fact all that we call \"psychic phenomena,\"; \"mental influence\"; \"mental science\"; \"new-thought phenomena,\" etc., operates along the same general lines, for there is but one principle involved, no matter by what name the phenomena be called.  The student and practitioner of Mental Transmutation works among the Mental Plane, transmuting mental conditions, states, etc., into others, according to various formulas, more or less efficacious. The various \"treatments,\" \"affirmations,\" \"denials\" etc., of the schools of mental science are but formulas, often quite imperfect and unscientific, of The Hermetic Art. The majority of modern practitioners are quite ignorant compared to the ancient masters, for they lack the fundamental knowledge upon which the work is based.  Not only may the mental states, etc., of one's self be changed or transmuted by Hermetic Methods; but also the states of others may be, and are, constantly transmuted in the same way, usually unconsciously, but often consciously by some understanding the laws and principles, in cases where the people affected are not informed of the principles of self-protection. And more than this, as many students and practitioners of modern mental science know, every material condition depending upon the minds of other people may be changed or transmuted in accordance with the earnest desire, will,"]]]
