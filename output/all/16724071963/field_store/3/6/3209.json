Besides being good cooks, they were both excellent waitresses; in consequence it made no difference which one was on duty at meal time.  One employee only was in charge of breakfast; she came at seven o'clock in the morning, and worked steadily until eleven o'clock, when the second employee arrived. She then went out for her lunch, returning at twelve, and remaining on duty until four o'clock in the afternoon. She was then free for the remainder of the day.  The second employee, as soon as she arrived at 11 A.M., went through the house and finished any work that was not completed by the first employee. She worked without stopping until 3 P.M., then went away for her lunch; she returned at 4 P.M. to relieve the first employee whose work was over at four o'clock. The second employee remained on duty until 8 P.M.; she cooked and served dinner so quickly and efficiently that the housewife who had always been accustomed to have two employees, a \"cook\" and a \"waitress,\" on duty for dinner every night, found to her great surprise that one efficient household employee, working on schedule time, accomplished in the same time the work of two of her former \"servants.\"   SCHEDULE NO. VI  In this schedule the housewife wanted both her employees to help her with her two children. With this end in view, she made all the work of the house interchange with the care of the children; in consequence when one employee was off duty, the other could always be relied on to help with the children. This proved to be a very successful schedule, for it relieved the mother from being obliged to sit in the nursery as she was compelled to do every time her former \"nurse\" went downstairs to her meals, or had her \"afternoon off.\" But when the mother wished to be with her children, and that was very often, the employee who was in the nursery at the time, left the room immediately to attend to other household duties.  Both employees were on duty at 7 A.M., a most necessary arrangement where there are small children in a family. The first employee prepared and served breakfast for the family, while the other employee took full charge of the children, giving them their breakfast in the nursery, and taking them out afterwards for a walk. At 10 A.M., she returned with the children, and she was then off duty for two hours. The mother generally chose this time to be with her children; if however, she had any other engagement, the first employee was on duty until noon and could be called upon to look after them.    _First Employee_    From 7 A.M. to 12 M.           5 hours   From 5 P.M. to  8 P.M.         3 hours                                  -------                                  8 hours    _Second Employee_    From  7 A.M. to 10 A.M.        3 hours   From 12 M.   to  5 P.M.        5 hours                                  -------                                  8 hours   SCHEDULE NO. VII  There are many families who may object to all the preceding schedules on account of the early hour in the evening for household employees to be off duty. When the housewife has never had her housework done on schedule time by an efficient employee, she may well think it impossible to have the dinner dishes washed up and everything put away in order by 8 P.M. However some families do not begin dinner before half past seven, or eight o'clock, or even later, but in these families, it is not unusual for the breakfast hour to be very late also. In consequence nothing is easier than to make a schedule for the day's work begin late and end late, without making any other alteration in it.  The following schedule, however, combines an early breakfast and a late dinner, in a family where only two employees were kept:    _First Employee_    From 7 A.M. to 12 M.           5 hours   From 5 P.M. to  8 P.M.         3 hours                                  -------                                  8 hours    _Second Employee_    From 12 M.   to  5 P.M.        5 hours   From  7 P.M. to 10 P.M.        3 hours   (or from 8 to 11 P.M.)                                  -------                                  8 hours   EIGHT HOUR SCHEDULES FOR THREE EMPLOYEES  The greater the number of household employees, the easier it is to make a satisfactory working schedule. But the temptation to specialize the work is greater, and should be carefully guarded against. It is just as necessary with three employees as with one for the housewife to insist that each one be capable and willing to do all kinds of work in the home, including sewing and taking care of children.  With three employees, the housewife ought to make them take turns in cooking and serving one of the three meals each day. This enables them to become familiar with the dining room and with the different dishes for each course; it also removes any feeling of embarrassment which naturally might be felt by an employee who is rarely called upon to cook or serve a meal.  To have an expert needlewoman in the house is a great boon to the housewife, and when she has three employees who can sew in her home, she ought to insist upon a great deal of sewing and mending being done by each one of them.  It is rare that the \"servant\" of to-day is a good sewer; in fact the housewife would hesitate to ask her to do even the ordinary mending, but when one engages household employees on an eight hour schedule, and when there are a hundred women to choose from, it is not hard to find several who sew well.   SCHEDULE NO. VIII  It is so easy to plan the housework for three employees that one schedule as an example seems quite sufficient, and the only thing that the housewife must remember is to make all the work interchangeable.     _First Employee_    From  7 A.M. to 11 A.M.        4 hours   From 12 M.   to  4 P.M.        4 hours                                  -------                                  8 hours    _Second Employee_    From 11 A.M. to 3 P.M.         4 hours   From  4 P.M. to 8 P.M.         4 hours                                  -------                                  8 hours    _Third Employee_    From 2 P.M. to  5 P.M.         3 hours   From 6 P.M. to 11 P.M.         5 hours                                  -------                                  8 hours     CONCLUSION   In conclusion it seems that a few words are necessary about families who need the services of an employee at night as well as in the day time. There are many mothers who do not wish or who are not able to take care of their children at night, and in consequence it is absolutely necessary to have an attendant. The present custom is to have the nurse or maid sleep in the same room as the baby, or in a room adjoining the children's bedroom, so as to be within call. But a woman who has worked all day, or even eight hours a day, should not have her sleep disturbed at night by taking care of children. No woman can be fit for her work the next day if she has not been able to secure the average amount of sleep necessary to health.  In many cases it has been proved that when a child does not sleep well at night, the nurse has taken upon herself the responsibility of giving it \"soothing syrup\" so as to keep it quiet. This is hardly to be wondered at when one considers the strain under which the nurse is kept day and night by taking care of a small child; besides the average nurse is generally ignorant of the harm caused by so-called \"soothing syrups.\"  If a child be sick, the mother should call in a trained nurse, that is if she can afford it, and when she has several employees, she can usually afford this extra expense. If the child or children be well, and the mother desires some one to attend to them at night, she should engage a woman who has no occupation during the day and who is willing to work at night. She should make a point of choosing one who sews well, so that the services of a seamstress might be combined with the duties of a night nurse. There is always some mending to do in all families and a woman who is clever with her needle might make herself very useful to her employer. Thousands of women sew by artificial light in dressmaking establishments and factories; in all probability just as many women could be found to sew by artificial light in private homes. Perhaps at first the novelty of working at night might deter women from taking a position similar to the one suggested above, but a woman who was really in need of work would not let the unusual hours prevent her from accepting it,  Many men work at night and it is not unlikely that many women would be willing to do it too. Women are not as timid as they were reputed to be in former years; they would neither scream nor faint nowadays at the sight of a little mouse scampering across the floor. Indeed quite recently the newspapers reported that a woman whose husband had just died had accepted the position of a night watchman, and she filled her new r√¥le so successfully that on one occasion she managed to seize a burglar and handed him over to a policeman.  This proposition of engaging a woman to work at night is only a suggestion, however, offered to those who find it absolutely necessary to have a domestic employee in their house at night. It remains to be proved if it could be carried out successfully.  But the great changes in housekeeping described in the preceding chapters are not mere suggestions nor theories of what might be done: each reform has already been put into actual practice. The result has been so extraordinary that one is impelled to believe that the only way to solve the Servant Problem is to apply business principles to housework in private homes.  Naturally such a revolution from methods now in vogue can not be wrought in a day, and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14128"],["title","Toni, the Little Woodcarver (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Not far away rushes down from the wooded heights of rock the Wild brook, which in times of heavy rains, has carried away so many rocks and bowlders that when the storms are ended a ragged mass of stones is left, through which flows a swift, clear stream of water. Therefore the little dwelling near by this brook is called the stone hut.  Here lived the honest day-laborer Toni, who conducted himself well in every farm-house, where he went to work, for he was quiet and industrious, punctual at his tasks, and reliable in every way.  In his hut at home he had a young wife and a little boy, who was a joy to both of them. Near the hut in the little shed was the goat, the milk of which supplied food for the mother and child, while the father received his board through the week on the farms where he worked from morning until night. Only on Sunday was he at home with his wife and little Toni. The wife Elsbeth, kept her little house in good order; it was narrow and tiny, but it always looked so clean and cheerful that every one liked to come into the sunny room, and the father, Toni, was never so happy as when he was at home in the stone hut with his little boy on his knee.  For five years the family lived in harmony and undisturbed peace. Although they had no abundance and little worldly goods, they were happy and content. The husband earned enough, so they did not suffer want, and they desired nothing beyond their simple manner of life, for they loved each other and their greatest delight was little Toni.  The little boy grew strong and healthy and with his merry ways delighted his father's heart, when he remained at home on Sundays, and sweetened all his mother's work on week-days, when his father was away until late in the evening.  Little Toni was now four years old and already knew how to be helpful in all sorts of small ways, in the house and the goat's shed and also in the field behind the hut. From morning until night he tripped happily behind his mother for he was as content as the little birds up in the old fir-tree.  When Saturday night came the mother scrubbed and cleaned with doubled energy, to finish early, for on that day the father was through his work earlier than other days, and she always went with little Toni by the hand, part way to meet him. This was a great delight to the child. He now knew very well how one task followed another in the household. When his mother began to scrub, he jumped around in the room, with delight and cried out again and again: \"Now we are going for Father! Now we are going for Father!\" until the moment came when his mother took him by the hand and started along.  Saturday evening had come again in the lovely month of May. Outdoors the birds in the trees were singing merrily up to the blue sky; indoors the mother was cleaning busily, in order to get out early into the golden evening, and meanwhile now outside, now in the house, little Toni was hopping around and shouting:  \"Now we are going for Father!\"  It was not long before the work was finished. The mother put on her shawl, tied on her best apron and stepped out of the house.  Toni jumped for joy and ran three times around his mother, then seized her hand and shouted once more:  \"Now we are going for Father!\"  Then he tripped along beside his mother in the lovely, sunny evening. They wandered to the Wild brook, over the wooden bridge, which crosses it, and came to the narrow foot-path, winding up through the flower-laden meadows to the farm where the father worked.  The last rays of the setting sun fell across the meadows and the sound of the evening bells came up from Kandergrund.  The mother stood still and folded her hands.  \"Lay your hands together Toneli,\" she said, \"it is the Angelus.\"  The child obeyed.  \"What must I pray, Mother?\" he asked.  \"Give us and all tired people a blessed Sunday! Amen!\" said the mother devoutly.  Toneli repeated the prayer. Suddenly he screamed: \"Father is coming!\"  Down from the farm some one was running as fast as he could come.  \"That is not Father,\" said his mother, and both went towards the running man. When they met, the man stood still and said, gasping:  \"Don't go any farther, turn around, Elsbeth. I came straight to you, for something has happened.\"  \"Oh, my God!\" cried the woman in the greatest anguish, \"has something happened to Toni?\"  \"Yes, he was with the wood-cutters, and then he was struck. They have brought him back; he is lying up at the farm-but don't go up there,\" he added, holding Elsbeth fast, for she wanted to start off as soon as she heard the news.  \"Not go up?\" she said quickly. \"I must go to him; I must help him and see about bringing him home.\"  \"You cannot help him, he is--he is already dead,\" said the messenger in an unsteady voice. Then he turned and ran back again, glad to have the message off his mind.  Elsbeth threw herself down on a stone by the way, unable to stand or to walk. She held her apron before her face and burst into weeping and sobbing, so that Toneli was distressed and frightened. He pressed close to his mother and began to cry too.  It was already dark, when Elsbeth finally came to herself and could think of her child. The little one was still sitting beside her on the ground, with both hands pressed to his eyes, and sobbing pitifully. His mother lifted him up.  \"Come, Toneli, we must go home; it is late,\" she said, taking him by the hand.  But he"]]]
