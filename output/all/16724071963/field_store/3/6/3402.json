If that       care fails, discipline can only be imperfectly maintained. It       is impossible for the soldier who endures sufferings,       hardships, fatigues, who meets danger, to take only 'in       proportion to the resources of the country.' He must take       whatever is needful for his existence. We cannot ask him for       what is superhuman.        \"The greatest kindness in war is to bring it to a speedy       conclusion. It should be allowable with that view to employ       all methods save those which are absolutely objectionable       ('dazu m√ºssen alle nicht geradezu verwerfliche Mittel       freistehen'). I can by no means profess agreement with the       Declaration of St. Petersburg when it asserts that 'the       weakening of the military forces of the enemy' is the only       lawful procedure in war. No, you must attack all the resources       of the enemy's Government: its finances, its railways, its       stores, and even its prestige. Thus energetically, and yet       with a moderation previously unknown, was the late war against       France conducted. The issue of the campaign was decided in two       months, and the fighting did not become embittered till a       revolutionary Government, unfortunately for the country,       prolonged the war for four more months.        \"I am glad to see that the manual, in clear and precise       articles, pays more attention to the necessities of war than       has been paid by previous attempts. But for Governments to       recognise these rules will not be enough to insure that they       shall be observed. It has long been a universally recognised       custom of warfare that a flag of truce must not be fired on,       and yet we have seen that rule violated on several occasions       during the late war.        \"Never will an article learnt by rote persuade soldiers to see       a regular enemy (sections 2-4) in the unorganised population       which takes up arms 'spontaneously' (so of its own motion) and       puts them in danger of their life at every moment of day and       night. Certain requirements of the manual might be impossible       of realisation; for instance, the identification of the slain       after a great battle. Other requirements would be open to       criticism did not the intercalation of such words as 'if       circumstances permit,' 'if possible,' 'if it can be done,' 'if       necessary,' give them an elasticity but for which the bonds       they impose must be broken by inexorable reality.        \"I am of opinion that in war, where everything must be       individual, the only articles which will prove efficacious are       those which are addressed specifically to commanders. Such are       the rules of the manual relating to the wounded, the sick, the       surgeons, and medical appliances. The general recognition of       these principles, and of those also which relate to prisoners,       would mark a distinct step of progress towards the goal       pursued with so honourable a persistency by the Institut de       Droit International.        \"COUNT VON MOLTKE, Field-Marshal-General.\"   PROFESSOR BLUNTSCHLI'S REPLY TO COUNT VON MOLTKE  Sir,--In accordance with a wish expressed in several quarters, I send you, on the chance of your being able to make room for it, a translation of Professor Bluntschli's reply to the letter from Count von Moltke which appeared in _The Times_ of the 1st inst.  Your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, February (1881).        \"Christmas, 1880.        \"I am very grateful for your Excellency's detailed and kind       statement of opinion as to the manual of the laws of war. This       statement invites serious reflections. I see in it a testimony       of the highest value, of historical importance; and I shall       communicate it forthwith to the members of the Institut de       Droit International.        \"For the present I do not think I can better prove my       gratitude to your Excellency than by sketching the reasons       which have guided our members, and so indicating the nature of       the different views which prevail upon the subject.        \"It is needless to say that the same facts present themselves       in a different light and give a different impression as they       are looked at from the military or the legal point of view.       The difference is diminished, but not removed, when an       illustrious general from his elevated position takes also into       consideration the great moral and political duties of States,       and when, on the other hand, the representatives of science of       international law set themselves to bring legal principles       into relation with military necessities.        \"For the man of arms the interest of the safety and success of       the army will always take precedence of that of the       inoffensive population, while the jurist, convinced that law       is the safeguard of all, and especially for the weak against       the strong, will ever feel it a duty to secure for private       individuals in districts occupied by an enemy the       indispensable protection of law. There may be members of the       Institut who do not give up the hope that some day, thanks to       the progress of civilisation, humanity will succeed in       substituting an organised international justice for the wars       which now-a-days take place between sovereign States. But the       body of the Institut, as a whole, well knows that that hope       has no chance of being realised in our time, and limits its       action in this matter to two principal objects, the attainment       of which is possible:--        \"1. To open and facilitate the settlement of trifling disputes       between nations by judicial methods, war being unquestionably       a method out of all proportion in such cases.        \"2. To aid in elucidating and strengthening legal order even       in time of war.        \"I acknowledge unreservedly that the customs of warfare have       improved since the establishment of standing armies, a       circumstance which has rendered possible a stricter       discipline, and has necessitated a greater care for the       provisionment of troops. I also acknowledge unreservedly that       the chief credit for this improvement is due to military       commanders. Brutal and barbarous pillage was prohibited by       generals before jurists were convinced of its illegality. If       in our own day a law recognised by the civilised world       forbids, in a general way, the soldier to make booty in       warfare on land, we have here a great advance in civilisation,       and the jurists have had their share in bringing it about.       Since compulsory service has turned standing armies into       national armies, war has also become national. Laws of war are       consequently more than ever important and necessary, since, in       the differences of culture and opinion which prevail between       individuals and classes, law is almost the only moral power       the force of which is acknowledged by all, and which binds all       together under common rules. This pleasing and cheering       circumstance is one which constantly meets us in the Institut       de Droit International. We see a general legal persuasion ever       in process of more and more distinct formation uniting all       civilised peoples. Men of nations readily disunited and       opposed--Germans and French, English and Russians, Spaniards       and Dutchmen, Italians and Austrians--are, as a rule, all of       one mind as to the principles of international law.        \"This is what makes it possible to proclaim an international       law of war, approved by the legal conscience of all civilised       peoples; and when a principle is thus generally accepted, it       exerts an authority over minds and manners which curbs sensual       appetites and triumphs over barbarism. We are well aware of       the imperfect means of causing its decrees to be respected and       carried out which are at the disposal of the law of nations.       We know also that war, which moves nations so deeply, rouses       to exceptional activity the good qualities as well as the evil       instincts of human nature. It is for this very reason that the       jurist is impelled to present the legal principles, of the       need for which he is convinced, in a clear and precise form,       to the feeling of justice of the masses, and to the legal       conscience of those who guide them. He is persuaded that his       declaration will find a hearing in the conscience of those       whom it principally concerns, and a powerful echo in the       public opinion of all countries.        \"The duty of seeing that international law is obeyed, and of       punishing violations of it, belongs, in the first instance, to       States, each within the limits of its own supremacy. The       administration of the law of war ought therefore to be       intrusted primarily to the State which wields the public power       in the place where an offence is committed. No State will       lightly, and without unpleasantness and danger, expose itself       to a just charge of having neglected its international duties;       it will not do so even when it knows that it runs no risk of       war on the part Of neutral States. Every State, even the most       powerful, will gain sensibly in honour with God and man if it       is found to be faithful and sincere in respect and obedience       to the law of nations.        \"Should we be deceiving ourselves if we admitted that a belief       in the law of nations, as in a sacred and necessary authority,       ought to facilitate the enforcement of discipline in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14447"],["title","Letters to \"The Times\" upon War and Neutrality (1881-1920) (#7)"],["body"," Army       and help to prevent many faults and many harmful excesses? I,       for my part, am convinced that the error, which has been       handed down to us from antiquity, according to which all law       is suspended during war, and everything is allowable against       the enemy nation--that this abominable error can but increase       the unavoidable sufferings and evils of war without necessity,       and without utility from the point of view of that energetic       way of making war which I also think is the right way.        \"With reference to several rules being stated with the       qualifications 'if possible,' 'according to circumstances,' we       look on this as a safety-valve, intended to preserve the       inflexible rule of law from giving way when men's minds are       overheated in a struggle against all sorts of dangers, and so       to insure the application of the rules in many other       instances. Sad experience teaches us that in every war there       are numerous violations of law which must unavoidably remain       unpunished, but this will not cause the jurist to abandon the       authoritative principle which has been violated. Quite the       reverse. If, for instance, a flag of truce has been fired       upon, in contravention of the law of nations, the jurist will       uphold and proclaim more strongly than ever the rule that a       flag of truce is inviolable.        \"I trust that your Excellency will receive indulgently this       sincere statement of my views, and will regard it as an       expression of my gratitude, as well as of my high personal       esteem and of my respectful consideration.        \"Dr. BLUNTSCHLI, Privy Councillor, Professor.\"   THE UNITED STATES NAVAL WAR CODE.[1]  Sir,--The \"Naval War Code\" of the United States, upon which an interesting article appeared in _The Times_ of Friday last, in so well deserving of attention in this country that I may perhaps be allowed to supplement the remarks of your Correspondent from the results of a somewhat minute examination of the code made shortly after its publication.  One notes, in the first place, that the Government of the United States does not shirk responsibility. It puts the code into the hands of its officers \"for the government of all persons attached to the naval service,\" and is doubtless prepared to stand by the rules contained in it, as being in accordance with international law. These rules deal boldly with even so disagreeable a topic as \"Reprisals\" (Art. 8), upon which the Brussels, and after it The Hague, Conference preferred to keep silence; and they take a definite line on many questions upon which there are wide differences of opinion. On most debatable points, the rules are in accordance with the views of this country--e.g. as to the right of search (Art. 22), as to the two-fold list of contraband (Arts. 34-36), as to the moment at which the liability of a blockade-runner commences (Art. 44), and as to the capture of private property (Art. 14), although the prohibition of such capture has long been favoured by the Executive of the United States, and was advocated by the American delegates at The Hague Conference. So also Arts. 34-36, by apparently taking for granted the correctness of the rulings of the Supreme Court in the Civil War cases of the _Springbok_ and the _Peterhoff_ with reference to what may be described as \"continuous carriage,\" are in harmony with the views which Lord Salisbury recently had occasion to express as to the trade of the _Bundesrath_ and other German vessels with Lorenzo Marques. It must be observed, on the other hand, that Art. 30 flatly contradicts the British rule as to convoy; while Art. 3 sets out The Hague Declaration as to projectiles dropped from balloons, to which this country is not a party. Art. 7 departs from received views by prohibiting altogether the use of false colours, and Art. 14 (doubtless in pursuance of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the _Paquete Habana_), by affirming the absolute immunity of coast fishing vessels, as such, from capture.  On novel questions the code is equally ready with a solution. It speaks with no uncertain voice on the treatment of mail steamers and mail-bags (Art. 20). On cable-cutting it adopts in Art. 5, as your Correspondent points out, the views which I ventured to maintain in your columns when the question was raised during the war of 1898.[2] I may also, by the way, claim the support of the code for the view taken by me, in a, correspondence also carried on in your columns during the naval manoeuvres of 1888, of the bombardment of open coast towns.[3] Art. 4 sets out substantially the rules upon this subject for which I secured the _imprimatur_ of the Institut de Droit International in 1896.  Secondly, the code is so well brought up to date as to incorporate (Arts. 21-29) the substance of The Hague Convention, ratified only in September last, for applying to maritime warfare the principles of the Convention of Geneva. Art. 10 of The Hague Convention has been reproduced in the code, in forgetfulness perhaps of the fact that that article has not been ratified.  Thirdly, the code contains, very properly, some general provisions applicable equally to warfare upon land (Arts. 1, 3, 8, 12, 54).  Fourthly, it is clearly expressed; and it is brief, consisting of only 54 articles, occupying 22 pages.  Fifthly, it deals with two very distinct topics--viz. the mode of conducting hostilities against the forces of the enemy, and the principles applicable to the making prize of merchant vessels, which as often as not may be the property of neutrals. These topics are by no means kept apart as they might be, articles on prize occurring unexpectedly in the section avowedly devoted to hostilities.  It is worth considering whether something resembling the United States code would not be found useful in the British Navy. Our code might be better arranged than its predecessor, and would differ from it on certain questions, but should resemble it in clearness of expression, in brevity, and, above all things, in frank acceptance of responsibility. What naval men most want is definite guidance, in categorical language, upon those points of maritime international law upon which our Government has made up its own mind.  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, April 8 (1901).  NOTES  - 1: Withdrawn in 1904.  - 2: _Infra_, Ch. VII. Section 6.  - 3: _Infra_, Ch. VI. Section 14.   A NAVAL WAR CODE  Sir,--It is now nearly a year ago since I ventured to suggest in your columns (for April 10, 1901) that something resembling the United States \"Naval War Code,\" dealing with \"the laws and usages of war at sea,\" would be found useful in the British Navy.  The matter is, however, not quite so simple as might be inferred from some of the allusions to it which occurred during last night's debate upon the Navy Estimates. Upon several disputable and delicate questions the Government of the United States has not hesitated to express definite views; and they are not always views which the Government of our own country would be prepared to endorse. For some remarks upon these questions in detail, and upon the code generally, I must refer to my former letter, but may perhaps be allowed to quote its concluding words, which were to the following effect:--        \"Our code might be better arranged than its predecessor, and       would differ from it on certain questions, but should       resemble it in clearness of expression, in brevity, and,       above all things, in frank acceptance of responsibility. What       naval men most want is definite guidance, in categorical       language, upon those points of maritime international law       upon which our Government has made up its own mind.\"  Before issuing such a code our authorities would have to decide--first, what are the classes of topics as to which it is desirable to give definite instructions to naval officers; and, secondly, with reference to topics, to be included in the instructions, as to which there exist international differences of view, what is, in each case, the view by which the British Government is prepared to stand.  I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. E. HOLLAND. Oxford, March 12 (1902).     CHAPTER III  TERMINOLOGY  INTERNATIONAL TERMINOLOGY   Sir,--Demands for the punishment of the ex-Kaiser have produced many \"curiosities of literature,\" sometimes even over the signatures of men deservedly respected as authorities upon subjects which they have made their own; but _ne sutor supra crepidam_. A.B.,[1] for instance, wrote of the Kaiser as guilty of \"an indictable offence.\" X.Y.[1] naturally protests against this misuse of terminology, which is, indeed, far more specifically erroneous than was the popular application, which you allowed me to criticise, of the terms \"murder\" and \"piracy\" to certain detestable acts perpetrated under Government authority.[2] He goes on to give an elaborate, though perhaps hardly necessary, explanation that breaches of that generally accepted body of rules to be followed by States _inter se_, which is known as \"international law,\" can be enforced, in the last resort, only by hostile State action--a fact which he seems to suppose may entitle him to qualify the rules as \"a mockery.\"  X.Y.[1] then proceeds to give an account of the so-called \"private international law\" which surely needs revision for the benefit of any \"man in the street\" who may care to hear about it. X.Y.[1] defines it as \"that part of the law of each separate country, as administered in its own Courts, which deals with international matters,\" and he enumerates as such matters \"prize, contraband, blockade, the rights of ambassadors.\" In fact none of these matters are within the scope of \"private international law,\" but are governed by \"(public) international law,\" non-compliance with which by the Courts or subjects of any State is ground of complaint for the"]]]
