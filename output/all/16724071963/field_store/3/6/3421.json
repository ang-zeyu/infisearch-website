The thread of thought is snapt asunder, All science to me is a stupid blunder. Let us in sensuality's deep Quench the passions within us blazing! And, the veil of sorcery raising, Wake each miracle from its long sleep! Plunge we into the billowy dance, The rush and roll of time and chance! Then may pleasure and distress, Disappointment and success, Follow each other as fast as they will; Man's restless activity flourishes still.  _Mephistopheles_. No bound or goal is set to you; Where'er you like to wander sipping, And catch a tit-bit in your skipping, Eschew all coyness, just fall to, And may you find a good digestion!  _Faust_. Now, once for all, pleasure is not the question. I'm sworn to passion's whirl, the agony of bliss, The lover's hate, the sweets of bitterness. My heart, no more by pride of science driven, Shall open wide to let each sorrow enter, And all the good that to man's race is given, I will enjoy it to my being's centre, Through life's whole range, upward and downward sweeping, Their weal and woe upon my bosom heaping, Thus in my single self their selves all comprehending And with them in a common shipwreck ending.  _Mephistopheles_. O trust me, who since first I fell from heaven, Have chewed this tough meat many a thousand year, No man digests the ancient leaven, No mortal, from the cradle to the bier. Trust one of _us_--the _whole_ creation To God alone belongs by right; _He_ has in endless day his habitation, _Us_ He hath made for utter night, _You_ for alternate dark and light.  _Faust_. But then I _will!_  _Mephistopheles_. Now that's worth hearing! But one thing haunts me, the old song, That time is short and art is long. You need some slight advice, I'm fearing. Take to you one of the poet-feather, Let the gentleman's thought, far-sweeping, Bring all the noblest traits together, On your one crown their honors heaping, The lion's mood The stag's rapidity, The fiery blood of Italy, The Northman's hardihood. Bid him teach thee the art of combining Greatness of soul with fly designing, And how, with warm and youthful passion, To fall in love by plan and fashion. Should like, myself, to come across 'm, Would name him Mr. Microcosm.  _Faust_. What am I then? if that for which my heart Yearns with invincible endeavor, The crown of man, must hang unreached forever?  _Mephistopheles_. Thou art at last--just what thou art. Pile perukes on thy head whose curls cannot be counted, On yard-high buskins let thy feet be mounted, Still thou art only what thou art.  _Faust_. Yes, I have vainly, let me not deny it, Of human learning ransacked all the stores, And when, at last, I set me down in quiet, There gushes up within no new-born force; I am not by a hair's-breadth higher, Am to the Infinite no nigher.  _Mephistopheles_. My worthy sir, you see the matter As people generally see; But we must learn to take things better, Before life pleasures wholly flee. The deuce! thy head and all that's in it, Hands, feet and ------ are thine; What I enjoy with zest each minute, Is surely not the less mine? If I've six horses in my span, Is it not mine, their every power? I fly along as an undoubted man, On four and twenty legs the road I scour. Cheer up, then! let all thinking be, And out into the world with me! I tell thee, friend, a speculating churl Is like a beast, some evil spirit chases Along a barren heath in one perpetual whirl, While round about lie fair, green pasturing places.  _Faust_. But how shall we begin?  _Mephistopheles_. We sally forth e'en now. What martyrdom endurest thou! What kind of life is this to be living, Ennui to thyself and youngsters giving? Let Neighbor Belly that way go! To stay here threshing straw why car'st thou? The best that thou canst think and know To tell the boys not for the whole world dar'st thou. E'en now I hear one in the entry.  _Faust_. I have no heart the youth to see.  _Mephistopheles_. The poor boy waits there like a sentry, He shall not want a word from me. Come, give me, now, thy robe and bonnet; This mask will suit me charmingly.            [_He puts them on_.] Now for my wit--rely upon it! 'Twill take but fifteen minutes, I am sure. Meanwhile prepare thyself to make the pleasant tour!             [_Exit_ FAUST.]  _Mephistopheles [in_ FAUST'S _long gown_]. Only despise all human wit and lore, The highest flights that thought can soar-- Let but the lying spirit blind thee, And with his spells of witchcraft bind thee, Into my snare the victim creeps.-- To him has destiny a spirit given, That unrestrainedly still onward sweeps, To scale the skies long since hath striven, And all earth's pleasures overleaps. He shall through life's wild scenes be driven, And through its flat unmeaningness, I'll make him writhe and stare and stiffen, And midst all sensual excess, His fevered lips, with thirst all parched and riven, Insatiably shall haunt refreshment's brink; And had he not, himself, his soul to Satan given, Still must he to perdition sink!            [_Enter_ A SCHOLAR.]  _Scholar_. I have but lately left my home, And with profound submission come, To hold with one some conversation Whom all men name with veneration.  _Mephistopheles._ Your courtesy greatly flatters me A man like many another you see. Have you made any applications elsewhere?  _Scholar_. Let me, I pray, your teachings share! With all good dispositions I come, A fresh young blood and money some; My mother would hardly hear of my going; But I long to learn here something worth knowing.  _Mephistopheles_. You've come to the very place for it, then.  _Scholar_. Sincerely, could wish I were off again: My soul already has grown quite weary Of walls and halls, so dark and dreary, The narrowness oppresses me. One sees no green thing, not a tree. On the lecture-seats, I know not what ails me, Sight, hearing, thinking, every thing fails me.  _Mephistopheles_. 'Tis all in use, we daily see. The child takes not the mother's breast In the first instance willingly, But soon it feeds itself with zest. So you at wisdom's breast your pleasure Will daily find in growing measure.  _Scholar_. I'll hang upon her neck, a raptured wooer, But only tell me, who shall lead me to her?  _Mephistopheles_. Ere you go further, give your views As to which faculty you choose?  _Scholar_. To be right learn'd I've long desired, And of the natural world aspired To have a perfect comprehension In this and in the heavenly sphere.  _Mephistopheles_. I see you're on the right track here; But you'll have to give undivided attention.  _Scholar_. My heart and soul in the work'll be found; Only, of course, it would give me pleasure, When summer holidays come round, To have for amusement a little leisure.  _Mephistopheles_. Use well the precious time, it flips away so, Yet method gains you time, if I may say so. I counsel you therefore, my worthy friend, The logical leisures first to attend. Then is your mind well trained and cased In Spanish boots,[18] all snugly laced, So that henceforth it can creep ahead On the road of thought with a cautious tread. And not at random shoot and strike, Zig-zagging Jack-o'-lanthorn-like. Then will you many a day be taught That what you once to do had thought Like eating and drinking, extempore, Requires the rule of one, two, three. It is, to be sure, with the fabric of thought, As with the _chef d'uvre_ by weavers wrought, Where a thousand threads one treadle plies, Backward and forward the shuttles keep going, Invisibly the threads keep flowing, One stroke a thousand fastenings ties: Comes the philosopher and cries: I'll show you, it could not be otherwise: The first being so, the second so, The third and fourth must of course be so; And were not the first and second, you see, The third and fourth could never be. The scholars everywhere call this clever, But none have yet become weavers ever. Whoever will know a live thing and expound it, First kills out the spirit it had when he found it, And then the parts are all in his hand, Minus only the spiritual band! Encheiresin naturæ's[19] the chemical name, By which dunces themselves unwittingly shame.  _Scholar_. Cannot entirely comprehend you.  _Mephistopheles_. Better success will shortly attend you, When you learn to analyze all creation And give it a proper classification.  _Scholar_. I feel as confused by all you've said, As if 'twere a mill-wheel going round in my head!  _Mephistopheles_. The next thing most important to mention, Metaphysics will claim your attention! There see that you can clearly explain What fits not into the human brain: For that which will not go into the head, A pompous word will stand you in stead. But, this half-year, at least, observe From regularity never to swerve. You'll have five lectures every day; Be in at the stroke of the bell I pray! And well prepared in every part; Study each paragraph by heart, So that you scarce may need to look To see that he says no more than's in the book; And when he dictates, be at your post, As if you wrote for the Holy Ghost!  _Scholar_. That caution is unnecessary! I know it profits one to write, For what one has in black and white, He to his home can safely carry.  _Mephistopheles_. But choose some faculty, I pray!  _Scholar_. I feel a strong dislike to try the legal college.  _Mephistopheles_. I cannot blame you much, I must acknowledge. I know how this profession stands to-day. Statutes and laws through all the ages Like a transmitted malady you trace; In every generation still it rages And softly creeps from place to place. Reason is nonsense, right an impudent suggestion; Alas for thee, that thou a grandson art! Of inborn law in which each man has part, Of that, unfortunately, there's no question.  _Scholar_. My loathing grows beneath your speech. O happy he whom you shall teach! To try theology I'm almost minded.  _Mephistopheles_. I must not let you by zeal be blinded.

With An Introduction By Henry Morley Ll.d., Professor Of English Literature At University College, London  London George Routledge And Sons  Broadway, Ludgate Hill  New York: 9 Lafayette Place  1884   INTRODUCTION.   Sir Walter Scott's \"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft\" were his contribution to a series of books, published by John Murray, which appeared between the years 1829 and 1847, and formed a collection of eighty volumes known as \"Murray's Family Library.\" The series was planned to secure a wide diffusion of good literature in cheap five-shilling volumes, and Scott's \"Letters,\" written and published in 1830, formed one of the earlier books in the collection.  The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge had been founded in the autumn of 1826, and Charles Knight, who had then conceived a plan of a National Library, was entrusted, in July, 1827, with the superintendence of its publications. Its first treatises appeared in sixpenny numbers, once a fortnight. Its \"British Almanac\" and \"Companion to the Almanac\" first appeared at the beginning of 1829. Charles Knight started also in that year his own \"Library of Entertaining Knowledge.\" John Murray's \"Family Library\" was then begun, and in the spring of 1832--the year of the Reform Bill--the advance of civilization by the diffusion of good literature, through cheap journals as well as cheap books, was sought by the establishment of \"Chambers's Edinburgh Journal\" in the North, and in London of \"The Penny Magazine.\"  In the autumn of that year, 1832, on the 21st of September, Sir Walter Scott died. The first warning of death had come to him in February, 1830, with a stroke of apoplexy. He had been visited by an old friend who brought him memoirs of her father, which he had promised to revise for the press. He seemed for half an hour to be bending over the papers at his desk, and reading them; then he rose, staggered into the drawing-room, and fell, remaining speechless until he had been bled. Dieted for weeks on pulse and water, he so far recovered that to friends outside his family but little change in him was visible. In that condition, in the month after his seizure, he was writing these Letters, and also a fourth series of the \"Tales of a Grandfather.\" The slight softening of the brain found after death had then begun. But the old delight in anecdote and skill in story-telling that, at the beginning of his career, had caused a critic of his \"Border Minstrelsy\" to say that it contained the germs of a hundred romances, yet survived. It gave to Scott's \"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft\" what is for us now a pathetic charm. Here and there some slight confusion of thought or style represents the flickering of a light that flashes yet with its old brilliancy. There is not yet the manifest suggestion of the loss of power that we find presently afterwards in \"Count Robert of Paris\" and \"Castle Dangerous,\" published in 1831 as the Fourth Series of \"Tales of My Landlord,\" with which he closed his life's work at the age of sixty.  Milton has said that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well in laudable things, ought himself to be a true poem. Scott's life was a true poem, of which the music entered into all he wrote. If in his earlier days the consciousness of an unlimited productive power tempted him to make haste to be rich, that he might work out, as founder of a family, an ideal of life touched by his own genius of romance, there was not in his desire for gain one touch of sordid greed, and his ideal of life only brought him closer home to all its duties. Sir Walter Scott's good sense, as Lord Cockburn said, was a more wonderful gift than his genius. When the mistake of a trade connection with James Ballantyne brought ruin to him in 1826, he repudiated bankruptcy, took on himself the burden of a debt of £130,000, and sacrificed his life to the successful endeavour to pay off all. What was left unpaid at his death was cleared afterwards by the success of his annotated edition of his novels. No tale of physical strife in the battlefield could be as heroic as the story of the close of Scott's life, with five years of a death-struggle against adversity, animated by the truest sense of honour. When the ruin was impending he wrote in his diary, \"If things go badly in London, the magic wand of the Unknown will be shivered in his grasp. The feast of fancy will be over with the feeling of independence. He shall no longer have the delight of waking in the morning with bright ideas in his mind, hasten to commit them to paper, and count them monthly, as the means of planting such scaurs and purchasing such wastes; replacing dreams of fiction by other prospective visions of walks by  'Fountain-heads, and pathless groves;  Places which pale passion loves.'  This cannot be; but I may work substantial husbandry--_i.e._ write history, and such concerns.\" It was under pressure of calamity like this that Sir Walter Scott was compelled to make himself known as the author of \"Waverley.\" Closely upon this followed the death of his wife, his thirty years' companion. \"I have been to her room,\" he wrote in May, 1826; \"there was no voice in it--no stirring; the pressure of the coffin was visible on the bed, but it had been removed elsewhere; all was neat as she loved it, but all was calm--calm as death. I remembered the last sight of her: she raised herself in bed, and tried to turn her eyes after me, and said with a sort of smile, 'You have all such melancholy faces.' These were the last words I ever heard her utter, and I hurried away, for she did not seem quite conscious of what she said; when I returned, immediately departing, she was in a deep sleep. It is deeper now. This was but seven days since. They are arranging the chamber of death--that which was long the apartment of connubial happiness, and of whose arrangement (better than in richer houses) she was so proud. They are treading fast and thick. For weeks you could have heard a footfall. Oh, my God!\"  A few years yet of his own battle, while the shadows of night and death were gathering about him, and they were re-united. In these \"Letters upon Demonology and Witchcraft,\" addressed to his son-in-law, written under the first grasp of death, the old kindliness and good sense, joined to the old charm in story-telling, stand firm yet against every assault; and even in the decay that followed, when the powers were broken of the mind that had breathed, and is still breathing, its own health into the minds of tens of thousands of his countrymen, nothing could break the fine spirit of love and honour that was in him. When the end was very near, and the son-in-law to whom these Letters were addressed found him one morning entirely himself, though in the last extreme of feebleness: his eye was clear and calm--every trace of the wild fire of delirium was extinguished: \"Lockhart,\" he said, \"I may have but a minute to speak to you. My dear, be a good man--be virtuous, be religious--be a good man. Nothing else will give you any comfort when you come to lie here.\"  Another volume of this Library may give occasion to recall Scott in the noontide of his strength, companion of  \"The blameless Muse who trains her sons  For hope and calm enjoyment.\"  Here we remember only how from among dark clouds the last light of his genius shone on the path of those who were endeavouring to make the daily bread of intellectual life--good books--common to all.                                                H.M. _February, 1884._   LETTERS  ON  DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT  To J.G. LOCKHART, ESQ.     LETTER I.       Origin of the general Opinions respecting Demonology among     Mankind--The Belief in the Immortality of the Soul is the main     inducement to credit its occasional re-appearance--The Philosophical     Objections to the Apparition of an Abstract Spirit little understood     by the Vulgar and Ignorant--The situations of excited Passion     incident to Humanity, which teach Men to wish or apprehend     Supernatural Apparitions--They are often presented by the Sleeping     Sense--Story of Somnambulism--The Influence of Credulity contagious,     so that Individuals will trust the Evidence of others in despite of     their own Senses--Examples from the \"Historia Verdadera\" of Bernal     Dias del Castillo, and from the Works of Patrick Walker--The     apparent Evidence of Intercourse with the Supernatural World is     sometimes owing to a depraved State of the bodily Organs--Difference     between this Disorder and Insanity, in which the Organs retain their     tone, though that of the Mind is lost--Rebellion of the Senses of a     Lunatic against the current of his Reveries--Narratives of a     contrary Nature, in which the Evidence of the Eyes overbore the     Conviction of the Understanding--Example of a London Man of     Pleasure--Of Nicolai, the German Bookseller and Philosopher--Of a     Patient of Dr. Gregory--Of an Eminent Scottish Lawyer, deceased--Of     this same fallacious Disorder are other instances, which have but     sudden and momentary endurance--Apparition of Maupertuis--Of a late     illustrious modern Poet--The Cases quoted chiefly relating to false     Impressions on the Visual Nerve, those upon the Ear next     considered--Delusions of the Touch chiefly experienced in     Sleep--Delusions of the Taste--And of the Smelling--Sum of the     Argument.   You have asked of me, my dear friend, that I should assist the \"Family Library\" with the history of a dark chapter in human nature, which the increasing civilization of all well-instructed countries has now almost blotted out, though the subject attracted no ordinary degree of consideration in the older times of their history.  Among much reading of my earlier days, it is no doubt true that I travelled a good deal in the twilight regions of superstitious disquisitions."]]]
