[Sidenote: Means _plural_.]  Two words, means and politics, _may be plural_ in their construction with verbs and adjectives:--       Words, by strongly conveying the passions, by _those means_ which      we have already mentioned, fully compensate for their weakness in      other respects.--BURKE.       With great dexterity _these means_ were now applied.--MOTLEY.       By _these means_, I say, riches will accumulate.--GOLDSMITH.

The _politics_ in which he took the keenest interest _were      politics_ scarcely deserving of the name.--MACAULAY.       Now I read all the _politics_ that _come_ out.--GOLDSMITH.   46. Some words have no corresponding singular.    aborigines   amends   annals   assets   antipodes   scissors   thanks   spectacles   vespers   victuals   matins   nuptials   oats   obsequies   premises   bellows   billiards   dregs   gallows   tongs  [Sidenote: _Occasionally singular words_.]  Sometimes, however, a few of these words have the construction of singular nouns. Notice the following:--       They cannot get on without each other any more than one blade of      _a scissors_ can cut without the other.--J.L. LAUGHLIN.

Three words were _originally singular_, the present ending _-s_ not being really a plural inflection, but they are regularly construed as plural: _alms, eaves, riches_.   [Sidenote: _two plurals_.]  48. A few nouns have two plurals differing in meaning.    brother--brothers (by blood), brethren (of a society or church).    cloth--cloths (kinds of cloth), clothes (garments).    die--dies (stamps for coins, etc.), dice (for gaming).    fish--fish (collectively), fishes (individuals or kinds).    genius--geniuses (men of genius), genii (spirits).    index--indexes (to books), indices (signs in algebra).    pea--peas (separately), pease (collectively).    penny--pennies (separately), pence (collectively).    shot--shot (collective balls), shots (number of times fired).  In speaking of coins, _twopence_, _sixpence_, etc., may add _-s_, making a double plural, as two _sixpences_.   [Sidenote: _One plural, two meanings._]  49. Other words have one plural form with two meanings,--one corresponding to the singular, the other unlike it.    custom--customs: (1) habits, ways; (2) revenue duties.    letter--letters: (1) the alphabet, or epistles; (2) literature.    number--numbers: (1) figures; (2) poetry, as in the lines,--       I lisped in _numbers_, for the numbers came.--POPE.       Tell me not, in mournful _numbers_.--LONGFELLOW.  _Numbers_ also means issues, or copies, of a periodical.    pain--pains: (1) suffering; (2) care, trouble,    part--parts: (1) divisions; (2) abilities, faculties.   [Sidenote: _Two classes of compound words._]  50. Compound words may be divided into two classes:--  (1) _Those whose parts are so closely joined as to constitute one word._ These make the last part plural.    courtyard   dormouse   Englishman   fellow-servant   fisherman   Frenchman   forget-me-not   goosequill   handful   mouthful   cupful   maidservant   pianoforte   stepson   spoonful   titmouse  (2) _Those groups in which the first part is the principal one, followed by a word or phrase making a modifier._ The chief member adds _-s_ in the plural.    aid-de-camp   attorney at law   billet-doux   commander in chief   court-martial   cousin-german   father-in-law   knight-errant   hanger-on  NOTE.--Some words ending in _-man_ are not compounds of the English word _man_, but add _-s_; such as _talisman_, _firman_, _Brahman_, _German_, _Norman_, _Mussulman_, _Ottoman_.   51. Some groups pluralize both parts of the group; as _man singer_, _manservant_, _woman servant_, _woman singer_.   [Sidenote: _Two methods in use for names with titles._]  52. As to plurals of names with titles, there is some disagreement among English writers. The title may be plural, as _the Messrs. Allen_, _the Drs. Brown_, _the Misses Rich_; or the name may be pluralized.  The former is perhaps more common in present-day use, though the latter is often found; for example,--       Then came Mr. and Mrs. Briggs, and then _the three Miss      Spinneys_, then Silas Peckham.--DR. HOLMES.       Our immortal Fielding was of the younger branch of the _Earls of      Denbigh_, who drew their origin from the _Counts of      Hapsburgh_.--GIBBON.       The _Miss Flamboroughs_ were reckoned the best dancers in the      parish.--GOLDSMITH.       The _Misses Nettengall's_ young ladies come to the Cathedral      too.--DICKENS.       The _Messrs. Harper_ have done the more than generous thing by      Mr. Du Maurier.--_The Critic_.   53. A number of foreign words have been adopted into English without change of form. These are said to be _domesticated_, and retain their foreign plurals.  Others have been adopted, and by long use have altered their power so as to conform to English words. They are then said to be _naturalized_, or _Anglicized_, or _Englished_.  [Sidenote: _Domesticated words._]  The domesticated words may retain the original plural. Some of them have a secondary English plural in _-s_ or _-es_.   Exercise.  Find in the dictionary the plurals of these words:--  I. FROM THE LATIN.    apparatus   appendix   axis   datum   erratum   focus   formula   genus   larva   medium   memorandum   nebula   radius   series   species   stratum   terminus   vertex  II. FROM THE GREEK.    analysis   antithesis   automaton   basis   crisis   ellipsis   hypothesis   parenthesis   phenomenon   thesis  [Sidenote: _Anglicized words._]  When the foreign words are fully naturalized, they form their plurals in the regular way; as,--    bandits   cherubs   dogmas   encomiums   enigmas   focuses   formulas   geniuses   herbariums   indexes   seraphs   apexes   [Sidenote: _Usage varies in plurals of letters, figures, etc._]  54. Letters, figures, etc., form their plurals by adding _-s_ or _'s_. Words quoted merely as words, without reference to their meaning, also add _-s_ or _'s_; as, \"His _9's_ (or _9s_) look like _7's_ (or _7s_),\" \"Avoid using too many _and's_ (or _ands_),\" \"Change the _+'s_ (or _+s_) to _-'s_ (or _-s_).\"   CASE.   [Sidenote: _Definition._]  55. Case is an inflection or use of a noun (or pronoun) to show its relation to other words in the sentence.  In the sentence, \"He sleeps in a felon's cell,\" the word _felon's_ modifies _cell_, and expresses a relation akin to possession; _cell_ has another relation, helping to express the idea of place with the word _in_.   56. In the general wearing-away of inflections, the number of case forms has been greatly reduced.  [Sidenote: _Only two_ case forms.]  There are now only two case forms of English nouns,--one for the _nominative_ and _objective_, one for the _possessive_: consequently the matter of inflection is a very easy thing to handle in learning about cases.  [Sidenote: _Reasons for speaking of_ three cases _of nouns_.]  But there are reasons why grammars treat of _three_ cases of nouns when there are only two forms:--  (1) Because the relations of all words, whether inflected or not, must be understood for purposes of analysis.  (2) Because pronouns still have three case forms as well as three case relations.   57. Nouns, then, may be said to have three cases,--the nominative, the objective, and the possessive.   I. Uses of the Nominative.  58. The nominative case is used as follows:--  (1) _As the subject of a verb_: \"_Water_ seeks its level.\"  (2) _As a predicate noun_, completing a verb, and referring to or explaining the subject: \"A bent twig makes a crooked _tree_.\"  (3) _In apposition_ with some other nominative word, adding to the meaning of that word: \"The reaper _Death_ with his sickle keen.\"  (4) _In direct address_: \"_Lord Angus_, thou hast lied!\"  (5) _With a participle in an absolute or independent phrase_ (there is some discussion whether this is a true nominative): \"The _work_ done, they returned to their homes.\"  (6) _With an infinitive in exclamations_: \"_David_ to die!\"   Exercise.  Pick out the nouns in the nominative case, and tell which use of the nominative each one has.  1. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief, the enemy of the living.  2.  Excuses are clothes which, when asked unawares,      Good Breeding to naked Necessity spares.  3. Human experience is the great test of truth.  4. Cheerfulness and content are great beautifiers.  5. Three properties belong to wisdom,--nature, learning, and experience; three things characterize man,--person, fate, and merit.  6.  But of all plagues, good Heaven, thy wrath can send,      Save, save, oh save me from the candid friend!  7. Conscience, her first law broken, wounded lies.  8. They charged, sword in hand and visor down.  9.  O sleep! O gentle sleep!      Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee?   II. Uses of the Objective.  59. The objective case is used as follows:--  (1) _As the direct object of a verb_, naming the person or thing directly receiving the action of the verb: \"Woodman, spare that _tree_!\"  (2) _As the indirect object of a verb_, naming the person or thing indirectly affected by the action of the verb: \"Give the _devil_ his due.\"  (3) _Adverbially_, defining the action of a verb by denoting _time_, _measure_, _distance_, etc. (in the older stages of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],["title","An English Grammar (#6)"],["body","uage, this took the regular accusative inflection): \"Full _fathom_ five thy father lies;\" \"Cowards die many _times_ before their deaths.\"  (4) _As the second object_, completing the verb, and thus becoming part of the predicate in acting upon an object: \"Time makes the worst enemies _friends_;\" \"Thou makest the storm a _calm_.\" In these sentences the real predicates are _makes friends_, taking the object _enemies_, and being equivalent to one verb, _reconciles_; and _makest a calm_, taking the object _storm_, and meaning calmest. This is also called the _predicate objective_ or the _factitive object_.  (5) _As the object of a preposition_, the word toward which the preposition points, and which it joins to another word: \"He must have a long spoon that would eat with the _devil_.\"  The preposition sometimes takes the _possessive_ case of a noun, as will be seen in Sec. 68.  (6) _In apposition with another objective_: \"The opinions of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholas Vedder, a _patriarch_ of the village, and _landlord_ of the inn.\"   Exercise.  Point out the nouns in the objective case in these sentences, and tell which use each has:--  1. Tender men sometimes have strong wills.  2. Necessity is the certain connection between cause and effect.  3. Set a high price on your leisure moments; they are sands of precious gold.  4. But the flood came howling one day.  5. I found the urchin Cupid sleeping.  6. Five times every year he was to be exposed in the pillory.  7. The noblest mind the best contentment has.  8. Multitudes came every summer to visit that famous natural curiosity, the Great Stone Face.  9.  And whirling plate, and forfeits paid,      His winter task a pastime made.  10. He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,      And gave the leper to eat and drink.   III. Uses of the Possessive.   60. The possessive case always modifies another word, expressed or understood. There are three forms of possessive showing how a word is related in sense to the modified word:--  (1) _Appositional possessive_, as in these expressions,--       The blind old man of _Scio's_ rocky isle.--BYRON.       Beside a pumice isle in _Baiæ's_ bay.--SHELLEY.  In these sentences the phrases are equivalent to _of the rocky isle [of] Scio_, and _in the bay [of] Baiæ_, the possessive being really equivalent here to an appositional objective. It is a poetic expression, the equivalent phrase being used in prose.  (2) _Objective possessive_, as shown in the sentences,--       Ann Turner had taught her the secret before this last good lady      had been hanged for _Sir Thomas Overbury's_ murder.--HAWTHORNE.       He passes to-day in building an air castle for to-morrow, or in      writing _yesterday's_ elegy.--THACKERAY  In these the possessives are equivalent to an objective after a verbal expression: as, _for murdering Sir Thomas Overbury_; _an elegy to commemorate yesterday_. For this reason the use of the possessive here is called objective.  (3) _Subjective possessive_, the most common of all; as,--       The unwearied sun, from day to day,      Does his Creator's power display.      --ADDISON.  If this were expanded into _the power which his Creator possesses_, the word _Creator_ would be the subject of the verb: hence it is called a subjective possessive.   61. This last-named possessive expresses a variety of relations. _Possession_ in some sense is the most common. The kind of relation may usually be found by expanding the possessive into an equivalent phrase: for example, \"_Winter's_ rude tempests are gathering now\" (i.e., tempests that winter is likely to have); \"His beard was of _several days'_ growth\" (i.e., growth which several days had developed); \"The _forest's_ leaping panther shall yield his spotted hide\" (i.e., the panther which the forest hides); \"Whoso sheddeth _man's_ blood\" (blood that man possesses).   [Sidenote: _How the possessive is formed._]  62. As said before (Sec. 56), there are only two case forms. One is the simple form of a word, expressing the relations of nominative and objective; the other is formed by adding _'s_ to the simple form, making the possessive singular. To form the possessive plural, only the apostrophe is added if the plural nominative ends in _-s_; the _'s_ is added if the plural nominative does not end in _-s_.   Case Inflection.   [Sidenote: _Declension or inflection of nouns._]  63. The full declension of nouns is as follows:--                            SINGULAR.     PLURAL.  1. _Nom. and Obj._   lady          ladies    _Poss._           lady's        ladies'  2. _Nom. and Obj._   child         children    _Poss._           child's       children's  [Sidenote: _A suggestion._]  NOTE.--The difficulty that some students have in writing the possessive plural would be lessened if they would remember there are two steps to be taken:--  (1) Form the nominative plural according to Secs 39-53  (2) Follow the rule given in Sec. 62.   Special Remarks on the Possessive Case.   [Sidenote: _Origin of the possessive with its apostrophe._]  64. In Old English a large number of words had in the genitive case singular the ending _-es_; in Middle English still more words took this ending: for example, in Chaucer, \"From every _schires_ ende,\" \"Full worthi was he in his _lordes_ werre [war],\" \"at his _beddes_ syde,\" \"_mannes_ herte [heart],\" etc.  [Sidenote: _A false theory._]  By the end of the seventeenth century the present way of indicating the possessive had become general. The use of the apostrophe, however, was not then regarded as standing for the omitted vowel of the genitive (as _lord's_ for _lordes_): by a false theory the ending was thought to be a contraction of _his_, as schoolboys sometimes write, \"George Jones _his_ book.\"  [Sidenote: _Use of the apostrophe._]  Though this opinion was untrue, the apostrophe has proved a great convenience, since otherwise words with a plural in _-s_ would have three forms alike. To the eye all the forms are now distinct, but to the ear all may be alike, and the connection must tell us what form is intended.  The use of the apostrophe in the plural also began in the seventeenth century, from thinking that _s_ was not a possessive sign, and from a desire to have distinct forms.   [Sidenote: _Sometimes_ s _is left out in the possessive singular._]  65. Occasionally the _s_ is dropped in the possessive singular if the word ends in a hissing sound and another hissing sound follows, but the apostrophe remains to mark the possessive; as, _for goodness' sake, Cervantes' satirical work_.  In other cases the _s_ is seldom omitted. Notice these three examples from Thackeray's writings: \"Harry ran upstairs to his _mistress's_ apartment;\" \"A postscript is added, as by the _countess's_ command;\" \"I saw what the _governess's_ views were of the matter.\"   [Sidenote: _Possessive with compound expressions._]  66. In compound expressions, containing words in apposition, a word with a phrase, etc., the possessive sign is usually last, though instances are found with both appositional words marked.  Compare the following examples of literary usage:--       Do not the Miss Prys, my neighbors, know the amount of my income,      the items of my _son's_, _Captain Scrapegrace's_, tailor's      bill--THACKERAY.       The world's pomp and power sits there on this hand: on that,      stands up for God's truth one man, the _poor miner Hans Luther's_      son.--CARLYLE.       They invited me in the _emperor their master's_ name.--SWIFT.       I had naturally possessed myself of _Richardson the painter's_      thick octavo volumes of notes on the \"Paradise Lost.\"--DE      QUINCEY.       They will go to Sunday schools to teach classes of little      children the age of Methuselah or the dimensions of _Og the king      of Bashan's_ bedstead.--HOLMES.  More common still is the practice of turning the possessive into an equivalent phrase; as, _in the name of the emperor their master_, instead of _the emperor their master's name_.   [Sidenote: _Possessive and no noun limited._]  67. The possessive is sometimes used without belonging to any noun in the sentence; some such word as _house_, _store_, _church_, _dwelling_, etc., being understood with it: for example,--       Here at the _fruiterer's_ the Madonna has a tabernacle of fresh      laurel leaves.--RUSKIN.       It is very common for people to say that they are disappointed in      the first sight of _St. Peter's_.--LOWELL.       I remember him in his cradle at _St. James's_.--THACKERAY.       Kate saw that; and she walked off from the _don's_.--DE QUINCEY.   [Sidenote: _The double possessive._]  68. A peculiar form, a double possessive, has grown up and become a fixed idiom in modern English.  In most cases, a possessive relation was expressed in Old English by the inflection _-es_, corresponding to _'s_. The same relation was expressed in French by a phrase corresponding to _of_ and its object. Both of these are now used side by side; sometimes they are used together, as one modifier, making a double possessive. For this there are several reasons:--  [Sidenote: _Its advantages: Euphony_.]  (1) When a word is modified by _a_, _the_, _this_, _that_, _every_, _no_, _any_, _each_, etc., and at the same time by a possessive noun, it is distasteful to place the possessive before the modified noun, and it would also alter the meaning: we place it after the modified noun with _of_.  [Sidenote: _Emphasis._]  (2) It is more emphatic than the simple possessive, especially when used with _this_ or _that_, for it brings out the modified word in strong relief.  [Sidenote: _Clearness._]  (3) It prevents ambiguity. For example, in such a sentence as, \"This introduction _of Atterbury's_ has all these advantages\" (Dr. Blair), the statement clearly means only one thing,--the introduction which Atterbury made. If, however, we use the phrase _of Atterbury_, the sentence _might_ be understood as just explained, or it might mean this act"]]]
