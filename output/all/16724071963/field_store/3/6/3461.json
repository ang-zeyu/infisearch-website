But I have no objection to making sure, and would as soon ride in that direction as any other.\"  Nothing from Edward was found at the office; and the young wife seemed much disappointed, till Ella suggested that that looked as if he expected to be at home before night.  It was a cheering idea to Zoe: she brightened up at once, and in the afternoon drove over the same road, feeling almost certain Edward would be on the incoming train, due about the time she would reach the village, or rather at the time she had planned to be there. Ella, who had asked to accompany her, was slow with her dressing, taxing Zoe's patience pretty severely by thus causing ten minutes' detention.  \"Come, now, don't be worried: it won't kill Ned to have to wait ten or fifteen minutes,\" she said laughingly, as she stepped into the carriage, and seated herself by Zoe's side.  \"No, I dare say not,\" returned the latter, trying to speak with perfect pleasantness of tone and manner; \"and he isn't one of the impatient ones, who can never bear to be kept waiting a minute, like myself,\" she added with a smile. \"Now, Uncle Ben, drive pretty fast, so that we won't be so very far behind time.\"  \"Fas' as I kin widout damagin' de hosses, Miss Zoe,\" answered the old coachman. \"Marso Ed'ard allus tole me be keerful ob dem, and de roads am putty bad sence de big storm.\"  Zoe glanced at her watch as they entered the village. \"Drive directly to the depot, Uncle Ben,\" she said. \"It's fully fifteen minutes past the time for the train to be in.\"  \"I ain't heard de whistle, Miss Zoe,\" he remarked, as he turned his horses' heads in the desired direction.  \"No, nor have I,\" said Ella; \"and we ought to have heard it fully five minutes before it got in. There may have been a detention. That is nothing very unusual,\" she hastened to add, as she saw that Zoe had suddenly grown very pale.  The carriage drew up before the door of the depot; and the girls leaned from its windows, sending eager, searching glances from side to side, and up and down the track.  No train was in sight, and the depot seemed strangely silent and deserted.  \"Oh!\" cried Zoe, \"what can be the matter?\"  \"I suppose the train must have got in some time ago,--perhaps before we left Ion,\" replied Ella, in a re-assuring tone; \"and all the passengers have dispersed to their homes, or wherever they were going.\"  \"No, there could not have been time for all that,\" Zoe responded, in accents full of anxiety and alarm.  \"Our watches may be much too slow,\" suggested Ella, trying to re-assure both herself and her cousin, yet trembling with apprehension as she spoke.  \"No, it isn't possible that they and all the timepieces in the house could be so far from correct,\" said Zoe despairingly.  \"Dar doan' 'pear to be nobody 'bout dis hyar depot,\" remarked Uncle Ben reflectively; \"but I reckon dar's somebody comin' to 'splain de mattah. Wha's de 'casion ob dis mos' onusual state ob t'ings?\" he added, as a woman, who been watching the carriage and its occupants, the open door of a neighboring house, came miming in their direction.  \"What de mattah, Aunt Rhoda?\" he queried, as she reached the side of the vehicle, almost breathless with excitement and exertion.  \"Why, Uncle Ben, dar--dar's been a accident to de kyars, dey say, an' dey's all broke up, and de folks roun' here is all\"--  \"Where? where?\" exclaimed Ella, while Zoe sank back against the cushions, quite unable to speak for the moment.  \"Dunno, Miss,\" was the reply; \"but,\" pointing up the road, \"it's out dat way, 'bout a mile, I reckon. Yo see, de kyars was a comin' fas' dis way, and 'nudder ole injine whiskin' 'long dat way, and dey bofe comes togedder wid a big crash, breakin' de kyars, and de injines bofe of em, till dey's good for nuffin' but kin'lin' wood; and de folks what's ridin' in de kyars is all broke up too, dey says; and de doctahs and body\"--  \"Edward!\" gasped Zoe. \"Drive us there, Uncle Ben, drive with all your might! O Edward, my husband, my husband!\" and she burst into hysterical weeping.  Ella threw her arms about her. \"Don't, dear Zoe, oh, don't cry so! He may not be hurt. He may not have been on that train at all.\"  Ben had already turned and whipped up his horses, and now they dashed along the road at a furious rate.  Zoe dropped her head on Ella's shoulder, answering only with tears and sobs and moans, till the carriage came to a sudden stand-still.  \"We's got dar, Miss Zoe,\" said Uncle Ben, in a subdued tone full of grief and sympathy.  She lifted her head; and her eye instantly fell upon a little group, scarcely a yard distant, consisting of several men, among whom she recognized Dr. Conly, gathered about an apparently insensible form lying on the ground.  Ella and Ben saw it too. She suddenly caught the reins from his hands: he sprang from the carriage, and, lifting Zoe in his strong arms as if she had been but a child, set her on her feet, and supported her to the side of the prostrate man; the little crowd respectfully making way for her, at the words spoken by Ben in a voice half choked with emotion, \"Hit's Marse Ed'ard's wife, gen'lemen.\"  It was Edward lying there motionless, and with a face like that of a corpse.  With an agonized cry, Zoe dropped on her knees at his side, and pressed her lips passionately to his.  There was no response, no movement, not the quiver of an eyelid; and she lifted her grief-stricken face to that of the doctor, with a look of anguished inquiry in the beautiful eyes fit to move a heart of stone.  \"I do not despair of him yet, dear cousin Zoe,\" Arthur said in a low, moved tone. \"I lave found no external injury, and it may be that he is only stunned.\"  The words had scarcely left his lips when Edward drew a sighing breath, and opened his eyes, glancing up into Zoe's face bending over Mm in deepest, tenderest solicitude.  \"Ah, love! is it you?\" he murmured faintly, and with a smile. \"Where am I? What has happened?\"  \"O Ned! dear, _dear_ Ned! I thought you were killed!\" she sobbed, covering his face with kisses and tears.  \"There has been an accident, and you got a blow that stunned you,\" answered the doctor; \"but I think you are all right now, or will be soon.\"  \"An accident!\" Edward repeated, with a bewildered look, and putting his hand to his head. \"What was it?\"  \"A collision on the railroad,\" Arthur said. \"There is an ambulance here: I think I will put you in it, and have you taken home at once. 'Tis only a few miles, and not a rough road.\"  \"Yes, yes: home is much the best place,\" he sighed, again putting his hand to his head.  \"Are you in pain?\" asked Arthur.  \"Not much, but I feel strangely confused. I should like to be taken home as soon as possible. But not to the neglect of any one who may have been more seriously hurt than I,\" he added, feebly raising his head to look about him.  \"There are none such,\" Arthur answered. \"You perhaps remember that the cars were nearly empty of passengers: no lives were lost and no one, I think, worse hurt than yourself.\"  \"And I?\" returned Edward, in a tone of inquiry.  \"Have escaped without any broken bones, and I trust will be all right in a few days.\"  \"O Ned! how glad I am it is no worse!\" sobbed Zoe, clinging to his hand, while the tears rolled fast down her cheeks.  \"Yes, little wife,\" he said, gazing lovingly into her eyes.  \"There, I positively forbid any more talking,\" said Arthur, with a mixture of authority and playfulness. \"Here is the ambulance. Help me to lift him in, men,\" to the by-standers. \"And you, cousin Zoe, get into your carriage, and drive on behind it, or ahead if you choose.\"  \"Can't I ride in the ambulance beside him?\" she asked, almost imploringly.  \"No, no: you will both be more comfortable In doing as I have directed.\"  \"Then, please go with him yourself,\" she entreated.  \"I shall do so, certainly,\" he answered, motioning her away, then stooping to assist the others in lifting the injured man.  Zoe would not stir till she had seen Edward put into the ambulance, and made as comfortable for his ride home as circumstances would permit. Then, as the vehicle moved slowly off, she hurried to her carriage.  Ben helped her in, sprang into his own seat, and, as he took the reins from Ella, Zoe gave the order, \"Home now, Uncle Ben, keeping as close behind the ambulance as you can.\"  \"Oh, don't, Zoe! you oughtn't to!\" expostulated Ella, perceiving that her cousin was crying violently behind her veil. \"I don't think Ned is very badly hurt. Didn't you hear Arthur say so?\"  \"He only expressed such a hope: he didn't say certainly,\" sobbed Zoe. \"And when people are in danger, doctors always try to hide it from their friends.\"  \"Arthur is perfectly truthful,\" asserted Ella, with some warmth. \"He may keep his opinions to himself at times, but he never builds people up with false hopes. So cheer up, coz,\" she added, squeezing Zoe's hand affectionately.  \"I know that what you say of cousin Arthur is all true,\" sobbed Zoe; \"but I could see he had fears as well as hopes: and--and--Ned doesn't seem a bit like himself; he has such a dazed look, as if not quite in his right mind.\"  \"But he knew you and Art; and it is to be expected that a man would feel dazed after such a shock as he must have had.\"  \"Yes, of course. Oh, I'm afraid he's dreadfully, dreadfully hurt, and will never get over it!\"  \"Still,\" returned Ella, \"try to hope for the best. Don't you think that is the wiser plan always?\"  \"I suppose so,\" said Zoe, laughing and crying hysterically; \"but I can't be wise to-night; indeed, I never can.\"     CHAPTER VI.  \"And, if division come, it soon is past, Too sharp, too strange an agony to last.\" MRS. NORTON.   Christine and Aunt Phillis, who had been left in charge of Miss Deane, had had a sore trial of patience in waiting upon her, humoring her whims, listening to her fretting and complaints, and trying to soothe and entertain her. She was extremely irritable,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14488"],["title","Elsie's Kith and Kin (#8)"],["body"," and seemed determined not to be pleased with any thing they could do for her.  \"Where is your mistress?\" she asked at length. \"Pretty manners she has, to leave a suffering guest to the sole care of servants.\"  \"Yes, Miss, Ise alluz t'ought Miss Zoe hab pretty manners and a pretty face,\" replied Aunt Phillis; \"but dere is ladies what habn't none, an' doan' git pleased wid nuffin' nor nobody, an eayn't stan' no misery nowhars 'bout deirselves, but jes' keep frettin' and concessantly displainin' 'bout dis t'ing and dat, like dey hasn't got nuffin' to be thankful for.\"  \"Impudence!\" muttered Miss Deane, her eyes flashing angrily. Then bidding her attendants be quiet, she settled herself for a nap.  She was waked by a slight bustle in the house, accompanied by sounds as if a number of men were carrying a heavy burden through the entrance-hall, and up the wide stairway leading to the second story.  \"What's the matter? What's going on? Has any thing happened?\" she asked, starting up to a sitting posture.  Christine had risen to her feet, pale and trembling, and stood listening intently.  \"I must go and see,\" she said, and hurried from the room, Aunt Phillis shambling after her in haste and trepidation.  \"Stay!\" cried Miss Deane: \"don't leave me alone. What are you thinking of?\"  But they were already out of hearing. \"I was never so shamefully treated anywhere as I am here,\" muttered the angry lady, sinking back upon her pillows. \"I'll leave this house to-morrow, if it is a possible thing, and never darken its doors again.\"  Listening again, she thought she heard sounds of grief, sobbing and wailing, groans and sighs.  She was by no means deficient in curiosity, and it was exceedingly trying to be compelled to lie there in doubt and suspense.  The time seemed very much longer than it really was before Aunt Phillis came back, sobbing, and wiping her eyes on her apron.  \"What is the matter?\" asked Miss Deane impatiently.  \"Dere's--dere's been a awful commission on de railroad,\" sobbed Aunt Phillis; \"and Marse Ed'ard's 'most killed.\"  \"Oh, dreadful!\" cried Miss Deane. \"Have they sent for his mother?\"  Aunt Phillis only shook her head doubtfully, and burst into fresh and louder sobs.  \"Most killed! Dear me!\" sighed the lady. \"And he was so young and handsome! It will quite break his mother's heart, I suppose. But she'll get over it. It takes a vast deal of grief to kill.\"  \"P'raps Marse Ed'ard ain't gwine ter die,\" said the old nurse, checking her sobs. \"Dey does say Doctah Arthur kin 'most raise de dead.\"  \"Well, I'm sure I hope Mr. Travilla won't die,\" responded Miss Deane, \"or prove to be permanently injured in any way.--Ah, Christine!\" as the latter re-entered the room: \"what is all this story about a railroad accident? Is Mr. Travilla killed?\"  \"No, no, he not killed,\" replied Christine, in her broken English. \"How bad hurt, I not know to say; but not killed.\"  Meantime Edward had been taken to his room, and put comfortably to bed; while Zoe, seated in her boudoir, waited anxiously for the doctor's report of his condition.  Ella was with her, and now and then tried to speak a comforting word, which Zoe scarcely seemed to hear. She sat with her hands clasped in her lap, listening intently to catch every sound from the room where her injured husband lay. She looked pale and anxious, and occasionally a tear would roll quickly down her cheek.  At last the door opened, and Arthur stepped softly across the room to her side.  \"Cheer up, little cousin,\" he said kindly. \"Edward seems to be doing very well; and if you will be a good, quiet little woman, you may go and sit by his side.\"  \"Oh, thank you! I'll try,\" she said, starting up at once. \"But mayn't I talk to him at all?\"  \"Not much to-night,\" was the reply; \"not more than seems absolutely necessary; and you must be particularly careful not to say any thing that would have the least tendency to excite him.\"  \"Oh, then he must be very, very ill,--terribly injured!\" she cried, with a burst of tears and sobs.  \"That does not necessarily follow,\" Arthur said, taking her hand, and holding it in a kindly pressure. \"But you must be more composed, or,\" playfully, \"I shall be compelled to exert my authority so far as to forbid you to go to him.\"  \"Oh, no, no! don't do that!\" she cried pleadingly. \"I'll be calm and quiet; indeed, indeed I will.\"  \"That's right,\" he said. \"I think I may venture to try you.\"  \"But won't you please tell me just how much you think he is hurt?\" she pleaded, clinging to his hand, and looking up beseechingly into his face.  \"My dear little cousin,\" he said in a tenderly sympathizing tone, \"I wish to do all in my power to relieve your anxiety, but am as yet in some doubt myself as to the extent of his injuries. He is a good deal shaken and bruised; but, as I have said before, there are no broken bones; and, unless there should be some internal injury which I have not yet discovered, he is likely to recover entirely in a few days or weeks.\"  \"But you are not sure? Oh! how could I ever bear it if he should\"--she broke off with a burst of violent weeping.  He led her to a seat, for she seemed hardly able to stand: her whole frame was shaking with emotion.  \"Try not to meet trouble half way, little cousin,\" he said gently. \"'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,' and 'As thy days, so shall thy strength be.' It is God's promise to all who put their trust in him, and cannot fail; all his promises are yea and amen in Christ Jesus.\"  \"Yes, I know,\" she said, making a strong effort to control herself. \"And you do hope Ned will soon be well?\"  \"I certainly do,\" he responded in cheerful accents. \"And now, if you will wipe away your tears, and promise to be very good and quiet, I will take you to him. He was asking for you when I left the room.\"  She gave the desired promise, and he led her to the bedside.  \"I have brought you your wife, Ned,\" he said in a quiet tone, \"and mean to leave her with you for a while; but you are to be a good boy, and not indulge in much chatter with her.\"  \"We'll be good: I'll answer for her, and myself too,\" Edward returned, with a tenderly affectionate smile up into Zoe's face, as she bent over him, and touched her lips to his forehead.  She dared not trust herself to speak, but silently put her hand in his, dropped on her knees by the bedside, and laid her pretty head on the pillow on which his rested.  \"My own darling!\" he murmured, softly pressing the hand he held: \"my own precious little wife!\"  Once more Arthur enjoined quiet, then went out, and left them alone together.  He paid a professional visit to Miss Deane, satisfied her curiosity in regard to Edward's injuries, and learned with pleasure that she was quite resolved to go home the next morning.  \"Of course Mrs. Travilla should give all her attention to her husband now,\" she remarked; \"and I shall be only in the way. One disabled person is quite enough to have in a house at one time. So if you, doctor, will be so kind as to have the ambulance sent out for me directly after breakfast, I'll be much obliged.\"  \"I will do so,\" he said. \"The journey will do you no harm, and you will probably be better cared for and happier in your own home than here, under the circumstances.\"  Zoe's poor heart was longing to pour itself out into her husband's ear in words of contrition, penitence, and love; and only the fear of injuring him enabled her to restrain her feelings, and remain calm and quiet, kneeling there close by his side, with her hand in his. She couldn't rest till she told him how very, very sorry she was for the petulance of the past few days, and especially for the cold rejection of his invitation to accompany him on his drive to Roselands, how firmly resolved never again to give him like cause to be displeased with her, and how dearly she loved him.  But she must refrain, from fear of exciting him: she must wait till all danger from that was past.  It was hard; yet there was strong consolation in the certainty that his dear love was still hers. She read it in his eyes, as they gazed fondly into hers; felt it in the tender pressure of his hand; heard it in the tones of his voice, as he called her his \"darling, his own precious little wife.\"  Yet she was tormented with the fear that his accident had affected his mind and memory for the time, so that he had forgotten the unkindness of the morning; and that, when returning health and vigor should recall the facts to his remembrance, he would again treat her with the coldness and displeasure merited by her behavior.  \"But,\" she comforted herself, \"if he does, it will not last long: he is sure to forgive and love me as soon as I tell him how sorry I am.\"  She did not want to leave him to take either food or rest; but Arthur insisted that she should go down to tea, and later to bed, leaving Edward in his care; and she finally yielded to his persuasions, and exertion of medical authority.  She objected that it was quite useless to go to bed; she was positively sure she could not sleep a wink: but her head had scarcely touched the pillow before she fell into a profound slumber, for she was quite worn out with anxiety and grief.  It was broad daylight when she woke. The events of yesterday flashed instantly upon her mind; and she sprang from her bed and began dressing in haste.  She must learn as speedily as possible how Edward was; not worse, surely, for Arthur had promised faithfully to call her at once if there should be any unfavorable change during the night. Still, a light tap at the door made her start, and turn pale; and she opened it with a trembling hand.  Ella stood there with a bright, smiling countenance. \"Good-morning, coz,\" she said gayly. \"I bring you good news,--two pieces of it. Ned is almost himself again; Arthur is entirely satisfied that there is no serious injury,--internal or otherwise; and Miss Deane has already set out for her home, leaving me to give you her adieus. Now are you not happy?\"  \"Indeed,"]]]
