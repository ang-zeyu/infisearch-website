They said he was always roving about, robbing Farmer Green of his corn and his chickens, and digging up the potatoes when they shot their sprouts above the surface of the potato-patch. And everybody was aware that the old gentleman stole eggs from the nests of his smaller neighbors. It was even whispered that Mr. Crow had been known to devour baby robins.  But perhaps some of the things said of him were not true. Though if he really was an outlaw he seemed to enjoy being one. He usually laughed whenever Johnnie Green or his father tried to catch him, or when they attempted to frighten him. And on the whole he was quite the boldest, noisiest, and most impertinent of all the creatures that lived in Pleasant Valley.  His house stood in a tall elm, not too far from the cornfield. And those that dwelt near him never could complain that the neighborhood was quiet.... It was never quiet where old Mr. Crow was.  Many of the smaller birds feared him. But they couldn't help laughing at him sometimes--he was so droll, with his solemn face, his sedate walk, and his comical gestures. As for his voice, it was loud and harsh. And those that heard too much of it often wished that he would use it less.  Mr. Crow's best friends sometimes remarked that people did not understand him. They said that he helped Farmer Green more than he injured him, for he did a great deal in the way of eating beetles, cutworms and grasshoppers, as well as many other insects that tried to destroy Farmer Green's crops. So you see he had his good points, as well as his bad ones.  For a number of years Mr. Crow had spent each summer in Pleasant Valley, under the shadow of Blue Mountain. He usually arrived from the South in March and left in October. And though many of his friends stayed in the North and braved the winter's cold and storms, old Mr. Crow was too fond of a good meal to risk going hungry after the snow lay deep upon the ground. At that season, such of his neighbors as remained behind often dined upon dried berries, which they found clinging to the trees and bushes. But so long as Mr. Crow could go where it was warmer, and find sea food along the shore, he would not listen to his friends' pleas that he spend the winter with them.  \"Until I can no longer travel 'as the crow flies,' I shall not spend a winter here,\" he would say to them with a solemn wink. That was one of his favorite jokes. He had heard that when anybody asked Farmer Green how far it was to the village he always answered, \"It's nine miles as the crow flies\"--meaning that it was nine miles in a straight line.  Old Mr. Crow thought that the saying was very funny. But then, he usually laughed at Farmer Green, no matter what he said or did.  You can see that Mr. Crow was no respecter of persons.     II  SOMETHING LOST   It may seem a strange thing for old Mr. Crow to have had no other name--such as John, or James, or Josephus. But that was the way he preferred it to be. Indeed, his parents had given him another name, years before. But Mr. Crow did not like it. And after he grew up he dropped the name. To tell the truth, the reason for his coming to Pleasant Valley, in the beginning, was because no one knew him there. And though his new friends thought it odd that he should be called simply \"Mr. Crow,\" he was satisfied.  Of course, that was when he was younger. As the years passed he became known as \"old Mr. Crow.\" But no one called him that except behind his back. And since he knew nothing of that, it never annoyed him in the least.  Now, Mr. Crow had spent a good many pleasant seasons in Pleasant Valley. And nobody had ever found out much about him. But at last there came a day when he was very much upset. He was roaming through the woods on a sunny afternoon when someone called to him.  He stopped. And presently a person in a bright blue coat came hurrying up. It was a noisy fellow known as Jasper Jay, who was new in the neighborhood.  \"I thought I recognized you,\" he shouted to Mr. Crow. \"As soon as I saw you fly past I said to myself, 'That looks like Cousin--'\"  Mr. Crow stopped him just in time. It was true that the two were cousins. One look at their big feet and their big bills would have told you that.  Now, Mr. Crow sometimes saw Jasper on the trips he made each fall and spring. And Jasper knew Mr. Crow's name. He had almost said it, too, at the top of his boisterous voice.  \"What's the matter?\" Jasper Jay inquired, for Mr. Crow was looking all around. \"Have you lost anything?\"  \"Yes!\" said Mr. Crow. \"I've lost my name. And I don't want to find it again, either.\"  What he was really doing was this: He was peering about to see whether anybody might be listening.  Jasper Jay's mouth fell open--he was so astonished.  \"Why, what do you mean, Cousin--\"  Mr. Crow stopped him again.  \"Don't call me that!\" he said severely. \"I'm known here as 'Mr. Crow.' And I'll thank you to call me by that name and no other.\"  That astonished Jasper Jay all the more, because he had never known Mr. Crow to thank anybody for anything.  \"Well, well!\" he murmured faintly. And then it was Mr. Crow's turn to be surprised, for he had never before heard his cousin Jasper speak in anything but the loudest scream.  Then Mr. Crow explained that he had never liked the name his parents had given him and that he wanted nobody in Pleasant Valley to learn what it was.  \"You must promise me,\" said Mr. Crow--and there was a dangerous glitter in his eye--\"you must promise me that you'll never speak my name again.\"  \"Why, certainly!\" Jasper Jay replied. \"I'm glad to oblige you, I'm sure. And I promise that I'll never, never, never again mention your name aloud, Cousin Jim.\"  There! The secret is out! Jasper Jay said Mr. Crow's name without once thinking what he was about. And Mr. Crow was so angry that he gave his cousin a sound beating, on the spot.  \"I'll teach you,\" he said, \"to do as you're told!\" And he did. For after that Jasper Jay always remembered that to him, as to everybody else, his big black cousin must be known only as \"Mr. Crow.\"  You see, \"Jim Crow\" was a name that Mr. Crow could not abide. The mere sound of it made him wince. And he was not a person of tender feelings, either.     III  THE GIANT SCARECROW   Farmer Green always claimed that Mr. Crow was a ruffian and a robber.  \"That old chap has been coming here every summer for years,\" he said to his son Johnnie one day. \"I always know him when I see him, because he's the biggest of all the crows that steal my corn.\"  That was Farmer Green's way of looking at a certain matter. But old Mr. Crow regarded it otherwise. He knew well enough what Farmer Green thought of his trick of digging up the newly planted corn. And his own idea and Farmer Green's did not agree at all.  Now, this matter was something that old Mr. Crow never mentioned unless somebody else spoke of it first. And then Mr. Crow would shake his head slowly, and sigh, and say:  \"It's strange that Farmer Green doesn't understand how much I help him. I'm as busy as I can be all summer long, destroying insects that injure his crops. And since I help Farmer Green to raise his corn, I'm sure I have as good a right to a share of it as the horses that plough the field, or the men that hoe it. Farmer Green gives them corn to eat. But he never once thinks of giving me any.\"  You see, there are always two sides to every question. And that was Mr. Crow's. But Farmer Green never knew how Mr. Crow felt about the matter. And every spring, at corn-planting time, he used to set up scarecrows in his cornfield, hoping that they would frighten the crows away.  And so they did. At least, some of the younger crows were afraid of those straw-stuffed dummies, with their hats tipped over their faces, or upon one side, and their empty sleeves flapping in the winds that swept through the valley. But old Mr. Crow was too wise to be fooled so easily. He would scratch up the corn at the very feet of a scarecrow--and chuckle at the same time.  It must not be supposed that Farmer Green did not know what was going on. He often caught sight of Mr. Crow in the cornfield. But it always happened that Mr. Crow saw him too. And Farmer Green could never get near the old rogue.  At last Johnnie Green's father spent a whole evening trying to think of some way in which to outwit Mr. Crow. And by bedtime he had hit upon a plan that he liked.  The next day, with Johnnie to help him, he set to work to build a monster scarecrow. It was twice as high as the tallest man that was ever seen. And for a hat Farmer Green set on its straw head a huge tin pan, which glittered when the sun shone upon it.  \"That'll fix him!\" said Farmer Green, as he stood off and looked at the giant. And as for his son Johnnie, he danced up and down and shouted--he was so pleased.  But Mr. Crow was not pleased when he flew toward the cornfield the next day and saw the great figure of a man there, with a terrible glittering helmet upon his head. And Mr. Crow noticed something upon the giant's shoulder that looked very like a gun.  The old gentleman swerved quickly to one side and never stopped his flight until he had reached the woods.  And "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14402"],["title","The Tale of Old Mr. Crow (#1)"],["body","night Farmer Green felt quite merry.  \"I've scared that old crow away at last,\" he said.     IV  CAUGHT NAPPING   It was several days before Mr. Crow stopped sulking. He was very angry with Farmer Green for placing the giant in the cornfield. And he told his friends that he had about made up his mind he would move to some other neighborhood.  \"Farmer Green will be sorry after I'm gone,\" he remarked. \"He'll miss me when he finds that his crops are being eaten by mildreds of insects.\" Whether he meant _millions_ or _hundreds_ it would be hard to say. You see, Mr. Crow was not good at arithmetic. He always had trouble counting higher than ten.  And then, the very day before he had planned to move, Mr. Crow noticed something that made him change his mind. He was sitting in the top of a tall pine, looking mournfully across the cornfield, where he dared not go, when he saw a small bird drop down upon the giant's head and disappear.  \"He's eaten her!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. But as he stared, the little bird appeared again and flew away.  Old Mr. Crow knew it was a mother wren; and he was not long in discovering that she had built a nest under the tin pan that the giant wore in place of a hat!  That was enough for Mr. Crow. The secret was out! The thing he had feared was nothing worse than a straw scarecrow, with a stick stuck over its shoulder to look like a gun.  The old gentleman felt quite foolish for a time. But he did not let that fact prevent his scratching up enough corn to make up for the meals he had lost.  After that he quickly recovered his spirits. And he forgot all about moving.  But if Mr. Crow felt merry, you may be sure that Farmer Green did not. It was his turn to feel foolish. And he vowed that he would get even with Mr. Crow, if it took him all summer.  Meanwhile, Mr. Crow grew careless. He really thought that Farmer Green wouldn't be able to think of any other way of keeping him out of the cornfield. And he spent so much of his time there that he grew quite fat. He became somewhat short-breathed, too. And his voice grew wheezier than ever. But Mr. Crow did not mind those things. He was getting all the corn he could eat. And he was happy.  Then there came a morning at last, as he soared down upon the cornfield, when he noticed that the huge scarecrow was gone. There was another--a shorter--figure in its place. But to careless Mr. Crow's glance it seemed no different from the scarecrows he had known all his life. He paid little or no attention to the image. It wore the big pan upon its head--he observed that much. And it made him laugh.  Then Mr. Crow began to scratch for his breakfast. But he had not eaten a single kernel when a terrible roar broke the early morning stillness. And there was a sound as of hail falling all around him.  Mr. Crow knew right away what had happened. The scarecrow had come to life and tried to shoot him! And if ever a bird hurried away from that field, it was old Mr. Crow.  It was almost night before he remembered that he had had nothing to eat all day. And so anybody can see how frightened he was....  Farmer Green walked home to his own breakfast with his gun resting upon his shoulder.  \"I didn't get him,\" he told Johnnie. \"But I must have scared him out of a year's growth.\"     V  A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT   After Farmer Green came so near shooting him, Mr. Crow lost his taste for corn for a whole year. He was afraid it would never come back to him. And he worried so much that he grew quite thin and his feathers began to look rusty. His friends were somewhat alarmed about his health, many of them saying that if they were in Mr. Crow's place they would be careful.  Now, strange as it may seem, that was exactly Mr. Crow's trouble. He was too careful! He was always on the lookout for a gun, or a trap. And being constantly on guard was bad for his nerves.  Luckily, a winter spent in the South did a great deal to improve Mr. Crow's health, as well as his state of mind. When he came back to Pleasant Valley the following March he told his cousin Jasper Jay that he really felt he would be able to eat corn again.  As the spring lengthened, that feeling grew upon Mr. Crow. And when planting-time arrived the black rascal had his old look again.  It was a very solemn look--unless you regarded him closely. But it was a very sly, knowing look if you took the pains to stare boldly into his eye.  Farmer Green would have liked to do that, because then he might have caught old Mr. Crow. As it happened, he did _catch sight_ of Mr. Crow the very first day he began to plant his corn.  \"I declare--there's that old crow again!\" he exclaimed. \"He's come back to bother me once more. But maybe I'm smarter than he thinks!\"  Mr. Crow knew better than to come too near the men who were working in the cornfield. He just sat on the fence on the further side of the road and watched them for a while. And he was getting hungrier every minute. But he had no chance to scratch up any corn that day.  The next day, however, the men had moved further down the field. Mr. Crow had been waiting for that. He flew to the edge of the ploughed ground, which they had planted the afternoon before, and dug up a kernel of corn.  He didn't stop to look at it. He knew it was corn--just by the feeling of it. And it was inside his mouth in a twinkling.  And in another twinkling it was outside again--for Mr. Crow did not like the taste at all.  \"That's a bad one!\" he remarked. And then he tried another kernel--and another--and another. But they were all like the first one.  Thereupon, Mr. Crow paused and looked at the corn. And he saw at once that there was something wrong. The kernels were gray, instead of a golden yellow. He pecked at one of them and found that the gray coating hid something black and sticky.  That was tar, though Mr. Crow did not know it. And the gray covering was wood-ashes, in which Farmer Green had rolled the corn after dipping it in tar. The tar made the corn taste bad. And the wood-ashes kept it from sticking to one's fingers.  \"This is a great disappointment,\" said Mr. Crow very solemnly. \"Of all the mean tricks that Farmer Green has played on me, this is by far the meanest. It would serve him right if I went away and never caught a single grasshopper or cutworm all summer.\"  But there were two reasons that prevented Mr. Crow's leaving Pleasant Valley. He liked his old home. And he liked grasshoppers and cutworms, too. So he stayed until October. And the strange part of it was that he never once discovered that Farmer Green had planted tarred corn only in a border around the field. Inside that border the corn was of the good, old yellow kind that Mr. Crow liked.  And so, for once, Farmer Green out-witted old Mr. Crow.  By the end of the summer his corn had grown so tall and borne so many big ears that Farmer Green took some of it to the county fair. And everybody who saw it there said that it was the finest corn that ever was seen in those parts.     VI  MR. CROW IN TROUBLE   After Mr. Crow found that Farmer Green had put tar on his corn, Mr. Crow was so angry that he flew for a good many miles before stopping. And then, as he started to walk along the limb that lead to his house in the tall elm, he noticed for the first time that he could hardly move his right foot.  He looked down and he was startled when he saw that his foot was many times its usual size. Moreover, it did not look like a foot at all, being a strange, huge, shapeless thing.  Old Mr. Crow was alarmed. Never in all his life had he found himself in such a plight. He stayed at home only long enough to tie his foot up in a bandage, which made it look bigger than ever. And then he hurried off as fast as he could fly to call upon Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who was said to be an excellent doctor.  Aunt Polly was at home. And since Mr. Crow could not crawl inside her house, she received him in her dooryard.  As soon as she looked at Mr. Crow's foot Aunt Polly Woodchuck threw up both her hands.  \"You have gout!\" she cried. \"And it's the worst case I ever saw.\"  That made Mr. Crow feel proud and happy.  \"What about a cure?\" he inquired. \"I shouldn't like to have my foot like this always. If you could cure it in a week I would be satisfied. But I want at least a week in which to show my foot to my friends.\"  \"You'll be lucky if you're better in a month,\" said Aunt Polly Woodchuck. \"You must be very careful about what you eat. You may have all the ginseng and Jimson weed and elecampane that you wish. And drink plenty of catnip tea! But until you're quite well again, don't touch corn, grasshoppers, birds' eggs, field-mice, or elderberries. If you eat such things your other foot may swell. And then you'd be unable to walk at all.\"  Mr. Crow was no longer happy.  \"Those are the things I like best--the last that you mentioned,\" he said. \"And the food you tell me I may have is exactly the kind I've never cared for in the least. As for catnip tea, I can't swallow it!\" he groaned. \"Haven't you some other remedy? Can't you give me a pill?\"  But Aunt Polly Woodehuck said there was no other way.  \"I never can remember what you've told me,\" Mr. Crow objected.  \"I can fix that,\" said Aunt Polly. And then she went into her house, returning presently with a basket. From the basket she drew forth a handful of herbs, which she gave to Mr. Crow.  \"Take these,\" she said, \"and put them in your right-hand pocket. These are what you may eat--a sample of each herb.\"  Straightway she gave Mr. Crow two more handfuls of food.  \"And here,\" she continued, \"here are things you mustn't eat. Put them in your left-hand pocket. And at dinner time to-night you won't have the least bit of trouble knowing what you're allowed to have.\"  Mr. Crow thanked her politely. But he felt somewhat angry, just the same. He saw that he was going to have a very unpleasant time. For if there was one thing that Mr. Crow liked, it was good food--and plenty of it.     VII  MR.
