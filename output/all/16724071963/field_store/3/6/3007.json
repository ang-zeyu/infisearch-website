WILLIAM McKINLEY.    DEPARTMENT OF STATE, _Washington_, _April 11, 1898_.  The PRESIDENT:  The Secretary of State has had the honor to receive, by reference from the President, a resolution adopted in the Senate of the United States on the 14th of February last, reading as follows:  \"_Resolved,_ That the President is requested, if in his opinion it is not incompatible with the public service, to send to the Senate copies of the reports of the consul-general and of the consuls of the United States in Cuba written or received since March 4, 1897, which relate to the state of war in that island and the condition of the people there, or that he will send such parts of said reports as will inform the Senate as to these facts.  \"Second. That the President inform the Senate whether any agent of a government in Cuba has been accredited to this Government or the President of the United States with authority to negotiate a treaty of reciprocity with the United States, or any other diplomatic or commercial agreement with the United States, and whether such person has been recognized and received as the representative of such government in Cuba.\"  This resolution contemplates answer being made to two separable inquiries: First, in relation to the present condition of affairs in Cuba, and, secondly, with regard to the action had in view of the overtures of the Government of Spain for a reciprocal commercial agreement covering particularly the trade between the United States and the island of Cuba.  The conduct of commercial negotiations under the authority and in accordance with the conditions found in sections 3, 4, and 5 of the existing tariff act, approved July 24, 1897, having been intrusted to a special commissioner plenipotentiary duly empowered by the President to that end, it has been deemed convenient to leave to the commissioner the preparation of a report in answer to the second part of the Senate resolution, the undersigned reserving to himself the response to the first part thereof, which concerns the political and consular functions of the Department of State. The separate report of the Hon. John A. Kasson, special commissioner plenipotentiary, is therefore herewith independently submitted to the President with a view to its transmission to the Senate, should such a course be, in the President's judgment, not incompatible with the public service.  The Senate resolution, while in terms calling for the submission to that honorable body of all or of a practical selection of the reports of the consul-general and consuls of the United States in Cuba written or received since March 4, 1897, which relate to the state of war in that island and the condition of the people there, appears to leave it to the discretion of the President to direct the scope of the information to be so reported and the manner of its communication. The undersigned, having taken the President's direction on both these points, has the honor to lay before him a selection of the correspondence received by the Department of State from the various consular representatives in Cuba, aiming thereby to show the present situation in the island rather than to give a historical account of all the reported incidents since the date assigned by the resolution.  Respectfully submitted.  JOHN SHERMAN.    DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON,  _Office of Special Commissioner Plenipotentiary_.  The PRESIDENT:  In response to the following resolution of the Senate, passed under date of February 14, 1898, and which was referred to the undersigned for report, viz--  \"Second. That the President inform the Senate whether any agent of a government in Cuba has been accredited to this Government or the President of the United States with authority to negotiate a treaty of reciprocity with the United States, or any other diplomatic or commercial agreement with the United States, and whether such person has been recognized and received as the representative of such government in Cuba\"--  I have the honor to submit the following report:  In October, 1897, the minister of Spain at this capital verbally advised the undersigned that so soon as the new government in Spain had leisure to take up the question he would probably be authorized to enter into negotiations with the undersigned for reciprocal trade arrangements with Spain, and that a representative of Cuba would probably be associated for the interests of that island.  Under date of December 9, 1897, the minister of the United States at Madrid was instructed to ascertain the disposition of the Spanish Government in respect to these negotiations.  Under date of January 24, 1898, a dispatch from Mr. Woodford (referred to this office) advised the Secretary of State that arrangements were made for the negotiation of a commercial treaty between Spain and the United States; that separate provisions would be made for Cuba, and that the Cuban insular government would appoint a delegate to represent that island in the negotiations. This was accompanied by a memorandum from the Spanish minister of colonies, stating that the same rules as for Cuba might be applied to Puerto Rico, and suggesting a basis for the negotiations. This communication was referred to this office on the 4th of February.  On the 6th of February the Spanish minister, Mr. Dupuy de Lôme, called on the undersigned and announced that he was authorized to represent Spain in the pending negotiations and that a special representative would arrive from Cuba, under appointment of the insular government, to act as far as the interests of that island were involved. He mentioned the name of Señor Angulo as the gentleman who had been suggested in Cuba for that appointment; but the delegate was not officially notified to this office.  On March 17 a note from the Spanish minister, Señor Polo y Bernabé, addressed, under date of the 16th instant, to the Secretary of State, was referred to this office. In that note his excellency advised this Government of his appointment by Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain to conduct these negotiations, assisted by Señor Manuel Rafael Angulo as special delegate of the insular government of Cuba, who would be aided by two technical assistants, also appointed by the Cuban government; and, further, that an officer from the treasury department would be added in the same character.  His excellency announced his readiness to commence the labors of the commission so soon as the Government of the United States should formulate the general plan for carrying on the work.  Respectfully submitted, March 17, 1898.  JOHN A KASSON,  _Special Commissioner Plenipotenitary_.    EXECUTIVE MANSION, _April 12, 1898_.  _To the Senate of the United States:_  In response to a resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant, I inclose herewith a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, inclosing a copy of a report from the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation.  WILLIAM McKINLEY.    NAVY DEPARTMENT, _Washington, April 9, 1898_.  The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE.  SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Senate resolution of April 4, directing that the Senate be informed \"of the total number of human lives that were lost by the sinking of the United States battle ship _Maine_ in Havana Harbor, Cuba, on the 15th day of February, 1898, the total number of dead bodies rescued from said ship, the total number remaining unrescued, and what effort, if any, is being made to rescue them,\" and in reply thereto inclose a copy of a report from the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation covering the above inquiry. I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully,  JOHN D. LONG, _Secretary_.     MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY.

HOLT,  WHOSE THUNDER I HAVE STOLEN   ILLUSTRATIONS  THE TWO CRUISERS WERE CHUG-CHUGGING OUT OF THE HARBOUR  \"IT IS!\" HE CRIED. \"WE'VE GOT HER, FELLOWS!\"  \"THOSE WAVES WILL BATTER HER TO PIECES\"  \"THEY OFFER YOU--\" MR. HYATT LEANED FORWARD IN THE PROTESTING CHAIR      CHAPTER I  HOW IT STARTED   The Adventure Club had its inception, one evening toward the last of June, in Number 17 Sumner Hall, which is the oldest, most vine-hidden and most hallowed of the seven dormitories of Dexter Academy. It was a particularly warm evening, the two windows were wide open and the green-shaded light on the study table in the centre of the room had been turned low--Sumner prided itself on being conservative to the extent of gas instead of electricity and tin bathtubs instead of porcelain--and in the dim radiance the three occupants of the room were scarcely more than darker blurs.  Since final examinations had ended that afternoon and Graduation Day was only some twenty-eight hours away, none of the three was doing anything more onerous than yawning, and the yawn which came from Perry Bush, didn't sound as though it cost much of an effort. It was, rather, a comfortable, sleepy yawn, one that expressed contentment and relief, a sort of \"Glad-that's-over-and-I'm-still-alive\" yawn.  There was a window-seat under each casement in Number 17, and each was occupied by a recumbent figure. Perry was on the right-hand seat, his hands under his head and one foot sprawled on the floor, and Joe Ingersoll was in the other, his slim, white-trousered legs jack-knifed against the darker square of the open window. Near Joe, his feet tucked sociably against Joe's ribs, Steve Chapman, the third of the trio, reclined in a Morris chair. I use the word reclined advisedly, for Steve had lowered the back of the chair to its last notch, and to say that he was sitting would require a stretch of the imagination almost as long as Steve himself! Through the windows Steve could see the dark masses of the campus elms, an occasional star between the branches, and, by raising his head the fraction of an inch, the lights in the upper story of Hawthorne, across the yard. Somewhere under the trees outside a group of fellows were singing to the accompaniment of a wailing ukelele. They sang softly, so that the words floated gently up to the open casements just distinguishable:        \"_Years may come and years may go,         Seasons ebb and seasons flow,         Autumn lie 'neath Winters' snow,       Spring bring Summer verdancy.         Life may line our brow with care,         Time to silver turn our hair,         Still, to us betide whate'er,       Dexter, we'll remember thee!_        \"_Other memories may fade,         Hopes grow dim in ev'ning's shade,         Golden friendships that we made_--\"  \"Aw, shut up!\" muttered Perry, breaking the silence that had held them for several minutes. Joe Ingersoll laughed softly.  \"You don't seem to like the efforts of the--um--sweet-voiced choristers,\" he said in his slow way.  \"I don't like the sob-stuff,\" replied Perry resentfully. \"What's the use of rubbing it in? Why not let a fellow be cheerful after he has got through by the skin of his teeth and kicked his books under the bed? Gosh, some folks never want anyone to be happy!\" He raised himself by painful effort and peered out and down into the gloom. \"Sophs, I'll bet,\" he murmured, falling back again on the cushions. \"No one else would sit out here on the grass and sing school songs two days before the end. I hope that idiot singing second bass will get a brown-tail caterpillar down his neck!\"  \"The end!\" observed Steve Chapman. \"You say that as if we were all going to die the day after tomorrow, Perry! Cheer up! Vacation's coming!\"  \"Vacation be blowed!\" responded Perry. \"What's that amount to, anyway? Nothing ever happens to me in vacation. It's all well enough for you fellows to laugh. You're going up to college together in the Fall. I'm coming back to this rotten hole all alone!\"  \"Not quite alone, Sweet Youth,\" corrected Joe. \"There will be some four hundred other fellows here.\"  \"Oh, well, you know what I mean,\" said Perry impatiently. \"You and Steve will be gone, and I don't give a hang for any other chaps!\"  He ended somewhat defiantly, conscious that he had indulged in a most unmanly display of sentiment, and was glad that the darkness hid the confusion and heightened colour that followed the confession. Steve and Joe charitably pretended not to have noticed the lamentable exhibition of feeling, and a silence followed, during which the voices of the singers once more became audible.        \"_Dexter! Mother of our Youth!       Dexter! Guardian of the Truth!_\"  \"_Cut it out!_\" Perry leaned over the windowsill and bawled the command down into the darkness. A defiant jeer answered him.  \"Don't be fresh,\" said Steve reprovingly. Perry mumbled and relapsed into silence. Presently, sighing as he changed his position, Joe said:  \"I believe Perry's right about vacation, Steve. Nothing much ever does happen to a fellow in Summer. I believe I've had more fun in school than at home the last six years.\"  The others considered the statement a minute. Then: \"Correct,\" said Steve. \"It's so, I guess. We're always crazy to get home in June and just as crazy to get back to school again in September, and I believe we all have more good times here than at home.\"  \"Of course we do,\" agreed Perry animatedly. \"Anyway, I do. Summers are all just the same. My folks lug me off to the Water Gap and we stay there until it's time to come back here. I play tennis and go motoring and sit around on the porch and--and--bathe--\"  \"Let's hope so,\" interpolated Joe gravely.  \"And nothing really interesting ever happens,\" ended Perry despairingly. \"Gee, I'd like to be a pirate or--or something!\"  \"Summers _are_ rather deadly,\" assented Steve. \"We go to the seashore, but the place is filled with swells, and about all they do is change their clothes, eat and sleep. When you get ready for piracy, Perry, let me know, will you! I'd like to sign-on.\"  \"Put me down, too,\" said Joe. \"I've always had a--um--sneaking idea that I'd make a bully pirate. I'm naturally bloodthirsty and cruel. And I've got a mental list of folks who--um--I'd like to watch walk the plank!\"  \"Fellows of our ages have a rotten time of it, anyway,\" Perry grumbled. \"We're too old to play kids' games and too young to do anything worth while. What I'd like to do--\"  \"Proceed, Sweet Youth,\" Joe prompted after a moment.  \"Well, I'd like to--to start something! I'd like to get away somewhere and do things. I'm tired of loafing around in white flannels all day and keeping my hands clean. And I'm tired of dabbing whitewash on my shoes! Didn't you fellows ever think that you'd like to get good and dirty and not have to care? Wouldn't you like to put on an old flannel shirt and a pair of khaki trousers and some 'sneakers' and--and roll in the mud?\"  \"Elemental stuff,\" murmured Joe. \"He's been reading Jack London.\"  \"Well, that's the way I feel, lots of times,\" said Perry defiantly. \"I'm tired of being clean and white, and I'm tired of dinner jackets, and I'm sick to death of hotel porches! Gee, a healthy chap never was intended to lead the life of a white poodle with a pink ribbon around his neck! Me for some rough-stuff!\"  \"You're dead right, too,\" agreed Steve. \"That kind of thing is all right for Joe, of course. Joe's a natural-born 'fusser.' He's never happier than when he's dolled up in a sport-shirt and a lavender scarf and toasting marshmallows. But--\"  \"Is that so?\" inquired Joe with deep sarcasm. \"If I was half the 'fusser' you are--\"  \"What I want,\" interrupted Perry, warming to his theme, \"is adventure! I'd like to hunt big game, or discover the North Pole--\"  \"You're a year or two late,\" murmured Joe.  \"--or dig for hidden treasure!\"  \"You should--um--change your course of reading,\" advised Joe. \"Too much Roosevelt and Peary and Stevenson is your trouble. Read the classics for awhile--or the Patty Books.\"  \"That's all right, but you chaps are just the same, only you won't own up to it.\"  \"One of us will,\" said Steve; \"and does.\"  \"Make it two,\" yawned Joe. \"Beneath this--um--this polished exterior there beats a heart--I mean there flows the red blood of--\"  \"Look here, fellows, why not?\" asked Steve.  \"Why not what?\" asked Perry.  \"Why not have adventures? They say that all you have to do is look for them.\"  \"Don't you believe it! I've looked for them for years and I've never seen one yet.\" Perry swung his feet to the floor and sat up.  \"Well, not at Delaware Water Gap, naturally. You've got to move around, son. You don't find them by sitting all day with your feet on the rail of a hotel piazza.\"  \"Where do you find them, then?\" Perry demanded.  Steve waved a hand vaguely aloft into the greenish radiance of the lamp. \"All round. North, east, south and west. Land or sea. Adventures, Perry, are for the adventurous. Now, here we are, three able-bodied fellows fairly capable of looking after ourselves in most situations, tired of the humdrum life of Summer resorts. What's to prevent our spending a couple of months together and finding some adventures? Of course, we can't go to Africa and shoot lions and wart-hogs--whatever they may be,--and we can't fit out an Arctic exploration party and discover Ingersoll Land or Bush Inlet or Chapman's Passage, but we could have a mighty good time, I'd say, and, even if we didn't have many hair-breadth escapes, I'll bet it would beat chasing tennis balls and doing the Australian crawl and keeping our white shoes and trousers clean!\"  \"We could be as dirty as we liked!\" sighed Perry ecstatically. \"Lead me to it!\"  \"It sounds positively fascinating,\" drawled "]]]
