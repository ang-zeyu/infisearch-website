So I have no ill word to say against him. Five years later he would have troubled about me and my kingship not at all; now he must be careful, for his power was not at its full.  As for young Eric, I suppose that he boasted ever after that he had put me to flight; but I do not know that it matters if he did.  So I came back to Durness, where I was to meet with Einar; and peace was made between him and the king, and he thought it well to go and speak with him. Then he and I must part, and that was hard.  \"Now must you go your own way, son Ranald, for Harald is too strong for us. Maybe that is best for you, for here shall I bide in peace in Orkney; and that is not a life for a king's son--to sit at a jarl's table in idleness, or fight petty fights for scatt withholden and the like. Better for you the wide seas and the lands where you may make a name, and maybe a kingdom, for yourself. Yet I shall miss you sorely.\"  So he said, and I knew that he was right. Maybe the spirit of the sword I had won got hold of me, as they say will happen; for I had waxed restless of late, and I had tried to keep it from Einar. Now I hated myself for it, seeing at hand what I had longed for.  So he went north to meet Harald, and of our parting I will not say more. I could not then tell that I should not see him again, and that was well: but I know that when I saw the last flicker of his sails against the sky, I felt more lonely even than at the graveside in Southmere.  Yet I was in no worse case than were many nobly-born men at that time; for whosoever would not bow to Harald and his new laws must leave Norway, and her bravest were seeking new homes everywhere. Some had gone to far-off Iceland, and some to East Anglia; some to the Greek emperor, or Gardariki, and more yet to Ireland. But the greatest viking of all, Rolf, the son of Rognvald, Einar's young brother, had gone to France or England, with a mighty following; for Harald had outlawed him among the first who broke his law by plundering on the Norway coasts. A good law it was, but it was new, and so went against the grain at first. Rolf had sworn to make a new kingdom for himself, and why should not I do the same?  So when I was in the open sea again, with all the world before me, as the long sea-miles passed I grew lighthearted, and many were the thoughts of great deeds to come that filled my mind.    Chapter III. Odda, the Ealdorman of Devon.   Now I steered eastward from Sutherland, and sailed down the east coasts of Scotland and England; and there is nothing to say about such a cruise, that had nought more wonderful in it than the scaring of the folk when we put in for food. I had made up my mind to go to Ireland for the winter, where, as every Northman knew, there were kingdoms to be won--having no wish to be Rolf's follower, seeing he was but a jarl's son; and finding that England had no overlord, seeing that even now Alfred of Wessex and Guthrum of East Anglia were fighting for mastery, so that the whole land was racked and torn with strife.  Maybe I thought too much of myself at that time, but I was in no haste to do aught but cruise about and find where I might best make a name. I had but my one ship and crew, and I would not throw them away on some useless business for want of care in choosing.  Now, when we came into the English Channel, a gale began to blow up from the southwest; and we held over to the French shore, and there put into a haven that was sheltered enough. The gale strengthened, and lasted three days; but the people were kindly enough, being of Saxon kin, who had settled there under the headland they call Greynose, since Hengist's times of the winning of England across the water. And when the gale was over, we waited for the sea to go down, and then came a fair wind from the eastward, as we expected. So we got provisions on board, and sailed westward again, taking a long slant over to the English coast, until we sighted the great rock of Portland; and then the wind came off the land, and in the early morning veered to the northwest.  The tide was still with us as the light strengthened; then as the day broke, with the haze of late summer over the land, we found that we were right in the track of a strange fleet that was coming up fast from the westward--great ships and small, in a strange medley and in no sort of order, so that we wondered what they would be.  \"Here comes Rolf Ganger back from Valland,\" said Kolgrim. \"He has gathered any vessels he could get together, and is going to land in England.\"  \"We will even head out to sea from across their course,\" I said. \"Maybe they are Danes from Exeter, flying from the Saxons.\"  So we headed away for the open channel until at least we knew more. The fleet drew up steadily, bringing the tide with them; and presently we fell to wondering at the gathering. For there were some half-dozen ships that were plainly Norse like ourselves, maybe twenty Danish-built longships, and about the same number of heavy trading vessels. There were a few large fishing boats also; but leading the crowd were five great vessels the like of which none of us had ever seen or heard of before. And even as we spoke of them, two of these shook out reefs in their sails, and drew away from the rest across channel, as if to cut us off.  \"Ho, men,\" I said, when I saw that, \"get to arms; for here they come to speak with us. Maybe we shall have to fight--and these are no easy nuts to crack!\"  Whereat the men laughed; and straightway there was the pleasant hustle and talk of those who donned mail shirt and helm and set the throwing weapons to hand with all good will.  \"Let us keep on our course,\" I said to Kolgrim. \"We will see if we cannot weather on these ships, and anyway shall fight them better apart from the rest. It is a fine breeze for a sailing match.\"  So we held on; and the two great ships to windward of us began to gain on us slowly, which was a thing that had never been done by any ship before. I do not know that even Harald Fairhair had any swifter ship than this that Halfdan had taken in his flight from home. Kolgrim waxed very wroth when it became plain that these could outsail us.  \"There is witchcraft about those great hulks,\" he growled. \"They are neither Norse, nor Frisian, nor Danish, but better than all three put together.\"  \"I have sailed in ships, and talked of ships, and dreamed of them moreover, since I could stand alone,\" said Thord, \"but I never so much as thought of the like of these. If they belong to some new kind of viking, there are hard times in store for some of us.\"  \"Faith,\" said I, \"I believe they have swept up and made prizes of all that medley astern of them.\"  So we held on for half an hour, and all that time they gained steadily on us; and we neared them quickly at last, for we tried to hold across their bows and weather on them. That was no good, for they were as weatherly as we.  Now we could see that their decks were covered with armed men, and it seemed certain that they meant to make prize of us. The leading ship was maybe half a mile ahead of the other, and that a mile from us--all three close-hauled as we strove to gain a weather berth. Then the leading ship put her helm up and stood across our course, and the second followed her.  \"We must out oars now if we are to weather on them,\" said Kolgrim at last.  Then the men shouted; and I looked at the second ship, to which they were pointing. Her great sail was overboard, for the halliards had gone--chafed through maybe, or snapped with the strain as she paid off quickly. Then a new hope came to me.  \"Men,\" I said, \"let us take the other vessel, and then come back on this; they are worth winning.\"  They cheered. And now the fight seemed to be even--ship to ship at least, if our foe was larger and higher and swifter than ours; for I thought that he would hardly have a crew like mine.  We up helm and stood away on the new course the foe had taken, leaving the crippled ship astern very fast. And now we began to edge up towards the other vessel, meaning to go about under her stern, and so shoot to windward of her on the other tack. But then I thought of a plan which might help us in the fighting. There had seemed little order and much shouting on board the ship we had left when her sail fell, and maybe there was the same want of discipline here.  \"Out oars, men! Keep them swinging, but put no weight on them. Let them pull after us and tire themselves. I have a mind to see how our dragon looks on yonder high stem head.\"  The men laughed grimly, and the oars were run out. One called to me:  \"Maybe they beat us in sailing, king; we can teach them somewhat in weapon play.\"  \"See how they get their oars out,\" said Kolgrim, with a sour grin; \"a set of lubbers they are.\"  One by one, and in no order, the long oars were being got to work. The great ship was half as long again as ours, pulling twenty-eight oars a side to our twenty. But while ours rose and fell as if worked by one man, theirs were pulled anyhow, as one might say.  \"Better are they at sailing than rowing,\" said Thord.  Nevertheless they flew down on us, and that because we only made a show of rowing.  Then we laid on the oars, and came head to wind. The sail rattled down, and was stowed on deck; and silently we waited, arrows on string, for the fight that was now close at hand.  Then the great ship hove up, head to wind, right ahead of us, and a loud hail came from her.  \"Who knows what tongue he talks?\" I said. \"I cannot make him out rightly.\"  \"'Tis West Saxon,\" said an old warrior from the waist. \"He asks who we are and what is our business.\"  \"Tell him therefore, if you can speak in his way,\" I answered; \"and ask the same of him.\"  So a hail or two went backwards and forwards, and then:  \"Says he is Odda, jarl or somewhat of Devon in Wessex, and bids us yield to Alfred the king.\"  \"In truth,\" said I, \"if he had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14034"],["title","King Alfred's Viking: A Story of the First English Fleet (#7)"],["body","spoken of yielding, I had had more to say to a king who can build ships like these. Now we will speak with him on his own deck. Tell him he will have to fight us first.\"  The old warrior sent a mighty curt hail back in answer to Odda's summons; then our war horns blew, and the oars rose and fell, and we were grinding our bows alongside the great ship's quarter before they knew we were there. Alfred's men had yet somewhat to learn of fighting in a sea way, as it seemed, for we were on their deck aft before they had risen from their oar benches. There were but one or two men on the quarter deck, besides the steersman, to oppose us. Odda thought we should lay our ship alongside his towering sides if we fought, as I suppose, for he was amidships.  So we swept the decks from aft forward without any hurt to ourselves: for the Saxons were hampered with the oars, and fell backward over them, and hindered one another. It was strange to hear my men laughing in what seemed most terrible slaughter; for their foes fell before they were smitten, and lay helpless under the oars, while their comrades fell over them.  So we won to the foot of the mast, and then found that there were some on board who were none so helpless: for as we came they swung the great yard athwart ships, and that stayed us; while over the heap of canvas glared those who would make it hard for us to win the ship altogether.  But before we came to stern fighting, I had a word to say; so I called for Odda.  A square built, brown-bearded man with a red, angry face pushed his way to the front of his men, and frowned at me.  \"What will you? here am I,\" he said shortly.  One could understand his words well enough when face to face, for he spoke in the mixed tongue that any Northman understands, the plain words of which all our kin have in common.  \"I am no foe of Alfred's,\" I said; \"I do not know, therefore, why I should fight you.\"  \"Are you not for the Danes?\" he said.  \"I hate them more or less, and I have no traffic with them.\"  \"Well, then, what will you?\"  \"You bade me yield, and therefore I am here. Now I think it is a matter to be seen whether of us does so.\"  \"It seems that you have slain about half my men,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, I do not give up without fighting for the rest of my ship that you have not won.\"  \"That is well said,\" I answered.  But the men were laughing, for Kolgrim had stooped, and, reaching under an oar bench, had dragged out a rower by the neck. The man swore and struggled; but Kolgrim hove him up, and lifted him over the yard to Odda's feet.  \"They are all like that, Saxon,\" he said cheerfully. \"Maybe there is a head or two broken; 'tis mostly what we call seasickness, however.\"  Odda looked at the man, who seemed wretched enough, but had no hurt; then he stared at our laughing faces, and his own brow began to clear.  \"It comes into my mind,\" he said, \"that maybe you would listen to me if I owned first that you have the best of us, and then asked you to fight for Alfred of Wessex. We need the help of such men as you just now; and if you hate Danes, we have work enough for you.\"  \"One may certainly listen to that,\" I answered, laughing.  \"What say you, men? Shall we cast in our lot with Alfred for a while?\"  \"We follow you, Ranald the king,\" Kolgrim answered for all. \"If it seems good to you, it is good for us. There will be fighting enough, I trow, if all we have heard is true.\"  Then said Odda:  \"And that before long. There is a Danish fleet in Poole Harbour that is to bring Danes from Wareham to the help of those whom Alfred holds in Exeter. We have to meet this fleet and scatter it.\"  \"Then,\" said old Thord, \"your men must be better handled, for Danes are no new swordsmen or seamen either.\"  Now the men stood listening to our talk, and this sort of saying was not good for them to hear, if they were to meet the foe soon with a good hope of victory. So Odda said quickly:  \"If you will indeed fight for us, you must trust to Alfred to give you fitting reward. I do not know what I might say about that, having thought of no such chance as this. But there is no man who can complain of him.\"  I had heard that the king was ever open handed, but also that at this time he had little to give. Maybe, however, we might help him to riches again. I had the men to think of, but I will say for myself that I had not thought of asking what reward or pay should be given.  I sheathed my sword, and held out my hand to Odda across the yard that was between us; and he grasped it honestly, while the men on either side cheered.  \"Stay here and speak with me,\" Odda said. \"Now we must get back to the fleet.\"  Then went back to our ship, all but Thord and half a dozen warriors, whom he kept as guard for me, I suppose; and the grappling lines were cast off. Then we made sail again, and headed to rejoin the rest of the Saxon vessels. Odda's crippled ship had repaired her damage at this time, and went with us. But first it was plain that she thought we had taken her consort, for she prepared to fight us, and Odda had to hail her once or twice before she was sure of what had happened. Then her crew cheered also.  Now Odda took me aft, and we sat together on his quarter deck. Thord came also, and leaned on the rail beside us, looking with much disfavour at the crew, who were plainly landsmen at sea for the first time, if they were stout fighting men enough. Maybe there were ten seamen among the hundred and fifty, but these had handled the ship well under canvas, as we knew.  \"You have come in good time, King Ranald,\" Odda said. \"You see what state we are in; can you better it for us?\"  \"Many things I can see that need strengthening,\" I answered. \"But you seem to take me into your counsels over soon, seeing that I have just fallen on you sword in hand.\"  \"Why,\" said Odda frankly, \"it is just your way of speaking to me sword in hand that makes me sure that I can trust you. I cannot deny that you had this ship at your mercy, and that the other would have been yours next; and you knew it, and yet spoke me fair. So it is plain that you mean well by us.\"  \"Ay,\" said I, \"but for your bidding me to yield, there would have been no fighting at all, when I knew to whom the ships belonged.\"  \"You have put a thought in my mind, and I am glad you did board us, seeing there is no harm done,\" Odda answered. \"I will tell you what it is. Send me some of your men to order my people and tell them how to prepare for battle. Here am I sent to sea for the first time, with good warriors enough who are in like case, and a few seamen who can sail the ship and know nought else.\"  \"You have some Norsemen yonder, if I mistake not,\" I said, looking at the fleet which we were nearing.  \"Ay--wandering vikings who care nought for what I say. They were going to Rolf, and the king persuaded them to take this cruise first. If you can make them follow you, there will be another matter for which I shall be more than thankful.\"  Thereat Thord growled: \"They will follow Ranald Vemundsson well enough; have no care about that.\"  Then said I:  \"These are the finest ships I have ever seen. Where did they come from?\"  \"Alfred, our king, planned them,\" said Odda, with much pride; \"and they were built by our own men, working under Frisian shipwrights, in Plymouth.\"  \"How will you like to command one of these, Thord?\" I asked then.  \"I like the ship well enough. The crew is bad. And then, whose command is the fleet under?\"  \"Take the ship, Thord, and lick my crew into shape; and Ranald, your king, shall command the fleet,\" Odda said plainly.  \"Fair and softly,\" said Thord bluntly. \"I can do the two things you ask me; but will your men follow Ranald?\"  \"Faith,\" said Odda, \"if I say they are to do so, they must.\"  So in the end I left Thord and my seamen with Odda; but I would not take his place, only saying that I would lead the Norsemen, and that he could follow our plans. I would put more good men into each of his five ships, and they should do what they could. At least they could teach the Saxons how to board a ship, and how to man their own sides against boarders from a foe.  Those Norsemen said they would gladly follow the son of King Vemund and foster son of Einar the jarl; and so we led the strange fleet, and held on eastward with a light breeze all that day, making little way when the tide turned, and held back by the slower vessels. Men in plenty there were, but ill fitted for aught but hand fighting; though I had more Norsemen sent into the larger ships, such as those that had been taken from the Danes and the better trading vessels. One might soon see the difference in the trim and order on board as the vikings got to work and the Saxons overcame their sickness.  Now we might meet the Danes at any time, and I could not tell how matters would go. One thing was certain, however, and that was that they looked for no gathering of ships by Alfred. We should certainly take them by surprise, and I hoped, therefore, that they would be in no trim for fighting.  There was a very swift cutter belonging to the Norsemen, and as night fell I sent her on to keep watch along the shore for the first coming of the Danes, while we shortened sail; for the mouth of Poole Harbour was not far distant, and if we passed that we should be seen, and perhaps it would be guessed that we were not a friendly fleet. Towards evening, too, the wind shifted, and blew more off the shore, and that might bring them out from their haven. Kolgrim, who was weather wise, said that a shift of wind to the southward was coming presently.  When morning came, the high cliffs of Swanage were on our bow, the wind was yet steady from off shore, and beyond the headland lay Poole Harbour, at whose head is Wareham, where the Danes were. It is a great sea inlet with a narrow mouth, and one must have water enough on a rising tide to enter it. Now the ebb was running, and if the Danes came this morning, it would be soon.  They came, as it seemed,"]]]
