AKRON, O.  THE SAALFIELD PUBLISHING CO  NEW YORK CHICAGO  [Illustration:]     THE SAALFIELD PUB. Co.  1916     THE TALE  OF  PETER RABBIT   Once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter.  [Illustration]  They lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.  \"Now, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \"You may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"  [Illustration]  Now run along and don't get into mischief. I am going out.\"  Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through the wood to the baker's.  [Illustration]  She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.  Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail who were good little bunnies went down the lane together  [Illustration]  To gather blackberries.  [Illustration]  But Peter who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden and  [Illustration]  Squeezed under the gate!  [Illustration]  First he ate some lettuces and some French beans  [Illustration]  And then  He Ate Some Radishes  [Illustration]  And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!  Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out \"Stop thief!\"  [Illustration]  Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  [Illustration]  He lost one shoe among the cabbages, and the other amongst the potatoes.  [Illustration]  After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster  [Illustration]  So that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net  [Illustration]  And got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.  [Illustration]  It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.  [Illustration]  Peter gave himself up for lost and shed big tears;  [Illustration]  But his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows  [Illustration]  Who flew to him in great excitement and implored him to exert himself.  Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop on the top of Peter, but Peter wriggled out just in time.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Leaving his jacket behind him.  [Illustration]  He rushed into the tool-shed and--  [Illustration]  Jumped into a can.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it. Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.  [Illustration]  He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.  Presently Peter sneezed \"Kertyschoo!\"  Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who  Jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.  Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.  After a time he began to wander about, going lippity-- lippity-- not very fast and looking all around.  He found a door in a wall; but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth she could not answer. She only shook her head at him.  [Illustration]  Peter began to cry.  Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her.  [Illustration]  He had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.  He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.  Peter scuttered underneath the bushes, but presently as nothing happened, he came out and  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.  The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter and beyond him was the gate!  Peter got down very quietly off the wheel-barrow and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black currant bushes. Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.  Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds. [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Peter never stopped running or looked behind him  [Illustration]  Till he got home to the big fir-tree.  [Illustration]  He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole, and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.  It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!  I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. His mother put him to bed and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter! \"One teaspoonful to be taken at bedtime.\" But--  [Illustration]  Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.

A. HENTY  Author of _Bonnie Prince Charlie_, _With Clive in India_, _The Dragon and the Raven_, _The Young Carthaginian_, _The Lion of the North_  Illustrated  A.L. Burt Company Publishers, New York        PREFACE  Although in the present story a boy plays the principal part, and encounters many adventures by land and sea, a woman is the real heroine, and the part she played demanded an amount of nerve and courage fully equal to that necessary for those who take part in active warfare. Boys are rather apt to think, mistakenly, that their sex has a monopoly of courage, but I believe that in moments of great peril women are to the full as brave and as collected as men. Indeed, my own somewhat extensive experience leads me to go even further, and to assert that among a civil population, untrained to arms, the average woman is cooler and more courageous than the average man. Women are nervous about little matters; they may be frightened at a mouse or at a spider; but in the presence of real danger, when shells are bursting in the streets, and rifle bullets flying thickly, I have seen them standing kitting at their doors and talking to their friends across the street when not a single man was to be seen.  There is no greater mistake than to think women cowards because they are sometimes nervous over trifles. Were it necessary, innumerable cases could be quoted from history to prove that women can, upon occasion, fight as courageously as men. CÃ¦sar found that the women of the German tribes could fight bravely side by side with the men, and the Amazons of the King of Dahomey are more feared by the neighboring tribes than are his male soldiers. Almost every siege has its female heroines, and in the Dutch War of Independence the female companies at Sluys and Haarlem proved themselves a match for the best soldiers of Spain. Above all, in patient endurance of pain and suffering, women are immeasurably superior to men. I emphasize this point because I know that many boys, simply because they are stronger than girls, are apt to regard them with a sort of contempt, and to fancy themselves without the least justification, not only stronger but braver and more courageous--in fact superior beings in every way.

UNEXPECTED NEWS.   \"I have written to ask Ralph Conway to come and stay for a time with me.\" The announcement was a simple one, but it fell like a bombshell in the midst of the party at breakfast at Penfold Hall. The party consisted only of the speaker, Herbert Penfold, and his two sisters. The latter both exclaimed \"Herbert!\" in a tone of shocked surprise. Mr. Penfold was evidently prepared for disapprobation; he had spoken in a somewhat nervous tone, but with a decision quite unusual to him. He had finished his last piece of toast and emptied his last cup of tea before making the announcement, and he now pushed back his chair, rose to his feet, and said: \"Yes; I have been thinking of having him here for some time, and I suppose that as master of this house I am at liberty to ask whom I like; at any rate I would rather have no discussion on the subject.\"  So saying, without giving his sisters time to reply, he walked hastily to the door and went out. Miss Penfold and Miss Eleanor Penfold gazed at each other in speechless astonishment. So accustomed were they to settle everything that took place at Penfold Hall, that this sudden assumption of authority on the part of their brother fairly staggered them. Miss Penfold was the first to speak:  \"This is terrible, Eleanor! To think that after all these years Herbert's thoughts should still be turning toward that woman. But it is only what might be expected. The ingratitude of men is terrible. Here we have for the last twenty years been devoting our lives to him--not only keeping his house for him, but seeing that he did not fall a victim to any of the designing women who would have insinuated themselves into his good graces, and preventing him from indulging in all sorts of foolish tastes and bringing himself to ruin; and now you see he turns again to that artful woman, and, without saying a word to us, invites her son to come here. It is monstrous, sister!\"  \"It is monstrous,\" Miss Eleanor Penfold repeated, with tears in her eyes. \"It is like flying in the face of Providence, sister.\"  \"It is flying in our faces,\" Miss Penfold replied sharply; \"and just at the present moment that is of more importance. To think that that man must have been brooding over this, and making up his mind to act in this way for weeks perhaps, and never to say a word to us upon the subject. I wonder he didn't ask the woman herself down!\"  \"He never could have done such a shameless thing, Charlotte,\" her sister said much shocked. \"Of course, we must have left the house instantly.\"  \"I should not have left the house,\" Miss Penfold said firmly. \"If the woman comes--and now he has asked the boy it is quite possible that he may ask the mother--our duty will be to remain here. You know we have been uneasy ever since her husband died. Herbert's infatuation concerning her has been pitiable, and we have always believed it has been that alone which has caused him to refuse so obstinately to enter into our plans, or to pay even decent courtesy to the various excellent young women we have from time to time asked down here, and who were in every way suitable for the position of mistress of this house--women full of sense, and who, with right guidance, would have made him perfectly happy. And now he flies in our faces and asks the boy down. I have had an idea for some little time that he has had something on his mind; he has been more nervous and fidgety than usual, and several times he has seemed to be on the point of saying something, and then changed his mind. Of course, one can understand it all now. No wonder he was ashamed to look us in the face when he was meditating such a step as this. The duplicity of man is something shocking!\"  It was not surprising that Herbert Penfold's sudden assertion of his will was a shock to his sisters. These ladies had so long been accustomed to rule absolutely at Penfold Hall that Mr. Penfold's assertion of his right to act as he pleased in his own house came upon them like an act of absolute rebellion. At their father's death they were women of twenty-seven and twenty-six years old respectively. Herbert was a lad of sixteen. He was of a gentle and yielding disposition; and as their father for some years previous to his death had been a confirmed invalid, and they had had the complete management of the house, it was but natural that at his death they should continue in the same position.  Owing to weak health, Herbert had not been sent to school, but had been educated under the care of a tutor. He had wished when he reached the age of nineteen to enter one of the universities; but his sisters had been so opposed to the idea, and had represented so strongly to him his unfitness to take part in the rough sports of the young men, and how completely he would feel out of place in such companionship, that he had abandoned the idea, and had traveled on the Continent for three years with his tutor, his sisters being for most of the time of the party. Soon after his return he had fallen in love with the daughter of Colonel Vernon, an officer living on half-pay at Poole, which was the nearest town to Penfold Hall. The announcement of his engagement came like a thunder-clap upon his sisters, who had agreed that it would be in all respects desirable that Herbert should not marry for some years.  They had, however, been wise enough not to offer any open opposition to the match. Three months later the engagement was broken off. How it came about no one exactly knew. Unpleasant reports were set on foot; there were misunderstandings which should easily have been cleared up, but which grew until they gave rise to serious quarrels. Letters which might have set matters straight somehow failed to come to hand; and so at last things went from bad to worse until there was a final quarrel, a return of letters and presents on both sides, and a final breaking off of the engagement. A year later Mary Vernon married Mr. Conway, an architect, resident in London.  Mr. Penfold had before this become convinced that Mary Vernon had not been to blame in the matter, and that he had in some way or other taken an altogether mistaken view of the subject. He knew by the comments of such friends as were intimate enough to speak, and the coolness of many others, that he was considered to have behaved very badly toward her. And this thought was a most distressing one, for he was deeply attached to Mary; and had he not been convinced that from some reason or other she herself had ceased to care for him, and was anxious to break off the engagement, he would have gone any length towards healing the breach. When it was too late he bitterly regretted his own weakness in submitting to the domination of his sisters, and felt a deep though silent resentment against them for the share that he was convinced they had taken in causing the breach between himself and Mary Vernon; but although he resented, he had neither the will nor firmness to free himself from their domination.
