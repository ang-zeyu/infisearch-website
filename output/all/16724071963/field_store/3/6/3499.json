He laughed and laughed, while the match he had just lighted flared, sent up a blue thread of brimstone smoke, licked along the white wood and scorched his fingers painfully before he remembered his cigarette.  Miss Satterly turned abruptly and went into the house, put on her hat and took up the little, tin lard-pail in which her aunt Meeker always packed her lunch.  She was back, had the key turned in the lock and was slowly pulling on her gloves by the time Weary recovered from his mirth.  \"Since you will not leave the place, I shall do so.  I want to say first, however, that I not only think you odious, but all the synonyms I mentioned besides.  You need not come for me to go to the Labor Day dance, because I will not go with you.  I shall go with Joe.\"  Weary gave her a startled glance and almost dropped his cigarette. This seemed going rather far, he thought--but of course she didn't really mean it; the schoolma'am, he heartened himself with thinking, was an awful, little bluffer.  \"Don't go off mad, Girlie.  I'm sorry I killed your gopher--on the dead, I am.  I just didn't think, That's a habit I've got--not thinking.  \"Say!  You stay, and we'll have a funeral.  It isn't every common, scrub gopher that can have a real funeral with mourners and music when he goes over the Big Divide.  He--he'll appreciate the honor; I would, I know, if it was me.\"  The schoolma'am took a few steps and stopped, evidently in some difficulty with her glove.  From the look of her, no human being was within a mile of her; she certainly did not seem to hear anything Weary was saying.  \"Say!  I'll sing a song over him, if you'll wait a minute.  I know two whole verses of 'Bill Bailey,' and the chorus to 'Good Old Summertime.' I can shuffle the two together and make a full deck.  I believe they'd go fine together.  \"Say, you never heard me sing, did yuh?  It's worth waiting for--only yuh want to hang tight to something when I start.  Come on--I'll let you be the mourner.\"  Since Miss Satterly had been taking steps quite regularly while Weary was speaking, she was now several rods away--and she had, more than ever, the appearance of not hearing him and of not wanting to hear.  \"Say, Tee-e-cher!\"  The schoolma'am refused to stop, or to turn her head a fraction of an inch, and Weary's face sobered a little.  It was the first time that inimitable \"Tee-e-cher\" of his had failed to bring the smile back into the eyes of Miss Satterly.  He looked after her dubiously.  Her shoulders were thrown well back and her feet pressed their imprint firmly into the yellow dust of the trail.  In a minute she would be quite out of hearing.  Weary got up, took a step and grasped Glory's trailing bridle-rein and hurried after her much faster than Glory liked and which he reproved with stiffened knees and a general pulling back on the reins.  \"Say!  You wouldn't get mad at a little thing like that, would yuh?\" expostulated Weary, when he overtook her.  \"You know I didn't mean anything, Girlie.\"  \"I do not consider it a little thing,\" said the schoolma'am, icily.  Thus rebuffed, Weary walked silently beside her up the hill--silently, that is, save for the subdued jingling of his spurs.  He was beginning to realize that there was an uncomfortable, heavy feeling in his chest, on the side where his heart was.  Still, he was of a hopeful nature and presently tried again.  \"How many times must I say I'm sorry, Schoolma'am?  You don't look so pretty when you're mad; you've got dimples, remember, and yuh ought to give 'em a chance.  Let's sit down on this rock while I square myself. Come on.\"  His tone was wheedling in the extreme.  Miss Satterly, not replying a word, kept straight on up the hill; and Weary, sighing heavily, followed.  \"Don't you want to ride Glory a ways?  He's real good, to-day.  He put in the whole of yesterday working out all the cussedness that's been accumulating in his system for a week, so he's dead gentle.  I'll lead him, for yuh.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Miss Satterly.  \"I prefer to walk.\"  Weary sighed again, but clung to his general hopefulness, as was his nature.  It took a great deal to rouse Weary; perhaps the schoolma'am was trying to find just how much.  \"Say, you'd a died laughing if you'd seen old Glory yesterday; he liked to scared Slim plumb to death.  We were working in the big corral and Slim got down on one knee to fix his spur.  Glory saw him kneel down, and gave a running jump and went clear over Slim's head.  Slim hit for the closest fence, and he never looked back till he was clean over on the other side.  Mamma!  I was sure amused.  I thought Glory had done about everything there was to do--but I tell yuh, that horse has got an imagination that will make him famous some day.\"  For the first time since the day of his spectacular introduction to her, Miss Satterly displayed absolutely no interest in the eccentricities of Glory.  Slowly it began to dawn upon Weary that she did not intend to thaw that evening.  He glanced at her sidelong, and his eyes had a certain gleam that was not there five minutes before. He swung along beside her till they reached the top of the hill, fell behind without a word and mounted Glory.  When he overtook Miss Satterly, he lifted his hat to her nonchalantly, touched up Glory with his spurs, and clattered away down the coulee, leaving the schoolma'am in a haze of yellow dust and bewilderment far in the rear.  The next morning Miss Satterly went very early to the school-house--for what purpose she did not say.  A meadow-lark on the doorstep greeted her with his short, sweet ripple of sound and then flew to a nearby sage bush and watched her curiously.  She looked about her half expectant, half disappointed.  A little, fresh mound marked the spot where the dead gopher had been, and a narrow strip of shingle stood upright at the end.  Someone had scratched the words with a knife:    GONE BUT NOT FORGOT.  Probably the last word would have been given its full complement of syllables, had the shingle been wider; as it was, the \"forgot\" was cramped until it was barely intelligible.  Miss Satterly, observing the mark of high-heeled boots in the immediate vicinity of the grave, caught herself wondering if the remains had been laid away to the tune of \"Bill Bailey,\" with the chorus of \"Good Old Summertime\" shuffled in to make a full deck.  She started to laugh and found that laughter was quite impossible.  Suddenly the schoolma'am did a strange thing.  She glanced about to make sure no one was in sight, knelt and patted the tiny mound very tenderly; then, stooping quickly, she pressed her lips impulsively upon the rude lettering of the shingle.  When she sprang up her cheeks were very red, her eyes dewy and lovely, and the little laugh she gave at herself was all atremble.  If lovers could be summoned as opportunely in real life as they are in stories, hearts would not ache so often and life would be quite monotonously serene.  Weary was at that moment twenty miles away, busily engaged in chastising Glory, that had refused point-blank to cross a certain washout.  His mind being wholly absorbed in the argument, he was not susceptible to telepathic messages from the Meeker school-house--which was a  pity.  Also, it was a pity he could not know that Miss Satterly lingered late at the school-house that night, doing nothing but watch the trail where it lay, brown and distinct and utterly deserted, on the top of the bill a quarter of a mile away.  It is true she had artfully scattered a profusion of papers over her desk and would undoubtedly have been discovered hard at work upon them and very much astonished at beholding him--if he had come.  It is probable that Weary would have found her quite unapproachable, intrenched behind a bulwark of dignity and correct English.  When the shadow of the schoolhouse stretched somberly away to the very edge of the coulee.  Miss Satterly gathered up the studied confusion on her desk, bundled the papers inside, and turned the key with a snap, jabbed three hatpins viciously through her hat and her hair and went home--and perhaps it were well that Weary was not there at that time.  The next night, papers strewed the desk as before, and the schoolma'am stood by the window, her elbows planted on the unpainted sill, and watched the trail listlessly.  Her eyes were big and wistful, like a hurt child's, and her cheeks were not red as usual, nor even pink.  But the trail lay again brown, and silent, and lonesome, with no quick hoof-beats to send the dust swirling up in a cloud.  The shadows flowed into the coulee until it was full to the brim and threatening the golden hilltop with a brown veil of shade before Miss Satterly locked her door and went home.  When she reached her aunt Meeker's she did not want any supper and she said her head ached.  But that was not quite true; it was not her head that ached so much; it was her heart.  The third day, the schoolma'am fussed a long time with her hair, which she did in four different styles.  The last style was the one which Weary had pronounced \"out uh sight\"--only she added a white chiffon bow which she had before kept sacred to dances and which Weary always admired.  At noon she encouraged the children to gather wild flowers from the coulee, and she filled several tin cans with water from the spring and arranged the bouquets with much care.  Weary loved flowers. Nearly every time he came he had a little bunch stuck under his hat-band.  A few she put in her hair, along with the chiffon bow.  She urged the children through their work and dismissed them at eleven minutes to four and told them to go straight home.  After she had swept the floor and dusted everything that could be dusted so that the school-room had the peculiar, immaculate emptiness and forlornness, like a church on a week day, and had taken a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14542"],["title","The Lonesome Trail and Other Stories (#5)"],["body","of the brightest flowers and pinned them upon her white shirt-waist.  Miss Satterly tuned her guitar in minor and went out and sat upon the shady doorstep and waited frankly, strumming plaintive little airs while she watched the trail.  To-morrow was Labor Day, and so he would certainly ride over to-night to see if she had really meant it (Miss Satterly did not explain to herself what \"it\" was; surely, there was no need).  At half-past five--Miss Satterly had looked at her watch seventeen times during the interval--a tiny cloud of dust rose over the brow of the hill, and her heart danced in her chest until she could scarce breathe.  The cloud grew and grew and began drifting down the trail, and behind it a black something rose over the hilltop and followed it, so proclaiming itself a horseman galloping swiftly towards her.  The color spread from the schoolma'am's cheeks to her brow and throat.  Her fingers forgot their cunning and plucked harrowing discords from the strings, but her lips were parted and smiling tremulously.  It was late--she had almost given up looking--but he was coming!  She knew be would come.  Coming at a breakneck pace--he must be pretty anxious, too.  The schoolma'am recovered a bit of control and revolved in her mind several pert forms of greeting.  She would not be too ready to forgive him--it would do him good to keep him anxious and uncertain for a while before she gave in.  Now he was near the place where he would turn off the main road and gallop straight to her.  Glory always made that turn of his own accord, lately.  Weary had told her, last Sunday, how he could never get Glory past that turn, any more, without a fight, no matter what might be the day or the hour.  Now he would swing into the school-house trail.  Miss Satterly raised both hands with a very feminine gesture and patted her hair tentatively, tucking in a stray lock here and there.  Her hands dropped heavily to her lap, just as the blood dropped away from her cheeks and the happy glow dulled in her eyes.  It was not Weary.  It was the Swede who worked for Jim Adams and who rode a sorrel horse which, at a distance, resembled Glory.  Mechanically she watched him go on down the trail and out of sight; picked up her guitar which had grown suddenly heavy, crept inside and closed the door and locked it She looked around the clean, eerily silent schoolroom, walked with echoing steps to the desk and laid her head down among the cans of sweet-smelling, prairie flowers and cried softly, in a tired, heartbreaking fashion that made her throat ache, and her head.  The shadows had flowed over the coulee-rim and the hilltops were smothered in gloom when Miss Satterly went home that night, and her aunt Meeker sent her straight to bed and dosed her with horrible home remedies.  By morning she had recovered her spirit--her revengeful spirit, which she kept as the hours wore on and Weary did not come.  She would teach him a lesson, she told herself often.  By evening, however, her mood softened.  There were many things that could have kept him away against his will; he was not his own master, and it was shipping time. Probably he had been out with the roundup, or something.  She decided that petty revenge is unwomanly besides giving evidence of a narrow mind and shallow, and if Weary could show a good and sufficient reason for staying away like that when there were matters to be settled between them, she would not be petty and mean about it; she would be divine--and forgive.     PART THREE  Weary was standing pensively by the door, debating with himself the advisability of going boldly over and claiming the first waltz with the schoolma'am--and taking a chance on being refused--when Cal Emmett gave him a vicious poke in the ribs by way of securing his attention.  \"Do yuh see that bunch uh red loco over there by the organ?\" he wanted to know.  \"That's Bert Rogers' cousin from Iowa.\"  Weary looked and wilted against the wall.  \"Oh, Mamma!\" he gasped.  \"Ain't she a peach?  There'll be more than one pair uh hands go into the air to-night.  It's a good thing Len got the drop on me first or I'd be making seven kinds of a fool uh myself, chances is.  Bert says she's bad medicine--a man-killer from away back.  \"Say, she's giving us the bad-eye.  Don't rubber like that, Weary; it ain't good manners, and besides; the schoolma'am's getting fighty, if I'm any judge.\"  Weary pulled himself together and tried to look away, but a pair of long blue eyes with heavy white lids drew him hypnotically across the room.  He did not want to go; he did not mean to go, but the first he knew he was standing before her and she was smiling up at him just as she used to do.  And an evil spell seemed to fall upon Weary, so that he thought one set of thoughts while his lips uttered sentences quite apart from his wishes.  He was telling her, for instance, that he was glad to see her; and he was not glad.  He was wishing the train which brought her to Montana had jumped the track and gone over a high cut-bank, somewhere.  She continued to smile up at him, and she called him Will and held out her hand.  When, squirming inward protest, he took it, she laid her left hand upon his and somehow made him feel as if he were in a trap. Her left hand was soft and plump and cool, and it was covered with rings that gave flashes and sparkles of light when she moved, and her nails were manicured to a degree not often seen in Dry Lake.  She drew her fingers caressingly over his hand and spoke to him in _italics_, in the way that had made many a man lose his head and say things extremely foolish.  Her name was Myrtle Forsyth, as Weary had cause to remember.  \"How strange to see you away out here,\" she murmured, and glanced to where the musicians were beginning to play little preparatory strains. \"Have you forgotten how to _waltz_, Will?  You used to dance so _well_!\"  What could a man do after a hint as broad as that one?  Weary held out his arm meekly, while mentally he was gnashing his teeth, and muttered something about her giving him a trial.  And she slipped her hand under his elbow with a proprietary air that was not lost upon a certain brown-eyed young woman across the hall.  Weary had said some hard things to Myrtle Forsyth when he talked with her last, away back in Iowa; he had hoped to heaven he never would see her again.  Now, she observed that he had not lost his good looks in grieving over her.  She decided that he was even better looking; there was an air of strength and a self poise that was very becoming to his broad shoulders and the six feet two inches of his height.  She thought, before the waltz was over, that she had made a mistake when she threw him over--a mistake which she ought to rectify at once.  Weary never knew how she managed it--in truth, he was not aware that she did it at all--but he seemed to dance a great many times with her of the long eyes and the bright auburn hair.  The schoolma'am seemed always to be at the farther end of the room, and she appeared to be enjoying herself very much and to dance incessantly.  Once he broke away from Miss Forsyth and went and asked Miss Satterly for the next waltz; but she opened her big eyes at him and assured him politely that she was engaged.  He tried for a quadrille, a two-step, a schottische--even for a polka, which she knew he hated; but the schoolma'am was, apparently, the most engaged young woman in Dry Lake that night.  So Weary owned himself beaten and went back to Miss Forsyth, who had been watching and learning many things and making certain plans.  Weary danced with her once and took a fit of sulking, when he stood over by the door and smoked cigarettes and watched moodily the whirling couples.  Miss Forsyth drifted to other acquaintances, which was natural; what was not so natural, to Weary's mind, was to see her sitting out a quadrille with the schoolma'am.  That did not look good to Weary, and he came near going over and demanding to know what they were talking about.  He was ready to bet that Myrt Forsyte, with that smile, was up to some deviltry--and he wished he knew what.  She reminded him somewhat of Glory when Glory was cloyed with peaceful living.  He even told himself viciously that Myrt Forsyth had hair the exact shade of Glory's, and it came near giving him a dislike of the horse.  The conversation in the corner, after certain conventional subjects had been exhausted, came to Miss Forsyth's desire something like this: She said how she loved to waltz,--with the right partner, that is.  Apropos the right partner, she glanced slyly from the end of her long eyes and remarked:  \"Will--Mr. Davidson--is an _ideal_ partner, don't you think?  Are you--but of _course_ you must be _acquainted_ with him, living in the same _neighborhood_?\"  Her inflection made a question of the declaration.  \"Certainly I am acquainted with Mr. Davidson,\" said Miss Satterly with just the right shade of indifference.  \"He does dance very well, though there are others I like better.\"  That, of course, was a prevarication. \"You knew him before tonight?\"  Miss Forsyth laughed that sort of laugh which may mean anything you like.  \"_Knew_ him?  Why, we were en--that is, we grew _up_ in the same _town_.  I was so perfectly _amazed_ to find him _here_, poor fellow.\"  \"Why poor fellow?\" asked Miss Satterly, the direct.  \"Because you found him? or because he is here?\"  The long eyes regarded her curiously.  \"Why, don't you _know_? Hasn't--hasn't it _followed_ him?\"  \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" said the schoolma'am, calmly facing the stare.  \"If you mean a dog, he doesn't own one, I believe.  Cowboys don't seem to take to dogs; they're afraid they might be mistaken for sheep-herders, perhaps--and that would be a disgrace.\"  Miss Forsyth leaned back and her eyes, half closed as they were, saw Weary away down by the door.  \"No, I didn't mean a _dog_.  I'm _glad_ if he has gotten _quite away_ from--he's such a _dear_ fellow!"]]]
