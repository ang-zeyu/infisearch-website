They were      finally bought for $600, and set free.       ADAM GIBSON, _Philadelphia, December 21, 1850_. Surrendered      by Edward D. Ingraham, United States Commissioner. The case      was hurried through in indecent haste, testimony being      admitted against him of the most groundless character. One      witness swore that Gibson's name was Emery Rice. He was taken      to Elkton, Maryland. There, Mr. William S. Knight, his      supposed owner, refused to receive Gibson, saying he was not      the man, and he was taken back to Philadelphia.  What compensation has the United States Government ever made to Adam Gibson, for the injurious act of its agent, Ingraham? Had not the Slaveholder been more honorable than the Commissioner or the makers of the Fugitive Law, Gibson would have been in Slavery for life.       HENRY LONG, _New York, December, 1850_. Brought before      Commissioner Charles M. Hall, claimed as the fugitive slave      of John T. Smith of Russell County, Virginia. After five or      six days' proceedings, there being some doubt of the      Commissioner's legal right to act, the alleged fugitive,      Long, was taken before Judge Judson, District Judge of the      United States. The Castle Garden Union Safety Committee      retained Mr. George Wood in this case, as counsel for the      slave claimant. Long was surrendered by Judge Judson, and      taken to Richmond, Virginia. Judge J. was complimented by the      _Washington Union_ as \"a clear-headed, competent, and      independent officer, who has borne himself with equal      discretion, liberality, and firmness. Such judges as he,\"      continues the _Union_, \"are invaluable in these times of      turmoil and agitation.\" At Richmond, Long was advertised to      be sold at public auction. On Saturday, January 18th, he was      sold, amid the jeers and scoffs of the spectators, for $750,      to David Clapton, of Georgia. The auctioneers (Pullam &      Slade), in commencing, said there was one condition of the      sale. Bonds must be given by the purchaser that this man      shall be carried South, and that he shall be kept South, and      sold, if sold again, to go South; and they declared their      intention to see the terms fully complied with. Long was      subsequently advertised for sale at Atlanta, Georgia.       _Near Coatsville, Chester County, Penn._ On a writ issued by      Commissioner Ingraham, Deputy Marshal Halzell and other      officers, with the claimant of an alleged fugitive, at night,      knocked at the door of a colored family, and asked for a      light to enable them to mend their broken harness. The door      being opened for this purpose, the marshal's party rushed in,      and said they came to arrest a fugitive slave. Resistance was      made by the occupant of the house and others, and the      marshal's party finally driven off--the slave owner advising      that course, and saying, \"Well, if this is a specimen of the      pluck of Pennsylvania negroes, I don't want my slaves back.\"      The master of the house was severely wounded in the arm by a      pistol shot; still he maintained his ground, declaring the      marshal's party should not pass except by first taking his      life.       _Marion, Williamson County, Ill., about December 10, 1850._      Mr. O'Havre, of the city police, Memphis, Tennessee, arrested      and took back to Memphis a fugitive slave, belonging to Dr.      Young. He did so, as the Memphis paper states, only \"after      much difficulty and heavy expense, being strongly opposed by      the Free Soilers and Abolitionists, but was assisted by Mr.      W. Allen, member of Congress, and other gentlemen.\"       _Philadelphia, about January 10, 1851._ G.F. Alberti and      others seized, under the Fugitive Slave Law, a free colored      boy, named JOEL THOMPSON, alleging that he was a slave. The      boy was saved.       STEPHEN BENNETT, _Columbia, Penn._, arrested as the slave of      Edward B. Gallup, of Baltimore. Taken before Commissioner      Ingraham; thence, by _habeas corpus_, before Judge Kane. He      was saved only by his freedom being purchased by his friends.       _The Huntsville (Ala.) Advocate_, of January 1, 1851, said      that Messrs. Markwood & Chester had brought back \"_seven of      their Slaves_\" from Michigan.       _The Memphis (Tenn.) Eagle_, of a later date, says that      within a few weeks \"at least five fugitive slaves have been      brought back to this city, from free States, with as little      trouble as would be had in recovering stray cows.\" The same      paper adds, \"We occasionally receive letters notifying us      that a slave, said to be the property of some one in this      vicinity, has been lodged in jail in Illinois or Indiana, for      his owner, who will please call, pay charges, and take him      away.\"       _In Boston, end of January, 1851._ A colored man, lately from      North Carolina, was sought by officers, under Marshal Devens,      aided by a lawyer, named Spencer, provided by the New York      Union Safety Committee. The arrest was not attempted. It was      found that the colored man was too strongly guarded and      protected.       Mrs. TAMOR, or EUPHEMIA WILLIAMS, _Philadelphia, February,      1851_, mother of six children, arrested and brought before      Commissioner Ingraham, as the slave Mahala, belonging to      William T.J. Purnell, of Worcester County, Maryland, admitted      to have been absent since 1829--twenty-two years. Children      all born in Pennsylvania; oldest about seventeen--a girl. Her      husband also in custody, and alleged to be the slave of      another man. Under writ of _habeas corpus_, Mrs. Williams was      taken before Judge Kane, of the United States Circuit Court.      After a full hearing, she was discharged, as not being the      woman alleged.       SHADRACH, _in Boston, February 15, 1851_. Arrested in Taft's      Cornhill Coffee House, by deputies of United States Marshal      Devens, on a warrant issued by George T. Curtis, United      States Commissioner, on the complaint of John Caphart,      attorney of John De Bree, of Norfolk, Va. Seth J. Thomas      appeared as counsel for Caphart. After a brief hearing before      G.T. Curtis, Commissioner, the case was adjourned to the      following Tuesday. Shortly after the adjournment, the      court-room was entered by a body of men, who bore away the      prisoner, Shadrach. After which he was heard of in Montreal,      Canada, having successfully, with the aid of many friends,      escaped the snares of all kidnappers, in and out of Boston.      The acting President, MILLARD FILLMORE, issued his      proclamation, countersigned by DANIEL WEBSTER, Secretary of      State, requiring prosecutions to be commenced against all who      participated in the rescue.       _Shawneetown, Illinois._ A woman was claimed by Mr. Haley,      of Georgia, as his slave; and was delivered up to him by two      Justices of the Peace, (early in 1851.)       _Madison, Indiana._ George W. Mason, of Davies County,      Kentucky, arrested a colored man, named MITCHUM, who, with      his wife and children, lived near Vernon. The case was tried      before a Justice of the Peace, named Basnett, who was      satisfied that Mitchum was Davis's slave, and had left his      service _nineteen years before_. The slave was accordingly      delivered up, and was taken to Kentucky, (Feb. 1851.)       _Clearfield County, Penn., about 20th January, 1851._ A      boy was kidnapped and taken into slavery.--_Mercer (Pa.)      Presbyterian_.       _Near Ripley, Ohio._ A fugitive slave, about January 20,      killed his pursuer. He was afterwards taken and carried back      to slavery.       _Burlington, Lawrence County, Ohio, near the end of February,      1851_, four liberated slaves were kidnapped, re-enslaved, and      sold. Efforts were made to bring the perpetrators of this      nefarious act to punishment, and restore the victims to      freedom.       _At Philadelphia, early in March, 1851_, occurred the case of      the colored woman HELEN or HANNAH, and her son, a child of      tender years. She was taken before a Commissioner, and      thence, by writ of _habeas corpus_, before Judge Kane. An      additional question arose from the fact that the woman would      soon become the mother of another child. Judge Kane decided      that she was the property of John Perdu, of Baltimore,      together with her son, and her unborn child, and they were      all surrendered accordingly, and taken into slavery.       _Pittsburg, March 13, 1851._ RICHARD GARDINER was arrested in      Bridgewater, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, claimed as the      property of Miss R. Byers, of Louisville, Kentucky. Judge      Irwin, of the United States District Court, \"remanded the      fugitive back to his owner.\" He was afterwards bought for      $600, and brought into a free State.       _The Wilmington (Del.) Journal_, in March, 1851, says      kidnapping has become quite frequent in that State; and      speaks of a negro kidnapped in that city, on the previous      Wednesday night, by a man who had been one of the city      watchmen.       THOMAS SIMS, arrested in _Boston_, April 4, 1851, at first on      pretence of a charge of theft. But when he understood it was      as a fugitive from slavery, he drew a knife and wounded one      of the officers. He was taken before Commissioner George T.      Curtis. To guard against a repetition of the Shadrach rescue,      the United States Marshal, Devens, aided by the Mayor (John      P. Bigelow) and City Marshal (Francis Tukey) of Boston,      surrounded the Court House, in Boston, with heavy chains,      guarded it by a strong extra force of police officers, with a      strong body of guards also within the building, where the      fugitive was imprisoned as well as tried. Several military"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13990"],["title","The Fugitive Slave Law and Its Victims (#3)"],["body","also were called out by the city authorities, and      kept in readiness night and day to act against the people,      should they attempt the deliverance of Sims; Faneuil Hall      itself being turned into barracks for these hirelings of      slavery. Every effort was made by S.E. Sewall, Esq., Hon.      Robert Rantoul, Jr., and Charles G. Loring, Esq., to save      Sims from being returned into slavery, and Boston from the      eternal and ineffaceable disgrace of the act. But in vain.      The omnipotent Slave Power demanded of Boston a victim for      its infernal sacrifices. Millard Fillmore, Daniel Webster,      and their numerous tools, on the Bench, in Commissioners'      seats, and other official stations, or in hopes of gaining      such stations bye and bye, had fallen upon their faces      before the monster idol, and sworn that the victim should      be prepared. Thomas Sims was ordered back to slavery by      Commissioner G.T. Curtis, and was taken from the Court House,      in Boston, early on the morning of April 11th, [1851,] to the      Brig Acorn, lying at the end of Long Wharf, and thence in the      custody of officers, to Savannah, Georgia.       There, after being lodged in jail, and severely and cruelly      whipped, as was reported, he was at length sold, and became      merged and lost in the great multitude of the enslaved      population. The surrender of Sims is said to have cost the      United States Government $10,000; the City of Boston about as      much more; and Mr. Potter, the claimant of Sims, about      $2,400, making a total of some $22,000, directly expended on      the case.       _Vincennes, Indiana, April, 1851._ Four fugitive slaves were      seized, claimed by one Mr. Kirwan, of or near Florence,      Alabama. The magistrate, named Robinson, gave up the      fugitives, and they were taken into slavery.       _In Salisbury Township, Penn., April, 1851_, an elderly man      was kidnapped and carried into Maryland.       _Near Sandy Hill, Chester County, Penn., in March, 1851_, a      very worthy and estimable colored man, named Thomas Hall, was      forcibly seized, his house being broken into by three armed      ruffians, who beat him and his wife with clubs. He was      kidnapped.       MOSES JOHNSON, _Chicago, Illinois_, brought before a United      States Commissioner, discharged as not answering to the      description of the man claimed.       CHARLES WEDLEY, kidnapped from _Pittsburg, Pennsylvania_, and      taken into Maryland. He was found, and brought back.       _Cincinnati, Ohio, June 3, 1851_, an attempt to arrest a      fugitive was made. But a scuffle ensued, in which the man      escaped.       _Cincinnati, Ohio._ About the same time, some slaves, (number      not stated,) belonging to Rev. Mr. Perry and others, of      Covington, Kentucky, were taken in Cincinnati, and carried      back to Kentucky.       _Philadelphia, end of June, 1851_, a colored man was taken      away as a slave, by steamboat. A writ of _Habeas Corpus_ was      got out but the officer could not find the man. This is      probably the same case with that of JESSE WHITMAN, arrested      at Wilkesbarre.       FRANK JACKSON, a free colored man in _Mercer, Penn._, was      taken, early in 1851, by a man named Charles May, into      Virginia, and sold as a slave. He tried to escape, but was      taken and lodged in Fincastle jail, Virginia.       THOMAS SCOTT JOHNSON, free colored man, of _New Bedford_, was      arrested near Portsmouth, Virginia, and was about to be sold      as a slave; but, by the strenuous interposition of Capt.      Card, certificates were obtained from New Bedford, and he was      set at liberty.       ELIZABETH WILLIAMS, _West Chester County, Penn._, delivered      into slavery by Commissioner Jones. (July, 1851.)       DANIEL HAWKINS, of _Lancaster County, Penn._, (July, 1851,)      was brought before Commissioner Ingraham, Philadelphia, and      by him delivered to his claimant, and he was taken into      slavery.       _New Athens, Ohio, July 8, 1851._ Eighteen slaves, who had      escaped from Lewis County, Kentucky, were discovered in      an old building in Adams County, Ohio. Some white men,      professing to be friendly, misled them, and brought them to a      house, where they were imprisoned, bound one by one, and      carried back to Kentucky. [The enactment of the Fugitive      Slave Law is the direct stimulating cause of all these cases      of kidnapping.]       _Buffalo, August, 1851._ Case of DANIEL ----. D. was a cook      on board the steamer \"Buckeye State.\" He was engaged in his      avocation, when Benj. S. Rust, with a warrant from United      States Commissioner H.K. Smith, went on board the boat.      Daniel was called up from below, and as his head appeared      above the deck, Rust struck him a heavy blow, upon the head,      with a large billet of wood, which knocked him back into the      cook-room, where he fell upon the stove and was badly burned.      In this state, he was brought before the Commissioner,      \"bleeding profusely at the back, of the head, and at the      nose, and was moreover so stupefied by the assault, that he      fell asleep several times during the brief and very summary      proceedings.\" For most of the time he was unable to converse      with his counsel, and \"sat dozing, with the blood slowly      oozing out of his mouth and nostrils.\" After a very hurried      form, and mockery of a trial, Daniel was ordered to be      delivered to Rust, the Agent of George H. Moore, of      Louisville, Kentucky. By a writ of _Habeas Corpus_, Daniel      was brought before Judge Coakling, of the United States      Court, at Auburn, who gave a decision that set Daniel at      liberty, and he was immediately hurried by his friends into      Canada. Rust was indicted, in Buffalo, for his brutal assault      on Daniel. It was fully proved; he afterwards plead guilty,      and; was let off with the paltry fine of fifty dollars.       JOHN BOLDING, _arrested in Poughkeepsie, New York_, claimed      as the property of Barret Anderson, of Columbia, S.C. Bolding      was a young man, of good character, recently married, and had      a small tailor's shop in P. He said he was told, when a boy,      that he was the son of a white man. He was tried before      United States Commissioner Nelson, who ordered him to be      delivered up to his claimants, and he was taken quietly from      the city to Columbia, S.C. The sum of $2,000 was raised in      New York, and paid to Bolding's owner, who had consented to      take that sum for him, and Bolding returned to his family in      Poughkeepsie.       _Christiana, Lancaster County, Penn., Sept. 1851._ Edward      Gorsuch, (represented as a very pious member of a Methodist      Church in Baltimore,) with his son Dickinson, accompanied by      the Sheriff of Lancaster County, Pa., and by a Philadelphia      officer named _Henry Kline_, went to Christiana to arrest      certain slaves of his, who, (as he had been privately      informed by a wretch, named Wm. M. Padgett,) were living      there. An attack was made upon the house, the slave-holder      declaring (as was said) that he \"would not leave the place      alive without his slaves.\" \"Then,\" replied one of them, \"you      will not leave here alive.\" Many shots were fired on both      sides, and the slave-hunter, Edward Gorsuch, was killed.       At a subsequent trial, a number of persons (nearly forty)      were committed to take their trial for \"treason against      the United States, by levying war against the same, in      resisting by force of arms the execution of the Fugitive      Slave Law.\" CASTNER HANWAY was of the number. After      suffering imprisonment and being subjected to great loss      of time and heavy expenses, they were all discharged.       _Syracuse, October 1, 1851._ JERRY, claimed as the slave of      John McReynolds, of Marion County, Missouri, was brought to      trial before Commissioner J.F. Sabine. He was rescued by a      large body of men from the officers who had him in custody,      and was next heard of in Canada.       _James R. Lawrence_, a lawyer of Syracuse, acted as counsel      for _James Lear_, attorney of McReynolds.  [N.B. Daniel Webster's prophecy was not fulfilled.]       _Columbia, Penn._, (fall of 1851.) Man named HENRY, arrested      as the slave of Dr. Duvall, of Prince George's County,      Maryland,--taken to _Harrisburg_, before United States      Commissioner McAllister and by him consigned to slavery.       _Judge Denning_, of Illinois, discharged a negro brought      before him as a fugitive slave, on the ground that the      Fugitive Slave Law was unconstitutional.       _Two alleged slaves arrested_ at _Columbia, Penn._, on      warrant of United States Commissioner McAllister,--claimed as      property of W.T. McDermott, of Baltimore. One was carried      into slavery, one escaped. (November, 1851.)       _Near New Philadelphia, Maryland_, a woman, married to a free      colored man, with whom she had lived ten years, was arrested      as the slave of a Mr. Shreve, of Louisville, Kentucky. She      was taken back to Kentucky.       RACHEL PARKER, free colored girl, kidnapped from house of      Joseph S. Miller, West Nottingham, Penn., by the \"notorious      Elkton Kidnapper, McCreary,\" Dec. 31, 1851. Mr. Miller      tracked the kidnappers to Baltimore, and tried to recover the      girl, but in vain. On his way home, he was induced to leave      the cars, and was undoubtedly murdered,--it was supposed in      revenge of the death of Gorsuch at Christiana. Mr. Miller's      body was found suspended from a tree. A suit was brought in      the Circuit Court of Baltimore County, for the freedom of      Rachel Parker, Jan. 1853. Over sixty witnesses, from      Pennsylvania, attended to testify to her being free-born, and      that she was not the person she was claimed to"]]]
