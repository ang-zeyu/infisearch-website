The dictum that we are affected only as we believe is open to grave doubt. We are often thrown into a state of trepidation simply through the power of the imagination. We are wise after the event, like Partridge at the play:       \"No, no, sir; ghosts don't appear in such dresses as      that neither... And if it was really a ghost, it could      do one no harm at such a distance, and in so much      company; and yet, if I was frightened, I am not the      only person.\"[6]  The supernatural which persisted always in legends handed down from one generation to another on the lips of living people, had not lost its power to thrill and alarm, and gradually worked its way back into literature. Although Gray and Collins do not venture far beyond the bounds of the natural, they were in sympathy with the popular feelings of superstitious terror, and realised how effective they would be in poetry.  Collins, in his _Ode on the Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands_, adjures Home, the author of _Douglas_, to sing:              \"how, framing hideous spells,   In Sky's lone isle, the gifted wizard-seer   Lodged in the wintry cave with Fate's fell spear   Or in the depths of Uist's dark forests dwells,   How they whose sight such dreary dreams engross   With their own vision oft astonished droop   When o'er the wintry strath or quaggy moss   They see the gliding ghosts unbodied troop.\"  Burns, in the foreword to _Halloween_ (1785), writes in the \"enlightened\" spirit of the eighteenth century, but in the poem itself throws himself whole-heartedly into the hopes and fears that agitate the lovers. He owed much to an old woman who lived in his home in infancy:    \"She had ... the largest collection in the country   of tales and songs concerning devils, ghosts, fairies,   brownies, witches, warlocks, spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles,   dead-lights, wraiths, apparitions, cantraips, giants, enchanted   towers, dragons and other trumpery. This   cultivated the latent seeds of poetry, but had so strong   an effect on my imagination, that to this hour, in my   nocturnal rambles, I sometimes keep a sharp look-out in   suspicious places; it often takes an effort of philosophy   to shake off these idle terrors.\"[7]  _Tam o' Shanter_, written for Captain Grose, was perhaps based on a Scottish legend, learnt at the inglenook in childhood, from this old wife, or perhaps    \"By some auld houlet-haunted biggin   Or kirk deserted by its riggin,\"  from Captain Grose himself, who made to quake:    \"Ilk ghaist that haunts auld ha' or chamer,   Ye gipsy-gang that deal in glamor,   And you, deep-read in hell's black grammar,          Warlocks and witches.\"  In it Burns reveals with lively reality the terrors that assail the reveller on his homeward way through the storm:    \"Past the birks and meikle stane   Where drunken Charlie brak's neck-bane;   And through the whins, and by the cairn   Where hunters fand the murdered bairn   And near the thorn, aboon the well   Where Mungo's mither hanged hersell.\"  For sheer terror the wild, fantastic witch-dance, seen through a Gothic window in the ruins of Kirk-Alloway, with the light of humour strangely glinting through, has hardly been surpassed. The Ballad-collections, beginning with Percy's _Reliques of Ancient English Poetry_ (1705), brought poets back to the original sources of terror in popular tradition, and helped to revive the latent feelings of awe, wonder and fear. In Coleridge's _Ancient Manner_ the skeleton-ship with its ghastly crew--the spectre-woman and her deathmate--the sensations of the mariner, alone on a wide, wide sea, seize on our imagination with irresistible power. The very substance of the poem is woven of the supernatural. The dream imagery is thrown into relief by occasional touches of reality--the lighthouse, the church on the cliff, the glimpses of the wedding, the quiet song of the hidden brook in the leafy month of June. We, like the mariner, after loneliness so awful that          \"God himself   Scarce seemèd there to be,\"  welcome the firm earth beneath our feet, and the homely sound of the vesper bell. In _Christabel_ we float dreamily through scenes as unearthly and ephemeral as the misty moonlight, and the words in which Coleridge conjures up his vision fall into music of magic beauty. The opening of the poem creates a sense of foreboding, and the horror of the serpent-maiden is subtly suggested through her effect on Christabel. Coleridge hints at the terrible with artistic reticence. In _Kubla Khan_ the chasm is:    \"A savage place! as holy and enchanted   As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted   By woman wailing for her demon-lover.\"  The poetry of Keats is often mysterious and suggestive of terror. The description of the Gothic hall in _The Eve of St. Agnes_:    \"In all the house was heard no human sound;   A chain-drooped lamp was flickering by each door;   The arras, rich with horseman, hawk and hound,   Fluttered in the besieging wind's uproar;   And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor;\"  the serpent-maiden, Lamia, who    \"Seemed at once some penanced lady elf,   Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self;\"  the grim story in _Isabella_ of Lorenzo's ghost, who    \"Moaned a ghostly undersong   Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briers along.\"  all lead us over the borderland. In a rejected stanza of the _Ode on Melancholy_, he abandons the horrible:    \"Though you should build a bark of dead men's bones   And rear a phantom gibbet for a mast,   Stitch shrouds together for a sail, with groans   To fill it out, blood-stained and aghast;   Although your rudder be a dragon's tail   Long severed, yet still hard with agony,   Your cordage, large uprootings from the skull   Of bald Medusa, certes you would fail   To find the Melancholy--\"  Keats's melancholy is not to be found amid images of horror:    \"She dwells with Beauty--Beauty that must die,   And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips   Bidding adieu.\"  In _La Belle Dame sans Merci_ he conveys with delicate touch the memory of the vision which haunts the knight, alone and palely loitering. We see it through his eyes:    \"I saw pale kings and princes too,   Pale warriors, death-pale were they all:   They cried--'La Belle Dame sans Merci   Hath thee in thrall!'    \"I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam   With horrid warning gaped wide,   And I awoke and found me here,   On the cold hill's side.\"  From effects so exquisitely wrought as these it seems almost profane to turn to the crude attempts of such poets as \"Monk\" Lewis or Southey to sound the note of terror. Yet they too, in their fashion, played a part in the \"Renascence of Wonder.\" Coleridge, fascinated by the spirit of \"gramarye\" in Bürger's _Lenore_, etherealised and refined it. Scott and Lewis gloried in the gruesome details and spirited rhythm of the ballad, and in their supernatural poems wish to startle and terrify, not to awe, their readers. Those who revel in phosphorescent lights and in the rattle of the skeleton are apt to o'erleap themselves; and Scott's _Glenfinlas_, Lewis's _Alonzo the Brave and the Fair Imogene_ and Southey's _Old Woman of Berkeley_ fall into the category of the grotesque. Hogg intentionally mingles the comic and the terrible in his poem, _The Witch of Fife_, but his prose-stories reveal his power of creating an atmosphere of _diablerie_, undisturbed by intrusive mockery. In the poem _Kilmeny_, he handles an uncanny theme with dreamy beauty.  From the earliest times to the present day, writers of fiction have realised the force of supernatural terror. In the _Babylonica_ of Iamblichus, the lovers evade their pursuers by passing as spectres; the scene of the romance is laid in tombs, caverns, and robbers' dens, a setting remarkably like that of Gothic story. Into the English novel of the first half of the eighteenth century, however, the ghost dares not venture. The innate desire for the marvellous was met at this period not by the novel, but by oral tradition and by such works as Galland's translation of _The Arabian Nights_, the Countess D'Aulnoy's collection of fairy tales, Perrault's _Contes de ma Mère Oie_. Chapbooks setting forth mediaeval legends of \"The Wandering Jew,\" the \"Demon Frigate,\" or \"Dr. Faustus,\" and interspersed with anecdotes of freaks, monsters and murderers, satisfied the craving for excitement among humbler readers.[8] Smollett, who, in his _Adventures of Ferdinand, Count Fathom_ (1753), seems to have been experimenting with new devices for keeping alive the interest of a _picaresque_ novel, anticipates the methods of Mrs. Radcliffe. Although he sedulously avoids introducing the supernatural, he hovers perilously on the threshold. The publication of _The Castle of Otranto_ in 1764 was not so wild an adventure as Walpole would have his readers believe. The age was ripe for the reception of the marvellous.  The supernatural had, as we have seen, begun to find its way back into poetry, in the work of Gray and Collins. In Macpherson's _Ossian_, which was received with acclamation in 1760-3, the mountains, heaths and lakes are haunted by shadowy, superstitious fears. Dim-seen ghosts wail over the wastes. There is abundant evidence that \"authentic\" stories of ghostly appearances were heard with respect. Those who eagerly explored Walpole's Gothic castle and who took pleasure in Miss Reeve's well-trained ghost, had previously enjoyed the thrill of chimney corner legends. The idea of the gigantic apparition was derived, no doubt, from the old legend of the figure seen by Wallace on the field of battle. The limbs, strewn carelessly about the staircase and the gallery of the castle, belong to a giant, very like those who are worsted by the heroes of popular story. Godwin, in an unusual flight of fancy, amused himself by tracing a certain similitude between _Caleb Williams_ and _Bluebeard_, between _Cloudesley_ and _The Babes in the Wood_,[9] and planned a story, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14154"],["title","The Tale of Terror: A Study of the Gothic Romance (#3)"],["body","the analogy of the Sleeping Beauty, in which the hero was to have the faculty of unexpectedly falling asleep for twenty, thirty, or a hundred years.[10]  Mrs. Radcliffe, who, so far as we may judge, did not draw her characters from the creatures of flesh and blood around her, seems to have adopted some of the familiar figures of old story. Emily's guardian, Montoni, in _The Mysteries of Udolpho_, like the unscrupulous uncle in Godwin's _Cloudesley_, may well have been descended from the wicked uncle of the folk tale. The cruel stepmother is disguised as a haughty, scheming marchioness in _The Sicilian Romance_. The ogre drops his club, assumes a veneer of polite refinement and relies on the more gentlemanlike method of the dagger and stiletto for gaining his ends. The banditti and robbers who infest the countryside in Gothic fiction are time honoured figures. Travellers in Thessaly in Apuleius' _Golden Ass_, like the fugitives in Shelley's _Zastrozzi_ and _St. Irvyne_, find themselves in robbers' caves. The Gothic castle, suddenly encountered in a dark forest, is boldly transported from fairyland and set down in Italy, Sicily or Spain. The chamber of horrors, with its alarming array of scalps or skeletons, is civilised beyond recognition and becomes the deserted wing of an abbey, concealing nothing worse than one discarded wife, emaciated and dispirited, but still alive. The ghost-story, which Ludovico reads in the haunted chamber of Udolpho, is described by Mrs. Radcliffe as a Provençal tale, but is in reality common to the folklore of all countries. The restless ghost, who yearns for the burial of his corpse, is as ubiquitous as the Wandering Jew. In the _Iliad_ he appears as the shade of Patroclus, pleading with Achilles for his funeral rites. According to a letter of the younger Pliny,[11] he haunts a house in Athens, clanking his chains. He is found in every land, in every age. His feminine counterpart presented herself to Dickens' nurse requiring her bones, which were under a glass-case, to be \"interred with every undertaking solemnity up to twenty-four pound ten, in another particular place.\"[12] Melmoth the Wanderer, when he becomes the wooer of Immalee, seems almost like a reincarnation of the Demon Lover. The wandering ball of fire that illuminates the dusky recesses of so many Gothic abbeys is but another manifestation of the Fate-Moon, which shines, foreboding death, after Thorgunna's funeral, in the Icelandic saga. The witchcraft and demonology that attracted Scott and \"Monk\" Lewis, may be traced far beyond Sinclair's _Satan's Invisible World Discovered_ (1685), Bovet's _Pandemonium or the Devil's Cloyster Opened_ (1683), or Reginald Scot's _Discovery of Witchcraft_ (1584) to Ulysses' invocation of the spirits of the dead,[13] to the idylls of Theocritus and to the Hebrew narrative of Saul's visit to the Cave of Endor. There are incidents in _The Golden Ass_ as \"horrid\" as any of those devised by the writers of Gothic romance. It would, indeed, be no easy task to fashion scenes more terrifying than the mutilation of Socrates in _The Golden Ass_, by the witch, who tears out his heart and stops the wound with a sponge which falls out when he stoops to drink at a river, or than the strange apparition of a ragged, old woman who vanishes after leading the way to the room, where the baker's corpse hangs behind the door. Though the title assumes a special literary significance at the close of the eighteenth century, the tale of terror appeals to deeply rooted instincts, and belongs, therefore, to every age and clime.     CHAPTER II - THE BEGINNINGS OF GOTHIC ROMANCE.   To Horace Walpole, whose _Castle of Otranto_ was published on Christmas Eve, 1764, must be assigned the honour of having introduced the Gothic romance and of having made it fashionable. Diffident as to the success of so \"wild\" a story in an age devoted to good sense and reason, he sent forth his mediaeval tale disguised as a translation from the Italian of \"Onuphrio Muralto,\" by William Marshall. It was only after it had been received with enthusiasm that he confessed the authorship. As he explained frankly in a letter to his friend Mason: \"It is not everybody that may in this country play the fool with impunity.\"[14] That Walpole regarded his story merely as a fanciful, amusing trifle is clear from the letter he wrote to Miss Hannah More reproving her for putting so frantic a thing into the hands of a Bristol milkwoman who wrote poetry in her leisure hours.[15] _The Castle of Otranto_ was but another manifestation of that admiration for the Gothic which had found expression fourteen years earlier in his miniature castle at Strawberry Hill, with its old armour and \"lean windows fattened with rich saints.\"[16] The word \"Gothic\" in the early eighteenth century was used as a term of reproach. To Addison, Siena Cathedral was but a \"barbarous\" building, which might have been a miracle of architecture, had our forefathers \"only been instructed in the right way.\"[17] Pope in his _Preface to Shakespeare_ admits the strength and majesty of the Gothic, but deplores its irregularity. In _Letters on Chivalry and Romance_, published two years before _The Castle of Otranto_, Hurd pleads that Spenser's _Faerie Queene_ should be read and criticised as a Gothic, not a classical, poem. He clearly recognises the right of the Gothic to be judged by laws of its own. When the nineteenth century is reached the epithet has lost all tinge of blame, and has become entirely one of praise. From the time when he began to build his castle, in 1750, Walpole's letters abound in references to the Gothic, and he confesses once: \"In the heretical corner of my heart I adore the Gothic building.\"[18] At Strawberry Hill the hall and staircase were his special delight and they probably formed the background of that dream in which he saw a gigantic hand in armour on the staircase of an ancient castle. When Dr. Burney visited Walpole's home in 1786 he remarked on the striking recollections of _The Castle of Otranto_, brought to mind by \"the deep shade in which some of his antique portraits were placed and the lone sort of look of the unusually shaped apartments in which they were hung.\"[19] We know how in idle moments Walpole loved to brood on the picturesque past, and we can imagine his falling asleep, after the arrival of a piece of armour for his collection, with his head full of plans for the adornment of his cherished castle. His story is but an expansion of this dilettante's nightmare. His interest in things mediaeval was not that of an antiquary, but rather that of an artist who loves things old because of their age and beauty. In a delightfully gay letter to his friend, George Montagu, referring flippantly to his appointment as Deputy Ranger of Rockingham Forest, he writes, after drawing a vivid picture of a \"Robin Hood reformé\":       \"Visions, you know, have always been my pasture; and so      far from growing old enough to quarrel with their      emptiness, I almost think there is no wisdom comparable      to that of exchanging what is called the realities of      life for dreams. Old castles, old pictures, old      histories and the babble of old people make one live      back into centuries that cannot disappoint one. One      holds fast and surely what is past. The dead have      exhausted their power of deceiving--one can trust      Catherine of Medicis now. In short, you have opened a      new landscape to my fancy; and my lady Beaulieu will      oblige me as much as you, if she puts the long bow into      your hands. I don't know, but the idea may produce some      other _Castle of Otranto_.\"[20]  So Walpole came near to anticipating the greenwood scenes of _Ivanhoe_. The decking and trappings of chivalry filled him with boyish delight, and he found in the glitter and colour of the middle ages a refuge from the prosaic dullness of the eighteenth century. A visit from \"a Luxembourg, a Lusignan and a Montfort\" awoke in his whimsical fancy a mental image of himself in the guise of a mediaeval baron: \"I never felt myself so much in _The Castle of Otranto_. It sounded as if a company of noble crusaders were come to sojourn with me before they embarked for the Holy Land\";[21] and when he heard of the marvellous adventures of a large wolf who had caused a panic in Lower Languedoc, he was reminded of the enchanted monster of old romance and declared that, had he known of the creature earlier, it should have appeared in _The Castle of Otranto_.[22] \"I have taken to astronomy,\" he declares on another occasion,       \"now that the scale is enlarged enough to satisfy my      taste, who love gigantic ideas--do not be afraid; I am      not going to write a second part to _The Castle of      Otranto_, nor another account of the Patagonians who      inhabit the new Brobdingnag planet.\"[23]  These unstudied utterances reveal, perhaps more clearly than Walpole's deliberate confessions about his book, the mood of irresponsible, light-hearted gaiety in which he started on his enterprise. If we may rely on Walpole's account of its composition, _The Castle of Otranto_ was fashioned rapidly in a white heat of excitement, but the creation of the story probably cost him more effort than he would have us believe. The result, at least, lacks spontaneity. We never feel for a moment that we are living invisible amidst the characters, but we sit aloof like Puck, thinking: \"Lord, what fools these mortals be!\" His supernatural machinery is as undignified as the pantomime properties of Jack the Giant-killer. The huge body scattered piecemeal about the castle, the unwieldy sabre borne by a hundred men, the helmet \"tempestuously agitated,\" and even the \"skeleton in a hermit's cowl\" are not only unalarming but mildly ridiculous. Yet to the readers of his day the story was captivating and entrancing. It satisfied a real craving for the romantic and marvellous. The first edition of five hundred"]]]
