Then, after a moment's silence, in which Zoe's face was turned from him so that he could not see its expression, \"Won't you go now, and ask if Miss Deane is any easier? Surely, as her hostess, you should do so much.\"  \"No, I won't! I'll do all I can to make her comfortable; I'll provide her with society more agreeable to her than mine; I'll see that she has interesting reading-matter, if she wants it; I'll do any thing and every thing I can, except that; but you needn't ask that of me.\"  \"O Zoe! I had thought you would do a harder thing than that at my request,\" he said reproachfully.  Ignoring his remark, she went on, \"I just believe she fell and hurt herself purposely, that she might have an excuse for prolonging her visit, and continuing to torment me.\"  \"Zoe, Zoe, how shockingly uncharitable you are!\" he exclaimed. \"I could never have believed it of you! We are told, 'Charity thinketh no evil.' Do try not to judge so harshly.\"  He left the room; and Zoe indulged in a hearty cry, but hastily dried her eyes, and turned her back toward the door, as she heard his step approaching again.  He just looked in, saying, \"Zoe, I am going to drive over to Roselands for Ella: will you go along?\"  \"No. I've been lectured enough for one day,\" was her ungracious rejoinder; and he closed the door, and went away.  He was dumb with astonishment and pain. \"What has come over her?\" he asked himself. \"She has always before been so delighted to go any and every where with me. Have I been too ready to reprove her of late? I have thought myself rather forbearing, considering how much ill-temper she has shown. She has had provocation, to be sure; but it is high time she learned to exercise some self-control. Yet perhaps I should have been more sympathizing, more forbearing and affectionate.\"  He had stepped into his carriage, and was driving down the avenue. He passed through the great gates, and turned into the road, still thinking of Zoe, and mentally reviewing their behavior toward each other since the unfortunate day in which Miss Deane had crossed their threshold.  The conclusion he presently arrived at was, that he had not been altogether blameless; that, if his reproofs had been given in more loving fashion, they would have been received in a better spirit; that he had not been faithful to his promise always to try \"love and coaxing\" with the impulsive, sensitive child-wife, who, he doubted not, loved him with her whole heart; and, once convinced of that, he determined to say so on his return, and make it up with her.  True, it seemed to him that she ought to make the first advances toward an adjustment of their slight differences (quarrels they could scarcely be called; a slight coldness, a cessation of accustomed manifestations of conjugal affection, a few sharp or impatient words on each side), but he would be too generous to wait for that; he loved her dearly enough to sacrifice his pride to some extent; he could better afford that than the sight of her unhappiness.  In the mean time Zoe was bitterly repenting of the rebuff she had given him. He had hardly closed the door when she started up, and ran to it to call him back, apologize for her curt refusal to go with him, and ask if she might still accept his invitation. But it was too late: he was already beyond hearing.  She could not refrain from another cry, and was very angry with herself for her petulance. She regretted the loss of the drive, too, which would have been a real treat after the week of confinement to the house.  She had refused to comply with her husband's request that she would go to Miss Deane and ask how she was: now she repented, and went as soon as she had removed the traces of her tears.  \"Ah! you have come at last!\" was the salutation she received on entering the room where Miss Deane lay on a sofa, with the injured limb propped upon pillows. \"I began to fear,\" sweetly, \"that your delicate nerves had given way under the sight of my sufferings.\"  \"My nerves are not delicate,\" returned Zoe coldly; \"in fact, I never discovered that I had any; so please do not trouble yourself with anxiety on that account. I trust the applications have relieved you somewhat.\"  \"Very little, thank you. I suppose it was hardly to be expected that they would take effect so soon. Ah, me!\" she added with a profound sigh, \"I fear I am tied to this couch for weeks.\"  \"No; do not disturb yourself with that idea,\" said Zoe. \"The doctor told me you could easily be taken home in a few days in an ambulance.\"  \"I shall certainly avail myself of the first opportunity to do so,\" said Miss Deane, her eyes flashing with anger, \"for I plainly perceive that I have worn out my welcome.\"  \"No, not at all,\" said Zoe; \"at least, not so far as I am concerned.\" Miss Deane looked her incredulity and surprise, and Zoe explained,--\"I think I may as well be perfectly frank with you,\" she said. \"You have not worn out your welcome with me, because I had none for you when you came. How could I, knowing that you invariably make trouble between my husband and myself?\"  \"Truly, a polite speech to make to a guest!\" sniffled Miss Deane. \"I hope you pride yourself on your very polished manners.\"  \"I prefer truth and sincerity.\" said Zoe, \"I shall do all I can to make you comfortable while you are here; and, if you choose to avoid the line of conduct I have objected to, we may learn to like each other. I very well know that you do not love me now.\"  \"Since frankness is in fashion at this moment,\" was the contemptuous retort, \"I will own that there is no love lost between us. Stay,\" as Zoe was about to leave the room, \"let me give you a piece of disinterested advice. Learn to control your quick temper, and show yourself more amiable, or you may find one of these days, when it is too late, that you have lost your husband's heart.\"  At that, Zoe turned away, and went swiftly from the room. She was beyond speaking, her whole frame quivering from head to foot with the agitation of her feelings.  Lose the love of her idolized husband? That would be worse than death. But it should never be: he loved her dearly now (it could not be possible that these last few wretched days had robbed her quite of the devoted affection she had known beyond a doubt to be hers before); and she would tell him, as soon as he came in, how sorry she was for the conduct that had vexed him, and never, no, never again, would she do or say any thing to displease him, or lower herself in his estimation.  As she thought thus, hurrying down the hall, she caught the sound of wheels on the drive, and ran out, expecting to see him, as it was about time for his return from Roselands.  It was the Ion carriage she had heard, but only Ella Conly alighted from it.  They exchanged greetings, then Zoe asked half breathlessly, \"Where's Edward?\"  \"Gone,\" Ella responded, moving on into the hall. \"Come, let's go into the parlor, and sit down, and I'll tell you all I know about it. Why, Zoe,\" as she turned and caught sight of her companion's face, \"you are as pale as death, and look ready to faint! There's nothing to be scared about, and you mustn't mind my nonsense.\"  \"Oh, tell me! tell me quickly!\" gasped Zoe, sinking into a chair, her hands clasped beseechingly, her eyes wild with terror: \"what, what has happened?\"  \"Nothing, child, nothing, except that we met cousin Horace on our way here, and he carried Ned off to Union. They had to hurry to catch a train, in order to be in time for some business matter in the city, I didn't understand what: so Ned couldn't wait to write the least bit of a note to tell you about it; and he told me to explain every thing to you, and say you were not to fret or worry, not even if he shouldn't get home to-night; for he might not be able to finish up the business in time for even the last train that would bring him.\"  The color had come back to Zoe's cheek, but her countenance was still distressed; and as Ella concluded, two scalding tears rolled quickly down her face, and plashed upon the small white hands lying clasped in her lap.  \"Dear me!\" said Ella, \"how fond you are of him!\"  \"Yes,\" said Zoe, with a not very successful effort to smile through her tears: \"who wouldn't be, in my place? I owe every thing to Ned, and he pets and indulges me to the greatest extent. Besides, he is so good, noble, and true, that any woman might be proud to be his wife.\"  \"Yes: I admit every word of it; but all that doesn't explain your tears,\" returned Ella, half sympathizingly, half teasingly. \"Now, I should have supposed that anybody who could boast of such a piece of perfection for a husband would be very happy.\"  \"But I--we've hardly ever been separated over night,\" stammered Zoe, blushing rosy red; \"and--and--O Ella! I hadn't a chance to say good-by to him, and--and you know accidents so often happen\"--  She broke down with a burst of tears and sobs that quite dismayed her cousin.  \"Why, Zoe, I'm afraid you cannot be well,\" she said. \"Come, cheer up, and don't borrow trouble.\"  \"I'm afraid I'm very silly, and have been making you very uncomfortable,\" said Zoe, hastily wiping away her tears, \"and it's a great shame; particularly, considering that you have kindly come on purpose to help me through with a disagreeable task.  \"I'll show you to your room now, if you like,\" she added, rising, \"and try to behave myself better during the rest of your visit.\"  \"Apologies are quite uncalled for,\" returned Ella lightly, as they went up-stairs together. \"I have always had a good time at Ion, and don't believe this is going to be an exception to the general rule. But do you know,\" lowering her voice a little, \"I don't propose to spend nearly all my time with that hateful Miss Deane. I never could bear her.\"  \"Then, how good it was in you to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14488"],["title","Elsie's Kith and Kin (#6)"],["body","come!\" exclaimed Zoe gratefully. \"But I should never have asked it of you, if I had thought you disliked her as well as I.\"  They were now in the room Ella was to occupy, and she was taking off her hat and cloak. \"Oh, never mind! I was delighted to come anyhow,\" she answered gayly, as she threw aside the latter garment, and took possession of an easy-chair beside the open fire. \"To tell you a secret,\" she went on laughingly, \"I like my cousins Ned and Zoe Travilla immensely, and am always glad of an excuse to pay them a visit. But that Miss Deane,--oh! she's just _too sweet_ for _any thing!_\" making a grimace expressive of disgust and aversion, \"and a consummate, incorrigible flirt: any one of the male sex can be made to serve her turn, from a boy of sixteen to a man of seventy-five.\"  \"I think you are correct about that,\" said Zoe. \"And, do you know, she is forever making covert sneers at my youth; and it's perfectly exasperating to me.\"  \"Sour grapes,\" laughed Ella. \"I wouldn't let it vex me in the least: it's all to hide her envy of you, because you are really young, and married too. I know very well she's dreadfully afraid of being called an old maid.\"  \"I suspected as much,\" Zoe remarked. \"But don't you think gentlemen are more apt to be pleased with her than ladies?\"  \"Yes: they don't see through her as her own sex do. And she is handsome, and certainly a brilliant talker. I'd give a good deal for conversational powers equal to hers.\"  \"So would I,\" Zoe said, with an involuntary sigh.  Ella gave her a keen, inquiring look; and Zoe flushed hotly under it.  \"Shall we go down now?\" she asked. \"It is nearly dinner-time; and we shall have to dine alone unless some one drops in unexpectedly,\" she added, as they left the room together, and passed down the stairs, arm in arm.  \"If Arthur should, wouldn't it be a trial to Miss Deane to have to dine in her own room?\" exclaimed Ella, with a gleeful laugh.  \"Why, what do you mean?\" asked Zoe, opening her eyes wide with surprise.  \"That she would not have the slightest objection to becoming Mrs. Dr. Conly.\"  \"But you don't think there's any danger?\" queried Zoe, by no means pleased with the idea of having the lady in question made a member of the family connection.  \"No, and I certainly hope not. It wouldn't be I that would want to call her sister,\" returned Ella emphatically.  \"I should think Art had sufficient penetration to see through her,\" said Zoe. \"But no; on second thoughts, I'm not so sure; for Ned will have it that it's more than half my imagination when I say she sneers at me.\"  \"That's too bad,\" said Ella. \"But Art is older than Ned by some years, and has probably had more opportunity to study character.\"  \"Yes,\" replied Zoe, speaking with some hesitation, not liking to admit that any one was wiser than her husband, little as she was inclined to own herself in the wrong when he differed from her.     CHAPTER V.  \"Is there no constancy in earthly things? No happiness in us, but what must alter?\"   Zoe drove over to the village in good season to meet the last train for that day, coming from the direction in which Edward had gone, ardently hoping he might be on board.  The carriage was brought to a stand-still near the depot; and she eagerly watched the arrival of the train, and scanned the little crowd of passengers who alighted from it.  But Edward was not among them, and now it was quite certain that she could not see him before another day.  Just as she reached that conclusion, a telegram was handed her:--  \"Can't be home before to-morrow or next day. Will return as soon as possible. E. TRAVILLA.\"  To the girl-wife the message seemed but cold and formal. \"So different from the way he talks to me when he is not vexed or displeased, as he hardly ever is,\" she whispered to herself with starting tears during the solitary drive back to Ion. \"I know it's silly--telegrams can't be loving and kind: it wouldn't do, of course--but I can't help feeling as if he is angry with me, because there's not a bit of love in what he says. And, oh, dear! to think he may be away two nights, and I'm longing so to tell him how sorry I am for being so cross this morning, and before that, too, and to have him take me in his arms and kiss me, and say all is right between us, that I don't know how to wait a single minute!\"  She reached home in a sad and tearful mood. Ella, however, proved so entertaining and mirth-provoking a companion, that the evening passed quickly, and by no means unpleasantly.  But when the two had retired to their respective apartments, Zoe felt very lonely, and said to herself that she would rather have Edward there, even silent and displeased, as he had been for several days past, than be without him.  Her last thought before falling asleep, and her first on awaking next morning, were of him.  \"Oh, dear!\" she sighed half aloud, as she opened her eyes, and glanced round the room, \"what shall I do if he doesn't come to-day? I'll have to stand it, of course; but what does a woman do who has no husband?\" And for the first time she began to feel some sympathy for Miss Deane, as a lonely maiden lady.  She thought a good deal about her unwelcome guest while attending to the duties of the toilet, and determined to treat her with all possible kindness during the remainder of her enforced stay at Ion. So, meeting, on her way to the breakfast-room, the old negress who had been given charge of Miss Deane through the night, she stopped her, and asked how her patient was.  \"Jes' pow'ful cross dis hyar mawnin', Miss Zoe,\" was the reply, in a tone of disgust. \"Dar isn't one ob de fambly dat would be makin' half de fuss ef dey'd sprained bofe dey's ankles. Doan ye go nigh her, honey, fear she bite yo' head off.\"  \"Indeed I sha'n't, Aunt Phillis, if there's any danger of that,\" laughed Zoe. \"But as she can't jump up and run after me, I think I shall be quite safe if I don't go within arm's-length of her sofa.\"  \"She's pow'ful cross,\" repeated Aunt Phillis: \"she done gone call dis chile up time an' again fru de night; an' when I ax her, 'Whar yo' misery at?' she say, 'In my ankle, ob c'ose, yo' ole fool you! Cayn't yo' hab nuff sense to change de dressin'?'\"  \"Who is that has been so polite and complimentary to you, Aunt Phillis?\" cried a merry voice in their rear.  Ella was descending the stairway at whose foot they stood, as they perceived, on turning at the sound of her voice.  \"Good-morning, cousin: how bright and well you are looking!\" said Zoe.  \"Just as I feel. And how are you, Mrs. Travilla? I trust you did not spend the night in crying over Ned's absence?\" was the gay rejoinder.  \"No, not nearly all of it,\" returned Zoe, catching her spirit of fun.  \"Mawnin', Miss Ella,\" said the old nurse, dropping a courtesy. \"'Twas de lady what sprain her foot yisteday I was talkin' bout to Miss Zoe.\"  \"Ah! how is she?\"  \"I doan' t'ink she gwine die dis day, Miss Ella,\" laughed the nurse, \"she so pow'ful cross; and dey do say folks is dat way when dey's gittin' bettah.\"  \"Yes, I have always heard it was a hopeful sign, if not an agreeable one,\" Ella remarked, \"Was that the breakfast-bell I heard just now?\"  \"Yes,\" said Zoe. \"I hope you feel ready to do justice to your meal?\"  As they seated themselves at the table, Zoe, glancing toward Edward's vacant chair, remarked, with a sigh, that it seemed very lonely to sit down without him.  \"Well, now,\" said Ella, \"I think it's quite nice to take a meal occasionally without the presence of anybody of the masculine gender.\"  \"Perhaps that is because you have never been married,\" said Zoe.  \"Perhaps so,\" returned her cousin, laughing; \"yet I don't think that can be all that ails me, for I have heard married women express the same opinion quite frequently. What shall we do with ourselves to-day, Zoe? I've no notion of devoting myself exclusively to Miss Deane's entertainment, especially if she is really as cross as reported.\"  \"No, indeed! I couldn't bear to let you, even if you were willing,\" replied Zoe with decision. \"I consented to your taking my place in that, only because I supposed you found her agreeable; while to me she is any thing else.\"  \"Suppose we call on her together, after a little, and let the length of our stay depend upon the enjoyment our presence seems to afford her,\" suggested Ella.  \"Agreed,\" said Zoe. \"Then I will supply her with plenty of reading-matter, which, as she professes to be so very intellectual, ought to entertain her far better than we can. Shall we ride after that?\"  \"Yes, and take a promenade on the verandas. We'll have to take our exercise in those ways, as the roads are not yet fit for walking.\"  \"Yes,\" said Zoe; \"but I hope that by afternoon they will be good enough for driving; as I mean to drive over to the depot to meet the late train, hoping to find Ned on it.\"  \"Don't expect him till to-morrow,\" said Ella.  \"Why not?\" queried Zoe, looking as if she could hardly endure the thought.  \"Because, in that case, your disappointment, if you have one, will be agreeable.\"  \"Yes; but, on the other hand, I should lose all the enjoyment of looking forward through the whole day, to seeing him this evening. Following your plan, I shouldn't have half so happy a day as if I keep to my own.\"   \"Ah! that's an entirely new view of the case,\" Ella said in her merry, laughing tones.  Miss Deane did not seem to enjoy their society, and they soon withdrew from her room; Zoe having done all in her power to provide her with every comfort and amusement available in her case.  \"I'm glad that's over,\" sighed Zoe, when they were alone again. \"And now for our ride, if you are ready, Ella. I ordered my pony for myself, and mamma's for you; and I see they are at the door.\"  \"Then let us don our riding-habits, and be off at once,\" said Ella.  \"Where are we going?\" she asked, as they cantered down the avenue.  \"To the village, if you like. I want to call at the post-office.\"  \"In hopes of finding a note from Ned, I suppose. I don'"]]]
