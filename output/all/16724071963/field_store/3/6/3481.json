It fell upon them like a bolt from the blue.  He remembered the afternoon. They had heard a very impassioned and very heated speech from the hon. member for Ficksburg on the enormous danger of squatting in the Free State, and that was the occasion for introducing a general statement of the policy of the Government towards the Natives and the introduction of this Bill.  He did not think that that was the way they liked to see a thing of this magnitude approached. They often heard demands for what was called a general declaration of policy with regard to native affairs -- a policy which should be applied to the highest civilized Native, the owner of a farm, and the naked barbarian. They could not do it.  People who demanded a general declaration of that kind had not had the experience which some of them had had. The hon. member who spoke before him said that he was in favour of the underlying principle of the Bill.  What was the underlying principle? The underlying principle was what one read into the Bill. One hon. member read into it that it was the separation of the two races. That might have been done when the two races first came in contact at the Fish River, but it could not be done now.  Since then they had been developing the country with the labour of these people. They had been advancing by our aid.  They had mixed themselves up with these people in an inextricable fashion and then some said \"Haul your native policy out of the drawer and begin with a policy of separation.\"  He was sure that the hon. member who had brought in the Bill had no idea of that sort in his mind. Another person had the idea that they were going to set up a sort of pale -- a sort of kraal in which they were going to drive these people. Then another gentleman sneered at the policy hitherto adopted, and he said that one side said that the policy towards the Natives should be firm and just, while the other side said that it should be just and firm.  It seemed to him that they had not got sufficient information. Beyond the bald statistics which were given by the Minister in the course of his interesting and moderate speech, they had nothing. They were going into a thing that would stir South Africa from end to end, and which affected hundreds of thousands of both races. They had no information as to what were the ideas of the Natives. It was unfortunate that, owing to this lack of information, wrong ideas had got about with regard to this Bill.  It was difficult to find out what the Native thought about these things; he doubted whether anybody could say that he had got at the mind of the Native. The only way, and he must say that he did not take it as a real indication, was what they wrote in their newspapers.  He was alarmed, but not surprised, at some of the articles in their newspapers, because they took their views from the heated speeches and writings in party newspapers all over the country, and they were very much alarmed.  He thought that before a Bill of this sort was passed, there should be some attempt made to get their views.  As far as one section was concerned, the Bill was going to set up a sort of pale -- that there was going to be a sort of kraal in which all the Natives were to be driven, and they were to be left to develop on their own lines.  To allow them to go on their own lines was merely to drive them back into barbarism; their own lines meant barbarous lines; their own lines were cruel lines. All along they had been bringing them away from their own lines. It reminded him of what an English writer said about a similar policy in Ireland, because when the English went to Ireland they regarded the Native Irish in the way some extreme people here regarded the Natives of South Africa.  They thought they would root them out. They treated them as dogs, and thought that they were dogs. They set up a pale.  They set the Irish within that pale, to develop upon their own lines, but there were always Englishmen living in that pale, just as in the same way they found Europeans living among Natives.  Sir George Davis in describing this policy wrote that it was the intention of the Government to set up a separation between English and Irish, intending in time that the English should root out the Irish.  If they changed the Irish for Natives they would see how the illustration would apply.  A policy more foredoomed to failure in South Africa could not be initiated.  It was a policy that would keep South Africa back, perhaps for ever.  (Hear, hear.) What would be the effect of driving these civilized Natives back into reserves?  At the present time, every civilized man -- if they treated him properly -- every civilized man was becoming an owner of land outside native reserve, and therefore he was an asset of strength to the country.  He was a loyalist. He was not going to risk losing his property.  He was on the side of the European.  If they drove these people back into reserve they became our bitterest enemies.  Therefore, he viewed anything that tended that way with the gravest suspicion.  Again, in this Bill there was not sufficient distinction between those Natives who tried to educate themselves and the ordinary raw barbarian. They were all classed under the word \"Native\".  He came now to what was the main object of the Bill, and that was: to do away with the squatting evil.  Why was there a squatting evil? Was it the fault of the Native?  (An hon. member:  No.) Was it the fault of the law?  (No.)  They had got the most stringent laws concerning Natives of all the laws in the whole country, in the Province of which his hon. friend (Mr. Keyter) was a member. He did not think anything was more surprising than when they came to look at the increases in the native population in the Orange Free State. They had a huge native population in the Cape, and the increase during the census periods from 1904 to 1911 -- he wanted hon. members to pay some attention to this, because it showed the value of legislation -- the increase in the Cape Province during that period was 8.33 per cent. In Natal, which had a huge -- in fact, an overwhelming -- native population, curiously enough, the increase was the same, even to the actual decimal figure, viz., 8.33 per cent.:  but some allowance must be made, because a large number of Natives were out at work in the mines. Now, in the Transvaal -- and in taking the Transvaal figures these did not apply as regarded squatting, because the increase was mainly due to the number of Natives employed in the mines.  In the Transvaal the Natives increased by 30.1 per cent.  Now, when they came to his friend's little State, where the most stringent laws were made to keep out the Natives, how much did they suppose the Natives increased in the Free State?  By no less than 44 per cent.  (Opposition cheers.) Was that the fault of the Natives?  No, it was because -- having the most stringent laws -- the people found it best to evade those laws.  (Hear, hear.)  He hoped his hon. friend would be a little tolerant.  Do let him pick the mote out of his own eye before he tried to pick the beam out of other people's.  (Hear, hear.) In the Free State these laws were very severe; for instance, punishments -- amazing punishments -- were given, and yet the result was the increase in five years by 44 per cent. of their native population. This was something that they should take a warning by.  They were going to do away with the squatter in appearance, but he would still survive as a labour tenant.  They might do away with the labour tenant, and he would still be surviving as a labour servant.  How was the Government to distinguish between these?  They had in the Cape a law which stated how many labour tenants a man should have upon his farm.  What they wanted in this country was administration and not more legislation, and if they were to put the laws which they had into force in the Free State at the present time he had no doubt that there would be a rebellion. (Hear, hear.)  They would have platforms swarming with people who would say that they could not grow one bag of mealies without the Natives. But they had the laws to do it.  Now they went and tried in this Bill to make a uniform law.  Turning towards the Minister, Mr. Merriman said: \"My poor friend! that after all the years we had laboured together he of all people should be the author of a uniform law on native matters! (Laughter.)  I say this more in sorrow than in anger -- (laughter) -- because the conditions were totally different in the four Provinces.\"  In the Free State, proceeded Mr. Merriman, the people had most excellent laws from their point of view for keeping out the Natives -- stringent, Draconian, and violent laws, but they were not carried out, and the Natives had flooded the country.  All they wanted to do was to turn the Native from a tenant to a labour tenant, and then salvation would be at hand.  He could not see very much difference between the two, except that one was a contented advancing man and the other a discontented man approaching very closely to the Russian serf -- he was a soul. Shortly we should hear of a farm being up for sale with so many souls.  In the Transvaal the problem had been complicated by the decisions of the Court and the curious way in which some ground had been given out in the Zoutpansberg district, where, he was told, farms had been given out on which the Natives had been living for years, and these farms -- with the Natives on them -- had come into the possession of companies and individuals, and now it was proposed to turn the Natives off.  That would not be an agreeable thing, but he would not offer an opinion now as to the justice of it.  He would like to revert to the state of things which had grown up under the Draconian laws of the Free"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1452"],["title","Native Life in South Africa (#7)"],["body","e.  According to a very interesting Blue-book containing reports of magistrates, one magistrate had reported that \"the pernicious system of squatting was detrimental to the working farmer, the Native reaping the whole of the benefit.\"  The man who worked generally reaped the whole benefit in the long run.  In the Harrismith district there were some 40,000 Natives against some 8,000 Europeans. How did they get there?  Having been a Free State burgher he knew that the Natives had not forced their way in. These Natives ploughed on the half-shares, and he would like to know whether they were labour tenants or squatters.  If they were squatters it would require very little dexterous management to convert them into labour tenants.  The Magistrate of Hoopstad, went on Mr. Merriman, had referred to the pernicious system of native squatters. But why did not the Free State magistrates do something and put the law in force?  That was the principal reason why the House was forced to pass that Bill without information, and without giving any opportunity to people who had the deepest interest in this matter to have their views heard, or to let them know what the House was going to do because the magistrates in the Free State would not enforce the law. He did think that was rather hard.  In conclusion Mr. Merriman said: I dare say I may have said a great many things which may be distasteful to my hon. friends, but I do claim their attention because at a time when they were not in such a dominant position as they are now, I pleaded for right and justice for them.  Therefore, they should not take it amiss from me, because now they are in a dominant position, I plead also for justice, toleration, moderation, and delay in this matter.  MR. H. MENTZ (Zoutpansberg) said the right hon. gentleman had earned their gratitude for the high tone in which he had carried the debate.  The speech which he had delivered was a most instructive one, and although the speaker was not in entire agreement with him on all points, he was in agreement on the point that the matter was one to be handled with prudence, but it was to be regretted that under the Bill a Commission was to be appointed.  The Minister should not listen to the request for a postponement of the question, by referring it to a Select Committee.  If they were to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, it would never be passed this year.  MR. G. L. STEYTLER (Rouxville) expressed his thanks to the Government for bringing forward the Bill.  He said he felt that it was not a complete solution of the whole question, but it was certainly a step in the right direction.  MR. A. FAWCUS (Umlazi) said that as the representative of 70,000 Natives in Natal, not one of whom so far as he knew had a vote, he should like, on their behalf, to thank the right hon. member for Victoria West for the manner in which he had handled this question. In the course of his speech the right hon. gentleman asked, what did the Natives think about this Bill before the House? His (Mr. Fawcus') opinion was that the Natives did not think anything at all about it.  He should not think there was one Native in a thousand in South Africa who was aware that this matter, so vitally affecting their future, was at present at issue.  The hon. member for Middelburg had referred to the Natives as \"schepsels\".*  He believed the day was rapidly passing away when we should refer to Natives as \"schepsels\".  They were an easy-going folk, and they thought little about title deeds and land laws.  So great was the Native's attachment to the land on which he lived, in many instances, that they could not rackrent him off it.  These were the people that the Bill wished to dispossess and drive off the land.  The figures placed before them showed that THE LAND HELD BY EUROPEANS PER HEAD WAS FIFTY TIMES THE AMOUNT HELD PER HEAD BY THE NATIVES.  Surely there was no need at the present time for legislation which would prevent Natives getting a little more land than they now had.  He did not think it could be put down to the fault of the Native if he was willing to buy and live on land rather than pay rent.  The figures given in this connexion were very instructive.  EIGHT ACRES PER HEAD WERE HELD BY THE NATIVES IN THE CAPE, SIX ACRES IN NATAL, ABOUT 1 1/2 ACRES in the Transvaal, and about one-third of an acre in the Free State.  He thought this Bill was perhaps coming on a little before there was any necessity for it.  -- * Creatures. --  MR. C. G. FICHARDT (Ladybrand) said he felt very much that the Bill that was before the House did not carry out all that should be carried out, and that was equality of justice. IF THEY WERE TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH THE NATIVES OF THIS COUNTRY, THEN ACCORDING TO POPULATION THEY SHOULD GIVE THEM FOUR-FIFTHS OF THE COUNTRY, OR AT LEAST A HALF.  How were they going to do that?  As he said in the earlier part of his remarks, he was prepared to accept the Bill as something to go on with, but he hoped that in the future it would not constitute a stumbling-block.  He would much rather have seen that the matter had been gone into more fully, and that some scheme had been laid before them so that they might have more readily been able to judge how the Bill would work.  It was because of all these difficulties that he felt that they could only accept the Bill if it laid down that there was no intention of taking the country from the white people and handing it over to the blacks.  MR. J. G. KEYTER (Ficksburg) said he wished to openly denounce, and most emphatically so, that the people or the Government of the Orange Free State had treated the coloured people unreasonably or unjustly, or in any way oppressively.  On the contrary, the O.F.S. had always treated the coloured people with the greatest consideration and the utmost justice. The O.F.S. had made what Mr. Merriman called stringent laws. He (Mr. Keyter) called them just laws.  They TOLD THE COLOURED PEOPLE PLAINLY THAT THE O.F.S. WAS A WHITE MAN'S COUNTRY, AND THAT THEY INTENDED TO KEEP IT SO.  (Hear, hear.)  THEY TOLD THE COLOURED PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY OR HIRE LAND, and that they were not going to tolerate an equality of whites and blacks; and he said that they were not going to tolerate that in the future, and if an attempt were made to force that on them, they would resist it at any cost to the last,* for if they did tolerate it, they would very soon find that they would be a bastard nation. His experience was that the Native should be treated firmly, kept in his place and treated honestly.  They should not give him a gun one day and fight him for it the next day.  They should tell him, as the Free State told him, that IT WAS A WHITE MAN'S COUNTRY, THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO BUY LAND THERE OR TO HIRE LAND THERE, AND THAT IF HE WANTED TO BE THERE HE MUST BE IN SERVICE.  -- * By passing the Bill, the Government conceded all the extravagant demands   of the \"Free\" Staters; yet, a year later they took up arms   against the Government. --  MR. J. A. P. VAN DER MERWE (Vredefort) deprecated sending the Bill to a Select Committee, arguing that the House itself should decide it. He referred to the difficulties experienced by farmers in the Free State. If a farmer refused to allow a Native to farm on the share system he simply refused to work.  There were thousands of Natives on the farms there who hired ground and did little work.  The farmers had to keep their children at home to do the work.  Some of the Natives hired ground, did some sowing, then went to work in Johannesburg, and paid the owner of the farm half what he reaped from the harvest.  That was not satisfactory. He was pleased to see the provisions the Minister proposed to make in this regard, and expressed the hope that the Native would only be tolerated among the whites as a labourer.  The Bill would meet what he considered a great want, and, as it was an urgent matter, he hoped the proposal for a Select Committee would not be agreed to.       Third Reading Debate.  SIR LIONEL PHILLIPS (Yeoville):  But why should a Bill of this sort be brought before them now?  The Government in the past had not been bashful in the appointing of Commissions, and one question he would ask was why, in this important matter, the Government had not appointed a Commission to take all the evidence and then come to the House with a measure which the House would have to approve of.  Instead of that, they were cancelling the rights the Natives had in South Africa, and creating a very awkward hiatus between the time the Commission would be appointed and the time the Commission could define the areas which would be regarded as white areas and the areas which would be regarded as native areas.  That was the one serious blot upon this measure.  He could see no justification, except that the hon. Minister, yielding to pressure from a certain section on that side of the House, had hastily brought on this measure.  He thought from the speeches made in the House it was the consensus of opinion that Natives should not have farms in areas that were essentially white, just as it was desirable that white men should not be found in areas essentially native.  And especially when they told the native population that they were taking away from them a right they had to-day, and they were going to substitute that right by appointing a Commission, they were giving them very little justification for being satisfied with this measure.  He did not think they were going to gain anything by putting the cart before the horse.  He did not know if Mr. Schreiner was accurate, but he told them that, roughly, in the Transvaal, where the matter was most acute, the Native population had bought something like 12,000 or 15,000 morgen of land in twelve years. That, he thought, showed there was no extreme urgency for the measure. To that extent he agreed entirely with the hon. member, and he believed the Minister would be well advised"]]]
