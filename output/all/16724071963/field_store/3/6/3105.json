AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY, 138 NASSAU STREET, NEW YORK. 1856.     ANTI-SLAVERY TRACTS. No. 18.         *       *       *       *       *  THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW, AND ITS VICTIMS.         *       *       *       *       *  The Fugitive Slave Law was enacted by Congress in September, 1850, received the signature of HOWELL COBB, [of Georgia,] as Speaker of the House of Representatives, of WILLIAM R. KING, [of Alabama,] as President of the Senate, and was \"approved,\" September 18th, of that year, by MILLARD FILLMORE, Acting President of the United States.  The authorship of the Bill is generally ascribed to James M. Mason, Senator from Virginia. Before proceeding to the principal object of this tract, it is proper to give a synopsis of the Act itself, which was well called, by the New York _Evening Post_, \"An Act for the Encouragement of Kidnapping.\" It is in ten sections.   SYNOPSIS OF THE LAW.  SECTION 1. United States Commissioners \"authorized and required to exercise and discharge all the powers and duties conferred by this act.\"  SECT. 2. Commissioners for the Territories to be appointed by the Superior Court of the same.  SECT. 3. United States Circuit Courts, and Superior Courts of Territories, required to enlarge the number of Commissioners, \"with a view to afford reasonable facilities to reclaim fugitives from labor,\" &c.  SECT. 4. Commissioners put on the same footing with Judges of the United States Courts, with regard to enforcing the Law and its penalties.  SECT. 5. United States Marshals and deputy marshals, who may refuse to act under the Law, to be fined One Thousand dollars, to the use of the claimant. If a fugitive escape from the custody of the Marshal, the Marshal to be liable for his full value. Commissioners authorized to appoint special officers, and to call out the _posse comitatus_, &c.  SECT. 6. The claimant of any fugitive slave, or his attorney, \"may pursue and reclaim such fugitive person,\" either by procuring a warrant from some judge or commissioner, \"or by seizing and arresting such fugitive, where the same can be done without process;\" to take such fugitive before such judge or commissioner, \"whose duty it shall be to hear and determine the case of such claimant in a summary manner,\" and, if satisfied of the identity of the prisoner, to grant a certificate to said claimant to \"remove such fugitive person back to the State or Territory from whence he or she may have escaped,\"--using \"such reasonable force or restraint as may be necessary under the circumstances of the case.\" \"In no trial or hearing under this act shall the testimony of such alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence.\" All molestation of the claimant, in the removal of his slave, \"by any process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other person whomsoever,\" to be prevented.  SECT. 7. Any person obstructing the arrest of a fugitive, or attempting his or her rescue, or aiding him or her to escape, or harboring and concealing a fugitive, knowing him to be such, shall be subject to a fine of not exceeding one thousand dollars, and to be imprisoned not exceeding six months, and shall also \"forfeit and pay the sum of one thousand dollars for each fugitive so _lost_.\"  SECT. 8. Marshals, deputies, clerks, and special officers to receive usual fees; Commissioners to receive ten dollars, if fugitive is given up to claimant; otherwise, five dollars; to be paid by claimant.  SECT. 9. If claimant make affidavit that he fears a rescue of such fugitive from his possession, the officer making the arrest to retain him in custody, and \"to remove him to the State whence he fled.\" Said officer \"to employ so many persons as he may deem necessary.\" All, while so employed, be paid out of the Treasury of the United States.  Sect. 10. [This Section provides an additional and wholly distinct method for the capture of a fugitive; and, it may be added, one of the loosest and most extraordinary that ever appeared on the pages of Statute book.] Any person, from whom one held to service or labor has escaped, upon making \"satisfactory proof\" of such escape before any court of record, or judge thereof in vacation--a record of matter so proved shall be made by such court, or judge, and also a description of the person escaping, \"with such convenient certainty as may be;\"--a copy of which record, duly attested, \"being produced in any other State, Territory, or District,\" and \"being exhibited to any judge, commissioner, or other officer authorized,\" &c. \"shall be held and taken to be full and conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and that the service or labor of the person escaping is due to the party in such record mentioned;\" when, on satisfactory proof of identity, \"he or she shall be delivered up to the claimant.\" \"_Provided_, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring the production of a transcript of such record as evidence as aforesaid; but in its absence, the claim shall be heard and determined upon other satisfactory proofs competent in law.\"   The name of the NORTHERN men who voted for this cruel kidnapping law should not be forgotten. Until they repent, and do works meet for repentance, let their names stand high and conspicuous on the roll of infamy. Let the \"slow-moving finger of scorn\" point them out, when they walk among men, and the stings of shame, disappointment, and remorse continually visit them in secret, till they are forced to cry, \"my punishment is greater than I can bear.\" As to the _Southern_ men who voted for the law, they only appeared in their legitimate character of oppressors of the poor--whom God will repay, in his own time. The thousand-tongued voices of their brother's blood cry against them from the ground.  The following is the vote, in the SENATE, on the engrossment of the bill:--       YEAS,--Atchison, Badger, Barnwell, Bell, Berrien, Butler,      Davis (of Mississippi), Dawson, A.C.

[Fifteen      Northern Senators absent from the vote.]   On the final passage of the Bill in the Senate, the yeas and nays were not taken. _D.S. Dickinson_ of New York, who had been absent when the vote was taken on the engrossment, spoke in favor of the bill. Mr. Seward was said to be absent from the city, detained by ill health.  When the Bill came up in the HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, (September 12th,) JAMES THOMPSON of Pennsylvania, got the floor,--doubtless by a previous understanding with the Speaker,--and addressed the House in support of the Bill. He closed his remarks by _moving the previous question_! It was ordered, and thus all opportunity for reply, and for discussion of the Bill was cut off. The Bill was then passed to its third reading--equivalent to enactment--by a vote of 109 YEAS, to 75 NAYS; as follows:--  YEAS.      _Maine._--THOMAS J.D.

[33--all Northern men.]       [Fifteen Southern Representatives did not vote.]  DANIEL WEBSTER was not a member of the Senate when the vote on the Fugitive Slave Bill was taken. He had been made Secretary of State, a short time previous. All, however, will remember the powerful aid which he gave to the new compromise measures, and among them to the Fugitive Slave Bill, in his notorious Seventh of March Speech, [1850.] A few extracts from that Speech will show how heavily the responsibility of the existence of this law rests upon DANIEL WEBSTER:--       \"I suppose there is to be found no injunction against      that relation [Slavery] between man and man, in the      teachings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, or of any of his      Apostles.\"--_Webster's 7th March Speech_, (_Authorized      Edition_,) p. 9.       \"One complaint of the South has, in my opinion, just      foundation; and that is, that there has been found at      the North, among individuals and among legislators, a      disinclination to perform, fully, their Constitutional duties      in regard to the return of persons bound to service, who have      escaped into the free States. In that respect, it is my      judgment that the South is right, and the North is wrong.\"      * * * * \"My friend at the head of the Judiciary Committee      [Mr. MASON of Virginia] has a bill on the subject now before      the Senate, with some amendments to it, WHICH I PROPOSE      TO SUPPORT, WITH ALL ITS PROVISIONS, _to the fullest      extent_.\"--_Idem._ p. 29.       He proceeded to assure the Senate that the North would, on      due consideration, fulfil \"their constitutional obligations\"      \"_with alacrity_.\" \"Therefore, I repeat, sir, that here is a      ground of complaint against the North well founded, which      ought to be removed, which it is now in the power of the      different departments of this Government to remove; which      calls for the enactment of proper laws authorizing the      judicature of this Government, in the several States, to do      all that is necessary for the recapture of fugitive slaves,      and for the restoration of them to those who claim them      Wherever I go, and whenever I speak on the subject, and when      I speak here, I desire to speak to the whole North, I say      that the South has been injured in this respect, and has a      right to complain; and the North has been too careless of      what, I think, the Constitution peremptorily and emphatically      enjoins upon her as a duty.\"--_Idem._ p. 30.  In a speech in the United States Senate, July 17, 1850, made with an evident view to calm that Northern feeling which had been aroused and excited by his 7th of March speech, beyond the power of priest or politician wholly to subdue, Mr. WEBSTER said there were various misapprehensions respecting the working of the proposed Fugitive Slave Bill:--       \"The first of these misapprehensions,\" he said, \"is an      exaggerated sense of the actual evil of the reclamation of      fugitive slaves, felt by Massachusetts and the other New      England States. What produced that? The cases do not exist.      There has not been a case within the knowledge of this      generation, in which a man has been taken back from      Massachusetts into slavery by process of law, not one.\"      * * * * \"Not only has there been no case, so far as I can      learn, of the reclamation of a slave by his master, which      ended in taking him back to slavery, in this generation, but      I will add, that, as far as I have been able to go back in my      researches, as far as I have been able to hear and learn, in      all that region there has been no one case of false claim.      * * * _There is no danger of any such violation being      perpetrated.\"[A]--Webster's Speech on the Compromise Bill, in      the United States Senate, 17th of July, 1850, edition of      Gideon & Co., Washington_, pp. 23-25.       [Footnote A: See also Mr. Webster's letter to the Citizens of      Newburyport, dated May 15th, 1850, wherein he urges the same      point, with great pains of argument.]  With such words did Mr. Webster endeavor to allay Northern alarm, and to create the impression (which was created and which prevailed extensively with his friends) that the Fugitive Law was only a concession to Southern feeling, and that few or no attempts to enforce it were likely to be made.  But when a few months had proved him a false prophet, and the Southern chase after fugitive men, women, and children had become hot and fierce, and in one or two instances the hunter had been foiled in his attempts and had lost his prey, Mr. Webster changed his tone, as follows:--       In May, 1851, at Syracuse, N.Y., he said: \"Depend upon it,      the Law [the Fugitive Slave Law] will be executed in its      spirit and to its letter. It will be executed in all the      great cities--here in Syracuse, in the midst of the next      Anti-Slavery Convention, if the occasion shall arise.\"  Certainly, so far as in Mr. Webster lay, so far as was in the power of Mr. Fillmore, and the officers of the United States Government generally, and of the still larger crowd of _expectants_ of office, nothing was left undone to introduce the tactics, discipline, and customs of the Southern plantation into our Northern cities and towns, in order to enforce the Fugitive Law.         *       *       *       *       *  The remainder of this Tract will be devoted to a record, as complete as circumstances enable us to make, of the VICTIMS OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW. It is a terrible record, which the people of this country should never allow to sleep in oblivion, until the disgraceful and bloody system of Slavery is swept from our land, and with it, all Compromise Bills, all Constitutional Guarantees to Slavery, all Fugitive Slave Laws. The established and accredited newspapers of the day, without reference to party distinctions, are the authorities relied upon in making up this record, and the _dates_ being given with each case, the reader is enabled to verify the same, and the few particulars which the compass of the Tract allows to be given with each. With all the effort which has been made to secure a good degree of completeness and exactness, the present record must of necessity be an imperfect one, and fall short of exhibiting all the enormities of the Act in question.       JAMES HAMLET, _of New York, September, 1850_, was the first      victim. He was surrendered by United States Commissioner      Gardiner to the agent of one Mary Brown, of Baltimore, who      claimed him as her slave. He was taken to Baltimore. An      effort was immediately made to purchase his freedom, and in      the existing state of the public feeling, the sum demanded by      his mistress, $800, was quickly raised. Hamlet was brought      back to New York with great rejoicings.       _Near Bedford, Penn., October 1._ Ten fugitives, from      Virginia, were attacked in Pennsylvania--one mortally      wounded, another dangerously. Next morning, both were      captured. Five others entered a mountain hut, and begged      relief. The woman supplied their wants. Her husband went out,      procured assistance, captured the slaves, and received a      reward of $255.       _Harrisburg, Penn., October._ Some slaves, number not      stated, were brought before Commissioner M'Allister, when      \"the property was proven, and they were delivered to their      masters, who took them back to Virginia, by railroad, without      molestation.\"       _Detroit, 8th October._ A negro was arrested under the new      law, and sent to jail for a week, to await evidence. Great      numbers of colored people armed themselves to rescue him.      Result not known.       HENRY GARNETT, _Philadelphia_, arrested as the slave of      Thomas P. Jones, of Cecil County, Maryland, and taken before      Judge Grier, of the United States Supreme Court, October 18,      1850, who declared his determination to execute the law as he      found it. The Judge said that the claimant had not taken the      course prescribed by the fugitive act, and proceeded to      explain, in a detailed manner, what the course should be in      such cases. As the claimant thus failed to make out his case,      the prisoner was ordered to be discharged.       _Boston, about 25th October._ Attempt to seize WILLIAM and      ELLEN CRAFT. William Craft armed himself, and kept within      his shop. Ellen was concealed in the house of a friend.      Their claimants, named Hughes & Knight, were indicted for      defamation of character, in calling W.C. a slave, and brought      before a magistrate. The feeling excited against them was so      great, that they at length fled from the city. Shortly after,      it being considered hazardous for Mr. and Mrs. Craft to      remain in the country, they were enabled to escape to      England.       [In a letter, dated Macon, Georgia, Nov. 11, John Knight      gives a particular account of the proceedings and experiences      of himself and his friend Hughes, on their then recent visit      to Boston for the purpose, to quote his own language, \"of      re-capturing William and Ellen Craft, the negroes belonging      to Dr. Collins and Ira Taylor.\" Willis H. Hughes also      published his statement.]       _New Albany, Indiana._ A woman and boy given up, and taken to      Louisville. They were so white that, even in Kentucky, a   "]]]
