The story was dramatised by Robert Jephson and produced at Covent Garden Theatre under the title of _The Count of Narbonne_, with an epilogue by Malone. It was staged again later in Dublin, Kemble playing the title rôle. It was translated into French, German and Italian. In England its success was immediate, though several years elapsed before it was imitated. Gray, to whom the story was first attributed, wrote of it in March, 1765: \"It engages our attention here (at Cambridge), makes some of us cry a little, and all in general afraid to go to bed o' nights.\" Mason praised it, and Walpole's letters refer repeatedly to the vogue it enjoyed. This widespread popularity is an indication of the eagerness with which readers of 1765 desired to escape from the present and to revel for a time in strange, bygone centuries. Although Walpole regarded the composition of his Gothic story as a whim, his love of the past was shared by others of his generation. Of this Macpherson's _Ossian_ (1760-3), Kurd's _Letters on Chivalry and Romance_ (1762), and Percy's _Reliques_ (1765), are, each in its fashion, a sufficient proof. The half-century from 1760 to 1810 showed remarkably definite signs of a renewed interest in things written between 1100 and 1650, which had been neglected for a century or more. _The Castle of Otranto_, which was \"an attempt to blend the marvellous of old story with the natural of modern novels\" is an early symptom of this revulsion to the past; and it exercised a charm on Scott as well as on Mrs. Radcliffe and her school. _The Castle of Otranto_ is significant, not because of its intrinsic merit, but because of its power in shaping the destiny of the novel.  The outline of the plot is worth recording for the sake of tracing ancestral likenesses when we reach the later romances. The only son of Manfred--the villain of the piece--is discovered on his wedding morning dashed to pieces beneath an enormous helmet. Determined that his line shall not become extinct, Manfred decides to divorce Hippolyta and marry Isabella, his son's bride. To escape from her pursuer, Isabella takes flight down a \"subterraneous passage,\" where she is succoured by a \"peasant\" Theodore, who bears a curious resemblance to a portrait of the \"good Alfonso\" in the gallery of the castle. The servants of the castle are alarmed at intervals by the sudden appearance of massive pieces of armour in different parts of the building. A clap of thunder, which shakes the castle to its foundations, heralds the culmination of the story. A hundred men bear in a huge sabre; and an apparition of the illustrious Alfonso--whose portrait in the gallery once walks straight out of its frame[24]--appears, \"dilated to an immense magnitude,\"[25] and demands that Manfred shall surrender Otranto to the rightful heir, Theodore, who has been duly identified by the mark of a \"bloody arrow.\" Alfonso, thus pacified, ascends into heaven, where he is received into glory by St. Nicholas. As Matilda, who was beloved of Theodore, has incidentally been slain by her father, Theodore consoles himself with Isabella. Manfred and his wife meekly retire to neighbouring convents. With this anti-climax the story closes. To present the \"dry bones\" of a romantic story is often misleading, but the method is perhaps justifiable in the case of _The Castle of Otranto_, because Walpole himself scorned embellishments and declared in his grandiloquent fashion:       \"If this air of the miraculous is excused, the reader      will find nothing else unworthy of his perusal. There      is no bombast, no similes, flowers, digressions or      unnecessary descriptions. Everything tends directly to      the catastrophe.\"[26]  But with all its faults _The Castle of Otranto_ did not fall fruitless on the earth. The characters are mere puppets, yet we meet the same types again and again in later Gothic romances. Though Clara Reeve renounced such \"obvious improbabilities\" as a ghost in a hermit's cowl and a walking picture, she was an acknowledged disciple of Walpole, and, like him, made an \"interesting peasant\" the hero of her story, _The Old English Baron_. Jerome is the prototype of many a count disguised as father confessor, Bianca the pattern of many a chattering servant. The imprisoned wife reappears in countless romances, including Mrs. Radcliffe's _Sicilian Romance_ (1790), and Mrs. Roche's _Children of the Abbey_ (1798). The tyrannical father--no new creation, however--became so inevitable a figure in fiction that Jane Austen had to assure her readers that Mr. Morland \"was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters,\" and Miss Martha Buskbody, the mantua-maker of Gandercleugh, whom Jedediah Cleishbotham ingeniously called to his aid in writing the conclusion of _Old Mortality_, assured him, as the fruit of her experience in reading through the stock of three circulating libraries that, in a novel, young people may fall in love without the countenance of their parents, \"because it is essential to the necessary intricacy of the story.\" But apart from his characters, who are so colourless that they hardly hold our attention, Walpole bequeathed to his successors a remarkable collection of useful \"properties.\" The background of his story is a Gothic castle, singularly unenchanted it is true, but capable of being invested by Mrs. Radcliffe with mysterious grandeur. Otranto contains underground vaults, ill-fitting doors with rusty hinges, easily extinguished lamps and a trap-door--objects trivial and insignificant in Walpole's hands, but fraught with terrible possibilities. Otranto would have fulfilled admirably the requirements of Barrett's Cherubina, who, when looking for lodgings demanded--to the indignation of a maidservant, who came to the door--old pictures, tapestry, a spectre and creaking hinges. Scott, writing in 1821, remarks:       \"The apparition of the skeleton-hermit to the prince of      Vicenza was long accounted a masterpiece of the      horrible; but of late the valley of Jehosaphat could      hardly supply the dry bones necessary for the      exhibition of similar spectres.\"  But Cherubina, whose palate was jaded by a surfeit of the pungent horrors of Walpole's successors, would probably have found _The Castle of Otranto_ an insipid romance and would have lamented that he did not make more effective use of his supernatural machinery. His story offered hints and suggestions to those whose greater gifts turned the materials he had marshalled to better account, and he is to be honoured rather for what he instigated others to perform than for what he actually accomplished himself. _The Castle of Otranto_ was not intended as a serious contribution to literature, but will always survive in literary history as the ancestor of a thriving race of romances.  More than ten years before the publication of _The Castle of Otranto_, Smollett, in his _Adventures of Ferdinand, Count Fathom_, had chanced upon the devices employed later in the tale of terror. The tremors of fear to which his rascally hero is subjected lend the spice of alarm to what might have been but a monotonous record of villainy. Smollett depicts skilfully the imaginary terrors created by darkness and solitude. As the Count travels through the forest:       \"The darkness of the night, the silence and solitude of      the place, the indistinct images of the trees that      appeared on every side, stretching their extravagant      arms athwart the gloom, conspired, with the dejection      of spirits occasioned by his loss, to disturb his fancy      and raise strange phantoms in his imagination. Although      he was not naturally superstitious, his mind began to      be invaded with an awful horror that gradually      prevailed over all the consolations of reason and      philosophy; nor was his heart free from the terrors of      assassination. In order to dissipate these agreeable      reveries, he had recourse to the conversation of his      guide, by whom he was entertained with the history of      divers travellers who had been robbed and murdered by      ruffians, whose retreat was in the recesses of that      very wood.\"[27]  The sighing of the trees, thunder and sudden flashes of lightning add to the horror of a journey, which resembles Mrs. Radcliffe's description of Emily's approach to Udolpho. When Count Fathom takes refuge in a robber's hut, he discovers in his room, which has no bolt on the inside of the door, the body of a recently murdered man, concealed beneath some bundles of straw. Effecting his escape by placing the corpse in his own bed to deceive the robbers, the count is mistaken for a phantom by the old woman who waits upon him. In carrying out his designs upon Celinda, the count aggravates her natural timidity by relating dismal stories of omens and apparitions, and then groans piteously outside her door and causes the mysterious music of an Æolian harp to sound upon the midnight air. Celinda sleeps, too, like the ill-starred heroine of the novel of terror, \"at the end of a long gallery, scarce within hearing of any other inhabited part of the house.\"[28] The scene in _Count Fathom_, in which Renaldo, at midnight, visits, as he thinks, the tomb of Monimia, is surrounded with circumstances of gloom and mystery:       \"The uncommon darkness of the night, the solemn silence      and lonely situation of the place, conspired with the      occasion of his coming and the dismal images of his      fancy, to produce a real rapture of gloomy      expectation... The clock struck twelve, the owl      screeched from the ruined battlement, the door was      opened by the sexton, who, by the light of a glimmering      taper, conducted the despairing lover to a dreary      aisle.\"  As he watches again on a second night:       \"His ear was suddenly invaded with the sound of some      few, solemn notes, issuing from the organ which seemed      to feel"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14154"],["title","The Tale of Terror: A Study of the Gothic Romance (#5)"],["body","impulse of an invisible hand ... reason      shrunk before the thronging ideas of his fancy, which      represented this music as the prelude to something      strange and supernatural.\"[29]  The figure of a woman, arrayed in a flowing robe and veil, approaches--and proves to be Monimia in the flesh. Although Smollett precedes Walpole, in point of time, he is, in these scenes, nearer in spirit to Udolpho than Otranto. His use of terror, however, is merely incidental; he strays inadvertently into the history of Gothic romance. The suspicions and forebodings, with which Smollett plays occasionally upon the nerves of his readers, become part of the ordinary routine in the tale of terror.  Clara Reeve's Gothic story, first issued under the title of _The Champion of Virtue_, but later as _The Old English Baron_, was published in 1777--twelve years after Walpole's _Castle of Otranto_, of which, as she herself asserted, it was the \"literary offspring.\" By eliminating all supernatural incidents save one ghost, she sought to bring her story \"within the utmost verge of probability.\" Walpole, perhaps displeased by the slighting references in the preface to some of the more extraordinary incidents in his novel, received _The Old English Baron_ with disdain, describing it as \"totally void of imagination and interest.\"[30] His strictures are unjust. There are certainly no wild flights of fancy in Clara Reeve's story, but an even level of interest is maintained throughout. Her style is simple and refreshingly free from affectation. The plot is neither rapid nor exhilarating, but it never actually stagnates. Like Walpole's Gothic story, _The Old English Baron_ is supposed to be a transcript from an ancient manuscript. The period, we are assured, is that of the minority of Henry VI., but despite an elaborately described tournament, we never really leave eighteenth century England. Edmund Twyford, the reputed son of a cottager, is befriended by a benevolent baron Fitzowen, but, through his good fortune and estimable qualities, excites the envy of Fitzowen's nephews and his eldest son. To prove the courage of Edmund, who has been basely slandered by his enemies, the baron asks him to spend three nights in the haunted apartment of the castle. Up to this point, there has been nothing to differentiate the story from an uneventful domestic novel. The ghost is of the mechanical variety and does not inspire awe when he actually appears, but Miss Reeve tries to prepare our minds for the shock, before she introduces him. The rusty locks and the sudden extinction of the lamp are a heritage from Walpole, but the \"hollow, rustling noise\" and the glimmering light, naturally explained later by the approach of a servant with a faggot, anticipate Mrs. Radcliffe. Like Adeline later, in _The Romance of the Forest_, Edmund is haunted by prophetic dreams. The second night the ghost violently clashes his armour, but still remains concealed. The third night dismal groans are heard. The ghost does not deign to appear in person until the baron's nephews watch, and then:       \"All the doors flew open, a pale glimmering light      appeared at the door from the staircase, and a man in      complete armour entered the room: he stood with one      hand extended pointing to the outward door.\"  It is to vindicate the rights of this departed spirit that Sir Ralph Harclay challenges Sir Walter Lovel to a \"mediaeval\" tournament. Before the story closes, Edmund is identified as the owner of Castle Lovel, and is married to Lady Emma, Fitzowen's daughter. The narration of the unusual circumstances connected with his birth takes some time, as the foster parents suffer from what is described by writers on psychology as \"total recall,\" and are unable to select the salient details. The characters are rather dim and indistinct, the shadowiest of all being Emma, who has no personality at all, and is a mere complement to the immaculate Edmund's happiness. The good and bad are sharply distinguished. There are no \"doubtful cases,\" and consequently there is no difficulty in distributing appropriate rewards and punishments at the close of the story--the whole \"furnishing a striking lesson to posterity of the overruling hand of providence and the certainty of retribution.\" Clara Reeve was fifty-two years of age when she published her Gothic story, and she writes in the spirit of a maiden aunt striving to edify as well as to entertain the younger generation. When Edmund takes Fitzowen to view the fatal closet and the bones of his murdered father, he considers the scene \"too solemn for a lady to be present at\"; and his love-making is as frigid as the supernatural scenes. The hero is young in years, but has no youthful ardour. The very ghost is manipulated in a half-hearted fashion and fails to produce the slightest thrill. The natural inclination of the authoress was probably towards domestic fiction with a didactic intention, and she attempted a \"mediaeval\" setting as a _tour de force_, in emulation of Walpole's _Castle of Otranto_. The hero, whose birth is enshrouded in mystery, the restless ghost groaning for the vindication of rights, the historical background, the archaic spelling of the challenge, are all ineffective fumblings towards the romantic. _The Old English Baron_ is an unambitious work, but it has a certain hold upon our attention because of its limpidity of style. It can be read without discomfort and even with a mild degree of interest simply as a story, while _The Castle of Otranto_ is only tolerable as a literary curiosity. A tragedy, _Edmond_, _Orphan of the Castle_ (1799), was founded upon the story, which was translated into French in 1800. Miss Reeve informs the public in a preface to a late edition of _The Old English Baron_ that, in compliance with the suggestion of a friend, she had composed _Castle Connor, an Irish Story_, in which apparitions were introduced. The manuscript of this tale was unfortunately lost. Not even a mouldering fragment has been rescued from an ebony cabinet in the deserted chamber of an ancient abbey, and we are left wondering whether the ghosts spoke with a brogue.  When Walpole wrote disparagingly of Clara Reeve's imitation of his Gothic story, he singled out for praise a fragment which he attributes to Mrs. Barbauld. The story to which he alludes is evidently the unfinished _Sir Bertrand_, which is contained in one of the volumes entitled _Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose_, published jointly by J. and A.L. Aikin in 1773, and preceded by an essay _On the Pleasure Derived from Objects of Terror_. Leigh Hunt, who reprinted _Sir Bertrand_, which had impressed him very strongly in his boyhood, in his _Book for a Corner_ (1849) ascribes the authorship of the tale to Dr. Aikin, commenting on the fact that he was \"a writer from whom this effusion was hardly to have been looked for.\" It is probably safe to assume that Walpole, who was a contemporary of the Aikins and who took a lively interest in the literary gossip of the day, was right in assigning _Sir Bertrand_ to Miss Aikin,[31] afterwards Mrs. Barbauld, though the story is not included in _The Works of Anne Letitia Barbauld_, edited by Miss Lucy Aikin in 1825. That the minds of the Aikins were exercised about the sources of pleasure in romance, especially when connected with horror and distress, is clear not only from this essay and the illustrative fragment but also from other essays and stories in the same collection--_On Romances, an Imitation_, and _An Enquiry into those Kinds of Distress which Excite Agreeable Sensations_. In the preliminary essay to _Sir Bertrand_ an attempt is made to explain why terrible scenes excite pleasurable emotions and to distinguish between two different types of horror, as illustrated by _The Castle of Otranto_, which unites the marvellous and the terrible, and by a scene of mere natural horror in Smollett's _Count Fathom_. The story _Sir Bertrand_ is an attempt to combine the two kinds of horror in one composition. A knight, wandering in darkness on a desolate and dreary moor, hears the tolling of a bell, and, guided by a glimmering light, finds \"an antique mansion\" with turrets at the corners. As he approaches the porch, the light glides away. All is dark and still. The light reappears and the bell tolls. As Sir Bertrand enters the castle, the door closes behind him. A bluish flame leads him up a staircase till he comes to a wide gallery and a second staircase, where the light vanishes. He grasps a dead-cold hand which he severs from the wrist with his sword. The blue flame now leads him to a vault, where he sees the owner of the hand \"completely armed, thrusting forwards the bloody stump of an arm, with a terrible frown and menacing gesture and brandishing a sword in the remaining hand.\" When attacked, the figure vanishes, leaving behind a massive, iron key which unlocks a door leading to an apartment containing a coffin, and statues of black marble, attired in Moorish costume, holding enormous sabres in their right hands. As the knight enters, each of them rears an arm and advances a leg and at the same moment the lid of the coffin opens and the bell tolls. Sir Bertrand, guided by the flames, approaches the coffin from which a lady in a shroud and a black veil arises. When he kisses her, the whole building falls asunder with a crash. Sir Bertrand is thrown into a trance and awakes in a gorgeous room, where he sees a beautiful lady who thanks him as her deliverer. At a banquet, nymphs place a laurel wreath on his head, but as the lady is about to address him the fragment breaks off.  The architecture of the castle, with its gallery, staircase and subterranean vaults, closely resembles that of Walpole's Gothic structure. The \"enormous sabres\" too are familiar to readers of _The Castle of Otranto_. The gliding light, disquieting at the outset of the story but before the close familiar grown, is doomed to be the guide of many a distressed"]]]
