I have shown you why I must have good order in the camp, and I have told you that I do not propose to allow gambling or any other disorderly conduct to go on within camp limits. I can't agree to these things, and then hope to win out by keeping the cost of the work within the appropriation.\"  \"Do you feel that you'll keep within the appropriation by making enemies who deliberately blow up our masonry?\" glared Mr. Bascomb.  \"I doubt if there will be any more expense in that line, sir.  I intend to have such a watch kept over the wall as to prevent any further mischief of the kind.\"  \"Watchmen are an item of expense, aren't they?\" snorted the president.  \"Yes, sir; but next to nothing at all as compared with the mischief they can prevent.\"  \"I have already told you how to prevent the mischief, Reade.  Stop all of your foolish nonsense and let the men have their old-time pastimes.\"  \"I can't do it, sir.\"  \"Have you paper, pen and ink here?\" thundered Mr. Bascomb.  \"If so, bring them.\"  Tom quietly obeyed.  \"Reade,\" again thundered the president of the Melliston Company, \"I have had as much of your nonsense as I intend to stand.  You are out of here, from this minute.  Take that pen and sign your resignation!\"     CHAPTER VII  TOM ISN'T AS EASY AS HE LOOKS   \"I don't believe I'll do that, sir,\" murmured Tom, putting down the pen.  \"You don't, eh?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Oh, then you'd rather wait and be forced out?\"  \"How about the contract, sir, between your company and Reade & Hazelton? Contracts can't be broken as lightly as your words imply.\"  \"I'll break that contract, if I set out to,\" declared Mr. Bascomb, purpling with half-suppressed rage.  \"I've every ground for breaking the contract. You're running things with a high hand here, and disorganizing all our efforts.  No contract will stand on presentation of any such evidence as that before a court.\"  \"I am quite willing to leave that to a court, if I have to,\" Reade rejoined.  His tones were decidedly cold.  \"Mr. Bascomb, even if I were inclined to forfeit the contract I would have no legal right to do so without the approval of my partner, Hazelton.\"  \"Humph!  He's dead,\" snorted the president.  \"That yet remains to be proved, sir,\" Tom answered huskily, his voice breaking slightly at thought of Harry.  \"How on earth do you think you could defend a contract against a wealthy company like ours?  Why, we could swamp you under our loose change alone. How much money have you in the world?  Two or three thousand dollars, perhaps.\"  \"I've a little more than that,\" Tom Reade smiled.  \"For one thing, I'm a third owner in the Ambition mine, on Indian Smoke Range, Nevada, and the Ambition has been a dividend payer almost from the start.  Hazelton owns another third of the mine.\"  \"Eh?\" gasped Mr. Bascomb, plainly taken aback.  \"Oh, we're not millionaires,\" Tom laughed easily.  \"Yet I fancy Hazelton and I could raise enough money to fight any breach-of-contract case in court.  With a steady-paying mine, you know, we could even discount to some extent the earnings of future years.\"  \"Oh, well, we don't want hard feelings,\" urged Mr. Bascomb, his manner becoming more peaceable.  \"The plain truth is, Reade, that we're utterly dissatisfied with your way of managing things here.  When you know how the Melliston Company feels toward you, you don't want to be impudent enough to insist on hanging on, do you?\"  \"I am certain that I speak for my partner, sir, when I state that we won't drop the contract until we have fulfilled it,\" Tom muttered, coolly, but with great firmness.  \"What's all this dispute about anyway, Bascomb?\" a voice called cheerily from the hallway.  \"Oh, it's you, is it, Prenter?\" asked Mr. Bascomb, turning and not looking overjoyed at the interruption.  Simon F. Prenter was treasurer of the Melliston Company.  Tom had met him at the time of signing the engineers' contract with the company.  Now Reade sprang up to place a chair for the new arrival.  \"What was all the row about?\" Mr. Prenter asked affably.  He was a man of about forty-five, rather stout, with light blue eyes that looked at one with engaging candor.  \"I have been suggesting to Reade that he might resign,\" replied Mr. Bascomb, stiffly.  \"Why?\" asked Prenter, opening his eyes wider.  \"Because he has raised the mischief on this breakwater job.  He has all the men by their ears, and the camp in open mutiny.\"  \"So?\" asked Mr. Prenter, looking astonished.  \"Exactly, and therefore I have called upon the young man to resign.\"  \"And he refuses?\" queried the treasurer.  \"Most astounding obstinacy on the part of so young a man when dealing with his elder.\"  \"I'll try to explain to you, Mr. Prenter,\" volunteered Reade, \"just what I've been trying to tell Mr. Bascomb.\"  \"I don't know that I need trouble you,\" replied Mr. Prenter, moving so that he stood more behind the irate president.  \"I overheard what you were telling him.\"  Then the treasurer did a most unexpected thing.  He winked broadly at the young engineer.  \"Yes, Prenter,\" Mr. Bascomb went on, \"this camp is in a state of mutiny. The men are all at odds with their chief.\"  \"Strange,\" murmured the treasurer of the Melliston Company.  \"When I paused on the porch, before entering, I thought I caught sight of unusual activity down at the water front.  Did you notice it, too, Bascomb?\"  \"I noticed nothing of the sort,\" replied the president stiffly.  \"Am I to infer, Prenter, that you are going to follow your occasional tactics and try to laugh me out of my decision as president of the company?\"  \"Oh, nothing of the sort, I assure you,\" hastily protested the treasurer. But he found chance to drive another wink Tom Reade's way.  The young chief engineer could not but feel that an ally had suddenly come his way.  \"Now, what is the nature and extent of the mutiny?\" asked Mr. Prenter.  \"First of all, eight thousand dollars' damage has been done to the retaining wall of the breakwater,\" replied Mr. Bascomb.  \"That is, according to Mr. Reade's figures, which very likely may prove to be too low.  Also, Mr. Hazelton has been murdered.\"  \"Hazelton---killed?\" gasped Mr. Prenter showing genuine concern.  \"Of course I know that the telegram to the office said that Hazelton was missing, but I didn't suppose it was anything as tragic as a killing.\"  \"Well, Hazelton can't be found, so I haven't a doubt he was killed as part of a general plan of mutiny and revenge on the part of the mixed crews of men working here,\" declared Mr. Bascomb.  \"Oh, I sincerely hope that Hazelton hasn't lost his life here!\" cried Mr. Prenter.  \"Reade, aren't you going to take us down to the water front and show us the extent of the damage?\"  \"I shall be only too glad to do so, sir,\" Tom agreed.  Even Mr. Bascomb consented at last to go.  As they gained the porch Nicolas rushed up with the cigars for which the president had sent him. While Mr. Bascomb paused to light one, Mr. Prenter thrust an arm through Tom's and led that youth down the road.  \"Now, Mr. Reade,\" murmured the treasurer, earnestly, \"Mr. Bascomb, of course, is our president, and I don't want you to treat him with the slightest disrespect.  But Bascomb isn't the majority stockholder nor the whole board of directors, so I'll just drop this hint: When Bascomb talks of resignations don't attach too serious importance to it until you receive a resolution endorsing the same view and passed by the board of directors of the company.\"  \"Thank you.  I have no intention of resigning,\" smiled Tom.  \"Now, let's go on,\" continued Mr. Prenter.  Mr. Bascomb, having his cigar lighted, seemed to prefer strolling in the rear by himself.  \"Now, I don't want to give you any wrong impressions, Mr. Reade,\" went on Mr. Prenter.  \"Mr. Bascomb is the head of our company, but other directors represent more of the stock of the company than he does.  I am one of them. Sometimes Mr. Bascomb gets a bit hard-headed, and he is inclined to give orders that others of us wouldn't approve.  I judge that you and he were having some dispute when I happened along.\"  \"I didn't regard it as a dispute, sir,\" Reade rejoined.  \"In the first place, I had discharged, for incompetency and faithlessness, a foreman named Evarts.  \"And Evarts is a pet of Mr. Bascomb's,\" smiled Mr. Prenter.  \"I imagine that Evarts is even some sort of family connection who has to be looked after and kept in a good job.\"  \"Anyway,\" Tom continued, \"I explained that Evarts was worse than useless here and that I couldn't have him in the camp or on the job.\"  \"Quite right, I fancy,\" nodded Mr. Prenter.  \"In the second place, Mr. Bascomb ordered me to stop my crusade against the gamblers who had tried to invade the camp and rob the men of their earnings.  Hazelton and I had that sort of row once out in Arizona---and we won out.\"  \"You deserve to win out here, too,\" remarked Mr. Prenter.  \"I have no patience with anything but straight, uncompromising right.  We can't control the men, if they see fit to leave the camp at night, but you have every right---and it's your duty---to see to it that no disorder is allowed within camp limits.  I, too, have heard something about your trouble here, Mr. Reade, and I can promise you that the directors generally will sustain you.  So Mr. Bascomb demanded your resignation?\"  \"He did, sir.\"  \"Let it go at that,\" smiled Mr. Prenter.  \"You may even, sometime, if it will please Mr. Bascomb, hand him your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14375"],["title","The Adventures of Grandfather Frog (#0)"],["body","Hutchinson, and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

His eyes twinkled with mischief, and he hurried as only Billy can. As he passed Jerry Muskrat's house, Jerry saw him.  \"Hi, Billy Mink! Where are you going in such a hurry this fine morning?\" he called.  \"To find Little Joe Otter. Have you seen anything of him?\" replied Billy.  \"No,\" said Jerry. \"He's probably down to the Big River fishing. I heard him say last night that he was going.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Billy Mink, and without waiting to say more he was off like a little brown flash.  Jerry watched him out of sight. \"Hump!\" exclaimed Jerry. \"Billy Mink is in a terrible hurry this morning. Now I wonder what he is so anxious to find Little Joe Otter for. When they get their heads together, it is usually for some mischief.\"  Jerry climbed to the top of his house and looked over the Smiling Pool in the direction from which Billy Mink had just come. Almost at once he saw Grandfather Frog fast asleep on his big green lily-pad. The legs of a foolish green fly were sticking out of one corner of his big mouth. Jerry couldn't help laughing, for Grandfather Frog certainly did look funny.  \"He's had a good breakfast this morning, and his full stomach has made him sleepy,\" thought Jerry. \"But he's getting careless in his old age. He certainly is getting careless. The idea of going to sleep right out in plain sight like that!\"  Suddenly a new thought popped into his head. \"Billy Mink saw him, and that is why he is so anxious to find Little Joe Otter. He is planning to play some trick on Grandfather Frog as sure as pollywogs have tails!\" exclaimed Jerry. Then his eyes began to twinkle as he added: \"I think I'll have some fun myself.\"  Without another word Jerry slipped down into the water and swam over to the big green lily-pad of Grandfather Frog. Then he hit the water a smart blow with his tail. Grandfather Frog's big goggly eyes flew open, and he was just about to make a frightened plunge into the Smiling Pool when he saw Jerry.  \"Have a nice nap?\" inquired Jerry, with a broad grin.  \"I wasn't asleep!\" protested Grandfather Frog indignantly. \"I was just thinking.\"  \"Don't you think it a rather dangerous plan to think so long with your eyes closed?\" asked Jerry.  \"Well, maybe I did just doze off,\" admitted Grandfather Frog sheepishly.  \"Maybe you did,\" replied Jerry. \"Now listen.\" Then Jerry whispered in Grandfather Frog's ear, and both chuckled as if they were enjoying some joke, for they are great friends, you know. Afterward Jerry swam back to his house, and Grandfather Frog closed his eyes so as to look just as he did when he was asleep.  Meanwhile Billy Mink had hurried down the Laughing Brook. Half-way to the Big River he met Little Joe Otter bringing home a big fish, for you know Little Joe is a great fisherman. Billy Mink hastened to tell him how Grandfather Frog had fallen fast asleep on his big green lily-pad.  \"It's a splendid chance to have some fun with Grandfather Frog and give him a great scare,\" concluded Billy.  Little Joe Otter put his fish down and grinned. He likes to play pranks almost as well as he likes to go fishing.  \"What can we do?\" said he.  \"I've thought of a plan,\" replied Billy. \"Do you happen to know where we can find Longlegs the Blue Heron?\"  \"Yes,\" said Little Joe. \"I saw him fishing not five minutes ago.\"  Then Billy told Little Joe his plan, and laughing and giggling, the two little scamps hurried off to find Longlegs the Blue Heron.     II  LONGLEGS THE BLUE HERON RECEIVES CALLERS   Longlegs the Blue Heron felt decidedly out of sorts. It was a beautiful morning, too beautiful for any one to be feeling that way. Indeed, it was the same beautiful morning in which Grandfather Frog had caught so many foolish green flies.  Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was smiling his broadest. The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind were dancing happily here and there over the Green Meadows, looking for some good turn to do for others. The little feathered people to whom Old Mother Nature has given the great blessing of music in their throats were pouring out their sweetest songs. So it seemed as if there was no good reason why Longlegs should feel out of sorts. The fact is the trouble with Longlegs was an empty stomach. Yes, Sir, that is what ailed Longlegs the Blue Heron that sunshiny morning. You know it is hard work to be hungry and happy at the same time.  So Longlegs stood on the edge of a shallow little pool in the Laughing Brook, grumbling to himself. Just a little while before, he had seen Little Joe Otter carrying home a big fish, and this had made him hungrier and more out of sorts than ever. In the first place it made him envious, and envy, you know, always stirs up bad feelings. He knew perfectly well that Little Joe had got that fish by boldly chasing it until he caught it, for Little Joe can swim even faster than a fish. But Longlegs chose to try to make himself think that it was all luck. Moreover, he wanted to blame some one for his own lack of success, as most people who fail do. So when Little Joe had called out: \"Hi, Longlegs, what luck this fine morning?\" Longlegs just pretended not to hear. But when Little Joe was out of sight and hearing, he began to grumble to himself.  \"No wonder I have no luck with that fellow racing up and down the Laughing Brook,\" said he. \"He isn't content to catch what he wants himself, but frightens the rest of the fish so that an honest fisherman like me has no chance at all. I don't see what Old Mother Nature was thinking of when she gave him a liking for fish. He and Billy Mink are just two worthless little scamps, born to make trouble for other people.\"  He was still grumbling when these two same little scamps poked their heads out of the grass on the other side of the little pool. \"You look happy, Longlegs. Must be that you have had a good breakfast,\" said Little Joe, nudging Billy Mink.  Longlegs snapped his great bill angrily. \"What are you doing here, spoiling my fishing?\" he demanded. \"Haven't you got the Big River and all the rest of the Laughing Brook to fool around in? This is my pool, and I'll thank you to keep away!\"  Billy Mink chuckled so that Longlegs heard him, and that didn't improve his temper a bit. But before he could say anything more, Little Joe Otter spoke.  \"Oh,\" said he, \"we beg your pardon. We just happen to know that Grandfather Frog is sound asleep, and we thought that if you hadn't had good luck this morning, you might like to know about it. As long as you think so ill of us, we'll just run over and tell Blackcap the Night Heron.\"  Little Joe turned as if to start off in search of Blackcap at once. \"Hold on a minute!\" called Longlegs, and tried to make his voice sound pleasant, a difficult thing to do, because, you know, his voice is very harsh and disagreeable. \"The truth is, I haven't had a mouthful of breakfast and to be hungry is apt to make me cross. Where did you say Grandfather Frog is?\"  \"I didn't say,\" replied Little Joe, \"but if you really want to know, he is sitting on his big green lily-pad in the Smiling Pool fast asleep right in plain sight.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Longlegs. \"I believe I have an errand up that way, now I think of it. I believe I'll just go over and have a look at him. I have never seen him asleep.\"  [Illustration: \"Thank you,\" said Longlegs. \"I believe I have an errand up that way.\" _Page 10_.]     III  LONGLEGS VISITS THE SMILING POOL   Longlegs the Blue Heron watched Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter disappear down the Laughing Brook. As long as they were in sight, he sat without moving, his head drawn down between his shoulders just as if he had nothing more important to think about"]]]
