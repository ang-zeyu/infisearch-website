Germany’s army, I said to myself, had long been ready.  Now her fleet was ready, too.  With an inland avenue of safe retreat, invulnerably fortified at either end, Teuton sea strategists had always insisted that the Fatherland’s naval position would be well-nigh impregnable.  That hour had arrived.  There was the Kaiser, before my very eyes, leading the way through the War Canal for his twenty-seven-thousand-five-hundred-ton battleships and battle cruisers, and even for his thirty-five-thousand-ton or fifty-thousand-ton creations of some later day, for the War Canal was made over for to-morrow, as well as for to-day.  The German war machine tightened up the last bolt when William of Hohenzollern emerged from Holtenau locks into the harbor of Kiel, spectacular symbol of the fact that German ironclads of any dimensions were now able to sally back and forth from the Baltic to the North Sea and hide for a year, as the world has meantime seen, even from the Mistress of the Seas. No wonder a British bluejacket, forming the link of an endless chain of his fellows dressing ship round the rail of the _Centurion_ in honor of the War Lord, whispered audibly to a mate, as the _Hohenzollern_ steamed down the line to her anchorage, \"Say, Bill, don’t he look jest like Gawd!\" Perhaps the Divinely-Anointed felt that way, too.  When the Kaiser had left the _King George V_ after a politely cursory \"inspection\"--the only real \"understanding\" effected between England and Germany at Kiel was a tacit agreement on the part of officers and men to do no amateur spying in one another’s ships--Sir George Warrender summoned us from the turret and told us some details of the All-Highest visitation. The Emperor had been \"delighted to make his first call in a British dreadnought aboard so magnificent a specimen as the _King George V_\" (she and her sisters being at the time the most powerful battleships flying the Union Jack).  He wanted the Vice-Admiral to assure the British Government what pleasure it had done the German Navy \"in sending these fine ships to Kiel.\"  He hoped nothing was being left undone to \"complete the English sailors’ happiness\" in German waters.  That extorted from Sir George Warrender the exclamation that German hospitality, like all else Teutonic, was seemingly thoroughness personified, for somebody had even been thoughtful enough to lay a submarine telephone cable from the Seebade-Anstalt Hotel to the Vice-Admiral’s flagship, so that Lady Maude Warrender might talk from her apartments on shore directly to her husband’s quarters afloat.  \"Yes,\" continued the Kaiser, who is a genial conversationalist and _raconteur_, \"I am in my element in surroundings like these.  I love the sea.  I like to go to launchings of ships.  I am passionately fond of yachting.  You must sail with me to-morrow, Admiral, in my newest _Meteor_, the fifth of the name.  I race only with German crews now. Time was when I had to have British skippers and British sailors.  You see, my aim is to breed a race of German yachtsmen.  As fast as I’ve trained a good crew in the _Meteor_, I let it go to the new owner of the boat.  I am the loser by that system, but I have the satisfaction of knowing that I am promoting a good cause.\"  The confab was approaching its end.  \"Oh, Admiral, before I forget, how is Lady ........ and the Duchess of ........? I know so many of your handsome Englishwomen.\"  Sir George Warrender’s captains and the officers of the flagship were now grouped around him for a farewell salute to their Imperial senior officer.  The Kaiser spied the _King George V’s_ chaplain, and leaning over to him inquired, gaily, \"Chaplain, is there any swearing in this ship?\"  \"Oh, never, Your Majesty, never any swearing in a British dreadnought!\"  The War Lord liked that, for we who had been in the Olympian heights for’d remembered his laughing aloud at this veracious tribute to Jack Tar’s world-famed purity of diction.  Kiel Week thenceforward was an endless round of Anglo-German pleasantries.  A Zeppelin, harbinger of coming events, hovered over the British squadron at intervals, her crew wagging cheery greetings to the ships while acquainting themselves at close range with the looks of English dreadnoughts from the sky. British sailormen paid fraternal visits to German dreadnoughts and German sailormen returned their calls. The crew of the _Ajax_ gave a music-hall smoker in honor of the crew of the big battle-cruiser _Seydlitz_, the Teuton tars being no little awestruck by the complacency with which two heavyweight British boxers pummeled each other a sea-green for six rounds and then smilingly shook hands when it was all over.  Germans never punch one another except in gory hate, and they seldom fight with their fists.  The Kaiser was host nightly at splendid State dinners in the _Hohenzollern_ and Vice-Admiral Warrender returned the fire with state banquets aboard the _King George V_.  The atmosphere was fairly thick with brotherly love.  It was not so much as ruffled even when the octogenarian Earl of Brassey, who wards off rheumatism by an early morning pull in his row-boat, was arrested by a German harbor-policeman as an \"English spy\" for approaching the forbidden waters of Kiel dockyard.  German diplomacy was typically represented by Lord Brassey’s zealous captor, for the master of the famous _Sunbeam_ brought that venerable craft to Kiel to demonstrate that Englishmen of his class sincerely favored peace, and, if possible, friendship with Germany.  Wilhelmstrasse tact was exemplified again when, by way of apology to Lord Brassey, the Kiel police explained that there was, of course, no intention of charging him with espionage.  The policeman who arrested him merely thought he was nabbing a smuggler!  At dinner that night in the _Hohenzollern_, the Kaiser chuckled jovially at Lord Brassey’s expense.  England’s greatest living marine historian stole away from Kiel with the _Sunbeam_ in the gray dawn of the next day, with new ideas of German courtesy to the stranger within the gate. He had intended to stay longer.  [Illustration: A naval Zeppelin cruising over the British squadron at Kiel.]  Of all the billing and cooing at Kiel there is photographed most indelibly on my memory the glorious jamboree of the sailors of the British and German squadrons in the big assembly hall at the Imperial dockyard on the Saturday night of the \"Week.\"  There were free beer, free tobacco, free provender for everybody, in typical German plenty.  A ship’s band blared rag-time and horn-pipes all night long. Only the supply of Kiel girls fell short of the demand, but that only made merrier fun for the bluejackets, who, lacking fair partners, danced with one another, and when the hour had become really hilarious, they tripped across the floor, when they were not rolling over it, embracing in threes, bunny-hugging, grotesquely tangoing, turkey-trotting and fish-walking more joyously than men ever reveled before.  There, I thought, was Anglo-German friendship in being--not an ideal, but an actuality.  I am sure the British and German tars at Kiel that boisterous Saturday night which melted into the Sunday of Serajevo little dreamt that when next they would be locked in one another’s arms, it would be at grips for life or death.                                   CHAPTER III                             THE PLOT DEVELOPS   Von G. is a Junker.  He is also Germany’s ablest special correspondent. A Junker, let the uninitiated understand, is a Prussian land baron, or one of his descendants, who considers dominion over the earth and all its worms his by Divine Right.  If, like von G., a Junker is an army officer besides, active or _ausser Dienst_, and had a grandfather who belonged to Moltke’s headquarters in 1870-71, he is the superlatively real thing.  So, as my mission in Germany was study of the Fatherland in its characteristic ramifications, I always felt myself richly favored by the friendship and professional comradeship of von G. He was Junkerism incarnate.  Several years’ residence in the United States had signally failed to corrode von G.’s Junker instincts.  Indeed, it intensified them, for he was ever after a confirmed believer in the ignominious failure of Democracy.  It was he who popularized \"Dollarica\" as a German nickname for \"God’s country.\"  Von G. and I roomed together at Kiel, sharing apartments and a bath in the harbormaster’s flat above the Imperial Yacht Club postoffice, whose two stories of brick and stucco serve as \"annex\" to the always overcrowded and palatial Krupp hotel, the Seebade-Anstalt, at the other end of the flowered club grounds. That bath, which I mention in no spirit of ablutionary arrogance, has to do with the story of von G., for it was to bring me on a day destined to be historic in violent conflict with Junkerism.  Von G. and I regulated the bath situation at Kiel by leaving word on our landlady’s slate the night before which of us would bathe first next morning and at what hour. The bath happened to adjoin my sleeping quarters and von G. could not reach it except by crossing my bedroom, which he always entered without knocking. On Sunday, June 28, fateful day, von G. was timed to bathe at eight A.M., I at nine--so read the schedule inscribed by our respective hands on the good _Frau Hafenmcistcr’s_ tablet.  At seven-thirty I was roused from my feathered slumbers by her soft footsteps--the softest steps of German harbormasters’ wives are quite audible--as she trundled across the room to arrange Herr von G.’s eight o’clock dip.  Junkers are punctual people, but that morning mine was late.  Eight, eight-thirty, eighty-forty-five passed, and there was no sign of him.  When nine o’clock came, I thought I might reasonably conclude, in my rude, inconsiderate"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41252"],["title","The Assault: Germany Before the Outbreak and England in War-Time (#6)"],["body","way, that von G. had overslept or postponed his bath, so I made for the tub at the hour I had intended to.  I was just stepping one foot into it when--it was nine-ten now--von G., rubbing his eyes, bolted in.  \"What do you mean by taking my bath?\" he yelled at me.  \"That’s some of your damned American impudence!\"  Whereupon, imperturbably pouring the rest of me into the bath, I ventured to suggest to Field-Marshal von G., that if he would drop the barrack-yard tone and remember that I was neither a _Dachshund_ nor a Pomeranian recruit, I would deign to hold converse on the point under debate.  I am not sure I spoke as calmly as that sounds, for to gain a conversational lap on a German you must outshout him.  At any rate, von G., abandoning abuse, stalked whimperingly from the room, fired some rearguard shrapnel about \"just like an American’s ’nerve’,\" and bathed later in the day.  I did not see him again until about five o’clock that afternoon.  He bolted into my room this time, too, but in excitement, not anger.  \"The Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife have been assassinated,\" he exclaimed.  \"Good God!\" I rejoined, stupefied.  \"It’s a good thing,\" said von G. quietly.  For many days and nights I wondered what the Junker meant.  I think I know now.  He meant that the War Party (of which he was a very potent and zealous member) had at length found a pretext for forcing upon Europe the struggle for which the German War Lords regarded themselves vastly more ready than any possible combination of foes.  The first year of the war has amply demonstrated the accuracy of their calculations. Germany’s triumphs in the opening twelvemonth of Armageddon were the triumphs of the superlatively prepared.  If Serajevo had not come along when it did--with the German military establishment just built up to a peace-footing of nearly one million officers and men and re-armed at a cost of two hundred and fifty million dollars; with von Tirpitz’s Fleet at the acme of its efficiency; with the Kiel Canal reconstructed for the passage of super-dreadnought ironclads--Germany’s readiness for war might have been fatally inferior to that of her enemies-to-be.  The Fatherland was ready, armed to the teeth, as nation never was before. The psychological moment had dawned.  This was the reassuring state of affairs at home. What did the War Party see when it put its mailed hand to the vizor and looked abroad, across to England, west over the Rhine to France, and toward Russia?  It saw Great Britain on what truly enough looked to most of the world like the brink of revolution in Ireland.  It saw a France, of which a great Senator had only a few days before said that her forts were defective, her guns short of ammunition and her army lacking in even such rudimentary war sinews as sufficient boots for the troops.  It saw a Russia stirred by industrial strife which seemed to need only the threat of grave foreign complications to inflame her always rebellious proletariat into revolt.  Serajevo had all the earmarks of providential timeliness.  \"It’s a good thing,\" said the sententious von G.  The \"trippers\" from Hamburg and nearer-by points in Schleswig-Holstein, whom the Sunday of Kiel Week attracts by the thousand, were far more stunned than von G. by the news from Bosnia, which put so tragic an end to their seaside holiday.  The esplanade, which had been throbbing with bustle and glittering with color, did not know at first why all the ships in the harbor, British as well as German, had suddenly lowered their pennants to half-mast, or why the Austrian royal standard had suddenly broken out, also at the mourning altitude.  The Kaiser was racing in the Baltic.  \"Old Franz Josef,\" some said, \"has died.  He’s been going for many a day.\"  Presently the truth percolated through the awestruck crowds. The sleek white naval dispatch-boat _Sleipner_ tore through the Bay, Baltic-bound.  She carries news to William II when he governs Germany from the quarter-deck of the _Hohenzollern_.  _Sleipner_ dodged eel-like, through the lines of British and German men-of-war, ocean liners, pleasure-craft and racing-yachts anchored here, there and everywhere.  In fifteen minutes she was alongside the Emperor’s fleet schooner, _Meteor V_, which had broken off her race on receipt of wireless tidings of the Archducal couple’s murderous fate.  The _Hohenzollern_ had already \"wirelessed\" for the fastest torpedo-boat in port to fetch the Kaiser and his staff off the _Meteor_, and the destroyer and _Sleipner_ snorted up, foam-bespattered, almost simultaneously.  The Emperor clambered into the torpedo-boat and started for the harbor.  It was the face of a William II, blanched ashen-gray, which turned from the bridge of the destroyer to acknowledge, in solemn gravity, the salutes of the officers and crew of the British flagship, as the Kaiser’s craft raced past the _King George V_.  Always stern of mien, the Emperor now looked severity personified. His staff stood apart.  He seemed to wish to be alone, absolutely, with the overwhelming thoughts of the moment.  Three minutes later, and he stepped aboard the _Hohenzollern_.  Now another pennant showed at the mainmast of the Imperial yacht--the blue and yellow signal flag which means: \"His Majesty is aboard, but preoccupied.\"  I wonder if posterity will ever know what monumental reflections flitted through the Kaiser’s mind in that first hour after Serajevo? Did he, like von G., think it was \"a good thing,\" too? I suppose the first stars and stripes to be half-masted anywhere in the world that dread sundown were those which drooped from the stern of _Utowana_, Mr. Allison Vincent Armour’s steam-yacht, anchored in the Bay off Kiel Naval Academy.  A puffing little launch took me out to the _Utowana_ as soon as I had gathered some coherent facts, which I wanted to present to Mr. Armour and his guests, American Ambassador and Mrs. James W. Gerard, of Berlin, who had motored to Kiel the day before.  Mrs. Gerard’s sister, Countess Sigray, is the wife of a Hungarian nobleman, and the Ambassador’s wife, if my memory serves me correctly, once told me of her sister’s acquaintance with both of the assassinated Royalties.  We Americans discussed the immediate consequences of the day’s event--how the Kaiser would take it, how it would affect poor old Emperor Francis Joseph.  William II and Admiral von Tirpitz had been the Archduke’s guests at Konopischt in Bohemia only a few weeks before.  The Kaiser and the future ruler of Austria-Hungary had become great friends.  They were not always that. There had been a good deal of the William II in Franz Ferdinand himself. People often said it was a case of Greek meet Greek, and that two such insistent personalities were inevitably bound to clash. Others said that the Archduke, inspired by his brilliantly clever consort, always insisted that German overlordship in Vienna would cease when he came to the throne.  Still others knew that despite antipathies and antagonisms, the two men had at length come to be genuinely fond of each other, and that their ideas and ideals for the greater glory of Germanic Europe coincided.  These things we chatted and canvassed, irresponsibly, on _Utowana’s_ immaculate deck.  All of us were persuaded of the imminency of a crisis in Austrian-Serbian relations in consequence of Princip’s crime. But I am quite sure not a soul of us held himself capable of imagining that, because of that remote felony, Great Britain and Germany would be at war five weeks later.  Beyond us spread the peaceful panorama of British and German war-craft, anchored side by side, and the thought would have perished at birth.  Returned to the terrace of the Seebade-Anstalt, one found the atmosphere heavily charged with suppressed excitement.  Immaculately-groomed young diplomats, down from Berlin for the Sunday, were twirling their walking-sticks and yellow gloves which were not, after all, to accompany them to Grand-Admiral Prince Henry of Prussia’s garden-party.  That, like everything else connected with Kiel Week, had suddenly been called off.  A party of Americans flocked together at the entrance to the hotel to exchange low-spoken views on the all-pervading topic.  There was big Lieutenant-Commander Walter R. Gherardi, our wide-awake Berlin Naval Attaché, resplendent in gala gold-braided uniform, and Mrs. Gherardi, who had motored me around the environs of Kiel that morning; Albert Billings Ruddock, Third Secretary of the Embassy, and his pretty and clever wife; and Lanier Winslow, Ambassador Gerard’s private secretary, his effervescent good nature repressed for the first time I ever remembered observing it in that unbecoming and unnatural condition. Secretary Ruddock’s father, Mr. Charles H. Ruddock, of New York, completed the group.  I met Mr. Ruddock, Sr., six months later in New York.  \"Do you remember what you told me that afternoon at Kiel, when we were discussing Serajevo?\" he asked.  I pleaded a lapse of recollection. \"You said,\" he reminded me, \"’this means war.’\"  The aspect of Kiel became in the twinkling of an eye as funereal as Serajevo and Vienna themselves must have been in that blood-bespattered hour.  Bands stopped playing, flags not lowered to half-mast were hauled down altogether, and beer-gardens emptied. \"Hohenzollern weather,\" Teuton synonym for invincible sunshine, vanished in keeping with the drooping spirits of everybody and everything, and bleak thunder-showers intermingled with flashes of heat-lightning to complete the _mise en scène_.  A week of gaiety unsurpassed evaporated into gloom and foreboding.  For myself it had been a week crowded with great recollections.  Special correspondents telegraphing to influential foreign newspapers, particularly if they were English and American newspapers, were always _persona gratissima_ with German dignitaries, even of the blood royal. The group of us on duty at what, alas! was to be the last Kiel Week, at least of the"]]]
