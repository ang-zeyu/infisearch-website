If ever near enough a Rebel camp, we were sure to hear its wailing crescendo rising upon the air from the lips or instruments of some one more quartered there.  At Richmond it rang upon us constantly from some source or another, and the same was true wherever else we went in the so-called Confederacy.  All familiar with Scotch songs will readily recognize the name and air as an old friend, and one of the fierce Jacobite melodies that for a long time disturbed the tranquility of the Brunswick family on the English throne.  The new words supplied by the Rebels are the merest doggerel, and fit the music as poorly as the unchanged name of the song fitted to its new use.  The flag of the Rebellion was not a bonnie blue one; but had quite as much red and white as azure.  It did not have a single star, but thirteen.  Near in popularity was \"Maryland, My Maryland.\"  The versification of this was of a much higher Order, being fairly respectable.  The air is old, and a familiar one to all college students, and belongs to one of the most common of German household songs:            O, Tannenbaum! O, Tannenbaum, wie tru sind deine Blatter!           Da gruenst nicht nur zur Sommerseit,           Nein, auch in Winter, when es Schneit, etc.  which Longfellow has finely translated,  O, hemlock tree!  O, hemlock tree! how faithful are thy branches! Green not alone in Summer time, But in the Winter's float and rime. O, hemlock tree O, hemlock tree! how faithful are thy branches.  Etc.  The Rebel version ran:            MARYLAND.  The despot's heel is on thy shore,           Maryland! His touch is at thy temple door,           Maryland! Avenge the patriotic gore That flecked the streets of Baltimore, And be the battle queen of yore, Maryland! My Maryland!  Hark to the wand'ring son's appeal,           Maryland! My mother State, to thee I kneel,           Maryland! For life and death, for woe and weal, Thy peerless chivalry reveal, And gird thy beauteous limbs with steel, Maryland! My Maryland!  Thou wilt not cower in the duet,           Maryland! Thy beaming sword shall never rust           Maryland! Remember Carroll's sacred trust, Remember Howard's warlike thrust-- And all thy slumberers with the just, Maryland!  My Maryland!  Come! 'tis the red dawn of the day,           Maryland! Come! with thy panoplied array,           Maryland! With Ringgold's spirit for the fray, With Watson's blood at Monterey, With fearless Lowe and dashing May, Maryland!  My Maryland!  Comet for thy shield is bright and strong,           Maryland! Come! for thy dalliance does thee wrong,           Maryland! Come! to thins own heroic throng, That stalks with Liberty along, And give a new Key to thy song, Maryland!  My Maryland!  Dear Mother! burst the tyrant's chain,           Maryland! Virginia should not call in vain,           Maryland! She meets her sisters on the plain-- 'Sic semper' 'tis the proud refrain, That baffles millions back amain,           Maryland! Arise, in majesty again, Maryland!  My Maryland!  I see the blush upon thy cheek,           Maryland! But thou wast ever bravely meek,           Maryland! But lo! there surges forth a shriek From hill to hill, from creek to creek-- Potomac calls to Chesapeake, Maryland!  My Maryland!  Thou wilt not yield the vandal toll.           Maryland! Thou wilt not crook to his control,           Maryland! Better the fire upon thee roll, Better the blade, the shot, the bowl, Than crucifixion of the soul, Maryland!  My Maryland!  I hear the distant Thunder hem,           Maryland! The Old Line's bugle, fife, and drum.           Maryland! She is not dead, nor deaf, nor dumb-- Hnzza! she spurns the Northern scum! She breathes--she burns! she'll come! she'll come! Maryland!  My Maryland!   \"Stonewall Jackson Crossing into Maryland,\" was another travesty, of about the same literary merit, or rather demerit, as \"The Bonnie Blue Flag.\"  Its air was that of the well-known and popular negro minstrel song, \"Billy Patterson.\"  For all that, it sounded very martial and stirring when played by a brass band.  We heard these songs with tiresome iteration, daily and nightly, during our stay in the Southern Confederacy.  Some one of the guards seemed to be perpetually beguiling the weariness of his watch by singing in all keys, in every sort of a voice, and with the wildest latitude as to air and time.  They became so terribly irritating to us, that to this day the remembrance of those soul-lacerating lyrics abides with me as one of the chief of the minor torments of our situation.  They were, in fact, nearly as bad as the lice.  We revenged ourselves as best we could by constructing fearfully wicked, obscene and insulting parodies on these, and by singing them with irritating effusiveness in the hearing of the guards who were inflicting these nuisances upon us.  Of the same nature was the garrison music.  One fife, played by an asthmatic old fellow whose breathings were nearly as audible as his notes, and one rheumatic drummer, constituted the entire band for the post.  The fifer actually knew but one tune \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\" --and did not know that well.  But it was all that he had, and he played it with wearisome monotony for every camp call--five or six times a day, and seven days in the week.  He called us up in the morning with it for a reveille; he sounded the \"roll call\" and \"drill call,\" breakfast, dinner and supper with it, and finally sent us to bed, with the same dreary wail that had rung in our ears all day.  I never hated any piece of music as I came to hate that threnody of treason.  It would have been such a relief if the old asthmatic who played it could have been induced to learn another tune to play on Sundays, and give us one day of rest.  He did not, but desecrated the Lord's Day by playing as vilely as on the rest of the week.  The Rebels were fully conscious of their musical deficiencies, and made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to induce the musicians among the prisoners to come outside and form a band.      CHAPTER XLV.  AUGUST--NEEDLES STUCK IN PUMPKIN SEEDS--SOME PHENOMENA OF STARVATION --RIOTING IN REMEMBERED LUXURIES.  \"Illinoy,\" said tall, gaunt Jack North, of the One Hundred and Fourteenth Illinois, to me, one day, as we sat contemplating our naked, and sadly attenuated underpinning; \"what do our legs and feet most look most like?\"  \"Give it up, Jack,\" said I.  \"Why--darning needles stuck in pumpkin seeds, of course.\"  I never heard a better comparison for our wasted limbs.  The effects of the great bodily emaciation were sometimes very startling. Boys of a fleshy habit would change so in a few weeks as to lose all resemblance to their former selves, and comrades who came into prison later would utterly fail to recognize them.  Most fat men, as most large men, died in a little while after entering, though there were exceptions. One of these was a boy of my own company, named George Hillicks.  George had shot up within a few years to over six feet in hight, and then, as such boys occasionally do, had, after enlisting with us, taken on such a development of flesh that we nicknamed him the \"Giant,\" and he became a pretty good load for even the strongest horse.  George held his flesh through Belle Isle, and the earlier weeks in Andersonville, but June, July, and August \"fetched him,\" as the boys said.  He seemed to melt away like an icicle on a Spring day, and he grew so thin that his hight seemed preternatural.  We called him \"Flagstaff,\" and cracked all sorts of jokes about putting an insulator on his head, and setting him up for a telegraph pole, braiding his legs and using him for a whip lash, letting his hair grow a little longer, and trading him off to the Rebels for a sponge and staff for the artillery, etc.  We all expected him to die, and looked continually for the development of the fatal scurvy symptoms, which were to seal his doom.  But he worried through, and came out at last in good shape, a happy result due as much as to anything else to his having in Chester Hayward, of Prairie City, Ill.,--one of the most devoted chums I ever knew.  Chester nursed and looked out for George with wife-like fidelity, and had his reward in bringing him safe through our lines.  There were thousands of instances of this generous devotion to each other by chums in Andersonville, and I know of nothing that reflects any more credit upon our boy soldiers.  There was little chance for any one to accumulate flesh on the rations we were receiving.  I say it in all soberness that I do not believe that a healthy hen could have grown fat upon them.  I am sure that any good-sized \"shanghai\" eats more every day than the meager half loaf that we had to maintain life upon.  Scanty as this was, and hungry as all were, very many could not eat it.  Their stomachs revolted against the trash; it became so nauseous to them that they could not force it down, even when famishing, and they died of starvation with the chunks of the so-called bread under their head.  I found myself rapidly approaching this condition.  I had been blessed with a good digestion and a talent for sleeping under the most discouraging circumstances.  These, I have no doubt, were of the greatest assistance to me in my struggle for existence.  But now the rations became fearfully obnoxious to me, and it was only with the greatest effort--pulling the bread into little pieces and swallowing each, of these as one would a pill--that I succeeded in worrying the stuff down.  I had not as yet fallen away very much, but as I had never, up, to that time, weighed so much as one hundred and twenty-five pounds, there was no great amount of adipose to lose.  It was evident that unless some change occurred my time was near at hand.  There was not only hunger for more food, but longing with an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4259"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons — Volume 3 (#3)"],["body","beyond expression for alteration of some kind in the rations. The changeless monotony of the miserable saltless bread, or worse mush, for days, weeks and months, became unbearable.  If those wretched mule teams had only once a month hauled in something different--if they had come in loaded with sweet potatos, green corn or wheat flour, there would be thousands of men still living who now slumber beneath those melancholy pines.  It would have given something to look forward to, and remember when past.  But to know each day that the gates would open to admit the same distasteful apologies for food took away the appetite and raised one's gorge, even while famishing for something to eat.  We could for a while forget the stench, the lice, the heat, the maggots, the dead and dying around us, the insulting malignance of our jailors; but it was, very hard work to banish thoughts and longings for food from our minds.  Hundreds became actually insane from brooding over it.  Crazy men could be found in all parts of the camp.  Numbers of them wandered around entirely naked.  Their babblings and maunderings about something to eat were painful to hear.  I have before mentioned the case of the Plymouth Pilgrim near me, whose insanity took the form of imagining that he was sitting at the table with his family, and who would go through the show of helping them to imaginary viands and delicacies.  The cravings for green food of those afflicted with the scurvy were, agonizing.  Large numbers of watermelons were brought to the prison, and sold to those who had the money to pay for them at from one to five dollars, greenbacks, apiece.  A boy who had means to buy a piece of these would be followed about while eating it by a crowd of perhaps twenty-five or thirty livid-gummed scorbutics, each imploring him for the rind when he was through with it.  We thought of food all day, and were visited with torturing dreams of it at night.  One of the pleasant recollections of my pre-military life was a banquet at the \"Planter's House,\" St.  Louis, at which I was a boyish guest.  It was, doubtless, an ordinary affair, as banquets go, but to me then, with all the keen appreciation of youth and first experience, it was a feast worthy of Lucullus.  But now this delightful reminiscence became a torment.  Hundreds of times I dreamed I was again at the \"Planter's.\"  I saw the wide corridors, with their mosaic pavement; I entered the grand dining-room, keeping timidly near the friend to whose kindness I owed this wonderful favor; I saw again the mirror-lined walls, the evergreen decked ceilings, the festoons and mottos, the tables gleaming with cutglass and silver, the buffets with wines and fruits, the brigade of sleek, black, white-aproned waiters, headed by one who had presence enough for a major General.  Again I reveled in all the dainties and dishes on the bill-of-fare; calling for everything that I dared to, just to see what each was like, and to be able to say afterwards that I had partaken of it; all these bewildering delights of the first realization of what a boy has read and wondered much over, and longed for, would dance their rout and reel through my somnolent brain.  Then I would awake to find myself a half-naked, half-starved, vermin-eaten wretch, crouching in a hole in the ground, waiting for my keepers to fling me a chunk of corn bread.  Naturally the boys--and especially the country boys and new prisoners --talked much of victuals--what they had had, and what they would have again, when they got out.  Take this as a sample of the conversation which might be heard in any group of boys, sitting together on the sand, killin lice and talking of exchange:  Tom--\"Well, Bill, when we get back to God's country, you and Jim and John must all come to my house and take dinner with me.  I want to give you a square meal.  I want to show you just what good livin' is.  You know my mother is just the best cook in all that section.  When she lays herself out to get up a meal all the other women in the neighborhood just stand back and admire!\"  Bill--\"O, that's all right; but I'll bet she can't hold a candle to my mother, when it comes to good cooking.\"  Jim--\"No, nor to mine.\"  John--(with patronizing contempt.) \"O, shucks!  None of you fellers were ever at our house, even when we had one of our common weekday dinners.\"  Tom--(unheedful of the counter claims.) I hev teen studyin' up the dinner I'd like, and the bill-of-fare I'd set out for you fellers when you come over to see me.  First, of course, we'll lay the foundation like with a nice, juicy loin roast, and some mashed potatos.  Bill--(interrupting.) \"Now, do you like mashed potatos with beef?  The way may mother does is to pare the potatos, and lay them in the pan along with the beef.  Then, you know, they come out just as nice and crisp, and brown; they have soaked up all the beef gravy, and they crinkle between your teeth--\"  Jim--\"Now, I tell you, mashed Neshannocks with butter on 'em is plenty good enough for me.\"  John--\"If you'd et some of the new kind of peachblows that we raised in the old pasture lot the year before I enlisted, you'd never say another word about your Neshannocks.\"  Tom--(taking breath and starting in fresh.) \"Then we'll hev some fried Spring chickens, of our dominick breed.  Them dominicks of ours have the nicest, tenderest meat, better'n quail, a darned sight, and the way my mother can fry Spring chickens----\"  Bill--(aside to Jim.) \"Every durned woman in the country thinks she can 'spry ching frickens;' but my mother---\"  John--\"You fellers all know that there's nobody knows half as much about chicken doin's as these 'tinerant Methodis' preachers.  They give 'em chicken wherever they go, and folks do say that out in the new settlements they can't get no preachin', no gospel, nor nothin', until the chickens become so plenty that a preacher is reasonably sure of havin' one for his dinner wherever he may go.  Now, there's old Peter Cartwright, who has traveled over Illinoy and Indianny since the Year One, and preached more good sermons than any other man who ever set on saddle-bags, and has et more chickens than there are birds in a big pigeon roost.  Well, he took dinner at our house when he came up to dedicate the big, white church at Simpkin's Corners, and when he passed up his plate the third time for more chicken, he sez, sez he:--I've et at a great many hundred tables in the fifty years I have labored in the vineyard of the Redeemer, but I must say, Mrs. Kiggins, that your way of frying chickens is a leetle the nicest that I ever knew.  I only wish that the sisters generally would get your reseet.'  Yes, that's what he said,--'a leetle the nicest.'\"  Tom--\"An' then, we'll hev biscuits an' butter.  I'll just bet five hundred dollars to a cent, and give back the cent if I win, that we have the best butter at our house that there is in Central Illinoy.  You can't never hev good butter onless you have a spring house; there's no use of talkin'--all the patent churns that lazy men ever invented--all the fancy milk pans an' coolers, can't make up for a spring house.  Locations for a spring house are scarcer than hen's teeth in Illinoy, but we hev one, and there ain't a better one in Orange County, New York.  Then you'll see dome of the biscuits my mother makes.\"  Bill--\"Well, now, my mother's a boss biscuit-maker, too.\"  Jim--\"You kin just gamble that mine is.\"  John--\"O, that's the way you fellers ought to think an' talk, but my mother----\"  Tom--(coming in again with fresh vigor) \"They're jest as light an' fluffy as a dandelion puff, and they melt in your month like a ripe Bartlett pear.  You just pull 'em open--Now you know that I think there's nothin' that shows a person's raisin' so well as to see him eat biscuits an' butter.  If he's been raised mostly on corn bread, an' common doins,' an' don't know much about good things to eat, he'll most likely cut his biscuit open with a case knife, an' make it fall as flat as one o' yesterday's pancakes.  But if he is used to biscuits, has had 'em often at his house, he'll--just pull 'em open, slow an' easy like, then he'll lay a little slice of butter inside, and drop a few drops of clear honey on this, an' stick the two halves back, together again, an--\"  \"Oh, for God Almighty's sake, stop talking that infernal nonsense,\" roar out a half dozen of the surrounding crowd, whose mouths have been watering over this unctuous recital of the good things of the table. \"You blamed fools, do you want to drive yourselves and everybody else crazy with such stuff as that.  Dry up and try to think of something else.\"     CHAPTER XLVI.  SURLY BRITON--THE STOLID COURAGE THAT MAKES THE ENGLISH FLAG A BANNER OF TRIUMPH--OUR COMPANY BUGLER, HIS CHARACTERISTICS AND HIS DEATH--URGENT DEMAND FOR MECHANICS--NONE WANT TO GO--TREATMENT OF A REBEL SHOEMAKER --ENLARGEMENT OF THE STOCKADE--IT IS BROKEN BY A STORM --THE WONDERFUL SPRING.  Early in August, F. Marriott, our Company Bugler, died.  Previous to coming to America he had been for many years an English soldier, and I accepted him as a type of that stolid, doggedly brave class, which forms the bulk of the English armies, and has for centuries carried the British flag with dauntless courage into every land under the sun.  Rough, surly and unsocial, he did his duty with the unemotional steadiness of a machine.  He knew nothing but to obey orders, and obeyed them under all circumstances promptly, but with stony impassiveness.  With the command to move forward into action, he moved forward without a word, and with face as blank as a side of sole leather.  He went as far as ordered, halted at the word, and retired at command as phlegmatically as he advanced.  If he cared a straw whether he advanced or retreated, if it mattered to the extent of a pinch of salt whether we whipped the Rebels or they defeated us, he kept that feeling so deeply hidden in the recesses of his sturdy bosom that "]]]
