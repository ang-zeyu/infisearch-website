If you hadn't had a magic leg, instead of a meat one, you couldn't have knocked me over so easily and stuck this wooden pin through me.\"  \"I've been to the Magic Isle,\" said the Glass Cat, \"and I've watched the Magic Flower bloom, and I'm sure it's too pretty to be left in that lonely place where only beasts prowl around it and no else sees it.  So we're going to take it away to the Emerald City.\"  \"I don't care,\" the beast replied in a surly tone.  \"We Kalidahs would be just as contented if there wasn't a flower in our forest.  What good are the things anyhow?\"  \"Don't you like pretty things?\" asked Trot.  \"No.\"  \"You ought to admire my pink brains, anyhow,\" declared the Glass Cat. \"They're beautiful and you can see 'em work.\"  The beast only growled in reply, and Cap'n Bill, having now cut all his logs to a proper size, began to roll them to the water's edge and fasten them together.     10.  Stuck Fast   The day was nearly gone when, at last, the raft was ready.  \"It ain't so very big,\" said the old sailor, \"but I don't weigh much, an' you, Trot, don't weigh half as much as I do, an' the glass pussy don't count.\"  \"But it's safe, isn't it?\" inquired the girl.  \"Yes; it's good enough to carry us to the island an' back again, an' that's about all we can expect of it.\"  Saying this, Cap'n Bill pushed the raft into the water, and when it was afloat, stepped upon it and held out his hand to Trot, who quickly followed him.  The Glass Cat boarded the raft last of all.  The sailor had cut a long pole, and had also whittled a flat paddle, and with these he easily propelled the raft across the river.  As they approached the island, the Wonderful Flower became more plainly visible, and they quickly decided that the Glass Cat had not praised it too highly.  The colors of the flowers that bloomed in quick succession were strikingly bright and beautiful, and the shapes of the blossoms were varied and curious.  Indeed, they did not resemble ordinary flowers at all.  So intently did Trot and Cap'n Bill gaze upon the Golden Flower-pot that held the Magic Flower that they scarcely noticed the island itself until the raft beached upon its sands.  But then the girl exclaimed: \"How funny it is, Cap'n Bill, that nothing else grows here excep' the Magic Flower.\"  Then the sailor glanced at the island and saw that it was all bare ground, without a weed, a stone or a blade of grass.  Trot, eager to examine the Flower closer, sprang from the raft and ran up the bank until she reached the Golden Flower-pot.  Then she stood beside it motionless and filled with wonder.  Cap'n Bill joined her, coming more leisurely, and he, too, stood in silent admiration for a time.  \"Ozma will like this,\" remarked the Glass Cat, sitting down to watch the shifting hues of the flowers.  \"I'm sure she won't have as fine a birthday present from anyone else.\"  \"Do you 'spose it's very heavy, Cap'n?  And can we get it home without breaking it?\" asked Trot anxiously.  \"Well, I've lifted many bigger things than that,\" he replied; \"but let's see what it weighs.\"  He tried to take a step forward, but could not lift his meat foot from the ground.  His wooden leg seemed free enough, but the other would not budge.  \"I seem stuck, Trot,\" he said, with a perplexed look at his foot.  \"It ain't mud, an' it ain't glue, but somethin's holdin' me down.\"  The girl attempted to lift her own feet, to go nearer to her friend, but the ground held them as fast as it held Cap'n Bill's foot.  She tried to slide them, or to twist them around, but it was no use; she could not move either foot a hair's breadth.  \"This is funny!\" she exclaimed. \"What do you 'spose has happened to us, Cap'n Bill?\"  \"I'm tryin' to make out,\" he answered.  \"Take off your shoes, Trot. P'raps it's the leather soles that's stuck to the ground.\"  She leaned down and unlaced her shoes, but found she could not pull her feet out of them.  The Glass Cat, which was walking around as naturally as ever, now said:  \"Your foot has got roots to it, Cap'n, and I can see the roots going into the ground, where they spread out in all directions.  It's the same way with Trot.  That's why you can't move.  The roots hold you fast.\"  Cap'n Bill was rather fat and couldn't see his own feet very well, but he squatted down and examined Trot's feet and decided that the Glass Cat was right.  \"This is hard luck,\" he declared, in a voice that showed he was uneasy at the discovery.  \"We're pris'ners, Trot, on this funny island, an' I'd like to know how we're ever goin' to get loose, so's we can get home again.\"  \"Now I know why the Kalidah laughed at us,\" said the girl, \"and why he said none of the beasts ever came to this island.  The horrid creature knew we'd be caught, and wouldn't warn us.\"  In the meantime, the Kalidah, although pinned fast to the earth by Cap'n Bill's stake, was facing the island, and now the ugly expression which passed over its face when it defied and sneered at Cap'n Bill and Trot, had changed to one of amusement and curiosity.  When it saw the adventurers had actually reached the island and were standing beside the Magic Flower, it heaved a breath of satisfaction--a long, deep breath that swelled its deep chest until the beast could feel the stake that held him move a little, as if withdrawing itself from the ground.  \"Ah ha!\" murmured the Kalidah, \"a little more of this will set me free and allow me to escape!\"  So he began breathing as hard as he could, puffing out his chest as much as possible with each indrawing breath, and by doing this he managed to raise the stake with each powerful breath, until at last the Kalidah--using the muscles of his four legs as well as his deep breaths--found itself free of the sandy soil.  The stake was sticking right through him, however, so he found a rock deeply set in the bank and pressed the sharp point of the stake upon the surface of this rock until he had driven it clear through his body.  Then, by getting the stake tangled among some thorny bushes, and wiggling his body, he managed to draw it out altogether.  \"There!\" he exclaimed, \"except for those two holes in me, I'm as good as ever; but I must admit that that old wooden-legged fellow saved both himself and the girl by making me a prisoner.\"  Now the Kalidahs, although the most disagreeable creatures in the Land of Oz, were nevertheless magical inhabitants of a magical Fairyland, and in their natures a certain amount of good was mingled with the evil.  This one was not very revengeful, and now that his late foes were in danger of perishing, his anger against them faded away.  \"Our own Kalidah King,\" he reflected, \"has certain magical powers of his own.  Perhaps he knows how to fill up these two holes in my body.\"  So without paying any more attention to Trot and Cap'n Bill than they were paying to him, he entered the forest and trotted along a secret path that led to the hidden lair of all the Kalidahs.  While the Kalidah was making good its escape Cap'n Bill took his pipe from his pocket and filled it with tobacco and lighted it.  Then, as he puffed out the smoke, he tried to think what could be done.  \"The Glass Cat seems all right,\" he said, \"an' my wooden leg didn't take roots and grow, either.  So it's only flesh that gets caught.\"  \"It's magic that does it, Cap'n!\"  \"I know, Trot, and that's what sticks me.  We're livin' in a magic country, but neither of us knows any magic an' so we can't help ourselves.\"  \"Couldn't the Wizard of Oz help us--or Glinda the Good?\" asked the little girl.  \"Ah, now we're beginnin' to reason,\" he answered.  \"I'd probably thought o' that, myself, in a minute more.  By good luck the Glass Cat is free, an' so it can run back to the Emerald City an' tell the Wizard about our fix, an' ask him to come an' help us get loose.\"  \"Will you go?\" Trot asked the cat, speaking very earnestly.  \"I'm no messenger, to be sent here and there,\" asserted the curious animal in a sulky tone of voice.  \"Well,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"you've got to go home, anyhow, 'cause you don't want to stay here, I take it.  And, when you get home, it wouldn't worry you much to tell the Wizard what's happened to us.\"  \"That's true,\" said the cat, sitting on its haunches and lazily washing its face with one glass paw.  \"I don't mind telling the Wizard--when I get home.\"  \"Won't you go now?\" pleaded Trot.  \"We don't want to stay here any longer than we can help, and everybody in Oz will be interested in you, and call you a hero, and say nice things about you because you helped your friends out of trouble.\"  That was the best way to manage the Glass Cat, which was so vain that it loved to be praised.  \"I'm going home right away,\" said the creature, \"and I'll tell the Wizard to come and help you.\"  Saying this, it walked down to the water and disappeared under the surface.  Not being able to manage the raft alone, the Glass Cat walked on the bottom of the river as it had done when it visited the island before, and soon they saw it appear on the farther bank and trot into the forest, where it was quickly lost to sight among the trees.  Then Trot heaved a deep sigh.  \"Cap'n,\" said she, \"we're in a bad fix.  There's nothing here to eat, and we can't even lie down to sleep.  Unless the Glass Cat hurries, and the Wizard hurries, I don't know what's going to become of us!\"     11.  The Beasts of the Forest of Gugu   That was a wonderful gathering of wild animals in the Forest of Gugu next sunrise.  Rango, the Gray Ape, had even called his monkey sentinels away from the forest edge, and every beast, little and big, was in the great clearing where meetings were held on occasions of great importance.  In the center of the clearing stood a great shelving rock, having a flat, inclined surface, and on this sat the stately Leopard Gugu, who was King of the Forest.  On the ground beneath him squatted Bru the Bear, Loo the Unicorn, and Rango the Gray Ape, the King's three Counselors, and in front of them stood the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41905"],["title","Captives of the Flame (#0)"],["body","*       *       *       *       *                              CAPTIVES OF THE FLAME                             by SAMUEL R.

It is,      however, his second published novel, his first being _The Jewels of      Aptor_, Ace Book F-173, which has received considerable acclaim.       A young man, resident in New York City, Delany is a prolific and      talented writer, whose work in poetry and prose have won him many      awards. Asked for comment on his literary ambitions, he preferred      to quote one of the characters from one of his works:       \"I wanted to wield together a prose luminous as twenty sets of      headlights flung down a night road; I wanted my words tinged with      the green of mercury vapor street lamps seen through a shaling of      oak leaves in the park past midnight. I needed phrases that would      break open like thunder, or leave a brush as gentle as willow      boughs passed in a dark room.... The finest writing is always the      finest delineation of surfaces.\"         *       *       *       *       *     PROLOGUE   The green of beetles' wings ... the red of polished carbuncle ... a web of silver fire. Lightning tore his eyes apart, struck deep inside his body; and he felt his bones split. Before it became pain, it was gone. And he was falling through blue smoke. The smoke was inside him, cool as blown ice. It was getting darker.  He had heard something before, a ... voice: the _Lord of the Flames_.... Then:  Jon Koshar shook his head, staggered forward, and went down on his knees in white sand. He blinked. He looked up. There were two shadows in front of him.  To his left a tooth of rock jutted from the sand, also casting a double shadow. He felt unreal, light. But the backs of his hands had real dirt on them, his clothes were damp with real sweat, and they clung to his back and sides. He felt immense. But that was because the horizon was so close. Above it, the sky was turquoise--which was odd because the sand was too white for it to be evening. Then he saw the City.  It hit his eyes with a familiarity that made him start. The familiarity was a refuge, and violently his mind clawed at it, tried to find other familiar things. But the towers, the looped roadways, that was all there was--and one small line of metal ribbon that soared out across the desert, supported by strut-work pylons. The transit ribbon! He followed it with his eyes, praying it would lead to something more familiar. The thirteenth pylon--he had counted them as he ran his eye along the silver length--was crumpled, as though a fist had smashed it. The transit ribbon snarled in mid-air and ceased. The abrupt end again sent his mind clawing back toward familiarity: _I am Jon Koshar_ (followed by the meaningless number that had been part of his name for five years). _I want to be free_ (and for a moment he saw again the dank, creosoted walls of the cabins of the penal camp, and heard the clinking chains of the cutter teeth as he had heard them for so many days walking to the mine entrance while the yard-high ferns brushed his thighs and forearms ... but that was in his mind).  The only other things his scrambling brain could reach were facts of negation. He was some place he had _never_ been before. He did _not_ know how he had gotten there. He did _not_ know how to get back. And the close horizon, the double shadows ... now he realized that this was _not_ Earth (Earth of the Thirty-fifth Century, although he gave it another name, Fifteenth Century G.F.).  But the City.... It was on earth, and he was on earth, and he was--had been--in it. Again the negations: the City was _not_ on a desert, nor could its dead, deserted towers cast double shadows, nor was the transit ribbon broken.  The transit ribbon!  No!  It couldn't be broken. He almost screamed. _Don't let it be broken, please...._  The entire scene was suddenly jerked from his head. There was nothing left but blue smoke, cool as blown ice, inside him, around him. He was spinning in blue smoke. Sudden lightning seared his eyeballs, and the shivering after-image faded, shifted, became ... a web of silver fire, the red of polished carbuncle, the green of beetles' wings.     CHAPTER I   Silent as a sleeping serpent for sixty years, it spanned from the heart of Telphar to the royal palace of Toromon. From the ashes of the dead city to the island capital, it connected what once had been the two major cities, the only cities of Toromon. Today there was only one.  In Telphar, it soared above ashes and fallen roadways into the night.  Miles on, the edge of darkness paled before the morning and in the faint shadow of the transit ribbon, at the edge of a field of lava, among the whispering, yard-high ferns, sat row on row of squat shacks, cheerless as roosting macaws. They stood near the entrance of the tetron mines.  A few moments before, the light rain had stopped. Water dribbled down the supporting columns of the transit ribbon which made a black band on the fading night.  Now, six extraordinarily tall men left the edge of the jungle. They carried two corpses among them. Two of the tall men hung back to converse.  \"The third one won't get very far.\"  \"If he does,\" said the other, \"he'll be the first one to get through the forest guards in twelve years.\"  \"I'm not worried about his escaping,\" said the first. \"But why have there been such an increase in attempts over the past year?\"  The other one laughed. Even in the dull light, the three scars that ran down the side of his face and neck were visible. \"The orders for tetron have nearly doubled.\"  \"I wonder just what sort of leeches in Toron make their living off these miserable--\" He didn't finish, but pointed ahead to the corpses.  \"The hydroponic growers, the aquarium manufacturers,\" answered the man with the scars. \"They're the ones who use the ore. Then, of course, there's the preparation for the war.\"  \"They say that since the artificial food growers have taken over, the farmers and fishermen near the coast are being starved out. And with the increased demand for tetron, the miners are dying off like flies here at the mine. Sometimes I wonder how they supply enough prisoners.\"  \"They don't,\" said the other. Now he called out. \"All right. Just drop them there, in front of the cabins.\"  The rain had made the ground mud. Two dull splashes came through the graying morning. \"Maybe that'll teach them some sort of lesson,\" said the first.  \"Maybe,\" shrugged the one with the scars.  Now they turned back toward the jungle.         *       *       *       *       *  Soon, streaks of light speared the yellow clouds and pried apart the billowing rifts. Shafts of yellow sank into the lush jungles of Toromon, dropping from wet, green fronds, or catching on the moist cracks of boulders. Then the dawn snagged on the metal ribbon that arced over the trees, and webs of shadow from the immense supporting pylons fell across the few, gutted lava beds that dotted the forest.  A formation of airships flashed through a tear in the clouds like a handful of hurled, silver chips. As the buzz from their tetron motors descended through the trees, Quorl, the forest guard, stretched his seven-foot body and rolled over, crushing leaves beneath his shoulder. Instinctively his stomach tensed. But silence had returned. With large, yellow-brown eyes, he looked about the grove in which he had spent the night. His broad nostrils flared even wider. But the air was still, clean, safe. Above, the metal ribbon glinted. Quorl lay back on the dried leaves once more.         *       *       *       *       *  As dawn slipped across the jungle, more and more of the ribbon caught fire from beneath the receding shadows, till at last it soared above the yellow crescent of sand that marked the edge of the sea.  Fifty yards down the beach from the last supporting pylon whose base still sat on dry land, Cithon, the fisherman, emerged from his shack.  \"Tel?\" he called. He was a brown, wiry man whose leathery face was netted with lines from sand and wind. \"Tel?\" he called once more. Now he turned back into the cottage. \"And where has the boy gotten off to now?\"  Grella had already seated herself at the loom, and her strong hands now began to work the shuttle back and forth while her feet stamped the treadle.  \"Where has he gone?\" Cithon demanded.  \"He went out early this morning,\" Grella said quietly. She did not look at her husband. She watched the shuttle moving back and forth, back and forth between the green and yellow threads.  \"I can see he's gone out,\" Cithon snapped. \"But where? The sun is up. He should be out with me on the boat. When will he be back?\"  Grella didn't answer.  \"When will he be back?\" Cithon demanded.  \"I don't know.\"  Outside there was a sound, and Cithon turned abruptly and went to the side of the shack.  The boy was leaning over the water trough, sloshing his face.  \"Tel.\"  The boy looked up quickly at his father. He was perhaps fourteen, a thin child, with a shock of black hair, yet eyes as green as the sea. Fear had widened them now.  \"Where were you?\"  \"No place,\" was the boy's quietly defensive answer. \"I wasn't doing anything.\"  \"Where were you?\"  \"No place,\" Tel mumbled again. \"Just walking....\"  Suddenly Cithon's hand, which had been at his waist jerked up and then down, and the leather strap that had been his belt slashed over the boy's wet"]]]
