All during my wanderings I have brooded on how I can be revenged on them.  Now that I've met you I can see a way to conquer the Land of Oz and be King there myself, which is better than being King of the Nomes.\"  \"How can you do that?\" inquired Kiki Aru, wonderingly.  \"Never mind how.  In the first place, I'll make a bargain with you. Tell me the secret of how to perform transformations and I will give you a pocketful of jewels, the biggest and finest that I possess.\"  \"No,\" said Kiki, who realized that to share his power with another would be dangerous to himself.  \"I'll give you TWO pocketsful of jewels,\" said the Nome.  \"No,\" answered Kiki.  \"I'll give you every jewel I possess.\"  \"No, no, no!\" said Kiki, who was beginning to be frightened.  \"Then,\" said the Nome, with a wicked look at the boy, \"I'll tell the inn-keeper that you stole that gold piece and he will have you put in prison.\"  Kiki laughed at the threat.  \"Before he can do that,\" said he, \"I will transform myself into a lion and tear him to pieces, or into a bear and eat him up, or into a fly and fly away where he could not find me.\"  \"Can you really do such wonderful transformations?\" asked the old Nome, looking at him curiously.  \"Of course,\" declared Kiki.  \"I can transform you into a stick of wood, in a flash, or into a stone, and leave you here by the roadside.\"  \"The wicked Nome shivered a little when he heard that, but it made him long more than ever to possess the great secret.  After a while he said:  \"I'll tell you what I'll do.  If you will help me to conquer Oz and to transform the Oz people, who are my enemies, into sticks or stones, by telling me your secret, I'll agree to make YOU the Ruler of all Oz, and I will be your Prime Minister and see that your orders are obeyed.\"  \"I'll help do that,\" said Kiki, \"but I won't tell you my secret.\"  The Nome was so furious at this refusal that he jumped up and down with rage and spluttered and choked for a long time before he could control his passion.  But the boy was not at all frightened.  He laughed at the wicked old Nome, which made him more furious than ever.  \"Let's give up the idea,\" he proposed, when Ruggedo had quieted somewhat.  \"I don't know the Oz people you mention and so they are not my enemies.  If they've kicked you out of your kingdom, that's your affair--not mine.\"  \"Wouldn't you like to be king of that splendid fairyland?\" asked Ruggedo.  \"Yes, I would,\" replied Kiki Aru; \"but you want to be king yourself, and we would quarrel over it.\"  \"No,\" said the Nome, trying to deceive him.  \"I don't care to be King of Oz, come to think it over.  I don't even care to live in that country.  What I want first is revenge.  If we can conquer Oz, I'll get enough magic then to conquer my own Kingdom of the Nomes, and I'll go back and live in my underground caverns, which are more home-like than the top of the earth.  So here's my proposition: Help me conquer Oz and get revenge, and help me get the magic away from Glinda and the Wizard, and I'll let you be King of Oz forever afterward.\"  \"I'll think it over,\" answered Kiki, and that is all he would say that evening.  In the night when all in the Inn were asleep but himself, old Ruggedo the Nome rose softly from his couch and went into the room of Kiki Aru the Hyup, and searched everywhere for the magic tool that performed his transformations.  Of course, there was no such tool, and although Ruggedo searched in all the boy's pockets, he found nothing magical whatever.  So he went back to his bed and began to doubt that Kiki could perform transformations.  Next morning he said:  \"Which way do you travel to-day?\"  \"I think I shall visit the Rose Kingdom,\" answered the boy.  \"That is a long journey,\" declared the Nome.  \"I shall transform myself into a bird,\" said Kiki, \"and so fly to the Rose Kingdom in an hour.\"  \"Then transform me, also, into a bird, and I will go with you,\" suggested Ruggedo.  \"But, in that case, let us fly together to the Land of Oz, and see what it looks like.\"  Kiki thought this over.  Pleasant as were the countries he had visited, he heard everywhere that the Land of Oz was more beautiful and delightful.  The Land of Oz was his own country, too, and if there was any possibility of his becoming its King, he must know something about it.  While Kiki the Hyup thought, Ruggedo the Nome was also thinking.  This boy possessed a marvelous power, and although very simple in some ways, he was determined not to part with his secret.  However, if Ruggedo could get him to transport the wily old Nome to Oz, which he could reach in no other way, he might then induce the boy to follow his advice and enter into the plot for revenge, which he had already planned in his wicked heart.  \"There are wizards and magicians in Oz,\" remarked Kiki, after a time. \"They might discover us, in spite of our transformations.\"  \"Not if we are careful,\" Ruggedo assured him.  \"Ozma has a Magic Picture, in which she can see whatever she wishes to see; but Ozma will know nothing of our going to Oz, and so she will not command her Magic Picture to show where we are or what we are doing.  Glinda the Good has a Great Book called the Book of Records, in which is magically written everything that people do in the Land of Oz, just the instant they do it.\"  \"Then,\" said Kiki, \"there is no use our attempting to conquer the country, for Glinda would read in her book all that we do, and as her magic is greater than mine, she would soon put a stop to our plans.\"  \"I said 'people,' didn't I?\" retorted the Nome.  \"The book doesn't make a record of what birds do, or beasts.  It only tells the doings of people.  So, if we fly into the country as birds, Glinda won't know anything about it.\"  \"Two birds couldn't conquer the Land of Oz,\" asserted the boy, scornfully.  \"No; that's true,\" admitted Ruggedo, and then he rubbed his forehead and stroked his long pointed beard and thought some more.  \"Ah, now I have the idea!\" he declared.  \"I suppose you can transform us into beasts as well as birds?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"And can you make a bird a beast, and a beast a bird again, without taking a human form in between?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Kiki.  \"I can transform myself or others into anything that can talk.  There's a magic word that must be spoken in connection with the transformations, and as beasts and birds and dragons and fishes can talk in Oz, we may become any of these we desire to.  However, if I transformed myself into a tree, I would always remain a tree, because then I could not utter the magic word to change the transformation.\"  \"I see; I see,\" said Ruggedo, nodding his bushy, white head until the point of his hair waved back and forth like a pendulum.  \"That fits in with my idea, exactly.  Now, listen, and I'll explain to you my plan. We'll fly to Oz as birds and settle in one of the thick forests in the Gillikin Country.  There you will transform us into powerful beasts, and as Glinda doesn't keep any track of the doings of beasts we can act without being discovered.\"  \"But how can two beasts raise an army to conquer the powerful people of Oz?\" inquired Kiki.  \"That's easy.  But not an army of PEOPLE, mind you.  That would be quickly discovered.  And while we are in Oz you and I will never resume our human forms until we've conquered the country and destroyed Glinda, and Ozma, and the Wizard, and Dorothy, and all the rest, and so have nothing more to fear from them.\"  \"It is impossible to kill anyone in the Land of Oz,\" declared Kiki.  \"It isn't necessary to kill the Oz people,\" rejoined Ruggedo.  \"I'm afraid I don't understand you,\" objected the boy.  \"What will happen to the Oz people, and what sort of an army could we get together, except of people?\"  \"I'll tell you.  The forests of Oz are full of beasts.  Some of them, in the far-away places, are savage and cruel, and would gladly follow a leader as savage as themselves.  They have never troubled the Oz people much, because they had no leader to urge them on, but we will tell them to help us conquer Oz and as a reward we will transform all the beasts into men and women, and let them live in the houses and enjoy all the good things; and we will transform all the people of Oz into beasts of various sorts, and send them to live in the forests and the jungles. That is a splendid idea, you must admit, and it's so easy that we won't have any trouble at all to carry it through to success.\"  \"Will the beasts consent, do you think?\" asked the boy.  \"To be sure they will.  We can get every beast in Oz on our side--except a few who live in Ozma's palace, and they won't count.\"     4.  Conspirators   Kiki Aru didn't know much about Oz and didn't know much about the beasts who lived there, but the old Nome's plan seemed to him to be quite reasonable.  He had a faint suspicion that Ruggedo meant to get the best of him in some way, and he resolved to keep a close watch on his fellow-conspirator.  As long as he kept to himself the secret word of the transformations, Ruggedo would not dare to harm him, and he promised himself that as soon as they had conquered Oz, he would transform the old Nome into a marble statue and keep him in that form forever.  Ruggedo, on his part, decided that he could, by careful watching and listening, surprise the boy's secret, and when he had learned the magic word he would transform Kiki Aru into a bundle of faggots and burn him up and so be rid of him.  This is always the way with wicked people.  They cannot be trusted even by one another.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],["title","The Magic of Oz (#3)"],["body","thought he was fooling Kiki, and Kiki thought he was fooling Ruggedo; so both were pleased.  \"It's a long way across the Desert,\" remarked the boy, \"and the sands are hot and send up poisonous vapors.  Let us wait until evening and then fly across in the night when it will be cooler.\"  The former Nome King agreed to this, and the two spent the rest of that day in talking over their plans.  When evening came they paid the inn-keeper and walked out to a little grove of trees that stood near by.  \"Remain here for a few minutes and I'll soon be back,\" said Kiki, and walking swiftly away, he left the Nome standing in the grove.  Ruggedo wondered where he had gone, but stood quietly in his place until, all of a sudden, his form changed to that of a great eagle, and he uttered a piercing cry of astonishment and flapped his wings in a sort of panic.  At once his eagle cry was answered from beyond the grove, and another eagle, even larger and more powerful than the transformed Ruggedo, came sailing through the trees and alighted beside him.  \"Now we are ready for the start,\" said the voice of Kiki, coming from the eagle.  Ruggedo realized that this time he had been outwitted.  He had thought Kiki would utter the magic word in his presence, and so he would learn what it was, but the boy had been too shrewd for that.  As the two eagles mounted high into the air and began their flight across the great Desert that separates the Land of Oz from all the rest of the world, the Nome said:  \"When I was King of the Nomes I had a magic way of working transformations that I thought was good, but it could not compare with your secret word.  I had to have certain tools and make passes and say a lot of mystic words before I could transform anybody.\"  \"What became of your magic tools?\" inquired Kiki.  \"The Oz people took them all away from me--that horrid girl, Dorothy, and that terrible fairy, Ozma, the Ruler of Oz--at the time they took away my underground kingdom and kicked me upstairs into the cold, heartless world.\"  \"Why did you let them do that?\" asked the boy.  \"Well,\" said Ruggedo, \"I couldn't help it.  They rolled eggs at me--EGGS--dreadful eggs!--and if an egg even touches a Nome, he is ruined for life.\"  \"Is any kind of an egg dangerous to a Nome?\"  \"Any kind and every kind.  An egg is the only thing I'm afraid of.\"     5.  A Happy Corner of Oz   There is no other country so beautiful as the Land of Oz.  There are no other people so happy and contented and prosperous as the Oz people. They have all they desire; they love and admire their beautiful girl Ruler, Ozma of Oz, and they mix work and play so justly that both are delightful and satisfying and no one has any reason to complain.  Once in a while something happens in Oz to disturb the people's happiness for a brief time, for so rich and attractive a fairyland is sure to make a few selfish and greedy outsiders envious, and therefore certain evil-doers have treacherously plotted to conquer Oz and enslave its people and destroy its girl Ruler, and so gain the wealth of Oz for themselves.  But up to the time when the cruel and crafty Nome, Ruggedo, conspired with Kiki Aru, the Hyup, all such attempts had failed.  The Oz people suspected no danger.  Life in the world's nicest fairyland was one round of joyous, happy days.  In the center of the Emerald City of Oz, the capital city of Ozma's dominions, is a vast and beautiful garden, surrounded by a wall inlaid with shining emeralds, and in the center of this garden stands Ozma's Royal Palace, the most splendid building ever constructed.  From a hundred towers and domes floated the banners of Oz, which included the Ozmies, the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and the Quadlings. The banner of the Munchkins is blue, that of the Winkies yellow; the Gillikin banner is purple, and the Quadling's banner is red.  The colors of the Emerald City are of course green.  Ozma's own banner has a green center, and is divided into four quarters.  These quarters are colored blue, purple, yellow and red, indicating that she rules over all the countries of the Land of Oz.  This fairyland is so big, however, that all of it is not yet known to its girl Ruler, and it is said that in some far parts of the country, in forests and mountain fastnesses, in hidden valleys and thick jungles, are people and beasts that know as little about Ozma as she knows of them.  Still, these unknown subjects are not nearly so numerous as the known inhabitants of Oz, who occupy all the countries near to the Emerald City.  Indeed, I'm sure it will not be long until all parts of the fairyland of Oz are explored and their peoples made acquainted with their Ruler, for in Ozma's palace are several of her friends who are so curious that they are constantly discovering new and extraordinary places and inhabitants.  One of the most frequent discoverers of these hidden places in Oz is a little Kansas girl named Dorothy, who is Ozma's dearest friend and lives in luxurious rooms in the Royal Palace.  Dorothy is, indeed, a Princess of Oz, but she does not like to be called a princess, and because she is simple and sweet and does not pretend to be anything but an ordinary little girl, she is called just \"Dorothy\" by everybody and is the most popular person, next to Ozma, in all the Land of Oz.  One morning Dorothy crossed the hall of the palace and knocked on the door of another girl named Trot, also a guest and friend of Ozma.  When told to enter, Dorothy found that Trot had company, an old sailor-man with one wooden leg and one meat leg, who was sitting by the open window puffing smoke from a corn-cob pipe.  This sailor-man was named Cap'n Bill, and he had accompanied Trot to the Land of Oz and was her oldest and most faithful comrade and friend.  Dorothy liked Cap'n Bill, too, and after she had greeted him, she said to Trot:  \"You know, Ozma's birthday is next month, and I've been wondering what I can give here as a birthday present.  She's so good to us all that we certainly ought to remember her birthday.\"  \"That's true,\" agreed Trot.  \"I've been wondering, too, what I could give Ozma.  It's pretty hard to decide, 'cause she's got already all she wants, and as she's a fairy and knows a lot about magic, she could satisfy any wish.\"  \"I know,\" returned Dorothy, \"but that isn't the point.  It isn't that Ozma NEEDS anything, but that it will please her to know we've remembered her birthday.  But what shall we give her?\"  Trot shook her head in despair.  \"I've tried to think and I can't,\" she declared.  \"It's the same way with me,\" said Dorothy.  \"I know one thing that 'ud please her,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, turning his round face with its fringe of whiskers toward the two girls and staring at them with his big, light-blue eyes wide open.  \"What is it, Cap'n Bill?\"  \"It's an Enchanted Flower,\" said he.  \"It's a pretty plant that stands in a golden flower-pot an' grows all sorts o' flowers, one after another.  One minute a fine rose buds an' blooms, an' then a tulip, an' next a chrys--chrys--\"  \"--anthemum,\" said Dorothy, helping him.  \"That's it; and next a dahlia, an' then a daffydil, an' on all through the range o' posies.  Jus' as soon as one fades away, another comes, of a different sort, an' the perfume from 'em is mighty snifty, an' they keeps bloomin' night and day, year in an' year out.\"  \"That's wonderful!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"I think Ozma would like it.\"  \"But where is the Magic Flower, and how can we get it?\" asked Trot.  \"Dun'no, zac'ly,\" slowly replied Cap'n Bill.  \"The Glass Cat tol' me about it only yesterday, an' said it was in some lonely place up at the nor'east o' here.  The Glass Cat goes travelin' all around Oz, you know, an' the little critter sees a lot o' things no one else does.\"  \"That's true,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully.  \"Northeast of here must be in the Munchkin Country, and perhaps a good way off, so let's ask the Glass Cat to tell us how to get to the Magic Flower.\"  So the two girls, with Cap'n Bill stumping along on his wooden leg after them, went out into the garden, and after some time spent in searching, they found the Glass Cat curled up in the sunshine beside a bush, fast sleep.  The Glass Cat is one of the most curious creatures in all Oz.  It was made by a famous magician named Dr. Pipt before Ozma had forbidden her subjects to work magic.  Dr. Pipt had made the Glass Cat to catch mice, but the Cat refused to catch mice and was considered more curious than useful.  This astonished cat was made all of glass and was so clear and transparent that you could see through it as easily as through a window.  In the top of its head, however, was a mass of delicate pink balls which looked like jewels but were intended for brains.  It had a heart made of blood-red ruby.  The eyes were two large emeralds.  But, aside from these colors, all the rest of the animal was of clear glass, and it had a spun-glass tail that was really beautiful.  \"Here, wake up,\"  said Cap'n Bill.  \"We want to talk to you.\"  Slowly the Glass Cat got upon its feed, yawned and then looked at the three who stood before it.  \"How dare you disturb me?\" it asked in a peevish voice.  \"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.\"  \"Never mind that,\" returned the Sailor.  \"Do you remember tellin' me yesterday 'bout a Magic Flower in a Gold Pot?\"  \"Do you think I'm a fool?  Look at my brains--you can see 'em work.  Of course I remember!\" said the cat.  \"Well, where can we find it?\"  \"You can't.  It's none of your business, anyhow.  Go away and let me sleep,\" advised the Glass Cat.  \"Now, see here,\" said Dorothy; \"we want the Magic Flower to give to Ozma on her birthday.  You'd be glad to please Ozma, wouldn't you?\"  \"I'm not sure,\" replied the creature.  \"Why should I want to please anybody?\"  \"You've got a heart, 'cause I can see it inside of you,\" said Trot.  \"Yes; it's a pretty heart, and I'm fond of it,\" said the cat, twisting around to view its own body.  \"But it's made from "]]]
