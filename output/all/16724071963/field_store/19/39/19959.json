GRETEL (_somewhat timidly_).      The wind--  HﾄNSEL.                 The wind!  BOTH.      The heavenly wind!  GRETEL  (_picks up the piece of cake and tastes it_).      H'm!  HﾄNSEL (_looking longingly at Gretel_).      D'you like it?  GRETEL (_lets H舅sel bite it_).      Just taste and try it!  HﾄNSEL  (_lays his hand on his breast in rapture_).      Hi!  GRETEL (_ditto_).      Hi!  BOTH.          Hi, hi! O cake most delicious,         some more I must take!         It's really like Heaven         to eat such plum-cake!  HﾄNSEL.      O how good, how sweet, how tasty!  GRETEL.      How tasty, how sweet!     It's p'r'aps the house of a sweety-maker!  HﾄNSEL.      Hi, sweety-maker! Have a care!     A little mouse your sweeties would share!  (_He breaks a big piece of cake off the wall._)  A VOICE FROM THE HOUSE.      Nibble, nibble, mousekin,     who's nibbling at my housekin?  HﾄNSEL AND GRETEL.      The wind, the wind,     the heavenly wind!  (_The upper part of the house-door opens gently, and the Witch's head is seen at it. The children at first do not see her, and go on feasting merrily._)  GRETEL.      Wait, you gobbling mousekin,     here comes the cat from the housekin!  HﾄNSEL (_taking another bite_).      Eat what you please,     and leave me in peace!  GRETEL  (_snatches the piece from his hand_).      Don't be unkind,     Sir wind, Sir wind!  HﾄNSEL (_takes it back from her_).      Heavenly wind,     I take what I find!  BOTH (_laughing_).      Ha, ha, ha!  THE WITCH  (_who had meanwhile opened the whole door, and had been warily stealing up to the children, throws a rope round the neck of H舅sel, who, without any misgivings, turns his back to her_).      Hi, hi! hi, hi!  HﾄNSEL (_horror-struck_).      Let go! Who are you?     Let me go!  THE WITCH  (_drawing the children towards her_).      Angels both!     (And goosey-ganders!)     (_Caresses the children._)     You've come to visit me, that is sweet!     You charming children, so nice to eat!  HﾄNSEL  (_makes despairing efforts to free himself_).      Who are you, ugly one?     Let me go!  THE WITCH.      Now, darling, don't you give yourself airs!     Dear heart, what makes you say such things?     I am Rosina Dainty-mouth,     and dearly love my fellow-men.     I'm artless as a new born child!     That's why the children to me are so dear,     so dear, so dear, ah, so che-arming to eat!     (_Caresses H舅sel._)  HﾄNSEL (_turning roughly away_).      Go, get you gone from my sight!     I hate, I loathe you quite!  THE WITCH.      Hi hi! hi hi!     These dainty morsels I'm really gloating on,     and you, my little maiden, I'm doting on!     Come, little mousey,     come into my housey!     Come with me, my precious,     I'll give you sweetmeats delicious!     Of chocolate, tarts, and marzipan     you shall both eat all you can,     and wedding-cake and strawberry ices,     blancmange, and everything else that nice is,     and raisins and almonds,     and peaches and citrons are waiting--     you'll both find it quite captivating,     yes, quite captivating!  HﾄNSEL.      I won't come with you, hideous fright!     You are quite too friendly!  THE WITCH.      See, see, see how sly!     Dear children, you really may trust me in this,     and living with me will be perfect bliss!     Come, little mousey,     come into my housey!     Come with me, my precious,     I'll give you sweetmeats delicious!  GRETEL.      But say, what will you with my brother do?  THE WITCH.      Well, well!     I'll feed and fatten him up well,     with every sort of dainty delicious,     to make him tender and tasty.     And if he's brave and patient too,     and docile and obedient like a lamb,     then, H舅sel, I'll whisper it you,     I have a great treat in store for you!  HﾄNSEL.      Then speak out loud and whisper not.     What is the great treat in store for me?  THE WITCH.      Yes, my dear children, hearing and sight     in this great pleasure will disappear quite!  HﾄNSEL.      Eh? both my hearing and seeing are good!     You'd better take care you do me no harm!  (_Resolutely._)      Gretel, trust not her flattering words,     come, sister, come, let's run away!  (_He has in the meantime got out of the rope, and runs with Gretel to the foreground. Here they are stopped by the Witch, who imperiously raises against them both a stick which hangs at her girdle, with repeated gestures of spellbinding._)  THE WITCH.      Hold!  (_The stage becomes gradually darker._)      Hocus pocus, witches' charm!     Move not, as you fear my arm!     Back or forward do not try,     fixed you are by the evil eye!     Head on shoulders fixed awry!     Hocus, pocus, now comes jocus,     children, watch the magic head,     eyes are staring, dull as lead!     Now, you atom, off to bed!  (_Fresh gestures; then she leads H舅sel, who is gazing fixedly at the illuminated head, into the stable, and shuts the lattice door upon him._)      Hocus pocus, bonus jocus,     malus locus, hocus pocus,     bonus jocus, malus locus!  (_The stage gradually becomes lighter, whilst the light of the magic head diminishes. The Witch, contentedly to Gretel, who still stands there motionless._)      Now Gretel, be obedient and wise,     while H舅sel's growing fat and nice.     We'll feed him up, you'll see my reason,     and with sweet almonds and raisins season.     I'll go indoors, the things to prepare,     and you remain here where you are!  (_She grins as she holds up her finger warningly, and goes into the house._)  GRETEL (_stiff and motionless_).      O, what a horrid witch she is!  HﾄNSEL (_whispering hastily_).      Gretel, sh! don't speak so loud!     Be very sharp, watch well and see     whatever she may do to me!     Pretend to do all she commands--     O, there she's coming back, sh! hush!  (_The Witch comes out, satisfies herself that Gretel is still standing motionless, and then spreads before H舅sel almonds and raisins from a basket._)  THE WITCH.      Now, little man,     come prithee enjoy yourself!  (_Sticking a raisin into H舅sel's mouth._)      Eat, minion, eat or die!     Here are cakes, O so nice!     (_Turns to Gretel and disenchants her with a juniper-branch._)     Hocus pocus, elder-bush!     Rigid body loosen, hush!     (_Gretel moves again._)     Now up and move again, bright and blithesome,     limbs are become again supple and lithesome.     Go, my poppet, go my pet,     you the table now shall set,     little knife, little fork, little dish, little plate,     little serviette for my little mate!     Now get everything ready and nice,     or else I shall lock you up too in a trice!  (_She threatens and titters. Gretel hurries off. The Witch, to H舅sel, who pretends to be asleep._)      The fool is slumb'ring, it does seem queer     how youth can sleep and have no fear!     Well, sleep away, you simple sheep,     soon you will sleep your last long sleep!     But first with Gretel I'll begin--     off you, dear maiden, I will dine;     you are so tender, plump, and good,     just the thing for witches' food!  (_She opens the oven door and sniffs in it, her face lighted up by the deep red glare of the fire._)      The dough has risen, so we'll go on preparing.     Hark, how the sticks in the fire are crackling!  (_She pushes a couple more faggots under, the fire flames up and then dies down again. The Witch rubbing her hands with glee._)      Yes, Gretel mine,     how well off you I'll dine!     See, see, O how sly!     When in the oven she's peeping,     quickly behind her I'm creeping!     One little push, bang     goes the door, clang!     Then soon will Gretel be     just done to a T!     and when from the oven I take her     she'll look like a cake from the baker,     by magic fire red     changed into gingerbread!     See, see how sly!     Hi hi! hi hi!  (_In her wild delight she seizes a broomstick and begins to ride upon it._)            So hop, hop, hop,           gallop, lop, lop!           My broomstick nag,           come do not lag!  (_She rides excitedly round on the broomstick._)            At dawn of day           I ride away,           am here and there           and everywhere!  (_She rides again; Gretel meanwhile is watching at the window._)      At midnight hour, when none can know,     to join the witches' dance I go!           And three and four           are witches' lore,           and five and six           are witches' tricks,           and nine is one,           and ten is none,           and seven is nil,           or what she will!     And thus they ride till dawn of day!  (_Hopping madly along, she rides to the back of the stage and vanishes for a time behind the cottage. Here the Witch becomes visible again; she comes to the foreground, where she suddenly pulls up and dismounts._)      Prr, broomstick, hi!  (_She hobbles back to the stable and tickles H舅sel with a birch twig till he awakes._)      Up, awake, my mankin young;     come show to me your tongue!  (_H舅sel puts his tongue out. The Witch smacks with her tongue._)      Dainty morsel! dainty morsel!     Little toothsome mankin come,     now let me see your thumb!  (_H舅sel pokes out a small bone._)      Gemini! Oho!     O how scraggy, how lean!     Urchin, you're a scraggy one,     as bad as a skeleton!  (_Calls._)      Maiden, Gretel!  (_Gretel appears at the door._)      Bring some raisins and almonds sweet,     H舅sel wants some more to eat.  (_Gretel runs into the house, and returns immediately with a basket full of almonds and raisins._)  GRETEL.      Here are the almonds.

MY LORD,  The completion of this Work affords me the opportunity I have long desired of thanking your Lordship thus publicly, for the kindness with which you acceded to my request to be permitted to dedicate it to you.  The encouragement your Lordship was pleased to give me has served to stimulate me in the prosecution of a task, which would, I fear, have been too great for me to have accomplished in my present condition, under any ordinary views of ambition. Indeed, labouring as I have been for many months past, under an almost total deprivation of sight, (the effect of exposure and anxiety of mind in the prosecution of geographical researches,) I owe it to the casual assistance of some of my friends, that I am at length enabled to lay these results before your Lordship and the public.  While I feel a painful conviction that many errors must necessarily pervade a work produced under such unfavourable circumstances, it affords me no small consolation to reflect that Your Lordship has been aware of my situation, and will be disposed to grant me every reasonable indulgence.  I have the honor to be, With the highest respect, My Lord, Your Lordship's Very obedient and humble servant,  CHARLES STURT London, June, 1833.

PURPOSE OF THIS PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.   When I first determined on committing to the press a detailed account of the two expeditions, which I conducted into the interior of the Australian continent, pursuant to the orders of Lieutenant General Darling, the late Governor of the Colony of New South Wales, it was simply with a view of laying their results before the geographical world, and of correcting the opinions that prevailed with regard to the unexplored country to the westward of the Blue Mountains. I did not feel myself equal either to the task or the responsibility of venturing any remarks on the Colony of New South Wales itself. I had had little time for inquiry, amidst the various duties that fell to my lot in the ordinary routine of the service to which I belonged, when unemployed by the Colonial Government in the prosecution of inland discoveries. My observations had been in a great measure confined to those points which curiosity, or a desire of personal information, had prompted me to investigate. I did not, therefore, venture to flatter myself that I had collected materials of sufficient importance on general topics to enable me to write for the information of others. Since my return to England, however, I have been strenuously urged to give a short description of the colony before entering upon my personal narrative; and I have conversed with so many individuals whose ideas of Australia are totally at variance with its actual state, that I am encouraged to indulge the hope that my observations, desultory as they are, may be of some interest to the public. I am strengthened in this hope by the consideration that some kind friends have enabled me to add much valuable matter to that which I had myself collected. It is not my intention, however, to enter at any length on the commercial or agricultural interests "]]]
