He wondered why they wanted a freshman. Lefty introduced Chuck and then said: \"Are you strong, freshman?\"  For an instant he was stunned. Had they heard, guessed? Then he realized it was impossible. They wanted him to work. They were going to haze him. \"Sure,\" he said.  \"Then get this trunk and I'll show you where to take it.\"  Hugo was handed a baggage check. He found the official and located the trunk. Tentatively he tested its weight, as if he were a normally husky youth about to undertake its transportation. He felt pleased that his strength was going to be tried so accidentally and in such short order. Lefty and Chuck heaved the trunk on his back. \"Can you carry it?\" they asked.  \"Sure.\"  \"Don't be too sure. It's a long way.\"  Peering from beneath the trunk under which he bent with a fair assumption of human weakness, Hugo had his first close glimpse of Webster. They passed under a huge arch and down a street lined with elms. Students were everywhere, carrying books and furniture, moving in wheelbarrows and moving by means of the backs of other freshmen. The two who led him were talking and he listened as he plodded.  \"Saw Marcia just before I left the lake--took her out one night--and got all over the place with her--and then came down--she's coming to the first prom with me--and Marj to the second--got to get some beer in--we'll buzz out and see if old Snorenson has made any wine this summer. Hello, Eddie--glad to see you back--I've elected the dean's physics, though, God knows, I'll never get a first in them and I need it for a key. That damn Frosh we picked up sure must have been a porter--hey, freshmen! Want a rest?\"  \"No, thanks.\"  \"Went down to the field this afternoon--looks all right to me. The team, that is. Billings is going to quarter it now--and me after that--hope to Christ I make it--they're going to have Scapper and Dwan back at Yale and we've got a lot of work to do. Frosh! You don't need to drag that all the way in one yank. Put it down, will you?\"  \"I'm not tired. I don't need a rest.\"  \"Well, you know best--but you ought to be tired. I would. Where do you come from?\"  \"Colorado.\"  \"Huh! People go to Colorado. Never heard of any one coming from there before. Whereabouts?\"  \"Indian Creek.\"  \"Oh.\" There was a pause. \"You aren't an Indian, are you?\" It was asked bluntly.  \"Scotch Presbyterian for twenty generations.\"  \"Well, when you get through here, you'll be full of Scotch and emptied of the Presbyterianism. Put the trunk down.\"  Their talk of women, of classes, of football, excited Hugo. He was not quite as amazed to find that Lefty Foresman was one of the candidates for the football team as he might have been later when he knew how many students attended the university and how few, relatively, were athletes. He decided at once that he liked Lefty. The sophistication of his talk was unfamiliar to Hugo; much of it he could not understand and only guessed. He wanted Lefty to notice him. When he was told to put the trunk down, he did not obey. Instead, with precision and ease, he swung it up on his shoulder, held it with one hand and said in an unflustered tone: \"I'm not tired, honestly. Where do we go from here?\"  \"Great howling Jesus!\" Lefty said, \"what have we here? Hey! Put that trunk down.\" There was excitement in his voice. \"Say, guy, do that again.\"  Hugo did it. Lefty squeezed his biceps and grew pale. Those muscles in action lost their feel of flesh and became like stone. Lefty said: \"Say, boy, can you play football?\"  \"Sure,\" Hugo said.  \"Well, you leave that trunk with Chuck, here, and come with me.\"  Hugo did as he had been ordered and they walked side by side to the gymnasium. Hugo had once seen a small gymnasium, ill equipped and badly lighted, and it had appealed mightily to him. Now he stood in a prodigious vaulted room with a shimmering floor, a circular balcony, a varied array of apparatus. His hands clenched. Lefty quit him for a moment and came back with a man who wore knickers. \"Mr. Woodman, this is--what the hell's your name?\"  \"Danner. Hugo Danner.\"  \"Mr. Woodman is football coach.\"  Hugo took the man's hand. Lefty excused himself. Mr. Woodman said: \"Young Foresman said you played football.\"  \"Just on a high-school team in Colorado.\"  \"Said you were husky. Go in my office and ask Fitzsimmons to give you a gym suit. Come out when you're ready.\"  Hugo undressed and put on the suit. Fitzsimmons, the trainer, looked at him with warm admiration. \"You're sure built, son.\"  \"Yeah. That's luck, isn't it?\"  Then Hugo was taken to another office. Woodman asked him a number of questions about his weight, his health, his past medical history. He listened to Hugo's heart and then led him to a scale. Hugo had lied about his weight.  \"I thought you said one hundred and sixty, Mr. Danner?\"  The scales showed two hundred and eleven, but it was impossible for a man of his size and build to weigh that much. Hugo had lied deliberately, hoping that he could avoid the embarrassment of being weighed. \"I did, Mr. Woodman. You see--my weight is a sort of freak. I don't show it--no one would believe it--and yet there it is.\" He did not go into the details of his construction from a plasm new to biology.  \"Huh!\" Mr. Woodman said. Together they walked out on the floor of the gymnasium. Woodman called to one of the figures on the track who was making slow, plodding circuits. \"Hey, Nellie! Take this bird up and pace him for a lap. Make it fast.\"  A little smile came at the corners of Hugo's mouth. Several of the men in the gymnasium stopped work to watch the trial of what was evidently a new candidate. \"Ready?\" Woodman said, and the runners crouched side by side. \"Set? Go!\"  Nelson, one of the best sprinters Webster had had for years, dashed forward. He had covered thirty feet when he heard a voice almost in his ear. \"Faster, old man.\"  Nelson increased. \"Faster, boy, I'm passing you.\" The words were spoken quietly, calmly. A rage filled Nelson. He let every ounce of his strength into his limbs and skimmed the canvas. Half a lap. Hugo ran at his side and Nelson could not lead him. The remaining half was not a race. Hugo finished thirty feet in the lead.  Woodman, standing on the floor, wiped his forehead and bawled: \"That the best you can do, Nellie?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What in hell have you been doing to yourself?\"  Nelson drew a sobbing breath. \"I--haven't--done--a thing. Time--that man. He's--faster than the intercollegiate mark.\"  Woodman, still dubious, made Hugo run against time. And Hugo, eager to make an impression and unguided by a human runner, broke the world's record for the distance around the track by a second and three-fifths. The watch in Woodman's hands trembled.  \"Hey!\" he said, uncertain of his voice, \"come down here, will you?\"  Hugo descended the spiral iron staircase. He was breathing with ease. Woodman stared at him. \"Lessee you jump.\"  Hugo was familiar with the distances for jumping made in track meets. He was careful not to overdo his effort. His running jump was twenty-eight feet, and his standing jump was eleven feet and some inches. Woodman's face ran water. His eyes gleamed. \"Danner,\" he said, \"where did you get that way?\"  \"What way?\"  \"I mean--what have you done all your life?\"  \"Nothing. Gone to school.\"  \"Two hundred and eleven pounds,\" Woodman muttered, \"run like an Olympic champ--jump like a kangaroo--how's your kicking?\"  \"All right, I guess.\"  \"Passing?\"  \"All right, I guess.\"  \"Come on outside. Hey, Fitz! Bring a ball.\"  An hour later Fitzsimmons found Woodman sitting in his office. Beside him was a bottle of whisky which he kept to revive wounded gladiators. \"Fitz,\" said Woodman, looking at the trainer with dazed eyes, \"did you see what I saw?\"  \"Yes, I did, Woodie.\"  \"Tell me about it.\"  Fitzsimmons scratched his greying head. \"Well, Woodie, I seen a young man--\"  \"Saw, Fitz.\"  \"I saw a young man come into the gym an' undress. He looked like an oiled steam engine. I saw him go and knock hell out of three track records without even losing his breath. Then I seen him go out on the field an' kick a football from one end to the other an' pass it back. That's what _I_ seen.\"  Woodman nodded his head. \"So did I. But I don't believe it, do you?\"  \"I do. That's the man you--an' all the other coaches--have been wantin' to see. The perfect athlete. Better in everything than the best man at any one thing. Just a freak, Woodie--but, God Almighty, how New Haven an' Colgate are goin' to feel it these next years!\"  \"Mebbe he's dumb, Fitz.\"  \"Mebbe. Mebbe not.\"  \"Find out.\"  Fitz wasted no time. He telephoned to the registrar's office. \"Mr. H. Danner,\" said the voice of a secretary, \"passed his examinations with the highest honours and was admitted among the first ten.\"  \"He passed his entrance exams among the first ten,\" Fitzsimmons repeated.  \"God!\" said Woodman, \"it's the millennium!\" And he took a drink.         *       *       *       *       *  Late in the afternoon of that day Hugo found his room in Thompson Dormitory. He unpacked his carpet-bag and his straw suitcase. He checked in his mind the things that he had done. It seemed a great deal for one day--a complete alteration of his life. He had seen the dean and arranged his classes: trigonometry, English, French, Latin, biology, physics, economics, hygiene. With a pencil and a ruler he made a schedule, which he pinned on the second-hand desk he had bought.  Then he checked his furniture: a desk, two chairs, a bed, bed-clothes, a rug, sheets and blankets, towels. He hung his clothes in the closet. For a while he looked at them attentively. They were not like the clothes of the other students. He could not quite perceive the difference, but he felt it, and it made him uncomfortable. The room to which he had been assigned was pleasant. It looked over the rolling campus on two sides, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42919"],["title","Angel Unawares: A Story of Christmas Eve (#0)"],["body","by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.        Angel Unawares   A Story of Christmas Eve    BY   C. N. and A. M. WILLIAMSON    HARPER & BROTHERS PUBLISHERS   NEW YORK AND LONDON     Angel Unawares    Copyright, 1916, by Harper & Brothers  Printed in the United States of America  Published October, 1916    ANGEL UNAWARES    IF Angel Odell hadn't had a French nursery governess, and if that French governess hadn't suddenly recognized her lost lover in a wounded French sergeant on the sea-front, the Valois story would have been a Christmas tragedy instead of--what it turned out to be. This was strange, because neither the little American girl nor her governess nor her governess's lover had ever heard of the Valois family, nor had the Valois family heard of them. But most things that happen are strange, if seen from every point of view.  At first, when Mademoiselle Rose gave a little scream and rushed away from her charge to a good-looking soldier with his arm in a sling, Angel stood still, extremely interested. Her mother did not know about the lost lover. One need not tell all one's heart secrets to one's employer on being engaged at a Paris agency! But Mademoiselle cried in the night sometimes and gazed at a photograph, so Angel (whose bed was in the same room) had asked questions safer to answer than leave unanswered. When she saw the meeting she quickly put two and two together in her intelligent, seven-year-old brain.  \"That's Claude,\" said the child to herself. \"So he's alive, after all. My goodness _me!_ what a nice Christmas present for Mademoiselle! I'm glad it's after lunch instead of before, though, for I _was_ hungry, and I expect she'll want to talk to him a long time. I suppose she'll introduce him to me and we'll all three walk up and down.\"  Instead of walking, however, Mademoiselle and her Christmas present sat down on one of the seats placed at regular intervals along the Mentone sea front. Apparently Mademoiselle forgot Angel's existence, and \"Claude\" had not observed it. The child stood neglected until she was tired and very bored. Then, too polite to interrupt (a succession of nursery governesses of several nations had instructed her never to interrupt), she decided to go home.  \"Home\" was a hotel; and Mrs. Odell, Angel, and Mademoiselle had arrived only the day before from Paris, Mademoiselle had been in Mentone before (that was one reason for engaging her), but Angel and her mother never had. Angel's father was one of several brilliant young men in the American Embassy, where he was well content for himself, but found the idea of bombs on heads he loved bad for his nerves; accordingly, wife and child had been sent to safety in the south of France, somewhat against the former's will. At the moment, Elinor Odell was getting off letters, meaning to go out later and buy Christmas toys. So it happened that, just as Angel was wondering which turn to take, Angel's mother was writing: \"Mademoiselle is young and pretty, but as trustworthy as if she were a _hundred_. She never loses sight of the Angel-Imp for an instant.\"  The Angel-Imp in question wished that streets going inland from the Promenade du Midi didn't look so much alike. They all seemed to have rivers or gardens running up the middle, and pointed blue mountains at the back, except the ones farther along, where the shops were. Angel remembered a bridge. She thought the right turn was near. Yes, that must be the street! You walked along that for a while, and then you had to turn again. You passed villas with gardens.  By and by Angel forgot to look for landmarks; there were so many things which amused her: children riding on donkeys led by brown old women in funny hats like toadstools; a flock of very white sheep with long, silky hair, being driven by a fur-coated boy into an olive wood; bands of soldiers black as jet, wearing queer red caps on their woolly heads. It was all so interesting and exciting that when Angel remembered herself she was not quite sure she knew where she was.  This would have been rather frightening if the realization hadn't come just outside the half-open gates of a garden lovely as fairy-land. It had been winter in Paris. Here it was summer; yet to-morrow was going to be Christmas. Angel could not understand. The thing was like a dream, and held her fascinated. She was an imaginative child, and it thrilled her to say to herself, \"Maybe this garden is fairyland!\" Although, of course, the common-sense side of her answered, \"Pooh! You know very well, you silly, there's no such place.\"  Anyhow, the garden _looked_ like fairyland. It was exactly what fairyland ought to be; and even mother (who was a grown-up, though father often called her \"child\") said that no really nice person would swear there weren't any fairies in the world.  Hundreds and maybe thousands of orange and lemon trees made a sparkling green roof for a carpet of purply-blue violets, white carnations, and roses of every shade from palest coral pink to deepest crimson. The flowers grew in the midst of young grass which the sun, shining through tree-branches, lit with the vivid green of emeralds. It shone also on the countless globes of the oranges and lemons, making them glow like lighted lamps of pale topaz and transparent red-gold among the dark-green leaves.  \"Fairy Christmas trees!\" thought Angel Odell. And it seemed to her that the invisible hand of an equally invisible fairy clutched her dress and began to pull her through the open gateway. After all, why should the gates be open if people were not expected to walk into the garden?  \"I don't care. I _will_ go in, whether it's fairyland or not,\" Angel decided.  Nothing else seemed important except the garden and what might happen to her there when she had once got past the gates. Not Mademoiselle Rose, not her Claude, not going home to the hotel, and not even seeing mother.  Angel let the unseen hand guide her through the gates, and on the other side the mysterious beauty of the garden was more thrilling than ever, because it was all around her and under her feet and over her head. The road looked as if no wagons ever went over it, though it was wide enough for them to pass. It was golden-brown in patches, but was overgrown with a film of green, almost like lace. The orange-trees were planted so that they made long, straight aisles shut in at the far end with a misty curtain of blue. Down each aisle a narrow, gold-brown path ran between the flowers; and, fascinated, the child from another land began slowly to follow one of the ways. A vague fancy stole through her mind that the silence and heavy perfume of lemon blossoms were, somehow, parts of each other. It was as if she were about to find out a wonderful secret; and, looking up through the green net to a sky of blue, shot with rose, she wandered on with a sense of waiting.  Not only did little paths run the length of those long, straight aisles, but crossed from one aisle into another, until Angel lost count, as from violets she visited roses, and from roses passed to carnations and stocks. Beyond the arbor of orange- and lemon-trees showered a golden rain of mimosas, and close by clustered a grove of palms, with tall-trunked, date-laden giants rearing their crests in the middle of the group, and in an outer ring, low-plumed dwarfs whose feathered branches drooped to earth.  Angel Odell associated palms with large pots in halls and conservatories. She had not known until to-day that they could grow out of doors. Staring at the grove in wonder, she caught sight of something red which showed between the trailing fronds of a palm like a green-domed tent. And mixed in with the something red was something white that moved. Almost before she knew what she was doing, Angel had stooped down and crept beneath the drapery of rustling plumes.  The \"red thing\" was an old knitted shawl, spread over a wooden seat of the right height for a child; and the \"white thing\" was a half-Persian kitten. It was sitting on the shawl, too earnestly ironing its silver ruff with a pink tongue to feel the slightest concern in the intrusion of a stranger.  \"Oh, you lovely catkin!\" exclaimed Angel. Cautiously she subsided on to the end of the wooden seat, and, slipping off her gray mittens, began to smooth the fluffy back. On her thumb glittered a large diamond in a ring of her mother's she had picked up on the dressing-table and forgotten to take off. Seeing that the object of her attentions did not openly object to them, and, indeed, appeared hypnotized by the flashing stone, she transferred the white ball of fur from the red shawl to her gray-corduroy lap. It was velvet corduroy, and even more delightful to sit on than knitted wool. The kitten submitted in a dignified, aloof manner to the child's caresses, and Angel sat rigidly still, hardly daring to breathe lest the haughty creature should take offense.  It was just then that a woman suddenly appeared from, it seemed, nowhere in particular. Angel's heart gave a jump. What if the woman--just a mere woman, not a fairy at all--owned the garden, and should scold the little stranger girl for coming in, sitting down, and playing with her kitten?  \"Maybe if I don't move or make any noise she'll go away and won't see me,\" the child thought.  To her no grown-up person could be really young, but _for_ a grown-up this woman looked youngish, about as young as mother. Mother had been twenty-eight on her last birthday, and looked almost like a little girl before she was dressed in the morning, with clouds of dark hair falling around her small, white face and shading her big, blue eyes.  This woman had dark hair, too, but Angel could not see what color her eyes were. She was looking down. Her eyelashes were long and black, like mother's, yet she was not like mother in any other way. Mother's face was rather round, and nearly always smiling and happy. This woman's face, though pretty--yes, Angel thought it pretty, and, like "]]]
