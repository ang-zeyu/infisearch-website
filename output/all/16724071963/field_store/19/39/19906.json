That was strange, in this beautiful garden full of flowers and sunshine; like a wrong note in music, if Angel mischievously struck a key while mother was playing something gay and sweet. Besides, the woman had on a dress that wasn't pretty at all, or like the dresses mother wore. It was brown, and plain, without any trimming, almost like a servant's dress. Angel wished she would go away, but she didn't; she stooped down and began to do two very queer things. Both were queer for a woman to do, and one was dreadful.  The first thing--the thing that was only queer--was to cover up a bed of very delicate flowers, whose name Angel had never heard, with gray stuff such as kitchen towels are made of, only much thicker and rougher. The woman had been carrying a large bundle of this in her arms, and in covering the bed she supported the gray stuff on sticks higher than the flowers.  The other queer thing she did, which was dreadful as well as queer, was to cry. It seemed awful to Angel that a grown-up woman should cry--cry in a beautiful garden, where she thought she was alone. And on Christmas Eve! Angel felt quite sick. Her throat filled as if she, too, were going to cry. It was all she could do not to give the kitten a nervous squeeze. She was seized with a wild wish to rush out and try to comfort the woman; but instinct even more than childish shyness held her back. Angel knew that, if she had stolen away to cry where she hoped not to be seen, she would hate to have a strange person jump out and surprise her. Probably she would hate it even more if she were a grown-up.  The child hidden under the palm-tree and the woman outside were so near to each other that the child could hear the woman give choking sobs which it seemed as if she tried to swallow. Perhaps she didn't try hard enough at first, for the sobs, instead of stopping, came faster and harder, and Angel's large, horrified eyes saw tears run down the woman's face and splash on to the flowers. Suddenly, however, the gasping ceased. The woman let fall an end of the bagging not yet draped over the sticks, and sprang to her feet with the quick grace of a frightened fawn. Not that Angel definitely thought of any such simile, but away in the back of her mind dimly materialized the picture of a deer she had once seen rise up among the tall grasses in a public park.  The young woman fumbled in the pocket of her shabby brown dress and found a handkerchief. She hurriedly dabbed her eyes, and rubbed her cheeks hard, as if to make them so red that the redness of her eyelids might not be noticed.  \"She must have heard some noise,\" thought Angel; and as the thought formed she, too, heard what the woman had heard--the pat-pat of footsteps coming lightly and quickly across grass. Then from under the green-and-gold mimosas a man appeared--a tall, youngish man, very thin and pale, carrying a thing which seemed a mysterious object for a man to carry in his arms; but then, everything about this fairy garden was mysterious and puzzling.  Heavily leaning against the man's shoulder and hanging down over his back was a pine-tree, small for a pine-tree, but large for a person to carry. He came on with his head bent, and at first did not see the woman, so--apparently--he was not in search of her. But he limped as he walked, and the woman cried out sharply:  \"Oh, Paul, you've hurt yourself! You've had a fall!\"  He looked up, surprised. \"Why, dear one, I didn't know you were here,\" he said. \"I did slip on a stone coming down the mountain. But it's nothing. I've wrenched my ankle a little, that's all.\"  \"And you had that long, hard walk afterward!\" the woman exclaimed. \"My poor Paul! You out of bed only three days ago. It's too cruel. Everything goes against us.\"  \"Everything?\" He caught her up and a look of alarm or anxiety chased away the smile he had put on to reassure her. \"Has bad news come, then? But yes--you needn't answer. I know it has. I wish I hadn't said you might open the avocat's letter! You've been crying, Suze.\"  The woman spoke English as if it were her own language, but the man had an accent which showed that he was not born to it. Even Angel--listening half against her will--noticed that, almost unconsciously. But she had been forced to think a great deal about \"accent\" in the last few months since she had come to live in Paris and talk with a French governess. She had picked up French quickly, as children do, but was always having the word \"accent, accent!\" drummed into her head.  \"I couldn't help crying a little,\" said Suze. \"I didn't mean to let you know. I thought you'd be longer away.\"  \"You mustn't try to hide your feelings from me, dear,\" the man said. \"Troubles will be lighter if you let me bear them with you.\"  \"But you--you're always trying to cheer me up, no matter what's happened,\" the woman reminded him, almost reproachfully. Angel realized that they must be husband and wife. They were about the right age for each other, she thought; and even a child could see by the look in their eyes that they loved one another dearly. \"You pretend now that you're not hurt, but you are; you're suffering-- your face shows it. Ah! the dear face, so white, so patient! I hoped I should have good news for you when you came back. I hoped that in spite of everything we might have a little peace, a little happiness, just enough to last us over Christmas, if no more. But what's the use of our hoping? Always comes another blow!\" Her sobs broke out again. Tears poured over her cheeks.  The man stooped and laid the little pine-tree on the grass, letting it down carefully, not to break the branches. Then he took his wife in his arms and pressed her head against his shoulder. They looked two pathetic figures in their plain, rather shabby clothes, clinging together in the garden where everything save themselves was singing with joy of life and beauty.  \"You mustn't give way like this, Suze,\" said the man, gently. \"Think of the children.\"  \"I know,\" she sobbed, \"I hate myself for breaking down. I ought to think of _you_ as well as the children, though you'd never tell me to do that. You never think of yourself, except of what you can do for me and them. This Christmas tree you've brought! Even if you'd been well, it would have been a big adventure, toiling up into the mountains, tired after a day's work in the garden; looking for the right tree, sure to grow in the worst place to get at; cutting it down with an ax that's no more than a toy, and then bringing the thing home on your back! Why, it would be hard labor for a strong man---\"  \"Love gives strength,\" he soothed her, stroking her ruffled dark hair; and Angel thought that she had never seen a man's hand so thin. \"I've done myself no harm, truly, dear one. I may not be very strong yet, but I'm getting on. Last week you said you were thankful, whatever happened, to have me out of bed---\"  \"You oughtn't to have been out!\" Suze broke in, rebelliously. \"If we weren't so poor---\"  \"Never mind. It did me no real harm. I've had no relapse. And we've got each other and the children. There are rich people who'd change with us. Let's forget the bad news and the other troubles till after Christmas---\"  \"How _can_ we forget being hungry?\"  \"By eating an orange!\" The man tried to laugh. \"We've got plenty of those.\"  \"Just now we have. But if we're turned out?\"  \"We must do as Adam and Eve did when they were turned out of Eden. They found work, I suppose. So shall we. Though God knows it almost kills me to think of what I've brought on you and the babies.\"  \"Don't say 'you'! You've never brought anything but happiness to us or anybody.\"  \"I'm afraid--I've thought, sometimes--I had no right to marry you.\"  \"Why, life wouldn't have been life for me without you, Paul!\"  \"Or for me without you, Suze.\"  \"And all we've gone through has only drawn us closer together. But this last blow is different. It's too cruel! . . . That Judas of a man, Siegel, making us believe he was our good friend and he doing you a great kindness selling you this garden and the business so cheap! Think, Paul, how he described it, only last August, just after I found you in Antwerp when you were getting well after your wound. Would one _believe_ a man could make up his mind to ruin another who'd nearly given his life for his country? Plan and plan to rob him of his savings, pretending all the time to open the gates of Paradise---\"  \"Well, in one way this _is_ Paradise,\" said Paul, lifting his eyes to the sky which showered sunset roses through silver branches of olives, gold branches of mimosas.  \"Paradise with the serpent of deceit in it!\" cried Suze. \"The Nice lawyer says in his letter--_I'm_ not sorry you let me open it--that Siegel drew up the deeds so cleverly it's almost impossible to convict him of swindling. Monsieur Vignal thinks no business man would lend money on the chance of what you might get back from your deposit with Siegel if you sued him for false pretenses. And yet, in the next sentence, Vignal advises you to stand up against Siegel trying to turn you out because you can't and won't and oughtn't to pay the rest. He says, 'hold on to the place if you possibly can, and make Siegel attack you in the courts, so you can have a chance of bringing out the real facts and perhaps proving that you're an injured man.' He thinks if you could stop here instead of submitting to be turned out, the courts would very likely decide that you'd paid Siegel already as much as the business is worth, and the place would be accounted ours. Isn't that a mockery, when Monsieur Vignal knows as well as we do we haven't a penny to live on--that the Riviera's empty these war days, that nobody buys our plants, and you can't fill orders from over the Swiss or Italian frontiers, even if you could get _half_ as many as Siegel's lying books showed?\"  \"Vignal means well,\" said the man. \"It's good of him to advise me"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42919"],["title","Angel Unawares: A Story of Christmas Eve (#2)"],["body"," asking for pay.\"  \"No more than a Frenchman ought to do for a Belgian!\" the woman retorted. \"The refugees who ask for charity get all the sympathy. We, who ask only for work--\"  \"We have received kindness, too. Don't let's doubt God's goodness on the eve of Christmas--the day when He gave His only Son for us all, my Suze! . . . 'Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.' Well, there's _no_ evil in this day--or to-morrow. There sha'n't be. Let's trust; let's not stop hoping, for not to hope is death. You go to the children, dearest, now, and I'll slip around the back way with this tree, so they sha'n't see it till it's lighted and decorated to-night---\"  \"Lighted and decorated!\" Suze echoed, with a laugh that came trembling out of tears.  \"Yes,\" insisted Paul, \"trust me. Your husband isn't an artist for nothing! Come along. No more time for repining if the tree's to be ready before the children's bedtime. I tell you, it will be a great work!\"  \"You're the most wonderful man in the world!\" breathed Suze senior. \"And we _adore you_--our soldier who fights for us always. Oh, but listen! There's Paulette calling me. I told the two I'd be back before they finished their Christmas present for father. Guess what it is--but no, it wouldn't be fair to the poor little things. They're coming to look for me. If you go by the mimosa path you can get away before they see you.\"  Without a word, the man picked up the miniature pine-tree and, shouldering it, limped off almost at a run. At the same instant the woman went down on her knees and began once more to drape the gray bagging over the flower-bed, as if nothing had happened to interrupt her task.  \"Here I am, by the palm-grove. Come and help me cover the flowers!\" she cried, almost cheerily, in answer to a child shouting \"Maman! Maman!\"  At the silver sound of the little voice, the kitten in Angel Odel's lap stiffened itself for a spring. Mechanically her hands tightened on the ball of fluff, but it wriggled free, and, with a jump, landed clear of the palm, on the grass beyond. Small as it was, the little animal left the fronds rustling in its wake, and the woman on her knees, looking up with a start, caught a glimpse of something gray under the tree. Two pinafored children, emerging from a side-path, caught the same glimpse, and as the younger snatched up the kitten the elder took a step forward and parted the long green plumes of the agitated palm.  \"Why, mother!\" she exclaimed in French, \"there's a strange child under our tree, sitting on _our_ seat! Oh, but a beautiful child in splendid clothes. Can she be real, or--oh, mother! Is she the Christmas fairy father says God sends to bless those who love one another?\"  Without answering, the woman got up from her knees. Flushed with embarrassment, she peeped over her daughter's golden head. The younger girl peeped, also, hanging shyly to her mother's dress. It was a horrid moment for Angel Odell.  The children were smaller than she--not more than six and four years old at most--and they were, Angel saw at a glance, pretty as life-size dolls, with their yellow curls, rose-red cheeks, and pink pinafores. Their great blue eyes stared at her, not with anger, but bewildered admiration. Even their mother did not look as if she meant to scold or sweep the intruder angrily out of her hiding-place. But, child as she was, Angel realized that she had been doing a forbidden thing, a shameful thing. She had been eavesdropping. She had seen the woman crying; she had heard her talking over family secrets with her husband; she had come to know what she had no right to know, and what those two had meant for each other's hearts alone. Ever since she was old enough to learn anything, she had been taught that \"eavesdropping\" was one of those disgusting sins no honorable girl or boy could possibly commit. Her father himself had said those very words; unforgettable words, because father was Angel's hero. What would he think if he could see her now? Somehow, she _must_ atone!  \"I--I didn't _mean_ to hide,\" she stammered. \"I looked in--the gate was open. I thought--maybe it was a fairy garden--\"  \"Oh, mother, you see she _is_ a fairy,\" gasped Suze junior, the elder of the children.  \"Perhaps,\" agreed Suze senior, doubtfully. And her eyes challenged the stranger. \"Who are you, really? Where do you come from?\"  \"I--I _often_ play I'm a fairy.\" The culprit seized the straw held out to her. \"I--expect I _am_ one. I know the _me_ in the looking-glass is, and sometimes I can't tell which is which Mademoiselle plays _she_ can't, either. She says when I come in, 'Which is this, today, the angel or the fairy?' My name's Angela.\"  \"Oh mother!\" breathed both children together, their eyes round with awe. \"An angel and a fairy.\"  \"And I'm lost,\" the wonderful visitor hurried on, heading off an answer from mother. \"I don't know where I live.\"  \"She doesn't know where she lives,\" murmured Suze and Paulette, in chorus. \"Then she can stay always and live with us, can't she?\"  \"Perhaps she wouldn't want to do that,\" said Suze senior. \"Perhaps _she_ has a mother waiting for her somewhere.\"  \"But do fairies have mothers?\" Paulette wanted to know.  \"Or angels?\" added Suze. \"I always thought they hadn't.\"  \"_I_ have,\" the visitor announced, hastily. \"Some kinds of angels do--the kind like me. My name's Angel Odell.\"  \"Well, I _never_ supposed angels had last names,\" Paulette reflected, aloud. \"I thought they were just called Gabriel or something like that, and that they were generally boys.\"  \"Oh _no!_\" Angel Odell announced, with decision. \"Boys are _never_ angels, anyhow, not in America where I live when I'm home.\"  \"She lives in America,\" the two children repeated to their mother. \"That's not fairyland or heaven, is it?\"  \"Fairyland can be anywhere, your father says,\" Suze senior answered. \"But see, it's going to be twilight soon! I think we must try to find out where Angel Odell lives, and take her home. She says she's lost--so her mother will be anxious.\"  \"She thinks I'm with my governess,\" said Angel.  \"Oh, fairy angels have _governesses_,\" the elder sister mourned, another illusion gone. \"That's as bad as being a real child and going to school.\" The two spoke English or French indiscriminately, seeming hardly to know which language they used, but luckily Angel understood French very well, thanks to Paris and Mademoiselle Rose.  \"I like my governess,\" she explained. \"She's very pretty and she's engaged to a soldier. That's why I'm lost. Because she met him by the sea, instead of his being dead as she thought, so she forgot to watch me. I was going home alone when I saw your garden gate open, and it looked just like fairyland. If you please, I wish you would find where I live. It's a--hotel, and it has a garden, too, but not like this.\"  Suze senior set her wits to work. She knew that, in those days of war, not many hotels were open in Mentone. She questioned Angel, and, learning that the hotel garden was high above the sea, with glass screens to keep off the wind and a view where you saw the town all piled together on the side of a hill with dark, tall trees on top, she guessed the Bellevue.  \"We'll all three put on our hats and cloaks, and take you back to your mother,\" she said, with the thought in her mind, perhaps, that Paul would be glad of the children's absence while he did his part of the tree-dressing. \"Suze and Paulette will leave you the kitten to play with, and you won't mind being alone here again for a few minutes, while we get ready?\"  Even if Angel had minded, now that a blue veil of twilight was dropping over the garden, she would have said \"No,\" bravely, to wipe off ever so little, if she could, of the stain of eavesdropping. But suddenly, when the children's mother asked that question, and she realized that she would have the place to herself, the most wonderful idea came into her head, straight and direct as a bee flies into an open flower. She happened at the moment to be putting on her mittens preparatory to a start, when a glint of her mother's diamond flashed up from her plump little thumb to her eyes. The flash was an inspiration. When the children and their mother were out of the way she would pull off her hair-ribbon and tie the ring to the kitten's neck. Then, when they had taken her home and come back, Suze and Paulette would find the ring and think it the magic gift of a fairy, because (they would say to each other) no ordinary little girl could have a gorgeous diamond like that to give away.  Oh, it was a splendid idea! Angel was sure her mother would approve when she had thoroughly explained, for mother was rich. Angel had often heard servants at home and in hotels, away over across the sea in America, telling one another that Mrs. Odell's father was Cyrus P. Holroyd, one of the big millionaires. Mother herself had heaps and heaps of money, too much to please father; and grandpa-- that very Cyrus P. Holroyd--was always sending presents of jewelry and things. He sent beautiful presents to Angel, as well. Probably she would find some from him when she went home, for when you visited at grandpa's house in New York, it was the rule to begin Christmas on Christmas Eve, and have still _more_ things on Christmas morning, too, when you thought you had got all there were.  No sooner had Suze senior and her two children turned their backs than Angel proceeded hurriedly to carry out her idea. The kitten, unused to being personally decorated at Christmas or any other time, resisted the ribbon with some determination. But Angel was even more determined, and, as in war, size counted. Before the trio returned, ready for their walk, the bow had been tied and the victim had dashed angrily away. This vanishing act suited Angel precisely, for the bright blue of the ribbon was conspicuous on the white fur, even in twilight, and to have the fairy's legacy discovered in the fairy's presence would have been premature. In fact, it would have"]]]
