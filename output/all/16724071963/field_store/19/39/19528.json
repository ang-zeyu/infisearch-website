The fools were turning their infra-red beams on it!  \"Lock!\" Sine shouted, pressing the trigger and jumping back.  Instantly the ship was surrounded by an oval of brilliant orange and white fire. The valve clicked shut in Sine's face, and he dived through the second one into the interior, tripping the lock of that one also.  Through the ports nothing was to be seen now save fire. They were in an inferno of brilliant light and heat. But through the glare and smoke Sine saw a white-hot spot suddenly appear on the blister wall. The Jovians were melting their way through! The metal plates sagged like wet paper, dropped limply. Back of the hole, luridly illuminated, stood the foremost of a detachment of fighting men, eager to leap to the fray, waiting only for the metal to cool a little.  But the thermite had been burning steadily, biting through the tough skin of the metal moon. Just as the fugitives were beginning to wonder whether they would be incinerated in their self-made prison there was a lurch. Through the hull of their own vessel they could hear the tearing of metal as the weakened plates were sheared away. They found themselves in space, with the great ball of the Pleasure Bubble floating away from them. Just outside of the gaping hole in the sphere floated the bodies of twenty or thirty men, blown out by the escaping air.  The air was escaping in a prodigious geyser; unimpeded by an atmosphere, it spewed out, visible like a cloud due to its moisture, smooth like an inflating balloon without billows. The ball of vapor expanded swiftly toward the gray vastness of Jupiter 100,000 miles below, enveloping the fugitive ship for a time, then passing on, like an enormous milky white cloud, falling swiftly until it was lost in the darkness, still expanding.  Overhead The Bubble continued serenely on its course, the sweeping curve of its crystal hemisphere visible. But now the actinic lights that had served as artificial suns were dark. The great man-made paradise was as cold and dead as the Earth's moon. Death stalked its pleasure palaces. Already up there the pleasant rippling lakes must be skimmed over with ice, the luxuriant vegetation stiff, crackling with frost.  Despite the selfishness, the cruelty, the utter callousness of the First Race, Sine felt a pang of regret over the destruction of so much beauty.  A messenger from the astrogator's cabin, a man whose skin was seared and scorched so that it looked like an alligator's hide, touched Lents' arm.  \"Jan would like to have you verify the course.\" There was apprehension in the man's voice. Member of a race so long enslaved, restrained, he feared the freedom of open space.  They swept slowly past The Bubble, gaining speed. Suddenly there was a cry from the stern look-out:  \"The ship's heating. Stop it! Something's wrong.\"  Sine, rushing to answer the call, found that the ship was indeed heating up. Shielded from the sun's rays as they were, this was inexplicable. And then he saw the dull red pinpoint of light.  He had not seen it before, that patrol ship, clinging like a leech to the airlock of the crystal hemisphere. There had been men in there when the air escaped. They had been saved from death by the closing of their automatic airlocks.  \"Better get back into the shelter of The Bubble,\" he told Jan after a hurried trip to the astrogator's cabin. The spider man turned the vessel, and they scurried back to shelter. Although the patrol ship tried its gravity buttons on them, the Mugs had fully equipped their own vessel with similar, and larger buttons which were occasionally used in regulating the metal satellite's orbit. They could neutralize the other vessel's gravity force with ease.  \"And yet,\" Sine admitted to the serious little group in the cabin, as they once more floated in space under the immense sphere, \"they seem to have us stymied.\"  \"Suppose they follow us around here?\" Kass asked somewhat nervously.  \"I don't think they can,\" Sine said. \"I noticed when we came to The Bubble first, the ships are locked to the gaskets from inside the sphere. The men inside the ship can not unlock their ship unless they open the emergency air curtain. If they did their air would all escape through the sphere. They could do it, of course, if they put on space suits. But that procedure would take an hour, and in the mean time we could get out of range of their heat rays. So we have them stymied too. Except for one thing----\"  \"Of course,\" Lents grunted. \"We can't get at them, and they can't get at us, but in a few hours we'll be in sunlight again, and some patrol will pick us up.\"  The Mugs, watching fearfully from beyond the doorway, turned aside. Were they, after a mere glimpse of freedom, to be immediately returned to the bondage which had become unbearable to them? Sine felt a small, thin hand slip into his. He looked down into the wistful face of Proserpina looking up at him with hope, with confidence. All at once his shyness vanished as he realized that Proserpina's obvious adoration for him was only the admiration of a child for a very big and very wonderful brother. At the same time his desire to do something to release them all from their peril was intensified by the imperatively felt need to justify her confidence in him. An idea came.  \"Jan,\" he asked. \"What is the energy output--the total capacity--of our gravity buttons?\"  Jan named an approximate figure in ergs.  \"Lents, if you've ever calculated to a purpose, calculate now! How much energy is represented by the mass of that sphere at its orbital velocity?\"  \"I get you!\" The fat scientist puffed out his cheeks with excitement. \"Have to estimate the mass first.\" He picked up a stylus from the astrogator's table, worked furiously on a tablet. Kass and Jan watched apprehensively. The Pleasure Bubble, with its freight of the dead, was hurrying remorselessly to its rendezvous with the sunlight.  \"Whoops!\" Lents threw his tablet into the air in extravagant triumph. \"She'll do!\"  \"Stations!\" shouted Jan, in his curious strained voice, and men rushed eagerly to their posts, still hazy as to their object but cheered by the knowledge that there was hope after all.  Then began one of the strangest duels in the history of the solar system. Setting the nose of their vessel against the gigantic metal satellite, they directed the stern gravity buttons against a distant star, and applied full force to slow the sphere in its orbit.  The forces liberated were terrific. The sphere's tough skin, three inches thick, buckled and bent inward until the ship was almost buried in a pit of its own creation. Jan stood hunched over the activator lever like a great spider, ready to throw it into neutral at the first sign of an actual rupture, which would send them crashing through the internal cells and girders of the sphere.  \"She's folding up like a squeezed orange peeling!\" Kass muttered, running his hand over his bald head.  \"Built to withstand internal pressure--nothing like this,\" Jan gasped. \"Stout ship, this!\" he added a moment later. \"We thought we might have to ram our way out.\"  She was indeed a stout ship--this vessel of escape. Though she shivered and groaned, she gave no indication of failure.  \"Wonder if the others are pushing against us!\" Kass suddenly thought of another possibility.  \"We--can--outpush 'em.\" Jan gasped. \"Got to sit down. Here you take it!\" Sine stepped into his place. Vague shocks and noises were transmitted to them through the hull. The huge sphere was collapsing progressively.  Lents came puffing from an observation port.  \"She's slowing!\" he reported triumphantly. \"Our trajectory--give her a little more!\"  The Joy Bubble was becoming more and more disc-shaped, and it was slowly turning on a major axis as the contending forces became uncentered.  \"Flopping like a flapjack,\" Lents commented as he watched the shifting vista. A moment later; \"It's a close squeeze. See there, past the horizon--a prominence?\"  It was like a white plume, this jet of vapor thrown far into space. Not uncommon in Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere. But it was bright, dazzling! That meant they were not far from the sunlight!  \"Pull away!\" the fat mathematician shouted. \"We have to take a chance!\" Instantly Sine reversed the lever. Everyone grasped handholds as the ship backed out of the pit. Now they could see the vast ruin they had wrought. Sine gave her all the speed he dared, for the sun, for home!  The great ruin was slowly turning, and in a few minutes they saw again the darker shadow that was the fighting patrol ship, still clamped to her side. At the same instant the dull red pinpoint winked on. The Jovians had sighted them again! In a few minutes the hull was getting uncomfortably warm.  Lents laid down his pad.  \"They will crash!\" he declared. \"But they have an hour, the fools! Instead of trying to burn us why don't they get into their space suits and free themselves?\"  Jan, resting on the bench, shook his shaggy head.  \"They are a great people, stupid but great. They will try to punish us till they die.\"  The wreckage drifted closer and closer to Jupiter, and still the red beam played steadily on the fleeing prisoners' ship. The distance had become so great that it could only be seen through an old telescope that the prisoners had somehow procured. But the prisoners were gasping. Their hull was cherry-red on the outside, and still heating. A few more minutes and the heat would be unbearable.  \"They are getting closer--closer--they are in the sunlight. Now I can see better. I believe they will skip by--no! They've dived into the vapor! They're out again. Skipped out like a flat stone on water. Sinking again--almost over the horizon. Gone, I guess. Whew, it's hot!\"  They were accelerating so fast that they had to turn on the interior gravity buttons to equalize the pressure on their bodies. Behind lay the vast, fog-bound planet of Jupiter. Ahead was the beautiful sun."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41084"],["title","The Metal Moon (#8)"],["body"," And somewhere beyond, and still invisible, Earth the lovely, the green, the Mother of the human race!"]]]
