He took the report to his opposite number in the Medical Corps, a man whose abilities in brain-surgery were mentioned in hushed voices at Johns Hopkins. Over a highball he told the whole story for the first time, hoping it wouldn't be received with hoots.  It wasn't. The white-haired surgeon looked long and meditatively at his drink. Then he said, \"Kermit, I can't begin to account for it; I have muddled around in the human brain enough to know that what we like to call our scientific knowledge is at best empirical. You say this man had his ability _before_ he was wounded?\"  \"He built a Sherman tank two years before we did,\" said the General. \"Yet he claims the whole process is purely logical.\"  \"Logic!\" exclaimed the brain-man with a scorn that matched the General's own on the subject. \"Logic is hindsight, Kermit. When our brains, by some intuitive process of progressive thought, reach a desired point, our egos reach backward to give the process a sort of order we call logic. Actually we seldom know how we get where we do; but we're too damned conceited to admit it.  \"What in hell do we know about the brain?\" he went on. \"I knew a perfectly healthy young girl once, who was killed when she was standing beside her horse--the horse sneezed, jerked his head up, and jolted the side of her jaw. Yet back in seventeen eighty-one, when Arnold ordered the massacre at Fort Griswold, one old rebel was bayonetted, had his skull smashed open so that his brains were oozing out on the ground. He recovered and lived for forty years afterward, sane as you please. And they didn't have fellows like me, not then. If they had, he'd probably have died on the operating table.\"  \"In other words you don't know,\" said the General.  \"I don't know, Kermit,\" replied the other. \"Another drink?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The next day the international situation showed signs of serious deterioration, and the General took a plane to New York. All the way up he thought of something else the Surgeon-General had said to him--\"One thing I have learned, it isn't exactly in my province, but I've run into it enough to make an observation.  \"Whenever I've met anyone with what might be called a special gift--psychic or what have you--I've found them scared to death of it. Damned if I know why....\"  He ruminated a little before continuing. \"You'd think they'd be delighted--but they aren't. They either run to religion, and try to drown it in ritual--or they try to explain it away by some rationalization. Like your friend.\"  \"Then you're willing to accept the fact he has a supernatural gift?\" the General asked.  The brain-man shrugged and said, \"Supernatural--supernormal--he's got something, if what you tell me is true. Can you think of a better 'ole?\"   4  When he was driven up to the Long Island chalet early that afternoon, the General was pleased to see a command car parked unobtrusively off the road, a sentry sitting in an impromptu sentry-box made of pine bows, that commanded a good view of the approaches. At least, he thought, _They_ wouldn't find MacReedy easy to get at. According to the reports he had seen there had been no further attempts.  Toby opened the door. He said, \"Hello, General, this is fine. We were going to send you a message tonight.\"  The General shook hands and said, \"Progress?\" and, when the boy nodded excitedly, \"Why aren't you in school?\"  \"It's after three o'clock,\" was the devastating reply, as Toby led him toward the cellar stairs. The General wondered briefly how much he had managed to forget in his fifty-two years.  Angus MacReedy was working at his carving table with a blow-up of the spy-pictures tacked to the cellar wall in front of him, a pile of rough-sketched plans on the table. He rose and said, \"I was just doing a little polishing, General. But you hit it about right.\"  \"Good,\" said the General. \"Got it solved?\"  \"I think so,\" said the model-maker. \"Take a look.\"  It was an eerie-looking item--a sort of stove-pipe mounted on a disc, surrounded by a flock of flying buttresses. Frowning the General peered at it, then looked at the blow-ups on the walls. From the correct angle, the similarity was ominously unmistakable. He said, \"What in hell is it, Captain?\"  MacReedy grinned. \"Looks weird, doesn't it? It had me stumped for the better part of a week. There's only one thing it could be and that's what it is. Look....\"  He picked up a sort of miniature torpedo from the work-table, dropped it down the stove-pipe. The thing worked like a trench-mortar. Some spring in the base of the tube sent the rocket flying in a high arc to smack the opposite wall and drop to the floor.  \"It's a mobile rocket-launcher,\" he said needlessly. \"I'd lay odds it can be used for atomic warheads.\"  \"Good Lord!\" cried the General. His mind was in a racing turmoil. The problem with the Nazi V-1 and V-2 weapons during World War Two had been the immobility of their launching platforms. If _They_ had managed to get around it....  He thought of an insuperable obstacle, said, \"But what about back-blast? Don't tell me they've found a metal able to stand up under the heat of launching.\"  \"I doubt it,\" replied MacReedy seriously. \"They use this barrel to give her a boost like a trench-mortar shell. My hunch is the rocket doesn't fire until she's well off the ground.\"  \"Is it accurate?\" the General asked, thunderstruck.  \"Is a trench-mortar accurate?\" the model-maker countered. \"Ask anybody who's been in Korea.\"  It was a wallop for the General. Atomic rocket-launchers, mobile rocket-launchers that could function as artillery, could outrange the A-gun perhaps by hundreds of miles. And if the missiles thus fired could be guided--he could see no reason why not--the A-gun was already obsolete.  He sat down on a packing box and mopped his brow although the cellar was far from hot. He said and his voice was unsteady, \"Thanks, MacReedy, I think maybe you have done it.\"  \"I think so,\" said the model-maker. He wasn't boasting, but he was sure of himself. \"You want to take it along with you? It should be quite simple to make. I've got a few improvements over _Their_ supports, I think.\"  \"If it's the last thing I do,\" said the General, rising, \"I'm going to see you get credit for what you've done.\"  MacReedy made a gesture of dismissal. \"Don't let it bother you, General,\" he said. \"I like my work. Maybe you could arrange for me to make some models for the War College.\"  \"Hell, why not the Smithsonian?\" said the General. \"Why not both? We ought to have a historical ordnance exhibit somewhere. And you're the man, no doubt about it.\"  As he left with the precious model MacReedy asked, \"By the way, General, what do you want me to work on next?\"  The General hesitated, then said, \"Follow your hunches--logic if you will. Let's see what the next weapon after this one is going to be. You've been ahead of us the rest of the way.\"  \"I'll see what I can do,\" said MacReedy with his quiet smile. \"Let me know how things come out.\"  \"That I will,\" said the General. Toby walked with him to the car and the General gave him another five dollars. He wished he could do something more for both of them; but at the moment it was out of the question.         *       *       *       *       *  It was almost six months before the General got back to the Long Island chalet. Thanks to his now fully-established reputation as an inventive genius, he was able to get a full speed ahead order on the new-type mobile rocket-launcher. MacReedy's improvements were valid, and the Department experts came up with further simplifications. By the time they were ready to go into production they actually had the weapon self-propelled, were well ahead of _Them_ on mobility, range and accuracy. It promised to be a military revolution.  Then the General had to make a flying trip around the world--to visit American military installations in Western Europe, in Italy and Spain, in Africa, Formosa, Japan and Korea. He got back to Washington, a thoroughly tired man, and walked into both his promised third star and the Chiefship of the Department. Also into an international situation worse than any since September, 1939--when the Nazis invaded Poland.  _They_ were pushing aggressively in both Europe and Asia, pushing with an arrogance that suggested they felt they could win in a walk if the free nations of the world offered large-scale military defiance. Rumors of a terrible secret weapon were being bruited about--not only in hush-hush military circles but in the public prints as well. One picture magazine of national circulation had actually published an article stating that _They_ had mastered pushbutton warfare.  The General, and the Combined Chiefs made a hurried and secret trip to Aberdeen the day after his return. There, on the proving ground, they watched a big transport-plane land on a makeshift airstrip. They saw a small group of soldiers unload from the plane an odd-looking tractor-mounted weapon that resembled an immense stove-pipe with certain refinements.  They saw a lean sausage of a rocket rolled into a door near the base of the tube, watched a trifle nervously while it was elevated almost vertically. An order was barked, a button was pushed--and the rocket rose rapidly from the tube with a dullish report, rose to a height of perhaps a hundred yards.  Then, suddenly, its tail blossomed smoke and flame; it rose with a new lease on life, to disappear into the heavens, leaving a trail of smoke behind it. Pointing to a prefabricated building that stood alone, a mile away, the General said, \"Watch that target, gentlemen,\" and lifted his field glasses to his eyes.  A minute later--fifty-eight seconds was the exact time--the structure was suddenly obliterated by a tremendous explosion. The General sighed and said quietly, \"That was TNT. We have a stockpile of atomic weapons ready.\"  \"But the accuracy!\" exclaimed a weathered full admiral. \"With the wind and the earth's rotation to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41062"],["title","The Final Figure (#4)"],["body","consid....\" He hesitated, then said, \"Oh, a guided missile.\"  The General nodded, and said, \"We can put batteries of these new missile-launchers, completely-mobile and with atomic heads, anywhere in the world within twenty-four hours by plane. They have a reasonably effective range of small targets of just over two hundred miles--with air-guidance, of course, over target. Gentlemen, I think _They_ are in for a surprise.\"  _They_ got it two days later--in another special test of the new weapon. The General didn't even bother to watch it. His attention was focussed upon a stocky blond man who wore the gaudy shoulder-boards of a lieutenant colonel, and was present as assistant military-attache and qualified observer. His face remained impassive, save for a slight twitch of the lips, when the target was obliterated.  Which was enough to satisfy the General.         *       *       *       *       *  Denied a sure-thing victory _They_ were forced to call off _Their_ war--with violent internal results. It became quickly evident that _They_ were going to be busy for a long time keeping order within their own boundaries. The international situation became easier and happier than at any time since Locarno.  The General, who was due shortly to receive his fourth star, played an active role in the military portion of the peace-making. He had little time even to think of Angus MacReedy and little Toby and the miracle-workroom on Long Island. When he did think of them it was with an inner warmth that was almost devout, with a resolve to see that the model-maker received a satisfactory reward.  Then one morning, while skimming through a stack of reports, a phrase caught his eye. It read--       _... and in accord with current fiscal retrenchment-policies, all      personnel on special duty were called in for terminal assignments.      These included...._  The report was from Second District HQ at Governor's Island. With a sinking sensation he scanned the list. There it was--special sentry-detail to guard house of Captain Angus MacReedy (ret). He picked up a telephone and called Governor's Island direct.  Yes, the detail had been withdrawn more than a week earlier.... No, there had been no report of trouble.... Hold on, there was something in the morning paper....  The General made it in less than two hours. Angus MacReedy had been shot in the back of his head the previous evening, while building model soldiers in his cellar workroom. A boy who lived next door and heard the shot while on his way to pay MacReedy a visit, had seen the murderer drive away in a black sedan. He had given the alarm and local constabulary had picked up the trail and given chase. Ignoring a red light, their quarry had been killed when his sedan was hit by a truck. He had no identification on him but appeared to be a stocky blond man of about forty. An alien pistol, recently discharged, had been found in the wreckage.  The General and Toby stood alone in the strangely empty workroom. Only an ugly, dark stain on the floor remained to mark the recent violence that had occurred there. The General looked at the table, then at the boy. He said, \"Toby, do you know, what your Uncle Angus was working on recently?\" He felt a little ashamed thus to try to pick the brains of a murdered man through a child.  \"He'd been pretty busy with orders from the shop,\" said Toby thoughtfully. \"And he'd just finished _that_.\" He nodded toward an unpainted lead miniature on the work-table.  The General looked at it closely, and felt the blood drain from his face. He had told MacReedy to try to work out the next weapon after the guided-missile launcher....  \"Are you sick, General?\" Toby asked, breaking in on his abstraction. \"You mustn't take it so hard, sir.\"  \"I'm--all right, Toby,\" he said. \"It's been a bit of a shock, that's all.\"  \"It's been horrible,\" said Toby, his voice quite steady. \"Uncle Angus was a great man. I'll never be able to be as great.\"  \"You'll never know till you try,\" said the General. He thought that _They_ had not forgotten--_They_ had killed him for losing _Them_ _Their_ war. It was up to him, the General, to see that Angus MacReedy's final prophecy proved false.  Well, he had the power now to carry a little weight--thanks to the murdered man. Standing there in the cellar, the General made a vow to see that during his lifetime the peace was kept, to help set up some sort of organization that would keep the peace when he was gone.  \"Will it be okay for me to take this?\" Toby had picked up the final figure and was regarding it reverently.  \"What? Oh, I don't see why not.\"  He said goodby to the boy outside and got into his car for the drive back to the airfield. Hence, he didn't see Toby carry the unpainted figure the hundred yards to his house, didn't see Toby place it carefully at the end of a row of gay little figures that included Napoleon, Marlborough, Suleiman the Great, Charles XII of Sweden, Henry V, Tamerlaine, Genghis Khan, Charles Martel, Julius Caesar--and newer or perhaps older, figurines of Alexander the Great, Xerxes, Cyrus the Great, Nebuchadnezzar and a trio of even more primitive conquerors.  \"Gee,\" said Toby to himself, \"I'm sorry Uncle Angus had to be killed. But if he had to be killed, I'm glad he got my historical set just about finished. I can paint this cave-man myself.\"  A few minutes later his mother called him to supper."]]]
