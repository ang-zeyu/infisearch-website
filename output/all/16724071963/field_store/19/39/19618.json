What do you suppose--?\"  \"Don't ask!\" Dave cut in. \"I've been slowly going nuts asking myself the same question over and over again. Oh, heck, let's go. They can't do any more than shoot us!\"  They walked the short distance to the Air Ministry in mutual thoughtful silence. Just inside the wide front doors of the building, they gave their names, ranks, and squadron numbers to an officer seated at a desk that was practically covered with rows of bell buttons. When they added that they were reporting on orders to Air Vice-Marshal Saunders, the officer shot a scowling glance at their uniforms. He didn't say anything, however. He simply nodded, wrote something on a card and then jabbed a button and picked up a Husho-Phone. A moment later he hung up and stabbed another button. An R.A.F. staff sergeant seemed to pop down out of the air. The non-commissioned officer saluted smartly. The officer at the desk handed him the card.  \"Take these two officers to Air Vice-Marshal Saunders,\" he said in a crisp voice.  The staff sergeant took the card with his left hand, saluted smartly again with his right, and looked at Dave and Freddy. They nodded. The sergeant clicked his heels, executed a smart about-face and went off down the hall. Dave and Freddy followed.  \"Holy smoke!\" Dave breathed out of the corner of his mouth. \"Did you get a load of all the bell buttons on that desk, Freddy? I wonder if he's got one that'll do it? There sure are enough.\"  \"Do what?\" Freddy whispered back. \"What are you talking about?\"  \"A button he can jab to make Hitler pop out of a secret door in the wall,\" Dave chuckled. \"Boy, wouldn't it be something if all those connecting wires should get mixed up! I think I could enjoy myself at that officer's desk some quiet night with nobody around.\"  \"I can just imagine!\" Freddy grunted. \"And what a madhouse this place would be the next morning! Well, forget it, my lad. There's a chap at that desk twenty-four hours a day, I fancy.\"  Dave glanced back over his shoulder just in time to see the officer reaching out to punch another button. He sighed heavily.  \"It's still a swell idea,\" he murmured. \"Well, we're getting close.\"  The office of Air Vice-Marshal Saunders was at the rear of the third floor. The sergeant turned the two boys over to a smartly uniformed flight lieutenant in the outer office. A moment or two later the flight lieutenant ushered them into the presence of the high ranking Air Force official. As Dave saluted and looked at the tall, well built figure, a strange sense of relief flooded through him. There wasn't any worry in him any more, only wonder. Air Vice-Marshal Saunders had not reached his position of high responsibility through political pull, nor by knowing the right sort of people. You had only to glance at the rows of decoration ribbons under his pilot's wings over the left upper pocket of his tunic to know that. There was the red, blue, and red ribbon of the Distinguished Service Order (the D.S.O.). There was the blue and white ribbon of the Distinguished Flying Cross (the D.F.C.). And on that ribbon was the small silver rosette, or bar, which meant that its wearer had performed a feat of air valor for which he had been granted the D.F.C. a second time. There was also the Air Force Cross, and the Mons ribbon, denoting that Saunders had been with that valiant British army that had met the Germans at Mons in 1914, in the First World War. And, of course, there were ribbons to show that he had been decorated by many other governments. No, one look at Air Vice-Marshal Saunders' row of ribbons, and Dave knew that here was a real soldier, a real pilot, and a man who had won and deserved the high position he now held.  The vice-marshal smiled and nodded acceptance of their salute.  \"At ease, gentlemen,\" he said, and pointed to some chairs. \"Sit down. We'll have to wait a bit. The colonel is delayed, but he'll be here shortly. Ah! You were in London last night, eh?\"  Both boys looked blank for a moment. Then Freddy found his tongue.  \"Why--why, yes, sir,\" he stammered. \"But how did you guess, sir?\"  \"And I'll bet five pounds,\" the senior officer said with a laugh, \"that you two have been worrying yourselves sick that I would hit the ceiling, and rant and rave all over the place, eh?\"  \"Why, yes--sure--I mean--\" Dave stumbled and stopped. \"I don't think I understand, sir.\"  The vice-marshal laughed again and pointed a finger.  \"Your uniforms,\" he said. \"Souvenirs from Hitler, I fancy. Did a bomb fall on you, or did you go out hunting for one? Knowing you fighter command lads, I'm guessing it was the latter.\"  The words banished the last of any fears that might have been lingering in the boys' minds. They relaxed completely and laughed.  \"It was about halfway between, sir,\" Freddy explained. \"I mean, a couple of them landed close to the hotel, so--well, we went out and took a look, you might say.\"  \"We didn't bring extra uniforms, sir,\" Dave added. \"And this was the best the hotel could do. I'm sorry, sir.\"  \"Sorry?\" the air vice-marshal echoed. \"About a little bit of water-soaked and fire-scorched cloth? Rot! It's not the looks of a uniform that really counts; it's what's inside that matters. I won't push you for information, but I fancy you did more than just take a look. I--Ah! There's the colonel now.\"  The boys heard the door open in back of them. They both got quickly to their feet, turned around, and stopped dead with their eyes popping in sheer amazement. A big man in civilian clothes was walking into the room. He had a strip of surgeon plaster over his left eye, and his left hand was completely hidden by a bandage. He walked with a slight limp. The two boys watched him, speechless. They stared at him as though he were a ghost, because it was the man who had been trapped under the desk in that bomb-blasted building the night before.  \"Ah, good morning, Colonel,\" they heard Air Vice-Marshal Saunders say. \"Had a bit of an accident, eh? Or is this just another of Intelligence's disguises?\"  \"Not this time, sir,\" the colonel said with a tight smile. \"Caught a bit of trouble during that mess last night, and--Well, bless my stars!\"  The injured man had looked at Dave and Freddy for the first time. His eyes grew wide with amazement, and he gave a little shake of his head as though to clear his vision.  \"Great guns, you two?\" he gasped. Then, turning to Air Vice-Marshal Saunders: \"Are these two Pilot Officers Dawson and Farmer--the two I'm supposed to meet?\"  \"That's right, Colonel Fraser,\" the air vice-marshal replied. \"Why? You've already met them?\"  \"And jolly well right I have!\" the colonel exclaimed. \"But for these two chaps, and a fire lieutenant, I wouldn't be here now. I was in my secret office last night with two of my agents, and my secretary, when a bomb caught the place fair and square. We were all trapped under the wreckage. These two lads got us out a split second before the floor gave way and dropped everything down onto the next floor. Great guns, this is a small world. And say, you two, I'm deucedly sorry about last night.\"  \"Sorry, sir?\" Dave echoed, and gave him a questioning look.  The man reached up his good hand and touched the strip of plaster over his eye.  \"Got a bit of a crack, and it put me off my napper for a spell,\" he said. \"I was pretty much in a daze while you lads were saving our lives. When I came around, I found myself in my regular office in the War Office building. Must have walked all the way there. Everything came back to me clear as day, but you and those fire fighting chaps had left the spot by the time I got back there. But I certainly want to express my heartfelt thanks to you two, now. I certainly owe my life to you.\"  \"We're glad we were of service,\" Freddy said, as embarrassed crimson seeped up into his cheeks. \"How about the others, sir? Are they getting along all right?\"  \"Coming along fine,\" the other said. \"Miss Trumble, my secretary, will be out of things for a bit, and I'll certainly miss her. Smartest woman in the service. But that's a jolly sight better than losing her completely. By Jove, this is like a cinema thriller, isn't it! My word!\"  Dave and Freddy moved their feet uncomfortably and glanced at Air Vice-Marshal Saunders. The high ranking officer was grinning broadly and slowly nodding his head up and down.  \"So you simply just went to _take a look_, eh?\" he murmured. \"Knew perfectly well that it was much more than that. You two certainly have the reputation for chasing after trouble, _and_ whipping it.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: _Dave Dawson at Dunkirk._]  The air vice-marshal suddenly stopped short. The smile faded from his face, and he stared gravely at the two young R.A.F. pilots for a moment or two.  \"And that is just why you are here,\" he said presently. \"This officer, as you probably have guessed already, is Colonel Fraser, of British Intelligence. He is the one who wishes to speak with you. I only suggested to him that you two should have first chance to listen to what he has to say. Shall we all sit down? Colonel, are you ready to start?\"  The Intelligence officer seemed to have difficulty in tearing his eyes from the two boys. He finally succeeded, and nodded. And as though a curtain had been drawn across his face, he too became grave and unsmiling.  \"Yes, of course, sir,\" he said in a flat voice. \"Let's get on with it at once.\"  As Dave sat down on his chair again, his heart was pounding so hard he feared it would push right out through his chest. His throat was dry with excitement, and there was that familiar tingling at the back of his neck. The tingling was a sure sign that danger and action were waiting for him just ahead. He glanced at Freddy and saw the look in his pal's eyes. That look said that Freddy was thinking and wondering the same things.     CHAPTER SIX  _England Must Never Die_   It was a few moments before Colonel Fraser of British Intelligence began "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41715"],["title","Dave Dawson with the R.A.F. (#8)"],["body","talking. He sat staring unseeingly down at his bandaged left hand as though he were choosing the words he would speak. Presently, though, he lifted his head and looked at Dave and Freddy.  \"Adolf Hitler's greatest goal in life is to crush the British Empire completely,\" the Colonel began speaking. \"No matter what other battles or minor engagements his troops and his air force may win, they are but steps toward his great goal--the defeat of England. However, in order to defeat England, Hitler must invade and conquer these British Isles. He cannot bring us to our knees from across the Channel. He has got to come over here and beat us into submission. Invasion of England! Those words are on the tongue of every German today.\"  The colonel paused and pulled a battered pipe from his pocket and a pouch of tobacco. He started to fill the pipe, then stopped and glanced questioningly at Air Vice-Marshal Saunders. The high ranking R.A.F. officer smiled and nodded his head.  \"Certainly, Colonel,\" he said. \"Go right ahead and smoke.\"  The Intelligence officer smiled his thanks for permission and lighted up his pipe.  \"Yes, invasion of England is the German password today,\" he said when the pipe was going. \"And ever since Dunkirk and the fall of France the Germans have been preparing for the great attempt. We have been preparing, too--preparing to meet that invasion and throw it back into the Channel. I do not have to tell you of the preparations we have made. You've seen them countless times from the air, and you have no doubt seen them on the ground. Also, like every other man in uniform in England, you both have been constantly on the alert and ready to answer an invasion attempt alarm. Well, the attempt was not made right after Dunkirk. It was not made in the month of July. Nor was it made during the month of August. Why?\"  Colonel Fraser paused to tamp down the tobacco in his pipe with a fingertip.  \"Why?\" he repeated. He shrugged and made a little gesture with his pipe. \"I do not know,\" he said. \"No one in England knows. As a matter of fact, I'm quite sure that only Hitler knows. Of course we can guess at a thousand reasons why the attempt has not been made, yet. But it is possible that they might all be wrong. This much we _do_ know. It has not been made, yet. And this is something we can also be equally positive is true. The desire to invade and conquer England _has not left Hitler's mind for a single second_. The instant he believes that all is ready, he will give his generals the order to invade us. I mean, by that, to _attempt_ to invade us!\"  The colonel gave some more attention to his pipe and then continued.  \"Naturally, we haven't been so foolish as simply to prepare in every possible way we can, and then sit back and wait for him to strike. The R.A.F. Bombing Command has been blasting away at Nazi invasion bases on the French, Belgian, and Netherlands coasts night after night, as you both well know. The Navy has been on constant patrol seeking for signs of invasion. It is not known by many people, but we have even done a little invading of our own. Small detachments of sapper troops have slipped ashore in France under the cover of darkness, and made short raids as far inland as Lille. And as you two well know, the R.A.F. has made countless photo and reconnaissance patrols over the occupied countries. And lastly, but by no means least, British Intelligence agents have been sent into the occupied countries, and they have been working day and night, too, in an effort to ferret out scraps of information regarding Hitler's invasion plans. Now!\"  The Intelligence officer paused for breath, or perhaps for emphasis.  \"Now, this is what I'm leading up to,\" he said. \"The raids we've made, the pictures we've taken, the reports of pilots, and the reports of my own Intelligence agents indicate very strongly that the invasion attempt will be made soon. Perhaps in a couple of weeks, and perhaps in a couple of days. This month, September, the tides and the weather will all be in Hitler's favor. Frankly, I would be willing to stake my life that the attempt will be made sometime this month, but I have no idea whether it will be near the first of the month, or near the last, or even in the middle. That date, however, is something we have absolutely _got to find out_. And that is why I am now speaking to you two chaps.\"  A quivering sensation like a charge of high voltage electricity shot through Dave. A thousand questions hovered on the tip of his tongue, but he held them in check.  \"If there is anything I can do, sir,\" he said quietly, \"I most certainly want to do it.\"  \"And so do I!\" Freddy exclaimed with deep feeling. \"No matter what it is, sir.\"  \"I told you, Colonel,\" Air Vice-Marshal Saunders spoke up. \"I told you you could count on Dawson and Farmer.\"  The Intelligence officer seemed not to hear. He sat staring at the two youths. Dave had the strange feeling that the man was staring right into his brain and reading the thoughts there. A moment or so later the Colonel gave a short nod of his head and continued.  \"No matter what Hitler tries, we'll beat him at it,\" he said. \"If the invasion attempt comes tonight, we're ready, and we'll beat him. That, however, is not the way we want to beat him. We want to beat him _before_ he's hardly got started; to smash him _before_ he's even come within sight of our shores. In order to do that, though, _we must know the exact date set for the attempt_. That date can be learned. In fact, I almost learned it one day last week. I didn't because a German Messerschmitt pilot shot down and killed the man who was bringing that information back here to me in England!\"  The colonel suddenly stopped and seemed to have trouble with his throat. He swallowed a couple of times, then half turned and shot a faint frowning glance at Air Vice-Marshal Saunders. Dave looked at the R.A.F. officer just in time to catch the glint of deep sympathy and feeling that flickered through his eyes. Then Colonel Fraser went on speaking again.  \"I spoke of sending my Intelligence agents to the occupied countries. Well, some of them have been there since the war started. A few of them have been there all their lives--were born there, in fact. Intelligence and Secret Service agents are not always recognized citizens of the country they serve, you know. The agent of whom I speak now is a Belgian. All during the last war he fought side by side with British soldiers to free his country from Germany's grip. He is too old to fight as a soldier in this war, but he is fighting again to free his country from Germany's iron grip--Hitler's iron grip. He is doing his fighting in the dark and under cover, but more often than not that kind of fighting is more dangerous than fighting in the open. Every second of the day and night his life is in danger. He never knows when the hand of the German Gestapo may drop on his shoulder. He does not even expect the courtesy of being captured as a spy, in fact. He fully expects to be shot in the back the moment the Nazis realize who he is. But that constant danger does not stop him fighting for one single instant. He loves Belgium, the real Belgium, and he will gladly give his life to help England free Belgium of the Nazi chains of indescribable tyranny. I could talk all day of the things that man has already done for England's cause, but I won't. Just let me say that he has done enough to win the Victoria Cross a dozen times over.\"  The colonel took a moment to light his pipe, which had gone out. He puffed smoke toward the ceiling, and smiled faintly.  \"That man has gathered more valuable information for me,\" he said, \"than the whole British Intelligence Service put together. And, strange as it may sound, I have never met him personally. I hope some day to have that great honor, but somehow I rather doubt that I will. Anyway, he is the one man who can tell us when the invasion attempt will be made. Now, wait! I can tell from the expression that just this instant came into your faces, that you're wondering why he hasn't sent the information along to me. Well, he has tried to, several times. The last time was only last week. However, though I hate the very thought of the Nazis, I do not consider them as blind, stupid fools. They are ruthless and barbaric, but they are also very brainy, and are cunning and fiendishly clever beyond words. Naturally, they wish to keep their invasion attempt date a secret just as much as we wish to find it out. And so they are leaving no stone unturned to see that it remains a secret. To give it to you straight from the shoulder, five of my best agents have contacted this Belgian, but not one of them has returned to England alive. Every one has been caught in the invisible web the Nazis have thrown about Europe.\"  A cold lump suddenly formed in Dave's stomach, but he sat perfectly motionless and kept his eyes on Colonel Fraser's face. After a moment the cold lump gradually disappeared. He could guess now why he and Freddy had been summoned to Air Vice-Marshal Saunders' office. There was a job to be done--a job with danger and death constantly hovering about. But after the first start the truth had given him, he no longer felt fright or even slight uneasiness. He felt only the desire to serve humanity and civilization to the last ounce of his strength, and to the last drop of his blood. If the world and civilization went down under Hitler's heel, then life would not be worth the living. He felt that way as he returned the colonel's steady gaze. And the quiet rigidity of Freddy sitting in the chair next to his told him that his English pal felt exactly the same way.  \"I can see you two are getting the point,\" Colonel Fraser suddenly shot at them. \"I want to be fair with you, so I ask you this question. Do you want me to continue, or would you rather return to active duty at your squadron?\"  \"We want you to continue, sir,\" Dave said, speaking for himself and Freddy."]]]
