This done, we held a final consultation as to our plans, and went over each detail carefully, that we might fully understand each other under all possible circumstances, and act in concert.  One point we laboriously impressed upon each other, and that was; that under no circumstances were we to allow ourselves to be tempted to leave the Creek until we reached its junction with the Flint River.  I then picked up two pine leaves, broke them off to unequal lengths, rolled them in my hands behind my back for a second, and presenting them to Harney with their ends sticking out of my closed hand, said:  \"The one that gets the longest one goes first.\"  Harvey reached forth and drew the longer one.  We made a tour of reconnaissance.  Everything seemed as usual, and wonderfully calm compared with the tumult in our minds.  The Hospital guards were pacing their beats lazily; those on the Stockade were drawling listlessly the first \"call around\" of the evening:  \"Post numbah foah!  Half-past seven o'clock!  and a-l-l's we-l-ll!\"  Inside the Stockade was a Babel of sounds, above all of which rose the melody of religious and patriotic songs, sung in various parts of the camp.  From the headquarters came the shouts and laughter of the Rebel officers having a little \"frolic\" in the cool of the evening.  The groans of the sick around us were gradually hushing, as the abatement of the terrible heat let all but the worst cases sink into a brief slumber, from which they awoke before midnight to renew their outcries.  But those in the Gangrene wards seemed to be denied even this scanty blessing. Apparently they never slept, for their shrieks never ceased.  A multitude of whip-poor-wills in the woods around us began their usual dismal cry, which had never seemed so unearthly and full of dreadful presages as now.  It was, now quite dark, and we stole noiselessly down to the Creek and reconnoitered.  We listened.  The guard was not pacing his beat, as we could not hear his footsteps.  A large, ill-shapen lump against the trunk of one of the trees on the bank showed that he was leaning there resting himself.  We watched him for several minutes, but he did not move, and the thought shot into our minds that he might be asleep; but it seemed impossible: it was too early in the evening.  Now, if ever, was the opportunity.  Harney squeezed my hand, stepped noiselessly into the Creek, laid himself gently down into the filthy water, and while my heart was beating so that I was certain it could be heard some distance from me, began making toward the fence.  He passed under easily, and I raised my eyes toward the guard, while on my strained ear fell the soft plashing made by Harvey as he pulled himself cautiously forward.  It seemed as if the sentinel must hear this; he could not help it, and every second I expected to see the black lump address itself to motion, and the musket flash out fiendishly.  But he did not; the lump remained motionless; the musket silent.  When I thought that Harvey had gained a sufficient distance I followed. It seemed as if the disgusting water would smother me as I laid myself down into it, and such was my agitation that it appeared almost impossible that I should escape making such a noise as would attract the guard's notice.  Catching hold of the roots and limbs at the side of the stream, I pulled myself slowly along, and as noiselessly as possible.  I passed under the fence without difficulty, and was outside, and within fifteen feet of the guard.  I had lain down into the creek upon my right side, that my face might be toward the guard, and I could watch him closely all the time.  As I came under the fence he was still leaning motionless against the tree, but to my heated imagination he appeared to have turned and be watching me.  I hardly breathed; the filthy water rippling past me seemed to roar to attract the guard's attention; I reached my hand out cautiously to grasp a root to pull myself along by, and caught instead a dry branch, which broke with a loud crack.  My heart absolutely stood still.  The guard evidently heard the noise.  The black lump separated itself from the tree, and a straight line which I knew to be his musket separated itself from the lump.  In a brief instant I lived a year of mortal apprehension.  So certain was I that he had discovered me, and was leveling his piece to fire, that I could scarcely restrain myself from springing up and dashing away to avoid the shot.  Then I heard him take a step, and to my unutterable surprise and relief, he walked off farther from the Creek, evidently to speak to the man whose beat joined his.  I pulled away more swiftly, but still with the greatest caution, until after half-an-hour's painful effort I had gotten fully one hundred and fifty yards away from the Hospital fence, and found Harney crouched on a cypress knee, close to the water's edge, watching for me.  We waited there a few minutes, until I could rest, and calm my perturbed nerves down to something nearer their normal equilibrium, and then started on.  We hoped that if we were as lucky in our next step as in the first one we would reach the Flint River by daylight, and have a good long start before the morning roll-call revealed our absence.  We could hear the hounds still baying in the distance, but this sound was too customary to give us any uneasiness.  But our progress was terribly slow.  Every step hurt fearfully.  The Creek bed was full of roots and snags, and briers, and vines trailed across it.  These caught and tore our bare feet and legs, rendered abnormally tender by the scurvy.  It seemed as if every step was marked with blood.  The vines tripped us, and we frequently fell headlong.  We struggled on determinedly for nearly an hour, and were perhaps a mile from the Hospital.  The moon came up, and its light showed that the creek continued its course through a dense jungle like that we had been traversing, while on the high ground to our left were the open pine woods I have previously described.  We stopped and debated for a few minutes.  We recalled our promise to keep in the Creek, the experience of other boys who had tried to escape and been caught by the hounds.  If we staid in the Creek we were sure the hounds would not find our trail, but it was equally certain that at this rate we would be exhausted and starved before we got out of sight of the prison.  It seemed that we had gone far enough to be out of reach of the packs patrolling immediately around the Stockade, and there could be but little risk in trying a short walk on the dry ground.  We concluded to take the chances, and, ascending the bank, we walked and ran as fast as we could for about two miles further.  All at once it struck me that with all our progress the hounds sounded as near as when we started.  I shivered at the thought, and though nearly ready to drop with fatigue, urged myself and Harney on.  An instant later their baying rang out on the still night air right behind us, and with fearful distinctness.  There was no mistake now; they had found our trail, and were running us down.  The change from fearful apprehension to the crushing reality stopped us stock-still in our tracks.  At the next breath the hounds came bursting through the woods in plain sight, and in full cry.  We obeyed our first impulse; rushed back into the swamp, forced our way for a few yards through the flesh-tearing impediments, until we gained a large cypress, upon whose great knees we climbed--thoroughly exhausted--just as the yelping pack reached the edge of the water, and stopped there and bayed at us.  It was a physical impossibility for us to go another step.  In a moment the low-browed villain who had charge of the hounds came galloping up on his mule, tooting signals to his dogs as he came, on the cow-horn slung from his shoulders.  He immediately discovered us, covered us with his revolver, and yelled out:  \"Come ashore, there, quick: you---- ---- ---- ----s!\"  There was no help for it.  We climbed down off the knees and started towards the land.  As we neared it, the hounds became almost frantic, and it seemed as if we would be torn to pieces the moment they could reach us.  But the master dismounted and drove them back.  He was surly --even savage--to us, but seemed in too much hurry to get back to waste any time annoying us with the dogs.  He ordered us to get around in front of the mule, and start back to camp.  We moved as rapidly as our fatigue and our lacerated feet would allow us, and before midnight were again in the hospital, fatigued, filthy, torn, bruised and wretched beyond description or conception.  The next morning we were turned back into the Stockade as punishment.     CHAPTER XLIX.  AUGUST--GOOD LUCK IN NOT MEETING CAPTAIN WIRZ--THAT WORTHY'S TREATMENT OF RECAPTURED PRISONERS--SECRET SOCIETIES IN PRISON--SINGULAR MEETING AND ITS RESULT--DISCOVERY AND REMOVAL OF THE OFFICERS AMONG THE ENLISTED MEN.  Harney and I were specially fortunate in being turned back into the Stockade without being brought before Captain Wirz.  We subsequently learned that we owed this good luck to Wirz's absence on sick leave--his place being supplied by Lieutenant Davis, a moderate brained Baltimorean, and one of that horde of Marylanders in the Rebel Army, whose principal service to the Confederacy consisted in working themselves into \"bomb-proof\" places, and forcing those whom they displaced into the field.  Winder was the illustrious head of this crowd of bomb-proof Rebels from \"Maryland, My Maryland!\" whose enthusiasm for the Southern cause and consistency in serving it only in such places as were out of range of the Yankee artillery, was the subject of many bitter jibes by the Rebels--especially by those whose secure berths they possessed themselves of.

KEY--HIS ADVENTURES SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXECUTIONS --HE GOES OUTSIDE AT ANDERSONVILLE ON PAROLE--LABORS IN THE COOK-HOUSE --ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE--IS RECAPTURED AND TAKEN TO MACON--ESCAPES FROM THERE, BUT IS COMPELLED TO RETURN--IS FINALLY EXCHANGED AT SAVANNAH.  Leroy L. Key, the heroic Sergeant of Company M, Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry, who organized and led the Regulators at Andersonville in their successful conflict with and defeat of the Raiders, and who presided at the execution of the six condemned men on the 11th of July, furnishes, at the request of the author, the following story of his prison career subsequent to that event:  On the 12th day of July, 1864, the day after the hanging of the six Raiders, by the urgent request of my many friends (of whom you were one), I sought and obtained from Wirz a parole for myself and the six brave men who assisted as executioners of those desperados.  It seemed that you were all fearful that we might, after what had been done, be assassinated if we remained in the Stockade; and that we might be overpowered, perhaps, by the friends of the Raiders we had hanged, at a time possibly, when you would not be on hand to give us assistance, and thus lose our lives for rendering the help we did in getting rid of the worst pestilence we had to contend with.  On obtaining my parole I was very careful to have it so arranged and mutually understood, between Wirz and myself, that at any time that my squad (meaning the survivors of my comrades, with whom I was originally captured) was sent away from Andersonville, either to be exchanged or to go to another prison, that I should be allowed to go with them.  This was agreed to, and so written in my parole which I carried until it absolutely wore out.  I took a position in the cook-house, and the other boys either went to work there, or at the hospital or grave-yard as occasion required.  I worked here, and did the best I could for the many starving wretches inside, in the way of preparing their food, until the eighth day of September, at which time, if you remember, quite a train load of men were removed, as many of us thought, for the purpose of exchange; but, as we afterwards discovered, to be taken to another prison.  Among the crowd so removed was my squad, or, at least, a portion of them, being my intimate mess-mates while in the Stockade.  As soon as I found this to be the case I waited on Wirz at his office, and asked permission to go with them, which he refused, stating that he was compelled to have men at the cookhouse to cook for those in the Stockade until they were all gone or exchanged.  I reminded him of the condition in my parole, but this only had the effect of making him mad, and he threatened me with the stocks if I did not go back and resume work. I then and there made up my mind to attempt my escape, considering that the parole had first been broken by the man that granted it.  On inquiry after my return to the cook-house, I found four other boys who were also planning an escape, and who were only too glad to get me to join them and take charge of the affair.  Our plans were well laid and well executed, as the sequel will prove, and in this particular my own experience in the endeavor to escape from Andersonville is not entirely dissimilar from yours, though it had different results.  I very much regret that in the attempt I lost my penciled memorandum, in which it was my habit to chronicle what went on around me daily, and where I had the names of my brave comrades who made the effort to escape with me. Unfortunately, I cannot now recall to memory the name of one of them or remember to what commands they belonged.  I knew that our greatest risk was run in eluding the guards, and that in the morning we should be compelled to cheat the blood-hounds.  The first we managed to do very well, not without many hairbreadth escapes, however; but we did succeed in getting through both lines of guards, and found ourselves in the densest pine forest I ever saw.  We traveled, as nearly as we could judge, due north all night until daylight.  From our fatigue and bruises, and the long hours that had elapsed since 8 o'clock, the time of our starting, we thought we had come not less than twelve or fifteen miles.  Imagine our surprise and mortification, then, when we could plainly hear the reveille, and almost the Sergeant's voice calling the roll, while the answers of \"Here!\" were perfectly distinct. We could not possibly have been more than a mile, or a mile-and-a-half at the farthest, from the Stockade.  Our anxiety and mortification were doubled when at the usual hour--as we supposed--we heard the well-known and long-familiar sound of the hunter's horn, calling his hounds to their accustomed task of making the circuit of the Stockade, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not any \"Yankee\" had had the audacity to attempt an escape.  The hounds, anticipating, no doubt, this usual daily work, gave forth glad barks of joy at being thus called forth to duty.  We heard them start, as was usual, from about the railroad depot (as we imagined), but the sounds growing fainter and fainter gave us a little hope that our trail had been missed.  Only a short time, however, were we allowed this pleasant reflection, for ere long--it could not have been more than an hour--we could plainly see that they were drawing nearer and nearer.  They finally appeared so close that I advised the boys to climb a tree or sapling in order to keep the dogs from biting them, and to be ready to surrender when the hunters came up, hoping thus to experience as little misery as possible, and not dreaming but that we were caught.  On, on came the hounds, nearer and nearer still, till we imagined that we could see the undergrowth in the forest shaking by coming in contact with their bodies. Plainer and plainer came the sound of the hunter's voice urging them forward.  Our hearts were in our throats, and in the terrible excitement we wondered if it could be possible for Providence to so arrange it that the dogs would pass us.  This last thought, by some strange fancy, had taken possession of me, and I here frankly acknowledge that I believed it would happen.  Why I believed it, God only knows.  My excitement was so great, indeed, that I almost lost sight of our danger, and felt like shouting to the dogs myself, while I came near losing my hold on the tree in which I was hidden.  By chance I happened to look around at my nearest neighbor in distress.  His expression was sufficient to quell any enthusiasm I might have had, and I, too, became despondent.  In a very few minutes our suspense was over.  The dogs came within not less than three hundred yards of us, and we could even see one of them, God in Heaven can only imagine what great joy was then, brought to our aching hearts, for almost instantly upon coming into sight, the hounds struck off on a different trail, and passed us.  Their voices became fainter and fainter, until finally we could hear them no longer.  About noon, however, they were called back and taken to camp, but until that time not one of us left our position in the trees.  When we were satisfied that we were safe for the present, we descended to the ground to get what rest we could, in order to be prepared for the night's march, having previously agreed to travel at night and sleep in the day time.  \"Our Father, who art in Heaven,\" etc., were the first words that escaped my lips, and the first thoughts that came to my mind as I landed on terra firma.  Never before, or since, had I experienced such a profound reverence for Almighty God, for I firmly believe that only through some mighty invisible power were we at that time delivered from untold tortures.  Had we been found, we might have been torn and mutilated by the dogs, or, taken back to Andersonville, have suffered for days or perhaps weeks in the stocks or chain gang, as the humor of Wirz might have dictated at the time--either of which would have been almost certain death.  It was very fortunate for us that before our escape from Andersonville we were detailed at the cook-house, for by this means we were enabled to bring away enough food to live for several days without the necessity of theft.  Each one of us had our haversacks full of such small delicacies as it was possible for us to get when we started, these consisting of corn bread and fat bacon--nothing less, nothing more.  Yet we managed to subsist comfortably until our fourth day out, when we happened to come upon a sweet potato patch, the potatos in which had not been dug.  In a very short space of time we were all well supplied with this article, and lived on them raw during that day and the next night.  Just at evening, in going through a field, we suddenly came across three negro men, who at first sight of us showed signs of running, thinking, as they told us afterward, that we were the \"patrols.\"  After explaining to them who we were and our condition, they took us to a very quiet retreat in the woods, and two of them went off, stating that they would soon be back.  In a very short time they returned laden with well cooked provisions, which not only gave us a good supper, but supplied us for the next day with all that we wanted.  They then guided us on our way for several miles, and left us, after having refused compensation for what they had done.  We continued to travel in this way for"]]]
