In the excitement of action the rest of the boys shouted, and swore, and expressed their tense feelings in various ways, but Marriott might as well have been a graven image, for all the expression that he suffered to escape.  Doubtless, if the Captain had ordered him to shoot one of the company through the heart, he would have executed the command according to the manual of arms, brought his carbine to a \"recover,\" and at the word marched back to his quarters without an inquiry as to the cause of the proceedings.  He made no friends, and though his surliness repelled us, he made few enemies.  Indeed, he was rather a favorite, since he was a genuine character; his gruffness had no taint of selfish greed in it; he minded his own business strictly, and wanted others to do the same. When he first came into the company, it is true, he gained the enmity of nearly everybody in it, but an incident occurred which turned the tide in his favor.  Some annoying little depredations had been practiced on the boys, and it needed but a word of suspicion to inflame all their minds against the surly Englishman as the unknown perpetrator.  The feeling intensified, until about half of the company were in a mood to kill the Bugler outright.  As we were returning from stable duty one evening, some little occurrence fanned the smoldering anger into a fierce blaze; a couple of the smaller boys began an attack upon him; others hastened to their assistance, and soon half the company were engaged in the assault.  He succeeded in disengaging himself from his assailants, and, squaring himself off, said, defiantly:  \"Dom yer cowardly heyes; jest come hat me one hat a time, hand hI'll wollop the 'ole gang uv ye's.\"  One of our Sergeants styled himself proudly \"a Chicago rough,\" and was as vain of his pugilistic abilities as a small boy is of a father who plays in the band.  We all hated him cordially--even more than we did Marriott.  He thought this was a good time to show off, and forcing his way through the crowd, he said, vauntingly:  \"Just fall back and form a ring, boys, and see me polish off the---fool.\"  The ring was formed, with the Bugler and the Sergeant in the center. Though the latter was the younger and stronger the first round showed him that it would have profited him much more to have let Marriott's challenge pass unheeded.  As a rule, it is as well to ignore all invitations of this kind from Englishmen, and especially from those who, like Marriott, have served a term in the army, for they are likely to be so handy with their fists as to make the consequences of an acceptance more lively than desirable.  So the Sergeant found.  \"Marriott,\" as one of the spectators expressed it, \"went around him like a cooper around a barrel.\"  He planted his blows just where he wished, to the intense delight of the boys, who yelled enthusiastically whenever he got in \"a hot one,\" and their delight at seeing the Sergeant drubbed so thoroughly and artistically, worked an entire revolution in his favor.  Thenceforward we viewed his eccentricities with lenient eyes, and became rather proud of his bull-dog stolidity and surliness.  The whole battalion soon came to share this feeling, and everybody enjoyed hearing his deep-toned growl, which mischievous boys would incite by some petty annoyances deliberately designed for that purpose.  I will mention incidentally, that after his encounter with the Sergeant no one ever again volunteered to \"polish\" him off.  Andersonville did not improve either his temper or his communicativeness. He seemed to want to get as far away from the rest of us as possible, and took up his quarters in a remote corner of the Stockade, among utter strangers.  Those of us who wandered up in his neighborhood occasionally, to see how he was getting along, were received with such scant courtesy, that we did not hasten to repeat the visit.  At length, after none of us had seen him for weeks, we thought that comradeship demanded another visit.  We found him in the last stages of scurvy and diarrhea.  Chunks of uneaten corn bread lay by his head.  They were at least a week old. The rations since then had evidently been stolen from the helpless man by those around him.  The place where he lay was indescribably filthy, and his body was swarming with vermin.  Some good Samaritan had filled his little black oyster can with water, and placed it within his reach. For a week, at least, he had not been able to rise from the ground; he could barely reach for the water near him.  He gave us such a glare of recognition as I remembered to have seen light up the fast-darkening eyes of a savage old mastiff, that I and my boyish companions once found dying in the woods of disease and hurts.  Had he been able he would have driven us away, or at least assailed us with biting English epithets.  Thus he had doubtless driven away all those who had attempted to help him. We did what little we could, and staid with him until the next afternoon, when he died.  We prepared his body, in the customary way: folded the hands across his breast, tied the toes together, and carried it outside, not forgetting each of us, to bring back a load of wood.  The scarcity of mechanics of all kinds in the Confederacy, and the urgent needs of the people for many things which the war and the blockade prevented their obtaining, led to continual inducements being offered to the artizans among us to go outside and work at their trade.  Shoemakers seemed most in demand; next to these blacksmiths, machinists, molders and metal workers generally.  Not a week passed during my imprisonment that I did not see a Rebel emissary of some kind about the prison seeking to engage skilled workmen for some purpose or another.  While in Richmond the managers of the Tredegar Iron Works were brazen and persistent in their efforts to seduce what are termed \"malleable iron workers,\" to enter their employ.  A boy who was master of any one of the commoner trades had but to make his wishes known, and he would be allowed to go out on parole to work.  I was a printer, and I think that at least a dozen times I was approached by Rebel publishers with offers of a parole, and work at good prices.  One from Columbia, S. C., offered me two dollars and a half a \"thousand\" for composition.  As the highest price for such work that I had received before enlisting was thirty cents a thousand, this seemed a chance to accumulate untold wealth.  Since a man working in day time can set from thirty-five to fifty \"thousand\" a week, this would make weekly wages run from eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents to one hundred and twenty-five dollars--but it was in Confederate money, then worth from ten to twenty cents on the dollar.  Still better offers were made to iron workers of all kinds, to shoemakers, tanners, weavers, tailors, hatters, engineers, machinists, millers, railroad men, and similar tradesmen.  Any of these could have made a handsome thing by accepting the offers made them almost weekly. As nearly all in the prison had useful trades, it would have been of immense benefit to the Confederacy if they could have been induced to work at them.  There is no measuring the benefit it would have been to the Southern cause if all the hundreds of tanners and shoemakers in the Stockade could have, been persuaded to go outside and labor in providing leather and shoes for the almost shoeless people and soldiery.  The machinists alone could have done more good to the Southern Confederacy than one of our brigades was doing harm, by consenting to go to the railroad shops at Griswoldville and ply their handicraft.  The lack of material resources in the South was one of the strongest allies our arms had.  This lack of resources was primarily caused by a lack of skilled labor to develop those resources, and nowhere could there be found a finer collection of skilled laborers than in the thirty-three thousand prisoners incarcerated in Andersonville.  All solicitations to accept a parole and go outside to work at one's trade were treated with the scorn they deserved.  If any mechanic yielded to them, the fact did not come under my notice.  The usual reply to invitations of this kind was:  \"No, Sir!  By God, I'll stay in here till I rot, and the maggots carry me out through the cracks in the Stockade, before I'll so much as raise my little finger to help the infernal Confederacy, or Rebels, in any shape or form.\"  In August a Macon shoemaker came in to get some of his trade to go back with him to work in the Confederate shoe factory.  He prosecuted his search for these until he reached the center of the camp on the North Side, when some of the shoemakers who had gathered around him, apparently considering his propositions, seized him and threw him into a well. He was kept there a whole day, and only released when Wirz cut off the rations of the prison for that day, and announced that no more would be issued until the man was returned safe and sound to the gate.  The terrible crowding was somewhat ameliorated by the opening in July of an addition--six hundred feet long--to the North Side of the Stockade. This increased the room inside to twenty acres, giving about an acre to every one thousand seven hundred men,--a preposterously contracted area still.  The new ground was not a hotbed of virulent poison like the olds however, and those who moved on to it had that much in their favor.  The palisades between the new and the old portions of the pen were left standing when the new portion was opened.  We were still suffering a great deal of inconvenience from lack of wood.  That night the standing timbers were attacked by thousands of prisoners armed with every species of a tool to cut wood, from a case-knife to an ax.  They worked the live-long night with such energy that by morning not only every inch of the logs above ground had disappeared, but that below had been dug up, and there was not enough left of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4259"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons â€” Volume 3 (#5)"],["body","eight hundred foot wall of twenty-five-foot logs to make a box of matches.  One afternoon--early in August--one of the violent rain storms common to that section sprung up, and in a little while the water was falling in torrents.  The little creek running through the camp swelled up immensely, and swept out large gaps in the Stockade, both in the west and east sides.  The Rebels noticed the breaches as soon as the prisoners. Two guns were fired from the Star Tort, and all the guards rushed out, and formed so as to prevent any egress, if one was attempted.  Taken by surprise, we were not in a condition to profit by the opportunity until it was too late.  The storm did one good thing: it swept away a great deal of filth, and left the camp much more wholesome.  The foul stench rising from the camp made an excellent electrical conductor, and the lightning struck several times within one hundred feet of the prison.  Toward the end of August there happened what the religously inclined termed a Providential Dispensation.  The water in the Creek was indescribably bad.  No amount of familiarity with it, no increase of intimacy with our offensive surroundings, could lessen the disgust at the polluted water.  As I have said previously, before the stream entered the Stockade, it was rendered too filthy for any use by the contaminations from the camps of the guards, situated about a half-mile above. Immediately on entering the Stockade the contamination became terrible. The oozy seep at the bottom of the hillsides drained directly into it all the mass of filth from a population of thirty-three thousand.  Imagine the condition of an open sewer, passing through the heart of a city of that many people, and receiving all the offensive product of so dense a gathering into a shallow, sluggish stream, a yard wide and five inches deep, and heated by the burning rays of the sun in the thirty-second degree of latitude.  Imagine, if one can, without becoming sick at the stomach, all of these people having to wash in and drink of this foul flow.  There is not a scintilla of exaggeration in this statement.  That it is within the exact truth is demonstrable by the testimony of any man--Rebel or Union--who ever saw the inside of the Stockade at Andersonville.  I am quite content to have its truth--as well as that of any other statement made in this book--be determined by the evidence of any one, no matter how bitter his hatred of the Union, who had any personal knowledge of the condition of affairs at Andersonville.  No one can successfully deny that there were at least thirty-three thousand prisoners in the Stockade, and that the one shallow, narrow creek, which passed through the prison, was at once their main sewer and their source of supply of water for bathing, drinking and washing.  With these main facts admitted, the reader's common sense of natural consequences will furnish the rest of the details.  It is true that some of the more fortunate of us had wells; thanks to our own energy in overcoming extraordinary obstacles; no thanks to our gaolers for making the slightest effort to provide these necessities of life.  We dug the wells with case and pocket knives, and half canteens to a depth of from twenty to thirty feet, pulling up the dirt in pantaloons legs, and running continual risk of being smothered to death by the caving in of the unwalled sides.  Not only did the Rebels refuse to give us boards with which to wall the wells, and buckets for drawing the water, but they did all in their power to prevent us from digging the wells, and made continual forays to capture the digging tools, because the wells were frequently used as the starting places for tunnels. Professor Jones lays special stress on this tunnel feature in his testimony, which I have introduced in a previous chapter.  The great majority of the prisoners who went to the Creek for water, went as near as possible to the Dead Line on the West Side, where the Creek entered the Stockade, that they might get water with as little filth in it as possible.  In the crowds struggling there for their turn to take a dip, some one nearly every day got so close to the Dead Line as to arouse a suspicion in the guard's mind that he was touching it.  The suspicion was the unfortunate one's death warrant, and also its execution.  As the sluggish brain of the guard conceived it he leveled his gun; the distance to his victim was not over one hundred feet; he never failed his aim; the first warning the wretched prisoner got that he was suspected of transgressing a prison-rule was the charge of \"ball-and-buck\" that tore through his body.  It was lucky if he was, the only one of the group killed.  More wicked and unjustifiable murders never were committed than these almost daily assassinations at the Creek.  One morning the camp was astonished beyond measure to discover that during the night a large, bold spring had burst out on the North Side, about midway between the Swamp and the summit of the hill.  It poured out its grateful flood of pure, sweet water in an apparently exhaustless quantity.  To the many who looked in wonder upon it, it seemed as truly a heaven-wrought miracle as when Moses's enchanted rod smote the parched rock in Sinai's desert waste, and the living waters gushed forth.  The police took charge of the spring, and every one was compelled to take his regular turn in filling his vessel.  This was kept up during our whole stay in Andersonville, and every morning, shortly after daybreak, a thousand men could be seen standing in line, waiting their turns to fill their cans and cups with the precious liquid.  I am told by comrades who have revisited the Stockade of recent years, that the spring is yet running as when we left, and is held in most pious veneration by the negros of that vicinity, who still preserve the tradition of its miraculous origin, and ascribe to its water wonderful grace giving and healing properties, similar to those which pious Catholics believe exist in the holy water of the fountain at Lourdes.  I must confess that I do not think they are so very far from right. If I could believe that any water was sacred and thaumaturgic, it would be of that fountain which appeared so opportunely for the benefit of the perishing thousands of Andersonville.  And when I hear of people bringing water for baptismal purposes from the Jordan, I say in my heart, \"How much more would I value for myself and friends the administration of the chrismal sacrament with the diviner flow from that low sand-hill in Western Georgia.\"     CHAPTER XLVII.  \"SICK CALL,\" AND THE SCENES THAT ACCOMPANIED IT--MUSTERING THE LAME, HALT AND DISEASED AT THE SOUTH GATE--AN UNUSUALLY BAD CASE--GOING OUT TO THE HOSPITAL--ACCOMMODATION AND TREATMENT OF THE PATIENTS THERE--THE HORRIBLE SUFFERING IN THE GANGRENE WARD--BUNGLING AMPUTATIONS BY BLUNDERING PRACTITIONERS--AFFECTION BETWEEN A SAILOR AND HIS WARD --DEATH OF MY COMRADE.  Every morning after roll-call, thousands of sick gathered at the South Gate, where the doctors made some pretense of affording medical relief. The scene there reminded me of the illustrations in my Sunday-School lessons of that time when \"great multitudes came unto Him,\" by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, \"having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others.\"  Had the crowds worn the flouting robes of the East, the picture would have lacked nothing but the presence of the Son of Man to make it complete.  Here were the burning sands and parching sun; hither came scores of groups of three or four comrades, laboriously staggering under the weight of a blanket in which they had carried a disabled and dying friend from some distant part of the Stockade.  Beside them hobbled the scorbutics with swollen and distorted limbs, each more loathsome and nearer death than the lepers whom Christ's divine touch made whole.  Dozens, unable to walk, and having no comrades to carry them, crawled painfully along, with frequent stops, on their hands and knees.  Every form of intense physical suffering that it is possible for disease to induce in the human frame was visible at these daily parades of the sick of the prison.  As over three thousand (three thousand and seventy-six) died in August, there were probably twelve thousand dangerously sick at any given time daring the month; and a large part of these collected at the South Gate every morning.  Measurably-calloused as we had become by the daily sights of horror around us, we encountered spectacles in these gatherings which no amount of visible misery could accustom us to.  I remember one especially that burned itself deeply into my memory.  It was of a young man not over twenty-five, who a few weeks ago--his clothes looked comparatively new --had evidently been the picture of manly beauty and youthful vigor. He had had a well-knit, lithe form; dark curling hair fell over a forehead which had once been fair, and his eyes still showed that they had gleamed with a bold, adventurous spirit.  The red clover leaf on his cap showed that he belonged to the First Division of the Second Corps, the three chevrons on his arm that he was a Sergeant, and the stripe at his cuff that he was a veteran.  Some kind-hearted boys had found him in a miserable condition on the North Side, and carried him over in a blanket to where the doctors could see him.  He had but little clothing on, save his blouse and cap.  Ulcers of some kind had formed in his abdomen, and these were now masses of squirming worms.  It was so much worse than the usual forms of suffering, that quite a little crowd of compassionate spectators gathered around and expressed their pity. The sufferer turned to one who lay beside him with:  \"Comrade: If we were only under the old Stars and Stripes, we wouldn't care a G-d d--n for a few worms, would we?\"  This was not profane.  It was an utterance from the depths of a brave man's heart, couched in the strongest"]]]
