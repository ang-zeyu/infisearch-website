When he lighted the oil a hundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.  \"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors who wished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within this circle of light.  If they advised you well, and were in the right, they will not be injured in any way.  But if any advised you wrongly, the light will wither him.\"  The advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded them to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were scorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that of baked potatoes.  Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged from the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary to plant them at once.  \"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than any Sorcerer we have ever known.  As it is evident that my people have advised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful Garden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the Black Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them around.\"  The Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself that he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had gone both Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit, and Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them from such a fate.  For two or three days after this--if we call days the periods between sleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friends were not disturbed in any way.  They were even permitted to occupy the House of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to wander in the gardens in search of food.  Once they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and walking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest.  They saw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and twisting around like a nest of great snakes.  Everything the vines touched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have escaped being cast among them.  Whenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets from his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to amuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part of the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could.  They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where she lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.  The cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches and watched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.  \"Don't be rough!\" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the round, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyed the sport very greatly.  Suddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent, solemn-eyed Mangaboos.  Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered with sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, the kitten and the piglets.  \"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after being pricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way of the thorns.  The Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to the doorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they were driven from the room and out upon the street.  Here were more of the vegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightened creatures down the street.  Jim had to be careful not to step upon the tiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, while Eureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also tried to protect the pretty little things from injury. Slowly but steadily the heartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they had passed through the city and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to the mountain.  \"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape a thorn.  \"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which they threatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten.  \"If I were as big as you are, Jim, I'd fight these miserable turnip-roots!\"  \"What would you do?\" enquired Jim.  \"I'd kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs.\"  \"All right,\" said the horse; \"I'll do it.\"  An instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and kicked out his hind legs as hard as he could.  A dozen of them smashed together and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kicked again and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in all directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron heels.  Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and scratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many vegetable complexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse.  But the foes were too many to be repulsed for long.  They tired Jim and Eureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered with mashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at last and allow themselves to be driven to the mountain.     7.  Into the Black Pit and Out Again   When they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunk of deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme. Half way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond the point where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it.  The Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into this dark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them--for it seemed some of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hall--they began to pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that the prisoners could not get out again.  \"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim.  \"It will be about the end of our adventures, I guess.\"  \"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly, \"he would not see us suffer so.\"  \"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\" added Eureka.  \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go and tell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue.\"  The mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave a leap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the air.  The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up their thorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her.  Eureka, however, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount only about a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could go nearly two hundred feet.  So she ran along over their heads until she had left them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House of the Sorcerer.  There she entered in at Dorothy's window in the dome and aroused her from her sleep.  As soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the Wizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue of Jim and the piglets.  The Wizard carried his satchel, which was quite heavy, and Zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can. Dorothy's wicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and by good fortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he had taken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest.  So there was nothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held close to her bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still beating rapidly.  Some of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House of the Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable people allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in a crowd behind them so that they could not go back again.  Before long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos, headed by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks before the entrance.  \"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at once began pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets.  Instead of opposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a good-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they all sprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns.  Dorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb and the Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad to follow her.  At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass again, and as the little man realized that they were all about to be entombed in the mountain he said to the children:  \"My dears, what shall we do?  Jump out and fight?\"  \"What's the use?\" replied Dorothy.  \"I'd as soon die here as live much longer among these cruel and heartless people.\"  \"That's the way I feel about it,\" remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds. \"I've had enough of the Mangaboos.\"  \"All right,\" said the Wizard; \"I'm with you, whatever you decide.  But we can't live long in this cavern, that's certain.\"  Noticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets, patted each one lovingly on its fat little head, and placed them carefully in his inside pocket.  Zeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns.  The rays of the colored suns were now shut out from them forever, for the last chinks had been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the Land of the Mangaboos.  \"How big is this hole?\" asked Dorothy.  \"I'll explore it and see,\" replied the boy.  So he carried the lantern back for quite a distance, while Dorothy and the Wizard followed at his side.  The cavern did not come to an end, as they had expected it would, but slanted upward through the great glass mountain, running in a direction that promised to lead them to the side opposite the Mangaboo country.  \"It isn't a bad road,\" observed the Wizard, \"and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],["title","Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#8)"],["body"," if we followed it it might lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black pocket we are now in.  I suppose the vegetable folk were always afraid to enter this cavern because it is dark; but we have our lanterns to light the way, so I propose that we start out and discover where this tunnel in the mountain leads to.\"  The others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once the boy began to harness Jim to the buggy.  When all was in readiness the three took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along the way, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted lantern so the horse could see where to go.  Sometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed the sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor was usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any accident.  Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather steep and tiresome.  \"We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns, by this time,\" said Dorothy.  \"I didn't know this mountain was so tall.\"  \"We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos,\" added Zeb; \"for we have slanted away from it ever since we started.\"  But they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out with his long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out the lanterns to save the oil.  To their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, for all were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, had made their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays.  The sides of the tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, and the floor became more level.  Jim hastened his lagging steps at this assurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few moments more they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to face with a new and charming country.     8.  The Valley of Voices   By journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful valley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another rugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and pretty green hills at the ends.  It was all laid out into lovely lawns and gardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful and stately trees dotting the landscape here and there.  There were orchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our world.  Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their flower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of the quaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld. None of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each had ample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it.  As the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enraptured by its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, which they breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel.  Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed two very singular and unusual facts about this valley. One was that it was lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in the arched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear and perfect light.  The second and even more singular fact was the absence of any inhabitant of this splendid place.  From their elevated position they could overlook the entire valley, but not a single moving object could they see.  All appeared mysteriously deserted.  The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to granite.  With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over the loose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths and orchards and gardens began.  The nearest cottage was still some distance away.  \"Isn't it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she sprang out of the buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass.  \"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb.  \"We were lucky to get away from those dreadful vegetable people.\"  \"It wouldn't be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if we were obliged to live here always.  We couldn't find a prettier place, I'm sure.\"  He took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, and Jim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very contented in his new surroundings.  \"We can't walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried it and failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and the Wizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth then they had been in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike and natural.  \"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy.  The little man shook his bald head.  \"Can't imagine, my dear,\" he replied.  They heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find the creature anywhere.  Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearest cottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausing at every step for another mouthful of grass.  Presently they came to a low plant which had broad, spreading leaves, in the center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach. The fruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so appetizing and delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:  \"What is it, do you s'pose?\"  The piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl could reach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had rushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness.  \"It's good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn't have gobbled it up so greedily.\"  \"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment.  They all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared.  \"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away.  But I didn't see them go; did you?\"  \"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together.  \"Here,--piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously.  Several squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but the Wizard could not discover a single piglet.  \"Where are you?\" he asked.  \"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice.  \"Can't you see us?\"  \"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone.  \"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets.  The Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the small fat body of one of his pets.  He picked it up, but could not see what he held.  \"It is very strange,\" said he, soberly.  \"The piglets have become invisible, in some curious way.\"  \"I'll bet it's because they ate that peach!\" cried the kitten.  \"It wasn't a peach, Eureka,\" said Dorothy.  \"I only hope it wasn't poison.\"  \"It was fine, Dorothy,\" called one of the piglets.  \"We'll eat all we can find of them,\" said another.  \"But WE mus'n't eat them,\" the Wizard warned the children, \"or we too may become invisible, and lose each other. If we come across another of the strange fruit we must avoid it.\"  Calling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and put them away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he could feel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe for the present.  The travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which they presently reached.  It was a pretty place, with vines growing thickly over the broad front porch.  The door stood open and a table was set in the front room, with four chairs drawn up to it.  On the table were plates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits.  The meat was smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics and jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way.  But not a single person appeared to be in the room.  \"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood in the doorway.  A peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell to the plates with a clatter.  One of the chairs pushed back from the table, and this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almost tempted to run away in fright.  \"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of some unseen person.  \"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly.  \"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent.  \"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room?\"  \"Of course,\" replied the man's voice.  \"And--pardon me for the foolish question--but, are you all invisible?\"  \"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rippling laughter. \"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe?\"  \"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard.  \"All the people I have ever met before were very plain to see.\"  \"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone.  \"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"but recently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in the Country of the Mangaboos.\"  \"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman's voice.  \"I've heard of them.\"  \"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we found there was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here.  It is a beautiful place.  What do you call it?\"  \"It is the Valley of Voe.\"  \"Thank you.  We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to this house to enquire our way.\"  \"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman's voice.  \"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy.  \"So could I,\" added Zeb.  \"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened to say.  \"That's all right,\" returned the man's voice, more pleasantly than before.  \"You are welcome to what we have.\"  As he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm. Two childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was sure they were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if those folks couldn't be seen.  \"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn?\" enquired the man's voice.  \"That's Jim,\" said the girl.  \"He's a horse.\" "]]]
