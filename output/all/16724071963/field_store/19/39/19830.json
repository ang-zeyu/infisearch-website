There is no man who can get as much speed out of a mule as a teamster falling back from the neighborhood of heavy firing.  This nervous tremor was not peculiar to the engineers of our transportation department.  It was noticeable in the gentry who carted the scanty provisions of the Rebels.  One of Wheeler's cavalrymen told me that the brigade to which he belonged was one evening ordered to move at daybreak.  The night was rainy, and it was thought best to discharge the guns and reload before starting.  Unfortunately, it was neglected to inform the teamsters of this, and at the first discharge they varnished from the scene with such energy that it was over a week before the brigade succeeded in getting them back again.  Why association with the mule should thus demoralize a man, has always been a puzzle to me, for while the mule, as Col. Ingersoll has remarked, is an animal without pride of ancestry or hope of posterity, he is still not a coward by any means.  It is beyond dispute that a full-grown and active lioness once attacked a mule in the grounds of the Cincinnati Zoological Garden, and was ignominiously beaten, receiving injuries from which she died shortly afterward.  The apparition of a badly-scared teamster urging one of his wheel mules at break-neck speed over the rough ground, yelling for protection against \"them Johnnies,\" who had appeared on some hilltop in sight of where he was gathering corn, was an almost hourly occurrence.  Of course the squad dispatched to his assistance found nobody.  Still, there were plenty of Rebels in the country, and they hung around our front, exchanging shots with us at long taw, and occasionally treating us to a volley at close range, from some favorable point. But we had the decided advantage of them at this game.  Our Sharpe's carbines were much superior in every way to their Enfields.  They would shoot much farther, and a great deal more rapidly, so that the Virginians were not long in discovering that they were losing more than they gained in this useless warfare.  Once they played a sharp practical joke upon us.  Copper River is a deep, exceedingly rapid mountain stream, with a very slippery rocky bottom. The Rebels blockaded a ford in such a way that it was almost impossible for a horse to keep his feet.  Then they tolled us off in pursuit of a small party to this ford.  When we came to it there was a light line of skirmishers on the opposite bank, who popped away at us industriously. Our boys formed in line, gave the customary, cheer, and dashed in to carry the ford at a charge.  As they did so at least one-half of the horses went down as if they were shot, and rolled over their riders in the swift running, ice-cold waters.  The Rebels yelled a triumphant laugh, as they galloped away, and the laugh was re-echoed by our fellows, who were as quick to see the joke as the other side.  We tried to get even with them by a sharp chase, but we gave it up after a few miles, without having taken any prisoners.  But, after all, there was much to make our sojourn in the Valley endurable.  Though we did not wear fine linen, we fared sumptuously--for soldiers--every day.  The cavalryman is always charged by the infantry and artillery with having a finer and surer scent for the good things in the country than any other man in the service.  He is believed to have an instinct that will unfailingly lead him, in the dankest night, to the roosting place of the most desirable poultry, and after he has camped in a neighborhood for awhile it would require a close chemical analysis to find a trace of ham.  We did our best to sustain the reputation of our arm of the service. We found the most delicious hams packed away in the ash-houses. They were small, and had that; exquisite nutty flavor, peculiar to mast-fed bacon.  Then there was an abundance of the delightful little apple known as \"romanites.\"  There were turnips, pumpkins, cabbages, potatoes, and the usual products of the field in plenty, even profusion. The corn in the fields furnished an ample supply of breadstuff.  We carried it to and ground it in the quaintest, rudest little mills that can be imagined outside of the primitive affairs by which the women of Arabia coarsely powder the grain for the family meal.  Sometimes the mill would consist only of four stout posts thrust into the ground at the edge of some stream.  A line of boulders reaching diagonally across the stream answered for a dam, by diverting a portion of the volume of water to a channel at the side, where it moved a clumsily constructed wheel, that turned two small stones, not larger than good-sized grindstones.  Over this would be a shed made by resting poles in forked posts stuck into the ground, and covering these with clapboards held in place by large flat stones.  They resembled the mills of the gods--in grinding slowly. It used to seem that a healthy man could eat the meal faster than they ground it.  But what savory meals we used to concoct around the campfires, out of the rich materials collected during the day's ride!  Such stews, such soups, such broils, such wonderful commixtures of things diverse in nature and antagonistic in properties such daring culinary experiments in combining materials never before attempted to be combined.  The French say of untasteful arrangement of hues in dress \"that the colors swear at each other.\"  I have often thought the same thing of the heterogeneities that go to make up a soldier's pot-a feu.  But for all that they never failed to taste deliciously after a long day's ride.  They were washed down by a tincupful of coffee strong enough to tan leather, then came a brier-wood pipeful of fragrant kinnikinnic, and a seat by the ruddy, sparkling fire of aromatic cedar logs, that diffused at once warmth, and spicy, pleasing incense.  A chat over the events of the day, and the prospect of the morrow, the wonderful merits of each man's horse, and the disgusting irregularities of the mails from home, lasted until the silver-voiced bugle rang out the sweet, mournful tattoo of the Regulations, to the flowing cadences of which the boys had arranged the absurdly incongruous words:            \"S-a-y--D-e-u-t-c-h-e-r-will-you fight-mit Sigel!           Zwei-glass of lager-bier, ja! ja! JA!\"  Words were fitted to all the calls, which generally bore some relativeness to the sigmal, but these were as, destitute of congruity as of sense.  Tattoo always produces an impression of extreme loneliness.  As its weird, half-availing notes ring out and are answered back from the distant rocks shrouded in night, and perhaps concealing the lurking foe, the soldier remembers that he is far away from home and friends--deep in the enemy's country, encompassed on every hand by those in deadly hostility to him, who are perhaps even then maturing the preparations for his destruction.  As the tattoo sounds, the boys arise from around the fire, visit the horse line, see that their horses are securely tied, rub off from the fetlocks and legs such specks of mud as may have escaped the cleaning in the early evening, and if possible, smuggle their faithful four-footed friends a few ears of corn, or another bunch of hay.  If not too tired, and everything else is favorable, the cavalryman has prepared himself a comfortable couch for the night.  He always sleeps with a chum.  The two have gathered enough small tufts of pine or cedar to make a comfortable, springy, mattress-like foundation.  On this is laid the poncho or rubber blanket.  Next comes one of their overcoats, and upon this they lie, covering themselves with the two blankets and the other overcoat, their feet towards the fire, their boots at the foot, and their belts, with revolver, saber and carbine, at the sides of the bed. It is surprising what an amount of comfort a man can get out of such a couch, and how, at an alarm, he springs from it, almost instantly dressed and armed.  Half an hour after tattoo the bugle rings out another sadly sweet strain, that hath a dying sound.     CHAPTER IV.  A BITTER COLD MORNING AND A WARM AWAKENING--TROUBLE ALL ALONG THE LINE --FIERCE CONFLICTS, ASSAULTS AND DEFENSE--PROLONGED AND DESPERATE STRUGGLE ENDING WITH A SURRENDER.  The night had been the most intensely cold that the country had known for many years.  Peach and other tender trees had been killed by the frosty rigor, and sentinels had been frozen to death in our neighborhood.  The deep snow on which we made our beds, the icy covering of the streams near us, the limbs of the trees above us, had been cracking with loud noises all night, from the bitter cold.  We were camped around Jonesville, each of the four companies lying on one of the roads leading from the town.  Company L lay about a mile from the Court House.  On a knoll at the end of the village toward us, and at a point where two roads separated,--one of which led to us,--stood a three-inch Rodman rifle, belonging to the Twenty-second Ohio Battery. It and its squad of eighteen men, under command of Lieutenant Alger and Sergeant Davis, had been sent up to us a few days before from the Gap.  The comfortless gray dawn was crawling sluggishly over the mountain-tops, as if numb as the animal and vegetable life which had been shrinking all the long hours under the fierce chill.  The Major's bugler had saluted the morn with the lively, ringing tarr-r-r-a-ta-ara of the Regulation reveille, and the company buglers, as fast as they could thaw out their mouth-pieces, were answering him.  I lay on my bed, dreading to get up, and yet not anxious to lie still. It was a question which would be the more uncomfortable.  I turned over, to see if there was not another position in which it would be warmer, and began wishing for the thousandth time that the efforts for the amelioration of the horrors of warfare would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4257"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons â€” Volume 1 (#5)"],["body","to such a point as to put a stop to all Winter soldiering, so that a fellow could go home as soon as cold weather began, sit around a comfortable stove in a country store; and tell camp stories until the Spring was far enough advanced to let him go back to the front wearing a straw hat and a linen duster.  Then I began wondering how much longer I would dare lie there, before the Orderly Sergeant would draw me out by the heels, and accompany the operation with numerous unkind and sulphurous remarks.  This cogitation, was abruptly terminated by hearing an excited shout from the Captain:  \"Turn Out!--COMPANY L!!  TURNOUT !  !  !\"  Almost at the same instant rose that shrill, piercing Rebel yell, which one who has once heard it rarely forgets, and this was followed by a crashing volley from apparently a regiment of rifles.  I arose-promptly.  There was evidently something of more interest on hand than the weather.  Cap, overcoat, boots and revolver belt went on, and eyes opened at about the same instant.  As I snatched up my carbine, I looked out in front, and the whole woods appeared to be full of Rebels, rushing toward us, all yelling and some firing.  My Captain and First Lieutenant had taken up position on the right front of the tents, and part of the boys were running up to form a line alongside them.  The Second Lieutenant had stationed himself on a knoll on the left front, and about a third of the company was rallying around him.  My chum was a silent, sententious sort of a chap, and as we ran forward to the Captain's line, he remarked earnestly:  \"Well: this beats hell!\"  I thought he had a clear idea of the situation.  All this occupied an inappreciably short space of time.  The Rebels had not stopped to reload, but were rushing impetuously toward us.  We gave them a hot, rolling volley from our carbines.  Many fell, more stopped to load and reply, but the mass surged straight forward at us.  Then our fire grew so deadly that they showed a disposition to cover themselves behind the rocks and trees.  Again they were urged forward; and a body of them headed by their Colonel, mounted on a white horse, pushed forward through the gap between us and the Second Lieutenant.  The Rebel Colonel dashed up to the Second Lieutenant, and ordered him to surrender.  The latter-a gallant old graybeard--cursed the Rebel bitterly and snapped his now empty revolver in his face.  The Colonel fired and killed him, whereupon his squad, with two of its Sergeants killed and half its numbers on the ground, surrendered.  The Rebels in our front and flank pressed us with equal closeness. It seemed as if it was absolutely impossible to check their rush for an instant, and as we saw the fate of our companions the Captain gave the word for every man to look out for himself.  We ran back a little distance, sprang over the fence into the fields, and rushed toward Town, the Rebels encouraging us to make good time by a sharp fire into our backs from the fence.  While we were vainly attempting to stem the onset of the column dashed against us, better success was secured elsewhere.  Another column swept down the other road, upon which there was only an outlying picket.  This had to come back on the run before the overwhelming numbers, and the Rebels galloped straight for the three-inch Rodman.  Company M was the first to get saddled and mounted, and now came up at a steady, swinging gallop, in two platoons, saber and revolver in hand, and led by two Sergeants-Key and McWright,--printer boys from Bloomington, Illinois. They divined the object of the Rebel dash, and strained every nerve to reach the gun first.  The Rebels were too near, and got the gun and turned it.  Before they could fire it, Company M struck them headlong, but they took the terrible impact without flinching, and for a few minutes there was fierce hand-to-hand work, with sword and pistol. The Rebel leader sank under a half-dozen simultaneous wounds, and fell dead almost under the gun.  Men dropped from their horses each instant, and the riderless steeds fled away.  The scale of victory was turned by the Major dashing against the Rebel left flank at the head of Company I, and a portion of the artillery squad.  The Rebels gave ground slowly, and were packed into a dense mass in the lane up which they had charged. After they had been crowded back, say fifty yards, word was passed through our men to open to the right and left on the sides of the road. The artillerymen had turned the gun and loaded it with a solid shot. Instantly a wide lane opened through our ranks; the man with the lanyard drew the fatal cord, fire burst from the primer and the muzzle, the long gun sprang up and recoiled, and there seemed to be a demoniac yell in its ear-splitting crash, as the heavy ball left the mouth, and tore its bloody way through the bodies of the struggling mass of men and horses.  This ended it.  The Rebels gave way in disorder, and our men fell back to give the gun an opportunity to throw shell and canister.  The Rebels now saw that we were not to be run over like a field of cornstalks, and they fell back to devise further tactics, giving us a breathing spell to get ourselves in shape for defense.  The dullest could see that we were in a desperate situation.  Critical positions were no new experience to us, as they never are to a cavalry command after a few months in the field, but, though the pitcher goes often to the well, it is broken at last, and our time was evidently at hand.  The narrow throat of the Valley, through which lay the road back to the Gap, was held by a force of Rebels evidently much superior to our own, and strongly posted.  The road was a slender, tortuous one, winding through rocks and gorges.  Nowhere was there room enough to move with even a platoon front against the enemy, and this precluded all chances of cutting out.  The best we could do was a slow, difficult movement, in column of fours, and this would have been suicide.  On the other side of the Town the Rebels were massed stronger, while to the right and left rose the steep mountain sides.  We were caught-trapped as surely as a rat ever was in a wire trap.  As we learned afterwards, a whole division of cavalry, under command of the noted Rebel, Major General Sam Jones, had been sent to effect our capture, to offset in a measure Longstreet's repulse at Knoxville. A gross overestimate of our numbers had caused the sending of so large a force on this errand, and the rough treatment we gave the two columns that attacked us first confirmed the Rebel General's ideas of our strength, and led him to adopt cautious tactics, instead of crushing us out speedily, by a determined advance of all parts of his encircling lines.  The lull in the fight did not last long.  A portion of the Rebel line on the east rushed forward to gain a more commanding position.  We concentrated in that direction and drove it back, the Rodman assisting with a couple of well-aimed shells.--This was followed by a similar but more successful attempt by another part of the Rebel line, and so it went on all day--the Rebels rushing up first on this side, and then on that, and we, hastily collecting at the exposed points, seeking to drive them back.  We were frequently successful; we were on the inside, and had the advantage of the short interior lines, so that our few men and our breech-loaders told to a good purpose.  There were frequent crises in the struggle, that at some times gave encouragement, but never hope.  Once a determined onset was made from the East, and was met by the equally determined resistance of nearly our whole force.  Our fire was so galling that a large number of our foes crowded into a house on a knoll, and making loopholes in its walls, began replying to us pretty sharply.  We sent word to our faithful artillerists, who trained the gun upon the house.  The first shell screamed over the roof, and burst harmlessly beyond.  We suspended fire to watch the next.  It crashed through the side; for an instant all was deathly still; we thought it had gone on through.  Then came a roar and a crash; the clapboards flew off the roof, and smoke poured out; panic-stricken Rebels rushed from the doors and sprang from the windows --like bees from a disturbed hive; the shell had burst among the confined mass of men inside!  We afterwards heard that twenty-five were killed there.  At another time a considerable force of rebels gained the cover of a fence in easy range of our main force.  Companies L and K were ordered to charge forward on foot and dislodge them.  Away we went, under a fire that seemed to drop a man at every step.  A hundred yards in front of the Rebels was a little cover, and behind this our men lay down as if by one impulse.  Then came a close, desperate duel at short range.  It was a question between Northern pluck and Southern courage, as to which could stand the most punishment.  Lying as flat as possible on the crusted snow, only raising the head or body enough to load and aim, the men on both sides, with their teeth set, their glaring eyes fastened on the foe, their nerves as tense as tightly-drawn steel wires, rained shot on each other as fast as excited hands could crowd cartridges into the guns and discharge them.  Not a word was said.  The shallower enthusiasm that expresses itself in oaths and shouts had given way to the deep, voiceless rage of men in a death grapple.  The Rebel line was a rolling torrent of flame, their bullets shrieked angrily as they flew past, they struck the snow in front of us, and threw its cold flakes in faces that were white with the fires of consuming hate; they buried themselves with a dull thud in the quivering bodies of the enraged combatants.  Minutes passed; they seemed hours.  Would the villains, scoundrels, hell-hounds, sons of vipers never go?  At length a few Rebels sprang up and tried to fly.  They were shot down instantly.  Then the whole line rose and ran!  The relief"]]]
