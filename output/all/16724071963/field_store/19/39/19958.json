Hunger is the poor man's curse!  (_The father appears at the window, and during the following he comes into the room in a very happy mood, with a basket on his back._)      'Tisn't much that we require,     just a little food and fire!     But alas! it's true enough,     life on some of us is rough!     Hunger is a customer tough! (_or_)     Yes, the rich enjoys his dinner,     while the poor grows daily thinner!     Strives to eat, as well he may,     somewhat less than yesterday!  (_Complainingly._)            Tralala, tralala!     hunger is the devil to pay!           Tralala, tralala!     hunger is the devil to pay!  (_He puts down his basket._)      Yes, hunger's all very well to feel,     if you can get a good square meal;     but when there's nought, what can you do,     supposing the purse be empty too?           Tralalala, tralalala!     O for a drop of mountain dew!           Tralalala, tralalala!     Mother, look what I have brought!  (Reels over to his sleeping wife and gives her a smacking kiss.)  MOTHER (_rubbing her eyes_).          Oho!--         Who's sing-sing-singing         all around the house,         and tra-la-la-ing me         out of my sleep?  FATHER (_inarticulately_).          How now!--         The hungry beast         within my breast         called so for food         I could not rest!         Tralala, tralala!         Hunger is an urgent beast!         Tralala, tralala!         pinches, gnaws, and gives no rest!  MOTHER.          So, so!         And this wild beast,         you gave him a feast.         He's had his fill,         to say the least!  FATHER.      Well, yes! H'm! it was a lovely day,     don't you think so, dear wife?  (_Wants to kiss her._)  MOTHER  (_pushing him angrily away, excitedly_).      Have done! You have no troubles to bear,     'tis I must keep the house!  FATHER.      Well, well,--then let us see, my dear,     what we have got to eat to-day.  MOTHER.      Most simple is the bill of fare,     our supper's gone, I know not where!     Larder bare, cellar bare,     nothing, and plenty of it to spare!  FATHER.            Tralalala, tralalala!     Cheer up, mother, for here am I,     bringing luck and jollity!  (_He takes his basket and begins to display he contents._)      Look, mother, doesn't all this food please you?  MOTHER.      Man, man, what see I?     Ham and butter,     flour and sausage--     eggs, a dozen....     (Husband, and they cost a fortune!)     Turnips, onions, and--for me!     Nearly half a pound of tea!  BOTH.          Tralala, tralala,         hip hurrah!         Won't we have a festive time!         Tralala, hip hurrah!         Won't we have a happy time!     Now listen how it all came about!  FATHER  (_turns the basket topsy-turvy, and a lot of potatoes roll out. He seizes her by the arm and dances round the room. Sits down. Meanwhile the mother packs away the things, lights a fire, breaks eggs into a saucepan, etc._).      Yonder to the town I went,     there was to be a great event,     weddings, fairs, and preparation     for all kinds of jubilation!     Now's my chance to do some selling,     and for that you may be thankful!     He who wants a feast to keep,     he must scrub and brush and sweep.     So I brought my best goods out,     tramped with them from house to house:     \"Buy besoms! good besoms!     Buy my brushes! sweep your carpets,     sweep your cobwebs!\"     And so I drove a roaring trade,     and sold my brushes at the highest prices!     Now make haste with cup and platter,     bring the glasses, bring the kettle--     here's a health to the besom-maker!  MOTHER.      Here's a health to the besom-maker!  FATHER.      But stay, why, where are the children?     H舅sel, Gretel, what's gone with Hans?  MOTHER.      Gone with Hans? O, who's to know?     But at least I do know this,     that the jug is smashed to bits.  FATHER.      What! the jug is smashed to bits?  MOTHER.      And the cream all run away.  FATHER  (_striking his fist on the table in a rage_).      Hang it all! So those little scapegraces     have been again in mischief!  MOTHER (_hastily_).      Been in mischief? I should think so!     Nought have they done but their mad pranking;     as I came home I could hear them     hopping and cutting the wildest capers,     till I was so cross that I gave a push--     and the jug of milk was spilt!  FATHER.      And the jug of milk was spilt!     Ha ha ha ha!  (_Both laughing._)      Such anger, mother, don't take it ill,     seems stupid to me, I must say!     But where, where think you the children can be?  MOTHER (_snappishly and curtly_).      For aught I know, at the Ilsenstein!  FATHER (_horror-struck_).      The Ilsenstein! Come, come, have a care!  (_Fetches a broom from the wall._)  MOTHER.      The besom, just put it away again!  FATHER  (_lets the broom fall and wrings his hands_).      My children astray in the gloomy wood,     all alone without moon or stars!  MOTHER.      O Heaven!  FATHER.      Dost thou not know the awful magic place,     the place where the evil one dwells?  MOTHER (_surprised_).      The evil one! What mean'st thou?  FATHER (_with mysterious emphasis_).      The gobbling ogress!  (_The mother draws back, the father takes up the broom again._)  MOTHER.      The gobbling ogress!     But--tell me, what help is the besom!  FATHER.      The besom, the besom, why what is it for?     They ride on it, they ride on it, the witches!     An old witch within that wood doth dwell     and she's in league with the powers of hell.     At midnight hour, when nobody knows,     away to the witches' dance she goes.         Up the chimney they fly,         on a broomstick they hie--         over hill and dale,         o'er ravine and vale,         through the midnight air         they gallop full tear--         on a broomstick, on a broomstick,         hop hop, hop hop, the witches!  MOTHER.      O horror!     But the gobbling witch?  FATHER.      And by day, they say, she stalks around,     with a crinching, crunching, munching sound,     and children plump and tender to eat     she lures with magic gingerbread sweet.         On evil bent,         with fell intent,     she lures the children, poor little things,         in the oven red-hot         she pops all the lot;         she shuts the lid down         until they're done brown,         in the oven, in the oven,     (_Expressively._)         the gingerbread children!  MOTHER.      And the gingerbread children?  FATHER.      Are served up for dinner!  MOTHER.      For the ogress?  FATHER.      For the ogress!  MOTHER.      O horror!     Heav'n help us! the children!     O what shall we do?  (_Runs out of the house._)  FATHER.      Hi, mother, mother, wait for me!  (_Takes the whisky bottle from the table and follows her._)      We'll both go together the witch to seek!  (_The curtain falls quickly._)     ACT II.  IN THE FOREST.   Scene I.  (_The curtain rises. The middle of the forest. In the background is the Ilsenstein, thickly surrounded by fir-trees. On the right is a large fir-tree, under which Gretel is sitting on a mossy tree-trunk and making a garland of wild roses. By her side lies a nosegay of flowers. Amongst the bushes on the left is H舅sel, looking for strawberries. Sunset._)  GRETEL (_humming quietly to herself_).      There stands a little man in the wood alone,     he wears a little mantle of velvet brown.     Say, who can the mankin be,     standing there beneath the tree,     with the little mantle of velvet brown?     His hair is all of gold, and his cheeks are red,     he wears a little black cap upon his head.     Say, who can the mankin be,     standing there so silently,     with the little black cap upon his head?  (_She holds up the garland of roses, and looks it all round._)      With the little black cap upon his head!  HﾄNSEL  (_comes out, swinging his basket joyfully_).      Hurrah! my strawberry basket is nearly brimful!     O won't the mother be pleased with H舅sel!  GRETEL (_standing up_).      My garland is ready also!     Look! I never made one so nice before!  (_Tries to put the wreath on H舅sel's head._)  HﾄNSEL (_drawing back roughly_).      You won't catch a boy wearing that!     It is only fit for a girl!  (_Puts the wreath on her._)      Ha, Gretel! \"Fine feathers!\"     O the deuce!     You shall be the queen of the wood!  GRETEL.      If I am to be queen of the wood,     then I must have the nosegay too!  HﾄNSEL (_gives her the nosegay_).      Queen of the wood, with sceptre and crown,     I give you the strawberries,     but don't eat them all!  (_He gives the basket full of strawberries into her other hand, at the same time kneeling before her in homage. At this moment the cuckoo is heard._)      Cuckoo, cuckoo, how d'you do?  GRETEL.      Cuckoo, cuckoo, where are you?  (_Takes a strawberry from the basket and pokes it into H舅sel's mouth; he sucks it up as though he were drinking an egg._)  HﾄNSEL (_jumping up_).      Oho, I can do that just like you!  (_Takes some strawberries and lets them fall into Gretel's mouth._)      Let us do like the cuckoo too,     who takes what doesn't belong to him!  (_It begins to grow dark._)  HﾄNSEL (_helping himself again_).      Cuckoo, how are you?  GRETEL.      Cuckoo, where are you?  HﾄNSEL.      In your neighbour's nest you go.  GRETEL (_helping herself_).      Cuckoo, cuckoo!  HﾄNSEL.      Cuckoo, why do you do so?  (_Pours a handful of strawberries into his mouth._)  GRETEL.      And you are very greedy too!     Tell me, cuckoo, why are you?  HﾄNSEL.      Cuckoo, cuckoo!  (_They get rude and begin to quarrel for the strawberries. H舅sel gains the victory, and puts the whole basket to his mouth until it is empty._)  GRETEL  (_horrified, clasping her hands together_).      H舅sel, what have you done?

HﾄNSEL (_quietly_).      Now come, don't make such a fuss;     you, Gretel, you did the same thing yourself!  GRETEL.      Come, we'll hurry and seek for fresh ones!  HﾄNSEL.      What, here in the dark, under hedges and bushes?     Why, naught can we see of fruit or leaves!     It's getting dark already here!  GRETEL.      O H舅sel! O H舅sel! O what shall we do?     What bad disobedient children we've been!     We ought to have thought and gone home sooner!  (_Cuckoo behind the scenes, rather nearer than before._)  HﾄNSEL.      Hark, what a noise in the bushes!     Know you what the forest says?     \"Children, children,\" it says,     \"Are you not afraid?\"  (_H舅sel spies all around uneasily, at last he turns in despair to Gretel._)      Gretel, I cannot find the way!  GRETEL (_dismayed_).      O God! what say you?     Not know the way?  HﾄNSEL  (_pretending to be very brave_).      Why, how ridiculous you are!     I am a boy, and know not fear!  GRETEL.      O H舅sel, some dreadful thing may come!  HﾄNSEL.      O Gretel, come, don't be afraid!  GRETEL.      What's glimmering there in the darkness?  HﾄNSEL.      That's only the birches in silver dress.

But what a dreadful form it takes,     and what a horrid face it makes!  HﾄNSEL (_very loud_).      Come, I'll make faces, you fellow!     D'you hear?  GRETEL (_terrified_).      There, see! a lantern,     it's coming this way!  HﾄNSEL.      Will-o'-the-wisp is hopping about--     Gretel, come, don't lose heart like this!     Wait, I'll give a good loud call!

ECHO.      Where?     Here!  GRETEL (_softly_).      Did you hear? a voice said, \"Here!\"     H舅sel, surely some one's near.

See, how they nod and beckon, beckon!     They're coming, they're coming,     they'll take us away!

I wonder who the mankin is?  (_At this moment the mist lifts on the left; a little grey man is seen with a little sack on his back._)   Scene II.  SANDMAN (_the Sleep Fairy_).  (_The little man approaches the children with friendly gestures, and the children gradually calm down. He is strewing sand in the children's eyes._)      I shut the children's peepers, sh!     and guard the little sleepers, sh!     for dearly do I love them, sh!     and gladly watch above them, sh!     And with my little bag of sand,     By every child's bedside I stand;     then little tired eyelids close,     and little limbs have sweet repose.     And if they're good and quickly go to sleep,     then from the starry sphere above     the angels come with peace and love,     and send the children happy dreams,     while watch they keep!     Then slumber, children, slumber,     for happy dreams are sent you     through the hours you sleep.  (_Disappears. Darkness._)  HﾄNSEL (_half asleep_).      Sandman was there!  GRETEL (_ditto_).      Let us first say our evening prayer.  (_They cower down and fold their hands._)  BOTH.          When at night I go to sleep,         fourteen angels watch do keep:         two my head are guarding,         two my feet are guiding,         two are on my right hand,         two are on my left hand,         two who warmly cover,         two who o'er me hover,         two to whom 'tis given         to guide my steps to Heaven.  (_They sink down on to the moss, and go to sleep with their arms twined round each other. Complete darkness._)   Scene III.  (_Here a bright light suddenly breaks through the mist which forthwith rolls itself together into the form of a staircase, vanishing in perspective, in the middle of the stage. Fourteen angels, in light floating garments, pass down the staircase, two and two, at intervals, while it is getting gradually lighter. The angels place themselves, according to the order mentioned in the evening hymn, around the sleeping children; the first couple at their heads, the second at their feet, the third on the right, the fourth on the left, the fifth and sixth couples distribute themselves amongst the other couples, so that the circle of the angels is completed. Lastly the seventh couple comes into the circle and takes its place as \"guardian angels\" on each side of the children. The remaining angels now join hands and dance a stately step around the group. The whole stage is filled with an intense light. Whilst the angels arrange themselves in a picturesque tableau, the curtain slowly falls._)     ACT III.  THE WITCH'S HOUSE.   Scene I.  (_The curtain rises. Scene the same as the end of Act II. The background is still hidden in mist, which gradually rises during the following. The angels have vanished. Morning is breaking. The Dawn Fairy steps forward and shakes dewdrops from a bluebell over the sleeping children._)  DEWMAN (_Dawn Fairy_).      I'm up with early dawning,     and know who loves the morning,     who'll rise fresh as a daisy,     who'll sink in slumber lazy!     Ding! dong! ding! dong!     And with the golden light of day     I chase the fading night away,     fresh dew around me shaking,     and hill and dale awaking.     Then up, with all your powers     enjoy the morning hours,     the scent of trees and flowers--     then up, ye sleepers, awaken!     The rosy dawn is smiling,     then up, ye sleepers, awake, awake!  (_Hurries off singing. The children begin to stir. Gretel rubs her eyes, looks around her, and raises herself a little, whilst H舅sel turns over on the other side to go to sleep again._)  GRETEL.      Where am I? Waking? Or do I dream?     How come I in the wood to lie?     High in the branches I hear a gentle twittering,     birds are beginning to sing so sweetly;     from early dawn they are all awake,     and warble their morning hymn of praise.     Dear little singers, little singers,     good morning!     (_Turns to H舅sel._)     See there, the sleepy lazybones?     Wait now, I'll wake him!     Tirelireli, it's getting late!     Tirelireli, it's getting late!     The lark his flight is winging,     on high his matin singing,     Tirelireli! tirelireli!  HﾄNSEL  (_suddenly jumps up with a start_).      Kikeriki! it's early yet!     Kikeriki! it's early yet!     Yes, the day is dawning;     awake, for it is morning!     Kikeriki! kikeriki!     I feel so well, I know not why!     I never slept so well, no, not I!  GRETEL.      But listen, Hans; here 'neath the tree     a wondrous dream was sent to me!  HﾄNSEL (_meditatively_).      Really! I, too, had a dream!  GRETEL.      I fancied I heard a murmuring and rushing,     as though the angels in Heav'n were singing;     rosy clouds above me were floating--     hovering and floating in the distance away,     Sudden--all around a light was streaming,     rays of glory from Heaven beaming,     and a golden ladder saw I descending,     angels adown it gliding,     such lovely angels with shining golden wings.  HﾄNSEL (_interrupting her quickly_).      Fourteen angels there must have been!  GRETEL (_astonished_).      And did you also behold all this?  HﾄNSEL.      Truly, 'twas wondrous fair!     And upward I saw them float.  (_He turns towards the background; at this moment the last remains of the mist clear away. In place of the fir-trees is seen the \"Witch's house at the Ilsenstein,\" shining in the rays of the rising sun. A little distance off, to the left, is an oven; opposite this, on the right, a large cage, both joined to the Witch's house by a fence of gingerbread figures._)   Scene II.  GRETEL  (_holds H舅sel back in astonishment_).      Stand still, be still!  HﾄNSEL (_surprised_).      O Heaven, what wondrous place is this,     as ne'er in all my life have I seen!  GRETEL  (_gradually regains her self-possession_).          What odor delicious!         O say, do I dream?  BOTH.          A cottage all made         of chocolate cream.         The roof is all covered         with Turkish delight         the windows with lustre         of sugar are white;         and on all the gables         the raisins invite,         and think! all around         is a gingerbread hedge!         O magic castle,         how nice you'd be to eat!         Where hides the princess         who has so great a treat?         Ah, could she but visit         our little cottage bare,         she'd ask us to dinner,         her dainties to share!  HﾄNSEL (_after a while_).      No sound do I hear; no, nothing is stirring!     Come, let's go inside it!  GRETEL  (_pulling him back horrified_).      Are you senseless?     H舅sel, however can you make so bold?     Who knows who may live there,     in that lovely house?  HﾄNSEL.      O look, do look how the house seems to smile!     (_Enthusiastically._)     Ah, the angels did our footsteps beguile!  GRETEL (_reflectively_).      The angels? Yes, it must be so!  HﾄNSEL.      Yes, Gretel, the angels are beck'ning us in!     Come, let's nibble a bit of the cottage.  BOTH.      Come, let's nibble it,     like two mice persevering!  (_They hop along, hand in hand, towards the back of the stage; then stand still, and then steal along cautiously on tiptoe to the house. After some hesitation H舅sel breaks off a bit of cake from the right-hand corner._)   Scene III.  A VOICE FROM"]]]
