Alas, he could only eat his soup and gaze about him at all the activities that were going on in camp. When at last it was time for them to go, it was with the greatest difficulty that Pierre could be torn away from his new-found friends.  \"Come again, old pal,\" said the tall man, slapping Pierre cordially on the back as he said good-by. \"Come again and see your Uncle Sam! Come and bring your family!\"  Pierre grinned, although he did not understand a word, shook hands, and ran down the river-bank to join his parents and Pierrette, who were already climbing into the boat.  \"Jim\" and \"Uncle Sam\" looked after them as the Ark swung out into the stream. \"Au revoir,\" shouted Pierre, waving his hand. \"Vive la France!\" And back came the reply like an echo, \"You bet your life, vive la France!\"    X. FONTANELLE  The shadows were beginning to lengthen across the valley as the Ark rounded a bend in the stream and the little church spire of Fontanelle came into view. \"There it is--at last!\" cried Mother Meraut. \"Thank God, something of the village still stands!\" She gazed eagerly into the distance. \"And there is the Chateau,\" she added joyfully, pointing to a large gray stone building half hidden by a fringe of trees. \"Oh, surely things are not going to be so bad as I had feared. Hurry! hurry! It seems as though my heart must take wings and fly before my body, now that we are so near!\"  Father Meraut bent to the oars. \"I will stay with the boat while you and the children go to the village,\" he said, when, a few moments later, he found a favorable spot to land.  Mother Meraut was out of the boat almost before it was beached, the Twins sprang out after her, and the three started up the road to the village on a run. Groves of trees just bursting into leaf lay between them and the one street of the little town, and it was not until they had passed it that they could tell how much damage had been done. The sight that met their eyes as they entered the village was not reassuring, but, hoping against hope, they ran on to the little house which had been Mother Meraut's childhood home. At the threshold they paused, and the tears which Mother Meraut had resolutely refused to shed when she had said good-by to her own home in Rheims fell freely as she gazed upon the ruins of the home of her parents. The house was empty, the windows were gone, the door was wrenched from its hinges, and the roof was open to the sky. The whole village was in much the same condition. Every house was empty, the street deserted.  Neither Mother Meraut nor the Twins said a word. With heavy hearts they turned from the gaping doorway and started toward the Chateau, which lay half a mile beyond the village. Not a soul did they meet until they arrived at the great gate which marked the entrance to the park, and then they saw that the Chateau too had suffered. It had been partly burned out, but as its walls were standing and one wing looked habitable, their spirits rose a little. At the gate a child was playing. They stopped. \"Can you tell me, ma petite,\" said Mother Meraut, her voice trembling, \"whether there is any one here by the name of Jamart?\"  \"Mais--oui,\" answered the child, surveying the strangers with curiosity. \"Voila!\" She pointed a stubby finger toward the Chateau, and there, just disappearing behind a corner of the wall, was the bent figure of an old woman carrying a pail of water.  With a cry of joy, Mother Meraut sprang forward, and Pierre and Pierrette for once in their lives, run as they would, could not keep up with her. She fairly flew over the ground, and when the Twins at last reached her side, the pail of water was spilled on the ground, and the two women were weeping in each other's arms. An old man now came toward them and the children flung themselves upon him. \"Grandpere! Grandpere!\" they shouted, and then such another embracing as there was!  Grand'mere kissed the Twins, and Grandpere hugged Mother Meraut, and then, because the tears were still running down their cheeks, Grandpere pointed to the overturned pail, and the water flowing in little wiggling streams through the dust. \"Come, dear hearts,\" he cried, \"are these your tears? Weep no more, then, lest we have a flood after our fire! This is a time to rejoice! Wipe your eyes, my Antoinette, and tell us how you came here. It is as if the sky had opened to let down three angels--and where, then, is Jacques?\"  By this time a group of people had gathered about them--the little remnant of the old prosperous village of Fontanelle. \"Here we are, you see,\" said Grandpere, \"all that are left of us. Every able-bodied young woman was driven away by the Germans to work in their fields--while ours lie idle. Every able-bodied man is in the army. There are only twenty-seven of us left--old women, children, and myself. There you have our history.\"  Mother Meraut shook each old friend by the hand, looked at all the babies and children, and proudly showed her Twins to them in return, before she said a word about the sorrows they had endured in Rheims, and the desperation which had at last driven them from their home. The people listened without comment. They had all suffered so much that there was no room left in their hearts for new grief, but when she told them of the boat and her lame husband they rejoiced with her that she had the happiness at least of a united family. There was plenty of room in their hearts for joy! \"Come with us,\" they said. \"We cannot be poorer. Our cattle are driven away; we have no strong laborers to till our fields, no seeds to plant in them. We live in one wing and the outhouses of the Chateau, but hope is not yet dead, and your hands are strong. Your husband, too, can help, and we shall be at least no worse off for your being here.\"  Grand'mere spoke. \"We live in the cow-stalls of the stable,\" said she. \"It is not so bad; there is still hay in the loft, and there are other stalls not occupied.\"  Mother Meraut crossed herself. \"If the Blessed Mother of Our Lord could live in a stable,\" she said, \"such shelter is surely good enough for us.\"  Father Meraut, sitting patiently in the boat, was surprise, a little later as he looked anxiously toward the village, to see a crowd of people coming toward him, waving caps and hands in salutation. Before the others ran Pierre and Pierrette, and when they reached him they poured forth a jumble of excited words, from which he was able to gather that Grandpere and Grand'mere were alive and well, and that there was a place for them to stay. He got out of the boat to greet the people, and their willing hands took the bundles and helped hide the Ark in the bushes, and the whole company then started back to the Chateau, Grandpere lingering behind the others to keep pace with the slow progress of Father Meraut.  When Grand'mere, the Twins, and their Mother reached the stable they took their bundles from the hands of their friends, and went in to inspect their new home. The stable had been swept and scrubbed until it was as clean as it could be made. The large box stall served as a bedroom for Grand'mere and Grandpere. Above their bed of hay, covered with old blankets and quilts, was hung a wooden crucifix. This, with two boxes for seats, was all the furniture it contained. A few articles of clothing hung about on nails, and in the open space before the stalls a stove was placed, the pipe running through a pane of glass in a window near by.  When Grandpere and Father Meraut arrived, Mother Meraut met them at the door. \"Behold our new apartment!\" she said, and she led her husband to one of the clean stalls, where she had already begun to set up housekeeping. The Twins were at that moment in the loft overhead, getting hay for their beds, and Jacqueline, exhausted by her journey, had been put to bed in the manger.  Father Meraut looked about. \"This is not bad for the summer,\" he said, \"and who knows what good luck may come to us by fall? Perhaps the Germans will be driven out of France by that time, and surely we shall be able to do some planting even now.\"  \"We have dug up the ground for gardens as best we could with the few tools we have,\" said Grandpere. \"The government would send us seeds, but the roads are very bad, and we have no horses, and supplies are hard to get even though we have money to pay for them. The nearest town where provisions can be obtained lies six miles below, at the mouth of the river, and it is very little one can carry on one's back.\"  \"Is there no way to get help from the soldiers' camp?\" asked Father Meraut. \"They must get supplies.\"  \"Yes, but they cannot of themselves at this time take care of the civilian population,\" said Grandpere. \"There are many villages in the same condition, and the soldiers' business is to fight for France.\"  \"True,\" said Father Meraut. Then he exclaimed: \"I have it! The Ark! It will indeed be our salvation as it was Father Noah's.\"  Grandpere looked anxiously at Mother Meraut and touched his forehead. \"He is not mad?\" he asked.  She laughed. \"The name of our boat is the Ark,\" she explained. \"We can use it to go down the river to buy provisions if there are any to be had.\"  Grand'mere, who had been listening, looked cautiously about, then felt under the straw of her bed and brought out a stocking. \"See!\" she said. \"I have money. The others have money too, but of what use is money when there is nothing to buy and no place to buy it?\"  \"We must find a place to buy things,\" said Mother Meraut with decision. \"Grandpere and Jacques can take the Ark and go down the river on a voyage of discovery, and bring back the supplies that we most need.\"  After supper the whole village gathered about the stable door to hear all the news which the Meraut family had brought from the outside world. For months they had not seen a newspaper, and there had been no visitors in Fontanelle.

I know space is a dimension and you can move forward or back in space. And, of course, you keep on aging all the time.\"  \"Elementary,\" I said.  \"But what happens if you can move backward or forward in time? Do you age or get younger, or do you keep the status quo?\"  \"I'm not an authority on time, Tex. Do you know anyone who traveled in time?\"  Harrigan shrugged aside my question. \"That was the thing I couldn't get out of Vanderkamp, either. He presumed to know everything else.\"  \"Vanderkamp?\"  \"He was another of those strange people a reporter always runs into. Lived in New York--downtown, near the Bowery. Man of about forty, I'd say, but a little on the old-fashioned side. Dutch background, and hipped on the subject of New Amsterdam, which, in case you don't know, was the original name of New York City.\"  \"Don't mind my interrupting,\" I cut in. \"But I'm not quite straight on what Vanderkamp has to do with time as dimension.\"  \"Oh, he was touched on the subject. He claimed to travel in it. The fact is, he invented a time-traveling machine.\"  \"You certainly meet the whacks, Tex!\"  \"Don't I!\" He grinned appreciatively and leaned reminiscently over the bar. \"But Vanderkamp had the wildest dreams of the lot. And in the end he managed the neatest conjuring trick of them all. I was on the Brooklyn _Enterprise_ at that time; I spent about a year there. Special features, though I was on a reporter's salary. Vanderkamp was something of a local celebrity in a minor way; he wrote articles on the early Dutch in New York, the nomenclature of the Dutch, the history of Dutch place-names, and the like. He was handy with a pen, and even handier with tools. He was an amateur electrician, carpenter, house-painter, and claimed to be an expert in genealogy.\"  \"And he built a time-traveling machine?\"  \"So he said. He gave me a rather hard time of it. He was a glib talker and half the time I didn't know whether I was coming or going. He kept me on my toes by taking for granted that I accepted his basic premises. I got next to him on a tip. He could be close-mouthed as a clam, but his sister let things slip from time to time, and on this occasion she passed the word to one of her friends in a grocery store that her brother had invented a machine that took him off on trips into the past. It seemed like routine whack stuff, but Blake, who decided what went into the _Enterprise_ and what didn't, sent me over to Manhattan to get something for the paper, on the theory that since Vanderkamp was well-known in Brooklyn, it was good neighborhood copy.  \"Vanderkamp was a sharp-eyed little fellow, about five feet or so in height, and I hit him at a good time. His sister said he had just come back from a trip--she left me to draw my own conclusions about what kind of trip--and I found him in a mild fit of temper. He was too upset, in fact, to be truculent, which was more like his nature.  \"Was it true, I wanted to know, that he'd invented a machine that traveled in time?  \"He didn't make any bones about it. 'Certainly,' he said. 'I've been using it for the last month, and if my sister hadn't decided to blab nobody would know about it yet. What about it?'  \"'You believe it can take you backwards or forwards into the past or the future?'  \"'Do I look crazy? I said so, didn't I?'  \"Now, as a matter of fact, he _did_ look crazy. Unlike most of the candidates for my file of queer people, Vanderkamp actually looked like a nut. He had a wild eye and a constantly working mouth; he blinked a good deal and stammered when he was excited. In features he was as Dutch as his name implied. Well, we talked back and forth for some time, but I stuck with him and in the end he took me out into a shed adjoining his house and showed me the contraption he'd built.  \"It looked like a top. The first thing I thought of was Brick Bradford, and before I could catch myself, I'd asked, 'Is that pure Brick Bradford?'  \"He didn't turn a hair. 'Not by a long shot,' he answered. 'H. G. Wells was there first. I owe it to Wells.'  \"'I see,' I said.  \"'The hell you do!' he shot back. 'You think I'm as nutty as a fruit-cake.'  \"'The idea of time travel is a little hard to swallow,' I said.  \"'Sure it is. But me, I'm doing it. So that's all there is to it.'  \"'If you don't mind, Mr. Vanderkamp,' I said, 'I'm a dummy in scientific matters. I have all I can do to tell a nut from a bolt.'  \"'That I believe,' he said.  \"'So how do you time travel?'  \"'Look,' he said, 'time is a dimension like space. You can go up or down this ruler,' he snatched a steel ruler and waved it in front of me, 'from any given point. But you move. In the dimension of time, you only seem to move. You stand still; time moves. Do you get it?'  \"I had to confess that I didn't.  \"He tried again, with obviously strained patience. Judging by what I could gather from what he said, it was possible for him--so he believed--to get into his machine, twirl a few knobs, push a few buttons, relax for any given period, and end up just where he liked--back in the past, or ahead in the future. But wherever he ended up, he was still in this same spot. In other words, whether he was back in 1492 or ahead in 2092, the place he got out of his time machine was still his present address.  \"It was beyond me, frankly, but I figured that as long as he was a little touched, it wouldn't do any harm to humor him. I intimated that I understood and asked him where he'd been last.  \"His face fell, his brow clouded, and he said, 'I've been ahead thirty years.' He shook his head angrily. 'What a time! I'll be seventy, and you won't even be that, Mr. Harrigan. But we'll be in the middle of the worst atomic war you ever dreamed about.'  \"Now this was before Hiroshima, quite a bit. I didn't know what he was talking about, but it gives me a queer feeling now and then when I think of what he said, especially since it's still short of thirty years since that time.  \"'It's no time to be living here,' he went on. 'Direct hits on the entire area. What would you do?'  \"'I'd get out,' I said.  \"'That's what I thought,' he said. 'But that kind of warfare carries a long way. A long way. And I'm a man who loves his comforts, reasonably. I don't intend to set up housekeeping in equatorial Africa or the forests of Brazil.'  \"'What did you see thirty years from now, Mr. Vanderkamp?' I asked him.  \"'Everything blown to hell,' he answered. 'Not a building in all Manhattan.' He leered and added, 'And everybody who'll be living here at that time will be scattered into the atmosphere in fragments no bigger than an amoeba.'  \"'You fill me with anticipation,' I said.  \"So I went back to my desk and wrote the story. You could guess what kind it had to be. 'Time Travel Is Possible, Says Amateur Scientist!'--that kind of thing. You can see it every week, in large doses, in the feature sections of some of the biggest chain papers. It went over like an average feature about life on the moon or prehistoric animals surviving in remote mountain valleys, or what have you. Just what Vanderkamp went back to after I left, I don't know, but I have an idea that he gave his sister a devil of a time.\"         *       *       *       *       *  _Vanderkamp stalked into the house and confronted his sister._  _\"You see, Julie--a reporter. Can't you learn to hold your tongue?\"_  _She threw him a scornful glance. \"What difference does it make?\" she cried. \"You're gone all the time.\"_  _\"Maybe I'll take you along sometime. Just wait.\"_  _\"Wait, wait! That's all I've been doing. Since I was ten years old I've been waiting on you!\"_  _\"Oh, the hell with it!\" He turned on his heel and left the house._  _She followed him to the door and shouted after him, \"Where are you going now?\"_  _\"To New Amsterdam for a little peace and quiet,\" he said testily._  _He threw open the thick-walled door of his time-machine and pulled it shut behind him. He sat down before the controls and began to chart his course for 1650. If his calculations were correct, he would shortly find himself in the vicinity of that sturdy if autocratic first citizen of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam, Peter Stuyvesant, as well as Governor Stuyvesant's friend and neighbor, Heinrich Vanderkamp. He gave not even a figurative glance over his shoulder before he started out._  _When he emerged at last from his machine, he was in what appeared to be the backyard of a modest residence on a street which, though he did not know it, he suspected might be the Bouwerie. At the moment of his emergence, a tall, angular woman stood viewing him, open-mouthed and aghast, from the wooden stoop at the back door of her home. He looked at her in astonishment himself. The resemblance to his sister Julie was uncanny._  _With only the slightest hesitation, he addressed her in fluent Dutch. \"Pray do not be disturbed, young lady.\"_  _\"A fine way for a gentleman to call!\" she exclaimed in a voice considerably more forceful than her appearance. \"I suppose my father sent you. And where did you get that outlandish costume?\"_  _\"I bought it,\" he answered, truthfully enough._  _\"A likely tale,\" she said. \"And if my father sent you, just go back and tell him I'm satisfied the way I am. No woman needs a man to manage her.\"_  _\"I don't have the honor of your father's acquaintance,\" he answered._  _She gazed at him suspiciously from narrowed eyes. \"Everyone in New Amsterdam knows Henrik Van Tromp. He's as unloved as yonder bumblebee."]]]
