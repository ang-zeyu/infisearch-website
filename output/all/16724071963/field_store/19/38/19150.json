Each carried a gun under his arm, and a well-bred Irish water-spaniel followed close upon their heels. They were of about the same age, though it would have been apparent, even to the most casual observer, that they stood to one another in the relation of master to man.  The one, Henry Urquhart, home for his holidays from Eton, was the nephew of Mr. Langton, the retired West African judge, who owned Friar’s Court. The other was Jim Braid, the son of Mr. Langton’s head-gamekeeper, who had already donned the corduroys and the moleskin waistcoat of his father’s trade.  Though to some extent a social gap divided them, a friendship had already sprung up between these two which was destined to ripen as the years went on, carrying both to the uttermost parts of the world, through the forests of the Cameroons, across the inhospitable hills west of the Cameroon Peak, even to the great plains of the Sahara.  Harry was a boy of the open air.  He was never happier than when on horseback, or when he carried a shot-gun and a pocketful of cartridges. As for Jim, he was no rider, but there were few boys of his age who could hit a bolting rabbit or a rocketing pheasant with such surety of aim.  The Judge himself was much given to study, and was said to be a recognized authority on the primitive races of Africa and the East. For hours at a time he would shut himself up in the little bungalow he had built in the woods, where, undisturbed, he could carry out his researches.  He was fond of his nephew, not the less so because Harry was a boy well able to amuse himself; and where there were rabbits to be shot and ditches to be jumped, young Urquhart was in his element.  In Jim Braid, the schoolboy found one who had kindred tastes, who was a better shot than himself, who could manage ferrets, and who, on one occasion, had even had the privilege of assisting his father in the capture of a poacher.  Constant companionship engendered a friendship which in time grew into feelings of mutual admiration.  In the young gamekeeper’s eyes Harry was all that a gentleman should be; whereas the schoolboy knew that in Jim Braid he had found a companion after his heart.  The path they followed led them past the bungalow.  As they drew near they saw there was a light in the window, and within was Mr. Langton, a tall, grey-haired man, who sat at his writing-desk, poring over his books and papers.  \"My uncle works too hard,\" said Harry.  \"For the last week he has done nothing else.  Every morning he has left the house directly after breakfast to come here.  I think there’s something on his mind; he seldom speaks at meals.\"  \"I suppose,\" said Braid, \"in a big estate like this there must be a good deal of business to be done?\"  \"I don’t think that takes him much time,\" said the other.  \"He keeps his accounts and his cashbox in the bungalow, it is true, but he is much more interested in the ancient histories of India and Asia than in Friar’s Court.  He’s a member of the Royal Society, you know, and that’s a very great honour.\"  \"He’s a fine gentleman!\" said Braid, as if that clinched the matter once and for all.  They walked on in silence for some minutes, and presently came to the drive.  It was then that they heard the sound of the wheels of a dog-cart driving towards the house.  \"That’s Captain von Hardenberg,\" said Braid.  \"I expect so,\" said the other.  \"His train must have been late. There’ll be three of us to shoot to-morrow.\"  Braid did not answer.  Harry glanced at him quickly.  \"You don’t seem pleased,\" he said.  \"To tell the truth, sir,\" said Braid, after a brief pause, \"I’m not. Captain von Hardenberg and I don’t get on very well together.\"  \"How’s that?\"  Jim hesitated.  \"I hardly like to say, sir,\" said he, after a pause.  \"I don’t mind,\" said Harry.  \"To tell the truth, my cousin and I have never been friends.  I can’t think whatever possessed an aunt of mine to marry a German—and a Prussian at that.  He’s a military attaché, you know, at the German Embassy in London.\"  The dog-cart came into sight round a bend in the drive.  They stepped aside to let it pass.  There was just sufficient light to enable them to see clearly the features of the young man who was seated by the side of the coachman.  He was about twenty-three years of age, with a very dark and somewhat sallow complexion, sharp, aquiline features, and piercing eyes.  Upon his upper lip was a small, black moustache.  He wore a heavy ulster, into the pockets of which his hands were thrust.  \"Well, sir,\" said Jim, when the dog-cart had passed, \"we’ve had a good time together, what with shooting and the ferrets, but I’m afraid it’s all ended, now that the captain’s come.\"  \"Ended!\" said Harry.  \"Why should it be ended?\"  \"Because I can never be the same with that gentleman as I am with you. Last time he was here he struck me.\"  \"Struck you!  What for?\"  \"There was a shooting-party at the Court,\" the young gamekeeper went on, \"and I was helping my father.  A pheasant broke covert midway between Captain von Hardenberg and another gentleman, and they both fired.  Both claimed the bird, and appealed to me.  I knew the captain had fired first and missed, and I told him so.  He said nothing at the time, though he got very red in the face.  That evening he came up to me and asked me what I meant by it.  I said I had spoken the truth, and he told me not to be insolent.  I don’t know what I said to that, sir; but, at any rate, he struck me.  I clenched my fists, and as near as a touch did I knock him down.  I remembered in time that he was the Judge’s nephew, the same as yourself, and I’d lose my place if I did it.  So I just jammed both my fists in my trousers pockets, and walked away, holding myself in, as it were, and cursing my luck.\"  \"You did right, Jim,\" said the other, after a pause.  \"You deserve to be congratulated.\"  \"It was pretty difficult,\" Braid added.  \"I could have knocked him into a cocked hat, and near as a touch I did it.\"  \"Though he’s my cousin,\" said Harry, \"I’m afraid he’s a bad lot.  He’s very unpopular in the diplomatic club in London to which he belongs. When I went back to school last term I happened to travel in the same carriage as two men who had known him well in Germany, and who talked about him the whole way.  It appears that he’s sowing his wild oats right and left, that he’s always gambling and is already heavily in debt.\"  \"I fancy,\" said Braid, \"that a gamekeeper soon learns to know a rogue when he sees one.  You see, sir, we’re always after foxes or poachers or weasels; and the first time as ever I set eyes on Captain von Hardenberg, I said to myself: ’That man’s one of them that try to live by their wits.’\"  \"I think,\" said Harry, \"we had better talk about something else.  In point of fact, Jim, I had no right to discuss my cousin at all.  But I was carried away by my feelings when you told me he had struck you.\"  \"I understand, sir,\" said the young gamekeeper, with a nod.  \"At all events, we must make the best of him.  We’re to have him here for a month.\"  \"As long as he doesn’t cross my path,\" said Jim Braid, \"I’ll not meddle with him.\"  Soon after that they parted, Harry going towards the house, Jim taking the path that led to his father’s cottage.  In the hall Harry found his cousin, who had already taken off his hat and overcoat, and was now seated before a roaring fire, with a cigarette in one hand and an empty wine glass in the other.  \"Hallo!\" said von Hardenberg, who spoke English perfectly.  \"Didn’t know I was to have the pleasure of your company."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39185"],["title","Across the Cameroons: A Story of War and Adventure (#1)"],["body","’s my uncle?\"  \"In the bungalow,\" said Harry.  \"During the last few days he’s been extremely hard at work.\"  \"How do you like school?\" asked the young Prussian.  His manner was particularly domineering.  With his sleek, black hair, carefully parted in the middle, and his neatly trimmed moustache, he had the appearance of a very superior person.  Moreover, he did not attempt to disguise the fact that he looked upon his schoolboy cousin barely with toleration, if not with actual contempt.  \"I like it tremendously!\" said Harry, brightening up at once.  \"I suppose you know I got into the Cricket Eleven, and took four wickets against Harrow?\"  He said this with frank, boyish enthusiasm.  There was nothing boastful about it.  Von Hardenberg, raising his eyebrows, flicked some cigarette-ash from his trousers.  \"_Himmel!_\" he observed.  \"You don’t suppose I take the least interest in what you do against Harrow.  The whole of your nation appears to think of nothing but play.  As for us Germans, we have something better to think of!\"  Harry looked at his cousin.  For a moment a spirit of mischief rose within him, and he had half a mind to ask whether von Hardenberg had forgotten his gambling debts.  However, he thought better of it, and went upstairs to dress for dinner.  The Judge came late from the bungalow, bursting into the dining-room as his two nephews were seating themselves at the table, saying that he had no time to change.  \"Boys,\" he cried, rubbing his hands together, \"I’ve made the greatest discovery of my life!  I’ve hit upon a thing that will set the whole world talking for a month!  I’ve discovered the Sunstone!  I’ve solved its mystery!  As you, Carl, would say, the whole thing’s _colossal_!\"  \"The Sunstone!\" cried Harry.  \"What is that?\"  \"The Sunstone,\" said the Judge, \"has been known to exist for centuries. It is the key to the storehouse of one of the greatest treasures the world contains.  It has been in my possession for nine years, and not till this evening did I dream that I possessed it.\"  \"Come!\" cried Harry.  \"You must tell us all about it!\"     CHAPTER II—The Sunstone   \"Well,\" said the Judge, pushing aside the plate of soup which he had hardly tasted, \"I don’t know whether or not the story will interest you. It ought to, because it’s romantic, and also melodramatic—that is to say, it is concerned with death.  It came into my possession nine years ago, when I was presiding judge at Sierra Leone.  I remember being informed by the police that a native from the region of Lake Chad had come into the country with several Arabs on his track.  He had fled for his life from the hills; he had gone as far south as the Congo, and had then cut back on his tracks; and all this time, over thousands of miles of almost impenetrable country, the Arabs—slave-traders by repute—had clung to his heels like bloodhounds.  In Sierra Leone he turned upon his tormentors and killed two of them.  He was brought before me on a charge of murder, and I had no option but to sentence him to death.  The day before he was hanged he wished to see me, and I visited him in prison. He gave into my hands a large, circular piece of jade, and I have kept it ever since, always looking upon it merely as a curiosity and a memento of a very unpleasant duty.  Never for a moment did I dream it was the Sunstone itself.  \"Now, before you can understand the whole story, you must know something of Zoroaster.  Zoroaster was the preacher, or prophet, who was responsible for the most ancient religion in the world.  He was the first of the Magi, or the Wise Men of the East, and it was he who framed the famous laws of the Medes and Persians.  He is supposed to have lived more than six thousand years before Christ.  \"The doctrine of Zoroaster is concerned with the worship of the sun; hence the name of the Sunstone.  This religion was adopted by the Persians, who conquered Egypt, and thus spread their influence across the Red Sea into Africa.  To-day, among the hills that surround Lake Chad, there exists a tribe of which little is known, except that they are called the Maziris, and are believed still to follow the religion of Zoroaster.  \"In the days when Zoroaster preached, it was the custom of his followers and admirers to present the sage with jewels and precious stones.  These were first given as alms, to enable him to live; but, as his fame extended, the treasure became so great that it far exceeded his needs.  \"One rumour has it that Zoroaster died in the Himalayas; another that his body was embalmed in Egypt and conveyed by a party of Ethiopians into the very heart of the Dark Continent, where it was buried in a cave with all his treasure.  \"The Sunstone is referred to by many ancient Persian writers.  I have known of it for years as the key to the treasure of Zoroaster.  As I have said, it is a circular piece of jade, bright yellow in colour, and of about the size of a saucer.  On both sides of the stone various signs and symbols have been cut.  On one side, from the centre, nine radii divide the circumference into nine equal arcs.  In each arc is a distinct cuneiform character, similar to those which have been found upon the stone monuments of Persia and Arabia.  \"The Arabs are in many ways the most wonderful people in the world. Their vitality as a race is amazing.  For centuries—possibly for thousands of years—they have terrorized northern and central Africa. They were feared by the ancient Egyptians, who built walls around their cities to protect them from the Bedouins—the ancestors of the men who to-day lead their caravans to Erzerum, Zanzibar, and Timbuctoo.  \"So far as I can discover, the Maziris are an Arab tribe who have given up their old nomad life.  Somewhere in the Maziri country is a group of caves which no European has ever entered.  They are known as the ’Caves of Zoroaster’, for it is here that the sage is supposed to have been buried.  The bones of Zoroaster, as well as the jewels, are said to lie in a vault cut in the living rock; and the Sunstone is the key which opens the entrance to that vault.  The man, whom in my capacity as a judge I was obliged to sentence to death, had no doubt stolen it, and had been pursued across the continent by the Maziri chieftains, who desired to recover the Sunstone.  \"There is the whole story.  A week ago I came across a description of the Sunstone in the writings of a Persian historian, and that description led me to suspect that the very thing was in my own possession.  I followed up clue after clue, and this evening I put the matter beyond all doubt.\"  Mr. Langton’s two nephews had listened in breathless interest.  Harry was leaning forward with his elbows on the table and his chin upon a hand.  Von Hardenberg lay back in a chair, his arms folded, his dark eyes fixed upon his uncle.  \"Then,\" said he, \"you have but to get into these so-called ’Caves of Zoroaster’ to possess yourself of the jewels?\"  The Judge smiled, and shook his head.  \"And to get into the caves,\" he answered, \"is just the very thing that, for the present, it is almost impossible for any European to do.  The Maziri are a wild and lawless tribe.  They are indeed so bloodthirsty, their country so mountainous, and their valleys so infertile, that hitherto no one has ever interfered with their affairs.  Like all the Arabs, they are a nation of robbers and cut-throats, who lived in the past by means of the slave-trade, and to-day exist by cattle-stealing and robbery.  The man who tries to enter the ’Caves of Zoroaster’ will have his work cut out.\"  \"Will you let us see the Sunstone?\" asked Harry.  \"Certainly, my boy,\" said Mr. Langton.  \"I’ll take you both down to the bungalow to-morrow morning, or—if you cannot wait till then—we can go to-night.\"  \"Isn’t it rather risky,\" asked von Hardenberg, \"to keep such a valuable thing out of the house?\"  \"The bungalow is always locked,\" said Mr. Langton, \"and I keep the Sunstone in a cabinet.  Moreover, you must remember that nobody knows of its value.  No thief would ever dream of stealing it.  It is, to all appearances, only an inferior piece of jade.\"  \"But you have money there as well?\" said von Hardenberg.  \"Not much,\" answered the Judge.  \"Since I do my accounts there it is convenient to have my cashbox at hand.  But it seldom contains more than twenty pounds—the amount of money I require to pay the men employed on the estate.\"  \"What an extraordinary thing,\" said Harry, still thinking of the treasure of Zoroaster, \"that it should have existed for all these years and never have been plundered.\"  \"Not so extraordinary,\" said Mr. Langton, \"when you know the Arabs. The Maziris, as I have told you, are of Arab descent, though they are not followers of the Prophet.  The sun-worshippers are extremely devout.  No priest of Zoroaster would think of stealing the treasure; that would be to plunge his soul into eternal punishment.\"  \"And no one else,\" asked von Hardenberg, \"no Mohammedan or heathen, has ever been able to enter the vault?\"  \"Never,\" said Mr. Langton, \"because the Sunstone is the secret.  That is why, when the Sunstone was stolen, they were so anxious to run the thief to earth.\"  Von Hardenberg knit his brows.  He was silent for a moment, and appeared to be thinking.  \"And you believe you have solved the mystery?\" he asked.  \"I know I have,\" said the Judge.  \"If at this moment I suddenly found myself in the Caves of Zoroaster, with the Sunstone in my hand, I could gain access to the vault.\"  Von Hardenberg bit his lip quickly, and then looked sharply at his uncle.  When he spoke, it was in the voice of a man who took little or no interest in the subject under discussion.  \"I should rather like to see it,\" he remarked.  Accordingly, as soon as dinner was finished, they put on their overcoats, and conducted by the Judge, who carried a lantern, they followed a path through the woods until they came to the bungalow.  Mr. Langton unlocked the door and put the key into his"]]]
