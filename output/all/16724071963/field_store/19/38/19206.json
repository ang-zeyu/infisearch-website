He is the      coolest hand I have ever yet met. We rode ninety-four miles.      Hodson rode seventy-two on one horse, the little dun, and I      rode Alma seventy-two miles also.\"  One more anecdote, however, we cannot resist. On the 6th of January, 1858, Seaton's column joins the Commander-in-Chief; on the 27th, at Shumshabad, poor young Macdowell (whose letters make one love him) is killed, and Hodson badly wounded. They were in advance, as usual, with guns, and had to charge a superior body of cavalry:--       \"But there was nothing for it but fighting, as, had we not      attacked them, they would have got in amongst our guns. We      were only three officers, and about one hundred and eighty      horsemen,--my poor friend and second in command, Macdowell,      having received a mortal wound a few minutes before we      charged. It was a terrible _mêlée_ for some time, and we      were most wonderfully preserved. However, we gave them a      very proper thrashing, and killed their leaders. Two out of      the three of us were wounded, and five of my men killed and      eleven wounded, besides eleven horses. My horse had three      sabre-cuts, and I got two, which I consider a rather unfair      share. The Commander-in-Chief is very well satisfied, I      hear, with the day's work, and is profusely civil and kind      to me.\"  In another letter he writes:--       \"They were very superior in number, and individually so as      horsemen and swordsmen, but we managed to 'whop' them all      the same, and drive them clean off the field; not, however,      until they had made two very pretty dashes at us, which cost      us some trouble and very hard fighting. It was the hardest      thing of the kind in which I ever was engaged in point of      regular '_in_ fighting,' as they say in the P. R.; only      _Bell's Life_ could describe it properly. I got a cut,      which laid my thumb open, from a fellow after my sword was      through him, and about half an hour later this caused me to      get a second severe cut, which divided the muscles of the      right arm, and put me _hors de combat_; for my grip on the      sword-handle was weakened, and a demon on foot succeeded in      striking down my guard, or rather his tulwar glanced off my      guard on to my arm. My horse, also, got three cuts. I have      got well most rapidly, despite an attack of erysipelas,      which looked very nasty for three days, and some slight      fever; and I have every reason to be thankful.\"  He is able, notwithstanding wounds, to accompany the forces, Colonel Burn kindly driving him in his dog-cart. Nothing could exceed Sir Colin's kind attentions. Here is a chief, at last, who can appreciate a certain captain, late lieutenant under a cloud. The old chief drinks his health as colonel, and, on Hodson's doubting, says:--       \"_I_ will see that it is all arranged; just make a      memorandum of your services during the Punjaub war, and I      venture to prophesy that it will not be long before I shake      hands with you as Lieutenant-Colonel Hodson, C.B., with a      Victoria Cross to boot.\"  By the end of February he is well, and in command of his regiment again, and in his last fight saves the life of his adjutant, Lieut. Gough, by cutting down a rebel trooper in the very act of spearing him.  And now comes the end. For a week the siege had gone on, and work after work of the enemy had fallen. On the 11th of March the Begum's Palace was to be assaulted. Hodson had orders to move his regiment nearer to the walls, and while choosing a spot for his camp heard firing, rode on, and found his friend Brigadier Napier directing the assault. He joined him, saying, \"I am come to take care of you; you have no business to go to work without me to look after you.\" They entered the breach together, were separated in the _mêlée_, and in a few minutes Hodson was shot through the chest. The next morning the wound was declared to be mortal, and he sent for Napier to give his last instructions.       \"He lay on his bed of mortal agony,\" says this friend, \"and      met death with the same calm composure which so much      distinguished him on the field of battle. He was quite      conscious and peaceful, occasionally uttering a sentence,      'My poor wife,' 'My poor sisters.' 'I should have liked to      have seen the end of the campaign and gone home to the dear      ones once more, but it was so ordered.' 'It is hard to leave      the world just now, when success is so near, but God's will      be done.' 'Bear witness for me that I have tried to do my      duty to man. May God forgive my sins, for Christ's sake.' 'I      go to my Father.' 'My love to my wife,--tell her my last      thoughts were of her.' 'Lord receive my soul.' These were      his last words, and without a sigh or struggle his pure and      noble spirit took its flight.\"  \"It was so ordered.\" They were his own words; and now that the first anguish of his loss is over, will not even those nearest and dearest to him acknowledge \"it was ordered for the best?\" For is there not something painful to us in calculating the petty rewards which we can bestow upon a man who has done any work of deliverance for his country? Do we not almost dread--eagerly as we may desire his return--to hear the vulgar, formal phrases which are all we can devise to commemorate the toils and sufferings that we think of with most gratitude and affection? There is somewhat calming and soothing in the sadness which follows a brave man to his grave in the very place where his work was done, just when it was done. Alas, but it is a bitter lesson to learn, even to us his old schoolfellows, who have never seen him since we parted at his \"leaving breakfast.\" May God make us all braver and truer workers at our own small tasks, and worthy to join him, the hard fighter, the glorious Christian soldier and Englishman, when our time shall come.  On the next day, March 13th, he was carried to a soldier's grave, in the presence of the head-quarters, staff, and of Sir Colin, his last chief, who writes thus to his widow:--       \"I followed your noble husband to the grave myself, in order      to mark, in the most public manner, my regret and esteem for      the most brilliant soldier under my command, and one whom I      was proud to call my friend.\"  What living Englishman can add one iota to such praise from such lips? The man of whom the greatest of English soldiers could thus speak, needs no mark of official approbation, though it is a burning disgrace to the authorities that none such has been given. But the family which mourns its noblest son may be content with the rewards which his gallant life and glorious death have won for him and them,--we believe that he himself would desire no others. For his brothers-in-arms are erecting a monument to him in Lichfield Cathedral; his schoolfellows are putting up a window to him, and the other Rugbæans who have fallen with him, in Rugby Chapel; and the three regiments of Hodson's Horse will hand down his name on the scene of his work and of his death as long as Englishmen bear rule in India. And long after that rule has ceased, while England can honor brave deeds and be grateful to brave men, the heroes of the Indian mutiny will never be forgotten, and the hearts of our children's children will leap up at the names of Lawrence, Havelock, and Hodson.          To the Memory      OF      SIR HENRY LAWRENCE, K. C. B.      THE TRUE CHRISTIAN, THE BRAVE SOLDIER,      THE FAITHFUL FRIEND,       THESE EXTRACTS FROM THE LETTERS OF      ONE WHOM HE TRAINED      TO FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS, AND WHO NOW      RESTS NEAR HIM AT LUCKNOW,      Are Dedicated       BY THE EDITOR.       They were lovely and pleasant in their lives,      And in their deaths they were not divided.     PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.   I have now been able to complete the series of extracts from my brother's letters, down to the morning of the fatal 11th March. The greater portion of the Fourth Chapter of Part II. will be found to have been added since the first edition.  I have to apologize for an inaccuracy in the quotation which I gave from Sir Colin Campbell's letter on the occasion of my brother's death. A correct copy of the letter in full will be found at page 431. I have not found it necessary to make any other corrections of importance. Cases have been pointed out to me, in which officers who took part in different operations described, and did good service, are not mentioned by name; but I felt that I could not supply any such omissions, without taking upon myself a responsibility which I have disclaimed.  It was very natural that my brother, in writing to his wife, should make especial mention of those in whom she was interested. It is probable, too, that in some cases, subsequent information would have modified views expressed at the moment, but I have adhered to the principle of giving his letters as they were written day by day.  The favorable reception given to the former editions of this work, has quite satisfied me that I was not wrong in supposing that my brother's character only required to be known, in order to be estimated as it deserved, by Englishmen of every class and profession.       COOKHAM DEANE, _July, 1859_.     PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.   It can scarcely be needful to make any apology for offering to the public this record of one who has attracted to himself so large a measure of attention and admiration. Many, both in this country and in India, have expressed, and I doubt not many others have felt, a desire to know more of the commander of Hodson's Horse, and captor of the King of Delhi and his sons.  My original intention was to have compiled from my brother's letters merely an account of the part he bore in the late unhappy war.

Columbian Book Company, Hartford, Conn. 1877.  Copyright by Columbian Book Company. 1877.     PART I.  MOUNTAIN ADVENTURES AND FRONTIER LIFE.     INTRODUCTION.   When the author of this book has been absorbed in the elegant narratives of Washington Irving, reading and musing over _Astoria_ and _Bonneville_, in the cozy quiet of a New York study, no prescient motion of the mind ever gave prophetic indication of that personal acquaintance which has since been formed with the scenes, and even with some of the characters which figure in the works just referred to. Yet so have events shaped themselves that to me Astoria is familiar ground; Forts Vancouver and Walla-Walla pictured forever in my memory; while such journeys as I have been enabled to make into the country east of the last named fort, have given me a fair insight into the characteristic features of its mountains and its plains.  To-day, a railroad traverses the level stretch between the Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains, along which, thirty years ago, the fur-traders had worn a trail by their annual excursions with men, pack-horses, and sometimes wagons, destined to the Rocky Mountains. Then, they had to guard against the attacks of the Savages; and in this respect civilization is behind the railroad, for now, as then, it is not safe to travel without a sufficient escort. To-day, also, we have new Territories called by several names cut out of the identical hunting-grounds of the fur-traders of thirty years ago; and steamboats plying the rivers where the mountain-men came to set their traps for beaver; or cities growing up like mushrooms from a soil made quick by gold, where the hardy mountain-hunter pursued the buffalo herds in search of his winter's supply of food.  The wonderful romance which once gave enchantment to stories of hardship and of daring deeds, suffered and done in these then distant wilds, is fast being dissipated by the rapid settlement of the new Territories, and by the familiarity of the public mind with tales of stirring adventure encountered in the search for glittering ores. It was, then, not without an emotion of pleased surprise that I first encountered in the fertile plains of Western Oregon the subject of this biography, a man fifty-eight years of age, of fine appearance and buoyant temper, full of anecdote, and with a memory well stored with personal recollections of all the men of note who have formerly visited the old Oregon Territory, when it comprised the whole country west of the Rocky Mountains lying north of California and south of the forty-ninth parallel. This man is _Joseph L. Meek_, to whose stories of mountain-life I have listened for days together; and who, after having figured conspicuously, and not without considerable fame, in the early history of Oregon, still prides himself most of all on having been a \"mountain-man.\"  It has frequently been suggested to Mr. Meek, who has now come to be known by the familiar title of \"Uncle Joe\" to all Oregon, that a history of his varied adventures would make a readable book, and some of his neighbors have even undertaken to become his historian, yet with so little well-directed efforts that the task after all has fallen to a comparative stranger. I confess to having taken hold of it with some doubts as to my claims to the office; and the best recommendation I can give my work is the interest I myself felt in the subject of it; and the only apology I can offer for anything incredible in the narrative which it may contain, is that I \"tell the tale as 'twas told to me,\" and that I have no occasion to doubt the truth of it.  Seeing that the incidents I had to record embraced a period of a score and a half of years, and that they extended over those years most interesting in Oregon history, as well as of the history of the Fur Trade in the West, I have concluded to preface Mr. Meek's adventures with a sketch of the latter, believing that the information thus conveyed to the reader will give an additional degree of interest to their narration. The impression made upon my own mind as I gained a knowledge of the facts which I shall record in this book relating to the early occupation of Oregon, was that they were not only profoundly romantic, but decidedly unique.  Mr. Meek was born in Washington Co., Virginia, in 1810, one year before the settlement of _Astoria_, and at a period when Congress was much interested in the question of our Western possessions and their boundary. \"Manifest destiny\" seemed to have raised him up, together with many others, bold, hardy, and fearless men, to become sentinels on the outposts of civilization, securing to the United States with comparative ease a vast extent of territory, for which, without them, a long struggle with England would have taken place, delaying the settlement of the Pacific Coast for many years, if not losing it to us altogether. It is not without a feeling of genuine self-congratulation, that I am able to bear testimony to the services, hitherto hardly recognized, of the \"mountain-men\" who have settled in Oregon. Whenever there shall arise a studious and faithful historian, their names shall not be excluded from honorable mention, nor least illustrious will appear that of Joseph L. Meek, the Rocky Mountain Hunter and Trapper.     CONTENTS.   PREFATORY CHAPTER.
