It is, however, more remarkable from the extraordinary construction of its wings, the outer quills of which are greatly curved, and the shafts dilated to a most disproportionate size; a similar structure occurs also in the Broad-shafted H. B. of Dr. Shaw, (_T. latipennis_.) That it is intended to fulfil some important office in their economy, will admit of no doubt, for in wisdom are all things made; conjecture must, however, in numberless instances, supply our want of real knowledge; and it may not be improbable that such additional strength in the wings has been given them as a defence against the small birds of prey, (_Lanii._ Lin.) which abound in tropical countries.  The figure is the size of life; bill curved from the base, with a black stripe between that and the eye; plumage above deep shining green, most brilliant on the sides of the neck; ear feathers blue green; chin and throat of a most brilliant deep violet blue, changing in some lights to purple, becoming greenish on the breast, and blended with the green of the neck; all these feathers are disposed like scales; vent golden green, with two tufts of downy white feathers round the thighs. Tail even, the feathers broad and truncately rounded, of a rufous cinnamon colour, tipt with a purple black bar; the middle feathers darkest, and glossed with green.  Of this rare and unrecorded species, a fine example existed in Mr. Bullock's Museum, which was purchased to enrich that of Paris: another, more imperfect, was sent Mr. Falkner from the Spanish Main. The male of _T. latipennis_ is undescribed, Dr. Shaw having only seen the female; both sexes, however, are in my possession. The plant introduced in the plate (_Clitoria Plumieri_) is a native of Brazil.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 84  [Illustration]  ACHATINA emarginata,  _Notched Achatina._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 30.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _A.

Gmelin remarks that the animal emits a phosphoric light; and Captain Cook observed that it is oviparous, and discharged, on being touched, a liquor of the most beautiful purple. Dr. Turton and Mr. Dillwyn have recorded several British localities for this shell; and the former notes having seen it alive, but without giving any original account of the animal. The extreme brittleness of the shell is such, that, although common, it is very rarely seen so perfect as here represented, from shells in my own cabinet. All the figures I have seen are very defective.         *       *       *       *       *  IANTHINA globosa.  _Globular Oceanic Snail--middle figures._      _I. testâ ventricosâ, basi productâ; aperturâ longiore quam latiore;     labio exteriore leviter emarginato._      Shell ventricose, the base lengthened; aperture longer than broad;     outer lip slightly emarginate.         *       *       *       *       *  The notch, which in _I. fragilis_ extends the whole length of the lip, in this, is very slight, and nearly central.

They are likewise a very numerous family, and, with three or four exceptions, are all inhabitants of tropical latitudes, particularly the Indian Ocean. Bruguière and Lamarck have each written very able descriptions of the species, of which the latter enumerates 179 recent, and 9 found only in a fossil state.  This is a shell of great rarity and beauty. Dead and injured specimens are often seen, in which the deep reddish brown colour is bleached to a pale rose, and the base worn round. Of the live shell I have never seen more than two or three; and the finest of these is here figured from Mr. Dubois' cabinet: it is a native of the Asiatic Ocean.  I see no reason why the original name of Linnæus for this shell should have been changed, although, under it, he has evidently included other species quite distinct; (his var. [beta] being _C. ebræus_): indeed, it too often happens, that in making those alterations absolutely necessary in the present state of the science, the spirit of innovation oversteps the justice due to those, whose labours first laid the foundation of our own knowledge.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 87  [Illustration]  SPHINX Labruscæ,  _Wild Vine Hawk-moth._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 81.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _S. alis integris; anticis virescentibus, fasciâ triangulari centrali     maculoque fusco ornatis; posticis medio cæruleo-nigris, margine fulvo;     abdominis lateribus punctis quinque niveis._      S.

The insects of Europe, indeed, offer but few exceptions to these characters; but the habits of certain exotic tribes, in each of these families, partake both of one and the other in a remarkable manner. Thus, among the butterflies, there is a genus in South America (hitherto unnoticed), which fly only during the dusk of evening: a number of the Linnæan Hawk-moths prefer the meridian heat of the sun; and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39472"],["title","Zoological Illustrations, Volume 2 (#5)"],["body","are not wanting several moths which are only seen during the same period of the day.  The insect, however, before us, is of that tribe to which the remark of Linnæus is strictly applicable; and, although included in the _Systema Naturæ_, has remained without any correct representation, for it would be difficult to delineate a worse figure of it than that given by Cramer. Besides the row of five snowy white spots on each side of the body, there are four pair of others, more dusky, down the middle, and five small black dots near the outer margin of the fore wings; the colour of all beneath is a buff yellow, with two faint dusky oblique bars, and the middle of the fore wings sea green.  I have received this species from Jamaica; in its larva state it appears to feed on the wild vine.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 88  [Illustration]  MITRA caffra,  _Brown white-banded Mitre._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 23.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _M.

Ill._ _pl._ 35.) may eventually be considered only a variety of the shell here figured, which accords much closer with the characters given of the Linnæan _M. caffra_, than any other; the two shells, however, at the first glance, have a widely different appearance; yet not more so, than the smooth and plaited varieties of _Strombus vittatus Lin._ I have therefore retained the character given by Lamarck, as the best method to be followed in doubtful cases. In this shell, the plaits commence halfway round the body whirl; they are obtuse, crowded, and not angulated near the suture; the striæ between are fine and decidedly marked; the base half of the shell strongly grooved; the suture rather compressed; the channel short and not recurved, and the aperture striated.         *       *       *       *       *  MITRA crassa  _Thick Mitre--upper and lower figures._         *       *       *       *       *      _M.

A species evidently unknown to Lamarck; the upper margin of each whorl is thick and projecting; the striæ on the body whorl are nearly obsolete, but on the spire become deep, remote, and having internally minute hollow dots; the inner margin of the exterior lip is strongly crenated, the aperture smooth, and the pillar with five strong teeth. I believe it was brought from the South Seas.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 89  [Illustration]  PSITTACUS murinus,  _Grey-breasted Parakeet._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 1.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P. viridis, genis, auribus, gulâque cinereis; vertice, remigibus     rectriciumque marginibus sub-cæruleis._      Green; sides of the head, ears, and throat, grey; crown, quills, and     end of the tail, bluish.

I borrowed it for a day from the good woman to whom it belonged, and thus made the drawing and description with the bird before me.  Dr. Latham observes on this species, that excepting where the grey colour pervades, \"the rest of the body is olive green, excepting the quills, which are deep green;\"--this may be the female. He adds a quotation from Pernetty, who describes a bird from Monte Video, something near this; but which, from having a very long tail, a flesh-coloured bill, &c. may probably be distinct.  The live bird could not be conveniently measured, but it is rather larger than the red-shouldered Parrakeet, (figured at pl. 62.) The skin round the eye white, and the irides hazel; the whole upper part of the plumage is a beautiful grass green, changing according to the light into different shades; the top of the head, the quill feathers, and end of the tail, greenish blue, in some lights appearing quite blue; the sides of the head, ears, and throat, as far as the breast, bluish grey; all the remaining under plumage yellowish green, with a shade of orange in the middle of the body and vent; bill and legs dark grey; this latter colour is so unusual in this tribe, that I at first thought it indicated an imperfect plumage, but I have now seen it at two different seasons of the year without any variation whatever. It is probably a South American species.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 90  [Illustration]  PTEROGLOSSUS inscriptus,  _Lettered Aracari._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 44.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P. fusco-viridis, capite gulâque nigris (feminæ castaneis;) uropygio     rubro; abdomine flavo; rostri fulvi culmine, basi et apice nigris;     marginibus dentatis, lineis nigris inscriptis._      Obscure green; head and throat black, (in the female chesnut;) rump     crimson; body yellow; bill fulvous, the top, base, and tip, black; the     margins dentated, and marked with black lines resembling characters.         *       *       *       *       *  I was put in possession of this rare and unknown bird, by the dispersion of the most magnificent assemblage of natural productions that ever marked the zeal of an individual, or ornamented the capital of this kingdom. Mr. Bullock's Museum is now scattered; yet the objects it comprised were deemed worthy of enriching the public repositories of every nation in Europe; who sent their learned men to purchase with avidity, and share in the spoils of a Museum, the dispersion of which will be long regretted by the learned, the inquiring, and \"the many.\"  Total length, twelve inches and a half; bill, from the angle of the mouth to the tip, two inches three tenths long, and eight tenths across the base; the colour (which appears little changed from that in the live state) is deep straw, or buff yellow; the top of the upper mandible and tips of both are black; parallel with the marginal base of the upper, is a black line, which is very broad on that of the lower; the edges of both are serrated, and marked by short black lines, somewhat resembling oriental characters; at the base of the bill there is an elevated rim of deeper yellow; the ears, chin, and throat are deep chesnut, margined in front with a narrow line of black, (which parts in the male are entirely black;) the crown of the head and neck above also black, changing to a dark bluish green on the wings, back, and tail; the rump crimson, and the greater quills blackish; from the breast to the vent straw-coloured yellow, with a greenish cast; the thighs and flanks olive; tail wedged, near five inches long; the orbits appear to have been black, and the feet green.  Mr. Bullock informed me he had the two sexes of this bird sent him from the interior of Guyana.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 91  [Illustration]  LICINIA Amphione.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 15.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _L. alis integris, suprà nigris; anticarum basi maculo aurantiaco,     triradiato, medio fasciâ flavâ, apice maculo flavo ornatis; posticis     strigâ aurantiacâ, margine ferrugineo; antennarum clavis albis_.

It is a native of Brazil, and according to Godart of Guyana and the Antilles: though not common, it is sometimes frequent in local situations, preferring the borders of deep forests, and flying very slowly. I had the means of fully ascertaining the two sexes, of which the two upper figures are of the male, and the lower one the female. There can be no doubt the latter is the _Pieris Amphione_, so admirably described by M. Godart, who, however, makes no mention of the black marginal spots on the under side of the posterior wings, represented in Cramer's figure, which may therefore be a variety. More difficulty, however, exists in ascertaining if the male is distinct from _P. Laia_, of Godart: the figures of Cramer, in general, are so inaccurate, as always to excite a doubt in cases of nice discrimination; Godart's description, nevertheless, perfectly agrees with Cramer's figure: if it was, therefore, drawn up from the insect itself, there can be little doubt that _Laia_ is distinct from _Amphione_; if, on the other hand, M.
