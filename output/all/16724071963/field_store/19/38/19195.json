Their continued survival after large numbers of younger voles had been added to the population probably was permitted by the expanding habitat of spring and summer. The percentage of the population surviving the winter of 1951-1952 was approximately double the percentage surviving the winter of 1950-1951. This difference seemed to be due to the smaller population entering the winter of 1951-1952 rather than any major difference in the environmental resistance.  As a consequence of the differential survival, most of the breeding population in the spring was made up of animals born the previous October and November. Fig. 4 shows that in February, when the percentage of breeding females ordinarily began to rise, 51.6 per cent of the population was born in the previous October and November. Voles born in these two months continued to form a large part of the population through March (45.1 per cent), April (38.5 per cent), May (23.9 per cent), June (18.7 per cent) and July (16.2 per cent) (Fig. 4). These percentages suggest that the habitat conditions in October and November were probably important in determining the population level for at least the first half of the next year.  [Illustration: FIG. 4. Differential survival of voles according to month when first caught. Each column represents the percentage of the monthly sample first caught in each of the preceding months. Those voles caught first in October and November survived longer than those first caught in other months. Relatively few individuals remained in the population as long as one year.]     POPULATION DENSITY   Population densities were ascertained on the study areas by means of the live-trapping program. Blair (1948:396) stated that almost all small mammals old enough to leave the nest (except shrews and moles) are captured by live-trapping. My experience, and that of other workers on the Reservation, requires modification of such a statement. The distance between traps is an important factor in determining the efficiency of live-trapping. As mentioned earlier, when House Field and Quarry Field were trapped out at the conclusion of the live-trapping program no unmarked voles were taken. This showed that the 30 foot interval between traps was short enough to cover the area as far as _Microtus_ was concerned. The fact that unmarked adults were caught almost entirely in marginal traps is additional evidence. On the other hand, the Fitch traps were 50 feet apart and voles seemed to have lived within the grid for several months before being captured. Fitch (1954:39) has shown that some kinds of small mammals are missed in a live-trapping program because of variation in bait acceptance, both seasonal and specific.  A few individuals, missed in a trapping period, were captured again in subsequent months. These voles were assumed to have been present during the month in which they were not caught. The area actually trapped each month was estimated by a modification of the method proposed by Stickel (1946:153). The average maximum move was calculated each month and a strip one half the average maximum move in width was added to each side of the study area actually covered by traps. The study plots were bounded in part by gravel roads and forest edge acting as barriers, and for these parts no marginal strip was added. Trap lines on the opposite sides of these roads rarely caught marked voles that had crossed in either direction. It is perhaps advisable to say here that the size of House Field and Quarry Field study plots (0.56 acres) was too small for best results in estimating population levels (Blair, 1941:149). In the computations of population levels the data for males and females were combined, because no significant difference between the average maximum move of the sexes was apparent.  Fluctuations of the populations were graphed in terms of individuals per acre (Fig. 5). The variation was great in the 30 month period for which data were available, and was both chronological and topographical. The lowest density recorded was 25.2 individuals per acre and the highest density was 145.8 individuals per acre. The weight varied from a low of 847 grams per acre to a high of 5275 grams per acre.  [Illustration: FIG. 5. Variations in density of voles from three populations, as shown by live-trapping, and the mean density of these populations. Juveniles are not represented in their true numbers since many voles were caught first as subadults. The samples from the Fitch trap line were incomplete due to the wide spacing of the traps.]  There are few records of density of _M. ochrogaster_ in the literature. Brumwell (1951:213) found nine individuals per acre in a prairie on the Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation and Wooster (1939:515) reported 38.5 individuals per acre for _M. o. haydeni_ in a mixed prairie in west-central Kansas. High densities for _M. pennsylvanicus_ reported in the literature include 29.8 individuals per acre (Blair, 1948:404), 118 individuals per acre (Bole, 1939:69), 160-230 individuals per acre (Hamilton, 1937b:781) and 67 individuals per acre (Townsend, 1935:97).  Because the study period included one period of unusually high rainfall and one year of unusually low rainfall, the normal pattern of seasonal variation of population density was obscured. An examination of the data suggested, however, that the greatest densities were reached in October and November with a second high point in the April-May-June period. These high points generally followed the periods of high levels of breeding activity (Fig. 8). The autumn rise in population may have been due, in part, to the addition of spring and early summer litters to the breeding population, but the rise occurred too late in the year to be explained by that alone. Another factor may have been the spurt in growth of grasses occurring in Kansas in early autumn, in September and October. There was a seeming correlation between high rainfall with rapid growth of grasses and reproductive activity, and, secondarily with high population densities of voles. These relationships are discussed in connection with reproduction. Lowest annual densities were found to occur in January when there is but little breeding activity and when rainfall is low and plant growth has ceased.  Marked deviation from the usual seasonal trends accompanied flood and drought. In the flood of July, 1951, although the study areas were not inundated, the ground was saturated to the extent that every footprint at once became a puddle. Immediately after the floods, on all three areas studied, populations were found to have been drastically reduced. The effect was most severe on the population of House Field, the lowest area studied, and the recovery of the population there was much slower than that of those on the other study areas (Fig. 5). Newborn voles were killed by the saturated condition of the ground in which they lay. The more precocious young of _Sigmodon hispidus_ survived wetting better. They thus acquired an advantage in the competitive relationship between cotton rats and voles. These relationships are discussed more fully in the section on mammalian associates of _Microtus_.  Adverse effects of heavy rainfall on populations of small mammals have been reported by Blair (1939) and others. Goodpastor and Hoffmeister (1952:370) reported that inundation sharply reduced populations of _M. ochrogaster_ for a year after flooding but that the area was then reoccupied by a large population of voles. Such a reoccupation may have begun on the areas of this study in the spring of 1952 when the upward trend of the population was abruptly reversed by drought. While cotton rats were abundant their competition may have been an important factor in depressing population levels of voles. The population of voles began to rise only after the population of cotton rats had decreased (Fig. 19).  In the unusually dry summer of 1952, there was a marked decline of population levels beginning in June and continuing to August when my field work was terminated. Dr. Fitch (1953, _in litt._) informed me that the decline continued through the winter of 1952-53 and into the summer of 1953, until daily catches of _Microtus_ on the Reservation were reduced to 2-10 per cent of the number caught on the same trap lines in the summer of 1951. The drought seemed to affect population levels by inhibiting reproduction, as described elsewhere in this report. A similar sensitivity to drought was reported by Wooster (1935:352) who found _M. o. haydeni_ decreased more than any other species of small mammal after the great drought of the thirties.  No evidence of cycles in _M. ochrogaster_ was observed in this investigation. All of the fluctuations noted were adequately explained as resulting from the direct effects of weather or from its indirect effect in determining the kinds and amounts of vegetation available as food and shelter.  The differences in densities supported by the various habitats were discussed earlier in connection with the analysis of habitats.     HOME RANGE   Home ranges were calculated for individual voles according to the method described by Blair (1940:149-150). The term, home range, is used as defined by Burt (1943:350-351). Only those voles captured at least four times were used for the home range studies. Individuals which included the edge of the trap grid in their range were excluded unless a barrier existed (see description of habitat) confining the seeming range to the study area.  The validity of home range calculations has been challenged (Hayne, 1950:39) and special methods of determining home range have been advocated by a number of authors. The ranges calculated in this study are assumed to approximate the actual areas used by individuals and are considered useful for comparison with other ranges calculated by similar methods, but no claim to exactness is intended. It is obvious, for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39396"],["title","A Population Study of the Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogaster) in Northeastern (#5)"],["body",", that many plotted ranges contain so-called blank areas which, at times, are not actually used by any vole (Elton, 1949:8; Mohr, 1943:553). Studies of the movements of mammals on a more detailed scale, perhaps by live-traps set at shorter intervals and moved frequently, are needed to increase our understanding of home range.  In order to test the reliability of the range calculated, an examination of the relationship between the size of the seeming range and the number of captures was made. For the first three months, trapping on House Field was done with a 20 foot grid and throughout the remainder of the study a 30 foot grid was used. The effect of these different spacings on the size of the seeming home range was also investigated. Hayne (1950:38) found that an increase in the distance between traps caused an increase in the size of the seeming home range, but in my study the increased interval between traps was not accompanied by any change in the sizes of the calculated ranges.  The number of captures, above the minimum of four, did not seem to be a factor in determining the size of the calculated monthly range. A seeming relationship was observed between the number of times an individual was trapped and the total area used during the entire time the vole was trapped. Closer examination revealed that the most important factor was the length of time over which the vole's captures extended. Table 2 shows the progressive increase in sizes of the mean range of animals taken over periods of time from one month to ten months.    TABLE 2.

Several workers, including Blair (1940) and Hamilton (1937c), have studied the home range of _M. pennsylvanicus_. Blair (1940:153) reported a larger range for males than for females in all habitats and in all seasons represented in his sample. In _M. ochrogaster_, however, I found that the mean monthly range for both sexes was 0.09 of an acre. Blair (_loc. cit._) reported no individuals with a range so small as that mean, but Hamilton (_op. cit._:261) mentioned two voles with ranges of less than 1200 square feet. The mean total range used by an individual during the entire time it was being trapped showed a slight difference between the sexes. Males used an average of 0.14 of an acre whereas females used an average of but 0.12 of an acre. This suggested that, as in _M. pennsylvanicus_ (Hamilton, _loc. cit._), males tended to wander more than females and to shift their home range more often.  The largest monthly range recorded was 0.28 of an acre used by a female in March, 1951, and calculated on the basis of four captures. The largest monthly range of a male was 0.25 of an acre for a vole caught eight times in November, 1950. The smallest monthly range was 0.02 of an acre; several individuals of both sexes were restricted to areas of this size. Juveniles, not included in the home range study, were usually restricted to 0.01 or, at most, 0.02 of an acre. Seasonal differences in the sizes of home ranges were not significant. However, the voles caught in the winter often enough to be used for home range studies were too few for a thorough study of seasonal variation in the size of home ranges.  One female was captured 22 times in the seven-month period of October, 1950, to April, 1951. She used an area of 0.83 of an acre, but this actually comprised two separate ranges. From October, 1950, through December, 1950, she was taken 17 times within an area of 0.12 of an acre; and from January, 1951, to April, 1951, she was taken five times within an area of 0.15 of an acre. The largest area assumed to represent one range of a female was 0.38 of an acre, recorded on the basis of six captures in three months. The largest area encompassed by the record of an individual male was 0.41 of an acre. He, too, shifted his range, being taken five times on an area of 0.07 of an acre and twice, two months later, on an area of 0.09 of an acre. Presumably, the remainder of his calculated total range was used but little, or not at all. The largest single range of a male was 0.36 of an acre, calculated on the basis of 18 captures in seven months. The smallest total range for both sexes was 0.02 of an acre.  Many voles shifted their home range and a few did so abruptly. The large range of a female vole, described above and plotted in Fig. 6, indicated an abrupt shift from one home range to another. More common is a gradual shift as indicated by the range of the male shown in Fig. 7. Large parts of each monthly range of this vole overlapped the area used in other months but his center of activity shifted from month to month.  [Illustration: FIG. 6.

No territoriality has been reported in any species of _Microtus_, to my knowledge, and my voles showed no objection to sharing their range. Voles taken from the field into the laboratory lived together in pairs or larger groups without much friction.  Definable systems of runways and home ranges were not coextensive. Runway systems tended to merge, as described later in this report, and relationships between them and home range were not apparent. Home ranges had no characteristic shape.     LIFE HISTORY   Reproduction  Reproductive activity might have been measured in a number of ways. Three indicators were tested: the percentage of females gravid or lactating, the percentage of juveniles in the month following the sampling period, and the percentage of females with a vaginal orifice in the sampling period. The condition of vagina proved to be most useful. Whether or not there is a vaginal cycle in _Microtus_ is uncertain. Bodenheimer and Sulman (1946:255-256) found no evidence of such a cycle, nor did I in my work with laboratory animals at Lawrence. How much the artificial environment of the laboratory affected these findings is unknown. The presence of an orifice seemed to indicate sexual activity (Hamilton, 1941:9). The percentage of gravid females in the population could not be determined accurately by a live-trapping study and was not useful in this investigation. The percentage of juveniles trapped in the month following the sampling period tended to follow the curve of the percentage of adult females with a vaginal orifice. The ratio of trapped juveniles to adults trapped was a poor indicator of reproductive activity. Juveniles were caught in relatively small numbers because of their restricted movements, and no way to determine prenatal and juvenal mortality was available.  Reproductive activity continues throughout the year. Within the thirty-month period for which data were obtained, December and January showed the lowest percentages of females with vaginal orifices (Fig. 8). The other months all showed higher levels of reproductive activity with a slight peak in the August-September-October period in both 1950 and 1951. In the species of _Microtus_ that are found in the United States, such summer peaks of breeding seem to be the rule (Blair, 1940:151; Gunderson, 1950:17; Hamilton, 1937b:785). Jameson (1947:147) worked in the same county where my field study was made and found that the high point of reproduction was in March, although his samples were too small to be reliable. The peak of reproductive activity slightly preceded the highest level of population density in each year (Fig. 8).  [Illustration: FIG. 8. Variations in density and reproductive rate of voles, with variation in monthly precipitation. Abnormally low rainfall in 1952 caused a decrease in breeding activity and eventually in the numbers of voles. The solid line indicates the number of voles per acre, the broken line the percentage of females with a vaginal orifice and the dotted line the inches of rainfall.]  A marked reduction in the percentage of females having vaginal orifices was observed in the unusually dry summer of 1952. The rate of reproduction was found to be positively correlated with rainfall (Fig. 9). Correlation coefficients were higher in each case when the amount of rainfall in the month preceding each sampling period was used instead of that in the month of the sample. This suggested that the rainfall exerted its influence indirectly through its effect on plant growth. Bailey (1924:530) reported that a reduction in either the quantity or quality of food had a depressing effect on reproduction. Drought, such as occurred in 1952, would certainly have a depressing effect on both. The critical factor seems to be the supply of new, actively growing shoots available to the voles for food rather than the total amount of vegetation. As far as could be determined from the small sample of males examined, their fecundity was not"]]]
