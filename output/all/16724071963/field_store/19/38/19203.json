For example, when set to work on the Asylum, he writes:--       \"Colonel Lawrence seems determined I shall have nothing to      stop me, for his invariable reply to every question is, 'Act      on your own judgment,' 'Do what you think right,' 'I give      you _carte blanche_ to act in my name, and draw on my      funds,' and so forth.\"  Which confidence is worthily bestowed. Hodson sets to work, forgetting all professional etiquette, and giving up society for the time.       \"Cutting trees down, getting lime burnt, bricks made, planks      sawn up, the ground got ready, and then watching the work      foot by foot; showing this \"nigger\" how to lay his bricks,      another the proper proportions of a beam, another the      construction of a door, and to the several artisans the      mysteries of a screw, a nail, a hinge. You cannot say to a      man, 'Make me a wall or a door,' but you must, with your own      hands, measure out his work, teach him to saw away here, to      plane there, or drive such a nail, or insinuate such a      suspicion of glue. And when it comes to be considered that      this is altogether new work to me, and has to be excuded by      cogitation on the spot, so as to give an answer to every      inquirer, you may understand the amount of personal exertion      and attention required for the work.\"  Again, a few months later, November, 1847,--       \"I am in a high queer-looking native house among the ruins      of this old stronghold of the Pathans, with orders 'to make      a good road from Lahore to the Sutlej, distance forty      miles,' in as brief a space as possible. On the      willing-to-be-generally-useful principle, this is all very      well, and one gets used to turning one's hand to everything,      but certainly (but for circumstances over which I had no      control) I always labored under the impression that I knew      nothing at all about the matter. However, Colonel Lawrence      walked into my room promiscuously one morning, and said,      'Oh, Hodson, we have agreed that you must take in hand the      road to Ferozepore. You can start in a day or two;' and      _here I am_.\"  Again, in January, 1848, he has been sent out surveying.       \"My present _rôle_ is to survey a part of the country lying      along the left bank of the Ravee and below the hills, and I      am daily and all day at work with compasses and chain, pen      and pencil, following streams, diving into valleys,      burrowing into hills, to complete my work. I need hardly      remark, that, having never attempted anything of the kind      hitherto, it is bothering at first.\"  Again, in April, 1848, he has been set to hear all manner of cases, civil, criminal, and revenue, in the Lahore Court.       \"The duty is of vast importance, and I sometimes feel a half      sensation of modesty at being set down to administer justice      in such matters so early, and without previous training. A      little practice, patience, and reflection, settle most cases      to one's satisfaction however; and one must be content with      substantial justice as distinguished from technical law.\"  Again, in a letter to his brother,--       \"Did I tell you, by-the-bye, that I abjured tobacco when I      left England, and that I have never been tempted by even a      night's _al fresco_ to resume the delusive habit? Nor have I      told you (because I despaired of your believing it) that I      have declined from the paths of virtue in respect of beer      also, these two years past, seldom or never tasting that      once idolized stimulant!\"  We have no space to comment; and can only hope that any gallant young oarsman or cricketer bound for India who may read this, will have the courage to follow Hodson's example, if he finds himself the better for abstinence, notwithstanding the fascination of the drink itself, and the cherished associations which twine round the pewter. My dear boys, remember, as Hodson did, that if you are to get on well in India it will be owing, physically speaking, to your digestions.  These glimpses will enable the reader to picture to himself how Hodson, now Assistant to the Resident at Lahore, as well as second in command of the Guides, was spending his time between the first and the final Sikh war. Let him throw in this description of the duties of \"The Guides\":--       \"The grand object of the corps is to train a body of men in      peace to be efficient in war; to be not only acquainted with      localities, roads, rivers, hills, ferries, and passes, but      have a good idea of the produce and supplies available in      any part of the country; to give _accurate_ information, not      running open-mouthed to say that 10,000 horsemen and a      thousand guns are coming, (in true native style,) but to      stop to see whether it may not really be only a common cart      and a few wild horsemen who are kicking up all the dust; to      call twenty-five by its right name, and not say _fifty_ for      short, as most natives do. This of course wants a great deal      of careful instruction and attention. Beyond this, the      officers should give a tolerably correct sketch and report      of any country through which they may pass, be _au fait_ at      routes and means of feeding troops, and above all (and here      you come close upon political duties) keep an eye on the      doings of the neighbors, and the state of the country, so as      to be able to give such information as may lead to any      outbreak being nipped in the bud.\"  The reader will probably now be of opinion that the young lieutenant, willing to make himself generally useful, and given to locomotion, will be not unlikely to turn out a very tough nut for the Sikhs to crack when they have quite made up their minds to risk another fight; and that time is rapidly drawing near. All through the spring and early summer months there are tumults and risings, which tell of a wide conspiracy. Hodson, after a narrow escape of accompanying Agnew to Mooltan, is scouring the country backwards and forwards, catching rebels and picking up news. In September, the Sikhs openly join the rebel Moolraj. General Whish is obliged to raise the siege of Mooltan; the grand struggle between the cow-killers and cow-worshippers on the banks of the Chenab has begun.  We wish we had space to follow Hodson and his Guides through the series of daring exploits by which the Doab was cleared, and which so enraged the Sikhs that \"party after party were sent to polish me off, and at one time I couldn't stir about the country without having bullets sent at my head from every bush and wall.\" He was attached to Wheeler's brigade during the greater part of the struggle, but joined the army of the Punjaub in time for the battle of Gujerat, which finished the war, and at which he and Lumsden his commander, and Lake of the Engineers, are mentioned in Lord Gough's despatch as most active in conveying orders throughout the action. We cannot however resist one story. The old Brigadier, making all haste to join the grand army, where he expects to get a division, leaves two forts at Kulallwala and 4000 unbeaten rebels in his rear. He is ordered back to account for them, whereupon Brigadier turns sulky. Hodson urges him to move on like lightning and crush them, but \"he would not, and began to make short marches, so I was compelled to outmanoeuvre him by a bold stroke.\" Accordingly he starts with 100 of his Guides, when twenty-five miles from Kulallwala, and fairly frightens a doubtful sirdar, \"preparing munitions of war, mounting guns, and looking saucy,\" out of his fort. Whereupon the Sikhs abandon a neighboring fort, and the road to Kulallwala is open without a shot fired.       \"In the morning I marched with my little party towards the      enemy, sending back a messenger to the Brigadier to say that      I was close to the place, and that if he did not come on      sharp they would run away or overwhelm me. He was dreadfully      angry, but came on like a good boy! When within a mile or so      of the fort, I halted my party to allow his column to get up      nearer, and as soon as I could see it, moved on quietly. The      _ruse_ told to perfection: thinking they had only 100 men      and myself to deal with, the Sikhs advanced in strength,      thirty to one, to meet me, with colors flying and drums      beating. Just then a breeze sprung up, the dust blew aside,      and the long line of horsemen coming on rapidly behind my      party burst upon their senses. They turned instantly, and      made for the fort; so, leaving my men to advance quietly      after them, I galloped up to the Brigadier, pointed out the      flying Sikhs, explained their position, and begged him to      charge them. He melted from his wrath, and told two      regiments of Irregulars to follow my guidance. On we went      at the gallop, cut in amongst the fugitives, and punished      them fearfully.\"  \"The Brigadier has grown quite active, and _very fond of me_ since that day at Kulallwala, though he had the wit to see how brown I had done him by making him march two marches in one.\" It is certainly to the Brigadier's credit that he does seem to have appreciated his provoking \"Guide,\" for he mentions him in the highest terms in despatch after despatch, and at the close of the war comforts him thus: \"Had your name been Hay or Ramsay, no honors, no appointments, no distinctions would have been considered too great to mark the services you have rendered to Government.\"  The war ended, the Punjaub is annexed, and Hodson with it, who loses all his appointments and returns to \"the Guides.\"  He feels sore of course at the loss of his occupation and position, but sticks to his drill-sergeant's work now that there is nothing higher to do, and pities from his heart the dozens of regimental officers at Peshawur who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39448"],["title","Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India (#3)"],["body","not an hour's work in two days. It is a recently formed station, with a flying column of 10,000 men there for the hot months, and no books or society; \"people are pitched headlong on to their own resources, and find them very hard falling indeed.\"  The first Sikh war had opened Hodson's eyes as to the merits of the Sepoys; the second makes him moralize much about the system of promotion.  He concludes that for war, especially in India, \"your leaders must be young to be effective,\" in which sentiment we heartily agree;--but how to get them? \"There are men of iron, like Napier and Radetzky, aged men whom nothing affects; but they are just in sufficient numbers to prove the rule by establishing exceptions.\" And would not the following be ludicrous, but that men's lives are in the balance?       \"A brigadier of infantry, under whom I served during the      three most critical days of the late war, could not see his      regiment when I led his horse by the bridle until its nose      touched the bayonets; and even then he said faintly, 'Pray      which way are the men facing, Mr. Hodson?' This is no      exaggeration, I assure you. Can you wonder that our troops      have to recover by desperate fighting, and with heavy loss,      the advantages thrown away by the want of heads and eyes to      lead them?       \"A seniority service, like that of the Company, is all very      well for poor men; better still for fools, for they must      rise equally with wise men; but for maintaining the      discipline and efficiency of the army in time of peace, and      hurling it on the enemy in war, there never was a system      which carried so many evils on its front and face.\"  His fast friend, Sir Henry Lawrence, again intervenes, and he is appointed an Assistant Commissioner, leaving the Guides for a time. In this capacity, in April, 1850, he comes across the new Commander-in-Chief:--       \"I have just spent three days in Sir Charles Napier's camp,      it being my duty to accompany him through such parts of the      civil district as he may have occasion to visit. He was most      kind and cordial; vastly amusing and interesting, and gave      me even a higher opinion of him than before. To be sure, his      language and mode of expressing himself savor more of the      last than of this century--of the camp than of the court;      but barring these eccentricities, he is a wonderful man; his      heart is as thoroughly in his work, and he takes as high a      tone in all that concerns it, as Arnold did in his; that is      to say, the highest the subject is capable of. I only trust      he will remain with us as long as his health lasts, and      endeavor to rouse the army from the state of slack      discipline into which it has fallen. On my parting with him      he said, 'Now, remember, Hodson, if there is any way in      which I can be of use to you, pray don't scruple to write to      me.'\"  After working in the Civil Service, chiefly in the Cis-Sutlej Provinces, for nearly two years, under Mr. Edmonstone, he is promoted to the command of the Guides on Lumsden's return to England. The wild frontier district of Euzofzai is handed over to him, where       \"I am military as well as civil chief; and the natural taste      of the Euzofzai Pathans for broken heads, murder, and      violence, as well as their litigiousness about their lands,      keeps me very hard at work from day to day.\"  Here he settles with his newly married wife, \"the most fortunate man in the service; and have I not a right to call myself the happiest also, with such a wife and such a home?\"  For nearly three years he rules this province, building a large fort for his regiment, fighting all marauders from the hills, training his men in all ways, even to practising their own sports with them.       \"William is very clever\" his wife writes \"at this,\" cutting      an orange, placed on a bamboo, in two, at full speed,      \"rarely failing. He is grievously overworked; still his      health is wonderfully good, and his spirits as wild as if he      were a boy again. He is never so well pleased as when he has      the baby in his arms.\"  Yes, the baby,--for now comes in a little episode of home and family, a gentle and bright gem in the rough setting of the soldier's life; and the tender and loving father and husband stands before us as vividly as the daring border-leader.       \"You would so delight in her baby tricks,\" he writes to his      father. \"The young lady already begins to show a singularity      of taste--refusing to go to the arms of any native women,      and decidedly preferring the male population, some of whom      are distinguished by her special favor. Her own orderly,      save the mark, never tires of looking at her 'beautiful      white fingers,' nor she of twisting them into his black      beard,--an insult to an Oriental, which he bears with an      equanimity equal to his fondness for her. The cunning      fellows have begun to make use of her too, and when they      want anything, ask the favor in the name of Lilli Bâbâ (they      cannot manage 'Olivia' at all). They know the spell is      potent.\"  But for the particulars of life in the wilderness, we must refer our readers to Mrs. Hodson's letters (pp. 197-200). This happiness was not destined to last. In July, 1854, the child dies.       \"The deep agony of this bereavement I have no words to      describe,\" the father writes. \"She had wound her little      being round our hearts to an extent which we neither of us      knew until we awoke from the brief dream of beauty, and      found ourselves childless.\"  Another trial too is at hand. In the autumn of 1854, Sir H. Lawrence is removed from the Punjaub, and in October, charges are trumped up (there is no other word for it, looking to the result) against Hodson, in both his civil and military capacity. A court of inquiry is appointed; and _before_ that court has reported, he is suspended from all civil and military duty.  Into the details of the charges against him we will not enter, lest we should be tempted into the use of hard words, which his brother has nobly refrained from. All that need be stated is, that the sting lay in the alleged confusion of his regimental accounts. The Court of Inquiry appointed Major Taylor to examine these, and report on them. This was in January, 1855; in February, 1856, Taylor presented an elaborate report, wholly exculpating Hodson. Mr. Montgomery, (then Commissioner for the Punjaub, now Chief Commissioner in Oude,) to whom it was submitted, calls it the most satisfactory report he ever read, and most triumphant. This report, however, though made public on the spot, had not, even in May, 1857, been communicated to the Government of India; whether suppressed on purpose, or not, there is no evidence. But when at last fairly brought to their notice by a remonstrance from the accused, the satisfactory nature of the document may be gathered from the fact that the answer is, \"his remonstrance will be placed on record for preservation, not for justification, which it is fully admitted was not required,--no higher testimonials were ever produced.\"  It is with the man himself that we are concerned. We have seen him in action, and in prosperity; how will he face disgrace and disaster?--       \"I must endeavor to face the wrong, the grievous, foul      wrong, with a constant and unshaken heart, and to endure      humiliation and disgrace with as much equanimity as I may;      and with the same soldierlike fortitude with which I ought      to face danger, suffering, and death in the path of duty....      Our darling babe was taken from us on the day my public      misfortunes began, and death has robbed us of our father      before their end. The brain-pressure was almost too much for      me.... I strive to look the worst boldly in the face as I      would an enemy in the field, and to do my appointed work      resolutely and to the best of my ability, satisfied that      there is a reason for all; and that even irksome duties well      done bring their own reward, and that if not, still they are      duties....       \"It is pleasant to find that not a man who knows me has any      belief that there has been anything wrong.... Not one of      them all (and, indeed, I believe I might include my worst      foes and accusers in the category) believes that I have      committed any more than errors of judgment.\"  Thus he writes to brother and sister; and, for the rest, goes back resolutely to his old regiment, and begins again the common routine of a subaltern's duties, congratulating himself that the colonel wishes to give him the adjutancy, in which post       \"I shall have the opportunity of learning a good deal of      work which will be useful to me, and of doing, I hope, a      good deal of good amongst the men. It will be the first step      up the ladder again, after tumbling to the bottom.\"  The colonel gets him to take the office of quartermaster, however, not the adjutancy, the former office \"having fallen into great disorder;\" and in January, 1857, the honest old officer, of his own accord, writes a letter to the Adjutant-General, requesting him to submit to the Commander-in-Chief \"that, his public record and acknowledgment of the essential service Lieutenant Hodson has done the regiment at his special request;\" and urging on his Excellency to find some worthier employment for the said lieutenant. In the same tone writes Brigadier Johnstone, commanding at Umbala, through whom the colonel's letter had to be forwarded; and who \"trusts his Excellency will allow of his submitting it in a more special and marked manner than by merely countersigning; for,\" goes on the General, \"Lieutenant Hodson has, with patience, perseverance, and zeal, undertaken and carried out the laborious minor duties of the regimental staff, as well as those of a company; and with a diligence, method, and accuracy, such as"]]]
