Grant was in command.     Chapter XI. -- Lee at the Parting of the Ways   While Grant was thus striving to reënter the army, Lee was having a struggle of a very different sort. Summoned from his distant post in Texas, where only an occasional rumble of the coming tempest reached his ears, he suddenly found himself in the center of the storm which threatened to wreck the Republic. In the far South seven states had already seceded; in Washington, Congressmen, Senators, and members of the Cabinet were abandoning their posts; in the army and navy his friends were daily tendering their resignations; and his own state, divided between love for the Union and sympathy with its neighbors, was hovering on the brink of secession.  The issue in Lee's mind was not the existence of slavery. He had long been in favor of emancipation, and Virginia had more than once come so close to abolishing slavery by law that its disappearance from her borders was practically assured within a very short period. All his own slaves he had long since freed and he was gradually emancipating his father-in-law's, according to the directions of Mr. Custis's will. But the right of each state to govern itself without interference from the Federal Government seemed to Lee essential to the freedom of the people. He recognized, however, that secession was revolution and, calmly and conscientiously examining the question, he concluded that, if force were used to compel any state to remain in the Union, resistance would be justifiable. Most Virginians reached this decision impulsively, light-heartedly, defiantly or vindictively, and more or less angrily, according to their temperaments and the spirit of the times, but not so Lee. He unaffectedly prayed God for guidance in the struggle between his patriotism and his devotion to a principle which he deemed essential to liberty and justice. He loved his country as only a man in close touch with its history and with a deep reverence for its great founder, Washington, could love it; he had fought for its flag; he wore its uniform; he had been educated at its expense; and General Scott, the Commander of the army, a devoted Union man, was his warm personal friend. Patriotism, personal pride, loyalty and even gratitude, therefore, urged him toward the support of the Union, and only his adherence to a principle and the claims of his kinsmen and friends forbade.  For a time Virginia resisted every effort to induce her to cast her lot with the Confederacy. Indeed she actually voted against secession when the question was first presented. But when Fort Sumter resisted attack on April 12, 1861, and the President called upon the various states to furnish troops to enforce the national authority, practically all affection for the Union disappeared and by a decisive vote Virginia determined to uphold the Southern cause.  At that crisis President Lincoln made a strong effort to induce Lee to support the Union, for he actually offered him the command of the United States Army which was about to take the field. The full force of this remarkable tribute to his professional skill was not lost upon Lee. He had devoted his whole life to the army, and to be a successor of Washington in the command of that army meant more to him than perhaps to any other soldier in the land. Certainly, if he had consulted his own ambition or been influenced by any but the most unselfish motives, he would have accepted the call as the highest honor in the gift of the nation. But to do so he would have been obliged to surrender his private principles and desert his native state, and it is impossible to imagine that a man of his character would, even for an instant, consider such a course. Gravely and sadly he declined the mighty office, and two days later he tendered his resignation from the service he had honored for almost six and thirty years.  For this and his subsequent action Lee has been called a traitor and severely criticized for well-nigh fifty years. But, when a nation has been divided against itself upon a great issue of government, millions upon one side and millions upon the other, and half a century has intervened, it is high time that justice be given to the man who did what he thought right and honorably fought for a principle which he could have surrendered only at the expense of his conscience and his honor. Lee was a traitor to the United States in the same sense that Washington was a traitor to England. No more and no less. England takes pride to-day in having given Washington to the world. Americans deprive their country of one of her claims to greatness when they fail to honor the character and the genius of Robert Lee.  It was in a letter to his old commander, Scott, that Lee announced his momentous decision, and its tone well indicated what the parting cost him.   \"Arlington, Va., April 20, 1861.  \"General:  \"Since my interview with you on the 18th inst., I have felt that I ought not longer to retain my commission in the army. I, therefore, tender my resignation, which I request you will recommend for acceptance. It would have been presented at once but for the struggle it has cost me to separate myself from a service to which I have devoted the best years of my life and all the ability I possessed. During the whole of that time...I have experienced nothing but kindness from my superiors and a most cordial friendship from my comrades. To no one, General, have I been as much indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and consideration.... Save in the defense of my native State, I never desire again to draw my sword.\"   Lee was fully aware of the serious nature of the conflict in which the country was about to engage. Americans were to be pitted against Americans and he knew what that meant. Wise men, both North and South, were prophesying that the war would not last more than ninety days, and foolish ones were bragging of their own powers and questioning the courage of their opponents, quite oblivious of the adage that when Greek meets Greek there comes a tug of war. But Lee did not concern himself with such childish exhibitions of judgment and temper.  \"Do not put your faith in rumors of adjustment,\" he wrote his wife before serious fighting had begun. \"I see no prospect of it. It cannot be while passions on both sides are so infuriated. MAKE YOUR PLANS FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF WAR. I agree with you that the inflammatory articles in the papers do us much harm. I object particularly to those in the Southern papers, as I wish them to take a firm, dignified course, free from bravado and boasting. The times are indeed calamitous. The brightness of God's countenance seems turned from us. It may not always be so dark and He may in time pardon our sins and take us under his protection.\"  Up to this time his son Custis, who had graduated first in his class at West Point, was still in the service of the United States as a lieutenant in the Engineers and of him Lee wrote to his wife in the same comradely spirit that he had always shown toward his boys. \"Tell Custis he must consult his own judgment, reason and conscience, as to the course he may take. The present is a momentous question which every man must settle for himself, and upon principle. I do not wish him to be guided by my wishes or example. If I have done wrong let him do better.\"  Virginia was not slow in recognizing that she had within her borders the soldiers whom the chief general of the United States described as the greatest military genius in America, and within three days of his resignation from the old army, Lee was tendered the command of all the Virginia troops. Convinced that the brunt of the heavy fighting would fall on his native state, to whose defense he had dedicated his sword, he accepted the offer and thus there came to the aid of the Confederacy one of the few really great commanders that the world has ever seen.     Chapter XII. -- Opening Moves   It was to no very agreeable task that Lee was assigned at the outset of his command. The forces of the Confederacy were even less prepared to take the field than those of the United States, and for three months Lee was hard at work organizing and equipping the army for effective service. This important but dull duty prevented him from taking any active part in the first great battle of the War at Bull Run (July 21, 1861), but it was his rare judgment in massing the troops where they could readily reënforce each other that enabled the Confederate commanders on that occasion to form the junction which resulted in the overwhelming defeat of the Union army. This fact was well recognized by the authorities and, when the situation in western Virginia assumed a threatening aspect, he was ordered there with the highest hopes that he would repeat the success of Bull Run and speedily expel the Union forces from that part of the state.  A more unpromising field of operation than western Virginia could scarcely have been selected for the new commander. The people of that region generally favored the Union, and the Federal troops had already obtained possession of the strongest positions, while some of the Confederate commanders were quarreling with each other and otherwise working at cross purposes. For a time, therefore, Lee had to devote himself to smoothing over the differences which had arisen among his jealous subordinates, but when he at last began an aggressive movement, bad weather and a lack of coöperation between the various parts of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40993"],["title","Spacewrecked on Venus (#0)"],["body","on Venus                           By NEIL R.

There will     be the terrible climatic conditions on other worlds to be faced,     strange beasts and plants; and perhaps desperate and greedy men.     That was the case when every new land was opened on earth and it may     be expected to be true when we conquer the solar planets.      Mr. Jones understands these things well. His vivid imagination, his     sense of a good story and his knowledge of what may be expected upon     other worlds combine to make this a novel and exciting yarn. And, as     is always desired, it comes to a smashing finish with a surprising     ending.      His scientific weapons are quite novel, but so realistically does he     portray them, that they strike one as being quite possible and     likely to be used at some future time.         *       *       *       *       *  I stood looking from the space ship into the dense fog banks which rolled about us. We were descending through the dense cloud blanket of Venus. How near we actually were to the ground I did not know. Nothing but an unbroken white haze spread mistily, everywhere I looked.  With jarring suddenness, a terrific shudder throbbed the length of the _C-49_, rattling the loose articles on the desk nearby. The dictatyper, with which I had lately been composing a letter, crashed violently to the floor. I reeled unsteadily to the door. It was nearly flung open in my face.  \"Hantel!\"  Captain Cragley steadied himself on the threshold of my room. The captain and I had become intimate friends during the trip from the earth. In his eyes I saw concern.  \"What's wrong?\" I queried.  \"Don't know yet! Come--get out of there, man! We may have to use the emergency cylinder!\"  I followed Cragley. The crew, numbering seven, were gathered in the observation chamber. Most of the passengers were there too.  The _C-49_ carried twelve passengers, all men, to the Deliphon settlement of Venus. In the earlier days of space travel, few women dared the trip across space.  Several of the crew worked feverishly at the controls above the instrument board.  \"What's our altitude?\" demanded Cragley.  \"Fifteen thousand feet!\" was the prompt reply. \"Our drop is better than a hundred feet a second!\"  Worried wrinkles creased the kindly old face of Captain Cragley. He debated the issue not one moment.  \"Into the emergency cylinder--everybody!\"  Herding the passengers ahead of them, Cragley's men entered a compartment shaped like a long tube, ending in a nose point. When we were buckled into a spiral of seats threading the cylinder, Cragley pulled the release lever. Instantly, the cylinder shot free of the doomed _C-49_. For a moment we dropped at a swifter pace than the abandoned ship. After that, our speed of descent was noticeably decreased.  Peering at the proximity detector, Cragley announced that we were quite safe from a collision. The _C-49_ was far below us and dropping fast.  \"No danger now,\" he assured the passengers. \"We'll come down like a feather. Then all we have to do is radio Deliphon to send out a ship for us.\"  Cragley was equal to the situation. In this year of 2342, when the days of pioneer space flying were commencing to fade into history, it required capable men to cope with interplanetary flight. If Cragley brought his crew and passengers safely through this adversity and also salvaged the valuable cargo of the _C-49_, it was another feather in his cap.  Quentin, second to Cragley in command, labored over the sending apparatus. Quentin looked up at his superior officer with an uneasy expression. The captain was quick to sense trouble.  \"What's wrong?\"  \"I don't like the looks of this,\" was Quentin's reply. \"The sender refuses to function properly. I can do nothing with it.\"  Cragley's face bore a troubled look. He stepped to the side of his subordinate for a hasty inspection of the radio sender.  \"The receiver plate doesn't light up, either,\" said Quentin. \"Looks to me as though someone has been tampering with this.\"  In their spiral of seats, the passengers looked silently and gravely upon the cylinder base where Cragley and his staff were gathered over the apparatus. A dull glow of cloudy light coming in through the transparent interstices of the descending cylinder softened and counteracted the glow of the radium lights. An intangible feeling of depression hung in the air.  \"Elevation, five hundred feet!\" announced one of the crew from his position at the altitude dial.  \"Make a landing,\" ordered Cragley. \"We can't be very far from where the _C-49_ fell. If there's enough of the ship left, we may be able to discover the cause of this accident.\"  Down through the lush vegetation, the cylinder felt its way, dropping very slowly. Finally it came to rest on a knoll.  \"How far are we from the ship?\" queried the captain.  \"About seventeen hundred feet south of it, I'd say.\"  \"We'll go outside and get organized. We've got to get that platinum shipment off the _C-49_ and get into communication with headquarters at Deliphon somehow. The proximity detector tells us we're over two hundred miles from there.\"  One of the passengers spoke up with a suggestion. \"Can't we go the rest of the way in this? You can send back for what's left of the ship. I've an important reason for arriving in Deliphon quickly. If--\"  \"Not a chance,\" cut in Cragley, both amused and annoyed. \"The cylinder wouldn't take us anywhere. All the cylinder is good for is an emergency descent. It has no driving power.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Preparations were made for a trip to the wrecked space ship.  \"Might I go with you and the men, Captain?\" I ventured.  \"Sure, Hantel, come along! I'll have to leave part of the crew here with the passengers and the cylinder, so I'm glad to have a few volunteers.\"  \"Count on me, then,\" another of the passengers spoke up.  I recognized him as Chris Brady. He was a man about my own age, possibly younger, perhaps in his late twenties. Brady and I had become friends during the trip, having spent many hours together. This was my second trip to the clouded planet. Brady had made many trips to Venus, spending considerable time among the colonies. I had learned much about the man which had interested me.  Our party consisted of Cragley, Brady, three of the crew, four other passengers and myself. Well armed, we set out through the yellow jungle in search of the remains of the _C-49_. Quentin insisted that it was not far away according to the proximity detector which was especially attuned to the bulk and metal composition of the space ship.  Progress was difficult in spots, and we found it necessary to hack our way through lush growths of vegetation, taking numerous detours around interlaced verdure. We were out of sight of the cylinder almost immediately.  One of the passengers who had volunteered to accompany us complained at the prospects of becoming lost. Cragley calmed the man's anxiety with a brief explanation of the directometer he carried. It was an elaborate perfection of the old compass. On a square plate, our position was always designated in relation to the _C-49_. By telescopic condensation of the field, Cragley was capable of bringing Deliphon on the instrument. It was well over two hundred miles beyond us.  \"If Quentin doesn't have that televisor fixed by the time we get back, we are in a jam.\"  \"There's the ship!\"  We looked where the pointing arm of Brady designated. The wrecked space ship lay imbedded in the murky waters of a swamp, fully one-third of its bulk out of sight. Above, the torn and tangled mass of vegetation bore witness to the rapid descent of the craft. Mighty branches were torn away from giant trees. The ship itself was enwrapped by interlaced creepers which it had ripped loose from the upper foliage.  We waded through warm, stagnant water which teemed with marine life. We were halfway to the side of the _C-49_ when a cry from behind startled me into action. I turned and stared into the gaping jaws of a terrifying serpent wriggling through the shallow water on many legs. Several electric pistols flashed almost simultaneously. The loathesome monster turned belly up, floating dead upon the surface of the swamp water.  From then on, we advanced more cautiously. Coming alongside the crushed hull of the interplanetary liner, we made an inspection of its position. The space ship lay nearly right side up, the decks slanting a bit sharply to one side. Upon the outer deck of the _C-49_, Cragley scratched his head and looked the situation over.  \"Not so bad as I'd feared,\" was his comment. \"Wouldn't be much else but junk here if it hadn't been for the jungle breaking the fall.\" Cragley pointed upward to the strong barrier of interlaced foliage. \"I hope to discover just why it was we fell.\"  \"Wasn't there an explosion?\" I inquired. \"There was a great shock just before you opened the door to my stateroom. For a moment I thought we'd struck the planet.\"  \"Yes--there was an explosion,\" Cragley replied, a bit reluctant to voice the admission. \"It occurred somewhere in the mechanism operating our radium repellors. That's why the ship started falling. Its weight was left partly free against the gravity of Venus. We had to leave so quickly there was no time for inspection.\"  One by one, we descended into the wrecked _C-49_. In that part of the ship which lay lowest"]]]
