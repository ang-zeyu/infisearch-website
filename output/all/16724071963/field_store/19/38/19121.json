The movement made the man groan, and presently he opened his eyes for an instant.  \"Oh, what a fall!\" he murmured, and then relapsed into unconsciousness again.  \"We'll have to get him down from here and try to do something for him,\" announced Andy. \"He has a bad cut behind his left ear. I can't do anything for him up here--it's too slippery.\"  \"Can't you climb down the tree with him? I'll hold it steady.\"  \"I'll try it.\"  Andy made his preparations with care, for what he proposed to attempt was difficult and dangerous. A tumble to the rocks at the foot of the cliff might mean broken limbs, if not worse.  With care he raised the unconscious form up and placed it over his shoulder. Then he turned around, and, inch by inch, felt his way out on the sapling.  \"I'm coming!\" he called. \"Hold it, Chet, or we'll both come down!\"  \"I'll hold it,\" was the confident reply.  Gripping the knees of the man with his left hand, Andy held on to the sapling with his right. Stepping and sliding, he came down slowly. The young tree bent and threatened once to slip to one side, but Chet braced it with all his strength. In a minute more Andy was down, and had stretched the man out on the snow. The boy was panting from his exertions.  \"I suppose we ought to have a doctor for him,\" said Chet, as he made an examination of the unfortunate one's wounds. \"But I don't know of any around here.\"  \"Nor do I. We can't leave him here,--he'll freeze to death. Where do you suppose we ought to take him?\"  \"I don't know of a single place within a mile,--and I don't suppose we ought to carry him as far as that. He may be hurt inside, and if he is, it won't do to move him too much.\"  Much perplexed by the situation which confronted them, the two boys talked the matter over. It was so cold at the foot of the cliff that to remain there was out of the question. At last Chet suggested moving to a clump of pine trees, where they might fix up some sort of temporary shelter and build a fire. They picked up their guns and the belongings of the man, and Chet took the unfortunate over his shoulder. He groaned several times, but did not speak or open his eyes.  \"He is certainly hurt quite seriously,\" said Andy. \"I hope he doesn't die on our hands.\"  \"Do you know his name, or where he comes from?\"  \"No, but I guess we can find that out by looking in his pockets. He must have cards or a notebook, or something.\"  \"He looks as if he was well off. That gun is an A No. 1 piece.\"  \"Yes, and look at the fine clothing he is wearing.\"  It was a hard walk, and they had to take turns in carrying the unconscious man. To add to the gloom of the situation, it now commenced to snow again.  Presently they reached a spot that looked good to them. There were a series of rocks to the northward, backed up by a thick growth of pines. At the foot of the rocks grew some brushwood.  Chet had calculated to spend some time hunting, and had with him a hatchet, with which to cut firewood. In a very few minutes he had cut out some of the brushwood, leaving a cleared space about eight feet square. Over the top of the cleared space he threw some saplings and pine branches, and then \"wove in\" pine branches around the sides. By this means he soon had a shelter ready, which, while it was by no means air-tight, was a great deal better than nothing. On the floor of the shelter he placed other pine branches, and there he and Andy made the suffering man as comfortable as possible. As soon as they had reached the spot, Andy had started up a fire, right in front of the opening, and this now gave out a warmth that was much appreciated.  With some warm water made from melted snow, the lads washed the wounds of the man, and then bound them up with strips torn from their shirts. They used other water for making coffee, and poured some of this down the man's throat. They also rubbed his hands and wrists, doing what they could think of to revive him.  In the meantime the snow continued to come down, lightly at first, and then so thickly that the entire landscape around the shelter was blotted out.  \"It's going to be a corker of a storm,\" announced Chet, as he gazed out.  \"I can't see a thing anywhere,\" was Andy's answer. \"Wonder how long it will last.\"  \"Several hours, maybe.\"  \"I don't see how we are going to get a doctor to come here while it is like this.\"  \"Better not try to find one. If you go out, you may lose your way.\"  They replenished the fire, and cut a good stock of wood, and then sat down to watch the man. In one of his pockets they found a card-case.  \"His name is Barwell Dawson,\" announced Andy, \"and he comes from Brooklyn.\"  \"What business is he in?\"  \"It doesn't say.\"  That the stranger was rich was quite evident. He wore a fine gold watch and chain, and an elegant diamond ring. In one pocket he had a wallet filled with bills of large denomination.  \"He is one of your high-toned sportsmen,\" announced Chet. \"Some of 'em come up to Maine every fall to hunt.\"  \"It's a wonder he didn't have a guide, Chet.\"  \"Oh, some of 'em think they can do better without one.\"  Suddenly the man opened his eyes wide, stared around for a moment, and then sat up. The change was so unexpected that the boys were amazed.  \"Where--Who are you?\" he stammered.  \"You've had a bad fall--came down over the cliff,\" answered Andy.  \"What? Oh, yes, so I did. I--I----\" The man felt of his head. \"Why, I'm all bandaged up!\"  \"You got cut pretty badly,\" said Chet. \"We're wondering if you broke any bones.\"  \"Yes?\" The man gave a little groan. \"I'm hurt, that's sure. Oh!\" And then he put his hand to his side.  \"You had better keep quiet for a while,\" said Andy, gently. \"It won't do you any good to stir around. We'd get a doctor, only it's snowing so we're afraid we might miss the trail.\"  \"Snowing? It wasn't snowing when I fell.\"  \"That was nearly two hours ago.\"  \"And I've been knocked out all that time?\" The man fell back on the pine boughs. \"No wonder I feel so broken up.\"  He closed his eyes, and the boys thought he was going to faint. Chet got some more coffee.  \"Here, drink this, it will do you good,\" he said, and placed the tin cup to the sufferer's lips. The man gulped down the beverage, and it seemed to give him a little strength. Presently he sat up again.  \"Did you two see me take the tumble?\" he questioned, with a weak attempt at a smile.  \"I saw you,\" answered Andy. \"You didn't come all the way over the cliff. You struck a ledge and hung there, and we got you down and brought you here.\"  \"I see.\"  \"We were afraid some of your bones were broken,\" put in Chet. \"Are they?\"  \"I don't know.\" Slowly the man moved his arms and his legs. He winced a little.  \"All right but my left ankle,\" he announced. \"I reckon that got a bad twist. Beats the Dutch, doesn't it?\" he added, with another attempt at a smile.  \"It's too bad,\" returned Andy.  \"No, you don't understand. I mean my coming to Maine to do a little quiet hunting, and then to get knocked out like this. Why, I've hunted all over this globe,--the West, India, Africa, and even in the Arctic regions--and hardly got a scratch. I didn't think anything could happen to me on a quiet little trip like this.\"     CHAPTER VI  A WORLD-WIDE HUNTER   The two boys listened to the man's words with keen interest. He had hunted in the wild West, in India, Africa, and even in the Arctic regions! Surely he was a sportsman out of the ordinary.  \"You're like old Tom Casey,\" said Andy. \"He fought the forest fires here for years, and never got singed, and then went home one day and burnt his arm on a red-hot stove. I hope the ankle isn't bad.\"  \"I can't tell about that until I stand on it. Give me a lift, will you?\"  Both boys helped the man to his feet. He took a couple of steps, and was then glad enough to return to the pine couch.  \"It's no use--I can't walk, yet,\" he murmured.  \"Do you think you need a doctor?\" asked Chet.  \"Hardly--although I'd call him in if he was handy. I'm pretty tough, although I may not look it. Who are you?\"  \"My name is Chet Greene, and this is a friend of mine, Andy Graham.\"  \"I am glad to know you, and very thankful for what you have done for me. I'll make it right with you when I'm able to get around. My name is Dawson--Barwell Dawson. I'm a traveler and hunter, and occasionally I write articles for the magazines--hunting articles mostly.\"  \"Oh, are you the man who once wrote a little book about bears--how they really live and what they do, and all that?\" cried Andy.  \"Yes, I'm the same fellow.\"  \"I've got that book at home--you once gave it to my father, when I was about eight years old.\"  \"Is that so? I don't remember it.\"  \"My father was up on the Penobscot, lumbering. He went out with you into the woods and you found a honey tree. You gave him the book for his little boy--that was me.\"  \"Oh, yes, I remember it now!\" cried Barwell Dawson. \"So that was your father. How is he?\"  \"My father is dead,\" answered Andy, and his voice dropped a little.  \"Indeed! I am sorry to hear it. And your mother?\"  \"She is dead, too.\"  \"Then you are alone in the world? Do you live near?\"  \"I live two miles from Pine Run, with an uncle. It was I who told you how to get to Moose Ridge, when you were driving on the wrong road.\"  \"Oh, yes, I thought I had seen you somewhere.\"  Here the conversation lapsed, for Barwell Dawson was still weak. He lay back and closed his eyes, and the boys did not disturb him.  It continued to snow, until the fresh fall covered the old to the depth of several inches. The boys kept the campfire going, and cooked such game as they had brought along.  \"We are booked to stay here for a while, that's certain,\" observed Chet. \"No Lodgeport today.\"  After a while Barwell Dawson sat up again, and gladly partook of the food offered to him. His injuries consisted of a hard shaking up, a bruised ankle, and several cuts on his head.  \"I am thankful that no bones are broken, and that I did not get killed,\" he said,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38968"],["title","First at the North Pole; Or, Two Boys in the Arctic Circle (#6)"],["body","then he requested them to give the details of the rescue from the ledge. The boys related their story, to which he listened closely.  \"It was fine of you to get me down,\" he declared. \"Fine! I'll have to reward you.\"  \"I don't want any reward,\" answered Andy, promptly.  \"Nor do I,\" added Chet.  \"Well, you ought to let me do something for you,\" persisted the one who had been rescued.  \"You might tell us of some of your hunting adventures,\" said Andy, with a smile. \"I'd like to hear about hunting in the far West and other places.\"  \"So would I,\" added Chet. \"If I had the money, I'd like to do like you have done, travel all over the world and hunt.\" And his eyes glistened with anticipation.  \"What do you do now?\"  \"Nothing at present. We can't get an opening at any of the lumber camps.\"  \"I understand business is very dull this season.\"  After that Barwell Dawson asked for more particulars concerning the boys, and they told him how they were situated. He was surprised to learn that Chet was practically alone in the world.  \"It is certainly hard luck,\" he said, kindly. \"You must let me do something for you.\"  Then, after his ankle had been bathed in hot water, and bound up, the hunter and traveler told them of his trips to various portions of the globe, and how he had hunted deer and moose in one place, bears and mountain lions in another, and tigers and other wild beasts elsewhere. He had two very interested listeners.  \"It must be great!\" murmured Chet. \"Oh, that would suit me down to the ground--to go out that way!\"  \"I have made one trip to the north,\" continued Barwell Dawson, \"and I am soon going to make another.\"  \"You mean to Canada?\" queried Andy.  \"Not exactly. I am going to Greenland, and then into the polar regions. I want to hunt seals, polar bears, and musk oxen.\"  \"You'll be frozen to death!\"  \"Hardly,\" answered the hunter. \"On my previous trip I stood the cold very well, and this time I shall go much better prepared. Somehow, I like hunting in the Arctic Circle better than hunting anywhere else. Besides, I wish to--But never mind that now,\" and Barwell Dawson broke off rather abruptly. Then he told a story of a hunt after polar bears that made Chet's eyes water.  \"That's the stuff!\" whispered Chet to Andy. \"That beats a deer hunt all hollow!\"  \"Yes, provided the polar bear doesn't eat you up.\"  \"Huh! I'd not be afraid. I don't believe a polar bear is any more dangerous than a moose.\"  \"I saw a moose just before I had the tumble,\" said Barwell Dawson. \"I climbed up the cliff after him, but I couldn't get very close. I took two shots at him, but he got away.\"  \"If we are going to be snowed up here we ought to try for some game,\" said Chet. \"Maybe I can stir up some rabbits, or something.\"  It was decided that he should go out, leaving Andy to look after Mr. Dawson and the campfire.  \"But don't go far,\" cautioned Andy. \"The snow is coming down so thick that you may get lost.\"  \"Oh, I'll take care of myself,\" answered Chet.  He knew it would be a bad move to go out into the open, so he kept to the timber, blazing a tree here and there as he went along. He knew very little game would be stirring.  \"If I get anything it will be more accident than anything else,\" he reasoned. \"No animal is going to stir out in this storm.\"  He was just passing under a big spruce tree when, chancing to glance up, he saw a sight that quickened his pulse. On a limb close at hand were several wild turkeys, huddled together to keep warm.  With great caution he moved to one side, to get a good aim. Then, raising his gun, he blazed away. There was a whirr and a flutter, and two of the turkeys came down, one dead and the other wounded. Rushing forward, Chet caught the wounded bird by the neck, and soon put it out of its misery.  \"That's a good start,\" he told himself, with much satisfaction. \"I hope my luck continues.\"  Placing the game in his bag, he went forward again, looking for more signs of birds, and also for signs of squirrels and rabbits.  It was growing dark, and Chet began to think it was time to turn back, when he saw some rabbits in a thick clump of bushes. He sprang in after them, and they leaped out into the snow and across a small opening. Then, before he could fire, they were out of sight again.  \"You shan't get away from me as easily as that,\" the youth muttered to himself, and ran out into the opening. Here the snow was so thick he could see but little, yet he kept on, and soon reached more brushwood. He saw some branches close to the snow move, and blazed away in the dark.  His aim proved true, for when he came up he found one rabbit dead. Another had been wounded, as the blood on the snow showed. In all haste he made after the limping game. But the rabbit had considerable life left in it, and dove deep into the brushwood. But at last it had to give up, and Chet secured the additional game without much trouble.  It had grown dark rapidly, and in some anxiety the young hunter turned back, in an endeavor to retrace his steps. This was no easy matter, for the snow was coming down as thickly as ever, and he could scarcely see two yards ahead of him.  \"It won't do for me to get lost out here,\" he reasoned. \"If I don't get back, Andy will be worried to death.\"  Bending to meet the snow--for the wind was now blowing briskly, Chet pushed forward until another clump of trees was gained. Walking was becoming irksome, and he panted for breath. Under the trees he paused to get his bearings.  \"I must be right,\" he thought. Yet, try his best, he could not locate any of the trees he had blazed a short while before.  Any other lad might have become frightened at the prospect, but Chet was used to being alone, and he simply resolved to move forward with increased caution.  \"If the worst comes, I can fire three shots in succession. Andy will know what that means,\" he reasoned. On previous trips to the woods the boys had arranged that three shots meant, \"I am lost. Where are you?\" A single shot was to be the answer--repeated, of course, as often as necessary.  Another hundred feet were covered, and Chet was looking vainly for one of the blazed trees, when an unexpected sound broke upon his ears.  It was an unusual and uncanny noise, and he stopped short to listen. It came from a clump of spruces to his left.  \"Now, what can that be?\" he asked himself. \"I never heard a noise like that before.\"  He listened, and presently the sound was repeated. To him it seemed as if some unseen giant were in deep distress.  Chet was not superstitious, or he might have thought he heard a ghost. He knew there must be some rational reason for the unusual noise, and he resolved to investigate.  \"Anybody there?\" he cried, as he raised his gun in front of him, and tried to peer through the snow-laden air.  There was no answer, nor was the peculiar sound repeated. With cautious steps he advanced toward the clump of spruces. Underneath all was now as dark as night could make it.  Again he paused, something warning him to be extra cautious. His nerves were now at a high tension, for he felt something unusual was coming.  An instant later it came. Through the snow and darkness Chet caught a momentary gleam of a pair of eyes shining like two balls of fire. Then a bulky form shot out of the darkness, and bumped up against him, hurling him flat. Ere he could arise, the form leaped over him, and went limping off, puffing and snorting as it did so.  \"A moose!\" gasped Chet, as he felt in the snow for his gun. \"And wounded! It must be the one Mr. Dawson tried to get!\"  He thought the big beast was retreating, but soon found out otherwise. The moose was badly wounded, and ugly in the extreme. Around he wheeled, and then came straight for Chet. The lad could not locate his gun, and, feeling his peril, darted for the nearest tree and leaped high up among the branches.     CHAPTER VII  CHET AND THE MOOSE   \"Phew! that was a narrow escape!\"  Such were Chet's words as he drew himself higher up into the tree. The big beast below had come up, and struck the tree a blow that made it shiver from top to bottom. Had he not been holding on tightly the boy would have been hurled down, and at the very feet of the moose.  The animal was full-grown, powerful, and with wide and heavy antlers. He had been wounded in one of the forelegs, but was still able to stand. Now he stood under the spruce, on three legs, gazing up at Chet speculatively.  \"Like to smash me, wouldn't you?\" murmured the youth. \"Well, I guess not--not if I know it!\"  Chet wished with all his heart that he had his gun. But the weapon was out of sight under the snow, and the moose was standing over the spot.  What to do next, the lad did not know. The moose did not show any inclination to leave. He breathed heavily, as if his wound hurt him, but Chet was certain that there was still a good deal of fight in the creature.  \"Perhaps he'll keep me here all night,\" thought the boy, dismally.  Presently an idea came to him to call for help. Andy might hear him, and come up with his gun.  \"That shelter is a long way off, but it won't do any harm to try it,\" Chet reasoned, and expanding his chest, he let out a yell at the top of his lung power. He repeated the cry several times, and then listened with strained ears. No answer came back but the gentle sighing of the rising wind, as it swept through the woods.  \"Huddled inside the shelter, I suppose, to keep warm,\" Chet murmured, dismally. \"I might yell my head off and it wouldn't do a bit of good. I'll have to try something else.\"  What that something else was to be was not clear. He moved from one branch to another to investigate, then a thought struck him, and he resolved to act upon it.  With caution, so as not to attract the attention of the moose, he climbed far out on a branch of the spruce, and thus gained a grip on the wide-spreading limb of another tree. He swung himself to this, and crawling along and past the trunk of the second tree, moved to the end of a"]]]
