He had the old salt's pitying contempt for \"flat-footed landlubbers\". Very many times since the outbreak of war had he been called upon to instruct troops in boat drill, and never had he seen any practical result of his labours. The monotony of imparting boat knowledge into the heads of men who possessed not the slightest inclination towards things nautical irritated him. Forgetting that his instruction classes were composed of men who were not seamen, he was apt to give orders without explaining the precise nature of the various terms he employed, and failure on the part of his audience to follow his deep-sea phrases reduced him to a state of profanity.  The boat selected for the drill was a \"double-ender\" life-boat hanging in the old-fashioned style of davits. The davits were swung inboard, the boat resting on \"chocks\" or hinged pieces of wood shaped to fit the lower strakes of the boat.  \"Now then,\" began the Second Officer. \"In the event of this craft being torpedoed, you men will form the crew of this boat. At a prolonged blast on the syren all hands will come to attention and await orders. At the bugle-call you will throw off coats and boots, put on life-belts--suppose you know by this time _how_ to put 'em on?--and fall in by numbers, facing outboard. We'll take the life-belts for granted.\"  The men received this part of the instruction without emotion. They had heard it many times before.  \"You are bow, and you are stroke,\" continued the Second Mate, addressing two of the men.  \"Stroke the bow-wow, Tommy,\" whispered a wag in an audible aside. \"Now we are getting on. We'll finish up with a bloomin' menagerie.\"  \"Silence, there!\" snapped the instructor. \"Bow and stroke will jump into the boat, see that the plug is inserted, and hook the falls--four hands to man each of the falls. You,\" addressing the would-be humorist, \"will attend to the gripes----\"  \"Should have thought that was a job for the doctor,\" remarked the man _sotto voce_, at which several of the men within hearing began to laugh.  \"This is no laughing matter, you pack of jackanapes,\" bawled the now infuriated ship's officer. \"You'd feel a bit sick if you found yourselves in the ditch through not knowing how to lower away. Now, then, together.\"  Out swung the davits, the task rendered difficult by the roll of the ship, until the boat was ready for lowering.  The Second Mate looked at the surging water, and considered the erratic rolling motion of the lofty hull. To lower away with a practised crew manning the falls would entail a certain amount of risk should the boat surge against the ship's side; with a crowd of raw amateurs the danger was magnified threefold.  \"Good enough!\" he ordered. \"We'll suppose the lowering and hoisting part is done. I'll put you through that another day when there's less sea. Now, stand by.\"  A shrill rasping of chain and an involuntary cry of mingled surprise and apprehension from the two in the boat interrupted the Second Officer's explanation. Accidentally the \"stroke\" had released the after disengaging-gear. The next instant the boat was hanging vertically, held only by the for'ard tackle.  The bowman, making a frantic grab at the upper block of the davit, hung on like grim death until his feet found a hold on the edge of the foremost thwart. The boat, swinging like a gigantic pendulum, was doing her best to stave in her quarter against the ship's side.  The \"stroke\" was not so fortunate. With the release of the gear the lower block dealt him a numbing blow on the shoulder. Unable to grasp any object that might afford security, he fell with considerable force into the sea.  \"Man overboard!\" shouted the Second Officer, and picking up a life-belt he hurled it close to the spot where the luckless fellow had disappeared. Almost at the same time the sentry let fall the patent life-buoy.  For some minutes the rest of the squad were too taken aback by the suddenness of the catastrophe to grasp the situation. The bowman, more scared than hurt, although considerably shaken, clambered out of the boat and gained the deck.  \"Good heavens,\" ejaculated Malcolm, \"the man overboard can't swim a stroke!\" Heedless of the fact that of all the party he was the only one who had not removed his boots, Malcolm ran aft. With a bound he cleared the rail and dived overboard.  Fortunately for him, the _Awarua_ was moving at a comparatively low speed. As it was, in spite of the momentum of his leap, he struck the water obliquely, and with a thud that temporarily winded him.  Coming to the surface, he took in a deep breath of salt-laden air, rubbed the water from his eyes, and looked for the missing man.  On the crest of a roller he espied the rifleman's head and shoulders and outstretched arms. In the interval that had elapsed between the accident and Malcolm's dive the ship had travelled a good hundred yards. Midway between the would-be rescuer and the object of his attentions floated the life-buoy, its position clearly indicated by a cloud of calcium smoke. He could see no sign of the life-belt.  Using a powerful trudgeon stroke, Malcolm started and swam towards the spot where he had caught a momentary glimpse of the man. In less than two dozen strokes he found that his saturated sleeves hampered his arms. His boots, too, were acting as a drag, yet there was no time to tread water and kick them off.  On the crest of the third roller Malcolm again caught sight of the man. He had ceased to struggle and was floating without any apparent motion, his head and shoulders clear of the water.  Changing to breast stroke, Carr slid down the slope of the long roller. Then, as he rose on the succeeding crest, he found that he was within ten yards of the man.  \"Hang it all!\" thought Malcolm as he approached. \"I might have saved myself a job. He's better off than I am. The bounder's wearing a life-saving waistcoat.\"  \"Hallo, Sergeant!\" gurgled the rifleman. \"Did that rotten boat sling you out too? When are they going to pick us up? The water's none too warm. I'm feeling nipped already.\"  \"Oh, it's you, Macready!\" exclaimed Malcolm, recognizing a Canterbury farmer, a fellow of magnificent physique. \"When are they going to pick us up, you ask? Can't say. I rather fancy they'll have to reverse engines and stop before they lower a boat. That will take some time.\"  He waited until he found himself on the crest of a long roller, and then looked in the direction of the _Awarua_. The transport was now nearly two miles away. Whether she had slowed down or was still steaming ahead he could not determine. As far as he could see there were no signs of a boat being lowered.  Macready was certainly right about the low temperature of the sea. Already Carr felt the numbing effect of the water. His fingers as he fumbled with the laces of his boots were practically devoid of feeling.  \"I have one of those air waistcoats,\" explained the man. \"It's only partly filled. Much as I could manage to do, that. I guess there's a tidy drop of water got in while I was blowing. If we can get more wind into the thing it'll support two; at least I hope so. The fellow at the stores said it would.\"  \"Don't trouble on my account,\" said Malcolm. \"I'll swim to the life-buoy and bring it back.\"  The patent life-saving device was still emitting dense clouds of calcium smoke. Provided the expected rescuing-boat made for that there was a good chance of Malcolm and the rifleman being picked up, unless in the meanwhile they were overcome by the acute coldness of the water.  \"Any signs of a boat, Sergeant?\" asked the man, as Malcolm, evidently exhausted by his exertions, pushed the life-buoy before him to within arm's length of his companion in peril.  Malcolm was reluctantly obliged to admit that the probability of rescue from that direction was of a diminishing nature. The _Awarua_ was still holding on her course.  \"Suppose they think that as we were a pair of fools to be slung overboard we aren't worth picking up,\" continued Macready.  Malcolm did not reply. He did not attempt to enlighten the man as to the reason why there were two \"in the ditch\" instead of one. He was also at a loss to explain the apparent callousness of the responsible officer of Transport 99 in not promptly lowering a boat and effecting a speedy rescue.  The two men were too intent upon the disappearing _Awarua_ to notice the approach of the escorting cruiser. The latter was circling round the transport, and was on the point of turning at a distance of a mile astern, when the alert officer of the watch noticed the accident to the boat.  Bringing his telescope to bear upon the _Awarua_, he could see quite clearly the life-boat hanging by the bow tackle only. As he looked he was a distant witness of Sergeant Carr's leap into the sea.  Instinctively he grasped the situation and took prompt measures. At his orders a signalman on the fore bridge set the arms of the semaphore at \"Attention\". When the transport acknowledged the preparatory signal the semaphore began to spell out its message:  \"Carry on; we'll pick up your man.\"  \"Away sea-boat's crew,\" was the next order, and quickly the falls were manned, and the boat, containing her full complement, lowered until the keel was within a few feet of the water. Meanwhile the cruiser's engines had been reversed until her speed diminished five knots.  \"Lower away!\" was the next order.  With a resounding \"smack\" the boat \"landed\" on the crest of a wave. Dexterously the patent releasing-gear was operated, and, carried onward with the momentum imparted by the still-moving cruiser, the sea-boat shot away from the side of her parent.  The order, \"Give way, lads, for all you're worth!\" given by the midshipman in charge, was somewhat unnecessary. At the prospect of saving life every man was pulling his hardest. The sharp bows of the boat literally cleft the water.  \"Way 'nough. In bow,\" ordered the midshipman, a youth of sixteen or seventeen with the assurance of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40073"],["title","A Lively Bit of the Front: A Tale of the New Zealand Rifles on the Western Front (#6)"],["body","barrister.  As neatly as if he were bringing a picket-boat alongside the flagship under the super-critical eye of the admiral, the midshipman steered the boat close to the wellnigh exhausted men. Ready hands lifted Malcolm and Macready into the stern-sheets, and within seven minutes of the first order for the sea-boat to be manned, the two New Zealanders were standing upon the quarter-deck of H.M.S. _Gosport_.     CHAPTER VII  Quits!   \"Take these men to the sick-bay,\" ordered the officer of the watch; \"they both look pretty well knocked up. Semaphore the convoy and report that the men have been picked up. We'll see what's to be done with them later on.\"  After divisions the Commander reported the circumstances to the Captain. The latter, being a chartered humorist, signalled No. 99 to the effect that when boat-lowering practice was again resorted to it would be advisable to provide ring-bolts and securing lashings to prevent the soldiers falling overboard; meanwhile he would make sure of the two he _had_ picked up by keeping them on board the _Gosport_ until her arrival at Port Stanley with the transport under her charge.  Thus Sergeant Malcolm Carr found himself an honorary member of the C.P.O.'s mess on board the _Gosport_, one of the earlier type of \"town\" cruisers detailed for convoying duties in the South Pacific.  Malcolm thoroughly enjoyed the novelty of being on board a war-ship. What struck him most was the good order and discipline that prevailed; everything was \"carried out at the double\", yet there was a total absence of unnecessary noise. Compared with the somewhat boisterous conditions obtaining on board Transport 99, the _Gosport_ was a floating model of smartness and efficiency.  \"Do you know anything about a kangaroo, Sergeant?\" enquired a burly armourer's mate.  It was Thursday--\"make and mend\" afternoon. The ship's company was allowed a period of comparative relaxation. Being fine weather, most of the \"I watch below\" were on deck, sunning themselves upon the raised fo'c'sle.  \"A kangaroo?\" repeated Malcolm cautiously, half suspecting that the man was trying to \"pull his leg\".  \"Yes,\" replied the other, a proper kangaroo. \"You ought to know a lot about them, since they come from down your way.\"  \"I'm afraid you are mistaken,\" said Carr. \"I have seen kangaroos in New Zealand, but they were looked upon as animal curiosities. Why do you ask?\"  \"We've got a kangaroo for a ship's mascot. Had it given us when we were coaling ship at Sydney. The brute is pining. He won't tackle ship's beef or condensed milk. His hay ration's expended, but the cook's keeping him going on biscuit mashed in 'bubbly'. Some of the men suggested cocoa as a change of diet. We thought perhaps, seeing that you were an Anzac, that you Could tell us what's the correct grub for the brute.\"  \"It's want of exercise that's put Panjie off 'is feed, Bill,\" interposed a leading signalman. \"That's what's done it.\"  \"Maybe you're right,\" was the armourer's mate's grudging concession.  \"And if,\" continued the \"bunting-tosser\", carried away by his brilliant brain-wave, \"Panjie was to fall in with the physical-exercise party, an' skip round the ship 'arf a dozen times afore breakfast, I'll allow he'd scoff his 'ard tack without a murmur.\"  In the course of the afternoon a request was forwarded to the Commander that the kangaroo should be allowed on deck for exercise. The paper, marked \"Approved, provided due precautions are taken\", was returned to the members of the \"Mascot Committee\".  Without further delay preparations were made for the kangaroo's course of physical exercise. A space between two of the casemate guns of the starboard side was barricaded off, the officers' practice nets having been loaned for the event.  Practically all the ship's company crowded round to witness the show. Every coign of vantage was packed with interested lower-deck humanity, while from both the fore and after bridges the officers forgathered to watch the performance.  Panjie's cage, carried by half a dozen lusty blue-jackets, was deposited in close proximity to the only opening left in the extensive corral. Not since the eventful day when the _Gosport's_ barbers close-clipped Bingo, the monkey, had such interest been shown in any unofficial incident. Bingo was Panjie's predecessor, a large Madagascar ape. Curiosity concerning a barrel of coal-tar led to Bingo's undoing. Cropping, and afterwards washing the animal with grease and paraffin, were the only remedies, and but temporary; for, shorn of its warm fur, the monkey caught pneumonia and succumbed.  Heralded by the chief keeper, a corporal of Red Marines, the kangaroo leapt lightly into the arena in an attitude reminiscent of a light-weight boxer. It was a half-grown animal of about four feet six inches in height. Apparently indifferent to the grant of limited freedom, it ambled to a recess formed by the side of the casemate and the raised coaming of a closed ammunition-hoist.  \"Put a pair of boxing-gloves on him, Paddy,\" shouted one of the Corporal's shipmates. \"Take him on for half a dozen rounds under the Marquis of Queensberry's rules.\"  \"Enter him for the high jump,\" vociferated another.  \"Take 'im on 'catch as catch can',\" suggested a third.  To all these suggestions the marine turned a deaf ear. He had his own idea of the correct method of exercising the animal and at the same time contributing to his comrades' enjoyment.  \"Now then, you concertina boys, give us a two-step,\" he called out. \"Come on, my lady, let's see if I can span your slender waist.\"  Either the kangaroo objected to the marine's mistake in the matter of gender or else he was disinclined to be forced to perform, for, as the Corporal grasped the animal's short fore paws, Panjie let rip with one of his powerful hind legs. The kangaroo might have been off his feed, but his muscular powers seemed in no way impaired. The sharp claws, missing the man's face by a mere inch, sliced his forage jacket and trousers from shoulder to knee.  At the possibility of a scrap the ship's company cheered, some yelling encouragement to the kangaroo, others backing the representative of His Majesty's jollies.  The outburst of sound terrified the animal. With a stupendous bound Panjie leapt at the netting, ripping his way through as easily as a pantomime clown jumps through a paper hoop. Over the heads and shoulders of a tightly-packed throng of bluejackets the brute vaulted; then, viewing a comparatively clear space, it bounded towards the sacred precincts of the quarter-deck.  Here the Fleet-paymaster and the Engineer-commander, who were keeping aloof from the revels, were engaged in a strictly official conversation. Like a dart Panjie dived betwixt the bowed legs of the accountant officer, and, in blind desperation, butted the senior officer of the engineering branch full in the chest. Then with a terrific leap the kangaroo cleared the rail and disappeared overboard.  There was a rush to the side. Some of the men hastened to man the sea-boat, but the upheld hand of the Commander indicated that they were to \"stand fast\".  The sea was like glass. The usual Pacific roll was entirely absent. A quarter of a mile on the starboard quarter the _Awarua_ was resolutely plugging along at 10 knots.  Bobbing in the wake of the cruiser was a darkbrown object. It was Panjie. The animal had escaped the suction of the propellers, but the fall from a vessel pelting along at 20 knots had evidently stunned it. At all events it made no effort to swim.  No order was given for the _Gosport_ to reverse engines or even to slow down. She merely \"carried on\" describing a vast circle round the slow-moving Transport 99.  \"By Jove, sir!\" exclaimed the Commander, addressing the Captain. \"The _Awarua's_ starboarding helm.\"  \"She is,\" admitted the Skipper grimly. \"We've played into her hands this time, I fancy.\"  The \"owner's\" surmise was correct. Lining the side of the transport were hundreds of troops. Some of them, and several of the _Awarua's_ crew, had provided themselves with running bowlines, and as the unfortunate Panjie drifted close to the ship he was saluted with a shower of lassos.  \"They've hooked him, sir!\" reported the Commander as the kangaroo's limp body, firmly encircled with three or four bowlines, was unceremoniously hauled on board the transport.  \"By the powers they have,\" agreed the Skipper bitterly, and straightway he left the bridge and went below.  Five minutes later the _Awarua's_ semaphore began working rapidly. On the _Gosport's_ bridge a barefooted signalman wrote down the message on a pad. He was unable to conceal a broad grin as he handed the signal to the Commander.  No need for the latter to read the writing. He, in common with nearly all the officers and crew, had read the semaphore verbatim.  With the utmost temerity the skipper of the _Awarua_ had sent the following report:--  \"One of your crew has been picked up by Transport 99. In view of the heavy sea now running\" (_it was a flat calm a regular \"Paddy's hurricane\"_) \"I propose retaining the said member, in order to avoid a repetition of the accident. Do you concur?\"  The message was sent to the captain of the cruiser. Sportsmanlike the skipper accepted the sarcastic signal with a good grace.  Back came the answer: \"Now we are quits! Congratulations!\"     CHAPTER VIII  Left Behind   Seven days behind scheduled time the _Awarua_ crawled into Port Stanley harbour. Here Sergeant Malcolm Carr and Rifleman Macready were received in exchange for Panjie, who, thanks to the store of fodder on board the transport, had been fed into a state of adiposity.  Meanwhile a reserve transport had been sent across from Simon's Bay, and orders were given to tranship the troops, stores, and baggage from No. 99 to No. 109. Within three days the task was accomplished, and, five other troopships having arrived from Australia, the convoy left for Table Bay, still under the care of H.M.S. _Gosport_.  Although"]]]
