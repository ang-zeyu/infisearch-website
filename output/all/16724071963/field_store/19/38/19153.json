To-morrow morning I will return to my uncle, to Friar’s Court, and tell him what you have told me.  I will ask him to allow me to follow von Hardenberg to the West Coast, to keep upon his tracks, to run him to ground and accuse him to his face.  You will come with me.  My uncle will supply us with funds.  He would be willing to spend his entire fortune in order to recover the Sunstone.\"  Harry was so excited that he could scarcely talk coherently.  He paced up and down the little sitting-room—three steps this way and three steps that—and every now and again laid his hands upon Jim Braid and shook him violently to emphasize his words.  When Jim awoke the following morning, he was informed that Mr. Urquhart had left early to go back to Friar’s Court.  He had promised to return the following day.  In the meantime, Harry had given instructions that his landlady was to look after his guest.  If he wanted anything, he had only to ring the bell.  On the afternoon of the second day Harry returned to London.  \"My uncle,\" he explained, \"is inclined to withdraw his verdict, though he will not say openly that he has been guilty of a great injustice. In any case he intends to do everything in his power to get the Sunstone back.  He has given me leave to fit out an expedition. Preparations, however, will take some little time.  I am to be supplied with letters of introduction to several influential persons on the West Coast.  He even said he would come with us himself, were it not that his strength is failing, and he feels he is getting old.  Jim, there’s hope yet, my lad.  You and I together will see this matter through.\"  Braid held out his hand.  \"I can’t thank you sufficiently, sir,\" said he, \"for what you have done! You have saved my life twice, and now you mean to save my reputation.\"  \"Don’t speak of it,\" said Harry.  \"You and I have a great task in front of us; we must stick to each other through thick and thin.  I am impatient to be off.\"  And he had more need of his patience than he thought; for, before they could start upon their journey, war descended upon Europe like a thunderbolt, finding England wholly unprepared.  It was not so with the Germans.  Peter Klein and birds of a like feather had been employed for years in every country liable to prove hostile to the Fatherland.  Germany had for long intended war, and these rascals—paid in proportion to the information they obtained—were living by the score under the protection of the British flag, within sound of Big Ben, in every colony, dependency, and dominion.  Moreover, it has since been proved that the great German Empire did not scruple to employ even her consular and diplomatic servants either as spies themselves or as agents for the purpose of engaging and rewarding informers.  Small wonder, when preparations had been so complete, that Germany had the whip hand at the start, that Belgium, Poland, and Serbia were overrun, and Paris herself saved only at the eleventh hour.  During those early, anxious days, Harry Urquhart was in two minds what to do.  He was wishful to serve his country, and could without difficulty have secured a commission within a few weeks of the declaration of war.  Braid was also willing to enlist.  On talking the matter out, however, with Mr. Langton, it was decided that the quest of the Sunstone was as patriotic a cause as any man could wish for; since, if von Hardenberg succeeded in reaching the Caves of Zoroaster, the wealth that they contained would ultimately find its way to the Fatherland.  But, since there was fighting both in Togoland and the Cameroons, their departure had to be postponed whilst Mr. Langton obtained permission from the War Office authorities for his two protégés to visit the West African scene of operations.  All this took time; and it was not until the beginning of October that young Urquhart and Jim Braid found themselves sitting together in a first-class railway compartment on their way to Southampton.  A few hours afterwards, on a dark windy night, they were on board a ship that rolled and pitched upon its way to Ushant.  The Lizard light flashed good-bye from England, and the dark sea, as they knew quite well, contained hidden dangers in the shape of submarines and mines, but the quest of the Sunstone had begun.     CHAPTER VII—Into the Bush   They experienced rough weather in the Bay of Biscay, where the ship pitched and rolled in a confused sea, and the wind howled round Finisterre, which was wrapped in an impenetrable fog.  Two days afterwards they found the blue waters that bound the Morocco coast, after which the heat became excessive.  The ship was bound first for Sierra Leone, and thence to Old Calabar, from which place they intended to strike inland through the bush, after engaging the services of a party of Kru boys to act as carriers.  On these still tropic seas, dazzling in the sunshine, there was no sign of war, except an occasional torpedo-boat destroyer which flew past them at a speed of thirty knots an hour.  At Sierra Leone, Harry betook himself to a certain gentleman holding an influential position in the Civil Service, to whom he had a letter of introduction from his uncle, and who received the boy with courtesy and kindness.  It was from that Harry learned that the Germans had been driven back in Togoland, and that active operations were in progress in the valley of the Cameroon River.  He himself had travelled far in the interior; and in consequence he was able to give the boy invaluable advice concerning the kit and equipment he would need to take with him upon his expedition.  He advised him to strike into the bush from Old Calabar, where he could procure servants and guides; if he went to Victoria he would find his hands tied by those in command of the Expeditionary Force, who had no liking for civilians at the front.  \"All the same,\" he added, \"I strongly advise you not to endeavour to enter Maziriland.\"  Harry smiled.  \"I am afraid, sir,\" said he, \"I have no option.  My duty takes me there.\"  \"Of course,\" said the other, \"I don’t know what this duty may be, but I tell you frankly the country is by no means safe.  All the natives are in arms, some purchased by rum by the Germans, others loyal to us.  In the old days the Cameroon kings implored the British Government to take the country under its protection.  In their own words, they wanted English laws.  But the Government took no notice of them until it was too late, until the Germans had forestalled us and taken possession of the country, by buying over the chiefs.  If you go into the bush, you run into a thousand dangers: yellow fever, malaria, even starvation, and the natives you encounter may sell you as prisoners to the Germans. Some of them will do anything for drink.\"  Harry explained that he was prepared to take the gravest risks, since the object of his journey was of more than vital importance, and shortly afterwards took his leave, returning to the ship.  They had brought with them all they needed in the way of provisions, clothing, arms and ammunition; and at Old Calabar they purchased a canoe and engaged the services of six stalwart Kru boys.  Harry’s idea was to travel up-river, crossing the Cameroon frontier west of Bamenda, and thence striking inland towards the mountains in northern German territory, beyond which the Caves of Zoroaster were said to be.  They also interviewed an interpreter, a half-caste Spaniard from Fernando Po, who assured them he could speak every native dialect of the Hinterland, from Lagos to the Congo, as well as English and German. This proved to be no exaggeration.  Urquhart was assured that the man was indeed a wonderful linguist, and, moreover, that he could be trusted implicitly as a guide—the more so since he hated the Germans, who had destroyed his ’factory’ to make room for a house for a Prussian Governor, who had hoped to rule the West Coast native with the iron discipline of Potsdam.  This man—who called himself \"Fernando\" after the place of his birth—said that he would never venture across the Cameroons to Maziriland unless his brother was engaged to come with him.  He explained that this brother of his was younger and more agile than himself.  Before they became traders they had been hunters, in the old days when the West Coast was practically unexplored, and they had worked together hand-in-glove.  Accordingly, it was agreed that both brothers should join the expedition; and when they presented themselves before Harry Urquhart, the young Englishman could hardly refrain from smiling at their personal appearance.  They were plainly half-castes, and, like most such, considered themselves Europeans, though neither had ever set eyes upon the northern continent.  Though they were almost as black of skin as a Kru boy, they wore large pith helmets, suits of white ducks and blue puttees, being dressed to a button exactly the same.  Both wore brown leather belts from which depended revolver holsters and cartridge pouches.  The one was robust, wrinkled, broad of chest, and upright; the other, stooping, tall, and abnormally thin.  There was a business-like air about them both that appealed to Harry; and this favourable impression was by no means dispelled when the brothers, in quite tolerable English, raved against the Germans, who, they swore, had bought the Cameroons with rum, in order to manage the country to their own profit without regard to the welfare of the natives.  It was owing to the German occupation of the Cameroons that Fernando and his brother—who went by the name of Cortes—had been ruined by the State-aided German factories that had sprung up as if by magic in the early ’nineties.  Later, they had been accused of inciting the natives to rebellion, heavily fined, and banished from the country.  This increase in numbers necessitated the purchase of a second canoe. Before leaving Calabar they supplemented their commissariat with a new supply of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39185"],["title","Across the Cameroons: A Story of War and Adventure (#7)"],["body","; and, a few days after, it was a small but well-equipped and dauntless expedition that set forth up-river in the sweltering heat, making straight for the heart of the great West African bush and the very stronghold of the enemy’s position.     CHAPTER VIII—Danger Ahead   Three weeks later they camped on the river bank not many miles from the German frontier.  The heat was terribly oppressive.  Thousands of insects droned about their ears.  A thick mist hung upon the river like a poison-cloud.  They were in the very depths of the great White Man’s Grave.  Four days afterwards Fernando deemed it advisable to leave the river valley, and unloading the canoes—which they hid in a mangrove swamp—they began their journey through the bush.  It would be tedious to describe in detail the long weeks that followed or the hardships they had to undergo.  One by one the Kru boys deserted them, to find their own way back to the coast.  But both Cortes and Fernando proved loyal to the hilt, and eventually the party came out from the jungle upon the high ground in the central part of the colony.  The country here was savage, inhospitable, and bleak.  There was little vegetation save rank mountain grass and withered shrubs in sheltered places.  Day by day they advanced with the utmost caution, giving native villages a wide berth and always on the look-out for an ambuscade.  Fernando proved himself to be an excellent cook, whereas his younger brother prided himself upon his skill as a runner.  It was his custom on the line of march to jump fallen trees and brooks.  In these higher altitudes there was a plenitude of game, whereas in the bush they had been near to starving, and one morning they were crossing a spur of a great cloud-wrapped mountain when Cortes, who had been walking about fifty yards in advance of Harry and Jim, dropped suddenly upon his face, and motioned the two boys to do the same.  They had no idea as to what had happened, and suspected that the guide had sighted a party of the enemy.  Crawling on hands and knees, they drew level with the man.  \"Goat,\" said he, pointing towards the mountain.  And there, sure enough, was a species of mountain goat with his great horns branching from the crown of his shaggy head.  \"Come,\" said the man to Harry; \"you shoot.\"  They could not afford to let the beast escape.  The flesh of all the wild goats, though perhaps not so good as that of the wild sheep, is by no means unwelcome when one must journey far from civilization in the wilds of the African hills.  Harry adjusted his sights to six hundred yards, and then, drawing in a deep breath, took long and careful aim.  Gently he pressed the trigger, the rifle kicked, there came a sharp report, and the bullet sped upon its way.  On the instant the beast was seen galloping at breakneck speed down what seemed an almost perpendicular cliff.  \"Missed!\" cried Harry.  \"No,\" said Cortes.  \"He’s hit—he’s wounded.  He will not go far.\"  For a few minutes the members of the party held a hurried consultation. Finally it was decided that Fernando should go on ahead with the camp kit and cooking-utensils, whilst the younger brother accompanied Harry and Jim in pursuit of the wounded goat.  They agreed to meet at nightfall at a place known to the brothers.  It took them nearly an hour to scramble across the valley, to reach the place where the animal had been wounded.  There, as the guide had predicted, there were drops of blood upon the stones.  All that morning they followed the spoor, and about two o’clock in the afternoon they sighted the wounded beast, lying down in the open.  He was still well out of range, and, unfortunately for them, on the windward side.  That meant they would have to make a detour of several miles in order to come within range.  For three hours they climbed round the wind, all the time being careful not to show themselves, for the eyes of the wild goat are like those of the eagle.  With its wonderful eyesight, its still more wonderful sense of smell, and its ability to travel at the pace of a galloping horse across rugged cliffs and valleys, it is a prize that is not easily gained.  When they last saw the animal it was lying down in the same place.  They were then at right angles to the wind, about two miles up the valley.  From this point, on the advice of Cortes, they passed into another valley to the west.  Here there was no chance of being seen or winded by the beast; and, since it was now possible to walk in an upright position, they progressed more rapidly.  When they had arrived at the spot which the guide judged was immediately above the wounded animal they climbed stealthily up the hill.  On the crest-line they sought cover behind great boulders, which lay scattered about in all directions as if they had been hurled down from the skies. Lying on their faces, side by side, Harry with his field-glasses to his eyes, they scanned the valley where they had left their quarry.  Not a sign of it was to be seen.  The thing had disappeared as mysteriously as if it had been spirited away.  \"He’s gone!\" said Harry, with a feeling of bitter disappointment.  He was about to rise to his feet, but the half-caste held him down by force.  \"Don’t get up;\" he cried.  \"Lie still!  There are men in the valley yonder.\"  \"Men!  Have you seen them?\"  \"No, I have not seen them,\" said Cortes.  \"But the beast saw them, or got their wind.  Otherwise he would not have gone.\"  \"It’s von Hardenberg, perhaps!\" said Harry, turning to Braid, the wish being father to the thought.  Both looked at their guide.  \"It is either the man you want,\" said the guide, \"or else it is the Germans.\"  The wounded animal was now forgotten.  They were face to face with the reality of their situation.  They had either overtaken von Hardenberg and Peter Klein or else the Germans had received news of their having reached the frontier.  \"We’ll have to cross the valley,\" said Harry, \"to get back to camp.\"  \"That is the worst of it,\" said Cortes; \"we must rejoin my brother.  He will be awaiting us.\"  He had learnt his English on the Coast.  He spoke the language well, but with the strange, clipped words used by the natives themselves, though the man was half a Spaniard.  \"How are we to get there?\" asked Jim.  The guide looked at the sun.  \"It is too late,\" said he, \"to go by a roundabout way.  We must walk straight there.  There are many things which cause me to believe that danger is close at hand.\"  \"What else?\" asked Harry, who already was conscious that his heart was beating quickly.  \"Late last night I saw smoke on the mountains.  This morning, before we started, my brother thought he heard a shot, far in the distance. Also,\" he added, \"during the last three days we have seen very little game. Something has scared them away.\"  \"Come,\" said Harry.  \"We waste time in words.  As it is, we have barely time to get back before nightfall.\"  As he said this he rose to his feet, and the moment he did so there came the double report of a rifle from far away in the hills, and a bullet cut past him and buried itself in the ground, not fifteen paces from his feet.  \"Down,\" cried the guide, \"for your life!\"     CHAPTER IX—The Captive   Harry was not slow to obey.  He fell flat upon his face, whilst a second bullet whistled over his head.  \"Come,\" said Cortes; \"we must escape.\"  As he uttered these words, he turned upon his heel and ran down the hill, followed by the two boys.  The man held himself in a crouching position until he was well over the crest-line.  Then he stopped and waited for his companions.  \"Who is it?\" asked Braid, already out of breath as much from excitement as from running.  \"The Germans.  They are on our track.\"  \"You are sure of that?\" asked Harry.  \"Master,\" said Cortes, \"it is not possible to mistake a German bullet. In this part of the world only those natives carry rifles who are paid by Kaiser Wilhelm.\"  Indeed, for weeks already, they had been in the heart of the enemy’s country.  The elder guide was some miles away, and, since they could not cross the valley, they would have to make a detour; which meant that they could not possibly rejoin Fernando before nightfall.  By then, for all they knew, they might find him lying in his own blood, their provisions and their reserve ammunition stolen.  Harry looked at Cortes, who seemed to be thinking, standing at his full height, his fingers playing with his chin.  \"We must not desert your brother,\" said the boy.  \"I am thinking,\" said the guide, \"it will be easier for him to reach us than for you and your friend to go to him.  My brother and I are hunters; we can pass through the bush in silence; we can travel amid the rocks like snakes.  I could cross that valley crawling on my face, and the eye of an eagle would not see me.  As for you, you are Englishmen; you have not lived your lives in the mountains and the bush; you do not understand these things.\"  He said this with some scorn in his voice.  There was something about the man—despite his European clothes—that was fully in keeping with the aspect of their surroundings, which were savage, relentless, and cruel.  He went on in a calm voice, speaking very slowly:  \"In this valley we are safe,\" said he.  \"I know the country well. Yonder,\" and he pointed to the north, \"there is a forest that lies upon the hill-side like a mantle.  I will guide you.  It will take us about two hours to get there.  Then I will leave you.  You will be quite safe; for many of the trunks of the trees are hollow, and should the Germans come, you can hide.  I will go alone to my brother and bring him back with me.\"  They set forward without delay, sometimes climbing, sometimes walking, on the mountain-side.  About four o’clock in the afternoon they sighted the forest of which the man had spoken.  It opened out into a mangrove swamp, thousands of feet below them, where the heat hung like a fog.  Among the trees they found themselves in a kind of twilight.  By then the sun was"]]]
