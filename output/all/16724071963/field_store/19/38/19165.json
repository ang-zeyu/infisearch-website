[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39308"],["title","Walks in Rome (#3)"],["body","the country round Rome, beyond a few of the most ordinary drives and excursions outside the walls. The opening of the railways to Naples and Civita Vecchia have now brought a vast variety of new excursions within the range of a day's expedition--and the papal citadel of Anagni, the temples of Cori, the cyclopean remains of Segni, Alatri, Norba, Cervetri, and Corneto, and the wild heights of Soracte, will probably ere long become as well known as the oft-visited Tivoli, Ostia, and Albano. It is intended to supplement these \"Walks in Rome\" by a similar volume of \"Excursions round Rome.\"     CHAPTER I.  DULL-USEFUL INFORMATION.        _Hotels._--For passing travellers or bachelors, the best are: Hotel      d'Angleterre, Bocca di Leone; Hotel de Rome, Corso. For families,      or for a long residence: Hotel des Iles Britanniques, Piazza del      Popolo; Hotel de Russie (close to the last), Via Babuino; Hotel de      Londres, and Hotel Europa, Piazza di Spagna; Hotel Costanzi, Via S.      Nicolo in Tolentino, in a high airy situation towards the      railway-station, and very comfortable and well managed, but further      from the sights of Rome. Less expensive, are: Hotel d'Allemagne,      Via Condotti; Hotel Vittoria, Via Due Macelli; Hotel d'Italie, Via      Quattro Fontane; Hotel della Pace, 8 Via Felice; Hotel Minerva,      Piazza della Minerva, very near the Pantheon. A large new hotel is      the \"Quirinale,\" in the Via Nazionale.       _Pensions_ are much wanted in Rome. The best are those of Miss      Smith and Madame Tellenbach, in the Piazza di Spagna; Pension Suez,      Via S. Nicolo in Tolentino; and the small Hotel du Sud, in the Capo      le Case.       _Apartments_ have lately greatly increased in price. An apartment      for a very small family in one of the best situations can seldom be      obtained for less than 300 to 500 francs a month. The English      almost all prefer to reside in the neighbourhood of the Piazza di      Spagna. The best situations are the sunny side of the Piazza      itself, the Trinità de' Monti, the Via Gregoriana, and Via Sistina.      Less good situations are, the Corso, Via Condotti, Via Due Macelli,      Via Frattina, Capo le Case, Via Felice, Via Quattro Fontane, Via      Babuino, and Via delle Croce,--in which last, however, are many      very good apartments. On the other side of the Corso suites of      rooms are much less expensive, but they are less convenient for      persons who make a short residence in Rome. In many of the palaces      are large apartments which are let by the year.       _Trattorie_ (Restaurants) send out dinners to families in      apartments in a tin box with a stove, for which the bearer calls      the next morning. A dinner for six francs ought to be amply      sufficient for three persons, and to leave enough for luncheon the      next day. _Restaurants_ where luncheons or dinners may be obtained      upon the spot, are those of Bedeau, Via della Croce, and Nazzari,      Piazza di Spagna. Those who wish for a real Roman dinner of      Porcupine, Hedgehog, and other such delicacies, find it at the      Falcone, where Ariosto used to lodge when in Rome.       _English Church._--Just outside the Porta del Popolo, on the left.      Services at 9 A.M., 11 A.M., and 3 P.M. on Sundays; daily service      twice on week-days.

The English mail leaves      daily at 8 P.M.       _Telegraph Office._--121 Piazza Monte-Citorio.

It is impossible for a traveller who spends only a week or ten days in Rome to see a tenth part of the sights which it contains. Perhaps the most important objects are:       _Churches._--S. Peter's, S. John Lateran, Sta. Maria Maggiore, S.      Lorenzo fuori Mura, S. Paoli fuori Mura, S. Agnese fuori Mura, Ara      Cœli, S. Clemente, S. Pietro in Montorio, S.

Stefano Rotondo, Sta. Maria sopra Minerva, Sta. Maria del Popolo.       _Palaces._--Vatican, Capitol, Borghese, Barberini (and, if      possible, Corsini, Colonna, Sciarra, Rospigliosi, and Spada).       _Villas._--Albani, Doria, Borghese, Wolkonski, and, though less      important, Ludovisi.       _Ruins._--Palace of the Cæsars, Temples in Forum, Coliseum, and, if      possible, the ruins in the Ghetto, and the Baths of Caracalla.  It is desirable for the traveller who is pressed for time to apply at once to his Banker for orders for any of the villas for which they are necessary. The following scheme will give a good general idea of Rome and its neighbourhood in a few days. The sights printed in italics can only be seen on the days to which they are ascribed:--       _Monday._--General view of Capitol, Gallery of Sculpture, Ara      Cœli, General view of Forum, Coliseum, St. John Lateran (with      cloisters), and drive out to the Via Latina and the aqueducts at      Tavolato.       _Tuesday._--Morning: St. Peter's and the Vatican Stanze. Afternoon:      _Villa Albani_, St. Agnese, and drive to the Ponte Nomentana.       _Wednesday._--Go to Tivoli (the Cascades, Cascatelle, and Villa      d'Este).       _Thursday._--Morning: _Palace of the Cæsars._ Afternoon: drive on      the Via Appia as far as Torre Mezzo Strada; in returning, see the      Baths of Caracalla.       _Friday._--Morning: Palazzo Borghese, Palazzo Spada, The Ghetto,      The Temple of Vesta, cross the Ponte Rotto to Sta. Cecilia; and end      in the afternoon at St. Pietro in Montorio and the _Villa Doria_      (or on Monday).       _Saturday._--Frascati and Albano. Drive to Frascati early, take      donkeys, by Rocca di Papa to Mte. Cavo; take luncheon at the      Temple, and return by Palazzuolo and the upper and lower Galleries      to Albano, whither the carriage should be sent on to await you at      the Hotel de Russie. Drive back to Rome in the evening.       _Sunday._--Morning: Sta. Maria del Popolo on way to English Church.      Afternoon: St. Peter's again; drive to Monte Mario (Villa Mellini),      or in the Villa Borghese, and end with the Pincio.       _2d Monday._--Morning: Sta. Prassede, Sta. Pudentiana, Sta. Maria      Maggiore. Afternoon: Sta. Sabina, Priorato Garden, English      Cemetery, S. Paolo, and the Tre Fontane.       _2d Tuesday._--Morning: Vatican Sculptures. Afternoon: S. Gregorio,      S. Stefano Rotondo, S. Clemente, S. Pietro in Vincoli, Sta. Maria      degli Angeli, S.

Afternoon: Forum in detail,      SS. Cosmo and Damian, and ascend the Coliseum.         *       *       *       *       *  The following list may be useful as a guide to some of the best subjects for artists who wish to draw at Rome, and have not much time to search for themselves:--  _Morning Light_:      Temple of Vesta with the fountain.     Arch of Constantine from the Coliseum (early).     Coliseum from behind Sta. Francesca Romana (early).     Temples in the Forum from the School of Xanthus.     View from the Garden of the Rupe Tarpeia.     In the Garden of S. Giovanni e Paolo.     In the Garden of S. Buonaventura.     In the Garden of the S. Bartolomeo in Isola.     In the Garden of S. Onofrio.     On the Tiber from Poussin's Walk.     From the door of the Villa Medici.     At S. Cosimato.     At the back entrance of Ara Cœli.     At the Portico of Octavia.     Looking to the Arch of Titus up the Via Sacra.     In the Cloister of the Lateran.     In the Cloister of the Certosa.     Near the Temple of Bacchus.     On the Via Appia, beyond Cecilia Metella.     Torre Mezza Strada on the Via Appia.     Torre Nomentana, looking to the mountains.     Ponte Nomentana, looking to the Mons Sacer.     Torre dei Schiavi, looking towards Tivoli.     Aqueducts at Tavolato.  _Evening Light_:      From St. John Lateran.     From the Ponte Rotto.     From the Terrace of the Villa Doria (St. Peter's).     Palace of the Cæsars--Roman side--looking to Sta. Balbina.     Palace of the Cæsars--French side--looking to the Coliseum.     Apse of S. Giovanni e Paolo.     Near the Navicella.     Garden of the Villa Mattei.     Garden of the Villa Wolkonski.     Garden of the Priorato.     Porta S. Lorenzo.     Torre dei Schiavi, looking towards Rome.     Via Latina, looking towards the Aqueducts.     Via Latina, looking towards Rome.  The months of November and December are the best for drawing. The colouring is then magnificent; it is enhanced by the tints of the decaying vegetation, and the shadows are strong and clear. January is generally cold for sitting out, and February wet; and before the end of March the vegetation is often so far advanced that the Alban Hills, which have retained glorious sapphire and amethyst tints all winter, change into commonplace green English downs; while the Campagna, from the crimson and gold of its dying thistles and fenochii, becomes a lovely green plain waving with flowers.  Foreigners are much too apt to follow the native custom of driving constantly in the Villa Borghese, the Villa Doria, and on the Pincio, and getting out to walk there during their drives. For those who do not care always to see the human world, a delightful variety of drives can be found; and it is a most agreeable plan for invalids, without carriages of their own, to take a \"course to the Parco di San Gregorio,\" or to the sunny avenues near the Lateran, and walk there instead of on the Pincio. A carriage for the return may almost always be found in the Forum or at the Lateran.     CHAPTER II.  THE CORSO AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD.       The Piazza del Popolo--Obelisk--Sta. Maria del Popolo--(The      Pincio--Villa Medici--Trinità de' Monti) (Via Babuino--Via      Margutta--Piazza di Spagna--Propaganda) (Via Ripetta--SS. Rocco e      Martino--S. Girolamo degli Schiavoni)--S. Giacomo degli      Incurabili--Via Vittoria--Mausoleum of Augustus--S. Carlo in      Corso--Via Condotti--Palazzo Borghese--Palazzo Ruspoli--S. Lorenzo      in Lucina--S. Sylvestro in Capite--S. Andrea delle Fratte--Palazzo      Chigi--Piazza Colonna--Palace and Obelisk of Monte-Citorio--Temple      of Neptune--Fountain of Trevi--Palazzo Poli--Palazzo Sciarra--The      Caravita--S. Ignazio--S. Marcello--Sta. Maria in Via Lata--Palazzo      Doria Pamfili--Palazzo Salviati--Palazzo Odescalchi--Palazzo      Colonna--Church of SS. Apostoli--Palazzo Savorelli--Palazzo      Buonaparte--Palazzo di Venezia--Palazzo Torlonia--Ripresa dei      Barberi--S. Marco--Church of Il Gesu--Palazzo Altieri.   The first object of every traveller will naturally be to reach the Capitol, and look down thence upon ancient Rome; but as he will go down to the Corso to do this, and must daily pass most of its surrounding buildings, we will first speak of those objects which will, ere long, become the most familiar.  A stranger's first lesson in Roman geography should be learnt standing in the _Piazza del Popolo_, whence three streets branch off--the Corso, in the centre, leading towards the Capitol, beyond which lies ancient Rome; the Babuino, on the left, leading to the Piazza di Spagna and the English quarter; the Ripetta, on the right, leading to the Castle of St. Angelo and St. Peter's. The scene is one well known from pictures and engravings. The space between the streets is occupied by twin churches, erected by Cardinal Gastaldi.       \"Les deux églises élevées au Place du Peuple par le Cardinal      Gastaldi à l'entrée du Corso, sont d'un effet médiocre. Comment un      cardinal n'a-t-il pas senti qu'il ne faut pas élever une église      pour _faire pendant_ à quelque chose? C'est ravaler la majesté      divine.\" _Stendhal_, i. 172.  It is in the church on the left that sermons are preached every winter on Sunday afternoons by some of the best Roman Catholic controversialists, just at the right moment for catching the Protestant congregations as they emerge from their chapels outside the Porta del Popolo.  These churches are believed to occupy the site of the magnificent tomb of Sylla, who died at Puteoli B.C. 82, but was honoured at Rome with a public funeral, at which the patrician ladies burnt masses of incense and perfumes on his funeral pyre.  The _Obelisk_ of the Piazza del Popolo was placed on this site by Sixtus V. in 1589, but was originally brought to Rome and erected in honour of Apollo by the Emperor Augustus.       \"Apollo was the patron of the spot which had given a name to the      great victory of Actium; Apollo himself, it was proclaimed, had      fought for Rome and for Octavius on that auspicious day; the same      Apollo, the Sun-god, had shuddered in his bright career at the      murder of the Dictator, and terrified the nations by the eclipse of      his divine countenance.\" ... Therefore, \"besides building a temple      to Apollo on the Palatine hill, the Emperor Augustus sought to      honour him by transplanting to the Circus Maximus, the sports of      which were under his special protection, an obelisk from      Heliopolis, in Egypt. This flame-shaped column was a symbol of the      sun, and originally bore a blazing orb upon its summit. It is      interesting to trace an intelligible motive for the first      introduction into Europe of these grotesque and unsightly monuments      of eastern superstition.\"--_Merivale, Hist. of the Romans._       \"This red granite obelisk, oldest of things, even in Rome, rises in      the centre of the piazza, with a four-fold fountain at its base.      All Roman works and ruins (whether of the empire, the far-off      republic, or the still more distant kings) assume a transient,      visionary, and impalpable character, when we think that this"]]]
