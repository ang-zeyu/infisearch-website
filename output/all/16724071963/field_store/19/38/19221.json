The species are numerous, and are found both in temperate and tropical seas; two or three inhabit our own coasts, but by far the greater number are found in the Asiatic Ocean. They are subject to variation in their colour; and this, joined with a general resemblance in form, has rendered the discrimination of the species very difficult. I have, however, remarked, that the various modifications of the umbilicus, and the termination of the pillar (which is indicated in many species by an elevated ridge or rib within the umbilicus) is a certain and constant indication, presenting the same peculiarity through all the individuals of a species, even in the young state. This termination of the pillar has been mistaken for the inner lip, which, on the contrary, is always above the umbilicus, which, if closed, is not closed by the lip, but by the thickened termination of the pillar or columella.  The two most striking varieties are here figured of this species, which is sufficiently described in the specific character. I believe it is found both in the Mediterranean and Red Seas.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 76  [Illustration]  MEROPS Savignii,  _Black-capped Bee-eater._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 8.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _M. viridis, subtus albescens, uropygio caudâque cæruleis; vertice,     strigâ oculari, fasciâque latâ collari nigris; mento, superciliisque     albis; rectricibus mediis elongatis._      Green; beneath whitish; rump and tail blue; crown of the head, eye     stripe, and broad band across the neck, black; chin and eye-brows     white; two middle tail feathers lengthened.         *       *       *       *       *  This Bird was pointed out to me by Professor Temminck as described by Le Vaillant in his work on this family, under the name here given; on this authority, therefore, I have been obliged to rest, for I have in vain turned over the catalogues of all the public libraries in the metropolis, in the hope of seeing the work, and ascertaining the fact. The book is modern, and, though expensive, one of standard excellence; but a princely fortune is necessary to purchase such a library as a student should have access to.  Total length eight inches and a half; size rather less than the common bee-eater; the crown in young birds is greenish, in some a dull brown, and in others deep black, margined in the front and sides of the head with a line of white; the ears black, uniting to a broad band across the neck of the same colour, which is margined on the lower part with beautiful sea blue; the nape of the neck, inner covers, and quill feathers, greenish fawn colour; the lesser quills tipt with black; the rump, tail, and outside of the quills next the body changeable greenish blue; the back and upper covers green beneath; the chin is white; the body tinged with greenish, and the under tail covers with blue: the tail three inches long, and in such specimens as have the two middle feathers lengthened, three and a half; bill and feet black.

The thorough investigation of these is a work of no ordinary labour; and, until this is done, it appears most advisable to let the generic distinction remain, as given by Latreille, though there can be no doubt that among them distinct groups will be detected.  Cramer's figure will not indicate even the genus, and Fabricius describes the body as white; the tip ferruginous; in this it is yellow, tipped with red.  Mr. Haworth obliged me with this insect, which Fabricius notes as African.         *       *       *       *       *  BOTIS bicolor,  _Black and White Gauze-wing._         *       *       *       *       *      _B. alis anticis fuscis, punctis duabus angulatis transversis albis;     posticis ad basin albis._      Anterior wings, brown, with two transverse angulated white spots;     posterior white at the base.         *       *       *       *       *  From the same collection as the preceding; the margin of the thorax and body are white.

Total length near seven inches; bill blackish horn colour, and one inch long from the gape; the feathers on the upper part of the head are short and pointed; the tips bright red; the base black; on the hind head they are longer, and change to a bright golden yellow, which spreads round the nape; the ear feathers and front of the head are greyish brown, striped down the middle with whitish, and in some there is an appearance of a whitish line over the eye, joining the nape. The upper parts of the body and wings are of a rich golden brown, with indistinct brighter spots; the lesser wing covers have a whitish spot at the top of each, forming two bands; quills on the inner shaft black, with white spots. Under plumage grey, tinged on the breast with rufous, and banded with brownish black; tail short, black, with interrupted transverse bands of obscure olive.  The female has the head blackish, the feathers tipt with dull white; the ears darker; the plumage above more olive, the spots brighter, and the bands on the body grey, paler, and more indistinct than in the male. The feet in both sexes are greenish, and the wings three inches and a half long.  It inhabits Brasil, but is not common; I found it both in the Province of Bahia, and that of Rio de Janeiro.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 79  [Illustration]  NATICA mustelina,  _Belted Natica_--_upper figures_.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 75.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _N. testâ subglobosâ, mustelinâ concolore, obsoletè rugatâ, fasciâ     levatâ basin cingente; spirâ depressâ, apice acuto; umbilico magno,     aperto; columellæ basi gracili, levatâ._      Shell sub-globose, uniform, fulvous-brown, obsoletely wrinkled, base     with an elevated belt; spire depressed, the tip acute; umbilicus large,     open; pillar termination slender, elevated, and central.         *       *       *       *       *  The elevated belt at the base affords an excellent distinction to this species.

They are found in both temperate and tropical seas; but the definitions hitherto given by conchologists are so imperfect, that they have left our knowledge of these shells nearly the same now, as in the time of Linnæus. Seventeen species only are enumerated in Mr. Dillwyn's work; although thirty-four have fallen within my own observation the last few months.  The difference between this and the common black Californian Ear, consists in its being a much deeper and smoother shell, always narrowest at the base, the outer lip not having (as in that) a prominent curve or gibbosity where it joins the spire; but principally in the perforations, which in this are always half as large, and doubly numerous; it is also generally a much smaller, and less common species: the spire is always deeply tinged with pink. The genus _Padollus_, of Montford, resting entirely in the unevenness of the outer lip, without any knowledge of the animal, appears to me an unnecessary distinction, for such is the character of all young shells, and also of mature ones, whose outer surface is rugged or uneven.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 81  [Illustration]  SPHINX Ello.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Antennæ prismaticæ, in utroque sexu ad medium leviter crassescentes,     externè breviter piloso baciliatæ, mucrone arcuato, producto, sensim     terminantes.

The two insects figured were received from Jamaica by my friend Dr. Leach, and there can be no doubt they are the sexes of one species. The upper is a male, and agrees with Drury's figure and description; the lower insect is a female, of which no representation has been published: as for Cramer's figure, if intended for the former, it is really so bad that it can hardly be quoted as an authority, and it appears to have misled Fabricius, in thinking that the female insect had a brown stripe on the anterior wings, whereas that character is more applicable to the male.  The insects I propose retaining under this genus are such as have the body lengthened, pointed, and not bearded at the tip; the antennæ but slightly thickened in the middle, and the terminating hook gradual, arched, and not very acute: these comprehend the first section of Latreille's genus, _Sphinx_, and are by him again divided into two groups, the one having the wings entire, the other angulated.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 82  [Illustration]  TROCHILUS niger,  _Black Humming Bird._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Rostrum elongatum, rectum vel arcuatum, flexile, gracillimum, ad basin     depressum, mandibulâ superiore inferiorem amplectente et tantùm non     obtegente.

To return, however, to that now before us, it should be observed, that it is the only species whose plumage does not in any way accord with that of the rest of its brethren. No author appears to have described it, although I met with it very frequently in Brazil: a specimen in the British Museum has the ears reddish brown, but this seldom occurs. The figure is of the size of life. All the species are natives of tropical America.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 83  [Illustration]  TROCHILUS falcatus,  _Sickle-winged Humming Bird._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 82.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _T. viridis, gulâ pectoreque nitidè cæruleis; corpore anoque     cæruleo-viridibus; rectricibus paribus, rufo-cinnamominis; remigibus     exterioribus falcatis, scapis dilatato compressis._      Green; throat and breast shining blue; body and vent blue green; tail     even, rufous cinnamon; exterior quills falcated, the shafts dilated and"]]]
