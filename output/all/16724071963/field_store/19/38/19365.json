She turns out well, however, and all her get-up is good--her habits come from a Melbourne tailor. I think I will get some clothes in Melbourne on my way back; they may not have newer ideas, but it may be useful for purposes of comparison with the Sydney cut. My riding clothes were evidently a source of much wonderment and admiration to the yokels. Unfortunately they have become badly stained with some confounded raspberry juice, and though I left them out for Mrs. Brown to clean, she has not done so yet.  \"Well, there is no news to be got in a place like this; we never go out, except on the run, and there seems absolutely no society. The local doctor came out yesterday, in a prehistoric motor, but I found him very uninteresting. Of course, one has no ideas in common with these Bush people. Where the 'Charm of the Bush' comes in is more than I can see--I much prefer Town on a Saturday morning to all Billabong and its bullocks. They wanted me to go out one night and--fancy!--help burn down dead trees; but, really, I jibbed on that. There is no billiard room. Uncle David intends building one when Jim comes home for good, but that certainly won't be in my time here. I fancy a very few weeks will see me back in town.  \"No bridge played here, of course! Have you had any luck that way?  \"Your affectionate son,  \"CECIL AUBREY LINTON.\"   Cecil blotted the final sheet of his letter home, and sat back with a sigh of satisfaction, as one who feels his duty nobly done. He stamped it, strolled across the hall to deposit it in the post box which stood on the great oak table, and then looked round for something to do.  It was afternoon, and all was very quiet. Mr. Linton had ridden off with a buyer to inspect cattle, Norah ruefully declining to accompany him.  \"I'm awfully sorry, Dad,\" she had said, \"But I'm too busy.\"  \"Busy, are you? What at?\"  \"Oh, cooking and things,\" Norah had answered. \"Brownie's not very well, and I said I'd help her--there's a lot to do just now, you know.\" She stood on tiptoe to kiss her father. \"Good-bye, Dad--don't be too long, will you? And take care of yourself!\"  Cecil also had declined to go out, giving \"letters to write\" as a reason. The truth was that several rides had told on the town youth, whose seat in the saddle was not easy enough to prevent his becoming stiff and sore. Bush people are used to this peculiarity in city visitors, and, while regarding the sufferers with sympathy, generally prescribe a \"hair of the dog that bit them\"--more riding--as the quickest cure; which Cecil would certainly have thought hard-hearted in the extreme. However, nothing would have induced him to say that he had felt the riding, since Cecil belonged to that class of boy that hates to admit inferiority to others. So he suffered in silence, creaked miserably at his uprising and down-sitting, and was happily unaware that everyone in Billabong knew perfectly well what was the matter with him.  Cecil and his mother were very good friends in the cool, polite way that was distinctive of them. They \"fitted\" together admirably, and as a general rule held the same views, the one on which they were most in accord being the belief in Cecil's own superior talents and characteristics. He wrote to her just as he would have talked, certain of her absolute agreement. When his letter was finished he felt much relieved at having, as Jim said, \"got it off his chest.\" Not that Cecil would ever have said anything so inelegant.  Sarah crossed the hall at the moment, carrying a tray of silver to be cleaned, and he called to her--  \"Where is Norah?\"  \"Miss Norah's in the kitchen,\" said the girl shortly. The Billabong maids were no less independent than modern maids generally are, but they had their views about the city gentleman's manner to the daughter of the house. \"On'y a bit of a kid himself,\" Mary had said to Sarah, indignantly, \"but any one'd think he owned the earth, an' Miss Norah was a bit of it.\" So they despised Cecil exceedingly, and refrained from shaking up his mattress when they made his bed.  \"Er--you may tell her I want to speak to her.\"  \"Can't, I'm afraid,\" Sarah said. \"Miss Norah's very busy, 'elpin' Mrs. Brown. She don't care to be disturbed.\"  \"Can't she spare me a moment?\"  \"Wouldn't ask her to.\" Sarah lifted her tray--and her nose--and marched out. Cecil looked black.  \"Gad! I wish the mater had to deal with those girls!\" he said viciously--Mrs. Geoffrey Linton was of the employers who \"change their maids\" with every new moon. \"She'd make them sit up, I'll wager. Abominable impertinence!\" He strolled to the door, and looked out across the garden discontentedly. \"What on earth is there for a man to do? Well, I'll hunt up the important cousin.\"  At the moment, Norah was quite of importance. Mrs. Brown had succumbed to a headache earlier in the day. Norah had found her, white-faced and miserable, bending over a preserving pan full of jam, waiting for the mystical moment when it should \"jell.\" Ordered to rest, poor Brownie had stoutly refused--was there not more baking to be done, impossible to put off, to say nothing of the jam? A brisk engagement had ensued, from which Norah had emerged victorious, the reins of government in her hands for the day. Brownie, still protesting, had been put on her bed with a handkerchief steeped in eau-de-Cologne on her throbbing forehead, and Norah had returned to the kitchen to varied occupations.  The jam had behaved beautifully; had \"jelled\" in the most satisfactory manner, just the right colour; now it stood in a neat array of jars on a side table, waiting to be sealed and labelled when cold. Then, after lunch, Norah had plunged into the mysteries of pastry, and was considerably relieved when her mince pies turned out very closely akin to those of Brownie, which were famous. Puddings for dinner had followed, and were now cooling in the dairy. Finally, the joint being in the oven, and vegetables prepared, the cook had compounded Jim's favourite cake, which was now baking; during which delicate operation, with a large dab of flour on her nose, the cook sat at the table, and wrote a letter.   \"DEAR OLD JIM,--This must be in pencil, 'cause I'm watching a cake that's in the oven, and I'm awfully scared of it burning, so I don't dare to go for the ink. Dad said I was to write and tell you we would meet you on Wednesday, unless we heard from you again. We are all awfully glad and excited about you coming. I'm sure Tait and Puck understand, 'cause I told them to-day, and they barked like anything. Your room is all right, and we've put in another cupboard. We're all so sorry about Wally not coming, but we hope he will come later on. Do make him.  \"Dad and I aren't talking about me going to school. It can't be helped, and it only makes you jolly blue to talk about it.  \"Cecil's come, and he's the queerest specimen of a boy I ever saw. He's awfully grown up, but he's small and terribly swagger. His riding clothes are gorgeous, and you mustn't laugh at them. Dad did, but it was into Bobs' mane. He came with us cutting-out, and Betty was too good for him, swinging round, so he came a lovely cropper into some wild raspberries. It was so funny no one could have helped laughing, and he wasn't really hurt, only prickled and very wild. I am afraid he isn't enjoying himself very much, but of course he will be all right when you come. It's jolly hard to entertain him, 'cause he isn't a bit keen about anything. He has a tremendous array of shaving tackle. And he has a hand glass. Do you think he will lend it to you to see your back hair?  \"Bobs is just lovelier than ever. I never knew him go so well as he is now, and he perfectly loves a jump. Dad has a new horse he calls Monarch, and he is a beauty, he is black with a star. OF COURSE, don't say anything about Cecil's spill to anybody, he could not help it. And he had a much bigger laugh at me, 'cause I fell into the lagoon the day he came. I will tell you all about it when you come.  \"The place is looking lovely, and hasn't dried up a bit--\"   An unfamiliar step came along the passage, and Norah sat up abruptly from the labours of composition, and then with promptness concealed her letter under a cookery book.  \"Why Cecil! How did you find your way here?\"  \"Oh--looked about me. I had finished my writing, and there was nothing to do.\"  \"I'm so sorry,\" Norah said contritely. \"You see, Brownie's sick, and I'm on duty here.\"  \"You!\" said Cecil, with a laugh. \"And what can YOU do in a kitchen?\"  Norah blushed at the laugh more than at the words.  \"Oh, you'll get some sort of a dinner,\" she said. \"Don't be too critical, that's all.\"  \"What, you really can cook? Or do you play at it?\"  \"Well, there are mighty few girls in the Bush who can't cook a bit,\" Norah said. \"Of course we're lucky, having Brownie--but you really never can tell as a rule when you may have to turn to in the kitchen. Dad says it's one of the beauties of Australia!\"  \"Can't say I like the idea of a lady in the kitchen,\" quoth Cecil loftily.  \"Can't say I'd like to be one who was scared of it,\" Norah said. \"And I guess you'd get very bored if you had to go without your dinner!\" She seized a cloth and opened the oven door gingerly, and made highly technical experiments with her cake, rising presently, somewhat flushed. \"Ten minutes more,\" she said, with an air of satisfaction. \"And, as Brownie would say, 'he's rose lovely.' Have some tea, Cecil?\"  Cecil assented, and watched the small figure in the voluminous white apron as she flitted about the kitchen.  \"I like having tea here,\" Norah confided to him. \"Then I use Brownie's teapot, and don't you always think tea tastes miles better out of a brown pot? You won't get the proper afternoon cups either--I hope you don't mind?\" She stopped short, with a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4050"],["title","Mates at Billabong (#8)"],["body","sense of talking a language altogether foreign to this bored young man in correct attire; and a rush of something like irritation to think how different Jim or Wally would have been--she could almost see Wally sitting on the edge of the table, with a huge cup of tea in one hand, a scone in the other, and his thin, eager face alight with cheerfulness. Cecil was certainly heavy in the hand. She sighed, but bent manfully to her task again.  \"You take sugar, don't you? And cream? Yes, you ought to have cream, 'cause you've been ill.\" She dashed into the pantry, returning with a small jug. \"The cake's not mine, so I can recommend it; but if you're not frightened you can have one of my mince pies.\"  \"Thanks, I'd rather have cake,\" said Cecil., and again Norah flushed at his tone, but she laughed.  \"It's certainly safer,\" she agreed, \"I'm sure Brownie thought it was a hideous risk to leave the pies to me.\" She supplied her cousin with cake, and retreated to the oven.  \"Why don't you let one of the girls do this?\" he asked.  \"Sarah or Mary? Oh, they're as busy as ever they can be,\" explained Norah. \"We always do a lot of extra cleaning and rubbing up before Christmas, and they haven't a moment. Of course they'd do it in a minute, if I asked them, but I wouldn't--as it is, Sarah's going to dish up for me. They're the nicest girls; I'm going to take them tea as soon as I get my cake out!\"  \"You!\" said Cecil. \"You don't mean to say you're going to cart tea to the servants?\"  \"I'd be a perfect pig if I didn't,\" Norah said, shortly. \"I'm afraid you don't understand the bush a bit, Cecil.\"  \"Thank goodness I don't then,\" said Cecil, stiffly. \"Who's that tray for?\"  \"Brownie, of course.\" Norah was getting a little ruffled--criticism like this had not come to her.  \"Well, I think it's extraordinary--and so would my mother,\" Cecil said, with an air of finality.  \"I suppose a town is different,\" said Norah, striving after patience. \"We like to look after everyone here--and I think it's grand when everyone's nice to everyone!\" She paused; it was hard to be patient and grammatical, too.  \"School will teach you a number of things,\" said her cousin loftily. He rose and put down his cup. \"A lady shouldn't lower herself.\"  \"Dad says a lady can't lower herself by work,\" retorted Norah. \"Anyhow, if taking tea to dear old Brownie's going to lower me, it'll have to, that's all!\"  \"You don't understand,\" said Cecil. \"A lady has her own place, and to get on terms of familiarity with the lower classes is bad for both her and them.\" He looked and felt instructive. \"It isn't exactly the action that counts--it's the spirit it fosters--er--the feeling--that is, the--er, in short, it's a mistake to--\"  \"Oh, please be careful, Cecil, you're sitting in some dough!\"  Norah sprang forward anxiously, and instructiveness fell from Cecil as one sheds a garment. He had sat down on the edge of the table in the flow of his eloquence; now he jumped up angrily, and, muttering unpleasant things, endeavored to remove dough from his person. Norah hovered round, deeply concerned. Pastry dough, however, is a clinging and a greasy product, and finally the wrathful lecturer beat a retreat towards the sanctuary of his own room, and the cook sat down and shook with laughter.  \"My cake!\" she gasped, in the midst of her mirth. She flew to the oven and rescued Jim's delicacy.  \"Thank goodness, it's all right!\" said she. Her mirth broke out afresh.  A shadow darkened the doorway.  \"What--cooking and in hysterics?\" said Mr. Linton. \"May I have some tea? And what's the matter?\"  \"Cecil's begun the reforming process,\" said his daughter, becoming solemn with difficulty. \"You've no idea how improved I am, Daddy! He seems to be certain that I'm not a lady, and he's very doubtful if I'm a cook, so could you tell me what I'm likely to be?\"  \"A better all-round man than Cecil, I should hope,\" said David Linton, with a sound like a snort of wrath. \"Give me some tea, mate, and don't bother your head about the future. Your old Dad's not scared!\"     CHAPTER VI  COMING HOME      The top of my desire     Is just to meet a mate o' mine.     HENRY LAWSON.   It had suddenly become hot--\"truly Christmas\" weather, Norah called it, as she stood waiting on the Cunjee platform for a train which, in accordance with all railway traditions at Christmas, was already over an hour late. Norah felt it hard that to-day, of all days in the year, it should be so--when Jim was actually coming home for good! At the thought of Jim's arrival she hopped cheerfully on one leg, completely oblivious of onlookers, and looked up the shining line of rails for the thousand-and-first time. Would the old train never come?  \"Aren't you contriving to keep warm, with the mercury trying to break the thermometer? Or do you dance merely because you feel like it?\" asked a friendly voice; and Norah turned with a little flush of pleasure to greet the Cunjee doctor. She and Dr. Anderson respected each other very highly.  \"Because I feel like it, I expect,\" she said, laughing and shaking hands.  \"Which my wide professional experience leads me to diagnose as the fact that you're probably waiting for Jim!\" said the doctor, gravely. \"There's a certain hectic flush, an intermittent pulse, which convinces me of your painful state, when coupled with the restlessness of the eye.\"  \"Which eye?\" asked Norah anxiously.  \"Both,\" said the doctor. \"Don't be flippant with your medical man. So he's really coming, Norah?\"  \"Yes,\" said Norah, \"and I don't care if I am excited--so'd you be, doctor. Billy's outside with the horses, and he's just as excited as I am.\"  \"Billy!\" said the doctor. \"But he'd never say more than 'Plenty!' no matter how excited he was.\"  \"No, of course not, but then he finds it such a useful word,\" Norah said a little vaguely. She was peering up the rails. Suddenly she spun round, her face glowing. \"There's the smoke--she's coming!\"  Whatever additional remarks Dr. Anderson may have made fell on deaf ears, for Norah had no further ideas from that moment. The train came into view over the brow of the hill, and slid down the long slope into the station, pulling up with a mighty grinding of brakes. Almost as it stopped a door was flung open violently, and a very tall boy with the Grammar School colours on his hat jumped out, cast a hurried glance around, and then seized the small person in blue linen in an unashamed bear's hug.  \"Oh, Jim!\" said Norah. \"Oh, Jimmy--boy!\"  \"Well, old kiddie,\" said Jim. \"You all right? My word, I am glad to see you!\"  \"Me, too,\" said Norah. \"It's been just ages, Jim.\"  \"Hasn't it?\" Jim said. He started. \"Oh, by Jove! There's someone else here!\"  Norah wheeled round, and uttered a little cry of joy. Another boy with the dark-blue hat band was grinning at her in most friendly fashion--a thin, brown-faced boy, with especially merry dark eyes. Norah's hands went out.  \"Wally! But, how lovely! I thought you couldn't come.\"  \"So did I,\" said Wally Meadows, pumping her hands vigorously. \"I was going home, but my aunt obligingly got measles. I'm awfully sorry for Aunt. But it's an ill-wind that blows nowhere--old Jim took pity on me, and here I am!\"  \"I should think so,\" Norah said. \"We haven't felt a bit complete without you. Dad was saying only this morning how sorry he was you couldn't come. He'll get such a shock! Oh, it's so lovely to have you two--and isn't it getting like Christmas! I'm so happy!\" She jigged on one foot, regardless of interested faces watching her from the train.  \"You've grown about a foot,\" said Jim, patting her on the shoulder. \"Pretty thin, too--sure you're all right?\"  Norah reassured him, laughing.  \"Well, you look awfully fit, if you are thin,\" was Jim's comment. \"Doesn't she, Wally?\"  \"Never saw her look fitter,\" said Wally. \"I'm glad as five bob Aunt got the measles! Oh, what a beast I am--but, you know what I mean! Jim, this train'll go on, and we've fifty million things in the carriage!\"  \"So we have!\" Jim said, hurriedly, taking his hand from Norah's shoulder and diving after his chum into the compartment they had quitted. They emerged laden with suitcases, parcels, rackets, fishing rods, golf sticks and other miscellaneous impedimenta.  \"Catch!\" Jim said, tossing a big box into Norah's hands.  \"Chocolates!\" said Norah blissfully. \"Jim, you're an angel!\"  \"Always knew that,\" her brother replied, dropping his load on the platform with a cheerful disregard of what might break. \"Come on, Wally, we'll get the heavy things out of the van. You watch those, Nor. Who's in, by the way? And where's Dad?\"  \"Dad's in Cunjee; but he had business, and he couldn't wait at the station, the train was so late. Cecil's with him--they're both riding. I've got the light buggy with the ponies for you, and Billy's driving the express for your luggage and heaps of things that Brownie wants for the house.\" Norah spoke in one breath and finished with a gasp.  \"Guess people must have thought you were a circus procession!\" was Jim's comment. \"All right, we'll cart the things out to Billy.\"  Out at the big express-wagon drawn by a pair of greys, Billy stood, welcoming them with a smile on his dusky countenance that Wally likened to a slit in a coconut. The luggage was piled in with special injunctions to the black boy not to put the bags of flour on anything that looked delicate--whereat Billy's smile widened to a grin, and he murmured \"Plenty!\" delightedly.  \"That's the lot,\" Jim said. \"The buggy's at the hotel, I suppose, Norah?\"  \"Yes--and we're to have lunch there with Dad. And you've got to be awfully polite to Cecil!\"  \"Cecil!\" said Jim, lifting his nose. \"If Cecil's anything like what he used to be--\" He did not finish the sentence.  \"Do we play with Cecil?\" Wally asked, grinning.  \"The question is, if Cecil will condescend to play with you,\" Norah said. \"He thinks ME too much of a kid to look at--\"  \"Oh, does he?\" asked Jim resentfully.  \"But you're both ever so much bigger than he "]]]
