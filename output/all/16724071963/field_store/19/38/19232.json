Above all, it was war-time, and individuals do not count when greater issues are at stake.  Presently the sub descried the head and shoulders of the missing man as he rose on the crest of the broken waves.  He, too, had succeeded in reaching a lifebuoy thrown by the nearmost destroyer.  Short as had been the time between the man’s tumble overboard and Sefton’s deliberate leap, owing to the speed of the flotilla nearly a quarter of a mile separated the would-be rescuer from the object of his gallant attempt.  \"No use hanging on here,\" thought Sefton, as he clung to the buoy. \"Must get to the man somehow.\"  Then it was that he realized that he had gone overboard in a thick pilot coat and india-rubber sea-boots.  These he sacrificed regretfully, since there was no chance of replenishing his kit until the _Calder_ returned to port--that is, if he had the good fortune to survive his adventure \"in the ditch\".  The operation of discarding the boots gave him a tussle, during which he swallowed more salt water than desirable; then, relaxing his grip on the lifebuoy, Sefton struck out towards the man.  The sub was a good swimmer.  At Dartmouth he had been \"runner-up\" for the 440 yards championship, but now he realized the vast difference between swimming that length in regulation costume and an equal distance almost fully clothed in the choppy North Sea.  By the time the sub came within hailing distance of the seaman his limbs felt as heavy as lead, while, do what he would, he was unable to raise his voice above a whisper, much less \"assure the drowning man in a loud, firm voice that he is safe\", according to the official regulations. Sefton was by no means certain that he himself was in anything but a most precarious position.  Sefton found that the man he had risked his life to save was not half so exhausted as he was.  The seaman had come off lightly in his fall, and he had had no occasion to tire himself with a long swim to the lifebuoy, since the crew of the passing destroyer had all but brained him with the cork \"Kisbie\".  The A.B. regarded his rescuer with a look that betokened pained disapproval.  He was one of those men who are ever \"up against discipline\". To him the gold band and curl on a uniform meant something more than authority: it roused a spirit of sullen aggression.  And yet Thomas Brown had joined the Royal Navy with the best intentions. Fate, in the shape of a short-tempered recruiting-officer, had marred his career from the very start; for, on joining the training-school at Shotley, one of the questions asked of him was the name of his birthplace.  \"Ashby-de-la-Zouch, sir,\" replied young Brown, giving the name with the accepted Leicestershire accent.  \"Where did you say?\" enquired the lieutenant.  The recruit repeated the words.  \"Zoo, did you say?\" snapped the officer.  \"Yes, sir,\" rejoined Thomas Brown without a moment’s hesitation.  \"The next cage to yours.\"  The repartee came absolutely on the spur of the moment.  A second’s reflection might have made all the difference.  It was a bad start, and the newly-entered boy suffered for it.  That was some years ago, but in the Royal Navy the old adage of giving a dog a bad name holds good longer than anywhere else.  Sefton recognized the man as one who figured frequently in the \"Captain’s Report\".  Young as he was, the sub had a keen insight into human nature, and although he knew nothing of the first slip that had marred the A.B.’s career he was certain that there were good points in the man, and that underneath his rugged, surly exterior there was something of true worth.  \"No need for you to tumble into the ditch after me, sir,\" said the man. \"I can shift for myself.\"  He spoke gruffly, but underlying the remonstrance was an unmistakable tone of gratitude.  In the circumstances he was glad of company.  He would have welcomed his \"raggie\", or chum, in preference to an officer, but at such times the difference of rank gives place to the equality of human peril.  \"They’ll pick us both up,\" declared Sefton, although in his mind he had grave doubts as to the matter.  \"Not they,\" rejoined A.B. Brown, indicating the direction of the now invisible flotilla with a jerk of his closely-cropped head.  \"The cruisers might. But take hold of this, sir,\" he added, pushing the buoy to within reach of the sub.  \"You looks as if you want it a long sight more’n me.\"  Both men relapsed into silence.  Further conversation meant a waste of precious breath.  At intervals, as the buoy rose on the billows, Sefton \"hiked\" his head and shoulders well clear of the water in the hope of sighting the armoured-cruiser squadron.  \"They’re a precious long time in coming up,\" he soliloquized.  \"Seven minutes ought to have done the trick.\"  As a matter of fact, the First Cruiser Squadron had received a wireless message from the _Calder_ within ninety seconds of Sefton’s leap overboard, requesting the vessels to keep a sharp look-out for the two men.  On receipt of the intelligence the armoured cruisers’ speed was reduced to 10 knots, and this accounted for the seemingly endless time that elapsed before the vessels came within sight of the two well-nigh exhausted men as they clung to the lifebuoy.  At length, through the light haze that prevailed throughout the morning, could be discerned the grey outlines of the First Cruiser Squadron.  The ships were steaming in double column, line ahead, the _Defence_, flying the Rear-Admiral’s flag, leading the starboard and the _Warrior_ the port line. With faultless precision they came on, three cables’ distance separating the units of each division, and twice that interval betwixt the columns.  \"They’ve spotted us, sir,\" exclaimed Able Seaman Brown, as the alteration of position of the red flag and green cone displayed from the cruiser’s mainmast yard-arm told the two men that the _Warrior’s_ helm was being ported.  Simultaneously the \"steaming cones\" were reversed, showing that the ship’s engines were going astern--a manoeuvre followed by the rest of the squadron.  Almost before way was taken off the ship the _Warrior’s_ sea-boat was rapidly lowered from the davits.  Sefton could hear the dull thud of the lower blocks as the releasing-gear came into action and the falls surged against the ship’s side, and the treble-voiced midshipman urging his boat’s crew to \"give way there, my lads, for all you’re worth.\"  Although only a minute and a half elapsed between the time the sea-boat got away from the ship and her arrival at the scene of the rescue, the interval seemed interminable to Sub-lieutenant Sefton.  With feelings of indescribable relief he realized that he was being gripped by two pairs of horny powerful hands and lifted over the dipping gunwale into the stern-sheets, while others performed a like office for the saturated A.B.  Smartly the sea-boat was brought alongside the cruiser.  Deftly the hoisting-gear was engaged, and with a hundred-and-twenty men tailing on the falls the boat and her occupants were whisked up to a level with the vessel’s quarter-deck.  And thus Acting Sub-lieutenant John Sefton found himself on board H.M.S. _Warrior_, in blissful ignorance of the gallant part the armoured cruiser was about to bear in the glorious battle off the Jutland Bank.     CHAPTER VI--Action at the Double   The ship upon which Sefton found himself as an unauthorized supernumerary was an armoured cruiser of 13,550 tons, built and completed at Pembroke nine years previously.  She was one of a class of four that marked a new departure in naval architecture--each of her guns being mounted singly and in a separate turret.  At the time when she was laid down she was considered one of the heaviest armed cruisers of her day, mounting six 9.2-inch and four 7.5-inch guns.  Of these, three 9.2’s could be made to fire ahead, and a similar number astern, while on either broadside she could deliver a formidable salvo from four of the guns of heavier calibre and two of the 7.5’s.  With the exception of the following year’s programme of the _Minotaur_ class, the _Warrior_ and her sister ships were the last armoured cruisers laid down by the British Admiralty, the all-big-gun battle-cruisers simply outclassing at one swoop the armoured cruisers of the world’s navies.  Nevertheless the _Warrior_ was still a powerful unit, and calculated to be more than a match for any German vessel of her size.  Her designed speed of a fraction over 22 knots--a rate that when necessity arose could be exceeded--enabled her with the rest of her class to form a valuable, hard-hitting auxiliary to the vessels of the battle-cruiser squadrons.  While Sefton was being kitted out by an obliging brother sub-lieutenant, a wireless message had been sent to the _Calder_ announcing the safety of her sub-lieutenant and A.B. Brown.  Crosthwaite received the gratifying intelligence with undisguised delight.  His feelings were shared by the whole of the ship’s company, for, almost without exception, the destroyer’s officers were voted a \"sound lot\", and the possibility of Sefton’s death in a gallant attempt at the rescue of a lower-deck man had thrown a gloom over the ship.  As for the lieutenant-commander, his relief and gratitude to Providence knew no bounds.  Between Sefton’s leap overboard and the receipt of the _Warrior’s_ message he had passed through a distressing time.  Apart from his personal regard for the sub, with whom he had shared adventures and perils in the Near East, the fact that he had been compelled to abandon Sefton to the vagaries of fate hit him hard.  He was even doubtful whether, with the possibilities of hostile submarines cruising around, the armoured cruisers would risk slowing down to rescue two men and at the same time present a splendid"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39489"],["title","With Beatty off Jutland: A Romance of the Great Sea Fight (#7)"],["body","for German torpedoes. However, the deed of rescue was accomplished, and the next step to consider was how to get Sefton and the A.B. back on the destroyer.  The former’s presence was desirable, in fact essential.  In answer to the _Calder’s_ lieutenant-commander’s request, whether it would be possible for Sefton to be sent back to the destroyer, the rescuing ship replied that, should opportunity occur, the _Calder_ could close, but that, in view of present conditions, such a step was most unlikely.  \"So you’ll jolly well have to make yourself at home here, old bird,\" remarked one of the _Warrior’s_ sub-lieutenants, who as a youngster had passed out of Dartmouth at the same time as Sefton. \"Suppose the trip will do you good.  Sort of marine excursion out and home, don’t you know. Nothin’ doin’, and never a sign of a Hun, unless it be a ’tin-fish’ or two.\"  The _Warrior’s_ sub voiced the opinion of the rest of the gun-room.  He was president of the mess and a mild autocrat over the \"small fry\", and generally voted a rattling good sort by the handful of midshipmen, many of whom, alas! were to yield up their lives in undying fame before many hours were past.  Yet, although the whole of the personnel of the Grand Fleet were as keen as mustard to meet the Huns, frequent and almost unvarying disappointment had been their lot.  Over and over again Beatty’s squadron had swept the North Sea without coming in contact with the enemy, until it was the general conclusion that, until the High Seas Fleet was actually sighted, it was of no use speculating upon the chances of the \"big scrap\".  And now, on the memorable morning of Wednesday, the 31st May, the First and Second Battle-cruiser Squadron, three light-cruiser squadrons, with attendant destroyers, were ploughing eastward across the North Sea, with the knowledge that the hard-hitting Battle Fleet, together with a formidable array of cruisers and destroyers, was some distance to the nor’ard, ready, at the first wireless call, to complete the toils thrown around the German fleet should the latter, lured into a sense of false security, dare to leave the mine-fields of Heligoland.  Shortly after noon the wind dropped and the water became almost calm, save for the undulations caused by the swiftly-moving squadron. Overhead the sun shone faintly through a thick haze, which for hours hung about with irritating persistence.  Sefton had just commenced a game of draughts with some of the officers who were off duty, when a messenger entered the gun-room and handed a \"chit\" to the senior sub.  Not until the man had gone did the young officer break the momentous news to the others, apologizing as if the information might unduly raise their hopes.  \"I don’t want to be too cock-sure, you fellows,\" he announced.  \"Looks as if they’re out this time, but----\"  \"I vote we go on deck,\" suggested a midshipman.  \"And see the whole of the German fleet,\" added a junior watchkeeper facetiously.  \"Anyhow, there’s ’General Quarters’,\" retorted the middy daringly as a bugle rang out, the call being quickly repeated in various parts of the ship, \"Look alive, you fellows.\"  \"Stick to me, Sefton,\" said the senior sub, snatching his telescope from a rack and making a bolt for the door.  \"If there’s anything to be seen of the scrap you’ll have a good chance with me.  I’m fire-control, don’t you know.\"  Jack Sefton nodded his head in acquiescence. He was sorry that he was not on board the _Calder_, since there was a greater possibility of the destroyer flotillas dashing in to complete the work of the battle-cruisers than of the armoured cruisers getting within range.  Gaining the quarter-deck, the _Calder’s_ sub heard the unmistakable baritone hum of an aerial propeller.  Overhead, at a low altitude of less than a thousand feet, a sea-plane was flying in a northeasterly direction.  By the markings on her planes and fuselage--concentric red, white, and blue circles--Sefton recognized her as a British one. It afterwards transpired that Sir David Beatty had ordered the _Engadine_ to send up a sea-plane for reconnaissance work, and that wireless reports were received from the daring airmen that they had sighted four hostile light cruisers.  The latter opened a hot fire with every quick-firer they could get to bear upon the indomitable sea-plane, the range being less than 3000 yards, but in spite of the hail of shrapnel the airmen gained their desired information and returned to their parent ship.  On board the _Warrior_, as was the case with the rest of her consorts, hands were hard at work clearing ship for action.  Already the masts and shrouds had been \"frapped\", or protected, by means of wire cables wrapped round the spars and interlaced between the standing-rigging. \"A\" and \"B\" water-tight doors were closed, armoured hatchways battened down, and hoses led along the decks in order to quell the fire that would inevitably break out should a hostile shell burst inside the armoured belt.  Stanchions, cowls, and all gear likely to interfere with the training of the guns were unshipped and stowed, tons of His Majesty’s property were jettisoned, the danger of their remaining on board being more than sufficient reason for their sacrifice.  Inside the turrets, tubs of water were provided to slake the burning thirst of the guns’ crews, for experience had proved that the acute mental and physical strain, coupled with the acrid fumes that drift into the confined steel spaces, produces an intense dryness of the mouth and throat.  Behind the armoured protection, stretcher-bearers and fire-parties were preparing for their stern work.  Down below, far beneath the water-line, the fleet surgeon and his staff were getting ready for their grim yet humane tasks.  Operations have to be performed under great disadvantages, the complexity of wounds caused by modern shells adding to the difficulties under which the medical staff labours. Contrast an operation in a well-ordered hospital on shore--where perfect quietude reigns and everything is conducive to success--with the conditions on board a war-ship in action.  The indifferent light, for the electric lamps are quivering under the vibration of the guns; the deafening concussion overhead as the ship gives and receives punishment; the jerky motion of the vessel as she twists and turns to the rapid movements of the helm and quivers under the titanic blows of hostile shells; and the probability of the ship’s bottom being shattered like an egg-shell by a powerful torpedo--all these form but a part of the disadvantages under which the naval medical staff labour during the progress of an action.  Literally imprisoned below the armoured deck, the grimy stokers were preparing for the coming ordeal.  Hidden from the rest of the ship’s company, they toiled like Trojans in order to raise such a terrific head of steam as would make the cruiser \"foot it\" at a speed far in excess of her nominal 22.33 knots.  In action the lot of the \"black squad\" is perhaps the worst on board.  Knowing nothing of what is going on, they have to work in a confined, heated steel box, shovelling coals with a dexterity that is the outcome of months of strenuous training.  Besides the risk of torpedoes and shells there is ever the danger of the boilers giving way under the pressure of steam, with the inevitable result--a horrible death in a pitch-black stokehold filled with scalding steam. And yet, for easygoing joviality and good comradeship the naval stoker is hard to beat.  He will face discomforts with a smiling face and a cheerful heart. He will be ready to risk his life for his chum--or on the altar of duty.  These thoughts flashed through Sefton’s mind as he watched the rapid and methodical preparation of clearing ship for action.  For once the sub realized that he was a mere spectator--a sort of pariah, dumped from a comparatively insignificant destroyer upon a cruiser mustering a complement of over 700 officers and men.  He was aware of the fact that he was a \"deadhead\"--an individual having no right to take part in the forthcoming contest.  The inaction seemed the worst part of the business as far as he was concerned.  Presently Sefton’s thoughts were interrupted by the shrill, long-drawn-out trills of the bos’n’s mates’ pipes summoning the ship’s company to muster on the quarter-deck.  At the double the men romped aft--every seaman, marine, stoker, and \"idler\" not actually prevented by pressure of duty elsewhere.  Since the captain could not quit the fore-bridge the assembled ship’s company was addressed by the commander.  In crisp sentences of simple brevity he explained to the men the position of affairs.  At length a big action was in progress, he announced, for a wireless message had just come in to the effect that the battle-cruisers were already engaging the enemy at 18,000 yards--a distance of nearly 11 land miles. More than that, the German Battle Squadron was coming from the nor’ard, and there was a grave possibility of the British battle-cruisers being engaged between the enemy battleships and their battle-cruisers.  In which case, the commander hastened to explain, losses would doubtless be severe; but it was part of the Commander-in-Chief’s plan to risk certain of his battle-cruisers in order to cut off and detain the German fleet until the British Main Battle Squadrons got between the enemy and their bases.  \"I do not expect that we shall go into action just at present,\" concluded the commander, \"but should events shape themselves all right we’ll be in the thick of it before long.  And I have not the faintest hesitation in expressing my firm belief that every man jack of us will do his duty to King and country, and uphold the traditions of H.M.S. _Warrior_.\"  With that the men were dismissed, and, all preparations having been made, they were at liberty until the \"Action Stations\" sounded.  That interval was perhaps the most trying of all.  Many of the ship’s company were going into"]]]
