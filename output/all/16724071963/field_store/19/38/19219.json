Our knowledge of these singular birds has been much increased by the writings of Professor Temminck, who has described twelve species. The present bird is nearly the smallest of its family: I found it only once in the interior of Bahia in Brazil, where it must be very rare, or frequent to particular districts only. Though differing in some respects from the description of Temminck, I am inclined to consider it merely as a variety.  Total length (excepting the legs) eight inches and a quarter. The bill is one inch one line long from the gape, and, with the irides, is red. The head and neck above blackish cinereous; the crown much darker and tinged with brown, the rest of the upper plumage uniform reddish-brown; the edges of the wing-covers tinged with pale cinereous; the spurious wings and quills greyish-brown; the chin is white, changing on the throat, neck, breast and their sides to a pale lead-colour, which, on the body, again becomes white; the feathers on the flanks are blackish or rufous, beautifully margined all round by white, with another internal mark of the same kind; those on the vent are similarly marked, but on a pale rufous ground; the thighs are rufous-white; the under tail-covers rufous, marked by narrow undulated concentric lines of black, the ends whitish. The length of the legs (from the knee to the base of the middle toe) one inch two lines, and from that to the tip of the claw one inch. Legs blueish-purple. Hind toe very short, and elevated above the ground.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 20  [Illustration]  PICUS Braziliensis.  _Brazilian Woodpecker._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 14.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P. olivaceus, subtùs fulvus, nigrescente-fasciatus; capite     subcristato, suprà rubro, utrinque lineis olivaceis, fulvis, et     rubris._      Olive Woodpecker: beneath fulvous, with transverse blackish bands.

It was, I believe, first described in a paper I sent to the Wernerian Society some time ago: the figure is less than the natural size.  Total length nine inches. Bill not quite an inch, and blackish. Irides yellow. Head slightly crested; the whole upper part crimson. Orbits and cheeks olive-brown; beneath this a narrow line of tawny-yellow begins at the nostrils and passes down the sides of the neck; next this is a similar stripe crimson on the jaws and olive beyond, leaving the chin and throat in front yellowish; the plumage above is tawny-olive. Quills black, within edged with rufous: all the under parts tawny-yellow, transversely banded with blackish lines; inner wing-covers yellowish. Tail three inches and a half long, the feathers black, unspotted, and tinged at their base with olive. Feet and claws lead-colour. The neck is very slender. The only one I have yet seen was a male.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 21  [Illustration]  PROCNIAS hirundacea.  _Swallow Fruit-eater._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Rostrum breve, trigonum, basi latissimum, dilatatum, versus apicem     contractum: mandibulis emarginatis; marginibus intraflexis; mandibulâ     superiore, tomiis curvatis, carinatis; inferiore rectâ, breviore.

Temminck and Lagier had just before us, and without our     knowledge, published this bird under the name of Procnias Ventralis,     (Pl. 5.) by which name in right of priority it should stand in the     system.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _P.

(Female) green; chin and temples grey; body beneath yellowish,     transversely striated with dusky-green.         *       *       *       *       *  The birds of this genus are remarkable for the enormous width of their mouths, which in some species exceeds that of the Swallow family, thus enabling them with ease to swallow the large berries of the _Melastomæ_ and other tropical shrubs, on which they alone subsist; not on insects, as Cuvier asserts. Although in the construction of their bills they perfectly resemble the Swallows, their wings are not formed for long or rapid flight; and their feet are much stronger, and calculated for searching among branches for their food, in which situations I have frequently seen them. The term \"_pedes ambulatorii_,\" or walking-feet, is applied too generally, and should be confined to the gallinaceous and Pigeon tribes.  This genus was formed by Count Hoffmansegg, and the present is the smallest species known: our figure is of the male bird. Total length about five inches and a half. The bill from the angle to the tip measures seven lines; but from the nostrils only three lines and a half. The middle of the body, vent, and under tail-covers in the male are pure white; in the female yellowish, with a line of olive-green down the middle of each shaft; the quills, wing-covers, and tail-feathers are black, margined in the male with blue, and in the female with green: the tail is slightly forked. The nostrils round and bare; the base of the bill has a few weak setaceous hairs. The legs resemble the true Chatterers, having the outer toe rather longer than the inner, and attached to the base of the middle.  This is a scarce bird, apparently not hitherto described; I met with it only three times in Bahia; but it appears more frequent in the southern provinces of Brazil, specimens having been sent me from Minas Geralis and Rio de Janeiro.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 22  [Illustration]  TERIAS Elvina.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Antennæ breves, clavâ subtruncatâ, compressâ.

Method, p._ 158. _no._ 67.         *       *       *       *       *  This is one of the smallest of Butterflies, and from the extreme delicacy of its form seems to sanction with truth the poetic idea of living \"but for a day.\" It is found in Brazil, inhabiting only the deepest forests, as if fearful its little life would be endangered by the scorching rays of a tropical sun: in these sombre shades it is seen to fly slowly and feebly near those spots where a ray of the sun has partially entered the thick canopy of foliage above, which is frequently fifty or sixty feet from the ground.  The genus I have now placed it in belongs to the _Coliadæ_, and appears to connect that family with the _Pieridæ_: their distinctions are obviously marked and very constant in all the species I have yet seen, and which are tropical: of these, seven I discovered in Brazil; three or four more are natives of the southern extremity of North America; and Dr. Horsfield has four or five from Java. I know of none from Africa. Their size in general is very small.  I think this species is the _Pieris Elvina_ of Godart; although the insect he mentions as the female is in reality that of his _Pieris Neda_. The true female I have never seen; I suspect it will want the gibbous curve on the hinder wings of the male, which sex is, indeed, not common, and is generally much smaller, and sometimes half the size only, of the figure.  _Papilio Nicippe_ of Cramer (tab. 210. fig. C. D.) strictly belongs to this genus, though placed in that of _Colias_ by Godart, as well as his _Pieris Agave_, _Hecabe_, and doubtless many others not now before me.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 23  [Illustration]  MITRA vittata.  _Ribbon Mitre._         *       *       *       *       *  CHARACTER GENERICUS.      _Testa inæqualiter fusiformis, spirâ productâ attenuatâ; labio     exteriore intùs edentato.

Banks, from the Pacific Ocean: it is now, together with his entire collection of shells and insects, in the Museum of the Linnæan Society.  It is of great rarity, and the present specimen far exceeds in size any I have yet seen. A very perfect one exists in my father's collection which measures only two inches one line long: it differs slightly in wanting the lower white band and its inferior border: there is also an additional small plait between the second and third, a variation not uncommon in the Linnæan Volutes, and which lessens the importance of this character as a specific distinction.  It is unfigured, and I believe undescribed, unless perhaps in Solander's MSS. In its small state it may have been overlooked as one of the numerous varieties of _M. vulpecula_; but the sharp angulated plaitings, the cancellated base, and the numerous faintly-grooved lines on the spire, as well as the more slender and lengthened form, will at once distinguish it: its colours also are very striking and dissimilar.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 24  [Illustration]  CONOELIX.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Testa coniformis; spira brevissima; labium exterius simplex; columella     plicata; apertura linearis, angusta, spirâ longior._  Typus Genericus _Conoelix lineatus_.

The present species varies more or less in the regularity of its tessellated markings. The inside of the mouth is brown, and the pillar has five plaits.
