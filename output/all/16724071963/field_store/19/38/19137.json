They had often been without food, he said,      although they had kept it. There was none to relieve them. He      stated that formerly they used to get credit from the merchants      while they were engaged at the fishing, but that they did not      get now. One of the houses visited in this township was that of      the wife of Donald Macmillan, one of the men now standing trial      in Edinburgh on a charge of having taken part in the Park deer      raid. Macmillan lived in a very small cot at the back of his      father's house, which his father had used as a barn. It was      very poorly furnished even for that locality. There was a      family of five small children, and there was only one bed in      the house, with one blanket. Three of the children slept out      with a neighbour. Macmillan cultivated the half of his father's      croft, and had one cow. He was also a fisherman, having a share      in a boat of forty-one feet keel; but, though he had attended      the Barra fishing last summer, he had made nothing. His wife      had got a boll of meal from the destitution fund, but besides      that, she had only two barrels of potatoes. Previous to getting      that meal, they had lived exclusively on potatoes. She stated      that when her husband went out to the deer raid, there was but      one barrel of potatoes; but since then, she explained, she had      fallen back upon the seed.\"  Here is another, from January 20th of the same year, when four columns were devoted to crofter affairs:       \"From here a drive of about four miles brought the visitors to      Arebruich--a township fixed in a spot which was surely never      intended for human beings. As one passes onwards from Balallan,      the soil gradually sinks lower and lower on the north side of      the loch until, when Arebruich is reached, it is almost level      to the water's edge. The result is that the land is literally      a floating bog, and it is a miracle how the poor people, who      labour away at the barren scraps of earth which show some signs      of cultivation, manage to get any food raised out of them. A      rude, clayish pathway extends for some little distance from the      main road, but it soon stops, as if the builders had thrown up      the work in disgust. There are sixteen crofts, such as they      are, in the township, and these are occupied by twenty-six      families. The first house visited was that of John Mackinnon, a      stout, good-looking man in spite of his surroundings. He lives      on his mother's lot, which is rented at £2.15s., exclusive of      taxes. His mother, who is eighty years old, lives, along with      an unmarried daughter, in an adjoining house. He paid 35s.      two years ago to the factor, but since then he has been able to      pay nothing. He fished as a hired man last year at Lybster; but      his earnings were so small that when his season's board was      paid he had only 9d. left. A friend had to lend him his      passage-money. At present he has three barrels of potatoes      left, but neither meal nor money. He has two of a family,      besides himself and wife. They have to live on potatoes. His      mother never got any parochial relief, and she and her daughter      have to struggle along as best they can. He has one cow and      eight sheep. When the destitution meal was being distributed he      got three stones, and his mother an equal quantity. He does not      know what to do, and has no prospects whatever. The next house      presented a worse case. It was that of Widow Murdo Macleod, a      sister of Mackinnon. She said her husband was drowned at Loch      Seaforth seven years ago, when they were only ten months      married. She had one daughter, who was born shortly after her      husband was drowned. She has made her living all these years by      knitting and sewing and odd jobs, but never got any help from      the Parochial Board, though she applied several times. She has      neither land nor stock, and never had any. She generally gets a      few potatoes from her brother at harvest time. She has half a      barrel on hand at present, and about a stone of meal, the      remains of what was got from the destitution fund. She always      tried to be industrious, and therefore was never actually in      absolute want. She always enjoyed good health, and felt very      thankful for it. The hut in which this woman and her daughter      live is wretchedly poor, and the single bed is barely covered      with a thin blanket.\"[A]   [A] See note at the end of Preface.  On January 20th, in a leader, the same paper declared that the facts which we have given are \"distressing,\" and ought to excite \"interest\" and sympathy. There is no talk here of sentimental nonsense! Distressing we should think they were. One cannot help saying that it is nothing less than infamous that a mere handful of landlords should have controlled the destiny of, and extracted every penny from, the population of these Islands--the people whom they have kept for generations in poverty, not that they might improve the land, but that they might pass their own time in useless idleness and cruel sport. It is not a question of over-population. The real evil is that the Islanders have been ground down and tyrannized over simply to gratify the amusements of their masters. We have heard again and again that the position of a landlord does not pay; if it did not, the landlords would sell their estates to-morrow.  For weeks, early in this year (1888), every Scotch and English paper, even to the _Times_, had columns about the misery of the crofters--that is, columns of extracts similar to these we have quoted. Whatever reasons were given for it, no one questioned their destitution. And yet within a year all these reports are forgotten; and for generalizing and not going into details--heart-breaking details--we are called sickly sentimentalists. So glaring is this complete forgetfulness and contradiction that we cannot help taking some notice of it, and calling the attention of these papers to their own reports.  As to the rest of our critics, they did not even know enough to contradict themselves, except in one case, which we have pointed out elsewhere, and their other criticism is not directed against our facts.  In dwelling upon the misery of the people, we do not pretend, as has been suggested, to give an off-hand settlement of the economic problems of the Islands. We merely state what we saw, what it was impossible to avoid seeing, wherever we went. It must be remembered that it is not merely a minority, or even a majority, but the entire population who exist in this condition of absolute wretchedness and semi-starvation. With the exception of a few small towns on the coast for the convenience of tourists and landlords, you find throughout the Islands but the occasional beautiful castle or shooting-lodge, or great farm-house, and the many crowded stone piles politely called cottages. And it was because we were more struck with this misery than with the romance of the past that, our journey over, we interested ourselves in learning something of the immediate reasons for the present condition of the Western Highlanders and Islanders, rather than in reading about the murders and massacres of the MacGregor and the Macleod, the Mac this and the Mac that. We were not blind to the beauty, the sternness, the wildness of the country; but the sadness and sorrows of its people impressed us even more than the wonder and beauty of their land.                                JOSEPH PENNELL.                               ELIZABETH ROBINS PENNELL.      WESTMINSTER, _November 20, 1888_.[B]   [B] Even while we revise this Preface more news comes from the   Island of Lewis. On Lady Matheson's estates rents have been reduced 42   and 53 per cent., and arrears cancelled 84 and 91 per cent. This is   from the _Times_ of December 20th:         \"CROFTERS' RENTS.--The Crofter Commission yesterday issued        their first decisions in relation to Lady Matheson's property        in the Island of Lewis, the centre of the land agitation last        winter. They have granted an average reduction of 42 per cent.        on the rental of 150 crofter tenants in the parish of Barvas,        on the west side of Lewis. The arrears of rent due, which was a        striking feature in Lewis, have been cancelled to the extent of        84 per cent. Of a total of £2422, the Commissioners have        cancelled £2043.\"    If there had not been injustice before, is it probable that there would   now be such wholesale reductions and cancellings? We suppose it is   _sentimentalism_ to record these facts.        CHRISTMAS-DAY, 1888.     CONTENTS.

We never looked forward to a pleasure trip with so much misery as we did to our journey to the Hebrides. We wanted a holiday.  \"Go to Scotland,\" suggested the editor of HARPER'S.  \"Let us rather wander through unexplored France,\" we proposed, in a long letter, though we had already explored it for ourselves more than once.  \"Scotland would be better,\" was the answer in a short note.  \"But why not let us discover unknown Holland?\" we asked, as if it had not been discovered a hundred times already.  \"Scotland would be better,\" was still the answer, and so to Scotland we went.  It was a country about which we cared little, and knew less. We had heard of Highlands and Lowlands, of Melrose and Stirling, but for our lives we could not have pointed them out on the map. The rest of our knowledge was made up of confused impressions of Hearts of Mid-Lothian and Painters' Camps in the Highlands, Macbeths and Kidnappers, Skye terriers and Shetland shawls, blasted heaths and hills of mist, Rob Roys and Covenanters; and, added to these, positive convictions of an unbroken Scotch silence and of endless breakfasts of oatmeal, dinners of haggis, and suppers of whiskey. Hot whiskey punch is a good thing in its way, and at times, but not as a steady diet. Oatmeal we think an abomination. And as for haggis--well, we only knew it as it was once described to us by a poet: the stomach of some animal filled with all sorts of unpleasant things and then sewed up. We recalled the real dinners and friendly peasants of France and Italy, and hated the very name of Scotland.  It will easily be understood that we could not plan a route out of our ignorance and prejudice. It remained to choose a guide, and our choice, I hardly know why, fell upon Dr. Johnson. Every one must remember--I say this though we did not even know it until we looked into the matter--that Dr. Johnson met Boswell in Edinburgh, and in his company journeyed up the east coast as far as Inverness, then across the Highlands to the west, and so to the Hebrides, coming back by way of Inverary, Loch Lomond, and Glasgow. It looked a long journey on the map, and seemed a weary one in the pages of Boswell and Johnson; but as if this were not bad enough, we made up our minds, for the sake of novelty, to walk.  Of our preparations for the journey I will say nothing. We carried less than Stanley and more than the average tramp. We took many things which we ought not to have taken, and we left behind many things which we ought to have taken. But this matters little, since our advice to all about to start on a walking tour is, _Don't_.  On the 28th of July we arrived in   EDINBURGH,  \"a city too well known to admit description.\" If Dr. Johnson thought so a hundred years ago, it is not for us, who propose to be his followers, to differ from him. Indeed, during our stay in that city, so eager were we to be faithful to him in all things that we should have allowed ourselves to be dined, teaed and suppered, even as he was, but for an obstacle. The only person whom we knew in Edinburgh was away, and the fame of our coming had not, as with Dr. Johnson, gone before us.  We were careful to find St. James's Court, where Boswell lived, and where clothes, drying in what sun there is, now hang from his windows. And we went to the old White Horse Inn, where the Doctor, on his arrival, stayed until Boswell came to carry him off in triumph; and where probably the tourist of another year will not go, for already in the court-yard are signs of the coming of the destroyer.  We had resolved to reverse the order of their journey by going to the Western Islands first, and coming home along the east coast. In this way we should avoid the September storms which kept them in the Hebrides. Now we also decided to go straight to Glasgow, and not to stop at Hamilton, where they spent a night.  On Saturday, July 30th, we began our walk in a cab, and continued it for many miles in a railway-carriage. We represented to ourselves that the country between Edinburgh and Glasgow, of which we knew nothing, was stupid, and that we must get to Glasgow for Sunday. There was no earthly reason for this, but it was an excuse, and we made the most of it.  Dr. Johnson says that \"to describe a city so much frequented as   GLASGOW  is unnecessary,\" and again we are willing to take his word for it. But its Cathedral was the first of the many surprises Scotland had in store for us. We had heard of it, but that was all. One young lady of Glasgow, fresh from a tour on the Continent, told us that she had never seen it. We were therefore prepared to find it no great thing. The exterior did not disappoint our expectations, but we have seldom been more impressed with an interior, and this though we had just come from the loveliest churches of England.  The crypt, or rather the under church, is its pride, as indeed it well may be. A verger stood smoking a pipe at the south door, and we told him what we thought. J----, after three years' work in the English cathedrals, felt himself no mean authority.  \"It's the finest in the world,\" said the verger.  \"In Great Britain perhaps, but not in Europe,\" said J----; for we had been but a moment before comparing it, as it now is, a cold, bare, show-place, to the under church of Assisi with the frescos on the walls, the old lamps burning before altars, the sweet smell of incense, and the monks kneeling in prayer.  \"I only tell you what those _qualified_ have said,\" and the verger settled the matter and J----'s pretensions.  It was in the Glasgow crypt Rob Roy gave the warning to Frank Osbaldistone. The guide-book recalled the incident, which we had forgotten. Indeed the farther we went, the more we were reminded that to travel in Scotland is to travel through the Waverley Novels, and that these to us were but a name. Since our return we have tried to read them again, to be quite honest, with but indifferent pleasure. We are so wanting in appreciation that we find Scott's description of the crypt stupid, and we are not thrilled by the daring deeds of the MacGregor.  The Art Gallery in Glasgow was no less a surprise to us than the Cathedral. Its catalogue contains more Titians, Rembrandts. Hobbemas, and other great masters than any other in Europe. But if we wondered at the catalogue, we were still more astonished when we came to see the pictures!  We stayed in Glasgow until Monday morning, when we again took the train, but this time for a few miles only. We bought tickets for Kilpatrick, and a sharp lookout we had to keep for it from the carriage windows. At the stations, no one called the names, which, in true British fashion, were less easy to find than that of the best brand of mustard or of the best hotel in Glasgow. At Kilpatrick, when I pulled my head in after the usual search, J---- was already at the opposite door. He did not care where he was, he said; he would get out. In the distance, we could see Dumbarton Rock rising from the plain against a blue sky. Here, as in our plans for the day's journey, it was the one prominent landmark.  Kilpatrick is said to have been the birthplace of St. Patrick. I do not know what authority Black[C] has for the legend; certainly not that of the villagers. St. Patrick was no British man, one of them told us; and, moreover, he never lived in Kilpatrick, but on the hill. But had we ever heard of Captain Shonstone, the hairbor-maister? He was a great man.   [C] Not William, but the guide-book Black.  We made a great show of briskness by going the long way round by the canal. This was the only time throughout our journey that we turned from the main road--except to take a short-cut. Mr. Lee Meriwether, in his Tramp Abroad, thought it an advantage of walking that he could leave the road to see whatever was to be seen near, but not from it. For our part, after the first mile, we never took an extra step for any sight; that is, whenever our knapsacks were on our backs. At Dumbarton we did not even climb the rock, though Dr. Johnson walked to the very top. Instead, we lunched and talked politics with the British workman in a coffee tavern.  After Dumbarton, we left the Clyde to follow the Leven. It was just beyond the town we first saw Ben-Lomond, a blue shadow on the horizon when the clouds were heavy above; a high bare mountain, seamed and riven, when the sun shone upon it. We lost sight of it in a succession of long,"]]]
