While Jean cleared away the dishes, the Shepherd drew his chair to the fire and beckoned Alan to him.  \"Come here, laddie,\" he said, \"and give us a look at your plaidie. It's been lying there in the kist, and I've not seen a sight of it since I was a lad. It's the Campbell plaid, ye ken, and I mind once when I was a lad I was on my way home from the kirk and a hare crossed my path. It's ill luck for a hare to cross your path, and fine I proved it. I clean forgot it was the Sabbath and louped the dyke after him. My kiltie caught on a stone, and there I was hanging upside down. My father loosed me, but my kiltie was torn and I had to go to bed without my supper for breaking the Sabbath.\"  \"Is the hole there yet?\" asked Jean.  \"Na, na;\" said the Shepherd. \"You didn't think your grandmother was such a thriftless wifie as that! She mended the hole so that you could never find where it had been.\"  He examined fold after fold carefully.  \"There, now,\" he exclaimed at last, \"if you want to see mending that would make you proud to wear it, look at that.\"  Jean and Jock stuck their heads over his shoulder, and Alan twisted himself nearly in two trying to see his own back.  \"We have a plaid a good deal like this,\" said Alan, looking closely at the pattern. \"My mother's name was McGregor, but she has relations named Campbell.\"  \"Are you really a Scotch body, then?\" cried Robin with new interest in Alan. \"I thought you were an English boy.\"  \"I live in London,\" Alan answered, \"but my mother's people are all Scotch, and she loves Scotland. That's one reason why she sent me up here to be with Eppie McLean.\"  \"Losh, mannie,\" cried the Shepherd, \"if you have Campbell relatives and your mother's name was McGregor, it's likely you are a descendant from old Rob Roy himself, and if so, we're all kinsmen. Inversnaid, where Rob Roy's cave is, is but a few miles from here, and it was in this very country that he hid himself among rocks and caves, giving to the poor with his left hand what he took from the rich with his right. Well, well, laddie, the old clans are scattered now, but blood is thicker than water still, and you're welcome to the fireside of your kinsman!\"  \"Is he really a relation?\" cried Jean and Jock eagerly.  \"Well,\" said the Scotchman cautiously, \"I'm not saying he is precisely, but I'm not saying he is not, either. The Campbells and the McGregors have lived in these parts for better than two hundred years, and it's not likely that Alan could lay claim to both names and be no relation at all. If there were still clans, as there used to be in the old days, we'd all belong to the same one, and that I do not doubt.\"  \"I'm sure I'd like that,\" said Alan, and Jock was so delighted with his new relative that he stood on his head in the middle of the floor to express his feelings. When the excitement had died down a bit, Alan drew his stool up beside the Shepherd's knee and said: \"Won't you please tell us about Rob Roy, Cousin Campbell? If he's an ancestor of mine, I ought to know more about him.\"  \"Oh, do, Father,\" echoed the Twins, planting their stools beside the other knee. Even Tam was interested. He sat on the hearth in front of the Shepherd, looking up into his face as if he understood every word.  The Shepherd gazed thoughtfully into the fire for a moment; then he said: \"I can tell you what my grandsire told me, and he got it from his grandsire, so it must be true. In the beginning Rob Roy was as staunch a man as any, and held his own property like other gentlemen. Craig Royston was the name of his place, and fine and proud he was of it, too. He was a gey shrewd man in the cattle-dealing, and his neighbor, the Duke of Montrose, thinking to benefit his own estate, lent Rob money to set him up in the trade. There was a pawky rascal named McDonald who was partner to Rob, and didn't he run away with the money, leaving Rob in debt to the Duke and nothing to pay him with? The Duke foreclosed on Rob at once, and took away Craig Royston and added it to his own estate. You can well believe that Rob was not the man to take such dealings with patience. If the Duke had not been so hasty, Rob would more than likely have got hold of McDonald and made him pay either out of his purse or out of his skin, but he did neither the one nor the other. Instead he left his home and took his clan with him into the mountains and became the terror of the whole country-side.\"  \"Wasn't he a good man?\" asked Jean, gazing at her father with round eyes.  \"Well,\" said the Shepherd, \"not just what you'd call pious, maybe, and it cannot be said that he was aye regular at the kirk. It's true he never forgot an enemy, but he never forgot a kindness either and was loyal and true to them that were true to him.\"  \"What did he do when they weren't true to him?\" asked Jock.  \"He made them wish they had been,\" replied the Shepherd mildly.  \"But what made the Duke of Montrose take away Craig Royston?\" asked Jock. \"Didn't he have a great big place of his own?\"  \"Aye,\" answered Robin, \"but what difference does that make? The more land he had, the more land he wanted, the same as other lairds. Be that as it may, Craig Royston was certainly taken away from Rob, and a bitter man it made of him.\"  \"Why, it's just like ourselves and the Auld Laird,\" cried Jean. \"He's going to take away our home from us!\"  \"It's not just the same, little woman,\" said the Shepherd, laying his big brown hand on Jean's small one on his knee. \"But the loss of it hurts just the same. Rob Roy loved Craig Royston no better than we love this wee bit hoosie.\"  \"But why must you go, then?\" asked Alan, his eyes shining with interest and sympathy.  \"You see; lad,\" answered the Shepherd, \"it's like the tale of the dog in the manger. The Auld Laird will neither use the land nor let us.\" He explained about the lease, and when he had finished, Alan said, \"But what will you do when you leave this place?\"  \"I'm spiering the same question myself,\" answered the Shepherd. \"As yet I dinna ken.\"  \"I tell you what,\" shouted Jock, springing to his feet and knocking over his stool. \"Why don't we live in the caves the way Rob Roy did? If the Crumpets and all the people who have to give up their homes should band together in a clan and hide themselves in the glen, the Auld Laird could send all the Mr. Craigies and Angus Niels in the world after us and they'd never get us!\"  The Shepherd smiled and shook his head. \"The time for that has gone by,\" he said sadly. \"Na, na, we must just submit. But one thing I do know, and that is, we'll not seek a place with the Laird of Kinross. They say he will let his land to none but members of the Established Church, and I'll not give up my religion for any man not if I'm forever walking the world!\"  \"But come, now,\" he went on, seeing them downcast, \"you all have faces on you as long as a summer Sabbath. Cheer up, and I'll tell you a tale my grandfather told me of the water cow of Loch Leven. You mind the song says, 'The Campbells are coming from bonnie Loch Leven.' Well, it was around that loch that the Campbells pastured their cattle. One day when my grandsire was a young lad he was playing with some other children on the pastures near the shore, when all of a sudden what should they see among their own cows but a fine young dun-colored heifer without any horns. She was lying by herself on the green grass, chewing her cud and looking so gentle and pretty that the children played around her without fear. They wound a wreath of daisies and put it on her neck, and then they got on her back. The cow stretched out longer and longer to make room for them until they were all on her back except my grandsire. Then all of a sudden the dun cow rose up, first on her hind legs, tipping the children all forward, and then on her forelegs tipping them all back ward, yet no one fell off at all, and when she was up on her feet, didn't she start straight away for the deep waters of the loch? The children screamed and tried to get off her back, but no matter how hard they tried, there they stuck. My grandsire ran screaming toward them, and put up his hand to pull them down, and his finger touched the dun cow's back! Now never believe me, if his finger didn't stick so he could not pull it away, and by that he knew the dun heifer for a water cow and that she had bewitched the children. He was being dragged along with them toward the water, when all of a sudden he slipped out his knife and with one blow chopped off his own finger and he was wanting that finger till the day of his death.\"  \"What became of the others?\" gasped Alan, his black eyes glowing like coals.  \"They went on the dun cow's back into the lake, and the water closed over them and they were never seen again,\" said the Shepherd, \"and that's the end of the tale.\"  While the Shepherd talked, the twilight had deepened into darkness, the fire had died down, and the corners of the room were filled with mysterious tricky shadows that danced with the flickering flames on the hearth. Jean looked fearfully over her shoulder. There was a creepy feeling in the back of her neck, and Jock's eyes were as round as door-knobs. The Shepherd laughed at them.  \"Good children have little to fear from the fairy folk,\" he said. \"Come, now, your eyes are fair sticking out of your heads. I'll give you a skirl on the bagpipes if Jeanie'll bring them from the closet. Jock, stir up the fire, and Alan, give your clothes a turn and see if they are drying.\"  The children ran to do these errands, and in a moment the fire was flaming gayly up the chimney, chasing the murky shadows out of the corners and making the room bright and cheerful again, while the Shepherd, tucking the bag under his arm, stirred the echoes on old Ben Vane with the wild strains of \"Bonnie"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4086"],["title","The Scotch Twins (#6)"],["body"," Doon\" and \"Over the Water to Charlie.\" At last he struck up the music of the Highland Fling, and the three children sprang to the middle of the floor and danced the wild Scotch dance together.  Just as the fun was at its height, and Alan, looking very handsome in his kilts, was doing the heel and toe with great energy, there came a loud rap at the door. Instantly everything stopped, just as short as Cinderella's ball did when the clock struck twelve, and the Shepherd, laying aside his bagpipes, opened the door. There stood a man with a bundle on his arm. \"Eppie McLean sent these clothes to the lad,\" he said, handing the bundle to the Shepherd, \"and he's to come back along with me.\" Alan took the bundle, thanked the man, and disappeared with Jock into \"the room,\" where he changed his clothes, returning the kilts, with regret, to Jock. \"I've had just a grand day,\" he said to Jean and the Shepherd as he shook hands and took leave of them in the kitchen afterward. \"I'll be back to-morrow for my clothes.\"  \"Come back and play then,\" said Jock.  When he was gone, Jean folded the kilts away in the closet again. \"He's a fine braw laddie,\" said the Shepherd.  \"Aye,\" said Jock. \"He had two suits of clothes, one as good as the other, but he was not proud.\"  \"I wonder what his father's work is,\" said Jean.  \"He never spoke of his father at all, just his mother,\" said Jock, and at that moment the wag-at-the-wall clock struck nine.  \"Havers!\" said Jean. \"Look at the hour, Jock Campbell! Get you to your bed.\"     VI. TWO DISCOVERIES   That night Jock dreamed of water cows, and clans dressed in kilts, and when Sandy appeared the next morning, his head was still buzzing with wild schemes of adventure.  \"Come awa', Sandy,\" he said, \"let's explore. We'll go up the burn and see if we can't find out where it begins.\"  \"What'll we do for lunch?\" asked Sandy, who was practical. \"I brought a scone with me--but it'll never be enough for two.\"  \"Ho!\" said Jock. \"If Rob Roy and all his men could live in caves all the time and take care of themselves, I guess we can do it for one day. We can fish, and maybe we might find some birds' eggs. I'm not afraid.\"  \"What about Alan?\" asked Jean.  \"If he comes to play, tell him to follow us right up the burn and keep whistling the pewit's call three times over, and if we don't see him, we'll hear him,\" said Jock. \"There's no danger of not finding us if he follows the water,\" and he and Sandy set forth at once.  Jean had finished her work and was wondering what to do with the long day which stretched before her, when Alan came running up the hill and burst into the kitchen.  \"Look here what I've got, Jean,\" he said, thumping a parcel down on the kitchen table and tearing it open. \"Eppie put this up for me.\"  Jean looked and there was a whole pound of bacon, three big scones, and a dozen eggs. \"Save us!\" cried Jean, clasping her hands in admiration. \"What will you do with it all?\"  \"I'll show you!\" said Alan. \"Where's Jock?\"  \"He and Sandy have gone up the burn, exploring,\" said Jean. \"They said you were to follow, and if you didn't find them, keep whistling the pewit's call three times till they answered you.\"  \"What is the pewit's call?\" asked Alan.  \"Michty me!\" said Jean. \"Think of not knowing that!\" She pursed up her lips and whistled \"Pee-wit, pee-wit, pee-wit.\"  \"You see, we don't have them in London;\" Alan apologetically explained, \"unless it's in the Zoo; but I say, Jean, aren't you coming, too? You're as good as a boy any day. Come along!\"  \"All right,\" said Jean. \"I wanted to dreadfully. I'll get a basket for the lunch.\" She went to the closet and brought out a basket which her father had made out of split willow twigs, packed the lunch in it, and off they started.  They passed the place where the fish-bones were buried, and the spot where Alan had fallen into the water the day before, and then plunged into the deep pine forest which filled the glen and covered the mountain-sides. The pine-needles lay thick on the ground, and above them the pine boughs waved in the breeze, making a soft sighing sound, \"like a giant breathing,\" Jean said. The silence deepened as they went farther and farther into the woods. There was only the purring of the water, the occasional snapping of a twig, or the lonely cry of a bird to break the stillness. It was dark, too, except where the sunshine, breaking through the thick branches overhead, made spots of golden light upon the pine-needles.  \"It's almost solemn; isn't it?\" said Jean to Alan in a hushed voice. \"I was never so far in the woods before.\"  \"I wonder which side of the burn the boys went. If we should take the wrong side, we might not find them,\" said Alan.  \"Let's whistle,\" said Jean. She puckered her lips and gave the pewit call, but there was no answer.  \"Perhaps they didn't hear it because the burn makes such a noise. It keeps growing louder and louder,\" said Alan.  Whistling and listening for an answer at every few steps, they climbed over rocks and fallen trees, keeping as close as possible to the stream, until suddenly they found themselves gazing up at a beautiful waterfall which came gushing from a pile of giant rocks reaching up among the topmost boughs of the pines.  \"Oh, it's bonny! but how shall we get up?\" cried Jean.  \"We must just find a way,\" said Alan.  \"It's a grand place for robbers and poachers,\" said Jean, looking fearsomely at the cliffs stretching far above them. \"Angus Niel says the forests are full of them.\"  \"I'd as soon meet a poacher as Angus Niel himself,\" said Alan, laughing, \"but I'm not afraid as long as you're with me. It's Angus that's afraid of you, Jock says.\"  Jean laughed too. \"I'm not afraid when I'm in my own kitchen, but it's different in the woods,\" she said.  Alan had been nosing around among the rocks as they talked, getting nearer and nearer to the fall, and now he suddenly disappeared, and for a few moments Jean was quite alone in the woods. Soon Alan reappeared from behind the fall itself and beckoned her to follow him.  Jean was looking at the wall of rock which loomed above them. \"Sal!\" she remarked, \"we'll be needing wings to get up there, or we'll smash all the eggs for sure.\"  For answer Alan popped out of sight again behind the fall, and Jean, following closely in his wake, was just in time to catch sight of his legs as he dived into a hole opening into the rocky wall. The cliff from which the water plunged overhung the rocks below in such a way that she could pass behind the veil of water without getting wet at all.  Into this mysterious opening behind the fall Jean followed her leader, and found herself climbing a narrow dry channel through which the stream had once forced its way. It was a hard, rough scramble up a narrow passage worn by the water and through holes almost too small to squeeze through, but at last she saw Alan's heels just disappearing over the edge of a jutting rock and knew they were coming out into daylight again. An instant later Alan's head appeared in the opening, his hand reached down to help her up, and with one last effort she came out upon an open ledge and looked about her.  She could not help an exclamation of delight at what she saw. The rock was so high that they could look out over the treetops clear to the slope where the little gray house stood. The waterfall, plunging from a still higher level, made a barrier on one side of them, and on the other side the cliff rose, a sheer wall of rock. Between the wall of water and the wall of rock there was a cave extending into the solid rock for a distance of about twenty feet. There was absolutely no way of reaching this fastness except through the hidden stair, and one might wander for years through the forest and never see it at all.  \"Oh,\" exclaimed Jean, \"it's wonderful! How Jock will love this place! Don't you believe this very cave was used by Rob Roy and his men?\" and Alan, swelling with pride to think he had found it all himself, said yes, he was sure of it.  \"I tell you what we'll do,\" cried Alan, a minute later. \"We'll just leave the basket here in the cave, and when we've found the boys we'll come back and have our lunch here.\"  They tucked the basket away out of sight on a rocky shelf in the cave, and found their way down the steep rough stairway to the bed of the stream again and, making a wide detour, came out above the fall. They struggled on for nearly a mile farther still without finding any trace of the boys, and were beginning to be discouraged, when they saw a break in the trees with glimpses of blue sky beyond, and a few moments later came out upon the shores of a tiny mountain lake, shining like a beautiful blue jewel in the dark setting of the pine trees on its banks.  Beyond the lake the purple peaks of higher mountains made a ragged outline against the sky. The sun was now almost directly overhead; the waters of the lake were still, and its lovely shores were mirrored on the placid surface. A great eagle soared in stately circles in the deep blue sky. It was so beautiful and so still that the children stood a moment among the rocks where the tarn emptied itself into the mountain stream to look at it.  \"It's just the place for a water cow, or a horse maybe,\" Jean whispered to Alan.  \"Sh!\" was Alan's only reply. He seized Jean's hand and dragged hear down behind a rock and pointed toward the south. There, coming out of the woods, was a beautiful stag. It poised its noble head, and sniffed the air, as if it suspected there might be human beings about, and then stepped daintily to the lake-shore and bent to drink. Its lips had scarcely touched the water when the children were startled by the loud report of a gun.  \"Poachers,\" gasped Jean, hiding her face and wishing they had never come. \"Oh, where are Jock and Sandy?\" Her only thought was to make herself as small as possible and keep out of sight behind the rocks, but Alan peered through the screen of bushes which hid the rock and made violent"]]]
