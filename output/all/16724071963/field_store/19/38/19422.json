We came in more to shelter from the rain than anything.\"  \"You did, did you?\"  Jimmy felt that it behooved him to stand on his dignity. The situation demanded it.  \"Why,\" he said with some hauteur, \"in the ordinary course of business I should hardly waste time over a small crib like--\"  \"It's banks fer his,\" murmured Spike, rapturously. \"He eats dem alive. An' jools from duchesses.\"  \"I admit a partiality for jewels and duchesses,\" said Jimmy. \"And, now, as it's a little late, perhaps we had better--Ready, Spike? Good-night, then. Pleased to have met you.\"  \"I'll see you at my office.\"  \"I may possibly look in. I shall be doing very little work in New York, I fancy. I am here merely on a vacation.\"  \"If you do any work at all,\" said the policeman coldly, \"you'll look in at my office, or you'll wish you had when it's too late.\"  \"Of course, of course. I shouldn't dream of omitting any formality that may be usual. But I don't fancy I shall break my vacation. By the way, one little thing. Have you any objections to my carving a J on your front-door?\"  The policeman stared.  \"On the inside. It won't show. It's just a whim of mine. If you have no objection?\"  \"I don't want any of your--\" began the policeman.  \"You misunderstand me. It's only that it means paying for a dinner. I wouldn't for the world--\"  The policeman pointed to the window.  \"Out you get,\" he said, abruptly. \"I've had enough of you. And don't you forget to come to my office.\"  Spike, still deeply mistrustful of the bull-dog Rastus, jumped at the invitation. He was through the window and out of sight in the friendly darkness almost before the policeman had finished speaking. Jimmy remained.  \"I shall be delighted--\" he had begun. Then, he stopped. In the doorway was standing a girl--a girl whom he recognized. Her startled look told him that she, too, had recognized him.  Not for the first time since he had set out from his flat that night in Spike's company, Jimmy was conscious of a sense of the unreality of things. It was all so exactly as it would have happened in a dream! He had gone to sleep thinking of this girl, and here she was. But a glance at the man with the revolver brought him back to earth. There was nothing of the dream-world about the police-captain.  That gentleman, whose back was toward the door, had not observed the addition to the company. Molly had turned the handle quietly, and her slippered feet made no sound. It was the amazed expression on Jimmy's face that caused the captain to look toward the door.  \"Molly!\"  The girl smiled, though her face was white. Jimmy's evening clothes had reassured her. She did not understand how he came to be there, but evidently there was nothing wrong. She had interrupted a conversation, not a conflict.  \"I heard the noise and you going downstairs, and I sent the dogs down to help you, father,\" she said. \"And, then, after a little, I came down to see if you were all right.\"  Mr. McEachern was perplexed. Molly's arrival had put him in an awkward position. To denounce the visitor as a cracksman was now impossible, for he knew too much. The only real fear of the policeman's life was lest some word of his money-making methods might come to his daughter's ears.  Quite a brilliant idea came to him.  \"A man broke in, my dear,\" he said. \"This gentleman was passing, and saw him.\"  \"Distinctly,\" said Jimmy. \"An ugly-looking customer!\"  \"But he slipped out of the window, and got away,\" concluded the policeman.  \"He was very quick,\" said Jimmy. \"I think he may have been a professional acrobat.\"  \"He didn't hurt you, father?\"  \"No, no, my dear.\"  \"Perhaps I frightened him,\" said Jimmy, airily.  Mr. McEachern scowled furtively at him.  \"We mustn't detain you, Mr.-\"  \"Pitt,\" said Jimmy. \"My name is Pitt.\" He turned to Molly. \"I hope you enjoyed the voyage.\"  The policeman started.  \"You know my daughter?\"  \"By sight only, I'm afraid. We were fellow-passengers on the Lusitania. Unfortunately, I was in the second-cabin. I used to see your daughter walking the deck sometimes.\"  Molly smiled.  \"I remember seeing you--sometimes.\"  McEachern burst out.  \"Then, you--!\"  He stopped, and looked at Molly. The girl was bending over Rastus, tickling him under the ear.  \"Let me show you the way out, Mr. Pitt,\" said the policeman, shortly. His manner was abrupt, but when one is speaking to a man whom one would dearly love to throw out of the window, abruptness is almost unavoidable.  \"Perhaps I should be going,\" said Jimmy.  \"Good-night, Mr. Pitt,\" said Molly.  \"I hope we shall meet again,\" said Jimmy.  \"This way, Mr. Pitt,\" growled McEachern, holding the door.  \"Please don't trouble,\" said Jimmy. He went to the window, and, flinging his leg over the sill, dropped noiselessly to the ground.  He turned and put his head in at the window again.  \"I did that rather well,\" he said, pleasantly. \"I think I must take up this--sort of thing as a profession. Good-night.\"     CHAPTER VIII  AT DREEVER   In the days before he began to expend his surplus energy in playing Rugby football, the Welshman was accustomed, whenever the monotony of his everyday life began to oppress him, to collect a few friends and make raids across the border into England, to the huge discomfort of the dwellers on the other side. It was to cope with this habit that Dreever Castle, in the county of Shropshire, came into existence. It met a long-felt want. In time of trouble, it became a haven of refuge. From all sides, people poured into it, emerging cautiously when the marauders had disappeared. In the whole history of the castle, there is but one instance recorded of a bandit attempting to take the place by storm, and the attack was an emphatic failure. On receipt of a ladleful of molten lead, aimed to a nicety by one John, the Chaplain (evidently one of those sporting parsons), this warrior retired, done to a turn, to his mountain fastnesses, and was never heard of again. He would seem, however, to have passed the word around among his friends, for subsequent raiding parties studiously avoided the castle, and a peasant who had succeeded in crossing its threshold was for the future considered to be \"home\" and out of the game.  Such was the Dreever of old. In later days, the Welshman having calmed down considerably, it had lost its militant character. The old walls still stood, gray, menacing and unchanged, but they were the only link with the past. The castle was now a very comfortable country-house, nominally ruled over by Hildebrand Spencer Poynt de Burgh John Hannasyde Coombe-Crombie, twelfth Earl of Dreever (\"Spennie\" to his relatives and intimates), a light-haired young gentleman of twenty-four, but in reality the possession of his uncle and aunt, Sir Thomas and Lady Julia Blunt.  Lord Dreever's position was one of some embarrassment. At no point in their history had the Dreevers been what one might call a parsimonious family. If a chance presented itself of losing money in a particularly wild and futile manner, the Dreever of the period had invariably sprung at it with the vim of an energetic blood-hound. The South Sea Bubble absorbed two hundred thousand pounds of good Dreever money, and the remainder of the family fortune was squandered to the ultimate penny by the sportive gentleman who held the title in the days of the Regency, when Watier's and the Cocoa Tree were in their prime, and fortunes had a habit of disappearing in a single evening. When Spennie became Earl of Dreever, there was about one dollar and thirty cents in the family coffers.  This is the point at which Sir Thomas Blunt breaks into Dreever history. Sir Thomas was a small, pink, fussy, obstinate man with a genius for trade and the ambition of an Alexander the Great; probably one of the finest and most complete specimens of the came-over-Waterloo-Bridge-with-half-a crown-in-my-pocket-and-now-look-at-me class of millionaires in existence. He had started almost literally with nothing. By carefully excluding from his mind every thought except that of making money, he had risen in the world with a gruesome persistence which nothing could check. At the age of fifty-one, he was chairman of Blunt's Stores, L't'd, a member of Parliament (silent as a wax figure, but a great comfort to the party by virtue of liberal contributions to its funds), and a knight. This was good, but he aimed still higher; and, meeting Spennie's aunt, Lady Julia Coombe-Crombie, just at the moment when, financially, the Dreevers were at their lowest ebb, he had effected a very satisfactory deal by marrying her, thereby becoming, as one might say, Chairman of Dreever, L't'd. Until Spennie should marry money, an act on which his chairman vehemently insisted, Sir Thomas held the purse, and except in minor matters ordered by his wife, of whom he stood in uneasy awe, had things entirely his own way.  One afternoon, a little over a year after the events recorded in the preceding chapter, Sir Thomas was in his private room, looking out of the window, from which the view was very beautiful. The castle stood on a hill, the lower portion of which, between the house and the lake, had been cut into broad terraces. The lake itself and its island with the little boat-house in the center gave a glimpse of fairyland.  But it was not altogether the beauty of the view that had drawn Sir Thomas to the window. He was looking at it chiefly because the position enabled him to avoid his wife's eye; and just at the moment he was rather anxious to avoid his wife's eye. A somewhat stormy board-meeting was in progress, and Lady Julia, who constituted the board of directors, had been heckling the chairman. The point under discussion was one of etiquette, and in matters of etiquette Sir Thomas felt himself at a disadvantage.  \"I tell you, my dear,\" he said to the window, \"I am not easy in my mind.\"  \"Nonsense,\" snapped Lady Julia; \"absurd--ridiculous!\"  Lady Julia Blunt, when conversing, resembled a Maxim gun more than anything "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],["title","The Intrusion of Jimmy (#8)"],["body","else.  \"But your diamonds, my dear.\"  \"We can take care of them.\"  \"But why should we have the trouble? Now, if we--\"  \"It's no trouble.\"  \"When we were married, there was a detective--\"  \"Don't be childish, Thomas. Detectives at weddings are quite customary.\"  \"But--\"  \"Bah!\"  \"I paid twenty thousand pounds for that rope of diamonds,\" said Sir Thomas, obstinately. Switch things upon a cash basis, and he was more at ease.  \"May I ask if you suspect any of our guests of being criminals?\" inquired Lady Julia, with a glance of chill disdain.  Sir Thomas looked out of the window. At the moment, the sternest censor could have found nothing to cavil at in the movements of such of the house-party as were in sight. Some were playing tennis, some clock-golf, and others were smoking.  \"Why, no,\" he admitted.  \"Of course. Absurd--quite absurd!\"  \"But the servants. We have engaged a number of new servants lately.\"  \"With excellent recommendations.\"  Sir Thomas was on the point of suggesting that the recommendations might be forged, but his courage failed him. Julia was sometimes so abrupt in these little discussions! She did not enter into his point of view. He was always a trifle inclined to treat the castle as a branch of Blunt's Stores. As proprietor of the stores, he had made a point of suspecting everybody, and the results had been excellent. In Blunt's Stores, you could hardly move in any direction without bumping into a gentlemanly detective, efficiently disguised. For the life of him, Sir Thomas could not see why the same principle should not obtain at Dreever. Guests at a country house do not as a rule steal their host's possessions, but then it is only an occasional customer at a store who goes in for shop-lifting. It was the principle of the thing, he thought: Be prepared against every emergency. With Sir Thomas Blunt, suspiciousness was almost a mania. He was forced to admit that the chances were against any of his guests exhibiting larcenous tendencies, but, as for the servants, he thoroughly mistrusted them all, except Saunders, the butler. It had seemed to him the merest prudence that a detective from a private inquiry agency should be installed at the castle while the house was full. Somewhat rashly, he had mentioned this to his wife, and Lady Julia's critique of the scheme had been terse and unflattering.  \"I suppose,\" said Lady Julia sarcastically, \"you will jump to the conclusion that this man whom Spennie is bringing down with him to-day is a criminal of some sort?\"  \"Eh? Is Spennie bringing a friend?\"  There was not a great deal of enthusiasm in Sir Thomas's voice. His nephew was not a young man whom he respected very highly. Spennie regarded his uncle with nervous apprehension, as one who would deal with his short-comings with vigor and severity. Sir Thomas, for his part, looked on Spennie as a youth who would get into mischief unless under his uncle's eye.  \"I had a telegram from him just now,\" Lady Julia explained.  \"Who is his friend?\"  \"He doesn't say. He just says he's a man he met in London.\"  \"H'm!\"  \"And what does, 'H'm!' mean?\" demanded Lady Julia.  \"A man can pick up strange people in London,\" said Sir Thomas, judicially.  \"Nonsense!\"  \"Just as you say, my dear.\"  Lady Julia rose.  \"As for what you suggest about the detective, it is of course absolutely absurd.\"  \"Quite so, my dear.\"  \"You mustn't think of it.\"  \"Just as you say, my dear.\"  Lady Julia left the room.  What followed may afford some slight clue to the secret of Sir Thomas Blunt's rise in the world. It certainly suggests singleness of purpose, which is one of the essentials of success.  No sooner had the door closed behind Lady Julia than he went to his writing-table, took pen and paper, and wrote the following letter:  To the Manager, Wragge's Detective Agency. Holborn Bars, London E. C.  SIR: With reference to my last of the 28th, ult., I should be glad if you would send down immediately one of your best men. Am making arrangements to receive him. Kindly instruct him to present himself at Dreever Castle as applicant for position of valet to myself. I will see and engage him on his arrival, and further instruct him in his duties.  Yours faithfully,  THOS. BLUNT.  P. S. I shall expect him to-morrow evening. There is a good train leaving Paddington at 2:15.  Sir Thomas read this over, put in a comma, then placed it in an envelope, and lighted a cigar with the air of one who can be checked, yes, but vanquished, never.     CHAPTER IX  FRIENDS, NEW AND OLD   On the night of the day on which Sir Thomas Blunt wrote and dispatched his letter to Wragge's Detective Agency, Jimmy Pitt chanced to stop at the Savoy.  If you have the money and the clothes, and do not object to being turned out into the night just as you are beginning to enjoy yourself, there are few things pleasanter than supper at the Savoy Hotel, London. But, as Jimmy sat there, eying the multitude through the smoke of his cigarette, he felt, despite all the brightness and glitter, that this was a flat world, and that he was very much alone in it.  A little over a year had passed since the merry evening at Police-Captain McEachern's. During that time, he had covered a good deal of new ground. His restlessness had reasserted itself. Somebody had mentioned Morocco in his hearing, and a fortnight later he was in Fez.  Of the principals in that night's drama, he had seen nothing more. It was only when, after walking home on air, rejoicing over the strange chance that had led to his finding and having speech with the lady of the Lusitania, he had reached Fifty-Ninth Street, that he realized how he had also lost her. It suddenly came home to him that not only did he not know her address, but he was ignorant of her name. Spike had called the man with the revolver \"boss\" throughout--only that and nothing more. Except that he was a police-captain, Jimmy knew as little about the man as he had before their meeting. And Spike, who held the key to the mystery, had vanished. His acquaintances of that night had passed out of his life like figures in a waking dream. As far as the big man with the pistol was concerned, this did not distress him. He had known that massive person only for about a quarter of an hour, but to his thinking that was ample. Spike he would have liked to meet again, but he bore the separation with much fortitude. There remained the girl of the ship; and she had haunted him with unfailing persistence during every one of the three hundred and eighty-four days that had passed since their meeting.  It was the thought of her that had made New York seem cramped. For weeks, Jimmy had patrolled the likely streets, the Park, and Riverside Drive, in the hope of meeting her. He had gone to the theaters and restaurants, but with no success. Sometimes, he had wandered through the Bowery, on the chance of meeting Spike. He had seen red heads in profusion, but never again that of his young disciple in the art of burglary. In the end, he had wearied of the other friends of the Strollers, had gone out again on his wanderings. He was greatly missed, especially by that large section of his circle which was in a perpetual state of wanting a little to see it through till Saturday. For years, Jimmy had been to these unfortunates a human bank on which they could draw at will. It offended them that one of those rare natures which are always good for two dollars at any hour of the day should be allowed to waste itself on places like Morocco and Spain--especially Morocco, where, by all accounts, there were brigands with almost a New York sense of touch.  They argued earnestly with Jimmy. They spoke of Raisuli and Kaid MacLean. But Jimmy was not to be stopped. The gad-fly was vexing him, and he had to move.  For a year, he had wandered, realizing every day the truth of Horace's philosophy for those who travel, that a man cannot change his feelings with his climate, until finally he had found himself, as every wanderer does, at Charing Cross.  At this point, he had tried to rally. Such running away, he told himself, was futile. He would stand still and fight the fever in him.  He had been fighting it now for a matter of two weeks, and already he was contemplating retreat. A man at luncheon had been talking about Japan--  Watching the crowd, Jimmy had found his attention attracted chiefly by a party of three, a few tables away. The party consisted of a girl, rather pretty, a lady of middle age and stately demeanor, plainly her mother, and a light-haired, weedy young man in the twenties. It had been the almost incessant prattle of this youth and the peculiarly high-pitched, gurgling laugh which shot from him at short intervals that had drawn Jimmy's notice upon them. And it was the curious cessation of both prattle and laugh that now made him look again in their direction.  The young man faced Jimmy; and Jimmy, looking at him, could see that all was not well with him. He was pale. He talked at random. A slight perspiration was noticeable on his forehead.  Jimmy caught his eye. There was a hunted look in it.  Given the time and the place, there were only two things that could have caused this look. Either the light-haired young man had seen a ghost, or he had suddenly realized that he had not enough money to pay the check.  Jimmy's heart went out to the sufferer. He took a card from his case, scribbled the words, \"Can I help?\" on it, and gave it to a waiter to take to the young man, who was now in a state bordering on collapse.  The next moment, the light-haired one was at his table, talking in a feverish whisper.  \"I say,\" he said, \"it's frightfully good of you, old chap! It's frightfully awkward. I've come out with too little money. I hardly like to--you've never seen me before--\"  \"Don't rub in my misfortunes,\" pleaded Jimmy. \"It wasn't my fault.\"  He placed a five-pound note on the table.  \"Say when,\" he said, producing another.  \"I say, thanks fearfully,\" the young man said. \"I don't know "]]]
