Mr. Quaver led, and the choir followed like sheep, all in their own way and fashion.  The people had listened to this style of music till they were tired of it. They wanted a change, and decided to engage Mr. Rhythm, a nice young man, to teach a singing-school for the young folks. \"We have a hundred boys and girls here in the village, who ought to learn to sing, so that they can sit in the singing-seats, and praise God,\" said Judge Adams.  But Mr. Quaver opposed the project. \"The young folks want a frolic, sir,\" he said; \"yes, sir, a frolic, a high time. Rhythm will be teaching them newfangled notions. You know, Judge, that I hate flummididdles; I go for the good old things, sir. The old tunes which have stood the wear and tear of time, and the good old style of singing, sir.\"  Mr. Quaver did not say all he thought, for he could see that, if the singing-school was kept, he would be in danger of losing his position as chorister. But, notwithstanding his opposition, Mr. Rhythm was engaged to teach the school. Paul determined to attend. He loved music.  \"You haven't any coat fit to wear,\" said his mother. \"I have altered over your grandfather's pants and vest for you, but I cannot alter his coat. You will have to stay at home, I guess.\"  \"I can't do that, mother, for Mr. Rhythm is one of the best teachers that ever was, and I don't want to miss the chance. I'll wear grandpa's coat just as it is.\"  \"The school will laugh at you.\"  \"Well, let them laugh, I sha'n't stay at home for that. I guess I can stand it,\" said Paul, resolutely.  The evening fixed upon for the school to commence arrived. All the young folks in the town were there. Those who lived out of the village,--the farmers' sons and daughters,--came in red, yellow, and green wagons. The girls wore close-fitting hoods with pink linings, which they called \"kiss-me-if-ye-dares.\" Their cheeks were all aglow with the excitement of the occasion. When they saw Mr. Rhythm, how pleasant and smiling he was,--when they heard his voice, so sweet and melodious,--when they saw how spryly he walked, as if he meant to accomplish what he had undertaken,--they said to one another, \"How different he is from Mr. Quaver!\"  Paul was late on the first evening; for when he put on his grandfather's coat, his mother planned a long while to see if there was not some way by which she could make it look better. Once she took the shears and was going to cut off the tail, but Paul stopped her. \"I don't want it curtailed, mother.\"  \"It makes you look like a little old man, Paul; I wouldn't go.\"  \"If I had better clothes, I should wear them, mother; but as I haven't, I shall wear these. I hope to earn money enough some time to get a better coat; but grandpa wore this, and I am not ashamed to wear what he wore,\" he replied, more resolute than ever. Perhaps, if he could have seen how he looked, he would not have been quite so determined, for the sleeves hung like bags on his arms, and the tail almost touched the floor.  Mr. Rhythm had just rapped the scholars to their seats when Paul entered. There was a tittering, a giggle, then a roar of laughter. Mr. Rhythm looked round to see what was the matter, and smiled. For a moment Paul's courage failed him. It was not so easy to be laughed at as he had imagined. He was all but ready to turn about and leave the room. \"No I won't, I'll face it out,\" he said to himself, walking deliberately to a seat, and looking bravely round, as if asking, \"What are you laughing at?\"  There was something in his manner which instantly won Mr. Rhythm's respect, and which made him ashamed of himself for having laughed. \"Silence! No more laughing,\" he said; but, notwithstanding the command, there was a constant tittering among the girls. Mr. Rhythm began by saying, \"We will sing Old Hundred. I want you all to sing, whether you can sing right or not.\" He snapped his tuning-fork, and began. The school followed, each one singing,--putting in sharps, flats, naturals, notes, and rests, just as they pleased. \"Very well. Good volume of sound. Only I don't think Old Hundred ever was sung so before, or ever will be again,\" said the master, smiling.  Michael Murphy was confident that he sang gloriously, though he never varied his tone up or down. He was ciphering in fractions at school, and what most puzzled him were the figures set to the bass. He wondered if 6/4 was a vulgar fraction, and if so, he thought it would be better to express it as a mixed number, 1-1/2.  During the evening, Mr. Rhythm, noticing that Michael sang without any variation of tone, said, \"Now, Master Murphy, please sing _la_ with me\";--and Michael sang bravely, not frightened in the least.  \"Very well. Now please sing it a little higher.\"  \"_La_,\" sang Michael on the same pitch, but louder.  \"Not louder, but higher.\"  \"LA!\" responded Michael, still louder, but with the pitch unchanged.  There was tittering among the girls.  \"Not so, but thus,\"--and Mr. Rhythm gave an example, first low, then high. \"Now once more.\"  \"LA!\" bellowed Michael on the same pitch.  Daphne Dare giggled aloud, and the laughter, like a train of powder, ran through the girls' seats over to the boys' side of the house, where it exploded in a loud haw! haw! Michael laughed with the others, but he did not know what for.  Recess came. \"Halloo, Grandpa! How are you, Old Pensioner? Your coat puckers under the arms, and there is a wrinkle in the back,\" said Philip Funk to Paul. His sister Fanny pointed her finger at him; and Paul heard her whisper to one of the girls, \"Did you ever see such a monkey?\"  It nettled him, and so, losing his temper, he said to Philip, \"Mind your business.\"  \"Just hear Grandaddy Parker, the old gentleman in the bob-tailed coat,\" said Philip.  \"You are a puppy,\" said Paul. But he was vexed with himself for having said it. If he had held his tongue, and kept his temper, and braved the sneers of Philip in silence, he might have won a victory; for he remembered a Sunday-school lesson upon the text, \"He that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city.\" As it was, he had suffered a defeat, and went home that night disgusted with himself.  Pleasant were those singing-school evenings. Under Mr. Rhythm's instructions the young people made rapid progress. Then what fine times they had at recess, eating nuts, apples, and confectionery, picking out the love-rhymes from the sugar-cockles!                   \"I cannot tell the love                  I feel for you, my dove.\"  was Philip's gift to Azalia. Paul had no money to purchase sweet things at the store; his presents were nuts which he had gathered in the autumn. In the kindness of his heart he gave a double-handful to Philip's sister, Fanny; but she turned up her nose, and let them drop upon the floor.  Society in New Hope was mixed. Judge Adams, Colonel Dare, and Mr. Funk were rich men. Colonel Dare was said to be worth a hundred thousand dollars. No one knew what Mr. Funk was worth; but he had a store, and a distillery, which kept smoking day and night and Sunday, without cessation, grinding up corn, and distilling it into whiskey. There was always a great black smoke rising from the distillery-chimney. The fires were always roaring, and the great vats steaming. Colonel Dare made his money by buying and selling land, wool, corn, and cattle. Judge Adams was an able lawyer, known far and near as honest, upright, and learned. He had a large practice; but though the Judge and Colonel were so wealthy, and lived in fine houses, they did not feel that they were better than their neighbors, so that there was no aristocracy in the place, but the rich and the poor were alike respected and esteemed.  The New Year was at hand, and Daphne Dare was to give a party. She was Colonel Dare's only child,--a laughing, blue-eyed, sensible girl, who attended the village school, and was in the same class with Paul.  \"Whom shall I invite to my party, father?\" she asked.  \"Just whom you please, my dear,\" said the Colonel.  \"I don't know what to do about inviting Paul Parker. Fanny Funk says she don't want to associate with a fellow who is so poor that he wears his grandfather's old clothes,\" said Daphne.  \"Poverty is not a crime, my daughter. I was poor once,--poor as Paul is. Money is not virtue, my dear. It is a good thing to have; but persons are not necessarily bad because they are poor, neither are they good because they are rich,\" said the Colonel.  \"Should you invite him, father, if you were in my place?\"  \"I do not wish to say, my child, for I want you to decide the matter yourself.\"  \"Azalia says that she would invite him; but Fanny says that if I invite him, she shall not come.\"  \"Aha!\" The Colonel opened his eyes wide. \"Well, my dear, you are not to be influenced wholly by what Azalia says, and you are to pay no attention to what Fanny threatens. You make the party. You have a perfect right to invite whom you please; and if Fanny don't choose to come, she has the privilege of staying away. I think, however, that she will not be likely to stay at home even if you give Paul an invitation. Be guided by your own sense of right, my darling. That is the best guide.\"  \"I wish you'd give Paul a coat, father. You can afford to, can't you?\"  \"Yes; but he can't afford to receive it,\" Daphne looked at her father in amazement. \"He can't afford to receive such a gift from me, because it is better for him to fight the battle of life without any help from me or anybody else at present. A good man offered to help me when I was a poor boy; but I thanked him, and said, 'No, sir.' I had made up my mind to cut my own way, and I guess Paul has made up his mind to do the same thing,\" said the Colonel.  \"I shall invite him. I'll let Fanny know that I have a mind of my own,\" said Daphne, with determination in her voice.  Her father kissed her, but kept his thoughts to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22913"],["title","Winning His Way (#6)"],["body","lf. He appeared to be pleased, and Daphne thought that he approved her decision.  The day before New Year Paul received a neatly folded note, addressed to Mr. Paul Parker. How funny it looked! It was the first time in his life that he had seen \"Mr.\" prefixed to his name. He opened it, and read that Miss Daphne Dare would receive her friends on New Year's eve at seven o'clock. A great many thoughts passed through his mind. How could he go and wear his grandfather's coat? At school he was on equal footing with all; but to be one of a party in a richly furnished parlor, where Philip, Fanny, and Azalia, and other boys and girls whose fathers had money, could turn their backs on him and snub him, was very different. It was very kind in Daphne to invite him, and ought he not to accept her invitation? Would she not think it a slight if he did not go? What excuse could he offer if he stayed away? None, except that he had no nice clothes. But she knew that, yet she had invited him. She was a true-hearted girl, and would not have asked him if she had not wanted him. Thus he turned the matter over, and decided to go.  But when the time came, Paul was in no haste to be there. Two or three times his heart failed him, while on his way; but looking across the square, and seeing Colonel Dare's house all aglow,--lights in the parlors and chambers, he pushed on resolutely, determined to be manly, notwithstanding his poverty. He reached the house, rang the bell, and was welcomed by Daphne in the hall.  \"Good evening, Paul. You are very late. I was afraid you were not coming. All the others are here,\" she said, her face beaming with happiness, joy, and excitement. She was elegantly dressed, for she was her father's pet, and he bought everything for her which he thought would make her happy.  \"Better late than never, isn't it?\" said Paul, not knowing what else to say.  Although the party had been assembled nearly an hour, there had been no games. The girls were huddled in groups on one side of the room, and the boys on the other, all shy, timid, and waiting for somebody to break the ice. Azalia was playing the piano, while Philip stood by her side. He was dressed in a new suit of broadcloth, and wore an eye-glass. Fanny was present, though she had threatened not to attend if Paul was invited. She had changed her mind. She thought it would be better to attend and make the place too hot for Paul; she would get up such a laugh upon him that he would be glad to take his hat and sneak away, and never show himself in respectable society again. Philip was in the secret, and so were a dozen others who looked up to Philip and Fanny. Daphne entered the parlor, followed by Paul. There was a sudden tittering, snickering, and laughing. Paul stopped and bowed, then stood erect.  \"I declare, if there isn't old Grandaddy,\" said Philip, squinting through his eye-glass.  \"O my! how funny!\" said a girl from Fairview.  \"Ridiculous! It is a shame!\" said Fanny, turning up her nose.  \"Who is he?\" the Fairview girl asked.  \"A poor fellow who lives on charity,--so poor that he wears his grandfather's old clothes. We don't associate with him,\" was Fanny's reply.  Paul heard it. His cheek flushed, but he stood there, determined to brave it out. Azalia heard and saw it all. She stopped playing in the middle of a measure, rose from her seat with her cheeks all aflame, and walked towards Paul, extending her hand and welcoming him. \"I am glad you have come, Paul. We want you to wake us up. We have been half asleep,\" she said.  The laughter ceased instantly, for Azalia was queen among them. Beautiful in form and feature, her chestnut hair falling in luxuriant curls upon her shoulders, her dark hazel eyes flashing indignantly, her cheeks like blush-roses, every feature of her countenance lighted up by the excitement of the moment, her bearing subdued the conspiracy at once, hushing the derisive laughter, and compelling respect, not only for herself, but for Paul. It required an effort on his part to keep back the tears from his eyes, so grateful was he for her kindness.  \"Yes, Paul, we want you to be our general, and tell us what to do,\" said Daphne.  \"Very well, let us have Copenhagen to begin with,\" he said.  The ice was broken. Daphne brought in her mother's clothes-line, the chairs were taken from the room, and in five minutes the parlor was humming like a beehive.  \"I don't see what you can find to like in that disagreeable creature,\" said Philip to Azalia.  \"He is a good scholar, and kind to his mother, and you know how courageous he was when he killed that terrible dog,\" was her reply.  \"I think he is an impudent puppy. What right has he to thrust himself into good company, wearing his grandfather's old clothes?\" Philip responded, dangling his eye-glass and running his soft hand through his hair.  \"Paul is poor; but I never have heard anything against his character,\" said Azalia.  \"Poor folks ought to be kept out of good society,\" said Philip.  \"What do you say to that picture?\" said Azalia, directing his attention towards a magnificent picture of Franklin crowned with laurel by the ladies of the court of France, which hung on the wall. \"Benjamin Franklin was a poor boy, and dipped candles for a living; but he became a great man.\"  \"Dipped candles! Why, I never heard of that before,\" said Philip, looking at the engraving through his eye-glass.  \"I don't think it is any disgrace to Paul to be poor. I am glad that Daphne invited him,\" said Azalia, so resolutely that Philip remained silent. He was shallow-brained and ignorant, and thought it not best to hazard an exposure of his ignorance by pursuing the conversation.  After Copenhagen they had Fox and Geese, and Blind-man's-buff. They guessed riddles and conundrums, had magic writing, questions and answers, and made the parlor, the sitting-room, the spacious halls, and the wide stairway ring with their merry laughter. How pleasant the hours! Time flew on swiftest wings. They had a nice supper,--sandwiches, tongue, ham, cakes, custards, floating-islands, apples, and nuts. After supper they had stories, serious and laughable, about ghosts and witches, till the clock in the dining-room held up both of its hands and pointed to the figure twelve, as if in amazement at their late staying. \"Twelve o'clock! Why, how short the evening has been!\" said they, when they found how late it was. They had forgotten all about Paul's coat, for he had been the life of the party, suggesting something new when the games lagged. He was so gentlemanly, and laughed so heartily and pleasantly, and was so wide awake, and managed everything so well, that, notwithstanding the conspiracy to put him down, he had won the good will of all the party.  During the evening Colonel Dare and Mrs. Dare entered the room. The Colonel shook hands with Paul, and said, \"I am very happy to see you here to-night, Paul.\" It was spoken so heartily and pleasantly that Paul knew the Colonel meant it.  The young gentlemen were to wait upon the young ladies home. Their hearts went pit-a-pat. They thought over whom to ask and what to say. They walked nervously about the hall, pulling on their gloves, while the girls were putting on their cloaks and hoods up stairs. They also were in a fever of expectation and excitement, whispering mysteriously, their hearts going like trip-hammers.  Daphne stood by the door to bid her guests good night. \"I am very glad that you came to-night, Paul,\" she said, pressing his hand in gratitude, \"I don't know what we should have done without you.\"  \"I have passed a very pleasant evening,\" he replied.  Azalia came tripping down the stairs. \"Shall I see you home, Azalia?\" Paul asked.  \"Miss Adams, shall I have the delightful pleasure of being permitted to escort you to your residence?\" said Philip, with his most gallant air, at the same time pushing by Paul with a contemptuous look.  \"Thank you, Philip, but I have an escort,\" said Azalia, accepting Paul's arm.  The night was frosty and cold, though it was clear and pleasant. The full moon was high in the heavens, the air was still, and there were no sounds to break the peaceful silence, except the water dashing over the dam by the mill, the footsteps of the departing guests upon the frozen ground, and the echoing of their voices. Now that he was with Azalia alone, Paul wanted to tell her how grateful he was for all she had done for him; but he could only say, \"I thank you, Azalia, for your kindness to me to-night.\"  \"O, don't mention it, Paul; I am glad if I have helped you. Good night.\"  How light-hearted he was! He went home, and climbed the creaking stairway, to his chamber. The moon looked in upon him, and smiled. He could not sleep, so happy was he. How sweet those parting words! The water babbled them to the rocks, and beyond the river in the grand old forest, where the breezes were blowing, there was a pleasant murmuring of voices, as if the elms and oaks were having a party, and all were saying, \"We are glad if we have helped you.\"     CHAPTER IV.  MUSIC AND PAINTING.   Philip went home alone from the party, out of sorts with himself, angry with Azalia, and boiling over with wrath toward Paul. He set his teeth together, and clenched his fist. He would like to blacken Paul's eyes and flatten his nose. The words of Azalia--\"I know nothing against Paul's character\"--rang in his ears and vexed him. He thought upon them till his steps, falling upon the frozen ground, seemed to say, \"Character!--character!--character!\" as if Paul had something which he had not.  \"So because he has character, and I haven't, you give me the mitten, do you, Miss Azalia?\" he said, as if he was addressing Azalia.  He knew that Paul had a good name. He was the best singer in the singing-school, and Mr. Rhythm often called upon him to sing in a duet with Azalia or Daphne. Sometimes he sang a solo so well, that the spectators whispered to one another, that, if Paul went on as he had begun, he would be"]]]
