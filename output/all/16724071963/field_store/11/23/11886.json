One of the best of the first class was selected--the _Water Lily_, A1 on Lloyd's--and in it Annie, with her nurse, was sent to sea for the benefit of her health.  The parting was a somewhat important event in Mr Webster's life, for it convinced him, to his own surprise, that his power to love a human being was not yet utterly gone!  Annie's arms clasped convulsively round his neck at the moment of parting--her sobbing \"Good-bye, darling papa,\" had stirred depths which had lain unmoved almost from the days of early manhood.  But the memory of this passed away as soon as he turned again to gaze upon the loved countenance of his yellow mistress.  The voyage did Annie much good.  The short residence in Demerara, while the vessel was discharging cargo and reloading, wrought wonders, and a letter, forwarded by a ship that sailed a short time after their arrival in \"foreign parts,\" told Mr Webster that he might expect to see his daughter home again, sound and well, in a month or two at the farthest.  But, to return from this digression to the abode of Mr Webster's soul:--  Having looked at the portrait of his late wife's father for a moment and smiled, he glanced at the letter in his hand and frowned.  Not because he was displeased, but because the writing was cramped and difficult to read.  However, the merchant was accustomed to receive such letters from seafaring men on many subjects of interest; he therefore broke the seal and set himself patiently to decipher it.  Immediately his countenance became ghastly pale, then it flushed up and became pale again, while he coughed and gasped once or twice, and started up and sat down abruptly. In fact Mr Webster exhibited all the signs of having received a severe shock, and an eye-witness might have safely concluded that he had just read the news of some great mercantile loss.  So it was in one sense-- but that was not the ordinary sense.  The letter in question was in the handwriting of a fussy officious \"bumble\" friend of the wealthy man, who dwelt in the town of Covelly. It ran as follows:    \"My dear Sir,--I write in great haste, and in much perturbation,   having just heard from my servant of the wreck of your ship, the   _Water Lily_, in Covelly Bay.  She does not seem to be quite sure,   however, of the name, and says that the only man who has been rescued   is scarcely able to speak, so that I do sincerely hope my domestic,   who is a stupid old woman, may turn out to be mistaken.  I am on the   point of hasting down to the shore to ascertain the truth for myself,   but am obliged to write to you this brief and unsatisfactory account   of what I have heard, in order to save the post, which is just being   closed.  You shall hear from me again, of course, by the next mail.--I   remain, my dear sir, in much anxiety, your most obedient humble   servant,    \"JOSEPH DOWLER.\"  It chanced that at the moment the above letter was handed to the postmaster, and while the wax was being melted before the final sealing of the post-bag, a sailor lad, drenched to the skin and panting vehemently, dashed into the office.  \"Stop! stop!\" he cried, \"a letter--about the wreck--the _Water Lily_--to the owners--not too late, I hope?\"  \"No, no, just in time.  Here, in with it.  There, all right.  Now, Jim, off with 'ee.\"  The postman jumped on his vehicle, the whip cracked, and in another minute the Royal Mail was gone.  Thus it came to pass that two epistles reached Mr Webster that morning from Covelly.  But in the extreme agitation of his spirit, he did not observe the other letter which lay among the usual morning mass that still awaited examination.  After reading the letter twice, and turning it over with trembling hands, as if he wished there were more in it, he pronounced a deep malediction on his \"humble\" friend, and rang the bell for his confidential clerk, who was an unusually meek, mild, and middle-aged little man, with a bald head, a deprecatory expression of countenance, and a pen behind his ear.  \"Mr Grinder,\" said Mr Webster, putting strong constraint on himself, and pretending to be quite composed, \"a letter from Covelly informs me that it is feared the _Water Lily_ has been wrecked in--\"  \"The _Water Lily_, sir!\" exclaimed Grinder, starting as if he had received an electric shock.  \"I spoke audibly, did I not?\" said Mr Webster, turning with a sharp look on his confidential clerk.  \"Ye-es, sir, but, I--Miss An--\" The poor man could get no further, being of a timid, nervous temperament, and Mr Webster, paying no attention to his remark, was going on to say that he intended to go by the mail to Covelly without delay to ascertain the truth for himself, when he was interrupted by the confidential clerk who exclaimed in a burst of agitation--  \"There were _two_ letters, sir, from Covelly this morning--did you read--\"  He stopped, for already his employer had sought for, found, and torn open the second epistle, which was written in a fair, legible hand.  It ran thus:--    \"SIR,--My father, Captain Boyns, directs me to inform you that your   daughter, Miss Annie, has been saved from the wreck of your brig, the   _Water Lily_, which ran aground here this afternoon, and has become a   total wreck.  Your daughter's nurse and the crew have also been   rescued by our new lifeboat, which is a noble craft, and, with God's   blessing, will yet do good service on this coast.  I have pleasure in   adding, from myself, that it was my father who rescued your child.   She fell into the sea when being passed from the wreck into the boat,   and sank, but my father dived and brought her up in safety.    \"Much of the brig's cargo has been lost, I regret to say, but a good   deal of it has been washed ashore and saved in a damaged state.  The   captain says that defective compasses were the cause of the disaster.   There is not time to give you a more particular account, as it is   close upon post-time.  Miss Annie sends you her kindest love, and bids   me say she is none the worse of what she has passed through.--I am,   sir, your obedient servant,    \"HARRY BOYNS.\"  \"Thank God!\" exclaimed Mr Webster fervently.  \"Why, what are you staring at, Mr Grinder?\" he added, on observing that his confidential servant was gazing at him with an expression of considerable surprise.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" stammered the unfortunate man, \"I--I--in fact--you have so often told me that you did not believe in God that I fancied-- I--wondered--\"  \"Really, Mr Grinder, I must beg of you to confine your remarks in future entirely to matters of business.  The so-called religious observations which you sometimes venture to make in my presence are extremely distasteful, I assure you.  In explanation of what I said, however, I may tell you that this letter informs me of my daughter's safety, and I merely used the expression of satisfaction that is usual on such occasions.  The phrase, as it is generally understood (except by weak men), commits me to nothing more.  But enough of this.  I find that the _Water Lily_ has indeed been lost.  It was fully insured, I believe?\"  \"Yes, sir, it was.\"  \"Very well; report the matter without delay.  I will go to Covelly to-night, and shall probably be back to-morrow.\"  Saying this, Mr Webster left the office, and, on the evening of that day, found himself seated in Captain Boyns's parlour, with little Annie on his knee.  Her pretty head was on his shoulder, her fair curls straggled over his chest, and her round little arms tightly encircled his large body as far as they could reach, while she sobbed on his bosom and kissed him by turns.  This was quite a new experience in the life of the gold-lover.  He had declined to submit to familiar caresses in former years, but on such an occasion as the present, he felt that common propriety demanded the sacrifice of himself to some extent.  He therefore allowed Annie to kiss him, and found the operation--performed as she did it--much more bearable than he had anticipated; and when Annie exclaimed with a burst of enthusiasm, \"Oh, dear, dear papa, I did feel such a dreadful longing for you when the waves were roaring round us!\" and gave him another squeeze, he felt that the market price of the bundle of goods on his knee was rising rapidly.  \"Did you think you were going to be drowned, dear?\" said Mr Webster with the air of a man who does not know very well what to say.  \"I'm not sure what I thought,\" replied Annie smiling through her tears. \"Oh, I was so frightened!  You can't think, papa, how very dreadful it is to see the water boiling all round, and sometimes over you; and such awful thumping of the ship, and then the masts breaking; but what I feared most was to see the faces of the sailors, they were so white, and they looked as if they were afraid.  Are men ever afraid, papa?\"  \"Sometimes, Annie; but a white face is not always the sign of fear--that may be caused by anxiety.  Did any of them refuse to obey orders?\"  \"No; they were very obedient.\"  \"Did any of them get into the lifeboat before you and nurse!\"  \"Oh, no; they all refused to move till we were put into it, and some of them ran to help us, and were very very kind?\"  \"Then you may be quite sure they were not afraid, however pale their faces were; but what of yourself, Annie--were you afraid?\"  \"Oh, dreadfully, and so was poor nurse; but once or twice I thought of the text that--that--you know who was so fond of,--`Call upon me in the time of trouble and I will deliver thee,' so I prayed and felt a little better.  Then the lifeboat came, and, oh! how my heart did jump, for it seemed just like an answer to my prayer.  I never felt any more fear after that, except when I fell into the sea; but even then I was not so frightened as I had been, for I felt somehow that I was sure to be saved, and I was right, you see, for dear Captain Boyns dived for me.  I love Captain Boyns!\" cried Annie, and here again she kissed her father and held him so tight"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23385"],["title","Saved (#3)"],["body","he felt quite angry with Mrs Niven, who entered at the moment, and said, apologetically--  \"Oh! la, sir, I didn't know as Miss Annie was with you.  I only came to say that everythink is ready, sir, for going 'ome.\"  \"We don't intend to go home,\" said Mr Webster; \"at least not for a day or two.  I find that Captain Boyns can let us stay here while I look after the wreck, so you can go and arrange with Mrs Boyns.\"  During the few days that Mr Webster remained at Coral Cottage (Captain Boyns's residence), Mrs Niven found, in the quiet, sympathetic Mrs Boyns, if not a congenial friend, at least a kind and sociable hostess, and Annie found, in Harry Boyns, a delightful companion, who never wearied of taking her to the cliffs, the shore, and all the romantic places of the neighbourhood, while Mr Webster found the captain to be most serviceable in connection with the wreck.  One result of all this was that Mr Webster offered Captain Boyns the command of one of his largest vessels, an offer which was gladly accepted, for the captain had, at that time, been thrown out of employment by the failure of a firm, in the service of which he had spent the greater part of his nautical career.  Another result was, that Mr Webster, at Annie's earnest solicitation, agreed to make Covelly his summer quarters next year, instead of Ramsgate, and Mrs Boyns agreed to lodge the family in Coral Cottage.  This having been all settled, Mr Webster asked Captain Boyns, on the morning of his departure for Liverpool, if he could do anything more for him, for he felt that to him his daughter owed her life, and he was anxious to serve him.  \"If you could give my son Harry something to do, sir,\" said Boyns, \"you would oblige me very much.  Harry is a smart fellow and a good seaman. He has been a short time in the coasting trade; perhaps--\"  \"Well, yes, I'll see to that,\" interrupted Mr Webster.  \"You shall hear from me again as to it.\"  Now the fact is that Mr Webster did not feel attracted by young Boyns, and he would willingly have had nothing to do with him, but being unable to refuse the request after having invited it, he ultimately gave him a situation in one of his coasting vessels which plied between London and Aberdeen.  About a year after that, Captain Boyns sailed in the _Warrior_, a large new ship, for the Sandwich Islands and the Chinese seas.  True to his promise, Mr Webster spent the following summer with Annie and Mrs Boyns at Covelly, and young Boyns so managed matters that he got his captain to send him down to Covelly to talk with his employer on business.  Of course, being there, it was natural that he should ask and obtain leave to spend a few days with his mother; and, of course, it was quite as natural that, without either asking or obtaining leave, he should spend the whole of these days in roaming about the shore and among the cliffs with Annie Webster.  It would be absurd to say that these two fell in love, seeing that one was only seven and the other fifteen; but there can be no doubt they entertained some sort of regard for each other, of a very powerful nature.  The young sailor was wildly enthusiastic, well educated, manly, and good-looking--little wonder that Annie liked him.  The child was winning in her ways, simple, yet laughter-loving, and very earnest--less wonderful that Harry liked _her_!  Another year fled, and again the Websters visited Covelly, and again Harry spent a few days with his mother; and although Mr Webster did not get the length of liking the youth, he at last came to the condition of not disliking him.  Year followed year, and still, each summer, Annie pressed her father to return to the old place, and he agreed, chiefly because it mattered little to him where he went.  He regarded the summer trip in the light of a penance to be paid for the sin of being a member of society and the head of a household, and placed every minute so wasted to the debit of the profit and loss account in the mental ledger of his life's affairs, for it must not be supposed that Mr Webster's character was changed by the events which followed the rescue of his child from the sea.  True, he had been surprised out of his habitual hardness for a short time, but he soon relapsed, if not quite back to the old position, at least so near to it that the difference was not appreciable.  As time ran on, men begun to look for the return of the _Warrior_, but that vessel did not make her appearance.  Then they began to shake their heads and to grow prophetic, while those who were most deeply interested in the human beings who manned her became uneasy.  \"Don't fret over it,\" said Harry one day to his mother, in a kind, earnest tone; \"you may depend upon it father will turn up yet and surprise us.  He never lost a ship in his life, and he has sailed in worse ones than the _Warrior_ by a long way.\"  \"It may be so,\" replied Mrs Boyns, sadly; \"but it is a long, long time since he went away.  God's will be done.  Whether He gives or takes away, I shall try to bless His name.\"  At last Harry gave over attempting to comfort his mother, for he began to fear that his father's ship was destined to be placed on the dark, dreary list of those of which it is sometimes said, with terrible brevity, in the newspapers, \"She sailed from port on such and such a day, and has not since been heard of.\"  In course of time Harry made one or two trips to the East Indies as first mate of one of Mr Webster's vessels, and ultimately obtained the command of one.  At last a day came when there appeared in a Welsh newspaper a paragraph, which ran thus:--\"A Message from the Sea--A bottle, corked and sealed, was found by a woman on the beach, above Conway, North Wales.  Inside was a letter containing the following:--    \"`Latitude 44, longitude 15, off Tierra del Fuego.  If this should   ever reach the shores of England, it will announce to friends at home   the sad fate of the ship _Warrior_, which sailed from Liverpool on   13th February 18 hundred and something, bound for China.  We have been   boarded by pirates: we have been all locked into the cabin, with the   assurance that we shall be made to walk the plank in half an hour.   Our last act is to put this in a bottle and drop it overboard.   Farewell, for this world, my beloved wife and son.'    \"`DANIEL BOYNS, Captain.'\"  This letter was forwarded to the owner, and by him was sent to poor Mrs Boyns.  Alas! how many sailors' wives, in our sea-girt isle, have received similar \"messages from the sea,\" and lived under the dark cloud of never-ending suspense--hoping against hope that the dear lost ones might yet return!    CHAPTER THREE.  SHOWS WHAT SOME MEN WILL DO AND DARE FOR MONEY, AND WHAT SOMETIMES COMES OF IT.  We must now beg the reader's permission to allow a few more years to elapse.  Eight have come and gone since the dark day when poor Mrs Boyns received that message from the sea, which cast a permanent cloud over her life.  Annie Webster has become a beautiful woman, and Harry Boyns a bronzed stalwart man.  But things have changed with time.  These two seldom meet now, in consequence of the frequent absence of the latter on long voyages, and when they do meet, there is not the free, frank intercourse that there used to be.  In fact, Mr Webster had long ago begun to suspect that his daughter's regard for the handsome young sailor was of a nature that bade fair to interfere with his purposed mercantile transactions in reference to her, so he wisely sent him off on voyages of considerable length, hoping that he might chance to meet with the same fate as his father, and wound up by placing him in command of one of his largest and most unseaworthy East Indiamen, in the full expectation that both captain and vessel would go to the bottom together, and thus enable him, at one stroke, to make a good round sum out of the insurance offices, and get rid of a troublesome servant!  Gloating over these and kindred subjects, Mr Webster sat one morning in his office mending a pen, and smiling in a sardonic fashion to the portrait of his deceased wife's father, when a tap came to the door, and Harry Boyns entered.  \"I have come, sir,\" he said, \"to tell you that the repairs done to the _Swordfish_ are not by any means sufficient.  There are at least--\"  \"Please do not waste time, Captain Boyns, by entering upon details,\" said Mr Webster, interrupting him with a bland smile: \"I am really quite ignorant of the technicalities of shipbuilding.  If you will state the matter to Mr Cooper, whom I employ expressly for--\"  \"But, sir,\" interrupted Harry, with some warmth, \"I _have_ spoken to Mr Cooper, and he says the repairs are quite sufficient.\"  \"Well, then, I suppose they are so.\"  \"I assure you, sir,\" rejoined Harry, \"they are not; and as the lives of passengers as well as men depend upon the vessel being in a seaworthy condition, I do trust that you will have her examined by some one more competent to judge than Mr Cooper.\"  \"I have no doubt of Mr Cooper's competence,\" returned Mr Webster; \"but I will order a further examination, as you seem so anxious about it. Meanwhile I hope that the ship is being got ready for sea as quickly as possible.\"  \"There shall be no delay on my part, sir,\" said Harry, rising; \"the ship has been removed from the Birkenhead Docks, in which you are aware she has lain for the last eight months, and is now lying in the Brunswick Dock, taking in cargo.  But I think it a very serious matter, which demands looking into, the fact that she had no sooner grounded in the dock, than she sprang a leak which instantly let twenty-eight inches of water into her, and twice, subsequently, as much as forty inches have been sounded.  Yet no repairs worthy of the name have been made.  All that has been done is the pumping of her out daily by the stevedore's men when their stowing work is finished.\"  \"Has the agent for the underwriters visited her?\" inquired Mr Webster.  \"He has, sir, but he seems to be of "]]]
