Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________ This is a truly delightful book by this prolific author.  I know of no other of his books that leaves so many images in the mind, so fresh after many a year.  The scene starts with a young man cycling on his penny-farthing towards London.  On the way he has an accident, knocking down an elderly lady, but fleeing the scene when he sees a policeman coming.  But when he gets home he finds a telegram informing him that his friends will be departing very soon in a yacht, to visit the islands on the North-West of Britain, so he joins them.  Unfortunately there is a fog and the yacht is damaged but all the young men and their crew manage to get ashore, finding themselves in the neighbourhood of a large house, the residence of a gentleman and his family.  They are invited to stay there as his guests, and it is at this point that the adventures begin, involving fishing, shooting, bird-watching, sailing and so forth.  There is a charming young lady also staying in the house, and deploying her hobby of painting.  Our hero falls in love with her, but is very much taken aback when she is joined by her mother, who turns out to be none other than the elderly lady he had knocked down back in London.  Even more disastrous was the fire that destroyed the house.  This is a brilliant book, and you will love it.  As a footnote you may be surprised that one of the children is called Junkie.  This certainly does not mean that same as it does today: instead it is a nickname given to a favourite boy-child, and you will find several examples of this in Ballantyne's books.  ________________________________________________________________________ THE EAGLE CLIFF, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  BEGINS THE TALE--NATURALLY.  From the earliest records of history we learn that man has ever been envious of the birds, and of all other winged creatures.  He has longed and striven to fly.  He has also signally failed to do so.  We say \"failed\" advisedly, because his various attempts in that direction have usually resulted in disappointment and broken bones.  As to balloons, we do not admit that they fly any more than do ships; balloons merely float and glide, when not otherwise engaged in tumbling, collapsing, and bursting.  This being so, we draw attention to the fact that the nearest approach we have yet made to the sensation of flying is that achieved by rushing down a long, smooth, steep hill-road on a well-oiled and perfect ball-bearings bicycle!  Skating cannot compare with this, for that requires exertion; bicycling down hill requires none.  Hunting cannot, no matter how splendid the mount, for that implies a certain element of bumping, which, however pleasant in itself, is not suggestive of the smooth swift act of flying.  We introduce this subject merely because thoughts somewhat similar to those which we have so inadequately expressed were burning in the brain of a handsome and joyful young man one summer morning not long ago, as, with legs over the handles, he flashed--if he did not actually fly--down one of our Middlesex hills on his way to London.  Urgent haste was in every look and motion of that young man's fine eyes and lithe body.  He would have bought wings at any price had that been possible; but, none being yet in the market, he made the most of his wheel--a fifty-eight inch one, by the way, for the young man's legs were long, as well as strong.  Arrived at the bottom of the hill the hilarious youth put his feet to the treadles, and drove the machine vigorously up the opposite slope. It was steep, but he was powerful.  He breathed hard, no doubt, but he never flagged until he gained the next summit.  A shout burst from his lips as he rolled along the level top, for there, about ten miles off, lay the great city, glittering in the sunshine, and with only an amber-tinted canopy of its usual smoke above it.  Among the tall elms and in the flowering hedgerows between which he swept, innumerable birds warbled or twittered their astonishment that he could fly with such heedless rapidity through that beautiful country, and make for the dismal town in such magnificent weather.  One aspiring lark overhead seemed to repeat, with persistent intensity, its trill of self gratulation that it had not been born a man.  Even the cattle appeared to regard the youth as a sort of ornithological curiosity, for the sentiment, \"Well, you are a goose!\" was clearly written on their mild faces as he flew past them.  Over the hill-top he went--twelve miles an hour at the least--until he reached the slope on the other side; then down he rushed again, driving at the first part of the descent like an insane steam-engine, till the pace must have increased to twenty miles, at which point, the whirl of the wheel becoming too rapid, he was obliged once more to rest his legs on the handles, and take to repose, contemplation, and wiping his heated brow--equivalent this, we might say, to the floating descent of the sea-mew.  Of course the period of rest was of brief duration, for, although the hill was a long slope, with many a glimpse of loveliness between the trees, the time occupied in its flight was short, and, at the bottom a rustic bridge, with an old inn and a thatched hamlet, with an awkwardly sharp turn in the road beyond it, called for wary and intelligent guidance of this lightning express.  Swiftly but safely to the foot of the hill went John Barret (that was the youth's name), at ever-increasing speed, and without check; for no one seemed to be moving about in the quiet hamlet, and the old English inn had apparently fallen asleep.  A delicious undulating swoop at the bottom indicates the crossing of the bridge.  A flash, and the inn is in rear.  The hamlet displays no sign of life, nevertheless Barret is cautious.  He lays a finger on the brake and touches the bell.  He is half-way through the hamlet and all goes well; still no sign of life except--yes, this so-called proof of every rule is always forthcoming, except that there is the sudden appearance of one stately cock.  This is followed immediately by its sudden and unstately disappearance.  A kitten also emerges from somewhere, glares, arches, fuffs, becomes indescribable, and--is not!  Two or three children turn up and gape, but do not recover in time to insult, or to increase the dangers of the awkward turn in the road which is now at hand.  Barret looks thoughtful.  Must the pace be checked here?  The road is open and visible.  It is bordered by grass banks and ditches on either side.  He rushes close to the left bank and, careering gracefully to the right like an Algerine felucca in a white squall, dares the laws of gravitation and centrifugal force to the utmost limitation, and describes a magnificent segment of a great circle.  Almost before you can wink he is straight again, and pegging along with irresistible pertinacity.  Just beyond the hamlet a suburban lady is encountered, with clasped hands and beseeching eyes, for a loose hairy bundle, animated by the spirit of a dog, stands in the middle of the road, bidding defiance to the entire universe!  The hairy bundle loses its head all at once, likewise its heart: it has not spirit left even to get out of the way. A momentary lean of the bicycle first to the left and then to the right describes what artists call \"the line of beauty,\" in a bight of which the bundle remains behind, crushed in spirit, but unhurt in body.  At the bottom of the next hill a small roadside inn greets our cyclist. That which cocks, kittens, dangers, and dogs could not effect, the inn accomplishes.  He \"slows.\"  In front of the door he describes an airy circlet, dismounting while yet in motion, leans the lightning express against the wall, and enters.  What! does that vigorous, handsome, powerful fellow, in the flush of early manhood, drink?  Ay, truly he does.  \"Glass of bitter, sir?\" asks the exuberant landlord.  \"Ginger,\" says the young man, pointing significantly to a bit of blue ribbon in his button-hole.  \"Come far to-day, sir?\" asks the host, as he pours out the liquid.  \"Fifty miles--rather more,\" says Barret, setting down the glass.  \"Fine weather, sir, for bicycling,\" says the landlord, sweeping in the coppers.  \"Very; good-day.\"  Before that cheery \"Good-day\" had ceased to affect the publican's brain Barret was again spinning along the road to London.  It was the road on which the mail coaches of former days used to whirl, to the merry music of bugle, wheel, and whip, along which so many men and women had plodded in days gone by, in search of fame and fortune and happiness: some, to find these in a greater or less degree, with much of the tinsel rubbed off, others, to find none of them, but instead thereof, wreck and ruin in the mighty human whirlpool; and not a few to discover the fact that happiness does not depend either on fortune or fame, but on spiritual harmony with God in Jesus Christ.  Pedestrians there still were on that road, bound for the same goal, and, doubtless, with similar aims; but mail and other coaches had been driven from the scene.  Barret had the broad road pretty much to himself.  Quickly he ran into the suburban districts, and here his urgent haste had to be restrained a little.  \"What if I am too late!\" he thought, and almost involuntarily put on a spurt.  Soon he entered the crowded thoroughfares, and was compelled to curb both steed and spirit.  Passing through one of the less-frequented streets in the neighbourhood of Finchley Road, he ventured to give the rein to his willing charger.  But here Fortune ceased to smile--and Fortune was to be commended for her severity.  Barret, although kind, courteous, manly, sensitive, and reasonably careful, was not just what he ought to have been.  Although a hero, he was not perfect.  He committed the unpardonable sin of turning a street corner sharply!  A thin little old "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23373"],["title","The Eagle Cliff (#1)"],["body","crossed the road at the same identical moment, slowly.  They met!  Who can describe that meeting? Not the writer, for he did not see it; more's the pity!  Very few people saw it, for it was a quiet corner.  The parties concerned cannot be said to have seen, though they felt it.  Both went down.  It was awful, really, to see a feeble old lady struggling with an athlete and a bicycle!  Two little street boys, and a ragged girl appeared as if by magic.  They always do!  \"Oh!  I say!  Ain't he bin and squashed 'er?\"  Such was the remark of one of the boys.  \"Pancakes is plump to 'er,\" was the observation of the other.  The ragged girl said nothing, but looked unspeakable things.  Burning with shame, trembling with anxiety, covered with dust and considerably bruised, Barret sprang up, left his fallen steed, and, raising the little old lady with great tenderness in his arms, sat her on the pavement with her back against the railings, while he poured out abject apologies and earnest inquiries.  Strange to say the old lady was not hurt in the least--only a good deal shaken and very indignant.  Stranger still, a policeman suddenly appeared in the distance.  At the same time a sweep, a postman, and a servant girl joined the group.  Young Barret, as we have said, was sensitive.  To become the object and centre of a crowd in such circumstances was overwhelming.  A climax was put to his confusion, when one of the street arabs, observing the policeman, suddenly exclaimed:--  \"Oh!  I say, 'ere's a bobby!  What a lark.  Won't you be 'ad up before the beaks?  It'll be a case o' murder.\"  \"No, it won't,\" retorted the other boy; \"it'll be a case o' manslaughter an' attempted suicide jined.\"  Barret started up, allowing the servant maid to take his place, and saw the approaching constable.  Visions of detention, publicity, trial, conviction, condemnation, swam before him.  \"A reg'lar Krismas panty-mime for nuffin'!\" remarked the ragged girl, breaking silence for the first time.  Scarcely knowing what he did, Barret leaped towards his bicycle, set it up, vaulted into the saddle, as he well knew how, and was safely out of sight in a few seconds.  Yet not altogether safe.  A guilty conscience pursued, overtook, and sat upon him.  Shame and confusion overwhelmed him.  Up to that date he had been honourable, upright, straightforward; as far as the world's estimation went, irreproachable.  Now, in his own estimation, he was mean, false, underhand, sneaking!  But he did not give way to despair.  He was a true hero, else we would not have had anything to write about him.  Suddenly he slowed, frowned, compressed his lips, described a complete circle--in spite of a furniture van that came in his way--and deliberately went back to the spot where the accident had occurred; but there was no little lady to be seen.  She had been conveyed away, the policeman was gone, the little boys were gone, the ragged girl, sweep, postman, and servant maid--all were gone, \"like the baseless fabric of a vision,\" leaving only new faces and strangers behind to wonder what accident and thin old lady the excited youth was asking about--so evanescent are the incidents that occur; and so busily pre-occupied are the human torrents that rush in the streets of London!  The youth turned sadly from the spot and continued his journey at a slower pace.  As he went along, the thought that the old lady might have received internal injuries, and would die, pressed heavily upon him: Thus, he might actually be a murderer, at the best a man-slaughterer, without knowing it, and would carry in his bosom a dreadful secret, and a terrible uncertainty, to the end of his life!  Of course he could go to that great focus of police energy--Scotland Yard--and give himself up; but on second thoughts he did not quite see his way to that.  However, he would watch the daily papers closely. That evening, in a frame of mind very different from the mental condition, in which he had set out on his sixty miles' ride in the afternoon, John Barret presented himself to his friend and old schoolfellow, Bob Mabberly.  \"You're a good fellow, Barret; I knew you would come; but you look warm. Have you been running?\" asked Mabberly, opening the door of his lodging to his friend.  \"Come in: I have news for you.  Giles Jackman has agreed to go.  Isn't that a comfort? for, besides his rare and valuable sporting qualities, he is more than half a doctor, which will be important, you know, if any of us should get ill or come to grief.  Sit down and we'll talk it over.\"  Now, it was a telegram from Bob Mabberly which led John Barret to suddenly undertake a sixty miles' ride that day, and which was thus the indirect cause of the little old lady being run down.  The telegram ran as follows:--  \"Come instanter.  As you are.  Clothes unimportant.  Yacht engaged. Crew also.  Sail, without fail, Thursday.  Plenty more to say when we meet.\"  \"Now, you see, Bob, with your usual want of precision, or care, or some such quality--\"  \"Stop, Barret.  Do be more precise in the use of language.  How can the want of a thing be a _quality_?\"  \"You are right, Bob.  Let me say, then, that with your usual unprecision and carelessness you sent me a telegram, which could not reach me till late on Wednesday night, after all trains were gone, telling me that you sail, without fail, on Thursday, but leaving me to guess whether you meant Thursday morning or evening.\"  \"How stupid!  My dear fellow, I forgot that!\"  \"Just so.  Well to make sure of losing no time, instead of coming here by trains, which, as you know, are very awkward and slow in our neighbourhood, besides necessitating long waits and several changes, I just packed my portmanteau, gun, rods, etcetera, and gave directions to have them forwarded here by the first morning train, then took a few winks of sleep, and at the first glimmer of daylight mounted my wheel and set off across country as straight as country roads would permit of--and--here I am.\"  \"True, Barret, and in good time for tea too.  We don't sail till morning, for the tide does not serve till six o'clock, so that will give us plenty of time to put the finishing touches to our plans, allow your things to arrive, and permit of our making--or, rather, renewing--our acquaintance with Giles Jackman.  You remember him, don't you?\"  \"Yes, faintly.  He was a broad, sturdy, good-humoured, reckless, little boy when I last saw him at old Blatherby's school.\"  \"Just so.  Your portrait is correct.  I saw him last month, after a good many years' interval, and he is exactly what he was, but considerably exaggerated at every point.  He is not, indeed, a little, but a middle sized man now; as good-humoured as ever; much more reckless; sturdier and broader a great deal, with an amount of hair about his lip, chin, and head generally that would suffice to fit out three or four average men.  He has been in India--in the Woods and Forests Department, or something of that sort--and has killed tigers, elephants, and such-like by the hundred, they say; but I've met him only once or twice, and he don't speak much about his own doings.  He is home on sick-leave just now.\"  \"Sick-leave!  Will he be fit to go with us?\" asked Barret, doubtfully.  \"Fit!\" cried Mabberly.  \"Ay, much more fit than you are, strong and vigorous though you be, for the voyage home has not only cured him; it has added superabundant health.  Voyages always do to sick Anglo-Indians, don't you know?  However ill a man may be in India, all he has to do is to obtain leave of absence and get on board of a ship homeward bound, and straightway health, rushing in upon him like a river, sends him home more than cured.  So now our party is made up, yacht victualled, anchor tripped; and--`all's well that ends well.'\"  \"But all is not ended, Bob.  Things have only begun, and, as regards myself, they have begun disastrously,\" said Barret, who thereupon related the incident of the little old lady being run down.  \"My dear fellow,\" cried Mabberly, laughing, \"excuse me, don't imagine me indifferent to the sufferings of the poor old thing; but do you really suppose that one who was tough enough, after such a collision, to sit up at all, with or without the support of the railings, and give way to indignant abuse--\"  \"Not abuse, Bob, indignant looks and sentiments; she was too thorough a lady to think of abuse--\"  \"Well, well; call it what you please; but you may depend upon it that she is not much hurt, and you will hear nothing more about the matter.\"  \"That's it!  That's the very thing that I dread,\" returned Barret, anxiously.  \"To go through life with the possibility that I may be an uncondemned and unhung murderer is terrible to think of.  Then I can't get over the meanness of my running away so suddenly.  If any one had said I was capable of such conduct I should have laughed at him.  Yet have I lived to do it--contemptibly--in cold blood.\"  \"Contemptibly it may have been, but not in cold blood, for did you not say you were roused to a state of frenzied alarm at the sight of the bobby? and assuredly, although unhung as yet, you are not uncondemned, if self-condemnation counts for anything.  Come, don't take such a desponding view of the matter.  We shall see the whole affair in the morning papers before sailing, with a report of the old lady's name and condition--I mean condition of health--as well as your unmanly flight, without leaving your card; so you'll be able to start with an easy--Ha! a cab! yes, it's Jackman.  I know his manservant,\" said Mabberly, as he looked out at the window.  Another moment and a broad-chested man, of about five-and-twenty, with a bronzed face--as far as hair left it visible--a pair of merry blue eyes, and a hearty manner, was grasping his old schoolfellows by the hand, and endeavouring to trace the likeness in John Barret to the quiet little boy whom he used to help with his tasks many years before.  \"Man, who would have thought you could"]]]
