And such will be the method of a free society. A society founded on serfdom is in keeping with absolute monarchy; a society based on the wage system and the exploitation of the masses by the capitalists finds its political expression in parliamentarianism. But a free society, regaining possession of the common inheritance, must seek in free groups and free federations of groups, a new organization, in harmony with the new economic phase of history.  Every economic phase has a political phase corresponding to it, and it would be impossible to touch private property unless a new mode of political life be found at the same time.     CHAPTER IV  EXPROPRIATION   I  It is told of Rothschild that, seeing his fortune threatened by the Revolution of 1848, he hit upon the following stratagem: \"I am quite willing to admit,\" said he, \"that my fortune has been accumulated at the expense of others; but if it were divided to-morrow among the millions of Europe, the share of each would only amount to four shillings. Very well, then, I undertake to render to each his four shillings if he asks me for it.\"  Having given due publicity to his promise, our millionaire proceeded as usual to stroll quietly through the streets of Frankfort. Three or four passers-by asked for their four shillings, which he disbursed with a sardonic smile. His stratagem succeeded, and the family of the millionaire is still in possession of its wealth.  It is in much the same fashion that the shrewed heads among the middle classes reason when they say, \"Ah, Expropriation! I know what that means. You take all the overcoats and lay them in a heap, and every one is free to help himself and fight for the best.\"  But such jests are irrelevant as well as flippant. What we want is not a redistribution of overcoats, although it must be said that even in such a case, the shivering folk would see advantage in it. Nor do we want to divide up the wealth of the Rothschilds. What we do want is so to arrange things that every human being born into the world shall be ensured the opportunity, in the first instance of learning some useful occupation, and of becoming skilled in it; and next, that he shall be free to work at his trade without asking leave of master or owner, and without handing over to landlord or capitalist the lion's share of what he produces. As to the wealth held by the Rothschilds or the Vanderbilts, it will serve us to organize our system of communal production.  The day when the labourer may till the ground without paying away half of what he produces, the day when the machines necessary to prepare the soil for rich harvests are at the free disposal of the cultivators, the day when the worker in the factory produces for the community and not the monopolist--that day will see the workers clothed and fed, and there will be no more Rothschilds or other exploiters.  No one will then have to sell his working power for a wage that only represents a fraction of what he produces.  \"So far, so good,\" say our critics, \"but you will have Rothschilds coming in from the outside. How are you to prevent a person from amassing millions in China, and then settling amongst you? How are you going to prevent such a one from surrounding himself with lackeys and wage-slaves--from exploiting them and enriching himself at their expense?  \"You cannot bring about a revolution all over the world at the same time. Well, then--are you going to establish custom-houses on your frontiers to search all who enter your country and confiscate the money they bring with them?--Anarchist policemen firing on travellers would be a fine spectacle!\"  But at the root of this argument there is a great error. Those who propound it have never paused to inquire whence come the fortunes of the rich. A little thought would, however, suffice to show them that these fortunes have their beginnings in the poverty of the poor. When there are no longer any destitute, there will no longer be any rich to exploit them.  Let us glance for a moment at the Middle Ages, when great fortunes began to spring up.  A feudal baron seizes on a fertile valley. But as long as the fertile valley is empty of folk our baron is not rich. His land brings him in nothing; he might as well possess a property in the moon.  What does our baron do to enrich himself? He looks out for peasants--for poor peasants!  If every peasant-farmer had a piece of land, free from rent and taxes, if he had in addition the tools and the stock necessary for farm labour--Who would plough the lands of the baron? Everyone would look after his own. But there are thousands of destitute persons ruined by wars, or drought, or pestilence. They have neither horse nor plough. (Iron was very costly in the Middle Ages, and a draught-horse still more so.)  All these destitute creatures are trying to better their condition. One day they see on the road at the confines of our baron's estate a notice-board indicating by certain signs adapted to their comprehension that the labourer who is willing to settle on his estate will receive the tools and materials to build his cottage and sow his fields, and a portion of land rent free for a certain number of years. The number of years is represented by so many crosses on the sign-board, and the peasant understands the meaning of these crosses.  So the poor wretches come to settle on the baron's lands. They make roads, drain the marshes, build villages. In nine or ten years the baron begins to tax them. Five years later he increases the rent. Then he doubles it, and the peasant accepts these new conditions because he cannot find better ones elsewhere. Little by little, with the aid of laws made by the barons, the poverty of the peasant becomes the source of the landlord's wealth. And it is not only the lord of the manor who preys upon him. A whole host of usurers swoop down upon the villages, multiplying as the wretchedness of the peasants increases. That is how these things happened in the Middle Ages. And to-day is it not still the same thing? If there were free lands which the peasant could cultivate if he pleased, would he pay £50 to some \"shabble of a Duke\"[2] for condescending to sell him a scrap? Would he burden himself with a lease which absorbed a third of the produce? Would he--on the _métayer_ system--consent to give half of his harvest to the landowner?  But he has nothing. So he will accept any conditions, if only he can keep body and soul together, while he tills the soil and enriches the landlord.  So in the nineteenth century, just as in the Middle Ages, the poverty of the peasant is a source of wealth to the landed proprietor.   II  The landlord owes his riches to the poverty of the peasants, and the wealth of the capitalist comes from the same source.  Take the case of a citizen of the middle class, who somehow or other finds himself in possession of £20,000. He could, of course, spend his money at the rate of £2,000 a year, a mere bagatelle in these days of fantastic, senseless luxury. But then he would have nothing left at the end of ten years. So, being a \"practical person,\" he prefers to keep his fortune intact, and win for himself a snug little annual income as well.  This is very easy in our society, for the good reason that the towns and villages swarm with workers who have not the wherewithal to live for a month, or even a fortnight. So our worthy citizen starts a factory. The banks hasten to lend him another £20,000, especially if he has a reputation for \"business ability\"; and with this round sum he can command the labour of five hundred hands.  If all the men and women in the countryside had their daily bread assured, and their daily needs already satisfied, who would work for our capitalist at a wage of half a crown a day, while the commodities one produces in a day sell in the market for a crown or more?  Unhappily--we know it all too well--the poor quarters of our towns and the neighbouring villages are full of needy wretches, whose children clamour for bread. So, before the factory is well finished, the workers hasten to offer themselves. Where a hundred are required three hundred besiege the doors, and from the time his mill is started, the owner, if he only has average business capacities, will clear £40 a year out of each mill-hand he employs.  He is thus able to lay by a snug little fortune; and if he chooses a lucrative trade, and has \"business talents,\" he will soon increase his income by doubling the number of men he exploits.  So he becomes a personage of importance. He can afford to give dinners to other personages--to the local magnates, the civic, legal, and political dignitaries. With his money he can \"marry money\"; by and by he may pick and choose places for his children, and later on perhaps get something good from the Government--a contract for the army or for the police. His gold breeds gold; till at last a war, or even a rumour of war, or a speculation on the Stock Exchange, gives him his great opportunity.  Nine-tenths of the great fortunes made in the United States are (as Henry George has shown in his \"Social Problems\") the result of knavery on a large scale, assisted by the State. In Europe, nine-tenths of the fortunes made in our monarchies and republics have the same origin. There are not two ways of becoming a millionaire.  This is the secret of wealth: find the starving and destitute, pay them half a crown, and make them produce five shillings worth in the day, amass a fortune by these means, and then increase it by some lucky speculation, made with the help of the State.

The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles   2. The Tiger of San Pedro     1.  The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles    I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day towards the end of March in the year 1892.  Holmes had received a telegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply.  He made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message.  Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.  \"I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,\" said he.  \"How do you define the word 'grotesque'?\"  \"Strange--remarkable,\" I suggested.  He shook his head at my definition.  \"There is surely something more than that,\" said he; \"some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible.  If you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering public, you will recognize how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal.  Think of that little affair of the red-headed men.  That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery.  Or, again, there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.\"  \"Have you it there?\" I asked.  He read the telegram aloud.  \"Have just had most incredible and grotesque experience.  May I consult you?  \"Scott Eccles,   \"Post Office, Charing Cross.\"   \"Man or woman?\" I asked.  \"Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram. She would have come.\"  \"Will you see him?\"  \"My dear Watson, you know how bored I have been since we locked up Colonel Carruthers.  My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built.  Life is commonplace, the papers are sterile; audacity and romance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world.  Can you ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any new problem, however trivial it may prove?  But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.\"  A measured step was heard upon the stairs, and a moment later a stout, tall, gray-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into the room.  His life history was written in his heavy features and pompous manner.  From his spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to the last degree. But some amazing experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed, angry cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He plunged instantly into his business.  \"I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.  \"Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation.  It is most improper--most outrageous.  I must insist upon some explanation.\"  He swelled and puffed in his anger.  \"Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,\" said Holmes in a soothing voice. \"May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?\"  \"Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police, and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I could not leave it where it was.  Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy, but none the less, having heard your name--\"  \"Quite so.  But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?\"  Holmes glanced at his watch.  \"It is a quarter-past two,\" he said.  \"Your telegram was dispatched about one.  But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.\"  Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin.  \"You are right, Mr. Holmes.  I never gave a thought to my toilet. I was only too glad to get out of such a house.  But I have been running round making inquiries before I came to you.  I went to the house agents, you know, and they said that Mr. Garcia's rent was paid up all right and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.\"  \"Come, come, sir,\" said Holmes, laughing.  \"You are like my friend, Dr. Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost. Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence, exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of advice and assistance.\"  Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance.  \"I'm sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before.  But I will tell you the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I am sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.\"  But his narrative was nipped in the bud.  There was a bustle outside, and Mrs. Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and official-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer.  He shook hands with Holmes and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Constabulary.  \"We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our trail lay in this direction.\"  He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor.  \"Are you Mr. John Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?\"  \"I am.\"  \"We have been following you about all the morning.\"  \"You traced him through the telegram, no doubt,\" said Holmes.  \"Exactly, Mr. Holmes.  We picked up the scent at Charing Cross Post-Office and came on here.\"  \"But why do you follow me?  What do you want?\"  \"We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to the events which led up to the death last night of Mr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near Esher.\"  Our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour struck from his astonished face.  \"Dead?  Did you say he was dead?\"  \"Yes, sir, he is dead.\"  \"But how?  An accident?\"  \"Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.\"  \"Good God!  This is awful!  You don't mean--you don't mean that I am suspected?\"  \"A letter of yours was found in the dead man's pocket, and we know by it that you had planned to pass last night at his house.\"  \"So I did.\"  \"Oh, you did, did you?\"  Out came the official notebook.  \"Wait a bit, Gregson,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"All you desire is a plain statement, is it not?\"  \"And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used against him.\"  \"Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room.  I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience, and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted.\"  Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to his face.  With a dubious glance at the inspector's notebook, he plunged at once into his extraordinary statement.  \"I am a bachelor,\" said he, \"and being of a sociable turn I cultivate a large number of friends.  Among these are the family of a retired brewer called Melville, living at Abermarle Mansion, Kensington.  It was at his table that I met some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. He was, I understood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with the embassy.  He spoke perfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and as good-looking a man as ever I saw in my life.  \"In some way we struck up quite a friendship, this young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy to me from the first, and within two days of our meeting he came to see me at Lee.  One thing led to another, and it ended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott.  Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.  \"He had described his household to me before I went there.  He lived with a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all his needs.  This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping for him.  Then there was a wonderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had picked up in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner. I remember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in the heart of Surrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has proved a good deal queerer than I thought.  \"I drove to the place--about two miles on the south side of Esher.  The house was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs.  It was an old, tumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair.  When the trap pulled up on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man whom I knew so slightly.  He opened the door himself, however, and greeted me with a great show of cordiality.  I was handed over to the manservant, a melancholy, swarthy individual, who led the way, my bag in his hand, to my bedroom.  The whole place was depressing.  Our dinner was tete-a-tete, and though my host did his best to be entertaining, his thoughts seemed to continually wander, and he talked so vaguely and wildly that I could hardly understand him. He continually drummed his fingers on the table, gnawed his nails, and gave other signs of nervous impatience.  The dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked, and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us.  I can assure you that many times in the course of the evening I wished that I could invent some excuse which would take me back to Lee.  \"One thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the business that you two gentlemen are investigating.  I thought nothing of it at the time.  Near the end of dinner a note was handed in by"]]]
