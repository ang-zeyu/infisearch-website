One of the prospects that caught me for the service was the chance of seeing some of our foreign possessions.\"  \"It's what catches half the young fellows who enlist to-day,\" went on Hal. \"I've been looking forward to the Philippines from the day I first took the oath in the recruiting station.\"  \"Well, we're here,\" replied Noll, breathing in the warm air with lazy satisfaction. \"And I'm mighty glad that we're in for two years of it.\"  The Thirty-fourth had come out to the islands as a complete regiment. They had reëmbarked at Manila also as a regiment, but now the time had come when \"Ours\" was well scattered through the southern islands of the archipelago.  The second battalion and headquarters, with the band, had disembarked at Iloilo; two companies had been left on the island of Negros, and two more on Cebu. B and C Companies had been left at Fort Franklin, in the Misamis district on northern Mindanao, and the remaining two companies had been carried on to Zamboanga.  On its return trip the \"Warren\" had picked up the scattered military commands which the Thirty-fourth had relieved. Two companies of the Thirty-second infantry had gone from Bantoc the day before.  Mindanao is the second largest and the most fertile island in the Philippine group. The natural beauty is as great as the fertility. If it were not for the occasional ferocity of some of the tribes this island could be turned into one vast net-work of plantations as rich as any that the world can show.  Bantoc was a sleepy, sunlit little town, half Spanish and half Moro. Thanks to American rule, the streets were clean and order reigned. There were about forty stores and other mercantile establishments in Bantoc, for this town was headquarters for a large country district. The people of Bantoc, outside of the small white population, were more than half Moros, the other islanders belonging to the Tagalo and other allied tribes. Almost without exception these people were lazy and good-natured. A newcomer would have difficulty in believing that such men as he met in Bantoc could ever give the soldiers trouble. It was to this town that the few planters and many small native farmers sent rich stores of rice, cocoa, hemp, cotton, indigo and costly woods.  There was also the port of Bantoc, through which these products were sent out to do their part in the world's commerce.  The native leaders of the population of Bantoc were wealthy little brown men. There was much money in circulation, the leading Moros and Tagalos having handsome homes and entertaining lavishly. There was a native fashionable set, just as exclusive and autocratic as any that exists in a white man's country.  Fort Franklin overlooked the bay at the opposite end from the port. Yet it was a \"fort\" only in being a military station. There was no artillery here, and the only fortifications were semi-permanent earthworks, fronted by ditches, thrown up around the officers' quarters and the barracks and other buildings. The parade ground and recreation spaces were outside these very ordinary fortifications.  \"The whole scene looks too peacefully lazy to match with the yarns we hear of trouble breeding among the Moros in those mountains yonder,\" remarked Hal musingly.  \"If trouble is coming, I hope it will come soon,\" returned Sergeant Noll. \"The only one thing that I have against our life out here is that it threatens to become too lazy an existence. If there's going to be any active service for us, I want to see it happen soon, for active service is what I came to the Philippines for, anyway, as far as I had any interest in the trip.\"  \"From the gossip of the town and barracks, I think we'll have our trouble soon enough,\" Hal replied. \"You have fatigue duty this afternoon, haven't you, Noll?\"  \"Yes; thanks to your detail,\" replied Noll.  \"But I couldn't help the detail, old fellow. Fatigue was for you in your turn. I'm sorry it came to you to-day, though, for I've a pass and I'm going to run over into Bantoc. I want to see more of that queer little town.\"  \"Going to be back for parade?\"  \"Yes; my pass extends only to parade. I never want to miss that when I can help it.\"  Hal glanced at his watch, then back at barracks, where hardly a soldier showed himself, for all had caught the spirit of indolence in this hot, moist climate of Mindanao.  \"Well, I must be going, Noll. Don't work your fatigue party too hard until the men get used to this heat.\"  \"Small danger of my working 'em too hard,\" laughed Noll. \"It's only as a sort of special favor that the fellows will work at all.\"  Hal, with a nod to his chum, stepped out on to the hard, level, white road that led from Fort Franklin to Bantoc.  It was a pretty road, shaded at points by beautiful palms; yet the shade was not sufficient to protect the young soldier all the way into town. Ere he had gone far he found it necessary to carry his damp handkerchief in one hand, prepared to mop his steaming face.  \"Mindanao is certainly some hot,\" he muttered. \"It keeps a fellow steaming all the time.\"  Yet there was plenty to divert one's thoughts from himself, for along this road lay some of the prettiest small farms to be found on northern Mindanao. Instead of farms they really looked more like well-kept gardens.  \"It's the finest spot in the world to be lazy in,\" thought the young sergeant, as he glanced here and there over the charming scene. \"If I settled down here for life I'd want money enough to pay other fellows to do all the work for me.\"  Though Hal did not know it, from the window of one room in a house that he passed a pair of unusually bright, keen eyes glared out at him.  \"That is he, the _sergente_, Overton,\" growled Vicente Tomba to himself. \"Since we have Señor Draney's orders that the _sergente_ is to leave this life as soon as possible, why not to-day? He is going to Bantoc, where it will be easy to snare him. And his friend Terry is not with him. That pair, back to back, might put up a hard fight--but one alone should be easy for our _bravos_. Then, another day, we can plan to get the _Sergente_ Terry.\"  Hal was not quite in Bantoc when a Tagalo on a pony rode by him at a gallop. Hal glanced at the fellow indolently, but did not recognize him, as it was not Tomba, but one of that worthy's messengers.  Up and down the principal street Sergeant Overton wandered. He glanced into shops, though only idly, for to-day he was not on a buying mission.  At last the cool-looking interior of a little restaurant attracted him. He entered, ordering an ice cream. When this was finished he ate another. It was so restful, sitting here, that when he had disposed of the second order, he paid his account but did not rise at once.  \"The _sergente_ is newly arrived here?\" asked a white-clad Filipino, rising from another table and joining Overton.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then you have not seen much of Bantoc?\" asked the Filipino, speaking in Spanish.  \"Not as much as I mean to see of the town,\" Hal answered in the same tongue.  \"Then possibly, Señor Sergente, you have not yet seen the collection of ancient Moro weapons in the shop of Juan Cerverra.\"  \"I haven't,\" Hal admitted.  \"Then you have missed much, señor, but you will no doubt go to see the collection one of these days.\"  \"I'd like to. Where is the shop?\"  \"Four doors below here. If you have time, Señor Sergente, I am walking that way and will show you the place.\"  \"Thank you; I'll be glad to go,\" answered Hal, rising promptly. His was the profession of arms, and a display of any unfamiliar weapons was sure to attract the young sergeant.  Juan Cerverra, despite his Spanish-sounding name, proved to be a full-blooded Moro. He wore his Moro costume, with its tight-fitting trousers and short, embroidered blouse. There were no customers in the shop when Hal and his Tagalo acquaintance entered.  In another moment Sergeant Hal was deeply absorbed in several wall cases of swords and knives, all of them of old-time patterns. It was a sight that would have bewildered a lover and collector of curios of past ages.  One case was filled entirely with fine specimens of that once-dreaded weapon, the Moro \"campilan.\" This is a straight sword, usually, with a very heavy blade, which gradually widens towards the end. This is a heavy cutting sword, and one that was placed in Sergeant Hal's hands, though Cerverra claimed that it was two hundred years old, had an edge like a razor.  \"How much is such a sword as this?\" Hal inquired.  \"Forty dollars,\" replied Cerverra.  \"Gold!\"  \"No; Mex.\"  Hal felt almost staggered with the cheapness of things here, as compared with the curio stores in Manila. Forty dollars \"Mex\" meant but about twenty dollars in United States currency.  \"I have some cheaper ones,\" went on Cerverra. \"Here is one at eighteen dollars.\"  \"I'm going to have one of these campilan,\" Hal told himself.  In his interest he did not note that the Tagalo who had brought him to the shop had left him and was standing on the sidewalk outside.  \"Are you interested in these creeses?\" inquired Cerverra, passing down the shop and pointing to another wall case.  The creese is an ancient Malay knife, with a waved, snaky blade--a weapon with which the Malay pirates of the past used to do fearful execution.  Hal stepped before the wall case. \"They are very interesting looking,\" he replied. \"What does a good creese cost?\"  The young sergeant did not wait for an answer.  Click! A spring bolt on the under side of a trap door on which he was standing shot out of place.  Down dropped the trap door with such suddenness that Hal Overton did not have even time to clutch at anything.  Then the trap door, relieved of his weight, flew back into place.  Sergeant Hal shot down a steep incline, too smooth for him to be able to stay his downward progress.     CHAPTER V  ENOUGH TO \"RATTLE\" THE VICTIM   Bump!  Sergeant Hal landed at least twenty feet below with a suddenness that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23447"],["title","Uncle Sam's Boys in the Philippines; or, Following the Flag against the Moros (#7)"],["body","all the breath out of him for a moment.  Ere he could recover his half-scattered senses he felt himself seized. Nor had the Army boy fallen into one pair of hands. Four or five men, as nearly as he could judge, seized hold of different parts of his body.  There was little use in a prostrate youth fighting against such odds. Hal was swiftly rolled over on to his face, in the dark, and two of his captors threw themselves upon him, holding him down.  At the same time another thrust an armful of hemp under his face, holding it close against his mouth.  Then the light of a dark lantern was flashed on the scene. With the speed of skilled hands at the game these brown-skinned captors bound the young sergeant hand and foot.  \"Quit this!\" Sergeant Overton tried to shout angrily, but the wad of hemp was forced between his teeth and only a faint sound came forth.  \"Help!\" he tried to shout, but the sound came hardly louder than a sigh.  Now he was whirled over on his back, helpless, and two of the brown rascals finished their work by thrusting the hemp far enough into his mouth to shut off all speech. Then the gag was bound into place.  Hal could form little idea of his prison, save that it was an oblong, cellar-like place, perhaps a dozen feet wide by twenty feet long.  As nearly as the Army boy could guess, this cellar must be located under the street itself.  \"They've got me for fair,\" thought the young soldier in a rage that included himself as well as his captors. \"What's their game, I wonder? Robbery? If it is, they'll feel sold when they find how little money they are going to get.\"  By the light of the dark lantern, as he lay on his back on the damp ground, Hal made out the fact that his captors numbered eight. Five men had the look and wore the costumes of Moros; the other three rascals looked as though they might be Tagalos.  One after another the wretches looked down at the young soldier and grinned, though not one of them spoke.  Of a sudden the light went out. Hal, his ears unusually acute now, heard their moving footsteps. Then all became intensely still.  \"I wonder whether I'm a tremendously big fool, or whether I'm merely unfortunate?\" thought Hal bitterly. \"However, how was I to guess? In this Moro country must it be considered unsafe even to step into a store and look at the merchandise?\"  There was no answer to this. By degrees Hal began to feel decidedly uncomfortable as to the fate that he might expect.  \"If they meant only to rob me,\" he reflected, \"then why didn't they proceed at once? But not a single brown rascal of the lot took the trouble to thrust an exploring hand into my pockets. What, then? Do they want an Army prisoner, and if so, for what?\"  The longer the young soldier thought it over, the greater the puzzle became. Nor did it escape his imagination that possibly he was not to be allowed ever to see his comrades again. That thought, of course, sent a chill of horror chasing up and down young Overton's spine. He was not afraid to die in battle, if need be--but to be treated like a rat in a trap--that was different.  \"Well, they've got me, and I don't see any likelihood of getting away,\" decided Hal at last, after fully an hour devoted largely to futile efforts to wriggle out of the bonds that held his wrists secure behind his back. \"These knots have been tied by masters. I don't believe I could get out of them in hours. If they had only tied my hands in front of me, so that I could work them loose. Confound the pirates!\"  After what seemed like the passage of hours, the boy heard a slight sound. Listening intently, he heard it repeated.  Next a light was turned on--from the same dark lantern.  Behind the light Hal's dazzled eyes could make out the figure of a man.  Toward him the light came, Hal blinking in the glare until the newcomer halted beside him.  \"Ah, Señor Sergente!\" cried a mocking voice.  Then the new comer bent over the Army boy, and Overton knew him in an instant--Vicente Tomba.  \"That hemp in your mouth looks as though it might give you discomfort--a thousand pardons,\" observed Tomba mockingly, as he removed the cord that held the hemp in place.  Tomba now squatted on the ground beside the young soldier's head and drew out the wad of hemp.  \"So you are in this, Tomba?\" inquired the Army boy coldly. \"What's the game, anyway?\"  \"Possibly,\" sneered the Filipino, \"when you know more, you'll feel like making a noise. Let me assure you that no friend will hear if you do call. But any great amount of noise on your part might provoke me, and that would not be wise under the circumstances.\"  Showing his white, even teeth in an evil smile, Tomba took out of the breast of his blouse a small, bright-bladed creese that might have been borrowed from one of the wall cases in Cerverra's shop.  \"Why has this trick been played on me?\" demanded Sergeant Hal angrily.  \"A trick?\" laughed Tomba softly. \"Is that what you think it is? My friend, you will find that it is much more than a trick--it is a decree!\"  \"A decree?\" raged Sergeant Overton. \"What do you mean?\"  \"It is a decree from Señor Draney,\" went on Tomba coldly, maliciously. \"It can do no harm to mention that name since you can never repeat it to anyone but me, for Señor Draney's decree is that, when you go forth from here--to-night--you will know nothing afterwards, for you will be _past knowing_.\"     CHAPTER VI  LIFE HANGS ON A WORD   \"You are talking like a madman,\" sneered Hal.  \"And next you will be begging like one,\" returned Tomba, with that same easy but deadly laugh.  Hal, despite his grit, felt a start of terror. Cold sweat was now gathering on his forehead.  \"You refused my friendship some days ago,\" continued Tomba. \"You did not know how valuable it might be.\"  \"Can the friendship of a scoundrel like you ever be valuable?\" asked Overton.  \"In the present case it would be worth a little to you--your life!\"  \"What did you want of me, when you sought my acquaintance?\" demanded Hal.  He had suddenly become seized with a desire to prolong the talk with this little brown monster--to gain time!  \"There was something that you could have done for me,\" replied Vicente Tomba.  The Tagalo, like others of his race, was not averse to talking, either. The little Filipino knew that he had the whole situation in his hands. With the cruelty of a cat, Tomba delighted in the feline pastime of playing with a victim that could not escape him.  \"What did you want me to do?\" Hal asked almost blandly.  \"I wanted your services.\"  \"Yes, but what kind of services?\"  \"What is the use of telling you--_now_?\"  \"Tell me one thing, though, Tomba.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Just to gratify my curiosity,\" explained Sergeant Hal, and he spoke slowly while his eyes watched those of the Filipino. \"Did you want me to betray my Flag?\"  \"Not the Flag itself.\"  \"But, in some way, you wanted me to turn against my comrades--to serve you and your friends at the expense of the United States Government.\"  \"Yes,\" assented Tomba. \"But do not think to deceive me. It is too late now to save yourself by promising what I would have wanted of you.\"  \"I don't intend to serve you and your rascal friends at any price--at least, I haven't yet come to that decision,\" Hal added, in a more conciliatory tone. \"However, I am curious.\"  \"Curiosity can do you no good now,\" retorted Tomba softly, with a shrug of his shoulders.  \"What part is Draney playing with you brown-skinned men?\"  Tomba again shrugged his shoulders, this time more mockingly.  \"Señor Draney serves the same cause that I do,\" laughed the Filipino.  \"And what cause is that?\"  \"His purse.\"  \"Then, in other words, Tomba, you are not even a Filipino patriot. You are merely a twentieth-century type of pirate.\"  \"If you like the word,\" replied Tomba, in a tone of indifference.  Then he yawned--next placed the creese on the ground beside him, while his right hand explored his pockets. He soon brought to light a package of Manila cigarettes. Tomba's left hand produced a box of matches.  \"Do you care for one last smoke, Señor Sergente?\" inquired the Filipino with mocking politeness, as he held out the package.  \"Thank you; I never picked up the vice,\" Sergeant Hal answered, but he said it good-naturedly, for he had an object now in not provoking the enemy.  \"So? You call smoking a vice?\"  \"The vice of pigs,\" declared Hal, but again he laughed good-humoredly.  \"Oh, I do not mind your insolence,\" replied Tomba, striking a match and holding it to the end of the cigarette in his mouth. \"Abuse me all you please, Señor Sergente.\"  \"Thank you!\"  Hal had had a desperate motive in gaining time by prolonging the talk. As he lay on his side before the Filipino the young soldier had at last employed his fingers in a way that he hoped would lead to his being able to free his hands. And now the instant had come! His hands were free!  As he uttered that \"thank you,\" Sergeant Overton suddenly summoned all the muscles in his body to obey him in one frantic effort for safety and freedom.  Like a flash he rolled, both of his bound feet kicking Vicente Tomba and bowling over that astounded little brown man.  Like lightning the Army boy reached for the creese, and the finish of that general movement found Sergeant Hal Overton sitting up and aiming a desperate slash at the cord about his ankles.  It needed a second slash, and in that fleeting interval Vicente Tomba, uttering a wild cry of rage, hurled himself upon the Army boy.  Hal Overton had now, however, entire control of his body. He engaged with the little brown man in a desperate struggle. Over and over they rolled, the Army boy controlling the battle and carrying them both further from the creese that he had dropped on the ground.  Then, all in an instant, Hal freed his right hand, clenched his fist and struck Tomba a staggering blow between the eyes.  When Tomba came to himself again, after a few moments, he found the youth in Uncle Sam's Army uniform leaning over him.  \"I have the creese, Tomba,\""]]]
