Then came a rustling sound on the stairs, followed by a low moaning, and into view glided two ghostly figures in flowing robes of white. These figures paused in a corner of the room where the shadows were deepest, and the surprised witnesses seemed to see through their white draperies the gleaming outlines of the upper portions of two skeletons. The ribs, the waving, bony arms, and the horrible, shining skulls were plainly beheld. After a moment the two apparitions advanced.  \"Heap spook!\" cried Hodge, while Frank pretended to be greatly alarmed.  Browning sat bolt upright, uttering a grunt of surprise.  As the forms came forward into the dim light the skeleton figures faded and disappeared.  \"I reckon these are the real things, Injun,\" said Frank.  \"Much so,\" nodded Bart.  Then the girls broke into laughter and Mrs. Medford turned up the lamp.  With the aid of two sheets, a needle and thread and a few pins, Mrs. Medford had made some very ghostly garments for the girls, fitting them with a skill which partly revealed and partly concealed the graceful outlines of the wearers. Eyelets had been cut, and the general effect was indeed striking.  \"But the skeletons we saw?\" questioned Frank.  \"A little phosphorus produced them,\" explained Mrs. Medford. \"I drew the skeleton outlines on the sheets with phosphorus. Of course they'll be visible only in the dark.\"  \"Mrs. Medford, you're a wonder!\" declared Hodge. \"Now we're all right. There'll be ghosts abroad in the Adirondacks to-night.\"  After a general inspection of their costumes, the party prepared to start.  \"Almost wish I had decided to go,\" confessed Browning. \"But I'll stay here and take care of Mrs. Medford.\"  \"If you wish to go, I can take care of her,\" assured Warren Hatch.  \"It's too late now,\" said Bruce quickly. \"Besides that, it's quite a walk over there, and I'd get tired of dancing in short order. I'll stay here and rest.\"  They paused a moment on the veranda. The night was very still, and the moon was just rising above the treetops, silvering the mirror-like surface of the lake.  From far away on the southern shore came the sound of music and they could see the gleaming lights.  \"Take care of those girls, boys,\" called Mrs. Medford. \"If anything happens to them I'll never forgive myself for letting them out of my sight.\"  \"Don't worry,\" advised Frank. \"You may rest assured that they are quite safe in our care. We'll guard them with our lives, but there is no possibility of danger to-night.\"  Little he knew what would happen before the night passed.     CHAPTER V.  THE WOLVES.   The pavilion was brilliantly lighted. Hundreds of Chinese lanterns were suspended from the beams and cross timbers. The musicians were hidden by an arbor of green at one end of the floor. The floor itself swarmed with dancers wearing all sorts of grotesque and beautiful costumes.  Amid the whirling throng two ghosts were waltzing, the partner of one being a cowboy, while the right arm of a redskin encircled the waist of the other.  The waltzing of these couples was the poetry of grace and motion. They seemed to glide over the floor without effort of any sort. The ease of their movements was admired by many.  \"Isn't it delightful, Frank?\" enthusiastically whispered one of the ghosts; and her cowboy partner answered:  \"It's all the more delightful being unexpected and unplanned, Inza. I feel to-night as if I hadn't a care in the world.\"  \"Why have you any great cares to worry you now?\" she asked. \"All your great business projects are coming out right, and the man who could make you trouble has paid the penalty of his villainy. He'll never interfere with you again.\"  \"That's right. With him out of the way, his railroad plan and mining and development company will never mature.\"  \"I see no reason why you should hurry back to Mexico now. Can't you remain in the East longer?\"  \"I'll know better about that after consulting with Watson Scott. If possible to linger, I'll be in no hurry to go.\"  They swept past a solitary man who stood watching the dancers. His mask was the head of a wolf. Through the twin holes of the mask his eyes gleamed strangely as they followed Merry and Inza.  Another wolf approached and touched the first on the shoulder.  \"Have you found him yet?\"  \"Look!\" exclaimed the first. \"See the girl in flowing white?\"  \"With the Indian?\"  \"No; with the cowboy.\"  \"I have noticed both.\"  \"Well, it is the cowboy I want you to watch. Listen near him. Hear him speak. I think it is our man. If so--well, to-night I strike the blow that makes me the master!\"  \"Your head----\"  \"Never mind. I have taken pains to hide well anything that might betray me. The dead seldom rise, and I am dead, you know.\"  \"It's the greatest wonder in the world that you are not.\"  The music stopped. Frank escorted Inza to one of the great, open windows, through which came a grateful breath of the cool, still night. Through the trees outside they could see the lake, with the silver moonlight shimmering on its bosom.  \"It's a beautiful spot here,\" said the girl. \"See how peaceful everything is out there, Frank.\"  After a few moments they strolled out together beneath the trees, where the shadows were heavy. Arm in arm, they walked up and down, pausing at intervals to listen to the music which came from the pavilion, where the dancers were again whirling over the polished floor.  Suddenly they came face to face with a silent figure beneath the trees. This figure started back, uttering a low exclamation, turned suddenly, and almost fled round a corner of the building.  Frank laughed.  \"You gave him a start, Inza. The phosphorus skeleton shows plainly here, you know.\"  \"Somehow I didn't fancy that was why he fled so quickly,\" she said.  \"What other reason could there have been?\"  \"I don't know, but there seemed something familiar in his movements. It was fancy, I suppose.\"  \"It must have been. We know no one here, save Hodge and Elsie.\"  \"Let's go in. Somehow a feeling of apprehension is on me. I'm not often nervous, you know; but something is the matter with my nerves now.\"  He laughed at her, but they returned to the floor and danced out the latter part of the two-step.  When this dance was over Merry left Inza, departing to find and bring her a glass of water.  Barely was he gone when she was surprised to hear a harsh voice at her elbow saying:  \"I'll not believe your ghostly garments hide nothing save the hideous skeleton I saw a few moments ago. I must confess you gave me a shock.\"  One of the wolves had paused close at hand.  Knowing the dance was informal, as masquerade affairs must be, she was not surprised to be addressed in this manner.  \"Then it was you who fled before me?\" she laughed. \"It seems that even a wolf may be frightened by a ghost.\"  \"Quite true, fair wraith; but you are not the only ghost at this dance to-night.\"  \"I have a sister ghost with me.\"  \"It was not your sister I spoke of,\" growled the wolf. \"There is still a third ghost present.\"  \"Indeed? I have not seen----\"  \"I think you will later. For all of your awesome aspect I would entreat you to favor me with one dance were it not that something I cannot explain denies me the pleasure of dancing to-night.\"  \"Why do you growl in that manner? Are you trying to disguise your voice? It is not necessary, for I know only my own friends at this dance.\"  \"It is natural for wolves to growl,\" he retorted. \"Although you know few here, it is possible you are known. I think I can describe you.\"  \"I doubt it.\"  \"You are dark, with black hair and eyes.\"  \"Wonderful guessing.\"  \"Your lips are like the reddest rose, and your teeth are so many pearls.\"  \"Flattering, at least.\"  \"Of your sex you are the fairest ever beheld by the eyes of wolf.\"  \"You forget you have not seen me.\"  \"If that is true, I'll convince you that the sagacity of some wolves passes human understanding. Your name is--Inza!\"  She fell back in amazement, betraying her surprise by the movement.  From behind the wolf mask came a low, growling chuckle.  \"It is enough!\" he declared. \"To deny it now would be useless. The cowboy returns, and cowboys do not like wolves, so I will slink away.\"  Filled with amazement, Inza watched him as he walked swiftly away. Frank came up and she clutched his arm, pointing at the retreating figure and almost panting:  \"Who is that man?\"  \"I don't know, Inza. Has he bothered or insulted you? If so, I will----\"  \"Frank, he knows me!\"  \"Impossible!\"  \"He spoke my name! He called me Inza. His words were strange and somewhat faltering. He spoke with a growl that I am certain he assumed to disguise his voice. There is something familiar about him--something familiar in his movements and his walk. Frank, I know him! Is there no way to find out who he is?\"  Merry was aroused.  \"Drink, Inza,\" he said, \"and I'll find a way to discover who he is. Perhaps Warren Hatch has put up a joke on us. If so, we must turn the joke.\"  Bart and Elsie came up. Frank left Inza with them as he returned with the empty glass.  Leaving the glass, he set out to find the wolf. As he was passing one of the wide windows he saw two wolves standing outside. Immediately he stepped through the window and joined them.  \"Howdy, pards,\" he said, with an assumption of the cowboy manner. \"I opine one of you two was chinning with my friend, the ghost, a few moments ago. Now, even a wolf won't take advantage of a lady, and so, as you happened to call her name, I reckon it's up to you in natural politeness to give her yours in return.\"  They appeared somewhat startled, but one of them said:  \"You're mistaken, sir; neither of us has spoken to a lady since arriving here to-night. We have not danced yet, and therefore have not had occasion to speak to any of the fair sex.\"  Frank rested his hands on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22874"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Pursuit; Or, How to Win (#4)"],["body","hips and eyed them searchingly.  \"I have the word of the lady herself,\" he said. \"I don't opine you're going to dispute a lady?\"  \"You are at liberty to opine what you like,\" sneered the second wolf; \"and I advise you to go about your business, unless you are looking for trouble. If it's trouble you are after, you may get more than you want.\"  \"I never hunt trouble; but I thought it possible that, out of politeness, the one who spoke to the lady would give his name.\"  \"Get about your own business and leave us alone,\" advised the pugnacious chap. \"If you don't you'll get your make-up ruffled.\"  Now, Frank had not confronted them with the idea of pressing a quarrel. His first thought had been to draw them into conversation that he might hear their voices, thinking it possible he would recognize one or both of them. There was nothing familiar about their voices, however, and now their offensive atmosphere aroused him and caused his blood to stir warmly in his body.  \"Although there are two of you,\" he said, \"I would advise you some not to try any ruffling business with me. It might work unpleasantly for you.\"  This angered them, and suddenly they both attacked Frank.  Instantly there was a stir within the pavilion, for men uttered exclamations, and women gave cries of alarm.  Hodge had remained with Inza and Elsie, but at the first alarm, thinking Frank might be in trouble, he left the girls and dashed across the floor. Elsie called to him, starting to follow. Suddenly she stopped, turning back to Inza, whom she had left by the open window.  Inza was gone.  \"Where is she?\" gasped Elsie, looking around. \"I am sure----\"  She paused in bewilderment, a sudden feeling of terror seizing her.  From somewhere in the grove outside the pavilion came a smothered cry of distress.  Elsie Bellwood had left Inza standing close to the huge, open window. Barely was Elsie's back turned when the heavy folds of a blanket were thrown over Inza's head and she felt herself lifted bodily and snatched through the window.  Remarkable though it was, no one within the pavilion saw this happen. The attention of all was turned toward the opposite side of the building, where the encounter was taking place between Frank and the two wolves.  At first Inza was stunned and bewildered. Her hands and arms were enfolded in the blanket, and she was unable to make anything like effective resistance. The blanket was twisted about her until she could not cast it off, and she felt herself lifted and carried away in a pair of arms that held her tightly.  Had she been of a nervous or timid nature she might have fainted at once. But she was brave and nervy and she struggled hard for her freedom, seeking to cast off the blanket which was smothering her and giving her a sensation of agony.  The man had not carried her far when she nearly succeeded in getting her head clear of the blanket. She uttered a cry that was broken and smothered, for, with an exclamation of dismay, her captor again twisted the blanket tightly about her head and neck.  It was this cry which reached the ears of Elsie, who had just missed her friend.  Inza continued to struggle, kicking and uttering muffled cries beneath the blanket; but she was helpless, and, holding her thus, the man, who wore a wolf mask, almost ran through the grove to the shore of the lake.  By the time the shore was reached the girl's struggles had become very weak, and the only sounds issuing from the smothering folds of the blanket were choking moans.  As Inza's captor approached the water he uttered a low, peculiar whistle.  It was answered by a similar whistle.  The answer served to guide the man with the wolf mask to the spot where a canoe lay floating with its prow touching the shore, guarded by a man who stood straight and silent on the bank.  \"Ben!\" excitedly yet softly called the man with the girl.  \"Here,\" was the answer.  \"Ready with the canoe! Back there you hear them shouting. Thank the saints the señorita no longer struggles! She has fainted.\"  \"What got?\" asked the man on the shore, who was a full-blooded Indian guide, known as Red Ben. \"Big bundle.\"  \"Never mind what I have here. I paid you to wait and be ready to take me away in a hurry, and now it is in a hurry I must go. Swing the canoe so I may put her in it.\"  The shouts of men and excited voices of women came to their ears from the pavilion.  \"Let them bark!\" muttered Inza's captor. \"I'll soon be far away, and the water will leave no trail for Merriwell, the gringo, to follow. Once he trailed me, but I have taken precautions this time.\"  Unhesitatingly he stepped into the water beside the canoe, in the bottom of which he placed Inza, with the blanket still wrapped about her. A moment later he was seated in the canoe, which Red Ben pushed off from shore, springing in himself and seizing a paddle.  \"Keep in the shadows near the shore,\" directed the wearer of the wolf mask. \"Paddle hard, for much trouble it might make us both should we be seen.\"  \"You steal gal?\" questioned the curious Indian.  \"She belongs to me,\" was the answer. \"My enemy claims her, but she is mine. Don't talk, Ben--paddle for your life. Were we to be seen now----\"  \"Point out there,\" said the redskin. \"We go by him, nobody back there see us.\"  \"Then get past the point at your finest speed, and it is doubly well you shall be paid for this night's work.\"  The Indian made the canoe fly over the surface of the water. He kept close to the shore of a little cove and then swept out in the shadow of the trees along the rim of the lake, soon reaching the point.  As Ben sent the canoe shooting past that point it came near colliding with another canoe that contained a single occupant, who was smoking a pipe and paddling along leisurely.  \"Look out, you lubbers!\" grunted the man with the pipe. \"What are you trying to do?\"  It was Bruce Browning, who, after all, had found it impossible to remain at the cottage. In Joe's canoe Bruce was leisurely paddling over to the south shore, thinking he would look in on the dancers. He had not heard the approach of the other canoe and knew nothing of its presence until it shot past the point and nearly struck him.  Neither Red Ben nor his companion made any retort. The Indian swerved the canoe aside and continued to ply the paddle, flashing past Bruce.  Browning stared in surprise, for the moonlight fell full and fair on the redskin's companion, showing the wolf mask.  \"One of the dancers, I judge,\" he mumbled. \"Nice, sociable fellow! Never said a word when they came so near cutting me in two. What's he doing now?\"  Bruce swung his canoe so he could watch the other without cramping his neck, for he saw that something like a struggle was taking place, the masked man seemingly holding some object helpless in the bottom of the frail craft.  \"Queer doings,\" growled the big fellow. \"I'd like to know what it means. There seems to be some sort of excitement going on yonder.\"  He turned from the canoe to listen to the sounds on shore.  \"Guess I'll poke along and find out what all the racket is,\" he decided, as he resumed his lazy paddling, giving no further attention to the other canoe.  Arriving at the landing, Bruce made his way to the pavilion. Ere he reached it he was certain something of an unusual nature had taken place. Persons were searching with lights in the grove, and he encountered a party of four, who surveyed him searchingly and passed on.  He had reached the pavilion when he encountered Hodge, who was doing his best to quiet Elsie, the latter apparently being on the verge of hysterics.  \"What's the matter, Bart?\" asked Bruce, wonderingly. \"What's happened here, anyhow?\"  Hodge clutched him by the shoulder.  \"Inza!\" he exclaimed. \"She has disappeared mysteriously.\"  The big fellow immediately threw off his apathy. His careless, lazy air vanished in a twinkling and he asked some questions that brought a brief but complete explanation from Bart.  \"Where is Frank?\" demanded Browning.  \"He is with the searchers.\"  Bruce lost no time in looking for Merriwell, soon coming face to face with him in the grove. Frank's face was pale and stern, and there was a dangerous, desperate gleam in his eyes.  \"You're wasting your time here, Merry,\" declared Bruce. \"Hodge has just told me of the men who wore the wolf masks. There must have been three of them. While you were having that set-to with two of them the third carried Inza off.\"  \"But where is she?\" asked Frank hoarsely. \"Where did he take her?\"  \"You won't find her on shore. Look on the lake.\"  \"The lake?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Why----\"  Immediately Browning told how he had seen one of the men wearing a wolf mask in the canoe which so nearly collided with the one he occupied.  \"There was something in the bottom of that canoe. I fancied a struggle was taking place. I thought it mighty singular.\"  \"By Heaven!\" cried Frank, \"if a hair of Inza's head is harmed the guilty wretch shall pay the penalty with his life!\"     CHAPTER VI.  IN THE GRASP OF DEL NORTE.   There are two large, heavily wooded islands in Lake Placid. Into a little cove of the northern island Red Ben ran his canoe. His companion, still wearing the wolf mask, stepped out and lifted the helpless girl, bearing her along a path that led to a little opening where the moonlight fell brightly. He placed her on the ground and stood gazing down at her, his arms folded. He had removed the stifling blanket from her head and shoulders.  \"By my soul she is beautiful!\" he murmured, and the words were spoken in Spanish. His voice was soft and musical, quite unlike the growling hoarseness of the wolf with whom Inza had conversed at the pavilion.  A silent shadow slipped into the opening and stood near. It was the Indian.  \"Much dangerous business,\" he said. \"You tell Ben you want to square old score with Merriwell man. Tell me be ready to take you quick away in canoe. No tell me you carry off gal.\"  \"I did not know she would be there,\" explained the wolf. \"When I"]]]
