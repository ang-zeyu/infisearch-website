He entertained a strong suspicion that these McLeods had penetrated into the wilderness to the neighbourhood of the Cliff Fort, not so much for the purpose of cutting timber, as for secret opposition in the fur-trade, of which the company he represented had for many years enjoyed almost a monopoly.  His pride was touched, his spirit was fired.  Perhaps the peaceful and secluded life he had led rendered this little opportunity of warfare more a pleasure than a pain to him.  At all events the thing was not to be tolerated.  The saw-mill, which the McLeods had an undoubted right to erect on the unoccupied lands, was being planted on the very border of the Company's reserve lands, which they had purchased, and which were clearly laid down in plans.  He would see to it that these interlopers did not trespass by an inch--no, not by an eighth of an inch--if _he_ had power to prevent it!  The fact that the McLeods were said to be resolute men made him more determined to assert his rights.  He therefore declined Mr Gambart's invitation firmly.  \"I will stay,\" said he, \"only one day, to look out for a house, and then return.\"  \"Look out for a house!\" exclaimed the surveyor, in surprise, \"what mean you?  Do you think of settling down here?\"  \"Indeed I do,\" replied Redding, with a smile.  \"I have long been brooding over that subject.  The fact is, Mr Gambart, that I am tired of solitude.  I am a sociable being, and find it hard to endure the society of only five or six men in a place where there are no women, no children, and no end of bears!  I intend to leave the Fur Company's service,--indeed my resignation is already sent in,--purchase a small farm here, and get--\"  \"Get a wife, a horse, a dog, and a gun, and settle down to enjoy yourself, eh?\" interrupted the surveyor.  \"Well, I had not gone quite so much into details,\" answered Redding, with a laugh, \"but you are right in so far as settling down goes.  My only fear is that it won't be easy to find a place that will at once suit my fancy and my purse.  The small sum of money left me by my father at his death two years ago will not purchase a very extensive place, but--\"  \"I know the very thing to suit you,\" interrupted the surveyor with emphasis, \"a splendid little cottage--quite a mansion in miniature--with garden, fences, fields, outhouses, etcetera, all complete and going literally for an old song.  Come, we'll `go visit it by the pale moonlight' just now, return to have tea with the ladies, and to-morrow we'll go see it by daylight.  It is close at hand, the name is Loch Dhu, and it has only one objection.\"  \"What may that be?\" asked Redding, much amused at the abrupt little man's energy.  \"Won't tell you till you've seen it; come.\"  Without more ado they sallied forth and walked along the snowy track that led to the cottage in question.  A few minutes sufficed to bring them to it, and the first glance showed the fur-trader that his friend had not exaggerated the beauty of the place.  The cottage, although small, was so elegant in form and so tastefully planned in every respect that it well deserved the title of a mansion in miniature.  It stood on a rising ground which was crowned with trees; and the garden in front, the summer-house, the porch, the trellis-work fence, the creepers, the flower-beds--everything in fact, told that it had been laid out and planned by a refined mind.  Of course Redding had to call in the aid of his imagination a little, for at the moment when he first beheld it, the whole scene was robed in a mantle of snow.  Close to the house, and in sight of the front windows, was a small lake or pond, by the side of which rose an abrupt precipice of about fifty feet in height.  Beyond this, a little to the right, lay the undulating fields of the settlement, dotted with clumps of trees and clusters of cottages.  \"Most beautiful!\" exclaimed the fur-trader, \"but why named Loch Dhu, which, if I mistake not, is the Gaelic for Black Lake?\"  \"Because that little pond,\" answered the surveyor, \"when freed from its wintry coat, looks dark and deep even at mid-day, under the shadow of that beetling cliff.\"  \"Truly, I like it well,\" said Redding, as he turned again to look at the cottage, \"are you its architect?\"  \"I am,\" answered Mr Gambart, \"but a greater mind than mine guided my pencil in the process of its creation.\"  \"Indeed! and what is the objection to it that you spoke of?\"  \"That,\" replied the surveyor, with a mysterious look, \"I must, on second thoughts, decline to tell you.\"  \"How, then, can you expect me to buy the place?\" demanded Redding, in surprise.  \"Why, because I, a disinterested friend, strongly recommend you to do so.  You believe in me.  Well, I tell you that there is no objection to the place but one, and that one won't prove to be an objection in the long run, though it is one just now.  The price is, as you know, ridiculously small, first, because the family who owned it have been compelled by reverses of fortune to part with it, and are in urgent need of ready cash; and, secondly, because few people have yet found out the beauties of this paradise, which will one day become a very important district of Canada.\"  \"Humph, well, I believe in your friendship, and to some extent in your wisdom, though I doubt your capacity to prophesy,\" said Redding. \"However, if you won't tell me the objection, I must rest content. To-morrow we will look at it in daylight, and if I then see no objections to it myself, I'll buy it.\"  The morrow came.  In the blaze of the orb of day Loch Dhu looked more beautiful than it did by moonlight.  After a thorough examination of house and grounds, the fur-trader resolved to purchase it, and commissioned his plump little friend to carry out the transaction. Thereafter he and his man retraced their steps to the wilderness, still breathing unutterable things against the entire clan of McLeod.    CHAPTER FOUR.  PIONEERING.  We turn now to \"the enemy\"--the McLeods.  The father and his two sons sat in a rude shanty, on a bench and an empty keg, drinking tea out of tin cans.  They were all stalwart, dark-haired, grave-visaged mountaineers of Scotland.  Unitedly they would have measured at least eighteen feet of humanity.  The only difference between the father and the sons was that a few silver hairs mingled with the black on the head of the former, and a rougher skin covered his countenance.  In other respects he seemed but an elder brother.  \"Ian,\" he said to his first-born, as he refilled his tin can with tea, \"how many more timbers have you to prepare for the dam?\"  \"Six,\" replied the son laconically.  \"It seems to me,\" observed Kenneth, the second son, \"that if the frost holds much longer we shall be thrown idle, for everything is ready now to begin the works.\"  \"Idle we need not be,\" returned the father, \"as long as there is timber to fell in the forest.  We must prepare logs to be sawn as well as the mill to saw them.\"  \"I can't help thinking, father,\" said Ian, \"that we did not act wisely in spending all the remainder of our cash in an order for goods from England.  We should have waited to see how the mill paid before setting up a store.  Besides, I have my doubts as to the wood-cutters or other people passing this out-o'-the-way spot in sufficient numbers to make a store pay for many a day to come, and even if they do, people coming up the coast will have the Fur Company's store at the Cliff Fort to go to for supplies.\"  \"It's too late to think of these things now,\" retorted the elder McLeod; \"we have made the venture, and must go through with it.  Our case shows the folly of taking the advice of a friend, of whose wisdom one is not well assured.  No doubt Gambart meant to do us a service, and fancied that he knew this coast well, but it is quite plain that he was mistaken, for I have no doubt now, from the situation of the place, that there will be little or no traffic here for a long time to come.\"  \"So, then, we might as well have thrown the remnant of our wrecked fortunes into the sea,\" said Kenneth gravely.  \"Not quite,\" returned the father, with a smile.  \"If we can only manage to hold on for a year or two, we shall be sure to succeed, for there can be no question that the tide of immigration is beginning to set in this direction, but it does not flow fast, and our great difficulty in the meantime will be the want of ready cash.\"  \"Act in haste and repent at leisure,\" said Ian.  \"One can scarcely be said to act in haste,\" retorted his father, \"who is almost forced into a course of action.  My chief mistake was in putting too much trust in Gambart.\"  \"Well,\" said Kenneth, rising and stretching his huge frame as he placed a hatchet on his shoulder, \"there's nothing like a good breakfast for giving a man heart to face difficulties.  I'll away to work.  What a pity that we may not raise some of our timbers on the other side of the creek, for it is admirably adapted to our purpose.  Don't you think we might, father?\"  \"No,\" replied the elder McLeod, \"the other side belongs to the fur-traders, whose rights must be respected.\"  Ian and his father soon followed Kenneth to the scene of their labours.  The spot was a wild one, but in many respects it was well-suited to the purpose, for which these adventurers had chosen it.  The coast line at Jenkins Creek was precipitous.  Cliffs, crowned with pines, rose in some places perpendicularly from the shingly beach of the gulf, and elsewhere the ground was very rugged.  The creek itself was a mere streamlet which ran a short course from the mountains of the interior, brawling down a wild gully of inconsiderable extent.  Near its mouth was a cascade, divided by a small rock or islet.  It was between this rock and the south shore that the McLeods purposed to erect their dam when the ice should have cleared away, and here, in the meantime,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23388"],["title","Wrecked but not Ruined (#4)"],["body","three men busied themselves in cutting and shaping the necessary timbers, and forming the rougher parts of the machinery of the mill.  They toiled steadily till noon, and then returned to their log-hut for dinner, which consisted of cold pork, hot tea, biscuit, and salt butter. They were still in the midst of this meal when the door opened and a man entered, carrying under his arm a pair of long snow-shoes, which he had just taken off.  \"Glad to see you, Bellew, we had expected you earlier,\" said the elder McLeod, rising and shaking hands with the trapper.  \"I would have been earlier,\" replied Bellew, handing a letter to McLeod, \"but for a redskin whom I met on the way, who delayed me somewhat.  He tells me something about a wreck having been seen by some of his tribe, a good bit down the gulf, but what between the difficulty of makin' out his lingo, and his stupidity, or unwillingness to communicate all he knew, I have found out very little about it.  This only I feel pretty sure of, that a wreck must have occurred, and that, from something he said, there may perhaps be some poor fellows lying on the shore there.\"  \"If so, they will surely perish in such weather,\" said McLeod, \"and the least we can do is to go and try to rescue them.\"  \"No need for you to go,\" said the trapper, \"I will go alone with a small supply of provisions, and see whether it be true.  If I find any of 'em alive I can make them comfortable enough for a short time, and then return here for such help as may be required.\"  \"You'll start at once, then?\" asked McLeod.  \"Yes, at once.\"  \"Here, have something to eat first,\" said Kenneth, pointing to the viands.  Jonas Bellew accepted the invitation.  At once he sat down, and ate in silence heartily, while the elder McLeod read the letter.  \"Have you bad news?\" asked Ian, as he watched his father's face.  \"Not exactly bad, but it's disappointing.  This is from Gambart.-- Listen.    \"My dear McLeod,--I have just heard that the flour-mill in this place   which you were so anxious to purchase has come unexpectedly into the   market, owing to the sudden death of its owner.  It is to be had cheap   too--at a very much lower figure than you offered before leaving   Partridge Bay.  I strongly advise you to secure it without delay.   This letter goes by Sam Smalls to Bellew the trapper, who will   doubtless deliver it to you.  You'd better send him straight back with   your reply.\"  \"Humph! good advice this time,\" said Ian when his father ceased to read, \"if we could only take it.  'Tis hard to have every penny we possess locked up, with such a chance before us.  Couldn't we borrow, in the meantime, from Gambart himself?\"  \"I will never purchase property with borrowed capital,\" replied the elder McLeod.  \"Well, it can't be helped,\" said Ian, consoling himself with another slice of cold pork.  \"Now I'm ready to start,\" said Bellew, rising and wiping his mouth with the cuff of his capote.  In a few minutes the trapper, on snow-shoes, and with a pack of provisions on his back, was striding down the coast at a pace that soon left the Creek far behind him.  Three days after this incident the trio at Jenkins Creek were aroused, while sitting at their mid-day meal, by the tinkle of sleigh-bells. Their sitting-room window was filled chiefly with parchment, but there was one square of it filled with glass.  Through this, as from a loop-hole, the inmates could reconnoitre any one who approached their hut.  \"Two dog-sleighs!\" exclaimed Ian, turning from the loop-hole with a look of surprise.  \"Flora and Elise!\" cried Kenneth and his father, in the same breath, as they started up eagerly and hastened to the door.  They were right.  Flora, jumping out of the furs of a vehicle which resembled a slipper-bath, and was drawn by four panting dogs, ran into the hut, exclaiming, \"Dear father,\" and threw her arms round the neck of the elder McLeod, who was not slow to return the embrace.  Elise entered with smiling face, and curtsied to the young men, who advanced and shook her heartily by the hand.  \"Hould their hids, Mister Kenneth,\" exclaimed the driver of the foremost sleigh, as he sought to undo the traces of the dogs.  \"Sure they're all alike--horses or dogs, they never _will_ lay still when they're wanted to; bad luck to 'em intirely.  Me heart is all but broke.  There--git along wid ye.\"  \"Don't be hard on them, Rooney,\" said Kenneth, laughing, \"they seem to have done good service.\"  \"True for ye,\" replied Rooney, \"it wouldn't have bin aisy to git the ladies down here widout 'em, the snow was so soft wi' the thaw that it nigh tore the snow-shoes off me feet, an' my poor legs is at laist three inches longer than whin I set out, if not four.\"  \"Well, Flo,\" said Ian, \"although I know you to be a resolute girl, I didn't believe you would undertake a journey over a country without a road at such a season of the year.\"  \"I _knew_ she would come,\" said her father, patting the girl's head tenderly, \"but didn't expect her quite so soon.\"  \"That's just the reason why I came,\" said Flora, bustling about the room in search of a reasonably clean spot, on which to deposit her fur cap and muff; \"I wanted to take you by surprise, you dear old duck.  Here, Elise, take these things and put them on a bed, or something of that sort, if there is one in the house.  I declare there is not a spot in this room that is not covered with smoke and grease.  How can you be so dirty?  It is high time that Elise and I came to put your house in order.  You needn't laugh, Kenneth, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.  This is dinner-time, I fancy.  Have you any to spare for us?  Let me see--but stay; first tell me how you have been and what you have done, and--\"  \"Please, Miss,\" said the maid, returning from a little side-room, \"there isn't a spot clean enough to put your things on.  The beds are no better than the chairs and tables.\"  \"Oh you dirty thing!\" said Flora, seating herself on her father's knee, and gazing remonstratively into his face.  A quiet smile played on the dark visage of the elder McLeod as he kissed her, and said:--  \"How could you expect us, Flo, to keep things very tidy in a place like this, where we've had to work hard with our axes every day and all day, and no woman to help us in domestic affairs?  Why, sometimes we've been so tired at the end of a day, that instead of cleaning up, we have tumbled into bed, boots and all!  But there _is_ one little corner of our otherwise dirty hut which we have reserved for lady-visitors.  See here!\"  He rose, unlocked a little door in a corner of the dining-hall, and throwing it open, disclosed to the astonished gaze of his visitors a small apartment which was a perfect marvel of cleanliness and propriety. True, it was a very simple and, what may be styled, a home-made apartment.  The walls, floor, and ceiling were of unpainted wood, but the wood was perfectly fresh, and smelt pleasantly of resin.  The window was preposterously small, with only four squares of glass in it, and it was curtained with mere calico, but the calico was rose-coloured, which imparted a delightfully warm glow to the room, and the view from the window of pine-woods and cliffs, and snow-fields, backed by the distant sea, was magnificent.  Two little beds in the corner furthest from the window looked so snug that the tendency of beholders to lie down and go to sleep forthwith was only overcome by a sensation of fear lest the fairies, to whom they unquestionably belonged, might object.  There was a rather clumsily-made chest of drawers in one corner, the workmanship of Kenneth; a book-shelf fashioned by Ian; and a table, with three chairs, made by McLeod senior.  \"Oh, how kind of you,\" said Flora to her father, when she afterwards sat with him alone in this boudoir, and looked round on everything with the deepest interest.  \"Well, it was natural that I should get ready a comfortable place for my only flower.\"  \"Your _only_ flower,\" exclaimed Flora, \"why, what do you call Ian, and Kenneth, and Roderick?\"  \"Not flowers, certainly,\" replied her father, pulling her down on his knee; \"they may be regarded as useful vegetables, if you will, but they are scarcely flowers that one likes to fondle.\"  \"There, now, sir, you have fondled me enough at present, so tell me all about yourself and your doings.\"  \"Tell me first, Flo, how it fared with you by the way.\"  \"Oh, that is soon told.  After you left me I remained with old Mrs Crowder in peaceful serenity until Rooney came back from Quebec, and then I consulted with him as to the possibility of getting down here before the close of winter.  Being an old nor'-wester, and an Irishman, he had his answer ready.  `Sure,' said he, `there's nothin' aisier.  The masther bade me go down to Jenkins Creek wi' the things as soon as possible, which or'narily mains faster than yer able, so I meant to be off to-morrow be daybreak on fut, wid a sled behind me.  But if your ladyship intinds to honour me wid yer company, this is how we cud do it. I'll hire a sleigh an' drive ye down to Sam Small's hut.  I know that Sam has got one or two sleds and teams of dogs, for, like myself, he's an owld nor'-wester, an' likes to revive owld memories by takin' a trip now an' then in the owld fashion.  There's no road av coorse, but dogs ain't like horses; they don't have no need of roads, so that don't matter.  I'll git owld Bogus, the Injin, to help.  He an' I can bate the tracks wid our snowshoes, and the dogs 'ill follow kindly, an' so we'll all go down to the creek together.'\"  \"Well,\" continued Flora, \"this plan was carried out at once.  We started next day and got on famously in the sledge.  We had only one upset.  It might have been an awkward one, for the horse was very restive when he got off the track into the deep snow, but fortunately, just at the time, up came two travellers, one of them _such_ a handsome man! and they got us out of our difficulty.\"  \"Were you in danger, my pet?\" asked"]]]
