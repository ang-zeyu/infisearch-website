What a hardened young villain he is!”  “Come, Silas, you must be crazy,” expostulated the constable, who felt very friendly to Chester. “Chester wouldn’t no more steal from you than I would.”  “I thought so myself, but when I found his handkerchief, marked with his name, on a flour barrel, I was convinced.”  “Is that so, Chester?”  “Yes, the handkerchief is mine.”  “It wasn’t here last night,” proceeded Silas, “and it was here this morning. It stands to reason that it couldn’t have walked here itself, and so of course it was brought here.”  By this time two other villagers entered the store.  “What do you say to that, Chester?” said the constable, beginning to be shaken in his conviction of Chester’s innocence.  “I agree with Mr. Tripp. It must have been brought here.”  At this moment, Mrs. Rand and the minister whom she had met on the way, entered the store.  “Glad to see you, widder,” said Silas Tripp, grimly. “I hope you ain’t a-goin’ to stand up for your son in his didoes.”  “I shall certainly stand by Chester, Mr. Tripp. What is the trouble?”  “Only that he came into my store in the silent watches of last night,” answered Silas, sarcastically, “and made off with thirty-seven dollars and sixty cents.”  “It’s a falsehood, whoever says it,” exclaimed Mrs. Rand, hotly.  “I supposed you’d stand up for him,” sneered Silas.  “And for a very good reason. During the silent watches of last night, as you express it, Chester was at home and in bed to my certain knowledge.”  “While his handkerchief walked over here and robbed the store,” suggested Silas Tripp, with withering sarcasm, as he held up the telltale evidence of Chester’s dishonesty.  “Was this handkerchief found in the store?” asked Mrs. Rand, in surprise.  “Yes, ma’am, it was, and I calculate you’ll find it hard to get over that evidence.”  Mrs. Rand’s face lighted up with a sudden conviction.  “I think I can explain it,” she said, quietly.  “Oh, you can, can you? Maybe you can tell who took the money.”  “I think I can.”  All eyes were turned upon her in eager expectation.  “A tramp called at our house last evening,” she said, “at about half-past nine, and I gave him a meal, as he professed to be hungry and penniless. It was some minutes after ten when he left the house. He must have picked up Chester’s handkerchief, and left it in your store after robbing the money drawer.”  “That’s all very fine,” said Silas, incredulously, “but I don’t know as there was any tramp. Nobody saw him but you.”  “I beg your pardon, Mr. Tripp,” said the minister, “but I saw him about half-past ten walking in the direction of your store. I was returning from visiting a sick parishioner when I met a man roughly dressed and of middle height, walking up the street. He was smoking a pipe.”  “He lighted it before leaving our house,” said Mrs. Rand.  “How did he know about my store?” demanded Silas, incredulously.  “He was asking questions about you while he was eating his supper.”  Silas Tripp was forced to confess, though reluctantly, that the case against Chester was falling to the ground. But he did not like to give up.  “I’d like to know where Chester got the money he’s been flauntin’ round the last week,” he said.  “Probably he stole it from your store last night,” said the constable, with good-natured sarcasm.  “That ain’t answerin’ the question.”  “I don’t propose to answer the question,” said Chester, firmly. “Where I got my money is no concern of Mr. Tripp, as long as I don’t get it from him.”  “Have I got to lose the money?” asked Silas, in a tragical tone. “It’s very hard on a poor man.”  All present smiled, for Silas was one of the richest men in the village.  “We might take up a contribution for you, Silas,” said the constable, jocosely.  “Oh, it’s all very well for you to joke about it, considerin’ you didn’t lose it.”  At this moment Abel Wood, who had been sweeping the piazza, entered the store in excitement.  “I say, there’s the tramp now,” he exclaimed.  “Where? Where?” asked one and another.  “Out in the street. Constable Perkins has got him.”  “Call him in,” said the minister.  A moment later, Constable Perkins came in, escorting the tramp, who was evidently under the influence of strong potations, and had difficulty in holding himself up.  “Where am I?” hiccoughed Ramsay.  “Where did you find him, Mr. Perkins?” asked Rev. Mr. Morris.  “Just outside of Farmer Dexter’s barn. He was lying on the ground, with a jug of whisky at his side.”  “It was my jug,” said Silas. “He must have taken it from the store. I didn’t miss it before. He must have took it away with him.”  “There warn’t much whisky left in the jug. He must have absorbed most of it.”  Now Mr. Tripp’s indignation was turned against this new individual.  “Where is my money, you villain?” he demanded, hotly.  “Whaz-zer matter?” hiccoughed Ramsay.  “You came into my store last night and stole some money.”  “Is zis zer store? It was jolly fun,” and the inebriate laughed.  “Yes, it is. Where is the money you took?”  “Spent it for whisky.”  “No, you didn’t. You found the whisky here.”  Ramsay made no reply.  “He must have the money about him,” suggested the minister. “You’d better search his pockets, Mr. Perkins.”  The constable thrust his hand into the pocket of his helpless charge, and drew out a roll of bills.  Silas Tripp uttered an exclamation of joy.  “Give it to me,” he said. “It’s my money.”  The bills were counted and all were there.  Not one was missing. Part of the silver could not be found. It had probably slipped from his pocket, for he had no opportunity of spending any.  Mr. Tripp was so pleased to recover his bills that he neglected to complain of the silver coins that were missing. But still he felt incensed against the thief.  “You’ll suffer for this,” he said, sternly, eying the tramp over his glasses.  “Who says I will?”  “I say so. You’ll have to go to jail.”  “I’m a ’spectable man,” hiccoughed the tramp. “I’m an honest man. I ain’t done nothin’.”  “Why did you take my handkerchief last night?” asked Chester.  The tramp laughed.  “Good joke, wasn’t it? So they’d think it was you.”  “It came near being a bad joke for me. Do you think I robbed your store now, Mr. Tripp?”  To this question Silas Tripp did not find it convenient to make an answer. He was one of those men—very numerous they are, too—who dislike to own themselves mistaken.  “It seems to me, Mr. Tripp,” said the minister, “that you owe an apology to our young friend here for your false suspicions.”  “Anybody’d suspect him when they found his handkerchief,” growled Silas.  “But now you know he was not concerned in the robbery you should make reparation.”  “I don’t know where he got his money,” said Silas. “There’s suthin’ very mysterious about that five-dollar bill.”  “I’ve got another, Mr. Tripp,” said Chester, smiling.  “Like as not. Where’d you get it?”  “I don’t feel obliged to tell.”  “It looks bad, that’s all I’ve got to say,” said the storekeeper.  “I think, Mr. Tripp, you need not borrow any trouble on that score,” interposed the minister. “I know where Chester’s money comes from, and I can assure you that it is honestly earned, more so than that which you receive from the whisky you sell.”  Silas Tripp was a little afraid of the minister, who was very plain-spoken, and turned away muttering.  The crowd dispersed, some following Constable Perkins, who took his prisoner to the lockup.     CHAPTER IX.  NEW PLANS FOR CHESTER.   Two days later Chester found another letter from Mr. Conrad at the post office. In it were two bills—a ten and a five.  Mr. Conrad wrote:      “I have disposed of your two sketches to the same paper. The     publisher offered me fifteen dollars for the two, and I thought it     best to accept. Have you ever thought of coming to New York to     live? You would be more favorably placed for disposing of your     sketches, and would find more subjects in a large city than in a     small village. The fear is that, if you continue to live in     Wyncombe, you will exhaust your invention.      “There is one objection, the precarious nature of the business. You     might sometimes go a month, perhaps, without selling a sketch, and     meanwhile your expenses would go on. I think, however, that I have     found a way of obviating this objection. I have a friend—Mr.     Bushnell—who is in the real estate business, and he will take you     into his office on my recommendation. He will pay you five dollars     a week if he finds you satisfactory. This will afford you a steady     income, which you can supplement by your art work. If you decide to     accept my suggestion come to New York next Saturday, and you can     stay with me over Sunday, and go to work on Monday morning.      “Your sincere friend,      “HERBERT CONRAD.”  Chester read this letter in a tumult of excitement. The great city had always had a fascination for him, and he had hoped, without much expectation of the hope being realized, that he might one day find employment there. Now the opportunity had come, but could he accept it? The question arose, How would his mother get along in his absence? She would be almost entirely without income. Could he send her enough from the city to help her along?  He went to his mother and showed her the letter.  “Fifteen dollars!” she exclaimed. “Why, that is fine, Chester. I shall begin to be proud of you. Indeed, I am proud of you now.”  “I can hardly realize it myself, mother. I won’t get too much elated, for it may not last. What do you think of Mr. Conrad’s proposal?”  “To go to New York?”  “Yes.”  Mrs. Rand’s countenance fell.  “I don’t see how I can spare you, Chester,” she said, soberly.  “If there were any chance of making a living in Wyncombe, it would be different.”  “You might go back to Mr. Tripp’s store.”  “After he had charged me with stealing? No, mother, I will never serve Silas Tripp again.”  “There might be some other chance.”  “But there isn’t, mother. By the way, I heard at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23108"],["title","Chester Rand; or, The New Path to Fortune (#7)"],["body","office that the shoe manufactory will open again in three weeks.”  “That’s good news. I shall have some more binding to do.”  “And I can send you something every week from New York.”  “But I will be so lonely, Chester, with no one else in the house.”  “That is true, mother.”  “But I won’t let that stand in the way. You may have prospects in New York. You have none here.”  “And, as Mr. Conrad says, I am likely to run out of subjects for sketches.”  “I think I shall have to give my consent, then.”  “Thank you, mother,” said Chester, joyfully. “I will do what I can to pay you for the sacrifice you are making.”  Just then the doorbell rang.  “It is Mr. Gardener, the lawyer,” said Chester, looking from the window.  A moment later he admitted the lawyer.  “Well, Chester,” said Mr. Gardener, pleasantly, “have you disposed of your lots in Tacoma yet?”  “No, Mr. Gardener. In fact, I had almost forgotten about them.”  “Sometime they may prove valuable.”  “I wish it might be soon.”  “I fancy you will have to wait a few years. By the time you are twenty-one you may come into a competence.”  “I won’t think of it till then.”  “That’s right. Work as if you had nothing to look forward to.”  “You don’t want to take me into your office and make a lawyer of me, Mr. Gardener, do you?”  “Law in Wyncombe does not offer any inducements. If I depended on my law business, I should fare poorly, but thanks to a frugal and industrious father, I have a fair income outside of my earnings. Mrs. Rand, my visit this morning is to you. How would you like to take a boarder?”  Chester and his mother looked surprised.  “Who is it, Mr. Gardener?”  “I have a cousin, a lady of forty, who thinks of settling down in Wyncombe. She thinks country air will be more favorable to her health than the city.”  “Probably she is used to better accommodations than she would find here.”  “My cousin will be satisfied with a modest home.”  “We have but two chambers, mine and Chester’s.”  “But you know, mother, I am going to New York to work.”  “That’s true; your room will be vacant.”  Mr. Gardener looked surprised.  “Isn’t this something new,” he asked, “about you going to New York, I mean?”  “Yes, sir; that letter from Mr. Conrad will explain all.”  Mr. Gardener read the letter attentively.  “I think the plan a good one,” he said. “You will find that you will work better in a great city. Then, if my cousin comes, your mother will not be so lonesome.”  “It is the very thing,” said Chester, enthusiastically.  “What is your cousin’s name, Mr. Gardener?” asked the widow.  “Miss Jane Dolby. She is a spinster, and at her age there is not much chance of her changing her condition. Shall I write her that you will receive her?”  “Yes; I shall be glad to do so.”  “And, as Miss Dolby is a business woman, she will expect me to tell her your terms.”  “Will four dollars a week be too much?” asked Mrs. Rand, in a tone of hesitation.  “Four dollars, my dear madam!”  “Do you consider it too much? I am afraid I could not afford to say less.”  “I consider it too little. My cousin is a woman of means. I will tell her your terms are eight dollars a week including washing.”  “But will she be willing to pay so much?”  “She pays twelve dollars a week in the city, and could afford to pay more. She is not mean, but is always willing to pay a good price.”  “I can manage very comfortably on that sum,” said Mrs. Rand, brightening up. “I hope I shall be able to make your cousin comfortable.”  “I am sure of it. Miss Dolby is a very sociable lady, and if you are willing to hear her talk she will be content.”  “She will keep me from feeling lonesome.”  When Mr. Gardener left the house, Chester said: “All things seem to be working in aid of my plans, mother, I feel much more comfortable now that you will have company.”  “Besides, Chester, you will not need to send me any money. The money Miss Dolby pays me will be sufficient to defray the expenses of the table, and I shall still have some time for binding shoes.”  “Then I hope I may be able to save some money.”  During the afternoon Chester went to the store to buy groceries. Mr. Tripp himself filled the order. He seemed disposed to be friendly.  “Your money holds out well, Chester,” he said, as he made change for a two-dollar bill.  “Yes, Mr. Tripp.”  “I can’t understand it, for my part. Your mother must be a good manager.”  “Yes, Mr. Tripp, she is.”  “You’d orter come back to work for me, Chester.”  “But you have got a boy already.”  “The Wood boy ain’t worth shucks. He ain’t got no push, and he’s allus forgettin’ his errands. If you’ll come next Monday I’ll pay you two dollars and a half a week. That’s pooty good for these times.”  “I’m sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Tripp, but I am going to work somewhere else.”  “Where?” asked Silas, in great surprise.  “In New York,” answered Chester, proudly.  “You don’t say! How’d you get it?”  “Mr. Conrad, an artist, a friend of the minister, got it for me.”  “Is your mother willin’ to have you go?”  “She will miss me, but she thinks it will be for my advantage.”  “How’s she goin’ to live? It will take all you can earn to pay your own way in a big city. In fact, I don’t believe you can do it.”  “I’ll try, Mr. Tripp.”  Chester did not care to mention the new boarder that was expected, as he thought it probable that Mr. Tripp, who always looked out for his own interests, would try to induce Miss Dolby to board with him. As Mr. Tripp had the reputation of keeping a very poor table, he had never succeeded in retaining a boarder over four weeks.  Chester found that his clothing needed replenishing, and ventured to spend five dollars for small articles, such as handkerchiefs, socks, etc. Saturday morning he walked to the depot with a small gripsack in his hand and bought a ticket for New York.     CHAPTER X.  A RAILROAD ACQUAINTANCE.   The distance by rail from Wyncombe to New York is fifty miles. When about eight years of age Chester had made the journey, but not since then. Everything was new to him, and, of course, interesting. His attention was drawn from the scenery by the passage of a train boy through the cars with a bundle of new magazines and papers.  “Here is all the magazines, _Puck_ and _Judge_.”  “How much do you charge for _Puck_?” asked Chester, with interest, for it was _Puck_ that had accepted his first sketch.  “Ten cents.”  “Give me one.”  Chester took the paper and handed the train boy a dime.  Then he began to look over the pages. All at once he gave a start, his face flushed, his heart beat with excitement. There was his sketch looking much more attractive on the fair pages of the periodical than it had done in his pencil drawing. He kept looking at it. It seemed to have a fascination for him. It was his first appearance in a paper, and it was a proud moment for him.  “What are you looking at so intently, my son?” asked the gentleman who sat at his side. He was a man of perhaps middle age, and he wore spectacles, which gave him a literary aspect.  “I—I am looking at this sketch,” answered Chester, in slight confusion.  “Let me see it.”  Chester handed over the paper and regarded his seat mate with some anxiety. He wanted to see what impression this, his maiden effort, would have on a staid man of middle age.  “Ha! very good!” said his companion, “but I don’t see anything very remarkable about it. Yet you were looking at it for as much as five minutes.”  “Because it is mine,” said Chester, half proudly, half in embarrassment.  “Ah! that is different. Did you really design it?”  “Yes, sir.”  “I suppose you got pay for it. I understand _Puck_ pays for everything it publishes.”  “Yes, sir; I got ten dollars.”  “Ten dollars!” repeated the gentleman, in surprise. “Really that is very handsome. Do you often produce such sketches?”  “I have just begun, sir. That is the first I have had published.”  “You are beginning young. How old are you?”  “I am almost sixteen.”  “That is young for an artist. Why, I am forty-five, and I haven’t a particle of talent in that direction. My youngest son asked me the other day to draw a cow on the slate. I did as well as I could, and what do you think he said?”  “What did he say?” asked Chester, interested.  “He said, ‘Papa, if it wasn’t for the horns I should think it was a horse.’”  Chester laughed. It was a joke he could appreciate.  “I suppose all cannot draw,” he said.  “It seems not. May I ask you if you live in New York—the city, I mean?”  “No, sir.”  “But you are going there?”  “Yes, sir.”  “To live?”  “I hope so. A friend has written advising me to come. He says I will be better placed to do art work, and dispose of my sketches.”  “Are you expecting to earn your living that way?”  “I hope to some time, but not at first.”  “I am glad to hear it. I should think you would find it very precarious.”  “I expect to work in a real estate office at five dollars a week, and only to spend my leisure hours in art work.”  “That seems sensible. Have you been living in the country?”  “Yes, sir, in Wyncombe.”  “I have heard of the place, but was never there. So you are just beginning the battle of life?”  “Yes, sir.”  “It has just occurred to me that I may be able to throw some work in your way. I am writing an ethnological work, and it will need to be illustrated. I can’t afford to pay such prices as you receive from _Puck_ and other periodicals of the same class, but then the work will not be original. It will consist chiefly of copies. I should think I might need a hundred illustrations, and I am afraid I could not pay more than two dollars each.”  A hundred illustrations at two dollars each! Why, that would amount to two hundred dollars, and there would be no racking his brains for original ideas.  “If you think I can do the work, sir, I shall be glad to undertake it,” said Chester, eagerly.  “I have no doubt you can do it, for it will not require an expert. Suppose you call upon me some evening within a week.”  “I will do so gladly, sir, if you will tell me where"]]]
