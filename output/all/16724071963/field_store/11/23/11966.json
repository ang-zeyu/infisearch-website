Supper soon followed, and before the meal was over the rain had stopped. After supper several of B Company's men went out into the near-by street to stroll in the somewhat cooler air of the tropical evening.  A little later Hal and Noll followed. Presently, in the shadow under a densely foliaged yllang-yllang tree, they came upon two figures standing there, just in time to hear Corporal Hyman's voice saying heartily:  \"That sounds like just as good a time as you make it out to be. And it won't take us over three hours? This is a hard night to get off, as the packing-up order has been given. I'll see our first sergeant, however, and find out whether there's any chance of my getting leave for the evening. If he says so, I can put it by the captain all right. Wait here, and----\"  \"I guess it won't be necessary, Corporal Hyman,\" broke in Hal's voice, sounding rather cool, for Hal had recognized Hyman's companion--none other than Vicente Tomba.  \"Hello! There you are, Sarge,\" cried Hyman, while the little Filipino dandy started, peered at the young sergeants and then scowled.  \"I'll try to fix it for you to get a pass to-night, Corporal,\" Hal went on, \"if you really want one. But I don't exactly believe that you do. This native gentleman tried to butt in with us this afternoon, and at first we took it in good part. But he was too eager. Then, a little later in the afternoon, we heard him denouncing us to a white man because we weren't eager enough. Corporal, unless you know a lot about this man, I don't believe you want anything to do with him.\"  Tomba's face was blazing hotly, while his eyes gleamed angrily at Sergeant Overton's words.  \"If that's the kind of fellow he is, then I don't want a pass to-night,\" Hyman replied. \"This little man has just been telling me how much he loves American _soldados_, and he proposed to get a _quilez_ and take me over into the city for the time of my life.\"  \"From what happened this afternoon I'm a little shaky on Se√±or Tomba,\" Hal continued.  \"You never saw me before!\" cried Tomba, wheeling about on Hal. \"Liar! Thief!\"  Hal's reply was prompt, sufficient, military. He delivered a short-arm, right-hand blow that struck the native in the neck, felling him to the sidewalk.  But Tomba was up in an instant, and a knife flashed in his hands.  Hal did not flinch. He leaped upon the little brown man, getting a clinch that held the rascal powerless. Then Noll coolly took away the knife, striking the blade into the tree trunk and snapping the steel in two.  \"Shall I call the guard, Sergeant, to take this little brown rat?\" demanded Corporal Hyman.  \"No; he isn't big enough, or man enough to bother the guard with,\" replied young Sergeant Overton. \"I'll take care of him myself.\"  Whirling the Filipino around, Hal gave him a vigorous start, emphasized by a kick, and Vicente Tomba slid off into the darkness.  Malay blood is not forgiving. There were other reasons, too, why it would have been far better had Sergeant Hal turned Tomba over to the guard.     CHAPTER III  PLOTTERS TRAVEL WITH THE FLAG   From the deck of the \"Warren\" only distant glimpses of land, on the horizon line, were visible.  The sea to-day was without a ripple, yet, as it was not raining, the sun beat down with a heat that would have wilted most of the passengers, had it not been for the awnings stretched over every deck.  Up on the saloon deck was a mixture of the field uniforms of Army officers, the white duck or cotton of male civilian passengers, and the white dresses of the women. Most of the married officers of the Thirty-fourth had brought their families along with them, and so children played along the saloon deck, or ran down among the friendly soldiers on the spar deck. Here and there, among the women, was a Yankee schoolma'am, going to some new charge in the islands.  A number of the male cabin passengers were not Army people. Some belonged to the postals service, the islands civil service, or were planters or merchants of wealth and influence in the islands, who had been permitted to take passage on the troop ship.  Between decks the enlisted men of \"Ours\" were quartered and berthed by companies. Each enlisted man, by way of a bed, had a bunk whose frame was of gas pipe, to which frame was swung the canvas berth. These berths were in tiers, three high.  Away forward, in special quarters by themselves, as a sort of steerage passengers, were some two score natives of the islands who were making the journey for one reason or another. These natives, however, kept to themselves, and the soldiers saw little of them.  Altogether, the \"Warren\" carried something more than fourteen hundred passengers, which meant that quarters were at least sufficiently crowded. Yet the soldiers, with the cheerful good nature of their kind, took this crowded condition as one of the incidents of the life.  Noll was up on deck enjoying himself; Hal, as acting first sergeant, was otherwise occupied during the greater part of the forenoon. At the head of B Company's quarters, two decks below, young Overton sat at a little table, busily working over a set of papers that he had to make up. This \"paper work\" is one of the banes of first sergeants and of company commanders.  It was after eleven o'clock when Sergeant Hal finished his last sheet. The papers he folded neatly and thrust them into a long, official envelope, which he endorsed and blotted. Rising, he thrust the envelope into the breast of his blouse and started for the nearest companionway.  \"I'm glad, old fellow, that you are the acting first sergeant,\" grinned comfortable Noll Terry, as his chum came upon deck with forehead, face and neck beaded with perspiration.  \"Oh, it doesn't hurt a fellow to have a little work to do,\" replied Overton, smiling. \"You see, you've just been loafing this morning, almost ever since inspection, while I have a consciousness of work well performed.\"  \"Keep your consciousness and enjoy it,\" retorted Noll, as the two boyish sergeants stepped along the deck.  \"I wonder if Captain Cortland is on deck at this moment?\" remarked Sergeant Hal.  \"I saw him five minutes ago,\" Noll answered.  Almost at that moment B Company's commander came to the forward rail of the saloon deck and looked down. Then his glance rested on Hal.   \"Are the papers ready, Sergeant?\" the captain called down.  \"Yes, sir; I have them with me,\" replied Hal. Pressing through the throng of soldiers, he ascended the steps to the saloon deck, saluting and passing over the envelope.  \"Thank you, Sergeant.\"  \"I think you'll find them all right, sir. I'm somewhat new at the work, but I've taken a lot of pains.\"  \"There's always a lot of pains taken with any work that you do, Sergeant.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  Hal saluted and was about to turn away when he heard a voice saying:  \"What we need, in dealing with the Moros in these southern islands, is to show them that----\"  Just then the speaker happened to turn, and stopped talking for a moment.  The voice was new, but Sergeant Overton started at sight of the speaker's face.  \"Why, that's the same big, florid-faced fellow that I saw in the shed with Tomba, that time it rained so hard,\" flashed through the young sergeant's astonished mind. \"What can he be doing here--a cabin passenger on a United States troop ship?\"  Unconsciously Hal was staring hard at the stranger. It appeared to annoy the florid-faced man.  \"Well, my man,\" he cried impatiently, looking keenly at Hal, \"are you waiting to say something to me?\"  \"No, sir,\" Sergeant Hal replied quickly.  \"Perhaps you thought you knew me?\"  \"No, sir; I merely remembered having once seen you.\"  \"You've seen me before? Then your memory is better than mine, Sergeant. Where have you ever seen me before?\"  \"The other afternoon, sir, on the south side of the Pasig River at Manila. You were in a shed, out of the rain, with a native calling himself Vicente Tomba.\"  The florid-faced man betrayed neither uneasiness nor resentment. Instead, he smiled pleasantly as he replied:  \"I thought you were in error, Sergeant, and now I'm certain of it, for I don't know any Vicente Tomba.\"  \"Then I beg your pardon for the mistake, sir,\" Hal replied quickly.  \"No need to apologize, Sergeant, for you have done no harm,\" replied the florid-faced man.  Here Captain Cortland's voice broke in, cool and steady:  \"Yet I know, Mr. Draney, that Sergeant Overton feels embarrassed by the mere fact of his having made a mistake. Sergeant Overton is one of our best and most capable soldiers, and he rarely makes a mistake of any kind.\"  \"I'm glad to hear that he's one of your best soldiers,\" replied Draney pleasantly. \"It seems odd, doesn't it, Captain, to see so boyish a chap wearing sergeant's chevrons?\"  \"Sergeant Overton, Mr. Draney, is more than merely a sergeant. He is acting first sergeant of B Company, and is likely to continue as such for some months to come.\"  \"He has risen so high?\" cried Draney. \"I certainly congratulate the young man.\"  There appeared to be no further call for Hal to remain on the saloon deck. After flashing an inquiring look at his company commander, and saluting that officer, Hal next raised his uniform cap to Draney, then turned and made his way down to the spar deck.  \"Your sergeant looks like a very upright young man, Captain,\" observed Mr. Draney.  \"Overton?\" rejoined Captain Cortland. \"I am certain that he is the soul of honor.\"  \"His loyalty has often been tested, I presume?\" persisted the florid-faced fellow.  \"He's a very thoroughly trustworthy young man, if that's what you mean.\"  Captain Cortland was beginning to feel somewhat annoyed, for, truth to tell, he did not like Draney very well.  \"Is your sergeant,\" asked Draney, \"a young man much interested in the joys of life, or is he of the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23447"],["title","Uncle Sam's Boys in the Philippines; or, Following the Flag against the Moros (#5)"],["body","quiet, studious sort who seldom care for good times?\"  \"You seem to be uncommonly interested in Sergeant Overton, Mr. Draney,\" remarked the captain almost testily.  \"Only as a type of American soldier,\" replied Draney blandly. \"I was wondering if my estimate of the young man were borne out by your experience with him.\"  \"Sergeant Overton is fond of the joys of life, if you mean the quiet and decent pleasures. He is a good deal of a student, and that type is never interested in drinking or gambling, or any of the vices and dissipations, if that is what you mean.\"  Then, noting that Colonel North had just stepped out on deck from his stateroom, Captain Cortland added hastily:  \"Pardon me; I wish to speak with the commanding officer.\"  As colonel and captain met they exchanged salutes.  \"I told Draney, sir, that I wished to speak with you,\" Captain Cortland reported, in a low voice. \"I did not tell him, however, that I wished to speak with you mainly as a pretext for getting away from his society.\"  \"You don't like Draney?\" smiled Colonel North, eying his captain shrewdly.  \"I certainly do not,\" Cortland confessed.  \"And I'm almost as certain that I don't, either,\" replied the regimental commander. \"However, Cortland, we shall have to treat him with a fair amount of courtesy, for Draney is an influential man down in the part of the world for which we are headed. He is influential with the Moros, I mean. Often he is in a position to give the military authorities useful information of intended native mischief. Draney is a very big planter, you know, and white planters are somewhat scarce in the Moro country. It is one of the great disappointments of our government that more American capital is not invested in establishing great plantations in the extremely rich Moro country. But, as you know, Cortland, some of the Moro dattos are given to heading sudden, unexpected and very desperate raids on white planters, and that fact has discouraged Americans, Englishmen and Germans from investing millions and millions of capital in the Moro country.\"  \"Yet the fellow Draney is a planter there, sir?\"  \"Draney owns half a dozen very successful plantations.\"  \"And is he never molested by the Moros, sir?\" inquired Captain Cortland.  \"Never enough to discourage him in his investments. Rather odd, isn't it, Cortland?\"  \"Very odd, indeed, sir,\" replied Captain Cortland dryly.  That same afternoon Captain Cortland, after finishing a promenade on the saloon deck, went forward, descending to the spar deck. There, under the awning, he came upon Sergeants Hal and Noll, who saluted as he addressed them.  \"Sergeant Overton,\" began the captain in a low tone, \"you seemed, this forenoon, to feel a good deal of surprise at seeing Mr. Draney on board.\"  \"I was surprised, sir.\"  \"Tell me what you know about the man.\"  Sergeant Hal briefly related the adventure that he and Noll had had with Vicente Tomba on the Escolta, and their subsequent meeting with Tomba and Draney on the south side of the Pasig. Hal also repeated what they had overheard Tomba saying to Draney. Hal then described the flight of the pair in the _quilez_.  \"Yet Draney declares that he never heard of Tomba,\" said the captain musingly. \"Sergeant Overton, do you think it possible that you have mistaken Mr. Draney for someone else?\"  \"It may be, of course, sir,\" Hal admitted. \"But I hardly believe it possible. Besides, I have pointed out Mr. Draney to Sergeant Terry and he also is positive that it is the same man.\"  At that moment all three turned to look forward. There was some sort of commotion going on there. It proved, however, to be nothing but the herding of the Filipino passengers on deck near the bow, while one of the regiment's officers was inspecting their quarters below.  The three officers returned to their conversation, but presently Hal murmured:  \"Don't look immediately, Noll, but presently take a passing glance at the Filipino standing away up in the bow. Tell Captain Cortland who the fellow is.\"  \"It's Vicente Tomba, although I'd hardly know him in that costume of the _peon_ (laborer),\" Noll answered.  \"You are both certain that the man is Tomba?\" inquired Captain Cortland keenly.  \"Yes, sir,\" both young sergeants declared, and Hal added:  \"There's Corporal Hyman up forward, sir. If you'll go up and speak to the corporal, and allow us to accompany you, sir, you can see whether Hyman knows the fellow. He, too, was approached by Tomba, at the nipa barracks.\"  Accordingly the test was made.  \"Why, certainly, the fellow is Tomba,\" replied Hyman, \"though he looks a lot different, sir, from the dandy who was talking to me last Tuesday night.\"  Captain Cortland asked all three of the non-commissioned officers some further questions as they stood there. None of the quartette discovered the fact that, close to them, crouching under the canvas cover of a life boat as it swung at davits, lay one of the keen-eyed Filipino passengers. This swarthy little fellow was only about half versed in English, but he understood enough of the talk to realize what was in the wind.  In some mysterious manner what this swarthy little spy overheard traveled, less than an hour later, to Mr. Draney, planter, and that gentleman, as he sat in his stateroom and thought it all over, was greatly disturbed.  Still later that afternoon--not long before sundown--while the \"Warren\" was still ploughing her way through the sea, the little brown spy drew Vicente Tomba to one side in the native steerage.  To make assurance doubly sure, both Filipinos spoke in their own Malay dialect, the Tagalos.  \"Tomba!\"  \"Luis?\"  \"Tomba, the Se√±or Draney is greatly disturbed. Sergeant Overton and Sergeant Terry have recognized him as one whom they saw with you in Manila.\"  \"Bah! That amounts to little. Se√±or Draney can deny.\"  \"But they have recognized you also, my Tomba, and so has Corporal Hyman. More, they have told Captain Cortland all they know, and all they can guess.\"  \"The dogs!\" growled Vicente Tomba, his snarl showing his fine, white teeth.  \"You do well to call them dogs,\" grinned Luis. \"Se√±or Draney bids me to remind you what becomes of dogs that are troublesome. You have others here with you who can help. At the first chance, then, Overton, Terry and Hyman are to bite the bone that kills--and Captain Cortland, too, if you can manage it!\"     CHAPTER IV  CERVERRA'S INNOCENT SHOP   \"D'ye know what I'm thinking about?\" demanded Private Kelly, as he turned to look out southward from Fort Benjamin Franklin.  \"Not being a mind reader--no,\" replied Hal.  \"I'm thinking this country is a fine place to dream about.\"  \"It's worth it,\" declared Sergeant Overton, with unsullied boyish enthusiasm.  \"Worth it--huh!\" retorted Kelly, who had served longer in the Army. \"Mind ye, I said this was a good country to dream about. But to live in--give me 'God's country.'\"  The United States soldier on foreign service, invariably alludes to home in this way.  Send him to the fairest spot on which the human eye ever rested, and the soldier will still longingly speak of home as \"God's country.\"  \"Then I'll be polite,\" retorted Sergeant Hal, \"and say that I wish, Kelly, that you could be at home. But as for me, I'm glad I'm here.\"  \"Wait until you are in your third enlistment, and have put in another two years in the islands, after this time,\" growled Kelly.  \"Why, where can you find a more beautiful spot than this?\" demanded Hal Overton, gazing across the fields toward the town of Bantoc. \"I never saw a more beautiful spot. I wonder if there are many like it in the tropics?\"  \"Beautiful?\" rumbled Kelly. \"Sure! But ye can't eat beauty. 'Tis a long way from anywhere, this spot, and that's what I've got against it.\"  \"Grumbling again, Kelly?\" asked Sergeant Noll Terry, joining them.  \"Not grumbling,\" retorted Kelly. \"Just giving my opinion. But this boy sergeant is trying to make me think this swamp on northern Mindanao is an earthly paradise.\"  \"Well, isn't it?\" challenged Noll. \"I know what ails you, Kelly. When all is peace and comfort, with three 'squares' a day, and not a heap to do, your old soldier is always kicking. But just send you and the rest, Kelly, hiking up through those mountains yonder, give you twenty miles a day of rough climbing, drown you out with rain and let you use up your shoes chasing a lot of ugly brown men, and never a kick will we hear coming from you.\"  \"Sure, no,\" replied Kelly philosophically. \"'Tis then we'd be doing a soldier's work, and a kicker on a hike is as useless as a coffee-cooler at an afternoon tea.\"  \"In other words,\" laughed Hal, \"a real soldier of the Regular Army is as patient as a camel when things are all going wrong. The only time when your real soldier kicks is when he's having it easy and is too comfortable to be patient. Curious, isn't it?\"  \"Oh, well, 'tis no use talking to you two,\" retorted Private Kelly, shaking his head and strolling away. \"Ye've not seen much of service yet.\"  \"That's another joke,\" laughed Hal in a low voice, as soon as Kelly had stepped out of hearing. \"Here's a man like Kelly, with fairly long service to his credit, but he's a private still, and probably always will be. If the colonel made him a corporal, Kelly wouldn't rest until he had the chevrons taken from his sleeve so that he could be a private soldier again. Now you and I, Noll, work like blazes all the time, and win our promotion, yet Kelly considers us only boys, and boys who don't know much, either. Either one of us can take Kelly out in a squad and work him until he runs rivers of perspiration, and he can't talk back without danger of being disciplined. Yet all the time, Kelly, under our orders, is thinking of us, half contemptuously, as boys who don't really know anything about soldiering.\"  \"That's because we're young,\" laughed Noll.  \"And because we're also boyish enough to have a little enthusiasm left in our make-ups. Noll, how do you really like our new station?\"  \"I wouldn't be anywhere"]]]
