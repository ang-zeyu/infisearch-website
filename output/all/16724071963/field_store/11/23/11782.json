It was evident from the appearance of the large chamber that its inhabitants were associated in groups or families, spaces being marked off by an arrangement of logs and household goods, etcetera, as if to indicate the habitation of each group, and, from certain indications in the smaller chambers, it was equally evident that these had been apportioned as the sleeping-places of the females.  A larger space at the end of the cave, opposite to that on which Mark and his comrades reclined, seemed to be a general meeting-place.  To this spot it was that Ravonino went, leading his little sister Ra-Ruth by the hand, and followed by all the inmates of the place, who were eager to know what news he had brought.  That the news was the reverse of good soon became evident, from the bowed heads and frequent sighs with which it was received.  Of course our travellers could make no use of their ears, but they made the best use of their eyes, and were deeply interested in the expressions and actions of the various members of the group who successively spoke after the guide had told his story.  Poor little Ra-Ruth, whose age might have been about seventeen, was not one of the speakers.  She was evidently a timid as well as a pretty little creature, for she clung to and nestled against her stout brother's arm while he was speaking, and hid her face now and then in the masses of her luxuriant brown hair.  Close to her sat a young woman whose appearance and manner formed a striking contrast.  She was much darker in complexion, but her features were of classical beauty and her air calm and self-possessed.  When she had occasion to speak, she arose, displaying a tall elegantly-formed figure, which moved with queen-like dignity while she gesticulated with graceful animation, and frequently pointed upwards as if appealing to. God.  When she was speaking Ra-Ruth's timidity seemed to vanish, for she shook back her hair, and fixed her eyes on the other's face with a gaze that told of ardent love as well as admiration.  The next who spoke was a young man, who in face and figure so strongly resembled the last speaker, that it was impossible to resist the conclusion that they were brother and sister.  There was the same tall commanding figure, of course on a larger scale, the same noble cast of feature and the same dignified mien.  But in the man, more than in the woman, there was an air of gentle modesty which contrasted well with his powerful frame.  He did not gesticulate much in speaking, and, judging from the brevity of his speech, he had not much to say, but what he said was listened to with profound respect by all.  After this youth, several others took part in the debate.  Then they all stood up, and, to the surprise of their visitors, began to sing--very sweetly--an old familiar hymn!  \"It minds me o' home,\" whispered Hockins, scarce able to restrain the tears that filled his eyes.  The hymn was nearly finished, when a rushing sound and a subdued cry were heard to issue from a dark passage, the mouth of which was close to the couch of our travellers.  The singing ceased instantly.  Next moment a man rushed into the chamber with labouring breath and flashing eyes. Springing towards Ravonino, he spoke several words eagerly, at the same time pointing in the direction of the passage just referred to.  \"Lights out and silence!\" cried the guide, authoritatively, in the native tongue.  Another moment and the cave was in total darkness, and a silence so profound reigned there that the three visitors could hardly persuade themselves the whole affair was not a strange dream.  The voice of Ravonino, however, soon dispelled that idea.  \"Be still!\" whispered the guide, laying his hand on Mark's shoulder. \"Our foes have discovered our retreat.\"  \"There's a lot of stout fellows here,\" returned Mark, also in a whisper. \"We will help you if you have to fight.\"  \"We may not fight,\" replied Ravonino softly.  \"If it be God's will, we must die.  Hush!  They come.\"  Once more total silence prevailed in the cavern, and the sound of distant voices could be heard.  In a few minutes a tiny light was seen at the end of the dark passage.  It gradually increased in size, revealing a soldier who bore a torch.  He advanced on tip-toe, and with slightly scared looks, into an outer cavern which formed a sort of vestibule to the large inner cave.  The soldier was brave, no doubt, and would have faced an army in the field, but he was extremely superstitious, and advanced with a palpitating heart, the torch held high above his head, and eyes glancing nervously from side to side.  A crowd of comrades, similarly affected more or less, followed the torch-bearer and pushed him on.  \"Nothing here,\" said the leading man, of course in Malagasy.  \"Let us be gone, then,\" said one of his comrades.  \"No,\" observed a third, who seemed bolder than the rest, \"perhaps there is another cave beyond,\" (pointing to the dark passage, through which, though unseen, Mark and his companions with the guide were gazing anxiously at their foes).  \"Give me the torch.\"  The soldier seized the light and advanced quickly towards the opening. Another minute and all must have been revealed.  A feeling of despair took possession of Ravonino's breast and he gave vent to an involuntary sigh.  The sound reached the ear of the soldier with the torch and for a moment arrested him, but, thinking probably that the sound was in his imagination, he again advanced.  The case was now desperate.  Just then a gleam of light flashed into the mind of Hockins.  Next moment, to the consternation of his comrades and the guide, a strain of the sweetest music floated softly in the air!  The soldiers stood still--spell-bound.  It was not an unfamiliar air, for they had often heard the hated Christians sing it, but the sweet, liquid--we might almost say tiny--tones in which it was conveyed, were such as had never before reached their ears or even entered their imaginations.  It was evident from their countenances that the soldiers were awe-stricken.  The seaman noted this.  He played only a few bars, and allowed the last notes of his flageolet to grow faint until they died away into absolute silence.  For a minute or two the soldiers stood rooted to the spot, gazing up into the roof of the cave as if expecting a renewal of the sounds.  Then they looked solemnly at each other.  Without uttering a word they turned slowly round, retreated on tip-toe as they came, and finally disappeared.  We need hardly say that the astonishment of the people in the cave at the mode of their deliverance from the threatened danger was intense.  When the torches were relighted the men and women assembled round Ravonino with looks little less solemn than those of the soldiers who had just taken their departure.  \"Surely,\" said the handsome young man whom we have already introduced, \"surely God has wrought a miracle and sent an angel's voice for our deliverance.\"  \"Not so, Laihova,\" replied Ravonino, with a slight smile.  \"We are too apt to count everything that we fail to understand a miracle.  God has indeed sent the deliverance, but through a natural channel.\"  \"Yet we see not the channel, Ravoninohitriniony,\" said Laihova's queen-like sister, Ramatoa.  \"True, Ramatoa.  Nevertheless I can show it to you.  Come, Hockins,\" he added in English, \"clear up the mystery to them.\"  Thus bidden, our seaman at once drew forth the little instrument and began to play the hymn they had just been singing, with the air of which, as we have said, he chanced to be well acquainted.  It would be hard to say whether surprise or pleasure predominated in the breasts of his audience.  At last the latter feeling prevailed, and the whole assembly joined in singing the last verse of the hymn, which appropriately terminated in \"Praise ye the Lord.\"  \"But our retreat is no longer safe,\" said Ravonino, when the last echo of their thanksgiving had died away.  \"We must change our abode--and that without delay.  Get ready.  By the first light of morning I will lead you to a new home.  These soldiers will not return, but they will tell what they have seen, and others less timorous will come here to search for us.\"  Immediately the people set about collecting together and packing up what may be termed their household goods, leaving the guide and their visitors to enjoy supper and conversation in their own corner of the cave.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE GUIDE BECOMES COMMUNICATIVE, AND TELLS OF TERRIBLE DOINGS.  During the progress of supper, which consisted of cold dried meat and rice, the quartette seated on the ferns in the corner of the cave were unusually silent.  Mark Breezy and Ravonino continued to eat for some time without speaking a word.  Ebony, although earnestly absorbed in victuals, rolled his eyes about as he looked from time to time at his companions with unwonted solemnity, and John Hockins frowned at his food, and shook his shaggy head with an air of dissatisfied perplexity.  \"Ravonino,\" at length said the last, looking up, and using his grass pocket-handkerchief, \"it seems to me, bein' a plain straight-for'ard sort o' seaman, that there's somethin' not exactly fair an' above-board in all them proceedin's.  Of course it's not for me to say what a independent man should do or say; but don't you think that w'en a man like you professes to be honest, an' asks other men to trust him, he should at least explain _some_ o' the riddles that surround him?  I'm a loyal man myself, an' I'll stand up for _my_ Queen an' country, no matter what may be the circumstances in w'ich I'm placed; so that w'en I sees another man admittin' that he's a outlaw, an' finds the soldiers of _his_ Queen a-huntin' all about the country arter him and his comrades-- seems to me there's a screw loose somewheres.\"  \"Dat's _my_ sent'ments zactly,\" said the negro, with a decisive nod.

Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________ This book describes some of the voyages of Captain Cook to Tahiti and other islands in the Pacific.  Tahiti had been previously discovered by a Captain Wallis, and Cook was sent out there in order to make some astronomical observations that could not be done in Europe.  The island was very verdant, and it was scarcely necessary for its people to work at all, so that they were very indolent.  They were also inclined to steal, although they realised that it was wrong to do so.  There is a description of some of the more revolting habits of certain Pacific islanders, for instance preparing the body of a slain rival so that it could be \"worn\" by slipping the head through a hole made right in the middle of the body.  There was also cannibalism on some of the islands, which of course laid people open to CJD and similar diseases that are slow to take effect, but very devastating when they do.  The book tells in great detail the final episode of his life when he was murdered by the islanders, whom he had been so glad to know.  ________________________________________________________________________ THE CANNIBAL ISLANDS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  A HERO WHO ROSE FROM THE RANKS.  More than a hundred years ago, there lived a man who dwelt in a mud cottage in the county of York; his name was Cook.  He was a poor, honest labourer--a farm servant.  This man was the father of that James Cook who lived to be a captain in the British Navy, and who, before he was killed, became one of the best and greatest navigators that ever spread his sails to the breeze and crossed the stormy sea.  Captain Cook was a true hero.  His name is known throughout the whole world wherever books are read.  He was born in the lowest condition of life, and raised himself to the highest point of fame.  He was a self-taught man too.  No large sums of money or long years of time were spent upon his schooling.  No college education made him what he was. An old woman taught him his letters, but he was not sent to school till he was thirteen years of age.  He remained only four years at the village school, where he learned a little writing and a little figuring. This was all he had to start with.  The knowledge which he afterwards acquired, the great deeds that he performed, and the wonderful discoveries that he made, were all owing to the sound brain, the patient persevering spirit, the modest practical nature, and the good stout arm with which the Almighty had blessed him.  It is the glory of England that many of her greatest men have risen from the ranks of those sons of toil who earn their daily bread in the sweat of their brow.  Among all who have thus risen, few stand so high as Captain Cook.  Many bold things he did, many strange regions he visited, in his voyages round the world, the records of which fill bulky volumes.  In this little book we shall confine our attention to some of the interesting discoveries that were made by him among the romantic islands of the South Pacific--islands which are so beautiful that they have been aptly styled \"gems of ocean,\" but which, nevertheless, are inhabited by savage races so thoroughly addicted to the terrible practice of eating human flesh, that we have thought fit to adopt the other, and not less appropriate, name of the Cannibal Islands.  Before proceeding with the narrative, let us glance briefly at the early career of Captain James Cook.  He was born in 1728.  After receiving the very slight education already referred to, he was bound apprentice to a shopkeeper.  But the roving spirit within him soon caused him to break away from an occupation so uncongenial.  He passed little more than a year behind the counter, and then, in 1746, went to sea.  Young Cook's first voyages were in connection with the coasting trade. He began his career in a collier trading between London and Newcastle. In a very short time it became evident that he would soon be a rising man.  Promotion came rapidly.  Little more than three years after the expiry of his apprenticeship he became mate of the _Friendship_, but, a few years later, he turned a longing eye on the navy--\"having,\" as he himself said, \"a mind to try his fortune that way.\"  In the year 1755 he entered the King's service on board the _Eagle_, a sixty-gun ship, commanded by Sir Hugh Palliser.  This officer was one of Cook's warmest friends through life.  In the navy the young sailor displayed the same steady, thorough-going character that had won him advancement in the coasting trade.  The secret of his good fortune (if secret it may be called) was his untiring perseverance and energy in the pursuit of one object at one time.  His attention was never divided.  He seemed to have the power of giving his whole soul to the work in hand, whatever that might be, without troubling himself about the future.  Whatever his hand found to do he did it with all his might.  The consequence was that he became a first-rate man.  His superiors soon found that out.  He did not require to boast or push himself forward.  His _work_ spoke for him, and the result was that he was promoted from the forecastle to the quarter-deck, and became a master on board the _Mercury_ when he was about thirty years of age.  About this time he went with the fleet to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and took part in the war then raging between the British and French in Canada.  Winter in that region is long and bitterly cold.  The gulfs and rivers there are at that season covered with thick ice; ships cannot move about, and war cannot be carried on.  Thus the fleet was for a long period inactive.  Cook took advantage of this leisure time to study mathematics and astronomy, and, although he little thought it, was thus fitting himself for the great work of discovery which he afterwards undertook with signal success.  In this expedition to Canada Cook distinguished himself greatly-- especially in his surveys of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and in piloting the fleet safely through the dangerous shoals and rocks of that inland sea.  So careful and correct was he in all that he did, that men in power and in high places began to take special notice of him; and, finally, when, in the year 1767, an expedition of importance was about to be sent to the southern seas for scientific purposes, Cook was chosen to command it.  This was indeed a high honour, for the success of that expedition depended on the man who should be placed at its head.  In order to mark the importance of the command, and at the same time invest the commander with proper authority, Cook was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the Royal Navy.  He had long been a gentleman in heart and conduct; he was now raised to the social position of one by the King's commission.  From this point in his career Cook's history as a great navigator and discoverer began.  We shall now follow him more closely in his brilliant course over the world of waters.  He was about forty years of age at this time; modest and unassuming in manners and appearance; upwards of six feet high, and good-looking, with quick piercing eyes and brown hair, which latter he wore, according to the fashion of the time, tied behind in a pig-tail.  It was not until the end of his first voyage that he was promoted to the rank of captain.    CHAPTER TWO.  SHOWS WHAT MEN WILL DO AND DARE IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE.  Men who study the stars tell us strange and wonderful things--things that the unlearned find it hard to understand, and harder still to believe, yet things that we are now as sure of as we are of the fact that two and two make four!  There was a time when men said that the sun moved round the earth; and very natural it was in men to say so, for, to the eye of sense, it looks as if this were really the case.  But those who study the stars have found out that the earth moves round the sun--a discovery which has been of the greatest importance to mankind--though the importance thereof cannot be fully understood except by scientific men.  Among other difficult things, these astronomers have attempted to measure the distance of the sun, moon, and stars from our earth. Moreover, they have tried to ascertain the exact size of these celestial lights, and they have, to a considerable extent, been successful in their efforts.  By their complicated calculations, the men who study the stars can tell the exact day, hour, and minute when certain events will happen, such as an eclipse of the sun or of the moon.  Now, about the year 1768 the attention of the scientific world was eagerly turned to an event which was to take place in the following year.  This was the passage of the planet Venus across the face of the sun.  Astronomers term this the _Transit of Venus_.  It happens very seldom: it occurred in 1769, but not again till 1874, and 1882.  By observing this passage--this transit--of Venus across the sun from different parts of our earth, it was hoped that such information could be obtained as would enable us to measure not only the distance of the sun from the earth with greater accuracy than heretofore, but also the extent of the whole host of stars that move with our earth around the sun and form what is called our Solar System.  An opportunity occurring so seldom was not to be lost.  Learned men were sent to all parts of the world to observe the event.  Among others, Captain Cook was sent to the south seas--there, among the far-off coral isles, to note the passage of a little star across the sun's face--an apparently trifling, though in reality important, event in the history of science.  So much for the object of Cook's first voyage.  Let us now turn to the details thereof.  The vessel chosen by him for his long and dangerous voyage to unknown seas was a small one of only 370 tons burden.  It was named the _Endeavour_.  The crew consisted of forty-one seamen, twelve"]]]
