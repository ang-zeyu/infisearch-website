Grasping the sharpened ends of the leg wires at the middle of the length projecting from the body, with round nose pliers bend them over in a hair pin shape.  [Illustration: BIRD WIRED.]  Work this loop back through the body pulling back through the leg and clinch the points over into the body again. If the body was firmly made as it should be, this fixes the legs permanently to it, yet they may be bent readily at the joints to suit various attitudes.  Adjust the skin now and fill out at shoulders, thighs, and base of tail with some chopped tow. The breast also may need some filling. Sew up the skin beginning at the breast and finishing at the base of tail, lacing it together with the ball cover stitch.  The pose of the finished specimen you have probably decided on before now so it only remains to put it in the desired attitude. This sounds easy, like sculpture, \"just knock off what stone you don't need and there is the statue,\" but it may try your soul at length to obtain the desired effect. Good pictures are a great help here, as of course a living duplicate would be if you had it.  Before setting it on its feet, coax the wings into place as you hold the bird in your hand and pin them to the body through the elbow and outer joint of the wing, using several pins 2 to 4 in. long or pieces of sharpened wire the same size. This will hold the wings out of the way and they may be changed and fitted perfectly later.  Mounted birds are usually put on temporary stands of rough boards or limbs and when fully dried out transferred to a permanent mount which can be prepared in the meantime of the exact size and variety wished for. On these temporary stands the leg wires are only twisted together so they can be easily removed. Place the feet in natural positions of standing, walking or running and arrange the toes correctly. They had best have some pins driven in beside the toes to secure them till dry, as badly shaped feet will spoil the effect of an otherwise fine piece of work, indicating a careless workman.  If on a bough or stump the feet should grasp it as if the bird really means to stay on it. Two or three wires like those used on the wings hold the tail in place by being driven through the base of it into the body for half their length.  Fix the head looking down rather than up and to one side rather than straight ahead. If you have the proper glass eyes at hand they can be set now, if not, later will do but the lids are relaxed just now to receive them. Fill the back of the sockets with tow or cotton and with a little spoon-shaped modeling tool give this and the inner surface of the lids a good coating of soft clay. The eyes, cut from the wire stem on which most of them come, are pressed into this and the skin worked into place with the point of a big needle or a small awl.  Now give the plumage a general going over, re-pin the wings if necessary, and wind down any obstreperous feathers with thread. A number of pins or wires thrust in the middle of back and breast will help this operation.  Starting at the head wind back to the tail, lacing the thread from pin to pin, not binding tightly with any one thread but producing a smooth surface by holding it down at a multiplicity of points. There are a number of so-called systems for winding birds but the same taxidermist seldom winds two alike as the needs of the case are sure to differ. To spread the tails of small birds, spread the feathers as desired and pin them between two strips of light cardboard. When dry they will retain their position. If all arranged properly set the bird away to dry; two weeks will be sufficient for this.  [Illustration: BIRD WOUND WITH THREAD.]  Any colors on bill or feet and legs should be renewed with oil colors as they fade almost entirely; if of a dark or neutral color originally, a coating of transparent varnish will do. There is a variety of beetle which delights in dining on such hard parts of mounted birds if not protected by paint or varnish.  Place the bird on its final mount and fasten the leg wires in grooves cut in the under side of same so they are flush with surface. The ends may be turned over and driven in again or held fast by small staples. If on the under side of a limb or branch a pinch of moss or lichen glued on will cover this fastening.  Cut away the binding threads and with cutting pliers cut off all projecting pins and wires, leaving what part of them is covered by the feathers. Brush any clay from the eyes and if the lids have shrunken away from them as they do usually, coat a bit of black thread with glue and with a setting needle place between the lids and glass eyes.  [Illustration: THE POSE OR POSITION OF CERTAIN BIRDS]  If the eyes were not on hand when first mounted the lids should have been relaxed and the eyes set as soon as procured.  Small birds may be mounted in fluttering attitudes by pinning the wings with a bunch of cotton beneath them, but if an attitude with wings fully spread is called for they must be treated in a manner similar to the legs, inserting the wire under the skin near the tip of the wing and running it along the under side of the wing bones to the body through which it is thrust and clinched as the leg wires were.  [Illustration: FLUTTERING POSITION OF SMALL BIRDS.]  Birds mounted with spread wings cannot be so readily wound to smooth the plumage and require to be braced with strips of stiff paper and sometimes extra wires, which are removed when dry.  [Illustration: NATURAL STANDING POSITION OF SMALL BIRD ON LIMB.]     CHAPTER X.  MOUNTING LARGE BIRDS.   The same principles employed in the manipulation of smaller species apply to this class with but a few variations. On account of their size and weight the artificial bodies need to be especially firm in order to afford a secure anchorage for the wing and leg wires. Also these supports should be fastened to the bones in several places with stout cord or small wire, as wrapping with the tow and thread used on small birds is hardly sufficient.  What I would class as being large birds are the larger hawks, owls, herons, eagles, geese, etc. The several varieties of the ostrich are known as colossal birds and are skinned and preserved much as the large quadrupeds by mounting the prepared skin on a manikin, built in the pose of the finished specimen and supported by heavy iron rods.  [Illustration: BIRD OF PREY--LIMB POSITION.]  In mounting eagles or similar birds with wings spread, which seems to be a popular attitude, use the largest wires possible as anything less than that will, on account of their size and wide extent, tend to a drooping, back-boneless appearance entirely out of keeping.  It goes without saying that large birds do not require the delicate handling of small ones, but by way of compensation considerable force is needed.  [Illustration: SPREADING TAIL OF LARGE BIRDS.  Run a small sharp wire through the quills on under side of tail to spread it.]  The combs and wattles of domestic and wild fowls cannot by any common process be prevented from shriveling and discoloring while drying, but when dry they may be restored by careful modeling in colored wax. This is applied warm with a brush and given its final finish with hot metal modeling tools. For museum work and other high grade work such heads are cast entire in wax in such a way that all feathers and hair are attached in their precise places.  Large water fowl are often mounted as flying, and suspended by a very fine wire. A sharpened wire with a ring turned in one end, thrust into the middle of the back and clinched in the body, forms a secure point of suspension.  As it is not usually practicable to case many specimens of large birds, give them an extra thorough poisoning and when entirely finished spray with either corrosive sublimate or arsenical solution.  In making bodies for large birds it is well to use excelsior for the main bulk of the body, merely covering the outside with a thin layer of tow. This is not only more economical but makes a lighter specimen than one filled with tow entirely. Excelsior or wood wool is to be had in varying degrees of fineness of upholstery dealers.  [Illustration: SPREAD EAGLE. WINGS BRACED UP TO DRY.]  In the case of a bird which has been wired and sewn up seeming to require further filling out, it can be accomplished in most cases by making an incision under each wing and introducing some flakes of tow with a wire stuffing tool. If the bird is mounted with closed wings this slit need not even be sewed up as the folded wing covers it completely.     CHAPTER XI.  TANNING, CLEANING AND POISONING SKINS.   I have used the following method for some years successfully on skins up to and including the deer in size. Most larger skins need thinning with a special tool, though an experienced hand can manage to thin a heavy hide with a common draw knife.  An empty lard tub, a half barrel or a large earthenware jar to hold the tan liquor, a fleshing knife and a fleshing beam are necessary to begin with at least. Any smith can make a knife of an old, large file or rasp by working both sides to a blunt edge and drawing the upper end out in a tang for another handle. A piece of old scythe blade with cloth wrapped around the ends will do, or a dull draw knife, either. One blade filed into fine teeth will be useful in removing the inner or muscular skin.  [Illustration: FLESHING KNIFE. (Made from old rasp)]  A slab or plank 6 or 7 feet long, with one end tapered and half rounded, on 2 or 4 legs of such length as to bring the end against the workman's chest, makes a beam.  [Illustration: BENCH BEAM.]  A short piece of plank rounded off and bolted to the top of the table or work bench will do for small skins.

Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________ Our Hero, Fred Temple, has risen to be a senior manager in the great Liverpool business founded by his father.  But he was getting overworked and deeply tired, so one day he announced that he was taking leave for a while and was going to visit Norway in a small yacht.  Ballantyne had several holidays in Norway, so to write about it and describe it was a pleasure to him.  This book is therefore an account of Norway seen through the eyes of an enthusiast for that country.  Fred takes some friends with him.  Together, they have great adventures and great fun.  They even venture so far north as Lapland, and the Land of the Midnight Sun.  A wonderful piece of vintage Victoriana at its best.  ________________________________________________________________________ CHASING THE SUN, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  PREPARATIONS FOR THE CHASE.  Fred Temple was a tall, handsome young fellow of about five-and-twenty.  He had a romantic spirit, a quiet gentlemanly manner, a pleasant smile, and a passionate desire for violent exercise.  To look at him you would have supposed that he was rather a lazy man, for all his motions were slow and deliberate.  He was never in a hurry, and looked as if it would take a great deal to excite him.  But those who knew Fred Temple well used to say that there was a great deal more in him than appeared at first sight.  Sometimes a sudden flush of the brow, or a gleam of his eyes, told of hidden fires within.  Fred, when a small boy, was extremely fond of daring and dangerous expeditions.  He had risked his life hundreds of times on tree-tops and precipices for birds' nests, and had fought more hand-to-hand battles than any of the old Greek or Roman heroes.  After he became a man, he risked his life more than once in saving the lives of others, and it was a notable fact that many of the antagonists of his boyhood became, at last, his most intimate friends.  Fred Temple was fair and ruddy.  At about the age of nineteen certain parts of his good-looking face became covered with a substance resembling floss-silk.  At twenty-five this substance had changed into a pair of light whiskers and a lighter moustache.  By means of that barbarous custom called shaving he kept his chin smooth.  Fred's father was a wealthy Liverpool merchant.  At the period when our tale opens Fred himself had become chief manager of the business. People began, about this time, to say that the business could not get on without him.  There were a great number of hands, both men and women, employed by Temple and Son, and there was not one on the establishment, male or female, who did not say and believe that Mr Frederick was the best master, not only in Liverpool, but in the whole world.  He did not by any means overdose the people with attentions; but he had a hearty offhand way of addressing them that was very attractive.  He was a firm ruler.  No skulker had a chance of escape from his sharp eye, but, on the other hand, no hard-working servant was overlooked.  One day it was rumoured in the works that Mr Frederick was going to take a long holiday.  Since his appointment to the chief charge, Fred had taken few holidays, and had worked so hard that he began to have a careworn aspect, so the people said they were \"glad to hear it; no one in the works deserved a long holiday better than he.\"  But the people were not a little puzzled when Bob Bowie, the office porter, told them that their young master was going away for three months to chase the sun!  \"Chase the sun, Bob! what d'ye mean?\" said one.  \"I don't know wot I mean; I can only tell ye wot I say,\" answered Bowie bluntly.  Bob Bowie was an old salt--a retired seaman--who had sailed long as steward of one of the ships belonging to the House of Temple and Son, and, in consequence of gallantry in saving the life of a comrade, had been pensioned off, and placed in an easy post about the office, with good pay.  He was called Old Bob because he looked old, and was weather-worn, but he was stout and hale, and still fit for active service.  \"Come, Bowie,\" cried another, \"how d'ye know he's goin' to chase the sun?\"  \"Cause I heerd him say so,\" replied Bob.  \"Was he in earnest?\" inquired a third.  \"In coorse he wos,\" said Bob.  \"Then it's my opinion,\" replied the other, \"that old Mr Temple'll have to chase _his_ son, and clap him in a strait-jacket w'en he catches him--if he talks such stuff.\"  The porter could not understand a joke, and did not like one, so he turned on his heel, and, leaving his friends to laugh at their comrade's jest, proceeded to the counting-room.  There were two counting-rooms--a small outer and a large inner one.  In the outer room sat a tall middle-aged man, lanky and worn in appearance and with a red nose.  Opposite to him, at the same desk, sat a small fat boy with a round red face, and no chin to speak of.  The man was writing busily--the boy was drawing a caricature of the man, also busily.  Passing these, Bob Bowie entered the inner office, where a dozen clerks were all busily employed, or pretending to be so.  Going straight onward like a homeward-bound ship, keeping his eyes right ahead, Bob was stranded at last in front of a green door, at which he knocked, and was answered with a hearty \"Come in.\"  The porter went in and found Fred Temple seated at a table which was covered with books and papers.  \"Oh!  I sent for you, Bowie, to say that I want you to go with me to Norway to-morrow morning.\"  \"To Norway, sir!\" said Bowie in surprise.  \"Ay, surely you're not growing timid in your old age, Bob!  It is but a short voyage of two or three days.  My little schooner is a good sea-boat, and a first-rate sailor.\"  \"Why, as for bein' _timid_,\" said the porter, rubbing the end of his nose, which was copper-coloured and knotty, \"I don't think I ever knowed that there feelin', but it does take a feller aback to be told all of a suddent, after he's reg'larly laid up in port, to get ready to trip anchor in twelve hours and bear away over the North Sea--not that I cares a brass fardin' for that fish-pond, blow high, blow low, but it's raither suddent, d'ye see, and my rig ain't just seaworthy.\"  Bowie glanced uneasily at his garments, which were a cross between those of a railway-guard and a policeman.  \"Never mind the rig, Bob,\" cried Fred, laughing.  \"Do you get ready to start, with all the underclothing you have, by six to-morrow morning. We shall go to Hull by rail, and I will see to it that your top-sails are made all right.\"  \"Wery good, sir.\"  \"You've not forgotten how to make lobscouse or plum-duff, I dare say?\"  Bob's eyes brightened as he replied stoutly, \"By no manner o' means.\"  \"Then be off, and, remember, sharp six.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" cried the old seaman in a nautical tone that he had not used for many years, and the very sound of which stirred his heart with old memories.  He was about to retire, but paused at the threshold of the green door.  \"Beg parding, sir, but if I might make so bold as to ax--\"  \"Go on, Bob,\" said Fred encouragingly.  \"I heerd ye say to our cashier, sir, that you wos goin' for to _chase the sun_.  Wot sort of a chase may that be, sir?\"  \"Ha!  Bowie, that's a curious chase, but not a wild goose one, as I hope to show you in a month or two.  You know, of course, that in the regions of the earth north of the Arctic Circle the sun shines by night as well as by day for several weeks in summer?\"  \"In coorse I do,\" answered Bob; \"every seaman knows that or ought for to know it; and that it's dark all day as well as all night in winter for some weeks, just to make up for it, so to speak.\"  \"Well, Bob, I am very desirous to see this wonderful sight with my own eyes, but I fear I am almost too late of setting out.  The season is so far advanced that the sun is setting farther and farther north every night, and if the winds baffle us I won't be able to catch him sitting up all night; but if the winds serve, and we have plenty of them we may yet be in time to see him draw an unbroken circle in the sky.  You see it will be a regular chase, for the sun travels north at a rapid pace. D'you understand?\"  Bob Bowie grinned, nodded his head significantly, retired, and shut the door.  Fred Temple, left alone, seized a quill and scribbled off two notes,-- one to a friend in Scotland, the other to a friend in Wales.  The note to Scotland ran as follows:--  \"MY DEAR GRANT,--I have made up my mind to go to Norway for three months.  Principal object to chase the sun.  Secondary objects, health and amusement.  Will you go?  You will find my schooner comfortable, my society charming (if you make yourself agreeable), and no end of salmon-fishing and scenery.  Reply by return of post.  I go to Hull to-morrow, and will be there a week.  This will give you ample time to get ready.  \"Ever thine, FRED TEMPLE.\"  The note to Wales was addressed to Sam Sorrel, and was written in somewhat similar terms, but Sam being a painter by profession, the beauty of the scenery was enlarged on and held out as an inducement.  Both of Fred's friends had been prepared some time before for this proposal, and both of them at once agreed to assist him in \"chasing the sun!\"  That night Frederick Temple dreamed that the sun smiled on him in a peculiarly sweet manner; he dreamed, still further, that it beckoned him to follow it to the far north, whereupon Fred was suddenly transformed into a gigantic locomotive engine; the sun all at once became a green dragon with pink eyes and a blue tail; and he set off in chase of it into the Arctic regions with a noise like a long roar of the loudest thunder!    CHAPTER TWO.  THE STORM AND THE FIRST ADVENTURE.  A storm raged on the bosom of the North Sea.  The wind whistled as if all the spirits of Ocean were warring with each other furiously.
