Beyond a doubt they were the same brave young adventurers whom I had met in the swamps of Louisiana, and whose exploits I had witnessed upon the prairies of Texas.  They were the \"Boy Hunters,\"--Basil, Lucien, Francois!  I was right glad to renew acquaintance with them.  Boy reader, do you share my joy?  But whither go they now?  They are full two thousand miles from their home in Louisiana.  The Red River upon which their canoe floats is not that Red River, whose blood-like waters sweep through the swamps of the hot South--the home of the alligator and the gar.  No, it is a stream of a far different character, though also one of great magnitude.  Upon the banks of the former ripens the rice-plant, and the sugar-cane waves its golden tassels high in the air.  There, too, flourishes the giant reed (_Arundo gigantea_), the fan-palm (_Chamaerops_), and the broad-leafed magnolia, with its huge snow-white flowers.  There the aspect is Southern, and the heat tropical for most part of the year.  All this is reversed on the Red River of the North.  It is true that on its banks sugar is also produced; but it is no longer from a plant but a lordly tree--the great sugar-maple (_Acer saccharinum_).  There is rice too,--vast fields of rice upon its marshy borders; but it is not the pearly grain of the South.  It is the wild rice, \"the water oats\" (_Zizania aquatica_), the food of millions of winged creatures, and thousands of human beings as well.  Here for three-fourths of the year the sun is feeble, and the aspect that of winter.  For months the cold waters are bound up in an icy embrace.  The earth is covered with thick snow, over which rise the needle-leafed _coniferae_--the pines, the cedars, the spruce, and the hemlock.  Very unlike each other are the countries watered by the two streams, the Red River of the South and its namesake of the North.  But whither go our Boy Hunters in their birch-bark canoe?  The river upon which they are _voyaging_ runs due northward into the great Lake Winnipeg.  They are floating with its current, and consequently increasing the distance from their home.  Whither go they?  The answer leads us to some sad reflections.  Our joy on again beholding them is to be mingled with grief.  When we last saw them they had a father, but no mother.  Now they have neither one nor the other.  The old Colonel, their father--the French _emigre_, the _hunter-naturalist_--is dead.  He who had taught them all they knew, who had taught them \"to ride, to swim, to dive deep rivers, to fling the lasso, to climb tall trees, and scale steep cliffs, to bring down birds upon the wing or beasts upon the run, with the arrow and the unerring rifle; who had trained them to sleep in the open air, in the dark forest, on the unsheltered prairie, along the white snow-wreath-- anywhere--with but a blanket or a buffalo-robe for their bed; who had taught them to live on the simplest food, and had imparted to one of them a knowledge of science, of botany in particular, that enabled them, in case of need, to draw sustenance from plants and trees, from roots and fruits, to find resources where ignorant men would starve; had taught them to kindle a fire without flint, steel, or detonating powder; to discover their direction without a compass, from the rocks and the trees and the signs of the heavens; and in addition to all, had taught them, as far as was then known, the geography of that vast wilderness that stretches from the Mississippi to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and northward to the icy borders of the Arctic Sea\"--he who had taught them all this, their father, was no more; and his three sons, the \"boy men,\" of whom he was so proud, and of whose accomplishments he was wont to boast, were now orphans upon the wide world.  But little more than a year after their return from their grand expedition to the Texan prairies, the \"old Colonel\" had died.  It was one of the worst years of that scourge of the South--the yellow fever-- and to this dread pestilence he had fallen a victim.  Hugot, the _ex-chasseur_ and attached domestic, who was accustomed to follow his master like a shadow, had also followed him into the next world.  It was not grief that killed Hugot, though he bore the loss of his kind master sadly enough.  But it was not grief that killed Hugot. He was laid low by the same disease of which his master had died--the yellow fever.  A week had scarcely passed after the death of the latter, before Hugot caught the disease, and in a few days he was carried to the tomb and laid by the side of his \"old Colonel.\"  The Boy Hunters--Basil, Lucien, Francois--became orphans.  They knew of but _one_ relation in the whole world, with whom their father had kept up any correspondence.  This relation was an uncle, and, strange as it may seem, a Scotchman--a Highlander, who had strayed to Corsica in early life, and had there married the Colonel's sister.  That uncle had afterwards emigrated to Canada, and had become extensively engaged in the fur trade.  He was now a superintendent or \"factor\" of the Hudson's Bay Company, stationed at one of their most remote posts near the shores of the Arctic Sea!  There is a romance in the history of some men wilder than any fiction that could be imagined.  I have not yet answered the question as to where our Boy Hunters were journeying in their birch-bark canoe.  By this time you will have divined the answer.  Certainly, you will say, they were on their way to join their uncle in his remote home.  For no other object could they be travelling through the wild regions of the Red River.  That supposition is correct.  To visit this Scotch uncle (they had not seen him for years) was the object of their long, toilsome, and perilous journey. After their father's death he had sent for them.  He had heard of their exploits upon the prairies; and, being himself of an adventurous disposition, he was filled with admiration for his young kinsmen, and desired very much to have them come and live with him.  Being now their guardian, he might command as much, but it needed not any exercise of authority on his part to induce all three of them to obey his summons. They had travelled through the mighty forests of the Mississippi, and upon the summer prairies of the South.  These great features of the earth's surface were to them familiar things, and they were no longer curious about them.  But there remained a vast country which they longed eagerly to explore.  They longed to look upon its shining lakes and crystal rivers; upon its snow-clad hills and ice-bound streams; upon its huge mammalia--its moose and its musk-oxen, its wapiti and its monster bears.  This was the very country to which they were now invited by their kinsman, and cheerfully did they accept his invitation.  Already had they made one-half the journey, though by far the easier half.  They had travelled up the Mississippi, by steamboat as far as the mouth of the Saint Peter's.  There they had commenced their canoe voyage--in other words became \"voyageurs\"--for such is the name given to those who travel by canoes through these wild territories.  Their favourite horses and the mule \"Jeannette\" had been left behind.  This was a necessity, as these creatures, however useful upon the dry prairies of the South, where there are few or no lakes, and where rivers only occur at long intervals, would be of little service to the traveller in the Northern regions.  Here the route is crossed and intercepted by numerous rivers; and lakes of all sizes, with tracts of inundated marsh, succeed one another continually.  Such, in fact, are the highways of the country, and the canoe the travelling carriage; so that a journey from one point of the Hudson's Bay territory to another is often a canoe voyage of thousands of miles--equal to a \"trip\" across the Atlantic!  Following the usual custom, therefore, our Boy Hunters had become voyageurs--\"_Young Voyageurs_.\"  They had navigated the Saint Peter's in safety, almost to its head-waters.  These interlock with the sources of the Red River.  By a \"portage\" of a few miles they had crossed to the latter stream; and, having launched their canoe upon its waters, were now floating downward and northward with its current.  But they had yet a long journey before them--nearly two thousand miles!  Many a river to be \"run,\" many a rapid to be \"shot,\" many a lake to be crossed, and many a \"portage\" to be passed, ere they could reach the end of that great _voyage_.  Come, boy reader, shall we accompany them?  Yes.  The strange scenes and wild adventures through which we must pass, may lighten the toils, and perhaps repay us for the perils, of the journey.  Think not of the toils.  Roses grow only upon thorns.  From toil we learn to enjoy leisure.  Regard not the perils.  \"From the nettle danger we pluck the flower safety.\"  Security often springs from peril.  From such hard experiences great men have arisen.  Come, then, my young friend! mind neither toil nor peril, but with me to the great wilderness of the North!  Stay!  We are to have another \"_compagnon du voyage_.\"  There is a fourth in the boat, a fourth \"young voyageur.\"  Who is he?  In appearance he is as old as Basil, full as tall, and not unlike him in \"build.\"  But he is altogether of a different _colour_.  He is fair-haired; but his hair (unlike that of Lucien, which is also light-coloured) is strong, crisp, and curly.  It does not droop, but stands out over his cheeks in a profusion of handsome ringlets.  His complexion is of that kind known as \"fresh,\" and the weather, to which it has evidently been much exposed, has bronzed and rather enriched the colour.  The eyes are dark blue, and, strange to say, with _black_ brows and lashes!  This is not common, though sometimes observed; and, in the case of the youth we are describing, arose from a difference of complexion on the part of his parents.  He looked through the eyes of his mother, while in other"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23129"],["title","The Young Voyageurs: Boy Hunters in the North (#3)"],["body","he was more like his father, who was fair-haired and of a \"fresh\" colour.  The youth, himself, might be termed handsome.  Perhaps he did not possess the youthful beauty of Francois, nor the bolder kind that characterised the face of Basil.  Perhaps he was of a coarser \"make\" than any of his three companions.  His intellect had been less cultivated by education, and _education adds to the beauty of the face_. His life had been a harder one--he had toiled more with his hands, and had seen less of civilised society.  Still many would have pronounced him a handsome youth.  His features were regular, and of clean outline. His lips expressed good-nature as well as firmness.  His eye beamed with native intelligence, and his whole face bespoke a heart of true and determined honesty--_that made it beautiful_.  Perhaps a close scrutiniser of countenances might have detected some resemblance--a family one--between him and his three companions.  If such there was, it was very slight; but there might have been, from the relationship that existed between them and him.  He was their cousin-- their full cousin--the only son of that uncle they were now on their way to visit, and the new-comer who had been sent to bring them.  Such was the fourth of \"the young voyageurs.\"  His dress was not unlike that worn by Basil; but as he was seated on the bow, and acting as pilot, and therefore more likely to feel the cold, he wore over his hunting-shirt a Canadian _capote_ of white woollen cloth, with its hood hanging, down upon his shoulders.  But there was still another \"voyageur,\" an old acquaintance, whom you, boy reader, will no doubt remember.  This was an animal, a quadruped, who lay along the bottom of the canoe upon a buffalo's hide.  \"From his size and colour--which was a tawny red--you might have mistaken him for a panther--a cougar.  His long black muzzle and broad hanging ears gave him quite a different aspect, however, and declared him to be a hound. He _was_ one--a bloodhound, with the build of a mastiff--a powerful animal.  He was the dog `Marengo.'\"  You remember Marengo?  In the canoe there were other objects of interest.  There were blankets and buffalo-robes; there was a small canvass tent folded up; there were bags of provisions, and some cooking utensils; there was a spade and an axe; there were rifles--three of them--and a double-barrelled shot-gun; besides a fish-net, and many other articles, the necessary equipments for such a journey.  Loaded almost to the gunwale was that little canoe, yet lightly did it float down the waters of the Red River of the North.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE TRUMPETER SWAN AND THE BALD EAGLE.  It was the spring season, though late.  The snow had entirely disappeared from the hills, and the ice from the water, and the melting of both had swollen the river, and rendered its current more rapid than usual.  Our young voyageurs needed not therefore to ply their oars, except now and then to guide the canoe; for these little vessels have no rudder, but are steered by the paddles.  The skilful voyageurs can shoot them to any point they please, simply by their dexterous handling of the oars; and Basil, Lucien, and Francois, had had sufficient practice both with \"skiffs\" and \"dugouts\" to make good oarsmen of all three.  They had made many a canoe trip upon the lower Mississippi and the bayous of Louisiana; besides their journey up the Saint Peter's had rendered them familiar with the management of their birchen craft.  An occasional stroke of the paddle kept them in their course, and they floated on without effort.  Norman--such was the name of their Canadian or Highland cousin--sat in the bow and directed their course.  This is the post of honour in a canoe; and as he had more experience than any of them in this sort of navigation, he was allowed habitually to occupy this post. Lucien sat in the stern.  He held in his hands a book and pencil; and as the canoe glided onward, he was noting down his memoranda.  The trees upon the banks were in leaf--many of them in blossom--and as the little craft verged near the shore, his keen eye followed the configuration of the leaves, to discover any new species that might appear.  There is a rich vegetation upon the banks of the Red River; but the _flora_ is far different from that which appears upon the low _alluvion_ of Louisiana. It is Northern, but not Arctic.  Oaks, elms, and poplars, are seen mingling with birches, willows, and aspens.  Several species of indigenous fruit trees were observed by Lucien, among which were crab-apple, raspberry, strawberry, and currant.  There was also seen the fruit called by the voyageurs \"le poire,\" but which in English phraseology is known as the \"service-berry\" (_Amelanchier ovalis_).  It grows upon a small bush or shrub of six or eight feet high, with smooth pinnate leaves.  These pretty red berries are much esteemed and eaten both by Indians and whites, who preserve them by drying, and cook them in various ways.  There was still another bush that fixed the attention of our young botanist, as it appeared all along the banks, and was a _characteristic_ of the vegetation of the country.  It was not over eight feet in height, with spreading branches of a grey colour.  Its leaves were three inches wide, and somewhat lobed liked those of the oak.  Of course, at this early season, the fruit was not ripe upon it; but Lucien knew the fruit well.  When ripe it resembles very much a red cherry, or, still more, a cranberry, having both the appearance and acrid taste of the latter.  Indeed, it is sometimes used as a substitute for cranberries in the making of pies and tarts; and in many parts it is called the \"bush cranberry.\"  The name, however, by which it is known among the Indians of Red River is \"_anepeminan_,\" from \"_nepen_,\" summer, and \"_minan_\" berry.  This has been corrupted by the fur-traders and voyageurs into \"Pembina;\" hence, the name of a river which runs into the Red, and also he name of the celebrated but unsuccessful settlement of \"Pembina,\" formed by Lord Selkirk many years ago.  Both took their names from this berry that grows in abundance in the neighbourhood.  The botanical appellation of this curious shrub is _Viburnum oxycoccos_; but there is another species of the viburnum, which is also styled \"oxycoccos.\"  The common \"snowball bush\" of our gardens is a plant of the same genus, and very like the \"Pembina\" both in leaf and flower.  In fact, in a wild state they might be regarded as the same; but it is well-known that the flowers of the snowball are sterile, and do not produce the beautiful bright crimson berries of the \"Pembina.\"  Lucien lectured upon these points to his companions as they floated along. Norman listened with astonishment to his philosophic cousin, who, although he had never been in this region before, knew more of its plants and trees than he did himself.  Basil also was interested in the explanations given by his brother.  On the contrary, Francois, who cared but little for botanical studies, or studies of any sort, was occupied differently.  He sat near the middle of the canoe, double-barrel in hand, eagerly watching for a shot.  Many species of water-fowl were upon the river, for it was now late in the spring, and the wild geese and ducks had all arrived, and were passing northward upon their annual migration.  During the day Francois had got several shots, and had \"bagged\" three wild geese, all of different kinds, for there are many species of wild geese in America.  He had also shot some ducks.  But this did not satisfy him.  There was a bird upon the river that could not be approached.  No matter how the canoe was manoeuvred, this shy creature always took flight before Francois could get within range.  For days he had been endeavouring to kill one.  Even upon the Saint Peter's many of them had been seen, sometimes in pairs, at other times in small flocks of six or seven, but always shy and wary.  The very difficulty of getting a shot at them, along with the splendid character of the birds themselves, had rendered Francois eager to obtain one.  The bird itself was no other than the great wild swan--the king of aquatic birds.  \"Come, brother!\" said Francois, addressing Lucien, \"bother your viburnums and your oxycocks!  Tell us something about these swans.  See! there goes another of them!  What a splendid fellow he is!  I'd give something to have him within range of buck-shot.\"  As Francois spoke he pointed down-stream to a great white bird that was seen moving out from the bank.  It was a swan, and one of the very largest kind--a \"trumpeter\" (_Cygnus buccinator_).  It had been feeding in a sedge of the wild rice (_Zizania aquatica_), and no doubt the sight of the canoe or the plash of the guiding oar had disturbed, and given it the alarm.  It shot out from the reeds with head erect and wings slightly raised, offering to the eyes of the voyageurs a spectacle of graceful and majestic bearing, that, among the feathered race at least, is quite inimitable.  A few strokes of its broad feet propelled it into the open water near the middle of the stream, when, making a half wheel, it turned head down the river, and swam with the current.  At the point where it turned it was not two hundred yards ahead of the canoe.  Its apparent boldness in permitting them to come so near without taking wing, led Francois to hope that they might get still nearer; and, begging his companions to ply the paddles, he seized hold of his double-barrel, and leaned forward in the canoe.  Basil also conceived a hope that a shot was to be had, for he took up his rifle, and looked to the cock and cap.  The others went steadily and quietly to work at the oars.  In a few moments the canoe cleft the current at the rate of a galloping horse, and one would have supposed that the swan must either at once take wing or be overtaken.  Not so, however.  The \"trumpeter\" knew his game better than that.  He had full confidence "]]]
