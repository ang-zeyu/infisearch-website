From such elevated positions they look down complacently on their crowded brethren.  The houses near the sea have not fared so well.  They are built _in_ the water on piles, and are all of them warehouses with projections in front, from which hang blocks and hoisting tackle.  These projections resemble heads; the piles look like legs; and it does not require a very strong effort of imagination to believe that the warehouses are great living creatures which have waded into the sea, and are looking earnestly down into the water to observe how the fish are getting on.  The houses are all built of wood; all are painted white, and all have red-tiled roofs.  They are peaked and gable-ended to an extraordinary degree, so that the general aspect of the city is confused and irregular--all the more interesting and picturesque on this account.  A thought strikes me here, and when a thought strikes one, I think we ought always to pay that thought the compliment of jotting it down.  It is this--regularity in small details is pleasing; regularity on a grand scale is disagreeable.  For instance, a chair with one leg turned, another square, and a third ornamentally carved, would be a disagreeable object.  The two front legs at least must be regular, and the two back legs regular.  A chair is a small matter.  But proceed to a grander subject--a city.  If every house is similar to its neighbours, if every street is parallel to the rest, the effect is bad; regularity here is disagreeable.  This is a deep subject requiring much study and philosophical inquiry.  If I were to go farther into it, our friend Fred Temple's adventures would have to be cast overboard.  I will, therefore, cut it short with the remark that the subject is well worthy the attention of even deeper-thinking men than are ever likely to read this book.  When the three friends, Temple, Grant, and Sorrel, found themselves in the quaint old city of Bergen their first thought was _supper_; their second thought _bed_.  Now this may seem to some minds a dreadfully low and contemptible state of things.  \"What!\" a romantic reader may exclaim, \"they had arrived in that celebrated city, from which in days of old the stalwart Vikings used to issue on their daring voyages, in which the descendants of these grand fellows still dwell, and in which are interesting memorials of the past and quaint evidences of the present.  Did your heroes, Temple, Sorrel, and Grant, think of supper and of bed when their feet for the first time trod the soil of Old Norway?\"  Even so!  Romantic reader, I am bound to tell you that romance is all very well in its way, but it has no power whatever over an empty stomach or an exhausted brain.  When our three friends landed in Bergen it was past midnight.  Their admiration of the scenery had induced them to neglect supper and to defy sleep, so that when they landed they felt more than half inclined to fall upon their boatman and eat him up alive, and then to fall down on the stone pier and go off to sleep at once.  In this frame of mind and body they entered the house of Madame Sontoom, and called for supper.  Madame Sontoom was the owner of a private hotel.  Moreover, she was the owner of a plump body and a warm heart.  Consequently, she at once became a mother to all who were fortunate enough to dwell under her roof.  Her hotel was by no means like to a hotel in this country.  It was more like a private residence.  There were no hired waiters.  Her amiable daughters waited; and they did not look upon you as a customer, or conduct themselves like servants.  No, they treated you as a visitor, and conducted themselves with the agreeable familiarity of friends!  Of course they presented their bill when you were about to leave them, but in all other respects the idea of a hotel was banished from the mind.  \"Supper,\" cried Temple, on entering the house.  \"Ya, ya,\" (yes, yes), in cheerful tones from two of Madame Sontoom's daughters.  Then followed a violent conversation in the Norse language, in which there was much that was puzzling, and more that was amusing, for the Norwegian ladies were talkative and inquisitive.  Fred Temple had studied the Norse language for three months before setting out on this voyage, and, being a good linguist he understood a good deal of what was said, and could make his own wants known pretty well.  Grant had studied the language also, but not for so long a time, and, being an indifferent linguist, he made little headway in conversation.  As to Sam Sorrel, he had no talent for languages.  He hated every language but his mother-tongue, had not studied Norse at all, and did not intend to do so.  It may be supposed, therefore, that he was dumb.  Far from it.  He had picked up a few phrases by ear, and was so fond of making use of these, and of twisting them into all shapes and out of all shape, that he really appeared to be a great talker of Norse, although in reality he could scarcely talk at all!  Supper consisted of coffee, rolls, eggs, \"gamleost\" (old cheese), lobster, and smoked salmon.  The viands were good, the appetites were also good, so the supper went off admirably.  \"Ver so goot,\" said one of the young ladies, handing Mr Sorrel a plate of smoked salmon.  \"Tak, tak,\" (thanks, thanks), said our artist, accepting the salmon, and beginning to devour it.  \"I say, what d'ye mean by `ver so goot'?  You're never done saying it. What does it mean?\"  The fair waitress laughed, and bowed politely, as much as to say, \"I don't understand English.\"  \"Can you explain it, Fred?\" said Sam.  \"Well, yes, I can give you a sort of explanation,\" replied Fred, \"but it is not an easy sentence to translate.  `Ver so goot' (another claw of that lobster, please.  Thanks),--`ver so goot' is an expression that seems to me capable of extension and distension.  It is a comfortable, jovial, rollicking expression, if I may say so.  I cannot think of a better way of conveying an idea of its meaning than saying that it is a compound of the phrases `be so good,' `by your leave,' `good luck to you,' `go it, ye cripples,' and `that's your sort.'  The first of these, `be so good,' is the literal translation.  The others are more or less mixed up with it.  You may rely on it, Sam, that when a Norwegian offers you anything and says `ver so goot,' he means you well, and hopes that you will make yourself comfortable.\"  \"You don't say so, Fred; I'll adopt the phrase from this hour!\"  Accordingly Sam Sorrel did adopt it, and used it on all and every occasion, without any regard to its appropriateness.  Little was said at supper.  The whole party were too tired to converse.  \"Now for bed,\" cried Sam, rising.  \"I say, Fred, what's the Norse for a bed?\"  \"Seng,\" replied Fred.  \"Seng! what a remarkable name!  Now, then, my good girl, _ver so goot_ will you show me my _seng_?  Good night, comrades, I'm off to--ha! ha! what a musical idea--to seng.\"  \"More probably to snore,\" observed Grant.  \"Oh, Grant,\" said Sam, looking back and shaking his head, \"give up jesting.  It's bad for your health; fie for shame! good night.\"  Norwegian beds are wooden boxes of about three feet wide, and five and a half long.  I have never been able to discover why it is that Norwegians love to make their beds as uncomfortable as possible.  Yet so it is.  Grant had a room to himself.  Temple and our artist were shown into a double-bedded room.  \"Is that a bed?\" said Sam, pointing to a red-painted wooden box in a corner; \"why, it's too short even for me, and you know I'm not a giant.\"  \"Oh! then what must it be for me?\" groaned Fred Temple.  On close examination it was found that each bed was too short for any man above five feet two, and, further, that there was a feather-bed below and a feather-bed above, instead of blankets.  Thus they lay that night between two feather-beds, which made them so hot that it was impossible to sleep at first.  Sorrel, being short, managed to lie diagonally across his box, but Fred, being long, was compelled to double himself up like a foot-rule.  However, fatigue at last caused them to slumber in spite of all difficulties.  In the morning they were visited by a ghost!    CHAPTER FOUR.  A GHOST AND A CUSTOM--A FISH-MARKET AND A NORSE LOVER.  There was no night in Bergen at this time.  At the midnight hour there was light enough to see to read the smallest print, and at an early hour in the morning this sweet twilight brightened into dawn.  This being the case, Fred Temple was not a little surprised to see a ghost make its appearance about six o'clock--for ghosts are famous for their hatred of broad daylight.  Nevertheless there it was, in the form of a woman.  What else could it be but a ghost? for no woman would dare to enter his bedroom (so he thought) without knocking at the door.  The ghost had in her hand a tray with a cup of coffee on it.  Fred watched her motions with intense curiosity, and kept perfectly still, pretending to be asleep.  She went straight to the box in which Sam Sorrel slept, and going down on her knees, looked earnestly into his face.  As our artist's mouth happened to be wide-open, it may be said that she looked down his throat.  Presently she spoke to him in a soft whisper--\"Will de have caffe?\"  (Will you have coffee?)  A loud snore was the reply.  Again she spoke, somewhat louder: \"Vill de have caffe?\"  A snort was the reply.  Once more, in a tone which would not be denied:  \"_Vill de have caffe_?\"  \"Eh! hallo! what! dear me! yes--ah--thank you--_ver so goot_,\" replied Sam, as he awoke and gazed in wild surprise at the ghost who was none other than the female domestic servant of the house, who had brought the visitors a cup of coffee before breakfast.  Sam's exclamations were wild at first, and he stared like a maniac, but as consciousness returned he understood his position, and being naturally a modest man, he hastily drew on his nightcap and gathered the bedding round his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23262"],["title","Chasing the Sun (#4)"],["body","ers.  Accepting the coffee, he drank it, and the girl crossed the room to pay similar attentions to Fred Temple.  This presentation of a cup of coffee in bed before breakfast is a custom in Norway, and a very pleasant custom it is, too, especially when it breaks upon you unexpectedly for the first time.  \"Now for the fish-market, Sam,\" cried Fred, leaping out of bed when the girl had left the room.  \"Who cares for the fish-market?\" said Sam testily, as he turned round in his bed, and prepared to slumber.  \"I care for it,\" retorted Fred, \"and so do you, old boy, only you are lazy this morning.  Come, get up.  I have resolved to spend only one day in this queer old city, so you _must_ not let drowsiness rob you of your opportunities of seeing it.  The fish-market, you know, is famous. Come, get up.\"  Temple enforced his advice by seizing his companion by the ankles and hauling him out of bed.  Sam grumbled but submitted, and in a short time they were ready to start.  \"Hallo!  Grant,\" cried Fred, as they passed his door, \"will you come with us to ramble over the town?\"  \"No,\" said Grant, in a deep bass voice.  \"Why?\"  \"Because I won't.\"  \"A most excellent reason; one much in use in this world,\" replied Temple, laughing.  \"By the way, will you remember to order two sheep to be killed for our voyage north?\"  \"Yes,\" in a sulky tone from Grant.  \"Now mind, I trust this to you.\"  \"Go away, and don't bother!\"  Thus dismissed, Temple and Sorrel went out and sauntered towards the fish-market.  Now, fish-markets are famous all the world over for noise, riot, and confusion.  The fish-market of Bergen is no exception to the rule; but there is this peculiarity about it, that the sellers of fish are all men, and the buyers all women; moreover, the noise is all on the side of the buyers!  The scene of the market is the pier, alongside of which the fishermen's boats are ranged; and here the fish are sold direct from the boats by the men to all the servant-girls of the town, who assemble each morning to purchase the day's dinner.  The men, standing in the boats, are considerably below the level of the pier, so that they have to look up at the girls, who look down at them with eager, anxious faces.  The men, sure that their fish will be sold in the long-run, are quiet sedate, silent.  The women, anxious to get good bargains and impatient to get home, bend forward, shouting, screaming, and flourishing arms, fists, and umbrellas.  Every one carries an umbrella in Bergen, for that city is said to be the rainiest in the world.  Of gay colours are these umbrellas too.  Pink and sky-blue are not uncommon.  There is a stout iron rail round the pier, which prevents the eager females from tumbling headlong into the boats. Over this they lean and bargain.  Fierce were the pretty blue eyes of these Norse females, and flushed were their fair faces, and tremendous was the flourishing of their umbrellas and the shaking of their fists, at the time when Temple and Sorrel approached.  The fishermen were used to it; they only smiled, or paid no attention whatever to the noise.  And what was all the noise about?  You shall hear.  Look at yonder flaxen-haired, pretty-faced, stoutish little girl, leaning so far over the iron rail that it seems her desire to tumble over it, and plunge into the arms of a rough old fisherman, who is gazing quietly up at her with a sarcastic smile.  He has put up a lot of fish for which she has offered \"sex (six) skillings.\"  A skilling is about equal to a halfpenny.  He thinks this too little, but he won't condescend to say so.  He merely pays no attention to the girl's violent entreaties.  The language of the girl bears so strong a resemblance to our own that it scarcely requires translation.  \"Fiskman,\" she cries, \"vill du have otto skillings?\"  (will you have eight skillings?)  No, the fiskman won't have that; it is not enough, so he makes no reply, but pretends to be washing his boat.  \"Fiskman, fiskman, vill du have ni?\"  (will you have nine?)  Still no reply.  The fisherman turns his back on the market, gazes out to sea, and begins to whistle.  At this the girl becomes furious.  She whirls her umbrella in the air desperately.  If that umbrella were only a foot longer the fiskman's head would certainly feel its weight!  Presently the girl forces herself to become calm and deeply earnest; she has made up her mind to make a liberal offer.  \"Fiskman, vill du have ti (ten) skillings?\"  The fiskman, who wears a red nightcap, with a tall hat on the top of it, takes off his head-gear, exposes his bald pate to view, and wipes it with a fishy cotton handkerchief; but he takes no notice whatever of the girl, who now becomes mad--that is to say, she stamps, glares, shakes her pretty little fist at the hard-hearted man, and gasps.  Suddenly she becomes reckless, and makes a wild offer of \"tolve (twelve) skillings.\"  Ha! the mark is hit at last!  The fiskman can hold out no longer. Without saying a word, he turns quietly round and hands up the fish. The girl, without a word, stoops down and pays for them, and then goes off in triumph, for her energy has been successful; she _has_ got the fish a little cheaper than she had expected.  Suppose twenty or thirty such scenes going on at once, and you have a faint idea of the Bergen fish-market.  It was just before the termination of the bargain which has been described that Fred Temple and Sam Sorrel arrived on the scene.  The artist was busy with his sketch-book in one minute.  \"Sam,\" said Fred, touching his friend's arm, \"look here, sketch me yonder girl, like a good fellow.\"  \"Which girl; the one with the nose?\"  \"If you see one _without_ a nose,\" retorted Fred, \"I'll be glad to have a portrait of her too.\"  \"Nay, but really, I do see one with such a long red nose that--\"  \"Well, well,\" interrupted Fred impatiently, \"it's not _her.  Do_ look to where I am pointing; see, the stout pretty little woman who is talking so fiercely to that fisherman.\"  \"Oh, I see!\" exclaimed Sam, who began to take her portrait without delay.  Meanwhile Fred was observant.  At first he was much amused by the scene before him, and continued to gaze with interest at one group after another.  In a short time his curiosity was awakened by a handsome Norwegian youth, whose gaze was fixed with intense earnestness on the maiden whom Sam was sketching.  When the girl had concluded her bargain and gone away, he observed that the youth, who appeared to be a fisherman from his dress, went after her.  Without well knowing what he did, and without any very definite intentions, Fred Temple followed them, and left his friend busy with his pencil.  The Norwegian youth soon overtook the girl, who at once received him with a bright smile, and held out her hand.  The two then went on together, turned to the left, and followed a winding road, which led up the side of the mountain.  They appeared to converse earnestly as they went.  Fred still followed them, but in a few minutes they paused in front of a small white house, with a green door, so he was now compelled to pass them.  As he did so, it suddenly occurred to his mind that he was acting a mean, contemptible part in following them thus.  He blushed as he thought of this, and passed quickly forward, intending to deny his curiosity and take a ramble.  He could not help observing, however, that the girl was weeping, and that the youth did not look happy by any means.  Having gained the brow of an eminence which overlooked the city, Fred sat down behind a rock to admire the beautiful scenery and to ponder what he had seen.  While he was thus engaged, he heard the voices of two men who approached on the other side of the rock, and did not observe him.  They talked loud, in the Norse language.  Fred understood enough of it to make out their meaning pretty well.  \"I tell you what it is, Hans,\" said one, \"give her up.  You have no chance of gaining the required sum for many years, and it's a hard case to keep a poor girl waiting.  Give her up, man, and don't go on like a silly love-sick boy.\"  \"Give her up!\" cried he who was called Hans,--\"give her up!  Ah! my friend Ole, I did not expect such counsel from thee.  But I tell thee flatly I will _not_ give her up.  She loves me; I love her!  Sweet Raneilda! nothing but death shall separate us!\"  \"A very pretty sentiment,\" retorted Old, \"but pray, what do you mean to do?\"  \"I have decided that,\" replied Hans; \"I will fish all winter in the deep sea, and all summer I will--\"  \"Well, what will you?\"  \"Alas!  I know not.  Would that I were a pilot, but I am not.\"  \"But you know the coast as well as any pilot,\" said 016.  \"True, but who would trust me--an unknown boy?\" replied Hans sadly.  There was silence for a few minutes; then Ole said: \"How much money do you require to pay for your father's farm and set yourself up?\"  \"Two hundred dollars,\" [The dollar is equal to about 4 shillings and 6 pence sterling] answered Hans.  \"A goodly sum,\" said Ole despondingly.  \"No, no, Hans, give her up, boy, give her up.  It is the advice of an oldish man and a true friend.\"  \"It is the advice of an ass,\" retorted Hans fiercely.  \"Go, my true friend,--when I want your advice I will ask it.\"  The youth flung off from his friend, and came suddenly on Fred Temple, who rose and saluted him.  \"This is a splendid city of yours, Hans,\" said he.  \"You know my name, and you speak Norse,\" exclaimed the youth in surprise.  \"I know your name, Hans, because I heard your friend mention it, and I can speak a little Norse because I have studied it.  I have come to stay in Old Norway for a few months, and would like to get a little information about it from some one.  Are you a busy man just now?\"  \"No, not very busy,\" said Hans, with a disconcerted look.  \"Then, could you call on me this afternoon?  I live in Madame Sontoom's house.\"  \"I will come,\" said Hans, whose face beamed with good-humour.  \"Good; I shall expect you.  Farewell.\"  \"Farvel,\" replied Hans.  "]]]
