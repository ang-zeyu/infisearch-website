This, however, had the effect of restoring confidence to the natives, who lay for some time gazing at the ship from a considerable distance.  They had evidently profited by their short experience in this new style of warfare, for, observing that the terrible iron shower came thundering only from the _sides_ of the ship, they made their next attack on the bow and stern--advancing with much daring, and throwing their stones with great violence and good aim, insomuch that some more of the men were severely hurt.  There is no saying what might have been the end of this fight, had not a lucky cannon-shot, fired from one of the great guns that had been run out at the bow, hit the canoe of the savage chief, and cut it in two.  A result so tremendous had the effect of filling the hearts of the savages with terror.  Every canoe turned tail and made for the shore in dire confusion, while the people who had crowded the beach took to their heels and ran over the hills in the utmost haste, as if they felt their only safety lay in placing the mountains between them and the terrible strangers in the big canoe.  In half an hour not a single canoe was to be seen!  Captain Wallis now hoped that the natives would feel his immense superiority, and cease a useless contest, but he was mistaken.  He was not yet done with them.  They were a very determined set of men.  Soon after this fight they were observed making preparations for a renewed attack.  They could be seen pouring over the hills in all directions, and lurking in the thickets, while, round the point, numbers of war-canoes came paddling to the beach, where fresh warriors and bags of stones were embarked.  It was evident that a grand attack was to be made; so Wallis prepared to repel it.  Soon after, the bay was crowded with canoes as they paddled straight and swift toward the ship.  At once the great guns opened with terrible effect, and so tremendous a fire was kept up that the entire flotilla was almost instantly dispersed.  Many of the canoes were run ashore and deserted; others fled round the point, and the savages took to the woods.  Into these the fire was then directed, and the natives, who doubtless imagined that no danger could penetrate from such a distance into the heart of their thick bushes, were driven, astonished and horrified, up a hill on which thousands of women and children had taken up their position to witness the fight.  Here they deemed themselves quite safe, but Captain Wallis resolved to show them that they were not so.  He thought that the best thing he could do would be to inspire them with a wholesome dread of his tremendous artillery, so he ordered the guns to be fired at the crowded hill.  The shots tore up the earth near a tree under which a dense crowd was collected.  It need scarcely be added that the whole host fled on the wings of terror, and in less than two minutes not a man, woman, or child was to be seen.  The natives now at length submitted.  Not many hours after the close of this fight, a few of them came down to the beach carrying green boughs which they stuck into the sand, and placed beside them a peace-offering of hogs and dogs and bundles of native cloth.  Of course Wallis was right glad to accept it, and in return gave them presents of hatchets, nails, and other things.  Peace was now thoroughly established, and the two parties engaged in amicable traffic with as much good-will as if they had neither quarrelled nor fought.  The queen of the island visited the ship, and from that time till the _Dolphin_ left everything went smoothly.  The ignorance of the natives as to the relative value of various metals was curiously shown one day.  In order to find out what things they liked best, Captain Wallis spread before them a coin called a johannes, a guinea, a crown piece, a Spanish dollar, a few shillings, some new halfpence, and two large nails, and made a sign to them to help themselves.  The nails were first seized with great eagerness, and then a few of the glittering new halfpence, but the silver and gold lay neglected!  The friendship thus established continued to increase as long as Wallis remained there, and when at length he took his departure the natives exhibited every sign of extreme regret--the queen especially was inconsolable, and wept bitterly when she bade them farewell.  Such were a few of the scenes that occurred at the discovery of Tahiti, an island which has since become famous as the scene of the residence of the mutineers of the _Bounty_, and the field of much earnest and deeply interesting missionary labour.    CHAPTER SIX.  CAPTAIN COOK'S VISIT TO TAHITI.  Less than two years after the discovery of Tahiti by Wallis, Captain Cook arrived in the _Endeavour_ at the same island.  He first saw its high mountains rise on the horizon on the 11th of June 1769, and soon afterwards a few canoes came off to the ship, but the natives were timid at first.  They evidently had not forgotten the thundering guns and crashing shot of the _Dolphin_.  In every canoe there were young plantains and branches of trees, which latter were intended as tokens of peace and friendship.  The people in one of the canoes ventured to the ship, and handed these branches up the side, making signals at the same time with great earnestness.  At first the sailors were unable to make out their meaning, but at length, guessing that they wished those symbols to be placed in some conspicuous part of the ship, they immediately stuck them about the rigging, upon which the natives expressed the greatest satisfaction.  Cook then purchased the cargoes of the canoes, consisting of cocoa-nuts and various kinds of fruits, which, after their long voyage, were most acceptable.  Next morning the _Endeavour_ was safely anchored in a bay called by the natives Matavai.  Here the visitors were received with much kindness. The natives regarded them with great respect and awe; the first man who approached them crouching so low that he almost crept on his hands and knees.  Then two of the chiefs came forward, and each selected his friend.  One chose Cook, and the other selected Mr Banks, and each, taking off the greater part of his clothes, put them solemnly on his chosen friend.  On visiting their houses afterwards, they passed through delightful groves of trees which were loaded with cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit. These were found to be most excellent food.  Before becoming quite ripe the liquid inside the cocoa-nut is said to resemble lemonade, when riper it is more like milk; and the bread-fruit nut, when properly dressed, is like the crumb of wheaten bread; so that it may be said of those favoured regions, with some degree of truth, that the people find something like bread and milk growing on the trees!  There is indeed little occasion there for men to work.  The fruits of the earth grow luxuriantly in a wild state; hence the natives, although a strong and active race, are habitually indolent.  It has been proved, however, that when the blessed influence of the Christian religion is brought to bear on them, the South-Sea islanders are, in mind and body, good specimens of mankind.  One of the houses visited by Cook, in company with Messrs. Banks and Monkhouse, Dr Solander and others, on his first landing, was that of Tootahah, a middle-aged man, who seemed to be a person of rank.  He received them hospitably, spread mats for the party, desired them to sit down by his side, and gave them an excellent dinner of bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, plantains, and fish--the latter raw as well as dressed. Cook naturally preferred his fish cooked, but the natives seemed to relish it raw!  Thereafter Tootahah presented Mr Banks and Captain Cook with a cock and hen, which curious gifts they accepted with many thanks, and in return gave Tootahah a laced silk neckcloth and a pocket handkerchief, in which he immediately dressed himself with immense satisfaction.  Mr Banks seems to have been a favourite with the savage ladies, for they plied him earnestly with cocoa-nut milk.  He, as well as Cook, received a further gift of native cloth, which, although rough in texture, was agreeably perfumed.  Beads and other ornaments were presented to the women, and altogether the new friends were becoming mutually delighted with each other when a sudden interruption to the harmonious meeting was caused by the discovery that some of the savages had acquired the art of picking pockets.  A snuff-box belonging to Mr Monkhouse disappeared, and an opera-glass in a shagreen case, the property of Dr Solander, vanished. To pass over a first act of this kind lightly would have led to interminable pilferings and quarrellings.  Mr Banks therefore started up angrily and struck the butt of his musket violently on the ground. Whereupon the most of the natives were panic-stricken, and darted out of the hut with the utmost precipitation.  The chief endeavoured to appease the wrath of his guests by offering them gifts of cloth; but they were not thus to be silenced.  They insisted on the restoration of the stolen articles, so the chief went out and shortly after returned with a beaming countenance--he had found them both; but his countenance fell when, on opening the case of the opera-glass, the glass itself was not there.  With immense energy he resumed his detective duties, and was so fortunate as to recover the glass in a short time.  Thus peace was restored, and the natives were taught to feel that their propensity to steal would prove a source of great annoyance and some danger to them, should they venture to give way to it in future.  Soon after this Cook selected a spot on the beach, not far from the ship, and, pitching his tent there, began to arrange for making the astronomical observations which had brought him to the South Seas.  They had not remained long, however, before they found that the islanders were all addicted to stealing.  Cook tells us that men and women of all ranks were the \"ar"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23267"],["title","The Cannibal Islands: Captain Cook's Adventure in the South Seas (#6)"],["body","thieves upon the face of the earth,\" yet they seemed to feel that the act of theft was wrong, for if charged with being guilty when they were in reality innocent, they were often moved to passionate indignation.  One day, when a large number of natives visited the ship, the chiefs employed themselves in stealing what they could in the cabin, while their dependants were no less industrious in other parts of the ship. They snatched up everything that it was possible for them to secrete till they got on shore.  Two knives had been lost on shore, one of them belonging to Mr Banks, who taxed a man named Tubourai Tamaide, whom he suspected, with the theft.  The man denied it stoutly, but upon Mr Banks saying firmly that, no matter who had taken it, he was determined to have it back, another native, feeling alarmed for his own safety, stepped forward and produced a rag in which three knives were tied up. One belonged to Dr Solander, another to Captain Cook; the owner of the third was not known.  Mr Banks continued to charge Tubourai Tamaide with the theft of his knife, and the poor man continued to deny it indignantly.  Not long after, it was discovered to have been mislaid by Mr Banks's own servant, who at length found it.  Upon this demonstration of his innocence, Tubourai expressed strong emotions of mind.  The fellow was, doubtless, as great a thief as the rest of his comrades, but on this occasion he felt himself to be an injured innocent, and refused to be comforted until Mr Banks expressed great sorrow for his unjust accusation, and made him a few trifling presents, whereupon he immediately forgot his wrongs and was perfectly reconciled!  In his dealings with these natives Captain Cook invariably acted with the gentleness, firmness, and wisdom of a truly great man, and at all times treated evil-doers with impartial justice.  One day a chief came to the tent on the beach in a state of intense excitement, and, hastily seizing Mr Banks by the arm, made signs that he should follow him.  Mr Banks immediately complied, and soon came to a place where they found the ship's butcher with a reaping-hook in his hand.  Here the chief stopped, and in a transport of rage explained, as well as he could by signs, that the butcher had threatened to cut his wife's throat with the hook.  Mr Banks assured him that, if he could fully explain the offence, the man should be punished.  Upon this he became calm, and explained that the offender, having taken a fancy to a stone hatchet which lay in his house, had offered to purchase it of his wife for a nail; that she having refused to part with it, he had seized it, and, throwing down the nail, threatened to cut her throat if she made any resistance.  As the nail and hatchet were produced in proof of this charge, and the butcher had little to say in his defence, there was no reason to doubt its truth.  On the matter being reported to Cook, he took the opportunity of the chief and his wives with a number of natives being on board the ship, to call up the butcher, and, after repeating the charge and proof, he gave orders that the man should be punished.  The natives looked on with fixed attention while the man was being stripped and tied up to the rigging, waiting in silent suspense for the event; but as soon as the first stroke was given they interfered with great agitation, earnestly entreating that he might be forgiven.  Cook, however, did not think it advisable to agree to this.  He would not consent, and, when they found that their entreaties were of no avail, they gave vent to their pity in tears.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  SHOWS WHAT VANITY WILL INDUCE MEN AND WOMEN TO DO.  It fills one with wonder to think of the strange and absurd things that men, in all ages and in all parts of the world, have done to themselves in order to improve their personal appearance.  The flat-head Indian of North America squeezes his forehead out of shape; the Eastern beauty blackens her teeth and nails; the Chinaman shaves the hair off his head, leaving a tuft on the top; the Englishman shaves the hair off his face, leaving a tuft on each cheek,--and all of these deluded mortals run thus deliberately in the face of nature, under the impression that by so doing they are improving their personal appearance!  Not to be behindhand, the South-Sea islanders tattoo themselves.  In other words, they prick a multitude of little holes in their skins, and rub into these some colouring matter, which, when thoroughly fixed, cannot again be washed out.  The ornamental devices with which they thus, more or less, cover their persons are sometimes very cleverly and tastefully done, and they would be really admirable if depicted on a piece of wood or a sheet of paper; but when applied to the human body they are altogether ridiculous.  The operation of tattooing is a very painful one; so much so, that a great deal of it cannot be done at one time, and it is said that persons sometimes die during the process.  The inhabitants of nearly all the islands practise it.  Usually it is commenced at the age of eight or ten, and continued at intervals till the individual is between twenty and thirty years of age.  So important and difficult is the art of tattooing, that men devote themselves to it professionally, and these professors are well paid for their work.  Here is an account of the operation.  The professor, having his victim on the ground before him, takes up his instrument of torture.  This consists of a small piece of stick with sharp bones of birds or fishes attached to it.  Having previously sketched with a piece of charcoal the pattern intended to be tattooed, he dips the points of the sharp bones into a colouring matter (which is a beautiful jet black, procured from the kernel of the candle-nut), applies it to the surface of the skin, and strikes it smartly with a piece of stick held in his right hand.  The skin is punctured in this way, and the dye injected.  With the calmness of an operator, and the gravity of an artist, the professor proceeds as long as his patient can endure the pain.  Then he ceases, and when the part is sufficiently recovered, the operation is continued until the device or pattern is finished.  These patterns vary among different islanders.  They consist of circular and curving lines, and representations of palm-trees, animals, etcetera, on the face and body; and to such an extent is tattooing carried, that the whole body is sometimes covered so as nearly to conceal the original colour of the skin.  Mr Ellis, who wrote long after the gallant Cook was in his grave, tells us in his most interesting work on the South-Sea Islands, (Ellis's _Polynesian Researches_), that the inhabitants of Tahiti were more simple in their tattooing, and displayed greater taste and elegance than some of the other islanders.  \"Though some of the figures are arbitrary, such as stars, circles, lozenges, etcetera, the patterns are usually taken from nature, and are often some of the most graceful.  A cocoa-nut tree is a favourite object; and I have often admired the taste displayed in the marking of a chief's leg, on which I have seen a cocoa-nut tree correctly and distinctly drawn; its roots spreading at the heel, its elastic stalk pencilled as it were along the tendon, and its waving plume gracefully spread out on the broad part of the calf.  Sometimes a couple of stems would be twined up from the heel and divide on the calf, each bearing a plume of leaves.  \"The ornaments round the ankle and upon the instep, make them often appear as if they wore the elegant Eastern sandal.  The sides of the legs are sometimes tattooed from the ankle upward, which gives the appearance of wearing pantaloons with ornamental seams.  From the lower part of the back, a number of straight, waved, or zigzag lines rise in the direction of the spine, and branch off regularly towards the shoulder.  But, of the upper part of the body, the chest is the most tattooed.  Every variety of figure is to be seen here,--cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees, with convolvulus wreaths hanging round them, boys gathering fruit, men engaged in battle, in the manual exercise, triumphing over a fallen foe; or, as I have frequently seen it, they are represented as carrying a human sacrifice to the temple.  Every kind of animal--goats, dogs, fowls, and fish--may at times be seen on this part of the body; muskets, swords, pistols, clubs, spears, and other weapons of war are also stamped upon their arms and chest.\"  These figures are not all crowded upon the same person, but each man makes a selection according to his fancy.  The women also tattoo their persons, but not to such an extent as the men, and their designs and figures are usually more tasteful.  Cook says that Mr Banks saw this operation performed on the back of a girl about thirteen years old.  The instrument used upon this occasion had thirty teeth; about a hundred strokes were given in the minute, and each stroke drew a little blood.  The girl bore it bravely for about a quarter of an hour; but at the end of that time the pain of so many hundred punctures became unbearable.  She first complained in murmurs, then wept, and at last burst into loud lamentations, earnestly beseeching the operator to stop.  He, however, firmly refused, and when she began to struggle, she was held down by two women, who sometimes soothed and sometimes scolded her, and, now and then, when she became very unruly, gave her a smart blow.  Mr Banks stayed in a neighbouring house an hour, and the operation was not over when he went away, yet it was performed only on one side of the back; the other had been tattooed some time before, and the loins had still to be done.  Tahiti is now one of the civilised islands of the South Seas.  At the time of Cook's visit the natives were absolutely savages.  They lived in a state of partial nakedness, and their manners and customs were of the grossest description.  Their religion and"]]]
