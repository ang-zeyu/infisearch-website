It is thus so easy to make canals in Holland, that the people have been making them for hundreds of years, until now almost the whole country is intersected every where with canals, as other countries are with roads. Almost all the traffic, and, until lately, almost all the travel of the country, has been upon the canals. There are private canals, too, as well as public. A farmer brings home his hay and grain from his fields by water, and when he buys a new piece of land he makes a canal to it, as a Vermont farmer would make a road to a new pasture or wood lot that he had been buying.  Rollo wished very much to see all these things--but there was one question which it puzzled him very much to decide, and that was whether he would rather go to Holland in the summer or in the winter.  \"I am not certain,\" said he to his mother one day, \"whether it would not be better for me to go in the winter.\"  \"It is very cold there in the winter,\" said his mother; \"so I am told.\"  \"That is the very thing,\" said Rollo. \"They have such excellent skating on the canals. I want to see the boats go on the canals, and I want to see the skating, and I don't know which I want to see most.\"  \"Yes,\" said his mother, \"I recollect to have often seen pictures of skating on the Dutch canals.\"  \"And I read, when I was a boy,\" continued Rollo, \"that the women skate to market in Holland.\"  Rollo here observed that his mother was endeavoring to suppress a smile. She seemed to try very hard, but she could not succeed in keeping perfectly sober.  \"What are you laughing at, mother?\" asked Rollo.  Here Mrs. Holiday could no longer restrain herself, but laughed outright.  \"Is it about the Dutch women skating to market?\" asked Rollo.  \"I think they must look quite funny, at any rate,\" said Mrs. Holiday.  What Mrs. Holiday was really laughing at was to hear Rollo talk about \"when he was a boy.\" But the fact was, that Rollo had now travelled about so much, and taken care of himself in so many exigencies, that he began to feel quite like a man. And indeed I do not think it at all surprising that he felt so.  \"Which would you do, mother,\" said Rollo, \"if you were I? Would you rather go in the summer or in the winter?\"  \"I would ask uncle George,\" said Mrs. Holiday.  So Rollo went to find his uncle George.  Rollo was at this time at Morley's Hotel, in London, and he expected to find his uncle George in what is called the coffee room. The coffee room in Morley's Hotel is a very pleasant place. It fronts on one side upon a very busy and brilliant street, and on another upon a large open square, adorned with monuments and fountains. On the side towards the square is a bay window, and near this bay window were two or three small tables, with gentlemen sitting at them, engaged in writing. There were other tables along the sides of the room and at the other windows, where gentlemen were taking breakfast. Mr. George was at one of the tables near the bay window, and was busy writing.  Rollo went to the place, and standing by Mr. George's side, he said in an under tone,--  \"Uncle George.\"  Every body speaks in an under tone in an English coffee room. They do this in order not to interrupt the conversation, or the reading, or the writing of other gentlemen that may be in the room.  \"Wait a moment,\" said Mr. George, \"till I finish this letter.\"  So Rollo turned to the bay window and looked out, in order to amuse himself with what he might observe in the street, till his uncle George should be ready to talk with him.  He saw the fountains in the square, and a great many children playing about the basins. He saw a poor boy at a crossing brushing the pavement industriously with an old broom, and then holding out his hand to the people passing by, in hopes that some of them would give him a halfpenny. He saw a policeman walking slowly up and down on the sidewalk, wearing a glazed hat, and a uniform of blue broadcloth, with his letter and number embroidered on the collar. He saw an elegant carriage drive by, with a postilion riding upon one of the horses, and two footmen in very splendid liveries behind. There was a lady in the carriage, but she appeared old, and though she was splendidly dressed, her face was very plain.  \"I wonder,\" said Rollo to himself, \"how much she would give of her riches and finery if she could be as young and as pretty as my cousin Lucy.\"  \"Now, Rollo,\" said Mr. George, interrupting Rollo's reflections, \"what is the question?\"  \"Why, I want to know,\" said Rollo, \"whether you think we had better go to Holland in the winter or in the summer.\"  \"Is it left to you to decide?\" asked Mr. George.  \"Why, no,\" said Rollo, \"not exactly. But mother asked me to consider which I thought was best, and so I want to know your opinion.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George, \"go on and argue the case. After I have heard it argued I will decide.\"  Rollo then proceeded to explain to his uncle the advantages, respectively, of going in the summer and in the winter. After hearing him, Mr. George thought it would be decidedly better to go in the summer.  \"You see,\" said he, \"that the only advantage of going in the winter is to see the skating. That is very important, I know. I should like to see the Dutch women skating to market myself, very much. But then, in the winter you could see very little of the canals, and the wind mills, and all the other hydraulic operations of the country. Every thing would be frozen up solid.\"  \"Father says that he can't go now very well,\" continued Rollo, \"but that I may go with you if you would like to go.\"  Mr. George was just in the act of sealing his letter as Rollo spoke these words; but he paused in the operation, holding the stick of sealing wax in one hand and the letter in the other, as if he was reflecting on what Rollo had said.  \"If we only had some one else to go with us,\" said Mr. George.  \"Should not we two be enough?\" asked Rollo.  \"Why, you see,\" said Mr. George, \"when we get into Holland we shall not understand one word of the language.\"  \"What language do they speak?\" asked Rollo.  \"Dutch,\" said Mr. George, \"and I do not know any Dutch.\"  \"Not a word?\" asked Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George, \"not a word. Ah, yes! I know one word. I know that _dampschiff_ means steamboat. _Damp_, I suppose, means steam.\"  Then Rollo laughed outright. Dampskiff, he said, was the funniest name for steamboat that he ever heard.  \"Now, when we don't know a word of the language,\" added Mr. George, \"we cannot have any communication with the people of the country, but shall be confined entirely to each other. Now, do you think that you could get along with having nobody but me to talk to you for a whole fortnight?\"  \"Yes, indeed!\" said Rollo. \"But then, uncle George,\" he continued, \"how are you going to get along at the hotels without knowing how to speak to the people at all?\"  \"By signs and gestures,\" said Mr. George, laughing. \"Could not you make a sign for something to eat?\"  \"O, yes,\" said Rollo; and he immediately began to make believe eat, moving his hands as if he had a knife and fork in them.  \"And what sign would you make for going to bed?\" asked Mr. George.  Here Rollo laid his head down to one side, and placed his hand under it, as if it were a pillow, and then shut his eyes.  \"That is the sign for going to bed,\" said Rollo. \"A deaf and dumb boy taught it to me.\"  \"I wish he had taught you some more signs,\" said Mr. George. \"Or I wish we had a deaf and dumb boy here to go with us. Deaf and dumb people can get along excellently well where they do not understand the language, because they know how to make so many signs.\"  \"O, we can make up the signs as we go along,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"I don't think that we shall have any great difficulty about that. But then it would be pleasanter to go in a little larger party. Two people are apt to get tired of each other, when there is nobody else that they can speak a single word to for a whole fortnight. I don't think that I should get tired of you. What I am afraid of is, that you would get tired of me.\"  There was a lurking smile on Mr. George's face as he said this.  \"O, uncle George!\" said Rollo, \"that is only your politeness. But then if you really think that we ought to have some more company, perhaps the Parkmans are going to Holland, and we might go with them.\"  \"I would not make a journey with the Parkmans,\" said Mr. George, \"if they would pay all my expenses, and give me five sovereigns a day.\"  \"Why, uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo; \"I thought you liked Mr. Parkman very much.\"  \"So I do,\" said Mr. George. \"It is his wife that I would not go with.\"  \"O, uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo again.  Rollo was very much surprised at hearing this declaration; and it was very natural that he should be surprised, for Mrs. Parkman was a young and beautiful lady, and she was very kindhearted and very amiable in her disposition. Mr. Parkman, too, was very young. He had been one of Mr. George's college classmates. He had been married only a short time before he left America, and he was now making his bridal tour.  Mr. George thought that Mrs. Parkman was very beautiful and very intelligent, but he considered her a very uncomfortable travelling companion. I think he judged her somewhat too harshly. But this was one of Mr. George's faults. He did not like the ladies very much, and the faults which he observed in them, from time to time, he was prone to condemn much too harshly.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER II.  A BAD TRAVELLING COMPANION.   The reason why Mr. George did not like his friend Mr. Parkman's young wife was not because of any want of natural attractiveness in her person, or of amiableness in her disposition,--for she was beautiful, accomplished, and kindhearted. But for all this, from a want of consideration not uncommon among young ladies who are not much experienced in the world, she was a very "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22972"],["title","Rollo in Holland (#2)"],["body","travelling companion.  It is the duty of a gentleman who has a lady under his charge, in making a journey, to consult her wishes, and to conform to them so far as it is possible, in determining where to go, and in making all the general arrangements of the journey. But when these points are decided upon, every thing in respect to the practical carrying into effect of the plans thus formed should be left to the gentleman, as the executive officer of the party; just as in respect to affairs relating to housekeeping, or any thing else relating to a lady's department, the lady should be left free to act according to her own judgment and taste in arranging details, while in the general plans she conforms to the wishes of her husband. For a lady, when travelling, to be continually making suggestions and proposals about the baggage or the conveyances, and expressing dissatisfaction, or wish for changes in this, that, or the other, is as much a violation of propriety as it would be for the gentleman to go into the kitchen, and there propose petty changes in respect to the mode of cooking the dinner--or to stand by his wife at her work table, and wish to have her thread changed from this place to that--or to have some different stitch to be used in making a seam. A lady very naturally feels disturbed if she finds that her husband does not have confidence enough in her to trust her with such details.  \"I will make or mend for you whatever you may desire,\" she might say, \"and I will get for your dinner any thing that you ask for; but in the way of doing it you ought to leave every thing to my direction. It is better to let me have my own way, even if your way is better than mine. For in matters of direction there ought always to be only one head, even if it is not a very good one.\"  And in the same manner a gentleman might say when travelling with a lady,--  \"I will arrange the journey to suit your wishes as far as is practicable, and will go at such times and by such conveyances as you may desire. I will also, at all the places where we stop, take you to visit such objects of interest and curiosity as you wish to see. But then when it comes to the details of the arrangements to be made,--the orders to servants and commissioners, the determination of the times for setting out, and the bargains to be made with coachmen and innkeepers,--it is best to leave all those things to me; for it always makes confusion to have two persons give directions at the same time.\"  To say this would be right in both cases,--there must always be _one_ to command. A great many families are kept in continual confusion by there being two or more ladies who consider themselves more or less at the head of it--as, for instance, a wife and a sister, or two sisters and a mother. Napoleon used to say that _one_ bad general was better than _two_ good ones; so important is it in war to have unity of command. It is not much less important in social life.  Mrs. Parkman did not understand this principle. Mr. George had seen an example of her mode of management a day or two before, in taking a walk with her and her husband in London. They were going to see the tunnel under the Thames, which was three or four miles down the river from Morley's Hotel, where they were all lodging.  \"Which way would you like to go?\" asked Mr. Parkman.  \"Is there more than one way?\" asked his wife.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"we can take a Hansom cab, and drive down through the streets, or we can walk down to the river side, and there take a boat. The boats are a great deal the cheapest, and the most amusing; but the cab will be the most easy and comfortable, and the most genteel. We shall have to walk nearly half a mile before we get to the landing of the boats.\"  \"Is there much difference in the price?\" asked Mrs. Parkman.  \"Not enough to be of any consequence,\" replied her husband. \"It will make a difference of about one and a half crown; for by the boats it would be only two or three pence, while by the cab it will be as many shillings. But that is of no consequence. We will go whichever way you think you would enjoy the most.\"  \"You may decide for me,\" said Mrs. Parkman. \"I'll leave it entirely to you. It makes no difference to me.\"  \"Then, on the whole, I think we will try the boat,\" said Mr. Parkman; \"it will be so much more amusing, and we shall see so much more of London life. Besides, we shall often read and hear about the steamers on the Thames when we return to America, and it will be well for us to have made one voyage in them. And, Mr. George, will you go with us?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  So they all left the hotel together, and commenced their walk towards the bridge where the nearest landing stage for the Thames boats lay.  They had not gone but a very short distance before Mrs. Parkman began to hang rather heavily upon her husband's arm, and asked him whether it was much farther that they would have to walk.  \"O, yes,\" said Mr. Parkman. \"I told you that we should have to walk about half a mile.\"  \"Then we shall get all tired out,\" said his wife, \"and we want our strength for walking through the tunnel. It does not seem to be worth while to take all this trouble just to save half a crown.\"  Mr. Parkman, though he had only been married a little more than a month, felt something like a sense of indignation rising in his breast, that his wife should attribute to him such a motive for choosing the river, after what he had said on the subject. But he suppressed the feeling, and only replied quietly,--  \"O, let us take a cab then, by all means. I hope you don't suppose that I was going to take you by the boat to save any money.\"  \"I thought you said that you would save half a crown,\" rejoined his wife.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"I did, it is true.\"  Mr. Parkman was too proud to defend himself from such an imputation, supported by such reasoning as this; so he only said, \"We will go by a cab. We will take a cab at the next stand.\"  Mr. George instantly perceived that by this change in the plan, he was made one too many for the party, since only two can ride conveniently in a Hansom cab.[2] So he said at once, that he would adhere to the original plan, and go by water.  [Footnote 2: A Hansom cab is made like an old-fashioned chaise, only that it is set very low, so that it is extremely easy to step in and out of it, and the seat of the driver is high up behind. The driver drives _over the top of the chaise_! Thus the view for the passengers riding inside is wholly unobstructed, and this makes the Hansom cab a very convenient and pleasant vehicle for two persons to ride in, through the streets of a new and strange town.]  \"But, first,\" said he, \"I will go with you to the stand, and see you safe in a cab.\"  So they turned into another street, and presently they came to a stand. There was a long row of cabs there, of various kinds, all waiting to be employed. Among them were several Hansoms.  Mr. Parkman looked along the line to select one that had a good horse. The distance was considerable that they had to go, and besides Mr. Parkman knew that his wife liked always to go fast. So when he had selected the best looking horse, he made a signal to the driver. The driver immediately left the stand, and drove over to the sidewalk where Mr. Parkman and his party were waiting.  Mr. Parkman immediately opened the door of the cab to allow his wife to go in; but she, instead of entering, began to look scrutinizingly into it, and hung back.  \"Is this a nice cab?\" said she. \"It seems to me that I have seen nicer cabs than this.  \"Let us look,\" she added, \"and see if there is not a better one somewhere along the line.\"  The cabman, looking down from his exalted seat behind the vehicle, said that there was not a nicer cab than his in London.  \"O, of course,\" said Mrs. Parkman. \"They always say that. But _I_ can find a nicer one, I'm sure, somewhere in the line.\"  So saying she began to move on. Mr. Parkman gave the cabman a silver sixpence--which is equal to a New York shilling--to compensate him for having been called off from his station, and then followed his wife across the street to the side where the cabs were standing. Mrs. Parkman led the way all down the line, examining each hack as she passed it; but she did not find any one that looked as well as the first.  [Illustration: THE HANSOM CAB.]  \"After all,\" said she, \"we might as well go back and take the first one.\" So she turned and began to retrace her steps--the two gentlemen accompanying her. But when they got back they found that the one which Mr. Parkman had first selected was gone. It had been taken by another customer.  Mr. George was now entirely out of patience; but he controlled himself sufficiently to suppress all outward manifestation of it, only saying that he believed he would not wait any longer.  \"I will go down to the river,\" said he, \"and take a boat, and when you get a carriage you can go by land. I will wait for you at the entrance to the tunnel.\"  So he went away; and as soon as he turned the corner of the street he snapped his fingers and nodded his head with the air of a man who has just made a very lucky escape.  \"I thank my stars,\" said he to himself, \"that I have not got such a lady as that to take care of. Handsome as she is, I would not have her for a travelling companion on any account whatever.\"  It was from having witnessed several such exhibitions of character as this that Mr. George had expressed himself so strongly to Rollo on the subject of joining Mr. Parkman and his wife in making the tour of Holland.  But notwithstanding Mr. George's determination that he would not travel in company with such a lady, it seemed to be decreed that he should do so, for he left London about a week after this to go to Holland with Rollo alone; and though he postponed setting out for several days, so as to allow Mr. and Mrs. Parkman time to get well under way before them, he happened to fall in"]]]
