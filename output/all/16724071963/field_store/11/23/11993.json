He had no German mistresses.  He did not care about fat women.  He was devoted to his mother--perhaps a good deal too devoted, but even the excess of devotion might have been pardonable in the public opinion of England; certainly it was only his own weakness and perversity that made it for a while not pardonable.  He was of the country squire's order of mind; his tastes were wholly those of the stolid, well-intentioned, bucolic country squire.  He would probably have been a very respectable and successful sovereign if only he had not been plagued by the ambition to be a king.  It is curious to remember that the accession of George {5} the Third was generally and joyfully welcomed.  A hopeful people, having endured with increasing dislike two sovereigns of the House of Hanover, were quite prepared to believe that a third prince was rich in all regal qualities; in all public and private virtues.  It would, perhaps, have been unreasonable on the part of any dispassionate observer of public affairs to anticipate that a third George would make a worse monarch than his namesakes and immediate predecessors.  The dispassionate observer might have maintained that there were limits to kingly misgovernment in a kingdom endowed with a Constitution and blessed with a measure of Parliamentary representation, and that those limits had been fairly reached by the two German princes who ruled reluctantly enough over the fortunes of England.  This same dispassionate observer might reasonably, assuming him to possess familiar knowledge of certain facts, have hazarded the prediction that George the Third would be a better king than his grandfather and his great-grandfather.  He was certainly a better man.  There was so much of a basis whereupon to build a hope of better things.  The profligacy of his ancestors had not apparently vitiated his blood and judgment.  His young life had been a pure life.  He was in that way a pattern to princes.  He had been, which was rare with his race, a good son.  He was to be--and there was no more rare quality in one of his stock--a good husband, a good father.  He was in his way a good friend to his friends.  He was sincerely desirous to prove himself a good king to his people.  The youth of George the Third had passed under somewhat agitated conditions.  George the Second's straight-forward hatred for his son's wife opened a great gulf between the Court and Leicester House, which no true courtier made any effort to bridge.  While the young Prince knew, in consequence, little or nothing of the atmosphere of St. James's or the temper of those who breathed that atmosphere, attempts were not wanting to sunder him from the influence of his mother.  Some of the noblemen and clergymen to whom the early instruction of the young {6} Prince was entrusted labored with a persistency which would have been admirable in some other cause to sever him not merely from all his father's friends but even from his father's wife.  There was indeed a time when their efforts almost succeeded in alienating the young Prince from his mother.  The wildest charges of Jacobitism were brought against the immediate servants of the Princess, charges which those who made them wholly failed to substantiate.  The endeavor to remove the Prince from the tutelage of his mother was abandoned.  The education of the Prince was committed to more sympathetic care.  The change had its advantage in keeping George in the wholesome atmosphere of Leicester House instead of exposing him to the temptations of a profligate Court.  It had its disadvantages in leaving him entirely under the influence of a man to whose guidance, counsel, and authority the Princess Dowager absolutely submitted herself.  [Sidenote: 1760--Lord Bute]  Observers of the lighter sort are pleased to insist upon the trifles which have the most momentous influence upon the fortunes of peoples and the fates of empires.  A famous and facile French playwright derived the downfall of a favorite and of a political revolution from the spilling of a glass of water.  There are times when the temptation to pursue this thread of fancy is very great.  Suppose, for instance, it had not chanced to rain on a certain day at Clifden, when a cricket match was being played in which Frederick, Prince of Wales, happened to be interested.  A fretted Prince would not have had to retire to his tent like Achilles, would not have insisted on a game of whist to cheer his humor.  There would have been no difficulty in forming a rubber. There would have been no need to seek for a fourth hand.  No wistful gentleman-in-attendance seeking the desirable would have had to ask the aid of a strange nobleman perched in an apothecary's chariot.  Had this strange nobleman not been so sought and found, had the apothecary not been wealthy enough to keep a chariot, and friendly enough to offer a poor Scotch gentleman a seat in it, it is possible that the {7} American Colonies might yet form portion and parcel of the British Empire, that Chatham's splendid dreams might have become still more splendid realities, that the name of Wilkes might never have emerged from an obscurity of debauch to association with the name of liberty. For the nobleman who made the fourth hand in the Prince of Wales's rubber was unfortunately a man of agreeable address and engaging manners, manners that pleased infinitely the Prince of Wales, and cemented a friendship most disastrous in its consequences to England, to the English people, and to an English king.  The name of the engaging nobleman was Lord Bute.  At the time of this memorable game of whist Lord Bute was thirty-six years old.  He was well educated, well read, tall of body, pleasing of countenance, quick in intelligence, and curious in disposition.  These qualities won the heart of the Prince of Wales, and lifted the young Scotch nobleman from poverty and obscurity to prominence and favor. The Prince appointed Bute a Lord of the Bedchamber and welcomed him to his most intimate friendship.  The death of the Prince of Wales two years later had no disastrous effect upon the rising fortunes of the favorite.  The influence which Bute had exercised over the mind of Frederick he exercised over the mind of Frederick's wife and over the mind of Frederick's heir.  Scandal whispered, asserted, insisted then and has insisted ever since, that the influence which Lord Bute exercised over the Princess of Wales was not merely a mental influence. How far scandal was right or wrong there is no means, there probably never will be any means, of knowing.  Lord Bute's defenders point to his conspicuous affection for his wife, Edward Wortley Montagu's only daughter, in contravention of the scandal.  Undoubtedly Bute was a good husband and a good father.  Whether the scandal was justified or not, the fact that it existed, that it was widely blown abroad and very generally believed, was enough.  As far as the popularity of the Princess was concerned it might as well have been justified.  For years no caricature was so popular as that which displayed the Boot and the {8} Petticoat, the ironic popular symbols of Lord Bute and the Princess.  By whatever means Lord Bute gained his influence over the Princess of Wales, he undoubtedly possessed the influence and used it with disastrous effect.  He moulded the feeble intelligence of the young Prince George; he guided his thoughts, directed his studies in statecraft, and was to all intents and purposes the governor of the young Prince's person.  The young Prince could hardly have had a worse adviser.  Bute was a man of many merits, but his defects were in the highest degree dangerous in a person who had somehow become possessed of almost absolute power.  In the obscurity of a private life, the man who had borne poverty with dignity at an age when poverty was peculiarly galling to one of his station might have earned the esteem of his immediate fellows.  In the exaltation of a great if an unauthorized rule, and later in the authority of an important public office, his defects were fatal to his fame and to the fortunes of those who accepted his sway.  For nearly ten years, from the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, to the death of George the Second, Bute was all-powerful in his influence over the mother of the future King and over the future King himself.  When the young Prince came to the throne Lord Bute did not immediately assume ostensible authority.  He remained the confidential adviser of the young King until 1761.  In 1761 he took office, assuming the Secretaryship of State resigned by Lord Holdernesse.  From a secretaryship to the place of Prime Minister was but a step, and a step soon taken.  Although he did not occupy office very long, he held it long enough to become perhaps the most unpopular Prime Minister England has ever had.  [Sidenote: 1760--Hannah Lightfoot and Lady Sarah Lennox]  The youth of George the Third was starred with a strange romance.  The full truth of the story of Hannah Lightfoot will probably never be known.  What is known is sufficiently romantic without the additions of legend.  Hannah Lightfoot was a beautiful Quaker girl, the daughter of a decent tradesman in Wapping.  Association with the family of an uncle, a linendraper, who lived near the {9} Court, brought the girl into the fashionable part of the town.  The young Prince saw her by accident somehow, somewhere, in the early part of 1754, and fell in love with her.  From that moment the girl disappears from certain knowledge, and legend busies itself with her name.  It is asserted that she was actually married to the young Prince; that William Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham, was present at the marriage; that she bore the Prince several children.  Other versions have it that she was married as a mere form to a man named Axford, who immediately left her, and that after this marriage she lived with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23471"],["title","A History of the Four Georges and of William IV, Volume III (#2)"],["body",".  She is supposed to have died in a secluded villa in Hackney.  It is said that not only the wife of George the Third but the wife of George the Fourth believed that the marriage had taken place.  We must not attach too much importance to a story which in itself is so very unlikely.  It is in the last degree improbable that a statesman like Pitt would have lent himself to so singular a proceeding.  Even if an enamoured young Prince were prepared to sanction his affections by a marriage, he would scarcely have found an assistant in the ablest politician of the age. The story of the Axford marriage is far more probable.  If Hannah Lightfoot had been married to George she would have been Queen of England, for there was no Royal Marriage Act in those days.  Another and more famous romance is associated with the youth of George the Third.  Lady Sarah Lennox, the youngest daughter of the second Duke of Richmond, was one of the most beautiful women of her time.  The writers of the day rave about her, describe her as \"an angel,\" as lovelier than any Magdalen by Correggio.  When she was only seventeen years old her beauty attracted the young King, who soon made no secret of his devotion to her.  The new passion divided the Court into two camps.  The House of Lennox was eager to bring about a marriage, which was not then obstructed by the law.  Henry Fox, one of the most ambitious men of that time or of any time, was Lady Sarah's brother-in-law, and he did his best to promote the marriage.  On the other hand, the {10} party which followed the lead of the Princess Dowager and Lord Bute fought uncompromisingly against the scheme.  The Princess Dowager had everything to lose, Lord Bute had everything to lose, by such an alliance.  The power of the Princess Dowager over the young King would vanish, and the influence of Lord Bute over the Princess Dowager would cease to have any political importance.  Lord Bute did all he could to keep the lovers apart.  Henry Fox did all he could to bring the lovers together.  For lovers they undoubtedly were. George again and again made it plain to those who were in his confidence that he was in love with Lady Sarah, and was anxious to make her his queen; and Lady Sarah, though her heart is said to have been given to Lord Newbottle, was quite ready to yield to the wishes of her family when those wishes were for the crown of England.  On the meadows of Holland House the beautiful girl, loveliest of Arcadian rustics, would play at making hay till her royal lover came riding by to greet her.  But the idyll did not end in the marriage for which Fox and the Lennoxes hoped.  It is said that the King was jealous of Lord Newbottle; it is said that a sense of duty to his place and to his people made him resolve to subdue and sacrifice his own personal feelings.  He offered his hand and his crown to the Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.  Lady Sarah lost both her lovers, the King and Lord Newbottle, who, in the words of Grenville, \"complained as much of her as she did of the King.\"  But she did not remain long unmarried. In 1762 she accepted as husband the famous sporting Baronet Sir Thomas Charles Bunbury, and nineteen years later she married the Hon. George Napier, and became the mother of an illustrious pair of soldier brothers, Sir Charles Napier, the hero of Scinde, and Sir William Napier, perhaps the best military historian since Julius Caesar.  Lady Sarah died in 1826, in her eighty-second year.  In her later years she had become totally blind, and she bore her affliction with a sweet patience.  At her death she is described by the chroniclers of the time as \"probably the last surviving {11} great-grand-daughter of King Charles the Second.\"  A barren honor, surely.  [Sidenote: 1760--Princess Charlotte Sophia]  The young Princess whom George married was in many ways well and even excellently qualified to make a good queen.  It is said that she was discovered for her young husband after a fashion something resembling a tale from the \"Arabian Nights.\"  The Princess Dowager, eager to counteract the fatal effect of the beauty of Lady Sarah Lennox, was anxious to have the young King married as soon as possible.  Her own wishes were in favor of a daughter of the House of Saxe-Gotha, but it is said that fear of a disease hereditary in the family overruled her wishes.  Then, according to the story, a Colonel Graeme, a Scotch gentleman upon whose taste Lord Bute placed great reliance, was sent on a kind of roving embassy to the various little German Courts in search of the ideal bride.  The lady of the quest was, according to the instructions given to Colonel Graeme, to be at once beautiful, healthy, accomplished, of mild disposition, and versed in music, an art to which the King was much devoted.  Colonel Graeme, with this pleasing picture of feminine graces ever in his mind, found the original of the portrait in Charlotte Sophia, the second daughter of Charles Lewis Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.  There is another version of the manner of George's wooing which nullifies the story of Colonel Graeme's romantic mission.  According to this other version George fell in love with his future queen simply from reading a letter written by her.  The tale sounds as romantic as that of the Provencal poet's passion for the portrait of the Lady of Tripoli.  It is true, however, that the letter of Charlotte Sophia was something of the nature of a state paper.  The Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, of which the Princess Charlotte's brother was the sovereign, had been overrun by the troops of the King of Prussia.  The young Princess wrote a letter to the Prussian King, which came to George's notice and inspired him, it is said, with the liveliest admiration for the lady who penned it.  Whatever the actual reason, whether the report of Colonel Graeme or the {12} charms of her epistolary style, the certain thing is that George was married, first by proxy and afterwards in due form, to the young Princess in 1761. The young Princess was not remarkably beautiful.  Even the courtiers of the day, anxious to say their strongest in her praise, could not do much more than commend her eyes and complexion and call her \"a very fine girl,\" while those who were not inclined to flatter said her face was all mouth, and declared, probably untruly, that the young King was at first obviously repelled by the plainness of his wife's appearance. If she was plain, her plainness, as Northcote, the painter, said, was an elegant, not a vulgar plainness, and the grace of her carriage much impressed him.  Walpole found her sensible, cheerful, and remarkably genteel, a not inconsiderable eulogy from him.  She was fairly educated, as the education of princesses went in those days.  She knew French and Italian, knew even a little English.  She had various elegant accomplishments--could draw, and dance, and play, had acquired a certain measure of scientific knowledge, and she had what was better than all these attainments, a good, kindly, sensible nature.  The marriage could hardly be called a popular marriage at first.  Statesmen and politicians thought that the King of England ought to have found some more illustrious consort than the daughter of a poor and petty German House.  The people at large, we are told from a private letter of the time, were \"quite exasperated at her not being handsome,\" beauty in a sovereign being a great attraction to the mass of subjects.  The courtiers in general were amused by, and secretly laughed at, her simple ways and old-fashioned--or at least un-English--manners.  [Sidenote--1761--The Coronation of George the Third]  After the wedding came the coronation, a very resplendent ceremony, which was not free from certain somewhat ludicrous features, and was not denied a certain tragic dignity.  It was enormously expensive. Horace Walpole called it a puppet-show that cost a million.  Loyal London turned out in its thousands.  Surprisingly large sums of money were paid for rooms and scaffolds from which the outdoor sight could be seen, and much larger were paid {13} for places inside the Abbey.  It was very gorgeous, very long, and very fatiguing.  The spectator carried away, with aching senses, a confused memory of many soldiers, of great peers ill at ease in unbecoming habits, of beautiful women beautifully attired, of a blaze of jewels that recalled the story of Aladdin's mine, and of the wonderful effect by which the darkness of Westminster Hall was suddenly illuminated by an ingenious arrangement of sconces that caught fire and carried on the message of light with great rapidity.  The heralds in whose hands the ceremonial arrangements lay bungled their business badly, causing fierce heartburnings by confusions in precedence, and displaying a lamentable ignorance of the names and the whereabouts of many wearers of stately and ancient titles.  When the King expressed his annoyance at some of the blunders, Lord Effingham, the Earl Marshal, offered, for amazing apology, the assurance that the next coronation would be conducted with perfect order, an unfortunate speech, which had, however, the effect of affording the King infinite entertainment.  The one tragic touch in the whole day's work may be legend, but it is legend that might be and that should be truth.  When Dymoke, the King's Champion, rode, in accordance with the antique usage, along Westminster Hall, and flung his glove down in challenge to any one who dared contest his master's right to the throne of England, it is said that some one darted out from the crowd, picked up the glove, slipped back into the press, and disappeared, without being stopped or discovered.  According to one version of the incident, it was a woman who did the deed; according to another it was Charles Edward himself, the Young Pretender--now no longer so very young--who made this last protest on behalf of his lost fortunes and his fallen House.  It is possible, it is even"]]]
