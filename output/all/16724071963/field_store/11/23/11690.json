Ludovick....\" She took his hands in hers; in the darkness, the jewel swung madly on her presumably heaving bosom. \"This is bigger than both of us. It's for Earth.\"  He knew it was his patriotic duty to do as she said; still, he had enjoyed life so much. \"Corisande, wouldn't it be much simpler if we just destroyed your uncle's secret weapon?\"  \"He'd only make another. Don't you see, Ludovick, this is our only chance to save the Belphins, to save humanity.... But, of course, I don't have the right to send you. I'll go myself.\"  \"No, Corisande,\" he sighed. \"I can't let you go. I'll do it.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  Next morning, he set out to warn Belphins. He knew it wasn't much use, but it was all he could do. The first half dozen responded in much the same way the Belphin he had warned the previous day had done, by courteously acknowledging his solicitude and assuring him there was no need for alarm; they knew all about the Flockharts and everything would be all right.  After that, they started to get increasingly huffy--which would, he thought, substantiate the theory that they were all part of one vast coordinate network of identity. Especially since each Belphin behaved as if Ludovick had been repeatedly annoying _him_.  Finally, they refused to get off the walks when he hailed them--which was unheard of, for no Belphin had ever before failed to respond to an Earthman's call--and when he started running along the walks after them, they ran much faster than he could.  At last he gave up and wandered about the city for hours, speaking to neither human nor Belphin, wondering what to do. That is, he knew what he had to do; he was wondering _how_ to do it. He would never be able to reach The Belphin of Belphins. No human being had ever done it. Mieczyslaw and George had died trying to reach him (or it). Even though their intentions had been hostile and Ludovick's would be helpful, there was little chance he would be allowed to reach The Belphin with all the other Belphins against him. What guarantee was there that The Belphin would not be against him, too?  And yet he knew that he would have to risk his life; there was no help for it. He had never wanted to be a hero, and here he had heroism thrust upon him. He knew he could not succeed; equally well, he knew he could not turn back, for his Belphin teacher had instructed him in the meaning of duty.  It was twilight when he approached the Blue Tower. Commending himself to the Infinite Virtue, he entered. The Belphin at the reception desk did not give off the customary smiling expression. In fact, he seemed to radiate a curiously apprehensive aura.  \"Go back, young man,\" he said. \"You're not wanted here.\"  \"I must see The Belphin of Belphins. I must warn him against the Flockharts.\"  \"He has been warned,\" the receptionist told him. \"Go home and be happy!\"  \"I don't trust you or your brothers. I must see The Belphin himself.\"  Suddenly this particular Belphin lost his commanding manners. He began to wilt, insofar as so rigidly constructed a creature could go limp. \"Please, we've done so much for you. Do this for us.\"  \"The Belphin of Belphins did things for us,\" Ludovick countered. \"You are all only his followers. How do I know you are _really_ following him? How do I know you haven't turned against him?\"  Without giving the creature a chance to answer, he strode forward. The Belphin attempted to bar his way. Ludovick knew one Belphin was a myriad times as strong as a human, so it was out of utter futility that he struck.  The Belphin collapsed completely, flying apart in a welter of fragile springs and gears. The fact was of some deeper significance, Ludovick knew, but he was too numbed by his incredible success to be able to think clearly. All he knew was that The Belphin would be able to explain things to him.                       *      *      *      *      *  Bells began to clash and clang. That meant the force barriers had gone up. He could see the shimmering insubstance of the first one before him. Squaring his shoulders, he charged it ... and walked right through. He looked himself up and down. He was alive and entire.  Then the whole thing was a fraud; the barriers were not lethal--or perhaps even actual. But what of Mieczyslaw? And George? And countless rumored others? He would not let himself even try to think of them. He would not let himself even try to think of anything save his duty.  A staircase spiraled up ahead of him. A Belphin was at its foot. Behind him, a barrier iridesced.  \"Please, young man----\" the Belphin began. \"You don't understand. Let me explain.\"  But Ludovick destroyed the thing before it could say anything further, and he passed right through the barrier. He had to get to the top and warn The Belphin of Belphins, whoever or whatever he (or it) was, that the Flockharts had a secret weapon which might be able to annihilate it (or him). Belphin after Belphin Ludovick destroyed, and barrier after barrier he penetrated until he reached the top. At the head of the stairs was a vast golden door.  \"Go no further, Ludovick Eversole!\" a mighty voice roared from within. \"To open that door is to bring disaster upon your race.\"  But all Ludovick knew was that he had to get to The Belphin within and warn him. He battered down the door; that is, he would have battered down the door if it had not turned out to be unlocked. A stream of noxious vapor rushed out of the opening, causing him to black out.  When he came to, most of the vapor had dissipated. The Belphin of Belphins was already dying of asphyxiation, since it was, in fact, a single alien entity who breathed another combination of elements. The room at the head of the stairs had been its tank.  \"You fool....\" it gasped. \"Through your muddle-headed integrity ... you have destroyed not only me ... but Earth's future. I tried to make ... this planet a better place for humanity ... and this is my reward....\"  \"But I don't understand!\" Ludovick wept. \"_Why_ did you let me do it? Why were Mieczyslaw and George and all the others killed? Why was it that I could pass the barriers and they could not?\"  \"The barriers were triggered ... to respond to hostility.... You meant well ... so our defenses ... could not work.\" Ludovick had to bend low to hear the creature's last words: \"There is ... Earth proverb ... should have warned me ... 'I can protect myself ... against my enemies ... but who will protect me ... from my friends'...?\"  The Belphin of Belphins died in Ludovick's arms. He was the last of his race, so far as Earth was concerned, for no more came. If, as they had said themselves, some outside power had sent them to take care of the human race, then that power had given up the race as a bad job. If they were merely exploiting Earth, as the malcontents had kept suggesting, apparently it had proven too dangerous or too costly a venture.                       *      *      *      *      *  Shortly after The Belphin's demise, the Flockharts arrived en masse. \"We won't need your secret weapons now,\" Ludovick told them dully. \"The Belphin of Belphins is dead.\"  Corisande gave one of the rippling laughs he was to grow to hate so much. \"Darling, _you_ were my secret weapon all along!\" She beamed at her \"relatives,\" and it was then he noticed the faint lines of her forehead. \"I told you I could use the power of love to destroy the Belphins!\" And then she added gently: \"I think there is no doubt who is head of 'this family' now.\"  The uncle gave a strained laugh. \"You're going to have a great little first lady there, boy,\" he said to Ludovick.  \"First lady?\" Ludovick repeated, still absorbed in his grief.  \"Yes, I imagine the people will want to make you our first President by popular acclaim.\"  Ludovick looked at him through a haze of tears. \"But I killed The Belphin. I didn't mean to, but ... they must hate me!\"  \"Nonsense, my boy; they'll adore you. You'll be a hero!\"  Events proved him right. Even those people who had lived in apparent content under the Belphins, accepting what they were given and seemingly enjoying their carefree lives, now declared themselves to have been suffering in silent resentment all along. They hurled flowers and adulatory speeches at Ludovick and composed extremely flattering songs about him.  Shortly after he was universally acclaimed President, he married Corisande. He couldn't escape.  \"Why doesn't she become President herself?\" he wailed, when the relatives came and found him hiding in the ruins of the Blue Tower. The people had torn the Tower down as soon as they were sure The Belphin was dead and the others thereby rendered inoperant. \"It would spare her a lot of bother.\"  \"Because she is not The Belphin-slayer,\" the uncle said, dragging him out. \"Besides, she loves you. Come on, Ludovick, be a man.\" So they hauled him off to the wedding and, amid much feasting, he was married to Corisande.                       *      *      *      *      *  He never drew another happy breath. In the first place, now that The Belphin was dead, all the machinery that had been operated by him stopped and no one knew how to fix it. The sidewalks stopped moving, the air conditioners stopped conditioning, the food synthesizers stopped synthesizing, and so on. And, of course, everybody blamed it all on Ludovick--even that year's run of bad weather.  There were famines, riots, plagues, and, after the waves of mob hostility had coalesced into national groupings, wars. It was like the old days again, precisely as described in the textbooks.  In the second place, Ludovick could never forget that, when Corisande had sent him to the Blue Tower, she could not have been sure that her secret weapon would work. Love might _not_ have conquered all--in fact, it was the more likely hypothesis that it wouldn't--and he would have been killed by the first barrier.

So, in thirtieth year of his reign as Dictator of Earth, Ludovick poisoned Corisande--that is, had her poisoned, for by now he had a Minister of Assassination to handle such little matters--and married a very pretty, very young, very affectionate blonde. He wasn't particularly happy with her, either, but at least it was a change.   --EVELYN E."]]]
