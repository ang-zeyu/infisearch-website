Now, come with me part of the way and show me the short cuts. Why, I'm as strong as a lion. You don't suppose a walk of a few miles tires me? Come along, Kit, we are wasting time.\"  In reality, Kitty was charmed beyond words with any move which was to bring Boris on the scene. The moment Boris seemed at all unattainable, he became wonderfully precious in Kitty's eyes. She would, of course, snub him in five minutes after he did arrive, but that really did not matter. The fascination of Annie's secret mission also delighted her much, and she skipped along now by the side of this beautiful lady in a state of high good-humour.  \"I'll show you a lovely short cut,\" she said. \"It will take two miles off the distance. There's a bog, and a sunken ditch, and a wire fence; but you won't mind them, will you?\"  \"Not a bit,\" said Annie, laughter in her eyes.  \"And there's farmer Granger's bull-dog, and perhaps the bull himself may be in the four acre field; but you won't mind,\" continued Kitty.  \"Not a bit, not a bit.\"  \"Well, let's run down into this little dell. I'll start you from the wicket gate at the end of the dell.\"  \"It sounds quite Pilgrim's Progressy,\" said Annie.  \"Annie,\" said Kitty, in an ecstatic whisper, \"is it to be a secret?\"  \"Of course; if you dare to reveal it my knight shall execute vengeance on you.\"  \"Oh, Annie!\" said Kitty, \"I do love you; its so perfectly delicious to have a secret.\"  \"Well, see you keep this one faithfully. Now we have come to the wicket gate. How shall I go? Can I see the bull from here?\"  \"No.\"  \"Can I hear the bull-dog bark?\"  \"No.\"  \"Kitty, you little wretch, you've been trying to frighten me with imaginary dangers. Yes, I see my road. I follow the winding path wherever it leads. Keep a bit of dinner for me, Kitty. I'll be back in a couple of hours.\"  Kitty promised, and Annie started with great vigour on her long walk.  Kitty stood at the stile and watched her. Suddenly she raised a cry.  \"Annie.\"  Annie turned.  \"You'll find Nell at home, too, Annie.\"  \"Is Nell another Lorrimer?\"  \"Yes; the ugly one of the family; the duckling, we call her most times.\"  \"Well, the duckling shall come, too,\" shouted heedless Annie; and Kitty, with the full weight and delirious importance of her secret radiating all over her stout little person, slowly returned to the other members of the picnic party.     CHAPTER VII.  THE STORY BOOK LADY.   Annie found the road hot and the way long. As she said, she was a very good walker, and was never daunted by difficulties or dangers either real or imaginary. She was impressed by Boris's bright little face, and Kitty's story of his fidelity to the path of duty touched her quick and affectionate nature. Annie Forest, the grown-up girl, was very like Annie Forest, the child. She was still intensely impulsive, wayward, and eager. Her faults were in a great manner subdued, but they were not eradicated. She was intensely affectionate, brave, and true as steel; but she was apt to be both heedless and thoughtless. When rushing away to rescue Boris, it never once entered into her head that the secret of her absence might prove very troublesome to poor Kitty, and that the rest of the party might suffer uneasiness on her account. Without any adventure from bull or bull-dog, without endangering her life in the bog, which turned out to be almost non-existent at this time of year, she reached the Towers at the most sultry time of the day, and appeared upon the scene between one and two o'clock, a tired, flushed, and very thirsty Annie. All during her walk she pictured Boris's state of despair. She saw in her mind's eye a vision of his little, flushed, tear-stained face. She thought of Nell, too, and imagined the rapture with which the ugly duckling would greet her, the deliverer of the oppressed.  Annie entered the Towers by a side entrance, and, skirting a pretty, shady lawn, approached the house by the nearest way. As she did so, she was attracted by voices which seemed to proceed from out of a clump of trees. She stepped close to the spot from where the sound proceeded, and, craning her neck, looked over the thick laurustinus bushes, which enclosed a very tiny lawn or plot of grass.  Seated here, in the utmost peace and apparent contentment, were the poor victims for whom she had exerted herself so terribly. Nell was lying full length on her back on the grass. Boris was seated tailorwise on the ground a little way off. Nell had a white rat curled up in her hair and another nestling in her neck. Boris was feeding some white hares and some pet rabbits. The children were eagerly talking to their animals, and Annie had to own to herself that there was nothing in the least unhappy or even morbid in the sound of either of the voices.  For a moment the children's perfect happiness almost vexed her. It seemed provoking to have taken that long, exhausting walk for nothing, and oh! how hungry and thirsty, how very hungry and thirsty she felt.  The next instant, however, her good-nature asserted itself. She said \"Hullo!\" pushed her way through the laurustinus hedge, and stood in the midst of the group.  Nell started into a sitting position, tumbling the white rats on to her lap. She looked up at Annie. What a tumbled, dishevelled, hot, but oh, what a pretty strange lady was this! Nell worshipped beauty with the passion of a very hot and fervent little soul. She had scarcely noticed Annie in the schoolroom, but now her heart went out to her with a great throb.  \"Who are you?\" she said. \"Where do you come from? What is your name?\"  \"Oh, I'm not a fairy, my good child!\" said Annie. \"I'm a poor, exhausted girl, who thought she was performing a very heroic feat and finds herself mistaken.\"  \"Pray come in and take a seat,\" said Boris, who was always the soul of gentlemanly politeness. He stood up as he spoke, tumbling his rabbits and hares helter skelter in all directions, and tried to push back the laurustinus hedge for Annie. She squeezed through, tearing her cotton dress as she did so.  \"Oh, dear, dear, your sweet dress is spoiled!\" said Nell, in a tender voice.  \"Never mind,\" answered Annie; \"one must lose something to attain to this perfection.\"  \"Won't you seat yourself?\" said Boris.  He pointed to the grass, and Annie sat upon it with a sense of delight.  \"How hot you are,\" said Nell. \"What can we do for you? Would it soothe you to stroke one of the rats? This darling, for instance. His name is Crinklety.\"  Annie took the rat on her lap and looked at it reflectively.  \"It's a darling,\" she said, \"and so are the rabbits, and so are the hares; but oh, I'm so hot and so thirsty! and oh, children, don't you know what I've come about, and don't you know who I am?\"  \"No, I'm sure we don't,\" answered Boris. Nell stared solemnly; she did not speak.  \"Well,\" said Annie, \"I see I must introduce myself. I am Annie Forest. I'm Hester Thornton's friend, and I came here this morning with Hetty and Nan, and we all started on a picnic, and when we came to Friar's Wood, I found that you, Boris--you see I know your name--and you, Nell, were left behind, and I could not stand it somehow; it seemed too cruel and unfair, so I--I came back for you.\"  \"How did you come?\" asked Boris. \"Did you drive back with Dobbin or Jacko?\"  \"No; they will have plenty to do this evening, and why should I give them double work, poor dears? No; I came back with these,\" she pushed out her dainty, but very dusty, feet as she spoke.  \"You mean that you _walked_?\" said Nell. \"You walked all that long way just because of us two children that you knew nothing about. I didn't believe it was true. I never believed anything so perfectly splendid could be true out of a story book. Boris, do you hear? She walked from Friar's Wood all by herself.\"  \"Are you awfully dead beat?\" asked Boris, standing in his sturdy attitude in front of Annie and looking at her with immense attention.  \"Yes; I never was hotter in my life, and I don't think I ever felt more tired. It is such a blazing day.\"  \"Then you don't want to walk back again?\"  \"Well, I suppose I must, only I think I'll rest a little bit first, and perhaps one of you can bring me a glass of water. I consulted Kitty about it, and Kitty said you could ride your brother's bicycle, Boris. She only told me about Nell just when I was starting, but perhaps Nell can get on the bicycle sometimes, too. I'm not quite sure how it can be managed.\"  \"You need not trouble about me,\" said Nell, \"for I'm not going to the picnic. I don't wish to.\"  \"And I don't wish to either,\" said Boris; \"there's nothing to go for now, for dinner will be over. I always think the fun of a picnic is washing the potatoes and lighting the bonfire, and they'll be all over long ago.\"  \"Well, then,\" said Annie, \"I see that I have made myself a martyr in an unnecessary cause. You bad children, you are not a bit unhappy at staying at home, and I pictured you both such miserable little victims.\"  \"Would you rather have seen us miserable?\" asked Boris.  \"Of course I'd much rather have seen you miserable, you little wretch. How dare you look at me with those smiling, bright blue eyes? If I had seen you and Nell pale and wretched, and a little bit withered up, I'd have felt that my walk had been taken for a good purpose; but now----\"  \"Perhaps you think,\" said Nell, looking at Annie with great earnestness, \"that you did nothing when you took that walk and when you made the story books come true. You did a great deal for me. We are Lorrimers, Boris and I, and it isn't the fashion for a Lorrimer ever to fret when things can't be helped. Boris would have liked to go to the picnic, and I'd have liked it, too, if it had happened on another day, but as we couldn't go, we meant to have a picnic at home. Will you stay with us and help us to make up a jolly picnic at home?\"  \"Of course I will, only too gladly.\"  \"Then, Boris,\" said Nell, \"we had best fetch the food while the story book lady is resting.\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23024"],["title","Grimm Tales Made Gay (#0)"],["body","TALES MADE GAY   By GUY WETMORE CARRYL    With GAY PICTURES   By ALBERT LEVERING       [Illustration: _This shows the sword that Blue-Beard used full sore,                  After he'd led his young wife to a door._]       GRIMM TALES MADE GAY   By GUY WETMORE CARRYL    AUTHOR OF   THIS   AND MANY   OTHER   THINGS!

Gustavus Hyde.   'Twould be amiss to add to this     At present, for he died,   In full possession of his senses,   The day before my tale commences.    [Illustration]    One half his gold his four-year-old     Son Paul was known to win,   And Beatrix, whose age was six,     For all the rest came in,   Perceiving which, their Uncle Ben did   A thing that people said was splendid.    For by the hand he took them, and     Remarked in accents smooth:   \"One thing I ask. Be mine the task     These stricken babes to soothe!   My country home is really charming:   I'll teach them all the joys of farming.\"    [Illustration]    One halcyon week they fished his creek,     And watched him do the chores,   In haylofts hid, and, shouting, slid     Down sloping cellar doors:--   Because this life to bliss was equal   The more distressing is the sequel.    Concealing guile beneath a smile,     He took them to a wood,   And, with severe and most austere     Injunctions to be good,   He left them seated on a gateway,   And took his own departure straightway.    [Illustration]    Though much afraid, the children stayed     From ten till nearly eight;   At times they wept, at times they slept,     But never left the gate:   Until the swift suspicion crossed them   That Uncle Benjamin had lost them.    [Illustration]    Then, quite unnerved, young Paul observed:     \"It's like a dreadful dream,   And Uncle Ben has fallen ten     Per cent. in my esteem.   Not only did he first usurp us,   But now he's left us here on purpose!\"         *       *       *       *       *    For countless years their childish fears     Have made the reader pale,   For countless years the public's tears     Have started at the tale,   For countless years much detestation   Has been expressed for their relation.    So draw a veil across the dale     Where stood that ghastly gate.   No need to tell. You know full well     What was their touching fate,   And how with leaves each little dead breast   Was covered by a Robin Redbreast!    But when they found them on the ground,     Although their life had ceased,   Quite near to Paul there lay a small     White paper, neatly creased.   \"_Because of lack of any merit,   B. Hyde_,\" it ran, \"_we disinherit_!\"     _The Moral_: If you deeply long   To punish one who's done you wrong,   Though in your lifetime fail you may,   Where there's a will, there is a way!       _How Fair Cinderella Disposed of Her Shoe_     The vainest girls in forty states   Were Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates;   They warbled, slightly off the air,     Romantic German songs,   And each of them upon her hair     Employed the curling tongs,   And each with ardor most intense     Her buxom figure laced,   Until her wilful want of sense     Procured a woeful waist:   For bound to marry titled mates   Were Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates.    [Illustration]    Yet, truth to tell, the swains were few   Of Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too).   So morning, afternoon, and night     Upon their sister they   Were wont to vent their selfish spite,     And in the rudest way:   For though her name was Leonore,     That's neither there nor here,   They called her Cinderella, for     The kitchen was her sphere,   Save when the hair she had to do   Of Gwendolyn (and Gladys, too).    [Illustration]    Each night to dances and to _fêtes_   Went Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates,   And Cinderella watched them go     In silks and satins clad:   A prince invited them, and so     They put on all they had!   But one fine night, as all alone     She watched the flames leap higher,   A small and stooping fairy crone     Stept nimbly from the fire.   Said she: \"The pride upon me grates   Of Gwendolyn and Gladys Gates.\"    \"I'll now,\" she added, with a frown,   \"Call Gwendolyn and Gladys down!\"   And, ere your fingers you could snap,     There stood before the door   No paltry hired horse and trap,     Oh, no!--a coach and four!   And Cinderella, fitted out     Regardless of expense,   Made both her sisters look about     Like thirty-seven cents!   The prince, with one look at her gown,   Turned Gwendolyn and Gladys down!    [Illustration]    Wall-flowers, when thus compared with her,   Both Gwendolyn and Gladys were.   The prince but gave them glances hard,     No gracious word he said;   He scratched their names from off his card,     And wrote hers down instead:   And where he would bestow his hand     He showed them in a trice   By handing her the kisses, and     To each of them an ice!   In sudden need of fire and fur   Both Gwendolyn and Gladys were.    [Illustration]    At ten o'clock, in discontent,   Both Gwendolyn and Gladys went.   Their sister stayed till after two,     And, with a joy sincere,   The prince obtained her crystal shoe     By way of souvenir.   \"Upon the bridal path,\" he cried,     \"We'll reign together! Since   I love you, you must be my bride!\"     (He was no slouch, that prince!)   And into sudden languishment   Both Gwendolyn and Gladys went.     _The Moral_: All the girls on earth   Exaggerate their proper worth.   They think the very shoes they wear   Are worth the average millionaire;   Whereas few pairs in any town   Can be half-sold for half a crown!    [Illustration]       _How Little Red Riding Hood Came to be Eaten_     Most worthy of praise   Were the virtuous ways     Of Little Red Riding Hood's Ma,   And no one was ever   More cautious and clever     Than Little Red Riding Hood's Pa.   They never misled,   For they meant what they said,     And would frequently say what they meant,   And the way she should go   They were careful to show,     And the way that they showed her, she went.   For obedience she was effusively thanked,   And for anything else she was carefully spanked.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    It thus isn't strange   That Red Riding Hood's range     Of virtues so steadily grew,   That soon she won prizes   Of different sizes,     And golden encomiums, too!   As a general rule   She was head of her school,     And at six was so notably smart   That they gave her a cheque   For reciting \"The Wreck     Of the Hesperus,\" wholly by heart!   And you all will applaud her the more, I am sure,   When I add that this money she gave to the poor.    At eleven this lass   Had a Sunday-school class,     At twelve wrote a volume of verse,   At thirteen was yearning   For glory, and learning     To be a professional nurse.   To a glorious height   The young paragon might     Have grown, if not nipped in the bud,   But the following year   Struck her smiling career     With a dull and a sickening thud!   (I have shed a great tear at the thought of her pain,   And must copy my manuscript over again!)    [Illustration]    Not dreaming of harm,   One day on her arm     A basket she hung. It was filled   With jellies, and ices,   And gruel, and spices,     And chicken-legs, carefully grilled,   And a savory stew,   And a novel or two     She'd persuaded a neighbor to loan,   And a hot-water can,   And a Japanese fan,     And a bottle of _eau-de-cologne_,   And the rest of the things that your family fill   Your room with, whenever you chance to be ill!    She expected to find   Her decrepit but kind     Old Grandmother waiting her call,   But the visage that met her   Completely upset her:     It wasn't familiar at all!   With a whitening cheek   She started to speak,     But her peril she instantly saw:--   Her Grandma had fled,   And she'd tackled instead     Four merciless Paws and a Maw!   When the neighbors came running, the wolf to subdue,   He was licking his chops, (and Red Riding Hood's, too!)    [Illustration: _This shows the bad wolf that came out of the wood,                  And proved by his actions to be robbin' Hood._]    At this terrible tale   Some readers will pale,     And others with horror grow dumb,   And"]]]
