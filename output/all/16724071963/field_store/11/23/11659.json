Fortunately there was plenty of sea-room, for Dave Darrin was not in reality running away. He was still alert to win the fight, but he wanted to win with the smallest possible loss among his own men.  The Hun craft pursuing him was the slowest of the three enemies. This Dave had already guessed. He allowed the other craft to gain for half a mile, then suddenly shot ahead. By this time several hits had been scored by both combatants, and the third enemy destroyer was maneuvering for a position from which she could render herself effective to send Darrin and his men to the bottom.  Just when it happened Lieutenant Fernald hardly knew, but once more Darrin stood on the bridge at his side.  \"Circle!\" Dave shouted. \"The shortest circle we can make, so as not to show our broadside longer than we must.\"  Running under full speed, and with a helm that she minded, the \"Grigsby\" swung around. So unlooked for was this maneuver that the pursuing Hun craft did not succeed in making a direct hit on the Yankee ship during the turn.  And then, just as the turn brought him where he wished to be, and at deadly close quarters, Darrin gave his next order.  Forward leaped the American destroyer. Too late the astonished German commander saw the purpose of the maneuver.  With knife-like prow the \"Grigsby\" crashed into the German vessel, the blow striking just forward of amidships.  As the butcher's cleaver passes through the bone, so did the bow of the Yankee destroyer go through the Hun.  Yet in the moment of impact Darrin rang the bridge signal to the engine-room for full speed astern. Nor was this command executed an instant too soon. Just in the nick of time Dave's gallant little ship drew back out of the fearful hole that she had torn in the enemy.  Aboard the Hun craft the yells of dying men rose on the air, for the enemy destroyer had been all but cut in two.  Listing before an irresistible inrush of water, the German destroyer almost turned turtle, then sank quickly beneath the waves.  To the northward a muffled roar sounded, followed instantly by another. Dalzell had let go with both forward torpedo tubes, and both had scored. The second stricken enemy ship began to fill and sink slowly.  \"Shall we stop to pick up men?\" called Fernald.  \"Too bad, but we cannot linger while one of the enemy craft still floats,\" Darrin replied, calmly. \"Our first business is to sink enemy ships. We cannot be humane just yet. Give full chase, Mr. Fernald!\"  The German survivor had already turned tail, for these Yankee fighters were altogether too swift in their style of combat. Dalzell, whose craft was nearer the fugitive, was now first in pursuit.  To avoid firing over his chum's craft Darrin steered obliquely to starboard, then joined in the chase, firing frequently with his remaining forward three-inch gun.  As to speed it proved a losing race. The German craft that had survived proved to be a shade more speedy than either the \"Grigsby\" or the \"Reed,\" so the two craft in chase endeavored to make up for the difference with active fire.  Some direct hits were made. In a little more than half an hour, however, the Hun destroyer was out of range of the Yankee guns.  \"We'll drive her back to her base port, anyway,\" Darrin signalled Dalzell.  So two narrow ribbons of searchlight glow played over the sea, keeping the enemy in sight as long as possible.  Presently the German's hull vanished below the horizon; then the lower parts of her masts and stacks went out of sight. Still the two Yankee destroyers hung on, in a race that they knew they could not win.  Only when Darrin's knowledge of these waters told him that the fleeing destroyer was safe did he signal the \"Reed\" to \"abandon chase.\"  Reluctantly Dan Dalzell's little ship swung around, heading to keep the \"Grigsby\" company on the new course.  \"Tackled superior numbers, and sank two out of three,\" Dave commented, calmly. \"Not what one would call a poor evening's work, gentlemen.\"  \"It was splendidly done, sir,\" glowed Lieutenant Fernald.  \"We won't take too much credit to ourselves,\" Dave proposed. \"Let us give some of the credit to luck.\"  \"Not with you in command, sir,\" protested the executive officer.  \"But we did have a lot of luck,\" Dave insisted.  \"The luck that you planned and schemed for, with your mind working like lightning,\" Fernald retorted.  He was too much of a man to try to flatter his chief. Fernald spoke from the depths of complete conviction. He had known Dave Darrin's reputation at sea even before he had come to serve under this swift-thinking young officer.  Dave's first care, now, was to inspect the dismounted gun. Only a few moments did he need to convince himself that the piece was a wreck that could never be put in use again.  He then descended to the sick bay, where the surgeon and four baymen were giving tender attention to the wounded men.  \"It was a good fight, men,\" Dave said, as he passed through the bay.  \"Then I'm not kicking at what I found,\" cried one young sailor lad, cheerily.  \"Nor I,\" added another. \"It was worth something, sir, to take part in a fight like that. Ouch! O-o-o-h!\"  Dave paused to bend over the sufferer, resting a hand on his nearer shoulder.  \"I beg pardon, sir,\" said the lad. \"I didn't mean to make such a fuss. You'll think me a regular baby, sir.\"  \"No one is to be blamed for yelling, with a pair of shell fragment wounds like yours,\" broke in the surgeon, bending over and examining. \"My boy, you have regular man's-size wounds.\"  \"Not going to croak me, are you, sir?\" asked the young sailor, looking up into Medico's eyes.  \"Oh, no; not this trip, my lad.\"  \"Then I don't care,\" returned the young seaman. \"Wouldn't care much, anyway, but there's a mother at home who would! Ouch! There I go again. My mother'd be ashamed of me.\"  \"No, she wouldn't,\" smiled the surgeon. \"Look here, what I took out of that hole in your leg.\"  He held up a jagged fragment of shell. It was somewhat oval-shaped, about an inch and a half in length and half as wide.  \"It hurt you more when I took that out than it would to pull a dozen of your teeth at once. Let's look at this other hole, the one on the other thigh. That's going to be a tougher job. I'll give you a few whiffs of chloroform, so you won't notice anything.\"  \"Do I have to have the chloroform, sir?\" demanded the sailor lad, who was not more than eighteen.  \"You don't have to, Bassett, but it will be for your comfort,\" replied Medico.  \"Then don't ask me to smell the stuff, sir. When this war is over I want to look back and think of myself as a fighting man--not as a chap who had to be gassed every time the sawbones looked at him. Beg your pardon, sir.\"  But Medico merely smiled at being called sawbones.  \"Chloroform or not, just as you like, lad,\" the surgeon went on. \"Either way, you can always look back with satisfaction on your record as a fighting man, for your grit is all of the right kind.\"  \"Much obliged to you, sir, for saying that,\" replied the young sailor. \"Ouch! Wait, please, sir. Let me get a grip on the cot frame with both hands. Now, I'm all ready, sir.\"  \"Same old breed of Yankee sailor as always,\" Darrin smiled down into the lad's face while the surgeon began the painful work of extracting another shell fragment. This one being more deeply imbedded, the surgeon was obliged to make a selection of scalpel and tissue scissors and do some nerve-racking cutting. But the seaman, his hands tightly gripped on the edges of the operating table, which he had termed a cot, did not once cry out, though ice-cold sweat beaded his forehead under Darrin's warm hand.  Then a bayman washed down the enameled surface of the table, rinsing the blood away, and another attendant skilfully dressed and bandaged the second wound as he had done the first. Two baymen brought a stretcher and the lad was taken to a bunk. Here he was given a drink that, after five minutes, caused him to doze and dream fitfully of the battle through which he had lately passed.  By this time nearly all of the wounded had received first attention. Dave Darrin, followed by a junior officer, went forward to another, still smaller room, where he gazed down with heaving breast at the forms of the seamen who had given up their lives under the Stars and Stripes in the gallant work of that night.  Over the face of each dead man lay a cloth. Each cloth was removed in turn by a sailor as Darrin passed along.  \"A good fighting man and a great romp on shore,\" said Dave, looking down at the face of one man. \"One of the best fellows we ever had on any ship I've ever served on,\" he said, glancing at another face. \"A new lad,\" he said, of a third, \"but he joined on so recently that I know only that he was a brave young American!\" And so on.  It was just as the sailor was laying the cloth back over the features of the last one in the row that a seaman sprang into the room precipitately.  \"Beg pardon, sir,\" he called excitedly, \"but telephone message, with compliments of executive officer, and commanding officer's presence is desired on the bridge--instantly!\"  That surely meant business!     CHAPTER IV  WHAT A FLOATING MINE DID   AS Dave reached the deck he caught a fleeting glimpse of a big steamship ahead, which was revealed in the glare of the destroyer's searchlight.  But he did not stop to linger there. Up to the damaged bridge he ran as fast as he could go.  Evidently putting on her best effort at speed the steamship was moving forward fast in a zig-zagging course.  \"She was working her radio and blowing her whistle, all in the same moment, sir,\" Lieutenant Fernald explained. \"She must have seen a torpedo that passed by her. There must be a submarine somewhere, but we haven't picked up a sign of it as yet.\"  The ship was nearly two miles away. Having seen the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23036"],["title","Dave Darrin After the Mine Layers; Or, Hitting the Enemy a Hard Naval Blow (#6)"],["body","'s searchlight the big craft's whistle was again blowing.  \"Her master hardly expects to get away from the submarine,\" Dave observed, and instantly turned his night glass on the dark waters to try to pick up some sign of the Hun pirate craft that was causing all this excitement aboard a respectable neutral liner.  \"She's a Dutch craft,\" Dave commented. \"Head in, Mr. Fernald, as that will give us a better chance to try to find out on which side of her the pest is operating. Ask her which side.\"  Promptly the signal flashed out from the blinkers of the \"Grigsby.\" Plainly the excited skipper of the liner hadn't thought of offering that important bit of information.  \"Starboard side, probably eight hundred yards away,\" came back the Dutchman's blinker response.  Dave accordingly ordered the \"Grigsby\" laid over to starboard and raced on to place the Yankee ship between the pirate and the intended victim.  Hardly had the course been altered, however, in the roughening sea, when a dull lurid flash some twelve or fifteen feet high was seen just under the liner's starboard bow. A cloud of smoke rose, the lower half of which was promptly washed out by a rising wave.  \"That was a mine, no torpedo!\" cried Dave, his eyes snapping. \"Full speed ahead, Mr. Fernald, and prepare to clear away our launches. That ship cannot float long!\"  Through the night glass it could be seen that throngs of passengers were rushing about the deck of the Dutch vessel. Ship's officers were trying to quell the panic that was quite natural, for the mine, if it were such a thing, had torn a huge hole in the bow, and the liner was settling by the head.  Up raced the \"Grigsby,\" the \"Reed\" arriving less than a minute afterward. Both destroyers had manned their launches, and these were now lowered and cleared away.  Even though the passengers appeared to have lost their heads, the Dutch skipper proved true to his trust. He was lowering his own boats and rafts as rapidly as he could, and making swift work of getting human beings away from the stricken ship.  Fully two-score passengers of either sex jumped. Striking the water they bobbed up again, for they had not neglected their life-belts.  In the hurry one lifeboat was overturned just before it reached the water. The \"Grigsby's\" leading launch raced to the spot. Half a dozen jackies promptly dove over into the icy water to give a hand to passengers too frightened to realize the importance of getting quickly away from the sinking liner.  \"No more men go overboard,\" sternly ordered Ensign Andrews, as he saw more of his men moving to the side of the launch. \"Stand by to haul the rescued aboard!\"  All care was needed, for the liner was a big one, and doomed soon to take her final plunge. The suction effect on small boats would be tremendous, if they were caught too close to the scene of the foundering.  Lines were cast to jackies who were towing frightened passengers. Rescue moved along swiftly, the launches from both destroyers backing slowly away from the settling craft.  \"Here y'are, lady!\" coaxed one seaman from the first launch, catching a line at twenty feet and placing it in the hands of a frightened woman whose teeth chattered and who was nearly dead from the cold that the icy water sent through to the marrow of her bones. \"Think y' can hold on, lady? If y' can, I can go back and help some one else.\"  The woman, though she spoke no English, guessed the meaning of the question, and shrieked with terror.  \"Oh, all right, ma'am,\" the sailor went on, in a tone of good-humored resignation. \"I'll make sure of you, and hope that some one else won't drown.\"  With one arm around her, the other hand holding tight to the rope the jacky allowed himself to be hauled in alongside the launch.  \"Take this lady in, quick!\" ordered Jacky. \"She's about all in with the cold.\"  \"Better come on board, too, Streeter,\" advised a petty officer on the launch.  \"Too much to be done,\" replied Seaman Streeter, shoving off and starting to swim back.  \"Your teeth are chattering now,\" called the petty officer, but Seaman Streeter, with lusty strokes, was heading for a hatless, white-haired old man whom he made out, under the searchlight glare, a hundred yards away. This man, too chilled to swim for himself, though buoyed up by a belt, Streeter brought in.  \"Come on board, Streeter,\" insisted the same petty officer.  But surely that jacky was deaf, for he turned and once more struck out. By the time that the liner had been down four minutes, and the last visible and living person in the water had been rescued, Seaman Streeter had brought in six men and women, five of whom would surely have died of the cold had he not gone to their aid. And he had turned to swim back after a possible seventh.  Nearly six hundred passengers and members of the sunken liner's crew had been saved. Of these the greatest sufferers were taken aboard the \"Grigsby\" and the \"Reed\" and the remainder were left in the boats, which were towed astern.  Dave decided that the rescued ones should be landed at an English port twenty-two miles away. This port had rail communication and prompt, effective care could be given to these hundreds of people.  As soon as the start had been made for port, roll-call was held of those who had put off in the launches. Seaman Streeter was not present, nor even accounted for. Promptly Darrin ordered the course changed and the two destroyers went back, making careful search under the searchlights of the surface of the sea near the scene of the foundering. No trace of the missing seaman was found.  Seaman Streeter did not die in battle. He perished in the gentler but no less useful field of saving human life! An orphaned sister in Iowa, his only living near relative, gazes to-day at the appreciative letter she has received from the Navy Department at Washington. Then she turns to a longer and more glowing letter written by the, to her, strange hand of David Darrin, Lieutenant-Commander, United States Navy.  In less than two hours the destroyers, with their respective strings of towed boats, arrived at the British port and the work of transferring the rescued to shore began. Dan's dead and wounded were also sent ashore.  It was afterward reported that nine human beings were unaccounted for. Four more died in the boats on the way to land.  While the transfers to shore were being made Dan Dalzell came aboard the \"Grigsby\" to greet his chum. They chatted while the damaged bridge was being repaired.  \"Danny-boy,\" Dave remarked seriously, \"that exploding mine showed us clearly what is expected of us. It is our task to see that all these near-by waters are cleared of such dangerous objects.\"  \"Surely we cannot get every mine that the Huns plant,\" objected Dalzell.  \"We must get as many of them as we can. I know that all the British mine-sweepers are constantly on the job, but if necessary we must have more mine-sweepers. We must keep the paths of navigation better cleared than proved to be the case to-night.\"  \"Oh, say!\" expostulated Dalzell, his eyes wide open, \"we simply cannot, even with twice as many mine-sweepers, find every blooming mine that the Huns choose to sow in the Channel and North Sea.\"  \"To find and take up every mine should be our standard,\" Dave insisted, \"and we must live as close to that standard as we possibly can.\"  \"Then we did wrong to go after the destroyers this night?\" Dan demanded, curtly.  \"Of course not, for that bombardment of that defenseless little town, carried on longer, might have cost as many lives as are likely to be lost in the case of a steamship hitting a floating mine.\"  \"We can't do everything at the same time,\" Dan contended.  \"Then we must strive to do ninety-nine per cent. of everything,\" Darrin urged, his jaws set. \"Danny-boy, I feel as badly as you do when a single innocent life is lost in the area that we are held responsible for.\"  \"How soon do you put for sea?\" Dalzell asked.  \"As soon as our boats return and are hoisted on board.\"  Darrin was as good as his word. Twenty-one minutes later, while dawn was still invisible, the two Yankee destroyers turned seaward again. There was more work, and sterner, for them to do, and it lurked just beyond!     CHAPTER V  EYES THAT LOOKED DOWN FROM THE AIR   DAWN found the two destroyers cruising slowly northward, a little more than a mile apart.  Within sight of the bridges of the two craft were eight small, snub-nosed mine-sweepers. Frequently changing their course, these little craft were doing their utmost to pick up any mine that may have been planted just far enough under water to be struck below the water line by passing vessels.  \"I suppose we're of the few who have ever seen the flash of an exploding floating mine,\" Dave remarked to Lieutenant Fernald. \"The sea was so rough and choppy, last night, that the mine, at the instant of impact, happened to be in the trough of the sea and partly above water.\"  \"Yes,\" nodded Fernald. \"Had the waves been longer, the mine would have sunk to its usual depth. Had it not cost lives and a good ship, it would have been a sight worth seeing. As it was, since the lives and the ship had to be lost, I am glad that I was there to see it.\"  It was broad daylight now. Red streaks off in the east indicated that the sun would soon appear. But from the southwest something of at least equal interest appeared in the sky.  At the lookout's call Fernald turned to study the object in the sky through his glass.  \"It's an airship, a dirigible,\" announced the executive officer.  \"If an English dirigible, then it's all right,\" Dave nodded. \"But, if it happens to be a German Zeppelin returning from a raid over England, then it will become our solemn duty to get the anti-aircraft gun in position and pray for a chance to take a fair shot.\"  \"It's a craft of the smaller English dirigible pattern,\" Fernald announced, still studying the distant speck in the sky, which, of course, looked much larger in the field of his glass. \"Yes,"]]]
