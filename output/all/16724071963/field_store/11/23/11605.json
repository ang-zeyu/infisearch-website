The first time that he met with them was in crossing the Straits of Dover.  There are several ways by which a person may go to Holland from London. The cheapest is to take a steamer, by which means you go down the Thames, and thence pass directly across the German Ocean to the coast of Holland. But that makes quite a little voyage by sea, during which almost all persons are subject to a very disagreeable kind of sickness, on account of the small size of the steamers, and the short tossing motion of the sea that almost always prevails in the waters that lie around Great Britain.  So Mr. George and Rollo, who neither of them liked to be seasick, determined to go another way. They concluded to go down by railway to Dover, and then to go to Calais across the strait, where the passage is the shortest. Mr. and Mrs. Parkman had set off several days before them, and Mr. George supposed that by this time they were far on their way towards Holland. But they had been delayed by Mrs. Parkman's desire to go to Brighton, which is a great watering place on the coast, not far from Dover. There Mr. and Mrs. Parkman had spent several days, and it so happened that in going from Brighton to Dover they met, at the junction, the train that was bringing Mr. George and Rollo down from London; and thus, though both parties were unconscious of the fact, they were travelling along towards Dover, after leaving the junction, in the same train, and when they stepped out of the carriages, upon the Dover platform, there they were all together.  Mr. Parkman and Mr. George were very glad to see each other; and while they were shaking hands with each other, and making mutual explanations, Mrs. Parkman went to the door of the station to see what sort of a place Dover was.  She saw some long piers extending out into the water, and a great many ships and steamers lying near them. The town lay along the shore, surrounding an inner harbor enclosed by the walls of the piers. Behind the town were high cliffs, and an elevated plain above, on which a great number of tents were pitched. It was the encampment of an army. A little way along the shore a vast promontory was seen, crowned by an ancient and venerable looking castle, and terminated by a range of lofty and perpendicular cliffs of chalk towards the sea.  \"What a romantic place!\" said Mrs. Parkman to herself. \"It is just such a place as I like. I'll make William stay here to-day.\"  Just then she heard her husband's voice calling to her.  \"Louise!\"  She turned and saw her husband beckoning to her. He was standing with Mr. George and Rollo near the luggage van, as they call it in England, while the railway porters were taking out the luggage.  Mrs. Parkman walked towards the place.  \"They say, Louise,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"that it is time for us to go on board the boat. She is going to sail immediately.\"  \"Ah! but, William,\" said Mrs. Parkman, \"let us stay here a little while. Dover is such a romantic looking place.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"we will stay if you like. Are you going to stay, Mr. George?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"Rollo and I were going to stay till this afternoon. There is a boat to cross at four o'clock.\"  It was about eleven o'clock in the morning when this conversation occurred. The porter stood by all the time with Mr. Parkman's two trunks in his charge, waiting to have it decided when they were to go.  \"I should think, sir,\" said the porter, \"that as you have a lady with you, you would find this boat better. This is a tidal steamer, but the four o'clock is the mail boat, and it will be pretty rough this afternoon. There is a breeze coming up.\"  \"O, never mind the breeze,\" said Mrs. Parkman. \"We are used to it, porter. We've crossed the Atlantic.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. Parkman, \"we will wait until four o'clock.\"  \"Then I'll put the luggage in the luggage room,\" said the porter, \"and take it to the boat at half past three. That's the way to the hotel,\" he added, pointing the way.  There are several very nice hotels in Dover, but the one which the porter referred to is one of the finest and most beautifully situated hotels in Europe. It is a large and handsome edifice, built in modern style, and it stands close to the railroad station, on a point of land overlooking the sea. The coffee room, which, unlike other English coffee rooms, is used by both ladies and gentlemen, is a very spacious and splendidly decorated apartment, with large windows on three sides of it, overlooking the sea and the neighboring coasts. Each sash of these windows is glazed with one single pane of plate glass, so that whether they are shut or open there is nothing to intercept the view. The room is furnished with a great number of tables, each large enough to accommodate parties of four or six, and all, except two or three in different parts of the room that are reserved for reading and writing, are covered with neat white table cloths, and other preparations more or less advanced for breakfasts or dinners that may have been ordered, while at almost all times of the day, a greater or less number of them are occupied by parties of tourists, their bags and baskets lying on the neighboring chairs.  It was into this room, so occupied, that our travellers were ushered as they walked from the station into the hotel.  Mrs. Parkman walked forward, and took her seat near a window. The gentlemen attended her.  \"What a magnificent view!\" said she.  The view was indeed magnificent. Across the water was to be seen the coast of France, lying like a low cloud close to the horizon. Ships, and steamers, and fish boats, and every other sort of craft were seen plying to and fro over the water,--some going out, others coming in. Through one of the windows in the end of the room, Mrs. Parkman could see the castle crowning its bold and lofty promontory, and the perpendicular cliffs of chalk, with the sea beating against the base of them below. Through the opposite window, which of course was at the other end of the room, the view extended down the coast for a great distance, showing point after point, and headland after headland, in dim perspective--with a long line of surf rolling incessantly upon the beach, which seemed, in that direction, interminable.  After looking for some time at the view from the windows, Mrs. Parkman turned to observe the company in the room, and to watch the several parties of new comers as they successively entered. She wished to see if there were any young brides among them. While she was thus engaged, her husband selected a table that was vacant, and ordered breakfast. Mr. George and Rollo did the same at another table near.  While Mr. George and Rollo were at the table drinking their coffee, Mr. George asked Rollo what he supposed the porter meant by saying that the eleven o'clock boat was a tidal boat.  \"_I_ know,\" said Rollo. \"I read it in the guide book. The tidal steamers go at high tide, or nearly high tide, and if you go in them you embark from the pier on one side, and you land at the pier on the other. But the mail steamers go at a regular hour every day, and then when it happens to be low tide, they cannot get to the pier, and the passengers have to land in small boats. That is what the porter meant when he said that it would not be pleasant for a lady to go in the mail steamer. It is very unpleasant for ladies to be landed in small boats when the weather is rough.\"  \"I don't believe that Mrs. Parkman understood it,\" said Mr. George.  \"Nor I either,\" said Rollo.  \"I presume she thought,\" added Mr. George, \"that when the porter spoke about the rough sea, he only referred to the motion of the steamer in going over.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"but what he really meant was, that it would be bad for her to get down from the steamer into the small boat at the landing. I am afraid that she will not like it, though I think that it will be real good fun.\"  \"Very likely it will be fun for _you_,\" said Mr. George.  \"I would a great deal rather go across in a mail steamer at low tide than in any other way,\" said Rollo.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER III.  THE MAIL STEAMER.   Rollo's explanation in respect to the mail steamer was correct. As has before been stated in some one or other of the volumes of this series, the northern coast of France is low, and the shore is shelving for almost the whole extent of it, and there are scarcely any good harbors. Immense sandy beaches extend along the coast, sloping so gradually outward, that when the tide goes down the sands are left bare for miles and miles towards the sea. The only way by which harbors can be made on such a shore is to find some place where a creek or small river flows into the sea, and then walling in the channel at the mouth of the creek, so as to prevent it being choked up by sand. In this way a passage is secured, by which, when the tide is high, pretty good sized vessels can get in; but, after all that they can do in such a case, they cannot make a harbor which can be entered at low tide. When the tide is out, nothing is left between the two piers, which form the borders of the channel, but muddy flats, with a small, sluggish stream, scarcely deep enough to float a jolly boat, slowly meandering in the midst of them towards the sea.  The harbor of California is such a harbor as this. Accordingly, in case a steamer arrives there when the tide is down, there is no other way but for her to anchor in the offing until it rises again; and the passengers, if they wish to go ashore, must clamber down the side of the vessel into a small boat, and be pulled ashore by the oarsmen. In smooth weather this is very easily done. But in rough weather, when both steamer and boat are pitching and tossing violently up and down upon the waves, it is _not_ very easy or agreeable, especially for timid ladies.  After finishing their breakfast, Mr. George and Rollo went out, and they rambled about the town until"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22972"],["title","Rollo in Holland (#4)"],["body"," time drew near for the sailing of the boat. Then they went to the station for the luggage, and having engaged a porter to take it to the boat, they followed him down to the pier till they came to the place where the boat was lying. After seeing the trunk put on board they went on board themselves. A short time afterwards Mr. and Mrs. Parkman came.  The steamer, like all the others which ply between the coasts of France and England, was quite small, and the passengers were very few. There were only four or five ladies, and not far from the same number of gentlemen. As the passage was only expected to occupy about two hours, the passengers did not go below, but arranged themselves on seats upon the deck--some along the sides of the deck by the bulwarks, and some near the centre, around a sort of house built over the passage way which led down into the cabin.  Soon after Mr. and Mrs. Parkman came on board, Mr. Parkman said to his wife,--  \"Now, Louise, my dear, you will be less likely to be sick if you get some good place where you can take a reclining posture, and so remain pretty still until we get over.\"  \"O, I shall not be sick,\" said she. \"I am not at all afraid.\"  So she began walking about the deck with an unconcerned and careless air, as if she had been an old sailor.  Pretty soon Mr. George saw two other ladies coming, with their husbands, over the plank. The countenances of these ladies were very pleasing, and there was a quiet gentleness in their air and manner which impressed Mr. George very strongly in their favor.  As soon as they reached the deck, and while their husbands were attending to the disposal of the luggage, they began to look for seats.  \"We will get into the most comfortable position we can,\" said one of them, \"and keep still till we get nearly across.\"  \"Yes,\" said the other, \"that will be the safest.\"  So they chose good seats near the companion way, and sat down there, and their husbands brought them carpet bags to put their feet upon.  In about fifteen minutes after this the steamer put off from the pier, and commenced her voyage. She very soon began to rise and fall over the waves, with a short, uneasy motion, which was very disagreeable. The passengers, however, all remained still in the places which they had severally chosen,--some reading, others lying quiet with their eyes closed, as if they were trying to go to sleep.  Mr. Parkman himself tried to do this, but his wife would not leave him in peace. She came to him continually to inquire about this or that, or to ask him to look at some vessel that was coming in sight, or at some view on the shore. All this time the wind, and the consequent motion of the steamer, increased. Scudding clouds were seen flitting across the sky, from which there descended now and then misty showers of rain. These clouds gradually became more frequent and more dense, until at length the whole eastern sky was involved in one dense mass of threatening vapor.  It began to grow dark, too. The specified time for sailing was four o'clock; but there was a delay for the mails, and it was full half past four before the steamer had left the pier. And now, before she began to draw near the French coast, it was nearly half past six. At length the coast began slowly to appear. Its outline was dimly discerned among the misty clouds.  Long before this time, however, Mrs. Parkman had become quite sick. She first began to feel dizzy, and then she turned pale, and finally she came and sat down by her husband, and leaned her head upon his shoulder.  She had been sitting in this posture for nearly half an hour, when at length she seemed to feel better, and she raised her head again.  \"Are we not nearly there?\" said she.  \"Yes,\" said her husband. \"The lighthouse is right ahead, and the ends of the piers. In ten minutes more we shall be going in between them, and then all the trouble will be over.\"  Rollo and Mr. George were at this time near the bows. They had gone there to look forward, in order to get as early a glimpse as possible of the boats that they knew were to be expected to come out from the pier as soon as the steamer should draw nigh.  \"Here they come!\" said Rollo, at length.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"I see them.\"  It was so nearly dark that the boats could not be seen distinctly. Indeed there was not much to be discerned but a black moving mass, slowly coming out from under the walls of the pier.  The steamer had now nearly reached the ground where she was to anchor, and so the seamen on the forecastle took in the foresail, which had been spread during the voyage, and the helmsman put down the helm. The head of the steamer then slowly came round till it pointed in a direction parallel to the shore. This carried the boats and the pier somewhat out of view from the place where Mr. George and Rollo had been standing.  \"Now we can see them better aft,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"and they will board us aft too; so we had better be there ready.\"  Accordingly Mr. George and Rollo went aft again, and approached the gangway on the side where they supposed the boats would come.  In going there they passed round first on the other side of the entrance to the cabin, where the two ladies were sitting that have already been described. As they went by one of the gentlemen came to them and said,--  \"Keep up your courage a few minutes longer. We are very near the pier. In ten minutes we shall be in smooth water, and all will be over.\"  The ladies seemed much relieved and rejoiced to hear this, and then the gentleman went with Mr. George and Rollo towards the gangway, in order that they might make further observations. He was joined there a moment afterwards by his companion. Now, these gentlemen, as it happened, knew nothing about the plan of landing in boats. They had made no particular inquiry at Dover in respect to the steamer that they had come in, but took it for granted that she would go into the harbor as usual, and land the passengers at the pier. Their attention had just been attracted to the singular movement of the steamer, when Rollo and Mr. George came up.  \"_What!_\" said one of them, speaking with a tone of surprise, and looking about eagerly over the water. \"We are coming to, Mr. Waldo. What can that mean?\"  Just then the little fleet of boats, six or seven in number, began to come into view from where the gentlemen stood. They were dimly seen at a distance, and looked like long, black animals, slowly advancing over the dark surface of the water, and struggling fearfully with the waves.  \"What boats can those be?\" said Mr. Waldo, beginning to look a little alarmed.  He was alarmed not for himself, but for his wife, who was very frail and delicate in health, and ill fitted to bear any unusual exposure.  \"I am sure I cannot imagine,\" replied the other.  \"It looks marvellously as if they were coming out for us,\" said Mr. Waldo.  \"Can it be possible, Mr. Albert, that we are to land in boats such a night as this?\" continued he.  \"It looks like it,\" replied the other. \"Yes, they are really coming here.\"  The boats were now seen evidently advancing towards the steamer. They came on in a line, struggling fearfully with the waves.  \"They look like spectres of boats,\" said Mr. George to Rollo.  Mr. Albert now went round to the other side of the companion way, to the place where the two ladies were sitting.  \"Ladies,\" said he, \"I am very sorry to say that we shall be obliged to land in boats.\"  \"In boats!\" said the ladies, surprised.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Albert, \"the tide is out, and I suppose we cannot go into port. The steamer has come to, and the boats are coming alongside.\"  The ladies looked out over the dark and stormy water with an emotion of fear, but they did not say a word.  \"There is no help for it,\" continued the gentleman; \"and you have nothing to do but to resign yourselves passively to whatever comes. If we had known that this steamer would not go into port, we would not have come in her; but now that we are here we must go through.\"  \"Very well,\" said the ladies. \"Let us know when the boat for us is ready.\"  Mr. Albert then returned to the gangway, where Rollo and Mr. George were standing. The foremost boat had come alongside, and the seamen were throwing the mail bags into it. When the mails were all safely stowed in the boat, some of the passengers that stood near by were called upon to follow. Mr. George and Rollo, being near, were among those thus called upon.  \"Wait a moment,\" said Mr. George to Rollo, in a low tone. \"Let a few of the others go first, that we may see how they manage it.\"  It proved to be rather difficult to manage it; for both the steamer and the boat were rocking and tossing violently on the waves, and as their respective motions did not at all correspond, they thumped against each other continually, as the boat rose and fell up and down the side of the steamer in a fearful manner. It was dark too, and the wind was blowing fresh, which added to the frightfulness of the scene.  A crowd of people stood about the gangway. Some of these people were passengers waiting to go down, and others, officers of the ship, to help them. The seamen in the boat below were all on the alert too, some employed in keeping the boat off from the side of the ship, in order to prevent her being stove or swamped, while others stood on each side of the place where the passengers were to descend, with uplifted arms, ready to seize and hold them when they came down.  There was a little flight of steps hanging down the side of the steamer, with ropes on each side of it in lieu of a balustrade. The passenger who was to embark was directed to turn round and begin to go down these steps backward, and then, when the sea lifted the boat so that the seamen on board could seize hold of him, they all cried out vociferously, \"LET GO!\" and at the same moment a strong sailor grasped him around the waist, brought him down into the bottom of the boat in a very safe,"]]]
