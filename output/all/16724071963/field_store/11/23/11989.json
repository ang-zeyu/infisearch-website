Walpole's friends always justified his treatment of Chesterfield by asserting that Chesterfield was one of a party who were caballing against the minister at the time of the excise scheme, and while Chesterfield was a member of the Government.  Chesterfield, it was declared, used actually to attend certain private meetings and councils of Walpole's enemies to concert measures against him.  There is nothing incredible or even unlikely in this; but even if it were utterly untrue, we may assume that sooner or later Walpole would have got rid of Chesterfield.  {9} Walpole's besetting weakness was that he could not endure any really capable colleague.  The moment a man showed any capacity for governing, Walpole would appear to have made up his mind that that man and he were not to govern together.  [Sidenote: 1733--Walpole's animosity]  Walpole made a clean sweep of the men in office whom he believed to have acted against him.  He even went so far as to deprive of their commissions in the army two peers holding no manner of office in the Administration, but whom he believed to have acted against him.  To strengthen himself in the House of Lords he conferred a peerage on his attorney-general and on his solicitor-general.  Philip Yorke, the Attorney-general, became Lord Hardwicke and Chief-justice of the King's Bench; Charles Talbot was made Lord Chancellor under the title of Lord Talbot.  Both were men of great ability.  Hardwicke stood higher in the rank at the bar than Talbot, and in the ordinary course of things he ought to have had the position of Lord Chancellor.  But Talbot was only great as a Chancery lawyer, and knew little or nothing of common law, and it would have been out of the question to make him Lord Chief-justice.  So Walpole devised a characteristic scheme of compromise.  Hardwicke was induced to accept the office of Lord Chief-justice on the salary being raised from 3000 pounds to 4000 pounds, and with the further condition that an additional thousand a year was to be paid to him out of the Lord Chancellor's salary.  This curious transaction Walpole managed through the Queen, and the Queen managed to get the King to regard it as a clever device of his own mention.  It is worth while to note that the only charge ever made against Hardwicke by his contemporaries was a charge of avarice; he was stingy even in his hospitality, his enemies said--a great offence in that day was to be parsimonious with one's guests; and malignant people called him Judge Gripus.  For aught else, his public and private character were blameless.  Hardwicke was the stronger man of the two; Talbot the more subtle and {10} ingenious.  Both were eloquent pleaders and skilled lawyers, each in his own department.  Hervey says that \"no one could make more of a good cause than Lord Hardwicke, and no one so much of a bad cause as Lord Talbot.\"  Hardwicke lived to have a long career of honor, and to win a secure place in English history.  Lord Talbot became at once a commanding influence in the House of Lords. \"Our new Lord Chancellor,\" the Earl of Strafford, England's nominal and ornamental representative in the negotiation for the peace of Utrecht, writes to Swift, \"at present has a great party in the House.\"  But the new Lord Chancellor did not live long enough for his fame.  He was destined to die within a few short years, and to leave the wool-sack open for Lord Hardwicke.  [Sidenote: 1734--The Patriots]  The House of Commons has hardly ever been thrilled to interest and roused to passion by a more heated, envenomed, and, in the rhetorical sense, brilliant debate than that which took place on March 13, 1734. The subject of the debate was the motion of a country gentleman, Mr. William Bromley, member for Warwick, \"that leave be given to bring in a bill for repealing the Septennial Act, and for the more frequent meeting and calling of Parliaments.\"  The circumstances under which this motion was brought forward gave it a peculiar importance as a party movement.  Before the debate began it was agreed, upon a formal motion to that effect, \"that the Sergeant-at-arms attending the House should go with the mace into Westminster Hall, and into the Court of Bequests, and places adjacent, and summon the members there to attend the service of the House.\"  The general elections were approaching; the Parliament then sitting had nearly run its course.  The Patriots had been making every possible preparation for a decisive struggle against Walpole.  They had been using every weapon which partisan hatred and political craft could supply or suggest.  The fury roused up by the Excise Bill had not yet wholly subsided.  Public opinion still throbbed and heaved like a sea the morning after a storm.  {11} The Patriots had been exerting their best efforts to make the country dissatisfied with Walpole's foreign policy.  The changes were incessantly rung upon the alleged depredations which the Spaniards were committing on our mercantile marine.  Long before the time for the general elections had come, the Patriot candidates were stumping the country.  Their progress through each county was marked by the wildest riots.  The riots sometimes called for the sternest military repression.  On the other hand, the Patriots themselves were denounced and discredited by all the penmen, pamphleteers, and orators who supported the Government on their own account, or were hired by Walpole and Walpole's friends to support it. So effective were some of these attacks, so damaging was the incessant imputation that in the mouths of the Patriots patriotism meant nothing but a desire for place and pay, that Pulteney and his comrades found it advisable gradually to shake off the name which had been put on them, and which they had at one time willingly adopted.  They began to call themselves \"the representatives of the country interest.\"  The final struggle of the session was to take place on the motion for the repeal of the Septennial Act.  We have already given an account of the passing of that Act in 1716, and of the reasons which in our opinion justified its passing.  It cannot be questioned that there is much to be said in favor of the principle of short Parliaments, but in Walpole's time the one great object of true statesmanship was to strengthen the power of the House of Commons; to enable it to stand up against the Crown and the House of Lords.  It would be all but impossible for the House of Commons to maintain this position if it were doomed to frequent and inevitable dissolutions.  Frequent dissolution of Parliament means frequently recurring cost, struggle, anxiety, wear and tear, to the members; and; of course, it meant all this in much higher measure during the reign of George the Second than it could mean in the reign of Victoria.  Walpole had {12} devoted himself to the task of strengthening the representative assembly, and he was, therefore, well justified in resisting the motion made by Mr. Bromley on March 13, 1734, for the repeal of the Septennial Act.  Our interest now, however, is not so much with the political aspect of the debate as with its personal character.  One illustration of the corruption which existed at the time may be mentioned in passing.  It was used as an argument against long Parliaments, but assuredly at that day it might have been told of short Parliaments as well.  Mr. Watkin Williams Wynn mentioned the fact that a former member of the House of Commons, afterwards one of the judges of the Common Pleas, \"a gentleman who is now dead, and therefore I may name him,\" declared that he \"had never been in the borough he represented in Parliament, nor had ever seen or spoken with any of his electors.\"  Of course this worthy person, \"afterwards one of the judges of the Common Pleas,\" had simply sent down his agent and bought the place.  \"I believe,\" added Mr. Wynn, \"I could without much difficulty name some who are now in the same situation.\"  No doubt he could.  [Sidenote: 1734--A supposititious minister]  Sir William Wyndham came on to speak.  Wyndham was now, of course, the close ally of Bolingbroke.  He hated Walpole.  He made his whole speech one long denunciation of bribery and corruption, and gave it to be understood that in his firm conviction Walpole only wanted a long Parliament because it gave him better opportunities to bribe and to corrupt.  He went on to draw a picture of what might come to pass under an unscrupulous minister, sustained by a corrupted septennial Parliament.  \"Let us suppose,\" he said, \"a gentleman at the head of the Administration whose only safety depends upon his corrupting the members of this House.\"  Of course Sir William went on to declare that he only put this as a supposition, but it was certainly a thing which might come to pass, and was within the limits of possibility.  If it did come to pass, could not such a minister promise himself more success in a septennial than he {13} could in a triennial Parliament? \"It is an old maxim,\" Wyndham said, \"that every man has his price.\" This allusion to the old maxim is worthy of notice in a debate on the conduct and character of Walpole.  Evidently Wyndham did not fall into the mistake which posterity appears to have made, and attribute to Walpole himself the famous words about man and his price.  Suppose a case \"which, though it has not happened, may possibly happen.  Let us suppose a man abandoned to all notions of virtue and honor, of no great family, and of but a mean fortune, raised to be chief Minister of State by the concurrence of many whimsical events; afraid or unwilling to trust to any but creatures of his own making, and most of these equally abandoned to all notions of virtue or honor; ignorant of the true interest of his country, and consulting nothing but that of enriching and aggrandizing himself and his favorites.\"  Sir"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23470"],["title","A History of the Four Georges, Volume II (#3)"],["body","described this supposititious personage as employing in foreign affairs none but men whose education made it impossible for them to have such qualifications as could be of any service to their country or give any credit to their negotiations.  Under the rule of this minister the orator described \"the true interests of the nation neglected, her honor and credit lost, her trade insulted, her merchants plundered, and her sailors murdered, and all these things overlooked for fear only his administration should be endangered.  Suppose this man possessed of great wealth, the plunder of the nation, with a Parliament of his own choosing, most of their seats purchased, and their votes bought at the expense of the public treasure.  In such a Parliament let us suppose attempts made to inquire into his conduct or to relieve the nation from the distress he has brought upon it.\"  Would it not be easy to suppose all such attempts discomfited by a corrupt majority of the creatures whom this minister \"retains in daily pay or engages in his particular interest by granting them those posts and places which never ought to be given to any but for the good of the public?\"  Sir William pictured this minister {14} pluming himself upon \"his scandalous victory\" because he found he had got \"a Parliament, like a packed jury, ready to acquit him at all adventures.\"  Then, glowing with his subject, Sir William Wyndham ventured to suggest a case which he blandly declared had never yet happened in this nation, but which still might possibly happen.  \"With such a minister and such a Parliament, let us suppose a prince upon the throne, either from want of true information or for some other reason, ignorant and unacquainted with the inclinations and the interest of his people, weak, and hurried away by unbounded ambition and insatiable avarice.  Could any greater curse befall a nation than such a prince on the throne, advised, and solely advised, by such a minister, and that minister supported by such a Parliament? The nature of mankind,\" the orator exclaimed, \"cannot be altered by human laws; the existence of such a prince, of such a minister, we cannot prevent by Act of Parliament; but the existence of such a Parliament, I think, we may; and, as such a Parliament is much more likely to exist, and may do more mischief while the Septennial Law remains in force than if it were repealed, therefore I am most heartily in favor of its immediate repeal.\"  [Sidenote: 1734--An effective reply]  This was a very pretty piece of invective.  It was full of spirit, fire, and force.  Nobody could have failed for a moment to know the original of the portrait Sir William Wyndham professed to be painting from imagination.  It was not indeed a true portrait of Walpole, but it was a perfect photograph of what his enemies declared and even believed Walpole to be.  Such was the picture which the _Craftsman_ and the pamphleteers were painting every day as the likeness of the great minister; but it was something new, fresh, and bold to paint such a picture under the eyes of Walpole himself.  The speech was hailed with the wildest enthusiasm and delight by all the Jacobites, Patriots, and representatives of the country interest, and there is even some good reason to believe that it gave a certain secret satisfaction to some of those who most {15} steadily supported Walpole by their votes.  But Walpole was not by any means the sort of man whom it is quite safe to visit with such an attack.  The speech of Sir William Wyndham had doubtless been carefully prepared, and Walpole had but a short time, but a breathing-space, while two or three speeches were made, in which to get ready his reply.  When he rose to address the House it soon became evident that he had something to say, and that he was determined to give his adversary at least as good as he brought.  Nothing could be more effective than Walpole's method of reply.  It was not to Sir William Wyndham that he replied; at least it was not Sir William Wyndham whom he attacked.  Walpole passed Wyndham by altogether. Wyndham he well knew to be but the mouth-piece of Bolingbroke, and it was at Bolingbroke that he struck.  \"I hope I may be allowed,\" he said, \"to draw a picture in my turn; and I may likewise say that I do not mean to give a description of any particular person now in being. Indeed,\" Walpole added, ingenuously, \"the House being cleared, I am sure no person that hears me can come within the description of the person I am to suppose.\"  This was a clever touch, and gave a new barb to the dart which Walpole was about to fling.  The House was cleared; none but members were present; the description applied to none within hearing.  Bolingbroke, of course, was not a member; he could not hear what Walpole was saying.  Then Walpole went on to paint his picture. He supposed, \"in this or in some other unfortunate country, an anti-minister . . . in a country where he really ought not to be, and where he could not have been but by an effect of too much goodness and mercy, yet endeavoring with all his might and with all his art to destroy the fountain from whence that mercy flowed.\"  Walpole depicted this anti-minister as one \"who thinks himself a person of so great and extensive parts, and of so many eminent qualifications, that he looks upon himself as the only person in the kingdom capable of conducting the public affairs of the nation.\" {16} Walpole supposed \"this fine gentleman lucky enough to have gained over to his party some persons of really great parts, of ancient families, and of large fortunes, and others of desperate views, arising from disappointed and malicious hearts.\"  Walpole grouped with fine freehand-drawing the band of conspirators thus formed under the leadership of this anti-minister. All the band were moved in their political behavior by him, and by him solely.  All they said, either in private or public, was \"only a repetition of the words he had put into their mouths, and a spitting forth of the venom which he had infused into them.\"  Walpole asked the House to suppose, nevertheless, that this anti-minister was not really liked by any even of those who blindly followed him, and was hated by the rest of mankind.  He showed him contracting friendships and alliances with all foreign ministers who were hostile to his own country, and endeavoring to get at the political secrets of English administrations in order that he might betray them to foreign and hostile States.  Further, he asked the House to suppose this man travelling from foreign court to court, making it his trade to betray the secrets of each court where he had most lately been, void of all faith and honor, delighting to be treacherous and traitorous to every master whom he had served and who had shown favor to him.  \"Sir, I could carry my suppositions a great deal further; but if we can suppose such a one as I have pictured, can there be imagined a greater disgrace to human nature than a wretch like this?\"  [Sidenote: 1734--An unstable alliance]  The ministers triumphed by a majority of 247 to 184.  Walpole was the victor in more than the mere parliamentary majority.  He had conquered in the fierce parliamentary duel.  There is a common impression that Walpole's speech hunted Bolingbroke out of the country; that it drove him into exile and obscurity again, as Cicero's invective drove Catiline into open rebellion.  This, however, is not the fact.  A comparison of dates settles the question. The debate on the Septennial Bill took place in March, 1734; {17} Bolingbroke did not leave England until the early part of 1735.  The actual date of his leaving England is not certain, but Pulteney, writing to Swift on April 29, 1735, adds in a postscript: \"Lord Bolingbroke is going to France with Lord Berkeley, but, I believe, will return again in a few months.\"  No one could have known better than Pulteney that Bolingbroke was not likely to return to England in a few months.  Still, although Bolingbroke did not make a hasty retreat, history is well warranted in saying that Walpole's powerful piece of invective closed the door once for all against Bolingbroke's career in English politics.  Bolingbroke could not but perceive that Walpole's accusations against him sank deeply into the heart of the English people.  He could not but see that some of those with whom he had been most closely allied of late years were impressed with the force of the invective; not, indeed, by its moral force, but by the thought of the influence it must have on the country.  It may well have occurred to Pulteney, for example, as he listened to Walpole's denunciation, that the value of an associate was more than doubtful whom the public could recognize at a glance as the original of such a portrait.  There had been disputes now and then already.  Bolingbroke was too much disposed to regard himself as master of the situation; Pulteney was not unnaturally inclined to believe that he had a much better understanding of the existing political conditions; he complained that Wyndham submitted too much to Bolingbroke's dictation.  The whole alliance was founded on unstable and unwholesome principles; it was sure to crumble and collapse sooner or later.  There can be no question but that Walpole's invective precipitated the collapse.  With consummate political art he had drawn his picture of Bolingbroke in such form as to make it especially odious just then to Englishmen.  The mere supposition that an English statesman has packed cards with a foreign enemy is almost enough in itself at any time to destroy a great career; to turn a popular favorite into an object of national distrust {18} or even national detestation.  But in Bolingbroke's case it was no mere supposition.  No one could doubt that he had often traded on the political interests of his own country.  In truth, there was but little of the Englishman about him.  His gifts and his vices were alike of a foreign stamp."]]]
