Two smaller holes in the walls, which served for windows, were used on the present occasion as loopholes by Will Osten and Bunco.  Perfect silence was maintained for about half an hour.  The sky was cloudless and the moon full.  Not a breath of wind stirred a leaf of the forest that encircled the small clearing.  The buzz of mosquitoes, or the flapping about of a huge bat alone disturbed the silence of the night, and the watchers were beginning to fear it would turn out to be a false alarm, when the cattle in the yard began to low in a quick yet mournful tone.  They knew full well that their enemy was at hand!  A few minutes, that appeared an age, of anxiety followed.  Then some bullocks that had been purposely fastened near the hut began to bellow furiously. Another instant, and the tiger cleared the fence with a magnificent bound, alighted in the yard, and crouched for a spring.  The moon shone full in his glaring eyeballs, making his head a splendid target.  Three shots crashed out in one report, and with a roar that would have done credit to the monarch of the African wilderness, this king of the western forest fell down and died.  He was a full-grown tiger with a beautifully marked skin, which Bunco was not long in stripping from the carcass, while the Spaniard, who was highly delighted by this success, set about preparing breakfast.  They were all too much excited to think of going to bed again; and, besides, it was within an hour of daybreak.  During the morning Will Osten persuaded his host to give him one of his old guns in exchange for a beautiful silver-mounted hunting knife, which was the only article of value that he happened to possess.  With this useful addition to their arms, the travellers resumed their journey shortly after dawn, being convoyed several miles on their way by their amiable host.  They parted from him, finally, with much regret and many professions of gratitude and esteem, especially from Larry, who, in the fulness of his impulsive nature, reiterated his pressing invitation to pay him a visit in his \"swait little cabin in the bog of Clonave, County Westmeath, ould Ireland!\"  We will not drag the reader through every step of the rough and adventurous journey which was accomplished by our travellers in the succeeding week, during which they became so familiar with tigers, that Muggins thought no more of their roaring than he did of the mewing of cats, while Larry actually got the length of kicking the \"sarpints\" out of his way, although he did express his conviction, now and then, that the \"counthry wos mightily in want of a visit from Saint Patrick.\"  They travelled steadily and surely under the guidance of the faithful Bunco, through tangled brake, and wild morass, and dense forest, and many a mile of sandy plain, until at length they reached the small town and port of _Tacames_, into which they entered one sultry afternoon, footsore and weary, with their clothes torn almost to tatters, and without a single coin--of any realm whatever--in their pockets.  \"Well, here we are at last,\" said Will Osten, with a sigh.  \"True for ye,\" responded Larry.  \"That's so,\" said Muggins.  \"It's all well as ends well, which wos Billy Cowper's opinion,\" observed Old Peter.  Bunco made no remark, but he gave a quiet grunt, which might have meant anything--or nothing--as they entered the town.    CHAPTER NINE.  DESCRIBES A SURGICAL OPERATION, AND RECORDS THE DELIBERATIONS OF A COUNCIL.  The town of Tacames, in the republic of Ecuador, is not large, neither is it important to the world, but it appeared both large and important in the eyes of our hero and his comrades.  In their circumstances any town would have been regarded as a city of refuge, and their joy on arriving was not much, if at all, marred by the smallness and the poor appearance of the town, which, at that time, consisted of about twenty houses.  They were built on the top of posts about twelve or fourteen feet from the ground--like the hut of the Spaniard already described-- because, being closely walled in by a dense jungle, tigers and huge monkeys were bold enough to pay the inhabitants nocturnal and unwelcome visits very frequently.  \"A curious-looking place,\" observed Will Osten, as they drew near.  \"So would the natives obsarve of London or Liverpool,\" said Old Peter.  \"With less cause, however,\" replied Will.  \"That depends on taste,\" retorted Old Peter.  \"Be no manes,\" put in Larry; \"it neither depinds on taste, nor smell, but feelin'--see now, here's how it is.  We being in Tickamis, _feels_ it coorious; well av the natives here wos in London _they_ would feel it coorious.  It's all a matter o' feelin' d'ye see--wan o' the five senses.\"  \"Wot a muddlehead you are, Larry,\" growled Muggins; \"ye don't even know that there's six senses.\"  \"Only five,\" said the Irishman firmly--\"seein', hearin', tastin', smellin', and feelin'; wot's the sixth sense?\"  \"One that you are chock full of--it's non-sense,\" replied Muggins.  \"Think o' that, now!\" exclaimed Larry, with a broad grin; \"sure I wint an' forgot it, an' the sevinth wan, too, called common sense, of which, Muggins, you haven't got no more in yer skull than a blue-faced baboon. Hallo! wot's that?  Is it a wild baist on its hind-legs or only a mad man?\"  He pointed as he spoke to a man who approached them from the town, and whose appearance as well as his actions were well calculated to surprise them.  He was a fine-looking man of gigantic size, with a poncho over his shoulders and a Spanish-looking sombrero on his head, but the most curious thing about him was his gait.  At one moment he sauntered, holding his face between both hands, next moment he bent double and appeared to stamp with his feet.  Then he hurried forward a few paces but paused abruptly, bent down and stamped again.  Presently he caught sight of the travellers.  At once his antics ceased.  He raised himself erect, and advancing quickly, lifted his sombrero and saluted them with the air of a prince.  Will Osten addressed him in English, and, to his surprise as well as gratification, the Spaniard replied in the same tongue, which he spoke, however, in a most remarkable way, having learned it chiefly from the skippers of those vessels that touched at the port.  \"I sall be happy to offer you hospitabilities, gentelmans,\" said Don Diego--(for so he styled himself).  \"If you vill come to meen house you vill grub there.\"  The grin of unnatural ferocity which Don Diego put on while he spoke, surprised and perplexed the travellers not a little, but he suddenly explained the mystery by clutching his hair, setting his teeth and muttering wildly while he gave a quick stamp with his foot--  \"Skuse me, gentelmans, I got most desperable 'tack of toothick!\"  Will Osten attempted to console Don Diego by telling him that he was a surgeon, and that if he could only obtain a pair of pincers he would soon remedy that evil; but the Spaniard shook his head and assured him that there was a miserable man in the town calling himself a vendor of physic, who had already nearly driven him mad by attempting several times to pull the tooth, but in vain.  \"Indeed,\" said the Don, \"the last time he have try, I 'fraid I shut up won of his days light--it _was_ so sore!\"  Will Osten ultimately persuaded the Spaniard, however, to consent to an operation, and the whole party accompanied him to his house, which was the most substantial in the town.  Leaving his comrades there, Will went with Bunco in search of the apothecary, whom he soon found, and who readily lent him a pair of forceps, with which he returned to the residence of Don Diego.  Considering his size, Will deemed it advisable to have Larry and Muggins standing by ready to hold him if he should prove obstreperous.  This was a wise precaution, for, the moment Will began to pull at the obstinate grinder, the gigantic Don began to roar and then to struggle.  The tooth was terribly firm.  Will did not wonder that the native dentist had failed.  The first wrench had no effect on it.  The second--a very powerful one--was equally futile, but it caused Don Diego to roar hideously and to kick, so Will gave a nod to his assistants, who unceremoniously seized the big man in their iron gripe and held him fast.  Then our hero threw all his strength into a final effort, and the tooth came out with a crash, and, along with it, a terrible yell from Don Diego, who sent Larry and Muggins staggering against the wall!  The relief experienced by the poor man was almost instantaneous; as soon as he could speak he thanked Will in fervid Spanish, and with genuine gratitude.  It is interesting to observe how often matters of apparently slight moment in human affairs form turning-points which lead to important results.  The incident which we have just related caused Don Diego to entertain such kindly feelings towards Will Osten, that he not only invited him to stay at his house with his companions during their residence in Tacames, but insisted on his accepting a very large fee for the service he had rendered him.  Of course this was not objected to in the circumstances, but a still better piece of good fortune than this befell the wanderers.  Will found that a number of the inhabitants had been attacked with dysentery, and that the ignorance of the vendor of physic was so great, that he could do nothing for them, except make a few daring experiments, which were eminently unsuccessful.  To these poor invalids our embryo doctor was so useful, that after a few days dosing with proper medicine, their health and spirits began to improve rapidly, and their gratitude was such that they heaped upon him every delicacy that the place afforded, such as bananas, plantains, oranges, lemons, pumpkins, melons, sweet potatoes, beef, goat's flesh, venison, and pork, besides filling his pockets with doubloons!

Dr. Royce knew his state, and a more competent writer could hardly have been selected. Reviewing, in his history, almost everything accessible, worthy of consideration, in connection with mining-camps, it is noteworthy that the Doctor has much to say concerning the Shirley Letters. Thus (p. 344),--      Fortune has preserved to us from the pen of a very intelligent     woman, who writes under an assumed name, a marvelously skillful and     undoubtedly truthful history of a mining community during a brief     period, first of cheerful prosperity, and then of decay and     disorder. The wife of a physician, and herself a well-educated New     England woman, \"Dame Shirley,\" as she chooses to call herself, was     the right kind of witness to describe for us the social life of a     mining camp from actual experience. This she did in the form of     letters written on the spot to her own sister, and collected for     publication some two or three years later. Once for all, allowing     for the artistic defects inevitable in a disconnected series of     private letters, these \"Shirley\" letters form the best account of     an early mining camp that is known to me. For our real insight into     the mining life as it was, they are, of course, infinitely more     helpful to us than the perverse romanticism of a thousand such     tales as Mr. Bret Harte's, tales that, as the world knows, were not     the result of any personal experience of really primitive     conditions.  And in a foot-note on page 345 the Doctor says, in part,--      She is quite unconscious of the far-reaching moral and social     significance of much that she describes. Many of the incidents     introduced are such as imagination could of itself never suggest,     in such an order and connection. There is no mark of any conscious     seeking for dramatic effect. The moods that the writer expresses     indicate no remote purpose, but are the simple embodiment of the     thoughts of a sensitive mind, interested deeply in the wealth of     new experiences. The letters are charmingly unsentimental; the     style is sometimes a little stiff and provincial, but is on the     whole very readable.  No typographical or other changes are made in printing these extracts from Dr. Royce's history, and as typographical style is involved in noticing further the Doctor's review of the Shirley Letters, it is proper to say here that his volume was printed at the Riverside Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,--a press that, in the words of a writer on matters of typographical style, \"maintained the reputation of being one of the three or four most painstaking establishments in the world.\" Such places are few and far between, unlike the \"book and job printing establishments\" that, like the poor, are always with us, and where no _book_ was ever printed.  After having so fittingly introduced Shirley to his readers, it is unfortunate that the Doctor is not always accurate in his citation of the facts as printed in the Letters. Thus on page 347 of his history, he says that the wife of the landlord of the Empire Hotel at Rich Bar was \"yellow-complexioned and care-worn.\" She does not appear to have been a care-worn person. Shirley says of her (post, p. 39),--      Mrs. B. is a gentle and amiable looking woman, about twenty-five     years of age. She is an example of the terrible wear and tear to     the complexion in crossing the plains, hers having become, through     exposure at that time, of a dark and permanent yellow, anything but     becoming. I will give you a key to her character, which will     exhibit it better than weeks of description. She took a nursing     babe, eight months old, from her bosom, and left it with two other     children, almost infants, to cross the plains in search of gold!  The Doctor says, \"The woman cooked for all the boarders herself,\" and in the preceding sentence states, \"The baby, six months old, kicked and cried in a champagne-basket cradle.\" Shirley does not use the word \"boarders.\" The baby was only two weeks old. With the details of the birth of this baby omitted, Shirley's account of these matters is (p. 40, post),--      When I arrived she was cooking supper for some half a dozen people,     while her really pretty boy, who lay kicking furiously in his     champagne-basket cradle, and screaming with a six-months-old-baby     power, had, that day, completed just two weeks of his earthly     pilgrimage.... He is an astonishingly large and strong child, holds     his head up like a six-monther, and has but one failing,--a too     evident and officious desire to inform everybody, far and near, at     all hours of the night and day, that his lungs are in a perfectly     sound and healthy condition.  Dr. Royce (p. 347) tells of the funeral of one of the four women residing at Rich Bar at the time of Shirley's arrival, which was only a few days prior to the death, and they had not met. The funeral service was held at the log-cabin residence, which had \"one large opening in the wall to admit light.\" The \"large opening\" was not, in the first intention, to"]]]
