Only I'm not very fat yet, so you'd better begin on my tail, and meanwhile I'll be munching some more grass and get a little fuller.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So the wolf went up to him from behind, and was just going to get to work on his tail, when the horse let out at him as hard as he could! And the wolf rolled over, while the horse ran off.  And there sat the wolf, and he thought: \"Well, wasn't I a fool! wasn't I a noodle! Who ever heard of anyone starting to eat a horse by the tail?\"  [Illustration]  And so he wandered on further, when after a bit he saw a pig coming towards him, so when he got to him he said: \"Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, I'm going to eat you!\" But the pig answered: \"Who are you, I should like to know, that you mean to eat me?\" \"I'm a wolf.\" \"You're a queer sort of wolf,\" answered the pig, \"you're only a dog!\" \"No, I'm not a dog,\" said he, \"I'm a wolf!\" \"Oh, that's all right then,\" answered the pig, \"you just sit down on my back. I'll give you a ride, and then you can eat me.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So the wolf sat down on the pig's back, when lo and behold! the pig carried him straight into the village.  [Illustration]  And all the dogs ran out, made a dash for the wolf, and began to tease him. And they teased him so much, it was all he could do to tear himself away and run off back into the forest.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration: Guess how old I am!]     THE PEASANT AND THE BEAR.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   Once upon a time a certain peasant lost his wife, then he lost his other relations, and then he was left alone with no one to help him in his home or his fields. So he went to Bruin and said: \"Look here, Bruin, let's keep house and plant our garden and sow our corn together.\" And Bruin asked: \"But how shall we divide it afterwards?\" \"How shall we divide it?\" said the peasant, \"Well, you take all the tops and let me have all the roots.\" \"All right,\" answered Bruin. So they sowed some turnips, and they grew beautifully. And Bruin worked hard, and gathered in all the turnips, and then they began to divide them. And the peasant said: \"The tops are yours, aren't they, Bruin?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. So the peasant cut off all the turnip tops and gave them to Bruin, and then sat down to count the roots. And Bruin saw that the peasant had done him down.  [Illustration]  And he got huffy, lay down in his den, and started sucking his paws.  [Illustration]  The next spring the peasant again came to see him, and said: \"Look here, Bruin, let's work together again, shall we?\" And Bruin answered: \"Right-ho! only this time mind! you can have the tops, but I'm going to have the roots!\" \"Very well,\" said the peasant. And they sowed some wheat, and when the ears grew up and ripened, you never saw such a sight. Then they began to divide it, and the peasant took all the tops with the grain, and gave Bruin the straw and the roots. So he didn't get anything that time either.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And Bruin said to the peasant: \"Well, good-bye! I'm not going to work with you any more, you're too crafty!\" And with that he went off into the forest.  [Illustration]     THE DOG AND THE COCK  [Illustration]   One summer a certain peasant's crops failed him, and so he had no food to give to his animals, which were a cock and a dog. And the dog said to the cock: \"Well, brother Peeter, I think we should get more to eat if we went and lived in the forest than here at our master's, don't you?\" \"That's a fact,\" answered the cock, \"let's be off, there's no help for it.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So they said good-bye to their master and mistress and went off to see what they could find. And they went on and on, and couldn't find a nice place to stop. Then it began to grow dark, and the cock said: \"Let's spend the night on a tree. I'll fly up on to a branch, and you take shelter in the hollow. We'll get through the night somehow.\"  [Illustration]  So the cock made his way on to a branch, tucked in his toes, and went to sleep, while the dog made himself a bed in the hollow of the tree. And they slept soundly the whole night through, and towards morning, when it began to get light, the cock woke up and, as was his custom, crew as loud as he could: \"Cock-a-doodle-doo! cock-a-doodle-do! all wake up! all get up! the sun will soon be rising, and the day will soon begin!\"  [Illustration]  And he crew so loud, that a fox in a hole near by was up in an instant thinking: \"What a funny thing for a cock to be crowing in the forest! I expect he's lost his way and can't get out again!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And he began to look for the cock, and after a bit he saw him sitting upon the branch of the tree. \"Oho!\" thought the fox, \"he'd make a fine meal! How can I get him to come down from there?\"  [Illustration]  So he went up to the tree and said to the cock: \"What a splendid cock you are! I've never seen such a fine one all my days! What lovely feathers, just as if they were covered with gold! And your tail! nobody could describe it in words or on paper, it's so beautiful! And what a sweet voice you've got! I could listen to it all day and all night. Do fly down a little closer and let's get to know each other a little better. That reminds me, I've got a christening on at my place to-day, and I shall have plenty of food and drink to offer such a welcome guest. Let's go along to my home.\"  [Illustration]  \"Right you are,\" answered the cock, \"I'll certainly come, only you must ask my companion too. We always go about together.\" \"And where is your companion?\" asked the fox. \"Down below in the tree hollow,\" answered the cock. And the fox poked his head into the hole, thinking there was another cock there, when the dog popped his head out and caught Mr. Fox by the nose!  [Illustration]     KING FROST.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife. She had one daughter of her own, and he had one of _his_ own. And the old woman took a dislike to her step-daughter. Whatever her own daughter did, she praised her for everything and stroked her head, but whatever her step-daughter did, she grumbled at her and scolded her for everything; it was simply dreadful. And the old woman began to want to drive her step-daughter off the face of the earth, and she said to her husband: \"Take her away into the dark forest, and let the frost freeze her to death.\" So there was nothing for the old man to do but harness his horse to the sledge, put his daughter in it, and drive her off into the forest. And he brought her right into the middle of the forest, set her down on the snow, and drove off home.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And there the little girl sat in the forest all alone, shivering with the cold. When lo and behold! there was old King Frost coming towards her, and he said: \"Hullo, little girl, are you warm?\" And she answered: \"Yes, King Frost.\" Then he blew a cold breath on to her and again asked: \"Are you warm, little girl?\" And she answered: \"Yes, King Frost!\" Then he began to make it still colder; he made the branches crack, and covered them with hoar-frost, and let loose such cold, that you could hear the air creaking.  [Illustration]  Then he asked her again: \"Well, little girl, are you warm now?\" And she answered: \"Yes, King Frost!\" And when he saw that she was a good girl, he felt sorry for her. So he put on her a fur coat, with trimmings of beaver, and made her warm, and said to her: \"You're a good girl, and so I'll stop. Here's a little present for you from King Frost.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And he brought her a trunk full of all sorts of things, silver and gold, and bright-coloured stones.  [Illustration]  Meanwhile her step-mother was saying to the old man at home: \"I expect your daughter's frozen by now. Go into the forest and bring her back.\" So he harnessed his horse to the sledge, and set out to fetch his daughter.  [Illustration]  Then his wife began to watch at the window, and at last she saw her husband driving towards home, and she said to herself: \"That's all right, there come the old man's daughter's bones back in the sledge.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  But the doggie outside said: \"Bow, wow, bow-wow-wow! The old man's bringing his daughter home. She's blooming like the poppy-bloom, and she's got a fine present, and a new coat with a beaver collar!\" And lo and behold! it was true; the old man drove up with his daughter alive and well, in her fine clothes and with her presents. \"Well,\" thought her step-mother, \"if King Frost has given all those things to the old man's daughter, he'll give my pretty girl ever so much more.\" And she said to her husband: \"Take my daughter to the same place as quick as you can, and let King Frost give her a share too!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  So the old man took her daughter, left her in the forest, and then drove off home. And there the girl sat, with her teeth chattering with the cold, when lo and behold! there was King Frost coming along, and he said: \"Hullo, little girl, are you warm?\" And she answered: \"What's that got to do with you? Go away to where you came from!\" And King Frost grew angry and blew a cold breath on to the girl, and then asked her: \"Are you warm, little girl?\" And she answered: \"Fancy asking! You can see I'm frozen! Be quick and give me the presents, and then get away to your home.\" Then King Frost began to make the girl still colder. And he kept making it colder and colder till he had frozen her through and through.  [Illustration]  Meanwhile her mother was saying to the old man at home: \"Go into the forest now, and bring back my daughter. And mind, don't forget to take the trunk and the fine clothes as well.\" So the old man started off, and his wife began to watch at the window.  She waited and waited, and at last she saw her husband driving towards home, and said to herself: \"That's all right, there comes the old "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23462"],["title","More Russian Picture Tales (#2)"],["body","bringing back my daughter all in silver and in gold.\"  [Illustration]  But the doggie outside said: \"Bow, wow, bow-wow-wow, the old man's bringing back bones in his sledge!\" The old man drove up, and it was too true, instead of the bad old woman's daughter there was only an icicle!  [Illustration]     THE BEAR'S PAW.  [Illustration]   One day a peasant saw a bear asleep in the forest, so he crept up to him and cut off one of his hind paws with an axe. And he brought the paw home, and said to his wife: \"Boil some soup from the flesh, and knit some warm gloves out of the wool.\" So she took off the skin, threw the flesh into the pot to boil, and sat down to spin the wool.  And when Bruin woke up, he found his paw gone. There was no help for it, so he cut a bit of wood off a tree, hewed it, tied it on instead of his leg, and set out for the village. As he went along he sang:  [Illustration]    \"Hobble, hobble, hobble,   On my lime-tree leg,   On my birchen crutch!   The water's asleep,   And the earth's asleep,   The whole village is asleep,   Only one woman's awake,   And she's boiling my flesh,   Sitting on my skin,   And spinning my wool!\"  [Illustration]  And the peasant's wife got very frightened, and hid as quick as she could in the cellar under the floor. And Bruin went into the house, and saw there was no one there. So he took his bit of skin, got his flesh out of the pot and made off.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: May I?]     THE BEAR AND THE OLD MAN'S DAUGHTERS.   There was once an old man and he had three little daughters, and one day he said to them: \"I am going out into the fields to plough, and you, my little daughters, bake me a loaf and bring it to me.\" \"But how are we to find you, daddy?\" they said.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"As I go along,\" he said, \"I shall drop shavings in a row along the path, and that will help you to find me.\" And as the old man rode along he threw down the shavings one after the other, and a bear came and drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  Then the eldest daughter said to the youngest: \"Go and take the bread to daddy.\" And the youngest said: \"But how am I to find daddy, and where am I to take the bread to?\" Then the eldest answered: \"He kept dropping shavings in a row along the path as he went.\" Then she took the loaf, and started off to follow the shavings, when lo and behold! she came to the bear's den.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And the bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! What a nice little girl has come to see me!\"  [Illustration]  The next day the old man went off to sow, and he said to his daughters: \"My dear little daughters, my clever little ones, bake me a loaf and bring it to me in the field.\" \"But how are we to find you, daddy?\" they said. And he answered: \"Yesterday I threw one row of shavings down, to-day I will throw two.\" And he set off, throwing the shavings down in two rows, and the bear came and drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den. Then the second daughter started out with the loaf, following the shavings, and went straight to the bear's den. And the bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! here's another little girl come to see me!\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day the old man went off to the field to harrow, and he said to his daughter: \"My dear little daughter, bake me a loaf and bring it to me in the field. I will throw three rows of shavings.\" And the old man went off, throwing the shavings down in three rows, and the bear came and drew them all aside on to the path that led to his den. And the eldest daughter set out, and she, too, came to the bear's den. And the bear saw her and said: \"O-ho! here's a third little girl come to see me in my den!\" And there they went on living, when one day the eldest sister said: \"Bruin, Bruin, I'll bake some pies, and you take them and give them to my daddy to eat.\" \"All right,\" answered the bear, \"I'll take them.\" And so she popped her youngest sister into a sack, and said: \"Here, Bruin, take this to my daddy, and mind, don't you eat it yourself on the way!\" And the bear took the sack and set off with it to the old man. And as he went along, he kept saying to himself: \"Suppose I sit down on a stump, and suppose I just eat one little pie!\" And the youngest daughter in the sack heard him and said: \"Don't sit down on a stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought that this was the eldest sister, and said to himself: \"There now, fancy that! I've come a long way, and yet she can still hear me!\" And he brought the sack right up to the old man's courtyard, when the dogs all rushed out and began to bark at him! So he flung down the sack and ran off home. And the eldest sister asked him: \"Did they make you welcome, Bruin, and give you nice things to eat?\" \"They didn't give me anything to eat,\" he answered, \"but their welcome was loud enough.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day the eldest sister said: \"Bruin, take my daddy some more pies to eat!\" And she tied up her other sister in the sack, and the bear put it on his back and carried it off into the village. And as he went through the forest he kept saying to himself: \"Suppose I sit down on a stump, and suppose I just eat one little pie!\" And the second daughter said to him from out of the sack: \"Don't sit down on a stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought: \"There now, fancy that! I've come a long way, and yet she can still hear me, and tells me not to eat a pie!\" And so he reached the old man's courtyard, and when the dogs went for him that time, they all but worried him to death! So he flung down the sack and ran off home. And the eldest sister asked him: \"Did they welcome you warmly, Bruin, and give you plenty to eat?\" \"It was _such_ a warm welcome, and they gave me so much to eat, that I shan't forget it in a hurry!\" he answered.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  And the next day the eldest girl said: \"I'll bake some more pies, and you take them to my daddy for him to eat.\" And so she herself sat down in the sack, and the bear carried her off. And as he carried her along he kept saying to himself: \"Oh, I _should_ so like to sit down on a stump, and I _should_ so like to eat one little pie!\" And the eldest daughter said to him from out of the sack: \"Don't sit down on a stump, don't! Don't eat a pie, don't!\" And the bear thought: \"There now, fancy that! Look at the long way I've come, and yet she can still see and hear me!\" And so he brought the sack to the old man, and then the dogs came upon him and all but tore him in bits. And he ran off into the forest without as much as looking round, and the old man began once more to live with his three little daughters.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: I don't like what is nice, but what I like _is_ nice!]     THE STRAW OX.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  [Illustration]   Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife, and one day she said to him: \"Make me a straw ox and smear him over with pitch.\" And he asked: \"What for?\" And she answered: \"Do what I tell you! Never mind what it's for--that's my business!\" So the old man made a straw ox and smeared him over with pitch. Then his wife got ready in the early morning and drove the ox to pasture. She sat down under a tree, and began spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass. Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!\" And she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a bear came running, and ran right up against the ox. \"Who in the world are you?\" he asked. And the ox answered: \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.\" Then the bear said: \"Well, if you're smeared over with pitch, give me some to put on my poor torn side.\" And the ox answered: \"Take some!\" So the bear seized hold of the ox, when lo and behold! his paw stuck in the pitch. And when he tried to free it with the other paw, that one stuck too. Then he started gnawing with his teeth, and they stuck too. He couldn't tear himself away anyhow. And the old woman woke up and saw the bear stuck fast to the ox. So she ran home and shouted to her husband: \"Come along quick, a bear has stuck fast to our ox, hurry up and catch him!\" And he came along, took the bear, led him home, and shut him up in the lumber room.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The next day, as soon as the sun rose, the old woman again drove the ox to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of the field! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of the field!\" And she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a wolf came running, and ran right up against the ox. \"Who in the world are you?\" he asked. And the ox answered: \"I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.\" Then the wolf said: \"Well, if that's so, give me some pitch to put on my poor torn side.\" And the ox answered: \"By all means!\" So the wolf tried to take some pitch, when lo and behold! his paw stuck in it. And when he tried to free it, it stuck all the faster. And the old woman woke up and saw the wolf sticking to the ox. So she ran to fetch her husband and said: \"Come as quick as you can, there's a wolf stuck to the ox!\" And he came and caught the wolf and put him in the cellar.  [Illustration]  The next day, before even the sun had risen, the old woman again drove the ox to pasture, and she herself sat down under a tree, and began spinning flax and saying to herself: \"Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!\" And she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep.  [Illustration]  Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a fox came"]]]
