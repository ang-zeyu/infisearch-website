I _always_ insult the bobbies.  It does me good.  I hurt 'em, mentally, as much as I can, an' I'd hurt 'em bodily if I could.  But every dog has his day.  When I grow up _won't_ I pitch into 'em!\"  He struck the table with his fist, and, shaking back his curly hair, lifted his blue eyes to his mother's face with a stern expression, which gradually relaxed into a smile.  \"Ah, you needn't grin, mother, an' tell me that the `_policemen_' are a fine set of men, and quite as brave and useful in their way as the firemen.  I know all you respectable sort of people think that; but _I_ don't.  They're my natural enemies, and I hate 'em.  Come, mother, give me the socks and let me be off.\"  Soon the vigorous urchin was on his way to the City, whistling, as usual, with all his might.  As he passed the corner of the British Museum a hand touched him on the shoulder, and its owner said:  \"How much are ye paid a week, lad, for kicking up such a row?\"  Willie looked round, and his eyes encountered the brass buckle of the waist-belt of a tall, strapping fellow in a blue uniform.  Glancing upwards, he beheld the handsome countenance of his brother Frank looking down at him with a quiet smile.  He wore no helmet, for except when attending a fire the firemen wear a sailor-like blue cloth cap.  \"Hallo, Blazes! is that you?\" cried the boy.  \"Just so, Willie; goin' down to Watling Street to attend drill.\"  Willie (who had styled his brother \"Blazes\" ever since he joined the fire brigade) observed that he happened to be going in the same direction to deliver a message from his mother to a relation, which he would not speak about, however, just then, as he wished to tell him of a fire he had been at last night.  \"A fire, lad; was it a big one?\"  \"Ay, that it was; a case o' burnin'-out almost; _and there were lives saved_,\" said the boy with a look of triumph; \"and that's more than you can say you've seen, though you _are_ a fireman.\"  \"Well, you know I have not been long in the brigade, Willie, and as the escapes often do their work before the engines come up, I've not had much chance yet of seeing lives saved.  How was it done?\"  With glowing eyes and flushed cheeks Willie at once launched out into a vivid description of the scene he had so recently witnessed, and dwelt particularly on the brave deeds of Conductor Forest and the tall fireman.  Suddenly he looked up at his brother.  \"Why, what are you chucklin' at, Blazes?\"  \"Nothing, lad.  Was the fireman _very_ tall?\"  \"That he certainly was--uncommon tall.\"  \"Something like _me_?\" said Frank.  A gleam of intelligence shot across the boy's face as he stopped and caught his brother by the sleeve, saying earnestly:  \"It wasn't _you_, Frank, _was_ it?\"  \"It was, Willie, and right glad am I to have been in such good luck as to save Miss Auberly.\"  Willie grasped his brother's hand and shook it heartily.  \"You're a brick, Blazes,\" said he, \"and this is your birthday, an' I wish you luck an' long life, my boy.  You'll do me credit yet, if you go on as you've begun.  Now, I'll go right away back an' tell mother. Won't she be fit to bu'st?\"  \"But what about your message to the relation in the City?\" inquired Frank.  \"That relation is yourself, and here's the message, in the shape of a pair o' socks from mother; knitted with her own hands; and, by the way, that reminds me--how came you to be at the fire last night?  It's a long way from your station.\"  \"I've been changed recently,\" said Frank; \"poor Grove was badly hurt about the loins at a fire in New Bond Street last week, and I have been sent to take his place, so I'm at the King Street station now.  But I have something more to tell you before you go, lad, so walk with me a bit farther.\"  Willie consented, and Frank related to him his conversation with Mr Auberly in reference to himself.  \"I thought of asking leave and running out this afternoon to tell you, so it's as well we have met, as it will--Why, what are _you_ chuckling at, Willie?\"  This question was put in consequence of the boy's eyes twinkling and his cheeks reddening with suppressed merriment.  \"Never mind, Blazes.  I haven't time to tell you just now.  I'll tell you some other time.  So old Auberly wants to see me to-morrow forenoon?\"  \"That's what he said to me,\" returned Frank.  \"Very good; I'll go.  Adoo, Blazes--farewell.\"  So saying, Willie Willders turned round and went off at a run, chuckling violently.  He attempted to whistle once or twice, but his mouth refused to retain the necessary formation, so he contented himself with chuckling instead.  And it is worthy of record that that small boy was so much engrossed with his own thoughts on this particular occasion that he did not make one observation, bad, good, or indifferent, to any one during his walk home.  He even received a question from a boy smaller than himself as to whether \"his mother knew he was out,\" without making any reply, and passed innumerable policemen without even a thought of vengeance!  \"Let me see,\" said he, muttering to himself as he paused beside the Marble Arch at Hyde Park, and leaned his head against the railings of that structure; \"Mr Auberly has been an' ordered two boys to be sent to him to-morrow forenoon--ha! he! sk!\"  (the chuckling got the better of him here)--\"very good.  An' my mother has ordered one o' the boys to go, while a tall fireman has ordered the other.  Now, the question is, which o' the two boys am I--the _one_ or the _t'other_--ha! sk! ho!  Well, of course, _both_ o' the boys will go; they can't help it, there's no gittin' over that; but, then, which of 'em will git the situation? There's a scruncher for you, Mr Auberly.  You'll have to fill your house with tar an' turpentine an' set fire to it over again 'afore you'll throw light on _that_ pint.  S'pose I should go in for _both_ situations!  It _might_ be managed.  The first boy could take a well-paid situation as a clerk, an the second boy might go in for night-watchman at a bank.\"  (Chuckling again interrupted the flow of thought.) \"P'raps the two situations might be got in the same place o' business; that would be handy!  Oh! if one o' the boys could only be a girl, _what_ a lark that would--sk! ha! ha!\"  He was interrupted at this point by a shoe-black, who remarked to his companion:  \"I say, Bob, 'ere's a lark.  'Ere's a feller bin an got out o' Bedlam, a larfin' at nothink fit to burst hisself!\"  So Willie resumed his walk with a chuckle that fully confirmed the member of the black brigade in his opinion.  He went home chuckling and went to bed chuckling, without informing his mother of the cause of his mirth.  Chuckling he arose on the following morning, and, chuckling still, went at noon to Beverly Square, where he discovered Mr Auberly standing, gaunt and forlorn, in the midst of the ruins of his once elegant mansion.    CHAPTER SIX.  \"WHEN ONE IS ANOTHER WHO IS WHICH?\"  \"Well, boy, what do you want?  Have you anything to say to me?\"  Mr Auberly turned sharp round on Willie, whose gaze had gone beyond the length of simple curiosity.  In fact, he was awe-struck at the sight of such a very tall and very dignified man standing so grimly in the midst of such dreadful devastation.  \"Please, sir, I was sent to you, sir, by--\"  \"Oh, you're the boy, the son of--that is to say, you were sent to me by your mother,\" said Mr Auberly with a frown.  \"Well, sir,\" replied Willie, hesitating, \"I--I--was sent by--by--\"  \"Ah, I see,\" interrupted Mr Auberly with a smile that was meant to be gracious, \"you were sent by a fireman; you are not the--the--I mean you're the _other_ boy.\"  Poor Willie, being of a powerfully risible nature, found it hard to contain himself on hearing his own words of the previous evening re-echoed thus unexpectedly.  His face became red, and he took refuge in blowing his nose, during which process--having observed the smile on Mr Auberly's face--he resolved to be \"the other boy.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" he said, looking up modestly, \"I was sent by a fireman; I _am_ the other boy.\"  Mr Auberly smiled again grimly, and said that the fireman was a brave fellow, and that he had saved his daughter's life, and that he was very glad to do anything that lay in his power for him, and that he understood that Willie was the fireman's brother; to which the boy replied that he was.  \"Well, then, come this way,\" continued Mr Auberly, leading Willie into the library of the adjoining house, which his friend had put at his disposal, and seating himself at a writing-table.  \"You want a situation of some sort--a clerkship, I suppose?\"  Willie admitted that his ambition soared to that tremendous height.  \"Let me see,\" muttered Mr Auberly, taking up a pen and beginning to write; \"yes, she will be able to help me.  What is your name, boy?\"  \"Willie, sir.\"  \"Just so, William; and your surname--your other name?\"  \"Willders, sir.\"  Mr Auberly started, and looked Willie full in the eyes.  Willie, feeling that he was playing a sort of double part without being able to avoid it, grew red in the face.  \"What did you say, boy?\"  \"Willders,\" replied Willie stoutly.  \"Then you're _not_ the other boy,\" said Mr Auberly, laying down his pen, and regarding Willie with a frown.  \"Please, sir,\" replied Willie, with a look of meekness which was mingled with a feeling of desperation, for his desire to laugh was strong upon him, \"please, sir, I don't rightly know _which_ boy I am.\"  Mr Auberly paused for a moment.  \"Boy, you're a fool!\"  \"Thank 'ee, sir,\" said Willie.  This reply went a long way in Mr Auberly's mind to prove the truth of his assertion.  \"Answer me, boy,\" said Mr Auberly with an impressive look and tone; \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23380"],["title","Fighting the Flames (#8)"],["body","you sent here by a fireman?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Willie.  \"What is his name?\"  \"Same as mine, sir--Willders.\"  \"Of course, of course,\" said Mr Auberly, a little confused at having put such an unnecessary question.  \"Does your _mother_ know you're here?\"  This brought the slang phrase, \"Does your mother know you're out?\" so forcibly to the boy's mind, that he felt himself swell internally, and had recourse again to his pocket-handkerchief as a safety-valve.  \"Yes, sir,\" said he, on recovering his composure; \"arter I saw Blazes-- Frank, I mean, that's my brother, sir--I goes right away home to bed.  I stops with my mother, sir, an' she saw me come off here this mornin', sir.  She knows I was comin' here.\"  \"Of course; yes, yes, I see,\" muttered Mr Auberly, again taking up his pen.  \"I see; yes, yes; same name--strange coincidence, though; but, after all, there are many of that name in London.  I suppose the _other_ boy will be here shortly.  Very odd, very odd indeed.\"  \"Please, sir,\" observed Willie, in a gentle tone, \"you said _I_ was the other boy, sir.\"  Mr Auberly seemed a little annoyed at his muttered words being thus replied to, yet he condescended to explain that there was another boy of the same name whom he expected to see that morning.  \"Oh, then there's _another_ other boy, sir?\" said Willie with a look of interest.  \"Hold your tongue!\" said Mr Auberly in a sharp voice; \"you're a fool, and you're much too fond of speaking.  I advise you to keep your tongue quieter if you wish to get on in life.\"  Willie once more sought relief in his pocket-handkerchief, while his patron indited and sealed an epistle, which he addressed to \"Miss Tippet, Number 6, Poorthing Lane, Beverly Square.\"  \"Here, boy, take this to the lady to whom it is addressed--the lane is at the opposite corner of the square--and wait an answer.\"  \"Am I to bring the answer back to you, sir?\" asked Willie with much humility.  \"No; the answer is for yourself,\" said Mr Auberly testily; \"and hark 'ee, boy, you need not trouble me again.  That note will get you all you desire.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Willie, making a bow, and preparing to retire; \"but please, sir, I don't very well know, that is to say--ahem!\"  \"Well, boy?\" said the patron sternly.  \"Excuse me, sir; I can't help it, you know; but please, sir, I wish to explain about that other boy--no, that's me, but the _other_ other boy, you know--\"  \"Begone, boy!\" cried Mr Auberly in a voice so stern that Willie found himself next moment in the street, along which he ran chuckling worse than ever.  A little reflection might have opened Mr Auberly's eyes to the truth in regard to Willie, but a poor relation was to him a disagreeable subject of contemplation, and he possessed the faculty, in an eminent degree, of dismissing it altogether from his mind.  Having care enough on his mind at that time, poor man, he deliberately cast the confusion of the two boys out of his thoughts, and gave himself up to matters more interesting and personal.  We may add here that Mrs Willders was faithful to her promise, and never more addressed her brother-in-law by word or letter.  When Willie afterwards told her and Frank of the absurdity of his interview, and of the violent manner in which Mr Auberly had dismissed him when he was going to explain about the \"other\" boy, his mother thought it best to let things rest as they stood, yet she often wondered in her own quiet way what Mr Auberly would think of her and of the non-appearance of the \"other\" boy; and she felt convinced that if he only put things together he _must_ come to understand that Willie and Frank were her sons.  But Mrs Willders did not know of the before-mentioned happy facility which her kinsman possessed of forgetting poor relations; so, after wondering on for a time, she ceased to wonder or to think about it at all.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  THOUGHTS IN REGARD TO MEN.  Miss Emelina Tippet was a maiden lady of pleasing countenance and exceedingly uncertain age.  She was a poor member of a poor branch of an aristocratic family, and feeling an unconquerable desire to breathe, if not the pure unadulterated atmosphere of Beverly Square, at least as much of it as was compatible with a very moderate income, she rented a small house in a very dark and dismal lane leading out of that great centre of refinement.  It is true that Beverly Square was not exactly the \"West End,\" but there are many degrees of West-endiness, so to speak, in the western neighbourhood of London, and this square was, in the opinion of Miss Tippet, the West-endiest place she knew, because there dwelt in it, not only a very genteel and uncommonly rich portion of the community, but several of her own aristocratic, though distant, relations, among whom was Mr Auberly.  The precise distance of the relationship between them had never been defined, and all records bearing on it having been lost in the mists of antiquity, it could not now be ascertained; but Miss Tippet laid claim to the relationship, and as she was an obliging, good-humoured, chatty, and musical lady, Mr Auberly admitted the claim.  Miss Tippet's only weakness--for she was indeed a most estimable woman-- was a tendency to allow rank and position to weigh too much in her esteem.  She had also a sensitive abhorrence of everything \"low and vulgar,\" which would have been, of course, a very proper feeling had she not fallen into the mistake of considering humble birth lowness, and want of polish vulgarity--a mistake which is often (sometimes even wilfully) made by persons who consider themselves much wiser than Miss Tippet, but who are not wise enough to see a distinct shade of true vulgarity in their own sentiments.  The dark, dismal lane, named Poorthing Lane, besides forming an asylum for decayed and would-be aristocrats, and a vestibule, as it were, to Beverly Square, was a convenient retreat for sundry green-grocers and public-house keepers and small trades-people, who supplied the densely-peopled surrounding district, and even some of the inhabitants of Beverly Square itself, with the necessaries of life.  It was also a thoroughfare for the gay equipages of the square, which passed through it daily on their way to and from the adjoining stables, thereby endangering the lives of precocious babies who could crawl, but could not walk away from home, as well as affording food for criticism and scandal, not to mention the leaving behind of a species of secondhand odour of gentility such as coachmen and footmen can give forth.  Miss Tippet's means being small, she rented a proportionately small residence, consisting of two floors, which were the upper portion of a house, whose ground floor was a toy-shop.  The owner of the toy-shop, David Boone, was Miss Tippet's landlord; but not the owner of the tenement.  He rented the whole, and sublet the upper portion.  Miss Tippet's parlour windows commanded a near view of the lodging opposite, into every corner and crevice of which she could have seen, had not the windows been encrusted with impenetrable dirt.  Her own domestic arrangements were concealed from view by small green venetian blinds, which rose from below, and met the large venetians which descended from above.  The good lady's bedroom windows in the upper floor commanded a near view--much too near--of a stack of chimneys, between which and another stack, farther over, she had a glimpse of part of the gable end of a house, and the topmost bough of a tree in Beverly Square.  It was this prospect into paradise, terrestrially speaking, that influenced Miss Tippet in the choice of her abode.  When William Willders reached the small door of Number 6, Poorthing Lane, and raised his hand to knock, the said door opened as if it had been trained to admit visitors of its own accord, and Miss Matty Merryon issued forth, followed by a bright blue-eyed girl of about twelve years of age.  \"Well, boy, was ye comin' here?\" inquired Matty, as the lad stepped aside to let them pass.  \"Yes, I was.  Does Miss Tippet live here?\"  \"She does, boy, what d'ye want with her?\"  \"I want to see her, young 'ooman, so you'd better cut away up an' tell her a gen'lm'n requests a few words private conversation with her.\"  The little girl laughed at this speech, and Matty, addressing Willie as a \"dirty spalpeen,\" said he had better go with her to a shop first, and she'd then take him back and introduce him to Miss Tippet.  \"You see I can't let ye in all be yer lone, cushla; for what would the neighbours say, you know!  I'm only goin' to the toy-shop, an' won't kape ye a minit, for Miss Emma don't take long to her bargains.\"  Willie might probably have demurred to this delay; but on hearing that the blue-eyed girl wanted to make purchases, he at once agreed to the proposal, and followed them into the toy-shop.  David Boone, who stepped out of the back-shop to serve them, was, if we may say so, very unlike his trade.  A grave, tall, long-legged, long-nosed, raw-boned, melancholy-looking creature such as he, might have been an undertaker, or a mute, or a sexton, or a policeman, or a horse-guardsman, or even a lawyer; but it was the height of impropriety to have made him a toy-shopman, and whoever did it had no notion whatever of the fitness of things.  One could not resist the idea that his clumsy legs would certainly upset the slender wooden toys with which the floor and counters were covered, and his fingers seemed made to break things.  The figure of Punch which hung from the ceiling appeared inclined to hit him as he passed to and fro, and the pretty little dolls with the sweet pink faces, and very flaxen hair and cerulean eyes were evidently laughing at him.  Nevertheless, David Boone was a kind-hearted man, very fond of children, and extremely unlike, in some respects, what people imagined him at first sight to be.  \"Well, Miss Ward, what can I supply you with to-day?\" said he blandly.  \"Please, Mr Boone, I want a slate and a piece of slate-pencil."]]]
