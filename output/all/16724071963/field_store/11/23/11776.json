There was something quite sly about his aspect, and more than once his companions caught him chuckling at breakfast in a way that surprised them much, for Fred Temple was not given to secrets, or to act in an outrageous manner without any apparent reason.  But Fred had his own peculiar thoughts that morning, and they tickled him to such an extent that more than once he burst into a fit of laughter.  \"Come, Fred, you're meditating something.  Out with it,\" said Grant. \"It is selfish to keep all your good thoughts to yourself.\"  \"Not yet, not yet,\" replied Fred, with a mysterious look.  \"You shall know before our excursion comes to an end.\"  Further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Hans Ericsson, who was impatient to get employment of any kind in order to earn a few dollars, and lay them up with a view to the future.  Fred took him aside, and said in a low tone--\"Hans, are you very anxious to wed Raneilda?\"  The young Norseman's face flushed, and he started as if he had received a blow.  \"Don't be angry, Hans,\" continued Fred; \"I ask the question because I think I can help you in the matter if you will allow me.  I do not ask it out of idle curiosity.  Come, tell me your troubles like a good fellow, and I'll put you in the way of getting out of them.\"  Hans was inclined to repel Fred's kind intentions at first, but the Englishman's open, honest manner won upon him so much that he related to him all his sorrows.  He was the son of Eric, who dwelt in a valley at the head of the Nord Fiord.  His father was too old to manage his farm, and Hans wished to take it up and work it on his own account.  But, in order to do so, he must buy up the shares of the other members of his family.  This would require 500 dollars.  He had worked hard for two years to make this sum, but there was still 200 dollars to pay.  He could make this in the course of time, but he had been engaged to Raneilda long, and he wished now to make her his wife.  In short, he was tired of waiting.  \"So, then, you would be glad to get some sort of work with good pay,\" said Fred.  \"Ya,\" said Hans, with a nod of his head.  \"Can you pilot a schooner from this to the Nord Fiord?\"  \"_Ya_, I know every island on the coast.\"  \"Good; then be ready to start this evening.  I shall send my vessel there in your charge, and I myself with my friends will travel overland and meet you there.  Farewell!\"  Hans went off to tell Raneilda, his handsome face beaming with joy.  \"Now,\" said Fred, returning to his friends, \"I have made arrangements with a pilot to take the _Snowflake_ round to the Nord Fiord, and we will travel overland to the same place and meet it.  The journey will be a very charming one of several days, through wild magnificent scenery. By the way, Grant, did you order the two sheep to be killed and sent aboard immediately?\"  \"Of course I did.  Have I not always proved myself a trustworthy messenger?  I told the man, in my best Norse, to have two `Kos' killed without delay.\"  \"Two what?\" exclaimed Fred, with a look of alarm.  \"Two Kos,\" returned Grant; \"did you not tell me that Ko is the Norse word for a sheep?\"  \"Why, as I live, you have ordered two _cows_ to be killed.  Quick, come with me to the butcher's!\"  The two friends rushed out of the house, and reached the shop of the man of meat just in time, fortunately, to arrest the fatal blow.  The order was of course countermanded, and they were thus saved the necessity of setting up a butcher's shop in Bergen to get rid of their superabundant beef!  That night the _Snowflake_ set sail for the far north, and next morning our three adventurers were galloping through the wilds of Norway.    CHAPTER FIVE.  CARIOLE TRAVELLING--MISERABLE LODGING AND POOR FARE--NATIVE PECULIARITIES--A NIGHT BATTLE.  As I am now about to drag my reader through the wild interior of Norway, let me try to describe it.  Don't be alarmed, dear reader, I do not mean to be tedious on this point, but I candidly confess that I am puzzled as to how I should begin!  Norway is _such_ a jumble of Nature's elements. Perhaps a jumbled description may answer the purpose better than any other.  Here it is, then.  Mountains, and crags, and gorges, and rocks, and serried ridges; towering peaks and dark ravines; lakes, and fords, and glens, and valleys; pine-woods, and glaciers, [For a full description of glaciers, see \"Fast in the Ice,\" page 86, volume 3 of this _Miscellany_] streamlets, rivulets, rivers, cascades, waterfalls, and cataracts.  Add to this--in summer--sweltering heat in the valleys and everlasting snow and ice on the mountain-tops, with sunlight all night as well as all day--and the description of Norway is complete.  No arrangement of these materials is necessary.  Conceive them arranged as you will, and no matter how wild your fancy, your conception will be a pretty fair idea of Norway.  Toes these elements into some chamber of your brain; shake them well up,--don't be timid about it,--then look at the result, and you will behold Norway!  Having said thus much, it is unnecessary to say more.  Rugged grandeur is the main feature of Norway.  On a lovely summer's evening, not long after the departure of the _Snowflake_ from Bergen, our three travellers found themselves trotting through a wild glen on each side of which rose a range of rugged mountains, and down the centre of which roared a small river.  The glen was so steep, and the bed of the torrent so broken, that there was not a spot of clear water in its whole course.  From the end of the lake out of which it flowed, to the head of the fiord or firth into which it ran, the river was one boiling, roaring mass of milk-white foam.  Fred Temple and his friends travelled in the ordinary vehicle of the country, which is called a _cariole_.  The Norwegian cariole holds only one person, and the driver or attendant sits on a narrow board above the axle-tree.  Of course it follows that each traveller in Norway must have a cariole and a pony to himself.  These are hired very cheaply, however.  You can travel post there at the rate of about twopence a mile!  Our friends had three carioles among them, three ponies, and three drivers or \"shooscarles,\" [This word is spelt as it should be pronounced] besides a small native cart to carry the luggage.  Their drive that day, and indeed every day since starting, had been emphatically up hill and down dale.  It was, therefore, impossible to cross such a country in the ordinary jog-trot manner.  When not ascending a steep hill, they were necessarily descending one; for the level parts of the land are few and far between.  In order, therefore, to get on at all, it was needful to descend the hills at a slapping pace, so as to make up for time lost in ascending them.  There was something delightfully wild in this mode of progressing, which gladdened the hearts of our travellers, each of whom had a strong dash of recklessness in his composition.  There was a little danger, too, connected with it, which made it all the more attractive.  Frequently the roads were narrow, and they wound along the top of precipices over which a false step might easily have hurled them.  At the foot of many of the roads, too, there were sharp turns, and it was a matter of intense delight to Sam Sorrel to try how fast he could gallop down and take the turn without upsetting.  The Norwegian ponies are usually small and cream-coloured, with black manes and tails or white manes and tails; always, from some incomprehensible reason, with manes and tails different in colour from their bodies.  They are hardy, active animals, and they seem to take positive pleasure in the rattling, neck-or-nothing scamper that succeeds each toilsome ascent.  The shooscarle is usually the owner of the pony.  He may be a man or a boy, but whether man or boy he almost invariably wears a red worsted nightcap.  He also wears coarse homespun trousers, immensely too long in the body, and a waistcoat monstrously too short.  He will hold the reins and drive if you choose, but most travellers prefer to drive themselves.  During the journey Fred Temple usually led the way.  Norman Grant, being a careless, easy-going, drowsy fellow, not to be trusted, was placed in the middle, and Sam Sorrel brought up the rear.  Sam's duty was to prevent straggling, and pick up stray articles or baggage.  On the day of which I write the three friends had travelled far, and were very sleepy.  It was near midnight when they came to a steep and broken part of the road, which ran alongside of the foaming river already mentioned, and, turning at a sharp angle, crossed it by means of a rude wooden bridge.  Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, the sky was almost as bright as at noon.  \"Mind yourself here,\" shouted Fred, looking back at Grant, who was almost asleep.  \"Hallo! oh, all right!\" cried Grant, gathering up the reins and attempting to drive.  Fortunately for him Norwegian ponies need no driving.  They are trained to look after themselves.  Fred went down the hill at a canter.  Grant followed at a spanking trot, and both of them reached the bridge, and made the turn in safety.  Sam Sorrel was some distance behind.  Both he and his shooscarle were sitting bolt-upright, more than half-asleep, with the reins hanging loose on the pony's back.  The first thing that awakened Sam was the feeling of going down hill like a locomotive engine.  Rousing himself, he seized the reins, and tried to check the pony.  This only confused it, and made it run the cariole so near to the edge of the river, that they were almost upset into it.  When Sam became fully aware of his position, he opened his eyes, pursed his lips, and prepared for \"squalls.\"  Not being a practised driver, he did not make sufficient allowance for a large stone which had fallen from the cliffs, and lay on the road.  He saw what was coming, and gathered himself up"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23262"],["title","Chasing the Sun (#6)"],["body"," a smash; but the tough little cariole took it as an Irish hunter takes a stone wall.  There was a tremendous crash. Sam's teeth came together with a snap, and the shooscarle uttered a roar; no wonder, poor fellow, for his seat being over the axle, and having no spring to it, the shock which he received must have been _absolutely_ shocking!  However, they got over that without damage, and the river was crossed by all three in safety.  The next hill they came to was a still worse one.  When they were half-way down the leader came to a sudden halt; Grant's cariole almost ran over it; Sam and the luggage-cart pulled up just in time, and so, from front to rear, they were jammed up into the smallest space they could occupy.  \"Hallo! what's wrong?\" shouted Grant.  \"Oh! nothing, only a trace or something broken,\" replied Fred.  \"Mend it in a minute.\"  It was mended in a minute, and away they went again on their reckless course over hill and dale.  The mending of the trace was a simple affair.  The harness of each pony consisted of nothing more than the reins, a wooden collar, and a wooden saddle.  The shafts were fastened to the collar by means of an iron pin, and this pin was secured in its place by a green withe or birch-bough twisted in a peculiar manner, so as to resemble a piece of rope.  This was the only part of the harness that could break, so that when an accident of the kind occurred the driver had only to step into the woods and cut a new one.  It is a rough-and-ready style of thing, but well suited to the rough country and the simple people of Norway.  Fred, being anxious to see as much as possible, had compelled his guide to turn out of the usual high-road, the consequence of which was that he soon got into difficulties; for although each shooscarle knew the district through which they were passing, they could not quite understand to what part of the country this peculiar Englishman was going.  This is not surprising, for the peculiar Englishman was not quite sure of that point himself!  On this particular night they seemed to have got quite lost among the hills.  At every stage of ten or twelve English miles they changed horses and drivers.  The drivers on this particular stage were more stupid than usual, or Fred Temple was not so bright.  Be that as it may, about midnight they arrived at a gloomy, savage place, lying deep among the hills, with two or three wooden huts, so poor-looking and so dirty that a well-bred dog would have objected to go into them.  Fred pulled up when he came to this place, and Grant's pony pulled up when his nose touched the back of Fred's cart.  Grant himself and his man were sound asleep.  In a few seconds Sam joined them.  There was a brilliant, rosy light on the mountain-tops, but this came down in a subdued form to the travellers in the valley.  The place scarcely deserved the name of a valley.  It was more of a gorge.  The mountains rose up like broken walls on each side, until they seemed to pierce the sky.  If you could fancy that a thunderbolt had split the mountain from top to bottom, and scattered great masses of rock all over the gorge thus formed, you would have an idea of the soft of place in which our belated travellers found themselves.  Yet even here there were little patches of cultivated ground, behind rocks and in out-of-the-way corners, where the poor inhabitants cultivated a little barley and grass for their cattle.  It was a lovely calm night.  Had you been there, reader, you would have said it was day, not night.  There was no sound to break the deep stillness of all around except the murmur of many cataracts of melted snow-water, that poured down the mountainsides like threads of silver or streams of milk.  But the rush of these was so mellowed by distance that the noise was soft and agreeable.  \"I say, Grant, this will never do,\" said Fred gravely.  \"I suppose not,\" returned Grant, with a yawn.  \"What say you, Sam,--shall we go on?\"  \"I think so.  They can have nothing to give us in such miserable huts as these except grod [barley-meal porridge], and sour milk, and dirty beds.\"  \"Perhaps not even so much as that,\" said Fred, turning to his driver. \"How far is it, my man, to the next station?\"  \"Ten miles, sir.\"  \"Hum; shall we go on, comrades?\"  \"Go on; forward!\" cried Grant and Sorrel.  So on they went as before, over hill and dale for ten miles, which poor Sam (who was very sleepy, but could not sleep in the cariole) declared were much more like twenty miles than ten.  The sun was up, and the birds were twittering, when they reached the next station.  But what was their dismay when they found that it was poorer and more miserable than the last!  It lay in a wilder gorge, and seemed a much more suitable residence for wolves and bears than for human beings.  Indeed, it was evident that the savage creatures referred to did favour that region with their presence, for the skin of a wolf and the skull of a bear were found hanging on the walls of the first hut the travellers entered.  The people in this hamlet were extremely poor and uncommonly stupid. Living as they did in an unfrequented district, they seldom or never saw travellers, and when Fred asked for something to eat, the reply he got at first was a stare of astonishment.  \"We must hunt up things for ourselves, I see,\" cried Sam Sorrel, beginning to search through the hut for victuals.  Seeing this, the people assisted him; but all that they could produce was a box of barley meat and two large flat dishes of sour milk.  This sour milk is a favourite dish with the Norwegians.  During summer the cattle are sent to the pastures high up in the mountains, in order to spare the small quantity of grass grown in the valleys, which is made into hay and stored for winter use.  These mountain pastures are called saeters, and the milk required by each family for daily use is carried down from the saeter by the girls.  The milk is put into round flat tubs, varying from one to two feet in diameter and four or five inches deep.  It is then allowed to stand, not only until it is sour, but until it is thick throughout like curd, with a thick coat of cream on the top. In this form it is eaten with a spoon, and a very pleasant sight it is to behold three or four sturdy herdsmen, and, perchance, one or two boys, squatting round one of these large dishes, and supping away to their hearts' content.  Grant seized the first dish of milk he discovered, and at once sat down on a stool and began to devour it.  \"Hold on, let us start fair!\" cried Sam Sorrel, catching up a spoon, and sitting down opposite his comrade on another stool.  The hut was built of rough logs, and the only furniture in it was of the rudest description; a couple of box-beds, two or three stools, and a bench, a gaily-painted chest in one corner, and a misshapen table was all that it contained.  There was a very small door at one side, a particularly small window at the other, and a raised stone fireplace at one end.  \"Well, while you two are stuffing yourselves with sour milk, I'll go and search for better fare,\" said Fred, with a laugh as he left the hut.  \"Good luck go with you,\" cried Grant; \"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  Now, then, old boy,\" he continued, turning to the owner of the hut, \"could your goodwife make us a little porridge; I say, Sam, what's the Norse for porridge?\"  \"Grod, [Grod is pronounced _groot_] I believe,\" said Sam, who was still busy with the sour milk.  \"Ah yes! grod, that's it,\" said Grant, turning again to the old man; \"grod, grod, get us some grod, grod, grod,--d'ye understand?\"  \"Ya, ya,\" answered the man.  It would have been very strange if he had _not_ understood, for though Grant addressed him in English the word _grod_ bawled so frequently into his ear was sufficiently comprehensible.  A fire was quickly kindled by the goodwife, a pleasant-looking elderly woman; and the black family-pot was soon smoking.  The old man was smoking too, in less than five minutes, for Grant, in the fulness of his heart, gave him a pipe and a lump of tobacco.  This man was a fine specimen of a hale old Norseman.  He wore a complete suit of brown homespun--excepting the jacket, which hung on a rusty nail in the wall.  Knee-breeches and worsted stockings showed that even in declining years he had a good pair of legs.  His grey hair hung in long straight locks over his shoulders, and on his head was the invariable red nightcap.  The only weakness for finery displayed by this old hero was in the matter of buttons and braces.  The buttons were polished brass of enormous size, and the braces were red.  These were displayed to great advantage in consequence of a space of full four inches intervening between the bottom of his vest and the waist-band of his breeches.  While the grod was being made, Fred Temple put up his fishing-rod and rambled away in search of a stream.  He had not to go far.  In about five minutes he found one that looked tempting.  At the very first cast a large fish rose so greedily that it leaped quite out of the water and missed the fly.  The next cast the fish caught the fly and Fred caught the fish.  It was a splendid yellow trout of about a pound weight.  In quarter of an hour Fred had three such trout in the pockets of his shooting-coat; in half an hour more the three fish were consigned by the three friends to the region of digestion!  And now the question of bed had to be considered.  Grant settled it as far as he was concerned by throwing himself down on a pile of brushwood that lay in a corner, pillowing his head on a three-legged stool, and going off to sleep at once.  Fred and Sam looked at the two beds.  They were extremely dirty, and it was evident that straw was the bedding.  \"Come, travellers must not be particular,\" cried Fred, as he tumbled into his box.  \"I couldn't hold my eyes open five minutes longer to save my life,\" muttered Sam, as he rolled over into the other.  In a minute the three"]]]
