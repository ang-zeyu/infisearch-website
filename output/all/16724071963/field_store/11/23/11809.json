This belonged to a student who, for the time being, was away from the school.  Once inside of this room, Randy and Andy took the others to where there was a door connecting that apartment with the one occupied by the sneak. This was partly open, so that they could look into Stowell's room with ease.  \"Hello there!\" they heard the sneak exclaim. And then followed the switching on of an electric light. \"It's only one of their rotten jokes! I knew it all along!\" murmured the cadet.  He looked around the room, and then a cry of astonishment burst from his lips. In the center of the floor were piled at least ten boxes of various sizes and shapes. Some of the boxes had had straw in them and others excelsior, and part of this was strewn on the floor.  \"Huh! Some of those fellows are mighty smart, putting these boxes in my room!\" growled Codfish to himself. \"I'd just like to know who did it! If it was that Spouter Powell, I think I'll go and tell on him!\"  \"Here is where I got in fine!\" murmured Spouter.  Codfish glanced further, and his eyes fell on the interior of the closet of the room, the door to which stood wide open. Then he gave a gasp.  \"My gracious! if they haven't taken all my clothing, and my hats, and even my shoes!\" he groaned. \"This is the worst yet!\" He rushed to the closet, and another look convinced him that the place was entirely empty. Then he ran to a corner where stood a clothes tree, which had contained some of his athletic outfit. This was likewise empty. Then he rushed to his chiffonier.  \"Gone! Everything gone! Not a thing left!\" he groaned. \"Oh, if this isn't the worst yet! If I don't tell on somebody for this!\"  Coming back to the middle of the room, he surveyed the pile of boxes suspiciously. Then a sheet of paper resting on the top box claimed his attention.  \"'For anything that is missing look in the boxes,'\" he read from the slip of paper. \"Oh, dear! I suppose those fellows were just mean enough to stuff all my things in those packing cases. I wonder what they did that for? Maybe they thought they were going to cart them down to the bonfire and burn them up, and burn all my stuff, too. Just wait and see if I don't fix somebody for this!\"  There was rather a small box on top of the others, and this Codfish started to open first. One end of the lid was nailed down, but the other was loose, and he pulled up on this with vigor.  And then the sneak got the first of a series of surprises. The lid of the box held down a large rubber frog, and this bounced out of the box, hitting him full in the face. He staggered back and fell over on his bed.  \"Hurrah! First round!\" whispered Andy delightedly.  \"Just wait for the second,\" said Randy.  There was nothing else in the box but excelsior, and having rummaged about in this, Codfish threw the box aside and started to investigate the next receptacle.  The lid to this was screwed on, and he had quite a job opening it. The other cadets watched with interest, doing their best to keep from laughing. When the box was opened, Codfish found that it contained a layer of excelsior. Under this, however, were a number of bundles wrapped in newspapers, each containing a small portion of the stuff taken from his chiffonier.  \"Huh! thought they were smart, didn't they?\" he muttered, as he put the things where they belonged. \"Just wait! I'll fix 'em for this.\"  The next box contained some of his clothing, which he hung in the closet. Then he tackled a rather large box which was bound up with an old clothesline. He had to tug at the line quite a little to get it loose, not thinking in his excitement that it would be easier to cut the line. The top of the box was filled with all sorts of rubbish. Beneath this were some more of his things, and then at the very bottom a rather small wooden box with a sliding cover.  Any ordinary school boy would have suspected some trick in connection with this box. But not so Codfish. He looked at it carefully, and then, bringing it close under the light, proceeded to pull the sliding cover back.  And then he was treated to another surprise, this time far more disagreeable than the other. The box contained a large codfish, one which, as Andy afterwards explained, had seen better days.  \"Phew, what a smell!\" cried the sneak, as he allowed the decayed codfish to fall out on the floor.  The odor when released from the air-tight box was so overpowering that he had to go over and throw open the window.  \"Codfish for the Codfish!\" sang out Andy gaily, unable to keep quiet any longer.  The sneak of the school whirled around suddenly, and there beheld in the doorway of the next room the Rover boys and their chums in a group, all grinning at him.  \"How'd you like the fish, Codfish?\" questioned Fred.  \"Thought you said you didn't have any boxes in your room,\" came from Jack.  \"I didn't know you were raising frogs for a living,\" remarked Randy.  \"Why don't you take those boxes down and put them on the bonfire?\" questioned Gif.  \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself--littering up your room with all that straw and excelsior,\" was Walt's comment. \"If you aren't careful, you'll get some mighty bad marks for doing that.\"  \"What did you do with the man who wanted to see you?\" questioned Spouter. \"Did you tell him that you were too busy to talk?\"  \"You're a fine bunch of fellows!\" howled Codfish, not knowing what to say. \"You had no business to play a trick like this on me!\"  \"Play a trick on you?\" questioned Andy innocently. \"Who has been playing a trick? Why, we don't know what it is to do anything like that!\"  \"I think somebody said you wanted to see us, but I don't know what for,\" added Randy.  \"If anybody should ask me, I would say you had a queer way of cleaning house, Codfish,\" remarked Fred calmly.  \"And to think he stole one of the codfish from the pantry!\" said Jack. \"By the way it smells, he must have taken it the day he enrolled here.\"  \"Maybe he likes codfish good and strong,\" suggested Gif.  \"I'll 'codfish' you fellows if you don't leave me alone!\" howled the sneak. He was so vexed he almost felt like crying. \"You just wait till Colonel Colby or Captain Dale hears about this!\"  \"Yes, I wonder what the colonel will say when he finds out you stole one of the codfish belonging to the school,\" said Andy. \"You oughtn't to have done it, Henry, my boy. If you wanted anything to eat, why didn't you ask one of the teachers for it?\"  \"Maybe he chews on codfish in the middle of the night when he can't sleep, or when he is trying to solve a problem in algebra,\" suggested Randy.  \"I don't do any such thing, and I didn't take that codfish from the pantry, and you know it!\" howled Codfish, in anger. \"It's a put-up job, and you are the fellows who did it! All of you ought to be sent away from this school.\"  \"If he took a codfish, maybe he took some other things, too,\" said Jack. \"I think this ought to be investigated.\"  \"And how did you happen to get all these boxes?\" demanded Fred. \"I know them. They were collected for the bonfire some days ago.\"  \"You certainly have no right to have them in your room, Codfish,\" said Gif. \"Better hustle 'em down and put 'em on the fire before the rest of the fellows hear of this.\"  \"And if you've got things belonging to the school victuals besides that codfish, you'd better fork 'em over,\" admonished Jack.  \"You clear out, every one of you! I don't want to hear another word!\" screamed Codfish, in a rage. \"You just wait until I report you! I think you're all too mean for anything! Go on away!\" And he tried to close the door to the other room in their faces. But they held it back so he could do nothing.  \"Come on, fellows, let's put those boxes where they belong!\" cried Jack. And, marching into the room, he picked up one of the packing cases, and the others quickly followed suit. Then they marched out into the hallway, leaving Codfish staring after them in bewilderment.  \"I know you've got some other things belonging to the school besides that fish!\" cried Andy. \"You've got the pockets of your overcoat just stuffed with good things!\"  \"Haven't any such thing!\" declared the sneak. And then, struck by a sudden idea, he ran to the clothing closet and brought forth his overcoat, which had been in one of the boxes. He rammed his hand into one of the pockets, and then suddenly withdrew it with a yell of fright and pain.  And his fright and pain were not without good reason, for clinging to the thumb of the hand he had inserted into the pocket of the overcoat was a small, but exceedingly active, snapping turtle!     CHAPTER VIII  AN INTERRUPTED FEAST   \"Oh, oh, oh!\" yelled Codfish, dancing around the room wildly. \"Take that thing off! Oh, I'll be bitten to death! Take it off, somebody! What is it, anyhow?\"  \"Hello! Codfish has been fishing,\" cried Andy gaily.  \"Maybe he got that from the cook's pantry, too,\" broke in Randy.  \"What's the dear creature's name, Codfish?\" questioned Fred.  \"You haven't got to let go of him if you don't want to, you know,\" came from Jack.  All this while the sneak of the school was dancing around the room, doing his best to shake off the snapping turtle. But the creature, though small, had a hold that was very tenacious, and refused to budge.  \"Say, he won't be seriously bitten, will he?\" questioned Spouter, in a low tone.  \"No, it's only a baby snapping turtle,\" answered Andy slowly. \"Codfish is far more scared than hurt.\"  The sneak of the school was so frightened that he did not dare to take hold of the snapping turtle. He held the creature out at arm's length and continued to dance around, asking the others to take it off.  \"He'll eat my finger!\"  \"Put it in some water and it will let go quick enough,\" suggested Fred presently.  \"Yes, give him a chance to swim around in a bathtub,\" added Randy quickly, when he saw Stowell make a move toward the washbowl in one corner of the room. \"That isn't big enough for a good healthy turtle.\"  \"Oh, oh!

There were cotton mills in the town; in fact, had there not been probably no town would have existed. The mills had not been attracted to the town; the town had arisen because of the mills. The river was responsible for the whole thing, for its swift current and foaming cascades had brought the mills, and the mills in turn had brought the village.  Ted's father was a shipping clerk in one of the factories and his two older sisters were employed there also. Some day Ted himself expected to enter the great brick buildings, as the boys of the town usually did, and work his way up. Perhaps in time he might become a superintendent or even one of the firm. Who could tell? Such miracles did happen. Not that Ted Turner preferred a life in the cotton mills to any other career. Not at all. Deep down in his soul he detested the humming, panting, noisy place with its clatter of wheels, its monotonous piecework, and its limited horizon. But what choice had he? The mills were there and the only alternative before him. It was the mills or nothing for people seldom came to live at Freeman's Falls if they did not intend to enter the factories of Fernald and Company. It was Fernald and Company that had led his father to sell the tumble-down farm in Vermont and move with his family to New Hampshire.  \"There is no money in farming,\" announced he, after the death of Ted's mother. \"Suppose we pull up stakes and go to some mill town where we can all find work.\"  And therefore, without consideration for personal preferences, they had looked up mill towns and eventually settled on Freeman's Falls, not because they particularly liked its location but because labor was needed there. A very sad decision it was for Ted who had passionately loved the old farm on which he had been born, the half-blind gray horse, the few hens, and the lean Jersey cattle that his father asserted ate more than they were worth. To be cooped up in a manufacturing center after having had acres of open country to roam over was not an altogether joyous prospect. Would there be any chestnut, walnut, or apple trees at Freeman's Falls, he wondered.  Alas, the question was soon answered. Within the village there were almost no trees at all except a few sickly elms and maples whose foliage was pale for want of sunshine and grimy with smoke. In fact, there was not much of anything in the town save the long dingy factories that bordered the river; the group of cheap and gaudy shops on the main street; and rows upon rows of wooden houses, all identical in design, walling in the highway. It was not a spot where green things flourished. There was not room for anything to grow and if there had been the soot from the towering chimneys would soon have settled upon any venturesome leaf or flower and quickly shrivelled it beneath a cloak of cinders. Even the river was coated with a scum of oil and refuse that poured from the waste pipes of the factories into the stream and washed up along the shores which might otherwise have been fair and verdant.  Of course, if one could get far enough away there was beauty in plenty for in the outlying country stretched vistas of splendid pines, fields lush with ferns and flowers, and the unsullied span of the river, where in all its mountain-born purity it rushed gaily down toward the village. Here, well distant from the manufacturing atmosphere, were the homes of the Fernalds who owned the mills, the great estates of Mr. Lawrence Fernald and Mr. Clarence Fernald who every day rolled to their offices in giant limousines. Everybody in Freeman's Falls knew them by sight,--the big boss, as he was called, and his married son; and everybody thought how lucky they were to own the mills and take the money instead of doing the work. At least, that was what gossip said they did.  Unquestionably it was much nicer to live at Aldercliffe, the stately colonial mansion of Mr. Lawrence Fernald; or at Pine Lea, the home of Mr. Clarence Fernald, where sweeping lawns, bright awnings, gardens, conservatories, and flashing fountains made a wonderland of the place. Troupes of laughing guests seemed always to be going and coming at both houses and there were horses and motor-cars, tennis courts, a golf course, and canoes and launches moored at the edge of the river. Freeman's Falls was a very stupid spot when contrasted with all this jollity. It must be far pleasanter, too, when winter came to hurry off to New York for the holidays or to Florida or California, as Mr. Clarence Fernald frequently did.  With money enough to do whatever one pleased, how could a person help being happy? And yet there were those who declared that both Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Clarence Fernald would have bartered their fortunes to have had the crippled heir to the Fernald millions strong like other boys. Occasionally Ted had caught a glimpse of this Laurie Fernald, a fourteen-year-old lad with thin, colorless face and eyes that were haunting with sadness. In the village he passed as \"the poor little chap\" or as \"poor Master Laurie\" and the employees always doffed their caps to him because they pitied him. Whether one liked Mr. Fernald or Mr. Clarence or did not, every one united in being sorry for Mr. Laurie. Perhaps the invalid realized this; at any rate, he never failed to return the greetings accorded him with a smile so gentle and sweet that it became a pleasure in the day of whomsoever received it.  It was said at the factories that the reason the Fernalds went to New York and Florida and California was because of Mr. Laurie; that was the reason, too, why so many celebrated doctors kept coming to Pine Lea, and why both Mr. Fernald and Mr. Clarence were often so sharp and unreasonable. In fact, almost everything the Fernalds did or did not do, said or did not say, could be traced back to Mr. Laurie. From the moment the boy was born--nay, long before--both Mr. Lawrence Fernald for whom he was named, and his father, Mr. Clarence Fernald, had planned how he should inherit the great mills and carry on the business they had founded. For years they had talked and talked of what should happen when Mr. Laurie grew up. And then had come the sudden and terrible illness, and after weeks of anxiety everybody realized that if Mr. Laurie lived he would be fortunate, and that he would never be able to carry on any business at all.  In what hushed tones the townspeople talked of the tragedy and how they speculated on what the Fernalds would do _now_. And how surprised the superintendent of one of the mills (who, by the way, had six husky boys of his own) had been to have Mr. Lawrence Fernald bridle with rage when he said he was sorry for him. A proud old man was Mr. Fernald, senior. He did not fancy being pitied, as his employees soon found out."]]]
