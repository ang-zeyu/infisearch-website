To this individual the sentry explained the reason for the visit and the request for an interview.  Jimmie was not left long in doubt.  Almost instantly, it seemed, the guard returned and, after exchanging a few words in a low tone with the sentry, beckoned for the soldier and the lad to follow.  He led the way into the tent, raising the flap for Jimmie and his captor to pass.  More than ever the lad felt his appellation of The Wolf was well deserved.  It seemed to him that circumstances were conspiring to make him seem to the Germans a predatory animal, and while he would have been willing and was even anxious to dispel this notion from their minds, he well understood that nothing he could do or say would be of effect in this direction.  Feeling keenly the need of most careful handling of the situation, Jimmie glanced quickly and furtively about the tent.  He was somewhat surprised to observe there a number of officers of the regiment apparently in conference.  A number of papers, amongst them maps, was spread upon the little table in the center of the tent.  Captain von Liebknecht had patently been directing certain movements of troops, using the maps to further explain his instructions.  Jimmie's entrance had interrupted the Captain's action of tracing with his finger the line of railroad leading from Peremysl, or Przemysl, as it must henceforth be known.  As the Captain raised his eyes to observe who his visitors might be, Jimmie let his glance fall to the map, where he saw the finger pointing at the town designated as Cracow.  In a flash the boy realized that von Liebknecht had been giving instructions for the transportation of troops by rail, and that Cracow would be the next stopping point, where he guessed that the horses would be detrained for water and rest if possible.  Mentally making a note of this fact, Jimmie raised his glance fearlessly to meet the cold blue eyes of the German officer.  In that glance Jimmie comprehended the fact that he could expect little mercy from a man whose whole ambition in life seemed to be unquestioning and unwavering devotion to his Emperor.  He read also in the blue eyes craft and skill in diplomacy and a keen intelligence withal.  \"Captain,\" began the soldier who had brought Jimmie to the tent, \"this Cossack has been giving information to his Russian friends.\"  Jimmie detected without any difficulty the implied sneer in the term \"Cossack,\" but forebore making any reply on the instant.  \"So?\" observed von Liebknecht.  \"Again?  Must we always be troubled at critical times with this wonderful recruit?\"  As none of the group seemed able to reply, silence was the only response.  The Captain let his glance wander about from one to another of his aides.  His eyes rested for a moment upon the countenance of a member of the group apparently older than the others.  An almost imperceptible shake of the head answered the questioning glance.  For some reason The Wolf felt a sense of relief.  \"What have you to say for yourself, young man?\" asked the Captain.  \"I guess I said enough before I enlisted,\" answered Jimmie.  \"Yet you have now some secret information,\" demanded the other.  \"No, sir,\" protested the lad in wide-eyed amazement.  \"No?\" queried von Liebknecht in his accustomed level tones.  \"Then what is it you have in that little packet you took from the Cossack uniform at so great a cost as a burned hand?\" he added.  Involuntarily Jimmie's hand clutched at his breast.     CHAPTER VIII  FRUSTRATED PLANS  \"Good night!\" was David's ejaculation as the boys saw Jimmie at the hilltop being captured by the German.  \"That ends it, I suppose!\"  \"No,\" protested Ned, \"it just begins the work.  Up to now we have been only playing, but here's where the real work starts.\"  \"What do you mean--'real work'?\" was Jack's anxious inquiry.  \"Why,\" replied Ned, \"they've got Jimmie enlisted in that Uhlan regiment, and you can plainly see how closely they are watching him. If we get him away from those fellows it means real work for all.\"  \"Aw!  Go on!\" put in Harry.  \"I move we go back to the cellar and get a bunch of those Russian rifles with sufficient ammunition, fill the tanks of the Eagle with some of this gasoline, get aboard a lot of canned goods and swoop down on the German camp like a hawk after some chickens.  We can let down a trapeze for Jimmie to grab onto.\"  \"Sounds easy, doesn't it?\" remarked David with a short laugh.  \"Easy?\" questioned Harry.  \"You don't seem to know Jimmie very well or you would mean just what you say.  He can do it all right!\"  \"But, I say,\" replied David, \"wouldn't those German soldiers be on the alert when we approached?  Wouldn't they jolly well shoot us full of holes, and wouldn't they make it rather difficult that way?\"  \"Now, see here, Dave,\" argued Harry, \"if you could have seen Jimmie when he rescued Havens, the aviator, in British Columbia by dropping from our aeroplane to that of Havens by means of a single rope, you wouldn't think the trick so very impossible.\"  \"Of course,\" admitted David, \"I have no doubt your friend is a wonder, although I have never met him.  It is not so much his ability I question as it is the possibility of our getting to him without being detected by the Germans.  My word, that is a big task.\"  \"Evidently there are a number of things you don't know,\" returned Harry, it must be said in a somewhat boastful manner.  \"We'll have to introduce you to Mr. Ned Nestor, the champion aviator of the Wolf Patrol of New York City.  And,\" the boy added, \"that means, of course, the United States.  He is some aviator, I tell you!\"  \"Why didn't you make it the world while you were at it?\" asked Jack quizzically, regarding Harry with an amused smile.  \"Well, I guess I wouldn't have been far wrong at that,\" contended Harry with a glance of pride in Ned's direction.  \"As the Irishman would say, Ned has 'a way wid him,' and you know it as well as I do.\"  \"I'll not be the last one to admit that Ned certainly can coax an aeroplane into doing stunts that seem marvelous, but I agree with Dave here that unless our chum has some way of striking the Germans blind and deaf we have a mighty slim chance of picking Jimmie up.\"  Harry's glance of contempt at his comrade was withering in the extreme. So great was his faith in Ned's ability that he would not have hesitated at anything, no matter what the conditions.  \"I move,\" Harry went on, \"that we cut out this argument, rob the Russian cache back there in the cellar, and make ourselves scarce around here while the 'beating' still remains in good condition.\"  \"I second the motion,\" added Ned, \"so far as the matter of getting out of Peremysl is concerned.  We can take up the other matter later on.\"  \"Those in favor say 'Aye',\" said Jack, turning upon his heel and starting back toward the base of supplies the boys had discovered under the pilotage of young Gilmore, the Vancouver Moose.  \"The 'Ayes' have it!\" announced Harry, preparing to follow his chum. \"What do you need most, Ned, and what will you have first?\"  \"Well, I guess we need something to eat, and a little more gasoline wouldn't go so bad,\" stated Ned, picking up one of the empty vessels in which gasoline had been brought to the Eagle.  \"Sure enough!\" cried Jack.  \"I clean forgot the gasoline business. Watch me give an imitation of a Boy Scout carrying water for the elephant, only in this case the elephant happens to be an 'Eagle'.\"  In spite of the seriousness of the situation in which the boys found themselves, David could not repress a laugh of merriment and appreciation of the light-hearted manner in which Harry and Jack met the difficulties and dangers surrounding the little party.  \"I say, lads,\" he began, as the four boys took their way carefully from the site on which the Eagle rested toward the underground cavern they had recently quitted, \"there's plenty for us in that storeroom, and all we need to do is help ourselves.  If only we are not interrupted by some of the Germans patrolling the town, we will be all right.\"  \"Let me get my hands on one perfectly good shooting iron, with some cartridges,\" stated Jack, \"and it will go pretty hard with any German who endeavors to stop us before we get good and going!\"  \"Now, Jack,\" protested Ned, \"that 'shooting iron' business will have to be postponed, I'm afraid, until such time as we are more nearly out of the woods than we are just now.  It wouldn't be quite the thing.\"  \"Oh, of course,\" said Jack in a tone intended to appear sulky, but with a covert wink at Harry, \"somebody is always taking the joy out of life. Why can't I just shoot up a few Dutchmen, I'd like to know?\"  \"Because they might not think it polite,\" answered Ned seriously. \"Besides,\" he added, \"it wouldn't be strictly in accordance with Boy Scout principles, as you yourself will admit.\"  \"Well,\" observed David with a sigh, \"when I consider some of the things that have happened during the last few days and weeks, I am almost ready to admit that I'd like to resign temporarily.\"  \"Why?\" asked Ned.  \"Have the Germans been doing things to you?\"  \"Well,\" stated David, \"isn't their capture and treatment of Jimmie sufficient to make us want to do things to them?\"  \"Yes, it is,\" admitted Ned, \"but at the same time we must remember that 'two wrongs never make a right,' and, according to my recollection, number ten of the Boy Scout laws states that a scout is brave and has the courage to face danger in spite of fear, and defeat does not down him.\"  \"Yes,\" put in Jack, \"and number three, which we all know so well, states that a scout must do one good turn to somebody every day.\"  \"Am I to understand that you would not consider shooting a German a good turn?\" asked Harry, who was slightly in the lead.  \"A good turn to whom?\" asked Ned, following closely upon Jack's heels. \"Would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22994"],["title","The Frontier in American History (#0)"],["body","(https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes images of the original pages.

THE FRONTIER IN AMERICAN HISTORY  by  FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER        [Illustration]   New York Henry Holt and Company 1921  Copyright, 1920 by Frederick J. Turner   TO CAROLINE M. TURNER MY WIFE     PREFACE   In republishing these essays in collected form, it has seemed best to issue them as they were originally printed, with the exception of a few slight corrections of slips in the text and with the omission of occasional duplication of language in the different essays. A considerable part of whatever value they may possess arises from the fact that they are commentaries in different periods on the central theme of the influence of the frontier in American history. Consequently they may have some historical significance as contemporaneous attempts of a student of American history, at successive transitions in our development during the past quarter century to interpret the relations of the present to the past. Grateful acknowledgment is made to the various societies and periodicals which have given permission to reprint the essays.  Various essays dealing with the connection of diplomatic history and the frontier and others stressing the significance of the section, or geographic province, in American history, are not included in the present collection. Neither the French nor the Spanish frontier is within the scope of the volume.  The future alone can disclose how far these interpretations are correct for the age of colonization which came gradually to an end with the disappearance of the frontier and free land. It alone can reveal how much of the courageous, creative American spirit, and how large a part of the historic American ideals are to be carried over into that new age which is replacing the era of free lands and of measurable isolation by consolidated and complex industrial development and by increasing resemblances and connections between the New World and the Old.  But the larger part of what has been distinctive and valuable in America's contribution to the history of the human spirit has been due to this nation's peculiar experience in extending its type of frontier into new regions; and in creating peaceful societies with new ideals in the successive vast and differing geographic provinces which together make up the United States. Directly or indirectly these experiences shaped the life of the Eastern as well as the Western States, and even reacted upon the Old World and influenced the direction of its thought and its progress. This experience has been fundamental in the economic, political and social characteristics of the American people and in their conceptions of their destiny.  Writing at the close of 1796, the French minister to the United States, M. Adet, reported to his government that Jefferson could not be relied on to be devoted to French interests, and he added: \"Jefferson, I say, is American, and by that name, he cannot be sincerely our friend. An American is the born enemy of all European peoples.\" Obviously erroneous as are these words, there was an element of truth in them. If we would understand this element of truth, we must study the transforming influence of the American wilderness, remote from Europe, and by its resources and its free opportunities affording the conditions under which a new people, with new social and political types and ideals, could arise to play its own part in the world, and to influence Europe.

In the discussion of its extent, its westward movement, etc., it can not, therefore, any longer have a place in the census reports.\" This brief official statement marks the closing of a great historic movement. Up to our own day American history has been in a large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.  Behind institutions, behind constitutional forms and modifications, lie the vital forces that call these organs into life and shape them to meet changing conditions. The peculiarity of American institutions is, the fact that they have been compelled to adapt themselves to the changes of an expanding people--to the changes involved in crossing a continent, in winning a wilderness, and in developing at each area of this progress out of the primitive economic and political conditions of the frontier into the complexity of city life. Said Calhoun in 1817, \"We are great, and rapidly--I was about to say fearfully--growing!\"[2:1] So saying, he touched the distinguishing feature of American life. All peoples show development; the germ theory of politics has been sufficiently emphasized. In the case of most nations, however, the development has occurred in a limited area; and if the nation has expanded, it has met other growing peoples whom it has conquered. But in the case of the United States we have a different phenomenon. Limiting our attention to the Atlantic coast, we have the familiar phenomenon of the evolution of institutions in a limited area, such as the rise of representative government; the differentiation of simple colonial governments into complex organs; the progress from primitive industrial society, without division of labor, up to manufacturing civilization. But we have in addition to this a recurrence of the process of evolution in each western area reached in the process of expansion. Thus American development has exhibited not merely advance along a single line, but a return to primitive conditions on a continually advancing frontier line, and a new development for that area. American social development has been continually beginning over again on the frontier. This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character. The true point of view in the history of this nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West. Even the slavery struggle, which is made so exclusive an object of attention by writers like Professor von Holst, occupies its important place in American history because of its relation to westward expansion.  In this advance, the frontier is the outer edge of the wave--the meeting point between savagery and civilization. Much has been written about the frontier from the point of view of border warfare and the chase, but as a field for the serious study of the economist and the historian it has been neglected.  The American frontier is sharply distinguished from the European frontier--a fortified boundary line running through dense populations. The most significant thing about the American frontier is, that it lies at the hither edge of free land. In the census reports it is treated as the margin of that settlement which has a density of two or more to the square mile. The term is an elastic one, and for our purposes does not need sharp definition. We shall consider the whole frontier belt, including the Indian country and the outer margin of the \"settled area\" of the census reports. This paper will make no attempt to treat the subject exhaustively; its aim is simply to call attention to the frontier as a fertile field for investigation, and to suggest some of the problems which arise in connection with it.  In the settlement of America we have to observe how European life entered the continent, and how America modified and developed that life and reacted on Europe. Our early history is the study of European germs developing in an American environment. Too exclusive attention has been paid by institutional students to the"]]]
