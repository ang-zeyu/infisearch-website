Then there set in a flood of allegorical and fantastic absurdities, by which the fair domain of Heraldry was absolutely overwhelmed. Wild and strange speculations, in a truly vain philosophy, interwoven with distorted images of both the myths and the veritable records of classic antiquity, were either deduced from armorial blazonry, or set forth as the sources from whence it was developed. Fables and anecdotes, having reference to less remote eras, were produced in great variety and in copious abundance. The presence in blazon of animated beings of whatsoever kinds, whether real or fabulous, led to rambling disquisitions in the most ludicrously _un_natural of imaginary Natural History. From every variety also of inanimate figure and device, the simplest no less than the more elaborate, after the same fashion some “moral” was sought to be extracted. The technical language, too, of the early Heralds, had its expressive simplicity travestied by a complicated jargon, replete with marvellous assertions, absurd doctrines, covert allusions devoid of consistent significance, quaint and yet trivial conceits, and bombastic rhapsodies. Even the nomenclature of the Tinctures was not exempt from a characteristic course of “treatment,” two distinctive additional sets of titles for gold, silver, blue, red, &c., having been devised and substituted for those in general use (see Chapter V.); of these the one set was derived from the names of the _Planets_, and employed to emblazon the insignia of Sovereign Princes; and the other set, derived from the names of _Jewels_, was applied to the arms of Nobles. In the midst of all the rubbish, however, which they thus delighted to accumulate, there may generally be discovered in the works of writers of this class, here and there, references to earlier usages and illustrations of original principles which, in the extreme dearth of genuine early heraldic literature, are both interesting and of real value. Nor are these writings without their value, estimated from another point of view, as contemporaneous and unconscious commentaries upon the history of their own times. It must be added that, in more than a few instances, beneath the surface there lurks a vein of both political and personal allusion, of which the point and bearing now are altogether lost, or at the most are only open to conjecture and surmise. And, again, even in their most extravagant and frivolous lucubrations, the heraldic writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are not without touches of humour; as when Gerard Legh (A.D. 1562), discoursing of “beastes,” remarks of the “Ramme” that in “aucthoritye he is a Duke, for hee hath the leadyng of multitudes and flockes of his own kynde;” and of the ass, “I could write much of this beaste, but that it might be thought it were to mine own glorie.”  The adoption of additional quarterings for the purpose of display, and the introduction of more complicated compositions in the time of HENRY VIII., were speedily followed by the substitution of pictorial representations, often of a most frivolous and inconsistent character, and many of them altogether unintelligible without written explanations, instead of the simple, dignified, and expressive insignia of true Heraldry. For example, in the year 1760, a grant of arms was made to a Lincolnshire family named Tetlow, which, with thirteen other figures, includes the representation of a book duly clasped and ornamented, having on it a silver penny; while above the book rests a dove, holding in its beak a crow-quill! This was to commemorate one of the family having, with a crow-quill, actually achieved the exploit of writing the Lord’s Prayer within the compass of a silver penny. Amongst the most objectionable of the arms of this class are those which were granted to distinguished naval and military officers--arms, that certainly ought to have conferred fresh honour on illustrious names, instead of inflicting dishonour upon Heraldry itself. Battles by sea and land, landscapes and sea views and fortified cities, flags of all kinds, with medals and ribbons, all of them intermixed with devices not quite so unheraldic, abound in these extravagant compositions. The arms of Lord Nelson, and still more recently those of General Lord Gough, may be specified as flagrant examples of this degenerate pictorial Heraldry. The Duke of Wellington happily escaped a similar infliction. It would be but too easy to enumerate other equally inconsistent and unheraldic compositions: but, I must be content to refer only to the armorial shield granted to the great astronomer, Sir John Herschel, on which is displayed his forty-foot reflecting telescope, with all its apparatus! These, and all such violations of heraldic truth and consistency, though in some instances they are of very recent date, are now to be assigned to a closed chapter in the history of English Heraldry. But in considering them it must not be forgotten that this kind of grant was not confined to this country, but flourished to a still greater extent abroad.  In our present revival of English Heraldry, it is essential that we impress upon our minds a correct conception of the twofold character of all Heraldry--that it is a _Science_, and also that it is an _Art_. We have to vindicate the reputation of our Heraldry, as well in the one capacity as in the other. Of very noble heraldic Art we happily possess original examples in great numbers, which have been bequeathed to us, as a precious inheritance, from “the brave days of old.” The style of Art that we see exemplified in these early authorities we may accept almost unreservedly as our own style; and we must aspire to sympathise heartily with their genuine heraldic feeling. In our representation, also, of almost all inanimate and natural objects in our own armorial compositions, as a general rule, we may trust confidently to the same good guidance. The early method of representation, indeed, must form the basis of our system of treatment; and, we may faithfully adhere to this rule, and yet occasionally we may find it to be desirable that the form and the accessories of some devices should be adapted to modern associations. In truth, it is not by merely copying the works of even the greatest of the early heraldic artists, that we are to become masters in heraldic Art. When the copies are good, copying is always valuable, as a branch of study; but, if it be our highest and only aim to reproduce the expressions of other men’s thoughts, then copying is worse than worthless. What we have to do is to express our heraldic Art in the spirit of the early Heralds, to keep it in harmony with what, in the best of the early days, they would have accepted as the highest heraldic Art, and at the same time to show that our heraldic Art in very truth is our own.    [Illustration: No. 24.--Prince JOHN OF ELTHAM, A.D. 1336.]    [Illustration: Nos. 25, 26.--Badge of RICHARD II., Westminster Hall.]  The treatment of animate creatures in Heraldry requires a certain kind, and also a certain degree, of conventionalism. Here, as before, in the early Heralds we have excellent masters; but, here we must follow their teaching with more of reserve, and with cautious steps. We recognise the happy consistency of the conventionalism which they displayed in their representation of animate creatures, without any purpose to adopt it in the same degree with them. Had the early Heralds been more familiar with the living presence of the various creatures that they summoned to enter into their service, without a doubt they would have represented them with a much closer conformity to Nature. We must apply our better knowledge, as we may feel confident the early Heralds would have applied a similar knowledge had they been able to have acquired it. Heraldic animals of every kind--lions, eagles, dolphins, and all others--must be so far subjected to a conventional treatment, that they will not exhibit a _strictly_ natural appearance: and, on the other hand, being carefully preserved from all exaggerated conventionalisms, they must approach as near to Nature as a definite conventional rendering of natural truth will admit. The lions of the early Heralds, spirited beasts always, generally show a decided disposition to exhibit their heraldic sympathies in excess. They have in them rather too much that is heraldic conventionalism, and not quite enough that is natural lion. And, with the first symptoms of decline in heraldic Art, the treatment of lions showed signs of a tendency to carry conventionalism to the utmost extravagance. The same remarks are applicable to eagles. It must be added, however, that truly admirable examples of heraldic animals occasionally may be found as late even as the commencement of the sixteenth century, as in the chantry of Abbot Ramryge, in the Abbey Church at St. Alban’s, and in King’s College Chapel at Cambridge. It must be our care to blend together the true attributes of the living lion and eagle, and those also of other living creatures, with the traditional peculiarities of their heraldic representatives. And we must extend the corresponding application of the same principles of treatment to imaginary beings and heraldic monsters, as they occur in our Heraldry. The shield, No. 24, of Prince JOHN OF ELTHAM, younger brother of EDWARD III., finely sculptured with his effigy in alabaster, in Westminster Abbey (A.D. 1336), and in perfect preservation, gives us characteristic examples of lions of the best heraldic era, their frames, attenuated as they are, being perfect types of fierce elasticity. With this shield may be grouped others, having admirably suggestive examples of heraldic lions of a somewhat later date, which are preserved upon the monuments of EDWARD III. and the BLACK PRINCE, severally at Westminster and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23194"],["title","The Common Man (#0)"],["body","Common Man   It would, of course, take a trio  of Ivory Tower scientists to conceive of  tracking down that statistical entity,  the Common Man, and testing out an idea on him.  And only the Ivory Tower type would predict  that egregiously wrongly!  by Guy McCord  Illustrated by Schelling  [Illustration]   Frederick Braun, M.D., Ph.D., various other Ds, pushed his slightly crooked horn-rims back on his nose and looked up at the two-story wooden house. There was a small lawn before it, moderately cared for, and one tree. There was the usual porch furniture, and the house was going to need painting in another six months or so, but not quite yet. There was a three-year-old hover car parked at the curb of a make that anywhere else in the world but America would have been thought ostentatious in view of the seeming economic status of the householder.  Frederick Braun looked down at the paper in his hand, then up at the house again. He said to his two companions, \"By Caesar, I will admit it is the most average-looking dwelling I have ever seen.\"  Patricia O'Gara said impatiently, \"Well, do we or don't we?\" Her hair should have been in a pony tail, or bouncing on her shoulders, or at least in the new Etruscan revival style, not drawn back in its efficient bun.  Ross Wooley was unhappy. He scratched his fingers back through his reddish crew cut. \"This is going to sound silly.\"  Patricia said testily, \"We've been through all that, Rossie, good heavens.\"  \"Nothing ventured, nothing ...\" Braun let the sentence dribble away as he stuffed the paper into a coat pocket, which had obviously been used as a waste receptacle for many a year, and led the way up the cement walk, his younger companions immediately behind.  He put his finger on the doorbell and cocked his head to one side. There was no sound from the depths of the house. Dr. Braun muttered, \"Bell out of order.\"  \"It would be,\" Ross chuckled sourly. \"Remember? Average. Here, let me.\" He rapped briskly on the wooden door jamb. They stood for a moment then he knocked again, louder, saying almost as though hopefully, \"Maybe there's nobody home.\"  \"All right, all right, take it easy,\" a voice growled even as the door opened.  He was somewhere in his thirties, easygoing of face, brownish of hair, bluish of eye and moderately good-looking. His posture wasn't the best and he had a slight tummy but he was a goodish masculine specimen by Mid-Western standards. He stared out at them, defensive now that it was obvious they were strangers. Were they selling something, or in what other manner were they attempting to intrude on his well being? His eyes went from the older man's thin face, to the football hero heft of the younger, then to Patricia O'Gara. His eyes went up and down her figure and became approving in spite of the straight business suit she affected.  He said, \"What could I do for you?\"  \"Mr. Crowley?\" Ross said.  \"That's right.\"  \"I'm Ross Wooley and my friends are Patricia O'Gara and Dr. Frederick Braun. We'd like to talk to you.\"  \"There's nobody sick here.\"  Patricia said impatiently, \"Of course not. Dr. Braun isn't a practicing medical doctor. We are research biochemists.\"  \"We're scientists,\" Ross told him, putting it on what he assumed was the man's level. \"There's something on which you could help us.\"  Crowley took his eyes from the girl and scowled at Ross. \"Me? Scientists? I'm just a country boy, I don't know anything about science.\" There was a grudging self-deprecation in his tone.  Patricia took over, a miracle smile overwhelming her air of briskness. \"We'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you.\"  Dr. Braun added the clincher. \"And it might be remunerative.\"  Crowley opened the door wider. \"Well, just so it don't cost me nothing.\" He stepped back for them. \"Don't mind the place. Kind of mussed up. Fact is, the wife left me about a week ago and I haven't got around to getting somebody to come in and kind of clean things up.\"  He wasn't exaggerating. Patricia O'Gara had no pretensions to the housewife's art herself, but she sniffed when she saw the condition of the living room. There was a dirty shirt drooped over the sofa back and beside the chair which faced the TV set were half a dozen empty beer cans. The ashtrays hadn't been emptied for at least days and the floor had obviously not been swept since the domestic tragedy which had sent Mrs. Crowley packing.  Now that the three strangers were within his castle, Crowley's instincts for hospitality asserted themselves. He said, \"Make yourself comfortable. Here, wait'll I get these things out of the way. Anybody like a drink? I got some beer in the box, or,\" he smirked at Patricia, \"I got some port wine you might like, not this bellywash you buy by the gallon.\"  They declined the refreshments, it wasn't quite noon.  Crowley wrestled the chair which had been before the TV set around so that he could sit facing them, and then sat himself down. He didn't get this and his face showed it.  Frederick Braun came to the point. \"Mr. Crowley,\" he said, \"did it ever occur to you that somewhere amidst our nearly one hundred million American males there is the average man?\"  Crowley looked at him.  Braun cleared his throat and with his thumb and forefinger pushed his glasses more firmly on the bridge of his nose. \"I suppose that isn't exactly the technical way in which to put it.\"  Ross Wooley shifted his football shoulders and leaned forward earnestly. \"No, Doctor, that's exactly the way to put it.\" He said to Crowley, very seriously, \"We've done this most efficiently. We've gone through absolute piles of statistics. We've....\"  \"Done what?\" Crowley all but wailed. \"Take it easy, will you? What are you all talking about?\"  Patricia said impatiently, \"Mr. Crowley, you are the average American. The man on the street. The Common Man.\"  He frowned at her. \"What'd'ya mean, common? I'm as good as anybody else.\"  \"That's exactly what we mean,\" Ross said placatingly. \"You are exactly as good as anybody else, Mr. Crowley. You're the average man.\"  \"I don't know what the devil you're talking about. Pardon my language, Miss.\"  \"Not at all,\" Patricia sighed. \"Dr. Braun, why don't you take over? We seem to all be speaking at once.\"         *       *       *  The little doctor began to enumerate on his fingers. \"The center of population has shifted to this vicinity, so the average American lives here in the Middle West. Population is also shifting from rural to urban, so the average man lives in a city of approximately this size. Determining average age, height, weight is simple with government data as complete as they are. Also racial background. You, Mr. Crowley, are predominately English, German and Irish, but have traces of two or three other nationalities.\"  Crowley was staring at him. \"How in the devil did you know that?\"  Ross said wearily, \"We've gone to a lot of trouble.\"  Dr. Braun hustled on. \"You've had the average amount of education, didn't quite finish high school. You make average wages working in a factory as a clerk. You spent some time in the army but never saw combat. You drink moderately, are married and have one child, which is average for your age. Your I.Q. is exactly average and you vote Democrat except occasionally when you switch over to Republican.\"  \"Now wait a minute,\" Crowley protested. \"You mean I'm the only man in this whole country that's like me? I mean, you mean I'm the average guy, right in the middle?\"  Patricia O'Gara said impatiently. \"You are the nearest thing to it, Mr. Crowley. Actually, possibly one of a hundred persons would have served our purpose.\"  \"O.K.,\" Crowley interrupted, holding up a hand. \"That gets us to the point. What's this here purpose? What's the big idea prying, like, into my affairs till you learned all this about me? And what's this stuff about me getting something out of it? Right now I'm between jobs.\"  The doctor pushed his battered horn-rims back on his nose with his forefinger. \"Yes, of course,\" he said reasonably. \"Now we get to the point. Mr. Crowley, how would you like to be invisible?\"  The three of them looked at him. It seemed to be his turn.  Crowley got up and walked into the kitchen. He came back in a moment with an opened can of beer from which he was gulping even as he walked. He took the can away from his mouth and said carefully, \"You mean like a ghost?\"  \"No, of course not,\" Braun said in irritation. \"By Caesar, man, have you no imagination? Can't you see it was only a matter of time before someone, possibly working away on an entirely different subject of research, stumbled upon a practical method of achieving invisibility?\"  \"Now, wait a minute,\" Crowley said, his voice belligerent. \"I'm only a country boy, maybe, without any egghead background, but I'm just as good as the next man and just as smart. I don't think I like your altitude.\"  \"Attitude,\" Ross Wooley muttered unhappily. He shot a glance at Patricia O'Gara but she ignored him.  Patricia turned on the charm. Her face opened into smile and she said soothingly, \"Don't misunderstand, Mr. Crowley. May I call you Don? I'm sure we're going to be associates. You see, Don, we need your assistance.\"  This was more like it. Crowley sat down again and finished the can of beer. \"O.K., it won't hurt to listen. What's the pitch?\"  The older man cleared his throat. \"We'll cover it quickly so that we can get to the immediate practical aspects. Are you interested in biodynamics ... umah ... no, of course not. Let me see. Are you at all familiar with the laws pertaining to refraction of ... umah, no.\" He cleared his throat again, unhappily. \"Have you ever seen a medusa, Mr. Crowley? The gelatinous umbrella-shaped free swimming form of marine invertebrate related to the coral polyp and the sea anemone?\"  Ross Wooley scratched his crew cut and grimaced. \"Jellyfish, Doctor, jellyfish. But I think the Portuguese Man-of-War might be a better example.\"  \"Oh, jellyfish,\" Crowley said. \"Sure, I've"]]]
