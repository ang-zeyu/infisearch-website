Upon this, Sir Thomas Dale was induced to fit out an expedition to dislodge the rest of them from Acadia. Three ships were got ready, the brave Captain Argall was appointed Commander-in-chief, and the first colony was terminated by fire and sword before the end of the year. This was in 1613, ten years after the first planting of Acadia.  \"Some of the settlers,\" says the Chronicle, \"finding resistance to be unavailing, fled to the woods.\" What became of them history does not inform us, but with a graceful appearance of candor, relates that the transaction itself \"was not approved of by the court of England, nor resented by that of France.\" Five years afterward we find Captain Argall appointed Deputy-Governor of Virginia.  This outrage was the initial letter only of a series that for nearly a century and a half after, made the successive colonists of Acadia the prey of their rapacious neighbors. We shall take up the story from time to time, gentle reader, as we voyage around and through the province. Meanwhile let us open our eyes again upon the present, for just below us lies the village and harbor of Chezzetcook.  A conspiracy of earth and air and ocean had certainly broken out that morning, for the ominous lines of Fog and Mist were hovering afar off upon the boundaries of the horizon. Under the crystalline azure of a summer sky, the water of the harbor had an intensity of color rarely seen, except in the pictures of the most ultra-marine painters. Here and there a green island or a fishing-boat rested upon the surface of the tranquil blue. For miles and miles the eye followed indented grassy slopes, that rolled away on either side of the harbor, and the most delicate pencil could scarcely portray the exquisite line of creamy sand that skirted their edges and melted off in the clear margin of the water. Occasional little cottages nestle among these green banks, not the Acadian houses of the poem, \"with thatched roofs, and dormer windows projecting,\" but comfortable, homely-looking buildings of modern shapes, shingled and un-weather-cocked. No cattle visible, no ploughs nor horses. Some of the men are at work in the open air; all in tarpaulin hats, all in tarry canvas trowsers. These are boat-builders and coopers. Simple, honest, and good-tempered enough; you see how courteously they salute us as we ride by them. In front of every house there is a knot of curious little faces; Young Acadia is out this bright day, and although Young Acadia has not a clean face on, yet its hair is of the darkest and softest, and its eyes are lustrous and most delicately fringed. Yonder is one of the veterans of the place, so we will tie Pony to the fence, and rest here.  \"Fine day you have here,\" said my companion.  \"Oh yes! oh yes!\" (with great deference and politeness).  \"Can you give us anything in the way of refreshment? a glass of ale, or a glass of milk?\"  \"Oh no!\" (with the unmistakable shrug of the shoulders); \"we no have milk, no have ale, no have brandy, no have noting here: ah! we very poor peep' here.\" (Poor people here.)  \"Can we sit down and rest in one of your houses?\"  \"Oh yes! oh yes!\" (with great politeness and alacrity); \"walk in, walk in; we very poor peep', no milk, no brandy: walk in.\"  The little house is divided by a partition. The larger half is the hall, the parlor, kitchen, and nursery in one. A huge fire-place, an antique spinning-wheel, a bench, and two settles, or high-backed seats, a table, a cradle and a baby very wide awake, complete the inventory. In the apartment adjoining is a bin that represents, no doubt, a French bedstead of the early ages. Everything is suggestive of boat-builders, of Robinson Crusoe work, of undisciplined hands, that have had to do with ineffectual tools. As you look at the walls, you see the house is built of timbers, squared and notched together, and caulked with moss or oakum.  \"Very poor peep' here,\" says the old man, with every finger on his hands stretched out to deprecate the fact. By the fire-side sits an old woman, in a face all cracked and seamed with wrinkles, like a picture by one of the old masters. \"Yes,\" she echoes, \"very poor peep' here, and very cold, too, sometime.\" By this time the door-way is entirely packed with little, black, shining heads, and curious faces, all shy, timid, and yet not the less good-natured. Just back of the cradle are two of the Acadian women, \"knitters i' the sun,\" with features that might serve for Palmer's sculptures; and eyes so lustrous, and teeth so white, and cheeks so rich with brown and blush, that if one were a painter and not an invalid, he might pray for canvas and pallet as the very things most wanted in the critical moment of his life. Faed's picture does not convey the Acadian face. The mouth and chin are more delicate in the real than in the ideal Evangeline. If you look again, after the first surprise is over, you will see that these are the traditional pictures, such as we might have fancied they should be, after reading the idyl. From the forehead of each you see at a glance how the dark mass of hair has been combed forward and over the face, that the little triangular Norman cap might be tied across the crown of the head. Then the hair is thrown back again over this, so as to form a large bow in front, then re-tied at the crown with colored ribbons. Then you see it has been plaited in a shining mesh, brought forward again, and braided with ribbons, so that it forms, as it were, a pretty coronet, well-placed above those brilliant eyes and harmonious features. This, with the antique kirtle and picturesque petticoat, is an Acadian portrait. Such is it now, and such it was, no doubt, when De Monts sailed from Havre de Grace, two centuries and a half ago. In visiting this kind and simple people, one can scarcely forget the little chapel. The young French priest was in his garden, behind the little tenement, set apart for him by the piety of his flock, and readily admitted us. A small place indeed was it, but clean and orderly, the altar decorated with toy images, that were not too large for a Christmas table. Yet I have been in the grandest tabernacles of episcopacy with lesser feelings of respect than those which were awakened in that tiny Acadian chapel. Peace be with it, and with its gentle flock.  \"Pony is getting impatient,\" said my companion, as we reverently stepped from the door-way, \"and it is a long ride to Halifax.\" So, with courteous salutation on both sides, we take leave of the good father, and once more are on the road to Deer's Castle.     CHAPTER III.  A Romp at Three Fathom Harbor--The Moral Condition of the Acadians--The Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia--Mrs. Deer's Wit--No Fish--Picton--The Balaklava Schooner--And a Voyage to Louisburgh.   Pony is very enterprising. We are soon at the top of the first long hill, and look again, for the last time, upon the Acadian village. How cosily and quietly it is nestled down amid those graceful green slopes! What a bit of poetry it is in itself! Jog on, Pony!  The corporate authority of Three Fathom Harbor has been improving his time during our absence. As we drive up we find him in high romp with a brace of buxom, red-cheeked, Nova Scotia girls, who have just alighted from a wagon. The landlady of Three Fathom Harbor, in her matronly cap, is smiling over the little garden gate at her lord, who is pursuing his Daphnes, and catching, and kissing, and hugging, first one and then the other, to his heart's content. Notwithstanding their screams, and slaps, and robust struggles, it is very plain to be seen that the skipper's attentions are not very unwelcome. Leaving his fair friends, he catches Pony by the bridle and stops us with a hospitable--\"Come in--you must come in; just a glass of ale, you'll want it;\" and sure enough, we found when we came to taste the ale, that we did want it, and many thanks to him, the kind-hearted landlord of the Three Fathoms.  \"It is surprising,\" said I to my companion, as we rolled again over the road, \"that these people, these Acadians, should still preserve their language and customs, so near to your principal city, and yet with no more affiliation than if they were on an island in the South Seas!\"  \"The reason of that,\" he replied, \"is because they stick to their own settlement; never see anything of the world except Halifax early in the morning; never marry out of their own set; never read--I do not believe one of them can read or write--and are in fact _so slow_, so destitute of enterprise, so much behind the age\"----  I could not avoid smiling. My companion observed it. \"What are you thinking about?\" said he.  The truth is, I was thinking of Halifax, which was anything but a _fast_ place; but I simply observed:  \"Your settlements here are somewhat novel to a stranger. That a mere handful of men should be so near your city, and yet so isolated: that this village of a few hundred only, should retain its customs and language, intact, for generation after generation, within walking distance of Halifax, seems to me unaccountable. But let me ask you,\" I continued, \"what is the moral condition of the Acadians?\"  \"As for that,\" said he, \"I believe it stands pretty fair. I do not think an Acadian would cheat, lie, or steal; I know that the women are virtuous, and if I had a thousand pounds in my pocket I could sleep with confidence in any of their houses, although all the doors were unlocked and everybody in the village knew it.\"  \"That,\" said I, \"reminds one of the poem:      'Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows,     But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners;     There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.'\"  Poor exiles! You will never see the Gasperau and the shore of the Basin of Minas, but if this very feeble life I have holds out, I hope to visit Grandpré and the broad meadows that gave a name to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23409"],["title","Acadia (#7)"],["body","ge.  One thing Longfellow has certainly omitted in \"Evangeline\"--the wild flowers of Acadia. The roadside is all fringed and tasselled with white, pink, and purple. The wild strawberries are in blossom, whitening the turf all the way from Halifax to Chezzetcook. You see their starry settlements thick in every bit of turf. These are the silver mines of poor Cuffee; he has the monopoly of the berry trade. It is his only revenue. Then in the swampy grounds there are long green needles in solitary groups, surmounted with snowy tufts; and here and there, clusters of light purple blossoms, called laurel flowers, but not like our laurels, spring up from the bases of grey rocks and boulders; sometimes a rich array of blood-red berries gleams out of a mass of greenery; then again great floral white radii, tipped with snowy petals, rise up profuse and lofty; down by the ditches hundreds of pitcher plants lift their veined and mottled vases, brimming with water, to the wood-birds who drink and perch upon their thick rims; May-flowers of delightful fragrance hide beneath those shining, tropical-looking leaves, and meadow-sweet, not less fragrant, but less beautiful, pours its tender aroma into the fresh air; here again we see the buckthorn in blossom; there, scattered on the turf, the scarlet partridge berry; then wild-cherry trees, mere shrubs only, in full bud; and around all and above all, the evergreens, the murmuring pines, and the hemlocks; the rampikes--the grey-beards of the primeval forest; the spicy breath of resinous balsams; the spiry tops, and the serene heaven. Is this fairy land? No, it is only poor, old, barren Nova Scotia, and yet I think Felix, Prince of Salerno, if he were here, might say, and say truly too, \"In all my life I never beheld a more enchanting place;\" but Felix, Prince of Salerno, must remember this is the month of June, and summer is not perpetual in the latitude of forty-five.  We reach at last Deer's Castle. Pony, under the hands of Bill, seems remarkably cheerful and fresh after his long travel up hill and down. When he pops out of his harness, with his knock-knees and sturdy, stocky little frame, he looks very like an animated saw-buck, clothed in seal-skin; and with a jump, and snort, and flourish of tail, he escorts Bill to the stable, as if twenty miles over a rough road was a trifle not worth consideration.  A savory odor of frying bacon and eggs stole forth from the door as we sat, in the calm summer air, upon the stone fence. William Deer, Jr., was wandering about in front of the castle, endeavoring to get control of his under lip and keep his exuberant mirth within the limits of decorum; but every instant, to use a military figure, it would flash in the pan. Up on the bare rocks were the wretched, woe-begone, patched, and ragged log huts of poor Cuffee. The hour and the season were suggestive of philosophizing, of theories, and questions.  \"Mrs. Deer,\" said I, \"is that your husband's portrait on the back of the sign?\" (there was a picture of a stag with antlers on the reverse of the poetical swing-board, either intended as a pictographic pun upon the name of \"Deer,\" or as a hint to sportsmen of good game hereabouts).  \"Why,\" replied Mrs. Deer, an old tidy wench, of fifty, pretty well bent by rheumatism, and so square in the lower half of her figure, and so spare in the upper, that she appeared to have been carved out of her own hips: \"why, as to dat, he ain't good-looking to brag on, but I don't think he looks quite like a beast neither.\"  At this unexpected retort, Bill flashed off so many pans at once that he seemed to be a platoon of militia. My companion also enjoyed it immensely. Being an invalid, I could not participate in the general mirth.  \"Mrs. Deer,\" said I, \"how long have you lived here?\"  \"Oh, sah! a good many years; I cum here afore I had Bill dar.\" (Here William flashed in the pan twice.)  \"Where did you reside before you came to Nova Scotia?\"  \"Sah?\"  \"Where did you live?\"  \"Oh, sah! I is from Maryland.\" (William at it again.)  \"Did you run away?\"  \"Yes, sah; I left when I was young. Bill, what you laughing at? _I_ was young once.\"  \"Were you married then--when you run away?\"  \"Oh yes, sah!\" (a glance at Bill, who was off again).  \"And left your husband behind in Maryland?\"  \"Yes, sah; but he didn't stay long dar after I left. He was after me putty sharp, soon as I travelled;\" (here Mrs. Deer and William interchanged glances, and indulged freely in mirth).  \"And which place do you like the best--this or Maryland?\"  \"Why, I never had no such work to do at home as I have to do here, grubbin' up old stumps and stones; dem isn't women's work. When I was home, I had only to wait on misses, and work was light and easy.\" (William quiet.)  \"But which place do you like the best--Nova Scotia or Maryland?\"  \"Oh! de work here is awful, grubbin' up old stones and stumps; 'tain't fit for women.\" (William much impressed with the cogency of this repetition.)  \"But which place do you like the best?\"  \"And de winter here, oh! it's wonderful tryin.\" (William utters an affirmative flash.)  \"But which place do you like the best?\"  \"And den dere's de rheumatiz.\"  \"But which place do you like the best, Mrs. Deer?\"  \"Well,\" said Mrs. Deer, glancing at Bill, \"I like Nova Scotia best.\" (Whatever visions of Maryland were gleaming in William's mind, seemed to be entirely quenched by this remark.)  \"But why,\" said I, \"do you prefer Nova Scotia to Maryland? Here you have to work so much harder, to suffer so much from the cold and the rheumatism, and get so little for it;\" for I could not help looking over the green patch of stony grass that has been rescued by the labor of a quarter century.  \"Oh!\" replied Mrs. Deer, \"de difference is, dat when I work here, I work for myself, and when I was working at home, I was working for other people.\" (At this, William broke forth again in such a series of platoon flashes, that we all joined in with infinite merriment.)  \"Mrs. Deer,\" said I, recovering my gravity, \"I want to ask you one more question.\"  \"Well, sah,\" said the lady Deer, cocking her head on one side, expressive of being able to answer any number of questions in a twinkling.  \"You have, no doubt, still many relatives left in Maryland?\"  \"Oh! yes,\" replied Mrs. Deer, \"_all_ of dem are dar.\"  \"And suppose you had a chance to advise them in regard to this matter, would you tell them to run away, and take their part with you in Nova Scotia, or would you advise them to stay where they are?\"  Mrs. Deer, at this, looked a long time at William, and William looked earnestly at his parent. Then she cocked her head on the other side, to take a new view of the question. Then she gathered up mouth and eyebrows, in a puzzle, and again broadened out upon Bill in an odd kind of smile; at last she doubled up one fist, put it against her cheek, glanced at Bill, and out came the answer: \"Well, sah, I'd let 'em take dere _own_ heads for dat!\" I must confess the philosophy of this remark awakened in me a train of very grave reflections; but my companion burst into a most obstreperous laugh. As for Mrs. Deer, she shook her old hips as long as she could stand, and then sat down and continued, until she wiped the tears out of her eyes with the corner of her apron. William cast himself down upon a strawberry bank, and gave way to the most flagrant mirth, kicking up his old shoes in the air, and fairly wallowing in laughter and blossoms. I endeavored to change the subject. \"Bill, did you catch any trout?\" It was some time before William could control himself enough to say, \"Not a single one, sah;\" and then he rolled over on his back, put his black paws up to his eyes, and twitched and jingled to his heart's content. I did not ask Mrs. Deer any more questions; but there is a moral in the story, enough for a day.  As we rattled over the road, after our brief dinner at Deer's Castle, I could not avoid a pervading feeling of gloom and disappointment, in spite of the balmy air and pretty landscape. The old ragged abodes of wretchedness seemed to be too clearly defined--to stand out too intrusively against the bright blue sky. But why should I feel so much for Cuffee? Has he not enlisted in his behalf every philanthropist in England? Is he not within ten miles of either the British flag or Acadia? Does not the Duchess of Sutherland entertain the authoress of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and the Black Swan? Why should I sorrow for Cuffee, when he is in the midst of his best friends? Why should I pretend to say that this appears to be the raggedest, the meanest, the worst condition of humanity, when the papers are constantly lauding British philanthropy, and holding it up as a great example, which we must \"bow down and worship?\" For my own part, although the pleasant fiction of seeing Cuffee clothed, educated, and Christianized, seemed to be somewhat obscured in this glimpse of his real condition, yet I hope he will do well under his new owners; at the very least, I trust his berry crop will be good, and that a benevolent British blanket or two may enable him to shiver out the winter safely, if not comfortably. Poor William Deer, Sen'r, of Deer's Castle, was suffering with rheumatism in the next apartment, while we were at his eggs and bacon in the banquet hall; but Deer of Deer's Castle is a prince to his neighbors. I shall not easily forget the brightening eye, the swift glance of intelligence in the face of another old negro, an hostler, in Nova Scotia. He was from Virginia, and adopting the sweet, mellifluous language of his own home, I asked him whether he liked best to stay where he was, or go back to \"Old Virginny?\" \"O massa!\" said he, with _such_ a look, \"you _must know_ dat I has de warmest side for my own country!\"  We rattled soberly into Dartmouth, and took the ferry-boat across the bay to the city. At the hotel there was no little questioning about Chezzetcook, for some of the Halifax merchants are at the Waverley. \"GOE"]]]
