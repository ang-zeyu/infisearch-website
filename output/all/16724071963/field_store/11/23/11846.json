Of course Nelson was blamed in England for his want of success in this expedition, and Earl St. Vincent was severely censured for having sent so young an officer on a service so important.  Anticipating the objection, that he ought not to have made so long a voyage without more certain information, Nelson said, in vindication of his conduct:--  \"Who was I to get such information from?  The Governments of Naples and Sicily either knew not, or chose to keep me in ignorance.  Was I to wait patiently until I heard certain accounts?  If Egypt were their object, before I could hear of them, they would have been in India.  To do nothing was disgraceful; therefore I made use of my understanding.  I am before your lordships' judgment; and if, under all circumstances, it is decided that I am wrong, I ought, for the sake of our country, to be superseded; for at this moment, when I know the French are not in Alexandria, I hold the same opinion as off Cape Passaro--that, under all circumstances, I was right in steering for Alexandria; and by that opinion I must stand or fall.\"  It was ere long proved that Nelson _was_ right, and that Earl St. Vincent had made no mistake in sending him on a service so important; for we now know that in all the British fleet there was not another man so admirably adapted for the duty which was assigned to him, of finding, fighting, and conquering, the French, in reference to whom he wrote to the first lord of the Admiralty, \"Be they bound to the antipodes, your lordship may rely that I will not lose a moment in bringing them to action!\"  Re-victualled and watered, the British fleet set sail on the 25th of July from Syracuse.  On the 28th, intelligence was received that the enemy had been seen about four weeks before, steering to the South East from Candia.  With characteristic disregard of the possible consequences to his own fame and interest, in his determination to \"do the right,\" Nelson at once resolved to return to Alexandria.  Accordingly, with all sail set, the fleet stood once more towards the coast of Egypt.  Perseverance was at length rewarded.  On the 1st of August 1798, about ten in the morning, they sighted Alexandria, and saw with inexpressible delight that the port was crowded with the ships of France.  And here we venture to say that we sympathise with the joy of the British on this occasion, and shall explain why we do so.  Not every battle that is fought--however brilliant in military or naval tactics it may be, or in exhibitions of personal prowess--deserves our sympathy.  Only that war which is waged against oppression is entitled to respect, and this, we hold, applies to the war in which the British were engaged at that time.  France, under the Directory, had commenced a career of unwarrantable conquest, for the simple purpose of self-aggrandisement, and her great general, Bonaparte, had begun that course of successful warfare in which he displayed those brilliant talents which won for him an empire, constituted him, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, a hero, and advanced France to a high position of tyrannical power.  But brilliant talents and success could not free him from the charge of being a wholesale murderer.  To oppose such pretentions and practices was a bounden duty on the part of those who loved justice, just as much as it is the duty of every one who has the power to thwart the designs of, and forcibly overcome, a highwayman or a pirate.  Observe, reader, that we do not intend here to imply an invidious comparison.  We have no sympathy with those who hold that England was and always is in favour of fair play, while France was bent on tyranny. On the contrary, we believe that England has in some instances been guilty of the sin which we now condemn, and that, on the other hand, many Frenchmen of the present day would disapprove of the policy of France in the time of Napoleon the First.  Neither do we sympathise with the famous saying of Nelson that \"one Englishman is equal to three Frenchmen!\"  The tendency to praise one's-self has always been regarded among Christian nations as a despicable, or at least a pitiable, quality, and we confess that we cannot see much difference between a boastful man and a boastful nation.  Frenchmen have always displayed chivalrous courage, not a whit inferior to the British, and history proves that in war they have been eminently successful.  The question whether they could beat us or we could beat them, if tested in a fair stand-up fight with equal numbers, besides being an unprofitable one, is not now before us.  All that we are concerned about at present is, that in the war now under consideration the British _did_ beat the French, and we rejoice to record the fact solely on the ground that we fought in a righteous cause.  With these remarks we proceed to give an account of one of the greatest naval victories ever achieved by British arms.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE BATTLE OF THE NILE.  After Napoleon Bonaparte had effected his landing in Egypt, the French fleet was permitted to remain at Alexandria for some time, and thus afforded Nelson the opportunity he had sought for so long.  For many previous days he had been almost unable, from anxiety, to take sleep or food, but now he ordered dinner to be served, while preparations were being made for battle, and when his officers rose to leave the table, he said to them:--  \"Before this time to-morrow, I shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey.\"  The French had found it impossible to enter the neglected and ruined port of Alexandria.  Admiral Brueys had, by command of Napoleon, offered a reward of 10,000 livres to any native pilot who would safely convey the squadron in, but not one was found who would venture to take charge of a single vessel that drew more than twenty feet.  The gallant admiral was compelled, therefore, to anchor in Aboukir Bay, and chose the strongest position that was possible in the circumstances.  He ranged his ships in a compact line of battle, in such a manner that the leading vessel lay close to a shoal, while the remainder of the fleet formed a curve along the line of deep water so that it was thought to be impossible to turn it by any means in a South Westerly direction, and some of the French, who were best able to judge, said that they held a position so strong that they could bid defiance to a force more than double their own.  The presumption was not unreasonable, for the French had the advantage of the English in ships, guns, and men, but they had omitted to take into their calculations the fact that the English fleet was commanded by one whose promptitude in action, readiness and eccentricity of resource, and utter disregard of consequences when what he deemed the path to victory lay before him, might have been equalled; but certainly could not have been surpassed, by Bonaparte himself.  The French force consisted of thirteen ships of the line and four frigates, carrying in all 1196 guns and 11,230 men.  The English had thirteen ships of the line and a fifty-gun ship, carrying in all 1012 guns and 8068 men.  All the English line-of-battle ships were seventy-fours.  Three of the French ships carried eighty-eight guns, and one, _L'Orient_, was a monster three-decker with 120 guns.  In order to give the reader a better idea of the forces engaged on both sides, we give the following list of ships.  It is right, however, to add that one of those belonging to the English (the _Culloden_) ran aground on a shoal when about to go into action, and took no part in the fight.

When Nelson perceived the position of the enemy, his fertile and active mind at once evolved a characteristic course of action.  Where there was room, he said, for an enemy's ship to swing, there was room for one of his to anchor.  He therefore at once formed the plan of doubling on the French ships, stationing one of his ships on the bow and another on the quarter of each of the enemy.  Nelson immediately explained his intended course to his officers.  It had been his custom during the whole time he was engaged in searching for the French fleet, to have his captains as frequently as possible on board the _Vanguard_, when he explained to them his opinions as to the best mode of attack in all the various positions in which it was possible or probable that the enemy might be found.  Hence they knew their commander's tactics so well, that when the hour for action arrived, no time was lost in the tedious operation of signalling orders. He had such confidence in all his officers, that after thoroughly explaining his intended plan of attack, he merely said to them, \"Form as is most convenient for mutual support, and anchor by the stern.  First gain the victory, and then make the best use of it you can.\"  When Captain Berry, perceiving the boldness of the plan, said, \"If we succeed, what will the world say?\"  Nelson replied, \"There is no _if_ in the case; that we shall succeed is certain: who may live to tell the story is a very different question!\"  Nelson possessed in an eminent degree the power of infusing into his men the irresistible confidence that animated his own bosom.  There was probably not a man in the British fleet who did not sail into Aboukir Bay on that memorable day with a feeling of certainty that the battle was as good as gained before it was begun.  The cool, quiet, self-possessed manner in which the British tars went to work at the beginning must have been very impressive to the enemy; for, as they advanced, they did not even condescend to fire a shot in reply to the storm of shot and shell to which the leading ships were treated by the batteries on an island in the bay, and by the broadsides of the whole French fleet at half gunshot-range, the men being too busily engaged in furling the sails aloft, attending to the braces below, and preparing to cast anchor!  Nelson's fleet did not all enter the bay at once, but each vessel lost no time in taking up position as it arrived; and as, one after another, they bore down on the enemy, anchored close alongside, and opened fire, the thunder of the French fleet was quickly and increasingly augmented by the British, until the full tide of battle was reached, and the shores of Egypt trembled under the incessant rolling roar of dreadful war; while sheets of flame shot forth and rent the thick clouds which enwrapped the contending fleets, and hung incumbent over the bay.  An attempt was made by a French brig to decoy the English ships towards a shoal before they entered Aboukir Bay, but it failed because Nelson either knew the danger or saw through the device.  It seemed as if the _Zealous_ (Captain Hood) was to have the honour of commencing the action, but Captain Foley passed her in the _Goliath_, and successfully accomplished that feat which the French had deemed impossible, and had done their best to guard against.  Instead of attacking the leading ship--the _Guerrier_--outside, he sailed round her bows, passed between her and the shore, and cast anchor.  Before he could bring up, however, he had drifted down to the second ship of the enemy's line--the _Conquerant_--and opened fire.  It had been rightly conjectured that the landward guns of the enemy would not be manned, or even ready for action.  The _Goliath_, therefore, made short and sharp work of her foe.  In ten minutes the masts of the _Conquerant_ were shot away!  The _Zealous_ was laid alongside the _Guerrier_, and in twelve minutes that vessel was totally disabled.  Next came the _Orion_ (Sir J. Saumarez), which went into action in splendid style.  Perceiving that a frigate lying farther inshore was annoying the _Goliath_, she sailed towards her, giving the _Guerrier_ a taste of her larboard guns as long as they would bear upon her, then dismasted and sunk the frigate, hauled round towards the French line, and anchoring between the _Franklin_ and the _Souverain Peuple_, received and returned the fire of both.  In like manner the _Audacious_ (Captain Gould) justified her name by attacking the _Guerrier_ and _Conquerant_ at once, and, when the latter struck passed on to the _Souverain Peuple_.  The unfortunate _Guerrier_ was also worthy of her title, for she bore the brunt of the battle.  Every ship that passed her appeared to deem it a duty to give her a broadside before settling down to its particular place in the line, and finding its own special antagonist or antagonists--for several of the English ships engaged two of the enemy at once.  The _Theseus_ (Captain Miller), after bringing down the main and mizzen-masts of the _Guerrier_, anchored inside the _Spartiate_ and engaged her.  Meanwhile, on the other side of this vessel, Nelson's ship, the _Vanguard_, bore down on the foe with six flags flying in different parts of the rigging, to guard against the possibility of his colours being shot away!  She opened a tremendous fire on the _Spartiate_ at half pistol-range.  The muscular British tars wrought with heroic energy at the guns.  In a few minutes six of these guns, which stood on the fore-part of the _Vanguard's_ deck, were left without a man, and three times afterwards were these six guns cleared of men--so terrific was the fire of the enemy.  Other four of the British vessels sailed ahead of the _Vanguard_ and got into action.  One of these--the _Bellerophon_ (Captain Darby)--engaged the gigantic _L'Orient_, which was so disproportionately large that the weight of ball from her lower deck alone exceeded that from the whole broadside of her assailant.  The result was that the _Bellerophon_ was overpowered, 200 of her men were killed or wounded, all her masts and cables were shot away, and she drifted out of the line.  Her place, however, was taken by the _Swiftsure_, which not only assailed the _L'Orient_ on the bow, but at the same time opened a steady fire on the quarter of the _Franklin_.  Before this time, however, the shades of night had fallen on the scene. The battle began at half-past six in the evening--half-an-hour afterwards daylight was gone, and the deadly fight was lighted only by the lurid and fitful flashing of the guns.  Those vessels of the English squadron which happened to be in rear were some leagues astern when the fight began, and it was so dark when they entered that extreme difficulty was experienced in getting in.  One of these--the _Culloden_ (Captain Trowbridge)--sounded carefully as she went, but got aground, where she remained helpless during the action, despite the efforts of the _Leander_ and _La Mutine_ brig to get her off.  She served, however,"]]]
