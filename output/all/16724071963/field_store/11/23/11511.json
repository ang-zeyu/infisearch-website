He lit a long black cigar.  \"Well?\" His heavy voice boomed out in the small room. \"Now that we've got him here, what do you think?\"  The younger man glanced uncomfortably through the glass wall panel into the small dark room beyond. In the dimness, he could barely make out the still form on the bed, grotesque with the electrode-vernier apparatus already in place at its temples. Dr. Manelli looked away sharply, and leafed through the thick sheaf of chart papers in his hand.  \"I don't know,\" he said dully. \"I just don't know what to think.\"  The other man's laugh seemed to rise from the depths of his huge chest. His heavy face creased into a thousand wrinkles. Dr. Webber was a large man, his broad shoulders carrying a suggestion of immense power that matched the intensity of his dark, wide-set eyes. He watched Dr. Manelli's discomfort grow, saw the younger doctor's ears grow red, and the almost cruel lines in his face were masked as he laughed still louder.  \"Trouble with you, Frank, you just don't have the courage of your convictions.\"  \"Well, I don't see anything so funny about it!\" Manelli's eyes were angry. \"The man has a suspicious syndrome--so you've followed him, and spied on him for weeks on end, which isn't exactly highest ethical practice in collecting a history. I still can't see how you're justified.\"  Dr. Webber snorted, tossing his cigar down on the desk with disgust. \"The man is insane. That's my justification. He's out of touch with reality. He's wandered into a wild, impossible, fantastic dream world. And we've got to get him out of it, because what he knows, what he's trying to hide from us, is so incredibly dangerous that we don't dare let him go.\"  The big man stared at Manelli, his dark eyes flashing. \"Can't you see that? Or would you rather sit back and let Harry Scott go the way that Paulus and Wineberg and the others went?\"  \"But to use the Parkinson Field on him--\" Dr. Manelli shook his head hopelessly. \"He'd offered to come over, George. We didn't need to use it.\"  \"Sure, he offered to come--fine, fine. But supposing he changed his mind on the way? For all we know, he had us figured into his paranoia, too, and never would have come near the Hoffman Center.\"  Dr. Webber shook his head. \"We're not playing a game any more, Frank. Get that straight. I thought it was a game a couple of years ago, when we first started. But it ceased to be a game when men like Paulus and Wineberg walked in sane, healthy men, and came out blubbering idiots. That's no game any more. We're onto something big. And, if Harry Scott can lead us to the core of it, then I can't care too much what happens to Harry Scott.\"  Dr. Manelli stood up sharply, walked to the window, and looked down over the bright, clean buildings of the Hoffman Medical Center. Out across the terraced park that surrounded the glassed towers and shining metal of the Center rose the New City, tier upon tier of smooth, functional architecture, a city of dreams built up painfully out of the rubble of the older, ruined city.  \"You could kill him,\" the young man said finally. \"The psycho-integrator isn't any standard interrogative technique; it's dangerous and treacherous. You never know for sure just what you're doing when you dig down into a man's brain tissue with those little electrode probes.\"  \"But we can learn the truth about Harry Scott,\" Dr. Webber broke in. \"Six months ago, Harry Scott was working with us, a quiet, affable, pleasant young fellow, extremely intelligent, intensely co-operative. He was just the man we needed to work with us, an engineer who could take our data and case histories, study them, and subject them to a completely nonmedical analysis. Oh, we had to have it done--the problem's been with us for a hundred years now, growing ever since the 1950s and 60s--insanity in the population, growing, spreading without rhyme or reason, insinuating itself into every nook and cranny of our civilized life.\"  The big man blinked at Manelli. \"Harry Scott was the new approach. We were too close to the problem. We needed a nonmedical outsider to take a look, to tell us what we were missing. So Harry Scott walked into the problem, and then abruptly lost contact with us. We finally track him down and find him gone, out of touch with reality, on the same wretched road that all the others went. With Harry, it's paranoia. He's being persecuted; he has the whole world against him, but most important--the factor we don't dare overlook--_he's no longer working on the problem_.\"  Manelli shifted uneasily. \"I suppose that's right.\"  \"Of course it's right!\" Dr. Webber's eyes flashed. \"Harry found something in those statistics. Something about the data, or the case histories; or something Harry Scott himself dug up opened a door for him to go through, a door that none of us ever dreamed existed. We don't know what he found on the other side of that door. Oh, we know what he _thinks_ he found, all this garbage about people that look normal but walk through walls when nobody's looking, who think around corners instead of in straight-line logic. But what he _really_ found there, we don't have any way of telling. We just know that whatever he _really_ found is something new, something unsuspected; something so dangerous it can drive an intelligent man into the wildest delusions of paranoid persecution.\"  A new light appeared in Dr. Manelli's eyes as he faced the other doctor. \"Wait a minute,\" he said softly. \"The integrator is an _experimental_ instrument, too.\"  Dr. Webber smiled slyly. \"Now you're beginning to think,\" he said.  \"But you'll see only what Scott himself believes. And _he_ thinks his story is true.\"  \"Then we'll have to break his story.\"  \"_Break_ it?\"  \"Certainly. For some reason, this delusion of persecution is far safer for Harry Scott than facing what he really found out. What we've got to do is to make this delusion _less_ safe than the truth.\"  The room was silent for a long moment. Manelli looked up, his fingers trembling. \"Let's hear it.\"  \"It's very simple. Up to now, Harry Scott has had _delusions_ of persecution. But now we're _really_ going to persecute Harry Scott, as he's never been persecuted before.\"     3   At first he thought he was at the bottom of a deep well and he lay quite still, his eyes clamped shut, wondering where he was and how he could possibly have gotten there. He could feel the dampness and chill of the stone floor under him, and nearby he heard the damp, insistent drip of water splashing against stone. He felt his muscles tighten as the dripping sound forced itself against his senses. Then he opened his eyes.  His first impulse was to scream out wildly in unreasoning, suffocating fear. He fought it down, struggling to sit up in the blackness, his whole mind turned in bitter, hopeless hatred at the ones who had hunted him for so long, and now had trapped him.  Why?  Why did they torture him? Why not kill him outright, have done with it? He shuddered, and struggled to his feet, staring about him in horror.  It was not a well, but a small room, circular, with little rivulets of stale water running down the granite walls. The ceiling closed low over his head, and the only source of light came from the single doorway opening into a long, low stone passageway.  Wave after wave of panic rose in Harry's throat. Each time he fought down the urge to scream, to lie down on the ground and cover his face with his hands and scream in helpless fear. How could they have known the horror that lay in his own mind, the horror of darkness, of damp slimy walls and scurrying rodents, of the clinging, stale humidity of dungeon passageways? He himself had seldom recalled it, except in his most hideous dreams, yet he had known such fear as a boy, so many years ago, and now it was all around him. They had known somehow and _used it against him_.  Why?  He sank down on the floor, his head in his hands, trying to think straight, to find some clue in the turmoil bubbling through his mind that would tell him what had happened.  He had started down the hallway from his room, to find Dr. Webber and tell him about the other people--  He stopped short, looked up wide-eyed. _Had_ he been going to Dr. Webber? Had he actually decided to go? Perhaps--yes, perhaps he had, though Webber would only laugh at such a ridiculous story. But the not-men who had hunted him would not laugh; to them, it would not be funny. They knew that it was true. And they knew he knew it was true.  _But why not kill him?_ Why this torture? Why this horrible persecution that dug into the depths of his own nightmares to haunt him?  His breath came fast and a chilly sweat broke out on his forehead. _Where_ was he? Was this some long forgotten vault in the depths of the Old City? Or was this another place, another world, perhaps, that the not-men, with their impossible powers, had created to torture him?  His eyes sought the end of the hall, saw the turn at the end, saw the light which seemed to come from the end; and then in an instant he was running down the damp passageway, his pulse pounding at his temples, until he could hardly gasp enough breath as he ran. Finally he reached the turn in the corridor where the light was brighter, and he swung around to stare at the source of the light, a huge, burning, smoky torch which hung from the wall.  Even as he looked at it, the torch went out, shutting him into inky blackness. The only sound at first was the desperation of his own breath; then he heard little scurrying sounds around his feet, and screamed involuntarily as something sleek and four-footed jumped at his chest with snapping jaws.  Shuddering, he fought the thing off, his fingers closing on wiry fur as he caught and squeezed. The thing went limp, and suddenly melted in his hands. He heard it splash as it struck the damp ground at his feet.  _What were they doing to his mind?_  He screamed out in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22869"],["title","The Dark Door (#2)"],["body",", and followed the echoes of his own scream as he ran down the stone corridor, blindly, slipping on the wet stone floor, falling on his knees into inches of brackish water, scraping back to his feet with an uncontrollable convulsion of fear and loathing, only to run more--  The corridor suddenly broke into two and he stopped short. He didn't know how far, or how long, he had run, but it suddenly occurred to him that he was still alive, still safe. Only his mind was under attack, only his mind was afraid, teetering on the edge of control. And this maze of dungeon tunnels--where could such a thing exist, so perfectly outfitted to horrify him, so neatly fitting into his own pattern of childhood fears and terrors; from where could such a _very individual_ attack on his sanity have sprung? From nowhere except....  _Except from his own mind!_  For an instant, he saw a flicker of light, thought he grasped the edge of a concept previously obscure to him. He stared around him, at the mist swirling down the damp, dark corridor, and thought of the rat that had melted in his hand. Suddenly, his mind was afire, searching through his experience with the strange not-men he had learned to detect, trying to remember everything he had learned and deduced about them before they began their brutal persecution.  They were men, and they looked like men, but they were different. They had other properties of mind, other capabilities that men did not have.  They were not-men. They could exist, and co-exist, two people in one frame, one person known, realized by all who saw, the other one concealed except from those who learned how to look. They could use their minds; they could rationalize correctly; they could use their curious four-dimensional knowledge to bring them to answers no three-dimensional man could reach.  _But they couldn't project into men's minds!_  Carefully, Harry peered down the misty tunnels. They were clever, these creatures, and powerful. Since they had discovered that he knew them, they had done their work of fear and terror on his mind skillfully. But they were limited, too; they couldn't make things happen that were not true--fantasies, illusions....  Yes, this dungeon was an illusion. It _had_ to be.  He cursed and started down the right-hand corridor, his heart sinking. There was no such place and he knew it. He was walking in a dream, a fantasy that had no substance, that could do no more than frighten him, drive him insane; yet he must already have lost his mind to be accepting such an illusion.  Why had he delayed? Why hadn't he gone to the Hoffman Center, laid the whole story before Dr. Webber and Dr. Manelli at the very first, told them what he had found? True, they might have thought him insane, but they wouldn't have put him to torture. They might even have believed him enough to investigate what he told them, and then the cat would have been out of the bag. The tale would have been incredible, but at least his mind would have been safe.  He turned down another corridor and walked suddenly into waist-deep water, so cold it numbed his legs. He stopped again to force back the tendrils of unreasoning horror that brushed his mind. Nothing could really harm him. He would merely wait until his mind finally reached a balance again. There might be no end; it might be a ghastly trap, but he would wait.  Strangely, the mist was becoming greenish in color as it swirled toward him in the damp vaulted passageway. His eyes began watering a little and the lining of his nose started to burn. He stopped short, newly alarmed, and stared at the walls, rubbing the tears away to clear his vision. The greenish-yellow haze grew thicker, catching his eyes and burning like a thousand furies, ripping into his throat until he was choking and coughing, as though great knives sliced through his lungs.  He tried to scream, and started running, blindly. Each gasping breath was an agony as the blistering gas dug deeper and deeper into his lungs. Reason departed from him; he was screaming incoherently as he stumbled up a stony ramp, crashed into a wall, spun around and smashed blindly into another. Then something caught at his shirt.  He felt the heavy planks and pounded iron scrollwork of a huge door, and threw himself upon it, wrenching at the old latch until the door swung open with a screech of rusty hinges. He fell forward on his face, and the door swung shut behind him.  He lay face down, panting and sobbing in the stillness.  Coarse hands grasped his collar, jerking him rudely to his feet, and he opened his eyes. Across the dim, vaulted room he could see the shadowy form of a man, a big man, with a broad chest and powerful shoulders, a man whose rich voice Harry almost recognized, but whose face was deep in shadow. As Harry wiped the tears from his tortured eyes, he heard the man's voice rumble out at him:  \"Perhaps you've had enough now to change your mind about telling us the truth.\"  Harry stared, not quite comprehending. \"The--the truth?\"  The man's voice was harsh, cutting across the room impatiently. \"The truth, I said. The problem, you fool, what you saw, what you learned; you know perfectly well what I'm referring to. But we'll swallow no more of this silly four-dimensional superman tale, so don't bother to start it.\"  \"I--I don't understand you. It's--it's true--\" Again he tried to peer across the room. \"Why are you hunting me like this? What are you trying to do to me?\"  \"We want the truth. We want to know what you saw.\"  \"But--but _you're_ what I saw. You know what I found out. I mean--\" He stopped, his face going white. His hand went to his mouth, and he stared still harder. \"Who are you?\" he whispered.  \"The truth!\" the man roared. \"You'd better be quick, or you'll be back in the corridor.\"  \"_Webber!_\"  \"Your last chance, Harry.\"  Without warning, Harry was across the room, flying across the desk, crashing into the big man's chest. With a scream of fury he fought, driving his fists into the powerful chest, wrenching at the thick, flailing arms of the startled man.  \"_It's you!_\" he screamed. \"It's you that's been torturing me. It's you that's been hunting me down all this time, not the other people, you and your crowd of ghouls have been at my throat!\"  He threw the big man off balance, dropped heavily on him as he fell back to the ground, glared down into the other's angry brown eyes.  And then, as though he had never been there at all, the big man vanished, and Harry sat back on the floor, his whole body shaking with frustrated sobs as his mind twisted in anguish.  He had been wrong, completely wrong, ever since he had discovered the not-men. Because he had thought _they_ had been the ones who hunted and tortured him for so long. And now he knew how far he had been wrong. For the face of the shadowy man, the man behind the nightmare he was living, was the face of Dr. George Webber.         *       *       *       *       *  \"You're a fool,\" said Dr. Manelli sharply, as he turned away from the sleeping figure on the bed to face the older man. \"Of all the ridiculous things, to let him connect you with this!\" The young doctor turned abruptly and sank down in a chair, glowering at Dr. Webber. \"You haven't gotten to first base yet, but you've just given Scott enough evidence to free himself from integrator control altogether, if he gives it any thought. But I suppose you realize that.\"  \"Nonsense,\" Dr. Webber retorted. \"He had enough information to do that when we first started. I'm no more worried now than I was then. I'm sure he doesn't know enough about the psycho-integrator to be able voluntarily to control the patient-operator relationship to any degree. Oh, no, he's safe enough. But you've missed the whole point of that little interview.\" Dr. Webber grinned at Manelli.  \"I'm afraid I have. It looked to me like useless bravado.\"  \"The persecution, man, the _persecution_! He's shifted his sights! Before that interview, the _not-men_ were torturing him, remember? Because they were afraid he would report his findings to me, of course. But now it's _I_ that's against him.\" The grin widened. \"You see where that leads?\"  \"You're talking almost as though you believed this story about a different sort of people among us.\"  Dr. Webber shrugged. \"Perhaps I do.\"  \"Oh, come now, George.\"  Dr. Webber's eyebrows went up and the grin disappeared from his face.  \"Harry Scott believes it, Frank. We mustn't forget that, or miss its significance. Before Harry started this investigation of his, he wouldn't have paid any attention to such nonsense. But he believes it now.\"  \"But Harry Scott is insane. You said it yourself.\"  \"Ah, yes,\" said Dr. Webber. \"Insane. Just like the others who started to get somewhere along those lines of investigation. Try to analyze the growing incidence of insanity in the population and you yourself go insane. You've got to be crazy to be a psychiatrist. It's an old joke, but it isn't very funny any more. And it's too much for coincidence.  \"And then consider the nature of the insanity--a full-blown paranoia--oh, it's amazing. A cunning organization of men who are _not_-men, a regular fairy story, all straight from Harry Scott's agile young mind. But now it's _we_ who are persecuting him, _and he still believes his fairy tale_.\"  \"So?\"  Dr. Webber's eyes flashed angrily. \"It's too neat, Frank. It's clever, and it's powerful, whatever we've run up against. But I think we've got an ace in the hole. We have Harry Scott.\"  \"And you really think he'll lead us somewhere?\"  Dr. Webber laughed. \"That door I spoke of that Harry peeked through, I think he'll go back to it again. I think he's started to open that door already. And this time I'm going to follow him through.\"     4   It seemed incredible, yet Harry Scott knew he had not been mistaken. It had been Dr. Webber's face he had seen, a face no one could forget, an unmistakable face. And that meant that it had been Dr. Webber who had been persecuting him.  "]]]
