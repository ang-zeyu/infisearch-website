The Mouse delights to nibble cheese,         The Dog bites anything he sees--     But how could they bite off the Moon         Unless they went in a balloon?      And Human People, when they eat         They think it rude to bite their meat,     They use a Knife or Fork or Spoon;         Who is it then that bites the moon?     [Illustration]  The Golden Cat       Great is the Golden Cat who treads          The Blue Roof Garden o'er our heads,     The never tired smiling One          That Human People call the Sun.      He stretches forth his paw at dawn          And though the blinds are closely drawn     His claws peep through like Rays of Light,          To catch the fluttering Bird of Night.      He smiles into the Hayloft dim          And the brown Hay smiles back at him,     And when he strokes the Earth's green fur          He makes the Fields and Meadows purr.      His face is one big Golden smile,          It measures round, at least a mile--     How dull our World would be, and flat,          Without the Golden Pussy Cat.

Then I, the Dangerous Kitten, prowl         And in the Shadows softly growl,     And roam about the farthest floor         Where Kitten never trod before.      And, crouching in the jungle damp,         I watch the Human Hunter's camp,     Ready to spring with fearful roar         As soon as I shall hear them snore.      And then with stealthy tread I crawl          Into the dark and trackless hall,     Where 'neath the Hat-tree's shadows deep          Umbrellas fold their wings and sleep.      A cuckoo calls--and to their dens          The People climb like frightened hens,     And I'm alone--and no one cares          In Darkest Africa--down stairs.     [Illustration]     [Illustration]  The Dog       The Dog is black or white or brown         And sometimes spotted like a clown.     He loves to make a foolish noise         And Human Company enjoys.      The Human People pat his head         And teach him to pretend he's dead,     And beg, and fetch and carry too;         Things that no well-bred Cat will do.      At Human jokes, however stale,         He jumps about and wags his tail,     And Human People clap their hands         And think he really understands.      They say \"Good Dog\" to him. To us         They say \"Poor Puss,\" and make no fuss.     Why Dogs are \"good\" and Cats are \"poor\"         I fail to understand, I'm sure.      To Someone very Good and Just,         Who has proved worthy of her trust,     A Cat will _sometimes_ condescend--         The Dog is Everybody's friend.

First it goes this way, then it goes that,         Just like a bird on the wing.     And all of a tremble I crouch on the mat         Like a Lion, preparing to spring.      And now with a terrible deafening mew,         Like a Tiger I leap on my prey,     And just when I think I have torn it in two         It is up in the air and away."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23434"],["title","An Elementary Study of Insects (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: The Toad may be rough and warty in appearance but worth its weight in gold as a destroyer of insect pests.

INTRODUCTION   In the preparation of a book of this nature, to be used in the grade schools, we realize that the one fundamental thing to keep in mind is the economic importance of the insect, be it good or bad. The child wants to know what is good and what is bad and how he can make use of the good and how he can get rid of the bad. And yet there is something more associated with the life, work and development of each tiny insect. There is a story--a story of growth, not unlike that of the developing child, a story of courage, strife and ultimate success or failure, which is as interesting and of greater value to the child than many of the stories of adventure and of historical facts. Snatches of these stories will appear in the following chapters along with the studies on insects and their economic importance.  In the development of our grade school system, especially in the rural districts, there is a growing demand for some practical work along with the regular cultural studies. To the child in the rural schools, practical knowledge naturally tends toward agriculture. Many of these boys and girls do not have a chance to pursue studies beyond the grades and it therefore becomes necessary to introduce some elementary agriculture into the grades to supply the natural craving of this vast assemblage of children in the rural schools of our land.  In the search for a study which will give unlimited scope for independent thought and observation and which will lead the child to understand better the forces of nature that affect agriculture, nothing is so readily available and attractive to the child as nature study, an elementary study of the natural sciences. In fact agriculture is primarily a course in nature study where we study how plants and animals struggle for existence.  There is a period in the life of every child when he is especially susceptible to the \"call of the fields;\" when he roams through woods or by shady brooks gathering flowers, fishing for mud-cats and cleaning out bumble-bees' nests. It is often compared with the life of the savage and is merely the outward expression of an inward craving for a closer relation with nature and her creatures. If one can reach a child while at that age he has a ready listener and an apt pupil. That is the time to guide and instruct the child along the line of nature study.  The most important questions confronting the average teacher in the grade schools are: \"What material shall I use and how shall I proceed to direct the child along this line?\" First of all use that material which is most readily available, which is most familiar to the child and which will attract and hold his attention. There is nothing so readily available and so generally interesting to both boys and girls as are the thousands of fluttering, buzzing, hopping and creeping forms of insects. They are present everywhere, in all seasons and are known to every child of the city or farm. They are easily observed in the field and can be kept in confinement for study. Many of them are of the greatest importance to man; a study of them becomes of special value.  In pursuing a study of nature and her creatures one should go into the woods and fields as much as possible and study them where they are found. In this way one can determine how they live together, what they feed on and the various other questions which the inquisitive mind of a healthy child will ask. When field work is not possible, gather the insects and keep them alive in jars where they can be fed and observed. Some forms cannot be kept in confinement and in such cases samples should be killed and pinned, thereby forming a collection for study.  Most of the forms which are included in the following chapters can be kept in confinement in glass jars or studies out doors. The studies have been made so general that in case the particular form mentioned is not available any closely related form can be used. Each child should make a small collection of living and pinned insects for study and should be encouraged to observe insects and their work in the field. The collections and many of the observations could be made to good advantage during the summer vacation when the insects are most abundant and active.  Pupils should not be encouraged merely to make observations, but they should be required to record them as well. Brief descriptions of the appearance and development of insects, the injury they do, and remedies for the same, will help fix in mind facts which otherwise might soon be forgotten. Drawings, whenever possible, should also be required. The pupil who can record observations accurately with drawings will not soon forget them. The teacher should therefore require each pupil to provide himself with a note-book for keeping brief, but accurate notes and careful drawings. The drawings should be made with a hard lead pencil on un-ruled paper, the size of the note-book, and the pupils should be encouraged to be neat and accurate.  The author wishes to take this opportunity of expressing his deep appreciation for the many helpful suggestions and other assistance which Mr. R. H. Emberson, superintendent of Boys and Girls Club Work in Missouri, has given. It was his life-long devotion to the boys and girls of the grade schools and his keen appreciation of their needs that lead him first to suggest to the author the importance of preparing this little book for their use.

In undertaking a study of insects it is well first of all to know something about what they are, their general nature, appearance, habits and development. The insects comprise the largest group of animals on the globe. There are about four times as many different kinds of insects as all other kinds of animals combined. Insects vary greatly in size. Some are as large as small birds, while others are so small that a thousand placed in one pile "]]]
