How lonesome the days when dear friends leave us to return no more, whom we never shall see again on earth, who will send us no message or letter of love from the far distant land whither they have gone! It tries our hearts and brings tears to our eyes to lay them in the ground. But shall we never, never see them again? Yes, when we have taken the same journey, when we have closed our eyes on earth and opened them in heaven.  As the months rolled by, the Pensioner's eyes grew dim. He became weak and feeble. \"The Pensioner won't stand it long,\" the people said.  He did not rise one morning when breakfast was ready.  \"Come, grandpa,\" said Paul, opening the bedroom door and calling him; but there was no reply. He lay as if asleep; but his brow was cold, and his heart had stopped beating. He had died calmly and peacefully, and was forever at rest.  It was a sad day to Paul when he followed the body of his dear old grandfather to the grave; but when he stood by his coffin, and looked for the last time upon his grandfather's face, and saw how peaceful it was and how pleasant the smile which rested upon it, as if he was beholding beautiful scenes,--when Paul remembered how good he was, he could not feel it in his soul to say, \"Come back, Grandpa\"; he would be content as it was. But the days were long and dreary, and so were the nights. Many the hours which Paul passed lying awake in his bed, looking through the crevices of the poor old house, and watching the stars and the clouds as they went sailing by. So he was sailing on, and the question would come up, Whither? He listened to the water falling over the dam by the mill, and to the chirping of the crickets, and the sighing of the wind, and the church-bell tolling the hours: they were sweet, yet mournful and solemn sounds. Tears stood in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks, as he thought that he and his mother were on earth, and his father and grandfather were praising God in the heavenly choirs. But he resolved to be good, to take care of his mother, and be her comfort and joy.  Hard times came on. How to live was the great question; for now that his grandfather was gone, they could have the pension no longer. The neighbors were very kind. Sometimes Mr. Middlekauf, Hans's father, who had a great farm, left a bag of meal for them when he came into the village. There was little work for Paul to do in the village; but he kept their own garden in good trim,--the onion-bed clear of weeds, and the potatoes well hilled. Very pleasant it was to work there, where the honey-bees hummed over the beds of sage, and among his mother's flowers, and where bumble-bees dusted their yellow jackets in the hollyhocks. Swallows also built their nests under the eaves of the house, and made the days pleasant with their merry twittering.  The old Pensioner had been a land surveyor. The compass which he used was a poor thing; but he had run many lines with it through the grand old forest. One day, as Paul was weeding the onions, it occurred to him that he might become a surveyor; so he went into the house, took the compass from its case, and sat down to study it. He found his grandfather's surveying-book, and began to study that. Some parts were hard and dry; but having resolved to master it, he was not the boy to give up a good resolution. It was not long before he found out how to run a line, how to set off angles, and how to ascertain the distance across a river or pond without measuring it. He went into the woods, and stripped great rolls of birch bark from the trees, carried them home, spread them out on the table, and plotted his lines with his dividers and ruler. He could not afford paper. He took great pleasure in making a sketch of the ground around the house, the garden, the orchard, the field, the road, and the river.  The people of New Hope had long been discussing the project of building a new road to Fairview, which would cross the pond above the mill. But there was no surveyor in the region to tell them how long the bridge must be which they would have to build.  \"We will send up a kite, and thus get a string across the pond,\" said one of the citizens.  \"I can ascertain the distance easier than that,\" said Paul.  Mr. Pimpleberry, the carpenter, who was to build the bridge, laughed, and looked with contempt upon him, Paul thought, because he was barefoot and had a patch on each knee.  \"Have you ever measured it, Paul?\" Judge Adams asked.  \"No, sir; but I will do so just to let Mr. Pimpleberry see that I can do it.\"  He ran into the house, brought out the compass, went down to the edge of the pond, drove a small stake in the ground, set his compass over it, and sighted a small oak-tree upon the other side of the pond. It happened that the tree was exactly south from the stake; then he turned the sights of his compass so that they pointed exactly east and west. Then he took Mr. Pimpleberry's ten-foot pole, and measured out fifty feet toward the west, and drove another stake. Then he set his compass there, and took another sight at the small oak-tree across the pond. It was not south now, but several degrees east of south. Then he turned his compass so that the sights would point just the same number of degrees to the east of north.  \"Now, Mr. Pimpleberry,\" said Paul, \"I want you to stand out there, and hold your ten-foot pole just where I tell you, putting yourself in range with the stake I drove first and the tree across the pond.\"  Mr. Pimpleberry did as he was desired.  \"Drive a stake where your pole stands,\" said Paul.  Mr. Pimpleberry did so.  \"Now measure the distance from the one you have just driven to my first stake, and that will be the distance across the pond,\" said Paul.  \"I don't believe it,\" said Mr. Pimpleberry.  \"Paul is right,\" said Judge Adams. \"I understand the principle. He has done it correctly.\"  The Judge was proud of him. Mr. Pimpleberry and Mr. Funk, and several other citizens, were astonished; for they had no idea that Paul could do anything of the kind. Notwithstanding Paul had given the true distance, he received no thanks from any one; yet he didn't care for that; for he had shown Mr. Pimpleberry that he could do it, and that was glory enough.  Paul loved fun as well as ever. Rare times he had at school. One windy day, a little boy, when he entered the school-room, left the door open. \"Go back and shut the door,\" shouted Mr. Cipher, who was very irritable that morning. Another boy entered, and left it open. Mr. Cipher was angry, and spoke to the whole school: \"Any one who comes in to-day and does not shut the door will get a flogging. Now remember!\" Being very awkward in his manners, inefficient in government, and shallow-brained and vain, he commanded very little respect from the scholars.  \"Boys, there is a chance for us to have a jolly time with Cipher,\" said Paul at recess.  \"What is it?\" Hans Middlekauf asked, ready for fun of any sort. The boys gathered round, for they knew that Paul was a capital hand in inventing games.  \"You remember what Cipher said about leaving the door open.\"  \"Well, what of it?\" Hans Middlekauf asked.  \"Let every one of us show him that we can obey him. When he raps for us to go in, I want you all to form in line. I'll lead off, go in and shut the door; you follow next, Hans, and be sure and shut the door; you come next, Philip; then Michael, and so on,--every one shutting the door. If you don't, remember that Cipher has promised to flog you.\"  The boys saw through the joke, and laughed heartily. \"Jingo, that is a good one, Paul. Cipher will be as mad as a March hare. I'll make the old door rattle,\" said Hans.  Rap--rap--rap--rap! went the master's ruler upon the window.  \"Fall into line, boys,\" said Paul. They obeyed orders as if he were a general. \"Now remember, every one of you, to shut the door just as soon as you are in. Do it quick, and take your seats. Don't laugh, but be as sober as deacons.\" There was giggling in the ranks. \"Silence!\" said Paul. The boys smoothed their faces. Paul opened the door, stepped in, and shut it in an instant,--slam! Hans opened it,--slam! it went, with a jar which made the windows rattle. Philip followed,--slam! Michael next,--bang! it went, jarring the house.  \"Let the door be open,\" said Cipher; but Michael was in his seat; and--bang! again,--slam!--bang!--slam!--bang! it went.  \"Let it be open, I say!\" he roared, but the boys outside did not hear him, and it kept going,--slam!--slam!--slam!--bang!--bang!--bang!--till the fiftieth boy was in.  \"You started that, sir,\" Cipher said, addressing Paul, for he had discovered that Paul Parker loved fun, and was a leading spirit among the boys.  \"I obeyed your orders, sir,\" Paul replied ready to burst into a roar at the success of his experiment.  \"Did you not tell the boys to slam the door as hard as they could?\"  \"No, sir. I told them to remember what you had said, and that, if they didn't shut the door, they would get a flogging.\"  \"That is just what he said, Master,\" said Hans Middlekauf, brimming over with fun. Cipher could not dispute it. He saw that they had literally obeyed his orders, and that he had been outwitted. He did not know what to do; and being weak and inefficient, did nothing.  Paul loved hunting and fishing; on Saturday afternoons he made the woods ring with the crack of his grandfather's gun, bringing squirrels from the tallest trees, and taking quails upon the wing. He was quick to see, and swift to take aim. He was cool of nerve, and so steady of aim that he rarely missed. It was summer, and he wore no shoes. He walked so lightly that he scarcely rustled a leaf. The partridges did not see him till he was close upon them, and then, before they could rise from their cover flash!--bang!--and they went into his bag.  One day as he was on his return from the woods, with the gun upon his shoulder, and the powder-horn at his side, he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22913"],["title","Winning His Way (#4)"],["body","a gathering of people in the street. Men, women, and children were out,--the women without bonnets. He wondered what was going on. Some women were wringing their hands; and all were greatly excited.  \"O dear, isn't it dreadful!\" \"What will become of us?\" \"The Lord have mercy upon us!\"--were the expressions which he heard. Then they wrung their hands again, and moaned.  \"What is up?\" he asked of Hans Middlekauf.  \"Haven't you heard?\"  \"No, what is it?\"  \"Why, there is a big black bull-dog, the biggest that ever was, that has run mad. He has bitten ever so many other dogs, and horses, sheep, and cattle. He is as big as a bear, and froths at the mouth. He is the savagest critter that ever was,\" said Hans in a breath.  \"Why don't somebody kill him?\"  \"They are afraid of him,\" said Hans.  \"I should think they might kill him,\" Paul replied.  \"I reckon you would run as fast as anybody else, if he should show himself round here,\" said Hans.  \"There he is! Run! run! run for your lives!\" was the sudden cry.  Paul looked up the street, and saw a very large bull-dog coming upon the trot. Never was there such a scampering. People ran into the nearest houses, pellmell. One man jumped into his wagon, lashed his horse into a run, and went down the street, losing his hat in his flight, while Hans Middlekauf went up a tree.  \"Run, Paul! Run! he'll bite you!\" cried Mr. Leatherby from the window of his shoe-shop. People looked out from the windows and repeated the cry, a half-dozen at once; but Paul took no notice of them. Those who were nearest him heard the click of his gun-lock. The dog came nearer, growling, and snarling, his mouth wide open, showing his teeth, his eyes glaring, and white froth dripping from his lips. Paul stood alone in the street. There was a sudden silence. It was a scene for a painter,--a barefoot boy in patched clothes, with an old hat on his head, standing calmly before the brute whose bite was death in its most terrible form. One thought had taken possession of Paul's mind, that he ought to kill the dog.  Nearer, nearer, came the dog; he was not a rod off. Paul had read that no animal can withstand the steady gaze of the human eye. He looked the dog steadily in the face. He held his breath. Not a nerve trembled. The dog stopped, looked at Paul a moment, broke into a louder growl, opened his jaws wider, his eyes glaring more wildly, and stepped slowly forward. Now or never, Paul thought, was his time. The breach of the gun touched his shoulder; his eye ran along the barrel,--bang! the dog rolled over with a yelp and a howl, but was up again, growling and trying to get at Paul, who in an instant seized his gun by the barrel, and brought the breech down upon the dog's skull, giving him blow after blow.  \"Kill him! kill him!\" shouted the people from the windows.  \"Give it to him! Mash his head!\" cried Hans from the tree.  The dog soon became a mangled and bloody mass of flesh and bones. The people came out from their houses.  \"That was well done for a boy,\" said Mr. Funk.  \"Or for a man either,\" said Mr. Chrome, who came up and patted Paul on his back.  \"I should have thrown my lapstone at him, if I could have got my window open,\" said Mr. Leatherby. Mr. Noggin, the cooper, who had taken refuge in Leatherby's shop, afterwards said that Leatherby was frightened half to death, and kept saying, \"Just as like as not he will make a spring and dart right through the window!\"  \"Nobly, bravely done, Paul,\" said Judge Adams. \"Let me shake hands with you, my boy.\" He and Mrs. Adams and Azalia had seen it all from their parlor window.  \"O Paul, I was afraid he would bite and kill you, or that your gun would miss fire. I trembled all over just like a leaf,\" said Azalia, still pale and trembling. \"O, I am so glad you have killed him!\" She looked up into his face earnestly, and there was such a light in her eyes, that Paul was glad he had killed the dog, for her sake.  \"Weren't you afraid, Paul?\" she asked.  \"No. If I had been afraid, I should have missed him, perhaps; I made up my mind to kill him, and what was the use of being afraid?\"  Many were the praises bestowed upon Paul. \"How noble! how heroic!\" the people said. Hans told the story to all the boys in the village. \"Paul was just as cool as--cool as--a cucumber,\" he said, that being the best comparison he could think of. The people came and looked at the dog, to see how large he was, and how savage, and went away saying, \"I am glad he is dead, but I don't see how Paul had the courage to face him.\"  Paul went home and told his mother what had happened. She turned pale while listening to the story, and held her breath, and clasped her hands; but when he had finished, and when she thought that, if Paul had not killed the dog, many might have been bitten, she was glad, and said, \"You did right, my son. It is our duty to face danger if we can do good.\" A tear glistened in her eye as she kissed him. \"God bless you, Paul,\" she said, and smiled upon him through her tears.  All the dogs which had been bitten were killed to prevent them from running mad. A hard time of it the dogs of New Hope had, for some which had not been bitten did not escape the dog-killers, who went through the town knocking them over with clubs.  Although Paul was so cool and courageous in the moment of danger, he trembled and felt weak afterwards when he thought of the risk he had run. That night when he said his evening prayer, he thanked God for having protected him. He dreamed it all over again in the night. He saw the dog coming at him with his mouth wide open, the froth dropping from his lips, and his eyes glaring. He heard his growl,--only it was not a growl, but a branch of the old maple which rubbed against the house when the wind blew. That was what set him a-dreaming. In his dream he had no gun, so he picked up the first thing he could lay his hands on, and let drive at the dog. Smash! there was a great racket, and a jingling of glass. Paul was awake in an instant, and found that he had jumped out of bed, and was standing in the middle of the floor, and that he had knocked over the spinning-wheel, and a lot of old trumpery, and had thrown one of his grandfather's old boots through the window.  \"What in the world are you up to, Paul?\" his mother asked, calling from the room below, in alarm.  \"Killing the dog a second time, mother,\" Paul replied, laughing and jumping into bed again.     CHAPTER III.  MERRY TIMES.   When the long northeast storms set in, and the misty clouds hung over the valley, and went hurrying away to the west, brushing the tops of the trees; when the rain, hour after hour, and day after day, fell aslant upon the roof of the little old house; when the wind swept around the eaves, and dashed in wild gusts against the windows, and moaned and wailed in the forests,--then it was that Paul sometimes felt his spirits droop, for the circumstances of life were all against him. He was poor. His dear, kind mother was sick. She had worked day and night to keep that terrible wolf from the door, which is always prowling around the houses of poor people. But the wolf had come, and was looking in at the windows. There was a debt due Mr. Funk for rice, sugar, biscuit, tea, and other things which Doctor Arnica said his mother must have. There was the doctor's bill. The flour-barrel was getting low, and the meal-bag was almost empty. Paul saw the wolf every night as he lay in his bed, and he wished he could kill it.  When his mother was taken sick, he left school and became her nurse. It was hard for him to lay down his books, for he loved them, but it was pleasant to wait upon her. The neighbors were kind. Azalia Adams often came tripping in with something nice,--a tumbler of jelly, or a plate of toast, which her mother had prepared; and she had such cheerful words, and spoke so pleasantly, and moved round the room so softly, putting everything in order, that the room was lighter, even on the darkest days, for her presence.  When, after weeks of confinement to her bed, Paul's mother was strong enough to sit in her easy-chair, Paul went out to fight the wolf. He worked for Mr. Middlekauf, in his cornfield. He helped Mr. Chrome paint wagons. He surveyed land, and ran lines for the farmers, earning a little here and a little there. As fast as he obtained a dollar, it went to pay the debts. As the seasons passed away,--spring, summer, and autumn,--Paul could see that the wolf howled less fiercely day by day. He denied himself everything, except plain food. He was tall, stout, hearty, and rugged. The winds gave him health; his hands were hard, but his heart was tender. When through with his day's work, though his bones ached and his eyes were drowsy, he seldom went to sleep without first studying awhile, and closing with a chapter from the Bible, for he remembered what his grandfather often said,--that a chapter from the Bible was a good thing to sleep on.  The cool and bracing breezes of November, the nourishing food which Paul obtained, brought the color once more to his mother's cheeks; and when at length she was able to be about the house, they had a jubilee,--a glad day of thanksgiving,--for, in addition to this blessing of health, Paul had killed the wolf, and the debts were all paid.  As the winter came on, the subject of employing Mr. Rhythm to teach a singing-school was discussed. Mr. Quaver, a tall, slim man, with a long, red nose, had led the choir for many years. He had a loud voice, and twisted his words so badly, that his singing was like the blare of a trumpet. On Sundays, after Rev. Mr. Surplice read the hymn, the people were accustomed to hear a loud Hawk! from Mr. Quaver, as he tossed his tobacco-quid into a spittoon, and an Ahem! from Miss Gamut. She was the leading first treble, a small lady with a sharp, shrill voice. Then Mr. Fiddleman sounded the key on the bass-viol, do-mi-sol-do, helping the trebles and tenors climb the stairs of the scale; then he hopped down"]]]
