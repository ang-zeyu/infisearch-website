Ere long the boats were ready to be launched over the side, but this was a matter of the greatest difficulty and danger, for the sea was still running high, and the ship rolled heavily.  And now the great evil of not being provided with proper tackling to launch the boats became apparent.  One of the quarter-boats was the first to be lowered; it was full of men.  The order was given to lower, and it dropped on the water all right.  Then the order to unhook the tackle was given.  The man at the stern tackle succeeded in unhooking, but the man at the bow failed.  The result was fatal and instantaneous. When the ship rose on the next wave, the boat was lifted by the bow out of the water until she hung from the davits, and a terrible cry was uttered as all the men were thrown out of her into the sea.  Next moment the boat was plunged into the waves, the tackle snapt, and she was swept away.  \"Lower away the long-boat!\" shouted the captain.  This was eagerly and quickly done, and the mate with a number of men leaped into it.  The lowering was successfully accomplished, but when they pulled to the spot where the quarter-boat had gone down, not one of those who had manned her could be found.  All had perished.  The remaining four boats were lowered in safety, and all of them pulled away from the sinking ship, for latterly she had been settling down so deep that it was feared every pitch would be her last, and had she sunk while the boats were alongside, their destruction would have been inevitable.  They were rowed, therefore, to a safe distance, and there awaited the end.  There was something inexpressibly sad in this.  It seemed like standing at the death-bed of an old friend.  The sea was still heaving violently; the gale, although moderated, was still pretty stiff, and the sun was setting in wild lurid clouds when the _Foam_ rose for the last time-- every spar and rope standing out sharply against the sky.  Then she bent forward slowly, as she overtopped a huge billow.  Into the hollow she rushed.  Like an expert diver she went down head foremost into the deep, and, next moment, those who had so lately trod her deck saw nothing around them save the lowering sky and the angry waters of the Pacific Ocean.    CHAPTER FIVE.  ADRIFT ON THE WIDE OCEAN.  For some time after the disappearance of the ship, the men in the boats continued to gaze, in a species of unbelief, at the place where she had gone down.  They evidently felt it difficult to realise the truth of what they had seen.  The suddenness of the change and the extreme danger of their position might have shaken the stoutest hearts, for the sea still ran high and none of the boats were fitted to live in rough weather.  They were, as far as could be judged, many hundreds of miles from land, and, to add to the horror of their circumstances, night was coming on.  \"My lads,\" said Captain Dall, sitting down in the stern of his boat, and grasping the tiller, \"it has pleased the Almighty to sink our ship and to spare our lives.  Let us be thankful that we didn't go to the bottom along with her.  To the best of my knowledge we're a long way from land, and all of us will have to take in a reef in our appetites for some time to come.  I have taken care to have a good supply of salt junk, biscuit, water, and lime-juice put aboard, so that if the weather don't turn out uncommon bad, we may manage, with God's blessing, to make the land.  In circumstances of this kind, men's endurance is sometimes tried pretty sharply, and men in distress are occasionally driven to forgetting their duty to their comrades.  I tell you beforehand, lads, that I will do all that in me lies to steer you to the nearest port, and to make your lot as comfortable as may be in an open boat; but if any of you should take a fancy to having his own way, I've brought with me a little leaden pill-box (here the captain drew aside the breast of his coat and exposed the handle of a revolver) which will tend to keep up discipline and prevent discord.  Now, lads, ship your oars and hoist the foresail close-reefed, and look alive, for it seems to me that we'll have a squally night.\"  The effect of this speech was very striking.  There is nothing that men dislike so much, in critical circumstances, where action is necessary, as uncertainty or want of decision on the part of their leader.  The loss of their ship, and their forlorn, almost desperate condition, had sunk their spirits so much that an air of apathetic recklessness had, for a few minutes, crossed the countenances of some of the boldest among the sailors; but while the captain was speaking this expression passed away, and when he had finished they all gave one hearty cheer, and obeyed his orders with alacrity.  In a few minutes the sails, closely reefed, were hoisted, and the long-boat rushed swiftly over the waves.  At first the four boats kept company--the other three having also made sail--but as darkness set in they lost sight of each other.  The first mate had charge of the jolly-boat, and the second mate and carpenter had the two others.  In the captain's boat were Will Osten, Larry O'Hale, Goff, Muggins, and several of the best seamen.  Soon after the sails were set, a heavy sea broke inboard and nearly filled the boat.  \"Bail her out, lads,\" shouted the captain.  There was no occasion for the order, the men knew their danger well enough, and every one seized anything that came to hand and began to bail for life.  There was only one bucket on board, and this was appropriated by the cook, who, being one of the strongest men in the boat, thought himself entitled to the post of honour, and, truly, the way in which Larry handled that bucket and showered the water over the side justified his opinion of himself.  \"We must rig up something to prevent that happening again,\" said Captain Dall; \"set to work, Goff, and cut a slice out of the tarpaulin, and nail it over the bows.\"  This was done without delay, and in less than an hour a sort of half-deck was made, which turned off the spray and rendered the task of bailing much lighter--a matter of considerable importance, for, in such a sea, there was no possibility of an open boat remaining afloat without constant bailing.  At first the men talked a good deal in comparatively cheerful tones while they worked, and the irrepressible Larry O'Hale even ventured to cut one or two jokes; but when night began to cover the deep with thick darkness, one after another dropped out of the conversation, and at last all were perfectly silent, except when it became necessary to give an order or answer a question, and nothing was heard save the whistling of the wind and the gurgling of the waves as they rushed past, their white crests curling over the edge of the boat as if greedy to swallow her, and gleaming like lambent fire all around.  \"This is a terrible situation,\" said Will Osten, in a low tone, with an involuntary shudder.  \"Do you think there is much chance of our surviving, captain?\"  \"That's not an easy question to answer, doctor,\" replied Captain Dall, in a tone so hearty that our hero was much cheered by it.  \"You see, there is much in our favour as well as much against us.  In the first place, this is the Pacific, and according to its name we have a right to expect more fine weather than bad, especially at this time of the year. Then we have the trade winds to help us, and our boat is a good one, with at least two weeks' provisions aboard.  But then, on the other hand, we're a terrible long way off land, and we must count upon a gale now and then, which an open boat, however good, is not calc'lated to weather easily.  See that now,\" added the captain, looking back over the stern, where, from out of the darkness, Osten could just see a huge wave, like a black mountain with a snowy top, rolling towards them.  \"If we were only a little more down in the stern, that fellow would drop on board of us and send us to the bottom in half a minute.\"  Will felt that, although the captain's tones were reassuring, his words were startling.  He was ill at ease, and clutched the seat when the billow rolled under them, raising the stern of the boat so high that it seemed as if about to be thrown completely over, but the wave passed on, and they fell back into the trough of the sea.  \"Musha! but that was a wathery mountain no less,\" exclaimed Larry.  \"You've heard of Captain Bligh, Larry, I suppose?\" said the captain, in a loud voice, with the intention of letting the men hear his remarks.  \"May be I have,\" replied Larry with caution, \"but if so I misremimber.\"  \"He was the captain of the _Bounty_, whose crew mutinied and turned him adrift in an open boat in the middle of the Pacific.  What I was goin' to tell ye was, that his circumstances were a trifle worse than ours, for he was full four thousand miles from the nearest land, and with short allowance of provisions on board.\"  \"An' did he make out the voyage, sur?\" asked Larry.  \"He did, and did it nobly too, in the face of great trouble and danger, but it's too long a yarn to spin just now; some day when the weather's fine I'll spin it to 'ee.  He weathered some heavy gales, too, and what one man has done another man may do; so we've no reason to get down-hearted, for we're nearer land than he was, and better off in every way.  I wish I could say as much for the other boats.\"  The captain's voice dropped a little in spite of himself as he concluded, for, despite the strength and buoyancy of his spirit, he could not help feeling deep anxiety as to the fate of his companions in misfortune.  Thus, talking at intervals in hopeful tones, and relapsing into long periods of silence, they spent that stormy night without refreshment and without rest.  The minutes seemed to float on leaden wings, and the weary watchers experienced in its highest degree that dreary feeling--so common in the sick room--t"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23271"],["title","Sunk at Sea (#5)"],["body","\"morning would _never_ come.\"  But morning came at length--a faint glimmer on the eastern horizon.  It was hailed by Larry with a deep sigh, and the earnest exclamation--  \"Ah, then, there's the blessed sun at last, good luck to it!\"  Gradually the glimmer increased into grey dawn, then a warm tint brightened up the sky, and golden clouds appeared.  At last the glorious sun arose in all its splendour, sending rays of warmth to the exhausted frames of the seamen and hope to their hearts.  They much needed both, for want of sleep, anxiety, and cold, had already stamped a haggard look of suffering on their faces.  As the morning advanced, however, this passed away, and by degrees they began to cheer up and bestir themselves,--spreading out their clothes to dry, and scanning the horizon at intervals in search of the other boats.  About eight o'clock, as nearly as he could guess, the captain said--  \"Now, lads, let's have breakfast; get out the bread-can.  Come, Larry, look alive!  You've no cooking to do this morning, but I doubt not that your teeth are as sharp and your twist as strong as ever.\"  \"Stronger than iver, sur, av ye plaze.\"  \"I'm sorry to hear it, for you'll have to go on short allowance, I fear.\"  \"Ochone!\" groaned the cook.  \"Never mind, Larry,\" said Will Osten, assisting to spread the sea-biscuit and salt junk on one of the thwarts; \"there's a good time coming.\"  \"Sure, so's Christmas, doctor, but it's a long way off,\" said Larry.  \"Fetch me the scales; now then, doctor, hold 'em,\" said the captain, carefully weighing out a portion of biscuit and meat which he handed to one of the men.  This process was continued until all had been supplied, after which a small quantity of water and lime-juice was also measured out to each.  The breakfast was meagre, but it was much needed, and as the sea had gone down during the night and the morning was beautiful, it was eaten not only in comfort, but with some degree of cheerfulness.  While they were thus engaged, Goff looked up and exclaimed suddenly, \"Hallo! look here, boys!\"  Every one started up and gazed in the direction indicated, where they saw something black floating on the water.  The captain, who had taken the precaution before leaving the ship to sling his telescope over his shoulder, applied it to his eye, and in a few seconds exclaimed, \"It's the jolly-boat capsized!  Out with the oars, boys--be smart!  There's some of 'em clinging to the keel.\"  It need scarcely be said that the men seized the oars and plied them with all their might.  Under the influence of these and the sail together they soon drew near, and then it was distinctly seen that three men were clinging to the boat--it followed, of course, that all the rest must have been drowned.  Silently and swiftly they pulled alongside, and in a few minutes had rescued Mr Cupples and the steward and one of the sailors, all of whom were so much exhausted that they could not speak for some time after being taken on board.  When they could tell what had happened, their tale was brief and sad.  They had kept in sight of the long-boat while light enabled them to do so.  After that they had run before the gale, until a heavy sea capsized them, from which time they could remember nothing, except that they had managed to get on the bottom of the upturned boat, to which they had clung for many hours in a state of partial insensibility.    CHAPTER SIX.  DESCRIBES A BOAT VOYAGE, AND TOUCHES ON CORAL ISLANDS.  The gale moderated to a fresh breeze, and all that day the long-boat of the ill-fated _Foam_ flew over the sea towards the west.  \"You see,\" said Captain Dall, in answer to a question put to him by Will Osten, \"I don't know exactly whereabouts we are, because there was a longish spell of dirty weather afore the _Foam_ went down, and I hadn't got a sight o' the sun for more than a week; but it's my belief that we are nearer to some of the coral islands than to the coast of South America, though how near I cannot tell.  Five hundred miles, more or less, perhaps.\"  \"A mere trifle, sure!\" said Larry, filling his pipe carefully--for his was the only pipe that had been rescued from the sinking ship, and the supply of tobacco was very small.  Small as it was, however, the captain had taken the precaution to collect it all together, causing every man to empty his pockets of every inch that he possessed, and doled it out in small equal quantities.  The pipe, however, could not be treated thus, so it had to be passed round--each man possessing it in turn for a stated number of minutes, when, if he had not consumed his portion, he was obliged to empty the pipe and give it up.  \"It's my turn, Larry,\" cried Muggins, holding out his hand for the coveted implement of fumigation.  \"No, ye spalpeen, it's not,\" said Larry, continuing to press down the precious weed, \"owld Bob had it last, an' ivery wan knows that I come after him.\"  \"It's the first time I ever heard ye admit that you comed after anybody,\" answered Muggins with a grin; \"ye ginerally go before us all-- at least ye want to.\"  \"Not at all,\" retorted the cook; \"whin there's dirty work to be done, I most usually kape modestly in the background, an' lets you go first, bekase it's your nat'ral callin'.  Arrah! the sun's goin' to set, boys,\" he added with a sigh, as he commenced to smoke.  This was true, and the knowledge that another long night of darkness was about to set in depressed the spirits which had begun to revive a little.  Silence gradually ensued as they sat watching the waves or gazing wistfully towards the gorgeous mass of clouds in which the sun was setting.  For a considerable time they sat thus, when suddenly Will Osten started up, and, pointing towards the horizon a little to the left of the sun, exclaimed--  \"Look there, captain; what's that?\"  \"Land ho!\" shouted Larry O'Hale at that moment, springing up on the thwart and holding on to the foremast.  All the rest leaped up in great excitement.  \"It's only a cloud,\" said one.  \"It's a fog-bank,\" cried another.  \"I never seed a fog-bank with an edge like that,\" observed old Bob, \"an' I've sailed the salt sea long enough to know.\"  \"Land it is, thank God,\" said the captain earnestly, shutting up his telescope.  \"Get out the oars again, lads!  We can't make it before dark, but the sooner we get there the better, for landing on these coral islands isn't always an easy job.\"  The oars were got out at once, and the men pulled with a will, but it was late at night before they drew near to the land and heard the roar of the surf on the coral reef that stood as a sentinel to guard the island.  \"Captain,\" said Will Osten, \"the wind has almost died away, yet it seems to me that the surf roars as violently as if a storm were raging.\"  \"That surf never goes down in those seas, doctor.  Even in calm weather the swell of the big ocean gathers into a huge billow and bursts in foam upon the coral islands.\"  \"Surely, then,\" said Will, \"it must make landing both difficult and dangerous.\"  \"It is, sometimes, but not always,\" replied the captain; \"for a channel of safety has been provided, as you shall see, before long.  Take the boat-hook, Goff, and look out in the bows.\"  The man rose and stood up with the boat-hook ready to \"fend off\" if necessary.  A word or two here about the coral islands--those wonderful productions of the coral insect--may perhaps render the position of the boat and her subsequent proceedings more intelligible.  They are of all sizes and shapes.  Some are small and low, like emeralds just rising out of the ocean, with a few cocoa-nut palms waving their tufted heads above the sandy soil.  Others are many miles in extent, covered with large forest trees and rich vegetation.  Some are inhabited, others are the abode only of sea-fowl.  In many of them the natives are naked savages of the most depraved character.  In a few, where the blessed gospel of Jesus Christ has been planted, the natives are to be seen, \"clothed and in their right minds.\"  Wherever the gospel has taken root, commerce has naturally sprung up, and the evils that invariably follow in her train have in too many cases been attributed to Christianity.  Poor indeed must be that man's knowledge of the influence of Christianity, who would judge of its quality or value by the fruit of its _professors_.  \"By their fruits ye shall know _them_,\" truly--_them_, but not Christianity.  The world is an hospital, and life the period of convalescence.  Christianity is the one grand and all-sufficient medicine.  Shall we, the afflicted and jaundiced patients, still suffering from the virulence and effect of sin, condemn the medicine because it does not turn us out cured in a single day? Still, even to fruits we can appeal, mingled and confounded with crab-apples though they be.  Come, sceptic, make a trial of it.  Go to the Fiji Islands; get yourself wrecked among them.  Be cast into the stormy deep; buffet the waves manfully, and succeed in struggling exhausted to the shore.  The savages there, if not Christianised, will haul you out of the sea, roast you, and eat you!  They do this in compliance with a humane little law which maintains that all who are shipwrecked, and cast on shore, are thus to be disposed of.  Ha! you need not smile.  The record of this fact may be read, in unquestionable authorities, in every public library in the kingdom.  Search and see.  On the other hand, go and get cast on one of the Fiji group where Christianity holds sway, and there, despite the errors, inconsistencies, and sins of its professors and enemies, the same natives will haul you out of the sea, receive you into their houses, feed and clothe you, and send you on your way rejoicing.  There is one peculiarity which applies to most of the coral islands-- each is partially surrounded by a coral reef which lies at a distance from the shore varying from less than one to two miles.  Outside of this reef the sea may heave tumultuously, but the lagoon"]]]
