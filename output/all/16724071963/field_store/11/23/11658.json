CHAPTER II  \"THE ACCURSED POWER OF GOLD!\"   DAVE made no struggle.  \"You're a pair of fools!\" he declared, somewhat hoarsely, for the effects of the severe choking were still present.  \"Fools, maybe,\" assented the skipper of the \"Olga.\" \"But if ve must trouble have den you die shall.\"  \"What do you want me to do?\" Darrin demanded.  \"You send your men to your ship back,\" declared the big fellow. \"Den your ship it must out of sight go yet. Ve shall sail back vonce. If your ship, or any udder ship to stop us try, den you die shall already--on deck, in sight your friends of.\"  \"You big chump!\" uttered Darrin.  \"Vy you call me dot?\"  \"Because, no matter what you do or don't do to me, you are going to be taken and punished. Do you think my ship would sail without me?\"  \"Maybe, sooner dan see you killed vonce,\" glowered the skipper of the \"Olga.\"  \"You idiot, my subordinates, their suspicions aroused, are bound to take this craft, no matter what happens to me. They must do their duty without consideration for my safety.\"  \"So?\" uttered the skipper, looking at Dave dully.  \"So!\" Darrin assured him.  \"But den you die must vonce.\"  \"Go ahead and kill me,\" Darrin dared him.  \"But if you vill to reason yet listen--\"  \"You're wasting time and breath,\" Darrin assured him, coolly.  Just then something happened. Darrin, using a trick that he had learned on the wrestling mat and had since perfected, threw both his arms around the left arm of the \"Olga's\" skipper. Clasping his hands and pressing his arms against the skipper's left arm, Dave gave a great heave and rolled to his own left. The trick depended upon speed.  The skipper crashed over on his head. The revolver was discharged in the overturn, but the bullet went wild.  In the twinkling of an eye Dave had grabbed the weapon, and leaped to his feet just in time to dodge the hatch bar that the mate tried to smash down on his head.  \"Back, unless you want yours right now!\" Darrin challenged. Swiftly he changed the revolver into his left hand as he still covered the pair. Then he reached for his own automatic, throwing off the safety device.  \"Now, you, Mr. Mate, slip around and unbolt the door, throwing it open,\" Dave ordered. \"Any sign of a trick will end your life on the spot!\"  Seemingly cowed, the mate obeyed.  \"Open the door--throw it wide open,\" Dave commanded.  The door was thrust ajar just as the two seamen with the tape reached the bottom of the ladder coming from the deck. These two seamen stared in astonishment at the stuffy apartment off the after hold.  \"Men, take charge of these two rascals!\" Darrin commanded, briskly. \"Step lively, both of you!\"--this last to skipper and mate, who obeyed as though dazed.  \"Pass them up on deck as prisoners,\" ordered Darrin, and this was done, the two seamen drawing their revolvers and standing by the \"Olga's\" discomfited officers.  \"Now, for your report,\" Darrin went on. One of the sailors reported the deck-length from hatchway to stern-post.  \"A difference of twenty-one feet,\" smiled Dave, darkly, pointing aft in the hold. \"You see, men, there are a good many feet of length to be accounted for, which means that there is another compartment aft of this hold. You,\" turning to one of the sailors, \"go forward and request Ensign Burton, with my compliments, to take charge of this steamer. He will round up the crew and place them under guard. Then the ensign will leave a petty officer in charge of deck and prisoners and report to me here.\"  Within a very short time Mr. Burton had so reported. Dave, in the meantime, having worked his way over the cargo, had found a cleverly concealed door at the after end of the hold.  \"There should be a key to this door, sir,\" said Ensign Burton, \"but if there is a key-hole we are unable to find it. If this really be a door it must be operated by a hidden spring.\"  \"Perhaps an axe will work as well as either key or spring,\" Darrin suggested. \"Pass the word for one.\"  The axe was brought by a heavily built seaman, who prepared to swing it against the door panelling.  \"Break away the boards as gently as possible,\" continued Dave. \"There may be an explosive device on the other side of the panelling. For that reason I'll stand by you, to take equal risk.\"  \"If there is any risk, I'd rather you wouldn't take it, sir,\" urged the sailor.  \"Thank you, but I'll stand by. Swing the axe,\" ordered Dave.  A few blows knocked in the panelling, revealing, beyond, a room of considerable size. Into this stepped the two officers, followed by the seamen with them. Unlike any part of the ship they had previously seen, this place was lighted by electricity. Burton found the switch, and turning it on, let in a flood of light.  \"Sir, did you ever!\" gasped the ensign.  The purpose of this room was all too plain. It was fitted with compressors, leading to a tube that left the ship under water. A small but powerful crane was in place over a closed hatchway. The latter, when opened, was found to lead down into a second hold, also electrically lighted. The two officers explored this second hold.  \"Mines were kept here,\" Dave nodded, \"and were hoisted above as needed. They were dropped astern by means of a compressed air apparatus which, when the mine tube was open, kept the sea from entering. This ugly looking little steamer, outwardly a wood pulp carrier, is really a very capable mine-layer. She has been busy, too, on this cruise to England, but had sown all her mines before we overhauled her.\"  \"It's plain enough, sir,\" agreed Ensign Burton.  \"Confound this rascally skipper!\" blazed Darrin, wrathfully. \"While naval craft have been searching everywhere for submarine mine-layers, this skipper has been sailing openly on the seas and sowing mines right under the eyes of our allies! The accursed power of gold! This skipper, his mate and crew have been selling their very souls to the Hun for a bit of his miserable money!\"  \"They won't do it again, sir!\" uttered Burton, grimly.  \"Mr. Burton, you will remain aboard as prize officer, and take the 'Olga' into the nearest British port and turn her over to the British Admiralty authorities. On receiving competent orders you will rejoin.\"  \"Very good, sir.\"  \"And now we'll hurry above and try to get hold of this ship's papers before any rascal has a chance to destroy them.\"  Boatswain's Mate Runkle had kept the officers and crew of the \"Olga\" under such close guard that they were unable to get at their papers, which were quickly found by Darrin in the cabin to which he had first been invited on boarding the \"Olga.\"  Out on deck, herded forward, were master and mate, seamen, engineers and stokers, a motley-looking outfit of twenty-one men all told.  \"Bring that fellow here,\" Dave directed, coming on deck after having examined the ship's papers and then turning them over to Ensign Burton.  The master, purple-faced and ugly-looking, his eyes cast down, was brought before Darrin.  \"Well, sir,\" announced Dave Darrin, eyeing the man grimly, \"we have seen the cargo you have on board, and we have been able to judge the character of the cargo that you have dropped overboard.\"  The skipper started, but did not make any reply in words.  \"How could you ever bring yourself to commit such villainy?\" Darrin demanded, sternly. \"You are not a German?\"  \"No,\" assented the other, shifting his weight from his right foot to his left.  \"You are a subject of a neutral country.\"  \"Dot is true,\" admitted the skipper.  \"And yet, for hire, you and your men have been engaged in sowing mines, and have taken pay from Germany for your crimes.\"  \"Mines? No! Ve do it not any. Ve never any had,\" declared the skipper.  \"Tell that to an Admiralty court-martial,\" Darrin retorted. \"You will have difficulty in clearing yourself. Fellow, you will find that you and your men will be charged with piracy, for you have been sowing death and destruction in the seas. Indeed, there can be no estimating how many ships you have already helped send to the bottom, no guessing how many lives your infamous work has cost. And you a neutral! Piracy!\"  Skipper, mate and chief engineer turned pale at this significant speech. The rest of the crew looked on in stolid wonder, for they understood no word of English.  \"Vat? You proof it can't!\" quivered the skipper.  \"Wait!\"  Dave gave Ensign Burton an order in an undertone. The ensign hurried to the bridge and almost immediately from the \"Olga's\" whistle a series of sharp blasts struck out on the air.  From the distance came an answering whistle. The \"Olga's\" whistle sounded again, and continued at minute intervals, until the outlines of another craft came up out of the mist and proved to be one of the mine-sweepers.  Dave had already reasoned out the probable course of the neutral country's freighter in the last hour before he had overhauled it. As the mine-sweeper slowly came abreast, Darrin, a megaphone at his lips, shouted an order for the course to be taken by his small helper, and added:  \"Sweep thoroughly, and try to find some mines near by.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  Within fifteen minutes a distant whistle came up from the fog.  \"They've picked up one mine,\" Darrin announced.  Ten minutes later the sweeper's signal whistle was repeated.  \"Two mines,\" he added, and the \"Olga's\" skipper shivered slightly.  Twenty minutes later came a whistle that was barely heard.  \"Three mines,\" clicked Dave, and ordered the recall sounded, to be by direction signals at minute intervals.  \"You make dot noise too much den have us all torpedoed yet,\" protested the \"Olga's\" skipper.  \"If that happens, we have a rescue craft near at hand,\" retorted Darrin, meaning the \"Grigsby,\" though the destroyer was now hidden by the fog. \"That was more than you knew when you planted mines to destroy vessels on the high seas.\"  \"I did noddings do,\" growled the skipper.  In time the mine-sweeper came up into view, again reporting that she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23036"],["title","Dave Darrin After the Mine Layers; Or, Hitting the Enemy a Hard Naval Blow (#4)"],["body","picked up three mines by sweeping broadly over the course that the \"Olga\" was believed to have taken. Then a junior officer from the sweeper came aboard with the measurements of the captured mines. These dimensions were quickly found to correspond with those of the planting device installed in the secret compartment of the \"Olga.\"  \"Which proves, or doesn't prove, that the 'Olga' sowed the mines,\" Dave declared. \"That remains for the court-martial to decide. But the three mines just swept up will be interesting evidence for the court to consider.\"  Learning that the commander of the mine-sweeper would be glad to furnish some members for a prize crew, and to convoy the prize into port, Dave decided to leave Ensign Burton aboard with only three men from the \"Grigsby,\" filling out the prize crew with English sailors. This was accordingly done. Dave's own ship was then signalled and located by whistle, and the launch started on its return.  \"Keep that captured crew under strict guard. Don't give them any chance to recapture their vessel!\" was Dave's last warning to Ensign Burton.  The \"Olga\" quickly faded away in the fog and then the \"Grigsby\" was picked up and boarded.  \"Great work, sir, I'd call it!\" declared Lieutenant Fernald, when he heard the details of what had taken place.  \"The scoundrel, to sail as a neutral, and do such dirty work for the Huns for mere pay!\" uttered Dave, indignantly. \"Fernald, do you know that there were moments when I had to restrain myself to keep from kicking that scoundrel about his own deck?\"  \"I can understand the temptation,\" nodded the executive officer.  \"On second thought, though,\" Darrin continued, \"the skipper is certainly being much worse punished by the suspense of mind in which his present plight places him. He knows that, if convicted, the finding of the court will be 'piracy,' and he knows the punishment for that crime.\"  \"It used to be hanging,\" nodded Fernald. \"It seems almost a pity that this war has introduced the swifter and more merciful punishment of death by shooting.\"  \"And as he looks around at his crew he knows that they must face the same fate with him, and he knows, too, that they know that he has brought the penalty upon them.\"  \"But is it possible that the crew were ignorant, or most of them ignorant, of what he was doing in addition to really carrying wood pulp cargoes?\" asked Fernald.  \"That will be another question for the court-martial to decide,\" Darrin answered. \"It doesn't seem possible that any member of the crew could really be in ignorance of the mine-laying work.\"  A long blast from either the invisible \"Olga\" or the equally invisible mine-sweeper now announced that the prize was proceeding on her way. The \"Grigsby\" did not answer, for on a sea infested by hidden enemies it was not wise to use too many whistle signals.  The \"Grigsby\" now returned to her course and former speed, and again started on her way. Barely ten minutes had passed when from a bow lookout came the sharp hail:  \"'Ware submarine, dead ahead, sir!\"  Sharp eyes, indeed, that had made out the presence of the enemy craft by sighting the slender, almost pencil-like periscope that projected some few feet above the water.  At the instant it was discovered the periscope sank down below the surface.     CHAPTER III  A FIGHT OF THE GOOD OLD KIND   FULL speed ahead! Then ahead she leaped. Ere the destroyer had gained full momentum her bow struck something under the water. Men were thrown from their feet by force of the shock, and the destroyer lurched heavily.  \"Hope we haven't torn our bottom out,\" muttered Darrin as he joined the bow lookouts.  On the water appeared a patch of oil which rapidly broadened. A wooden stool and other floating objects were visible.  \"That looks like a fair score,\" declared the young lieutenant-commander, at which the on-looking seamen grinned broadly.  Over the spot the destroyer again steamed, but nothing passing under her keel was noticed. The sea was clear before her.  It was hours later when Darrin received, in a special code of the British Admiralty, word that the \"Olga\" and her convoy had reached port, and the \"Olga's\" officers and crew had been turned over to the Admiralty officials.  In the meantime Dan Dalzell and the \"Reed,\" as learned by occasional wireless messages, had been separated at no time by more than two miles, though neither craft was visible from the other.  Towards the end of the afternoon the fog began to lift. By nightfall it had disappeared. The stars came out and the crescent moon hung near the western horizon. Both destroyers had again turned north, the two craft having drawn in within half a mile of each other.  Dave, after a two-hour nap, went to the bridge at about two bells--nine o'clock. He had been there some ten minutes, chatting with Ensign Ormsby in low tones, when of a sudden he broke off, listening intently.  \"Sounds like distant firing, sir, two points off the port bow,\" hailed one of the bow lookouts.  In a silence, broken only by the wash of the waters and the jar of the engines, distant rumbling sounds were again heard.  \"That's gun-fire,\" Dave declared. \"Mr. Ormsby, have the signals shown so that word may be conveyed to the 'Reed' to keep with us at full speed.\"  In another moment both destroyers dashed forward with a great roaring of machinery and dense clouds of smoke trailing behind from the four stacks of each.  When some miles had been covered, with the gun-fire sounding with much greater distinctness, Darrin felt that he could judge the distance properly. Turning on a screened light he consulted the chart.  \"It's just about there,\" Darrin declared, placing his finger on a spot on the map. \"Ormsby, I believe that enemy craft are bombarding the little fishing village of Helston. It's an unfortified, small port.\"  \"That's the kind the Huns would prefer,\" returned the ensign, with a savage smile.  \"Ask the chief engineer if a bit more speed is obtainable; then sound the bell in Mr. Fernald's cabin.\"  A knot an hour more was soon forced from the \"Grigsby's\" engines, though at that racing gait it would have been difficult for an amateur observer to have detected the fact that speed had been gained. The \"Reed,\" too, leaped forward.  Minute after minute of breathless racing followed. Presently the flashes of guns could be made out ahead against the darkness of the night. Helston showed no lights, but the sound of bursting shells located the fishing village to those on the bridges of the approaching destroyers.  \"The hounds!\" blazed Dave, indignantly. \"Up to their old and favorite game of killing defenseless people!\"  Long ago the crew had been called to quarters. Everything was in readiness to attack the enemy.  \"Three of them, and all destroyers, judging by the size of the flash of their guns,\" Darrin judged.  Throughout the war it has been a favorite trick of the enemy, when the opportunity offered, to send these swift craft out on night attacks. No other craft on the seas, except Entente destroyers, are capable of pursuing and overtaking German destroyers when they flee.  \"Open fire when we do,\" was the signal flashed to the \"Reed.\"  \"We're ready,\" came back the instant answer.  Two minutes later one of Darrin's forward guns flashed out into the night. From the \"Reed\" there came a similar flash.  \"Let 'em have it, fast and hard!\" ordered Dave.  As the two destroyers sprang forward, firing at full capacity, the three German craft turned and steamed toward them.  \"They outnumber us, and think we'll turn tail!\" exulted Dave. \"They may sink us, but if we do go down at least we'll try to carry our own weight in enemy ships down with us!\"  Though he did not make an unnecessary movement, all of Darrin's calm had vanished. He watched every one of the \"Grigsby's\" shots, his eyes flashing, breath indrawn. When he saw a hit his glance was snapping. Many of the shells, however, splashed in the water only, for now the five engaged craft were circling about each other in a life-and-death struggle.  As they circled and zigzagged the German craft did not offer a very certain mark. Darrin and Dalzell were maneuvering in similar fashion.  \"If we lose, we lose gamely,\" thought Fernald under his breath. \"Was there ever a better or braver commander than Darry? He will ask no odds, but is ever willing to give them!\"  \"Ah!\" The exclamation, half sigh, broke from Dave's lips as he saw the burst of flame and smoke as a shell landed on the superstructure of the leading German destroyer.  Then another shell from the \"Grigsby\" struck the same enemy's mast, smashing the crow's-nest and hurling German seamen, dead or crippled, into the sea.  Three enemy shells landed on the \"Grigsby,\" causing no serious damage. But the fourth hit dismounted one of Darrin's forward guns, killing three men and wounding five. Hardly an instant later another German shell landed on the bridge, reducing some of the metal work to a mass of twisted junk and ripping out part of the deck.  Shell fragments and flying splinters flew on all sides, yet out of this hurricane of destruction emerged Darrin, Fernald and the watch officer, all uninjured.  An instant later Darrin shouted his orders in Fernald's ear, then gained the deck below in a series of leaps.  With one of her forward guns dismounted, the \"Grigsby\" was to that extent out of business. Preferring not to trust to his torpedo tubes, at this juncture Darrin raced aft, just as the destroyer began to execute a swift turn.  And now Dave's craft turned tail and ran for it, the young commander directing personally the service of the after guns as the foremost German destroyer gave chase.  Two more hits were scored by the enemy, with the result that two more of Dave's hardy young seamen were killed and four wounded. Matters were beginning to look decidedly serious.  As for Dan Dalzell, when he saw the \"Grigsby\" turn tail and flee, his heart gave a great bound.  \"Good old Darry didn't do that unless he had to,\""]]]
