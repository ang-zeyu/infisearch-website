In 1708 Walpole, now recognized as an able debater, a clever tactician, and, above all things, an excellent man of business, was appointed Secretary at War.  He became at the same time leader of the House of Commons.  He was one of the managers in the unfortunate impeachment of the empty-headed High-Church preacher, Dr. Sacheverell.  He resigned office with the other Whig ministers in 1710.  Harley coming into power offered him a place in the new administration, which Walpole declined to accept.  The Tories, reckless and ruthless in their majority, expelled Walpole from the House in 1712 and imprisoned him in the Tower.  The charge against him was one of corruption, a charge easily made in those days against any minister, and which, if high moral principles were to prevail, might probably have been as easily sustained as it was made.  Walpole, however, was not worse than his contemporaries; nor, even if he had been, would the contemporaries have been inclined to treat his offences very seriously so long as they were not inspired to act against him by partisan motives.  At the end of the session he was released, and now, in the closing days of Anne's reign, all eyes turned to him as a rising man and a certain bulwark of the new dynasty.  [Sidenote: 1714--The Dean of St. Patrick's]  It would be impossible not to regard Jonathan Swift as one of the politicians, one of the statesmen, of this age.  {35} Swift was a politician in the highest sense, although he had seen little of the one great political arena in which the battles of English parties were fought out.  He has left it on record that he never heard either Bolingbroke or Harley speak in Parliament or anywhere in public.  He was at this time about forty-seven years of age, and had not yet reached his highest point in politics or in literature.  The \"Tale of a Tub\" had been written, but not \"Gulliver's Travels;\" the tract on \"The Conduct of the Allies,\" but not the \"Drapier's Letters.\"  Even at this time he was a power in political life; his was an influence with which statesmen and even sovereigns had to reckon.  No pen ever served a cause better than his had served, and was yet to serve, the interests of the Tory party.  He was probably the greatest English pamphleteer at a time when the pamphlet had to do all the work of the leading article and most of the work of the platform.  His churchmen's gown sat uneasily on him; he was like one of the fighting bishops of the Middle Ages, with whom armor was the more congenial wear.  He had a fierce and domineering temper, and indeed out of his strangely bright blue eyes there was already beginning to shine only too ominously the wild light of that _saeva indignatio_ which the inscription drawn up by his own hand for his tomb described as lacerating his heart.  The ominous light at last broke out into the fire of insanity.  We shall meet Swift again; just now we only stop to note him as a political influence.  At this time he is Dean of St. Patrick's in Ireland; he has been lately in London trying, and without success, to bring about a reconciliation between Bolingbroke and Harley; and, finding his efforts ineffectual, and seeing that troubled times were near at hand, he has quietly withdrawn to Berkshire.  Before leaving London he wrote the letter to Lord Peterborough containing the remarkable words with which we have opened this volume.  It is curious that Swift himself afterwards ascribed to Harley the saying about the Queen's health and the heedless {36} behavior of statesmen.  In his \"Enquiry into the Behaviour of the Queen's Last Ministry,\" dated June, 1715, he tells us that \"about Christmas, 1713,\" the Treasurer said to him \"whenever anything ails the Queen these people are out of their wits; and yet they are so thoughtless that as soon as she is well they act as if she were immortal.\"  To which Swift adds the following significant comment: \"I had sufficient reason, both before and since, to allow his observation to be true, and that some share of it might with justice be applied to himself.\"  It was at the house of a clergyman at Upper Letcomb, near Wantage, in Berkshire, that Swift stayed for some time before returning to his Irish home.  From Letcomb the reader will perhaps note with some painful interest that Swift wrote to Miss Esther Vanhomrigh, whom all generations will know as Vanessa, a letter, in which he describes his somewhat melancholy mode of life just then, tells her \"this is the first syllable I have wrote to anybody since you saw me,\" and adds that \"if this place were ten times worse, nothing shall make me return to town while things are in the situation I left them.\"  [Sidenote: 1714--Addison]  Swift, in his heart, trusted neither Bolingbroke nor Harley.  It seems clear that Lady Masham was under the impression that she had Swift as her accomplice in the intrigue which finally turned Harley out of office.  She writes to him while he is at Letcomb a letter which could not have been written if she were not in that full conviction; and he does not reply until the whole week's crisis is past and a new condition of things arisen; and in the reply he commits himself to nothing.  If he distrusted Bolingbroke he could not help admiring him. Bolingbroke was the only man then near the court whose genius must not have been rebuked by Swift.  But Swift must, for all his lavish praises of Harley, have sometimes secretly despised the hesitating, time-serving statesman, with whom indecision was a substitute for prudence, and to be puzzled was to seem to deliberate.  That Harley should have had the playing of a great political game {37} while Swift could only look on, is one of the anomalies of history which Swift's sardonic humor must have appreciated to the full.  Swift took his revenge when he could by bullying his great official friends now and then in the roughest fashion.  He knew that they feared him, and flattered him because they feared him, and he was glad of it, and hugged himself in the knowledge.  He knew even that at one time they were uncertain of his fidelity, and took much pains by their praises and their promises to keep him close at their side; and this, too, amused him.  He was amused as a tyrant might be at the obvious efforts of those around him to keep him in good-humor, or as a man conscious of incipient madness might find malign delight in the anxiety of his friends to fall in with all his moods and not to cross him in anything he was pleased to say.  Joseph Addison had a political position and influence on the other side of the controversy which entitle him to be ranked among the statesmen of the day.  Only in the year before his tragedy of \"Cato\" had been brought out, and it had created an altogether peculiar sensation.  Each of the two great political parties seized upon the opportunity given by Gate's pompous political virtue, and claimed him as the spokesman of their cause.  The Whigs, of course, had the author's authority to appropriate the applause of Cato, and the Whigs had endeavored to pack the House in order to secure their claim.  But the Tories were equal to the occasion.  They appeared in great numbers, Bolingbroke, then Secretary of State, at their head.  When Cato lamented the extinguished freedom of his country the Whigs were vociferous in their cheers, and glared fiercely at the Tories; but when the austere Roman was made to denounce Caesar and a perpetual dictatorship, the Tories professed to regard this as a denunciation of Marlborough, and his demand to be made commander-in-chief for life, and they gave back the cheering with redoubled vehemence.  At last Bolingbroke's own genius suggested a master-stroke.  He sent for the actor who played Cato's part, thanked him in face of the {38} public, and presented him with a purse of gold because of the service he had done in sustaining the cause of liberty against the tyranny of a perpetual dictator.  Addison held many high political offices.  He was Secretary to a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland more than once; he was made Secretary to the \"Regents,\" as they were called--the commissioners intrusted by George the First with the task of administration previous to his arrival in England.  He sat in Parliament; he was appointed Under-secretary of State, and was soon to be for a while one of the principal Secretaries of State.  The last number of his _Spectator_ was published at the close of 1714.  This was indeed still a time when literary men might hold high political office.  The deadening influence of the Georges had not yet quite prevailed against letters and art.  Matthew Prior, about whose poetry the present age troubles itself but little, sat in Parliament, was employed in many of the most important diplomatic negotiations of the day, and had not long before this time held the office of Plenipotentiary in Paris.  Richard Steele not merely sat in the House of Commons, but was considered of sufficient importance to deserve the distinction of a formal expulsion from the House because of certain political diatribes for which he was held responsible and which the Commons chose to vote libellous.  At the time we are now describing he had re-entered Parliament, and was still a brilliant penman on the side of the Whigs.  His career as politician, literary man, and practical dramatist combined, seems in some sort a foreshadowing of that of Richard Brinsley Sheridan.  Gay was appointed Secretary to Lord Clarendon on a diplomatic mission to Hanover.  Nicholas Rowe, the author of the \"Fair Penitent\" and the translator of Lucan's \"Pharsalia,\" was at one time an Under-Secretary of State.  Rowe's dramatic work is not yet absolutely forgotten by the world.  We still hear of the \"gallant gay Lothario,\" although many of those who are glib with the words do not know that they come from the \"Fair Penitent,\" and would not care even if they did know.     {39}  CHAPTER III.  \"LOST FOR WANT OF SPIRIT.\"  [Sidenote:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23469"],["title","A History of the Four Georges, Volume I (#8)"],["body","4--The Duke of Ormond]  When Bolingbroke found himself in full power he began at once to open the way for some attempt at the restoration of the Stuart dynasty.  He put influential Jacobites into important offices in England and Scotland; he made the Duke of Ormond Warden of the Cinque Ports, that authority covering exactly the stretch of coast at some point of which it might be expected that James Stuart would land if he were to make an attempt for the crown at all.  Ormond was a weak and vain man, but he was a man of personal integrity.  He had been sent out to Flanders to succeed the greatest commander of the age as captain-general of the allied armies there, and he had naturally played a poor and even ridiculous part.  The Jacobites in England still, however, held him in much honor, identified his name, no one exactly knew why, with the cause of High-Church, and elected him the hero and the leader of the movement for the restoration of the exiled family.  Bolingbroke committed Scotland to the care of the Earl of Mar, a Jacobite, a personal friend of James Stuart, and a votary of High-Church.  It can hardly be supposed that in making such an appointment Bolingbroke had not in his mind the possibility of a rising of the Highland clans against the Hanoverian succession.  But it is none the less evident that Bolingbroke was as usual thinking far more of himself than of his party, and that his preparations were made not so much with a view to restoring the Stuarts as with the object of securing himself against any chance that might befall.  {40}  Had Bolingbroke been resolved in his heart to bring back the Stuarts, had he been ready, as many other men were, to risk all in that cause, to stand or fall by it, he might, so far as one can see, have been successful.  It is not too much to say that on the whole the majority of the English people were in favor of the Stuarts.  Certainly the majority would have preferred a Stuart to the dreaded and disliked German prince from Herrenhausen.  For many years the birthday of the Stuart prince had been celebrated as openly and as enthusiastically in English cities as if it were the birthday of the reigning sovereign.  James's adherents were everywhere--in the court, in the camp, on the bench, in Parliament, in the drawing-rooms, the coffee-houses, and the streets.  Bolingbroke had only to present him at a critical moment, and say \"Here is your king,\" and James Stuart would have been king.  Such a crisis came in France in our own days.  There was a moment, after the fall of the Second Empire, when the Count de Chambord had only to present himself in Versailles in order to be accepted as King of France, not King of the French.  But the Count de Chambord put away his chance deliberately; he would not consent to give up the white flag of legitimacy and accept the tricolor.  He acted on principle, knowing the forfeit of his decision.  The chances of James Stuart were frittered away in half-heartedness, insincerity, and folly.  While Bolingbroke and his confederates were caballing and counselling, and paltering and drinking, the Whig statesmen were maturing their plans, and when the moment came for action it found them ready to act.  [Sidenote: 1714--The Council at Kensington]  The success was accomplished by a _coupe d'état_ on Friday, July 30, 1714.  The Queen was suddenly stricken with apoplexy.  A Privy Council was to meet that morning at Kensington Palace.  The Privy Council meeting was composed then, according to the principle which prevails still, only of such councillors as had received a special summons.  In truth, the meeting of the Privy Council {41} in Anne's time was like a Cabinet meeting of our days, and was intended by those who convened it to be just as strictly composed of official members.  But, on the other hand, there was no law or rule forbidding any member of the Privy Council, whether summoned or not, to present himself at the meeting.  Bolingbroke was in his place, and so was the Duke of Ormond, and so were other Jacobite peers.  The Duke of Shrewsbury had taken his seat, as he was entitled to do, being one of the highest officers of State.  Shrewsbury was known to be a loyal adherent of the Act of Settlement and the Hanoverian Succession.  He was a remarkable man with a remarkable history.  His father was the unfortunate Shrewsbury who was killed in a duel by the Duke of Buckingham.  The duel arose out of the duke's open intrigue with the Countess of Shrewsbury, and the story went at the time that the lady herself, dressed as a page, held her lover's horse while he fought with and killed her husband.  Charles Talbot, the son, was brought up a Catholic, but in his twentieth year accepted the arguments of Tillotson and became a Protestant.  He was Lord Chamberlain to James the Second, but lost all faith in James, and went over to Holland to assist William of Nassau with counsel and with money.  When William became King of England he made Lord Shrewsbury a Privy Councillor and Secretary of State, created him first marquis and afterwards duke, and called him, in tribute to his great popularity, the King of Hearts.  He was for a short time British Ambassador at the Court of France, and then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.  He had flickered a little between the Whigs and the Tories at different periods of his career, and in 1710 he actually joined the Tory party.  But it was well known to every one that if any question should arise between the House of Hanover and the Stuarts, he would stand firmly by the appointed succession.  He was a man of undoubted integrity and great political sagacity; he had a handsome face, although he had lost one of his eyes by an accident when riding, and {42} he had a stately presence.  His gifts and graces were said to have so much attracted the admiration of Queen Mary that if she had outlived the King she would probably have married Shrewsbury.  The condition of the political world around him had impressed him with so little reverence for courts and cabinets, that he used to say if he had a son he would rather bring him up a cobbler than a courtier, and a hangman than a statesman. Bolingbroke once kindly said of him, \"I never knew a man so formed to please, and to gain upon the affections while challenging the esteem.\"  [Sidenote: 1714--The Dukes of Somerset and Argyll]  Before there was time to get to any of the business of the council the doors were opened, and the Duke of Argyll and the Duke of Somerset entered the room.  The Duke of Argyll, soldier, statesman, orator, shrewd self-seeker, represented the Whigs of Scotland; the honest, proud, pompous Duke of Somerset those of England.  The two intruders, as they were assuredly regarded by the majority of those present, announced that they had heard the news of the Queen's danger, and that they felt themselves bound to hasten to the meeting of the council, although not summoned thither, in order that they might be able to afford advice and assistance.  The Duke of Somerset was in many respects the most powerful nobleman in England.  But all his rank, his dignity, and his influence, could not protect him against the ridicule and contempt which his feeble character, his extravagant pride, and his grotesquely haughty demeanor, invariably brought upon him.  He was probably the most ridiculous man of his time; he had the pomp of an Eastern pasha without the grave dignity which Eastern manners confer.  He was like the pasha of a burlesque or an _opéra bouffe_.  His servants had to obey him by signs; he disdained to give orders by voice.  His first wife was Elizabeth Percy, the virgin widow of Lord Ogle and Tom Thynne of Longleat, the beloved of Charles John Königsmark, the \"Carrots\" of Dean Swift.  While she was Duchess of Somerset and Queen Anne's close friend, Swift, who {43} hated her, hinted pretty broadly that she was privy to Königsmark's plot to murder Tom Thynne, and the Duchess revenged herself by keeping the Dean out of the bishopric of Hereford.  When she died, Somerset married Lady Charlotte Finch, one of the \"Black Funereal Finches,\" celebrated by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams.  Once, when she tapped him on the shoulder with a fan, he rebuked her angrily: \"My first wife was a Percy, and she never took such a liberty.\"  When he had occasion to travel, all the roads on or near which he had to pass were scoured by a vanguard of outriders, whose business it was to protect him, not merely from obstruction and delay, but from the gaze of the vulgar herd who might be anxious to feast their eyes upon his gracious person.  The statesmen of his own time, while they made use of him, seem to have vied with each other in protestations of their contempt for his abilities and his character.  Swift declared that Somerset had not \"a grain of sense of any kind.\"  Marlborough several times professed an utter contempt for Somerset's abilities or discretion, and was indignant at the idea that he ever could have made use of such a man in any work requiring confidence or judgment.  Yet Somerset, ridiculous as he was, came to be a personage of importance in the crisis now impending over England.  He was, at all events, a man whose word could be trusted, and who, when he promised to take a certain course, would be sure to follow it.  That very pride which made him habitually ridiculous raised him on great occasions above any suspicion of mercenary or personal views in politics.  One of his contemporaries describes him as \"so humorsome, proud, and capricious, that he was rather a ministry spoiler than a ministry maker.\"  In the present condition of things, however, he could be made use of for the purpose of making one ministry after spoiling another.  When he carried his great personal influence over to the side of the Hanoverian accession, and joined with Argyll and with Shrewsbury, it must have been evident, to men like Bolingbroke at least, that the enterprises of the Jacobites {44} would"]]]
