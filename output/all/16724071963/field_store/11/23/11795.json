Day after day Isaac Dorkin grew worse: he soon became delirious, and, strong though he was, John Potter was scarcely able to hold him down in bed.  When the delirium first came on, John chanced to be in the lantern just commencing to light up.  When he was about to apply the light, he heard a noise behind him, and, turning hastily round, beheld the flushed face and blazing eyes of his mate rising through the trap door that communicated with the rooms below.  Leaving his work, John hastened to his friend, and with some difficulty persuaded him to return to his bed; but no sooner had he got him into it and covered him up, than a new paroxysm came on, and the sick man arose in the strength of his agony and hurled his friend to the other side of the apartment.  John sprang up, and grappled with him while he was rushing towards the door.  It was an awful struggle that ensued.  Both were large and powerful men; the one strong in a resolute purpose to meet boldly a desperate case, the other mad with fever.  They swayed to and fro, and fell on and smashed the homely furniture of the place; sometimes the one and sometimes the other prevailing, while both gasped for breath and panted vehemently; suddenly Dorkin sank down exhausted.  He appeared to collapse, and John lifted him with difficulty again into his bed; but in a few seconds he attempted to renew the struggle, while the whole building was filled with his terrific cries.  While this was going on, the shades of night had been falling fast, and John Potter remembered that none of the candles had been lit, and that in a few minutes more the rock would be a source of greater danger to shipping than if no lighthouse had been there, because vessels would be making for the light from all quarters of the world, in the full faith of its being kept up!  Filled with horror at the thought that perhaps even at that moment vessels might be hurrying on to their doom, he seized a piece of rope that lay at hand, and managed to wind it so firmly round his mate as to render him helpless.  Bounding back to the lantern, he quickly lighted it up, but did not feel his heart relieved until he had gazed out at the snowy billows below, and made sure that no vessel was in view.  Then he took a long draught of water, wiped his brow, and returned to his friend.  Two days after that Isaac Dorkin died.  And now John Potter found himself in a more horrible situation than before.  The storm continued: no sooner did one gale abate than another broke out, so as to render approach to the rock impossible; while, day after day, and night after night, the keeper had to pass the dead body of his mate several times in attending to the duties of the lantern.  And still the signal of distress continued to fly from the lighthouse, and still the people on shore continued to wonder what was wrong, to long for moderate weather, and to feel relief when they saw the faithful light beam forth each evening at sunset.  At last the corpse began to decay, and John felt that it was necessary to get rid of it, but he dared not venture to throw it into the sea.  It was well known that Dorkin had been a quarrelsome man, and he feared that if he could not produce the body when the relief came, he might be deemed a _murderer_.  He therefore let it lie until it became so overpoweringly offensive that the whole building, from foundation to cupola, was filled with the horrible stench.  The feelings of the solitary man can neither be conceived nor described.  Well was it for John that he had the Word of God in his hand, and the grace of God in his heart during that awful period.  For nearly a month his agony lasted.  At last the weather moderated. The boat came off; the \"relief\" was effected; and poor Dorkin's body, which was in such a condition that it could not be carried on shore, was thrown into the sea.  Then John Potter returned home, and left the lighthouse service for ever.  From that time forward it has been the custom to station not fewer than three men at a time on all out-lying lighthouses of the kingdom.  Note.  Reader, we have not drawn here on our imagination.  This story is founded on unquestionable fact.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE END OF RUDYERD'S LIGHTHOUSE.  Thirty-Four years passed away, and still Rudyerd's lighthouse stood firm as the rock on which it was founded.  True, during that period it had to undergo occasional repairs, because the timber uprights at the base, where exposed to the full violence of the waves, had become weather-worn, and required renewing in part; but this was only equivalent to a ship being overhauled and having some of her planks renewed.  The main fabric of the lighthouse remained as sound and steadfast at the end of that long period as it was at the beginning, and it would in all probability have remained on the Eddystone Rock till the present day, had not a foe assailed it, whose nature was very different indeed from that with which it had been built to contend.  The lighthouse was at this time in charge of Teddy Maroon: not the Teddy who had bewailed his fate so disconsolately in the French prison in days gone by, but his youngest son, who was now getting to be an elderly man. We may, however, relieve the mind of the sympathetic reader, by saying that Teddy, senior, was not dead.  He was still alive and hearty; though bent nearly double with extreme age; and dwelt on the borders of one of the Irish bogs, at the head of an extensive colony of Maroons.  One night Teddy the younger ascended to the lantern to trim the candles; he snuffed them all round and returned to the kitchen to have a pipe, his two mates being a-bed at the time.  No one now knows how the thing happened, but certain it is that Teddy either dropped some of the burning snuff on the floor, or in some other way introduced more light into his lantern that night than it had ever been meant to contain, so that while he and his mates were smoking comfortably below, the lighthouse was smoking quietly, but ominously, above.  On shore, late that night, an elderly gentleman stood looking out of the window of a charmingly situated cottage in the village of Cawsand Bay, near Plymouth, which commanded a magnificent prospect of the channel.  \"Father,\" he said, turning to a very old man seated beside the fire, who, although shrunken and wrinkled and bald, was ruddy in complexion, and evidently in the enjoyment of a green old age, \"Father, the lighthouse is beautifully bright to-night; shall I help you to the window to look at it?\"  \"Yes, Tommy: I'm fond o' the old light.  It minds me of days gone by, when you and I were young, Martha.\"  The old man gave a chuckle as he looked across the hearthstone, where, in a chair similar to his own, sat a very stout and very deaf and very old lady, smoothing the head of her grandchild, a little girl, who was the youngest of a family of ten.  Old Martha did not hear John Potter's remark, but she saw his kindly smile, and nodded her head with much gravity in reply.  Martha had grown intellectually slow when she partially lost her hearing, and although she was not sad she had evidently become solemn.  An English Dictionary and the Bible were the only books that Martha would look at now.  She did not use the former as a help to the understanding of the latter.  No one knew why she was so partial to the dictionary; but as she not unfrequently had it on her knee upside down while poring over it, her grandchild, little Nora, took up the idea that she had resolved to devote the latter days of her life to learning to read backwards! Perhaps the fact that the dictionary had once belonged to her son James who was wrecked and drowned on the Norfolk coast, may have had something to do with it.  With the aid of his son's arm and a stick old John managed to hobble to the window.  \"It is very bright.  Why, Tommy,\" he exclaimed, with a start, \"it's too bright: the lighthouse must be on fire!\"  At that moment, \"Tommy's\" wife, now \"fat, fair, and _fifty_\" (or thereabouts), entered the room hurriedly, exclaiming, \"Oh, Tom, what _can_ be the matter with the lighthouse, I never saw it so bright before?\"  Tom, who had hastily placed his father in a chair, so that he could see the Eddystone, seized his hat, and exclaiming, \"I'll go and see, my dear,\" ran out and proceeded to the shore.  \"What's the matter?\" cried Mrs Potter in a querulous voice, when little Nora rushed from her side.  Nora, senior, went to her at once, and, bending down, said, in a musical voice that retained much of its clearness and all its former sweetness: \"I fear that the lighthouse is on fire, grandma!\"  Mrs Potter gazed straight before her with vacant solemnity, and Nora, supposing that she had not heard, repeated the information.  Still Mrs Potter made no reply; but, after a few moments, she turned her eyes on her daughter-in-law with owlish gravity, and said; \"I knew it!  I said long ago to your father, my dear, I had a settled conviction that that lighthouse would come to a bad end.\"  It did indeed appear as though old Martha's prophecy were about to come true!  Out at the lighthouse Teddy Maroon, having finished his pipe, went up to the lantern to trim the candles again.  He had no sooner opened the hatch of the lantern than a dense cloud of smoke burst out.  He shouted to his comrades, one of whom, Henry Hall, was old and not fit for much violent exertion; the other, James Wilkie, was a young man, but a heavy sleeper.  They could not be roused as quickly as the occasion demanded. Teddy ran to the store-room for a leathern bucket, but before he could descend to the rock, fill it and re-ascend, the flames had got a firm hold of the cupola.  He dashed the water into the lantern just as his horrified"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23272"],["title","The Story of the Rock (#8)"],["body","appeared.  \"Fetch bucketfulls as fast as ye can.  Och, be smart, boys, if iver ye was,\" he shouted, while perspiration streamed down his face.  Pulling off his coat, while his mates ran down for water, Teddy dashed wildly into the lantern, and, holding the coat by its arms, laid about him violently, but smoke and fire drove him but almost immediately.  The buckets were long of coming, and when they did arrive, their contents were as nothing on the glowing cupola.  Then Teddy went out on the balcony and endeavoured to throw the water up, but the height was too great.  While he was doing this, Wilkie ran down for more water, but Hall stood gazing upwards, open-mouthed with horror, at the raging flames.  At that moment the leaden covering of the roof melted, and rushed down on Hall's head and shoulders.  He fell, with a loud shriek. While Teddy tried to drag him down to the room below, he exclaimed that some of the melted lead had gone down his throat!  He was terribly burned about the neck, but his comrades had to leave him in his bed while they strove wildly to check the flames.  It was all in vain.  The wood-work around the lantern, from years of exposure to the heat of twenty-four large candles burning at once, had become like tinder, and the fire became so fierce that the timber courses composing the top of the column soon caught.  Then the keepers saw that any further efforts would be useless.  The great exertions made to carry up even a few bucketsfull of water soon exhausted their strength, and they were driven from room to room as the fire descended.  At last the heat and smoke became so intense that they were driven out of the lighthouse altogether, and sought shelter in a cavern or hollow under the ladder, on the east side of the rock.  Fortunately it was low water at the time, and the weather was calm.  Had it been otherwise, the rock would have been no place of refuge.  Meanwhile Mr Thomas Potter (our old friend Tommy--now, as we have said an elderly gentleman) went off in a large boat with a crew of stout fishermen from Cawsand Bay, having a smaller boat in tow.  When they reached the rock, a terrific spectacle was witnessed.  The lighthouse was enveloped in flames nearly to the bottom, for the outside planking, being caulked and covered with pitch, was very inflammable.  The top glowed against the dark sky and looked in the midst of the smoke like a fiery meteor.  The Eddystone Rock was suffused with a dull red light, as if it were becoming red hot, and the surf round it appeared to hiss against the fire, while in the dark shadow of the cave the three lighthouse keepers were seen cowering in terror,--as they well might, seeing that melted lead and flaming masses of wood and other substances were falling thickly round them.  To get them out of their dangerous position was a matter of extreme difficulty, because, although there was little or no wind, the swell caused a surf on the rock which absolutely forbade the attempt to land. In this emergency they fell upon a plan which seemed to afford some hope of success.  They anchored the large boat to the westward, and veered down towards the rock as far as they dared venture.  Then three men went into the small boat, which was eased off and sent farther in by means of a rope.  When as near as it was possible to approach, a coil of rope was thrown to the rock.  It was caught by Teddy Maroon, and although in extreme danger and anxiety, the men in the boat could not help giving vent to a ringing cheer.  Teddy at once tied the end of the rope round the waist of old Henry Hall, and half persuaded, half forced him into the surf, through which he was hauled into the boat in safety.  Wilkie went next, and Teddy followed.  Thus they were rescued, put on board the large boat, and carried on shore; but no sooner did the keel grate on the sand, than Wilkie, who had never spoken a word, and who appeared half stupefied, bounded on shore and ran off at full speed.  It is a curious fact, which no one has ever been able to account for, that this man was never more heard of!  As it is quite certain that he did not cause the fire, and also that he did his utmost to subdue it, the only conclusion that could be come to was, that the excitement and terror had driven him mad.  At all events that was the last of him.  Another curious fact connected with the fire is, that Henry Hall actually did swallow a quantity of melted lead.  He lingered for twelve days after the accident, and then died.  Afterwards his body was opened, and an oval lump of lead, which weighed upwards of seven ounces, was found in his stomach.  This extraordinary fact is authenticated by the credible testimony of a respectable medical man and several eye-witnesses.  Meanwhile, the lighthouse continued to burn, despite the most strenuous efforts made to save it.  Had a storm arisen, the seas would speedily have quenched the fire, but unfortunately the weather continued fine and comparatively calm for several days, while the wind was just strong enough to fan the fury of the flames, and at the same time to cause a surf sufficiently high to render a landing on the rock impossible.  But, indeed, even if this had been effected, the efforts that could have been made with the small fire-engines at that time in use, would have been utterly useless.  The fire gradually descended to the different courses of solid timber, the well-hole of the staircase assisting the draught, and the outside timbers and inside mast, or wooden core, forming a double connecting link whereby the devouring element was carried to the very bottom of the building, with a heat so intense that the courses of Cornish moor-stone were made red hot.  Admiral West, with part of the fleet, happened to be at that time in Plymouth Sound.  He at once sent a sloop with a fire-engine to the rock. They attempted to land in a boat, but could not.  So violent was the surf, that the boat was at one time thrown bodily upon the rock by one wave and swept off again by the next.  The escape on this occasion was almost miraculous, the men therefore did not venture to make another attempt, but contented themselves with endeavouring to work the engine from the boat, in doing which they broke it, and thus all hope of doing anything further was gone.  But indeed the engine they had would have availed nothing, even though it had been twice as powerful, against such a mighty conflagration.  As well might they have tried to extinguish Vesuvius with a tea-kettle!  For four days and nights did that massive pillar of fire burn.  At last it fell in ruins before the most irresistible element with which man or matter has to contend, after having braved the fury of the winds and waves for nearly half a century.  Thus perished the second lighthouse that was built on the Eddystone Rock, in December of the year 1755, and thus, once again, were those black reefs left unguarded.  Once more that dread of mariners, ancient and modern, became a trap on the south coast of England--a trap now rendered doubly dangerous by the fact that, for so long a period, ships had been accustomed to make for it instead of avoiding it, in the full expectation of receiving timely warning from its friendly light.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  OLD FRIENDS IN NEW CIRCUMSTANCES.  We open the story of the third, and still existing, lighthouse on the Eddystone with the re-introduction of Teddy Maroon--that Teddy who acted so prominent a part at the burning of Rudyerd's tower in December 1755.  Men's activities seem to have been quickened at this period of time, for only about six months were allowed to elapse between the destruction of the old and the commencement of operations for the new lighthouse.  It was a calm evening in the autumn 1756 when Teddy Maroon, smoking a little black pipe, sauntered towards the residence of old John Potter. On reaching the door he extinguished the little pipe by the summary process of thrusting the point of his blunt forefinger into the bowl, and deposited it hot in his vest pocket.  His tap was answered by a small servant girl, with a very red and ragged head of hair, who ushered him into the presence of the aged couple.  They were seated in the two chairs--one on each side of the fireplace--which they might almost be said to inhabit.  Little Nora was stirring a few embers of coal into a cheery flame, for she knew the old people loved the sight of the fire even in summer.  On a chair beside old Martha lay the open Bible, from which Nora had been reading, and on old Martha's knee was the valued dictionary, upside down as usual.  \"Glad to see you, lad,\" said old John, with a pleasant smile as he extended his hand; \"it does us good to see you; it minds us so of old times.\"  \"Ah, then, I've got to tell 'ee what'll mind you more of owld times than the mere sight o' me face,\" said Teddy, as he patted old Martha on the shoulder and sat down beside her.  \"How are 'ee, owld ooman?\"  \"Ay,\" replied Martha in a tremulous voice, \"you're uncommon like your father--as like as two peas.\"  \"Faix, av ye saw the dear owld gintleman now,\" said Teddy with a laugh, \"ye'd think there was a difference.  Hows'ever, its o' no use repaitin' me question, for any man could see that you're in the best o' health-- you're bloomin' like a cabbage rose.\"  The latter part of this complimentary speech was shouted into old Martha's ear, and she responded by shaking her head and desiring the flatterer to \"go along.\"  \"Well, John,\" said the visitor, turning to his father's old friend, \"you'll be glad to hear that I've been engaged to work at the new lighthouse, an', moreover we've got fairly begun.\"  \"You _don't_ say so,\" cried John Potter, with some of the old fire sparkling in his eyes; \"well, now, that is pleasant noos.  Why, it makes me a'most wish to be young again.  Of course I heard that they've bin hard at the preparations for a good while; but few people comes to see me now; they think I'm too old to be"]]]
