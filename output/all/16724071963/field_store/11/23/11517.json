There is a bath-house in Juneau and a barber-shop. They did a big business on our arrival. There are many billiard halls, where prohibited drinks are more or less surreptitiously obtained. A dance-hall stands uninvitingly open to the street. At the doorway, as we passed it, was posted a hand-lettered placard announcing that the ladies of Juneau would on the evening in question give a grand ball in honor of the passengers of the _Ancon_. Tickets, 50 cents.  It began to drizzle. We dodged under the narrow awnings of the shops, and bargained blindly in the most unmusical lingos. Within were to be had stores of toy canoes--graceful little things hewn after the Haida model, with prows and sides painted in strange hieroglyphics; paddles were there--life-size, so to speak,--gorgeously dyed, and just the things for hall decorations; also dishes of carved wood of quaint pattern, and some of them quite ancient, were to be had at very moderate prices; pipes and pipe-bowls of the weirdest description; halibut fish-hooks, looking like anything at all but fish-hooks; Shaman rattles, grotesque in design; Thlinket baskets, beautifully plaited and stained with subdued dyes--the most popular of souvenirs; spoons with bone bowls and handles carved from the horns of the mountain goat or musk-ox; even the big horn-spoon itself was no doubt made by these ingenious people; Indian masks of wood, inlaid with abalone shells, bears' teeth, or lucky stones from the head of the catfish; Indian wampum; deer-skin sacks filled with the smooth, pencil-shaped sticks with which the native sport passes the merry hours away in games of chance; bangles without end, and rings of the clumsiest description hammered out of silver coin; bows and arrows; doll papooses, totem poles in miniature. There were garments made of fish-skins and bird-skins, smelling of oil and semi-transparent, as if saturated with it; and half-musical instruments, or implements, made of twigs strung full of the beaks of birds that clattered with a weird, unearthly Alaskan clatter.  There were little graven images, a few of them looking somewhat idolatrous; and heaps upon heaps of nameless and shapeless odds and ends that boasted more or less bead-work in the line of ornamentation; but all chiefly noticeable for the lack of taste displayed, both in design and the combination of color. The Chilkat blanket is an exception to the Alaskan Indian rule. It is a handsome bit of embroidery, of significant though mysterious design; rich in color, and with a deep, knotted fringe on the lower edge--just the thing for a lambrequin, and to be had in Juneau for $40, which is only $15 more than is asked for the same article in Portland, Oregon, as some of us discovered to our cost. There were quantities of skins miserably cured, impregnating the air with vilest odors; and these were waved at you and wafted after you at every step. In the forest which suddenly terminates at the edge of the town there is game worth hunting. The whistler, reindeer, mountain sheep and goat, ermine, musk-rat, marmet, wolf and bear, are tracked and trapped by the red-man; but I doubt if the foot of the white-man is likely to venture far into the almost impenetrable confusion of logs and brush that is the distinguishing feature of the Alaskan wilderness. Beautiful antlers are to be had in Juneau and elsewhere; and perhaps a cinnamon or a black cub as playful as a puppy, and full of a kind of half-savage fun.  In the upper part of the town, where the stumps and brush are thickest, there are cosy little log-cabins, and garden patches that seem to be making the most of the summer sunshine. In the window of one of these cabins we saw a face--dusky, beautiful, sensitive. Dreamy eyes slumbered under fringes that might have won a song from a Persian poet; admirably proportioned features, delicious lips, almost persuaded us that a squaw-man might in some cases be excusable for his infatuation. Later we discovered that the one beauty of Alaska was of Hawaiian parentage; that she was married, and was as shy of intruders as a caged bird. Very dissimilar are the ladies of Juneau.  In the evening the town-crier went to and fro announcing the opening of the ball. It was still drizzling; the cliffs that tower above the metropolis were capped with cloud; slender, rain-born rivulets plunged from these airy heights into space and were blown away like smoke. Sometimes we caught glimpses of white, moving objects, far aloft against the black wall of rock: these were mountain sheep.  The cannonading at Douglas Island continued--muffled thunder that ceases neither night nor day. Nobody seemed to think of sleeping. The dock was swarming with Indians; you would have known it with your eyes shut, from the musky odor that permeated every quarter of the ship. The deck was filled with passengers, chatting, reading, smoking, looking off upon the queer little town and wondering what its future was likely to be. And so, we might have lingered on indefinitely, with the light of a dull day above us--a light that was to grow no less till dawn, for there is no night there,--were it not that some one looked at his watch, and lo! it was the midnight hour.  Then we went to the ball given by the ladies of Juneau in our honor. Half a dozen young Indian maidens sat on a bench against the wall and munched peanuts while they smiled; a few straggling settlers gathered at the bar while they smiled; two fiddlers and a guitar made as merry as they could under the circumstances in an alcove at the top of the hall. Round dances were in vogue,--round dances interspersed with flirtations and fire-water; round dances that grew oblong and irregular before sunrise--and yet it was sunrise at the unearthly hour of 3.30 a. m., or thereabout. We all felt as if we had been cheated out of something when we saw his coming; but perhaps it was only the summer siesta that had been cut short,--the summer siesta that here passes for the more wholesome and old-fashioned sleep of the world lower down on the map.  During the night, having discharged freight and exhausted the resources of Juneau, including a post-office, and a post-mistress who sorts the mail twice a month, we steamed back to Douglas Island, and dropped many fathoms of noisy chain into the deep abreast of the camp. The eve of the Fourth in the United States of America is nothing in comparison with the everlasting racket at this wonderful mine. The iron jaws of the 120-stamp mill grind incessantly, spitting pulverized rock and ore into the vats that quake under the mastication of the mighty molars; cars slip down into the bowels of the earth, and emerge laden with precious freight; multitudinous miners relieve one another, watch and watch. Electric light banishes even a thought of dusk; and were it now winter--the long, dark, dreary winter of the North, with but half a dozen hours of legitimate daylight out of the four and twenty--the work at Douglas Island would go on triumphantly; and it will go forever--or, rather, until the bottom drops out of the mine, just as it drops out of everything in this life. All night long the terrible rattle and rumble and roar of the explosive agent robbed us of our rest. I could think of nothing but the gnomes of the German fairy tale; the dwarfs of the black mountain, with their glowworm lamps, darting in and out of the tunnels in the earth like moles, and heaping together the riches that are the cause of so much pleasure and pain, and envy and despair, and sorrow and sin, and too often death.     CHAPTER IX.  By Solitary Shores.   Probably no one leaves Juneau with regret. Far more enjoyable was the day we spent in Ward's Cove, land-locked, wooded to the water's edge, and with forty-five fathoms of water of the richest sea-green hue. Here lay the _Pinta_ and the _Paterson_, two characteristic representatives of the United States Navy--as it was before the war--the former a promoted tug-boat, equipped at an expense of $100,000, and now looking top-heavy and unseaworthy, but just the thing for a _matinée_ performance of Pinafore, if that were not out of date.  This _Pinta_, terrible as a canal-boat, armed to the teeth, drew up under our quarter to take in coal. You see the _Ancon_ combined business with pleasure, and distributed coal in quantities to suit throughout the Alaskan lagoon. Now, there is not much fun in coaling, even when a craft as funny as the _Pinta_ is snuggling up under your quarter, looking more like the Pinafore than ever, with her skylarking sailors, midshipmite and all; so Captain Carroll secured a jaunty little steam-launch, and away we went on a picnic in the forest primeval. The launch was laden to the brim; three of our biggest boats were in tow; an abundant collation, in charge of a corps of cabin-boys, gave assurance of success in one line at least.  We explored. Old Vancouver did the same thing long ago, and no doubt found these shores exactly as we find them to-day. We entered a shallow creek at the top of the cove; landed on a dreary point redolent of stale fish, and the beach literally alive and creeping with small worms above half an inch in length. A solitary squaw was splitting salmon for drying. She remained absorbed in her work while we gathered about and regarded her with impudent curiosity. Overcome by the fetid air of the place, we re-embarked and steamed gaily miles away over the sparkling sea.  In an undiscovered country--so it seemed to us--we came to a smooth and sandy strip of shore and landed there. But a few paces from the lightly-breaking ripples was the forest--and such a forest! There were huge trees, looking centuries old, swathed in blankets of moss, and the moss gray with age. Impenetrable depths of shadow overhead, impenetrable depths of litter under foot. Log had fallen upon log crosswise and at every conceivable angle.

THE OATH OF DEL NORTE.   Rain had ceased to fall, but the night was intensely dark, with a raw, cold wind that penetrated to one's very bones.  Shortly after nightfall three men crossed the east branch of the Ausable River and entered the little settlement of Keene.  Of the three only one was mounted, and he sat swaying in the saddle, seeming to retain his position with great difficulty.  The two men on foot walked on either side of the horse, helping to support the mounted man. At intervals they encouraged him with words.  A few lights gleamed from the windows of Keene. Before a cottage door the trio halted, and one of the men on foot knocked on the door.  A few moments later a man appeared with a lighted lamp in his right hand, shading his eyes with his left as he peered out into the darkness.  \"Who are you?\" he gruffly asked, \"and what do you want?\"  \"We want a surgeon or a doctor as soon as we can find one,\" answered the man at the door. \"One of our party has been wounded by accident, and we wish to have his wound dressed.\"  \"Another city sportsman shot for a deer, eh?\" said the man in the doorway, with a touch of scorn in his voice. \"It's the same old story.\"  \"Yes, the same old story,\" acknowledged the man at the door. \"He may die from the wound if we do not find a doctor very soon.\"  \"There's no doctor nearer than Elizabethtown.\"  \"Is there none in this place?\"  \"No.\"  \"How far is Elizabethtown?\"  \"Twenty-five miles.\"  \"How is the road?\"  \"It might be worse--or it might be better. You can't follow it to-night.\"  \"We must. This is a case of life or death. See here, my friend, if you will help us out we will make it worth your while. We will pay you well. Have you any whisky in the house?\"  \"Mebbe so.\"  \"It's worth five dollars a quart to us, and we will take a quart or more.\"  \"I reckon I can find a quart for you,\" was the instant answer.  \"If you will secure two horses and a guide to take us over the road to Elizabethtown to-night we will pay you a hundred dollars.\"  This offer interested the man with the lamp.  \"Bring your friend in here,\" he said, \"and I will see what I can do for you. Perhaps I can get the horses, and if I can----\"  \"Do you know the road?\"  \"I have been over it enough to know it, but it will be no easy traveling to-night. Better take my advice and stay here until morning.\"  The man outside, however, would not listen to this, but insisted that the journey to Elizabethtown must be made that night. He returned to his companions, and the mounted man was assisted to descend from the saddle. One of them held his arm while he walked into the house, and the other took care of the horse.  The lamp showed that the injured one had bloody bandages wrapped about his head. He was pale and haggard, and there was an expression of anxiety in his dark eyes. At times he pulled nervously at his small, dark mustache.  \"Bring that whisky at once,\" said the wounded man's companion, as he assisted the other to a chair. \"He needs a nip of it, and needs it bad.\"  The whisky was brought, and the injured man drank from the bottle. As he lifted it to his lips, he murmured:  \"May the fiends take the dog who fired that bullet! May he burn forever in the fires below!\"  The liquor seemed to revive him somewhat, and he straightened up a little, joining his companion in urging the man who had procured the whisky to secure horses and guide them, over the road to Elizabethtown.  \"We have money enough,\" he said, fumbling weakly in his pockets and producing a roll of bills. \"We will pay you every cent agreed upon. Why don't you hasten? Do you wish to see me die here in your wretched hut?\"  The man addressed promised to lose no time, and soon hurried out into the night. He was not gone more than thirty minutes. Those waiting his return heard hoofbeats, and the light shining from the open door of the cabin fell on three horses as they stepped outside.  \"It's fifty in advance and fifty when we reach Elizabethtown,\" he said, as he sprang off. \"I will not start till the first fifty is paid.\"  \"Pay him the whole of it,\" said the wounded man, \"and shoot him full of lead if he fails to keep his part of the bargain.\"  Stimulated by the whisky, this man had revived wonderfully, and soon the four rode out of Keene on the road that followed the river southward.  Through the long hours of that black night the guide led them on their journey. The road was indeed a wretched one, winding through deep forests, over rocky hills and traversing gloomy valleys. As the night advanced it grew colder until their teeth chattered and their blood seemed stagnating in their veins. Many times they paused to give the wounded one a drink from the bottle. Often this man was heard cursing in Spanish and declaring that the distance was nearer a hundred miles than twenty-five.  Morning was at hand when, exhausted and wretched, they entered Elizabethtown. Soon they were clamoring at the door of a physician, into whose home the wounded man was assisted as soon as the door was opened.  \"Examine my head at once, doctor,\" he faintly urged, as he sat back in a big armchair. \"Find out where that infernal bullet is. Tell me if it's somewhere inside my skull, and if I have a chance of recovery.\"  In a short time the bandages were removed and the doctor began his examination.  \"Well! well!\" he exclaimed, as he saw where the bullet had entered. \"How long ago did this happen? Yesterday afternoon? Forty miles from here? And you came all this distance? Well, you have sand! At first glance one would suppose the ball had gone straight through your head. It struck the frontal bone and was deflected, following over the coronal suture, and here it is lodged in your scalp at the back of your head. I will have it out in a moment.\"  He worked swiftly, clipping away the hair with a pair of scissors, and then with a lance he made an incision and straightened up a moment later, having a flattened piece of lead in his hand.  \"My friend,\" he said, \"you have grit, and I don't think you'll be laid up very long with that wound. You're not at all seriously injured. It must have been fired from some one below you. Was he shooting at a deer?\"  \"Yes, señor,\" was the answer.  \"Very strange,\" said the physician. \"This is a thirty-two-calibre bullet, and it's not like the kind used to shoot deer. Most remarkable.\"  He hastened to cleanse and dress the wound, again bandaging the man's head.  \"You are certain, señor, that this injury is not serious?\" questioned the wounded man, when everything had been done.  \"I see no reason why it should be,\" was the answer. \"It is not liable to give serious trouble to a man of your stamina, endurance, and nerve.\"  The doctor's bill was paid, and then they sought a hotel, where they found accommodations, and the wounded one was put into bed. Ere getting into bed he shook hands with his two companions and said:  \"It's not easy, señors, to kill one in whose veins runs the blood of old Guerrero. They thought me dead, but the dog that fired the shot shall pay the penalty of his treachery, and I swear I will yet crush Frank Merriwell as the panther crushes the doe. That's the oath of Porfias del Norte!\"     CHAPTER II.  THE TERROR OF O'TOOLE.   Watson Scott, familiarly known as Old Gripper, was a man of great hardihood and endurance, and, therefore, for all of his recent experience with Frank Merriwell's enemies, for all that he had been imprisoned by his captors in a natural well and had stood for hours in water up to his hips, "]]]
