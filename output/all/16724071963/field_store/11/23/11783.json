The scientific men above mentioned were, Mr Green, an astronomer; Mr Banks, a naturalist, who afterwards became Sir Joseph Banks and a celebrated man; Doctor Solander, who was also a naturalist; and two draughtsmen, one of whom was skilled in drawing objects of natural history, the other in taking views of scenery.  The _Endeavour_ was victualled for a cruise of eighteen months.  She was a three-masted vessel of the barque rig, and carried twenty-two large guns, besides a store of small arms,--for the region of the world to which they were bound was inhabited by savages, against whom they might find it necessary to defend themselves.  When all was ready, Captain Cook hoisted his flag, and spread his sails, and, on the 26th of August 1768, the voyage began--England soon dropped out of sight astern, and ere long the blue sky above and the blue sea below were all that remained for the eyes of the navigators to rest upon.  It is a wonderful thought, when we come to consider it, the idea of _going to sea_!  To sailors who are used to it, the thought, indeed, may be very commonplace, and to lazy minds that are not much given to think deeply upon any subject, the thought may not appear very wonderful; but it is so, nevertheless, to us, men of the land, when we calmly sit down and ponder the idea of making to ourselves a house of planks and beams of wood, launching it upon the sea, loading it with food and merchandise, setting up tall poles above its roof, spreading great sheets thereon, and then rushing out upon the troubled waters of the great deep, there, for days and nights, for weeks and months, and even years, to brave the fury of the winds and waves, with nothing between us and death except a wooden plank, some two or three inches thick!  It seems a bold thing for man to act in this fashion, even when he is accustomed to it, and when he knows all about the sea which he sails over; but when, like Cook, he knows very little about the far-off ocean to which he is bound, his boldness seems and really is, much greater. It is this very uncertainty, however, that charms the minds of enterprising men, and gives interest to such voyages.  The Bible says, \"They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.\"  Navigators in all ages have borne testimony to the truth of this.  The very first pages in Cook's journal mention some of these wonders.  He says that, while they were off the coast of Spain, Mr Banks and Dr Solander, the naturalists, had an opportunity of observing some very curious marine animals, some of which were like jelly, and so colourless that it was difficult to see them in the water except at night, when they became luminous, and glowed like pale liquid fire. One, that was carefully examined, was about three inches long, and an inch thick, with a hollow passing quite through it, and a brown spot at one end, which was supposed to be its stomach.  Four of these, when first taken up out of the sea in a bucket, were found to be adhering together, and were supposed to be one animal; but on being put into a glass of water they separated and swam briskly about.  Many of them resembled precious stones, and shone in the water with bright and beautiful colours.  One little animal of this kind lived several hours in a glass of salt water, swimming about with great agility, and at every motion displaying a change of colours.  These _Medusae_, as they are called, have been spoken of by many travellers, who tell us that in some parts of the sea they are so numerous that the whole ocean is covered with them, and seems to be composed of liquid fire, usually of a pale blue or green colour.  The appearance is described as being of great splendour.  Even in the seas on our own coasts this beautiful light is often seen.  It is called phosphoric light.  Something of the same kind may be seen in the carcass of a decaying fish if taken into a dark room.  Not long after this, they saw flying-fish.  Cook says that when seen from the cabin windows they were beautiful beyond imagination, their sides having the colour and brightness of burnished silver.  When seen from the deck they did not look so beautiful, because their backs were of a dark colour.  It must not be supposed that these fish could fly about in the air like birds.  They can only fly a few yards at a time. They usually rise suddenly from the waves, fly as if in a great hurry, not more than a yard or two above the surface, and then drop as suddenly back into the sea as they rose out of it.  The two fins near the shoulders of the fish are very long, so that they can be used as wings for these short flights.  When chased by their enemy, the dolphin, flying-fish usually take a flight in order to escape.  They do not, however, appear to be able to use their eyes when out of the water, for they have been seen to fly against ships at sea, get entangled in the rigging, and fall helpless on the deck.  They are not quite so large as a herring, and are considered very good eating.  On drawing near to Cape Horn, on the extreme south of South America, the voyagers began to prepare for bad weather, for this Cape is notorious for its storms.  Few mariners approach the Horn without some preparation, for many a good ship has gone to the bottom in the gales that blow there.  It was here that they first fell in with savages.  The ship having approached close to that part of the land named Tierra del Fuego, natives were observed on shore.  As Mr Banks and Dr Solander were anxious to visit them, a boat was lowered and sent ashore.  They landed near a bay in the lee of some rocks where the water was smooth.  Thirty or forty of the Indians soon made their appearance at the end of a sandy beach on the other side of the bay, but seeing that there were twelve Europeans in the boat they were afraid, and retreated.  Mr Banks and Dr Solander then advanced about one hundred yards, on which two of the Indians returned, and, having advanced some paces, sat down.  As soon as the gentlemen came up the savages rose and each threw away a small stick which he had carried in his hand.  This was intended for a sign of peace.  They then walked briskly towards their companions, who had halted about fifty yards behind them, and beckoned the gentlemen to follow, which they did.  They were received with many uncouth signs of friendship, and, in return, gave the savages some beads and ribbons, which greatly delighted them.  A feeling of good-will having been thus established, the two parties joined and tried to hold converse by means of signs.  Three of the Indians agreed to accompany them back to the ship, and when they got on board one of the wild visitors began to go through some extraordinary antics.  When he was taken to any new part of the ship, or when he was shown any new thing, he shouted with all his force for some minutes, without directing his voice either to the people of the ship or to his companions.  Some beef and bread being given to them, they ate it, but did not seem to relish it much.  Nevertheless, such of it as they did not eat they took away with them.  But they would not swallow a drop either of wine or spirits.  They put the glass to their lips, but, having tasted the liquor, they returned it with looks of disgust.  Cook says he was much surprised at the want of curiosity in these savages of the Cape, and seems to have formed a very low opinion of them.  They were conducted all over the ship, yet, although they saw a vast number of beautiful and curious things that must have been quite new to them, they did not give vent to any expression of wonder or pleasure--for the howling above spoken of did not seem to be either,-- and when they returned to land they did not seem anxious to tell what they had seen, neither did their comrades appear desirous of hearing anything about their visit to the ship.  Altogether, they seemed a much lower race of people than the inhabitants of the South-Sea Islands whom Cook afterwards visited.    CHAPTER THREE.  DESCRIBES AN ADVENTURE IN THE MOUNTAINS, AND TELLS OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO.  One of the main objects that Mr Banks and Dr Solander had in view in going with Captain Cook on this voyage was to collect specimens of plants and insects in the new countries they were about to visit.  The country near Cape Horn was at that time almost unknown: indeed, it is not much known even at the present day.  The two naturalists of the expedition were therefore anxious to land and explore the shore.  Accordingly, early one fine morning a party went ashore to ascend one of the mountains.  It consisted of Mr Banks and Dr Solander with their servants, two of whom were negroes; Mr Buchan, the draughtsman; Mr Monkhouse, the surgeon of the ship; and Mr Green, the astronomer. These set off to push as far as they could into the country, intending to return before night.  They were accompanied by two seamen, who carried their baggage.  The hills, when viewed from a distance, seemed to be partly wooded; above the wood there was a plain, and beyond that bare rocks.  Mr Banks hoped to get through the woods, and made no doubt that beyond it he would find new sorts of plants which no botanists had ever yet heard of. They entered the wood full of hope, and with much of the excitement that men cannot but feel when exploring a country that has never been trodden by the foot of a civilised man since the world began.  It took them, however, much longer to get through the pathless wood than they had expected.  It was afternoon before they reached what they had taken for a plain, but which, to their great disappointment, they found to be a swamp covered with low bushes, which were so stubborn that they could not break through them, and were therefore compelled to step over them, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23267"],["title","The Cannibal Islands: Captain Cook's Adventure in the South Seas (#2)"],["body","at every step they sank up to the ankles in mud--a mode of progress so fatiguing that they were all very soon exhausted.  To make matters worse, the weather became gloomy and cold, with sudden blasts of piercing wind accompanied by snow.  They pushed on vigorously notwithstanding, and had well-nigh crossed the swamp when Mr Buchan was suddenly seized with a fit.  This compelled a halt.  As he could not go further, a fire was kindled, and those who were most fatigued were left behind to take care of him, while the rest continued to advance.  At last they reached the summit of the mountain, and were rewarded for their toil by the botanical specimens discovered there.  It was late in the day by that time, and as it was impossible to get back to the ship that night, they were obliged to make up their minds to bivouac on the mountain, a necessity which caused them no little uneasiness, for it had now become bitterly cold.  Sharp blasts of wind became so frequent, however, that they could not remain on the exposed mountain-side, and were obliged to make for the shelter of the woods in the nearest valley.  Mr Buchan having recovered, and the whole party having reassembled, they set out to recross the swamp, intending, when they should get into the woods, to build a hut of leaves and branches, kindle a fire, and pass the night there as well as they could.  But an overpowering torpor had now begun to seize hold upon some of the party, and it was with the greatest difficulty the others could prevent the drowsy ones from lying down to sleep in the snow.  This almost irresistible tendency to sleep is common in cold countries.  It is one of the effects of extreme cold upon exhausted men, and is a very dangerous condition, because those who fall into it cannot resist giving way to it, even though they know that if they do so they will certainly die.  Dr Solander, who had formerly travelled on the snow-topped mountains of Norway, was aware of the danger of giving way to this feeling, and strove to prevent his companions from falling into the fatal rest. \"Whoever sits down,\" said he, \"will sleep, and whoever sleeps will awake no more.\"  Strange to say, Dr Solander was the first to disregard his own warning. While they were still pushing across the naked side of the mountain, the cold became suddenly so intense that it increased the effect they dreaded so much.  The doctor found the desire to rest so irresistible that he insisted on being suffered to lie down.  Mr Banks tried to prevent him, but in vain.  Down he lay upon the ground, covered though it was with snow, and all that his friends could do was to keep shaking him, and so prevent him from falling into the fatal sleep.  At the same time one of the negro servants became affected in a similar manner.  Mr Banks, therefore, sent forward five of the company with orders to get a fire ready at the first convenient place they could find, while himself with four others remained with the doctor and the negro, whom partly by entreaty and partly by force, they roused up and brought on for some little distance.  But when they had got through the greatest part of the swamp they both declared they could go no further.  Again Mr Banks tried to reason with the two unfortunate men, pointing out their extreme danger, and beseeching them to make an effort to advance.  But all he could say had no effect.  When the negro was told that if he would not go on he must, in a short time, be frozen to death, he answered that he desired nothing but to be allowed to lie down and die.  Dr Solander, on being told the same thing, replied that he was willing to go on but that he must \"_first take some sleep_,\" forgetting apparently that he had before told his comrades that to sleep was to perish.  As Mr Banks and his companions could not carry them, there was no help for it--they were suffered to sit down, being partly supported by the bushes.  In a few minutes they were both sound asleep.  Providentially, just at that time, some of the people who had been sent forward returned with the welcome news that a fire had been lighted not more than a quarter of a mile off.  Renewed attempts were therefore made to rouse the sleepers.  But the negro was past help.  Every effort failed to awaken him.  With Dr Solander they were more successful, yet, though he had not slept five minutes he had almost lost the use of his limbs, and the muscles were so shrunken that the shoes fell off his feet. Staggering and stumbling among the slush and snow, more dead than alive, he was half carried, half dragged by his comrades to the fire.  Meanwhile the other negro and a seaman were left in charge of the unfortunate black servant, with directions to stay by him and do what they could for him until help should be sent.  The moment Dr Solander was got to the fire, two of the strongest of the party who had been refreshed were sent back to bring in the negro.  In half an hour, however, they had the mortification to see these two men return alone. They had been unable to find their comrades.  This at first seemed unaccountable, but when it was discovered that the only bottle of rum belonging to the party was amissing, Mr Banks thought it probable that it had been in the knapsack of one of the absent men, that by means of it the sleeping negro had been revived, that they had then tried to reach the fire without waiting for assistance, and so had lost themselves.  It was by this time quite dark, another heavy fall of snow had come on, and continued for two hours, so that all hope of seeing them again alive was given up, for it must be remembered that the men remaining by the fire were so thoroughly knocked up that had they gone out to try to save their comrades they would in all probability have lost their own lives. Towards midnight, however, a shout was heard at some distance.  Mr Banks, with four others, went out immediately, and found the seaman who had been left with the two negroes, staggering along with just strength enough to keep on his legs.  He was quickly brought to the fire, and, having described where the other two were, Mr Banks proceeded in search of them.  They were soon found.  The first negro, who had sunk down at the same time with Dr Solander, was found standing on his legs, but unable to move.  The other negro was lying on the snow as insensible as a stone.  All hands were now called from the fire, and an attempt was made to carry them to it, but every man was so weak from cold, hunger, and fatigue that the united strength of the whole party was not sufficient for this.  The night was extremely dark, the snow was very deep, and although they were but a short distance from the fire, it was as much as each man could do to make his way back to it, stumbling and falling as he went through bogs and bushes.  Thus the poor negroes were left to their sad fate, and some of the others were so near sharing that fate with them that they began to lose their sense of feeling.  One of Mr Banks's servants became so ill, that it was feared he would die before he could be got to the fire.  At the fire, however, they did eventually arrive, and beside it passed a dreadful night of anxiety, grief, and suffering.  Of the twelve who had set out on this unfortunate expedition in health and good spirits two were dead; a third was so ill that it was doubtful whether he would be able to go forward in the morning; and a fourth, Mr Buchan, was in danger of a return of his fits.  They were distant from the ship a long day's journey, while snow lay deep on the ground and still continued to fall.  Moreover, as they had not expected to be out so long, they had no provisions left, except a vulture which chanced to be shot, and which was not large enough to afford each of them quarter of a meal.  When morning dawned nothing was to be seen, as far as the eye could reach, but snow, which seemed to lie as thick upon the trees as on the ground, and the wind came down in such sudden violent blasts, that they did not dare to resume their journey.  How long this might last they knew not.  Despair crept slowly over them, and they began gloomily to believe that they were doomed to perish of hunger and cold in that dreary waste.  But the Almighty, who often affords help to man when his case seems most hopeless and desperate, sent deliverance in a way most agreeable and unexpected.  He caused a soft, mild breeze to blow, under the influence of which the clouds began to clear away, the intense cold moderated, and the gladdening sun broke forth, so that with revived spirits and frames the wanderers were enabled to start on the return journey to the coast.  Before doing so, they cooked and ate the vulture, and it is probable that they devoured that meal with fully as much eagerness and satisfaction as the ravenous bird itself ever devoured its prey.  It was but a light breakfast, however.  After being skinned, the bird was divided into ten portions, and every man cooked his own as he thought fit, but each did not receive above three mouthfuls.  Nevertheless it strengthened them enough to enable them to return to the ship, where they were received by their anxious friends with much joy and thankfulness.  The month of December is the middle of summer in the land at the extreme south of South America.  That land occupies much about the same position on the southern half of this world that we occupy on the northern half; so that, when it is winter with us, it is summer there.  The climate is rigorous and stormy in the extreme, and the description given of the natives shows that they are a wretched and forlorn race of human beings.  Captain Cook visited one of their villages before leaving the coast.  It contained about a dozen dwellings of the poorest description.  They were mere hovels; nothing more than a few poles set up in a circle and meeting together at the top, each forming a kind of cone.  On the weather side each cone was covered with a few boughs "]]]
