In the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away from the office.  But it is a real crisis.  I have never seen the Prime Minister so upset.  As to the Admiralty--it is buzzing like an overturned bee-hive.  Have you read up the case?\"  \"We have just done so.  What were the technical papers?\"  \"Ah, there's the point!  Fortunately, it has not come out.  The press would be furious if it did.  The papers which this wretched youth had in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine.\"  Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the importance of the subject.  His brother and I sat expectant.  \"Surely you have heard of it?  I thought everyone had heard of it.\"  \"Only as a name.\"  \"Its importance can hardly be exaggerated.  It has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets.  You may take it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the radius of a Bruce-Partington's operation.  Two years ago a very large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was expended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention.  Every effort has been made to keep the secret.  The plans, which are exceedingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with burglar-proof doors and windows.  Under no conceivable circumstances were the plans to be taken from the office.  If the chief constructor of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to go to the Woolwich office for the purpose.  And yet here we find them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London.  From an official point of view it's simply awful.\"  \"But you have recovered them?\"  \"No, Sherlock, no!  That's the pinch.  We have not.  Ten papers were taken from Woolwich.  There were seven in the pocket of Cadogan West. The three most essential are gone--stolen, vanished.  You must drop everything, Sherlock.  Never mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court.  It's a vital international problem that you have to solve.  Why did Cadogan West take the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he die, how came his body where it was found, how can the evil be set right?  Find an answer to all these questions, and you will have done good service for your country.\"  \"Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft?  You can see as far as I.\"  \"Possibly, Sherlock.  But it is a question of getting details. Give me your details, and from an armchair I will return you an excellent expert opinion.  But to run here and run there, to cross-question railway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to my eye--it is not my metier.  No, you are the one man who can clear the matter up.  If you have a fancy to see your name in the next honours list--\"  My friend smiled and shook his head.  \"I play the game for the game's own sake,\" said he.  \"But the problem certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be very pleased to look into it.  Some more facts, please.\"  \"I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of paper, together with a few addresses which you will find of service.  The actual official guardian of the papers is the famous government expert, Sir James Walter, whose decorations and sub-titles fill two lines of a book of reference.  He has grown gray in the service, is a gentleman, a favoured guest in the most exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose patriotism is beyond suspicion.  He is one of two who have a key of the safe.  I may add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during working hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about three o'clock taking his key with him.  He was at the house of Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the evening when this incident occurred.\"  \"Has the fact been verified?\"  \"Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to his departure from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his arrival in London; so Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the problem.\"  \"Who was the other man with a key?\"  \"The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson.  He is a man of forty, married, with five children.  He is a silent, morose man, but he has, on the whole, an excellent record in the public service.  He is unpopular with his colleagues, but a hard worker.  According to his own account, corroborated only by the word of his wife, he was at home the whole of Monday evening after office hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain upon which it hangs.\"  \"Tell us about Cadogan West.\"  \"He has been ten years in the service and has done good work.  He has the reputation of being hot-headed and imperious, but a straight, honest man.  We have nothing against him.  He was next Sidney Johnson in the office.  His duties brought him into daily, personal contact with the plans.  No one else had the handling of them.\"  \"Who locked up the plans that night?\"  \"Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk.\"  \"Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away.  They are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan West. That seems final, does it not?\"  \"It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained.  In the first place, why did he take them?\"  \"I presume they were of value?\"  \"He could have got several thousands for them very easily.\"  \"Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to London except to sell them?\"  \"No, I cannot.\"  \"Then we must take that as our working hypothesis.  Young West took the papers.  Now this could only be done by having a false key--\"  \"Several false keys.  He had to open the building and the room.\"  \"He had, then, several false keys.  He took the papers to London to sell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans themselves back in the safe next morning before they were missed. While in London on this treasonable mission he met his end.\"  \"How?\"  \"We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment.\"  \"Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the station London Bridge, which would be his route to Woolwich.\"  \"Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would pass London Bridge.  There was someone in the carriage, for example, with whom he was having an absorbing interview.  This interview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life.  Possibly he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on the line, and so met his end.  The other closed the door.  There was a thick fog, and nothing could be seen.\"  \"No better explanation can be given with our present knowledge; and yet consider, Sherlock, how much you leave untouched.  We will suppose, for argument's sake, that young Cadogan West HAD determined to convey these papers to London.  He would naturally have made an appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear.  Instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there, and then suddenly disappeared.\"  \"A blind,\" said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some impatience to the conversation.  \"A very singular one.  That is objection No. 1.  Objection No. 2: We will suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent.  He must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be discovered.  He took away ten.  Only seven were in his pocket.  What had become of the other three?  He certainly would not leave them of his own free will.  Then, again, where is the price of his treason? Once would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket.\"  \"It seems to me perfectly clear,\" said Lestrade.  \"I have no doubt at all as to what occurred.  He took the papers to sell them.  He saw the agent. They could not agree as to price.  He started home again, but the agent went with him.  In the train the agent murdered him, took the more essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage.  That would account for everything, would it not?\"  \"Why had he no ticket?\"  \"The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent's house.  Therefore he took it from the murdered man's pocket.\"  \"Good, Lestrade, very good,\" said Holmes.  \"Your theory holds together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end.  On the one hand, the traitor is dead.  On the other, the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on the Continent.  What is there for us to do?\"  \"To act, Sherlock--to act!\" cried Mycroft, springing to his feet. \"All my instincts are against this explanation.  Use your powers! Go to the scene of the crime!  See the people concerned!  Leave no stone unturned!  In all your career you have never had so great a chance of serving your country.\"  \"Well, well!\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \"Come, Watson! And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour or two?  We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate Station. Good-bye, Mycroft.  I shall let you have a report before evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect.\"  An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately before Aldgate Station.  A courteous red-faced old gentleman represented the railway company.  \"This is where the young man's body lay,\" said he, indicating a spot about three feet from the metals.  \"It could not have fallen from above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls. Therefore, it could only have come from a train, and that train, so far as we can trace it, must have passed about midnight on Monday.\"  \"Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?\"  \"There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found.\"  \"No record of a door being found open?\"  \"None.\"  \"We have had some fresh evidence this morning,\" said Lestrade. \"A passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about 11:40 on Monday"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2346"],["title","The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans (#2)"],["body","declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a body striking the line, just before the train reached the station.  There was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen.  He made no report of it at the time.  Why, whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?\"  My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon his face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the tunnel.  Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points.  On these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy, tufted brows which I knew so well.  \"Points,\" he muttered; \"the points.\"  \"What of it?  What do you mean?\"  \"I suppose there are no great number of points on a system such as this?\"  \"No; they are very few.\"  \"And a curve, too.  Points, and a curve.  By Jove! if it were only so.\"  \"What is it, Mr. Holmes?  Have you a clue?\"  \"An idea--an indication, no more.  But the case certainly grows in interest.  Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not?  I do not see any indications of bleeding on the line.\"  \"There were hardly any.\"  \"But I understand that there was a considerable wound.\"  \"The bone was crushed, but there was no great external injury.\"  \"And yet one would have expected some bleeding.  Would it be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog?\"  \"I fear not, Mr. Holmes.  The train has been broken up before now, and the carriages redistributed.\"  \"I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,\" said Lestrade, \"that every carriage has been carefully examined.  I saw to it myself.\"  It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.  \"Very likely,\" said he, turning away.  \"As it happens, it was not the carriages which I desired to examine.  Watson, we have done all we can here.  We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade.  I think our investigations must now carry us to Woolwich.\"  At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he handed to me before dispatching it.  It ran thus:  See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out. Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street, a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to be in England, with full address.  Sherlock.  \"That should be helpful, Watson,\" he remarked as we took our seats in the Woolwich train.  \"We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable case.\"  His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance had opened up a stimulating line of thought.  See the foxhound with hanging ears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and compare it with the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it runs upon a breast-high scent--such was the change in Holmes since the morning.  He was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly only a few hours before round the fog-girt room.  \"There is material here.  There is scope,\" said he.  \"I am dull indeed not to have understood its possibilities.\"  \"Even now they are dark to me.\"  \"The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea which may lead us far.  The man met his death elsewhere, and his body was on the ROOF of a carriage.\"  \"On the roof!\"  \"Remarkable, is it not?  But consider the facts.  Is it a coincidence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches and sways as it comes round on the points?  Is not that the place where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off?  The points would affect no object inside the train.  Either the body fell from the roof, or a very curious coincidence has occurred.  But now consider the question of the blood.  Of course, there was no bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere.  Each fact is suggestive in itself.  Together they have a cumulative force.\"  \"And the ticket, too!\" I cried.  \"Exactly.  We could not explain the absence of a ticket.  This would explain it.  Everything fits together.\"  \"But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling the mystery of his death.  Indeed, it becomes not simpler but stranger.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Holmes, thoughtfully, \"perhaps.\"  He relapsed into a silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in Woolwich Station.  There he called a cab and drew Mycroft's paper from his pocket.  \"We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,\" said he.  \"I think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention.\"  The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green lawns stretching down to the Thames.  As we reached it the fog was lifting, and a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through.  A butler answered our ring.  \"Sir James, sir!\" said he with solemn face.  \"Sir James died this morning.\"  \"Good heavens!\" cried Holmes in amazement.  \"How did he die?\"  \"Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel Valentine?\"  \"Yes, we had best do so.\"  We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an instant later we were joined by a very tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the younger brother of the dead scientist.  His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household.  He was hardly articulate as he spoke of it.  \"It was this horrible scandal,\" said he.  \"My brother, Sir James, was a man of very sensitive honour, and he could not survive such an affair. It broke his heart.  He was always so proud of the efficiency of his department, and this was a crushing blow.\"  \"We had hoped that he might have given us some indications which would have helped us to clear the matter up.\"  \"I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you and to all of us.  He had already put all his knowledge at the disposal of the police.  Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan West was guilty.  But all the rest was inconceivable.\"  \"You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?\"  \"I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard.  I have no desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end.\"  \"This is indeed an unexpected development,\" said my friend when we had regained the cab.  \"I wonder if the death was natural, or whether the poor old fellow killed himself!  If the latter, may it be taken as some sign of self-reproach for duty neglected?  We must leave that question to the future.  Now we shall turn to the Cadogan Wests.\"  A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town sheltered the bereaved mother.  The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of any use to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead man, and the last to see him upon that fatal night.  \"I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes,\" she said.  \"I have not shut an eye since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what the true meaning of it can be.  Arthur was the most single-minded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth.  He would have cut his right hand off before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping.  It is absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him.\"  \"But the facts, Miss Westbury?\"  \"Yes, yes; I admit I cannot explain them.\"  \"Was he in any want of money?\"  \"No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample.  He had saved a few hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year.\"  \"No signs of any mental excitement?  Come, Miss Westbury, be absolutely frank with us.\"  The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her manner.  She coloured and hesitated.  \"Yes,\" she said at last, \"I had a feeling that there was something on his mind.\"  \"For long?\"  \"Only for the last week or so.  He was thoughtful and worried. Once I pressed him about it.  He admitted that there was something, and that it was concerned with his official life.  'It is too serious for me to speak about, even to you,' said he.  I could get nothing more.\"  Holmes looked grave.  \"Go on, Miss Westbury.  Even if it seems to tell against him, go on. We cannot say what it may lead to.\"  \"Indeed, I have nothing more to tell.  Once or twice it seemed to me that he was on the point of telling me something.  He spoke one evening of the importance of the secret, and I have some recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a great deal to have it.\"  My friend's face grew graver still.  \"Anything else?\"  \"He said that we were slack about such matters--that it would be easy for a traitor to get the plans.\"  \"Was it only recently that he made such remarks?\"  \"Yes, quite recently.\"  \"Now tell us of that last evening.\"  \"We were to go to the theatre.  The fog was so thick that a cab was useless.  We walked, and our way took us close to the office. Suddenly he darted away into the fog.\"  \"Without a word?\"  \"He gave an exclamation; that was all.  I waited but he never returned. Then I walked home.  Next morning, after the office opened, they came to inquire.  About twelve o'clock we heard the terrible news.  Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour!  It was so much to him.\"  Holmes shook his head sadly.  \"Come, Watson,\" said he, \"our ways lie elsewhere.  Our next station must be the office from which the papers were taken.  \"It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries make it blacker,\" he remarked as the cab lumbered off. \"His coming marriage gives a motive for the crime.  He naturally wanted money.  The idea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his"]]]
