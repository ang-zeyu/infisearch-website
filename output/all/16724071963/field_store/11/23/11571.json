And when I go out walking with old black Daniel behind me, it is just as hard as staying at home. I want little girls and boys to play with and take me places;--I get tired of my dolls,\" she ended wistfully.  Samuel nodded with understanding sympathy. To have this little stranger maid listen to his stories or follow him on his lonely rambles! If he might even go to play with her sometimes in the garden behind Peter Stuyvesant's house. He frowned at the thought: it was not hard to picture the old governor falling into one of his rages at the insolence of the Jewish boy who dared to walk down the garden path. And yet what fun they would have had with every bush a mysterious fairy castle, every tree a pirate ship to take them across the Main. He sighed regretfully, turning to listen to his companion's bright chatter.  \"I suppose they're looking all over for me,\" she laughed mischievously, \"cook and black Daniel and Uncle Peter, too. Won't he be cross! He was so cross this morning when he got a letter from Holland, a big letter with a big red seal, and he'll be crosser yet when I'm not home for dinner.\" She tossed her sunny curls defiantly. \"But he won't dare to scold me; he'll scold everybody else and shake his cane at them, but he won't dare to be cross to me.\"  \"But I think you ought to go home,\" suggested Samuel. \"It isn't right to worry your uncle so when he is so good to you and gives you such nice presents.\"  She made a roguish little face. \"I can't go home,\" she giggled, teasingly, \"I've never been out alone and I lost my way almost as soon as I left the garden. So I'll just have to stay here all day until somebody from home comes and finds me.\" She sprang up, shaking out her silken skirts, dancing gayly in her little buckled shoes. \"Come, boy,\" she commanded imperiously, \"Come and play with me.\" She fumbled in the pocket of her black satin apron and drew out a tiny worsted ball. \"Let's play ball,\" she cried, \"and then we'll run races and climb that tree over there and maybe you can tell me stories when I'm tired. My old nurse in Holland used to tell me brave tales, but I don't like those black Daniel tells--all about charms and goblins. Do you know any nice stories, boy?\"  \"Yes, a few,\" admitted Samuel modestly. His cheeks, usually so pale, were flushed with excitement; the little playfellow of his dreams seemed to have come to life in the flower-strewn meadow. He caught the bright ball she tossed to him and laughed with pleasure. \"You catch wrongly,\" he chided her, \"but I like to play with you.\"  The afternoon sped on golden wings. Perhaps neither of the children would have dreamed of the lateness of the hour had not Katrina interrupted Samuel in the middle of one of his glowing tales, exclaiming, \"I'm hungry, now. I wonder what cook has for supper?\"  Samuel started. The story of the old sea captain he had been telling his new friend was very real to him; he could almost see the old, ancient, weather-beaten vessel, hear the waves beating on the shores of that distant island where the golden treasure lay hidden for so many years. Now his dream people faded away and he saw that the sun was setting and felt the air growing chill and damp about them. He rose a little wearily and helped Katrina to her feet.  \"We must go home,\" he said, gravely. \"Perhaps we did wrong to stay so long, but it was fun to play together, wasn't it? And did you like my stories?\"  She nodded, bending to pick up the bouquet he had gathered for her earlier in the afternoon. \"I like them as well as the tales my nursie used to tell,\" she commented, approvingly. \"You'll show me the way home, won't you?\"  Hand in hand, they walked slowly back to the dusty street that led to the governor's house. At the gate, Samuel was about to bid his little friend good-bye, but she caught his hand and drew him in after her. \"Oh, you must stay,\" she protested, \"you must stay and let Uncle Peter thank you for bringing me home. And I want you to tell me another story after supper. You must come in!\"  \"But my mother will be worried,\" declared Samuel, \"and father----\"  \"We'll have Daniel go and tell them you are here,\" she solved the problem easily. Then she ran up the broad stairs, crying gaily, \"Oh, Uncle, I've had the loveliest time,\" as a short, stern-faced man appeared in the doorway; a man with a silver-banded wooden leg and leaning on a heavy cane.  \"Katrina!\" he exclaimed with some sternness, but she pulled his hard face down to hers for a kiss.  \"I've had such a lovely time,\" she cooed, \"and this nice boy found me and brought me home. Thank him, Uncle Peter, and have him come in and tell me some more stories.\"  Samuel drew back; but the governor nodded for him to enter, and, feeling miserably shy and uncertain of himself, he followed the pair into the house. The room they entered was richly furnished, but gloomy. Samuel, boy that he was, felt how much lovelier his mother's simple living room was with its shining brass and the few plants blooming at the window. The governor sat down behind a long table littered with papers and drew Katrina to his knee, at the same time motioning Samuel to be seated. Then he spoke, stroking the child's golden curls, his keen eyes growing gentle as they rested upon her pretty face.  \"You have been of service to my little girl and I will do my best to reward you,\" said Governor Stuyvesant, kindly. \"What will it be, my lad, a velvet suit brought over in the last cargo from Holland, or a golden chain?\" Suddenly the eyes he turned upon Samuel grew cold and keen again. \"You are not one of us, yet I have seen you before. Who is your father and what is his trade?\"  \"I am Samuel, the son of Jacob Barsimon,\" answered Samuel, and suddenly all his shyness left him and he gazed fearlessly into the governor's face. \"And my father is an honest merchant of New Amsterdam.\"  \"Yes--and of the tribe of Israel,\" muttered the old man, his brow darkening. \"I wish my little one might have been indebted to another this day; but I am as honest a man as your father and what I promise, I keep. So name what reward you will for the favor you have rendered me--and be off.\"  Samuel rose, his face flushing with anger at the man's insolence, yet glowing with a hope he hardly dared to utter even to himself. For the time had come, he believed, when he might play the hero, as he had done so many times before in his dreams. \"I want no reward,\" he answered quietly, \"but if you would render me favor for favor, I would ask you to withdraw the restriction you have placed upon my brethren--those Jews who sought these shores on the 'St. Catarina' and who desire to make their homes here.\"  The governor smiled grimly. \"A true Jew,\" he muttered, with a sort of grudging admiration for the boy's boldness, \"ever ready with his bargain! But I have no longer the power to grant you or refuse you your request.\" He picked up from the table a long, bulky envelope, from which dangled a red seal. \"This came this morning from Holland. Tomorrow I must tell the burghers that the gentlemen of the Board of Directors of the Dutch West India Company have over-ridden my suggestions; they write that I must admit these Jews, provided that the poor among them shall not become a burden to our community, as they at first seemed likely to be, but be supported by their own nation.\" Again his grim smile. \"No fear of that, when even a boy like you thinks of his people before gifts for himself. I wish,\" he half mused, \"I wish that we had at least that virtue of your stiff-necked race.\"  Little Katrina, grown weary of all this, slipped from her uncle's knees and took Samuel's hand in hers. \"Come into the garden,\" she commanded, \"I want you to see my rose bushes and my new kittens and the swing, before supper.\"  Samuel's eyes sought the governor's face, half-he told her, gently.  Her eager face clouded. \"Then you will come and play with me tomorrow?\" she asked.  Samuel's eyes sought the governor's face, half-defiantly, half-wistfully. \"When your uncle sends for me, I will come,\" he said, and, bowing in a manner that would have delighted his careful mother, he left the room. Katrina was about to follow him, but her uncle called her back rather sternly.  \"Nay, do not pout, my pretty,\" he told her, \"for I will try to find you a worthier playfellow than the son of a Jew trader.\"  Samuel walked home slowly through the April twilight. In the harbor he could see the dim outlines of the 'St. Catarina,' which had in truth brought the Jewish wanderers to a home in New Amsterdam. But Samuel was not thinking of the wanderers who, after their months of weary waiting, could look toward the future with hopeful eyes; nor did he feel relieved that, since they were not to be deported, the newcomers would surely come to his _barmitzvah_ party. At that moment he thought only of the golden-curled fairy princess who would never romp and play with him again.     A PLACE OF REFUGE  _How the Wanderer Came to Rhode Island._   It was bitter cold. The icy wind howling through the forest caught up the snow and whirled it in great eddies against the trees. Reuben Mendoza, staggering through the blinding snowflakes, hugged his little son Benjamin closer to his heart, and prayed desperately that the storm might cease or that he might soon come to a place of refuge. His own limbs were aching with fatigue and cold. He had eaten nothing since early morning and was faint with hunger. Wearied and heartsick, he would have been glad to lie down upon the ground, to sink into "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22915"],["title","The New Land (#4)"],["body","sleep, perhaps a painless death, with the snow drifting above him; but he knew that he must struggle on for the sake of the child he was warming in his bosom.  Suddenly Benjamin, half asleep and numb with the cold, stirred a little and complained drowsily that he was hungry. His father paused for a moment and pressed his lean, bearded face against the child's rosy cheeks. \"Be patient, little one,\" he comforted him, \"for soon we shall find a lodging for the night. Surely, no one would turn even a Jew away in a storm like this.\"  Again he plodded on, footsore and discouraged. The wind lashed him like a whip, and, when he raised his head, the snow cut across his forehead like stripes of fire. His lips moving almost mechanically in prayer, Reuben faltered through the storm, until at last utterly exhausted he stumbled to the ground. He tried to gain his feet again, for he thought he saw a light glimmering through the trees; but he was too tired to go farther. Why should he try to reach that light, he asked himself, as he dreamily stretched his tired limbs in the snow. But he felt little Benjamin moving beneath his cloak, and with one last effort he crawled through the drifts, clinging to the trees as he moved. A few moments later he found himself before a little shack. A single tallow candle shone through the window and cast a path of light before his weary feet. Reuben lurched forward against the door; it opened beneath his weight and he fell within the hut. He had a dim vision of two men bending over him; some one was taking little Benjamin from his arms; then the warm darkness wrapped him about like a cloak, and he knew nothing more.         *       *       *       *       *  When Reuben opened his eyes, he found that he was resting upon a couch of skins in one corner of the hut. It was a poor place; the walls were bare, and through their chinks snows drifted upon the frozen earthen floor. Beside the pallet there was no furniture in the room save a roughly hewn table and several chairs. Near the table sat two men, the one dressed in rich garments, a sword at his side; the other clothed in dull gray, with a broad white collar and a plain beaver hat. This man held little Benjamin on his knee and stroked his dark curls as the child drank greedily from the steaming cup which the kind-eyed stranger held to his lips.  Reuben sat up among the skins and noticed in surprise that his hosts had removed his wet garments and replaced them with a long, warm cloak of bearskin. What manner of men were these, he asked himself, who treated a Jewish wanderer so kindly? As he advanced timidly toward the table, the man in gray turned to him and held out his hand.  \"_Shalom_,\" he said smiling.  Reuben took his hand, astonished to hear the tongue of his fathers in the wilderness of the American forests. \"_Shalom aleichem_,\" he faltered. \"But you are not a Jew.\"  The other shook his head and answered him in English, a language Reuben had learned from the trading Englishmen and adventurers he had met while in South America. \"No, but I am a minister and have studied the Hebrew tongue. And I love its greeting of 'Peace.' Would that my people were lovers of peace, even as your's have been for so long.\"  Benjamin ran to his father. \"Father,\" he cried, \"the good gentleman gave me warm milk to drink and bread to eat and this fine cloak to wear,\" and he proudly smoothed the robe wrapped about his chilled limbs.  The man in gray motioned Reuben to sit beside the table and placed food and drink before him. Half-famished, Reuben ate and drank, almost fearing that it would disappear as a feast sometimes does in a dream. For surely he was dreaming: when in all his wretched wandering life, had people not of his own religion given him food and shelter and received him with gentle words?  His host sat upon the couch, holding Benjamin upon his knee. Now and then he spoke to the dark, haughty man who sat watching everything lazily from beneath his half-closed lids. Twice he asked Reuben whether he desired more food or drink. At last when the guest had satisfied his hunger, the host asked him from what place he had come and to what spot he meant to journey when the storm was over.  \"I know not,\" answered the Jew. \"My father's family was driven from Spain. They fled to Brazil, and later settled in Cayenne, where among our brethren from Holland we found a resting place until the French destroyed our homes and drove us forth to be wanderers on the face of the earth. When this child's mother died, I longed to go to a far country where I might forget my grief a little and begin life anew. So I took my son and came here with other voyagers to your colony of New Amsterdam. But there they gave me no welcome, because I was a Jew;--even in this new country some there are who hate the children of Jacob.\" He leaned forward, his thin face alight with a wistful hope. \"But there they told me of a new colony in the far wilderness,--a colony where men of every race, of every creed, were welcome. Far off in the swamps and forests, they said, a man named Roger Williams had established a refuge for all those who were persecuted and despised, and had proclaimed that no man would be troubled there for the sake of his religion, that each inhabitant might worship the God of his fathers in peace. So I took my staff again and my burden upon my back and my little child within my arms, and set out for this place where my son might grow up a free man, and not be called upon to forsake the faith for which we suffered in Spain.\"  The man in the velvet coat leaned across the table and spoke to Reuben in Spanish. \"I, too, came from Spain,\" he said, \"and I, too, came as a refugee; yea, with a price upon my head, for I had been denounced to the officers of the Inquisition and was doomed to die. Yet I am a good Catholic and loyal, and did not deserve their hatred. Those who are not of my faith in this new land mistrust and despise me; but here, in the colony of Rhode Island, I may follow the religion of my fathers, and Roger Williams has given me his hand in brotherhood.\"  The quiet man rose and again held out his hand to the Jewish wanderer. \"And now I give my hand to you,\" he said, heartily. \"My colony of Rhode Island has need of men strong enough to die--yes, and to live--for the faith they will be allowed to follow here in peace and in safety.\"  But Reuben had caught his hand and pressed it to his heart. \"You are Roger Williams, the friend of the oppressed,\" he said brokenly.  \"Yes,\" answered Williams, \"and this day have you found a refuge with me and my people.\" A look of solemn hope lighted his gentle eyes. \"'Tis but a lonely spot in the wilderness, and we are few in number; but some day this wide land will be a refuge to the oppressed of every nation, and all those who are persecuted and despised will find a home within its borders.\"  Little by little, the winds outside ceased to drive the snow against the trees; the branches no longer tossed and creaked in the gale; a great white hush seemed to bless the quiet earth. The Spaniard who had walked to the window blew out the taper and pointed toward the rosy clouds. \"Dawn is breaking,\" he said softly, and, bowing reverently above his rosary, began to tell the beads as he recited his morning prayer. Williams took a large Bible from the shelf above the couch, opened it, and, having read his morning psalm, covered his face with his hands as he knelt beside his chair to pray. With a great joy warming his heart, Reuben, no longer a wanderer on the face of the earth, put his arm about his son, and drew him to the window that he might look upon the land that his children's children and those who came after them were to inherit as their home. Then he drew his faded, tattered _talith_ (shawl worn in prayer) from his pack, put it about his shoulders, and, facing the glowing east, the home land of his fathers, he praised the God of Israel who had brought him to this place of refuge. \"_Ma tobu oholekha_\" (\"How goodly are thy tents\"), prayed Reuben, and he sobbed like a child.     \"DOWN WITH KING GEORGE!\"  _How Isaac Franks, of the American Army, first heard the Declaration of Independence._   The news had spread like wild-fire that day in early July, 1776. Although there was not one of the American recruits stationed in New York under General Washington's command who had not heard something of the great happenings in Philadelphia a few days before, every soldier felt his heart beat faster under his buff and blue coat at the thought that he, too, would hear the Declaration of Independence read before the army. They stood waiting in their ranks, the first army of the Republic: raw farmers like those who fell at Lexington, bronzed backwoodsmen whose rifles had brought more than one lurking red-skin or savage forest beast to earth, with here and there a student, fresh from his books, or a merchant who had left his desk to fight for his country. And today they were to hear, stated simply and eloquently for all time, for what principles they fought.  In the ranks stood a slender, dark-browed boy of about seventeen. The muster roll gave his name as Isaac Franks, the simple record holding no promise of the day when the Jewish boy, a distinguished veteran of the Revolution, should entertain President Washington as his guest. Today young Franks stood undistinguished among the other eager patriots and the future president was only the leader of an army of untrained \"rebels\", knowing full well that a traitor's death awaited him if his campaign against the British proved unsuccessful.  \"I wish the general would come that we might hear the document and be dismissed,\" remarked Franks to the soldier who stood at his side; a tall, raw-boned youth about his own age. \"This hot sun is enough to melt granite and we have been assembled for almost two hours.\"  The other, also wearied and over-heated, looked him over with a sneer. \"A fine soldier with your complaints!\" "]]]
