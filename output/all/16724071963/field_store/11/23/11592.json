CHAPTER I.  THE ARRANGEMENTS.   Gentlemen and ladies at the hotels, in London, generally dine about six or seven o'clock, each party or family by themselves, in their own private parlor. One evening, about eight o'clock, just after the waiter had removed the cloth from the table where Rollo's father and mother, with Rollo himself and his cousin Jennie, had been dining, and left the table clear, Mr. Holiday rose, and walked slowly and feebly--for he was quite out of health, though much better than he had been--towards a secretary which stood at the side of the room.  \"Now,\" said he, \"we will get out the map and the railway guide, and see about the ways of getting to France.\"  Rollo and Jennie were at this time at the window, looking at the vehicles which were passing by along the Strand. The Strand is a street of London, and one of the most lively and crowded of them all. As soon as Rollo heard his father say that he was going to get the map and the railway guide, he said to Jane,--  \"Let's go and see.\"  So they both went to the table, and there, kneeling up upon two cushioned chairs which they brought forward for the purpose, they leaned over upon the table where their father was spreading out the map, and thus established themselves very comfortably as spectators of the proceedings.  \"Children,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"do you come here to listen, or to talk?\"  \"To listen,\" said Rollo.  \"O, very well,\" said Mr. Holiday; \"then I am glad that you have come.\"  In obedience to this intimation, Rollo and Jane took care not to interrupt Mr. Holiday even to ask a question, but looked on and listened very patiently and attentively for nearly half an hour, while he pointed out to Mrs. Holiday the various routes, and ascertained from the guide books the times at which the trains set out, and the steamers sailed, for each of them, and also the cost of getting to Paris by the several lines. If the readers of this book were themselves actually in London, and were going to Paris, as Rollo and Jennie were, they would be interested, perhaps, in having all this information laid before them in full detail. As it is, however, all that will be necessary, probably, is to give such a general statement of the case as will enable them to understand the story.  By looking at any map of Europe, it will be seen that England is separated from France by the English Channel, a passage which, though it looks quite narrow on the map, is really very wide, especially toward the west. The narrowest place is between Dover and Calais, where the distance across is only about twenty-two miles. This narrow passage is called the Straits of Dover. It would have been very convenient for travellers that have to pass between London and Paris if this strait had happened to lie in the line, or nearly in the line, between these two cities; but it does not. It lies considerably to the eastward of it; so that, to cross the channel at the narrowest part, requires that the traveller should take quite a circuit round. To go by the shortest distance, it is necessary to cross the channel at a place where Dieppe is the harbor, on the French side, and New Haven on the English. There are other places of crossing, some of which are attended with one advantage, and others with another. In some, the harbors are not good, and the passengers have to go off in small boats, at certain times of tide, to get to the steamers. In others, the steamers leave only when the tide serves, which may happen to come at a very inconvenient hour. In a word, it is always quite a study with tourists, when they are ready to leave London for Paris, to determine by which of the various lines it will be best for their particular party, under the particular circumstances in which they are placed, to go.  After ascertaining all the facts very carefully, and all the advantages and disadvantages of each particular line, Mr. Holiday asked his wife what she thought they had better do.  \"The cheapest line is by the way of New Haven,\" said Mrs. Holiday.  \"That's of no consequence, I think, now,\" said Mr. Holiday. \"The difference is not very great.\"  \"For our whole party, it will make four or five pounds,\" said Mrs. Holiday.  \"Well,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"I am travelling to recover my health, and every thing must give way to that. If I can only get well, I can earn money fast enough, when I go home, to replace what we expend. The only question is, Which way will be the pleasantest and the most comfortable?\"  \"Then,\" said Mrs. Holiday, \"I think we had better go by the way of Dover and Calais, where we have the shortest passage by sea.\"  \"I think so too,\" said Mr. Holiday; \"so that point is settled.\"  \"Father,\" said Rollo, \"I wish you would let Jennie and me go to Paris by ourselves alone, some other way.\"  The reader who has perused the narrative of Rollo's voyage across the Atlantic will remember that, through a very peculiar combination of circumstances, he was left to make that voyage under his own charge, without having any one to take care of him. He was so much pleased with the result of that experiment, and was so proud of his success in acting as Jennie's protector, that he was quite desirous of trying such an experiment again.  \"O, no!\" said his father.  \"Why, father, I got along well enough in coming over,\" replied Rollo.  \"True,\" said his father; \"and if any accident, or any imperious necessity, should lead to your setting out for Paris without any escort, I have no doubt that you would get through safely. But it is one thing for a boy to be put into such a situation by some unforeseen and unexpected contingency, and quite another thing for his father deliberately to form such a plan for him.\"  Rollo looked a little disappointed, but he did not reply. In fact, he felt that his father was right.  \"But I'll tell you,\" added Mr. Holiday. \"If your uncle George is willing to go by some different route from ours, you may go with him.\"  \"And Jennie?\" inquired Rollo.  \"Why! Jennie?\" repeated Mr. Holiday, hesitating. \"Let me think. Yes, Jennie may go with you, if she pleases, if her mother is willing.\"  Jennie always called Mrs. Holiday her mother, although she was really her aunt.  \"Are you willing, mother,\" asked Rollo, very eagerly.  Mrs. Holiday was at a loss what to say. She was very desirous to please Rollo, and at the same time she wished very much to have Jennie go with her. However, she finally decided the question by saying that Jennie might go with whichever party she pleased.  Rollo's uncle George had not been long in England. He had come out from America some time after Rollo himself did, so that Rollo had not travelled with him a great deal. Mr. George was quite young, though he was a great deal older than Rollo--too old to be much of a companion for his nephew. Rollo liked him very much, because he was always kind to him; but there was no very great sympathy between them, for Mr. George was never much interested in such things as would please a boy. Besides, he was always very peremptory and decisive, though always just, in his treatment of Rollo, whenever he had him under his charge. Rollo was, however, very glad when his father consented that he and his uncle George might go to Paris together.  Mr. George was out that day, and he did not come home until Rollo had gone to bed. Rollo, however, saw him early the next morning, and told him what his father had said.  \"Well,\" said Mr. George, after hearing his story, \"and what do you propose that we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22956"],["title","Rollo in Paris (#1)"],["body"," do?\"  \"I propose that you, and Jennie, and I should go by the way of New Haven and Dieppe,\" replied Rollo.  \"Why?\" said Mr. George.  \"You see it is cheaper that way,\" said Rollo. \"We can go that way for twenty-four shillings. It costs two and three pounds by the other ways.\"  \"That's a consideration,\" said Mr. George.  \"For the pound you would save,\" said Rollo, \"you could buy a very handsome book in Paris.\"  Rollo suggested these considerations because he had often heard his uncle argue in this way before. He had himself another and a secret reason why he wished to go by the New Haven route; but we are all very apt, when giving reasons to others, to present such as we think will influence them, and not those which really influence us.  Mr. George looked into the guide book at the pages which Rollo pointed out, and found that it was really as Rollo had said.  \"Well,\" said he, \"I'll go that way with you.\"  So that was settled, too.  A short time after this conversation, Rollo's father and mother, and also Jennie, came in. Mr. Holiday rang the bell for the waiter to bring up breakfast. Jennie, when she found that it was really decided that her father and mother were to go one way, and her uncle George and Rollo another, was quite at a loss to determine which party she herself should join. She thought very justly that there would probably be more incident and adventure to be met with in going with Rollo; but then, on the other hand, she was extremely unwilling to be separated from her mother. She stood by her mother's side, leaning toward her in an attitude of confiding and affectionate attachment, while the others were talking about the details of the plan.  \"I rather think there is one thing that you have forgotten,\" said Mr. Holiday, \"and which, it strikes me, is a decided objection to your plan; and that is, that the steamer for to-morrow, from New Haven, leaves at midnight.\"  \"That's the very reason why I wanted to go that way,\" said Rollo.  \"Why, Rollo!\" exclaimed his mother.  \"Yes, mother,\" said Rollo. \"There would be so much fun in setting out at midnight. Think, Jennie!\" added Rollo, addressing his cousin, \"we should sit up till midnight! And then to see all the people going on board by the light of lanterns and torches. I wonder if there'll be a moon. Let's look in the almanac, and see if there'll be a moon.\"  \"But, George,\" said Mrs. Holiday, \"you will not wish to set off at midnight. I think you had better change your plan, after all.\"  But Mr. George did not seem to think that the midnight departure of the boat was any objection to the New Haven plan. He had noticed that that was the time set for leaving New Haven the next night, and he thought that, on the whole, the arrangement would suit his plans very well. He would have a good long evening to write up his journal, which he said was getting rather behindhand. The water, too, would be more likely to be smooth in the night, so that there would be less danger of seasickness. Besides, he thought that both Rollo and himself would become very sleepy by sitting up so late, and so would fall directly to sleep as soon as they got into their berths on board the steamer, and sleep quietly till they began to draw near to the coast of France. The distance across the channel, at that point, was such, that the steamer, in leaving at midnight, would not reach Dieppe till five or six o'clock the next morning.  Accordingly, the arrangements were all made for Rollo's departure the next day, with his uncle George, for New Haven. Jennie finally decided to go with her father and mother. The idea of sailing at midnight determined her; for such an adventure, attractive as it was in Rollo's eyes, seemed quite formidable in hers. Rollo had a very pleasant ride to New Haven, amusing himself all the way with the beauties of English scenery and the continual novelties that every where met his eye. When they at last arrived at New Haven, they found that the harbor consisted merely of a straight, artificial canal, cut in from the sea, where probably some small stream had originally issued. The sides of this harbor were lined with piers, and on one of the piers was a great hotel, forming a part, as it were, of the railway station. There were a few houses and other buildings near, but there was no town to be seen. The railway was on one side of the hotel, and the water was on the other. When the train stopped, one of the railway servants opened the door for Mr. George and Rollo to get out, and Mr. George went directly into the hotel to make arrangements for rooms and for dinner, while Rollo, eager to see the ships and the water, went through the house to the pier on the other side. He found that there was a pretty broad space on the pier, between the hotel and the water, with a shed upon it for merchandise, and extra tracks for freight trains. The water was quite low in the harbor, and the few vessels that were lying at the pier walls were mostly grounded in the mud. There was one steamboat lying opposite the hotel, but it was down so low that, at first, Rollo could only see the top of the smoke-pipe. Rollo went to the brink of the pier and looked down. The steamer appeared very small. It was painted black. There were very few people on board. Rollo had a great mind to go on board himself, as there was a plank leading down from the pier to the top of the paddle box. But it looked rather steep, and so Rollo concluded to postpone going on board till Mr. George should come out with him after dinner.  Rollo looked about upon the pier a few minutes, and then went into the hotel. He passed through a spacious hall, and then through a passage way, from which he could look into a large room, the sides of which were formed of glass, so that the people who were in the room could see out all around them. The front of the room looked out upon the pier, the back side upon the passage way. A third side was toward the vestibule, and the fourth toward the coffee room. There were shelves around this room, within, and tables, and desks, and people going to and fro there. In fact, it seemed to be the office of the hotel.  Rollo advanced to one of the openings that was toward the passage way, and asked which was the way to the coffee room. The girl pointed to the door which led to it, and Rollo went in.  He found a large and beautiful room, with several tables set for dinner in different parts of it, and sideboards covered with silver, and glasses against the walls. On one side there were several large and beautiful windows, which looked out upon the pier, and opposite to each of these windows was a small dinner table, large enough, however, for two persons. Mr. George had taken one of these tables, and when Rollo came in he was sitting near it, reading a newspaper.  \"Come, Rollo,\" said he, \"I have ordered dinner, and we shall just have time to arrange our accounts while they are getting it ready.\"  So saying, Mr. George took out his pocket book, and also a small pocket inkstand, and a pen, and put them all upon the table.  \"Your father's plan,\" he continued, \"is this: He is to pay all expenses of transportation, at the same rate that he pays for himself; so that, whatever you save by travelling in cheap ways, is your own.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, smiling, \"I mean to walk sometimes, and save it all.\"  \"He is also to pay the expense of your lodgings.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo.  \"Generally, of course, you will have lodgings with him, but sometimes you will be away from him; as, for instance, to-night. In such cases, I pay for your lodgings, on your father's account.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I understand that.\"  \"He also pays the expense of all casualties.\"  \"So he said,\" replied Rollo; \"but I don't understand what he means by that, very well.\"  \"Why, you may meet with accidents that will cost money to repair, or get into difficulties which will require money to get out of. For instance, you may lose your ticket, and so have to pay twice over; or you may get lost yourself, in Paris, and so have to hire a man with a carriage to bring you home. For all such things, the money is not to come from your purse. Your father will pay.\"  \"Suppose it is altogether my fault,\" said Rollo. \"Then I think I ought to pay.\"  \"But your father said that he was sure you would not be to blame for such accidents; though I think he is mistaken there. I have no doubt, myself, that nearly all the accidents that will happen to you will come from boyish heedlessness and blundering on your part.\"  \"We'll see,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"we'll see.\"  \"Then, as to your board,\" continued Mr. George, \"your father said that you might do as you pleased about that. He would pay it, or you might, and be allowed five francs a day for it.\"  \"Five francs is about a dollar, is it not?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" replied Mr. George, \"very nearly. But you had better not reckon by dollars, now, at all, but by francs altogether. That's a franc.\"  So saying, Mr. George took a silver coin out of his pocket, and showed it to Rollo. It was nearly as large as a quarter of a dollar, or an English shilling, but not quite. A quarter of a dollar is worth twenty-five cents, an English shilling twenty-four, and a franc about twenty cents.  \"You can have five of those a day to pay your own board with.\"  \"And how much would it cost me at a boarding house, in Paris, to pay my board?\" asked Rollo.  \"Why, we don't board at boarding houses in Paris,\" said Mr. George. \"We have rooms at a hotel, and then we get breakfast and dinner wherever we please, at coffee rooms and dining rooms all over the city, wherever we happen to be, or wherever we take a fancy to go. You can get a very excellent breakfast for a franc and a half. A beefsteak, or an omelet, and bread and butter and coffee.\"  \"That's enough for breakfast,\" said Rollo. \"And then, dinner?\"  \"You can get a first-rate dinner for two francs, or even less. That makes three francs and a half.\"  \"And tea?\"  \"They never "]]]
