Ten minutes later, however, the \"blimp\" was so close at hand that there could be no mistaking its identity. It belonged, beyond a question, to one of the squadrons of the Royal Naval Air Service.  \"Radio message from the 'blimp,' sir,\" called a messenger, darting from the doorway of the wireless room. \"Do you wish a written copy, sir?\"  Lieutenant Fernald glanced at Dave, who shook his head.  \"Let's have the message orally,\" Fernald called down to the deck.  \"'Blimp' wants to know, sir, if these two craft are the 'Grigsby' and 'Reed.'\"  \"Tell the operator to admit the fact,\" Fernald ordered.  \"Officer in charge of the 'blimp,' sir, says that he was to report and help you yesterday, but that the weather was too foggy.\"  \"Tell the operator to send back: 'Good morning. Glad to have you with us. Signature, Darrin,'\" Dave directed.  The seamen and petty officer at the anti-aircraft gun left their station. Straight onward came the \"blimp,\" dropping much lower just as it passed over. From the car beneath the big gas-bag several men leaned over to wave friendly hands, a greeting that was instantly responded to by Dave's and Dan's jackies, for the dirigible, after sailing over the \"Grigsby,\" turned and floated over the \"Reed.\"  \"Message from the 'blimp,' sir,\" again iterated the messenger on the deck. \"Message says: 'We're to keep near you and try to spot submarines for you.'\"  \"More power to your vision,\" was the message sent back by Dave.  \"You're working northward, toward the shoals?\" asked \"Blimp.\"  \"Yes,\" Darrin acknowledged.  \"That's a likely place to find one or two of the Hun pirates resting,\" \"Blimp\" continued.  \"Always a good hunting ground,\" Dave assented, in a radio message.  This took place while the dirigible was flying back and forth, ahead and astern, between the destroyers and to either side of their course.  \"It's a fine thing to be able to move at aircraft speed,\" said Lieutenant Fernald, rather enviously. \"If we could only make such speed, sir!\"  \"If we could build ships that would steam sixty to a hundred miles an hour, then the enemy could build them also,\" Dave returned. \"There would be little, if any, net gain for us. But if we could find the secret of doubling the speed of aircraft, and keep said secret from the boches, that would be an achievement that would soon end the war.\"  For ten miles the sweepers proceeded, with a total \"catch\" of only three mines, which must have been left-overs from other cruises. By this time the little fleet was approaching the nearest of the shoals, some three miles from shore.  \"Blimp\" was now well ahead, presently signalling back.  \"Found a sea-hornet for you, resting in the mud.\"  \"Good enough! We'll draw his sting,\" the \"Grigsby's\" radio reply promised.  Darrin caused a signal to be made to two of the mine-sweepers to come in close to him. The \"Reed\" still continued on her way further out.  Aircraft are of the greatest help in discovering submerged submarines. Depending on the altitude at which they fly, air observers are able to see, in reasonably smooth water, submarines that are moving at from eighty to a hundred feet beneath the surface. A submarine that is \"resting\" with her nose in the mud close to shore has more to fear from aircraft than from all other possible foes.  The aircraft men, though they can drop bombs upon such lurking craft, cannot do so with anything like the accuracy that is possible to the crews of vessels on the surface. Hence when aircraft and destroyers hunt together it is almost always left to the surface craft to give the \"grace blow\" to the resting submarine, as also to a submarine in motion beneath the waves.  As the \"blimp\" moved over the shoal in question a smoke bomb left the car and hovered almost motionless in the air, though briefly. This indicated that the submarine lay on the bottom directly underneath the smoke bomb.  \"And the commander of that Hun craft knows that we are approaching,\" Darrin commented, as the \"Grigsby\" raced roaringly forward. \"He can hear the noise of our propellers. If his engines are ready, he'll likely back off into deeper water.\"  Thrice more the \"blimp\" passed over the submarine that was invisible to surface eyes, and each time let loose a smoke bomb.  \"Now, you're directly in line,\" came the radio message from above. \"Move dead ahead. Will tell you when you are passing over. We'll signal the word 'drop'.\"  The meaning of \"drop\" would be clear enough. It would mean that the \"Grigsby\" was instantly to release, over the stern, a depth bomb.  As the \"Grigsby\" neared the spot speed was considerably reduced. Overhead hovered the \"blimp,\" ready for instant signalling of one word. The command had already been passed to the men stationed by the depth bomb to let go as soon as the messenger gave the word from the operator.  As Darrin glanced upward he saw the \"blimp\" nearly overhead.  Suddenly the messenger's startled voice roared out the message passed by the radio operator:  \"_Full speed astern!_\"  In the same instant Lieutenant Fernald repeated the order over the engine-room telegraph. There was a jolting jar as the \"Grigsby\" shivered, then glided back in her own wake.  \"Jove! That was a narrow squeak!\" came down from the sky. \"That hornet laid an egg in your path. It came within an ace of bumping your keel.\"  \"Never did speed pay a prompter profit, then,\" uttered Darrin, his cheeks paling slightly.  For the Englishman's laconic message meant that the submarine had just proved herself to be of the mine-laying variety. Further, the Hun craft, hearing the destroyer's propellers almost overhead, had judged the moment at which to let loose a mine, which, rising to its proper level under water, would have struck the hull of the advancing destroyer.  Had that happened, the career of the \"Grigsby\" would have been over, and several officers' and seamen's names would have been added to the war's list of dead.  \"Going to try again, sir?\" asked Lieutenant Fernald, quietly, as Dave himself changed the full-speed-astern order.  \"It's out of our line, I guess,\" Darrin confessed, with a smile. \"Signal yonder mine-sweeper to close in on the job.\"  As a result of the message, and aided by the \"blimp\" overhead, the snub-nosed mine-sweeper steamed into position. First, her wire sweeper picked up the mine that had been sprung for the \"Grigsby's\" undoing, and backed away.  Then, under Dave's further order, after the mine had been hoisted on board, the snub-nosed craft moved in with a different type of sweeper. To different wires of this implement were attached small but powerful contact bombs. Jauntily the snub-nosed craft moved over the lurking place of the submarine, and passed on ahead.  From the depths came muffled sounds, followed by a big and growing spread of oil on the water.  \"Enemy done for!\" signalled the \"blimp.\"  \"Thank you, sir. We know it,\" the \"Grigsby\" wirelessed back.  The mine-sweeper, having passed on ahead, now circled back, her crew grinning at sight of the mass of floating oil.  The contact bombs dangling from the sweep wires had struck against the submarine's hull and exploded, letting in the water at several points. The Hun seamen were even now drowning, caught without a show for their lives, just as they had probably sent many souls to graves in the ocean.  For some minutes more the dirigible moved back and forth through the air, her observers watching for the presence of hidden enemy craft. Then, without warning, came the message:  \"Sorry, but engine trouble threatens and will compel our return to land, and to our base if possible.\"  \"The best of luck to you,\" Dave ordered wirelessed back to these British comrades. \"We'll stand by until we're as close to shore as we can go.\"  For he knew that, near shore, the shoals became dangerous shallows at this point on the coast.  Away limped the \"blimp,\" the \"Grigsby\" following, and standing ready to do rescue work should the dirigible need assistance.  But the \"blimp\" not only made her way over to shore, but vanished slowly in the distance.  All of the mine-sweepers that had come up were ordered by signal to continue sweeping over the shoals.  \"I want to see more of this work personally,\" Dave told his executive officer, who was now to be left in command. \"Clear away one of the power launches. I'll take Mr. Ormsby with me.\"  So Dave was taken over to one of the mine-sweeping, snub-nosed craft that had formerly been a steam trawler on the Dogger Banks. The commanding officer, Hartley, proved most glad to welcome them.  \"We'll make you as comfortable as we can,\" promised Hartley.  \"Now, please don't do anything of the sort,\" Darry protested. \"Let us be mere spectators, or pupils, and have no fuss made over us. Instruct your men, if you'll be good enough, to omit salutes and to chat with us, if they have a chance, like comrades or pals. We want to see your real working ways, not a demonstration.\"  \"All right, then,\" sighed Mr. Hartley, and passed the orders.  \"When do you men sleep?\" Dave inquired of a sailor who paused to light a pipe as he stood well up in the bow.  \"When the blooming ship is hin dry-dock, sir,\" answered the British tar.  \"Don't you have regular watches?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"How long are the watches?\"  \"Usually twenty-four hours in each day, sir.\"  Darry laughed, for he knew no living man could stand working twenty-four hours a day for any length of time.  \"You were a trawler before you came into this branch of the service?\" Ormsby asked.  \"No, sir. Hi was a chimney sweep; that's wot made me good for this bally old business, sir.\"  \"You like this work?\" Ormsby next asked.  \"Yes, sir, hit's the next best thing to being killed, sir,\" was the solemn response.  \"Have you seen any mine-sweepers destroyed while at work?\"  Instantly the sailor dropped his bantering tone,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23036"],["title","Dave Darrin After the Mine Layers; Or, Hitting the Enemy a Hard Naval Blow (#8)"],["body","face becoming solemn in his expression.  \"You may well say that, sir,\" he answered. \"More mine-sweepers are lost than any other kind of naval craft.\"  \"Why is that?\"  \"Principally, sir, because we 'ave only a trawler's speed, and everything else that floats, including the National Debt, can overtake us.\"  \"Is there any scarcity of men for this sort of work?\" Ormsby queried.  \"No, sir, it's the 'eight hof a British sailorman's ambition, sir, to die early and be buried, sir, in water a mile deep. We fairly long for hit, sir.\"  \"Hedgeby!\" came, indignantly, from Mr. Hartley, who had approached unnoticed. \"What do you mean by chaffing these American officers so outrageously.\"  \"Must 'ave mistook my horders, sir,\" returned Hedgeby, saluting his commander. \"Some blooming bloke told as 'ow these gentlemen wanted to be treated like pals.\"  \"The fault is mine, I guess,\" admitted Mr. Hartley, turning to Darrin and Ormsby. \"These men are always chaffing each other, and they thought you wanted some of the same thing.\"  \"We don't object,\" Dave smiled. \"If hot air is the motive power that drives these men, then we want to sample it.\"  Hedgeby regarded this last speaker with a puzzled expression.  \"If you're talking about fuel, sir,\" he went on, as Mr. Hartley moved away, \"Hi'll say that 'ot air engines wouldn't be no good wotever on these 'ere craft. Gasoline is what we use, mostly, for our engines, sir, though some of the biggest use petroleum.\"  \"Hot air is furnished by the men themselves,\" Dave explained. \"It's a favorite fuel at sea.\"  \"Maybe, sir, maybe,\" admitted Hedgeby, slowly, looking as solemn as an owl. \"Of course you know, sir, wot's used on the Yankee boats, anyway, sir, and if your Admiralty recommends 'ot air then no doubt hit's because you Yankees know 'ow to use it better than other fuel.\"  \"And the joke of it is,\" muttered Ormsby, as Hedgeby sprang to obey an order, \"one can't tell whether a chap like that is laughing at us, or trying to sympathize with our ignorance.\"  Dave laughed, then soon forgot the chaffing, for he was greatly interested in what he saw of the work that was being carried on. Certainly, for such a comparatively slow craft, a large area of sea surface could be covered in a forenoon.  Presently Hedgeby came back to them, and Ormsby tried once more to extract some real information.  \"With the amount of speed you can command,\" he resumed, \"what does a craft like this do, Hedgeby, if a German destroyer comes racing along after you?\"  \"We just shut off speed, sir, and the blooming destroyer goes by so fast that nine times hout of ten she doesn't see us at all.\"  \"But if the destroyer sees you and stops to engage, what then?\"  Once more the quizzical expression faded from the British sailorman's eyes. He stepped back, resting one hand on a light gun mounted on a swivel pedestal.  \"We do hour best with this piece, sir.\"  \"An unequal combat, Hedgeby!\"  \"You may well say it, sir, but hat least we come hout of the fracas as well as does the submarine that our sweep locates on the bottom.\"  \"Have you known of any case in which a mine-sweeper had any show at all against a German destroyer?\"  \"Yes, sir; this very craft was the boat, sir. The destroyer 'eld 'er fire and come hup close, sir, to 'ave fun teasing us. Only one shot we fired, sir, from our after gun, at the houtset, sir, but that one shot carried away the destroyer's rudder just below the water line. It was hall a piece of luck, sir.\"  \"And then?\" pressed Ormsby, for at last Hedgeby seemed to be imparting real information.  \"Well, of course, sir, the 'Uns started hin at once to rig a jury rudder with timbers and canvas.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Naturally, sir, we didn't give 'em any time or chance we could 'elp, sir. We sailed round and round 'er, taking position so that we could play both guns on 'er at the same time. She couldn't steer, sir, to back 'er aim, that 'ere 'Un, so we banged away at 'er stacks and her water line until she was worse than 'elpless.\"  \"Did you sink her?\"  \"No, sir. She was captured.\"  \"By whom?\"  \"By two of 'is majesty's destroyers, sir, that came up. And maybe you think Hi'm joking, sir, w'en Hi tell you that the destroyers were credited with the capture because they made the 'Un strike 'is colors and take a prize crew.\"  Subsequently Dave and Ormsby learned from Mr. Hartley that this account was a true one.  \"But we got a bit of credit in the public press,\" Hartley added, modestly.  Right after that it was reported that one of the wire sweeps had located a bomb. Instantly several men were rushed to aid in landing the prize. Dave and Ormsby hurried to join the group and watch a mine being taken aboard.  On account of its weight the deadly thing was handled by tackle. Carefully the men proceeded to hoist the mine aboard.  \"You'll note the little horns standing out from the top of the mine,\" explained Mr. Hartley, pointing to the circular mine. \"These horns are usually called studs. Hit one of these studs even a light blow with a tack hammer, gentlemen, and the mine would explode. A mine like this is more deadly than the biggest shell carried by a super-dreadnaught. Let this mine explode, for instance, under our hull forward, and it would tear us to pieces in a way that would leave us afloat for hardly sixty seconds. Moreover, it would kill any man standing at or near the rail over the point of contact.\"  He had no more than finished speaking, while the mine was being hoisted aboard, than a terrified gasp escaped the workers.  For the mine slipped from its tackle, and slipped back toward the water, striking the side hull in its downward course!  Dave Darrin did not move. He knew there would not be time to escape!     CHAPTER VI  IN THE TEETH OF THE CHANNEL GALE   SPLASH!  The mine sank below the surface.  A quick turn by the helmsman at the wheel, and the course changed violently on the instant.  \"No stud struck or scraped the side as the mine went down!\" exclaimed Mr. Hartley, in a voice as cool as though he were discussing the weather. \"That was what saved us.\"  \"That, and the presence of mind displayed by your man at the wheel,\" Dave calmly supplemented. \"That quick turn of the wheel saved your hull under the water line from striking against the infernal thing.\"  \"I thought we were goners!\" exclaimed Ormsby.  \"So did I,\" Dave nodded, \"until I saw the thing sink and then realized how prompt the helmsman had been to act without orders.\"  \"The helmsman's act was almost routine,\" Hartley continued. \"On a craft like this every man instinctively knows what should be done in any moment of escapable peril.\"  Dave now withdrew the elbow which, up to now, he had leaned against the rail. He knew that he had been within a hair's breadth of instant death, but there was nothing in his bearing to betray the fact.  Hartley quickly gave the order to put about.  \"Another try for that slippery customer, eh?\" queried Ormsby.  \"I'd feel like a murderer, if I knowingly left that thing in the sea, to destroy some fine craft,\" declared Mr. Hartley, gravely. \"Once we've located a mine we never leave it. We'll make the 'catch' again, but we'll inspect our tackle before we try to take it aboard. I think you gentlemen had better step back well out of the way.\"  \"Of course we will, sir, if we are really in the way,\" Darrin smiled.  \"You're not in our way,\" Hartley promptly denied. \"But you will hardly care, should the tackle still be defective, to be loitering at the point of danger.\"  \"I want to see you repair the tackle,\" Dave replied. \"Then I want to see you make the grapple again and bring the mine safely on board.\"  \"All right, gentlemen, if you love danger well enough to take the risk twice when you're only spectators,\" Hartley answered, with a shrug of his shoulders.  Again the mine was caught, grappled, and this time successfully hoisted on board.  All of this Darrin and his junior officer noted carefully, even giving a hand at the work.  Through the day at least one of the mine-sweepers continued over this line of shoal, trying constantly with the sweeps. Farther out to sea Dalzell and the \"Reed\" accompanied others of the craft. By nightfall it was reported that more than sixty mines had been picked up.  \"The mine-layers must be actively at work in these waters,\" said Dave. \"Undoubtedly they plant the mines at night, then toward daylight move in toward the shoal and hide there during the day. We'll try that shoal again after daylight to-morrow morning--weather permitting.\"  This last Darrin said because there were now lurking indications of a coming storm. Dave returned to his own craft in time.  By nine o'clock that night, or an hour after the new watch had gone on, the wind was howling through the rigging in a way that made conversation difficult on the bridge.  \"Mr. Fernald, at the rate the weather is thickening I shall be on the bridge all night. I shall be glad, therefore, if after your last rounds of the ship, and after you have turned in your report, you will seek your berth and get all the sleep you can until you're called.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" agreed the executive officer.  He would have liked to stand watch in Darrin's place, but he knew that, with a gale coming, Darrin would not consent.  By this time the destroyer was rolling at such an angle that the order was passed for the life-lines. Soon after that a second order was issued that all men on outside duty must don life-belts. Even up on the bridge, with an abundance of hand-holds, Dave and Ensign Andrews wore the belts.  With a nearly head wind from the northeast the \"Grigsby\" labored in the running seas, spray dashing over the bridge and against the rubber coats and sou'westers of the two officers. Below, on the deck, the water was sometimes several inches deep, gorging the scuppers in its flow overboard. Officers and men alike wore rubber boots.  \"All secure, sir,\" reported Lieutenant Fernald, returning after his last rounds. \"A nasty time you'll have of it, sir, to-night.\"  "]]]
