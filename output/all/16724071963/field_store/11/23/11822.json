It hit him full in the back, and he stumbled forward a couple of steps before regaining his balance.  A clear contralto voice said: \"Oh! I'm _so_ sorry!\"  It was the same voice as the robot's!  Mike the Angel swung around to face the second robot.  This time it was a lady.  \"I'm sorry,\" she repeated. She was all wrapped up in an electroparka, but there was no mistaking the fact that she was both human and feminine. She came on through the door and looked at the robot. \"Snookums! What are you doing here?\"  \"I was trying an experiment, Leda,\" said Snookums. \"This man was just asking me about it. I just wanted to see if he would come if I called 'help.' He did, and I want to know _why_ he did.\"  The girl flashed a look at Mike. \"Would you please tell Snookums why you went out there? Please--don't be angry or anything--just tell him.\"  Mike was beginning to get the picture. \"I went because I thought I heard a human being calling for help--and it sounded suspiciously like a woman.\"  \"Oh,\" said Snookums, sounding a little downhearted--if a robot can be said to have a heart. \"The reaction was based, then, upon a misconception. That makes the data invalid. I'll have to try again.\"  \"That won't be necessary, Snookums,\" the girl said firmly. \"This man went out there because he thought a human life was in danger. He would not have done it if he had known it was you, because he would have known that you were not in any danger. You can stand much lower temperatures than a human being can, you know.\" She turned to Mike. \"Am I correct in saying that you wouldn't have gone out there if you'd known Snookums was a robot?\"  \"Absolutely correct,\" said Mike the Angel fervently.  She looked back at Snookums. \"Don't try that experiment again. It is dangerous for a human to go out there, even with an electroparka. You might run the risk of endangering human life.\"  \"Oh dear!\" said Snookums. \"I'm sorry, Leda!\" There was real anxiety in the voice.  \"That's all right, honey,\" the girl said hurriedly. \"This man isn't hurt, so don't get upset. Come along now, and we'll go back to the lab. You shouldn't come out like this without permission.\"  Mike had noticed that the girl had kept one hand on her belt all the time she was talking--and that her thumb was holding down a small button on a case attached to the belt.  He had been wondering why, but he didn't have to wonder long.  The door behind him opened again, and four men came out, obviously in a devil of a hurry. Each one of them was wearing a brassard labeled SECURITY POLICE.  _At least_, thought Mike the Angel as he turned to look them over, _the brassards aren't in all lower-case italics_.  One of them jerked a thumb at Mike. \"This the guy, Miss Crannon?\"  The girl nodded. \"That's him. He saw Snookums. Take care of him.\" She looked again at Mike. \"I'm terribly sorry, really I am. But there's no help for it.\" Then, without another word, she opened the door and went back inside, and the robot rolled in after her.  As the door closed behind her, the SP man nearest Mike, a tough-looking bozo wearing an ensign's insignia, said: \"Let's see your identification.\"  Mike realized that his own parka had no insignia of rank on it, but he didn't like the SP man's tone.  \"Come on!\" snapped the ensign. \"Who are you?\"  Mike the Angel pulled out his ID card and handed it to the security cop. \"It tells right there who I am,\" he said. \"That is, if you can read.\"  The man glared and jerked the card out of Mike's hand, but when he saw the emblem that Lieutenant Nariaki had stamped on it, his eyes widened. He looked up at Mike. \"I'm sorry, sir; I didn't mean--\"  \"That tears it,\" interrupted Mike. \"That absolutely tears it. In the past three minutes I have been apologized to by a woman, a robot, and a cop. The next thing, a penguin will walk in here, tip his top hat, and abase himself while he mutters obsequiously in penguinese. Just what the devil is going _on_ around this place?\"  The four SP men were trying hard not to fidget.  \"Just security precautions, sir,\" said the ensign uncomfortably. \"Nobody but those connected with Project Brainchild are supposed to know about Snookums. If anyone else finds out, we're supposed to take them into protective custody.\"  \"I'll bet you're widely loved for that,\" said Mike. \"I suppose the gadget at Miss What's-her-name's belt was an alarm to warn you of impending disaster?\"  \"Miss Crannon.... Yes, sir. Everybody on the project carries those around. Also, Miss Crannon carries a detector for following Snookums around. She's sort of his keeper, you know.\"  \"No,\" said Mike the Angel, \"I do not know. But I intend to find out. I'm looking for Captain Quill; where is he?\"  The four men looked at each other, then looked back at Mike.  \"I don't know, Commander,\" said the ensign. \"I understand that several new men have come in today, but I don't know all of them. You'd better talk to Dr. Fitzhugh.\"  \"Such are the beauties of security,\" said Mike the Angel. \"Where can I find this Dr. Fitzhugh?\"  The security man looked at his wrist watch. \"He's down in the cafeteria now, sir. It's coffee time, and Doc Fitzhugh is as regular as a satellite orbit.\"  \"I'm glad you didn't say 'clockwork,'\" Mike told him. \"I've had enough dealings with machines today. Where is this coffee haven?\"  The ensign gave directions for reaching the cafeteria, and Mike pushed open the door marked _entrance_. He had to pass through another inner door guarded by another pair of SP men who checked his ID card again, then he had to ramble through hallways that went off at queer angles to each other, but he finally found the cafeteria.  He nabbed the first passer-by and asked him to point out Dr. Fitzhugh. The passer-by was obliging; he indicated a smallish, elderly man who was sitting by himself at one of the tables.  Mike made his way through the tray-carrying hordes that were milling about, and finally ended up at the table where the smallish man was sitting.  \"Dr. Fitzhugh?\" Mike offered his hand. \"I'm Commander Gabriel. Minister Wallingford appointed me Engineering Officer of the _Branchell_.\"  Dr. Fitzhugh shook Mike's hand with apparent pleasure. \"Oh yes. Sit down, Commander. What can I do for you?\"  Mike had already peeled off his electroparka. He hung it over the back of a chair and said: \"Mind if I grab a cup of coffee, Doctor? I've just come from topside, and I think the cold has made its way clean to my bones.\" He paused. \"Would you like another cup?\"  Dr. Fitzhugh looked at his watch. \"I have time for one more, thanks.\"  By the time Mike had returned with the cups, he had recalled where he had heard the name Fitzhugh before.  \"It just occurred to me,\" he said as he sat down. \"You must be Dr. _Morris_ Fitzhugh.\"  Fitzhugh nodded. \"That's right.\" He wore a perpetually worried look, which made his face look more wrinkled than his fifty years of age would normally have accounted for. Mike was privately of the opinion that if Fitzhugh ever really _tried_ to look worried, his ears would meet over the bridge of his long nose.  \"I've read a couple of your articles in the _Journal_,\" Mike explained, \"but I didn't connect the name until I saw you. I recognized you from your picture.\"  Fitzhugh smiled, which merely served to wrinkle his face even more.  Mike the Angel spent the next several minutes feeling the man out, then he went on to explain what had happened with Snookums out in the foyer, which launched Dr. Fitzhugh into an explanation.  \"He didn't want help, of course; he was merely conducting an experiment. There are many areas of knowledge in which he is as naïve as a child.\"  Mike nodded. \"It figures. At first I thought he was just a remote-control tool, but I finally saw that he was a real, honest-to-goodness robot. Who gave him the idea to make such an experiment as that?\"  \"No one at all,\" said Dr. Fitzhugh. \"He's built to make up his own experiments.\"  Mike the Angel's classic face regarded the wrinkled one of Dr. Fitzhugh. \"His own experiments? But a robot--\"  Fitzhugh held up a bony hand, gesturing for attention and silence. He got it from Mike.  \"Snookums,\" he said, \"is no ordinary robot, Commander.\"  Mike waited for more. When none came, he said: \"So I gather.\" He sipped at his black coffee. \"That machine I saw is actually a remote-control tool, isn't it? Snookums' actual brain is in Cargo Hold One of the _William Branchell_.\"  \"That's right.\" Dr. Fitzhugh began reaching into various pockets about his person. He extracted a tobacco pouch, a briar pipe, and a jet-flame lighter. Then he began speaking as he went through the pipe smoker's ritual of filling, tamping, and lighting.  \"Snookums,\" he began, \"is a self-activating, problem-seeking computer with input and output sensory and action mechanisms analogous to those of a human being.\" He pushed more tobacco into the bowl of his pipe with a bony forefinger. \"He's as close to being a living creature as anything Man has yet devised.\"  \"What about the synthecells they're making at Boston Med?\" Mike asked, looking innocent.  Fitzhugh's contour-map face wrinkled up even more. \"I should have said 'living _intelligence_,'\" he corrected himself. \"He's a true robot, in the old original sense of the word; an artificial entity that displays almost every function of a living, intelligent creature. And, at the same time, he has the accuracy and speed that is normal to a cryotron computer.\"  Mike the Angel said nothing while Fitzhugh fired up his lighter and directed the jet of flame into the bowl and puffed up great clouds of smoke which obscured his face.  While the roboticist puffed, Mike let his gaze wander idly over the other people in the cafeteria. He was wondering how much longer he could talk to Fitzhugh before Captain Quill began--  And then he saw the redhead.  There is never much point in describing a really beautiful girl.

Beatrice Pearse        [Illustration: The Queen came in most splendidly dressed p. 27]   THE MAGIC FISHBONE  A Holiday Romance from the Pen of Miss Alice Rainbird Aged 7.  by  CHARLES DICKENS    London: Constable and Co. Ltd.     FOREWORD   The story contained herein was written by Charles Dickens in 1867. It is the second of four stories entitled \"Holiday Romance\" and was published originally in a children's magazine in America. It purports to be written by a child aged seven. It was republished in England in \"All the Year Round\" in 1868. For this and four other Christmas pieces Dickens received £1,000.  \"Holiday Romance\" was published in book form by Messrs Chapman & Hall in 1874, with \"Edwin Drood\" and other stories.  For this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in \"All the Year Round\" has been followed.                   *       *       *       *       *   [Illustration: SEVERAL OF THE CHILDREN WERE GROWING OUT OF THEIR CLOTHES]  There was once a King, and he had a Queen; and he was the manliest of his sex, and she was the loveliest of hers. The King was, in his private profession, Under Government. The Queen's father had been a medical man out of town.  They had nineteen children, and were always having more. Seventeen of these children took care of the baby; and Alicia, the eldest, took care of them all. Their ages varied from seven years to seven months.  Let us now resume our story.  One day the King was going to the office, when he stopped at the fishmonger's to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail, which the Queen (who was a careful housekeeper) had requested him to send home. Mr Pickles, the fishmonger, said, \"Certainly, sir, is there any other article, Good-morning.\"  The King went on towards the office in a melancholy mood, for quarter day was such a long way off, and several of the dear children were growing out of their clothes. He had not proceeded far, when Mr Pickles's errand-boy came running after him, and said, \"Sir, you didn't notice the old lady in our shop.\"  \"What old lady?\" enquired the King. \"I saw none.\"  Now, the King had not seen any old lady, because this old lady had been invisible to him, though visible to Mr Pickles's boy. Probably because he messed and splashed the water about to that degree, and flopped the pairs of soles down in that violent manner, that, if she had not been visible to him, he would have spoilt her clothes.  Just then the old lady came trotting up. She was dressed in shot-silk of the richest quality, smelling of dried lavender.  \"King Watkins the First, I believe?\" said the old lady.  \"Watkins,\" replied the King, \"is my name.\"  \"Papa, if I am not mistaken, of the beautiful Princess Alicia?\" said the old lady.  \"And of eighteen other darlings,\" replied the King.  \"Listen. You are going to the office,\" said the old lady.  It instantly flashed upon the King that she must be a Fairy, or how could she know that?  \"You are right,\" said the old lady, answering his thoughts, \"I am the Good Fairy Grandmarina. Attend. When you return home to dinner, politely invite the Princess Alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now.\"  \"It may disagree with her,\" said the King.  The old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea, that the King was quite alarmed, and humbly begged her pardon.  \"We hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing, and that thing disagreeing,\" said the old lady, with the greatest contempt it was possible to express. \"Don't be greedy. I think you want it all yourself.\"  The King hung his head under this reproof, and said he wouldn't talk about things disagreeing, any more.  \"Be good, then,\" said the Fairy Grandmarina, \"and don't! When the beautiful Princess Alicia consents to partake of the salmon--as I think she will--you will find she will leave a fish-bone on her plate. Tell her to dry it, and to rub it, and to polish it till it shines like mother-of-pearl, and to take care of it as a present from me.\"  \"Is that all?\" asked the King.  \"Don't be impatient, sir,\" returned the Fairy Grandmarina, scolding him severely. \"Don't catch people short, before they have done speaking. Just the way with you grown-up persons. You are always doing it.\"  The King again hung his head, and said he wouldn't do so any more.  \"Be good then,\" said the Fairy Grandmarina, \"and don't! Tell the Princess Alicia, with my love, that the fish-bone is a magic present which can only be used once; but that it will bring her, that once, whatever she wishes for, PROVIDED SHE WISHES FOR IT AT THE RIGHT TIME. That is the message. Take care of it.\"  [Illustration: HOITY TOITY ME!]  The King was beginning, \"Might I ask the reason--?\" when the Fairy became absolutely furious.  \"_Will_ you be good, sir?\" she exclaimed, stamping her foot on the ground. \"The reason for this, and the reason for that, indeed! You are always wanting the reason. No reason. There! Hoity toity me! I am sick of your grown-up reasons.\"  The King was extremely frightened by the old lady's flying into such a passion, and said he was very sorry to have offended her, and he wouldn't ask for reasons any more.  \"Be good then,\" said the old lady, \"and don't!\"  With those words, Grandmarina vanished, and the King went on and on and on, till he came to the office. There he wrote and wrote and wrote, till it was time to go home again. Then he politely invited the Princess Alicia, as the Fairy had directed him, to partake of the salmon. And when she had enjoyed it very much, he saw the fish-bone on her plate, as the Fairy had told him he would, and he delivered the Fairy's message, and the Princess Alicia took care to dry the bone, and to rub it, and to polish it till it shone like mother-of-pearl.  [Illustration: He saw the Fish-bone on her Plate]  And so when the Queen was going to get up in the morning, she said, \"O, dear me, dear me; my head, my head!\" and then she fainted away.  The Princess Alicia, who happened to be looking in at the chamber-door, asking about breakfast, was very much alarmed when she saw her Royal Mamma in this state, and she rang the bell for Peggy, which was the name of the Lord Chamberlain. But remembering where the smelling-bottle was, she climbed on a chair and got it, and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside and held the smelling-bottle to the Queen's nose, and after that she jumped down and got some water, and after that she jumped up again and wetted the Queen's forehead, and, in short, when the Lord Chamberlain came in, that dear old woman said to the little Princess, \"What a Trot you are! I couldn't have done it better myself!\"  [Illustration]  But that was not the worst of the good Queen's illness. O, no! She was very ill indeed, for a long time. The Princess Alicia kept the seventeen young Princes and Princesses quiet, and dressed and undressed and danced the baby, and made the kettle boil, and heated the soup, and swept the hearth, and poured out the medicine, and nursed the Queen, and did all that ever she could, and was as busy busy busy, as busy could be. For there were not many servants at that Palace, for three reasons; because the King was short of money, because a rise in his office never seemed to come, and because quarter day was so far off that it looked almost as far off and as little as one of the stars.  But on the morning when the Queen fainted away, where was the magic fish-bone? Why, there it was in the Princess Alicia's pocket. She had almost taken it out to bring the Queen to life again, when she put it back, and looked for the smelling-bottle.  After the Queen had come out of her swoon that morning, and was dozing, the Princess Alicia hurried up-stairs to tell a most particular secret to a most particularly confidential friend of hers, who was a Duchess. People did suppose her to be a Doll; but she was really a Duchess, though nobody knew it except the Princess.  [Illustration]  This most particular secret was a secret about the magic fish-bone, the history of which was well known to the Duchess, because the Princess told her everything. The Princess kneeled down by the bed on which the Duchess was lying, full-dressed and wide awake, and whispered the secret to her. The Duchess smiled and nodded. People might have supposed that she never smiled and nodded, but she often did, though nobody knew it except the Princess.  Then the Princess Alicia hurried downstairs again, to keep watch in the Queen's room. She often kept watch by herself in the Queen's room; but every evening, while the illness lasted, she sat there watching with the King. And every evening the King sat looking at her with a cross look, wondering why she never brought out the magic fish-bone. As often as she noticed this, she ran up-stairs, whispered the secret to the Duchess over again, and said to the Duchess besides, \"They think we children never have a reason or a meaning!\" And the Duchess, though the most fashionable Duchess that ever was heard of, winked her eye.  \"Alicia,\" said the King, one evening when she wished him Good Night.  \"Yes, Papa.\"  \"What is become of the magic fish-bone?\"  \"In my pocket, Papa.\"  \"I thought you had lost it?\"  \"O, no, Papa.\"  \"Or forgotten it?\"  \"No, indeed, Papa.\"  And so another time the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door made a rush at one of the young Princes as "]]]
