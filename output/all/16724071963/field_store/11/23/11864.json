One of the curious results of this flood was that Bob was always more prompt to the summons to haul up the trawl than he had ever been before, more energetic in clawing the net inboard, and more eager to see and examine the contents of the cod-end.  The explanation is simple.  He had overheard his skipper say how fond Eve was of shells--especially of those which came from the bottom of the North Sea, and of all sorts of pretty and curious things, wherever they came from.  From that hour Bob Lumpy became a diligent collector of marine curiosities, and the very small particular corner of the vessel which he called his own became ere long quite a museum.  They say that sympathy is apt to grow stronger between persons of opposite constitutions.  If this be so, perhaps it was his nature--his bold, hearty, gushing, skylarking spirit, his strong rugged frame, his robust health, his carroty hair, his appley cheeks, his eagle nose, his flashing eyes--that drew him so powerfully to the helpless, tender little invalid, with her delicate frame and pale cheeks, straight little nose, bud of a mouth, and timid, though by no means cowardly, spirit.  On another occasion Bob overheard Lockley again talking about Eve.  \"I'm sorry for the poor thing,\" he said to Peter Jay, as they paced the deck together; \"she's got such a wretched home, an' her mother's such a drunken bru--\"  Lockley checked himself, and did not finish the sentence.  \"The doctor says,\" he resumed, \"that if Eve had only a bath-chair or suthin' o' that sort, to get wheeled about in the fresh air, she'd very likely get better as she growed older--specially if she had good victuals.  You see, small as she is, and young as she looks, she's over fifteen.  But even if she had the chair, poor thing! who would wheel it for her?  It would be no use unless it was done regular, an' her mother can't do it--or won't.\"  From that hour Bob Lumpy became a miser.  He had been a smoker like the rest of the crew, but he gave up \"baccy.\"  He used to take an occasional glass of beer or spirits when on shore or on board the _copers_, but he became a total abstainer, much to his own benefit in every way, and as a result he became rich--in an extremely small way.  There was a very small, thin, and dirty, but lively and intelligent boy in Yarmouth, who loved Bob Lumsden better, if possible, than himself. His name was Pat Stiver.  The affection was mutual.  Bob took this boy into his confidence.  One day, a considerable time after Bob's discovery of Eve, Pat, having nothing to do, sauntered to the end of Gorleston Pier, and there to his inexpressible joy, met his friend.  Before he had recovered sufficiently from surprise to utter a word, Bob seized him by the arms, lifted him up, and shook him.  \"Take care, Lumpy,\" cried the boy, \"I'm wery tender, like an over-young chicken.  You'd better set me down before I comes in pieces.\"  \"Why, Stiver, you're the very man I was thinkin' of,\" said Lumpy, setting the boy on the edge of the pier, and sitting down beside him.  Stiver looked proud, and felt six inches taller.  \"Listen,\" said Bob, with an earnest look that was apt to captivate his friends; \"I want help.  Will you do somethin' for me?\"  \"Anything,\" replied the boy with emphasis, \"from pitch and toss to manslaughter!\"  \"Well, look here.  You know Eve Mooney?\"  \"Do I know the blessedest angel in all Gorleston?  In course I does. Wot of her?\"  \"She's ill--very ill,\" said Lumpy.  \"You might as well tell me, when it's daytime, that the sun's up,\" returned Pat.  \"Don't be so awful sharp, Stiver, else I'll have to snub you.\"  \"Which you've on'y got to frown, Bob Lumpy, an' the deed's done.\"  Bob gave a short laugh, and then proceeded to explain matters to his friend: how he had been saving up his wages for some time past to buy a second-hand bath-chair for Eve, because the doctor had said it would do her so much good, especially if backed up with good victuals.  \"It's the wittles as bothers me, Stiver,\" said Bob, regarding his friend with a puzzled expression.  \"H'm! well,\" returned the small boy seriously, \"wittles has bothered me too, off an' on, pretty well since I was born, though I'm bound to confess I does get a full blow-out now an'--\"  \"Hold on, Stiver; you're away on the wrong tack,\" cried Bob, interrupting.  \"I don't mean the difficulty o' findin' wittles, but how to get Eve to take 'em.\"  \"Tell her to shut her eyes an' open her mouth, an' then shove 'em in,\" suggested Pat.  \"I'll shove you into the sea if you go on talking balderdash,\" said Bob. \"Now, look here, you hain't got nothin' to do, have you!\"  \"If you mean in the way o' my purfession, Bob, you're right.  I purfess to do anything, but nobody as yet has axed me to do nothin'.  In the ways o' huntin' up wittles, howsever, I've plenty to do.  It's hard lines, and yet I ain't extravagant in my expectations.  Most coves require three good meals a day, w'ereas I'm content with one.  I begins at breakfast, an' I goes on a-eatin' promiskoously all day till arter supper--w'en I can get it.\"  \"Just so, Stiver.  Now, I want to engage you professionally.  Your dooties will be to hang about Mrs Mooney's, but in an offhand, careless sort o' way, like them superintendent chaps as git five or six hundred a year for doin' nuffin, an' be ready at any time to offer to give Eve a shove in the chair.  But first you'll have to take the chair to her, an' say it was sent to her from--\"  \"Robert Lumsden, Esquire,\" said Pat, seeing that his friend hesitated.  \"Not at all, you little idiot,\" said Bob sharply.  \"You mustn't mention my name on no account.\"  \"From a gentleman, then,\" suggested Pat.  \"That might do; but I ain't a gentleman, Stiver, an' I can't allow you to go an' tell lies.\"  \"I'd like to know who is if you ain't,\" returned the boy indignantly. \"Ain't a gentleman a man wot's gentle?  An' w'en you was the other day a-spreadin' of them lovely shells, an' crabs, an' sea-goin' kooriosities out on her pocket-hankercher, didn't I _see_ that you was gentle?\"  \"I'll be pretty rough on you, Pat, in a minit, if you don't hold your jaw,\" interrupted Bob, who, however, did not seem displeased with his friend's definition of a gentleman.  \"Well, you may say what you like, only be sure you say what's true.  An' then you'll have to take some nice things as I'll get for her from time to time w'en I comes ashore. But there'll be difficulties, I doubt, in the way of gettin' her to take wittles w'en she don't know who they comes from.\"  \"Oh, don't you bother your head about that,\" said Pat.  \"I'll manage it. I'm used to difficulties.  Just you leave it to me, an' it'll be all right.\"  \"Well, I will, Pat; so you'll come round with me to the old furnitur' shop in Yarmouth, an' fetch the chair.  I got it awful cheap from the old chap as keeps the shop w'en I told him what it was for.  Then you'll bring it out to Eve, an' try to git her to have a ride in it to-day, if you can.  I'll see about the wittles arter.  Hain't quite worked that out in my mind yet.  Now, as to wages.  I fear I can't offer you none--\"  \"I never axed for none,\" retorted Pat proudly.  \"That's true Pat; but I'm not a-goin' to make you slave for nuthin'. I'll just promise you that I'll save all I can o' my wages, an' give you what I can spare.  You'll just have to trust me as to that.\"  \"Trust you, Bob!\" exclaimed Pat, with enthusiasm, \"look here, now; this is how the wind blows.  If the Prime Minister o' Rooshia was to come to me in full regimentals an' offer to make me capting o' the Horse Marines to the Hemperor, I'd say, `No thankee, I'm engaged,' as the young woman said to the young man she didn't want to marry.\"  The matter being thus satisfactorily settled, Bob Lumsden and his little friend went off to Yarmouth, intent on carrying out the first part of their plan.  It chanced about the same time that another couple were having a quiet chat together in the neighbourhood of Gorleston Pier.  Fred Martin and Isa Wentworth had met by appointment to talk over a subject of peculiar interest to themselves.  Let us approach and become eavesdroppers.  \"Now, Fred,\" said Isa, with a good deal of decision in her tone, \"I'm not at all satisfied with your explanation.  These mysterious and long visits you make to London ought to be accounted for, and as I have agreed to become your wife within the next three or four months, just to please _you_, the least you can do, I think, is to have no secrets from _me_.  Besides, you have no idea what the people here and your former shipmates are saying about you.\"  \"Indeed, dear lass, what do they say?\"  \"Well, they say now you've got well they can't understand why you should go loafing about doin' nothin' or idling your time in London, instead of goin' to sea.\"  \"Idlin' my time!\" exclaimed Fred with affected indignation.  \"How do they know I'm idlin' my time?  What if I was studyin' to be a doctor or a parson?\"  \"Perhaps they'd say that _was_ idlin' your time, seein' that you're only a fisherman,\" returned Isa, looking up in her lover's face with a bright smile.  \"But tell me, Fred, why should you have any secret from _me_?\"  \"Because, dear lass, the thing that gives me so much pleasure and hope is not absolutely fixed, and I don't want you to be made anxious.  This much I will tell you, however: you know I passed my examination for skipper when I was home last time, and now, through God's goodness, I have been offered the command of a smack.  If all goes well, I hope to sail in her next week; then, on my return, I hope to--to take the happiest.  Well, well, I'll say no more about that, as we're gettin' near mother's door.  But tell me, Isa, has Uncle Martin been worrying mother again when I was away?\"  \"No.  When he found out that you had got the money that was left to her, and had bought an annuity for her with it,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23377"],["title","The Lively Poll: A Tale of the North Sea (#8)"],["body"," he went away, and I've not seen him since.\"  \"That's well.  I'm glad of that.\"  \"But am I to hear nothing more about this smack, not even her name?\"  \"Nothing more just now, Isa.  As to her name, it's not yet fixed.  But, trust me, you shall know all in good time.\"  As they had now reached the foot of Mrs Martin's stair, the subject was dropped.  They found the good woman in the act of supplying Granny Martin with a cup of tea.  There was obvious improvement in the attic.  Sundry little articles of luxury were there which had not been there before.  \"You see, my boy,\" said Mrs Martin to Fred, as they sat round the social board, \"now that the Lord has sent me enough to get along without slavin' as I used--to do, I takes more time to make granny comfortable, an' I've got her a noo chair, and noo specs, which she was much in want of, for the old uns was scratched to that extent you could hardly see through 'em, besides bein' cracked across both eyes.  Ain't they much better, dear?\"  The old woman, seated in the attic window, turned her head towards the tea-table and nodded benignantly once or twice; but the kind look soon faded into the wonted air of patient contentment, and the old head turned to the sea as the needle turns to the pole, and the soft murmur was heard, \"He'll come soon now.\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  A RESCUE.  Never was there a fishing smack more inappropriately named than the _Fairy_,--that unwieldy iron vessel which the fleet, in facetious content, had dubbed the \"Ironclad,\" and which had the honour of being commanded by that free and easy, sociable--almost too sociable--skipper, Ned Bryce.  She was steered by Dick Martin on the day of which we now write.  Dick, as he stood at the helm, with stern visage, bloodshot eyes, and dissipated look, was not a pleasant object of contemplation, but as he played a prominent part in the proceedings of that memorable day, we are bound to draw attention to him.  Although he had spent a considerable portion of the night with his skipper in testing the quality of some schnapps which they had recently procured from a _coper_, he had retained his physical and mental powers sufficiently for the performance of his duties.  Indeed, he was one of those so-called seasoned casks, who are seldom or never completely disabled by drink, although thoroughly enslaved, and he was now quite competent to steer the _Fairy_ in safety through the mazes of that complex dance which the deep-sea trawlers usually perform on the arrival of the carrying-steamer.  What Bryce called a chopping and a lumpy sea was running.  It was decidedly rough, though the breeze was moderate, so that the smacks all round were alternately presenting sterns and bowsprits to the sky in a violent manner that might have suggested the idea of a rearing and kicking dance.  When the carrier steamed up to the Admiral, and lay to beside him, and the smacks drew towards her from all points of the compass, the mazes of the dance became intricate, and the risk of collisions called for careful steering.  Being aware of this, and being himself not quite so steady about the head as he could wish, Skipper Bryce looked at Martin for a few seconds, and then ordered him to go help to launch the boat and get the trunks out, and send Phil Morgan aft.  Phil was not a better seaman than Dick, but he was a more temperate man, therefore clearer brained and more dependable.  Soon the smacks were waltzing and kicking round each other on every possible tack, crossing and re-crossing bows and sterns; sometimes close shaving, out and in, down-the-middle-and-up-again fashion, which, to a landsman, might have been suggestive of the 'bus, cab, and van throng in the neighbourhood of that heart of the world, the Bank of England.  Sounds of hailing and chaffing now began to roll over the North Sea from many stentorian lungs.  \"What cheer? what cheer?\" cried some in passing.  \"Hallo, Tim! how are 'ee, old man!  What luck?\"  \"All right, Jim; on'y six trunks.\"  \"Ha! that's 'cause ye fished up a dead man yesterday.\"  \"Is that you, Ted?\"  \"Ay, ay, what's left o' me--worse luck.  I thought your mother was goin' to keep you at home this trip to mind the babby.\"  \"So she was, boy, but the babby fell into a can o' buttermilk an' got drownded, so I had to come off again, d'ee see?\"  \"What cheer, Groggy Fox?  Have 'ee hoisted the blue ribbon yet?\"  \"No, Stephen Lockley, I haven't, nor don't mean to, but one o' the fleet seems to have hoisted the blue flag.\"  Groggy Fox pointed to one of the surrounding vessels as he swept past in the _Cormorant_.  Lockley looked round in haste, and, to his surprise, saw floating among the smaller flags, at a short distance, the great twenty-feet flag of a mission vessel, with the letters MDSF (Mission to Deep-Sea Fishermen) on it, in white on a blue ground.  \"She must have lost her reckoning,\" muttered Lockley, as he tried to catch sight of the vessel to which the flag belonged--which was not easy, owing to the crowd of smacks passing to and fro between it and him.  Just at that moment a hearty cheer was heard to issue from the Admiral's smack, the _Cherub_.  At the same time the boat of the _Lively Poll_ was launched into the sea, Duffy and Freeman and another hand tumbled into her, and the skipper had to give his undivided attention to the all-important matter of transhipping the fish.  Dozens of boats were by that time bobbing like corks on the heaving sea, all making for the attendant steamer.  Other dozens, which had already reached her, were clinging on--the men heaving the fish-boxes aboard,-- while yet others were pushing off from the smacks last arrived to join the busy swarm.  Among these was the boat of the _Fairy_, with Dick Martin and two men aboard.  It was heavily laden--too heavily for such a sea--for their haul on the previous night had been very successful.  North Sea fishermen are so used to danger that they are apt to despise it.  Both Bryce and Martin knew they had too many trunks in the boat, but they thought it a pity to leave five or six behind, and be obliged to make two trips for so small a number, where one might do.  Besides, they could be careful.  And so they were--very careful; yet despite all their care they shipped a good deal of water, and the skipper stood on the deck of the _Fairy_ watching them with some anxiety.  Well he might, for so high were the waves that not only his own boat but all the others kept disappearing and re-appearing continually, as they rose on the crests or sank into the hollows.  But Skipper Bryce had eyes for only one boat.  He saw it rise to view and disappear steadily, regularly, until it was about half-way to the steamer; then suddenly it failed to rise, and next moment three heads were seen amid the tumultuous waters where the boat should have been.  With a tremendous shout Bryce sprang to the tiller and altered the vessel's course, but, as the wind blew, he knew well it was not in his power to render timely aid.  That peculiar cry which tells so unmistakably of deadly disaster was raised from the boats nearest to that which had sunk, and they were rowed towards the drowning men, but the boats were heavy and slow of motion.  Already they were too late, for two out of the three men had sunk to rise no more--dragged down by their heavy boots and winter clothing.  Only one continued the struggle. It was Dick Martin.  He had grasped an oar, and, being able to swim, kept his head up.  The intense cold of the sea, however, would soon have relaxed even his iron grip, and he would certainly have perished, had it not been that the recently arrived mission vessel chanced to be a very short distance to windward of him.  A slight touch of the helm sent her swiftly to his side.  A rope was thrown.  Martin caught it.  Ready hands and eager hearts were there to grasp and rescue.  In another moment he was saved, and the vessel swept on to mingle with the other smacks--for Martin was at first almost insensible, and could not tell to which vessel of the fleet he belonged.  Yes, the bad man was rescued, though no one would have sustained much loss by his death; but in Yarmouth that night there was one woman, who little thought that she was a widow, and several little ones who knew not that they were fatherless.  The other man who perished was an unmarried youth, but he left an invalid mother to lifelong mourning over the insatiable greed of the cold North Sea.  Little note was taken of this event in the fleet.  It was, in truth, a by no means unusual disaster.  If fish are to be found, fair weather or foul, for the tables on land, lives must be risked and lost in the waters of the sea.  Loss of life in ferrying the fish being of almost daily occurrence, men unavoidably get used to it, as surgeons do to suffering and soldiers to bloodshed.  Besides, on such occasions, in the great turmoil of winds and waves, and crowds of trawlers and shouting, it may be only a small portion of the fleet which is at first aware that disaster has occurred, and even these must not, cannot, turn aside from business at such times to think about the woes of their fellow-men.  Meanwhile Dick Martin had fallen, as the saying is, upon his feet.  He was carried into a neatly furnished cabin, put between warm blankets in a comfortable berth, and had a cup of steaming hot coffee urged upon him by a pleasant-voiced sailor, who, while he inquired earnestly as to how he felt, at the same time thanked the Lord fervently that they had been the means of saving his life.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  TELLS OF MORE THAN ONE SURPRISE.  \"Was that your boat that went down?\" shouted Groggy Fox of the _Cormorant_, as he sailed past the _Fairy_, after the carrying-steamer had left, and the numerous fishing-smacks were gradually falling into order for another attack on the finny hosts of the sea.  They were almost too far apart for the reply to be heard, and possibly Bryce's state of mind prevented his raising his voice"]]]
