The medial combinations {lh}, {rh} were written {lch}, {rch} when they came to stand finally, as {bevëlhen}, _to confide_, pret. {bevalch}; gen. {schëlhes}, {twërhes}, beside nom. {schëlch}, {twërch}, _askew_, see §19. {h} (= {ch}) and {ch} often disappeared in unstressed syllables and particles, as {ē̆t}, _only_, {hīnte}, {hīnt}, _to-night_, {niet}, _not_, {dur}, _through_, beside {ëht}, {hīnaht}, {niht}, {nieht}, {durch}.   §35.  Initial {j} became or was written {g} before a following {i}, as {gihet}, _he assures_, beside inf. {jëhen}, pret. {jach}, and similarly {jësen}, _to ferment_, {jëten}, _to weed_. In the verba pura forms with and without the intervocalic glide {j} existed side by side in OHG. and MHG., as {blüejen} (OHG. {bluojen}) beside {blüen} (OHG. {bluoen}), _to bloom_; and similarly {dræjen}, _to twist_, {müejen}, _to trouble_, {sæjen}, _to sow_, beside {dræn}, {müen}, {sæn}. In a few words forms with and without intervocalic {j (g)} existed side by side, as gen. {blīges} beside nom. {blī}, _lead_; {eijer}, {eiger} beside {eier}, _eggs_; {frījen}, {frīgen} beside {frīen}, _to free_; {meige}, {meie}, _May_; {nerigen}, {nerjen} beside {nern}, _to save_, _rescue_; {swerigen}, {swerjen} beside {swern}, _to swear_; gen. {zwīges}, {zwīes}, nom. {zwī}, _twig_; gen. {zweiger}, {zweier}, _of two_.   §36.  In OHG. {w} became vocalized to {o} when it came to stand at the end of a word or syllable, and then generally disappeared after long vowels, but the medial {w} regularly remained in OHG. and MHG. when it was at the beginning of a syllable, as {blā} (OHG. {blāo}, {blā}), _blue_, gen. {blāwes}; {snē} (OHG. {snēo}, {snē}), _snow_, gen. {snēwes}; {strō} (OHG. {strao}, {strō} by contraction), _straw_, gen. {strōwes}; {knie} (OHG. {kneo}), _knee_, gen. {kniewes}, OHG. {knëwes}; {schate} (OHG. {scato}), _shadow_, gen. {schat(e)wes}; pret. {blou}, {hiu}, {kou}, beside {bliuwen}, _to strike_, {houwen}, _to hew_, {kiuwen}, _to chew_; {fal} (OHG. {falo}), _fallow_, gen. {falwes}; {gar} (OHG. {garo}), _ready_, gen. {garwes}; {mël} (OHG. {mëlo}), _meal_, gen. {mëlwes}; {smër} (OHG. {smëro}), _fat_; pret. {smirte}, {ströute}, beside {smirwen}, _to smear_, {ströuwen}, _to strew_. See §9, r.  The {w} element sometimes disappeared in the initial combinations {qua-}, {quā-}, {quë-}, {qui-}, {quī-} partly with and partly without influencing the quality of the following vowel, as pret. sing. {kam}, {kom} beside {quam}, _he came_, pret. pl. {kōmen}, {kāmen} beside {quāmen}; {kāle} beside {quāle}, _torture_; {këc} beside {quec}, _alive_; {korder}, {körder} beside {quërder}, _bait_; {komen}, {kömen}, {kumen} beside {quëmen}, _to come_; pres. sing. {kume}, {küm(e)s(t)}, {kum(e)s(t)}, {küm(e)t}, {kum(e)t} = OHG. {quimu}, {quimis}, {quimit}; {kücken} beside {quicken}, _to enliven_; {kīt} beside {quīt} = {quidet}, _he says_.   §37.  Medial {-ibe-}, {-ide-}, {-ige-} were sometimes contracted to {ī}; and medial {-age-}, {-ege-} to {ei}, as {gīst}, _thou givest_, {gīt}, _he gives_, beside {gibes(t)}, {gibet}; {quīst}, _thou sayest_, {quīt}, _he says_, beside {quides(t)}, {quidet}; {līst}, _thou liest down_, {līt}, _he lies down_, beside {liges(t)}, {liget}. {meit} beside {maget}, _maid_; {seist}, _thou sayest_, {seit}, _he says_, beside {sages(t)}, {saget}; {leist}, _thou layest_, {leit}, _he lays_, beside {leges(t)}, {leget}; {eislīch} beside {egeslīch}, _terrible_; {gein} beside {gegen}, _against_.   §38.  Intervocalic {h} often disappeared when the first vowel was long, and then the two vowels underwent contraction, as {hān}, _to hang_, {vān}, _to catch_, {vlēn}, _to implore_, {hō} (adv.), _high_, beside {hāhen}, {vāhen}, {vlēhen}, {hōhe}. Other contracted forms will be found in the Glossary.   §39.  The final {r} disappeared after long vowels in monosyllables when the next word began with a consonant, but was often restored analogically, as {dā} (OHG. {dār}), _there_: {dārinne}, _therein_; {wā} (OHG. {wār}), _where_: {wārinne}, _wherein_; {hie} (OHG. {hiar}): {hierunder}, _hereunder_; adv. {mē} (OHG. {mēr}), _more_; {ē} (OHG. {ēr}), _formerly_; {sā} (OHG. {sār}), _at once_.   §40.  Medial {t} (§25) became {d} after nasals in late OHG. and early MHG., as {senden}, _to send_, gen. {blindes} (nom. {blint}, _blind_), pret. {nande}, _he named_, {rūmde}, _he left_, beside early MHG. {senten}, {blintes}, {nante}, {rūmte}. It also occasionally became {d} after {l}, as {halden} beside {halten}, _to hold_, {solde} beside {solte}, pret. of {suln}, _shall_.     ACCIDENCE  CHAPTER III   DECLENSION OF NOUNS  §41.  MHG. nouns have two numbers: singular and plural; three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter, as in OHG. and NHG., from which the gender of nouns in MHG. does not materially differ; four cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative. Traces of an old locative occur in what is called the uninflected dative singular of {hūs}, _house_, beside {hūse}, and in proper names like {Engellant} beside {Engellande}. The vocative is like the nominative.  In MHG., as in the older periods of the other Germanic languages, nouns are divided into two great classes, according as the stem originally ended in a vowel or a consonant, cp. the similar division of nouns in Latin and Greek. Nouns whose stems originally ended in a vowel belong to the vocalic or so-called strong declension. Those whose stems originally ended in {-n} belong to the so-called weak or {n-}declension. All other consonantal stems are generally put together under the general heading, ‘Minor Declensions’. In OHG. nouns whose stems originally ended in a vowel are subdivided into the {a-}declension including pure {a-}stems, {ja-}stems, and {wa-}stems; the {ō-}declension including pure {ō-}stems, {jō-}stems, and {wō-}stems; the {ī̆-}declension, and the {u-}declension. All the nouns belonging to the {u-}declension went over into other declensions in MHG. (cp. §§43, 44, 49). But as all final vowels either disappeared (some of them already in OHG.) or were weakened to {e} in MHG. (see §§7, 8), it is no longer practicable to retain the OHG. subdivision fully without entering into the oldest and in many cases into the prehistoric period of the language, which would be quite out of place in a MHG. grammar. The old ‘Minor Declensions’ had begun to pass over into the vocalic, especially into the {i-} and {a-}, declensions in the oldest OHG. The remnants of the old inflexions preserved in MHG. will be noted in the following paragraphs. The neuter nouns whose stems originally ended in {-os}, {-es} (cp. §47) are in this Primer included in the strong declension.   A. THE VOCALIC OR STRONG DECLENSION.  1. {Masculine Nouns.}  §42.  {First declension.}--To this declension belong all masculine nouns which form their plural in {-e} only. It includes: (a) the old masculine {a-}stems; (b) the old masculine {wa-}stems which lost their final {-w} after long vowels in OHG., as {sē}, _sea_, gen. {sēwes}, pl. {sēwe}, and similarly {bū}, _dwelling_, {rē} (also neuter), _corpse_, {snē}, _snow_, see §36; and (c) the old masculine {i-}stems which could not have umlaut in the plural (§44).

Like {tac} are also declined the old consonantal stems {vīent}, _enemy_, and {vriunt}, _friend_, but pl. {vriunde} beside the old plural {vriunt}.  Like {kil} are declined all monosyllabic masculine nouns having a short stem-vowel and ending in {-l} or {-r} (§9, 1).  Like {engel} are declined masculine polysyllabic nouns ending in {-el}, {-em}, {-en}, {-er}, when their stem-syllable is long, as {mantel}, _mantle_, {ātem}, _breath_, {morgen}, _morning_, {acker}, _field_. Those in {-em}, {-en} generally retain the {e} in the dative plural. Polysyllabic nouns with short stem-syllables fluctuate between the retention or loss of the {e}, as gen. sing. {vogeles} or {vogels}, dat. sing, and nom. acc. pl. {vogele} or {vogel}, and similarly {vadem}, _thread_, {rëgen}, _rain_, {sumer}, _summer_, see §9,2.   §43.  {Second declension.}--To this declension belong all masculine nouns whose nom. and acc. singular end in {-e}, which is the only difference between this and the first declension. It includes: (a) the old masculine {ja-}stems; (b) many old {u-}stems with short stem-syllable, as {fride} (OHG. {fridu}), _peace_, {site} (OHG. {situ}), _custom_, and similarly {huge}, _thought_, {mëte}, _mead_, {sige} beside {sic}, _victory_, {wite}, _wood_ (see §36); (c) the old short {i-}stem {wine}, _friend_; and (d) the old masculine {wa-}stem {schate} (gen. {schat(e)wes} beside {schates}), _shadow_.

It includes: (a) the old"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22636"],["title","A Middle High German Primer (#8)"],["body","{i-}stems; (b) the old masculine {u-}stem {sun} (OHG. {sunu}, {sun}), _son_; and (c) the two old consonant stems {fuoȥ}, _foot_, {zant} (gen. {zandes}), {zan}, _tooth_.                  SING.                      PLUR.             MHG.     OHG.              MHG.     OHG.    Nom.

And owing to the weakening of the case-endings of the plural in passing from OHG. to MHG. (§7), the only difference in the two declensions is the presence or absence of umlaut in the plural. The old masculine {i-}stems which could not have umlaut in the plural accordingly came to be inflected entirely like the old masculine {a-}stems, as {schrit}, _step_, {snit}, _cut_, {biȥ}, _bite_, pl. {schrite}, {snite}, {biȥȥe}. A further consequence of the singular being inflected alike in both declensions is that the old {a-}stems began to have umlaut in the plural after the analogy of the {i-}stems, as {gedenke}, _thoughts_, {nägele}, _nails_, {wägene}, _wagons_, beside {gedanke}, {nagele}, {wagene}.  Nouns ending in the fortis {p, t, c}, or {f} (= Germanic {f}) regularly change the fortis to lenis in the inflected forms, as {korp}, _basket_, {walt}, _wood_, {slac}, _blow_, {brief}, _letter_, gen. {korbes}, {waldes}, {stages}, {brieves}.   §45.  The old consonant stems {vater}, _father_, {bruoder}, _brother_, often remain uninflected in the singular, as gen. {vater}, {bruoder} beside {vaters}, {bruoders} (cp. §9, 2). In the plural they take umlaut, as {veter}, {brüeder}. The old consonant stem {man}, _man_, is either declined like {tac} (§42) or remains uninflected throughout, as              SING.            PLUR.    Nom. Acc. man              manne, man        Gen. mannes, man      manne, man        Dat. manne, man       mannen, man  The nom. plural {man}, now written {mann}, is still preserved in counting, as {hundert mann}, _a hundred men_.   2. {Neuter Nouns.}  §46.  {First Declension.}--To this declension belong all neuter nouns which have their nominative case singular and plural alike. It includes three different types of nouns: (a) The old neuter {a-}stems like {wort}, _word_, {venster}, _window_. (b) The old neuter {ja-}stems like {künne}, _race_, _generation_, {bette}, _bed_, {netze}, _net_. The characteristic of this type of noun is that it has umlaut in all forms of the singular and plural when the stem-vowel is capable of it (cp. §31, 3). And (c) the old neuter {wa-}stems (cp. §36) like {knie}, _knee_, gen. {kniewes}.                          SING.    Nom. Acc. wort    venster   künne   knie        Gen. wortes  vensters  künnes  kniewes (knies)        Dat. worte   venster   künne   kniewe (knie)                           PLUR.    Nom. Acc. wort    venster   künne   knie        Gen. worte   venster   künne   kniewe (knie)        Dat. worten  venstern  künnen  kniewen (knien)  (a) On the interchange between the fortes {p, t, c} and the lenes {b, d, g}, as in {grap}, _grave_, {gëlt}, _money_, {dinc}, _thing_, gen. {grabes}, {gëldes}, {dinges}, see §33.  Like {venster} are declined the neuter polysyllabic nouns ending in {-el}, {-em}, {-en}, {-er}, as {luoder}, _bait_, {wāfen}, {wāpen}, _weapon_; {schapel}, _garland_, {gadem}, _house_, {wëter}, _weather_. On the endings, see §§9, 42.  (b) Like {künne} is also declined the old neuter {u-}stem {vihe} (OHG. {fihu}), _cattle_.  (c) Like {knie} are declined {mël}, _meal_, {rē} (also masc.), _corpse_, {smër}, _fat_, {strō}, _straw_, {tou}, _dew_, {wē}, _woe_, gen. {mëlwes}, {rēwes}, {smërwes}, {strōwes}, {touwes}, {wēwes}, see §36.   §47.  {Second declension.}--To this declension belong all neuter nouns which form their plural in {-er} and by umlaut of the stem-vowel when it is capable of it. This class of nouns corresponds to the Latin neuters in {-us}, as {genus}, gen. {generis}, pl. {genera}. The {-er} (OHG. {-ir}) was originally a stem-forming suffix which came to be regarded as a plural ending. In the oldest period of the language only about half-a-dozen nouns belonged to this class, but during the MHG. period nearly twenty neuter {a-}stems passed into this declension, and in NHG. the number has increased to about a hundred.                  SING.                      PLUR.             MHG.     OHG.             MHG.      OHG.    Nom.

Other examples are: {ei} (pl. {eiger}, {eijer}, {eier}, §35), _egg_, {huon}, _hen_, {kalp}, _calf_, {rat}, _wheel_, {rint}, _bullock_, {tal}, _dale_.   3. {Feminine Nouns.}  §48.  {First declension.}--To this declension belong all feminine nouns having their nominative case singular and plural alike. It includes: (a) the old feminine {ō-}stems, as {gëbe}, _gift_, {sēle}, _soul_, {zal}, _number_; (b) the old feminine {jō-}stems, as {küneginne}, {künegin}, {künegīn}, _queen_, and similarly {vriundinne}, _friend_, {gütinne}, _goddess_; (c) the old feminine {wō-}stems with and without {w}, as {brāwe}, {brā}, _brow_, pl. {brā} beside weak pl. {brāwen}; {diuwe}, {diu}, _servant_; (d) the old feminine abstract nouns in {-ī}, as {vinster} (OHG. {finstrī}), _darkness_, {schœne} (OHG. {scōnī}), _beauty_; and (e) the old consonant stem, {swester}, {swëster}, _sister_.                         SING.    Nom. Acc. gëbe       zal       vinster        Gen. gëbe       zal       vinster        Dat. gëbe       zal       vinster                         PLUR.    Nom.

The gen. plural had the ending of the weak declension already in the oldest period of the language. Through the nom. singular and the gen. and dat. plural having the same endings as the feminine weak declension (§53), {ō-}stems began in OHG. to be inflected after the analogy of the weak declension, especially in the plural. This process spread considerably in MHG. with concrete nouns, but not often with abstract nouns.   §49.  {Second declension.}--To this declension belong all feminine nouns which form their plural in {-e} and have umlaut in the stem-vowel. It includes: (a) the old feminine {i-}stems; (b) the old {u-}stem {hant}, _hand_; and (c) several old consonantal stems, see below.                      SING.

The old gen. plural has been preserved in NHG. {allerhand}, and the dat. plural in {abhanden}, {beihanden}, {vorhanden}, {zuhanden}.  Several old consonant stems went over partly or entirely into this declension, viz. {maget}, {meit} (§37), _maid_, pl. {mägede} or {meide}; {kuo}, _cow_, pl. {küeje} or {küewe} (OHG. {kuoi}), {sū}, _sow_, pl. {siuwe} (OHG. {sūi}); both these nouns generally remained uninflected in the gen. and dat. singular. {naht}, _night_, has gen. and dat. singular {naht} beside {nähte}; pl. nom. acc. gen. {naht} beside {nähte}, dat. {nahten} beside {nähten}, cp. also NHG. {weihnachten}, MHG. {zën wīhen nahten}. The MHG. adverbial gen. {nahts}, {dës nahtes} was formed after the analogy of {dës tages}. Like {naht} were also inflected {brust}, _breast_, and {burc}, _citadel_.  {muoter}, _mother_, and {tohter}, _daughter_, remain uninflected in the singular. In the plural they have umlaut: {müeter}, {töhter}.   B. THE WEAK DECLENSION (N-STEMS).  §50.  The weak declension contains a large number of masculine and feminine nouns, but only four neuter nouns, viz. {hërze}, _heart_, {ōre}, _ear_, {ouge}, _eye_, and {wange}, _cheek_; these nouns, especially {hërze}, sometimes form their nom. acc. plural after the analogy of nouns like {künne} (§46). The original case endings of the weak declension had disappeared in the oldest period of the language except in the nom. singular (masc. {-o}, fem., and neut. {-a}), the gen. pl. ({ōno}) and dat. pl. ({-ōm}). Owing to the weakening of the {-o}, {-a} to {-e} in MHG. the nom. singular became alike in all genders. And similarly the endings {-ōno}, {-ōm} and the endings of the other oblique forms were all weakened to {-en} in MHG. (§7), so that the element which originally formed part of the stem came to be regarded as a case ending.  On the loss of the final and medial {e} in nouns like {ar}, _eagle_, {bir} (fem.), _pear_, {gevangen(e)}, _prisoner_, beside the inflected forms {arn}, {birn}, {gevangen} from {*gevangen-en} through the intermediate stage {*gevangenn}, see §9, 1,2.   §51.  1. {Masculine Nouns.}                    SING.
