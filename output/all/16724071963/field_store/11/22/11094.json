The offer was of course joyfully accepted, and on Mr. Campbell's calling upon the Governor to return his thanks, the latter told him that there would be plenty of room in the _bateaux_ and canoes for them and all their luggage, and that he need not give himself further trouble, or incur any further expense.     CHAPTER VI.   The next day the Surveyor-General called, bringing with him Martin Super, the trapper.  \"Mr. Campbell,\" said the Surveyor, \"this is my friend Martin Super; I have spoken to him, and he has consented to take service for one year, and he will remain, if he is satisfied. If he serves you as well as he has served me when I have traveled through the country, I have no doubt but you will find him a valuable assistant.\"  Martin Super was rather tall, very straight-limbed, showing both activity and strength. His head was smaller than usually is the case, which gave him the appearance of great lightness and agility. His countenance was very pleasing, being expressive of continual good humor, which was indeed but corresponding to his real character. He was dressed in a sort of hunting-coat of deer-skin, blue cloth leggings, a cap of raccoon's skin, with a broad belt round his waist, in which he wore his knife.  \"Now, Martin Super, I will read the terms of the agreement between you and Mr. Campbell, that you may see if all is as you wish.\"  The Surveyor-General read the agreement, and Martin nodded his head in acquiescence.  \"Mr. Campbell, if you are satisfied, you may now sign it; Martin shall do the same.\"  Mr. Campbell signed his name, and handed the pen to Martin Super, who then for the first time spoke.  \"Surveyor, I don't know how my name is spelt; and if I did, I couldn't write it, so I must do it Indian fashion, and put my totem to it?\"  \"What is your name among the Indians, Martin?\"  \"The Painter,\" replied Martin, who then made under Mr. Campbell's name, a figure like [Illustration of a panther] saying, \"There, that's my name as near as I can draw it.\"  \"Very good,\" replied the Surveyor-General; \"here is the document all right, Mr. Campbell. Ladies, I fear I must run away, for I have an engagement. I will leave Martin Super, Mr. Campbell, as you would probably like a little conversation together.\"  The Surveyor-General then took his leave, and Martin Super remained. Mrs. Campbell was the first who spoke: \"Super,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be very good friends, but now tell me what you mean by your--totem, I think you called it?\"  \"Why, ma'am, a totem is an Indian's mark, and you know I am almost an Indian myself. All the Indian chiefs have their totems. One is called the Great Otter; another the Serpent, and so on, and so they sign a figure like the animal they are named from. Then, ma'am, you see, we trappers, who almost live with them, have names given to us also and they have called me the Painter.\"  \"Why did they name you the Painter?\"  \"Because I killed two of them in one day.\"  \"Killed two painters!\" cried the girls.  \"Yes, miss; killed them both with my rifle.\"  \"But why did you kill the men?\" said Emma; \"was it in battle?\"  \"Kill the men, miss; I said nothing about men; I said I killed two painters,\" replied Martin, laughing, and showing a row of teeth as white as ivory.  \"What is a painter, then, Super?\" inquired Mrs. Campbell.  \"Why, it's an animal, and a very awkward creature, I can tell you, sometimes.\"  \"The drawing is something like a panther, mamma,\" exclaimed Mary.  \"Well, miss, it may be a panther, but we only know them by the other name.\"  Mr. Farquhar then came in, and the question was referred to him; he laughed and told them that painters were a species of panther, not spotted but tawny-colored, and at times very dangerous.  \"Do you know the part of the country where we are going to?\" said Henry to Super.  \"Yes, I have trapped thereabouts for months, but the beavers are scarce now.\"  \"Are there any other animals there?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Martin, \"small game, as we term it.\"  \"What sort are they?\"  \"Why, there's painters, and bears, and catamounts.\"  \"Mercy on us! do you call that small game? why, what must the large be, then?\" said Mrs. Campbell.  \"Buffaloes, missus, is what we call big game.\"  \"But the animals you speak of are not good eating, Super,\" said Mrs. Campbell; \"is there no game that we can eat?\"  \"Oh, yes, plenty of deer and wild turkey, and bear's good eating, I reckon.\"  \"Ah! that sounds better.\"  After an hour's conversation, Martin Super was dismissed; the whole of the family (except Alfred, who was not at home) very much pleased with what they had seen of him.  A few days after this, Martin Super, who had now entered upon service, and was very busy with Alfred, with whom he had already become a favorite, was sent for by Mr. Campbell, who read over to him the inventory of the articles which they had, and inquired of him if there was any thing else which might be necessary or advisable to take with them.  \"You said something about guns,\" replied Martin, \"what sort of guns did you mean?\"  \"We have three fowling-pieces and three muskets, besides pistols.\"  \"Fowling-pieces,--they are bird-guns, I believe,--no use at all; muskets are soldiers' tools,--no use; pistols are pops, and nothing better. You have no rifles; you can't go into the woods without rifles. I have got mine, but you must have some.\"  \"Well, I believe you are right, Martin; it never occurred to me. How many ought we to have?\"  \"Well, that's according--how many be you in family?\"  \"We are five males and three females.\"  \"Well, then, sir, say ten rifles; that will be quite sufficient. Two spare ones in case of accident,\" replied Martin.  \"Why, Martin,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"you do not mean that the children and these young ladies and I are to fire off rifles?\"  \"I do mean to say, ma'am, that before I was as old as that little boy,\" pointing to John, \"I could hit a mark well; and a woman ought at least to know how to prime and load a rifle, even if she does not fire it herself. It is a deadly weapon, ma'am, and the greatest leveler in creation, for the trigger pulled by a child will settle the business of the stoutest man. I don't mean to say that we may be called to use them in that way, but it's always better to have them, and to let other people know that you have them, and all ready loaded too, if required.\"  \"Well, Martin,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"I agree with you, it is better to be well prepared. We will have the ten rifles, if we can afford to purchase them. What will they cost?\"  \"About sixteen dollars will purchase the best, sir; but I think I had better choose them for you, and try them before you purchase.\"  \"Do so, then, Super; Alfred will go with you as soon as he comes back, and you and he can settle the matter.\"  \"Why, Super,\" observed Mrs. Campbell, \"you have quite frightened us women at the idea of so many firearms being required.\"  \"If Pontiac was alive, missus, they would all be required, but he's gone now; still there are many outlying Indians, as we call them, who are no better than they should be; and I always like to see rifles ready loaded. Why, ma'am, suppose now that all the men were out in the woods, and a bear should pay you a visit during your absence, would it not be just as well for to have a loaded rifle ready for him; and would not you or the young misses willingly prefer to pull the trigger at him than to be hugged in his fashion?\"  \"Martin Super, you have quite convinced me: I shall not only learn to load a rifle but to fire one also.\"  \"And I'll teach the boys the use of them, ma'am, and they will then add to your defense.\"  \"You shall do so, Martin,\" replied Mrs. Campbell; \"I am convinced that you are quite right.\"  When Super had quitted the room, which he did soon afterward, Mr. Campbell observed--\"I hope, my dear, that you and the girls are not terrified by the remarks of Martin. It is necessary to be well armed when isolated as we shall be, and so far from any assistance; but it does not follow, because we ought to be prepared against danger, that such danger should occur.\"  \"I can answer for myself, my dear Campbell,\" replied his wife; \"I am prepared, if necessary, to meet danger, and do what a weak woman can do; and I feel what Martin says is but too true, that with a rifle in hand, a woman or a child is on a par with the strongest man.\"  \"And I, my dear uncle,\" said Mary Percival, \"shall, I trust, with the blessing of God, know how to do my duty, however peculiar the circumstances may be to a female.\"  \"And I, my dear uncle,\" followed up Emma, laughing, \"infinitely prefer firing off a rifle to being hugged by a bear or an Indian, because of two evils one should always choose the least.\"  \"Well, then, I see Martin has done no harm, but, on the contrary, he has done good. It is always best to be prepared for the worst, and to trust to Providence for aid in peril.\"  At last all the purchases were completed, and every thing was packed up and ready for embarkation. Another message from the Governor was received, stating that in three days the troops would be embarked, and also informing Mr. Campbell that if he had not purchased any cows or horses, the officer at Fort Frontignac had more cattle than were requisite, and could supply him; which, perhaps, would be preferable to carrying them up so far. Mr. Campbell had spoken about, but not finally settled for, the cows, and therefore was glad to accept the Governor's offer. This message was accompanied with a note of invitation to Mr. Campbell, the ladies, and Henry and Alfred, to take a farewell dinner at Government House the day before their departure. The invitation was accepted, and Mr. Campbell was introduced to the officer commanding the detachment which was about to proceed to Fort Frontignac, and received from him every assurance of his doing all he could to make them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/225"],["title","At the Back of the North Wind (#0)"],["body","THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND   By George Mac Donald  Author of “Dealings with Fairies,” “Ranald Bannerman,” etc., etc.      CHAPTER I. THE HAY-LOFT   I HAVE been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind. An old Greek writer mentions a people who lived there, and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer, and drowned themselves. My story is not the same as his. I do not think Herodotus had got the right account of the place. I am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there.  He lived in a low room over a coach-house; and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind, as his mother very well knew. For one side of the room was built only of boards, and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind. And then let them settle between them which was the sharper! I know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse, and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind. Still, this room was not very cold, except when the north wind blew stronger than usual: the room I have to do with now was always cold, except in summer, when the sun took the matter into his own hands. Indeed, I am not sure whether I ought to call it a room at all; for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses.  And when little Diamond--but stop: I must tell you that his father, who was a coachman, had named him after a favourite horse, and his mother had had no objection:--when little Diamond, then, lay there in bed, he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark, or moving sleepily in their dreams. For Diamond's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it, because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house; and Diamond's father put old Diamond in the stall under the bed, because he was a quiet horse, and did not go to sleep standing, but lay down like a reasonable creature. But, although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature, yet, when young Diamond woke in the middle of the night, and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind, he could not help wondering whether, if the wind should blow the house down, and he were to fall through into the manger, old Diamond mightn't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown. And although old Diamond was very quiet all night long, yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake, and then young Diamond knew what o'clock it was, or at least what was to be done next, which was--to go to sleep again as fast as he could.  There was hay at his feet and hay at his head, piled up in great trusses to the very roof. Indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings, which looked as if it had been sawn out for him, that he could reach his bed at all. For the stock of hay was, of course, always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow. Sometimes the whole space of the loft, with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in, would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed; sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard. Sometimes, when his mother had undressed him in her room, and told him to trot to bed by himself, he would creep into the heart of the hay, and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind, and how warm it was inside there in his bed, and how he could go to it when he pleased, only he wouldn't just yet; he would get a little colder first. And ever as he grew colder, his bed would grow warmer, till at last he would scramble out of the hay, shoot like an arrow into his bed, cover himself up, and snuggle down, thinking what a happy boy he was. He had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall, and blew about him all night. For the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick, and on the other side of them was the north wind.  Now, as I have already said, these boards were soft and crumbly. To be sure, they were tarred on the outside, yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber. Hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it, little Diamond found one night, after he lay down, that a knot had come out of one of them, and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion. Now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right; so he jumped out of bed again, got a little strike of hay, twisted it up, folded it in the middle, and, having thus made it into a cork, stuck it into the hole in the wall. But the wind began to blow loud and angrily, and, as Diamond was falling asleep, out blew his cork and hit him on the nose, just hard enough to wake him up quite, and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole. He searched for his hay-cork, found it, stuck it in harder, and was just dropping off once more, when, pop! with an angry whistle behind it, the cork struck him again, this time on the cheek. Up he rose once more, made a fresh stopple of hay, and corked the hole severely. But he was hardly down again before--pop! it came on his forehead. He gave it up, drew the clothes above his head, and was soon fast asleep.  Although the next day was very stormy, Diamond forgot all about the hole, for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother's fire with a broken chair, a three-legged stool, and a blanket, and then sitting in it. His mother, however, discovered it, and pasted a bit of brown paper over it, so that, when Diamond had snuggled down the next night, he had no occasion to think of it.  Presently, however, he lifted his head and listened. Who could that be talking to him? The wind was rising again, and getting very loud, and full of rushes and whistles. He was sure some one was talking--and very near him, too, it was. But he was not frightened, for he had not yet learned how to be; so he sat up and hearkened. At last the voice, which, though quite gentle, sounded a little angry, appeared to come from the back of the bed. He crept nearer to it, and laid his ear against the wall. Then he heard nothing but the wind, which sounded very loud indeed. The moment, however, that he moved his head from the wall, he heard the voice again, close to his ear. He felt about with his hand, and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole. Against this he laid his ear, and then he heard the voice quite distinctly. There was, in fact, a little corner of the paper loose, and through that, as from a mouth in the wall, the voice came.  “What do you mean, little boy--closing up my window?”  “What window?” asked Diamond.  “You stuffed hay into it three times last night. I had to blow it out again three times.”  “You can't mean this little hole! It isn't a window; it's a hole in my bed.”  “I did not say it was a window: I said it was my window.”  “But it can't be a window, because windows are holes to see out of.”  “Well, that's just what I made this window for.”  “But you are outside: you can't want a window.”  “You are quite mistaken. Windows are to see out of, you say. Well, I'm in my house, and I want windows to see out of it.”  “But you've made a window into my bed.”  “Well, your mother has got three windows into my dancing room, and you have three into my garret.”  “But I heard father say, when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall, that it was against the law, for it would look into Mr. Dyves's garden.”  The voice laughed.  “The law would have some trouble to catch me!” it said.  “But if it's not right, you know,” said Diamond, “that's no matter. You shouldn't do it.”  “I am so tall I am above that law,” said the voice.  “You must have a tall house, then,” said Diamond.  “Yes; a tall house: the clouds are inside it.”  “Dear me!” said Diamond, and thought a minute. “I think, then, you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you. Why don't you make a window into Mr. Dyves's bed?”  “Nobody makes a window into an ash-pit,” said the voice, rather sadly. “I like to see nice things out of my windows.”  “But he must have a nicer bed than I have, though mine is very nice--so nice that I couldn't wish a better.”  “It's not the bed I care about: it's what is in it.--But you just open that window.”  “Well, mother says I shouldn't be disobliging; but it's rather hard. You see the north wind will blow right in my face if I do.”  “I am the North Wind.”  “O-o-oh!” said Diamond, thoughtfully. “Then will you promise not to blow on my face if I open your window?”  “I can't promise that.”  “But you'll give me the toothache. Mother's got it already.”  “But what's to become of me without a window?”  “I'm sure I don't know. All I say is, it will be worse for me than for you.”  “No; it will not. You shall not be the worse for it--I promise you that. You will be much the better for it. Just you believe what I say, and do as I tell you.”  “Well, I can pull the clothes over my head,” said Diamond, and feeling with his little sharp nails, he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once.  In came a long whistling spear of cold, and struck his little naked chest. He scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes, and covered himself up: there was no paper now between him and the voice, and he felt a little--not frightened exactly--I told you he had not learned that yet--but rather queer; for what a strange person this North Wind must be that lived in the great house--“called Out-of-Doors, I suppose,”  thought Diamond--and made windows into people's beds! But the voice began again; and he could hear it quite plainly, even with his head under the bed-clothes. It was a still more gentle voice now, although six times as large and loud as it had been, and he thought it sounded a little like his mother's.  “What is your name, little boy?” it asked.  “Diamond,” answered Diamond, under the bed-clothes.  “What a funny name!”  “It's a very nice"]]]
