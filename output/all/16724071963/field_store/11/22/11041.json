The manito had said to them, \"Dear little workers, you shall no longer walk from flower to flower. I will give you wings, and you shall be bees. Whenever men hear a gentle humming, they will say, 'Those are the busy bees, and their wings were given them because they were wise and good.'\"  [Illustration]  To the other tribe the manito said, \"You shall be flies, and you, too, shall have wings; but while the workers fly from flower to flower and eat the yellow honey, you shall have for your food only what has been thrown away. When men hear your buzzing, they will say, 'It is good that the flies have wings, because we can drive them away from us the more quickly.'\"     THE STORY OF THE FIRST MOLES.   A rich man and a poor man once owned a field together. The rich man owned the northern half, and the poor man owned the southern half. Each man sowed his ground with seed. The warm days came, the gentle rain fell, and the seed in the poor man's half of the field sprang up and put forth leaves. The seed in the rich man's half all died in the ground.  The rich man was selfish and wicked. He said, \"The southern half of the field is mine,\" but the poor man replied, \"No, the southern half is mine, for that is where I sowed my seed.\"  The rich man had a son who was as wicked as himself. This boy whispered, \"Father, tell him to come in the morning. I know how we can keep the land.\" So the rich man said, \"Come in the morning, and we shall soon see whose land this is.\"  At night the rich man and his son pulled up some bushes that grew beside the field, and the son hid in the hole where their roots had been.  Morning came, and many people went to the field with the rich man. The poor man was sorrowful, for he feared that he would lose his ground.  \"Now we shall see,\" said the rich man boastfully, and he called aloud, \"Whose ground is this?\"  \"This is the ground of the rich man,\" answered a voice from the hole.  \"How shall I ever get food for my children!\" cried the poor man.  Then another voice was heard. It was that of the spirit of the fields, and it said, \"The southern half of the field is the poor man's, and the northern half shall be his too.\"  The rich man would have run away, but the voice called, \"Wait. Look where the bushes once stood. The boy in the hole and his wicked father shall hide in the darkness as long as they live, and never again shall they see the light of the sun.\"  This is the story of the first moles, and this is why the mole never comes to the light of day.     THE STORY OF THE FIRST ANTS.   \"This jar is full of smoked flesh,\" said one voice.  \"This has fish, this is full of honey, and that one is almost running over with oil,\" said another voice. \"We shall have all that we need to eat for many days to come.\"  These are the words that a villager coming home from his work heard his mother and his sister say.  \"They have often played tricks on me,\" he said to himself, \"and now I will play one on them.\" So he went into the house and said, \"Mother, I have found that I have a wonderful sense of smell, and by its help I can find whatever is hidden away.\"  \"That is a marvelous story,\" cried the sister.  \"If you can tell me what is in these jars,\" said his mother, \"I shall think you are really a magician. What is it now?\"  \"This is flesh, this fish, this honey, and this jar is full of oil,\" said the man.  \"I never heard of such a marvel in all my life,\" cried the mother; and in the morning she called her friends and said, \"Only think what a wonderful sense of smell my son has! He told me what was in these jars when they were closed.\"  It was not long before the people all through the country heard of the wonderful man, and one day word came that the king wished to see him at once.  The man was afraid, for he did not know what would happen to him, and he was still more afraid when the king said, \"A pearl is lost that I had in my hand last night. They say you can find things that are lost. Find my pearl, or your head will he lost.\"  The poor man went out into the forest. \"Oh, how I wish I had not tried to play tricks,\" he wailed. \"Then this sharp sorrow, this dire trouble, would not have come upon me.\"  \"Please, please do not tell the king,\" said two voices in the shadow of the trees.  \"Who are you?\" asked the man.  \"Oh, you must know us well,\" said a man coming out into the light. \"My name is Sharp, and that man behind the tree is named Dire, but please do not tell the king. We will give you the pearl; here it is. You called our names, and we saw that you knew us. Oh, I wish I had not been a thief!\"  The man gave the pearl to the king, and went home wishing that no one would ever talk to him again of his sense of smell.  In three days word came from the queen that he must come to her at once. She thought his power was only a trick, and to catch him she had put a cat into a bag and the bag into a box.  When the man came, she asked sharply, \"What is in this box? Tell me the truth, or off will go your head.\"  [Illustration: A WONDERFUL SENSE OF SMELL]  \"What shall I do?\" thought the man, \"Dire death is upon me.\" He did not remember that he was before the queen, and he repeated half aloud an old saying, \"The bagged cat soon dies.\"  \"What is that?\" cried the queen.  \"The bagged cat soon dies,\" repeated the man in great terror.  \"You are a marvelous man,\" said the queen. \"There is really a bag in the box and a cat in the bag, but no one besides myself knew it.\"  \"He is not a man; he is a god,\" cried the people, \"and he must be in the sky and live among the gods;\" so they threw him up to the sky. His hand was full of earth, and when the earth fell back, it was no longer earth, but a handful of ants. Ants have a wonderful sense of smell, and it is because they fell from the hand of this man who was thrown up into the sky to live among the gods.     THE FACE OF THE MANITO.   Many years ago the manito of the Indians lived in the sun. Every morning the wise men of the tribe went to the top of a mountain, and as the sun rose in the east, they sang, \"We praise thee, O sun! From thee come fire and light. Be good to us, be good to us.\"  After the warm days of the summer had come, the sun was so bright that the Indians said to their wise men, \"When you go to the mountain top, ask the manito to show us his face in a softer, gentler light.\"  Then the wise men went to the mountain top, and this is what they said: \"O great manito, we are but children before you, and we have no power to bear the brightness of your face. Look down upon us here on the earth with a gentler, softer light, that we may ever gaze upon you and show you all love and all honor.\"  The bright sun moved slowly toward the south. The people were afraid that the manito was angry with them, but when the moon rose they were no longer sad, for from the moon the loving face of the manito was looking down upon them.  Night after night the people gazed at the gentle face, but at last a night came when the moon was not seen in the sky. The wise men went sorrowfully to the mountain top. \"O manito,\" they said, \"we are never happy when we cannot gaze into your face. Will you not show it to your children?\"  The moon did not rise, and the people were sad, but when morning came, there was the loving face of the manito showing clearly in the rocks at the top of the mountain.  Again they were happy, but when dark clouds hid the gentle face, the wise men went to the foot of the mountain and called sadly, \"O manito, we can no longer see your face.\"  The clouds grew darker and fell like a cloak over the mountain, the trees trembled in the wind, the forked lightning shot across the sky, and the thunder called aloud.  \"It is the anger of the manito,\" cried the people. \"The heavens are falling,\" they whispered, and they hid their faces in fear.  Morning came, the storm had gone, and the sky was clear. Tremblingly the people looked up toward the mountain top for the face of the manito. It was not there, but after they had long gazed in sorrow, a wise man cried, \"There it is, where no cloud will hide it from us.\" In the storm the rocks had fallen from the mountain top. They were halfway down the mountain side, and in them could be seen the face of the manito.  Then the people cried, \"Praise to the good manito! His loving face will look down upon us from the mountain side forever-more.\"  For a long time all went well, but at last trouble came, for they heard that a great tribe were on the war-path coming to kill them. \"Help us, dear manito,\" they cried but there was no help. The warriors came nearer and nearer. Their war-cry was heard, \"O manito,\" called the people, \"help us, help us!\" A voice from the mountain answered, \"My children, be not afraid.\" The war-cry was still, and when the people looked, for the warriors, they were nowhere to be seen. The people gazed all around, and at last one of the wise men cried, \"There they are, there they are!\"  They were at the foot of the mountain, but the people no longer feared them, for now they were not warriors but rocks. To keep from harm those whom he loved, the manito had made the warriors into stone. They stood at the foot of the mountain, and to-day, if you should go to that far-away country, you could see the rocks that were once warriors, and above them, halfway up the mountain side, you could see the face of the manito.     THE STORY OF THE FIRST DIAMONDS.   The chief of an Indian tribe had two sons whom he loved very dearly. This chief was at war with another tribe, and one dark night two of his enemies crept softly through the trees till they came to where the two boys lay sound asleep. The warriors caught the younger boy up gently, and carried him far "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22424"],["title","Frank Merriwell Down South (#0)"],["body","Team      [Illustration: \"'What's that!' howled the little professor, dancing about in his night robe.\" (See page 109)]   Frank Merriwell Down South  BY  BURT L.

CHAPTER I.  A WONDERFUL STORY.   \"It is in the heart of the Sierra Madre range, one hundred and twenty-five miles west of Zacatecas,\" said the dying man. \"Across the blue chasm you can see its towers and turrets glistening in the sunshine. It is like a beautiful dream--dazzling, astounding, grand!\"  \"He wanders in his mind,\" softly declared Professor Scotch. \"Poor fellow! His brain was turned and he was brought to his death by his fruitless search for the mythical Silver Palace.\"  The man who lay on a bed of grass in one corner of the wretched adobe hut turned a reproachful look on the little professor.  \"You are wrong,\" he asserted, in a voice that seemed to have gained strength for the moment. \"I am not deranged--I am not deceived by an hallucination. With my eyes I have seen the wonderful Silver Palace--yes, more than that, I have stood within the palace and beheld the marvelous treasures which it contains.\"  The professor turned away to hide the look on his face, but Frank Merriwell, deeply interested, bent over the unfortunate man, asking:  \"By what route can this wonderful palace be reached?\"  \"There is no route. Between us and the Silver Palace lie waterless deserts, great mountains, and, at last, a yawning chasm, miles in width, miles in depth. This chasm extends entirely round the broad plateau on which the wonderful palace stands like a dazzling dream. The bottom of the chasm is hidden by mists which assume fantastic forms, and whirl and sway and dash forward and backward, like battling armies. Indians fear the place; Mexicans hold it in superstitious horror. It is said that these mist-like forms are the ghosts of warriors dead and gone, a wonderful people who built the Silver Palace in the days of Cortez--built it where the Spaniard could not reach and despoil it.\"  Despite his doubts, the professor was listening with strong interest to this remarkable tale.  The fourth person in the hut was the Dutch boy, Hans Dunnerwust, who sat on the ground, his back against the wall, his jaw dropped and his eyes bulging. Occasionally, as he listened to the words of the dying man, he would mutter:  \"Chimminy Gristmas!\"  For several weeks Frank Merriwell, our hero, Hans, his chum, and Professor Scotch, his guardian, had been exploring the country around the city of Mendoza, Mexico. They had come to Mexico after having numerous adventures in our own country, as related in \"Frank Merriwell Out West,\" a former volume of this series.  Only a short hour before they had run across the sufferer, whose head seemed so full of the things he had seen at what he called the Silver Palace. They had found him almost dead in a hut at the edge of a sandy plain, suffering great pain and calling loudly for aid. They had done what they could, and then he had begun to talk, as related above.  With surprising strength the man on the bed of grass sat up, stretching out his hands, gazing across the sunlit sand-plain beyond the open door of the hut, and went on:  \"I see it now--I see it once again! There, there--see it gleaming like a dazzling diamond in the sunshine! See its beautiful towers and turrets! That dome is of pure gold! Within those walls are treasures untold! There are great vaults of gold and silver ornaments, bars and ingots! There are precious stones in profusion! And all this treasure would make a thousand men rich for life! But it's not for me--it's lost to me forever!\"  With a stifled moan, he fell back into Frank's arms, and was lowered on the bed of grass.  Professor Scotch hastily felt the man's pulse, listened for the beating of his heart, and then cried:  \"Quick, Frank--the brandy! It may be too late, but we'll try to give him a few more minutes of life.\"  \"That's right!\" palpitated Frank. \"Bring him back to consciousness, for we have not yet learned how to reach the Silver Palace.\"  \"There is no such place as the Silver Palace,\" sharply declared the professor, as he forced a few drops of brandy between the lips of the unfortunate man. \"The fellow has dreamed it.\"  \"Perhaps.\"  \"Perhaps! Why, Frank, I took you for a boy of more sense! Think--think of the absurdity! It is impossible!\"  \"It may be.\"  \"I know it is.\"  \"Vell, maype you don'd nefer peen misdooken, brofessor?\" insinuated Hans, recovering for a moment from his dazed condition.  The professor did not notice the Dutch boy's words, for the man on the bed of grass drew a long, fluttering breath and slowly opened his eyes.  \"I thought I saw the palace once more,\" he whispered. \"It was all a delusion.\"  \"That is true,\" nodded the professor, \"it is all a delusion. Such a place as this Silver Palace is an absurd impossibility. The illness through which you have passed has affected your mind, and you dreamed of the palace.\"  \"It is not so!\" returned the man, reproachfully. \"I have proof! You doubt me--you will not believe?\"  \"Be calm--be quiet,\" urged the professor. \"This excitement will cut your life short by minutes, and minutes are precious to you now.\"  \"That is true; minutes are precious,\" hastily whispered the man. \"It is not the fever I am dying of--no, no! The water from the spring you may see behind the hut--it has destroyed many people. This morning, before you came, a peon found me here. He told me--he said the spring was poison. The water robs men of strength--of life. I could not understand him well. He went away and left me. I could see him running across the desert, as if from a plague. And now I am dying--dying!\"  \"But the Silver Palace?\" observed Frank Merriwell. \"You are forgetting that.\"  \"Yah,\" nodded the Dutch lad; \"you peen forgetting dot, ain'd id?\"  \"The proof,\" urged Frank. \"You say you have proof.\"  \"Yah,\" put in Hans; \"you say you haf der broof. Vere id peen?\"  \"It is here,\" declared the unfortunate, as he fumbled beneath the straw. \"You are my countrymen--you have been kind to me. Alwin Bushnell may never return. It is terrible to think all that treasure may be lost--lost forever!\"  \"Who is Alwin Bushnell?\"  \"My partner--the one who was with me when I found the palace.\"  \"Where is he now?\"  \"Heaven knows! He went for another balloon.\"  \"Another balloon?\"  \"Yes; it was with the aid of a balloon that we reached the Silver Palace. Without it we could not have crossed the gulf.\"  \"Absurd!\" muttered the professor.  Despite the fact that the word was merely murmured, the miserable man on the bed of grass did not fail to catch it.  \"Oh, I will convince even you!\" he exclaimed, gasping for breath, and continuing to fumble beneath the straw. \"You shall see--you shall know! But our balloon--we had no means of obtaining a further supply of gas. It was barely sufficient to take us across the gulf, with a few pieces of treasure. We struck against the side of the bluff--we were "]]]
