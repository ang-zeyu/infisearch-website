In this upset of his life, and aggravation of distress, we are to suppose our prodigal almost driven to desperation. Now, for the first time, he feels the severe effects of pinching cold and griping hunger. At this melancholy season, reflection finds a passage to his heart, and he now revolves in his mind the folly and sinfulness of his past life;--considers within himself how idly he has wasted the substance he is at present in the utmost need of;--looks back with shame on the iniquity of his actions, and forward with horror on the rueful scene of misery that awaits him; until his brain, torn with excruciating thought, loses at once its power of thinking, and falls a sacrifice to merciless despair.      Mr. Ireland remarks, on the plate before us:--\"Our improvident     spendthrift is now lodged in that dreary receptacle of human     misery,--a prison. His countenance exhibits a picture of despair;     the forlorn state of his mind is displayed in every limb, and his     exhausted finances, by the turnkey's demand of prison fees, not     being answered, and the boy refusing to leave a tankard of porter,     unless he is paid for it.      \"We see by the enraged countenance of his wife, that she is     violently reproaching him for having deceived and ruined her. To     crown this catalogue of human tortures, the poor girl whom he     deserted, is come with her child--perhaps to comfort him,--to     alleviate his sorrows, to soothe his sufferings:--but the agonising     view is too much for her agitated frame; shocked at the prospect of     that misery which she cannot remove, every object swims before her     eyes,--a film covers the sight,--the blood forsakes her cheeks--her     lips assume a pallid hue,--and she sinks to the floor of the prison     in temporary death. What a heart-rending prospect for him by whom     this is occasioned!      \"The wretched, squalid inmate, who is assisting the fainting female,     bears every mark of being naturalised to the place; out of his     pocket hangs a scroll, on which is inscribed, 'A scheme to pay the     National Debt, by J. L. now a prisoner in the Fleet.' So attentive     was this poor gentleman to the debts of the nation, that he totally     forgot his own. The cries of the child, and the good-natured     attentions of the women, heighten the interest, and realise the     scene. Over the group are a large pair of wings, with which some     emulator of _Dedalus_ intended to escape from his confinement; but     finding them inadequate to the execution of his project, has placed     them upon the tester of his bed. They would not exalt him to the     regions of air, but they o'ercanopy him on earth. A chemist in the     back-ground, happy in his views, watching the moment of projection,     is not to be disturbed from his dream by any thing less than the     fall of the roof, or the bursting of his retort;--and if his dream     affords him felicity, why should he be awakened? The bed and     gridiron, those poor remnants of our miserable spendthrift's     wretched property, are brought here as necessary in his degraded     situation; on one he must try to repose his wearied frame, on the     other, he is to dress his scanty meal.\"  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 7.  PRISON SCENE.]     PLATE VIII.  SCENE IN A MADHOUSE.      \"_Madness!_ thou chaos of the brain,       }     What art, that pleasure giv'st and pain?   }     Tyranny of fancy's reign!     Mechanic _fancy!_ that can build     Vast labyrinths and mazes wild,     With rude, disjointed, shapeless measure,     Fill'd with _horror_, fill'd with _pleasure_!     Shapes of _horror_, that would even     Cast doubt of mercy upon Heaven;     Shapes of _pleasure_, that but seen,     Would split the shaking sides of _Spleen_.      \"O vanity of age! here see     The stamp of Heaven effaced by thee!     The headstrong course of youth thus run,     What comfort from this darling son?     His rattling chains with terror hear,     Behold death grappling with despair!     See him by thee to ruin sold,     And curse _thyself_, and curse thy _gold_!\"   See our hero then, in the scene before us, raving in all the dismal horrors of hopeless insanity, in the hospital of Bethlehem, the senate of mankind, where each man may find a representative; there we behold him trampling on the first great law of nature, tearing himself to pieces with his own hands, and chained by the leg to prevent any further mischief he might either do to himself or others. But in this scene, dreary and horrid as are its accompaniments, he is attended by the faithful and kind-hearted female whom he so basely betrayed. In the first plate we see him refuse her his promised hand. In the fourth, she releases him from the harpy fangs of a bailiff; she is present at his marriage; and in the hope of relieving his distress, she follows him to a prison. Our artist, in this scene of horror, has taken an opportunity of pointing out to us the various causes of mental blindness; for such, surely, it may be called, when the intuitive faculties are either destroyed or impaired. In one of the inner rooms of this gallery is a despairing wretch, imploring Heaven for mercy, whose brain is crazed with lip-labouring superstition, the most dreadful enemy of human kind; which, attended with ignorance, error, penance and indulgence, too often deprives its unhappy votaries of their senses. The next in view is one man drawing lines upon a wall, in order, if possible, to find out the longitude; and another, before him, looking through a paper, by way of a telescope. By these expressive figures we are given to understand that such is the misfortune of man, that while, perhaps, the aspiring soul is pursuing some lofty and elevated conception, soaring to an uncommon pitch, and teeming with some grand discovery, the ferment often proves too strong for the feeble brain to support, and lays the whole magazine of notions and images in wild confusion. This melancholy group is completed by the crazy tailor, who is staring at the mad astronomer with a sort of wild astonishment, wondering, through excess of ignorance, what discoveries the heavens can possibly afford; proud of his profession, he has fixed a variety of patterns in his hat, by way of ornament; has covered his poor head with shreds, and makes his measure the constant object of his attention. Behind this man stands another, playing on the violin, with his book upon his head, intimating that too great a love for music has been the cause of his distraction. On the stairs sits another, crazed by love, (evident from the picture of his beloved object round his neck, and the words \"charming Betty Careless\" upon the bannisters, which he is supposed to scratch upon every wall and every wainscot,) and wrapt up so close in melancholy pensiveness, as not even to observe the dog that is flying at him. Behind him, and in the inner room, are two persons maddened with ambition. These men, though under the influence of the same passion, are actuated by different notions; one is for the papal dignity, the other for regal; one imagines himself the Pope, and saying mass; the other fancies himself a King, is encircled with the emblem of royalty, and is casting contempt on his imaginary subjects by an act of the greatest disdain. To brighten this distressful scene, and draw a smile from him whose rigid reasoning might condemn the bringing into public view this blemish of humanity, are two women introduced, walking in the gallery, as curious spectators of this melancholy sight; one of whom is supposed, in a whisper, to bid the other observe the naked man, which she takes an opportunity of doing by a leer through the sticks of her fan.  Thus, imagining the hero of our piece to expire raving mad, the story is finished, and little else remains but to close it with a proper application. Reflect then, ye parents, on this tragic tale; consider with yourselves, that the ruin of a child is too often owing to the imprudence of a father. Had the young man, whose story we have related, been taught the proper use of money, had his parent given him some insight into life, and graven, as it were, upon his heart, the precepts of religion, with an abhorrence of vice, our youth would, in all probability, have taken a contrary course, lived a credit to his friends, and an honour to his country.  [Illustration: THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.  PLATE 8.  SCENE IN BEDLAM.]     THE DISTRESSED POET.   This Plate describes, in the strongest colours, the distress of an author without friends to patronise him. Seated upon the side of his bed, without a shirt, but wrapped in an old night-gown, he is now spinning a poem upon \"Riches:\" of their _use_ he probably knoweth little; and of their _abuse_,--if judgment can be formed from externals,--_certes_, he knoweth less. Enchanted, impressed, inspired with his subject, he is disturbed by a nymph of the _lactarium_. Her shrill-sounding voice awakes one of the _little loves_, whose _chorus_ disturbs his meditations. A link of the golden chain is broken!--a thought is lost!--to recover it, his hand becomes a substitute for the barber's comb:--enraged at the noise, he tortures his head for the fleeting idea; but, ah! no thought is there!  Proudly conscious that the lines already written are sterling, he possesses by anticipation the mines of Peru, a view of which hangs over his head. Upon the table we see \"Byshe's Art of Poetry;\" for, like the pack-horse, who cannot travel without his _bells_, he cannot climb the hill of Parnassus without his _jingling-book_. On the floor lies the \"Grub-street Journal,\" to which valuable repository of genius and taste he is probably a contributor. To show that he is a master of the PROFOUND, and will envelope his subject in a cloud, his pipe and tobacco-b"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22500"],["title","The Works of William Hogarth: In a Series of Engravings (#7)"],["body","ox, those friends to cogitation deep, are close to him.  His wife, mending that part of his dress, in the pockets of which the affluent keep their gold, is worthy of a better fate. Her figure is peculiarly interesting. Her face, softened by adversity, and marked with domestic care, is at this moment agitated by the appearance of a boisterous woman, insolently demanding payment of the milk-tally. In the excuse she returns, there is a mixture of concern, complacency, and mortification. As an addition to the distresses of this poor family, a dog is stealing the remnant of mutton incautiously left upon a chair.  The sloping roof, and projecting chimney, prove the throne of this inspired bard to be high above the crowd;--it is a garret. The chimney is ornamented with a _dare for larks_, and a book; a loaf, the tea-equipage, and a saucepan, decorate the shelf. Before the fire hangs half a shirt, and a pair of ruffled sleeves. His sword lies on the floor; for though our professor of poetry waged no war, except with words, a sword was, in the year 1740, a necessary appendage to every thing which called itself \"gentleman.\" At the feet of his domestic seamstress, the full-dress coat is become the resting-place of a cat and two kittens: in the same situation is one stocking, the other is half immersed in the washing-pan. The broom, bellows, and mop, are scattered round the room. The open door shows us that their cupboard is unfurnished, and tenanted by a hungry and solitary mouse. In the corner hangs a long cloak, well calculated to conceal the threadbare wardrobe of its fair owner.  Mr. Hogarth's strict attention to propriety of scenery, is evinced by the cracked plaistering of the walls, broken window, and uneven floor, in the miserable habitation of this poor weaver of madrigals. When this was first published, the following quotation from Pope's \"Dunciad\" was inscribed under the print:      \"Studious he sate, _with all his books_ around,     Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profound:     Plunged for his sense, but found no bottom there;     Then wrote and flounder'd on, in mere despair.\"  _All his books_, amounting to _only four_, was, I suppose, the artist's reason for erasing the lines.  [Illustration: THE DISTRESSED POET.]     THE BENCH.  CHARACTER, CARICATURA, AND OUTRE.   It having been universally acknowledged that Mr. Hogarth was one of the most ingenious painters of his age, and a man possessed of a vast store of humour, which he has sufficiently shown and displayed in his numerous productions; the general approbation his works receive, is not to be wondered at. But, as owing to the false notions of the public, not thoroughly acquainted with the true art of painting, he has been often called a _caricaturer_; when, in reality, _caricatura_ was no part of his profession, he being a true copier of Nature; to set this matter right, and give the world a just definition of the words, _character_, _caricatura_, and _outré_, in which humorous painting principally consists, and to show their difference of meaning, he, in the year 1758, published this print; but, as it did not quite answer his purpose, giving an illustration of the word _character_ only, he added, in the year 1764, the group of heads above, which he never lived to finish, though he worked upon it the day before his death. The lines between inverted commas are our author's own words, and are engraved at the bottom of the plate.  \"There are hardly any two things more essentially different than _character_ and _caricatura_; nevertheless, they are usually confounded, and mistaken for each other; on which account this explanation is attempted.  \"It has ever been allowed, that when a _character_ is strongly marked in the living face, it may be considered as an index of the mind, to express which, with any degree of justness, in painting, requires the utmost efforts of a great master. Now that, which has of late years got the name of _caricatura_, is, or ought to be, totally divested of every stroke that hath a tendency to good drawing; it may be said to be a species of lines that are produced, rather by the hand of chance, than of skill; for the early scrawlings of a child, which do but barely hint the idea of a human face, will always be found to be like some person or other, and will often form such a comical resemblance, as, in all probability, the most eminent _caricaturers_ of these times will not be able to equal, with design; because their ideas of objects are so much more perfect than children's, that they will, unavoidably, introduce some kind of drawing; for all the humorous effects of the fashionable manner of _caricaturing_, chiefly depend on the surprise we are under, at finding ourselves caught with any sort of similitude in objects absolutely remote in their kind. Let it be observed, the more remote in their nature, the greater is the excellence of these pieces. As a proof of this, I remember a famous _caricatura_ of a certain Italian singer, that struck at first sight, which consisted only of a straight perpendicular stroke, with a dot over. As to the French word _outré_, it is different from the rest, and signifies nothing more than the exaggerated outlines of a figure, all the parts of which may be, in other respects, a perfect and true picture of nature. A giant or a dwarf may be called a common man, _outré_. So any part, as a nose, or a leg, made bigger, or less than it ought to be, is that part _outré_, which is all that is to be understood by this word, injudiciously used to the prejudice of _character_.\"--ANALYSIS OF BEAUTY, chap. vi.  To prevent these distinctions being looked upon as dry and unentertaining, our author has, in this group of faces, ridiculed the want of capacity among some of our judges, or dispensers of the law, whose shallow discernment, natural disposition, or wilful inattention, is here perfectly described in their faces. One is amusing himself in the course of trial, with other business; another, in all the pride of self-importance, is examining a former deposition, wholly inattentive to that before him; the next is busied in thoughts quite foreign to the subject; and the senses of the last are locked fast in sleep.  The four sages on the Bench, are intended for Lord Chief Justice Sir John Willes, the principal figure; on his right hand, Sir Edward Clive; and on his left, Mr. Justice Bathurst, and the Hon. William Noel.  [Illustration: THE BENCH.]     THE LAUGHING AUDIENCE.      \"Let him laugh now, who never laugh'd before;     And he who always laugh'd, laugh now the more.\"   \"From the first print that Hogarth engraved, to the last that he published, I do not think,\" says Mr. Ireland, \"there is one, in which character is more displayed than in this very spirited little etching. It is much superior to the more delicate engravings from his designs by other artists, and I prefer it to those that were still higher finished by his own burin.  \"The prim coxcomb with an enormous bag, whose favours, like those of Hercules between Virtue and Vice, are contended for by two rival orange girls, gives an admirable idea of the dress of the day; when, if we may judge from this print, our grave forefathers, defying Nature, and despising convenience, had a much higher rank in the temple of Folly than was then attained by their ladies. It must be acknowledged that, since that period, the softer sex have asserted their natural rights; and, snatching the wreath of fashion from the brow of presuming man, have tortured it into such forms that, were it possible, which _certes_ it is not, to disguise a beauteous face----But to the high behest of Fashion all must bow.  \"Governed by this idol, our beau has a cuff that, for a modern fop, would furnish fronts for a waistcoat, and a family fire-screen might be made of his enormous bag. His bare and shrivelled neck has a close resemblance to that of a half-starved greyhound; and his face, figure, and air, form a fine contrast to the easy and degagée assurance of the Grisette whom he addresses.  \"The opposite figure, nearly as grotesque, though not quite so formal as its companion, presses its left hand upon its breast, in the style of protestation; and, eagerly contemplating the superabundant charms of a beauty of Rubens's school, presents her with a pinch of comfort. Every muscle, every line of his countenance, is acted upon by affectation and grimace, and his queue bears some resemblance to an ear-trumpet.  \"The total inattention of these three polite persons to the business of the stage, which at this moment almost convulses the children of Nature who are seated in the pit, is highly descriptive of that refined apathy which characterises our people of fashion, and raises them above those mean passions that agitate the groundlings.  \"One gentleman, indeed, is as affectedly unaffected as a man of the first world. By his saturnine cast of face, and contracted brow, he is evidently a profound critic, and much too wise to laugh. He must indisputably be a very great critic; for, like _Voltaire's Poccocurante_, nothing can please him; and, while those around open every avenue of their minds to mirth, and are willing to be delighted, though they do not well know why, he analyses the drama by the laws of Aristotle, and finding those laws are violated, determines that the author ought to be hissed, instead of being applauded. This it is to be so excellent a judge; this it is which gives a critic that exalted gratification which can never be attained by the illiterate,--the supreme power of pointing out faults, where others discern nothing but beauties, and preserving a rigid inflexibility of muscle, while the sides of the vulgar herd are shaking with laughter. These merry mortals, thinking with Plato that it is no proof of a good stomach to nauseate every aliment presented them, do not inquire too nicely into causes, but, giving full scope to their risibility, display a set of features more"]]]
