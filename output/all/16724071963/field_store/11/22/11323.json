CHAPTER II  THE CONSONANTS   1. PRONUNCIATION OF THE CONSONANTS.  §19.  The MHG. consonant-system was represented by the following letters:   b, c, ch, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r,   s, sch, t, v, w, (x), z, ȥ.  The letters k, l, m, n, p, t, w, (x) had nearly the same sound-values as in English. The remaining letters require special attention.  When the pronunciation of consonants merely differs in the intensity or force with which they are produced, they are called fortes or lenes according as they are produced with more or less intensity or force. In MHG. the consonants {b, d, g} were not voiced explosives like English {b, d, g}, but were voiceless lenes, and only differed from the fortes {p, t, k} in being produced with less intensity or force, see §33. A similar difference in pronunciation existed between antevocalic and intervocalic {v, s} and final {f, s}, see §33.  {c} and {k} represented the same sound. The latter was generally used at the beginning, and the former at the end of a syllable, as {kunst}, _art_; {trinken}, _to drink_, {senken}, _to sink_ (trans.), pret. {tranc}, {sancte}.  {ch} had the same sound as in NHG. {nacht}, {noch}, as {sprechen}, _to speak_, pret. {sprach}; {hōch}, _high_.  {f} had a twofold pronunciation in the oldest HG. It was a labiodental when it arose from Germanic {f} (cp. OHG. {fater}, English {father}), and bilabial when it arose from Germanic {p} (cp. inf. OHG. {slāfan}, English {sleep}), but during the OHG. period the bilabial {f} became labiodental. The two kinds of {f} did not however completely fall together in pronunciation. {f} = Germanic {f} became a lenis initially before and medially between vowels, and was often written {v} in the former and generally {v} in the latter position, but remained a fortis--written {f}--when final. In MHG. it was also often written {f} initially before {l, r, u}, as {fliehen}, _to flee_, {fride}, _peace_, {fünf}, _five_, beside {vliehen}, {vride}, {vünf}. On the other hand {f} = Germanic {p} (§23, 1), which only occurred medially and finally, was a fortis and was always written {f} ({ff}), as {slāfen}, _to sleep_, pret. {slief}; {tief}, _deep_, {schif} (gen. {schiffes}), _ship_, {offen}, _open_. The two {f} sounds thus fell together when final, but the distinction between the two sounds was still preserved in MHG. in the intervocalic position, as {hof}, _court_, {schif}, _ship_, but gen. {hoves}, {schiffes}.  {h} before and after consonants was pronounced like {ch}, as {fuhs}, _fox_, {naht}, _night_, {bevëlhen}, _to confide._ In other cases it had the same sound as the {h} in English {hat}.  {j} had nearly the same sound as the {y} in English {yet}, as {jār}, _year_, {junc}, _young_; {blüejen}, _to blossom._  {q} occurred only in combination with {u} as in English, as {quëc}, _quick, alive_, {quëden}, _to say._  {r} was a trilled sound in all positions like Scotch {r}, as {rōt}, _red_, {hart}, _hard_, {bërn}, _to bear_, {vater}, _father._  {s} was a lenis medially between vowels and probably also initially before vowels, but a fortis in other positions, as {sun}, _son_, {wësen}, _to be_, pret. {was}, {bresten}, _to burst_. It may be pronounced like the {s} in English {sit}.  {sch} was like the {sh} in English {ship}, as {schif}, _ship_, {geschëhen}, _to happen_, {visch}, _fish._  {v} was a voiceless lenis, and may be pronounced like the {v} in NHG. {voll}. See {f}.  {w} was pronounced like the {w} in English {wet}, as {wīn}, _wine_, {bliuwen}, _to strike._  {z} and {ȥ} were not distinguished in MHG. manuscripts, both being written {z}. Both {z} and {ȥ} (but {ȥȥ} medially between vowels when the first vowel was short) arose from Germanic {t} (see §23). {z} had the sound-value of {ts} (= NHG. {z}): (_a_) always initially, as {zīt}, _time_; (_b_) medially and finally after consonants ({l, m}, {n, r}), as {holz} (gen. {holzes}), _wood_, {hërze}, _heart_, {smërze}, _pain_, {ganz}, _whole_; (_c_) finally after vowels (= Germanic {tt}) in those words which change final {z} to {tz} when it becomes medial, as {schaz} (gen. {schatzes}), OE. {sceatt}, _money, treasure_. MHG. intervocalic {tz} always arose from older {tt}, as {setzen} = OE. {settan}, _to set_. {ȥ} was a kind of lisped {s} and only occurred medially between and finally after vowels, as {bīȥen}, _to bite_, {ëȥȥen}, _to eat_, {haȥ}, _hatred_. It should be noted that good MHG. poets never rhymed pairs of words like {was}, _was_, and {waȥ}, _what_; {missen}, _to miss_, and {wiȥȥen}, _to know_.  {ph} and {pf} represent the same sound, viz. the {pf} in NHG. {pfund}, _pound_.   §20.  MHG. has the following double consonants medially between vowels: {bb, gg}; {p, tt, ck}; {ff, ss, ȥȥ}; {mm, nn}; {ll, rr}. They were always pronounced long as in Italian and Swedish, as {bit-ter}, _bitter_, {ëȥ-ȥen}, _to eat_, {küs-sen}, _to kiss_, {müg-ge}, _midge_, {rin-nen}, _to run_. In NHG. double consonants are never long, they merely indicate that the preceding vowel is short.   §21.  {Phonetic Survey of the MHG. Consonants.}                   LABIAL.

CONSONANT CHANGES.  §22.  The most characteristic difference between High German and the other West Germanic languages is the shifting which the consonants {p, t, k, þ}; {pp, tt, kk, þþ}; {b (ƀ), d, g (ʒ)}; {bb, dd, gg} underwent partly in the prehistoric and partly in the historic period of Old High German. In the following treatment of what is generally called the High German sound-shifting only such points are considered as are of importance for the purposes of this book. See Old High German Primer, §§82-6.   §23.  The voiceless explosives p, t, k underwent a two-fold treatment according to their position in the word: (1) Medially or finally after vowels; (2) Initially, medially and finally after consonants (l, m, n, r), and when doubled.    NOTE.--p, t, k remained unshifted in the combinations sp,   st, sk as also t in the combinations tr, ht, ft.  1. Single p, t, k were shifted to the voiceless double spirants ff, ȥȥ, hh (also written ch) = MHG. ff (f), ȥȥ (ȥ), ch.  p > ff. OE. {open}, OHG. {offan}, MHG. {offen}, _open_; OE. {slǣpan}, OHG. {slāffan}, MHG. {slāfen}, _to sleep_; OE. {ūp}, OHG. MHG. {ūf}, _up_.  t > ȥȥ. OE. {etan}, OHG. {ëȥȥan}, MHG. {ëȥȥen}, _to eat_; OE. {hātan}, OHG. {heiȥȥan}, MHG. {heiȥen}, _to call_; OE. {hwæt}, OHG. {hwaȥ}, MHG. {waȥ}, _what_. In a few cases the {ȥ, ȥȥ} became {s} in MHG. before {t} or {st}, as pret. {saste} from {saȥte}: {setzen}, _to set_; {beste}, _best_, {leste}, _last_ = OHG. {beȥȥisto}, {leȥȥisto}.  k > hh. OE. {ic}, OHG. {ih}, MHG. {ich}, _I_; OE. {sprecan} ({specan}), OHG. {sprëhhan}, MHG. {sprëchen}, _to speak_; OE. {tācen}, OHG. {zeihhan}, MHG. {zeichen}, _token_. This {ch} must not be confused with the MHG. {h, ch} which corresponded to Indo-Germanic {k} (= Germanic {h}), as {ziehen}, _to draw, lead_, pret. {zōch}, cp. Lat. {dūcō}, _I lead_, see §34.  The double consonants were simplified in OHG. and MHG. according to §32.  2. {p}, {t} initially, medially and finally after consonants (l, m, n, r), and when doubled, were shifted to the affricatae {pf} (also written {ph}), {tz} (generally written {zz} and {z}) = MHG. {pf} ({ph}), {tz} ({z}).  p > pf. OE. {pund}, OHG. MHG. {pfunt}, _pound_; OE. {gelimpan}, OHG. {gilimpfan}, MHG. {gelimpfen}, _to be meet_; OE. {scieppan}, OHG. {skepfen}, MHG. {schepfen}, _to create_. The {pf} became {f} after {l} and {r} already in OHG., as {hëlfan}, MHG. {hëlfen}, OE. {helpan}, _to help_; {wërfan}, MHG. {wërfen}, OE. {weorpan}, _to throw_.  t > z. OE. {tunge}, OHG. {zunga}, MHG. {zunge}, _tongue_; OE. {heorte}, OHG. {hërza}, MHG. {hërze}, _heart_; OE. {sealt}, OHG. MHG. {salz}, _salt_; OE. {sittan}, OHG. {sizzen}, {sitzen}, MHG. {sitzen}, _to sit_; OE. {sceatt}, OHG. {scaz} (gen. {scazzes}, {scatzes}), MHG. {schaz} (gen. {schatzes}), _money, treasure_.  {k}, {kk} (written {ck}) remained unshifted (except in High Alemanic), as OE. {corn}, OHG. MHG. {korn}, _corn_; OE. {cnēo}, OHG. {kneo}, MHG. {knie}, _knee_; OE. {sincan}, OHG. {sinkan}, MHG. {sinken}, _to sink_, pret. {sanc}; OE. {þeccan}, OHG. MHG. {decken}, _to cover_.   §24.  {þ} became {d}, and {þþ} became {tt}, as OE. {þorn}, OHG. MHG. {dorn}, _thorn_; OE. {brōþor}, OHG. MHG. {bruoder}, _brother_. OE. {smiþþe}, OHG. {smitta}, MHG. {smitte}, _smithy_; OE. {moþþe}, late MHG. {motte}, _moth_.   §25.  The voiced explosives {b, d, g}, and the voiced spirants {ƀ, ʒ} did not undergo the same universal shifting as the voiceless explosives. {ƀ, ʒ} became {b, g}. {b, g} remained, and {d} became {t}, as OE. {brōþor}, OHG. MHG. {bruoder}, _brother_; OE. {bēodan}, OHG. {biotan}, MHG. {bieten}, _to offer_; Goth. {giban} (= {giƀan}),"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22636"],["title","A Middle High German Primer (#6)"],["body"," OHG. {gëban}, MHG. {gëben}, _to give_. OE. {dohtor}, OHG. MHG. {tohter}, _daughter_; OE. {bēodan}, OHG. {biotan}, MHG. {bieten}, _to offer_; OE. {dēad}, OHG. MHG. {tōt}, _dead_. OE. {gōd}, OHG. MHG. {guot}, _good_; OE. {flēogan}, OHG. {fliogan}, MHG. {fliegen}, _to fly_.   §26.  The double consonants {bb, dd, gg} = OHG. {pp (bb), tt, cc (gg)}, and MHG. {pp (b), {tt, ck (gg)}, as OE. {sibb}, OHG. {sippa} ({sibba}), MHG. {sippe} ({sibbe}), _relationship_; OE. {cribb}, OHG. {krippa} ({kribba}), MHG. {krippe (kribbe)}, _crib_. OE. {biddan}, OHG. {bitten}, MHG. {bitten}, later {biten}, _to request_; OE. {þridda}, OHG. {dritto}, MHG. {dritte}, later {drite}, _third_. OE. {brycg}, OHG. {brucca (brugga)}, MHG. {brücke} ({brügge}), _bridge_. The fluctuation in the writing of {pp} and {bb}, {ck} and {gg} is merely orthographical, and does not represent a difference in pronunciation. Both pairs were used to express the lenes medially between vowels. For other examples see §31.   §27.  The summary of the consonantal changes in §§23-6 may be expressed as follows:--    WEST GERMANIC.                     MHG.   p; t; k; þ      = ff (f), pf; ȥȥ (ȥ), z;  ch; d.   pp; tt; kk; þþ  =         pf;    tz (z);  ck; tt.   b (ƀ); d; g (ʒ) = b;           t;         g.   bb; dd; gg      = pp (bb);    tt;         ck (gg).   §28.  The following sound-changes took place in primitive Germanic:--Every labial + {t} became {ft}; every guttural + {t} became {ht}; every dental + {t} became {ss}, which was simplified to {s} after long vowels. This explains the frequent interchange in MHG. between {pf, b} and {f}; between {k, g} and {h}; and between {ȥȥ, ȥ} and {ss, s} in forms which are etymologically related.  {pf}, {b}--{f}. {schepfen}, _to create_: {geschaft}, _creature_; {gëben}, _to give_: {gift}, _gift_; {wëben}, _to weave_: English {weft}.  {k}, {g}--{h}. {würken}, _to work_: pret. {worhte}; {denken}, _to think_: pret. {dāhte}; {mugen} ({mügen}), _to be able_: pret. {mohte}; {bringen}, _to bring_: pret. {brāhte}.  {ȥȥ}, {ȥ}--{ss}, {s}. {gieȥen}, _to pour_: {güsse}, _inundation_; {wiȥȥen}, _to know_: pret. {wisse (wiste): wīs}, _wise_; {muoȥ}, _must_: pret. {muose} ({muoste}); {ëȥȥen}, _to eat_: {ās}, _carrion_. Preterites like {wiste}, {muoste} were formed after the analogy of preterites like {worhte}, {dāhte}, where the {t} was regular.   §29.  The guttural nasal {ŋ} (written n) only occurred in the combinations {nk} ({nc}) and {ng}. It disappeared before {h} (= prim. Germanic {χ}) in primitive Germanic with lengthening of a preceding short vowel, as {vāhen} from prim. Germanic {*faŋχanan}, _to seize, catch_, beside p.p. {gevangen}; and similarly {hāhen}, _to hang_, p.p. {gehangen}; pret. {brāhte}, {dāhte}, {dūhte}, beside {bringen}, _to bring_, {denken}, _to think_, {dunken}, _to seem_.  The guttural nasal disappeared in an unstressed syllable when preceded by an {n} in a stressed syllable in the course of the OHG. and MHG. period, as OHG. {honag}, MHG. {honec}, beside OHG. {honang}, _honey_; OHG. {kunig}, MHG. {künec}, beside OHG. {kuning}, _king_; OHG. {pfennig}, MHG. {pfennic}, beside OHG. {pfenning}, MHG. {pfenninc}, penny. And similarly with dental {n}, as {senede} beside {senende}, _longing, yearning_.   §30.  Strong verbs, which have a medial {v} ({f}), {d, h, s} in the present, have respectively {b, t, g} ({ng}), {r} in the second person sing. pret. indicative, the preterite plural indicative, the pret. subjunctive and the past participle. This interchange of consonants is called Verner’s Law, see OHG. Primer, §§72, 87:--                    INF.               PRET. PL.    P.P.   v(f)--b.      heven, _to raise_     huoben    gehaben.   d--t.         mīden, _to avoid_     miten     gemiten.                 snīden, _to cut_      sniten    gesniten.   h--g.         dīhen, _to thrive_    digen     gedigen.                 ziehen, _to draw_     zugen     gezogen.                 slahen, _to strike_   sluogen   geslagen.   h--ng (§29).  hāhen, _to hang_      hiengen   gehangen.                 vāhen, _to catch_     viengen   gevangen.   s--r.         rīsen, _to fall_      rirn      gerirn.                 kiesen, _to choose_   kurn      gekorn.  This law has, however, many exceptions in MHG. owing to levelling having taken place with the infinitive, present indicative and preterite singular, as {risen}, {gerisen} beside {rirn}, {gerirn}.  The same interchange of consonants exists between strong verbs and their corresponding causative weak verbs, as {līden}, _to go_: {leiten}, _to lead_; {hāhen}, _to hang_: {hengen}, _to hang_ (trans.); {ge-nësen}, _to be saved_: {nern}, _to save_; and in nouns, &c., as {hof} (gen. {hoves}), _court_: {hübesch}, _courtly_; {tōt} (gen. {tōdes}), _death_: {tōt} (gen. {tōtes}), _dead_; {swëher}, _father-in-law_: {swiger}, _mother-in-law_; {hase}: English {hare}.   §31.  The doubling of consonants took place under certain well-defined rules partly in prim. Germanic and partly in prim. West Germanic, see the Author’s Hist. Germ. Grammar, §§202, 213-14. Examples of words which had double consonants in prim. Germanic are: {kopf}, head; {napf} (OE. {hnæp}, gen. {hnæppes}), _basin_; {boc} (OE. {bucca}), _buck_, gen. {bockes}; {rinnen}, _to run_; {swimmen}, _to swim_; {vol} (gen. {volles}), _full_; {vërre}, _far_; {gewisser}, _certain_.  The chief cases in which double consonants arose in prim. West Germanic were:--  1. The assimilation of {ƀn, ʒn, pn} to {bb, gg, pp} = MHG. {pp, ck (gg), pf}, as {knappe}: {knabe}, _boy_; {rappe}: {rabe}, _raven_; {rocke}: {rogge}, _rye_; {tropfe}, _drop_: {triefen}, _to drip_.  2. {p, t, k} were doubled before a following {r} or {l}. The doubling regularly took place in the inflected forms, and was then extended to the uninflected forms by levelling, as {apfel} (OE. {æppel}), _apple_; {kupfer} (Lat. {cuprum}), _copper_; {bitter} (Goth. {báitrs}), _bitter_, see §23 note; {lützel} (OS. {luttil}), _little_; {acker} (Goth. {akrs}), _field_; {wacker} (OE. {wæccer}), _watchful_. See §23, 2.  3. All single consonants, except {r}, were doubled after a short vowel when there was originally a {j} in the next syllable. The {bb}, {dd}, {gg}; {pp}, {tt}, {kk}, which thus arose, became {pp} ({bb}), {tt}, {ck} ({gg}); {pf}, {tz}, {ck} in MHG. (§§23,2, 26), as {sippe} ({sibbe}), Goth. {sibja}, _relationship_; {bitten}, later {biten}, Goth. {bidjan}, _to request_; {tretten} (_wv._): {trëten} _(sv.), to tread_; {brücke} ({brügge}), _bridge_; {ecke} ({egge}), _edge_; {mücke} ({mügge}), _midge_; {rücke} ({rügge}), _ridge, back_. {schepfen}, Goth. {skapjan}, _to create_; {hitze}, _heat_: {heiȥ}, _hot_; {netzen}, _to wet_: {naȥ}, _wet_; {setzen}, Goth. {satjan}, _to set_; {sitzen}, _to sit_: pret. {saȥ}, p.p. {gesëȥȥen}; {decken}, _to cover_: {dach}, _cover_; {lücke}, _gap_: {loch}, _hole_. {zellen}, later {zeln}, _to count_: {zal}, _number_. {vremmen}, later {vremen} (OE. {fremman}), _to perform_. {henne}, _hen_: {hane}, _cock_.  In MHG. the double consonants in verbs were often simplified through the levelling out of forms which regularly had a single consonant, e.g. regular forms were: {vremmen}, _to perform_, sing. {vremme}, {vremes(t), vremet}, pl. {vremmen}, {vremmet}, {vremment}, pret. {vremete}, p.p. {gevremet}, then the stem-form with single {m} was levelled out into all the forms, and similarly with many other verbs, as {denen}, _to stretch_; {seln}, _to hand over_; {weln}, _to choose_; {wenen}, _to accustom_; {legen} beside {lecken} ({leggen}), _to lay_; and the strong verbs {biten}, _to beg_; {ligen} beside {licken (liggen)}, _to lie down_.   §32.  Double consonants were simplified:--  1. When they became final, as {boc}, _buck_, {kus}, _kiss_, {man}, _man_, {schif}, _ship_, {stum}, _dumb_, {vël}, _hide_, beside gen. {bockes}, {kusses}, {mannes}, {schiffes}, {stummes}, {vëlles}; pret. {maȥ}, {ran}, {traf}, beside {mëȥȥen}, _to measure_, {rinnen}, _to run_, {trëffen}, _to hit_.  2. Before other consonants, as pret. {dacte (dahte), nante (nande), kuste}, beside {decken}, _to cover_, {nennen}, _to name_, {küssen}, _to kiss_.  3. After consonants, as pret. {sante} ({sande}) from {*santte}, {wante} ({wande}) from {*wantte}, beside {senden}, _to send_, {wenden}, _to turn_.  4. After long vowels and diphthongs, as pret. sing. {leite} from {*leitte}, pret. pl. {māȥen}, {trāfen}, {vielen}, beside {leiten}, _to lead_, {mëȥȥen}, _to measure_, {trëffen}, _to hit_, {vallen}, _to fall_. This simplification of double consonants took place during the OHG. period, as {slāfan}, _to sleep_, {heiȥan}, _to call_, {loufan}, _to run_, {zeichan}, _token_, beside older OHG. {slāffan}, {heiȥȥan}, {louffan}, {zeihhan}.   §33.  In MHG. the lenes {b, d, g} became the fortes {p, t, c (k)} when they ended a syllable, that is when they came to stand finally, or medially before a voiceless consonant. Traces of this law existed already in OHG. The interchange between the lenes and fortes includes two independent processes, viz. the change of the medial lenes {b, d, g} to the final fortes {p, t, k}, and the change of the final {f, s} to the medial intervocalic lenes {v} and to what is written {s} (cp. also NHG. {lesen}, {las}). It must be noted that in MHG. the interchanging pairs of consonants were all voiceless and that the difference merely consisted in the intensity or force with which the sounds were produced. This is quite different from NHG. where the interchange is between voiced and voiceless sounds except in the case of {f} which is voiceless in all positions in native words. Examples are: {gëben}, _to give_, {gelouben}, _to believe_, {wërben}, _to turn_, beside pret. {gap}, {geloupte}, {warp}; gen. {lībes}, {lambes}, beside nom. {līp}, _life_, {lamp}, _lamb_. {binden}, _to bind_, {wërden}, _to become_, beside pret. {bant}, {wart}; gen. {kindes}, {tōdes}, beside nom. {kint}, _child_, {tōt}, _death_. {biegen}, _to bend_, {singen}, _to sing_, {zeigen}, _to show_, beside pret. {bouc}, {sanc}, {zeicte}; gen. {tages}, "]]]
