I need you, all the time, to be the mainspring of this business.\"  \"Tell me what I can do and I'm only too glad to get at it.\"  \"Well, for one thing you must mix with the boys. Be jolly with 'em. 'Laugh and the world laughs with you.' That's my motto. That's the way I get along. Someone must be around with these boys to keep 'em going, or their hunt won't last long. Get them interested in finding the location of the springs. To-day they are all looking for big stones because of what Joe said. There's enough big stones around here to keep them busy. Tell them the fellow who finds the treasure may get some gold but the boy who finds a spring gets twenty dollars sure. Get them to survey the Hollow and search for marks to show where the old stream used to run in. You ought to be up on your toes every minute. I'm sorry you aren't a scout.\"  \"Perhaps I could be,\" suggested Glen.  \"Why not? Get Apple to teach you the knots and the scout law, and I'll teach you the rest. I'll speak to the scout master and see if they won't initiate you to-night.\"  The remainder of the day Glen was too busy to mope. When the camp fire came he was at hand as a candidate for tenderfoot initiation which the scout master had agreed to give. Mr. Newton had ideas of his own about initiation ceremonies. He believed in making them interesting and impressive to candidate and scouts alike, and he devised a new ceremony of initiation for special occasions.  This occasion was unusual, for since none but scouts came to camp, initiations were not needed. It was also unusual in being conducted in the open, which was necessary because the camp had no assembly tent. Mr. Newton was glad of the diversion, for the day had been very sultry, a storm threatened, and many of the scouts were afflicted with that uneasy, depressed feeling which seems to be absorbed from the atmosphere at such times.  \"All scouts on tent duty,\" he announced after supper. \"Rain threatens. See that trenches are clear. Slacken tent ropes a little, especially where they are new. See that nothing in the tents touches the walls. Have your beds all ready to turn in. You will then all assemble at the camp-fire for initiation ceremonies.\"  The camp had lanterns and one or two oil torches but Mr. Newton preferred to go back to nature for his light at this ceremony. The night was cool as the storm drew near, and the camp-fire was allowed to flare up in a crackling blaze which spread its light over the wide open circle and threw mysterious shadows among the big trees beyond.  Mr. Newton took his stand with his back to a massive elm at the edge of the circle.  \"The candidate may present himself,\" he announced; and Glen marched out and stood before him, with much more of a feeling of solemnity than he had felt on occasions when he had stood before persons of far greater authority.  \"Who desires to bear the lights which shall lighten the way of this candidate as he enters the mysteries of scoutcraft?\" called the scout master.  \"We desire to bear the lights,\" came simultaneously from two of the tallest scouts. They stepped to the fire, selected each a blazing torch and ranged themselves under the tree.  \"Who is sponsor for this candidate?\" was the next question.  \"I, First class scout Corliss Newton, am his sponsor,\" proclaimed Apple, stepping forward, his pleasant eyes alight with earnest gravity.  \"It is well. The sponsor may take his stand to the candidate's left. Who desires to bear the scout law to this applicant.\"  Twelve scouts arose as one--the older scouts they were--those not likely to be confused by bashfulness or to spoil the ceremony by their own self-consciousness.  \"Let the bearer administer article I. A scout is trustworthy!\"  Forth strode a scout bigger than Glen. Laying his hand on Glen's lips, he said: \"No lies proceed from trustworthy lips, no deceit from trustworthy tongue, he lives by the breath of honor and his lips are sealed to all but words of truth.\"  \"The bearer of article 2. A scout is loyal!\"  This scout bore aloft the flag of the camp, which had been requisitioned for the purpose. He placed the staff in Glen's hands as he said: \"Loyal to the flag and to all it represents. Loyal to all scouts and all officials. Loyal to home, to parents and authorities, and loyal to Almighty God.\"  The wind was swirling through the branches of the trees now and the few stars which had shone were blotted out by the clouds, but the initiation proceeded.  \"The bearer of article 3. A scout is helpful!\"  This bearer, coming forward, took Glen's hands and raised them up as he recited: \"These hands and the body they represent are pledged to lift up righteousness and tear down iniquity. They will do at least one good turn to somebody every day.\"  \"The bearer of article 4. A scout is friendly!\"  Glen was glad to see Chick-chick coming forward with a cheerful grin on his face. He stood between Glen and Apple and around the shoulders of each he placed an arm, while he and Apple shouted aloud: \"All friends! All brothers!\" And immediately every scout rose to his feet and together they echoed: \"Brothers all!\"  But the first rain drops were spatting among the leaves and Scout Master Newton raised his hand.  \"We must abbreviate our ceremony,\" he announced. \"The remaining bearers will repeat their sections of the scout law after me as I read. The twelve will then form an inner circle around us, and all other scouts will make strong our defenses with an outer circle as we give this candidate the scout oath.\"  In their order the remaining eight advanced with their salutations:  A scout is courteous.  A scout is kind.  A scout is obedient.  A scout is cheerful.  A scout is thrifty.  A scout is brave.  A scout is clean.  A scout is reverent.  They formed the inner circle and around them all the scouts arose and joined hands to form the outer guard. The lightning became more vivid in its flashes and the mutterings of thunder changed to rumbling and roaring as they stood there. The big drops of rain began to thicken but they paid no heed.  \"The candidate will hold up his right hand, palm to the front, thumb resting on the nail of the little finger, and the other three fingers upright and together, which constitutes the scout sign.\"  Glen stood at attention with his hand raised as directed.  \"The candidate will now repeat after me the scout oath.\"  \"'On my honor I will do my best:  \"'To do my duty to God and my country and to obey the scout law;  \"'To help other people at all times;  \"'To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.'  \"Scout you are now admitted into our ranks as a tenderfoot, which is our first step and one from which you may go on to acquire merit and honor. We are brothers all. The skies may be heavy above us, the storms may threaten, the thunder roar and the lightning flash but we extend to you the cheer of scout fellowship and the welcome of scout comradeship. And as you meet the inevitable storms of life we believe that your remembrance of this law and oath will help you to weather them all triumphantly.\"  The rain was beginning to fall in earnest now.  \"Dismiss troop!\" called the scout master; and the boys, a second before in impressive order, made a wild scramble for their tents. Glen ran to the assistance of Will Spencer, who had been an interested spectator of the ceremony, seated in his \"billy-cart\" at the edge of the circle, but Mr. Newton waved him to his tent.  \"I will look after this man,\" he declared. \"He is my guest and I am rain proof.\"  Glen turned into his blankets that night a Boy Scout of America. He awoke to a sunny morning and discovered that he was still Glen Mason. Almost the first thing, he was in trouble with his patrol leader, Matt Burton. It is only fair to Glen to say that Burton's treatment was of a character sure to antagonize a boy of Glen's nature. From the first there had been a feeling of ill-will between them, a feeling that had been manifest in looks and silent expressions as well as in one sharp interchange of words. Now, to Glen's disgust, he found himself assigned to Burton's patrol, and the very first work for which he was detailed was that of camp cleaning.  Glen went at his detail with poor spirit; picking up old papers, fragments, trash of every kind, a hateful work to him. Perhaps he would have made open rebellion but for Apple Newton, who though not in the same patrol was helping in the work.  \"Get busy at it, Glen,\" Apple counseled. \"It isn't a ten minute job if you hustle. Beats washing dishes all to pieces. Every scout has to take his turn. Get busy.\"  But, filled with the thought that Burton had put him to this work to humiliate him, Glen did not carry through his task to great advantage. He was glad that the morning swim came immediately after, and glad to be able to make a cleaner dive and a longer swim than Burton, who was himself among the best. Therein lay the trouble, Glen was a born leader, and although his opportunities for leading had been few he was quick to assert himself. Burton was also a leader and one who had been given ample opportunity. Neither boy had yet learned that the first element in leadership is the ability to serve; neither had learned that the greatest leader is the one who counts no service too mean for his personal attention.  When the treasure hunt began there were no further restrictions for the morning, and Glen's spirit was rejoiced at Apple's invitation that he bear him company. The sunny-faced, open-hearted boy won the love of everyone, but in Glen Mason he had stirred a real worship.  \"We'll have to call you something, Glen,\" he said. \"Your name's all right, but the boys are sure to name you over so we may as well do it now. Let's ask Chick-chick. He's good at names.\"  \"What's his real name?\" asked Glen.  \"His real name is Henry Henry. His father liked Henry so well for a surname that he had him christened Henry, too. We began by calling him Hen Hen,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22656"],["title","Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North (#0)"],["body","http://www.eBookForge.net           RED CAP TALES   [Illustration: Red Cap among the Wizard's Treasures.]   RED CAP TALES  STOLEN FROM THE TREASURE CHEST OF THE WIZARD OF THE NORTH  WHICH THEFT IS HUMBLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY  S.

FOUR CHILDREN WOULD NOT READ SCOTT   SO I told them these stories--and others--to lure them to the printed book, much as carrots are dangled before the nose of the reluctant donkey. They are four average intelligent children enough, but they hold severely modern views upon storybooks. _Waverley_, in especial, they could not away with. They found themselves stuck upon the very threshold.  Now, since the first telling of these Red Cap Tales, the Scott shelf in the library has been taken by storm and escalade. It is permanently gap-toothed all along the line. Also there are nightly skirmishes, even to the laying on of hands, as to who shall sleep with _Waverley_ under his pillow.  It struck me that there must be many oldsters in the world who, for the sake of their own youth, would like the various Sweethearts who now inhabit their nurseries, to read Sir Walter with the same breathless eagerness as they used to do--how many years agone? It is chiefly for their sakes that I have added several interludes, telling how Sweetheart, Hugh John, Sir Toady Lion, and Maid Margaret received my petty larcenies from the full chest of the Wizard.  At any rate, Red Cap succeeded in one case--why should he not in another? I claim no merit in the telling of the tales, save that, like medicines well sugar-coated, the patients mistook them for candies and--asked for more.  The books are open. Any one can tell Scott's stories over again in his own way. This is mine.                                                         S. R. CROCKETT.

She and I were at Dryburgh Abbey, sitting quietly on a rustic seat, and looking toward the aisle in which slept the Great Dead. The long expected had happened, and we had made pilgrimage to our Mecca. Yet, in spite of the still beauty of the June day, I could see that a shadow lay upon our Sweetheart's brow.  \"Oh, I know he was great,\" she burst out at last, \"and what you read me out of the _Life_ was nice. I like hearing about Sir Walter--but--\"  I knew what was coming.  \"But what?\" I said, looking severely at the ground, so that I might be able to harden my heart against the pathos of Sweetheart's expression.  \"But--I can't read the novels--indeed I can't. I have tried _Waverley_ at least twenty times. And as for _Rob Roy_--\"  Even the multiplication table failed here, and at this, variously a-sprawl on the turf beneath, the smaller fry giggled.  \"Course,\" said Hugh John, who was engaged in eating grass like an ox, \"we know it is true about _Rob Roy_. She read us one whole volume, and there wasn't no Rob Roy, nor any fighting in it. So we pelted her with fir-cones to make her stop and read over _Treasure Island_ to us instead!\"  \"Yes, though we had heard it twenty times already,\" commented Sir Toady Lion, trying his hardest to pinch his brother's legs on the sly.  \"Books wifout pictures is silly!\" said a certain Maid Margaret, a companion new to the honourable company, who was weaving daisy-chains, her legs crossed beneath her, Turk fashion. In literature she had got as far as words of one syllable, and had a poor opinion even of them.  \"_I_ had read all Scott's novels long before I was your age,\" I said reprovingly.  The children received this announcement with the cautious silence with which every rising generation listens to the experiences of its elders when retailed by way of odious comparison.  \"Um-m!\" said Sir Toady, the licensed in speech; \"_we_ know all that. Oh, yes; and you didn't like fruit, and you liked medicine in a big spoon, and eating porridge and--\"  \"Oh, we know--we know!\" cried all the others in chorus.
