BLUDOFFSKI.   The friends of Mr. Richard O'Royster always maintained that he was the best of good fellows. Many, indeed, went so far as to say he had no faults whatever; and while such an encomium seems, on the face of it, to be extravagant, its probability is much strengthened by the fact that whatever he had they always came into the possession of sooner or later. If he had any faults, therefore, they must have known it. They would never have allowed anything so valuable as a fault to escape them.  Mr. O'Royster was sitting, one afternoon, in the private office of his bankers, Coldpin & Breaker. Mr. Coldpin sat with him, discussing the advisability of his investing $250,000 in the bonds of the East and West Telegraph Company. It was a safe investment, in Mr. Coldpin's judgment, and Mr. O'Royster was about to order the transaction carried out, when the office door was thrust open and a long, black-bearded, wiry-haired, savage-looking man walked in.  [Illustration: BLUDOFFSKI.]  His head was an irregular hump set fixedly on his shoulders so that one almost expected to hear it creak when he moved it. His eyes were little, and curiously stuck on either side of his thick, stumpy nose, as if it were only by the merest accident that they hadn't taken a position back of his ears or up in his forehead or down in his hollow cheeks. His entrance put a sudden and disagreeable stop to the conversation. Mr. O'Royster adjusted his eyeglass and looked with a sort of serene curiosity at the man. Mr. Coldpin moved nervously in his chair.  \"Vell,\" the fellow said, after a pause, \"I haf come to sbeak mit you.\"  \"You come very often,\" replied Mr. Coldpin in a mildly remonstrative tone.  No answer was returned to this suggestion. The intruder simply settled himself on his feet in an obstinate sort of way.  Mr. Coldpin produced a dollar-bill and handed it over, remarking testily, \"There, now, I'm very busy!\"  \"Nein, nein!\" said the man. \"It vas not enough!\"  \"Not enough?\"  \"I vants dwenty tollar.\"  \"Oh, come now; this wont do at all. You mustn't bother me so. I can't be--\"  The man did something with his mouth. Possibly he smiled. Possibly he was malevolently disposed. At all events, whatever his motive or his humor, he did something with his mouth, and straightway his two rows of teeth gleamed forth, his eyes changed their position and also their hue, and the hollows in his cheeks became caverns.  \"Great CÃ¦sar!\" cried Mr. O'Royster. \"Look here, my good fellow, now don't! If you must have the money, we'll try to raise it. Don't do that. Take in your teeth, my man, take 'em in right away, and we'll see what we can do about the twenty.\"  He composed his mouth, reducing it to its normal dimensions and arranging it in its normal shape, whereupon Mr. O'Royster, drawing a roll of bills from his pocket, counted out twenty dollars.  Mr. Coldpin interposed. \"You may naturally think, O'Royster,\" he observed quietly, \"that this man has some hold upon me by which he is in a position to extort money. There is no such phase to this remarkable case. I owe him nothing. He is simply in the habit of coming here and demanding money, which I have let him have from time to time in small sums to--well, get rid of him. I think, though, that it's time to stop. You must not give him that $20. I won't permit it. Put it back in--\"  [Illustration: \"IT WOULDN'T HURT HIM TO SHOOT HIM.\"]  The man did something else in a facial way just as defiant of analysis as his previous contortion and equally effective on Mr. O'Royster's nerves. He moved toward Mr. O'Royster and held up his hand for the money. It was slowly yielded up, and without so much as an acknowledgment, the man thrust it into his pocket and stalked out.  Mr. O'Royster watched his misshapen body as it disappeared through the entry. Then he gazed at the banker and finally remarked: \"Can't say that your friend pleases me, Coldpin.\"  \"To tell the truth, O'Royster, I live in mortal terror of that creature. He followed me into this room from the street one day and demanded, rather than begged, some money. I scarcely noticed him, telling him I had nothing, when he did something that attracted my attention, and the next minute my flesh began to creep, my backbone began to shake, and I thought I should have spasms. I gave him a handful of change and off he went. Since then, as I told you, he has been coming here every month or so. I'm going to move next May into a building where I can have a more guarded office.\"  \"Odd tale!\" said Mr. O'Royster, \"deuced odd. Why don't you get a pistol?\"  \"Well, I have a sort of feeling that it wouldn't hurt him to shoot him. Of course it would, you know, but still--\"  \"Yes, I know what you mean. He certainly does look as if a pistol would be no adequate defense against him. What you want is a nice, self-cocking, automatic thunderbolt.\"  They changed the subject, returning to their interrupted business, and having concluded that they talked on until it had grown quite late.  \"By Jove!\" cried Mr. O'Royster, glancing at his watch, \"it's half-past six, and I've a dinner engagement at the club at seven. I must be off. Ring for a cab, wont you?\"  The cab arrived in a few moments and Mr. O'Royster hurried out. \"Drive me to the Union Club,\" he said, \"and whip up lively.\"  He sprang in, the cab started off with a whirl, and he turned in his seat to let down the window. A startled look came into his face.  \"It's too dark to see well,\" he said to himself, \"and this thing bounces like a tugboat in a gale, but if that ourang-outang wasn't standing under that gaslight yonder, I'll be hanged!\"  Mr. O'Royster's was the sort of mind that dwelt lightly and briefly on subjects affecting it disagreeably, and long before he reached the club it had left the ourang-outang far in the distance. In the presence of a jolly company, red-headed duck, burgundy and champagne, it had room for nothing but wit and frolic, to which its inclinations always strongly tended.  The night had far advanced when Mr. O'Royster left the club. He turned into Fifth Avenue, journeying toward Twenty-third Street, and had walked about half the distance when he felt a touch upon his arm. Mr. O'Royster was in that condition when his mental senses acted more quickly than his physical senses. Bringing his eyes to bear upon the spot where he felt the touch, he made out the shape of a big, dirty hand, and following it and the arm above it, he presently ascertained that a man was close at his elbow. He spent several minutes scrutinizing the man's face, and finally he said:  \"Ah, I shee. Beg pawdon, dear boy, f'not 'bsherving you b'fore. Mos' happy to renew zhe 'quaintance so auspishously begun 'saffer-noon. H--hic!--'ope you're feeling well. By zhe way, ol' f'llaw, wha' zhure name?\"  \"Bludoffski.\"  \"Razzer hard name t' pronounce, but easy one t' 'member. Glad 'tain't Dobbins. 'F zenny sing I hate, 's name like Dobb'ns, 'r Wobb'ns, 'r Wigg'ns. Some-pin highly unconventional in name of Bludoffski. Mr. Bludoffski, kindly 'cept 'shurances of my--rhic!--gard!\"  Mr. Bludoffski executed a facial maneuver intended possibly for a smile. It excited Mr. O'Royster's attention directly.  \"Doffski!\" he said, stopping shortly and balancing himself on his legs, \"are you sure you're feelin' quite well?\"  \"Yah, puty vell.\"  \"Zere's no great sorrer gnawin' chure vitals, is zere, Moffski?\"  \"I vas all ride.\"  \"Not sufferin' f'om any mad r'gret, 'r misplaced love, 'rensing zat kind, eh, Woffski?\"  \"No.\"  \"Feeling jush sames' ushyal?\"  \"Yah.\"  \"Zen 'sall right.

Look 't me carefully and shay, on y'r honor, Loffski, where d'you shin' I'm mos' largely 'tossicated?\"  \"In der legs,\" replied Mr. Bludoffski, promptly.  \"Shank you. 'S very kind. 'T may not be alt'gesser dignified to be 'tossicated in zhe legs, but 's far besser'n if 'twas in zhe eyes. 'Spise a man 'at looks drunk in's eyes. Pos'ively 'sgusting!\"  They had now reached Twenty-third Street, and following his companion's lead, O'Royster crossed unsteadily into Madison Square and through one of the park walks. Presently he halted.  \"By zhe way, Woffski,\" he said, \"do you know where we're goin'?\"  \"Yah.\"  \"Well, zat's what I call lucky. I'm free t' confesh I haven't gotter shingle idea. But 'f you know, 's all right. W'en a man feels himself slightly 'tossicated, 's nozzin' like bein' in comp'ny of f'law 'at knows where 's goin'. 'Parts a highly 'gree'ble feelin' 'f conf'dence. Don't wanter 'splay any 'pert'nent cur'osity, Boffski, but p'raps 's no harm in askin' where 'tis 'at you know you're goin'?\"  \"Home.\"  An expression of disgust crossed Mr. O'Royster's face. \"Home?\" he inquired. \"D' you shay 'home,' Toffski? Haven't you got any uzzer place t' go? Wen a man'sh r'duced t' th' 'str--hic--remity 'f goin' home, must be in dev'lish hard luck.\"  \"Der vhy 've go home,\" said Bludoffski, \"is dot I somedings haf I show you.\"  \"Ah. I shee.

If 'tain't picshur er piece pottery, wha' deuce is't?\"  \"You shall see.\"  \"Myst'ry! Well, I'm great boy f'r myst'ries. Hullo! Zis, zh' place?\"  They had walked through Twenty-ninth Street, into Second Avenue, and had reached the center of a gloomy and dismal block. Directly in front of the gloomiest and most dismal house of all Bludoffski had suddenly stopped, and in answer to Mr. O'Royster's exclamation, he drew from his pocket a latch-key and opened the side door.  The entry was dark, but the glimmer of a light was visible at the end of the hall. He did not speak, but motioned with his hand an invitation for Mr. O'Royster to go in. It was accepted, not, however, without a slight manifestation of reluctance. Mr. O'Royster's senses were somewhat clouded, but the shadows of the entry were dark enough to impress even him with a vague feeling of dread.  Bludoffski shut the door behind them carefully and drew a bolt or two. Then he led the way down the hall toward the light. As they advanced voices were heard, one louder than the rest, which broke out in rude interruption, dying down into a sort of murmuring accompaniment.  When they reached the end of the hall Bludoffski opened another door and they entered a large beer saloon. At a score of tables men were sitting, many apparently of German birth. They were smoking pipes, drinking beer, and listening to the hoarse voice of an orator standing in the furthest corner of the room.  He was a little round man with little round eyes, a little round nose, a little round stomach, and little round legs. Though very small in person, his voice was formidable enough, and he appeared to be astonishingly in earnest.  Bludoffski's entrance created a considerable stir. Several persons began to applaud, and some said, \"Bravo! bravo!\" One sharp-visaged and angular man with black finger-nails, spectacles, and a high tenor voice, cried out with a burst of enthusiasm, \"Hail! Dear apostle uf luf!\" a sentiment that brought out a general and spontaneous cheer. Mr. O'Royster, apparently under the impression that he was the object of these flattering attentions, bowed and smiled with the greatest cheerfulness and murmured something about this being the proudest moment of his life. He was on the point of addressing some remarks to the bartender, when the little round orator cut in with an energy quite amazing.  [Illustration: \"VE VILL SHTRIKE, MEIN PRUDERS!\"]  \"Der zoshul refolushun haf gome, my prudders!\" he said. \"Der bowder vas all retty der match to be struck mit. Ve neet noddings but ter stretch out mit der hant und der victory dake. Der gabitalist fool himselluf. He say mit himselluf 'I haf der golt und der bower, hey?' He von pig fool. He dinks you der fool vas, und der eye uf him he vinks like der glown py der circus. But yust vait. Vait till der honest sons uf doil rise by deir might oop und smite der blow vich gif liperty to der millions!\"  At this there was a wild outburst of applause and a chorus of hoarse shouts: \"Up mit der red flag!\" \"Strike now!\" \"Anarchy foreffer!\"  \"Ve vill shtrike, mine prudders,\" continued the little round orator, growing very ardent and red in the face. \"Ve vill no vait long. Ve vill kill! Ve vill burn! Ve vill der togs uf var loose und ride to driumph in der shariot uf fire. Ve vill deir housen pull down deir hets upoud, und der street will run mit der foul plood uf der gabitalist!\"  A mighty uproar arose at these gory suggestions, and would not be subdued until all the glasses had been refilled and the enthusiasm that had been aroused was quenched in beer.  Mr. O'Royster had listened to these proceedings with some misgivings. He turned to his companion, who stood solemn and silent by his side, and observed:  \"D' I unnerstan' you t' say, Woffski, 't you 's goin' home?\"  \"Yah.\"  \"Doncher zhink 's mos' time t' go?\"  \"Ve vas dere now.\"  \"Home?\"  \"Yah.\"  \"Can't say I'm pleased with your d'mestic surroundings, Boffski. Razzer too mush noise f' man of my temp'ment. Guesh I'll haffer bid you g'night, Boffski.\"  \"Nein.\"  \"Yesh, Boffski, mush go. Gotter 'gagement.\"  \"Vait. I haf not show you yet--\"  \"T' tell truf, Moffski, I've seen 'nuff. 'F I wasser shee more, might not sleep well. Might have nightmare. Don't shink 's good f' me t' shee too much, ol' f'law.\"  \"Listen.\"  The little round orator, refreshed and reinvigorated, began again.  \"You must arm yoursellef, my prudders. You must haf guns und powder und ball und--\"  \"Dynamite!\" yelled several.  \"Yah. Dot vas der drue veapon uf der zoshul refolushun. Dynamite! You must plenty haf.

Den vill Anarchy reign subreme ofer de gabitalist vampire! Are you retty?\"  The whole crowd rose in a body, banged their glasses viciously on the tables in front of them and shouted: \"Ve vas!\"  \"Den lose no time to rouse your frients. Vake up der laporing mans all eferywhere. Gif dem blenty pomb und der sicnal vatch for, und ven it vas gif shoot und kill und spare nopoddy! Der time for vorts vas gone.

Always know 's time er go when I have zat feelin'. F' I'd know chure home 's in place like zis I'd asked you t' go t' mine where zere's more r--hic--pose.\"  There was a door behind them near the bar, and Bludoffski, opening it, motioned Mr. O'Royster to go in ahead. He obeyed, not without reluctance, and the Anarchist followed. Two tables covered with papers, a bed and several chairs were in the room, together with many little jars, bits of gaspipe, lumps of sulphur, phosphorus and lead.  \"Sit down,\" said Bludoffski.  Mr. O'Royster sat.  \"I am an Anarchist,\" Bludoffski began.  \"'S very nice,\" Mr. O'Royster replied. \"I 's zhinkin' uzzer day 'bout bein' Anarchis' m'self, but Mrs. O'Royster said she's 'fraid m' health washn't good 'nuff f' such--hic--heavy work.\"  \"You hear der vorts uf dot shbeaker und you see der faces uf der men.

W'en a man's eyes 'fected by champagne, he's liter'ly no good. Talk to me 'bout zis t'mor', Woffski. Subjec's too 'mportant to be d'scussed unner present conditions.\"  \"Nein! nein!

Nopody can dot pook reat mitout he say ven he lay him down, 'I vil be an Anarchist.'\"  Mr. Bludoffski had become intensely interested in his own remarks. He picked his manuscripts from the table and caressed them lovingly.  \"See,\" he said, \"dere vas der pook vich make mankind brudders. I tell you how you help. I vas poor. I haf no money.

The reply was somewhat slow in coming. Mr. O'Royster, when his companion began to talk, had leaned his head on his arm and closed his eyes. He had"]]]
