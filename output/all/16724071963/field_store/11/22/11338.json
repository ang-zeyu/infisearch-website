When \"The Young Adventurer\" was published, a year since, as the initial volume of The Pacific Series, it was announced that the second volume would be \"The Young Pioneer.\" This has been changed to \"The Young Miner,\" in order to avoid confusion with a book bearing a title somewhat similar to the one first proposed.  Those who were interested in Tom Nelson's trip across the Plains will find in the present story a record of his adventures in the Land of Gold. Though his prosperity was chiefly due to his own energy and industry, it is also true that he was exceptionally lucky. Yet his good fortune has been far exceeded by that of numerous adventurous spirits in Colorado, within the last twelve months. Some measure of prosperity generally awaits the patient and energetic worker, and seldom comes to those who idly wait for something to turn up.  NEW YORK, Oct. 1, 1879.     THE YOUNG MINER;  OR,  TOM NELSON IN CALIFORNIA.     CHAPTER I.  THE GOLD-SEEKERS.   A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California. It was in the early days, and this party was but one of hundreds who were scattered over the new Eldorado, seeking for the shining metal which throughout the civilized world exercises a sway potent and irresistible.  I have said there were a dozen men, but this is a mistake. One of the party was a well-grown boy of sixteen, with a good-humored and even handsome face. He was something more than good-humored, however. There was an expression on his face which spoke of strength and resolution and patient endurance. The readers of \"The Young Adventurer\" will at once recognize in our young hero Tom Nelson, the oldest son of a poor New England farmer, who, finding no prospects at home, had joined the tide of emigrants pouring from all parts of the country to the land of which so many marvelous stories were told. Tom had come to work; and though he doubtless shared to some extent the extravagant anticipations of the great body of Eastern visitors who hoped to make a fortune in a year, he did not expect to succeed without hard toil.  His companions belonged to the same party with whom he had crossed the plains, under the leadership of Phineas Fletcher, a broad-shouldered Illinois farmer, who had his family with him. Next to Tom was Donald Ferguson, a grave Scotchman, and Tom's special friend; a man of excellent principles, thoroughly reliable, and held in high respect by all though not possessed of popular manners. On the other side was Lawrence Peabody, a young Boston clerk, who had spent several years behind a dry-goods counter. He was soft and effeminate, with no talent for \"roughing it,\" and wholly unfitted for the hard work which he had undertaken. He was deeply disappointed in his first work at gold-hunting, having come out with the vague idea that he should pick up a big nugget within a short time that would make his fortune and enable him to go home a rich man. The practical side of gold-seeking--this washing particles of dust from the dirt of the river-bed--was in the highest degree unsatisfactory and discouraging. He was not a bad fellow; and his companions, though they laughed at him, were well disposed towards him.  Among the rest, mention may be made of John Miles, Henry Scott, and Chapman, owner of a refractory donkey named after King Solomon.  Not far away from the river were the tents occupied by the miners. There was but one house, roughly built of logs. This was occupied by Captain Fletcher and his family. He had not had the trouble of building it, but had found it ready for occupation, having been constructed by a previous party who had wandered farther down the river in search of richer washings. In fact, it was this building which had decided our party to remain.  \"There isn't much difference in places,\" said Fletcher. \"We may as well stay here.\"  \"Then why was it deserted?\" suggested John Miles, dubiously. \"That's rather against it, isn't it, captain?\"  \"Not necessarily, Miles. You've been on berrying parties, haven't you, when at home?\"  \"Many a time.\"  \"You've noticed that many of the pickers leave good places, just from love of novelty, and wander about the field, often faring worse than if they remained where they were?\"  \"That's so, captain.\"  \"Then let us give this place a try. We'll make more working steady in a medium place than wandering here, there, and everywhere.\"  So the whole party agreed to \"give the place a try.\"  There had been no brilliant success as yet, but fair luck. In six days Tom had washed out twenty-five dollars' worth of gold-dust, in spite of awkwardness and inexperience. Others had done better, but poor Lawrence Peabody had barely five dollars' worth to show. It must be said, however, that he had not averaged more than two or three hours of real labor in every twenty-four. He spent the rest of the time in wandering about aimlessly, or sitting down and watching the labors of his companions, while he enlivened them by pathetic lamentations over his unfortunate position, so far away from Boston and the refining influences of civilization.  A little transcript of a conversation between Tom and himself will throw light upon the characters of both.  \"This is beastly work,\" sighed Peabody, resting from his by no means arduous labors, and looking over to Tom. \"I tell you, it isn't fit for a gentleman.\"  \"It is rather hard to keep one's hands clean, Mr. Peabody,\" said Tom; \"but you mustn't think of the present. Think of the time when you will go home, your pockets full of gold.\"  \"I don't see any prospect of it, Tom,\" sighed Peabody. \"Here I've been hard at work for a week, and I haven't got over five dollars' worth of dust.\"  \"I have five times as much,\" said Tom.  \"Some people are lucky,\" said Peabody.  \"You haven't worked like Tom,\" said the Scotchman, plainly. \"You haven't averaged over two hours a day, while Tom has worked eight or ten.\"  \"I have worked till my back was like to break,\" said the young man from Boston. \"I am not accustomed to manual labor, Mr. Ferguson. My friend Tom has worked on a farm, while I have been engaged in mercantile pursuits. Oh, why did I leave Boston!\"  \"I am sure I can't guess,\" said Ferguson, dryly.  \"I never expected anything like _this_.\"  \"What did you expect, if I may be so bold as to inquire?\"  \"I thought I should find the gold in big nuggets worth thousands of dollars apiece. I was always reading in the papers about finding them. I think it's a great shame to deceive people by such stories. I don't believe there are any nuggets.\"  \"Oh, yes, there are; but they are few and far between,\" said Fletcher. \"A neighbor of mine found one worth three thousand dollars. Altogether he brought home five thousand dollars, and invested it in a farm and saw-mill. He is doing a good business. When he came to California he had nothing.\"  \"That is what I should like, Captain Fletcher,\" said Tom. \"If I could only manage to carry home five thousand dollars, I could make my father comfortable for life.\"  \"I shouldn't be satisfied with five thousand dollars,\" said Peabody, whose ideas were lofty.  \"How much would satisfy you?\"  \"About fifty thousand,\" said the young Bostonian, his face lighting up at the thought of so large a sum.  \"And what would you do with it, if I may make so bold?\" asked Ferguson.  \"I would buy a nice house at the South End, furnish it handsomely, and live in style.\"  \"I suppose you would marry?\" suggested Tom, smiling.  \"I probably should,\" answered Peabody, gravely.  \"Perhaps you have the lady already selected.\"  \"I have.\"  \"Who is she?\" asked John Mills. \"Come, now, Peabody, don't be bashful.\"  \"It is the daughter of a Boston merchant.\"  \"Does the lady love you?\"  \"We understand each other,\" answered Peabody, loftily. \"She would marry me, poor as I am,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22669"],["title","The Young Miner; Or, Tom Nelson in California (#1)"],["body","for her purse-proud, mercenary sire. It will be a happy day when, with my pockets full of gold, I enter his presence and claim his daughter's hand.\"  \"I wish you success, Mr. Peabody,\" said Tom. \"I hope you have no rivals.\"  \"Yes, there is one.\"  \"Are you not afraid of him?\"  \"Oh, no; he is a fellow of no style,\" said Peabody, drawing up his slender form, and looking as stylish as a very dirty shirt, muddy boots, and a soiled suit would allow.  \"I think I shall wait awhile before getting married,\" said Tom. \"I am afraid I wouldn't stand any chance with an heiress, Mr. Peabody. Do you think I can ever be stylish?\"  The Bostonian understood Tom to be in earnest, and told him he thought in time, under proper training, he might become fairly stylish.  The conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell from the log-house. Mrs. Fletcher, by an arrangement with the party, prepared their meals, and thus they fared better than most of the early pioneers. Their labor gave them a good appetite, and they were more solicitous about quantity than quality. Slow as he was at his work, there was no one who exhibited greater alacrity at meal-times, than Lawrence Peabody. At such times he was even cheerful.     CHAPTER II.  MISSOURI JACK.   At the end of a month the settlement had considerably increased. A large party from Missouri went to work farther up stream, and a few stray emigrants also added themselves to the miners at River Bend, for this was the name selected by Captain Fletcher for the location. The new arrivals were a rougher and more disorderly class than Fletcher and his companions. Already there was a saloon, devoted to the double purpose of gambling and drinking; and the proprietor, Missouri Jack (no one knew his last name), was doing a thriving business. Indeed his income considerably exceeded that of any one in the settlement.  Neither Tom nor any of his party contributed much to Missouri Jack's profits. In consequence, they had to bear the ill-will and sometimes open abuse of Jack and his friends.  \"Come in and take a drink, stranger,\" called out Jack, the day after the opening of the saloon, to Captain Fletcher.  \"No, thank you.\"  \"It shan't cost you a cent.\"  \"It would cost me my health,\" returned Fletcher.  \"Do you mean to say I sell bad whiskey?\" demanded Jack, angrily, emphasizing the inquiry by an oath.  \"I don't know anything about it.\"  \"Then what _do_ you mean?\"  \"I mean that all whiskey is bad for the health,\" replied Fletcher.  \"Oh, you're a temperance sneak!\" exclaimed Missouri Jack, contemptuously.  \"I am a temperance man; you may leave out the other word,\" calmly answered Fletcher.  \"You're not a man!\" exploded Jack. \"A man that's afraid of whiskey is a--a--isn't half a man. He isn't fit to be a woman.\"  \"Have it as you like,\" said Fletcher, unruffled. \"I shall not drink to please any man. I had a younger brother--a bright, promising young man poor Ben was--who drank himself to death. He'd have been alive now but for whiskey.\"  \"Oh, dry up your pious talk! You make me sick!\" exclaimed Missouri Jack in deep disgust.  Next he accosted John Miles, who curtly declined and received in return a volley of abuse. Now Miles was a powerful man, and not possessed of Fletcher's self-control. He paused, and surveyed Jack with a menacing look.  \"Look here, stranger,\" he said, sharply, \"just have a care how you use that tongue of yours. This is a free country, and if I choose to decline your whiskey, there's no law against it that I know of.\"  \"You're a white-livered sneak!\"  Missouri Jack did not proceed with his remarks, for John Miles, seizing him by the shoulder, tripped him up, and strode away, leaving him prostrate, and pouring out a volley of curses. Being a bully, and cowardly as most bullies are, he did not pursue his broad-shouldered enemy, but vowed vengeance whenever a good opportunity came.  In fact, the only one of the original miners who accepted Jack's invitation was Lawrence Peabody.  \"Step in, stranger, and have a drink!\" said Jack, a little dubiously, having met with such poor luck heretofore.  The young Bostonian paused. He was not a drinker at home, but in his discontent and disappointment he was tempted.  \"My dear sir, you are very polite,\" he said.  \"I hope you ain't one of them temperance sneaks,\" said Jack, his brow clouding in anticipation of a refusal.  \"I assure you I am not,\" Peabody hastened to say. \"I have participated in convivial scenes more than once in Boston.\"  \"I don't understand college talk,\" said Jack; \"but if you want a glass of prime whiskey, just say the word.\"  \"I don't care if I do,\" said Peabody, following his new friend into the saloon.  The draught of prime whiskey scorched his throat as he swallowed it down, but it was followed by a sense of exhilaration, and Peabody's tongue was loosened.  \"You're a gentleman!\" said Missouri Jack. \"You ain't like them fellows you're with. They're sneaks.\"  \"Really, you compliment me, Mr.--, what may I call your name?\"  \"Missouri Jack--that's the peg I hang on to.\"  \"My dear Mr. Jack, I am glad to know you. You are really quite an accession to our settlement.\"  \"Well, if I ain't, my saloon is. How you've managed to live so long without liquor beats me. Why, it ain't civilized.\"  \"It _was_ pretty dull,\" admitted Peabody.  \"No life, no amusement; for all the world like a parcel of Methodists. What luck have you met with, stranger?\"  \"Beastly luck!\" answered Peabody. \"I tell you, Mr. Jack, California's a fraud. Many a time I've regretted leaving Boston, where I lived in style, and moved in the first circles, for such a place as this. Positively, Mr. Jack, I feel like a tramp, and I'm afraid I look like one. If my fashionable friends could see me now, they wouldn't know me.\"  \"I ain't got no fashionable friends, and I don't want any,\" growled Missouri Jack, spitting on the floor. \"What I want is, to meet gentlemen that ain't afraid to drink like gentlemen. I say, stranger, you'd better leave them Methodist fellers, and join our gang.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Jack, you're very kind, and I'll think of it,\" said Peabody, diplomatically. Though a little exhilarated, he was not quite blind to the character of the man with whom he was fraternizing, and had too much real refinement to enjoy his coarseness.  \"Have another drink!\"  \"Thank you.\"  Peabody drank again, this time with a friend of Jack's, a man of his own stripe, who straggled into the saloon.  \"Do you play euchre?\" asked Jack, producing a dirty pack of cards.  \"I know little of it,\" said Peabody; \"but I'll try a game.\"  \"Then you and me and Bill here will have a game.\"  \"All right,\" said Peabody, glad to while away the time.  \"What'll you put up on your game, stranger?\" asked Bill.  \"You don't mean to play for money, do you?\" asked Peabody, a little startled.  \"Sartain I do. What's the good of playin' for nothing?\"  So the young Bostonian, out of his modest pile was tempted to stake an ounce of gold-dust. Though his head was hardly in a condition to follow the game intelligently, he won, or at least Bill and Jack told him he had, and for the first time Lawrence felt the rapture of the successful gambler, as he gathered in his winnings.  \"He plays a steep game, Bill,\" said Jack.  \"Tip-top--A No. 1.\"  \"I believe I do play a pretty good game,\" said the flattered Peabody. \"My friends in Boston used to say so.\"  \"You're hard to beat, and no mistake,\" said Bill. \"Try another game.\"  \"I'm ready, gentlemen,\" said Peabody, with alacrity.  \"It's a great deal easier earning money this way,\" he reflected, regarding complacently the two ounces of dust which represented his winnings, \"than washing dirt out of the river.\" And the poor dupe congratulated himself that a new way of securing the favors of fortune had been opened to him.  The reader will easily guess that Lawrence Peabody did not win the next game, nor will he be surprised to hear that when he left the saloon his pockets were empty.  \"Better luck next time, stranger,\" said Jack, carelessly. \"Take a drink before you go?\"  Peabody accepted the invitation, and soon after staggered into the tent occupied by Tom and his friend Ferguson.  \"What's the matter, Mr. Peabody?\" asked Tom. \"Are you sick?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Peabody, sinking to the floor. \"Something's the matter with my head. I don't feel well.\"  \"Have you been to the saloon, Mr. Peabody?\" asked Ferguson.  \"Yes,\" answered the Bostonian.  \"And while there you drank some of their vile whiskey, didn't you?\"  \"I'm a free man, Mr. Ferguson. If I choose to drink, what--what business is it--yours?\"  \"None, except as a friend I advise you not to go there again.\"  Further inquiries elicited the facts about the gambling, and Ferguson and Tom seriously remonstrated with Peabody, who, however, insisted that Mr. Jack, as he called him, was a hospitable gentleman.  The dust which Peabody had lost should have been paid to Capt. Fletcher, as his share of the expenses that same evening. Of course this was now impossible. Fletcher warned him that any subsequent failure from the same cause would be followed by an exclusion from his table.     CHAPTER III.  HOW TOM GOT ON.   About this time Tom took account of stock. He had come out to California with the noble and praiseworthy purpose of earning money to help his father pay off the mortgage on his little farm. He was the more anxious to succeed, because two hundred dollars of the amount had been raised to defray his expenses across the continent. The mortgage, amounting now to twenty-two hundred dollars, was held by Squire Hudson, a wealthy resident of the same town, who hoped eventually to find an excuse for fore-closing the mortgage, and ejecting Mr. Nelson's family. He was actuated not alone by mercenary motives, but also to gratify an ancient grudge. In early life Mrs. Nelson, Tom's mother, had rejected the suit of the wealthy squire, and this insult, as he chose to characterize it, he had never forgotten or forgiven.  Had Tom been aware of"]]]
