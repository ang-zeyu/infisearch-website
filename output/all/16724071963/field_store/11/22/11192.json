MOB ROUND THE QUEEN'S RESIDENCE. DISSATISFACTION OF THE KING.     CHAPTER II.   On the 1st of June, Caroline of Brunswick arrived at St. Omer, intending to embark at Calais without delay for England. At once she showed her disposition to carry matters with a high hand. She wrote an imperious letter to the Earl of Liverpool, to prepare a palace in London for her reception; another to Lord Melville, to send a yacht to carry her across the Channel to Dover; and a third to the Duke of York, repeating both demands, and complaining of the treatment she had received. Two days later, Mr. Brougham, her chief legal adviser, arrived, and at the same time Lord Hutchinson, with a proposition from the King, offering her 50,000_l._ a year for life if she would remain on the Continent, and surrender the title of Queen of England. She was in no mood to listen to reason, and indignantly rejected the offer.  The rumour of the Queen's approach created extraordinary excitement among all classes in every part of the kingdom. The Lord Chancellor prophetically says, \"If she can venture, she is the most courageous lady I ever heard of. The mischief, if she does come, will be infinite. At first, she will have extensive popularity with the multitude; in a few short months or weeks, she will be ruined in the opinion of all the world.\"[20] \"One can't help admiring her spirit,\" observes the moral Wilberforce, \"though I fear she has been very profligate.\"[21] From such a man there might have been expected a severer judgment on her immorality, and a more subdued appreciation of her daring; but this evidence of \"spirit\" was an appeal to the English people which many a grave father of a family found it impossible to resist. Mr. Wilberforce, however, much to his credit, was earnestly desirous of lessening the threatened scandal, and diminishing the public commotion it was likely to create. He writes in his Diary,--\"When, therefore, Lord Castlereagh had made a motion to refer the papers to the consideration of a Secret Committee, I endeavoured to interpose a pause, during which the two parties might have an opportunity of contemplating coolly the prospect before them. Accordingly I sounded the House; my proposition was immediately adopted, and a pause was made, with a declaration that its purpose was to give opportunity for a private settlement.\"[22]        [20] Twiss's \"Life of Lord Eldon,\" vol. ii. p. 3.        [21] \"Wilberforce's Life,\" by his Sons, vol. v. p. 55.        [22] Ibid.  As no Royal yacht was likely to be at her disposal, Queen Caroline lost no time in embarking, crossed the sea safely, pursued her route to the metropolis through Canterbury, and, passing through vociferous crowds, on the 7th, in default of the palace she had ordered, took up her residence with a City alderman, who had placed himself among the foremost of her champions. From this time the agitation in the public mind hourly increased, till it began to assume a most threatening aspect. Nothing was left undone by the Queen to ingratiate herself with the people; and, as a natural result, she never appeared publicly without creating intense excitement. When in the streets, her horses were taken from her carriage, and she was drawn in triumph, by scores of shouting adherents, through a clamorous mob. Before the alderman's house in South Audley Street stood hour after hour a shouting myriad, excited to a pitch of frenzy to which no description can do justice, by the appearance on the balcony of a stout lady, in a large hat surmounted by a plume of feathers.  On the day of her arrival in town, the King sent a message to the Houses of Lords and Commons, to the effect that the step taken by the Queen had forced him to bring before the consideration of Parliament, certain papers detailing her conduct since her departure from England. The Queen, on the same day, sent a message by Mr. Brougham, in her usual high tone, expressing a desire for an open investigation. The friends of both parties were striving to spare the country the threatened exposure; and on the 9th, the Queen so far complied with the suggestions of her most sensible advisers as to write a moderate letter to Lord Liverpool, expressing her inclination to consider any proposition the Government were disposed to make in behalf of their Sovereign. Communications were exchanged; the Ministers repeated their liberal offer, and the Queen repeated her indignant refusal. How this sad business was felt at the period may be gathered from the letters that follow. But the first expresses a belief, then generally gaining ground, of a change in the Government in favour of the Grenville party. It would appear as if a proposal of the kind had been submitted to the head of the family, but the sensible advice here given must at once have put an end to such a negotiation:--       LORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Dropmore, 12 at night, June 11.      We have both talked this thing over as fully as our materials     enabled us to do, and it is our decided opinion that the King has,     and can have in the present moment, only the alternative of putting     himself fairly and fully into the hands of one or other of the two     great parties; and that it would be deceiving him, and trifling     with a most awful state of things, if anybody undertook to be     useful to him on any other footing, or even gave rise to the delay     of an hour in deciding on that alternative by countenancing hopes     of any third arrangement.      The House of Commons is totally unmanageable in any such view. The     whole weight of the Ministers there, combining their aid as they     now do, is, as you see, hardly sufficient to carry on the ordinary     public business from day to day. I very much question whether all     the weight that the Opposition could unite for the same purpose, if     the task were committed into their hands, would be much, if at all,     more adequate to it. What hopes, then, could a third party     entertain of doing this in opposition to both?      I can easily see in what course your assistance and support might     be very useful indeed to strengthen his Government, into whatever     hands he may finally determine to commit it; and in the present     state of things I should, as far as my own wishes went, be most     anxious that, in whatever hands it shall be vested, it should     possess whatever of strength and efficiency it can receive. But as     for undertaking any principal or leading part in the formation of a     new Government, to the exclusion of the most considerable persons     in this, and of the whole of the other party (who will doubtless on     this occasion act with perfect union and concurrence among     themselves), I hold the success impossible, and the undertaking     much too desperate to be reconciled to any just sense of prudence     or duty. And if the fact be so, it is most important that he should     be as speedily, and as distinctly as possible, apprized that so it     is. And you and Charles would much injure your own reputation and     weight by appearing to tamper with a case in which you cannot be of     any real use.      I do not wonder that he feels hurt at Canning's speech, such as it     is reported; but this is not the first occasion, nor will it be the     last, in which the Sovereign of this country must suppress such     feelings, and bear with the faults of those who, on the whole,     taking all things together, can serve him most usefully; and the     manner in which the Opposition have of late years, most     unfortunately for themselves and for the country, been drawn on to     mix themselves up with projects of reform, and with the countenance     and defence of reformers of the wildest description, seems to me, I     regret to say it, to throw that balance at this time wholly on the     side of their opponents.      I do not know that I can add more. My brother returns to town early     to-morrow morning; and you will not wonder, knowing my feelings,     that all that is now passing is with me a decisive reason for not     coming near it unless commanded so to do, and then it would only be     for the purpose of expressing these opinions.   Paris at this period, it is evident, was scarcely in a less excitable state than London:--       HON. COLONEL STANHOPE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Hotel Meurice, June 11, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD BUCKINGHAM,      Paris is in a strange state,--more resembling a town in a state of     siege than the most gadding capital; but, as far as the exterior     appearance can be the guide, I cannot see why the Government should     have assembled nearly 25,000 troops round Paris, the riots having     been confined to the students of the _écoles_ and the _gardes de     corps_, the people, _proprement dit_, taking no part and showing no     interest. The violence of the Chambers is sufficiently seen in the     papers, and their whole time is occupied in hearing different     members relate their own adventures on the preceding day. The     ultra-Ultras have returned to their foolish language, which ruined     them in '14 and '15, about having a general tax to reimburse them     for their lost property. They might as well think of dividing     France. The other party, of course, keep pace. Two days ago, some     French ladies on the Boulevards were obliged, by a body of men     looking like _le bourgeoisie_, to get out of their carriages and     cry \"_Vive l'egalité_.\" One of the worst circumstances is the     distinction which has "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22553"],["title","Memoirs of the Court of George IV. 1820-1830 (Vol 1) (#5)"],["body","made between _Le Roi et la Charte_,     which last year was the watchword of the Royalists, and is now     divided into the _mots de ralliement_ of the two parties; and when     the one cries _A bas la Charte_, others have been found rash enough     to answer _A bas les Bourbons_. The Royalists are universally     anxious for the double electoral colleges; their opponents will not     give up the direct election; and the amendment which was carried     the other day is a sort of _mezzo termine_, as the 170 new members     are to be elected by the double colleges, and the _remplacants_     by the old law. There was a considerable riot on Friday night, in     which Oudinot was rode over, and several people badly wounded; one     only killed. The troops have shown the greatest steadiness, and     evince rather an anxiety than an unwillingness to act. The Jacobins     are, I am told, as much depressed by this as the Ultras are elated.     Madame de Flahaut is here, acting the French Lady J----; and to you     I need say no more.      I am in a great fright about the Queen. What could make the     Government employ Lord H----, who seems to have committed himself     and employers most lamentably? She will, I fear, have a tremendous     party of many well-disposed, good, moral men, as well as of all     those who hate the King and the Government. If you have leisure, I     should be very grateful for a word or two on this.      Ever affectionately yours,      J. W. STANHOPE.   The negotiation between the King's Ministers and the Queen's legal advisers was not rendered fruitless by any fault of the former. Wilberforce acknowledges that \"The concessions made by the King's servants, as Mr. Brougham afterwards declared in the House of Commons, were various and great. The name and rights of a Queen were granted to her Majesty without reserve--any recognition of which had formerly been carefully avoided. A Royal yacht, a frigate, &c., were offered. It was agreed that her name and rank should be notified at the Court either of Rome or Milan, the capitals of the countries in which she had expressed her intention to reside; and that an address should be presented to the Queen, no less than another to the King, to thank her Majesty for having acceded to the wish of the House of Commons.\"[23]        [23] \"Life,\" vol. v. p. 56.  Wilberforce was very earnest, sending his son with a letter to the King, in which he entreated him to restore the Queen's name to the Liturgy,[24] and venturing to prophesy something very like a civil war should this concession be refused. On this point, however, his Majesty was intractable, and the negotiator met with anything but cordial co-operation from his own party, of whom he says: \"Opposition seem all disposed to take up the Queen's cause on party principles. Alas!\"[25] Subsequently he implies where he met with obstacles; \"Tierney, &c., ill-natured, yet Castlereagh gave way.\"        [24] The Queen perpetrated one of her characteristic jests when       this question was being furiously debated: \"The praying,\" she       observed, \"makes me very hungry, and when I am in the Liturgy I       shall be famished.\"        [25] Ibid. p. 58.  In a discussion on the subject in the House of Commons, he thus refers to the principal speakers: \"Burdett, violent and bitter, but very able; Tierney, mischievous; Denman, strong and straightforward; Brougham, able; Canning, clever, but not letting himself out.\"  A deputation, of which Wilberforce was the head, proceeded from the House of Commons to the Queen, dressed in full Court costume; but her Majesty's turbulent admirers did not appreciate their good intentions, and they were roughly greeted by the mob. The reception they met with from the Queen was not much more courteous. Her answer was a refusal. \"Her manner was extremely dignified,\" observes the principal negotiator, \"but very stern and haughty.\" In a letter which he wrote at the time, he gives all the details of the question,[26] from which it is clear that the members of Government had agreed to resign their offices if the restoration of the Queen's name to the Liturgy was carried against them in the House of Commons; and that, seeing the improbability of obtaining this demand, the Queen would have accepted an equivalent proposed by the Government, had not some sinister influence been exercised which brought about her refusal. Mr. Wilberforce shared the general fate of peace-makers in getting terribly abused; but he evidently had the authority of the Queen's most able counsellor for the steps he took. \"She will accede to your address,\" he wrote on the 22nd of June, \"I pledge myself.\"[27]        [26] Letter to Samuel Roberts, Esq., \"Life,\" vol. v. p. 62.        [27] Letter to Samuel Roberts, Esq., \"Life,\" vol. v. p. 65.  Cobbett published a letter addressed to Mr. Wilberforce, made up of declamation and invective, in the style that then took the public taste. This composition is described as \"very clever, but very mischievous, and full of falsehoods.\" He was attacked so frequently, and with such violence, by the Queen's partisans, that it forced him to exclaim, \"What a lesson it is to a man not to set his heart on low popularity, when, after forty years' disinterested public service, I am believed to be a perfect rascal!\"[28]        [28] \"Wilberforce's Life,\" vol. v. p. 68.  He complained bitterly of the conduct of the leaders of Opposition. Their language to the Queen, especially that of Lord Grey, Mr. Tierney, and Sir Francis Burdett, was, \"Oh! you may be sure you never can be prosecuted,\"--thereby, as he acknowledges, \"taking away what must doubtless have most powerfully enforced her consent. Then no sooner had she refused, and the prosecution goes forward, than they say, Government never should have admitted a compromise at all, but have prosecuted without hesitation.\"[29]        [29] Ibid. p. 69.  \"She seems,\" writes Lord Dudley, \"to have been advised by persons that are resolved to play the deepest possible game, and care little to what risk they expose her, provided they have a chance of turning out the Government, or perhaps of over-throwing the monarchy. I do not think that it is Brougham's doing.\"[30] \"The people,\" confesses Cobbett, \"as far as related to the question of guilt or innocence, did not care a straw.\"[31] Their leaders cared still less:      \"Careless of fate, they took their way,     Scarce caring who might win the day;     Their booty was secure.\"        [30] \"Letters,\" p. 255.        [31] \"Life of George IV.,\" p. 425.  \"If her innocence were proved,\" observes a popular historian, \"they would gain a triumph over the King, force upon him a wife whom he could not endure, overturn his Ministers, and perhaps shake the monarchy; if her guilt, they would gain the best possible ground for declaiming on the corruption which prevailed in high places, and the monstrous nature of those institutions which gave persons of such character the lead in society.\"[32]        [32] Alison's \"Europe,\" vol. ii. p. 549.  The excitement increased as the arrangements for the Queen's trial became known. Lord John Russell published a letter addressed to Mr. Wilberforce, on the subject, urging him again to attempt an arrangement; but he had had enough of interfering in such a business, and declined to take the post assigned him, though the writer expressed his opinion that in his hands was perhaps the fate of the country. He was as anxious as ever to do good, but did not see how it could be done. His opinion of the Queen did not improve, in consequence of the \"spirit\" she continued to display, which he now felt inclined to describe in more appropriate language:--\"I feel deeply the evil,\" he writes in his Diary, \"that so bad a woman as I fear she is, should carry the victory by sheer impudence (if she is guilty), and assume the part of a person deeply injured.\"[33]        [33] \"Life,\" vol. v. p. 77.  Other well-meaning persons were equally anxious for an interposition; indeed, the King was obliged to send a message to one who desired an audience, with this object in view, \"that he never talked on political subjects with any but his Ministers.\"[34]        [34] Ibid. p. 78.  Another cotemporary Diarist goes to the root of the evil:--\"Had some conversation with Tierney, who looked serious and down. He said everything was worse and worse out of doors, and he saw no remedy. I observed, the only remedy, the only possibility of things returning to their former state was a rebellion, and the troops standing by us, and quelling it with a high hand. He replied, that was the disease. I said, neither he nor I should live to see society where it had been and ought to be; to which he assented. I have no doubt he is sincere, yet he and his party are the real authors of the spirit we deplore.\"[35]        [35] Phipps's \"Memoirs of R. P. Ward,\" vol. ii. p. 61.  \"Alas!\" writes Wilberforce in his Diary, \"surely we never were in such a scrape. The bulk of the people, I grant, are run mad; but then it was a species of insanity on which we might have reckoned, because we know their prejudices against foreigners; their being easily led away by appeals to their generous feelings; and then the doses with which they are plied, are enough to intoxicate much stronger heads than most of theirs.\"[36]        [36] \"Life,\" vol. v. p. 78.  \"The middling as well as the higher orders,\" says another observer, \"are pretty well acquainted with her present Majesty's conduct in foreign countries; but I am told that the common people are still in the dark, and disposed to espouse her cause; more, however, out of hatred to the King than out of regard for her.\"[37]        [37] Lord Dudley's \"Letters,\" p 242.  Attempts were made to gain over the military, which were not entirely unsuccessful; one of the regiments of Foot Guards, quartered in the Mews Barracks, Charing Cross, exhibited such decided symptoms of having been tampered with, that the Duke"]]]
