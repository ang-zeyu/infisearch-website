To the Earl of Leicester's troupe she issued a special royal license, authorizing them to act \"as well within our city of London and liberties of the same, as also within the liberties and freedoms of any our cities, towns, boroughs, etc., whatsoever\"; and to the mayors and other officers she gave strict orders not to interfere with such performances: \"Willing and commanding you, and every of you, as ye tender our pleasure, to permit and suffer them herein without any your lets, hindrances, or molestation during the term aforesaid, any act, statute, proclamation, or commandment heretofore made, or hereafter to be made, to the contrary notwithstanding.\"  [Footnote 28: Dasent, _Acts of the Privy Council_, VIII, 131, 132.]  This license was a direct challenge to the authority of the Lord Mayor. He dared not answer it as directly; but on December 6, 1574, he secured from the Common Council the passage of an ordinance which placed such heavy restrictions upon acting as virtually to nullify the license issued by the Queen, and to regain for the Mayor complete control of the drama within the city. The Preamble of this remarkable ordinance clearly reveals the puritanical character of the City Government:       Whereas heretofore sundry great disorders and inconveniences      have been found to ensue to this city by the inordinate      haunting of great multitudes of people, specially youths, to      plays, interludes, and shews: namely, occasion of frays and      quarrels; evil practises of incontinency in great inns      having chambers and secret places adjoining to their open      stages and galleries; inveigling and alluring of maids,      specially orphans and good citizens' children under age, to      privy and unmeet contracts; the publishing of unchaste,      uncomly, and unshamefaced speeches and doings; withdrawing      of the Queen's Majesty's subjects from divine service on      Sundays and holy days, at which times such plays were      chiefly used; unthrifty waste of the money of the poor and      fond persons; sundry robberies by picking and cutting of      purses; uttering of popular, busy, and seditious matters;      and many other corruptions of youth, and other enormities;      besides that also sundry slaughters and maimings of the      Queen's subjects have happened by ruins of scaffolds,      frames, and stages, and by engines, weapons, and powder used      in plays. And whereas in time of God's visitation by the      plague such assemblies of the people in throng and press      have been very dangerous for spreading of infection.... And      for that the Lord Mayor and his brethren the Aldermen,      together with the grave and discreet citizens in the Common      Council assembled, do doubt and fear lest upon God's      merciful withdrawing his hand of sickness from us (which God      grant), the people, specially the meaner and most unruly      sort, should with sudden forgetting of His visitation,      without fear of God's wrath, and without due respect of the      good and politique means that He hath ordained for the      preservation of common weals and peoples in health and good      order, return to the undue use of such enormities, to the      great offense of God....[29]  [Footnote 29: For the complete document see W.C. Hazlitt, _The English Drama and Stage_, p. 27.]  The restrictions on playing imposed by the ordinance may be briefly summarized:  1. Only such plays should be acted as were free from all unchastity, seditiousness, and \"uncomely matter.\"  2. Before being acted all plays should be \"first perused and allowed in such order and form, and by such persons as by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen for the time being shall be appointed.\"  3. Inns or other buildings used for acting, and their proprietors, should both be licensed by the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen.  4. The proprietors of such buildings should be \"bound to the Chamberlain of London\" by a sufficient bond to guarantee \"the keeping of good order, and avoiding of\" the inconveniences noted in the Preamble.  5. No plays should be given during the time of sickness, or during any inhibition ordered at any time by the city authorities.  6. No plays should be given during \"any usual time of divine service,\" and no persons should be admitted into playing places until after divine services were over.  7. The proprietors of such places should pay towards the support of the poor a sum to be agreed upon by the city authorities.  In order, however, to avoid trouble with the Queen, or those noblemen who were accustomed to have plays given in their homes for the private entertainment of themselves and their guests, the Common Council added, rather grudgingly, the following proviso:       Provided alway that this act (otherwise than touching the      publishing of unchaste, seditious, and unmeet matters) shall      not extend to any plays, interludes, comedies, tragedies, or      shews to be played or shewed in the private house, dwelling,      or lodging of any nobleman, citizen, or gentleman, which      shall or will then have the same there so played or shewed      in his presence for the festivity of any marriage, assembly      of friends, or other like cause, without public or common      collections of money of the auditory or beholders thereof.  Such regulations if strictly enforced would prove very annoying to the players. But, as the Common Council itself informs us, \"these orders were not then observed.\" The troupes continued to play in the city, protected against any violent action on the part of the municipal authorities by the known favor of the Queen and the frequent interference of the Privy Council. This state of affairs was not, of course, comfortable for the actors; but it was by no means desperate, and for several years after the passage of the ordinance of 1574 they continued without serious interruption to occupy their inn-playhouses.  The long-continued hostility of the city authorities, however, of which the ordinance of 1574 was an ominous expression, led more or less directly to the construction of special buildings devoted to plays and situated beyond the jurisdiction of the Common Council. As the Reverend John Stockwood, in _A Sermon Preached at Paules Crosse, 1578_, indignantly puts it:       Have we not _houses of purpose_, built with great charges      for the maintenance of plays, and that _without the      liberties_, as who would say \"_There, let them say what they      will say, we will play!_\"  Thus came into existence playhouses; and with them dawned a new era in the history of the English drama.  [Illustration: THE SITE OF THE FIRST PLAYHOUSES  Finsbury Field and Holywell. The man walking from the Field towards Shoreditch is just entering Holywell Lane.  (From Agas's _Map of London_, representing the city as it was about 1560.)]     CHAPTER III  THE THEATRE   The hostility of the city to the drama was unquestionably the main cause of the erection of the first playhouse; yet combined with this were two other important causes, usually overlooked. The first was the need of a building specially designed to meet the requirements of the players and of the public, a need yearly growing more urgent as plays became more complex, acting developed into a finer art, and audiences increased in dignity as well as in size. The second and the more immediate cause was the appearance of a man with business insight enough to see that such a building would pay. The first playhouse, we should remember, was not erected by a troupe of actors, but by a money-seeking individual.[30] Although he was himself an actor, and the manager of a troupe, he did not, it seems, take the troupe into his confidence. In complete independence of any theatrical organization he proceeded with the erection of his building as a private speculation; and, we are told, he dreamed of the \"continual great profit and commodity through plays that should be used there every week.\"  [Footnote 30: I emphasize this point because the opposite is the accepted opinion. We find it expressed in _The Cambridge History of English Literature_, VI, 431, as follows: \"Certain players, finding the city obdurate, and unwilling to submit to its severe regulations, began to look about them for some means of carrying on their business out of reach of the mayor's authority,\" etc.]  This man, \"the first builder of playhouses,\"--and, it might have been added, the pioneer in a new field of business,--was James Burbage, originally, as we are told by one who knew him well, \"by occupation a joiner; and reaping but a small living by the same, gave it over and became a common player in plays.\"[31] As an actor he was more successful, for as early as 1572 we find him at the head of Leicester's excellent troupe.  [Footnote 31: Deposition by Robert Myles, 1592, printed in Wallace's _The First London Theatre_, p. 141.]  Having in 1575 conceived the notion of erecting a building specially designed for dramatic entertainments, he was at once confronted with the problem of a suitable location. Two conditions narrowed his choice: first, the site had to be outside the jurisdiction of the Common Council; secondly, it had to be as near as possible to the city.  No doubt he at once thought of the two suburbs that were specially devoted to recreation, the Bankside to the south, and Finsbury Field to the north of the city. The Bankside had for many years been associated in the minds of Londoners with \"sports and pastimes.\" Thither the citizens were accustomed to go to witness bear-baiting and bull-baiting, to practice archery, and to engage in various athletic sports. Thither, too, for many years the actors had gone to present their plays. In 1545 King Henry VIII had issued a proclamation against vagabonds, ruffians, idle persons, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],["title","Shakespearean Playhouses (#5)"],["body","players,[32] in which he referred to their \"fashions commonly used at the Bank.\" The Bankside, however, was associated with the lowest and most vicious pleasures of London, for here were situated the stews, bordering the river's edge. Since the players were at this time subject to the bitterest attacks from the London preachers, Burbage wisely decided not to erect the first permanent home of the drama in a locality already a common target for puritan invective.  [Footnote 32: See page 134.]  The second locality, Finsbury Field, had nearly all the advantages, and none of the disadvantages, of the Bankside. Since 1315 the Field had been in the possession of the city,[33] and had been used as a public playground, where families could hold picnics, falconers could fly their hawks, archers could exercise their sport, and the militia on holidays could drill with all \"the pomp and circumstance of glorious war.\" In short, the Field was eminently respectable, was accessible to the city, and was definitely associated with the idea of entertainment. The locality, therefore, was almost ideal for the purpose Burbage had in mind.[34]  [Footnote 33: See _The Remembrancia_, p. 274; Stow, _Survey_. The Corporation of London held the manor on lease from St. Paul's Cathedral until 1867.]  [Footnote 34: Doubtless, too, Burbage was influenced in his choice by the fact that he had already made his home in the Liberty of Shoreditch, near Finsbury Field.]  The new playhouse, of course, could not be erected in the Field itself, which was under the control of the city; but just to the east of the Field certain vacant land, part of the dissolved Priory of Holywell, offered a site in every way suitable to the purpose. The Holywell property, at the dissolution of the Priory, had passed under the jurisdiction of the Crown, and hence the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen could not enforce municipal ordinances there. Moreover, it was distant from the city wall not much more than half a mile. The old conventual church had been demolished, the Priory buildings had been converted into residences, and the land near the Shoreditch highway had been built up with numerous houses. The land next to the Field, however, was for the most part undeveloped. It contained some dilapidated tenements, a few old barns formerly belonging to the Priory, and small garden plots, conspicuous objects in the early maps.  [Illustration: THE SITE OF THE FIRST PLAYHOUSES  Finsbury Field lies to the north (beyond Moor Field, the small rectangular space next to the city wall), and the Holywell Property lies to the right of Finsbury Field, between the Field and the highway. Holywell Lane divides the garden plots; the Theatre was erected just to the north, and the Curtain just to the south of this lane, facing the Field. (From the _Map of London_ by Braun and Hogenbergius representing the city as it was in 1554-1558.)]  Burbage learned that a large portion of this land lying next to the Field was in the possession of a well-to-do gentleman named Gyles Alleyn,[35] and that Alleyn was willing to lease a part of his holding on the conditions of development customary in this section of London. These conditions are clearly revealed in a chancery suit of 1591:       The ground there was for the most part converted first into      garden plots, and then leasing the same to diverse tenants      caused them to covenant or promise to build upon the same,      by occasion whereof the buildings which are there were for      the most part erected and the rents increased.[36]  [Footnote 35: For a detailed history of the property from the year 1128, and for the changes in the ownership of Alleyn's portion after the dissolution, see Braines, _Holywell Priory_.]  [Footnote 36: Halliwell-Phillipps, _Outlines_, I, 365. The suit concerns the Curtain property, somewhat south of the Alleyn property, but a part of the Priory.]  The part of Alleyn's property on which Burbage had his eye was in sore need of improvement. It consisted of five \"paltry tenements,\" described as \"old, decayed, and ruinated for want of reparation, and the best of them was but of two stories high,\" and a long barn \"very ruinous and decayed and ready to have fallen down,\" one half of which was used as a storage-room, the other half as a slaughter-house. Three of the tenements had small gardens extending back to the Field, and just north of the barn was a bit of \"void ground,\" also adjoining the Field. It was this bit of \"void ground\" that Burbage had selected as a suitable location for his proposed playhouse. The accompanying map of the property[37] will make clear the position of this \"void ground\" and of the barns and tenements about it. Moreover, it will serve to indicate the exact site of the Theatre. If one will bear in mind the fact that in the London of to-day Curtain Road marks the eastern boundary of Finsbury Field, and New Inn Yard cuts off the lower half of the Great Barn, he will be able to place Burbage's structure within a few yards.[38]  [Footnote 37: I have based this map in large measure on the documents presented by Braines in his excellent pamphlet, _Holywell Priory_.]  [Footnote 38: For proof see Braines, _op. cit._]  [Illustration: A PLAN OF BURBAGE'S HOLYWELL PROPERTY  Based on the lease, and on the miscellaneous documents printed by Halliwell-Phillipps and by Braines. The \"common sewer\" is now marked by Curtain Road, and the \"ditch from the horse-pond\" by New Inn Yard.]  The property is carefully described in the lease--quoted below--which Burbage secured from Alleyn, but the reader will need to refer to the map in order to follow with ease the several paragraphs of description:[39]       All those two houses or tenements, with appurtenances, which      at the time of the said former demise made were in the      several tenures or occupations of Joan Harrison, widow, and      John Dragon.       And also all that house or tenement with the appurtenances,      together with the garden ground lying behind part of the      same, being then likewise in the occupation of William      Gardiner; which said garden plot doth extend in breadth from      a great stone wall there which doth enclose part of the      garden then or lately being in the occupation of the said      Gyles, unto the garden there then in the occupation of Edwin      Colefox, weaver, and in length from the same house or      tenement unto a brick wall there next unto the fields      commonly called Finsbury Fields.       And also all that house or tenement, with the appurtenances,      at the time of the said former demise made called or known      by the name of the Mill-house; together with the garden      ground lying behind part of the same, also at the time of      the said former demise made being in the tenure or      occupation of the aforesaid Edwin Colefox, or of his      assigns; which said garden ground doth extend in length from      the same house or tenement unto the aforesaid brick wall      next unto the aforesaid Fields.       And also all those three upper rooms, with the      appurtenances, next adjoining to the aforesaid Mill-house,      also being at the time of the said former demise made in the      occupation of Thomas Dancaster, shoemaker, or of his      assigns; and also all the nether rooms, with the      appurtenances, lying under the same three upper rooms, and      next adjoining also to the aforesaid house or tenement      called the Mill-house, then also being in the several      tenures or occupations of Alice Dotridge, widow, and Richard      Brockenbury, or of their assigns; together with the garden      ground lying behind the same, extending in length from the      same nether rooms down unto the aforesaid brick wall next      unto the aforesaid Fields, and then or late being also in      the tenure or occupation of the aforesaid Alice Dotridge.       And also so much of the ground and soil lying and being      afore all the tenements or houses before granted, as      extendeth in length from the outward part of the aforesaid      tenements being at the time of the making of the said former      demise in the occupation of the aforesaid Joan Harrison and      John Dragon, unto a pond there being next unto the barn or      stable then in the occupation of the right honorable the      Earl of Rutland or of his assigns, and in breadth from the      aforesaid tenement or Mill-house to the midst of the well      being afore the same tenements.       And also all that Great Barn, with the appurtenances, at the      time of the making of the said former demise made being in      the several occupations of Hugh Richards, innholder, and      Robert Stoughton, butcher; and also a little piece of ground      then inclosed with a pale and next adjoining to the      aforesaid barn, and then or late before that in the      occupation of the said Robert Stoughton; together also with      all the ground and soil lying and being between the said      nether rooms last before expressed, and the aforesaid Great      Barn, and the aforesaid pond; that is to say, extending in      length from the aforesaid pond unto a ditch beyond the brick      wall next the aforesaid Fields.
