He has robbed me of everything--everything!\"  \"Tell us--finish your story,\" urged the professor.  Frank said nothing. The light from a window shone close by the old man. Frank was waiting for the man to change his position so the light would shine on his face.  For some moments the man seemed too agitated to proceed, but he finally went on.  \"My son--my son fell into the hands of this wretched bandit. Pacheco took him captive. Then he sent word to me that he would murder my son if I did not appear and pay two thousand dollars ransom money. Two thousand dollars! I did not have it in the world. But I had a little home. I sold it--I sold everything to raise the money to save my boy. I obtained it. And then--then, my friends, I received another letter. Then Pacheco demanded three thousand dollars.\"  \"Der brice vos on der jump,\" murmured Hans.  \"But that is not the worst!\" cried the old man, waving his arms, excitedly. \"Oh, the monster--the demon!\"  He wrung his hands, and groaned as if with great anguish.  \"Be calm, be calm,\" urged Professor Scotch. \"My dear sir, you are working yourself into a dreadful state.\"  \"How can I be calm?\" groaned the stranger. \"It is not possible to be calm and think of such a terrible thing!\"  \"What terrible thing?\" asked Frank. \"You have not told the entire story, and we do not know what you mean.\"  \"True, true. Listen! With that letter Pacheco--the monster!--sent one of my boy's little fingers!\"  \"Shimminy Gristmas! I don'd toldt you dot, do I?\"  \"Horrible! horrible!\"  The professor and Hans uttered these exclamations, but Frank was calm and apparently unmoved, with his eyes still fastened on the face of the old man.  \"How you toldt dot vos der finger uf your son, mister?\"  \"That's it, that's it--how could you tell?\" asked the professor.  \"My son--my own boy--he added a line to the letter, stating that the finger had been taken from his left hand, and that Pacheco threatened to cut off his fingers one by one and send them to me if I did not hasten with the ransom money.\"  \"Dot seddled you!\"  \"You recognized the handwriting as that of your son?\"  \"I did; but I recognized something besides that.\"  \"What?\"  \"The finger.\"  \"Oh, you may have been mistaken in that--surely you may.\"  \"I was not.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"By a mark on the finger.\"  \"Ah! what sort of a mark?\"  \"A peculiar scar like a triangle, situated between the first and second joints. Besides that, the nail had once been crushed, after which it was never perfect.\"  \"That was quite enough,\" nodded Professor Scotch.  \"Yah,\" agreed Hans; \"dot peen quide enough alretty.\"  Still Frank was silent, watching and waiting, missing not a word that fell from the man's lips, missing not a gesture, failing to note no move.  This silence on the part of Merriwell seemed to affect the man, who turned to him, saying, a trifle sharply:  \"Boy, boy, have you no sympathy with me? Think of the suffering I have passed through! You should pity me.\"  \"What are you trying to do now?\" asked Frank, quietly.  \"I am trying to raise some money to ransom my son.\"  \"But I thought you did raise money?\"  \"So I did, but not enough.\"  \"Finish the story.\"  \"Well, when I received that letter I immediately hastened to this land of bandits and half-breeds. I did not have three thousand dollars, but I hoped that what I had would be enough to soften Pacheco's heart--to save my poor boy.\"  \"And you failed?\"  The old man groaned again.  \"My boy is still in Pacheco's power, and I have not a dollar left in all the world! Failed--miserably failed!\"  \"Well, what do you hope to do--what are you trying to do?\"  \"Raise five hundred dollars.\"  \"How?\"  \"In any way.\"  \"By begging?\"  \"I do not know how. Anyway, anyway will do!\"  \"But you cannot raise it by begging in this land, man,\" said the professor. \"This is a land of beggars. Everybody seems to be poor and wretched.\"  \"But I have found some of my own countrymen, and I hoped that you might have pity on me--oh, I did hope!\"  \"What? You didn't expect us to give you five hundred dollars?\"  \"Think of my boy--my poor boy! Pacheco has threatened to murder him by inches--to cut him up and send him to me in pieces! Is it not something terrible to contemplate?\"  \"Vell, I should dink id vos!\" gurgled the Dutch boy.  \"But how did you lose your money?\"  \"I was robbed.\"  \"By whom?\"  \"Pacheco.\"  \"How did it happen?\"  \"I fell into his hands.\"  \"And he took your money without setting your son free?\"  \"He did.\"  \"Did you tell him it was all you had in the world?\"  \"I told him that a score of times.\"  \"What did he say?\"  \"Told me to raise more, or have the pleasure of receiving my boy in pieces.\"  \"How long ago was that?\"  \"Three days.\"  \"Near here?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How long have you been in Mendoza?\"  \"Two days, and during that time I have received this from Pacheco.\"  He took something from his pocket--something wrapped in a handkerchief. With trembling fingers, he unrolled it, exposing to view----  A bloody human finger!     CHAPTER IV.  UNMASKED.   Hans and Professor Scotch uttered exclamations of horror, starting back from the sight revealed by the light that came from the window set deep in the adobe wall.  Frank's teeth came together with a peculiar click, but he uttered no exclamation, nor did he start.  This seemed to affect the old man unpleasantly, for he turned on Frank, crying in an accusing manner and tone:  \"Have you no heart? Are you made of stone?\"  \"Hardly,\" was the reply.  \"This finger--it is the second torn from the hand of my boy by Pacheco, the bandit--Pacheco, the monster!\"  \"Pacheco seems to be a man of great determination.\"  Professor Scotch gazed at Frank in astonishment, for the boy was of a very sympathetic and kindly nature, and he now seemed quite unlike his usual self.  \"Frank, Frank, think of the suffering of this poor father!\"  \"Yah,\" murmured Hans; \"shust dink how pad you vould felt uf you efer peen py his blace,\" put in Hans, sobbing, chokingly.  \"It is very, very sad,\" said Frank; but there seemed to be a singularly sarcastic ring to the words which fell from his lips.  \"Have you seen your son since he fell into the hands of Pacheco, sir?\" asked the professor.  \"Yes, I saw him; but I could scarcely recognize him, he was so changed--so wan and ghastly. The skin is drawn tightly over his bones, and he looks as if he were nearly starved to death.\"  \"Did he recognize you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What did he do?\"  The man wrung his hands with a gesture of unutterable anguish.  \"Oh, his appeal--I can hear it now! He begged me to save him, or to give him poison that he might kill himself!\"  \"Where is he now?\"  \"In a cave.\"  \"Where is the cave?\"  \"That I cannot tell, for I was blindfolded all the time, except while in the cave where my boy is kept.\"  \"It is near Mendoza?\"  \"It must be within fifty miles of here.\"  \"Perhaps it is nearer?\"  \"Possibly.\"  \"But you have no means of knowing in which direction it lies?\"  \"No.\"  \"Your only hope is to raise the five hundred dollars?\"  \"That is my only hope, and that can scarcely be called a hope, for I must have the money within a day or two, or my boy will be dead.\"  \"Hum! hum!\" coughed the professor. \"This is a very unfortunate affair--very unfortunate. I am not a wealthy man, but I----\"  \"You will aid me?\" shouted the old man, joyously. \"Heaven will bless you, sir--Heaven will bless you!\"  \"I have not said so--I have not said I would aid you,\" Scotch hastily said. \"I am going to consider the matter--I'll think it over.\"  \"Then I have no hope.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"If your heart is not opened now, it will never open. My poor boy is lost, and I am ready for death!\"  The old man seemed to break down and sob like a child, burying his face in his hands, his body shaking convulsively.  Frank made a quick gesture to the others, pressing a finger to his lips as a warning for silence.  In a moment the old man lifted his face, which seemed wet with tears.  \"My last hope is gone!\" he sighed. \"And you are travelers--you are rich!\"  He turned to Frank, to whom, with an appealing gesture, he extended a hand that was shaking as if with the palsy.  \"You--surely you will have sympathy with me! I can see by your face and your bearing that you are one of fortune's favorites--you are rich. A few dollars----\"  \"My dear man,\" said Frank, quite calmly, \"I should be more than delighted to aid you, if you had told the truth.\"  The old man fell back. He was standing fairly in the light which shone from the window.  \"What do you mean?\" he hoarsely asked. \"Do you think I have been lying to you--do you fancy such a thing?\"  \"I fancy nothing; I know you have lied!\"  \"Frank!\" cried Professor Scotch, in amazement.  \"Shimminy Gristmas!\" gurgled Hans Dunnerwust, in a dazed way.  The manner of the old man changed in a twinkling.  \"You are insolent, boy! You had better be careful!\"  \"Now you threaten,\" laughed Frank. \"Well, I expected as much from a beggar, a fraud, and a scoundrel!\"  Professor Scotch and Hans fell into each other's arms, overcome with excitement and wonder.  Frank was calm and deliberate, and he did not lift his voice above the tone used in ordinary conversation.  Still another step did the man fall back, and then a grating snarl broke from his lips, and he seemed overcome with rage. He leaned forward, hissing:  \"You insulting puppy!\"  \"The truth must always seem like an insult to a scoundrel.\"  \"Do you dare?\"  \"What is there to fear?\"  \"Much.\"  Frank snapped his fingers.  \"Your tune has changed in the twinkling of an eye. You are no longer the heart-broken father, begging for his boy; but you have flung aside some of the mask, and exposed your true nature.\"  Professor Scotch saw this was true, and he was quaking with fear of what might follow this remarkable change.  As for Hans, it took some time for ideas to work their way through his brain, and he was still in a bewildered condition.  For a moment the stranger"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22424"],["title","Frank Merriwell Down South (#4)"],["body","silent, seeming to choke back words which rose in his throat. Finally, he cried:  \"Oh, very well! I did not expect to get anything out of you; but it would have been far better for you if I had. Now----\"  \"What?\"  Frank asked the question, as the speaker faltered.  \"You shall soon learn what. I am going to leave you, but we shall see more of each other, don't forget that.\"  \"Wait--do not be in a hurry. I am not satisfied till I--see your face!\"  With the final words, Frank made a leap and a sweep of his hand, clutching the white beard the man wore, and tearing it from his face!  The beard was false!  The face exposed was smoothly shaven and weather-tanned.  \"Ha!\" cried Frank, triumphantly. \"I thought so! This poor old man is Carlos Merriwell, my villainous cousin!\"     CHAPTER V.  KIDNAPED.   As our old readers know, Carlos Merriwell was Frank's deadly enemy, although they were blood cousins.  Carlos was the son of Asher Merriwell, the brother of Frank's father.  At the time of his death, Asher Merriwell was supposed to be a crusty old bachelor, a man who had never cared for women and had never married. But he had not been a woman-hater all his life, and there was a romance in his career.  Asher Merriwell had been snared by the wiles of an adventuress, and he had married her. By this woman he had a son, but the marriage had been kept a secret, so that when she deceived him and they quarreled they were able to separate and live apart without the fact becoming public that Merriwell had been married.  Fortunately the woman died without openly proclaiming herself as the wife of Asher Merriwell. In her veins there had been Spanish blood, and her son was named Carlos.  After the death of his wife, Asher Merriwell set about providing for and educating the boy, although Carlos continued to bear his mother's maiden name of Durcal.  As Carlos grew up he developed into a wild and reckless young blade, making no amount of trouble and worry for his father.  Asher Merriwell did his best for the boy, but there was bad blood in the lad's veins, and it cost the man no small sums to settle for the various \"sports\" in which Carlos participated.  Finally Carlos took a fancy to strike out and see the world for himself, and he disappeared without telling whither he was going.  After this, he troubled his father at intervals until he committed a crime in a foreign country, where he was tried, convicted, and imprisoned for a long term of years.  This was the last straw so far as Asher Merriwell was concerned, and he straightway proceeded to disown Carlos, and cut him off without a cent.  It was afterward reported that Carl Durcal had been shot by guards while attempting to escape from prison, and Asher Merriwell died firmly believing himself to be sonless.  At his death, Asher left everything to Frank Merriwell, the son of his brother, and provided that Frank should travel under the guardianship of Professor Scotch, as the eccentric old uncle believed travel furnished the surest means for \"broadening the mind.\"  But Carlos Merriwell had not been killed, and he had escaped from prison. Finding he had been cut off without a dollar and everything had been left to Frank, Carlos was furious, and he swore that his cousin should not live to enjoy the property.  In some ways Carlos was shrewd; in others he was not. He was shrewd enough to see that he might have trouble in proving himself the son of Asher Merriwell by a lawful marriage, and so he did not attempt it.  But there was a still greater stumbling block in his way, for if he came out and announced himself and made a fight for the property, he would be forced to tell the truth concerning his past life, and the fact that he was an escaped convict would be made known.  Having considered these things, Carlos grew desperate. If he could not have his father's property, he swore again and again that Frank should not hold it.  With all the reckless abandon of his nature, Carlos made two mad attempts on Frank's life, both of which were baffled, and then the young desperado was forced to make himself scarce.  But Carlos had become an expert crook, and he was generally flush with ill-gotten gains, so he was able to put spies on Frank. He hired private detectives, and Frank was continually under secret surveillance.  Thus it came about that Carlos knew when Frank set about upon his travels, and he set a snare for the boy in New York City.  Straight into this snare Frank walked, but he escaped through his own exertions, and then baffled two further attempts on his life.  By this time Carlos found it necessary to disappear again, and Frank had neither seen nor heard from him till this moment, when the fellow stood unmasked in the Mexican town of Mendoza.  Frank had become so familiar with his villainous cousin's voice and gestures that Carlos had not been able to deceive him. From the first, Frank had believed the old man a fraud, and he was soon satisfied that the fellow was Carlos.  On Carlos Merriwell's cheek was a scar that had been hidden by the false beard--a scar that he would bear as long as he lived.  Professor Scotch nearly collapsed in a helpless heap, so completely astounded that he could not utter a word.  As for Hans, he simply gasped:  \"Shimminy Gristmas!\"  A snarling exclamation of fury broke from Carlos' lips.  \"Oh, you're too sharp, my fine cousin!\" he grated, his hand disappearing beneath the ragged blanket. \"You are too sharp to live!\"  Out came the hand, and a knife flashed in the light that shone from the window of the hotel. Frank, however, was on the alert, and was watching for just such a move. With a twisting movement, he drew his body aside, so the knife clipped down past his shoulder, cutting open his sleeve, but failing to reach his flesh.  \"That was near it,\" he said, as he whirled and caught Carlos by the wrist.  Frank had a clutch of iron, and he gave Carlos' wrist a wrench that forced a cry from the fellow's lips, and caused the knife to drop to the ground.  \"You are altogether too handy with such a weapon,\" said the boy, coolly. \"It is evident your adeptness with a dagger comes from your mother's side. Your face is dark and treacherous, and you look well at home in this land of dark and treacherous people.\"  Carlos ground forth a fierce exclamation, making a desperate move to fling Frank off, but failing.  \"Oh, you are smart!\" the fellow with the scarred face admitted. \"But you have been lucky. You were lucky at Fardale, and you were lucky in New York. Now you have come to a land where I will have my turn. You'll never leave Mexico alive!\"  \"I have listened to your threats before this.\"  \"I have made no threats that shall not come true.\"  \"What a desperate wretch you are, Carlos! I would have met you on even terms, and come to an agreement with you, if you----\"  \"Bah! Do you think I would make terms? Not much! You have robbed me of what is rightfully mine, and I have sworn you shall not take the good of it. I'll keep that oath!\"  A strange cry broke from his lips, as he found he could not tear his wrist from Frank's fingers.  Then came a rush of catlike footfalls and a clatter of hoofs. All at once voices were heard, crying:  \"Ladrones! ladrones!\"  Dark figures appeared on every hand, sending natives fleeing to shelter. Spanish oaths sounded on the evening air, and the glint of steel was seen.  \"Shimminy Gristmas!\" gurgled Hans Dunnerwust. \"Uf we don'd peen in a heap uf drouble, I know noddings!\"  \"It's the bandits, Frank!\" called Professor Scotch. \"They have charged right into the town, and they----\"  \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Carlos. \"You fear the bandits! They are my friends. They are here, and it is my turn!\"  A horseman was riding straight down on Frank, and the boy flung Carlos aside, making a leap that took him out of the way.  Something, glittering brightly, descended in a sweep toward Frank's head, but the blow was stopped by Carlos, who shouted something in Spanish.  Frank understood Spanish well enough to catch the drift of the words, and he knew his cousin had not saved him through compassion, but for quite another purpose.  Carlos coveted the riches into which Frank had fallen, and he meant to have a portion of the money. If Frank were killed, there was little chance that he would ever handle a dollar of the fortune, so he had cried out that his cousin was to be spared, captured, and held for ransom.  That was enough to warn Frank of the terrible peril that overshadowed him at the moment.  Out came his revolvers, and his back went against the wall. Upward were flung his hands, and the weapons began to crack.  Two horses fell, sent down by the first two bullets from the pistols of the boy at bay.  But Frank found he could not shoot horses and save himself, for dark forms were pressing upon him, and he must fall into the clutches of the bandits in another moment unless he resorted to the most desperate measures.  \"If you will have it, then you shall!\" he muttered, through his set teeth, turning his aim on the human forms.  Spouts of red fire shot from the muzzles of the revolvers, and the cracking of the weapons was followed by cries and groans.  Through a smoky haze Frank saw some of the dark figures fling up their arms and topple to the ground within a few feet of him.  He wondered what had become of Hans and the professor, for he could see nothing of either, and they had been close at hand a moment before.  In the midst of all this, Frank wondered at his own calmness. His one thought was that not a bullet should be wasted, and then he feared he would find his weapons empty and useless before the desperadoes were rebuffed.  But this reception was something the bandits had not expected from a boy. They had no heart to stand up before a lad who could shoot with the skill of a Gringo cowboy, and did not seem at all excited when attacked by twenty men.  Mexican half-bloods are cowards at heart, and, by the time they saw two or three of their number fall"]]]
