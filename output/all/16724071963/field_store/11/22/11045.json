When it was finished, the man cried:  \"Thet thar beats me! I don't understand it, none whatever.\"  \"No more do I,\" confessed Frank. \"There is no doubt but Burk was dead, and the corpse did not walk away of its own accord. It was my intention to investigate the mystery, but later events prevented.\"  Frank then explained about the kidnaping of Professor Scotch by the bandits.  While the boy was relating this, Bushnell was closely studying the guide's face, as revealed by the firelight. Frank noted that a strange look seemed to come into the eyes of the Westerner, and he appeared to be holding himself in check.  When this explanation was finished, Bushnell asked:  \"And you are on your way ter Huejugilla el Alto with ther hope of rescuin' ther professor?\"  \"We are,\" replied Frank.  \"You pet my life,\" nodded Hans.  \"This is the guide who was recommended to you in Zacatecas?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You trust him fully?\"  \"We are obliged to do so.\"  \"Wa'al, boys, ef this yere critter can't take yer straight ter Pacheco, nobody kin.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Jest this!\" cried Bushnell, explosively; \"this yere Greaser galoot w'at yer calls Pedro is nobody but Ferez!\"  \"Who is Ferez?\"  \"He's Pacheco's lieutenant!\"  Frank uttered a cry of amazement and anger, wheeling quickly on the Mexican, his hand seeking the butt of a revolver.  But the dark-faced rascal seemed ready for such an exposure, for, with a yell of defiance, he dropped behind his horse, and the animal shot like a rocket from the firelight into the shadows which lay thick on the desert.  Bushnell opened up with a brace of revolvers, sending a dozen bullets whistling after the fellow, in less than as many seconds.  At the first shot, Hans Dunnerwust fell off his horse, striking on his back on the sand, where he lay, faintly gurgling:  \"Uf you don'd shood der odder vay, I vos a tead man!\"  \"Don't let him escape with a whole skin!\" shouted Frank, as he began to work a revolver, although he was blinded by the flashes from Bushnell's weapon so that he was forced to shoot by guess.  Ferez seemed to bear a charmed life, for he fled straight on into the night, sending back a mocking shout of laughter. From far out on the waste, he cried:  \"Bah, Gringo dogs! You cannot harm me! I will see you again, _Americanoes_. This is not the last.\"  With an angry exclamation of disappointment and anger, Bushnell flung his empty revolvers on the sand at his feet.  \"Dern me fer a fool!\" he roared. \"Ef I'd done my shootin' first an' my talkin' arterward, he wouldn't got away.\"  But Ferez had escaped, and they could only make the best of it.  When this was over and the excitement had subsided, they sat about the fire and discussed the situation. Frank then showed the golden image which Burk had given him, and explained how the dying man had told of the Silver Palace.  Bushnell listened quietly, a cloud on his face. At the conclusion of the story, he rose to his feet, saying:  \"Ef Jack Burk made you his heir, thet goes, an' I ain't kickin' none whatever. Old Jack didn't hev no relatives, so he hed a right to make any galoot his heir. But thar's goin' ter be plenty of worry fer anybody as tries ter reach ther Silver Palace. How'd you 'spect ter git 'crost ther chasm?\"  \"As yet, I have not taken that into consideration. The kidnaping of Professor Scotch has banished thoughts of everything else from my mind.\"  \"Wa'al, ef Jack Burk made you his heir, you're entitled ter your half of ther treasure, providin' you're ready ter stand your half of ther expenses ef we fail ter git thar.\"  \"You may depend on me so far as that is concerned.\"  \"Wa'al, then, you see I hev three hawses. One is fer me ter ride, another is ter kerry provisions, and ther third is ter tote ther balloon.\"  \"The balloon!\"  \"Thet's whatever. I hev another balloon with which ter cross thet thar chasm. It's ther only way ter git over. In crossin' ther balloon will be loaded with a ballast of sand; but when we come back, ther ballast will be pure gold!\"     CHAPTER IX.  THE PROFESSOR'S ESCAPE.   They did not expect to reach Huejugilla el Alto without being molested by bandits, for it was presumed that Pacheco's lieutenant would carry the word to his chief, and the desperadoes would lose no time in moving against them.  Knowing their danger, they were exceedingly cautious, traveling much by night, and keeping in concealment by day, and, to their surprise, the bandits made no descent upon them.  Huejugilla el Alto proved to be a wild and picturesque place. Being far from the line of railroad, it had not even felt the touch of Northern civilization, and the boys felt as if they had been transported back to the seventeenth century.  \"Hyar, lads,\" said Bushnell, \"yer will see a town thet's clean Greaser all ther way through, an' it's ten ter one thar ain't nary galoot besides ourselves in ther durned old place thet kin say a word of United States.\"  The Westerner could talk Spanish after a fashion, and that was about all the natives of Huejugilla el Alto were able to do, with the exception of the few whose blood was untainted, and who claimed to be aristocrats.  However, for all of their strange dialect and his imperfect Spanish, Bushnell succeeded in making himself understood, so they found lodgings at a low, rambling adobe building, which served as a hotel. They paid in advance for one day, and were well satisfied with the price, although Bushnell declared it was at least double ordinary rates.  \"We ain't likely ter be long in town before Ferez locates us an' comes arter his hawses. Ther derned bandits are bold enough 'long ther line of ther railroad, but they lay 'way over thet out hyar. Wuss then all, ther people of ther towns kinder stand in with ther pizen varmints.\"  \"Stand in with them--how?\"  \"Why, hide 'em when ther soldiers is arter 'em, an' don't bother 'em at any other time.\"  \"I presume they are afraid of the bandits, which explains why they do so.\"  \"Afeared? Wa'al, I'll allow as how they may be; but then thar's something of ther bandit in ev'ry blamed Greaser I ever clapped peepers on. They're onery, they are.\"  Frank had noted that almost all Westerners who mingled much with the people of Mexico held Spaniards and natives alike in contempt, calling them all \"Greasers.\" He could not understand this, for, as he had observed, the people of the country were exceedingly polite and chivalrous, treating strangers with the utmost courtesy, if courtesy were given in return. Rudeness seemed to shock and wound them, causing them to draw within themselves, as a turtle draws into its shell. Indeed, so polite were the people that Frank came to believe that a bandit who had decided to cut a man's throat and rob him would first beg a man's pardon for such rudeness, and then proceed about the job with the greatest skill, suavity, and gentleness.  Having settled at the hotel, Bushnell ordered a square meal, and, when it was served, they proceeded to satisfy the hunger which had grown upon them with their journey across the desert.  Bushnell also took care to look after the horses and equipments himself.  \"Ef Ferez calls fer his hawses, I don't want him ter git away with this yar balloon an' gas generator,\" said the Westerner, as he saw the articles mentioned were placed under lock and key. \"Ef we should lose them, it'd be all up with us so fur as gittin' ter ther Silver Palace is concerned.\"  Frank expected to hear something from Pacheco as soon as Huejugilla el Alto was reached, but he found no message awaiting him.  \"Poor professor!\" he said. \"I expect he has suffered untold torments since he was kidnaped.\"  \"Yah,\" nodded Hans. \"Uf Brofessor Scotch don'd peen britty sick uf dis vild life mit Mexico, you vos a liar.\"  That night they were sitting outside the hotel when they heard a great commotion at the southern end of the town.  \"Vot vos dot?\" gasped the Dutch boy, in alarm. \"Sounds like dere vos drouple aroundt dot logality.\"  \"That's right,\" agreed Frank, feeling for his revolvers; \"and it is coming this way as fast as it can.\"  \"Mebbe another revolution has broke out,\" observed Bushnell, lazily. \"Best git under kiver, an' let ther circus go by.\"  They could hear the clatter of horses' hoofs, the cracking of pistols, and a mingling of wild cries.  All at once Frank Merriwell became somewhat excited.  \"On my life, I believe I hear the voice of Professor Scotch!\" he shouted.  \"Yah!\" said Hans, \"I belief I hear dot, too!\"  \"They may be bringin' ther professor in,\" said Bushnell. \"Ef he's thar, we'll take an interest in ther case, you bet yer boots!\"  Into the hotel he dashed, and, in a moment, he returned with his Winchester.  Along the street came a horseman, clinging to the back of an unsaddled animal, closely pursued by at least twenty wild riders, some of whom were shooting at the legs of the fleeing horse, while one was whirling a lasso to make a cast that must bring the animal to a sudden halt.  \"Ten to one, the fugitive is the professor!\" shouted Frank, peering through the dusk.  \"Then, I reckon we'll hev ter chip in right hyar an' now,\" said Bushnell, calmly.  He flung the Winchester to his shoulder, and a spout of fire streamed from the muzzle in an instant.  The fellow who was whirling the lasso flung up his arm and plunged headlong from the horse's back to the dust of the street.  \"Professor! professor!\" shouted Frank. \"Stop--stop here!\"  \"Can't do it,\" came back the reply. \"The horse won't stop!\"  \"Jump off--fall off--get off some way!\"  \"All right! here goes!\"  In another moment Professor Scotch, for it really was that individual, flung himself from the back of the animal he had ridden, struck the ground, rolled over and over like a ball, and lay still within thirty feet of Frank, groaning dolefully.  In the meantime, Al Bushnell was working his Winchester in a manner that was simply amazing, for a steady stream of fire seemed to pour from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22424"],["title","Frank Merriwell Down South (#8)"],["body"," muzzle of the weapon, and the cracking of the weapon echoed through the streets of Huejugilla el Alto like the rattling fire from a line of infantry.  After that first shot Bushnell lowered the muzzle of his weapon, as, in most cases at short range, his motto was to \"shoot low,\" for he well knew more lead could be wasted by shooting too high than in any other manner.  In about three seconds he had thrown the pursuing bandits into the utmost confusion, for they had never before encountered such a reception in Huejugilla el Alto, and it was the last thing they had expected. With all possible haste, they reined about and took to flight, hearing the bullets whistling about them, or feeling their horses leap madly at the sting of lead or go plunging to the ground.  The inhabitants of the town had fled into their houses before the rush of the bandits, so there was little danger that any of Bushnell's bullets would reach innocent persons.  The confusion and rout of the bandits was brought about in a few seconds, and Bushnell was heard to mutter:  \"One white man is good fer a hundred onery Greasers any time! Ther derned skunks hain't got a blamed bit of sand!\"  Frank ran and lifted the fallen professor, flinging the man across his shoulder, and carrying him into the hotel.  Hans followed with frantic haste, and Bushnell came sauntering lazily in after the bandits had been routed and driven back.  \"Are you badly hurt, professor?\" asked Frank, anxiously.  \"I'm killed!\" groaned Scotch, dolefully. \"I'm shot full of holes, and every bone in my body is broken! Farewell, my boy! We'll meet in a better land, where there are no bandits to molest or make afraid.\"  \"Where are you shot?\"  \"Everywhere--all over! You can't touch me where I'm not shot! They fired more than four hundred bullets through me! I am so full of holes that I wonder you can see me at all!\"  Bushnell made a hasty examination of the professor, who lay on the floor, groaning faintly, his eyes closed.  \"Look hyar, pard,\" said the Westerner, roughly, \"ef you want ter pass in yer chips ye'll hev ter stand up an' let me put a few more holes in yer. I can't find a place whar you're touched by a bullet an' I'm blowed ef I 'low you broke a bone when ye tumbled from ther hawse.\"  The professor sat up with a sudden snap.  \"What's that?\" he cried. \"I'm not shot? I'm not all broke up? Is it possible? Can I believe you?\"  \"Yah,\" nodded Hans, gravely; \"I can belief me. You vas all righdt brofessor, und dot is sdraight.\"  \"Wow!\" shouted Scotch, bounding to his feet like a rubber ball. \"That's what I call great luck! Why, I thought I must be killed sure! I don't know how I escaped all those bullets. And then the fall! Providence must have been with me.\"  \"Vell, I don'd know apoudt dot pefore you come der town in,\" said Hans; \"but you vos alone mit yourself when we saw you, brofessor.\"  The landlord of the hotel came bustling up in a perfect tumult of terror, wringing his hands and almost weeping.  \"Oh, señors!\" he cried, in Spanish, \"what have you done? You have ruined me! You stopped at my house, and you shoot the ladrones. Ah, señors, you know not what that means to me. Pacheco will come down on me--he will raid my house; I am a ruined man, and you are responsible for it. You must leave my house without delay! If you remain here, the whole town will rise against me! All the people will know this must make Pacheco very angry, and they will know he must take revenge on the place. They will be angry with me because I allow it. Carramba! How could I help it? I could do nothing. It came, and it was all over before I know what was doing. Señors, you must have pity on me--you must leave my house immeditely.\"  Bushnell caught enough of this to translate it to the others.  \"Ther best thing we kin do is ter git out instanter,\" he said. \"Ef we wait, ther outlaws will watch every road out of ther town, an' we'll hev trouble in gittin' away.\"  \"Then let's get away immediately,\" fluttered the professor. \"If I fall into their hands again, I'm a dead man!\"  \"Yes, we will get out immediately,\" decided Frank; \"but we'll do it as secretly and silently as possible.\"  Bushnell nodded his satisfaction, and, thirty minutes later, the party was ready to move. They left the hotel by a back way, and, guided by the landlord, made their way along dark and narrow streets, creeping cautiously through the town till the outskirts were reached.  There Frank gave the landlord some money, and, after calling down blessings on their heads, he quickly slipped away and disappeared.  \"Now we'll hustle right along,\" said the Westerner. \"We'll put a good long stretch between ourselves an' Huejugilla el Alto before mornin'. We're off, bound straight inter ther mountains----\"  \"And straight for the Silver Palace,\" added Frank.     CHAPTER X.  THE STRANGER.   They were fortunate in getting away without being seen by any of the bandits, and at dawn they were well up into the mountains, where Bushnell found a secluded place for them to camp and rest, as rest was something of which they all sorely stood in need.  Bushnell prepared breakfast, and Frank insisted that Professor Scotch should explain how he escaped from Pacheco's gang.  \"Don't ask me,\" sighed the little man, fondling his red whiskers. \"I can't explain it--really I can't.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Well, you see, I don't know how I happened to do it. They forced me to write that letter against my will, two of them standing over me with drawn daggers while I was writing, and prodding me a bit whenever I refused to put down the words Pacheco ordered written.\"  \"Then Pacheco speaks English?\"  \"As well as I do.\"  \"What does he look like?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"He kept his face concealed with his serape quite up to his eyes.\"  \"Thar's a mystery about Pacheco,\" broke in Bushnell. \"No one seems ter know jest what ther varmint looks like.\"  \"Go on, professor,\" urged Frank; \"tell us just how you escaped.\"  \"I tell you I do not know myself. All I know is that they tied me to a horse, and brought me across a plain of burning sand, where I nearly perished for want of water, and was nearly sawed in two by the backbone of the horse I rode. I believed it was a case of gone goose with me. At last they camped in a wild spot, and I was so badly used up that I could scarcely eat or do anything but lay around and groan. They seemed to think there was no need of watching me very closely, and I noticed that I was alone sometimes. Then, feeling utterly reckless, I began to watch for a chance to sneak away. I didn't care if I were shot, or if I escaped and perished from hunger and thirst. I was bound to make the attempt. Last night I made it. A saddleless horse strayed along where I was, and I made a jump for the animal. Before they knew what I was doing, I was on the beast's back and yelling into its ears like a maniac. The horse scooted out of the camp, and I clung on. The bandits pursued me, and everything else is a haze till I heard Frank calling for me to jump off. I recognized his voice and fell off the horse, although I had not the least idea in the world where I was.\"  \"Wa'al,\" chuckled Bushnell, \"thet's w'at I call dead fool luck, beggin' yer pardon fer speakin' so open like, at which I means no harm whatever.\"  \"Oh, ye needn't beg my pardon,\" quickly said Professor Scotch. \"I don't want any credit for getting away. It wasn't a case of brains at all.\"  Breakfast was prepared, and they ate heartily, after which Frank, Hans, and the professor lay down to sleep, while Bushnell smoked a black pipe.  But even Bushnell was not made of iron, and the pipe soothed him to slumber, so the entire party slept, with no one to guard.  All at once, some hours later, they were awakened by an exclamation from Frank, who sat up and stared at the form of a stranger, the latter being quietly squatting in their midst, calmly puffing at a cigarette, while his poncho was wrapped about him to his hips.  Frank's exclamation awakened Bushnell like an electric shock, and, even as his eyes opened, his hand shot out, the fingers grasping the butt of a revolver that was pointed straight at the stranger.  \"Stiddy, thar!\" called the Westerner. \"I hev ther drop on yer, an' I'll sock yer full of lead ef yer wiggle a toenail! You hear me chirp!\"  The stranger continued smoking, his coal-black eyes being the only part of him to move, for all of the threatening revolver.  Hans sat up, gasping:  \"Shimminy Gristmas! Der pandits haf caught us alretty soon!\"  At this Professor Scotch gave a groan of dismay, faintly gurgling:  \"Then I'm a goner!\"  That the stranger was a half-blood could be seen at a glance.  \"Drap thet cigaroot, an' give an account of yerself instanter right off!\" ordered Bushnell, threateningly. \"Who in blazes be yer?\"  The cigarette fell from the man's lips, and he answered:  \"I am Rodeo.\"  \"Wa'al, who is Rodeo?\"  \"The brother of Pacheco.\"  \"Don't I toldt you dot!\" panted the Dutch boy.  Professor Scotch groaned again, and rolled a little farther from the half-blood, but still made no effort to sit up.  \"Wa'al, dern your skin!\" cried Bushnell. \"You've got a nerve to come hyar! I s'pose Pacheco an' his gang of onery varmints is within whoopin' distance?\"  \"I am alone; there is no one within call.\"  \"Wa'al, w'at be yer hyar fer, thet's what I wants ter know?\"  \"I found you asleep, and I came to warn you.\"  \"Of what?\"  \"Danger. The ladrones are on your trail already. Before the sun sinks behind the mountains they will be here. If you are not gone, you must all fall into their hands.\"  Bushnell looked doubtful and suspicious, while a puzzled expression came into his bronzed face.  \"Look hyar,\" he said; \"you're up ter some game, an' I'm derned ef I know what she am, but yer wants ter understand yer can't monkey with this old coon none whatever. I hold the drop on yer, Old Socks, an' I may take a fancy ter bore yer once jest fer fun, so ye'd best talk straight an' squar', an' be lively about it.\"  \""]]]
