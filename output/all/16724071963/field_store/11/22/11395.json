But part of the contents of Chapter X (_Origin_) occurs in Chapter VI (1844) on Geographical Distribution. The treatment of distribution is particularly full and interesting in the 1844 Essay, but the arrangement of the material, especially the introduction of § III. p. 183, leads to some repetition which is avoided in the _Origin_. It should be noted that Hybridism, which has a separate chapter (VIII) in the _Origin_, is treated in Chapter II of the Essay. Finally that Chapter XIII (_Origin_) corresponds to Chapters VII, VIII and IX of the work of 1844.  The fact that in 1842, seventeen years before the publication of the _Origin_, my father should have been able to write out so full an outline of his future work, is very remarkable. In his Autobiography{25} he writes of the 1844 Essay, \"But at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance.... This problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become modified.\" The absence of the principle of divergence is of course also a characteristic of the sketch of 1842. But at p. 37, the author is not far from this point of view. The passage referred to is: \"If any species, _A_, in changing gets an advantage and that advantage ... is inherited, _A_ will be the progenitor of several genera or even families in the hard struggle of nature. _A_ will go on beating out other forms, it might come that _A_ would people <the> earth,--we may now not have one descendant on our globe of the one or several original creations{26}.\" But if the descendants of _A_ have peopled the earth by beating out other forms, they must have diverged in occupying the innumerable diverse modes of life from which they expelled their predecessors. What I wrote{27} on this subject in 1887 is I think true: \"Descent with modification implies divergence, and we become so habituated to a belief in descent, and therefore in divergence, that we do not notice the absence of proof that divergence is in itself an advantage.\"       {25} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.       {26} In the footnotes to the Essay of 1844 attention is called to      similar passages.       {27} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 15.  The fact that there is no set discussion on the principle of divergence in the 1844 Essay, makes it clear why the joint paper read before the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858, included a letter{28} to Asa Gray, as well as an extract{29} from the Essay of 1844. It is clearly because the letter to Gray includes a discussion on divergence, and was thus, probably, the only document, including this subject, which could be appropriately made use of. It shows once more how great was the importance attached by its author to the principle of divergence.       {28} The passage is given in the _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 124.       {29} The extract consists of the section on _Natural Means of      Selection_, p. 87.  I have spoken of the hurried and condensed manner in which the sketch of 1842 is written; the style of the later Essay (1844) is more finished. It has, however, the air of an uncorrected MS. rather than of a book which has gone through the ordeal of proof sheets. It has not all the force and conciseness of the _Origin_, but it has a certain freshness which gives it a character of its own. It must be remembered that the _Origin_ was an abstract or condensation of a much bigger book, whereas the Essay of 1844 was an expansion of the sketch of 1842. It is not therefore surprising that in the _Origin_ there is occasionally evident a chafing against the author's self-imposed limitation. Whereas in the 1844 Essay there is an air of freedom, as if the author were letting himself go, rather than applying the curb. This quality of freshness and the fact that some questions were more fully discussed in 1844 than in 1859, makes the earlier work good reading even to those who are familiar with the _Origin_.  The writing of this Essay \"during the summer of 1844,\" as stated in the Autobiography{30}, and \"from memory,\" as Darwin says elsewhere{31}, was a remarkable achievement, and possibly renders more conceivable the still greater feat of the writing of the _Origin_ between July 1858 and September 1859.       {30} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.       {31} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 18.  It is an interesting subject for speculation: what influence on the world the Essay of 1844 would have exercised, had it been published in place of the Origin. The author evidently thought of its publication in its present state as an undesirable expedient, as appears clearly from the following extracts from the _Life and Letters_, vol. ii. pp. 16--18:  _C. Darwin to Mrs Darwin._  DOWN, _July 5, 1844_.  \"... I have just finished my sketch of my species theory. If, as I believe, my theory in time be accepted even by one competent judge, it will be a considerable step in science.  \"I therefore write this in case of my sudden death, as my most solemn and last request, which I am sure you will consider the same as if legally entered in my will, that you will devote £400 to its publication, and further will yourself, or through Hensleigh{32}, take trouble in promoting it. I wish that my sketch be given to some competent person, with this sum to induce him to take trouble in its improvement and enlargement. I give to him all my books on Natural History, which are either scored or have references at the end to the pages, begging him carefully to look over and consider such passages as actually bearing, or by possibility bearing, on this subject. I wish you to make a list of all such books as some temptation to an editor. I also request that you will hand over <to> him all those scraps roughly divided into eight or ten brown paper portfolios. The scraps, with copied quotations from various works, are those which may aid my editor. I also request that you, or some amanuensis, will aid in deciphering any of the scraps which the editor may think possibly of use. I leave to the editor's judgment whether to interpolate these facts in the text, or as notes, or under appendices. As the looking over the references and scraps will be a long labour, and as the _correcting_ and enlarging and altering my sketch will also take considerable time, I leave this sum of £400 as some remuneration, and any profits from the work. I consider that for this the editor is bound to get the sketch published either at a publisher's or his own risk. Many of the scraps in the portfolios contain mere rude suggestions and early views, now useless, and many of the facts will probably turn out as having no bearing on my theory.       {32} Mrs Darwin's brother.  \"With respect to editors, Mr Lyell would be the best if he would undertake it; I believe he would find the work pleasant, and he would learn some facts new to him. As the editor must be a geologist as well as a naturalist, the next best editor would be Professor Forbes of London. The next best (and quite best in many respects) would be Professor Henslow. Dr Hooker would be _very_ good. The next, Mr Strickland{33}. If none of these would undertake it, I would request you to consult with Mr Lyell, or some other capable man, for some editor, a geologist and naturalist. Should one other hundred pounds make the difference of procuring a good editor, I request earnestly that you will raise £500.       {33} After Mr Strickland's name comes the following sentence, which      has been erased, but remains legible. \"Professor Owen would be very      good; but I presume he would not undertake such a work.\"  \"My remaining collections in Natural History may be given to any one or any museum where <they> would be accepted....\"  <The following note seems to have formed part of the original letter, but may have been of later date:>  \"Lyell, especially with the aid of Hooker (and of any good zoological aid), would be best of all. Without an editor will pledge himself to give up time to it, it would be of no use paying such a sum.  \"If there should be any difficulty in getting an editor who would go thoroughly into the subject, and think of the bearing of the passages marked in the books and copied out of scraps of paper, then let my sketch be published as it is, stating that it was done several years ago{34}, and from memory without consulting any works, and with no intention of publication in its present form.\"       {34} The words \"several years ago, and\" seem to have been added at      a later date.  The idea that the sketch of 1844 might remain, in the event of his death, as the only record of his work, seems to have been long in his mind, for in August, 1854, when he had finished with the Cirripedes, and was thinking of beginning his \"species work,\" he added on the back of the above letter, \"Hooker by far best man to edit my species volume. August 1854.\"  I have called attention in footnotes to many points in which the _Origin_ agrees with the _Foundations_. One of the most interesting is the final sentence, practically the same in the Essays of 1842 and 1844, and almost identical with the concluding words of the _Origin_. I have elsewhere pointed out{35} that the ancestry of this eloquent passage may be traced one stage further back,--to the Note Book of 1837. I have given this sentence as an appropriate motto for the _Foundations_ in its character of a study of general laws. It will be remembered that a corresponding motto from Whewell's _Bridgewater Treatise_ is printed opposite the title-page of the _Origin of Species_.       {35} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 9.  Mr Huxley who, about the year 1887, read the Essay of 1844, remarked that \"much more weight is attached to the influence of external conditions in producing variation and to the inheritance of acquired habits than in the _Origin_.\" In the _Foundations_ the effect of conditions is frequently mentioned, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],["title","The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#4)"],["body","seems to have had constantly in mind the need of referring each variation to a cause. But I gain the impression that the slighter prominence given to this view in the _Origin_ was not due to change of opinion, but rather because he had gradually come to take this view for granted; so that in the scheme of that book, it was overshadowed by considerations which then seemed to him more pressing. With regard to the inheritance of acquired characters I am not inclined to agree with Huxley. It is certain that the _Foundations_ contains strong recognition of the importance of germinal variation, that is of external conditions acting indirectly through the \"reproductive functions.\" He evidently considered this as more important than the inheritance of habit or other acquired peculiarities.  Another point of interest is the weight he attached in 1842-4 to \"sports\" or what are now called \"mutations.\" This is I think more prominent in the _Foundations_ than in the first edition of the _Origin_, and certainly than in the fifth and sixth editions.  Among other interesting points may be mentioned the \"good effects of crossing\" being \"possibly analogous to good effects of change in condition,\"--a principle which he upheld on experimental grounds in his _Cross and Self-Fertilisation_ in 1876.  In conclusion, I desire to express my thanks to Mr Wallace for a footnote he was good enough to supply: and to Professor Bateson, Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer, Dr Gadow, Professor Judd, Dr Marr, Col. Prain and Dr Stapf for information on various points. I am also indebted to Mr Rutherford, of the University Library, for his careful copy of the manuscript of 1842.

PART I.   § I. <ON VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION, AND ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SELECTION.>  An individual organism placed under new conditions [often] sometimes varies in a small degree and in very trifling respects such as stature, fatness, sometimes colour, health, habits in animals and probably disposition. Also habits of life develope certain parts. Disuse atrophies. [Most of these slight variations tend to become hereditary.]  When the individual is multiplied for long periods by buds the variation is yet small, though greater and occasionally a single bud or individual departs widely from its type (example){36} and continues steadily to propagate, by buds, such new kind.       {36} Evidently a memorandum that an example should be given.  When the organism is bred for several generations under new or varying conditions, the variation is greater in amount and endless in kind [especially{37} holds good when individuals have long been exposed to new conditions]. The nature of the external conditions tends to effect some definite change in all or greater part of offspring,--little food, small size--certain foods harmless &c. &c. organs affected and diseases--extent unknown. A certain degree of variation (Müller's twins){38} seems inevitable effect of process of reproduction. But more important is that simple <?> generation, especially under new conditions [when no crossing] <causes> infinite variation and not direct effect of external conditions, but only in as much as it affects the reproductive functions{39}. There seems to be no part (_beau ideal_ of liver){40} of body, internal or external, or mind or habits, or instincts which does not vary in some small degree and [often] some <?> to a great amount.       {37} The importance of exposure to new conditions for several      generations is insisted on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 7, also p.      131. In the latter passage the author guards himself against the      assumption that variations are \"due to chance,\" and speaks of \"our      ignorance of the cause of each particular variation.\" These      statements are not always remembered by his critics.       {38} Cf. _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 10, vi. p. 9, \"Young of the same      litter, sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both      the young and the parents, as Müller has remarked, have apparently      been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life.\"       {39} This is paralleled by the conclusion in the _Origin_, Ed. i.      p. 8, that \"the most frequent cause of variability may be      attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been      affected prior to the act of conception.\"       {40} The meaning seems to be that there must be some variability in      the liver otherwise anatomists would not speak of the 'beau ideal'      of that organ.  [All such] variations [being congenital] or those very slowly acquired of all kinds [decidedly evince a tendency to become hereditary], when not so become simple variety, when it does a race. Each{41} parent transmits its peculiarities, therefore if varieties allowed freely to cross, except by the _chance_ of two characterized by same peculiarity happening to marry, such varieties will be constantly demolished{42}. All bisexual animals must cross, hermaphrodite plants do cross, it seems very possible that hermaphrodite animals do cross,--conclusion strengthened: ill effects of breeding in and in, good effects of crossing possibly analogous to good effects of change in condition <?>{43}.       {41} The position of the following passage is uncertain. \"If      individuals of two widely different varieties be allowed to cross,      a third race will be formed--a most fertile source of the variation      in domesticated animals. <In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 20 the author      says that \"the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has      been greatly exaggerated.\"> If freely allowed, the characters of      pure parents will be lost, number of races thus <illegible> but      differences <?> besides the <illegible>. But if varieties differing      in very slight respects be allowed to cross, such small variation      will be destroyed, at least to our senses,--a variation [clearly]      just to be distinguished by long legs will have offspring not to be      so distinguished. Free crossing great agent in producing uniformity      in any breed. Introduce tendency to revert to parent form.\"       {42} The swamping effect of intercrossing is referred to in the      _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 103, vi. p. 126.       {43} A discussion on the intercrossing of hermaphrodites in      relation to Knight's views occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 96,      vi. p. 119. The parallelism between crossing and changed conditions      is briefly given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 267, vi. p. 391, and      was finally investigated in _The Effects of Cross and      Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom_, 1876.  Therefore if in any country or district all animals of one species be allowed freely to cross, any small tendency in them to vary will be constantly counteracted. Secondly reversion to parent form--analogue of _vis medicatrix_{44}. But if man selects, then new races rapidly formed,--of late years systematically followed,--in most ancient times often practically followed{45}. By such selection make race-horse, dray-horse--one cow good for tallow, another for eating &c.--one plant's good lay <illegible> in leaves another in fruit &c. &c.: the same plant to supply his wants at different times of year. By former means animals become adapted, as a direct effect to a cause, to external conditions, as size of body to amount of food. By this latter means they may also be so adapted, but further they may be adapted to ends and pursuits, which by no possibility can affect growth, as existence of tallow-chandler cannot tend to make fat. In such selected races, if not removed to new conditions, and <if> preserved from all cross, after several generations become very true, like each other and not varying. But man{46} selects only <?> what is useful and curious--has bad judgment, is capricious,--grudges to destroy those that do not come up to his pattern,--has no [knowledge] power of selecting according to internal variations,--can hardly keep his conditions uniform,--[cannot] does not select those best adapted to the conditions under which <the> form <?> lives, but those most useful to him. This might all be otherwise.       {44} There is an article on the _vis medicatrix_ in Brougham's      _Dissertations_, 1839, a copy of which is in the author's library.       {45} This is the classification of selection into methodical and      unconscious given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 33, vi. p. 38.       {46} This passage, and a similar discussion on the power of the      Creator (p. 6), correspond to the comparison between the selective      capacities of man and nature, in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 83, vi. p.      102.   § II. <ON VARIATION IN A STATE OF NATURE AND ON THE NATURAL MEANS OF SELECTION.>  Let us see how far above principles of variation apply to wild animals. Wild animals vary exceedingly little--yet they are known as individuals{47}. British Plants, in many genera number quite uncertain of varieties and species: in shells chiefly external conditions{48}. Primrose and cowslip. Wild animals from different [countries can be recognized]. Specific character gives some organs as varying. Variations analogous in kind, but less in degree with domesticated animals--chiefly external and less important parts.       {47} i.e. they are individually distinguishable.       {48} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 133, vi. p. 165.  Our experience would lead us to expect that any and every one of these organisms would vary if <the organism were> taken away <?> and placed under new conditions. Geology proclaims a constant round of change, bringing into play, by every possible <?> change of climate and the death of pre-existing inhabitants, endless variations of new conditions. These <?> generally very slow, doubtful though <illegible>"]]]
