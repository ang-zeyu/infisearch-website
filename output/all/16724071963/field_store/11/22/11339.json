But neither Tom nor his father dreamed of Squire Hudson's secret animosity, and regarded his willingness to advance the extra two hundred dollars as an evidence of friendship.  But I have said that Tom took account of stock--in other words, ascertained how much he was worth. First, then, of the money borrowed for his trip--the original two hundred dollars--he had twenty-five dollars left over. Besides this sum, after paying all expenses, he had accumulated, by hard work and strict economy, fifty dollars' worth of gold-dust.  \"I wish father had this money,\" said Tom to his tent-mate, Ferguson. \"I am afraid he stands in need of it.\"  \"There may be a way to send it to him, Tom.\"  \"I wish there were.\"  \"There's one of our party going to San Francisco next week. He can buy a draft there, and send it to your father.\"  \"Who is going?\" asked Tom, eagerly.  \"John Miles. You can trust him with the money, Tom.\"  \"Of course I can. I'd trust John Miles with any sum.\"  \"Who's that taking liberties with my name?\" asked a manly voice, and John Miles himself stepped into the tent, bending his head as he entered.  \"I hear you are going to San Francisco, John?\"  \"Yes, I start next week.\"  \"Will you come back again?\"  \"I intend to. I am going to prospect a little, and buy some things for myself and Captain Fletcher.\"  \"Will you do me a favor?\"  \"Of course I will, if it isn't too large a one,\" answered Miles.  Tom explained what he wished, and John Miles cordially assented.  \"You're a good boy, Tom,\" he said, \"to think of your father so soon.\"  \"I feel anxious about him,\" said Tom. \"He raised money to send me out here, and I don't want him to suffer for it.\"  \"That's the right way to feel, Tom. I wish I had a father and mother to look out for,\" said Miles, soberly, \"but you're in better luck than I. Both died when I was a mere lad. How much do you want to send?\"  \"Seventy-five dollars.\"  \"Have you saved up so much already?\" asked Miles, in surprise.  \"Part of it I had left over when I got here.\"  \"Will you have any left?\"  \"No.\"  \"Isn't it well to reserve a little, then?\"  \"Oh, I shall have some more soon,\" answered Tom, sanguine, as most boys are.  \"Suppose you are sick?\"  \"If he is sick he shall suffer for nothing,\" said the Scotchman. \"While I have money, Tom shall not feel the want of it.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Ferguson,\" said Tom, gratefully.  \"That old fellow has a heart, after all,\" thought Miles, who had been disposed to look upon Ferguson ever since their first acquaintance, as rather miserly.  The Scotchman was certainly frugal, and counted his pennies carefully, but he was not mean, and had conceived a strong affection for his young companion, whom he regarded much as a son or a nephew.  \"Suppose you take the money now, John,\" said Tom.  \"Shall I scribble a receipt, Tom? I am afraid my writing materials have given out.\"  \"I don't want any receipt,\" said Tom; \"I'll trust you without one.\"  \"Nevertheless, lad,\" said the cautious Scotchman, \"it may be well--\"  \"Yes, Tom, Mr. Ferguson is right. Of course I know that you trust me; but if anything should happen to me,--any accident, I mean,--the paper may be useful to you.\"  \"Just as you like, Mr. Miles, but I don't ask it, remember that.\"  \"Yes, I will remember it, and I don't mean to meet with any accident if I can help it. Mr. Ferguson, can you oblige me with a pipeful of tobacco? I'll join you in smoking.\"  Smoking was the Scotchman's solitary extravagance, not a costly one, however, as he never smoked cigars, but indulged only in a democratic clay pipe.  John Miles threw himself on the ground between Tom and his Scotch friend, and watched complacently the wreaths of smoke as they curled upwards.  \"Tom, you ought to smoke,\" he said. \"You don't know how much enjoyment you lose.\"  \"Don't tempt the lad,\" said Ferguson. \"It's a bad habit.\"  \"You smoke yourself.\"  \"That is true, but it isn't well for a growing boy. It can do him no good.\"  \"I smoked before I was as old as Tom.\"  \"So did I, but I wish I had not.\"  \"Well, perhaps you're right, but it's a comfort when a man's tired or out of spirits.\"  \"I am not troubled in that way,\" said Tom. \"I mean with being out of spirits.\"  \"Youth is a hopeful age,\" said the Scotchman. \"When we are young we are always hoping for something good to befall us.\"  \"And when one is older, how is it, Mr. Ferguson?\"  \"We fear ill more than we hope for good,\" he replied.  \"Then I want to remain young as long as I can.\"  \"A good wish, Tom. Some men are always young in spirit; but those that have seen the evil there is in the world find it harder to be hopeful.\"  \"You speak as if you had had experience of the evil, Mr. Ferguson.\"  \"So I have,\" answered the Scotchman slowly. Then, after a pause, \"I will tell you about it: it's no secret.\"  \"Not if it is going to pain you.\"  \"Oh, the pain is past. It's only a matter of money, and those wounds heal.\"  \"Only a matter of money!\" said John Miles to himself. \"I must have misjudged Ferguson. I thought money was all in all with him. I did not think he would speak so lightly of it.\"  \"When I was a young man,\" Ferguson began, \"my father died, leaving me a thousand pounds, and a small annuity to my mother. With this money I felt rich, but I knew it would not support me, nor was I minded to be idle. So I began to look about me, to consider what business I had best go into, when a young man, about my own age, a clerk in a mercantile house, came to me and proposed a partnership. He was to put in five hundred pounds, and contribute his knowledge of business, which was greater than mine. He was a young man of good parts, and had a brisk, pleasant way with him, that made him a favorite in business circles. I thought it was a good chance, and, after taking a little time for thought, agreed to his proposal. So the firm of McIntire and Ferguson was formed. We went into business, and for a time all seemed to go well. As my partner chose to keep the books, I was not so clear as I wished to be about matters, but we seemed to be prospering. One morning, however, on coming to business, I found that my partner had disappeared, after possessing himself of all the money he could collect on the credit of the firm. Of course we were bankrupts, or rather I was, for he left me to bear the brunt of failure.\"  \"Have you ever seen him since, Mr. Ferguson?\"  \"From that day to this--twenty years--I have never set eyes on Sandy McIntire.\"  \"It was a mean trick to serve you, Ferguson,\" said Miles.  \"Yes,\" said the Scotchman, soberly. \"I minded the loss of money, but the loss of confidence was a sore thought too, after all the trust I had put in that man.\"  Presently Miles rose to go.  \"I'll take care of your money, Tom,\" he said, \"and do my best to get it safely to your father.\"  \"Thank you, John.\"  As Miles left the tent, he did not observe a crouching figure on the other side of it. It was the figure of Bill Crane, a crony of Missouri Jack, in fact, the man who helped him to fleece poor Peabody of his scanty hoard.  Bill looked after Miles enviously.  \"I wonder how much money he's got?\" thought Bill. \"I'd like some of it, for I'm bust. I must tell Jack. I don't dare to tackle him alone.\"     CHAPTER IV.  A FOILED ROBBER.   In the grand rush to the newly discovered gold-fields all classes were represented. There were men of education, representatives of all the learned professions, men versed in business, and along with them adventurers and men of doubtful antecedents, graduates of prisons and penitentiaries. Bill Crane, introduced in the last chapter, belonged to the latter undesirable class. He had served a term at Sing-Sing as a housebreaker, and later another term in a Western penitentiary. He had come to California with a prejudice against honest labor, and a determination to make a living by the use of the peculiar talents on which he had hitherto relied. He had spent a week at River Bend, chiefly at the saloon of Missouri Jack, whom he found a congenial spirit, and had picked up a little money from flats like the young Bostonian; but, on the whole, he had found it an unprofitable field for the exercise of his special talents.  \"I must make a raise somehow,\" he bethought himself, \"and then I'll make tracks for some other settlement.\"  Precisely how to raise the fund of which he stood in need was difficult to decide. Moneyed men were not plenty at River Bend. Captain Fletcher and his party had been at work but a short time, and were not likely to have collected much.  As we know, Bill Crane overheard a part of the closing conversation between Tom and John Miles. From this he learned that Miles, besides his own money, would be in charge of seventy-five dollars belonging to our young hero. It was not much, but it was something.  \"If the whole doesn't come to over two hundred dollars, I can make it do,\" thought Crane. \"It will get me out of this beastly hole, and carry me to San Francisco.\"  John Miles slept by himself under a small tent at the northern end of the small encampment. He looked like a man who ate well and slept well, and this would be favorable to Bill Crane, who proposed to effect the robbery in the night. He had half a mind to secure the aid of Missouri Jack, but then Jack would expect to go shares in the \"plunder,\" and there was likely to be little enough for one. So Bill decided to make the attempt alone.  In a small camp like that at River Bend, the movements and plans of each individual were generally known. So it was generally understood that John Miles intended to start on Thursday for the city.  The previous evening he spent with Tom and Ferguson, with whom he was more intimate than any others of the party. He would not have been drawn to the Scotchman, but for his being Tom's room-mate. Through him he came to appreciate and respect the Scot's sterling virtues,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22669"],["title","The Young Miner; Or, Tom Nelson in California (#3)"],["body","to overlook his dry, phlegmatic manner.  \"I hope you'll have good luck, Mr. Miles,\" said Tom.  \"Thank you, my boy.\"  \"I would join with my young friend Tom,\" said Ferguson, \"if I were quite clear in my mind whether good luck is the right term to use.\"  \"Don't you think some men are luckier than others, Mr. Ferguson?\" asked Tom.  \"Some men are more successful, doubtless; but what we call good luck, generally comes from greater industry, good judgment, and, above all, the prompt use of opportunities.\"  \"There is something in that,\" said Miles; \"but when two men work side by side with equal industry, and one finds a nugget worth thousands of dollars, while the other plods along at a few dollars a day, isn't there some luck there?\"  \"It may be so,\" said the Scotchman, cautiously, \"but such cases are exceptional.\"  \"So one boy is born to an inheritance of wealth and another to an inheritance of hard work. Isn't there any luck there?\"  \"The luck may be on the side of the poor boy,\" was the reply. \"He is further removed from temptation.\"  John Miles laughed.  \"Well, at any rate, it seems you believe in luck after all. I am sure you both wish me to be prosperous, whether you call it luck or by some other name. Tom, if I meet with any good opening that I think will suit you, I shall write you. You don't want to stay here, particularly?\"  \"No; the place is not so pleasant since these new people have come here. Missouri Jack isn't a neighbor that I like.\"  \"He is exerting a bad influence,\" said Ferguson. \"I am afraid Peabody visits him too often for his own good.\"  \"He ought to have stayed in Boston,\" said Miles. \"He is not the man for such a life as ours. He is too delicate to work, or thinks he is, and I see no other reliable road to success.\"  \"I saw Peabody reeling out of the saloon this afternoon,\" said Tom. \"I asked him if he considered it was 'high-toned' to drink in a saloon, as that is the word he is always using, but he said it didn't make much difference out here, where he wasn't known.\"  \"Peabody isn't overstocked with brains, though he does come from Boston,\" said Miles.  Ten o'clock came, and Miles rose to go.  \"I must have a good night's rest,\" he said, \"for to-morrow night must see me many miles on my road. Tom, I will attend to that commission of yours just as soon as I have the opportunity.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Miles.\"  John Miles walked slowly toward his tent. Arrived there, he threw himself down on his rude couch, and in less than fifteen minutes, he was sound asleep. He had done his usual day's work, and made some preparations for his journey besides, and these made slumber sweet and refreshing.  Before settling himself for the night, however, Miles carefully deposited a bag of gold-dust under his head, wrapped up in an extra pair of pantaloons. Had he known that Bill Crane had formed a plan to rob him that very night, he would have taken extra precautions, but he was not inclined to be suspicious, or to anticipate danger.  Perhaps an hour later, Tom, who found himself unusually restless, got up from his hard couch, leaving Ferguson fast asleep, and went out into the air, thinking that a walk would do him good and dispose him to sleep. The night was dark, but not wholly so. There was no moon, but a few stars were shining; and as his eyes became accustomed to the faint light, he could easily distinguish objects at the distance of a few rods.  Tom's thoughts reverted to his humble home, more than three thousand miles away. Probably the fact that he had committed to John Miles a sum of money to send to his father, had turned his thoughts in that direction.  \"Father will be glad to get the seventy-five dollars,\" thought Tom, \"and I am sure he will need it. I wish it could get there more quickly, but it is a long way off.\"  Tom was not homesick, and was far from wishing himself back, with his object in coming yet unaccomplished, but it did occur to him, that he would like to see his father and mother, and brothers and sisters, if only for a few minutes.  When he came out he had no particular direction in mind in which he wished to walk, but chance directed his steps toward the tent of his friend, John Miles.  When he came near it, his attention was arrested by the sight of a crouching figure which appeared to be entering the tent. His first thought was, that Miles, like himself, had got up from his couch and was just returning. He was on the point of calling out \"John,\" when a sudden doubt and suspicion silenced him.--\"Might not it be a robber?\"  Tom was determined to find out. He crept nearer, so that he could have a clearer view of the figure.  \"It's Bill Crane!\" he said to himself, with sudden recognition. \"What's he up to?\"  Tom could guess. He didn't know the man's antecedents, but he had read his character aright. He was instantly on the alert. Crane evidently was on a thief's errand, and was likely to steal not only Miles's money but Tom's. Our hero was alive to the emergency, and resolved to foil him. He had his revolver with him; for in the unsettled state of society, with no one to enforce the laws, and indeed no laws to enforce, it was the custom for all men to go armed.  Tom was not long left in doubt as to Crane's intentions. He saw him cautiously pulling at something in the tent, and felt sure that it was the bag of treasure. He decided that the time had come to act.  \"Put that back,\" he exclaimed in boyish, but clear, commanding tone.  Bill Crane turned suddenly, panic-stricken.  He saw Tom standing a few feet from him, with a revolver in his hand.  All was not lost. He might, he thought, intimidate the boy.  \"Mind your business, you young cub,\" he growled.  \"What are you about?\" demanded Tom.  \"I am going to sleep with Miles. He invited me. Does that satisfy you?\"  \"No, it doesn't, for I know that it's a lie. You are here to rob him.\"  \"You'd better not insult me, boy, or I'll have your life.\"  \"Get up this instant and leave the tent, or I'll fire,\" said Tom, resolutely.  \"A young cub like you can't frighten me. That shooting-iron of yours isn't loaded,\" said Bill Crane, rather uneasily.  \"It'll be rather a bad thing for you to take the risk,\" said Tom, with a coolness that surprised himself, for the situation was a strange one for a boy brought up in a quiet New England farming town.  \"What do you want of me?\" growled the desperado, uncomfortably, for he was satisfied that the weapon was loaded, and Tom looked as if he would shoot.  \"I want you to leave that tent at once,\" said Tom.  \"Suppose I don't.\"  \"Then I shall fire at you.\"  \"And be hung for attempted murder.\"  \"I think I could explain it,\" said our hero. \"You know very well what will happen to you if you are caught.\"  Bill Crane did know. Hanging was the penalty for theft in the early days of California, and he had no desire to swing from the branch of a tree.  \"You're a young fool!\" he said roughly, as he rose from his stooping posture. \"I wanted to ask Miles to do a little commission for me in Frisco. I had no thought of robbing him.\"  \"You can see him in the morning about it,\" said Tom, resolutely.  \"I'll be even with you for this,\" said the foiled thief, as he sullenly obeyed the boy, half-ashamed to do so.  Tom went back to his tent, aroused Ferguson, and the two took turns in guarding the tent of Miles during the night. Tom did not wish to awaken him, for he needed rest on the eve of a long and fatiguing journey.     CHAPTER V.  MILES SETS OUT ON HIS JOURNEY.   \"When Miles woke up in the morning he found Tom beside him.  \"Hallo, Tom!\" he said, in some surprise. \"This is an early call.\"  \"I have been here half the night,\" said Tom, quietly.  \"How is that?\"  \"I was afraid you would be robbed.\"  \"Did you have any particular reason for fearing it?\" asked Miles, quickly.  Thereupon Tom described his chance visit of the evening before, and what he saw. As might have been expected, John Miles was indignant.  \"The miserable sneak! I'd like to wring his neck,\" he exclaimed. \"Did you say he had his hand upon the bag of gold-dust, Tom?\"  \"Yes; I distinctly saw him attempting to draw it out from under your head.\"  \"If the boys knew of this, Crane's fate would be sealed. A thief in a mining camp has a short shrift.\"  \"You mean he would be hung?\" asked Tom, in surprise.  \"Yes, he would grace a limb of yonder tree, and I am not sure but it would be the best way to dispose of him.\"  Tom shuddered.  \"It would be a terrible fate,\" he said. \"I should like to see him punished, but I don't want him hanged.\"  \"Then you will have to keep your mouth shut. Once let the boys get hold of what happened, and nothing will save him.\"  \"Then I shall keep it to myself.\"  \"I will see Crane, and let him understand that I am aware of the attempt he made,\" said Miles.  After breakfast he came upon Crane within a few rods of Missouri Jack's saloon.  \"Look here, Bill Crane,\" said Miles, \"I've got something to say to you.\"  \"What is it?\" returned Crane, sullenly, looking ill at ease.  \"I understand you favored me with a visit, last night.\"  \"Who told you so?\"  \"Tom Nelson.\"  \"The young cub had better mind his own business,\" growled Crane, in a menacing tone.  \"He did me a service in preventing your intended theft.\"  \"If he says I meant to rob you, he lies!\"  \"Nevertheless, if he should make public what he saw, the boys would be likely to believe him rather than you,\" said Miles, significantly.  \"Is he going to tell?\" asked Crane, nervously.  \"He has told me, but is not likely to speak of it to others, being unwilling that you should suffer the punishment you deserve.\"  \"He is very kind,\" sneered Bill Crane, but he felt very much relieved.  \"You probably owe your life to his kindness,\" said Miles, quietly. \"He tells me you wish me to do something for you in Frisco.\"  \"I've changed my mind,\" said Crane, abruptly; \"I may go there myself, soon.\"  Miles smiled.  \"I thought it might be something urgent,\" he said, \"since it led you to come to my tent at midnight.\"  \"I"]]]
