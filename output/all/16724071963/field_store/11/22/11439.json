It really didn't matter, anyhow. Symes was on his way into the temple, and Forrester could just ignore him.  But, damn it, why did he let the young idiot get his goat that way? Didn't he have enough self-control just to ignore Symes and his oafish insults?  Forrester supposed sadly that he didn't. Oh, well, it just made another quality he had to pray to Athena for.  Then he glanced at his wristwatch and stopped thinking about Symes entirely.  It was twelve-forty-five. He had to be at work at thirteen hundred.  Still angry, underneath the sudden need for speed, he turned and sprinted toward the subway.         *       *       *       *       *  \"And thus,\" Forrester said tiredly, \"having attempted to make himself the equal of the Gods, Man was given a punishment befitting such arrogance.\" He paused and took a breath, surveying the twenty-odd students in the classroom (and some, he told himself wryly, _very_ odd) with a sort of benign boredom.  History I, Introductory Survey of World History, was a simple enough course to teach, but its very simplicity was its undoing, Forrester thought. The deadly dullness of the day-after-day routine was enough to wear out the strongest soul.  Freshmen, too, seemed to get stupider every year. Certainly, when _he'd_ been seventeen, he'd been different altogether. Studious, earnest, questioning ...  Then he stopped himself and grinned. He'd probably seemed even worse to his own instructors.  Where had he been? Slowly, he picked up the thread. There was a young blonde girl watching him eagerly from a front seat. What was her name? Forrester tried to recall it and couldn't. Well, this was only the first day of term. He'd get to know them all soon enough--well enough, anyhow, to dislike most of them.  But the eager expression on the girl's face unnerved him a little. The rest of the class wasn't paying anything like such strict attention. As a matter of fact, Forrester suspected two young boys in the back of being in a trance.  Well, he could stop that. But ...  She was really quite attractive, Forrester told himself. Of course, she was nothing but a fresh, pretty, eager seventeen-year-old, with a figure that ...  She was, Forrester reminded himself sternly, a student.  And he was supposed to be an instructor.  He cleared his throat. \"Man went hog-wild with his new-found freedom from divine guidance,\" he said. \"Woman did, too, as a matter of fact.\"  Now what unholy devil had made him say that? It wasn't a part of the normal lecture for first day of the new term. It was--well, it was just a little risqu√© for students. Some of their parents might complain, and ...  But the girl in the front row was smiling appreciatively. _I wonder what she's doing in an Introductory course_, Forrester thought, leaping with no evidence at all to the conclusion that the girl's mind was much too fine and educated to be subjected to the general run of classes. _Private tutoring_ ... he began, and then cut himself off sharply, found his place in the lecture again and went on:  \"When the Gods decided to sit back and observe for a few thousand years, they allowed Man to go his merry way, just to teach him a lesson.\"  The boys in the back of the room were definitely in a trance.  Forrester sighed. \"And the inevitable happened,\" he said. \"From the eighth century B.C., Old Style, until the year 1971 A.D., Old Style, Man's lot went from bad to worse. Without the Gods to guide him he bred bigger and bigger wars and greater and greater empires--beginning with the conquests of the mad Alexander of Macedonia and culminating in the opposing Soviet and American Spheres of Influence during the last century.\"  Spheres of Influence....  Forrester's gaze fell on the blonde girl again. She certainly had a well-developed figure. And she did seem so eager and attentive. He smiled at her tentatively. She smiled back.  \"Urg ...\" he said aloud.  The class didn't seem to notice. That, Forrester told himself sourly, was probably because they weren't listening.  He swallowed, wrenched his gaze from the girl, and said: \"The Soviet-American standoff--for that is what it was--would most probably have resulted in the destruction of the human race.\" It had no effect on the class. The destruction of the human race interested nobody. \"However,\" Forrester said gamely, \"this form of insanity was too much for the Gods to allow. They therefore--\"  The bell rang, signifying the end of the period. Forrester didn't know whether to feel relieved or annoyed.  \"All right,\" he said. \"That's all for today. Your first assignment will be to read and carefully study Chapters One and Two of the textbook.\"  Silence gave way to a clatter of noise as the students began to file out. Forrester saw the front-row blonde rise slowly and gracefully. Any doubts he might have entertained (that is, he told himself wryly, any _entertaining_ doubts) about her figure were resolved magnificently. He felt a little sweat on the palm of his hands, told himself that he was being silly, and then answered himself that the hell he was.  The blonde gave him a slow, sweet smile. The smile promised a good deal more than Forrester thought likely of fulfillment.  He smiled back.  It would have been impolite, he assured himself, not to have done so.  The girl left the room, and a remaining crowd of students hurried out after her. The crowd included two blinking boys, awakened by the bell from what had certainly been a trance. Forrester made a mental note to inquire after their records and to speak with the boys himself when he got the chance.  No sense in disturbing a whole class to discipline them.  He stacked his papers carefully, taking a good long time about it in order to relax himself and let his palms dry. His mind drifted back to the blonde, and he reined it in with an effort and let it go exploring again on safer ground. The class itself ... actually, he thought, he rather liked teaching. In spite of the petty irritations that came from driving necessary knowledge into the heads of stubbornly unwilling students, it was a satisfying and important job. And, of course, it was an honor to hold the position he did. Ever since it had been revealed that the goddess Columbia was another manifestation of Pallas Athena herself, the University had grown tremendously in stature.  And after all ...  Whistling faintly behind his teeth, Forrester zipped up his filled briefcase and went out into the hall. He ignored the masses of students swirling back and forth in the corridors, and, finding a stairway, went up to his second-floor office.  He fumbled for his key, found it, and opened the ground-glass door.  Then, stepping in, he came to a full stop.  The girl had been waiting for him--Maya Wilson.         *       *       *       *       *  And now here she was, talking about the Goddess of Love. Forrester gulped.  \"Anyhow,\" he said at random, \"I'm an Athenan.\" He remembered that he had already said that. Did it matter? \"But what does all this have to do with your passing, or not passing, the course?\" he went on.  \"Oh,\" Maya said. \"Well, I prayed to Aphrodite for help in passing the course. And the Temple Priestess told me I'd have to make a sacrifice to the Goddess. In a way.\"  \"A sacrifice?\" Forrester gulped. \"You mean--\"  \"Not the First Sacrifice,\" she laughed. \"That was done with solemn ceremonies when I was seventeen.\"  \"Now, wait a minute--\"  \"Please,\" Maya said. \"Won't you listen to me?\"  Forrester looked at her limpid blue eyes and her lovely face. \"Sure. Sorry.\"  \"Well, then, it's like this. If a person loves a subject, it's that much easier to understand it. And the Goddess has promised me that if I love the instructor, I'll love the subject. It's like sympathetic magic--see?\"  Her explanation was so brisk and simple that Forrester recoiled. \"Hold on,\" he said. \"Just hold your horses. Do you mean you're in love with me?\"  Maya smiled. \"I think so,\" she said, and very suddenly she was on Forrester's side of the desk, pressing up against him. Her hand caressed the back of his neck and her fingers tangled in his hair. \"Kiss me and let's find out.\"     CHAPTER THREE   Resistance, such as it was, crumbled in a hurry. Forrester complied with fervor. An endless time went by, punctuated only by short breaths between the kisses. Forrester's hands began to rove.  So did Maya's.  She began to unbutton his shirt.  Not to be outdone, his own fingers got busy with buttons, zippers, hooks and the other temporary fastenings with which female clothing is encumbered. He was swimming in a red sea of passion and the Egyptians were nowhere in sight. Absently, he got an arm out of his shirt, and at the same time somehow managed to undo the final button of a series. Maya's blouse fell free.  Forrester felt like stout Cortez.  He pulled the girl to him, feeling the surprisingly cool touch of her flesh against his. Under the blouse and skirt, he was discovering, she wore very little, and that was just as well; nagging thoughts about the doubtful privacy of his office were beginning to assail him.  Nevertheless, he persevered. Maya was as eager as he had ever dreamed of being, and their embrace reached a height of passion and began to climb and climb to hitherto unknown peaks of sensation.  Forrester was busy for some time discovering things he had never known, and a lot of things he had known before, but never so well. Every motion was met with a reaction that was more than equal and opposite, every sensation unlocked the doors to whole galleries of new sensations. Higher and higher went his emotional thermometer, higher and higher and higher and higher and ...  Very suddenly, he discovered how to breathe again, and it was over. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22767"],["title","Pagan Passions (#4)"],["body"," \"My goodness,\" Maya said after a brief resting spell. \"I suppose I _must_ love you for sure. My _good_ness!\"  \"Sure,\" Forrester said. \"And now--if you'll pardon the indelicacy and hand me my pants--\" he found he was still puffing a little and paused until he could go on--\"I've got an appointment I simply can't afford to miss.\"  \"Oh, all right,\" Maya said. \"But Mr. Forrester--\"  He rolled over and looked at her while he began dressing. \"I suppose it would be all right if you called me Bill,\" he said carefully.  \"In class, too?\"  Forrester shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"Not in class.\"  \"But what I wanted to ask--\"  \"Yes?\" Forrester said.  \"Mr.--Bill--do you think I'll pass Introductory World History?\"  Forrester considered that question. There was certainly a wide variety of answers he could construct. When he had finished buttoning his shirt he had decided on one.  \"I don't see why not,\" he said, \"so long as you complete your assignments regularly.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Nearly two hours later, feeling somewhat light-headed but otherwise in perfectly magnificent fettle, Forrester found himself on the downtown subway. He'd showered and changed and he was whistling a gay little tune as he checked his watch.  The time was five minutes to five. He had just over an hour before he was due to appear at the Tower of Zeus All-Father, but it was better to be a few minutes early than even a single second late.  The train ride was a little bumpy, but Forrester didn't really mind. He was pretty well past being irritated by anything. Nevertheless, he was speculating with just a faint unease as to what the Pontifex Maximus wanted with him. What was in store for him at the strange appointment?  And why all the secrecy?  His brooding was interrupted right away. At 100th Street, a bearded old man got on and sat down next to him. He nudged Forrester in the ribs and muttered: \"Look at that now, Daddy-O. Look at that.\"  \"What?\" Forrester said, constrained into conversation.  \"Damn subways, that's what,\" the old man said. \"Worse every year. Bumpier and slower and worse. Just look around, Daddy-O. Look around.\"  \"I wouldn't quite say--\" Forrester began, but the old man gave him another dig in the ribs and cut in:  \"Wouldn't say, wouldn't say,\" he muttered. \"Listen, man, there ain't been an improvement in years. You realize that?\"  \"Well, I--\"  \"No progress, man, not in more than half a century. Listen, when I was a teen king--War Councilor for the Boppers, I was, and let me tell you that was big time, Daddy-O--when I was a teen king, we were going places. Going places for real. Mars. Venus. We were going to have spaceships, man.\"  Forrester smiled spasmically at the old man. \"I'm sure you--\"  \"But what happened?\" the old man interrupted. \"Tell you what happened, man. We never got to Mars and Venus. Mars and Venus came to us instead. Right along with Jupiter and Neptune and Pluto and all the rest of the Gods. And we had no progress ever since that day, Daddy-O, no progress at all and you can believe it.\"  He dug Forrester in the ribs one final time and sat back with melancholy satisfaction.  \"Well,\" Forrester said mildly, \"what good is progress?\" The old man, he assured himself after a moment's reflection, wasn't actually saying anything blasphemous. After all, the Gods didn't expect their worshippers to be mindless slaves.  Somehow the notion made him feel happier. He'd have hated reporting the old man. Something in the outdated slang made him feel--almost patriotic. The old man was a part of America, a respected and important part.  The respected part of America made itself felt again in Forrester's ribs. \"Progress?\" the old man said. \"What good's progress? Listen, Daddy-O--how can the human race get anywhere without progress? Answer me that, will you, man? Because it's for-sure real we're not going any place now. No place at all.\"  \"Now look,\" Forrester said patiently, \"progress is an outmoded idea. We've got to be in step with the times. We've got to ask ourselves what progress ever did for us. How did we stand when the Gods returned?\" For a brief flash he was back in his history class, but he went on: \"Half the world ready to fight the other half with weapons that would have wiped both halves out. You ought to be grateful the Gods returned when they did.\"  \"But we're getting into Nowheresville, man,\" the old man complained. \"We're not in orbit. We can't progress.\"  Forrester sighed. Why was he talking to the old man, anyway? The answer came to him as soon as he'd asked the question. He wanted to keep his mind off the Tower of Zeus and his own unknown fate there. It was an unpleasant answer; Forrester blanked it out.  \"Now, friend,\" he said. \"What have you got? Just what mankind's been looking for all these centuries. Security. You've got security. Nobody's going to blow you to pieces tomorrow. Your job isn't going to vanish overnight. I mean, if you--\"  \"I got a job,\" the old man said.  \"Really?\" Forrester said politely. \"What is it?\"  \"Retired. And it's a tough job, too.\"  \"Oh,\" Forrester said.  \"And anyhow,\" the old man went on, \"what's all this got to do with progress?\"  Forrester thought. \"Well--\"  \"Well, nothing,\" the old man said. \"Listen to me, man. I say nothing against the Gods--right? Nothing at all. Wouldn't want to do anything like that. But at the same time, it looks to me like we ought to be able to--reap the fruits of our labors. I read that some place.\"  \"But--\"  \"In the three thousand years the Gods were gone, we weren't a total loss, man. Not anything like. We discovered a lot. About nature and science and like that. We invented science all by ourselves. So how come the Gods don't let us use it?\" The old man dug his elbow once more into Forrester's rib. \"How come?\"  \"The Gods haven't taken anything away from us,\" Forrester said.  \"Haven't they?\" the old man demanded. \"How about television? Want to answer that one, Daddy-O? Years ago, everybody had a television set. Color and 3-D. The most. The end. Now there's no television at all. Why not? What happened to it?\"  \"Well,\" Forrester said reasonably, \"what good is television?\"  \"What good?\" Once more Forrester's rib felt the old man's elbow. \"Let me tell you--\"  \"No,\" Forrester interrupted, suddenly irritated with the whole conversation. \"Let _me_ tell _you_. The trouble with your generation was that all they wanted to do was sit around on their _glutei maximi_ and be entertained. Like a bunch of hypnotized geese. They didn't want to do anything for themselves. Half of them couldn't even read. And now you want to tell me that--\"  \"Hold it, Daddy-O,\" the old man said. \"You're telling me that the Gods took away television just because we were a bunch of hypnotized geese. That it?\"  \"That's it.\"  \"Okay,\" the old man said. \"So tell me--what are we now? With the Gods and everything. I mean, man, really--what are we?\"  \"Now?\" Forrester said. \"Now you're retired. You're a bunch of retired hypnotized geese.\"  The doors of the train slid creakily open and Forrester got out onto the 34th Street platform, walking angrily toward a stairway without looking back.  True enough, the old man hadn't committed blasphemy, but it had certainly come close enough there at the end. And if pokes with the elbow weren't declared blasphemous, or at least equivalent to malicious mischief, he thought, there was no justice in the world.  The real trouble was that the man had had no respect for the Gods. There were a good many of the older generation like him. They seemed to feel that humanity had been better off when the Gods had been away. Forrester couldn't see it, and felt vaguely uncomfortable in the presence of someone who believed it. After all, mankind _had_ been on the verge of mass suicide, and the Gods had mercifully come back from their self-imposed exile and taken care of things. The exile had been designed to prove, in the drastic laboratory of three thousand years, that Man by himself headed like a lemming for self-destruction. And, for Forrester, the point had been proven.  Yet now that the human race had been saved, there were still men who griped about the Gods and their return. Forrester silently wished the pack of them in Hades, enjoying the company of Pluto and his ilk.  At the corner of 34th and Broadway, as he came out of the subway tunnels, he bought a copy of the _News_ and glanced quickly through the headlines. But, as always, there was little sensational news. Mars was doing pretty well for himself, of course: there were two wars going on in Asia, one in Europe and three revolutions in South and Central America. That last did seem to be overdoing things a bit, but not seriously. Forrester shrugged, wondering vaguely when the United States was going to have its turn.  But he couldn't concentrate on the paper and, after a little while, he got rid of it and took a look at his watch.  Twenty to six. Forrester decided he could use a drink to brace himself and steady his nerves.  Just one.  On Sixth Avenue, near 34th Street, there was a bar called, for some obscure reason, the _Boat House_. Forrester headed for it, went inside and leaned against the bar. The bartender, a tall man with crew-cut reddish hair, raised his eyebrows in a questioning fashion.  \"What'll it be, friend?\"  \"Vodka and ginger ale,\" Forrester said. \"A double.\"  It was still, he told himself uneasily, just one drink. And that was all he was going to have.  The bartender brought it and Forrester sipped at it, watching his reflection in the mirror and wishing he felt easier in his mind about the whole Tower of Zeus affair. Then, very suddenly, he noticed that the man next to him was looking at him oddly. Forrester didn't like the look or, for that matter, the man himself, a raw-boned giant with deep-set eyes and a shock of dead-black hair, but so long as nobody bothered him, Forrester wasn't going to start anything.  Unfortunately, somebody bothered him. The tall man leaned over and"]]]
