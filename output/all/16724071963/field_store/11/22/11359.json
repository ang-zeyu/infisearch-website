If the first of these documents was remarkable for its optimism, the second might justly be described as a {25} masterpiece of faith pure and undefiled by any contact with sordid facts.  Its theme is the magnitude of the compensations which Greece might expect in return for her entry into the War: \"I have a feeling,\" says the author, \"that the concessions in Asia Minor suggested by Sir Edward Grey can, especially if we submit to sacrifices to the Bulgars, assume such dimensions as to double the size of Greece.  I believe that if we demanded\"--he specifies in detail a vast portion of Western Asia Minor--\"our demand would probably be granted.\"  He calculated that the surface of this territory exceeds 125,000 (the figure was soon raised to 140,000) square kilometres, while the area to be ceded in Macedonia did not exceed 2,000 square kilometres, and that loss would be further halved by the acquisition from Servia of the Doiran-Ghevgheli district, which covered some 1,000 square kilometres.  Thus, in point of territory, Greece would be giving up a hundred and fortieth part of what she would be getting.  In point of population also Greece would be receiving twenty-five times as much as she would be sacrificing--an accretion of 800,000 as against a loss of 30,000 souls; and that loss could be obviated by obliging Bulgaria to buy up the property of the Cavalla Greeks, who, he had no doubt, would gladly emigrate _en masse_ to Asia Minor, to reinforce the Greek element there. How was it possible to hesitate about seizing such an opportunity--an opportunity for the creation of a Greece powerful on land and supreme in the Aegean Sea--\"an opportunity verily presented to us by Divine Providence for the realization of our most audacious national ideals\"--presented to-day and never likely to occur again?  M. Venizelos did not doubt but that a transaction which appeared so desirable and feasible to him must appear equally desirable and feasible to others: and great was his surprise to find that such was by no means the case.  The General Staff, he complained, \"seem, strangely, not attracted strongly by these views.\"  And the same might be said of everyone who judged, not by the glow of prophetic insight, but by a cold examination of facts.  When Asia Minor was first mentioned to the Greek Minister in London, that shrewd diplomat answered:  \"Greece would not commit such a folly, for the day she set foot in {26} Asia Minor she would find herself up against Great Powers as well as against Turkey.\" [5]  At Athens to this objection were added others not less weighty.  The General Staff pointed out that Greece had neither the men nor the money required for the permanent occupation and efficient administration of that distant region.  They feared both the difficulties of defending those Turkish territories in Asia and the danger of future attack from Bulgaria in Europe.  In short, they held that Greece by embarking on what they aptly termed a Colonial policy would be undertaking responsibilities wholly incommensurate with her resources.[6]  Dangers and difficulties! cried M. Venizelos: can you allow such things to stand in the way of national ideals?  And he proceeded to demolish the obstructions: the administrative success achieved in Macedonia proved that the resources of Greece were equal to fresh responsibilities; the Turks of Asia Minor--after the total disappearance of the Ottoman Empire, which he deemed inevitable--would become contented and law-abiding Greek subjects, and at all events the local Greek population would in a very short space of time supply all the forces needed to maintain order in Asia, leaving the main Greek army free for the defence of the European frontiers.  During that brief period of transition, he thought it easy to form an agreement with the Entente Powers for military assistance against a Bulgarian attack, or, even without the Entente, \"should the Bulgars be so demented by the Lord as to attempt aggression, I have not the slightest doubt that Servia, moved by her treaty obligations, her interests, and her gratitude for our present aid, would again co-operate with us to humble Bulgarian insolence.\" [7]  Thus at a moment's notice M. Venizelos became an impassioned advocate of the policy of which he had hitherto been an impassioned opponent, and he would have us believe that the King, persuaded by his eloquence, authorised him to carry out his new plan.  Be that as it may, M. Venizelos did not avail himself of this permission.  {27} For almost simultaneously came the news of a Bulgarian loan contracted in the Austro-German market--an event which made him abandon all hopes of conciliating Bulgaria and profiting by the British overture.  During the months when the revival of the Balkan League was perhaps still practicable, he had combated the only expedient which might have given it a chance of realization: by the time he became a convert, it was too late.  The Balkan situation remained as it was before Sir Edward Grey's suggestion: so much so that, when a few days later the Entente Powers again asked Greece to go to Servia's relief, offering her as security against the Bulgarian danger to transport to Macedonia a French and a British division, M. Venizelos, considering such security insufficient, again refused;[8] a refusal which, justified though it was, gave great umbrage.[9]  While the Greek Premier was going through these mental evolutions, the scene of Entente activity shifted: and his flexible mind perforce veered in a new direction.  As far back as 3 November, the outer forts of the Dardanelles had been subjected to a brief bombardment with the object of testing the range of their guns; and by 25 November the idea of a serious attack on the Straits had engaged the attention of the British War Council.  But no decision was arrived at until January, when Russia, hard pressed by the Turks on the Caucasus, begged for a demonstration against them in some other quarter.  In compliance with this appeal, the British War Council then decided to attempt to force the Dardanelles by means of the Navy alone.  After the failure of the naval attack of 19 February, however, it was realized that the operations would have to be supplemented by military action;[10] and as the magnitude of the enterprise became clearer and the troops at the disposal of England and France were very limited, the need of securing Balkan allies became more obvious.  From the first greater importance was attached to Bulgarian co-operation than to Greek.  Even the grant of {28} a loan to Sofia by the Central Powers appears to have produced little or no impression upon those concerned.  Long afterwards it was admitted as a self-evident proposition that belligerents do not lend to neutrals without being satisfied that their money will not be used against themselves.  But at the time, after a momentary shock, the Entente Governments were deluded, either by Bulgarian diplomacy or by their own wishes, into the belief that \"Bulgaria would not commit the stupidity to refuse the advantages offered.\" [11]  Nor, in thus reckoning on enlightened bad faith, were they alone.  M. Venizelos, who a moment before had declared that the loan had opened his eyes to the fact \"that Bulgaria was definitely committed to the Central Powers,\" now felt quite sure that, \"notwithstanding the loan, Bulgaria was capable of betraying her then friends and turning towards those who promised her greater profits.\" [12]  Anxious, therefore, to forestall the Bulgars, and concerned by the thought that he had been obliged on three occasions to decline requests from the Entente, he spontaneously proposed, on 1 March, to offer three Greek divisions for the Dardanelles expedition, stating that this proposal was made with King Constantine's assent.[13]  As a matter of fact, neither the King nor his General Staff approved of M. Venizelos's strategy.  Having made a systematic study of the Dardanelles problem, they judged that the Allies' enterprise, even under the most skilful handling, presented but few chances, and those chances had been discounted in advance by utter want of skilful handling: the bombardment of the Straits in the previous November had given the Turks warning of the blow and ample time to prepare against it--and the Turks were no longer the happy-go-lucky fellows upon whose inefficiency one might formerly have counted; they now mounted guard over the gates of their capital equipped with German guns and commanded by German officers. The enterprise was likely to become more hazardous still by arousing the jealousy of the Bulgars.  If, therefore, Greece did join in, besides all the other risks, she would expose herself to a {29} Bulgarian assault; and with a considerable portion of her forces engaged in Gallipoli, and no prospect either of Servian or of Rumanian assistance, how was she to face that assault?  The King's disapproval was known to no one better than to M. Venizelos himself.  But, for all that, he felt entitled to tell the British Minister at Athens that he had the King's assent.  Here is his own explanation: \"The King was opposed to the enterprise.  I sought another interview in order to speak to him again on the subject, and took with me a third memorandum\"--which has never been published, and cannot yet be published.  \"I asked him to let me read it to him, for in it were set forth fully all the arguments which, in my opinion, imposed co-operation. I read it.  I saw that the King became agitated.  For--I must do him that justice--he rarely remained unconvinced when face to face with me.  So profound was the emotion with which I spoke, so powerful were the arguments which I used that the King, greatly moved, said to me: 'Well, then, in the name of God.'  That is, he assented.\" [14]  However, the General Staff remained unconvinced; and Colonel Metaxas, a brilliant soldier, then Acting-Chief of the Staff, resigned as a protest against military"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],["title","Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#7)"],["body","being made by a Greek minister to other countries without previous consultation with the military experts of his own.  M. Venizelos, on his part, was indignant that mere soldiers should presume to meddle with the plans of statesmen; his view being that the Staff's business was simply to carry out the policy of the Government. Nevertheless, impressed by this resignation, he suggested the meeting of a Crown Council composed of all the ex-Premiers, that their opinions might be heard.  The Council met on 3 March and again on 5 March.  At the first sitting M. Venizelos admitted that the objections of the military experts, without altering his own convictions, might still inspire doubt as to which policy was preferable: neutrality or intervention.  Should the policy of neutrality be adopted, it must be carried on by a new Cabinet, to which he would accord his parliamentary support.  At the second sitting he endeavoured to remove the objections of the military experts by reducing his proposed contribution to the {30} Gallipoli expedition from three divisions to one, which should be replaced in the existing cadres by a division of reserves, so as to leave the Greek Army practically intact against a possible attack from Bulgaria.  And having thus modified the conditions of intervention, he refused to entertain any other policy or to support a Cabinet pledged to neutrality.[15]  Momentarily infected by the Cretan's enthusiasm, nearly all present urged upon the King the acceptance of his proposal; one of them, M. Rallis, even going so far as to say: \"Sire, pray consider that you have a Government clothed with the full confidence of the nation.  Let it carry out its policy.  Else, you will incur undue responsibility.\"  The King's answer was: \"If you wish it, I will abdicate.\" [16]  He would rather give up his crown than assume the responsibility of sanctioning a policy which his whole military training and experience told him was insane and suicidal: how justly, the event soon showed.  The losses of men and ships which Gallipoli cost far exceeded the whole of Greece's military and naval resources; and if that cost proved more than embarrassing to England and France, it would have literally ruined Greece.  M. Rallis and the other ex-Premiers in less than a fortnight gratefully recognised the justness of the King's opposition to their views,[17] and thenceforth parted company with M. Venizelos.  Meanwhile M. Venizelos hastened from the Palace to the British Legation, and, \"in order to save time till he could make an official _démarche_,\" he made to the Entente Ministers there assembled a semi-official communication to this effect: \"Following the natural evolution of its policy of solidarity with the Entente Powers, the Royal Government has judged that the Dardanelles operations afford it a favourable occasion to translate its sentiments into deeds by abandoning its neutrality and offering its co-operation in that enterprise with the whole of its Fleet and one division of its army.\"  All this, \"though the King {31} has not yet given his adhesion.\" [18]  His hurry arose from the belief that the Allies would reach Constantinople in a few days.  But the General Staff still remained unconvinced.  Yes, they said, one division to begin with; but what if the Allies get stuck in the Straits, as we believe they will be, and call upon us for more?  And, once we join them, how can we refuse to supply their needs?  We shall be incurring unlimited liabilities.  So the King, who had full confidence in his military advisers, and who could not bring himself to look upon the Gallipoli adventure as a \"serious enterprise,\" [19] declined his adhesion to M. Venizelos's plan; and M. Venizelos resigned in wrath (6 March).  Then came the Entente replies to his communication; from which it appeared that, as in August, 1914, so now the impetuous Cretan ran ahead of the Powers: that, whilst he was inveighing against everyone who would not let Greece co-operate with them, they had not yet even agreed as to whether they desired her co-operation.  England regarded the communication as a merely preliminary and preparatory step, and waited for a definite proposal after the King's decision, when she would consult with her allies.  France and Russia insisted on the impossibility of Greece limiting her participation to a war against Turkey alone: to be an effective partner of the Entente, Greece must be prepared to fight Austria and Germany also.  France added that the question of the participation of Greece in the Dardanelles enterprise could not be a useful subject of discussion between the Allies until a definite decision by the Greek Government was taken.  Russia did not even envisage the usefulness of such a discussion.  M. Sazonow pointedly declared that he did not consider Greek co-operation in the Dardanelles at all necessary, that the question of the Straits and of Constantinople ought to be settled by the Entente Powers alone without the intervention of third parties, and that Russia did not desire the entry of a Greek army into Constantinople, though she had no objection to its operating against Smyrna or elsewhere.[20]  {32}  Some days later, it is true, M. Delcassé affirmed that he had overcome Russia's repugnance;[21] but, though it is probable that Russia, yielding to pressure, would have accepted the participation of Greek troops, she made no secret of her satisfaction at not having had to do so: \"We heartily consent to your receiving large compensations in Asia Minor,\" said the Russian Minister at Athens, in the presence of his British colleague, to a high official of the Greek Ministry for Foreign Affairs. \"But as to Constantinople, we prefer that you should not come there; it would afterwards be painful for you and disagreeable for everybody to turn you out.\" [22]  M. Venizelos knew these views perfectly well, and did not covet Constantinople: what he coveted, so far as material gains went, were the large compensations in Asia Minor.[23]  There lay the chief objective of his strategy, and its net outcome was to widen the breach between him and those elements in the country which still believed that the policy of Greece must be governed by the solid necessities of the Balkan situation, not by nebulous visions of Imperialist expansion.

[3] He explained, three years afterwards, that at the time of making his offer of 18 Aug., 1914, he bore in mind \"the impossibility of going to Servia's assistance on account of the danger from Bulgaria.\"--_Orations_, p. 93.  But precisely similar was the objection to going against Turkey without a guarantee of Bulgarian neutrality: only the Bulgars, in the one case, would have been on Greece's left flank and in the other on the right.  The truth seems to be that the vision of M. Venizelos lacked the penetration which, in matters of this sort, can only come from long study and reflection.

Venizelos it was decided to dissolve the Chamber and to have General Elections, in which for the first time the territories conquered in 1912-13 would participate. Meanwhile, the King called upon M. Gounaris, a statesman of considerable ability, though with none of the versatility of mind and audacity of character which distinguished his predecessor, to carry on the Government and to preside over the elections.  Under ordinary circumstances these would have taken place at once.  But owing to the need of preparing electoral lists for the new provinces, they were delayed till 13 June, and owing to a serious illness of King Constantine which supervened--causing intense anxiety throughout the nation and bringing political life to a standstill--two more months passed before the new Parliament met.  The interval proved fruitful in developments of far-reaching importance.  On its accession to power, the new Government issued a _communiqué_, announcing that it would pursue the policy adopted at the beginning of the War: a policy of neutrality qualified by a recognition of the obligations imposed by the Servian Alliance, and a determination to serve the interests of Greece without endangering her territorial integrity.[1] And as the Entente representatives at Athens expressed a certain disappointment at not finding in the _communiqué_ any allusion to the Entente Powers,[2] M. Zographos, Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order to remove all uneasiness on that score, instructed the Greek representatives in London, Paris, and Petrograd to assure the respective Governments categorically that the new Ministry did not intend to depart "]]]
