As long as it stayed out of the regular lanes of commerce, and clear of detector stations and planets, it would never be found.  Then how _could_ I find it--and having found it, catch it? When the infernal thing was more than a match for any ship it might meet. That was my problem. It had kept me awake nights and talking to myself days, since there was no easy answer.  I had to construct a solution, slowly and carefully. Since I couldn't be sure where Pepe was going to be next, I had to make him go where I wanted him to.  There were some things in my favor. The most important was the fact I had forced him to make his play before he was absolutely ready. It wasn't chance that he had left the same day I arrived on Cittanuvo. Any plan as elaborate as his certainly included warning of approaching danger. The drive on the battleship, as well as controls and primary armament had been installed weeks before I showed up. Much of the subsidiary work remained to be done when the ship had left. One witness of the theft had graphically described the power lines and cables dangling from the ship's locks when she lifted.  [Illustration]  My arrival had forced Pepe off balance. Now I had to keep pushing until he fell. This meant I had to think as he did, fall into his plan, think ahead--then trap him. Set a thief to catch a thief. A great theory, only I felt uncomfortably on the spot when I tried to put it into practice.  A drink helped, as did a cigar. Puffing on it, staring at the smooth bulkhead, relaxed me a bit. After all--there aren't that many things you can do with a battleship. You can't run a big con, blow safes or make burmedex with it. It is hell-on-jets for space piracy, but that's about all.  \"Great, great--but why a battleship?\"  I was talking to myself, normally a bad sign, but right now I didn't care. The mood of space piracy had seized me and I had been going along fine. Until this glaring inconsistency jumped out and hit me square in the eye.  Why a battleship? Why all the trouble and years of work to get a ship that two people could just barely manage? With a tenth of the effort Pepe could have had a cruiser that would have suited his purposes just as well.  Just as good for space piracy, that is--but not for _his_ purposes. He had wanted a battleship, and he had gotten himself a battleship. Which meant he had more in mind than simple piracy. What? It was obvious that Pepe was a monomaniac, an egomaniac, and as psychotic as a shorted computer. Some day the mystery of how he had slipped through the screen of official testing would have to be investigated. That wasn't my concern now. He still had to be caught.         *       *       *       *       *  A plan was beginning to take shape in my head, but I didn't rush it. First I had to be sure that I knew him well. Any man that can con an entire world into building a battleship for him--then steal it from them--is not going to stop there. The ship would need a crew, a base for refueling and a mission.  Fuel had been taken care of first, the gutted hull of _Ogget's Dream_ was silent witness to that. There were countless planets that could be used as a base. Getting a crew would be more difficult in these peaceful times, although I could think of a few answers to that one, too. Raid the mental hospitals and jails. Do that often enough and you would have a crew that would make any pirate chief proud. Though piracy was, of course, too mean an ambition to ascribe to this boy. Did he want to rule a whole planet--or maybe an entire system? Or more? I shuddered a bit as the thought hit me. Was there really anything that could stop a plan like this once it got rolling? During the Kingly Wars any number of types with a couple of ships and less brains than Pepe had set up just this kind of empire. They were all pulled down in the end, since their success depended on one-man rule. But the price that had to be paid first!  This was the plan and I felt in my bones that I was right. I might be wrong on some of the minor details, they weren't important. I knew the general outline of the idea, just as when I bumped into a mark I knew how much he could be taken for, and just how to do it. There are natural laws in crime as in every other field of human endeavor. I _knew_ this was it.  \"Get the Communications Officer in here at once,\" I shouted at the intercom. \"Also a couple of clerks with transcribers. And fast--this is a matter of life or death!\" This last had a hollow ring, and I realized my enthusiasm had carried me out of character. I buttoned my collar, straightened my ribbons and squared my shoulders. By the time they knocked on the door I was all admiral again.  Acting on my orders the ship dropped out of warpdrive so our psiman could get through to the other operators. Captain Steng grumbled as we floated there with the engines silent, wasting precious days, while half his crew was involved in getting out what appeared to be insane instructions. My plan was beyond his understanding. Which is, of course, why he is a captain and I'm an admiral, even a temporary one.  Following my orders, the navigator again constructed a sphere of speculation in his tank. The surface of the sphere contacted all the star systems a days flight ahead of the maximum flight of the stolen battleship. There weren't too many of these at first and the psiman could handle them all, calling each in turn and sending by news releases to the Naval Public Relations officers there. As the sphere kept growing he started to drop behind, steadily losing ground. By this time I had a general release prepared, along with directions for use and follow up, which he sent to Central 14. The battery of psimen there contacted the individual planets and all we had to do was keep adding to the list of planets.  The release and follow-ups all harped on one theme. I expanded on it, waxed enthusiastic, condemned it, and worked it into an interview. I wrote as many variations as I could, so it could be slipped into as many different formats as possible. In one form or another I wanted the basic information in every magazine, newspaper and journal inside that expanding sphere.  \"What in the devil does this nonsense _mean_?\" Captain Steng asked peevishly. He had long since given up the entire operation as a futile one, and spent most of the time in his cabin worrying about the affect of it on his service record. Boredom or curiosity had driven him out, and he was reading one of my releases with horror.  \"Billionaire to found own world ... space yacht filled with luxuries to last a hundred years,\" the captain's face grew red as he flipped through the stack of notes. \"What connection does this tripe have with catching those murderers?\"         *       *       *       *       *  When we were alone he was anything but courteous to me, having assured himself by not-too-subtle questioning that I was a spurious admiral. There was no doubt I was still in charge, but our relationship was anything but formal.  \"This tripe and nonsense,\" I told him, \"is the bait that will snag our fish. A trap for Pepe and his partner in crime.\"  \"Who is this mysterious billionaire?\"  \"Me,\" I said. \"I've always wanted to be rich.\"  \"But this ship, the space yacht, where is it?\"  \"Being built now in the naval shipyard at Udrydde. We're almost ready to go there now, soon as this batch of instructions goes out.\"  Captain Steng dropped the releases onto the table, then carefully wiped his hands off to remove any possible infection. He was trying to be fair and considerate of my views, and not succeeding in the slightest.  \"It doesn't make sense,\" he growled. \"How can you be sure this killer will ever read one of these things. And if he does--why should he be interested? It looks to me as if you are wasting time while he slips through your fingers. The alarm should be out and every ship notified. The Navy alerted and patrols set on all spacelanes--\"  \"Which he could easily avoid by going around, or better yet not even bother about, since he can lick any ship we have. That's not the answer,\" I told him. \"This Pepe is smart and as tricky as a fixed gambling machine. That's his strength--and his weakness as well. Characters like that never think it possible for someone else to outthink them. Which is what _I'm_ going to do.\"  \"Modest, aren't you,\" Steng said.  \"I try not to be,\" I told him. \"False modesty is the refuge of the incompetent. I'm going to catch this thug and I'll tell you how I'll do it. He's going to hit again soon, and wherever he hits there will be some kind of a periodical with my plant in it. Whatever else he is after, he is going to take all of the magazines and papers he can find. Partly to satisfy his own ego, but mostly to keep track of the things he is interested in. Such as ship sailings.\"  \"You're just guessing--you don't know all this.\"  His automatic assumption of my incompetence was beginning to get me annoyed. I bridled my temper and tried one last time.  \"Yes, I'm guessing--an informed guess--but I do know some facts as well. _Ogget's Dream_ was cleaned out of all reading matter, that was one of the first things I checked. We can't stop the battleship from attacking again, but we can see to it that the time after that she sails into a trap.\"  \"I don't know,\" the captain said, \"it sounds to me like....\"  I never heard what it sounded like, which is all right since he was getting under my skin and might have been tempted to pull my pseudo-rank. The alarm sirens cut his sentence off and we foot-raced to the communications room.  Captain Steng won by a nose, it was his ship and he knew all the shortcuts. The psiman was holding out a transcription, but he summed it up in one sentence. He looked at me while he talked and his face was hard and cold.  \"They hit again, knocked out a Navy supply satellite, thirty-four men"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22541"],["title","The Misplaced Battleship (#5)"],["body","d.\"  \"If your plan doesn't work, _admiral_,\" the captain whispered hoarsely in my ear, \"I'll personally see that you're flayed alive!\"  \"If my plan doesn't work, _captain_--there won't be enough of my skin left to pick up with a tweezer. Now if you please, I'd like to get to Udrydde and pick up my ship as soon as possible.\"  The easy-going hatred and contempt of all my associates had annoyed me, thrown me off balance. I was thinking with anger now, not with logic. Forcing a bit of control, I ordered my thoughts, checking off a mental list.  \"Belay that last command,\" I shouted, getting back into my old space-dog mood. \"Get a call through first and find out if any of our plants were picked up during the raid.\"  While the psiman unfocused his eyes and mumbled under his breath I riffled some papers, relaxed and cool. The ratings and officers waited tensely, and made some slight attempt to conceal their hatred of me. It took about ten minutes to get an answer.  \"Affirmative,\" the psiman said. \"A store ship docked there twenty hours before the attack. Among other things, it left newspapers containing the article.\"  \"Very good,\" I said calmly. \"Send a general order to suspend all future activity with the planted releases. Send it by psimen only, no mention on any other Naval signaling equipment, there's a good chance now it might be 'overheard.'\"  I strolled out slowly, in command of the situation. Keeping my face turned away so they couldn't see the cold sweat.         *       *       *       *       *  It was a fast run to Udrydde where my billionaire's yacht, the _Eldorado_, was waiting. The dockyard commander showed me the ship, and made a noble effort to control his curiosity. I took a sadistic revenge on the Navy by not telling him a word about my mission. After checking out the controls and special apparatus with the technicians, I cleared the ship. There was a tape in the automatic navigator that would put me on the course mentioned in all the articles, just a press of a button and I would be on my way. I pressed the button.  It was a beautiful ship, and the dockyard had been lavish with their attention to detail. From bow to rear tubes she was plated in pure gold. There are other metals with a higher albedo, but none that give a richer effect. All the fittings, inside and out, were either machine-turned or plated. All this work could not have been done in the time allotted, the Navy must have adapted a luxury yacht to my needs.  Everything was ready. Either Pepe would make his move--or I would sail on to my billionaire's paradise planet. If that happened, it would be best if I stayed there.  Now that I was in space, past the point of no return, all the doubts that I had dismissed fought for attention. The plan that had seemed so clear and logical now began to look like a patched and crazy makeshift.  \"Hold on there, sailor,\" I said to myself. Using my best admiral's voice. \"Nothing has changed. It's still the best and _only_ plan possible under the circumstances.\"  Was it? Could I be sure that Pepe, flying his mountain of a ship and eating Navy rations, would be interested in some of the comforts and luxuries of life? Or if the luxuries didn't catch his eye, would he be interested in the planetary homesteading gear? I had loaded the cards with all the things he might want, and planted the information where he could get it. He had the bait now--but would he grab the hook?  I couldn't tell. And I could work myself into a neurotic state if I kept running through the worry cycle. It took an effort to concentrate on anything else, but it had to be made. The next four days passed very slowly.  When the alarm blew off, all I felt was an intense sensation of relief. I might be dead and blasted to dust in the next few minutes, but that didn't seem to make much difference.  Pepe had swallowed the bait. There was only one ship in the galaxy that could knock back a blip that big at such a distance. It was closing fast, using the raw energy of the battleship engines for a headlong approach. My ship bucked a bit as the tug-beams locked on at maximum distance. The radio bleeped at me for attention at the same time. I waited as long as I dared, then flipped it on. The voice boomed out.  \"... That you are under the guns of a warship! Don't attempt to run, signal, take evasive action, or in any other way....\"  \"Who are you--and what the devil do you want?\" I spluttered into the mike. I had my scanner on, so they could see me, but my own screen stayed dark. They weren't sending any picture. In a way it made my act easier, I just played to an unseen audience. They could see the rich cut of my clothes, the luxurious cabin behind me. Of course they couldn't see my hands.  \"It doesn't matter who we are,\" the radio boomed again. \"Just obey orders if you care to live. Stay away from the controls until we have tied on, then do exactly as I say.\"  There were two distant clangs as magnetic grapples hit the hull. A little later the ship lurched, drawn home against the battleship. I let my eyes roll in fear, looking around for a way to escape--and taking a peek at the outside scanners. The yacht was flush against the space-filling bulk of the other ship. I pressed the button that sent the torch-wielding robot on his way.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Now let me tell you something,\" I snapped into the mike, wiping away the worried billionaire expression. \"First I'll repeat your own warning--obey orders if you want to live. I'll show you why----\"  When I threw the big switch a carefully worked out sequence took place. First, of course, the hull was magnetized and the bombs fused. A light blinked as the scanner in the cabin turned off, and the one in the generator room came on. I checked the monitor screen to make sure, then started into the spacesuit. It had to be done fast, at the same time it was necessary to talk naturally. They must still think of me as sitting in the control room.  [Illustration]  \"That's the ship's generators you're looking at,\" I said. \"Ninety-eight per cent of their output is now feeding into coils that make an electromagnet of this ship's hull. You will find it very hard to separate us. And I would advise you not to try.\"  The suit was on, and I kept the running chatter up through the mike in the helmet, relaying to the ship's transmitter. The scene in the monitor receiver changed.  \"You are now looking at a hydrogen bomb that is primed and aware of the magnetic field holding our ships together. It will, of course, go off if you try to pull away.\"  I grabbed up the monitor receiver and ran towards the air lock.  \"This is a different bomb now,\" I said, keeping one eye on the screen and the other on the slowly opening outer door. \"This one has receptors on the hull. Attempt to destroy any part of this ship, or even gain entry to it, and this one will detonate.\"  I was in space now, leaping across to the gigantic wall of the other ship.  \"What do you want?\" These were the first words Pepe had spoken since his first threats.  \"I want to talk to you, arrange a deal. Something that would be profitable for both of us. But let me first show you the rest of the bombs, so you won't get any strange ideas about co-operating.\"  Of course I _had_ to show him the rest of the bombs, there was no getting out of it. The scanners in the ship were following a planned program. I made light talk about all my massive armament that would carry us both to perdition, while I climbed through the hole in the battleship's hull. There was no armor or warning devices at this spot, it had been chosen carefully from the blueprints.  \"Yeah, yeah ... I take your word for it, you're a flying bomb. So stop with this roving reporter bit and tell me what you have in mind.\"  This time I didn't answer him, because I was running and panting like a dog, and had the mike turned off. Just ahead, if the blueprints were right, was the door to the control room. Pepe should be there.  I stepped through, gun out, and pointed it at the back of his head. Angelina stood next to him, looking at the screen.  \"The game's over,\" I said. \"Stand up slowly and keep your hands in sight.\"  \"What do you mean,\" he said angrily, looking at the screen in front of him. The girl caught wise first. She spun around and pointed.  \"He's _here_!\"  They both stared, gaped at me, caught off guard and completely unprepared.  \"You're under arrest, crime-king,\" I told him. \"And your girl friend.\"  Angelina rolled her eyes up and slid slowly to the floor. Real or faked, I didn't care. I kept the gun on Pepe's pudgy form while he picked her up and carried her to an acceleration couch against the wall.  \"What ... what will happen now?\" He quavered the question. His pouchy jaws shook and I swear there were tears in his eyes. I was not impressed by his acting since I could clearly remember the dead men floating in space. He stumbled over to a chair, half dropping into it.  \"Will they do anything to me?\" Angelina asked. Her eyes were open now.  \"I have no idea of what will happen to you,\" I told her truthfully. \"That is up to the courts to decide.\"  \"But he _made_ me do all those things,\" she wailed. She was young, dark and beautiful, the tears did nothing to spoil this.  Pepe dropped his face into his hands and his shoulders shook. I flicked the gun his way and snapped at him.  \"Sit up, Pepe. I find it very hard to believe that you are crying. There are some Naval ships on the way now, the automatic alarm was triggered about a minute ago. I'm sure they'll be glad to see the man who....\"  \"Don't let them take me, please!\" Angelina was on her feet now, her back pressed to the wall. \"They'll put me in prison, do things to my mind!\" She shrunk away as she spoke, stumbling along the wall. I looked back at Pepe, not wanting to have my eyes off him for an instant.  \"There's nothing I can do,\" I told her. I glanced her way and a small door was swinging open and she was gone.  \"Don't try "]]]
