An automobile was passing. The occupants were all watching the bathers in the lake, excepting a little chap of three who had seized the opportunity to climb over the door with the evident idea of jumping to the ground. When Glen saw him he was poised on the running board ready for his jump. Like a flash Glen jumped for the footboard of the moving car and interposed his body as an obstacle to the little fellow's leap. The women in the car screamed and the man who was driving stopped his car in surprise at the intrusion. It was only when Glen hauled the little boy up to view that they saw what he had done.  \"I am Jonathan Gates,\" said the man, offering Glen his hand, \"and this is my wife and daughter. We don't know how to thank you for saving that little scamp from harm.\"  \"We might at least take you back into town,\" suggested Mrs. Gates.  \"But I am going west, into the country,\" said Glen.  \"That is still better,\" said Mr. Gates. \"We live eight miles west of here and will take you wherever you say.\"  \"I'll go just as far as you go,\" Glen replied. \"I live away out west and am on my way on foot. Every mile is a help.\"  They passed through the gates without any notice from the officer who was watching for an escaped Reform School boy, and Glen felt safe again.  \"We have not visited the park in a long while,\" explained Mrs. Gates, \"and it was all new to us. That is why we lost sight of Jack. He was very anxious to run back and see the monkeys again.\"  \"I have never been there before at all,\" said Glen. \"And I am glad I saw this monkey. I was passing and I just went in by chance.\"  \"Not chance,\" said Mr. Gates. \"Let us say Providence. Our boy might have been badly hurt or even killed. Certainly you were led by Providence, or I would rather be more definite and say the hand of God.\"  \"Oh I don't know. I guess not,\" stammered Glen, greatly embarrassed. He wondered what Mr. Gates would say if he knew that he came to the park in running away from the reform school. He had not yet learned that the power of God may even overrule our evil for good. But he was quite willing to agree that his good fortune in meeting the Gates family might be God's providence.  He felt his good fortune still more when Mrs. Gates insisted that he must stay with them at least one night. He yielded, thinking that he would get up very early and slip away before they were astir in the morning. But the excitement of the day had such an effect that he overslept and did not waken until called to breakfast.  The effect of this family was something such as Glen had never known. All they knew of him was his name, but they took him at his word. They accepted his statements without a question--a most unusual thing in his experience. They showed him every kindness. At breakfast Mr. Gates heaped his plate with good things. They were so cordial in their invitation to stay and rest for awhile that he could not refuse them. They showed to him such a spirit of love as made him feel that, after all, Christian people were different from others, and to begin to be sorry that he had taken advantage of the good, old superintendent. They planted in his softened heart seeds of kindness and love which were bound to blossom.  Glen stayed two days, and might have remained longer, but on the morning of the third day, coming down early, he picked up the day-old paper which Mr. Gates had been reading. It was folded back at a place which told of his disappearance from the reform school. He was ashamed to look again in their faces, so he stole out the back way, passed through the barn, and thus made his way out into the dusty road.  His thoughts, as he trudged along, were far from cheerful. Although he had strong, boyish desires to fare forth into the world alone, he much disliked to leave this cheery home. Had he been a clean, honorable boy with a good record he might have stayed there and learned to be a man.  His gloomy thoughts were diverted by the sight of a man who seemed to be having troubles of his own. He was down at the side of an automobile, perspiring freely and vexed with the whole world as he unsuccessfully labored at changing a tire. The automobile was no ordinary car. It had a driver's seat in front and a closed car behind like the closed delivery wagons Glen had seen in town. Bright colored letters announced to the world that J. Jervice supplied the public with a full line of novelties, including rugs, curtains, rare laces and Jervice's Live Stock Condition Powders.  \"Can I help you,\" volunteered Glen. It is worthy of note that the service was freely offered before the man spoke so much as a word. It had not been Glen's habit to volunteer help. He was feeling the influence of the home he had just left.  The offer was not kindly received. The man's reply was so churlish as to leave open the suspicion that he was not naturally a man of pleasant ways.  \"Garn away f'm here,\" he snarled. \"I don't need no boys spyin' around my car.\"  \"Who's spyin'?\" asked Glen defiantly. \"You seem to need somebody pretty bad. You ain't man enough to strip that tire off.\"  \"Nor nobody else wouldn't be,\" declared the man. \"Leastways nobody with jest one pair of hands. While I pry it off one end it slips back on the other. Are you strong?\" he asked, stopping to look at Glen.  \"I'm pretty stout for my age,\" admitted Glen, modestly, \"but I don't want to help nor spy, if you don't want me.\"  \"I could use another pair of hands,\" the peddler admitted. \"I can't pay you nothing for it, though, unless it be a ride to town.\"  \"That is just what I want,\" agreed Glen. \"It's a bargain.\"  The perspiration of Mr. J. Jervice had not been without occasion. The tire he was trying to change had done good service--it was, in fact, the very first tire that wheel had ever carried. Perhaps it cherished fond hopes of remaining in service as long as the wheel to which it clung--at least it resisted most strenuously all efforts to detach it. Both Glen and the man were moist with their efforts before it came away, and they accumulated still more dirt and moisture in applying its successor. But at last it was all done, and Glen had already mounted to the seat, while his companion was putting away his tools, when a cart drove up alongside and Glen recognized in the driver, Mr. Gates.  \"What's the matter?\" he asked, as Mr. Gates pulled up his horse.  \"What's the matter?\" echoed Mr. J. Jervice; \"this boy been doing anything?\"  It was not an unnatural question for there was something in Mr. Gates's look and in Glen's questioning tone that betokened affairs out of the ordinary; furthermore, Mr. J. Jervice seemed to be so suspicious of people in general that one might well think he had something to conceal.  \"The boy's all right,\" replied Mr. Gates. \"I have something to say to him, that's all. If he will come over here we will drive on a few feet while I say it.\"  Glen's thoughts flew back to the folded newspaper and he was instantly suspicious.  \"I don't want to get down,\" he said. \"This gentleman's agreed to give me a ride to town and I don't want to keep him.\"  \"But I want you to stay,\" replied Mr. Gates. \"I will take you to town if you wish, but first I want you to go back home with me and I will tell you something important.\"  Glen felt one of his old, unrestrained passions rising within him.  \"I know what you want,\" he cried. \"I saw the newspaper. You want to send me back to the reform school.\"  \"I want to help you make a man of yourself,\" asserted Mr. Gates, unmoved by the boy's passion. \"It's true I want you to go back to the school, but I will go with you and speak for you. You must go back because it is the only right way out. Let me tell you, Glen, you will never get over a trouble by running away from it. The manly and Christian thing to do is to go back. And that is why I want you to do it.\"  \"And of course you don't want the reward of ten dollars that's always paid for returning a boy. You wouldn't take the money, would you?\"  If the eyes of Mr. Gates were saddened by this mean sneer those of Mr. J. Jervice were not. They lightened with a sudden interest, and he jumped into the battle for the first time.  \"This boy's a goin' with me,\" he told Mr. Gates. \"He's earned a ride and I promised it and I'm a man of my word. You be off, now, and leave him alone.\"  \"You are spoiling his best chance,\" said Mr. Gates. \"I am not interested in the school or the reward. I am simply trying to do my duty to the boy.\"  \"Well, you've done it,\" cried Mr. J. Jervice, as his car gathered headway. \"Good-by to ye.\"  He turned to Glen as the car got into its speed.  \"So you've run away from the reform school, eh? And he was goin' to make ten dollars taking you back?\"  \"Oh, he didn't want the ten dollars,\" said Glen, his rage all gone. \"He treated me awful fine while I was at his house. I just said that because I was mad. But he can't get me to go back; nor nobody else unless they tie me up first.\"  \"I don't know?\" said Mr. J. Jervice. \"Ten dollars is pretty near a week's pay for most men.\"  \"That wouldn't make any difference with him,\" said Glen. \"He's straight as a string.\"  Mr. Gates would have been gratified to know how deep an impression his Christian character had made on this boy who had flouted his kindness.  Mr. J. Jervice was not inclined to conversation--he was puzzling over a problem something akin to that of the fox and the geese (he to be the fox). So they drove along in comparative silence until, topping a hill, Glen exclaimed at the sight of the buildings of a large town.  \"Are we almost there?\" he asked.  \"About three miles yet,\" said Mr. J. Jervice. \"What you going to do when we get there?\"  \"I'm not sure, but I think I'd better leave you before we get to town. I don't believe Mr. Gates would telephone the police but somebody else might.\"  \"You can ride with me a couple o' miles yet. Tell ye what ye can do. S'pose'n you get inside. There's lots o' room and there's a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22644"],["title","The Boy Scout Treasure Hunters; Or, The Lost Treasure of Buffalo Hollow (#3)"],["body","back o' this seat will give ye air. You be real careful and not go fussing around disturbing things. There's things there I wouldn't want ye to touch.\"  It seemed a good idea. Mr. J. Jervice unlocked the doors in the back and Glen stepped inside. The doors slammed behind him and he heard the heavy steel bar drop into its slots. Then he heard something like a laugh--a foxy laugh. Why should Mr. J. Jervice laugh? At once his suspicions were awakened.  As Mr. J. Jervice climbed to his seat again Glen shouted to him through the ventilator.  \"Stop,\" he shouted. \"I've changed my mind. I don't like being in here and I believe I'll take my chance with you on the front seat.\"  Mr. J. Jervice paid no attention.     CHAPTER III  JOLLY BILL IS CONSIDERABLY UPSET   The treachery of Mr. J. Jervice was now very clear. He had decided that he himself would hand Glen over to the authorities and receive the ten dollars reward. Since Glen was almost as big as he, there had been some question how he should restrain the boy. He thought this all settled by his clever scheme, and the ten dollars practically in his pocket. No wonder he chuckled.  But it is well for those who cage wild animals to be sure that the cage is properly prepared. Glen looked around in the gloom of the car. He knew it was useless to bump against those solid doors. The way out lay through Mr. J. Jervice, and the time for getting out was very brief. On a shelf lay a bundle of sticks. He pulled on one and found on the other end a flag. It was an emblem. The flag should bring him freedom.  Glen found that the flag stick would just poke through the ventilator railing. Being effectively poked it struck Mr. J. Jervice neatly in the back of the neck, and the poke being vigorous, it aroused his attention quite thoroughly.  \"Stop that,\" he cried, hastily dodging. \"Them flags is worth a quarter apiece, and you'll break the handle.\"  \"Stop and let me out,\" cried Glen.  \"I can't stop now. I just made this change to accommodate you, remember. Stopping and starting is awfully expensive--takes as much gasoline as running a mile. We'll be in town in five minutes.\"  \"And then you think you will sell me for ten dollars. You'll lose money on it, Mr. Jervice. I have a sharp, open knife in my hand. I'm going to turn loose on everything in--\"  \"Don't you dare,\" shouted Mr. Jervice.  \"But I will if you don't stop. You want to send me back to the reform school. All I'll get will be a little longer sentence. Will that pay you for your goods?\"  Mr. J. Jervice reluctantly stopped his car. He saw ten dollars vanishing into the atmosphere. Whether Glen would have been as destructive as he threatened does not enter into this record. We are obliged to admit that at this time he was a wilful lad, and he was especially provoked at this man because he had dragged him from the counsel and aid of Mr. Gates for the sole purpose of his personal gain. It is enough for us to know that Mr. J. Jervice quite believed that a reform school boy with a knife was equal to anything.  \"Everything in here is in just as good order as when I came in,\" said Glen, when the doors were opened. \"I earned this ride, so I don't owe you anything. Now you stand away off and let me get out.\"  There was no need to be so emphatic. Mr. J. Jervice was neither a big man nor a brave man, and had no idea of offering any opposition. He stood well aside as Glen jumped from the car and ran away through the fields.  One thing was very clear to Glen. Mr. J. Jervice would certainly reach town in a few minutes and just as certainly would advise the authorities to look out for him. He might even come back with the officer, knowing that the boy would have but a short start. Glen was standing by an abandoned stone quarry as these thoughts came to him. It contained many nooks and corners in which a boy might hide, and would be far safer for the present than tramping along the road or in the fields. So he picked out a secluded nook and lay there until evening. He watched eagerly for signs of an officer or Mr. J. Jervice, but also fruitlessly. Had he but known it he was perfectly safe, for Mr. J. Jervice was again having troubles of his own. Perhaps this was his day for trouble.  Spending a whole day cooped up in a little niche about ten feet long by three wide, even though it be as high as the heavens, is dreary work for a boy. The time dragged terribly. In his work on the school farm Glen had learned to use the sun for a clock quite accurately, so there was no deceiving himself as to time. He had eaten a good breakfast before leaving the Gates' home so there was no occasion for excessive hunger, but he did get very thirsty. Looking down through the old quarry he fancied he saw a pump, and when the sun reached its noon zenith he crept cautiously down and satisfied his thirst. There was no one in sight, yet he felt afraid to venture toward the town before dark, and went back to his hiding place.  On the way back he made a great find. Some careless workman had left a mallet and chisel lying by a huge slab of stone. They were rusted by the weather but otherwise in good condition. Glen took them to his hiding place and spent a great deal of the afternoon cleaning off the rust. Then he began work on a rough block of stone which lay near and was greatly gratified at the result of his labors. So the afternoon slipped away without the dreariness of the morning.  He was hungry now and tired and consumed with loneliness. His thoughts turned to the pleasant home he had just left with a great longing. They had given him good treatment--the Gates family. He contrasted Mr. Gates with Mr. Jervice, stirring in his bosom a great indignation at the treachery of Jervice, and also awakening a great trust and confidence in Mr. Gates. Perhaps he was right after all. Perhaps it would be a good thing for him to go back to the school, serve out his time, and then try to make a man of himself. If the school had been close at hand he would have gone at once, for the supper-time picture which rose to his mind, with the crowd of boys ready for their plain but wholesome food was a very attractive one just now. Where his supper was to come from he did not know, for his only nickel had paid for the ticket to the merry-go-round.  Now that it was dark enough to make his travel safe he picked up his chisel and mallet and climbed up the side of the quarry. The tools gave him an idea. They were marketable and would surely provide a supper for him. He looked them over as closely as the fading light would allow but found no marks or initials to indicate the owner. So he felt a little more certain of his plans as he hurried along the road toward the town.  He had no intention of going to a big store and offering the tools for sale. His choice would be rather a small general shop where he could get both food and a hat in exchange for his offering. He felt that the lack of a hat as he walked through the streets would be sure to attract attention. He found just the place he needed at the very outskirts of the town, a little \"general utility store\" designed to supply the needs of the dwellers in outlying houses who did not wish to go to town for every purchase.  But the dealer was suspicious of a bareheaded boy in a man's suit of clothes offering to trade a mallet and chisel for a meal and a straw hat.  \"Where did you get these things?\" he asked, as he closely examined the tools.  \"I found them in the old quarry east of town,\" replied Glen.  \"You found them! They don't look like tools that have been lying around in an old quarry.\"  \"No, sir. Because I spent all afternoon cleaning them up.\"  \"I hope that's true, boy. I want to be fair with you. Wait a minute while I make a few inquiries.\"  He turned to the telephone; and even as he did so Glen fled through the open door. It was unfair, miserably unfair, he told himself as he ran, and the hot tears filled his eyes. He had found these tools all rusty, and spent all afternoon cleaning them, and now this man was bound to call up the police. He did not stop to think that if he had been an honest boy with a good record calling up the police would have meant nothing to him.  Glen slowed his pace to a walk after a few blocks; a running boy was too conspicuous. Every time he saw a man in any kind of a uniform he dodged out of his way. A street-car conductor on his way home, who passed near to him, gave him a great scare. And at last came a policeman who really did start after him; at least he walked in his direction and when Glen started to run he ran too. Glen was terribly frightened. He ran madly, not once looking behind, and therefore ignorant of the fact that after one block the officer gave up the chase after a boy who was probably playing some foolish joke. It was a hot night but the sweat on Glen's face was caused as much by terror as by his exertion. He ran not knowing where he was going and at last hardly seeing. Then he swung around a sharp corner, came into collision with some kind of a vehicle, and rolled over and over with it and its occupant into the gutter.  Glen lay panting from the chase he had given himself, for just a second, and in that second he felt a large hand grip his arm in a firm grasp. But it was not the policeman. Beside him, with his head touching the curb, lay a strong young man. Across their bodies was the vehicle which Glen had overturned, something like a large baby buggy or a small invalid chair, with a steering wheel in front. No one came to their help, for Glen had instinctively selected the quiet streets and this one seemed deserted save for them two. Seeing no policeman in sight Glen gained confidence.  \"Let go of my arm,\" he cried.  \"I can't afford to just yet,\" replied the young man. \"It's the only thing I've got to remember you by, unless you count this big bump on the back of my head.\"  \"I didn't mean to hurt you,\" said Glen.  \"I reckon not. I suppose it was thoughtless for me to get in your way. "]]]
