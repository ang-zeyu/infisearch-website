This is enclosed in a suitable casing, such as will readily suggest itself to the novice.  ELECTRIC BELL.--One of the first things the boy wants to make, and one which is also an interesting piece of work, is an electric bell.  To make this he will be brought, experimentally, in touch with several important features in electrical work. He must make a battery for the production of current, a pair of electro-magnets to be acted upon by the current, a switch to control it, and, finally, he must learn how to connect it up so that it may be operated not only from one, but from two or more push buttons.  [Illustration: _Fig. 48._ PUSH BUTTON]  HOW MADE.--In Fig. 49 is shown an electric bell, as usually constructed, so modified as to show the structure at a glance, with its connections. A is the base, B, B' the binding posts for the wires, C, C the electro-magnets, C' the bracket for holding the magnets, D the armature, E the thin spring which connects the armature with the post F, G the clapper arm, H the bell, I the adjusting screw on the post J, K the wire lead from the binding post B to the first magnet, L the wire which connects the two magnets, M the wire which runs from the second magnet to the post J, and N a wire leading from the armature post to the binding post B'.  [Illustration: _Fig. 49._ ELECTRIC BELL]  The principle of the electric bell is this: In looking at Fig. 49, you will note that the armature bar D is held against the end of the adjusting screw by the small spring E. When a current is turned on, it passes through the connections and conduits as follows: Wire K to the magnets, wire M to the binding post J, and set screw I, then through the armature to the post F, and from post F to the binding post B'.  [Illustration: _Fig. 50._ ARMATURE OF ELECTRIC BELL]  ELECTRIC BELL--HOW OPERATED.--The moment a current passes through the magnets (C, C), the core is magnetized, and the result is that the armature (D) is attracted to the magnets, as shown by the dotted lines (O), when the clapper strikes the bell. But when the armature moves over to the magnet, the connection is broken between the screw (I) and armature (D), so that the cores of the magnets are demagnetized and lose their pull, and the spring (E) succeeds in drawing back the armature. This operation of vibrating the armature is repeated with great rapidity, alternately breaking and re-establishing the circuit, by the action of the current.  In making the bell, you must observe one thing, the binding posts (B, B') must be insulated from each other, and the post J, or the post F, should also be insulated from the base. For convenience we show the post F insulated, so as to necessitate the use of wire (N) from post (F) to binding post (B').  The foregoing assumes that you have used a cast metal base, as most bells are now made; but if you use a wooden base, the binding posts (B, B') and the posts (F, J) are insulated from each other, and the construction is much simplified.  It is better, in practice, to have a small spring (P, Fig. 50) between the armature (D) and the end of the adjusting screw (I), so as to give a return impetus to the clapper. The object of the adjusting screw is to push and hold the armature close up to the ends of the magnets, if it seems necessary.  If two bells are placed on the base with the clapper mounted between them, both bells will be struck by the swinging motion of the armature.  An easily removable cap or cover is usually placed over the coils and armature, to keep out dust.  A very simple annunciator may be attached to the bell, as shown in the following figures:  [Illustration: _Figs. 51-54._ ANNUNCIATOR]  ANNUNCIATORS.--Make a box of wood, with a base (A) 4\" × 5\" and 1/2 inch thick. On this you can permanently mount the two side pieces (B) and two top and bottom pieces (C), respectively, so they project outwardly 4-1/2 inches from the base. On the open front place a wood or metal plate (D), provided with a square opening (D), as in Fig. 54, near its lower end. This plate is held to the box by screws (E).  Within is a magnet (F), screwed into the base (A), as shown in Fig. 51; and pivoted to the bottom of the box is a vertical armature (G), which extends upwardly and contacts with the core of the magnet. The upper end of the armature has a shoulder (H), which is in such position that it serves as a rest for a V-shaped stirrup (I), which is hinged at J to the base (C). This stirrup carries the number plate (K), and when it is raised to its highest point it is held on the shoulder (H), unless the electro-magnet draws the armature out of range of the stirrup. A spring (L) bearing against the inner side of the armature keeps its upper end normally away from the magnet core. When the magnet draws the armature inwardly, the number plate drops and exposes the numeral through the opening in the front of the box. In order to return the number plate to its original position, as shown in Fig. 51, a vertical trigger (M) passes up through the bottom, its upper end being within range of one of the limbs of the stirrup.  This is easily made by the ingenious boy, and will be quite an acquisition to his stock of instruments. In practice, the annunciator may be located in any convenient place and wires run to that point.  [Illustration: _Fig. 55._ ALARM SWITCH ON WINDOW]  [Illustration: _Fig. 56._ BURGLAR ALARM ATTACHMENT TO WINDOW]  BURGLAR ALARM.--In order to make a burglar alarm connection with a bell, push buttons or switches may be put in circuit to connect with the windows and doors, and by means of the annunciators you may locate the door or window which has been opened. The simplest form of switch for a window is shown in the following figures:  The base piece (A), which may be of hard rubber or fiber, is 1/4 inch thick and 1\" × 1-1/2\" in size.  [Illustration: _Fig. 57._ BURGLAR ALARM CONTACT]  At one end is a brass plate (B), with a hole for a wood screw (C), this screw being designed to pass through the plate and also into the window-frame, so as to serve as a means of attaching one of the wires thereto. The inner end of the plate has a hole for a round-headed screw (C') that also goes through the base and into the window-frame. It also passes through the lower end of the heart-shaped metal switch-piece (D).  The upper end of the base has a brass plate (E), also secured to the base and window by a screw (F) at its upper end. The heart-shaped switch is of such length and width at its upper end that when it is swung to the right with one of the lobes projecting past the edge of the window-frame, the other lobe will be out of contact with the plate (E).  [Illustration: _Fig. 58._ NEUTRAL POSITION OF CONTACT]  The window sash (G) has a removable pin (H), which, when the sash moves upwardly, is in the path of the lobe of the heart-shaped switch, as shown in Fig. 56, and in this manner the pin (H) moves the upper end of the switch (D) inwardly, so that the other lobe contacts with the plate (E), and establishes an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 57. During the daytime the pin (H) may be removed, and in order to protect the switch the heart-shaped piece (D) is swung inwardly, as shown in Fig. 58, so that neither of the lobes is in contact with the plate (E).  WIRE CIRCUITING.--For the purpose of understanding fully the circuiting, diagrams will be shown of the simple electric bell with two push buttons; next in order, the circuiting with an annunciator and then the circuiting necessary for a series of windows and doors, with annunciator attachments.  [Illustration: _Fig. 59._ CIRCUITING FOR ELECTRIC BELL]  CIRCUITING SYSTEM WITH A BELL AND TWO PUSH BUTTONS.--Fig. 59 shows a simple circuiting system which has two push buttons, although any number may be used, so that the bell will ring when the circuit is closed by either button.  THE PUSH BUTTONS AND THE ANNUNCIATOR BELLS.--Fig. 60 shows three push buttons and an annunciator for each button. These three circuits are indicated by A, B and C, so that when either button makes contact, a complete circuit is formed through the corresponding annunciator.  [Illustration: _Fig. 60._ _Annunciators_]  [Illustration: _Fig. 61._ WIRING SYSTEM FOR A HOUSE]  WIRING UP A HOUSE.--The system of wiring up a house so that all doors and windows will be connected to form a burglar alarm outfit, is shown in Fig. 61. It will be understood that, in practice, the bell is mounted on or at the annunciator, and that, for convenience, the annunciator box has also a receptacle for the battery. The circuiting is shown diagramatically, as it is called, so as fully to explain how the lines are run. Two windows and a door are connected up with an annunciator having three drops, or numbers 1, 2, 3. The circuit runs from one pole of the battery to the bell and then to one post of the annunciator. From the other post a wire runs to one terminal of the switch at the door or window. The other switch terminal has a wire running to the other pole of the battery.  A, B, C represent the circuit wires from the terminals of the window and door switches, to the annunciators.  It is entirely immaterial which side of the battery is connected up with the bell.  From the foregoing it will readily be understood how to connect up any ordinary apparatus, remembering that in all cases the magnet must be brought into the electric circuit.     CHAPTER VIII  ACCUMULATORS. STORAGE OR SECONDARY BATTERIES   STORING UP ELECTRICITY.--In the foregoing chapters we have seen that, originally, electricity was confined in a bottle, called the Leyden jar, from which it was wholly discharged at a single impulse, as soon as it was connected up by external means. Later the primary battery and the dynamo were invented to generate a constant current, and after these came the second form of storing electricity, called the storage or secondary battery, and later still"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22767"],["title","Pagan Passions (#0)"],["body","[Cover Illustration]                                  PAGAN PASSIONS                           Adult Science Fiction,               with the supernatural making complete sense.  The Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Greece and Rome had returned to Earth--with all their awesome powers intact, and Earth was transformed almost overnight. War on any scale was outlawed, along with boom-and-bust economic cycles, and prudery--no change was more startling than the face of New York, where, for instance, the Empire State Building became the Tower of Zeus!  In this totally altered world, William Forrester was an acolyte of Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, and therefore a teacher, in this case of a totally altered history--and Maya Wilson, girl student, evidently had a totally altered way of grading in mind--but what else would a worshipper of Venus, Goddess of Love, have in mind?  This was just the first of the many Trials of Forrester, every bit as mighty and perilous as the Labors of Hercules. In love with Gerda Symes, like him a devotee of Athena, like him a frequenter of the great Temple of Pallas Athena (formerly known as the 42nd Street Library)--dedicated, in short, to the pleasures of the mind--Forrester was under the soft, compelling pressure of soft, compelling devotees of Venus, Bacchus and the like, and in need of all the strength that he and his Goddess, the beautiful and intellectual Athena, could muster to save him from the endless temptations of this new Earth.  And into this sensuous strife strode Temple Myrmidons--religious cops sworn to obey orders without question or hesitation--with a pickup order for William Forrester.  Where he was taken, what happened to him, the truly fantastic discoveries he made about himself and the Gods and Goddesses--here are the ingredients that make up this science fiction novel of suspense, intrigue, mystery and danger. For science fiction it is, with the supernatural making complete sense, and fun too, despite the Sword of Damocles hanging by a thread over Forrester's head!                           _by Randall Garrett and                              Larry M.

Her red hair curled like a flame round her eager, heart-shaped face. Her arms reached for him. Her hands touched him. Her eyes were alive with the light of pure love. I am yours, the eyes kept saying. Do with me as you will.  Forrester watched the eyes with a kind of fascination.  Now the girl's mouth opened, the lips parted slightly, and her husky voice murmured softly: \"Take me. Take me.\"  Forrester blinked and stepped back.  \"My God,\" he said. \"This is ridiculous.\"  The girl pressed herself against him. The sensation was, Forrester thought with a kind of awe, undeniably pleasant. He tried to remember the girl's name, and couldn't. She wriggled slightly and her arms went up around him. Her hands clasped at the back of his neck and her mouth moved, close to his ear.  \"Please,\" she whispered. \"I want you....\"  Forrester felt his head swimming. He opened his mouth but nothing whatever came out. He shut his mouth and tried to think what to do with his hands. They were hanging foolishly at his sides. The girl came even closer, something Forrester would have thought impossible.  Time stopped. Forrester swam in a pink haze of sensations. Only one small corner of his brain refused to lose itself in the magnificence of the moment. In that corner, Forrester felt feverishly uncomfortable. He tried again to remember the girl's name, and failed again. Of course, there was really no reason why he should have known the name. It was, after all, only the first day of class.  \"Please,\" he said valiantly. \"Miss--\"  He stopped.  \"I'm Maya Wilson,\" the girl said in his ear. \"I'm in your class, Mr. Forrester. Introductory World History.\" She bit his ear gently. Forrester jumped.  None of the textbooks of propriety he had ever seen seemed to cover the situation he found himself in. What did one do when assaulted (pleasantly, to be sure, but assault was assault) by a lovely girl who happened to be one of your freshman students? She had called him Mr. Forrester. That was right and proper, even if it was a little silly. But what should he call her? Miss Wilson?  That didn't sound right at all. But, for other reasons, Maya sounded even worse.  The girl said: \"Please,\" and added to the force of the word with another little wriggle against Forrester. It solved his problems. There was now only one thing to do, and he did it.  He broke away, found himself on the other side of his desk, looking across at an eager, wet-lipped freshman student.  \"Well,\" he said. There was a lone little bead of sweat trickling down his forehead, across his frontal ridge and down one cheek. He ignored it bravely, trying to think what to do next. \"Well,\" he repeated at last, in what he hoped was a gentle and fatherly tone. \"Well, well, well, well, well.\" It didn't seem to have any effect. Perhaps, he thought, an attempt to put things back on the teacher-student level might have better results. \"You wanted me to see you?\" he said in a grave, scholarly tone. Then, gulping briefly, he amended it in a voice that had suddenly grown an octave: \"You wanted to see me? I mean, you--\"  \"Oh,\" Maya Wilson said. \"Oh, my goodness, _yes_, Mr. Forrester!\"  She made a sudden sensuous motion that looked to Forrester as if she had suddenly abolished bones. But it wasn't unpleasant. Far from it. Quite the contrary.  Forrester licked his lips, which were suddenly very dry. \"Well,\" he said. \"What about, Miss--uh--Miss Wilson?\"  \"Please call me Maya, Mr. Forrester. And I'll call you--\" There was a second of hesitation. \"Mr. Forrester,\" Maya said plaintively, \"what is your first name?\"  \"First name?\" Forrester tried to think of his first name. \"You want to know my first name?\"  \"Well,\" Maya said, \"I want to call you something. Because after all--\" She looked as if she were going to leap over the desk.  \"You may call me,\" Forrester said, grasping at his sanity, \"Mr. Forrester.\"  Maya sidled around the desk quietly. \"Mr. Forrester,\" she said, reaching for him, \"I wanted to talk to you about the Introductory World History course.\"  Forrester shivered as if someone had thrown cold water on his rising aspirations.  \"Oh,\" he said.  \"That's right,\" Maya whispered. Her mouth was close to his ear again. Other parts of her were close to other parts of him once more. Forrester found it difficult to concentrate.  \"I've _got_ to pass the course, Mr. Forrester,\" Maya whispered. \"I've just _got_ to.\"  Somehow, Forrester retained just enough control of his faculties to remember the standard answer to protestations like that one. \"Well, I'm sure you will,\" he said in what he hoped was a calm, hearty, hopeful voice. He was reasonably sure it wasn't any of those, and even surer that it wasn't all three. \"You seem like a--like a fairly intelligent young lady,\" he finished lamely.  \"Oh, no,\" she said. \"I'm sure I won't be able to remember all those old-fashioned dates and things. Never. Never.\" Suddenly she pressed herself wildly against him, throwing him slightly off balance. Locked together, the couple reeled against the desk. Forrester felt it digging into the small of his back. \"I'll do anything to pass the course, Mr. Forrester!\" she vowed. \"Anything!\"  The insistent pressure of the desk top robbed the moment of some of its natural splendor. Forrester disengaged himself gently and slid a little out of the way. \"Now, now,\" he said, moving rapidly across the room toward a blank wall. \"This sort of thing isn't usually done, Maya. I mean, Miss Wilson. I mean--\"  \"But--\"  \"People just don't do such things,\" Forrester said sternly. He thought of escaping through the door, but the picture that arose immediately in his mind dissuaded him. He saw Maya pursuing him passionately through the halls while admiring students and faculty stared after them. \"Anyhow,\" he added as an afterthought, \"not at the _beginning_ of the semester.\"  \"Oh,\" Maya said. She was advancing on him slowly. \"You mean, I ought to see if I can pass the course on my own first, and _then_--\"  \"Not at all,\" Forrester cut in.  Maya sniffed sadly. \"Oh, you just don't understand,\" she said. \"You're an Athenian, aren't you?\"  \"Athenan,\" Forrester said automatically. It was a correction he found himself called upon to make ten or twelve times a week. \"An Athenian is a resident of Athens, while an Athenan is a worshipper of the Goddess Athena. We--\"  \"I understand,\" Maya said. \"I suppose it's like us. We don't like to be called Aphrodisiacs, you know. We prefer Venerans.\"  She was leaning across the desk. Forrester, though he supposed some people might be fussy about it, could see no objection whatever to the term Aphrodisiacs. A wild thought dealing with Spheres of Influence strayed into his mind, and he suppressed it firmly.  The girl was a Veneran. A worshipper of Venus, Goddess of Love.  Her choice of"]]]
