In the 1.5 gravity, that was not much.  They left when the blue star rose. They filed out through the northern gate and the rear guard closed it behind them. There was almost no conversation among them. Some of them turned to take a last look at what had been the only home they had ever known on Ragnarok, then they all faced forward again, to the northwest, where the foothills of the plateau might offer them sanctuary.  They found their sanctuary on the second day; a limestone ridge honey-combed with caves. Men were sent back at once to carry the food and supplies left in the stockade to the new home.  They returned, to report that the second herd of unicorns had broken down the walls and ripped the interior of the stockade into wreckage. Much of the food and supplies had been totally destroyed.  Lake sent them back twice more to bring everything, down to the last piece of bent metal or torn cloth. They would find uses for all of it in the future.         *       *       *       *       *  The cave system was extensive, containing room for several times their number. The deeper portions of the caves could not be lived in until ventilation ducts were made, but the outer caves were more than sufficient in number. Work was begun to clear them of fallen rubble, to pry down all loose material overhead and to level the floors. A spring came out of the ridge not far from the caves and the approach to the caves was so narrow and steep that unicorns could scramble up it only with difficulty and one at a time. And should they ever reach the natural terrace in front of the caves they would be too large to enter and could do no more than stand outside and make targets of themselves for the bowmen within.  Anders was in charge of making the caves livable, his working force restricted almost entirely to women and children. Lake sent Barber out, with a small detachment of men, to observe the woods goats and learn what plants they ate. And then learn, by experimenting, if such plants could be safely eaten by humans.  The need for salt would be tremendously increased when summer came. Having once experienced a saltless two weeks in the desert Lake doubted that any of them could survive without it. All hunting parties, as well as Barber's party, were ordered to investigate all deposits that might contain salt as well as any stream or pond that was white along the banks.  The hunting parties were of paramount importance and they were kept out to the limits of their endurance. Every man physically able to do so accompanied them. Those who could not kill game could carry it back to the caves. There was no time to spare; already the unicorns were decreasing in numbers and the woods goats were ranging farther and farther north.  At the end of twenty days Lake went in search of Barber and his party, worried about them. Their mission was one that could be as dangerous as any hunting trip. There was no proof that humans and Ragnarok creatures were so similar as to guarantee that food for one might not be poison for the other. It was a very necessary mission, however; dried meat, alone, would bring grave deficiency diseases during the summer which dried herbs and fruits would help prevent.  When he located Barber's party he found Barber lying under a tree, pale and weak from his latest experiment but recovering.  \"I was the guinea pig yesterday,\" Barber said. \"Some little purple berries that the woods goats nibble at sometimes, maybe to get a touch of some certain vitamin or something. I ate too many, I guess, because they hit my heart like the kick of a mule.\"  \"Did you find anything at all encouraging?\" Lake asked.  \"We found four different herbs that are the most violent cathartics you ever dreamed of. And a little silvery fern that tastes like vanilla flavored candy and paralyzes you stiff as a board on the third swallow. It's an hour before you come back out of it.  \"But on the good side we found three different kinds of herbs that seem to be all right. We've been digging them up and hanging them in the trees to dry.\"  Lake tried the edible herbs and found them to be something like spinach in taste. There was a chance they might contain the vitamins and minerals needed. Since the hunting parties were living exclusively on meat he would have to point out the edible herbs to all of them so they would know what to eat should any of them feel the effects of diet deficiency.  He traveled alone as he visited the various hunting parties, finding such travel to be safer each day as the dwindling of the unicorns neared the vanishing point. It was a safety he did not welcome; it meant the last of the game would be gone north long before sufficient meat was taken.  None of the hunting parties could report good luck. The woods goats, swift and elusive at best, were vanishing with the unicorns. The last cartridge had been fired and the bowmen, while improving all the time, were far from expert. The unicorns, which should have been their major source of meat, were invulnerable to arrows unless shot at short range in the side of the neck just behind the head. And at short range the unicorns invariably charged and presented no such target.  He made the long, hard climb up the plateau's southern face, to stand at last on top. It was treeless, a flat, green table that stretched to the north for as far as he could see. A mountain range, still capped with snow, lay perhaps a hundred miles to the northwest; in the distance it looked like a white, low-lying cloud on the horizon. No other mountains or hills marred the endless sweep of the high plain.  The grass was thick and here and there were little streams of water produced by the recently melted snow. It was a paradise land for the herbivores of Ragnarok but for men it was a harsh, forbidding place. At that elevation the air was so thin that only a moderate amount of exertion made the heart and lungs labor painfully. Hard and prolonged exertion would be impossible.  It seemed unlikely that men could hunt and dare unicorn attacks at such an elevation but two hunting parties were ahead of him; one under the grim Craig and one under the reckless Schroeder, both parties stripped down to the youngest, strongest men among all the Rejects.  He found Schroeder early one morning, leading his hunters toward a small band of woods goats. Two unicorns were grazing in between and the hunters were swinging downwind from them. Schroeder saw him coming and walked back a little way to meet him.  \"Welcome to our breathtaking land,\" Schroeder greeted him. \"How are things going with the rest of the hunting parties?\"  Schroeder was gaunt and there was weariness beneath his still lithe movements. His whiskers were an untamed sorrel bristling and across his cheekbone was the ugly scar of a half healed wound. Another gash was ripped in his arm and something had battered one ear. He reminded Lake of a battle-scarred, indomitable tomcat who would never, for as long as he lived, want to relinquish the joy of conflict and danger.  \"So far,\" he answered, \"you and Craig are the only parties to manage to tackle the plateau.\"  He asked about Schroeder's luck and learned it had been much better than that of the others due to killing three unicorns by a method Schroeder had thought of.  \"Since the bowmen have to be to one side of the unicorns to kill them,\" Schroeder said, \"it only calls for a man to be the decoy and let the unicorns chase him between the hidden bowmen. If there's no more than one or two unicorns and if the decoy doesn't have to run very far and if the bowmen don't miss it works well.\"  \"Judging from your beat-up condition,\" Lake said, \"you must have been the decoy every time.\"  \"Well----\" Schroeder shrugged his shoulders. \"It was my idea.\"  \"I've been wondering about another way to get in shots at close range,\" Lake said. \"Take the skin of a woods goat, give it the original shape as near as possible, and a bowman inside it might be able to fake a grazing woods goat until he got the shot he wanted.  \"The unicorns might never suspect where the arrows came from,\" he concluded. \"And then, of course, they might.\"  \"I'll try it before the day is over, on those two unicorns over there,\" Schroeder said. \"At this elevation and in this gravity my own method is just a little bit rough on a man.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lake found Craig and his men several miles to the west, all of them gaunt and bearded as Schroeder had been.  \"We've had hell,\" Craig said. \"It seems that every time we spot a few woods goats there will be a dozen unicorns in between. If only we had rifles for the unicorns....\"  Lake told him of the plan to hide under woods goats' skins and of the decoy system used by Schroeder.  \"Maybe we won't have to use Schroeder's method,\" he said. \"We'll see if the other works--I'll give it the first try.\"  This he was not to do. Less than an hour later one of the men who helped dry the meat and carry it to the caves returned to report the camp stricken by a strange, sudden malady that was killing a hundred a day. Dr. Chiara, who had collapsed while driving himself on to care for the sick, was sure it was a deficiency disease. Anders was down with it, helpless, and Bemmon had assumed command; setting up daily work quotas for those still on their feet and refusing to heed Chiara's requests concerning treatment of the disease.  Lake made the trip back to the caves in a fraction of the length of time it had taken him to reach the plateau, walking until he was ready to drop and then pausing only for an hour or two of rest. He spotted Barber's camp when coming down off the plateau and he swung to one side, to tell Barber to have a supply of the herbs sent to the caves at once.  He reached the caves, to find half the camp in bed and the other half dragging about listlessly at the tasks given them by Bemmon."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22549"],["title","Space Prison (#8)"],["body"," was in grave condition, too weak to rise, and Dr. Chiara was dying.  He squatted down beside Chiara's pallet and knew there could be no hope for him. On Chiara's pale face and in his eyes was the shadow of his own foreknowledge.  \"I finally saw what it was\"--Chiara's words were very low, hard to hear--\"and I told Bemmon what to do. It's a deficiency disease, complicated by the gravity into some form not known on Earth.\"  He stopped to rest and Lake waited.  \"Beri-beri--pellagra--we had deficiency diseases on Earth. But none so fatal--so quickly. I told Bemmon--ration out fruits and vegetables to everybody. Hurry--or it will be too late.\"  Again he stopped to rest, the last vestige of color gone from his face.  \"And you?\" Lake asked, already knowing the answer.  \"For me--too late. I kept thinking of viruses--should have seen the obvious sooner. Just like----\"  His lips turned up a little at the corners and the Chiara of the dead past smiled for the last time at Lake.  \"Just like a damned fool intern....\"  That was all, then, and the chamber was suddenly very quiet. Lake stood up to leave, and to speak the words that Chiara could never hear:  \"We're going to need you and miss you--Doctor.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He found Bemmon in the food storage cavern, supervising the work of two teen-age boys with critical officiousness although he was making no move to help them. At sight of Lake he hurried forward, the ingratiating smile sliding across his face.  \"I'm glad you're back,\" he said. \"I had to take charge when Anders got sick and he had everything in such a mess. I've been working day and night to undo his mistakes and get the work properly under way again.\"  Lake looked at the two thin-faced boys who had taken advantage of the opportunity to rest. They leaned wearily against the heavy pole table Bemmon had had them moving, their eyes already dull with the incipient sickness and watching him in mute appeal.  \"Have you obeyed Chiara's order?\" he asked.  \"Ah--no,\" Bemmon said. \"I felt it best to ignore it.\"  \"Why?\" Lake asked.  \"It would be a senseless waste of our small supply of fruit and vegetable foods to give them to people already dying. I'm afraid\"--the ingratiating smile came again--\"we've been letting him exercise an authority he isn't entitled to. He's really hardly more than a medical student and his diagnoses are only guesses.\"  \"He's dead,\" Lake said flatly. \"His last order will be carried out.\"  He looked from the two tired boys to Bemmon, contrasting their thinness and weariness with the way Bemmon's paunch still bulged outward and his jowls still sagged with their load of fat.  \"I'll send West down to take over in here,\" he said to Bemmon. \"You come with me. You and I seem to be the only two in good health here and there's plenty of work for us to do.\"  The fawning expression vanished from Bemmon's face. \"I see,\" he said. \"Now that I've turned Anders's muddle into organization, you'll hand my authority over to another of your favorites and demote me back to common labor?\"  \"Setting up work quotas for sick and dying people isn't organization,\" Lake said. He spoke to the two boys, \"Both of you go lie down. West will find someone else.\" Then to Bemmon, \"Come with me. We're both going to work at common labor.\"  They passed by the cave where Bemmon slept. Two boys were just going into it, carrying armloads of dried grass to make a mattress under Bemmon's pallet. They moved slowly, heavily. Like the two boys in the food storage cave they were dull-eyed with the beginning of the sickness.  Lake stopped, to look more closely into the cave and verify something else he thought he had seen: Bemmon had discarded the prowler skins on his bed and in their place were soft wool blankets; perhaps the only unpatched blankets the Rejects possessed.  \"Go back to your caves,\" he said to the boys. \"Go to bed and rest.\"  He looked at Bemmon. Bemmon's eyes flickered away, refusing to meet his.  \"What few blankets we have are for babies and the very youngest children,\" he said. His tone was coldly unemotional but he could not keep his fists from clenching at his sides. \"You will return them at once and sleep on animal skins, as all the men and women do. And if you want grass for a mattress you will carry it yourself, as even the young children do.\"  Bemmon made no answer, his face a sullen red and hatred shining in the eyes that still refused to meet Lake's.  \"Gather up the blankets and return them,\" Lake said. \"Then come on up to the central cave. We have a lot of work to do.\"  He could feel Bemmon's gaze burning against his back as he turned away and he thought of what John Prentiss had once said:  \"I know he's no good but he never has guts enough to go quite far enough to give me an excuse to whittle him down.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Barber's men arrived the next day, burdened with dried herbs. These were given to the seriously ill as a supplement to the ration of fruit and vegetable foods and were given, alone, to those not yet sick. Then came the period of waiting; of hoping that it was all not too late and too little.  A noticeable change for the better began on the second day. A week went by and the sick were slowly, steadily, improving. The not-quite-sick were already back to normal health. There was no longer any doubt: the Ragnarok herbs would prevent a recurrence of the disease.  It was, Lake thought, all so simple once you knew what to do. Hundreds had died, Chiara among them, because they did not have a common herb that grew at a slightly higher elevation. Not a single life would have been lost if he could have looked a week into the future and had the herbs found and taken to the caves that much sooner.  But the disease had given no warning of its coming. Nothing, on Ragnarok, ever seemed to give warning before it killed.  Another week went by and hunters began to trickle in, gaunt and exhausted, to report all the game going north up the plateau and not a single creature left below. They were the ones who had tried and failed to withstand the high elevation of the plateau. Only two out of three hunters returned among those who had challenged the plateau. They had tried, all of them, to the best of their ability and the limits of their endurance.  The blue star was by then a small sun and the yellow sun blazed hotter each day. Grass began to brown and wither on the hillsides as the days went by and Lake knew summer was very near. The last hunting party, but for Craig's and Schroeder's, returned. They had very little meat but they brought with them a large quantity of something almost as important: salt.  They had found a deposit of it in an almost inaccessible region of cliffs and canyons. \"Not even the woods goats can get in there,\" Stevens, the leader of that party, said. \"If the salt was in an accessible place there would have been a salt lick there and goats in plenty.\"  \"If woods goats care for salt the way Earth animals do,\" Lake said. \"When fall comes we'll make a salt lick and find out.\"  Two more weeks went by and Craig and Schroeder returned with their surviving hunters. They had followed the game to the eastern end of the snow-capped mountain range but there the migration had drawn away from them, traveling farther each day than they could travel. They had almost waited too long before turning back: the grass at the southern end of the plateau was turning brown and the streams were dry. They got enough water, barely, by digging seep holes in the dry stream beds.  Lake's method of stalking unicorns under the concealment of a woods goat skin had worked well only a few times. After that the unicorns learned to swing downwind from any lone woods goats. If they smelled a man inside the goat skin they charged him and killed him.  With the return of the last hunters everything was done that could be done in preparation for summer. Inventory was taken of the total food supply and it was even smaller than Lake had feared. It would be far from enough to last until fall brought the game back from the north and he instituted rationing much stricter than before.  The heat increased as the yellow sun blazed hotter and the blue sun grew larger. Each day the vegetation was browner and a morning came when Lake could see no green wherever he looked.  They numbered eleven hundred and ten that morning, out of what had so recently been four thousand. Eleven hundred and ten thin, hungry scarecrows who, already, could do nothing more than sit listlessly in the shade and wait for the hell that was coming. He thought of the food supply, so pitifully small, and of the months it would have to last. He saw the grim, inescapable future for his charges: famine. There was nothing he could do to prevent it. He could only try to forestall complete starvation for all by cutting rations to the bare existence level.  And that would be bare existence for the stronger of them. The weaker were already doomed.  He had them all gather in front of the caves that evening when the terrace was in the shadow of the ridge. He stood before them and spoke to them:  \"All of you know we have only a fraction of the amount of food we need to see us through the summer. Tomorrow the present ration will be cut in half. That will be enough to live on, just barely. If that cut isn't made the food supply will be gone long before fall and all of us will die.  \"If anyone has any food of any kind it must be turned in to be added to the total supply. Some of you may have thought of your children and kept a little hidden for them. I can understand why you should do that--but you must turn it in. There may possibly be some who hid food for themselves, personally. If so, I give them the first and last warning: turn it in tonight. If any hidden cache of food is found in the future the one who hid it will be regarded as a traitor and murderer.  \"All of you, but for the children, will go into the chamber next to the one"]]]
