The three officers named withdrew to a corner of the ward-room, where they conversed in low tones, after which they returned to their seats.  \"Gentlemen,\" announced the executive officer, \"the committee has discussed the problem submitted to it, and the members of the committee are unanimously agreed that Mr. Barnes fairly and fully incurred the penalty that he himself suggested the other morning.\"  Barnes snorted, but was quick to recover sufficiently to bow in the direction of the executive officer.  \"Then I accept the decision, sir,\" announced the lieutenant huskily. \"At the close of the meal I will pay thirty-three dollars into the mess treasury.\"  Barnes tried to look comfortable, but he refused to glance in the direction of Danny Grin.  \"Did I catch him?\" whispered Dalzell to his chum.  \"You did,\" Dave agreed quickly. \"Barnes must feel pretty sore over the way his plan turned out.\"  There was much laughter during the rest of the meal, and Barnes had to stand for much chaffing, which he bore with a somewhat sullen look. As the officers rose none offered to leave the ward-room. All stood by waiting to see Barnes hand thirty-three dollars to the paymaster.  \"Here is the money,\" announced Barnes, handing a little wad of bills to the paymaster.  \"Count it, Pay!\" piped a voice from the rear of the crowd, but it was not Dan who spoke.  Lieutenant Barnes had the grace to leave the ward-room without stamping, but in the nearest passageway he encountered Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell.  \"I suppose you are chuckling over the way I dropped right into your trap,\" snapped Barnes to Dan. \"But do you call it a fair kind of trap?\"  \"What was the committee's decision on the subject?\" inquired Dan, softly.  \"Oh, I'll admit that the decision went against me,\" answered the lieutenant, scowling. \"How will you like it if I promise to pay you back fully for that trick? Are you willing that I should?\"  \"If your mind is set on paying me back,\" Danny Grin responded, \"then my willingness would have very little to do with your conduct. But I am willing to make you a promise, sir.\"  \"What is that?\" asked the lieutenant, quite testily.  \"If you attempt to pay me back, sir, and succeed, I'll agree to take my medicine with an appearance of greater good humor than you displayed a few minutes ago.\"  \"Huh!\" sniffed Mr. Barnes.  \"Danny boy,\" broke in Dave, \"I don't want to spoil a pleasant conversation, but I would like to remind you that, if we are to make much of our evening ashore, we shall do well to change to 'cits' at once. The launch leaves the side in fifteen minutes.\"  \"You'll excuse me, won't you, sir?\" begged Dalzell, favoring the lieutenant with an extremely pleasant smile.  The chums went to their respective cabins, where they quickly made the change from uniform to citizen's dress, commonly called \"cits.\"  Promptly the launch left the \"Hudson's\" side, but both young ensigns were aboard. At least a dozen other officers and a score of seamen were also aboard the launch, which was to return for forty more seamen who held the coveted shore leave.  Yet the reader is not to suppose that either officers or men were going ashore with any notion of gambling. An American naval officer, with his status of \"officer and gentleman,\" would risk a severe rebuke from his commanding officer if he were to seat himself to play in any gambling resort. As for the enlisted men, the \"jackies,\" they are not of the same piece of cloth as the jovial, carousing seamen of the old-time Navy. The \"jackies\" of to-day are nearly all extremely youthful; they are clean-cut, able, ambitious young fellows, much more inclined to study than to waste their time in improper resorts.  So, while most of the officers and men now going ashore were likely to drop in at the Casino, for the sake of seeing the sights there, it was not in the least to be feared that any would engage in the gambling games.  When the launch landed in the little harbor, drivers of automobiles and carriages clamored for fares.  \"Are we going to ride up to the Casino?\" Dan asked his chum.  \"If you'd rather,\" Dave assented. \"But, unless you feel tired, let us stroll along and see every bit of the way.\"  \"These natives are all jabbering French,\" complained Dalzell, as the chums set out to walk over the steep, well-worn roads, \"but it isn't the kind of French we were taught at Annapolis.\"  \"Can't you understand them?\" asked Dave.  \"Hardly a word.\"  \"If you have to talk with any of the natives,\" Dave advised, \"speak your French slowly, and ask the person you're addressing to do the same.\"  Though the way was steep, it was not a long road. Dave and Dan soon reached the upper, rocky plain, edged by cliffs, on which the Casino and some of the hotels and other buildings stand.  \"If it weren't for the gambling,\" murmured Dan to his friend, \"I'd call this a beautiful enough spot to live and die in.\"  \"As it is, a good many men and women manage to die here,\" Darrin returned gravely.  The Casino was surrounded by beautiful gardens, in which were many rare tropical trees and shrubs. From the Casino came the sound of orchestral music. Throngs moved about on the verandas; couples or little groups strolled through the gardens. Inside, the play had hardly begun. Gambling does not reach its frantic height until midnight.  \"We shall feel out of place,\" mused Dave aloud. \"Dan, we really should have known better than to come here in anything but evening dress. You see that every one else is in full regalia.\"  \"Perhaps we'd better keep on the edge of the crowd,\" responded Danny Grin. \"There is enough to be seen here, for one evening, without entering the Casino.\"  Though Dave intended to enter the Casino later, he decided, for the present, to take in the full beauty of the night in the gardens. There were electric lights everywhere, which outshone the brilliance of the moon.  \"Hello!\" whispered Dan, suddenly. \"There's an old friend of ours.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Mr. Green Hat,\" Dan whispered impressively.  Instantly Dave Darrin became intensely interested, though he had no intimation of what this second meeting portended. That Mr. Green Hat was destined to play a highly tragic rôle in his life, Darrin, of course, had no inkling at that moment.  \"There he is!\" whispered Dalzell, pointing, as the chums stood screened by a flowering bush.  \"We'll watch that rascal!\" Dave proposed promptly. \"I wonder if he has followed the 'Hudson' here with a view to attempting more mischief against our Government. Whatever his game is, I am going to take a peep at the inside of it if a chance comes my way!\"     CHAPTER IV  MR. GREEN HAT'S NEW RÔLE   Mr. Green Hat, on this occasion, had discarded the article of headwear that had given him that nickname with the young ensigns.  Instead, Gortchky wore an opera hat, with evening dress of the most fashionable description. On his broad white expanse of vest there glittered a foreign decoration.  Though he walked alone, and affected an air of indifference to his surroundings, Darrin was of the impression that the spy was looking alertly for some one.  \"Of course it may happen,\" said Dave to his friend, \"that the fellow is foolish enough to come here for the purpose of throwing away at the gaming tables the money he earns by his questionable services to some plotting international ring. Yet that seems hardly likely, either, for Gortchky must be a man of tremendous energy, to render the thrilling services that are demanded of a spy or an international trouble-maker.\"  Now the two chums left the place where they had been standing behind the bush, to stroll along slowly, all the while keeping Gortchky in sight.  Dave nudged his chum as, at a turn in the path, the spy came face to face with a woman clad in a beautiful evening gown.  Raising his hat, and making a courteous bow to the woman, who returned the greeting, Gortchky exchanged half a dozen sentences with her. Then the pair separated, though not before Dave and Dan had obtained, under the electric light, a good view of the young woman's face. Her dark beauty, her height and grace, gave her a queenly air.  Stepping into another path, Dave and Dan were soon on the trail of Gortchky once more, without having been obliged to pass the young woman face to face.  \"I wonder if she's a 'spy-ess'?\" murmured Dan.  \"It is just as well to be suspicious of any one whom Gortchky appears to know well,\" Dave answered, slowly, in a low voice.  \"I beg pardon, sir,\" broke in a sailor from the \"Hudson,\" stepping forward and saluting the officers. \"May I speak with you, sir?\"  It was Dan to whom he spoke, and it was Dan who answered:  \"Certainly, Martin.\"  [Illustration: \"The spy came face to face with a woman.\"]  Martin was one of the gun-pointers in Dalzell's division.  \"Linton, one of our men, has been hurt, and rather badly, by falling off a boulder that he climbed not far from here, sir. I thought I would ask the ensign what to do with Linton.\"  \"How badly is he hurt?\" asked Ensign Dalzell.  \"I think his right leg is broken, sir. Colby is with him, and I came in search of you, sir, as I was certain I saw you here.\"  \"Is Linton far from here?\" asked Dalzell.  \"Less than a quarter of a mile, sir.\"  \"Lead the way, Martin, and I'll follow you. Dave, you'll excuse me for a little while, won't you?\"  \"Certainly,\" nodded Ensign Darrin. Dave wished to remain where he was, in order to keep an eye over Gortchky's movements, and Dan knew it. So the chums parted for the present.  \"Now, I'll see if I can pick up Gortchky again,\" reflected Ensign Darrin. \"He appears to have given me the slip.\"  Dave went ahead, more briskly than he had been moving before, in the hope of sighting the spy.  Out of the Casino had staggered a young man, despair written on his face, hopelessness in his very air. Plunging into the garden this stranger made his way hastily through it, keeping on until he came to the field where"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22431"],["title","Dave Darrin on Mediterranean Service; or, With Dan Dalzell on European Duty (#6)"],["body","shoots are held from time to time.  Dave, at the edge of the garden, saw the young man step past the shrubbery and go on into the darkness beyond. Under the last rays of light Ensign Darrin saw something glitter in the stranger's hand.  \"That fellow has just drawn a revolver!\" flashed through Darrin's mind. \"Now, what mischief can he be up to?\"  Led onward by some fascination that he did not understand, the young naval officer followed.  In his excitement and desperation the man did not notice that he was being followed.  Halting under the heavy foliage of a tree, the stranger glanced down at the weapon in his hand and shuddered. This foolish young man, haunting the gambling tables until he had ruined himself, and seeing nothing now ahead of him in life, was bent upon self-destruction.  Sometimes there are several such suicides at Monte Carlo in a single week. If unprovided with other means for ending his life, the suicide sometimes hurls himself over the edge of one of the steep cliffs.  Suicides, of course, have a depressing effect on other players, so those in authority at the Casino take every means of hushing up these tragedies as effectively as possible.  \"There is really nothing left in life,\" muttered the young man huskily, as he stared at the weapon in his hand. He spoke in French, but Darrin heard and understood him.  Then the desperate one raised the weapon, pointing the muzzle at his head.  At that instant there was a quick step out of the darkness, and Dave reached the stranger. The latter, startled, drew back, but not in time to prevent Darrin's grip of steel from resting on his right wrist.  Wrench! Dave had the pistol in his own hands, at the same time murmuring:  \"You will pardon me, I trust.\"  Ensign Darrin broke the weapon open at the breach. From the chamber he removed the cartridges, dropping them into his pocket. With another swift movement Dave flung the pistol so far that it dropped over the edge of a cliff.  \"You will pardon me, I trust, sir, for throwing your property away in that fashion,\" Dave apologized, in the best French he could summon.  \"Since it is the very last item of my property that was left to me, perhaps it can matter but little that I am deprived of it,\" said the stranger, smiling wanly. \"The cliff is still left to me, however. I can easily follow the pistol.\"  \"But you are not going to jump over the cliff,\" Darrin assured him energetically.  \"And why are you so certain of that?\" demanded the stranger.  Dave looked keenly at his companion before he replied:  \"Because, sir, your face is that of a man--not of a coward. Suicide is the act of a coward. It is the resort of one who frankly admits that his troubles are greater than he has the manhood to bear. Now, you have, when one regards you closely, the look of a man and a gentleman.\"  \"Thank you for your good opinion, sir,\" replied the stranger, bowing. \"I will say that I was born a gentleman.\"  \"And you still are one, and a man, as well as a gentleman,\" Dave continued, gently. \"Therefore, you are not afraid to face life.\"  \"What is there left to me to make life worth living?\" queried the stranger.  \"Why should you have the least desire to die?\" Dave countered.  \"I have lost all my money.\"  \"That is a very slight matter,\" Darrin argued. \"Lost all your money, have you? Why, my dear fellow, there's a lot more in the world.\"  \"But none of the money now in the world is mine,\" urged the desperate one.  \"Then make a part of the world's money yours,\" the young naval officer retorted, smilingly.  \"I have never worked,\" replied the stranger stiffly.  \"Why not?\" Dave pressed.  \"I never had need to.\"  \"But now you have the need, and working for money will bring some novelty into your life,\" the young ensign insisted.  \"Did I not tell you that I was born a gentleman?\" inquired the young man, raising his eyebrows. \"A gentleman never works!\"  \"Some gentlemen don't,\" Dave admitted. \"But they are the wrong kind of gentlemen.\"  \"If I mistake not,\" quizzed the stranger keenly, \"you are a gentleman, yourself.\"  \"I trust that I am,\" Dave responded gravely.  \"Then do you work?\"  \"More hours a day than any laborer does,\" Darrin answered promptly. \"I am a naval officer.\"  \"Ah, but that is a career of honor--of glory!\" cried the stranger.  \"And so is any honest job of work that a man takes up in earnest and carries through to the best of his ability,\" Dave Darrin returned with warmth.  \"But you see, sir,\" argued the stranger, though now he was smiling, \"you have been trained to a profession. I never was so trained.\"  \"You are young?\"  \"Twenty-four.\"  \"Then you are young enough to change your mind and recognize the dignity of labor,\" Darrin continued. \"You are also young enough and, unless I mistake you, bright enough to win a very good place in life for yourself. And you are man enough, now you have had time to think it over, to see the wickedness of destroying yourself. Man, _make_ yourself instead.\"  \"I'll do it! I will make myself!\" promised the stranger, with a new outburst of emotion.  \"And you will never again allow yourself to become so downcast that you will seek to destroy yourself?\"  \"Never!\"  \"I am satisfied,\" Dave said gravely. \"You are a man of honor, and therefore are incapable of breaking your word. Your hand!\"  Their hands met in ardent clasp. Then Darrin took out his card case, tendering his card to the stranger.  Instantly the young man produced his own card case, and extended a bit of pasteboard, murmuring:  \"I am M. le Comte de Surigny, of Lyons, France.\"  It was too dark to read the cards there, but Dave gave his own name, and again the young men shook hands.  \"But I am forgetting my comrade,\" Dave cried suddenly. \"He was to return in a few minutes, and will not know where to find me.\"  \"And I have detained you, with my own wretched affairs!\" cried the young count reproachfully. \"I must not trespass upon your time another second.\"  \"Why not walk along with me and meet my friend?\" Dave suggested.  \"With pleasure.\"  Dave and the young French count stepped along briskly until they came to the spot where Dalzell had left his chum. Two or three minutes later Dan hove into sight.  Dan and the Count of Surigny were introduced, and some chat followed. Then the Count frankly told of the service that Darrin had just rendered him.  \"That is Dave!\" glowed Dan. \"He's always around in time to be of use to some one.\"  In the distance a shot rang out--only one. The Count of Surigny shuddered.  \"You understand, do you not?\" he asked.  \"I am afraid so,\" Dave sadly responded.  As they stood there four men with a litter hurried past toward the place whence the sound of the shot had come.  \"The police of Monte Carlo,\" murmured the Count of Surigny.  Presently, at a distance, the three onlookers beheld the four men and the litter moving stealthily along, but not toward the Casino. The litter was occupied by a still form over which a cover had been thrown.  \"You have shown me the way of true courage!\" murmured the Count of Surigny, laying an affectionate hand on Ensign Darrin's shoulder.  The chums and their new acquaintance strolled along for a few moments. Then the Count suddenly exclaimed:  \"But I am intruding, and must leave you.\"  \"You surely are not intruding,\" Dave told him. \"We are delighted with your company.\"  \"Wholly so,\" Dan added.  But the Count felt himself to be an interloper, and so insisted on shaking hands again and taking his departure.  \"I shall see or write you presently,\" said the Count. He had already obtained the fleet address, and knew, in addition, that he could write at any time through the Navy Department at Washington.  \"Will he make good?\" asked Danny Grin wistfully, as he peered after the departing form.  \"It's an even chance,\" Dave replied. \"Either that young man will go steadily up, or else he will go rapidly down. It is sometimes a terrible thing to be born a gentleman--in the European sense. Few of the Count's friends will appreciate him if he starts in upon a career of effort. But, even though he goes down, he will struggle bravely at the outset. Of that I feel certain.\"  \"I wonder what has become of Gortchky?\" remarked Ensign Dalzell.  That industrious spy, however, was no longer the pursued; he had become the pursuer.  From a little distance Gortchky had espied Dave and the Count chatting, and had witnessed the introduction to Dalzell. A man of Mr. Green Hat's experience with the world did not need many glances to assure himself that the Count had lost his last franc at the gambling table.  Gortchky was not at Monte Carlo without abundant assistance. So, as the Count, head down, and reflecting hard, strolled along one of the paths, a man bumped into him violently.  \"Ten thousand pardons, Monsieur!\" cried the bumper, in a tone of great embarrassment. \"It was stupid of me. I--\"  \"Have no uneasiness, my friend,\" smiled the Count. \"It was I who was stupid. I should have looked where I was going.\"  Courteous bows were exchanged, and the two separated. But the man who had bumped into the Count now carried inside his sleeve the Count's empty wallet, which was adorned with the crest of Surigny.  This wallet was promptly delivered to another. Five minutes later, as the Count strolled along, Emil Gortchky called out behind him:  \"Monsieur! Pardon me, but I think you must have dropped your wallet.\"  \"If I have, the loss is trifling indeed,\" smiled the Count, turning.  Gortchky held out the wallet, then struck a match. By the flame the Count beheld his own crest.  \"Yes, it is mine,\" replied the Count, \"and I thank you for your kindness.\"  \"Will Monsieur do me the kindness, before I leave him, to make sure that the contents of the wallet are intact?\" urged Gortchky.  \"It will take but an instant,\" laughed the Count of Surigny. \"See! I will show you that the contents are intact!\"  As he spoke he opened the wallet. A packet of paper dropped to the ground. In astonishment the Count bent over to pick up the packet. M."]]]
