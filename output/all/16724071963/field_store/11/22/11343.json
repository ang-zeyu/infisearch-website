And yet in spite of all this they were genuine boys, with warm hearts, and fond of practical joking. Seated around the jolly fire after disposing of supper, while the two guides attended to cleaning up, Jimmy entertained his mates with a series of rollicking songs, accompanied by Teddy on his mandolin, which he had somehow managed to smuggle along, in spite of a careful watch on the part of Ned, who did not wish to take a single article that was not indispensable, for he knew the gigantic task that lay ahead of them.  Jimmy has as usual been overboard during the late afternoon. It was not a voluntary swim the comical chum had been enjoying, either; these plunges never were, but it seemed as though Jimmy must lose his balance once in so often just while the canoes were negotiating through some wild rapids, and in consequence he had to make the passage clinging to the gunwale.  His red sweater was hanging on a bush to dry in the heat of the fire. It looked unusually brilliant as seen in the glow of the leaping flames. Jimmy was very proud of that same old sweater, which had been with him through so many campaigns that it showed signs of wear and tear. But though he had another nice navy-blue one in his waterproof clothes bag, Jimmy persisted in donning the ancient article every blessed day, in spite of the appeals of his chums.  Ned as usual was poring over his well-thumbed chart. Every day he marked the new ground they had covered, and very seldom had he found cause to doubt the correctness of the two guides. And whenever this had happened it turned out that they were right, and the map wrong.  \"Well,\" Frank finally broke out with, \"so far we haven't run across anything in the shape of a rival expedition, though Ned seemed to think in the start that was what would happen to us.\"  \"I haven't changed my mind yet,\" observed the party mentioned, looking up from examining his chart. \"We understood that the syndicate that is trying to unload this wonderful new mining tract they claim will be richer than Mesauba on Jack's father as a speculation, knew about our being sent up here on some secret mission. They could easily guess that we meant to find out if half of the big claim they made was true, and that on our report Mr. Bosworth would base any action he might take. Now it was to be such a tremendously big deal that under the conditions, if so be there was something crooked about the claims they made, you can understand that it would pay them handsomely to shunt us off the track, or else salt the mine, and make us think it would be as rich a proposition as their prospectus set out.\"  \"But,\" interrupted Jack, \"who could they get to do their crooked work away up here in this forlorn country, where we haven't run across a living being since we met that trapper going south with his winter's catch of pelts?\"  \"Oh! money will do lots of things,\" answered Ned. \"Given a soft berth, with good pay, and plenty to eat, and scores of Indian half-breeds, timber cruisers, guides out of employment along the salmon fishing streams of the Dominion, and trappers loafing through an off season, would jump at the bait. There'd be plenty to enlist under the lead of a bold man hired by the syndicate; if, as we more than half believe, their claim is a great swindle which they mean to hang about Jack's father's neck.\"  \"Francois says we will always have to be prepared, and as that is the motto of Boy Scouts all over the known world, it isn't likely to seem new to us,\" Frank Shaw remarked, a little boastfully it must be confessed, for having passed through so many strange happenings in times past had given him a touch of what Jimmy was inclined to call the \"swelled head,\" though any one would have been justified for feeling proud of such a record of wonderful things accomplished.  The scouts having started on the subject of their mission continued to discuss it from various angles. In this way they often hit upon suggestions, because one remark would bring out another until some fellow chanced to open up a new field of conjecture.  They were deep in the matter, and all taking a hand in the discussion, when Francois, the dark-faced voyageur, suddenly started to his knees with a cry of warning. At the same time the boys became aware of the fact that a strange rushing and pounding noise was rapidly bearing down upon the little camp on the river bank.  Jimmy happened to be sitting cross-legged like a Turk, a favorite attitude of his, and becoming excited he could not get up as rapidly as his chums.  In consequence of this he seemed to be in the way of some huge body that rushed the camp, scattering the fire, and rending the branches of the tree under which the exploring party had settled for the night.  It was all over in a few seconds. The camp was in an uproar, one of the tents down flat, the fire in danger of communicating to the brush, and Jimmy squealing on his back, where the sudden rush of the mysterious monster had thrown him.     CHAPTER II.  A WILD CHARGE.   \"Help! Help!\" Jimmy was shouting, kicking wildly as he roared. \"Keep off me, you wild elephant! Somebody shoot him, quick, before he steps on me!\"  \"Here, stop that kicking, if you want to be helped up, do you hear, Jimmy!\" exclaimed Frank, who had hastened to the assistance of the comrade in distress. \"Are you much hurt; and did the beast trample on you any?\"  Jimmy began to feel of his legs and arms, and upon discovering himself apparently as sound as a dollar, grinned sheepishly. Meanwhile the two guides had hastened, with the help of Ned and Jack, to gather the fire together again. Teddy had snatched up the nearest rifle and was down on one knee, peering out through the semi-darkness as though anticipating a return rush on the part of the unknown monster that had created such confusion in the camp.  \"No great damage done, after all, seems like, if Jimmy says he's all right,\" remarked Ned, now beginning to let a broad smile creep over his face, for seeing Jimmy doubled up and had been a ludicrous spectacle not soon to be forgotten.  \"But what in creation was it that put the kibosh all over me like that?\" demanded the one who had been knocked over by the mad rush of the invader.  Ned glanced toward Francois, and the voyageur simply said:  \"Bull moose--him very much mad, charge camp like that!\"  \"Well, I should think he must have been,\" Frank Shaw declared. \"Why, if we'd had a little more warning we might have met him with a volley of hot lead that'd have laid him out dead. Now that Francois says so, I do believe he looked pretty much on the order of a monstrous moose bull. I certainly saw his horns, and they were full grown, because the rutting season is long since past.\"  \"But what makes a moose get his mad up?\" Jack asked. \"We didn't do a single thing to rile him, that I know of, but were sitting here as easy as you please, when all at once he charges through the camp. Why, say, he nearly carried off some of our property, when he knocked down that tent. Look at the rip his horns made in the tanned canvas, would you? Some more sewing for Teddy here, to mend the rip.\"  \"Francois, do bull moose often act in that way?\" asked Teddy, still gripping the repeating rifle, as though not fully convinced that their would be no repetition of the savage onslaught.  The guide shook his head.  \"Know only few times when it happen, and then there be reason. He carry off on horns what makes him rush our camp. I saw the same with my own eyes. Bull moose much like farm bull, and hate ze red color ver' mooch.\"  At hearing this several of the boys gave a shout.  \"There, see what you get, Jimmy, for keeping that silly red sweater around. The old bull saw it hanging there in the light of our fire, and it made him so furious, as it has us lots of times, that he lowered his head and just charged us.\"  \"But he took it away with him, as sure as you live, fellows!\" gasped Jimmy, as a sense of his deep affliction came over him. \"My dear sweater that I loved so much.\"  \"Bully for the moose!\" cried Jack.  \"He'd done us all a mighty good turn, even if he never meant to,\" added Frank, \"now we've seen the last of that terrible old garment, and Jimmy'll just _have_ to get out the nice new one he's been carrying in his bag.\"  \"Just think of the old fool, would you, a-tearin' around the woods with that red flag hanging from his horns,\" Jimmy wailed. \"Don't I hope it keeps him wild right along, so that he'll smash into a tree, and break his blessed neck! But I'm glad he didn't take a notion to carry me off along with my sweater, and that's no lie!\"  The little excitement soon died away. Not much damage had been done after all by that mad charge of the infuriated bull moose. The rent in the canvas could be readily mended, and as for Jimmy's loss it was his companions' gain, so that there would be no lament made save by the late owner.  \"I didn't know moose ever roamed as far north as this,\" remarked Ned.  \"How about that, Francois?\" asked Frank, who, it might be noticed, kept his gun close beside him now, as though meaning to be ready in case another cause for excitement arose.  \"It is not often zat ze bull moose come up here,\" replied the French Canadian, in his queer patois; \"but sometimes in summer zey wander far afield. I haf seen ze same so mooch as three hundred mile north from here.\"  \"One thing sure, there are plenty of caribou around,\" Teddy went on to say; \"and when the meat's tender, it suits me all right. I'm running across new things every day up here, and don't feel sorry I came, so far.\"  \"New things seem to be running across us also,\" chuckled Frank; \"for instance, the monster that just invaded our camp. But as our supply of red sweaters has given out now, we'll hope not "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22674"],["title","Boy Scouts on Hudson Bay; Or, The Disappearing Fleet (#2)"],["body","have a repeat of that charge in a hurry.\"  \"Me for a tree if ever I hear anything on four legs heading this way again!\" Jimmy told them. \"Why, what would have happened to me if the old four flusher had set his hoofs square on my stomach? I'd be feeling pretty punk right now, believe me.\"  \"I think I'll take to the tall timber myself if this thing gets common,\" was what Jack observed. \"My stars! but he was a whopper. Looked like the side of a house to me when he sizzled past, scattering the fire, leveling our best tent, and kicking up a whole circus with a band wagon attached.\"  \"What was it we were talking about when we had that unexpected call?\" asked Teddy.  \"Ned was telling us something more that trapper we met said to him about the queer things that happen away up here in this uninhabited country, which is so different from any other known land. Didn't he say something about a phantom fleet of vessels that kept bobbing up every now and then, only to speed away like ghosts. What did you make of that silly rot, Ned?\"  \"I've been puzzling my head over it ever since,\" Ned replied, \"but for the life of me can't make head or tail of the story. I've almost come to the conclusion that the trapper was a little dippy, and just imagined he saw those vessels.\"  \"Sounds like it to me, Ned,\" Jack declared. \"Whatever would vessels of any kind want up in Hudson Bay, if not to fish, or hunt whales, or seals, or walrus? And why should they flit around like ghosts, as he said? Chances are the old chap was using up his surplus stock of strong drink, and saw things where they didn't exist.\"  \"Well, anyway,\" Jimmy ventured, reflectively, \"it's me that hopes we'll run foul of this same queer disappearing fleet, because if we do it's a pipe cinch we'll scrape all the mystery off the story. We always manage that when we start into anything. It seems to be the scout way of doing things.\"  \"For my part,\" declared Frank, \"I take little stock in that yarn of the trapper. I imagine it's in a line with the big story of the mine syndicate that wants to unload on Mr. Bosworth. This is the country for whopping lies. Everything is on so big a scale up here, you know, stories have to keep along with them.\"  \"And moose are as big as houses,\" added Jimmy.  \"How is it we don't see you busy with your fish lines to-night, Jimmy?\" asked Ned.  \"Yes, it's been three mornings now since we had fresh fish for breakfast, and as that job was handed over to you, we all want to know what's gone wrong?\" Jack added.  Jimmy shrugged his shoulders, and made a wry face.  \"I've soured on me job, if that's what you want to know,\" he replied. \"I've pulled in so many fish since we started that me arm is sore with the work. Besides, I've lost me taste for fresh fish. Them that feel an itching for the diet c'n do the business. Here's me lines and hooks with pleasure.\"  No one, however, seemed anxious to undertake the task on this particular occasion. Truth to tell they were one and all pretty tired. It had been an unusually arduous day, so that shoulders and legs ached more or less, from packing all their possessions across country to the bank of the river on which they now found themselves, and which Francois, yes, and Tamasjo ditto, affirmed would carry them all the rest of the way to the great inland sea known on the maps as Hudson Bay, in honor of the famous explorer.  It felt good to lie there at their ease on blankets and enjoy the warmth of the cheery campfire. There was more or less of a tang in the air most of the time on account of being so far north; and this became more evident when the sun had set, and the short night commenced, so that the young explorers were glad to have tents and warm blankets along.  Once while they were talking Jack lifted his head and appeared to be listening.  \"A wolf pack hunting through the muskegs!\" remarked Ned.  \"Just what it must be,\" declared Jack. \"And wherever we go it seems as if there was no end to the hungry beasts. We ran up against them away out in California, you remember; and they've given us no end of trouble on this present trip.\"  \"I only hope that swift bunch is hustling along on the trail of Mr. Bull Moose, and that they overhaul the beggar right soon,\" grumbled Jimmy viciously.  \"What ails the little rascal now to make him feel so savage about that moose?\" laughed Frank.  \"Huh! if you had something you thought the world of carried away on the horns of a rotten old bull moose, mebbe it's you that would be feeling sore on him too, me boy,\" growled Jimmy.  \"Well, they say that one man's food is another's poison,\" observed Frank; \"and all of us feel that your loss is our gain. Red sweaters may be all very well on a baseball field, but in the woods they don't cut such a wide swath.\"  \"Forget it,\" added Jack.  The two guides were looking after the canoes. It was their customary habit to attend to the craft every night before lying down, because they realized the great value that lay in the only means of making progress that the expedition possessed; while no one dreamed of robbery, still, the motto of a scout is to shut the door _before_ the horse is stolen, and not afterwards. An ounce of prevention is always much better than a pound of cure, so Ned was accustomed to saying, and he was an experienced patrol leader.  While they left some things to the guides, still, the boys were pleased to keep constantly in touch with whatever was transpiring around them. Long ago they had learned to enjoy making fresh discoveries in the field and forest whenever abroad. And in this new and to them unexplored country they were running across numerous interesting things every day.  They had just two tents along, and as neither of the guides would consent to be under cover save in a rain storm, it allowed the five scouts a chance to sleep comfortably, three in one shelter and a couple in the other. Ned and Jack occupied the smaller tent, while Jimmy bunked with Teddy and Frank in the second one.  Presently the guides came into camp again, though they had been within sight all the time, as the canoes lay well inside the circle of light coming from the fire.  \"All well with the boats, Francois?\" asked Ned, who was hugging his knees now, and had been joking Frank over several weird pictures the photographer of the expedition had lately developed.  \"Everything O. K.,\" replied the voyageur, as though satisfied with his labor. \"No danger we lose same this night, zat is sure. Still, Francois, me, and ze ozzer guide we expect to sleep wiz ze one eye open.\"  \"If you should happen to see some stranger meddling with our boats, Francois--what would you do?\" asked Frank.  The voyageur shrugged his broad shoulders in a very Frenchy fashion as he replied.  \"I sall call out and ask ze same what he do, sare; and if so be he try to run away, pouf; I ze gun will fire, taking aim to vound ze rascal in ze leg, and not kill.\"  \"Sounds rather war-like, don't it, Ned?\" remarked Jack.  \"Well, you must remember that this is a wild country up here,\" the leader of the expedition went on to say, soberly; \"and that men are accustomed to looking on all others as enemies until they prove to be friends. A man who would sneak up and hover over our boats, on being addressed, if he were honest would throw up his hand at once and come into camp. Only a sneak thief would try and cut for it. And from my way of looking at it Francois would be justified in giving him a bullet in the leg, or a charge of Number Sevens in the last place he could see as the man galloped away.\"  As several of the scouts were yawning at a prodigious rate it was now concluded that the time had come to crawl under their blankets and get some sleep. This going to bed was never a very long-drawn-out operation with the scouts when in the open. Each boy would remove his shoes, after taking off his leggings, then follow with his outer garments, and after that just snuggle down under his warm covering, and forgetting all his troubles until the summons came that breakfast was almost ready.  On this especial occasion they vanished inside the tents, leaving the guides at the fire smoking their last pipe of tobacco, which both of them had to indulge in before they could think of sleeping.  After that none of the boys knew a single thing until they were rudely awakened by hearing some one call out roughly.  Immediately afterwards there came a peremptory hail, and then a loud report that must have come from a gun.  Of course there was a hustle in both tents, and it was astonishing how quickly each scout managed to get some of his clothes on. A professional fireman could hardly have shown more expedition about dressing than Ned and Jack did, though hampered more or less in the operation by the darkness.  They had been very careful to remember just where their guns had been placed, so that as soon as they donned clothes it was easy to snatch up these weapons, after which they burst out of the tent.  The fire was beginning to revive, showing that some one must have tossed fresh fuel upon the smouldering logs. One glance that way told Ned several hours must have elapsed since he lay down, and that it was even now long after midnight. He would have been able to tell within an hour what time of night it was, had he been given a few seconds to look up at the heavens to note the position of the new stars in sight.     CHAPTER III.  WAS IT A SPY?   The other fellows were coming crawling out from the larger tent when Ned and Jack reached the open air. All of them were carrying guns, as though laboring under an impression that the camp must be assailed by a rival force.  They found the two guides standing there, and peering out toward a certain quarter. Both were too old hands at this sort of thing to show the least sign of excitement, but Jimmy made up for any lack on their part.  \"For the love of Mike where's the invader now? Did he trample all over you, Francois, and is that the brand of his cloven hoof on"]]]
