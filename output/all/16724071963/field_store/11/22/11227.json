At the same moment, an irresistible impulse drew Christine's glance to Saltire in time to receive one of those straight, significant looks that indescribably disturbed her.  Nothing there of the impersonality his words had betrayed!  It was a clear message from a man to a woman--one of those messages that only very strong-willed people who know what they want have the frankness, perhaps the boldness, to send.  Even an indifferent woman would have been stirred to a knowledge of dangerous sweetness, and she knew that she had never been quite indifferent to the personal magnetism of Dick Saltire.  As it was, she was shaken to the very soul of her.  For a moment, she had the curious illusion that she had never lived before, never had been happy or unhappy, was safe at last in some sure, lovely harbour from all the hurts of the world.  It was strange in the midst of everyday happenings, with the talk and clatter of a meal going on, to be swept overwhelmingly away like that to a far place where only two people dwelt--she and the man who looked at her.  And before the illusion was past, she had returned a message to him.  She did not know what was in her look, but she knew what was in her heart.  Almost immediately it was time to take the children and go.  Mrs. van Cannan delayed them for a moment, giving some directions for the afternoon.  If Christine could have seen herself with the children clinging to her, she would have been surprised that she could appear so beautiful.  Her grace of carriage and well-bred face had always been remarkable, but gone were disdain and weariness from her.  She passed out of the room without looking again at Dick Saltire, though he rose, as always, to open the door for her.  An afternoon of such brazen heat followed that it was well to be within the shelter of the shuttered house.  But outside, in the turmoil of dust and glare, the work of the farm went on as usual.  Christine pictured Saltire at his implacable task, serene in spite of dust and blaze, with the quality of resolution in his every movement that characterized him, the quality he had power to put into his eyes and throw across a room to her.  The remembrance of his glance sent her pale, even now in the quiet house.  Only a strong man, sure of himself and with the courage of his wishes, would dare put such a message into his eyes, would dare call boldly and silently to a woman that _she_ was his _raison d'Ãªtre_, that, because of her, the dulness and monotony of life had never bored him less, that he had found her, that she must take of and give to him.  She knew now that he had been telling her these things ever since they had met, but that she had turned from the knowledge, until, at last, in an unguarded moment, it had reached and overwhelmed her, flooding her soul with passionate joy, yet filling her with a peace and security she had never known, either in the old farmhouse or since the long-ago day when all her brave castles of youth and love had crashed down into the dust.  Gone now was unbelief, and disdain, and fear of terror that stalked by night; a rock was at her back, there was a hand to hold in the blackest darkness.  Never any more need she feel fear and spiritual loneliness.  Withal, there was the passionate joy of adventure, of exploration in sweet, unknown lands of the heart, the launching of a boat upon a sea of dreams.  Life sang to Christine Chaine like a nightingale under the stars.  How tenderly and patiently she beguiled the heat-weary children throughout that long afternoon!  There was no feeling of haste upon her.  She knew that sweetness was travelling her way, that \"what is for thee, gravitates toward thee,\" and is vain to seek before the appointed hour.  It might come as even-song to a seemingly endless day, or dawn following a fearsome night.  But it was coming.  That was all that mattered!  The directions Mrs. van Cannan had given, as they left the luncheon, were to the effect that, when the siesta hour was over, the children were to have possession of the drawing-room until it was cool enough for them to go for their accustomed walk.  This plan was to continue as long as the hot weather lasted.  \"I think it is not very healthy for any of you,\" she said amiably, \"to stick all day in a room you have to sleep in at night.\"  Christine could not help being surprised at her giving up the coolest and quietest room in the house, and one that had hitherto been forbidden ground to the children.  However, here they were, installed among gaily cretonned furniture, the little girls dashing about like squirrels in a strange cage, Roddy, apparently more at home, prowling softly around, examining things with a reverent yet familiar air.  \"I remember when we used to come here every day,\" said Rita suddenly, and stood stock-still with concentrated eyes, like one trying to catch the memory of a dream.  \"When was it, Roddy?\"  He looked at her steadily.  \"When our old nannie was here.\"  Rita fixed her blue eyes on his.  \"There was someone else here, too,\" she insisted.  \"Sophy always brought us here,\" he repeated mechanically.  \"I remember old Sophy,\" murmured Rita thoughtfully.  \"She cried dreadfully when she went away.  She was not allowed to kiss us because she had turned all silver colour.\"  She trilled into gay laughter. \"Mamma told me that it might have turned us all silver, too.\"  \"I kissed her before she went, anyway!\" burst from Roddy fiercely. \"And I would not have cared if it had turned me to silver.\"  Christine glanced wonderingly at him, astonished at this new theme of silver.  \"But if she went away, how is it that she is buried here, Roddy?\"  \"She isn't.\"  \"But the grave we covered with portulaca--\"  She stopped abruptly, for the boy's face had assumed the look she could not bear--the look of enduring that only those hardened to life should know.  \"Come and listen to this story of a magic carpet on which two children were carried over strange lands and cities,\" she said gently, and drew them all round her, with an arm through Roddy's.  The windows and shutters were thrown open at sunset, and the children had their tea in the dining-room.  Afterward, they went for a long walk across the sands toward the kopjes, which had receded into distance again and in the west were turning purple with mauve tops.  But the rest of the sky was coloured a threatening greenish bronze, with monstrous-shaped clouds sprawled across it; and the air, though sunless, was still sand-laden and suffocating, with the promise of storm.  It would have been easy for Christine to take the children toward the vicinity in which Saltire was occupied and where he would now be putting up his instruments and dismissing his workers for the night, but some instinct half modest, half self-sacrificing made her postpone the happiness of seeing him again, and guided her feet in an opposite direction.  She was certain that, though he had refrained from dining at the farm except for the one night of Mr. van Cannan's departure, she would see him there that evening, and she dressed with special care and joy in the beauty of her hair, her tinted, curving face, and the subtle glamour that she knew she wore as the gift of happiness.  \"How sweet it is to be young and desirable--and desired by the one man in the world!\" was the half-formed thought in her mind as she combed her soft, cloudy black hair high above her face and fixed it with a tall amber comb.  But she would not converse too clearly with her heart.  Enough that she had heard it singing in her breast as she had never thought to hear it sing again.  She was glad of the excuse of the heavy heat to discard her usual black gown and be seen in a colour that she knew belonged to her by right of her black hair and violet eyes--a deep primrose-yellow of soft, transparent muslin.  Saltire was late for dinner, but he came, as she had known he would, taking his usual place next to Mrs. van Cannan and almost opposite Christine, who, for the evening meal, was always expected to sit at the main body of the table.  She was busy at the moment hearing from Mr. McNeil all about the process of ostrich-feather plucking which was to begin next day, but she did not miss a word of the late comer's apologies or the merry raillery with which they were met by his hostess.  The latter, as usual, gathered unto herself every remark uttered at the table, and the attentions of every man, though she never bothered much about old Andrew McNeil.  But if she had the lip-service, Christine was very well aware to whom was accorded, that night, the service of the eyes.  Every man there had become aware of the youth and beauty which, till that day, she had worn as if veiled, and they were paying the tribute that men will proffer until the end of time to those two gifts of the gods.  She knew it without vanity, but also without embarrassment, for she had tasted triumph before in a world more difficult to please than this, surrounded by opponents worthier of her steel than Isabel van Cannan.  The little triumph only pleased her in that she could offer it as a gift to the man she loved.  For here is another eternal truth, that all men are one in pride of possession of that which excites envy and admiration in other men.  All women know this with a gladness that is salted by sorrow.  Saltire's eyes were the only ones she could not meet with serenity. She felt his glance on her often, but always when she tried to lift "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22568"],["title","Blue Aloes: Stories of South Africa (#7)"],["body","to meet it, her lids seemed weighted by little heavy pebbles.  She meant to overcome this weakness, though, and look at him even as she had answered at noon; but, in the middle of dinner, while she yet strove against the physical inability, her resolution was disturbed by a strange occurrence.  A wild scream of fear and horror came ringing from the nursery.  Without a thought for anything but that it was Roddy's voice, Christine sprang from the table.  Down the long passage and into the nursery she ran, and, almost bursting into the room, caught the boy in her arms.  He was not screaming now, but white as death and staring with fearful eyes at the bed, on which the bedclothes were pulled back, with Meekie peering over it.  The two little girls, round-eyed and frightened, were sitting up in their cots.  For a moment, Roddy stayed rigid in her arms; then he hid his face against her arm and broke into convulsive sobs.  \"It's a big spider--all red and black--like the one that bit Bernard!\"  And, in fact, from where she stood, Christine could see the monstrous thing, with its black, furry claws, protruding eyes, and red-blotched body, still crouching there in a little hollow at the end of the bed. Only, the person leaning over examining it now was not Meekie but Saltire, who had reached the nursery almost on her heels.  \"I put my foot against it and touched its beastly fur!\" cried Roddy, and suddenly began to scream again.  \"Roddy!  How dare you make that abominable noise?\"  Mrs. van Cannan's voice fell like a jet of ice-cold water into the room.  Behind her in the doorway loomed the tall figure of Saxby, the manager, with McNeil and the others.  Christine's warm heart would never have suggested such a method of quieting the boy, but it had its points.  Roddy, though still shaking and ashen, stood up straight and looked at his mother.  \"All about a silly spider!\" continued the latter, with cutting scorn. \"I am ashamed of you!  I thought you were brave, like your father.\"  That flushed Roddy to his brows.  \"It has fur--red fur,\" he stammered.  \"You deserve a whipping for your cowardice,\" said Mrs. van Cannan curtly, and walked over to the bed.  \"The thing is half dead, and quite harmless,\" she said.  \"Half dead or half drunk,\" McNeil jocosely suggested.  \"I never saw a tarantula so quiet as that before.\"  \"The question is how long would it have stayed in that condition?\" said Saltire significantly.  \"For you are mistaken about its harmlessness, Mrs. van Cannan.  It is one of the most poisonous and ferocious of its tribe.\"  They had got the strangely sluggish beast off the bed by knocking it with a stick into an old shoe, and were removing it.  Christine only vaguely heard the remarks, for Roddy hid his eyes while it was being carried out, and was trembling violently against her.  It seemed amazing to her that Mrs. van Cannan did not realize that there was more than mere cowardice in his behaviour.  The trouble was so plainly psychological--the memory of the loss of a loved little brother subtly interwoven with horror of that particular species of venomous insect. Christine herself had a greater hatred of spiders than of any creeping things, and well understood the child's panic of disgust and fear.  It filled her with indignation to hear Mrs. van Cannan turn once more and lash the boy with a phrase before she swept from the room.  \"Miserable little coward!\"  In a moment, the girl was kneeling on the floor beside the unhappy child, holding him tight, whispering words of love and comfort.  \"No, no, darling; it is only that she does not understand!  We will explain to her--I will tell her later why you hated it so.  Wait till your daddy comes back.  I am sure he will understand.\"  So she strove to comfort him, while Meekie coaxed the little girls back to the horizontal attitude under their sheets.  \"Don't make me go back into that bed,\" whispered Roddy fearfully.  \"No; of course not.  Don't worry; just trust me, darling!\"  She turned to Meekie.  \"I will stay with them now, Meekie.  You may go.\"  \"But has the missy had her dinner?\" asked the Cape woman politely.  \"I have had all I want, thank you, Meekie.\"  The thought of going back to the dinner-table--to eat and join in the talk and laughter while this small boy whom she loved stayed alone with his wretchedness revolted her.  Perhaps later, when he slept, she might slip out into the garden for a while.  In the meantime, she beguiled him over to her own bed, and having taken off the coverlet to show him that it held no lurking horrors, she made him get in and curl up, and she knelt beside him, whispering softly so as not to disturb the others, reassuring him of her belief in his courage whilst understanding his horror, confessing her own hatred of spiders, but urging him to try and fight against his fear of them.  She told him stories of her own childhood, crooned little poems to him, and sang old songs softly, hoping and praying that he would presently fall asleep. But time slipped by, and he remained wide-eyed, gripping her hand tightly, and only by the slightest degrees relaxing the nervous rigour of his body under the coverlet.  Suddenly, he startled her by a strange remark:  \"If I could only get into the pink palace with Carol, I'd be all right.\"  The girl looked down into the distended pupils gazing so wistfully at her, and wondering what new psychological problem she had to deal with. She knew she must go very warily, or defeat her own longing to help him.  At last, she said very tenderly,  \"The world is full of pink palaces, Roddy, but we do not always find them until we are grown up.\"  He looked at her intently.  \"Carol found one at the bottom of the dam,\" he whispered slowly.  \"He is there now; it's only his body that is buried in the graveyard.\"  She smoothed his hair gently with her hand.  \"Carol is in a more beautiful palace than any we find here on earth, darling.\"  The secret, elfin expression crossed his face, but he said nothing.  \"And you must not believe that about the dam,\" she warned him gravely. \"There is nothing at the bottom of it but black mud, and deep water that would drown you, too, if you went in.\"  \"I _know_ the palace is there,\" he repeated doggedly.  \"I have seen it. The best time to see it is in the early morning or in the evening.  All the towers of it are pink then, and you can see the golden wings of the angels shining through the windows.\"  \"That is the reflection of the pink-and-gold clouds in the sky at dawn and sunset that you see, dear silly one.  Will you not believe me?\"  He squeezed her hand lovingly.  \"Mamma has seen it, too,\" he whispered.  \"You know she was with Carol when he fell in, and she saw him go into the door of the palace and be met by all the golden angels.  She tried to get him back, but she cannot swim, and then she came running home for help.  Afterward, they took Carol's body out and buried him, but, you know, he is really there still.  Mamma has seen him looking through the windows--she told me--but you must not tell any one.  It is very secret, and once I thought I saw him, too, beckoning to me.\"  Christine was staggered.  That so dangerous an illusion had been fostered by a mother was too bewildering, and she hardly knew how to meet and loyally fight it.  It did not take her long to decide.  With all the strength at her command, she set to work to clear away from his mind the whole fantastical construction.  He clung to it firmly at first, and, in the end, almost pleaded to be left with the belief that he had but to step down the dam wall and join his brother in the fair pink palace.  She realized now what tragedy had been lurking at her elbow all these days.  Remembering the day when she had caught him up at the brink of the dam, she turned cold as ice in the heat-heavy room. A moment later, she returned to her theme, her explanations, her prayers for a promise from him that never, never would he go looking again for a vision that did not exist.  At last he promised, and almost immediately fell asleep.  As for Christine Chaine, she stayed where she was on the floor, her head resting on the bed in sheer exhaustion, her limbs limp.  All thought of going into the garden had left her.  Sitting there, stiff-kneed and weary, she thought of Saltire's eyes, and realized that there had come and gone an evening which she must count for ever among the lost treasures of her life.  Yet she did not regret it as she rose at last and looked down by the dim light on the pale, beautiful, but composed little face on the pillow.  She lay long awake.  Roddy's bed was too short for her, and there was no ease in it, even had her mind and heart been at rest.  All the fantasies she had beguiled from the boy's brain had come to roost in her own, with a hundred other vivid and painful impressions.  The night, too, was fuller than usual of disquietude.  The wind, which had been rising steadily, now tore at the shutters and rushed shrieking through the trees.  There was a savage rumble of thunder among the hills, and, intermittently, lightning came through the shutter-slats.  When, above it all, she heard a gentle tapping, and sensed the whispering presence without, her cup of dreadful unease was full.  But she was not afraid.  She rose, as she had done one night before, and put on her dressing-gown.  For a while, standing close to the shutters, she strained her ears to catch the message whose import she knew so well.  The idea of speaking to someone or something as anxious as herself over Roddy had banished all horror.  She longed for an interview with the strange being without.  There was nothing to do but attempt, as before, to leave the house by the front door.  Down the long passage and through the dining-room she felt her way, moving noiselessly.  When she came to the door, she found it once again with the bar hanging loose.  More, it was ajar, and stirring (sluggishly, by reason of its great weight) to the wind.  But"]]]
