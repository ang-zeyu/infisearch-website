You will ready yourselves before the evening hour.\"  He slammed the door behind him. Joyce turned down the covers in the other room and sat up. \"I wonder if he isn't even going to feed us today?\"  Cameron made no answer. He finished dressing hurriedly and kept a frantic watch for any sign of Sal Karone.  At last there was a knock on the door and the Id appeared with breakfast on a cart. Cameron exhaled with relief that it was not one of the other _sarghs_ in the household.  Sal Karone eyed them impassively as he wheeled in and arranged the food on the table by a window. Cameron watched, estimating his chances.  \"Your Chief, Venor, was very kind to us yesterday,\" he said quietly. \"Our biggest regret in leaving is that our conversation with him must go unfinished.\"  Sal Karone paused. \"Were there things you had yet to say to him?\" he asked.  \"No--there were things Venor wanted to tell us. You heard him. He wanted us to come back. It is completely impossible for us to see him again before we go?\"  Sal Karone straightened and set the utensils on the table. \"No, it is not impossible. I have been instructed to bring you back to the village if it should be your request.\"  Cameron felt a surge of eager excitement within him. \"When? Our deportation is scheduled for today. How can we get there? How can we avoid Marthasa and the Markovians?\"  \"Stand very quietly,\" said Sal Karone, that sense of power and command in his voice and bearing as Cameron had seen it once before aboard the spaceship. \"Now,\" he said. \"Close your eyes.\"  There was a sudden wrenching twist as if two solid surfaces had slammed them from front and back, and a third force had thrust them sideways.  They opened their eyes in the wooden house of Venor, in the village of the Idealists.         *       *       *       *       *  \"We owe you apologies,\" said Venor. \"We hope you are not harmed in any way.\"  Cameron stared around uncertainly. Joyce clutched his hand. \"How did we--?\" Cameron stammered.  \"Teleportation is the descriptive term in your language, I believe,\" said Venor. \"It was rather urgent that you come without further delay so we resorted to it. Nothing else would do in the face of Marthasa's action. Sit down if you will, please. If you wish to rest or eat, your quarters are ready.\"  \"Our quarters--! Then you _did_ expect us back. You knew this was going to happen exactly as it has!\"  \"Yes, I knew,\" said Venor quietly. \"I planned it this way when word first came to us of your visit.\"  \"I think we are entitled to explanations,\" Cameron said at last. \"We seem to have been pieces in a game we knew nothing about.\"  And it had taken this long for the full impact of Venor's admission of teleportation to hit him. He closed his eyes in a moment's reaction of fright. He didn't want to believe it--and knew he must. These Idealists--who could master galaxies and tame the wild Markovians--was there anything they could not do?  \"Not a game,\" Venor protested. \"We planned this because we wanted you to see what you have seen. We wanted a man of Earth to know what we have done.\"  \"But don't the Markovians realize the foolishness of deporting us because we stumbled onto the relationship between you and them? And if you are in control how can they issue such an order--unless you want it?\"  \"Our relationship is more complex than that. There are different levels of control. We operate the one that brought you here--\" He let Cameron consider the implication of the unfinished statement.  Then he continued, \"To understand the Markovians' reason for deporting you, consider that on Earth men have tamed wolves and made faithful, loyal dogs who can be trusted. Dogs who have forever lost the knowledge their ancestors were fierce marauders ready to rip and tear the flesh of any man or beast that came their way.  \"Consider the dogs only a generation or two from the vicious wolves who were their forebears. The old urges have not entirely died, yet they want to know man's affection and trust. Could you remind them of what their kind once was without stirring up torment within them?  \"So it is with the Markovians. They are peaceful and creative, but only a few generations behind them are pirates who were not fit to sit in the Councils of civilized beings. They have no tradition of culture to support them. It knocks the props out from under them, so to speak, to have it known what lies behind them. They cannot be friends with such a man. They cannot even endure the knowledge among themselves.\"  \"Then I was right!\" Cameron exclaimed. \"Their phony history _was_ set up to deceive their own people as well as others.\"  \"Yes. The dog would destroy all evidence of his wolf ancestry. It has been an enormous project, but the people of the Nucleus have been at it a long time. They have concocted a consistent history which leaves out all evidence of their predatory ancestry. The items of reality which were possible to leave have been retained. The gaps between have been bridged by fictionized accounts of glorious undertakings and discoveries. Most of the Markovian science has been taken from other cultures, but now their history boasts of heroes and discoverers who never lived and who were responsible for all the great science they enjoy.\"  \"But nothing stable can be built upon such an unhealthy foundation of self-deception!\" Cameron protested.  \"It is not unhealthy--not at the present moment,\" said Venor. \"The time will come when it, too, will be thrust aside and a tremendous effort of scholarship will extract the elements of truth and find that which was suppressed. But the Markovians themselves will do it--a generation of them who can afford to laugh at the fears and fantasies of their ancestors.\"  \"This tells us nothing of how you were able to make a creative people out of a race of pirate marauders,\" said Cameron.  \"I gave you the key,\" said Venor. \"It was one used long ago by your own people before it was abandoned.  \"How was the savage wolf tamed to become the loyal, friendly dog? Did ancient man try to exterminate the wolves that came to his caves and carried off his young? Perhaps he tried. But he learned, perhaps accidentally, another way of conquest. He found the wolf's cubs, and learned to love them. He brought the cubs home and cared for them tenderly and his own children played with them and fed them and loved them.  \"It took time, but eventually there were no more wild wolves to trouble man, because he had discovered a great friend, the dog. And man plus dog could handle wolf with ease. Dog forgot in time what his forebears were and became willing to defend man against his own kind--because man loved him.  \"It happened again and again. Agricultural man hated the wild horse that ate his grain and trampled his fields. But he learned to love the horse, too, after a while. Again--no more wild horses.\"  \"But you can't take a predatory, savage pirate and love him into decency!\" Cameron protested.  \"No,\" Venor agreed. \"It is too difficult ordinarily at that level, and wasteful of time and resources. But I didn't say that is what happened. You don't tame a wolf by loving it, but the _cubs_--yes. And even pirates have cubs, who are susceptible to being loved.  \"The first weapon was hate. But after learning the futility of it, sentient creatures discovered another, the succeeding evolutionary emotion. It is pure savagery in its destructive power, a thousand times more effective in annihilating the enemy.  \"You've thought 'Love thy enemy' was a soft, gentle, futile doctrine! Actually, instead of merely killing the enemy it twists his personality, destroys his identity. He continues to live, but he has lost his integrity as an entity. The wolf cub never becomes an adult wolf. He becomes Dog.  \"It is not a doctrine of weakness, but the ultimate weapon of destruction. It can be used to induce any orientation desired in the mind of the enemy. He'll do everything you want him to--because he has your love.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"How did you apply that to the Markovians?\" asked Joyce in almost a whisper.  \"It was one of the most difficult programs we have ever undertaken,\" said Venor. \"There were comparatively few of us and such a tremendous population of Markovians. We had predicted long ago, even before the organization of the Council, the situation would grow critical and dangerous. By the time the Council awoke to the fact and started its futile debates we had made a strong beginning.  \"We arranged to be in the path of a Markovian attack on one of the worlds where our work was completed. The Markovians were only too happy to take us into slavery and use us as victims in their brutal sports.\"  \"You didn't deliberately fall into a trap where you allowed yourselves to be killed and tortured by them?\" exclaimed Cameron.  Venor smiled. \"The Markovians thought we did. We could hardly do that, of course. Our numbers were so small compared with theirs that we wouldn't have lasted very long. And, obviously, it would have been plain stupid. There is one key that must not be forgotten: An effective use of love requires an absolute superiority on the levels attainable by the individual to be tamed. So, in this case, we had to have power to keep the Markovians from slaughtering us or we would have been unable to accomplish our purpose.  \"Teleportation is of obvious use here. Likewise, psychosomatic controls that can handle any ordinary wound we might permit them to inflict. We gave them the illusion of slaughtering and torturing us, but our numbers did not dwindle.\"  \"Why did you give them such an illusion?\" Joyce asked. \"And you say you _permitted_ them to inflict wounds--?\"  Venor nodded. \"We were in their households, you see, employed as slaves and assigned the care of their young. The cubs of the wolf were given into our hands to love--and to tame.  \"These Markovian children were witnesses to the supposed torture and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22527"],["title","Beyond the Vanishing Point (#0)"],["body","OPENED THE PANDORA'S BOX                             OF ATOMIC TRAVEL   When George Randolph first caught sight of Orena, he was astounded by its gleaming perfection.

BEYOND THE VANISHING POINT  Copyright ©, 1958, by Ace Books, Inc.  All Rights Reserved   Printed in U.S.A.     CHAPTER I   It was shortly after noon of December 31, 1970, when the series of weird and startling events began which took me into the tiny world of an atom of gold, beyond the vanishing point, beyond the range of even the highest-powered electric-microscope. My name is George Randolph. I was, that momentous afternoon, assistant chemist for the Ajax International Dye Company, with main offices in New York City.  It was twelve-twenty when the local exchange call-sorter announced Alan's connection from Quebec.  \"Hello, George? Look here, you've got to come up here at once. Chateau Frontenac, Quebec. Will you come?\"  I could see his face imaged in the little mirror on my desk; the anxiety, tenseness in his voice, was duplicated in his expression.  \"Well--\" I began.  \"You must, George. Babs and I need you. See here....\"  He tried at first to make it sound like an invitation for a New Year's Eve holiday. But I knew it was not that. Alan and Barbara were my best friends. They were twins, eighteen years old. I felt that Alan would always be my best friend; but for Babs, my hopes, longings, went far deeper, though as yet I had never brought myself to the point of telling her so.  \"I'd like to come, Alan. But--\"  \"You've got to George! I can't tell you everything over the public air. But I've seen _him_: He's diabolical. I know it now!\"  _Him_! It could only mean, of all the world, one person!  \"He's here!\" he went on. \"Near here. We saw him today! I didn't want to tell you, but that's why we came. It seemed a long chance, but it's he, I'm positive!\"  I was staring at the image of Alan's eyes; there was horror in them. And his voice too. \"God, George, it's weird! Weird, I tell you. His looks--he--oh I can't tell you now! Only, come!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I was busy at the office in spite of the holiday season, but I dropped everything and went. By one o'clock that afternoon I was wheeling my little sport Midge from its cage on the roof of the Metropole building, and went into the air.  It was a cold gray afternoon with the feel of coming snow. I made a good two hundred and fifty miles at first, taking the northbound through-traffic lane which today the meteorological conditions had placed at an altitude of 6,200 feet.  Flying is largely automatic. There was not enough traffic to bother me. The details of leaving the office so hastily had been too engrossing for thought of Alan and Babs. But now, in my little pit at the controls, my mind flung ahead. They had located him. That meant Franz Polter, for whom we had been searching nearly four years. And my memory went back into the past with vivid vision....         *       *       *       *       *  The Kents, four years ago, were living on Long Island. Alan and Babs were fourteen at the time, and I was seventeen. Even then Babs was something kind of special to me. I lived in a neighboring house that summer and saw them every day.  To my adolescent mind a thrilling mystery hung upon the Kent family. The mother was dead. Dr. Kent, father of Alan and Babs, maintained a luxurious home, with only a housekeeper and no other servant. Dr. Kent was a retired chemist. He had, in his home, a laboratory in which he was working upon some mysterious problem. His children did not know what it was, nor, of course, did I. And none of us had ever been in the laboratory, except that when occasion offered we stole surreptitious peeps.  I recall Dr. Kent as a kindly, iron-gray haired gentleman. He was stern with the discipline of his children; but he loved them, and was indulgent in many ways. They loved him; and I, an orphan, began looking upon him almost as a father. I was interested in chemistry. He knew it, and did his best to help and encourage me in my studies.  There came an afternoon in the summer of 1966, when arriving at the Kent home, I ran upon a startling scene. The only other member of the household was a young fellow of twenty-five, named Franz Polter. He was a foreigner, born, I understood, in one of the Balkan Protectorates; he was here, employed by Dr. Kent as laboratory assistant.  He had been with the Kents, at this time, two years. Alan and Babs didn't like him, nor did I. He must have been a clever, skillful chemist. No doubt he was. But he was, to us, repulsive. A hunchback, with a short, thick body; dangling arms that suggested a gorilla; barrel chest; a lump set askew on his left shoulder, and his massive head planted down with almost no neck. His face was rugged in feature; a wide mouth, a high-bridged heavy nose; and above the face a great shock of wavy black hair. It was an intelligent face; in itself, not repulsive.  But I think we all three feared Franz Polter. There was always something sinister about him, that had nothing to do with his deformity.  When I came, that afternoon, Babs and Polter were under a tree on the Kent lawn. Babs, at fourteen, with long black braids down her back, bare-legged and short-skirted in a summer sport costume, was standing against the tree with Polter facing her. They were about the same height. To my youthful imaginative mind rose the fleeting picture of a young girl in a forest menaced by a gorilla.  I came upon them suddenly. I heard Polter say:  \"But I lof you. And you are almos' a woman. Some day you lof me.\"  He put out his thick hand and gripped her shoulder. She tried to twist away. She was frightened, but she laughed.  \"You--you're crazy!\"  He was suddenly holding her in his arms, and she was fighting him. I dashed forward. Babs was always a spunky sort of girl. In spite of her fear now, she kept on struggling, and she shouted:  \"You--let me go, you--you hunchback!\"  He did let her go; but in a frenzy of rage he hauled back his hand and struck her in the face. I was upon him the next second. I had him down on the lawn, punching him; but though at seventeen I was a reasonably husky lad, the hunchback with his thick, hairy gorilla arms proved much stronger. He heaved me off. The commotion had brought Alan and without waiting to find out what the trouble was, he jumped on Polter. Between us, I think we would have beaten him pretty badly. But the housekeeper summoned Dr. Kent and the fight was over.  Polter left for good within an hour. He did not speak to any of us. But I saw him as he put his luggage into the taxi which Dr. Kent had summoned. I was standing silently nearby with Babs and Alan. The look he flung us as he drove away carried an unmistakable menace--the promise of vengeance. And I think now that in his warped and twisted mind he was telling himself that he would some day make Babs regret that she had repulsed his love.  What happened that night none of us ever knew. Dr. Kent worked late in his laboratory; he was there when Alan and Babs and the housekeeper went to bed. He had written a note to Alan; it was found on his desk in a corner of the laboratory next morning, addressed in care of the family lawyer to be given Alan in the event of his death. It said very little. Described a tiny fragment of gold quartz rock the size of a walnut which would be found under the giant microscope in the laboratory; and told Alan to give it to the American Scientific Society to be guarded and watched very carefully.  This note was found, but Dr. Kent had vanished! There had been a midnight marauder. The laboratory was on the lower floor of the house. Through one of its open windows, so the police said, an intruder had entered. There was evidence of a struggle, but it must have been short, because neither Babs, Alan, the housekeeper, nor any of the neighbors had heard anything. And the fragment of golden quartz was gone!  The police investigation came to nothing. Polter was found in New York. He withstood the police questions. There was nothing except suspicion upon which he could be held, and he was finally released. Immediately thereafter, he disappeared.  Neither Alan, Babs nor I saw Polter again. Dr. Kent had never been heard from to this day, four years later when I flew to join the twins in Quebec. And now Alan told me that Polter was up there! We had never ceased to believe that Dr. Kent was alive, and that Polter was the midnight marauder. As we grew older, we began to search for Polter. It seemed to us, that if we could once get our hands on him, we could drag from him the truth which the police had failed to get.  The call of a"]]]
