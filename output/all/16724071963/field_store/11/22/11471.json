In 1718 he was chapel-master to the Prince von Köthen, and in 1723 was appointed music-director and cantor at the St. Thomas School in Leipsic,--a position which he held during the remainder of his life. He has left for the admiration of posterity an almost endless list of vocal and instrumental works, including chorales, motets, magnificats, masses, fugues, and fantasies, especially for organ and piano, the \"Christmas Oratorio,\" and several settings of the passion, of which the most famous are the \"St. John\" and \"St. Matthew,\" the latter of which Mendelssohn introduced to the world in 1829, after it had slumbered an entire century. His most famous instrumental work is the \"Well-tempered Clavichord,\"--a collection of forty-eight fugues and preludes, which was written for his second wife, Anna Magdalena Bach, to whom also he dedicated a large number of piano pieces and songs. His first wife was his cousin, Maria Barbara Bach, the youngest daughter of Johann Michael Bach, a composer of no common ability. By these two wives he had twenty-one children, of whom the most celebrated were Carl Phillipp Emanuel, born in 1714, known as the \"Berlin Bach;\" Johann Christoph Friedrich, born in 1732, the \"Bücheburger Bach;\" and Johann Christian, born in 1735, who became famous as the \"London Bach.\" Large as the family was, it is now extinct. Bach was industrious, simple, honest, and God-fearing, like all his family. He was an incessant and laborious writer from necessity, as his compensation was hardly sufficient to maintain his large family, and nearly all his music was prepared for the service of the church by contract. The prominent characteristics of his work are profound knowledge, the clearest statements of form, strength of logical sequences, imposing breadth, and deep religious sentiment. He was a favorite of Frederick the Great, who upon one occasion made all his courtiers stand on one side and do homage to the illustrious composer. \"There is but one Bach,\" said the monarch. With all Bach's amiable qualities, it is said that he had a hasty temper. While playing one day, Görner, the organist at St. Thomas, struck a false chord; whereupon Bach flew at him in a passion, tore off his wig and threw it at him, exclaiming: \"You ought to have been a cobbler, instead of an organist!\" Notwithstanding this infirmity of temper, he was a deeply religious man, and inscribed upon every one of his principal compositions \"S. D. G.,\" \"to the glory of God alone.\" He died July 28, 1750, and was buried at Leipsic; but no cross or stone marks the spot where he lies. His last composition was the beautiful chorale, \"Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein,\" freely translated, \"When my last hour is close at hand,\" as it was written in his last illness. The only record of his death is contained in the official register: \"A man, aged 67, M. Johann Sebastian Bach, musical director and singing-master at the St. Thomas School, was carried to his grave in the hearse, July 30, 1750.\"                              The Christmas Oratorio.   The \"Christmas Oratorio\" was written by Bach in 1734, the subject being taken from texts in Luke and Matthew pertaining to the nativity. It is not, as its name would suggest, a work to be performed at a single hearing, but a composition divided into six parts of divine service, arranged for the three days of Christmas, New Year's Day, New Year's Sunday, and the Epiphany, each part being a complete cantata for each day, and all linked together by chorales which give it a unity of subject and design. Like Wagner's \"Ring der Nibelungen,\" it was given in instalments, each part separate and complete in itself, and yet combining to illustrate a given subject in its entirety. It is not an oratorio in the modern sense; but the justification of its appellation as such is to be found in Bach's own title, \"Oratorium Tempore Navitatis Christi.\"  As the entire six parts are very rarely given, a general review of their character will better suit the reader's purpose than a detailed review of each. When it has been performed in this country, only the first two parts have been given; while in England, though it has been presented entire, the performance is usually confined to the first three, which contain a complete story. The entire vocal score embraces no less than sixty-four numbers,--which in itself constitutes a sufficient reason for abridgment. In the first three parts the connecting narratives, recited by the evangelist, are assigned to tenor and bass, and declare the events associated with the birth of our Lord,--the journey to Bethlehem, the birth in the manger, the joy of Mary, and the thanksgiving over the advent of the Lord,--the choral parts being sung by the shepherds. The fourth part, that for New Year's Day, relates the naming of Jesus, and follows his career in a grand expression of faith and hope. The fifth part illustrates the visit of the three kings, the anxiety of Herod when he hears of the advent of the Lord, and the assurances given him to allay his fears. In the sixth section the visitors depart to frustrate Herod's designs, and choruses of rejoicing over the final triumph of the Lord close the work. In his voluminous life of Bach, Spitta makes an exhaustive analysis of the various parts, an abridgment of which will be of interest in this connection.  The only variation from the particular character of each section is to be found in the introduction of the first chorale in Part I. at the close of Part VI., in the form of a brilliant choral fantasia.    \"In the first three the Christmas feeling prevails most vividly; this   is effected in great measure by the chorales which are interspersed in   far greater numbers than in the last three, and which are almost all   familiar Christmas hymns. Most of them are simply set in four parts,   with highly ingenious applications of the church modes.\"  The first and second parts close with chorales, but in the third the opening chorus is repeated at the close.    \"Part IV. has least of the character of church festival music. The   Biblical matter consists of a single verse from the Gospel of Saint   Luke, ii. 21, which relates the circumcision and naming of Jesus. Not   much material could be worked out of this, and Bach has  almost   entirely set aside all adjuncts from the liturgy. No Christmas hymn,   indeed no true chorale, is introduced in it.... This section,   therefore, bears more strongly the stamp merely of a religious   composition; it is full of grace and sweetness, and can only have   derived its full significance for congregational use from its position   in context with the rest of the work.\"  Parts V. and VI., devoted to the history of the three kings, are in no respect inferior to the first three.    \"The lyrical choruses are full of artistic beauty and swing. The   cantata character is more conspicuous here than in the first three   sections, and the specially Christmas feeling resides more in the   general tone of the music than in the chorales.\"  Bitter, in his life of Bach, gives the following interesting sketch of the origin of some of the numbers contained in the work:--    \"In some parts of this music Bach borrowed from former compositions of   his own, especially from a 'Drama per Musica,' dedicated to the Queen   of Poland, and a drama entitled 'The Choice of Hercules,' composed in   1733 for a Saxon prince. The old hymn-tune, 'O Haupt voll Blut und   Wunden,' composed A.D. 1600 (by Hans Geo. Hassler to a secular tune),   and used by Bach five times to different words in the   'Matthäus-Passion,' is again used in this oratorio to the words of Paul   Gerhard's Advent hymn, 'Wie soll ich dich empfangen,' and to the hymn   of triumph, 'Nun seid ihr wohl gerochen,' at the end of the last part.   As this tune was familiar to the hearers in connection with a hymn for   Passion Week, its adaptation to Advent and Christmas hymns seems   intended to express a presentiment at the time of Christ's birth of his   future sufferings. The same tune is now used in the German Church to a   number of different hymns, especially to 'Herzlich thut mich verlangen'   and 'Befiehl du deine Wege,' and is in some tune-books called by one or   other of these names. 'Befiehl du deine Wege' is one of the hymns to   which Bach has set it in the 'Matthäus-Passion.' In the first part of   the oratorio we find two verses of Luther's Christmas hymn, 'Gelobet   seist du Jesu Christ;' first, the verse beginning 'Er ist auf Erden   kommen arm,' to the tune Luther composed for it, and the verse 'Ach,   mein herzliebes Jesulein,' to the tune (also of Luther's composition),   'Von Himmel hoch da komm ich her.' This last-mentioned tune is also   used twice in the second part, to the words 'Schaut hin, dort liegt im   finstern Stalle,' and 'Wir singen dir in deinem Heer,' arranged   differently each time. The chorales, 'Jesus, richte mein Beginnen,' in   the fourth part, and 'Dein Glanz all Finsterniss verzehrt,' in the   fifth part, are probably Bach's own compositions.\"  The first two parts of the work are the only ones which need special notice for the purposes of the oratorio-goer. The first part opens with a brilliant prelude, introduced by the drum, which Bach, like Beethoven, sometimes treated as a solo instrument. It preludes the narrative bidding Zion prepare to meet her Lord,--a simple, touching melody, followed by the chorale, \"How shall I fitly meet Thee and give Thee welcome due,\" set to the old passion-hymn, \"O Haupt, voll Blut und Wunden,\"--a solemn and even mournful melody, which at first appears incongruous in the midst of so much jubilation. It is the same melody which Bach frequently uses in different harmonic forms in his \"St. Matthew Passion.\" It is introduced here in the midst of the Christmas festivity for a special purpose. Bitter gives it the following significance:--    \"We see the Angel of Death unveil his pale face, bend over"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22793"],["title","The Standard Oratorios: Their Stories, Their Music, And Their Composers (#5)"],["body","cradle   of the Lord, and foretell his sorrows. The Child hears the song which   one day, sung to other words, will be his death-song.\"  The composer's evident intention was to impress the hearer with the fact that the object of the divine advent on earth was the passion of our Lord. At the close of the work the same chorale appears, but it has another meaning. It is there an exultant expression of Christ's victory over sin and death. As the chorale dies away, the narrative is resumed, leading up to another chorale, \"For us to earth he cometh poor,\" combined with an orchestral symphony and bass recitative. The next number is a bass aria with trumpet accompaniment, \"Lord Almighty, King all glorious,\" and is followed by a chorale set to the words of Martin Luther's Christmas hymn, which also occurs in other parts of the work, differently harmonized to suit the nature of the situation, with which the first part closes.  The second part opens with one of the most delightful instances of Bach's orchestration, a pastoral symphony, with which the Thomas orchestra have made audiences familiar in this country. Like the symphony of the same style in Handel's \"Messiah,\" it is simple, graceful, and idyllic in character, and pictures the shepherds watching their flocks by night on the plains of Bethlehem. At its conclusion the evangelist resumes his narrative, followed by the chorale: \"Break forth, O beauteous, heavenly Light,\" preluding the announcement of the angel, \"Behold, I bring you Good Tidings.\" It is followed by the bass recitative, \"What God to Abraham revealed, He to the Shepherds doth accord to see fulfilled,\" and a brilliant aria for tenor, \"Haste, ye Shepherds, haste to meet Him.\" The evangelist gives them the sign, followed by the chorale which closed the first part, in another form, \"Within yon Gloomy Manger lies.\" The bass recitative, \"O haste ye then,\" preludes the exquisite cradle-song for alto, \"Sleep, my Beloved, and take Thy Repose,\"--a number which can hardly be excelled in the sweetness and purity of its melody or in the exquisiteness of its instrumentation. This lovely song brings us to the close, which is an exultant shout from the multitude of the heavenly host, singing, \"Glory to God in the highest.\"                            The Saint Matthew Passion.   The passion-music of Bach's time, as we have already seen, was the complement of the mysteries of Mediæval days. It portrays the sufferings of Christ, and was performed at church festivals, the congregation taking part in the singing of the chorales, which were mostly familiar religious folk-songs. It was a revival of the sacred drama in musical form, and the immediate precursor of the modern oratorio. Bach wrote five passions,--the \"St. John,\" probably written in 1723, and first performed in the following year; another, which has been lost, in 1725; the \"St. Matthew,\" in 1729; the \"St. Mark,\" in 1731; and the \"St. Luke,\" in 1734. Of these only two are now known,--the \"St. John\" and \"St. Matthew;\" of which the latter is incomparably the greatest.  Macfarren, in his sketch of the \"Matthew Passion,\" says that the idea of this form of composition was first suggested to Bach by Solomon Deyling, who filled an important church position in Leipsic when the composer went there to assume his duties as cantor of the St. Thomas School, his purpose being to introduce into the Reformed Church a service which should be a counter attraction to the Mass as performed in the Roman Church. It was produced for the first time at the afternoon service on Good Friday, 1729, but was not heard again until the young Mendelssohn revived it in Berlin, March 12, 1829. It was frequently repeated in Germany and aroused extraordinary enthusiasm, and still keeps its place in the festival oratorio repertory, the necessary additional accompaniments having been furnished by Robert Franz.  The passion is written in two parts, between which the sermon intervened in old times. It includes portions of chapters xxvi. and xxvii. of the Gospel according to Saint Matthew, the remainder of the text being composed of hymns furnished to Bach by Christian Friedrich Henrici, who wrote under the pseudonym of \"Picander,\" and, it is said, was assisted in the compilation by the composer himself. The _dramatis personæ_ are Jesus, Judas, Peter, Pilate, the Apostles, and the People, or _Turbæ_, and the narrative is interpreted by reflections addressed to Jesus, forming two choruses, \"The Daughter of Zion\" and \"The Faithful,\" as Picander calls them. They are sometimes given by the chorus, and sometimes by single voices. The chorales are selected from those which were in common use in the Lutheran Church, and were familiar therefore to the congregations which sang the melody, the harmony being sustained by the chorus and instruments. The Gospel text is in recitative form throughout, the part of the evangelist, or narrator, being assigned to a tenor voice, while those of the persons incidentally introduced are given to other singers. In the dialogue, wherever the words of Jesus occur, the accompaniment is furnished by a string quartette, which serves to distinguish them from the others, and invests them with a peculiar gentleness and grace. The incidental choruses, sung by the People and the Apostles, are short and vivacious in character, many of them being in madrigal form. The chorales, fifteen in number, as has already been said, were taken from the Lutheran service. One of them, which Bach also liberally used in his \"Christmas Oratorio,\" beginning, \"Acknowledge me, my Keeper,\" appears five times in the progress of the work, forming the keynote of the church sentiment, and differently harmonized on each occasion. Another, \"O Blessed Jesus,\" is twice used,--once where the Saviour announces that he will be crucified after the Feast of the Passover, when the whole congregation sings it, and again in the scene at Gethsemane, sung by select choirs. The whole work is written for double chorus, the two choruses singing the harmony of the chorales, accompanied by the instruments, while the congregation sing the tune in unison. They display to the utmost the breadth, richness, ingenuity, and power of Bach in this form of writing. The reflective portions of the work, the text written by Picander, are composed of arias introduced by recitative, with the first part repeated in the close; of arias accompanied by chorus; and of single choruses constructed in the most massive manner. Speaking of the melodies in these portions of the work, Spitta says,--    \"The grades of feeling traversed by Bach in the solo songs of the 'St.   Matthew Passion' are all the more impressive because every sentiment of   joy in its various shades is wholly excluded; they are all based on the   emotion of sorrow. The most fervent sympathy with the sufferings of the   Son of Man, rising to the utmost anguish, childlike trustfulness, manly   earnestness, and tenderly longing devotion to the Redeemer; repentance   for the personal sins that his suffering must atone for, and passionate   entreaties for mercy; an absorbed contemplation of the example offered   by the sufferings of Jesus, and solemn vows pronounced over his dead   body never to forsake or forget him,--these are the themes Bach had to   treat. And he has solved the difficult problem as if it were child's   play, with that inexhaustible wealth of resource which was most at his   command precisely when he had to depict the sadder emotions. In no   other of his works (unless it be in the 'Christmas Oratorio') do we   find such a store of lovely and various solo airs, nor did Bach even   ever write melodies more expressive and persuasive than those of the   arias in the 'St. Matthew Passion.'\"  As we have said, the music is arranged for double chorus, and each chorus has its own orchestra and its own organ accompaniment. The double orchestra is composed of oboes, flutes, and stringed instruments. Drums and brass instruments are not used, the sentiment of the work, in Bach's estimation, not being fitted for them, sweetness and expressiveness of tone rather than power being required. As Spitta says, sorrow is the characteristic of the work. It has no choruses of rejoicing, no pæans of praise, not even a hallelujah at its close.  The first part opens with a reflection sung by double chorus, \"Come, ye Daughters, weep for Anguish,\" the first exhorting believers to weep over the sinful world, the second responding with brief interrogations, and at last taking part in the sorrowful strains of the first. Interwoven with these is an independent instrumental melody, the whole crowned with a magnificent chorale sung by the sopranos, \"O Lamb of God all blameless!\" followed by still another, \"Say, sweetest Jesus,\" which reappears in other parts of the work variously harmonized. The double chorus and chorales form the introduction, and are followed by recitative and a chorale, \"Thou dear Redeemer,\" and a pathetic aria for contralto, \"Grief and Pain,\" relating the incident of the woman anointing the feet of Jesus. The next number is an aria for soprano, \"Only bleed, Thou dearest Heart,\" which follows the acceptance by Judas of the thirty pieces of silver, and which serves to intensify the grief in the aria preceding it. The scene of the Last Supper ensues, and to this number Bach has given a character of sweetness and gentleness, though its coloring is sad. As the disciples ask, \"Lord, is it I?\" another chorale is sung, \"'Tis I! my Sins betray me.\" Recitative of very impressive character, conveying the divine injunctions, leads up to a graceful and tender aria for soprano, \"Never will my Heart refuse Thee,\" one of the simplest and clearest, and yet one of the richest and most expressive, melodies ever conceived. After further recitative and the chorale, \"I will stay here beside Thee,\" we are introduced to the scene in the Garden of Gethsemane, which is characterized by a number of"]]]
