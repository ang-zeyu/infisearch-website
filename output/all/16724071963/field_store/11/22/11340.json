I have one thing to say to you before I go, and you had better bear it in mind. If you harm a hair of Tom Nelson's head, and I believe you quite capable of it, I will never rest till I have found you out and punished you for it.\"  \"I am not afraid of you, John Miles,\" retorted Crane, but he looked uncomfortable.  \"You will have cause to be, if you injure Tom.\"  Miles walked off, leaving behind him a bitter enemy.  \"I _hate_ him--him and the boy too!\" muttered Bill Crane. \"If I dared, I would put my mark on him before he leaves the camp.\"  But Crane did not dare. He knew that he was in a very critical position. His safety depended on the silence of two persons--one of whom would soon be gone. He was not aware that Ferguson also knew of his attempted crime, or the danger would have seemed greater. However much he thirsted for vengeance, it would not do to gratify it now. He must bide his time.  Bill Crane was cunning as well as malignant. He decided to quiet Tom's suspicions if he could, and ensure his continued silence, by an affectation of friendliness. He waited till he saw our hero washing dust beyond earshot of any listeners, and strolled up to him.  \"How are you getting on, Tom?\" he asked, with an appearance of friendliness.  Tom looked up quickly. Considering all that had happened, he was somewhat struck by Crane's effrontery.  \"Fairly well,\" he answered coldly.  \"Shan't I relieve you a few minutes?\" proposed Crane.  \"No, thank you.\"  \"It's pretty hard work, and don't pay as well as it might. I think California's a humbug, for my part.\"  \"Have you tried washing for gold?\" asked Tom. \"I haven't seen you at work.\"  \"Not here. I've tried it elsewhere, but it's slow.\"  \"Then, why do you stay here?\" asked Tom, naturally.  Crane shrugged his shoulders.  \"Because I haven't money to get away,\" he said. \"I'm waiting for something to turn up. If I could only get to Frisco, I would go into some business. I would like to have gone with Miles.\"  \"Was that what you were going to propose to him, last night?\" asked Tom, dryly.  \"Yes, I wanted to speak to him on that subject. I had a great mind to ask him to lend me a little money, and take me along with him. I would have arranged to pay him soon after we reached Frisco.\"  Tom knew that the fellow was lying, and remained silent.  \"You made a little mistake about my intentions,\" continued Bill Crane, smoothly, \"but perhaps it was natural under the circumstances.\"  Tom thought it was, but still preserved silence, much to Crane's discomfiture.  Bill Crane eyed him sharply, and saw his incredulity, but for that he cared little, if only he could secure his silence.  \"I think you will see that it isn't fair to me to speak of this matter,\" he continued.  \"I had made up my mind not to speak of it,\" said Tom. \"I don't want to get you into trouble.\"  \"Good-morning, Mr. Crane,\" said Lawrence Peabody, who had just come up.  \"Good-morning, Peabody. I was watching our friend Tom. How are you getting on?\"  \"I haven't done anything yet to-day. It's dirty work. I don't think it's fit for a gentleman; Tom, there, is used to work, and he don't mind.\"  \"Shall we go round to Jack's?\"  \"All right!\"  And the two walked away together.  \"I am sorry Peabody doesn't keep better company,\" Tom said to himself. \"Bill Crane won't do him any good.\"     CHAPTER VI.  ROBBED IN HIS SLEEP.   Tom was right in concluding that Bill Crane's influence over Peabody was anything but good. The young Bostonian, however, was not long subjected to it. During the night following John Miles's departure, the little settlement at River Bend was called upon to deplore the loss of an eminent member.  In brief, somewhere between midnight and dawn Mr. William Crane took his departure, without the ceremony of leave-taking. Had he gone alone no one perhaps would have felt any violent sorrow, but he took with him a horse belonging to Adam Dietrich, an industrious young German, who had only recently arrived. No one had seen the two go together, but it was only natural to suppose that Crane had spirited away the horse.  Dietrich borrowed a horse, and, accompanied by a friend, set out in search of the thief, but returned at night unsuccessful. Had it been wet weather, it might have been possible to track the fugitive; but it was very dry, and the trail was soon lost. It was almost impossible to tell what direction Crane would choose, and continued pursuit would not pay, so Adam sadly returned to his work.  Little doubt was entertained among the miners that Crane was responsible for the loss of the horse. Had he been caught, there would have been small chance for him, so generally was he pronounced guilty. A few of his companions, especially Missouri Jack, defended him.  \"Bill Crane wouldn't steal a horse any more than I would,\" said Jack; and there were those who agreed with him without acquitting Bill. \"Bill ain't no saint, but he ain't a thief.\"  Whether Jack believed what he said, admits of a doubt. Crane needed a different advocate to clear him from suspicion.  It may as well be stated that Crane did steal the horse. He had a decided objection to walking as long as he could ride, and, having no animal of his own, annexed the property of his neighbor.  He had two motives which influenced him to leave the settlement. First, he was in Tom's power, and he was by no means certain that our hero would keep silence touching his night-attempt at robbery. In the second place, he still coveted the bag of gold-dust which John Miles carried away with him. He had been prevented from taking it; but, as Miles was travelling alone, he foresaw a better chance of success if he should follow on his track.  How or under what circumstances he should make the new attempt he left to be decided later. The first thing, obviously, was to overtake him.  Crane experienced the same difficulty in tracking Miles that had led to the failure of his own pursuers. It was only on the fifth day, that, as he halted his steed on the hillside, and cast long glances about him, he caught sight, a mile away, of the object of his pursuit. He could not mistake the sturdy, broad-shouldered figure, and large, massive head.  \"That's Miles, sure enough!\" he exclaimed, joyfully. \"I thought I had missed him, but I'm in luck. That bag must be mine.\"  The most direct course was to ride up in the fashion of a highwayman, and demand the bag. But Crane did not mean to proceed in this fashion. Physically, though not a weak man, he was not a match for Miles, and he knew it. Cunning must supply the place of strength. He knew that Miles was a sound sleeper, and could think of no better plan than repeating the visit he had made in camp. It was already late in the afternoon when he caught sight of the sturdy miner. It was his policy now to keep him in sight, but not to approach near enough for recognition. Once seen, Miles would be on his guard, and the game would be spoiled. Crane halted, therefore, and drew back within the shadow of the trees, henceforth advancing cautiously.  John Miles did not once turn back. Had he done so, it is quite possible that he might have caught a glimpse of his pursuer. He had travelled since morning, and his faithful horse was beginning to show signs of fatigue.  \"You are tired, my poor Dick,\" he said kindly, stroking the horse. \"You deserve supper and rest, and you shall have it.\"  Dick appeared to understand what his rider said, for he gave a short neigh of satisfaction.  John Miles looked around him. Just ahead was a large tree, under whose broad branches it would be pleasant to recline. Not far away was a slender mountain-stream trickling over the rocks. Nothing could have been better.  Miles slid from his horse and made preparations to encamp for the night, first leading his faithful steed to the stream, where he quenched his thirst. Then he brought out his slender stock of provisions and partook of supper.  \"It's pleasant to rest after a long day's ride,\" soliloquized Miles. \"I must have made forty miles to-day. I could easily have gone farther, had it been on the prairies at home, but these mountain-roads are hard upon man and beast.\"  After supper Miles threw himself upon the ground, and his mind became busy with his plans and prospects.  \"I shall reach Frisco in three days, according to my calculations,\" he reflected; \"and then, first of all, I must attend to Tom's commission. That's a good boy, Tom. I wish he were here with me to-night. Why didn't I urge him to come with me? He is not doing very well where he is, and there are plenty of chances for a smart boy in the city. If I find any opening for him, I will send for him. I don't know what gives me such an interest in that boy, but I'd sooner do him a good turn than any man I know. I hope that thief Crane won't play any trick upon him. If he does, I swear I'll get even with him.\"  John Miles little suspected that he himself stood in more peril from the man he denounced than our hero. Had he known that Bill Crane was lurking in the vicinity, he would scarcely have courted slumber so fearlessly.  Physical fatigue and the stillness of outward nature speedily brought on a feeling of drowsiness that was not long in bringing sleep. Twilight had hardly given place to night when our traveller had become \"to dumb forgetfulness a prey.\"  This was what Bill Crane had been waiting for. He rightly calculated that Miles would soon be asleep. He inferred this from his own feelings. He, too, had travelled many miles, and felt drowsy; but, with the object he had in view near accomplishment, he was able to resist the promptings of nature.  Crane rode till he was but a few rods from Miles, then dismounted and tethered his horse. With stealthy step he approached the sleeper. With satisfaction he regarded the upturned face of the man whom, if waking, he would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22669"],["title","The Young Miner; Or, Tom Nelson in California (#5)"],["body"," feared, and noted his deep, regular breathing.  \"You wouldn't sleep so sound, John Miles,\" he said to himself, \"if you knew I was standing over you. How easily I could put a bullet into you! But then I wouldn't have the satisfaction of anticipating your disappointment when you wake up and find your treasure gone! No, you may live. I have no use for your life, that is, if you don't wake up. In that case, I may have to kill you.\"  The bag of gold-dust lay under the head of Miles. He knew of no better place for it, calculating that any attempt at removal would arouse him. So it might under ordinary circumstances, but unusual fatigue made him sleep like a log. Bill Crane kneeled down, and by delicate manipulation succeeded in drawing the bag from beneath the sleeper's head. Lest the removal of the pillow might awaken Miles, he replaced it by a coat, which he folded up so as to produce about the same elevation above the ground.  The transfer was made, without in the least interfering with the slumbers of the tired traveller.  Bill Crane rose to his feet, triumphant. Not only was he possessed of a sum of which he stood sorely in need, but he had the satisfaction of outwitting his adversary. Moreover, he had obtained Tom's money in addition, and thus revenged himself upon the boy who had once thwarted him.  \"Good-by, John Miles!\" he said, lifting his hat mockingly. \"Sorry to inconvenience you, but can't help it. A long sleep, and pleasant dreams!\"  Thus speaking, he turned away, unconscious that he had been observed by a third party.     CHAPTER VII.  THE HEATHEN CHINEE.   This third party belonged to that peculiar race immortalized by Bret Harte. He was a heathen Chinee! His face was smooth and bland, and wore an expression of childlike innocence which was well calculated to deceive. Ah Sin possessed the usual craft of his countrymen, and understood very well how to advance his worldly fortunes. He belonged to the advance guard of immigrants from the Central Flowery Kingdom, and with a companion, Ah Jim, was engaged in mining in the immediate neighborhood. His gains had not been great thus far, but then his expenses had amounted to little or nothing. He and his friend had brought two bags of rice from San Francisco, and they were well satisfied with this solitary article of diet.  Ah Sin, from a distance, had seen John Miles encamp for the night, and, impelled by curiosity or a more questionable motive, had approached to take a view of the stranger. Before reaching him he caught sight of Bill Crane, and his almond eyes straightway watched the movements of that gentleman, while he himself kept sufficiently in the background to escape observation.  When he saw Crane stealthily remove the bag from under the sleeper's head, he became very much interested, and a bland smile overspread his face, while his cue vibrated gently with approval.  \"'Melican man very smart,\" he murmured to himself. \"He steal his friend's money while he sleep.\"  My readers are probably aware that our Mongolian visitors find a difficulty in pronouncing the letter _r_, and invariably replace it by _l_.  \"Suppose other 'Melican man wake up, he make a low,\" continued Ah Sin, softly.  But the other 'Melican man did not wake up, and Bill Crane got away with his booty, as we already know. Cautiously the Chinaman followed him, and ascertained where he intended to pass the night. It was at a moderate distance from the cabin which the two Chinamen had selected for their mining camp.  Bill Crane jumped from his horse, stretched his limbs, and gaped.  \"I'm powerful sleepy,\" he soliloquized. \"I can't go any farther to-night. I don't like to rest so near Miles, but I can be on the road before he wakes up. I guess it will be safe enough.\"  Crane, having made up his mind to rest, rolled himself up in his blanket, and stretched himself out, first tying his horse to a sapling. The place was retired, and he felt moderately confident that, even if he overslept himself, he would not be discovered.  \"I'd like to see Miles when he discovers his loss,\" he said to himself, smiling at the thought. \"He'll be ready to tear his hair, and won't have the least idea how the gold-dust was spirited away. You excel me in brute strength, John Miles, but one thing I am pretty sure of, you haven't got my brains,\" and he complacently tapped his forehead.  \"There must be at least two hundred dollars' worth in that bag,\" he reflected. \"It isn't a great haul, but it will do. It will last me some time, and perhaps start me in something in Frisco. Bill Crane, you've done a good stroke of business to-day. You are entitled to a good night's rest, and you shall have it.\"  First, however, he concealed the bag. He did not think it safe to place it under his head as Miles had done. He scooped a hole in the earth near by, deposited the bag, replaced the dirt, and spread a few leaves over the top.  \"No one will think of searching there,\" thought Crane. \"Even if Miles himself surprises me here, he won't suspect anything.\"  Bill Crane felt that he was unusually sharp and crafty, and felt great contempt for the stupidity of the man whom he had overreached. The time was not far off when he had occasion to doubt whether he had not overrated his own artfulness.  A pair of almond eyes, lighted up with mild wonder, followed closely all the movements of William Crane. When the bag was concealed, and Crane lay down to sleep, the Chinaman nodded blandly, and remarked softly, \"All light! Me go find Ah Jim.\"  Ah Sin had to walk but half a mile to find the partner of his toils. Ah Sin and Ah Jim, though not related to each other, were as like as two peas. The same smooth face, the same air of childlike confidence, the same almond eyes, a pigtail of the same length, a blouse and loose pants of the same coarse cloth, were characteristic of both.  When the two met, they straightway plunged into a conversation in which Ah Sin had most to say.  Ah Jim listened attentively, and was evidently well pleased with what his companion said. I am afraid my young friends are not well up in the Chinese tongue, and would not understand the conversation, however faithfully reported. They must infer what it was from what followed.  The two Chinamen bent their steps towards the resting-place of Bill Crane. Ah Sin carried a bag of about the same size as the one Crane had stolen, which he carefully filled with sandy earth. With stealthy steps these two innocent heathen drew near the spot, and looked searchingly at the recumbent form of the eminent representative of American civilization.  Ah Sin turned to Ah Jim with a pleased smile.  \"All light!\" he said. \"'Melican man asleep.\"  A similar smile lighted up the face of Ah Jim. \"'Melican man sleep sound,\" he said; \"no wake up.\"  Quite unaware of the honor done him by the special Chinese embassy which had taken this early opportunity to call upon him, Bill Crane slept on. There was a smile upon his upturned face as if he were dreaming of something pleasant. He should have been a prey to remorse, if his conscience had done its duty, but Bill's conscience had grown callous, and gave him very little trouble. It was only when he was found out that he became sensible of a kind of mental discomfort which came as near to remorse as he was capable of feeling.  Reassured by the deep, regular breathing of the sleeper, Ah Sin and his friend proceeded to their work. The former drew a slender stiletto-like knife from a fan which protruded above the collar of his blouse, and, stooping down, began skilfully to remove the dirt which covered the bag of gold-dust. From time to time he stole a glance at the sleeper to mark the first indications of returning consciousness. It was well for Crane that his sleep continued. A Chinaman does not set a high value upon human life, and the long stiletto would have been plunged into the 'Melican man before he was well aware of what was going on. Bill Crane's good genius saved him from this sudden exit by continuing the profound slumber in which he was repairing the ravages of fatigue.  The Chinamen therefore met with no interruption in their work. They drew out from its place of concealment the buried bag, and emptying the contents of their own poured into it the combined treasures of Miles and poor Tom. Then they filled the first bag with the worthless dust which they had brought with them, and carefully reburied it in the ground.  They did their work so carefully and well that no one was likely to suspect that the bag had been tampered with.  Having done their work, Ah Sin and his friend smiled upon each other in bland satisfaction, which was further expressed by a low guttural chuckle.  \"All light,\" said Ah Sin, with a nod.  \"All light,\" chimed in Ah Jim, nodding in return.  A consciousness of lofty virtue could not have produced a happier expression upon any face than appeared on the mild countenance of the Chinamen.  \"'Melican man much supplised when he wake up,\" remarked Ah Jim.  \"Chinamen make much money,\" returned his friend.  The two enterprising visitors returned to their quarters, and concealed their booty in a safe place. Then they too lay down and slept the sleep of confiding innocence.  Bret Harte has not told us whether the heathen Chinee has a conscience; but if he has, neither Ah Sin nor Ah Jim experienced any inconvenience from its possession. Neither they nor Bill perhaps can fairly be taken as fair representatives of the different religious systems under which they were trained. Bill Crane could hardly claim any superiority over the heathen Chinee in point of honesty.     CHAPTER VIII.  BILL CRANE'S DISAGREEABLE DISCOVERY.   It was five o'clock in the morning when Bill Crane opened his eyes. He felt refreshed by his night's sleep, yet under ordinary circumstances would have deferred getting up for at least an hour. But the consciousness that he had a treasure to guard, and the knowledge that he was at any moment liable to be called to account"]]]
