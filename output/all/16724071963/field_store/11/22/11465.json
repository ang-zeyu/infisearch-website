Some things I have inserted of _Carving and Sewing_ that I might demonstrate the whole Art. In the contrivance of these my labours, I have so managed them for the general good, that those whose Purses cannot reach to the cost of rich Dishes, I have descended to their meaner Expences, that they may give, though upon a sudden Treatment, to their Kindred, Friends, Allies and Acquaintance, a handsome and relishing entertainment in all seasons of the year, though at some distance from Towns or Villages. Nor have my serious considerations been wanting amongst direction for Diet how to order what belongs to the sick, as well as to those that are in health; and withal my care hath been such, that in this Book as in a Closet, is contained all such Secrets as relate to _Preserving_, _Conserving_, _Candying_, _Distilling_, and such rare varieties as they are most concern'd in the _best husbandring and huswifering_ of them. Nor is there any Book except that of the _Queens Closet_, which was so _enricht with Receipts_ presented to her _Majesty_, as yet that I ever saw in any _Language_, that ever contained so many _profitable Experiences, as in this Volume_: in all which the _Reader_ shall find most of the _Compositions_, and mixtures easie to be prepared, most pleasing to the Palate, and not too chargeable to the Purse; since you are at liberty to employ as much or as little therein as you please.  In this Edition I have enlarged the whole Work; and there is added two hundred several Figures of all sorts of Pies, Tarts, Custards, Cheesecakes, &c. more than was in the former: You will find them in Tables directed to the _Folio_ they have relation to; there being such variety of Forms, the Artists may use which of them they please.  It is impossible for any _Author_ to please all People, no more than the best Cook can fancy their Palats whose Mouths are always out of taste. As for those who make it their business to hide their Candle under a Bushel, to do only good to themselves, and not to others, such as will curse me for revealing the Secrets of this Art, I value the discharge of my own Conscience, in doing Good, above all their malice; protesting to the whole world, that I have not _concealed any material Secret_ of above my _fifty and five years Experience_; my Father _being a Cook_ under whom in my Child-hood I was bred up in this Art.  To conclude, the diligent Peruser of this _Volume_ gains that in a small time (as to the _Theory_) which an _Apprenticeship_ with some _Masters_ could never have taught them. I have no more to do, but to desire of God a blessing upon these my Endeavours; and remain.    _Yours in the most ingenious     ways of Friendship_,       ROBERT MAY.    Sholeby in Leicestershire,     _Sept. 30. 1664_.       _A short Narrative of some Passages of the Authors Life._   For the better knowledge of the worth of this Book, though it be not usual, the _Author_ being living, it will not be amiss to acquaint the _Reader_ with a breif account of some passages of his Life, as also the eminent Persons (renowned for their House-keeping) whom he hath served through the whole series of his Life; for as the growth of Children argue the strength of the Parents, so doth the judgment and abilities of the Artist conduce to the making and goodness of the Work: now that such great knowledge in this commendable Art was not gained but by long experience, practise, and converse with the most able men in their times, the _Reader_ in this breif Narrative may be informed by what steps and degrees he ascended to the same.  He was born in the year of our Lord 1588. His Father being one of the ablest _Cooks_ in his time, and his first Tutor in the knowledge and practice of Cookery; under whom having attained to some perfection in this Art, the old Lady _Dormer_ sent him over into _France_, where he continued five years, being in the Family of a noble Peer, and first President of _Paris_; where he gained not only the _French_ Tongue but also bettered his Knowledge in his _Cookery_, and returning again into _England_, was bound an Apprentice in _London_ to Mr. _Arthur Hollinsworth_ in _Newgate Market_, one of the ablest Work-men in _London_, Cook to the _Grocers Hall and Star Chamber_. His Apprentiship being out, the Lady _Dormer_ sent for him to be her Cook under Father (who then served that Honourable Lady) where were four Cooks more, such Noble Houses were then kept, the glory of that, and the shame of this present Age; then were those Golden Days wherein were practised the _Triumphs and Trophies of Cookery_; then was Hospitality esteemed, Neighbourhood preserved, the Poor cherished, and God honoured; then was Religion less talkt on, and more practised; then was Atheism & Schism less in fashion: then did men strive to be good, rather then to seem so. Here he continued till the Lady _Dormer_ died, and then went again to _London_, and served the Lord _Castlehaven_, after that the Lord _Lumley_, that great lover and knower of Art, who wanted no knowledge in the discerning this mystery; next the Lord _Montague_ in _Sussex_; and at the beginning of these wars, the Countess of _Kent_, then Mr. _Nevel_ of _Crissen Temple_ in _Essex_, whose Ancestors the _Smiths_ (of whom he is descended) were the greatest maintainers of Hospitality in all those parts; nor doth the present M. _Nevel_ degenerate from their laudable examples. Divers other Persons of like esteem and quality hath he served; as the Lord _Rivers_, Mr. _John Ashburnam_ of the Bed-Chambers, Dr. _Steed_ in _Kent_, Sir _Thomas Stiles_ of _Drury Lane_ in _London_, Sir _Marmaduke Constable_ in _York-shire_, Sir _Charles Lucas_; and lastly the Right Honourable the Lady _Englefield_, where he now liveth.  Thus have I given you a breif account of his Life, I shall next tell you in what high esteem this noble Art was with the Ancient Romans: _Plutarch_ reports, that _Lucullus_ his ordinary diet was fine dainty dishes, with works of pastry, banketting dishes, and fruit curiously wrought and prepared; that, his Table might be furnished with choice of varieties, (as the noble Lord _Lumley_ did) that he kept and nourished all manner of Fowl all the year long. To this purpose he telleth us a story how _Pompey_ being sick, the Physitians willed him to eat a Thrush, and it being said there was none to be had; because it was then Summer; it was answered they might have them at _Lucullus_'s house who kept both Thrushes and all manner of Fowl, all the year long. This _Lucullus_ was for his Hospitality so esteemed in _Rome_, that there was no talk, but of his Noble House-keeping. The said _Plutarch_ reports how _Cicero_ and _Pompey_ inviting themselves to sup with him, they would not let him speak with his men to provide any thing more then ordinary; but he telling them he would sup in _Apollo_, (a Chamber so named, and every Chamber proportioned their expences) he by this wile beguil'd them, and a supper was made ready estimated at fifty thousand pence, every _Roman_ penny being seven pence half penny _English_ money; a vast sum for that Age, before the _Indies_ had overflowed _Europe_. But I have too far digressed from the Author of whom I might speak much more as in relation to his Person and abilities, but who will cry out the Sun shines? this already said is enough to satisfie any but the malicious, who are the greatest enemies to all honest endeavours. _Homer_ had his _Zoilus_, and _Virgil_ his _Bavius_; the best Wits have had their detractors, and the greatest Artists have been maligned; the best on't is, such Works as these outlive their _Authors_ with an honurable respect of Posterity, whilst envious Criticks never survive their own happiness, their Lives going out like the snuff of a Candle.    _W. W._       _Triumphs and Trophies in Cookery, to be used at Festival Times,     as _Twelfth-day_, &c._   Make the likeness of a Ship in Paste-board, with Flags and Streamers, the Guns belonging to it of Kickses, bind them about with packthread, and cover them with close paste proportionable to the fashion of a Cannon with Carriages, lay them in places convenient as you see them in Ships of war, with such holes and trains of powder that they may all take Fire; Place your Ship firm in the great Charger; then make a salt round about it, and stick therein egg-shells full of sweet water, you may by a great Pin take all the meat out of the egg by blowing, and then fill it up with the rose-water, then in another Charger have the proportion of a Stag made of course paste, with a broad Arrow in the side of him, and his body filled up with claret-wine; in another Charger at the end of the Stag have the proportion of a Castle with Battlements, Portcullices, Gates and Draw-Bridges made of Past-board, the Guns and Kickses, and covered with course paste as the former; place it at a distance from the ship to fire at each other. The Stag being placed betwixt them with egg shells full of sweet water (as before) placed in salt. At each side of the Charger wherein is the Stag, place a Pye made of course paste, in one of which let there be some live Frogs, in each other some live Birds; make these Pyes of course Paste filled with bran, and yellowed over with saffron or the yolks of eggs, guild them over in spots, as also the Stag, the Ship, and Castle; bake them, and place them with guilt bay-leaves on turrets and tunnels of the Castle and Pyes; being baked, make a hole in the bottom of your pyes, take out the bran, put in your Frogs, and Birds, and close up the holes with the same course "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22790"],["title","The accomplisht cook (#2)"],["body","paste, then cut the Lids neatly up; To be taken off the Tunnels; being all placed in order upon the Table, before you fire the trains of powder, order it so that some of the Ladies may be perswaded to pluck the Arrow out of the Stag, then will the Claret-wine follow, as blood that runneth out of a wound. This being done with admiration to the beholders, after some short pause, fire the train of the Castle, that the pieces all of one side may go off, then fire the Trains, of one side of the Ship as in a battel; next turn the Chargers; and by degrees fire the trains of each other side as before. This done to sweeten the stink of powder, let the Ladies take the egg-shells full of sweet waters and throw them at each other. All dangers being seemingly over, by this time you may suppose they will desire to see what is in the pyes; where lifting first the lid off one pye, out skip some Frogs, which make the Ladies to skip and shreek; next after the other pye, whence come out the Birds, who by a natural instinct flying in the light, will put out the Candles; so that what with the flying Birds and skipping Frogs, the one above, the other beneath, will cause much delight and pleasure to the whole company: at length the Candles are lighted, and a banquet brought in, the Musick sounds, and every one with much delight and content rehearses their actions in the former passages. These were formerly the delight of the Nobility, before good House-keeping had left _England_, and the Sword really acted that which was only counterfeited in such honest and laudable Exercises as these.     [Decoration]    _On the Unparalell'd Piece of _Mr. May_ His Cookery._     See here a work set forth of such perfection,   Will praise it self, and doth not beg protection   From flatter'd greatness. Industry and pains   For gen'ral good, his aim, his Countrey gains;   Which ought respect him. A good _English_ Cook,   Excellent Modish Monsieurs, and that Book   Call'd _Perfect Cook_, _Merete's_ Pastery   Translated, looks like old hang'd Tapistry,   The wrong side outwards: so Monsieur adieu,   I'm for our Native _Mays_ Works rare and new,   Who with Antique could have prepar'd and drest   The Nations _quondam_ grand Imperial Feast,   Which that thrice Crown'd Third _Edward_ did ordain   For his high Order, and their Noble Train,   Whereon St. _George_ his famous Day was seen,   A Court on Earth that did all Courts out-shine.     And how all Rarities and Cates might be   Order'd for a Renown'd Solemnity,   Learn of this Cook, who with judgment, and reason,   Teacheth for every Time, each thing its true Season;   Making his Compounds with such harmony,   Taste shall not charge with superiority   Of Pepper, Salt, or Spice, by the best Pallat,   Or any one Herb in his broths or Sallat.   Where Temperance and Discretion guides his deeds;   _Satis_ his Motto, where nothing exceeds.   Or ought to wast, for there's good Husbandry   To be observ'd, as Art in Cookery.   Which of the Mathematicks doth pertake,   Geometry proportions when they bake.   Who can in paste erect (of finest flour)   A compleat Fort, a Castle, or a Tower.   A City Custard doth so subtly wind,   That should Truth seek, she'd scarce all corners find;   Platform of Sconces, that might Souldiers teach,   To fortifie by works as well as Preach.   I'le say no more; for as I am a sinner,   I've wrought my self a stomach to a dinner.   Inviting Poets not to tantalize,   But feast, (not surfeit) here their Fantasies.    _James Parry._     _To the Reader of (my very loving Friend) Mr. _Robert May_     his incomparable Book of Cookery._    See here's a Book set forth with such things in't,   As former Ages never saw in Print;   Something I'de write in praise on't, but the Pen,   Of Famous _Cleaveland_, or renowned _Ben_,   If unintomb'd might give this Book its due,   By their high strains, and keep it always new.   But I whose ruder Stile could never clime,   Or step beyond a home-bred Country Rhime,   Must not attempt it: only this I'le say,   _Cato_'s _Res Rustica_'s far short of _May_.   Here's taught to keep all sorts of flesh in date,   All sorts of Fish, if you will marinate;   To candy, to preserve, to souce, to pickle,   To make rare Sauces, both to please, and tickle   The pretty Ladies palats with delight;   Both how to glut, and gain an Appetite.   The Fritter, Pancake, Mushroom; with all these,   The curious Caudle made of Ambergriese.   He is so universal, he'l not miss,   The Pudding, nor Bolonian Sausages.   Italian, Spaniard, French, he all out-goes,   Refines their Kickshaws, and their Olio's,   The rarest use of Sweet-meats, Spicery,   And all things else belong to Cookery:   Not only this, but to give all content,   Here's all the Forms of every Implement   To work or carve with, so he makes the able   To deck the Dresser, and adorn the Table.   What dish goes first of every kind of Meat,   And so ye're welcom, pray fall too, and eat.   _Reader_, read on, for I have done; farewell,   The Book's so good, it cannot chuse but sell.    _Thy well-wishing Friend_,      John Town.

Thus with all meats sauce shall have the operation.       Directions for the order of carving Fowl.     _Lift that Swan._  The manner of cutting up a Swan must be to slit her right down in the middle of the breast, and so clean thorow the back from the neck to the rump, so part her in two halves cleanly and handsomly, that you break not nor tear the meat, lay the two halves in a fair charger with the slit sides downwards, throw salt about it, and let it again on the Table. Let your sauce be chaldron for a Swan, and serve it in saucers.     _Rear the Goose._  You must break a goose contrary to the former way. Take a goose being roasted, and take off both his legs fair like a shoulder of Lamb, take him quite from the body then cut off the belly piece round close to the lower end of the breast: lace her down with your knife clean through the breast on each side your thumbs bredth for the bone in the middle of the breast; then take off the pinion of each side, and the flesh which you first lac't with your knife, raise it up clear from the bone, and take it from the carcase with the pinion; then cut up the bone which lieth before in the breast (which is commonly call'd the merry thought) the skin and the flesh being upon it; then cut from the brest-bone, another slice of flesh clean thorow, & take it clean from the bone, turn your carcase, and cut it asunder the back-bone above the loin-bones: then take the rump-end of the back-bone, and lay it in a fair dish with the skinny-side upwards, lay at the fore-end of that the merry-thought with the skin side upward, and before that the apron of the goose; then lay your pinions on each side contrary, set your legs on each side contrary behind them, that the bone end of the legs may stand up cross in the middle of the dish, & the wing pinions on the outside of them; put under the wing pinions on each side the long slices of flesh which you cut from the breast bone, and let the ends meet under the leg bones, let the other ends lie cut in the dish betwixt the leg and the pinion; then pour your sauce into the dish under your meat, throw on salt, and set it on the table.     _To cut up a Turkey or Bustard._  Raise up the leg very fair, and open the joynt with the point of your knife, but take not off the leg; then lace down the breast with your knife on both sides, & open the breast pinion with the knife, but take not the pinion off; then raise up the merry-thought betwixt the breast bone, and the top of the merry-thought, lace down the flesh on both sides of the breast-bone, and raise up the flesh called the brawn, turn it outward upon both sides, but break it not, nor cut it not off; then cut off the wing pinion at the joynt next to the body, and stick on each side the pinion in the place where ye turned out the brawn, but cut off the sharp end "]]]
