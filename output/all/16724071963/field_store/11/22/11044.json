You don'd subbose I sdood up all der dime und ged in der vay der pullets uf? Vell, you may oxcuse me! I don'd like to peen a deat man alretty yet.\"  \"That's all right, Hans. I admire your judgment.\"  \"Dank you, Vrankie. I admire der vay you vork dose revolfers. Dot peat der pand, und don'd you vorged him!\"  At this moment, a horse with a double burden swept past in the flare of light.  \"Help! Frank--Frank Merriwell! Help--save me!\"  \"Merciful goodness!\" cried Frank. \"It is the professor's voice!\"  \"Und he vos on dot horse!\"  \"Yes--a captive!\"  \"Dot's vat he vos!\"  \"Our own horses--where are they? We must pursue! What have become of our horses?\"  \"Dose pandits haf dooken them, I susbect.\"  This was true; Frank had killed two of the horses belonging to the bandits, but the desperadoes had escaped with the three animals hired by our friends.  But that was not the worst, for Professor Scotch had been captured and carried away by the bold ruffians.  Frank heard the professor's appeals for help, and heard a mocking, cold-blooded laugh that he knew came from the lips of Carlos Merriwell.  Then the clatter of hoofs passed on down the street, growing fainter and fainter, till they left the town for the open plain, and finally died out in the night.     CHAPTER VI.  CARRIED INTO THE MOUNTAINS.   In vain, Frank attempted to organize a party to pursue the bandits. The citizens of Mendoza were completely terrorized, and they had no heart to follow the desperadoes out upon the plain, which was the bandits' own stamping ground.  Frank urged, entreated, begged, and finally grew furious, but he simply wasted his breath.  \"No, no, se単or,\" protested a Mexican. \"You no find anybody dat chase Pacheco dis night--no, no, not much!\"  \"Pacheco? You don't mean to say--you can't mean----\"  \"Dat was Pacheco and his band, se単or.\"  Frank groaned.  \"Pacheco!\" he muttered, huskily; \"Pacheco, the worst wretch in all Mexico! He is utterly heartless, and the professor will---- But Pacheco is not the worst!\" he suddenly gasped. \"There is Carlos Merriwell, who must be one of the bandits. He may take a fancy to torture Professor Scotch simply because the professor is my guardian.\"  \"What you say, se単or?\" asked the curious Mexican. \"I do not understand all dat you speak.\"  Frank turned away, with a gesture of despair.  \"Vot you goin's to done, Vrankie?\" asked Hans, dolefully.  \"I do not seem to be able to do anything now. This matter must be placed before the authorities, but I do not fancy that will amount to anything. The officers here are afraid of the bandits, and the government is criminally negligent in the matter of pushing and punishing the outlaws. The capture of an American to be held for ransom will be considered by them as a very funny joke.\"  \"Vell, I don'd seen vot you goin' to done apout it.\"  \"I do not see myself, but, come on, and we will find out.\"  He sought the highest officials of the town, and laid the matter before them. In the most polite manner possible, they protested their pained solicitation and commiseration, but when he urged them to do something, they replied:  \"To-morrow, se単or, or the next day, we will see what we may be able to do.\"  \"To-morrow!\" cried Frank, desperately. \"With you everything is to-morrow, to-morrow! To-day, to-night, now is the time to do something! Delays are fatal, particularly in pursuing bandits and kidnapers.\"  But they shook their heads sadly, and continued to express sympathy and regret, all the while protesting it would be impossible to do anything before to-morrow or the next day.  Frank was so furious and desperate that he even had thought of following the bandits with Hans as an only companion, but the man of whom he had obtained the horses in the first place would not let him have other animals.  That was not all. This man had gone through some kind of proceeding to lawfully seize Frank and Hans and hold them till the animals captured by the bandits were paid for at the price he should name, and this he proceeded to do.  Now, Frank did not have the price demanded for the three horses, and he could not draw it that night, so he was obliged to submit, and the two boys were prisoners till near three o'clock the next afternoon, when the money was obtained and the bill paid.  At the hotel Frank found a letter awaiting him, and, to his unbounded amazement, it was from the professor.  With haste he tore it open, and these words are what he read:       \"DEAR FRANK: Pacheco commands me to write this letter. We are at      the headwaters of the Rio de Nieves, but we move on to the westward      as soon as I have written. He tells me we are bound for the      mountains beyond Huejugilla el Alto, which is directly west of      Zacatecas as the bird flies one hundred and ten miles. He bids me      tell you to follow to Huejugilla el Alto, where he says      arrangements will be made for my ransom. Remember Jack Burk. He      spoke of the mountains to the west of Zacatecas. Pacheco threatens      to mutilate me and forward fragments to you if you do not follow to      the point specified. He is watching me as I write, and one of his      men will carry this letter to Mendoza, and deliver it. The      situation is desperate, and it strikes me that it is best to comply      with Pacheco's demands in case you care to bother about me. If you      want me to be chopped up bit by bit and forwarded to you, do not      bother to follow. I have no doubt but Pacheco will keep his word to      the letter in this matter. I am, my dear boy, your devoted guardian      and tutor,                                              \"HORACE ORMAN TYLER SCOTCH.\"  That this letter was genuine there could be no doubt, as it was written in the professor's peculiar style of chirography; but it did not sound like the professor, and Frank knew well enough that it had been written under compulsion, and the language had been dictated by another party.  \"Poor old professor!\" murmured the boy. \"Poor old professor! He shall be saved! He shall be saved! He knows I will do everything I can for him.\"  \"Yah, but he don'd seem to say dot der ledder in,\" observed Hans, who had also read every word.  \"Huejugilla el Alto is one hundred and ten miles west of Zacatecas.\"  \"Vere you belief they findt dot name, Vrankie?\"  Frank did not mind the Dutch lad's question, but bowed his head on his hand, and fell to thinking.  \"We must have horses, and we must follow. 'Remember Jack Burk.' Surely the professor put that part of the letter in of his own accord. He did not speak of the Silver Palace, but he wished to call it to my mind. That palace, according to Burk, lies directly west of Zacatecas, somewhere amid the mountains beyond this place he has mentioned. The professor meant for me to understand that I would be proceeding on my way to search for the palace. Perhaps he hopes to escape.\"  \"Yah,\" broke in Hans, \"berhaps he meant to done dot, Vrankie.\"  \"We would be very near the mountains--it must be that we would be in the mountains.\"  \"I guess dot peen shust apoudt vere we peen, Vrankie.\"  \"If he escaped, or should be rescued or ransomed, we could easily continue the search for the palace.\"  \"You vos oxactly righdt.\"  \"We must have horses and a guide.\"  \"We can ged dem mit money.\"  \"We had better proceed to Zacatecas, and procure the animals and the guide there.\"  \"Shust oxactly vot I vould haf suggestet, Vrankie.\"  \"We will lose no time about it.\"  \"Vell, I guess nod!\"  \"But Carlos--Carlos, my cousin. It is very strange, but Professor Scotch does not mention him.\"  \"Py shimminy! dot peen der trute!\"  \"And I am certain it was Carlos that captured the professor. I heard the fellow laugh--his wicked, triumphant laugh!\"  \"I heardt dot meinseluf, Vrankie.\"  \"Carlos must be with the band.\"  \"Yah.\"  \"And Pacheco is carrying this matter out to suit my cousin.\"  \"Yah.\"  \"Hans, it is possible you had better remain behind.\"  \"Vot vos dot?\" gurgled the Dutch lad, in blank amazement. \"Vot for vos I goin' to gone pehindt und stay, Vrankie?\"  \"I see a trap in this--a plot to lead me into a snare and make me a captive.\"  \"Vell, don'd I stood ub und took mein medicine mit you all der dimes? Vot vos der maddetr mit me? Vos you lost your courage in me alretty yet?\"  \"Hans, I have no right to take you into such danger. Without doubt, a snare will be spread for me, but I am going to depend on fate to help me to avoid it.\"  \"Vell, I took some stock dot fate in meinseluf.\"  \"If I should take you along and you were killed----\"  \"I took your chances on dot, mein poy. Vot vos I draveling aroundt mit you vor anyhow you vant to know, ain'dt id?\"  \"You are traveling for pleasure, and not to fight bandits.\"  \"Uf dot peen a bard der bleasure uf, you don'd haf some righdt to rob me uf id. Vrank Merriwell, dit you efer know me to gone pack mit you on?\"  \"No, Hans.\"  \"Dot seddles dot. You nefer vill. Shust count me indo dis racket. I am going righdt along mit you, und don'd you rememper dot!\"  Frank laughed.  \"Hans,\" he said, \"you are true blue. We will stick by each other till the professor is saved from Pacheco and Carlos Merriwell.\"  \"Yah, we done dot.\"  They clasped hands, and that point was settled.     CHAPTER VII.  THE CAMP IN THE DESERT.   Without unnecessary delay, they took the train from Mendoza to Zacatecas, which was a much larger place.  In Zacatecas they set about the task of finding a reliable guide, which was no easy matter, as they soon discovered.  The Mexican half-bloods were a lazy, shiftless set, and the full-blooded Spaniards did not seem to care about taking the trip across the desert.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22424"],["title","Frank Merriwell Down South (#6)"],["body","late that night Frank searched in vain for the man he wanted, and he was finally forced to give up the task till another day.  Such a delay made him very impatient, and he felt much like starting out without a guide, depending on a compass, with which he believed he would be able to make his way due west to Huejugilla el Alto.  The landlord of the hotel at which they stopped that night was a fine-appearing man, and Frank ventured to lay the matter before him.  The landlord listened to the entire story, looking very grave, shook his head warningly, and said:  \"Do not think of attempting to cross the desert alone, young se単ors. Without a guide you might get lost and perish for water. By all means, take a guide.\"  \"But how are we to obtain a trustworthy guide, sir?\"  \"That is truly a problem, but I think I may be able to assist you in the morning.\"  \"If you can, it will be a great favor.\"  \"Many thanks, young se単or. I will see what can be done. If you would take my advice, you would not go to Huejugilla el Alto.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"It is far from the railroad, and is situated in a very wild region. If you were to go there and should never be heard of again, it would not be easy for your friends to discover what had become of you. Pacheco directed you to go there, and he means you no good. It is likely you will walk into a trap that Pacheco has set for you.\"  \"I have considered that,\" said Frank, quietly; \"and I have decided to go.\"  \"Oh, very well,\" with a gesture expressive of regret. \"I know it is quite impossible to change the determination of you Americans. If you have firmly decided to go, you will go, even though you knew all the deadly dangers that may lie in wait for you.\"  Being again assured that the landlord would do his best to obtain a guide, Frank proposed to retire for the night.  For all of the troubles that beset him, Frank was able to sleep soundly, having trained himself to sleep under almost any circumstances. Hans also slept and snored, to be awakened in the morning by Frank, who was shaking him roughly.  \"Come, Hans, it is time we were stirring.\"  \"Vot vos dot?\" cried the Dutch lad, in surprise. \"We don'd peen asleep more as fifteen minutes alretty yet.\"  \"It is morning.\"  \"I don'd toldt you so! Vell, dot peats der pand!\"  Hans got up and dressed with great reluctance, yawning, and declaring over and over that the nights in Mexico were not more than fifteen or twenty minutes in length.  The landlord had prepared a special breakfast for them, and it proved the best they had found since leaving \"the States,\" so they ate heartily and felt much better afterward.  After breakfast the landlord himself informed them that he had been able to obtain a guide.  \"He is the very person you want, young se単ors, for he knows the desert and he knows the mountains. You may depend on him to lead you straight across to Huejugilla el Alto.\"  The guide was waiting for them, wrapped to his chin in a crimson poncho, and smoking a cigarette. He was a dark-faced, somewhat sinister-looking fellow, and he gave his name as Pedro.  While Frank did not like the appearance of the man, he felt that it was not policy to delay longer, and a bargain was soon made. Pedro not only agreed to take them quickly across the desert, but he contracted to furnish horses for them.  The forenoon was not far advanced when they rode out of Zacatecas, and, with the sun at their backs, headed toward the west.  Before the day passed Pedro showed by many things that he was quite familiar with the desert. He knew where shade and water were to be found, and, at noonday, they rested long beside a spring, with the sun beating on the wide waste of sand, over which the heat haze danced, and where no cooling breath seemed astir.  The heat affected Hans much more than it did Frank. The Dutch boy suffered, but he made no complaint.  With the sun well over into the western sky, they pushed onward again. They did not halt as the grateful shadows of night lay on the desert, but followed Pedro on and on.  At last, far across the desert, they saw the twinkling of a light that seemed like a fallen star.  \"It's a camp-fire,\" declared Pedro, in Spanish. \"Who can be there?\"  \"It may be bandits,\" suggested Frank, somewhat wary.  \"No,\" declared the guide, \"bandits do not build fires on the open plains. Bandits it cannot be.\"  He did not hesitate to lead them straight toward the fire.  Frank whispered to Hans:  \"Have your weapons ready. This may be the trap.\"  As they approached the fire, they were able to make out the figures of two or three horses, but no human being was to be seen, although a coffeepot sat on some coals, fragrant steam rising from the nozzle.  Pedro stopped, seeming somewhat uneasy for the first time.  \"What is it?\" asked Frank, with apprehension.  \"Yah, vot id vos?\" asked Hans. \"Vos der camp left all alone mit ids lonesome?\"  \"Not that, se単ors; but we have been heard, and the ones at the camp are hiding and watching.\"  \"Vell, I like dot. Maype dey haf der trop on us alretty soon.\"  \"That is likely,\" said Frank.  Pedro called out something in Spanish, but there was no answer, save that one of the horses lifted its head and neighed.  Then Frank tried it in English:  \"Ho, the camp! Who is there, and where are you?\"  Almost instantly a man's voice replied:  \"I'm out hyar whar I kin take a peep at yer, as I heard yer comin'. Didn't know but you wus Greasers, an' I ain't got no use fer ther onery varmints. As yer kin talk United States, just move right up ter the fire and join me at supper.\"  There was a hearty freedom about the invitation that dispelled Frank's fears immediately, and they rode forward into the firelight.  As they did so, a man rose from where he had been stretched on the sand, and came forward to meet them.  \"Great Scott!\" shouted Frank, as the firelight fell on the man's face. \"It's Alwin Bushnell, Jack Burk's partner!\"     CHAPTER VIII.  THE TREASURE SEEKER.   \"Thet thar's my handle,\" acknowledged the man; \"but I'm strapped ef I understand how you 'uns happen ter know it!\"  He stared at the boys and the guide in blank amazement. Seeing Pedro's face fairly, he gave a slight start, and then looked still more closely.  \"There's no doubt,\" palpitated Frank; \"you are Alwin Bushnell?\"  \"That's me,\" nodded the camper.  \"And you are alone?\"  \"Certun sure.\"  \"Bound west?\"  \"I reckon.\"  \"For the mountains and the Silver----\"  Frank caught himself, and stopped short, remembering Pedro, and knowing the guide's ears and eyes were wide open to hear and see everything.  Bushnell fell back a step, a look of still greater surprise coming to his bronzed and bearded face.  \"W'at's thet thar you wus goin' ter say?\" he demanded.  \"Wait,\" said Frank, \"I will tell you later. It is better.\"  Plainly, Alwin Bushnell was puzzled, and not a little amazed.  \"You know my handle, an' you seem ter know whatever way I'm trailin'. This yere lays over me, as I acknowledges instanter.\"  \"That's not hard to explain.\"  \"Then I begs yer to explain it without delay.\"  \"Your partner told us of you.\"  \"Old Jack?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"When, and whar?\"  \"Two days ago, outside of Mendoza.\"  \"He wuz thar?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"But how did yer know me?\"  \"We saw you.\"  \"When?\"  \"When you were pursued across the plain by bandits.\"  Bushnell slapped his thigh.  \"Thar!\" he cried; \"I remembers yer now! You wuz near a doby hut, an' yer opened up on ther pizen skunks as wuz arter me.\"  \"That's right.\"  \"Wall, I'm much obliged, fer you socked ther lead ter them critters so they switched off an' let me get away. You kin shoot, boy.\"  \"Some.\"  \"Some! Wa'al, that's right, you bet! Give us a wag of your fin! I'm mortal glad ter clap peepers on yer, fer I never expected ter see yer an' thank yer fer thet trick.\"  Frank swung from the saddle, and surrendered his hand into the broad \"paw\" of the rough and hearty Westerner, who gave it a crushing grip and a rough shake, repeating:  \"I'm mortal glad ter see yer, thet's whatever! But I want ter know how you happened to chip inter thet thar little game. You took a hand at jest ther right time ter turn ther run of ther cards, an' I got out without goin' broke.\"  \"I chipped in because I saw you were a white man, and you were hard pressed by a villainous crew who must be bandits. I believe in white men standing by white men.\"  \"Say, thet's a great motter, young man. 'White men stand by white men.' As fer me, I don't like a Greaser none whatever.\"  As he said this, Bushnell gave Pedro another searching look, and the guide scowled at the ground in a sullen way.  \"Now,\" continued the Westerner, \"w'at I wants ter know next is w'at yer knows about Jack Burk. We had a place all agreed on ter meet w'en I returned, but he wusn't thar, an' I hed ter go it alone. That's why I'm yere alone.\"  \"It was not Burk's fault that he did not meet you.\"  \"Say you so? Then lay a straight trail fer me ter foller.\"  \"He was sick.\"  \"Is that whatever? Wa'al, derned ef I could seem ter cut his trail anywhar I went, an' I made a great hustle fer it.\"  \"He was in the hut where you saw us.\"  \"Wa'al, dern my skin! Ef I'd knowed thet, I'd made a straight run fer thet yere ranch, bet yer boots!\"  \"He came to the door, and shouted to you.\"  \"You don't tell me thet! An' I didn't hear him! Wa'al, wa'al! Whar wuz my ears? Whar is he now?\"  \"Dead.\"  Bushnell reeled.  \"Is he that?\" he gasped, recovering. \"An' I didn't get to see him! Say, this clean upsets me, sure as shootin'!\"  The man seemed greatly affected.  \"Poor old Jack!\" he muttered. \"We've made many a tramp together, an' we struck it rich at last, but he'll never git ther good of thet thar strike.\"  Then he seemed to remember that he was watched by several eyes, and he straightened up, passing his hand over his face.  \"Jack shall hev a big monumint,\" he cried. \"Tell me whar my old pard is planted.\"  \"That is something I do not know, Mr. Bushnell.\"  The man was astonished.  \"Don't know? Why, how's thet?\"  Frank told the entire story of Burk's"]]]
