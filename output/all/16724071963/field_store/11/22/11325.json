Had the toothache again to-day, he told me. Here he comes, now.\"  A lanky boy of fifteen or sixteen got into the vacant seat just as the chaplain rose to say grace. After grace no loud talking was permitted, but no objection was made to whispered conversations that did not become too noisy.  \"How's it come you go to town so often and I don't ever get to go, Nixy?\" whispered Glen, the moment grace was ended.  \"One thing you don't have the toothache, another thing you get too many demerits. The fellows that get to town have to go thirty days without a black sign. You never could do it, Glen.\"  \"I could if I wanted. I'm twenty days now. Wouldn't hurt me to go another ten. If I went to town alone I'd never come back.\"  \"It ain't so easy, Glen. You have to wear your uniform so everybody knows what you are. If you aren't back by six o'clock they have the police after you. The old man made a great talk about his honor system, but as long as you have to wear your uniform there's plenty of people to watch you.\"  \"I could find a way to get around that,\" insisted Glen.  \"Well, so could I. I've got one all planned out that I'm going to work some day. I'll get leave to go to the dentist late some afternoon. The car to come back leaves his office at five o'clock. He doesn't want to stay until five because he goes off to play golf. So he'll leave me in his waiting-room when he goes. I'll have a suit of overalls rolled up under my uniform. Soon as the doctor goes I'll change my clothes. You can't get out without being seen but I'll hide right there in the building till it closes and then get down the fire-escape.\"  \"I guess somebody'd see you go down and a policeman would get you.\"  \"I guess they wouldn't. I wouldn't try till late at night when there wasn't anybody around. Then I'd pick a dark night, and that fire-escape is in the back end of the building, so I guess there wouldn't nobody see me.\"  \"Oh, mebbe there wouldn't. Supposin' you did get away. Where'd you go?\"  \"I'd have that all fixed. I'd put on my other clothes and pitch my uniform away and that night would get me twenty-five miles where nobody'd think of looking for me.\"  \"Oh, I dunno. I guess you'd be easy picked up. Anybody could tell you a mile off. All to do is to look for a broom handle out walking all by itself.\"  \"Broom handle yourself, Glen Mason. I've got the makings of a big man if ever I'd get enough to eat.\"  \"You go high enough up to be a big man, but you've stretched too much. If you'd ever learn to be a contortionist and tie yourself into three knots close together, you'd do better.\"  \"You're always saying something mean. I wish I hadn't told you my plan at all.\"  \"I won't do anything to your old plan.\"  \"I ain't so sure. 'Twouldn't be above ye to steal it.\"  \"I s'pose you dare me to do it.\"  \"Yes, I dare ye to do it.\"  \"An' you think I'd steal a plan from a mate?\"  \"I think you'd do anything.\"  There were many who had just as poor an opinion of Glen. He himself found it remarkably easy to do mean and low acts and had almost ceased to wonder at himself. Every day seemed to find a lower level for his setting. Nixon had correctly guessed his thoughts. Already he was turning over in his mind the feasibility of Nixon's plan of escape and wondering if he could himself take advantage of it. He had been in the reform school over a year, but it had not reformed him. The new superintendent, with his kindness, had won the hearts of many of the most wayward boys, but no impression had he made on Glen. As a matter of fact the boy rather laughed at his foolishness. To put boys on their honor, to trust the merit boys to go into town without guard, all was new policy, and the only interest Glen had in it was to take advantage of it. Let him get one single chance to go to town alone and the reform school would see no more of him. Just what he would do he did not know. Sometimes a fleeting thought of going home to see the mother whose heart must be almost broken by his waywardness and the young sister and brother who were carefully guarded from knowledge of the disgrace he had brought upon them would come to him. But though he was supposed to be dead to impulses for reform there always crept into his mind the desire that his return home should be only when he had enough money and enough honor so that he should not be welcomed as a penitent but as a conquering hero. Glen was much given to great thoughts of the mighty things he would do and the high stations he would occupy. Unfortunately his pride of thought had never made him insist that his inclination yield to right instead of to desire. Glen Mason's fault was easily summed up--he desired always his own way and had so allowed this inclination to fill his life that he was utterly regardless of others. Given his own way he was a pleasant chum, a good friend and a brave comrade.  When Glen wanted a thing very badly he would go to great lengths to get it. Having set for his goal the thirty days of good behavior marks he was bound to win it, though greatly to the surprise of the officers who had never known Glen to pass so long a time without fracturing a great number of rules. No sooner was his time up than he asked leave to go to town to visit the dentist.  The Superintendent was rather disturbed by the request. He had been both pleased and surprised by Glen's good behavior. Now that the boy had earned the privilege of going to town without guard he did not wish to spoil his good work by a refusal to trust him. Yet he was suspicious. He asked that Glen be sent to the office.  \"Why do you want to go to the dentist, Glen?\" he asked kindly. \"What attention do your teeth need?\"  Glen was confused. So far as he knew his teeth were sound as bullets. He had not sunk to the place where lies were easy of expression.  \"I don't know just what, sir,\" he stammered, wishing that he could think of something. \"The dentist will know what they need.\"  This was as good an answer as he could have made, although stumbled on by chance.  \"You want the dentist to go over them to find what is the matter, do you?\" said the soft-hearted superintendent.  \"Yes, sir. I want the dentist to find what is the matter.\"  \"It isn't a bad idea,\" said the superintendent. \"It won't be necessary for you to go to town, though, for the dentist is coming out here next week.\"  \"But I don't want to wait until next week,\" cried Glen. \"I want to go to-day. I want him to pull one out.\"  \"Which one?\" inquired the superintendent.  It made little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22644"],["title","The Boy Scout Treasure Hunters; Or, The Lost Treasure of Buffalo Hollow (#1)"],["body","to Glen which tooth he denoted for the sacrifice. Now that he had told the lie he would stay by it. He pointed to a big double tooth and resolved that he would remember it.  The superintendent looked at the tooth and at the boy.  \"Perhaps you don't know how much that tooth is worth?\"  \"No, sir,\" agreed Glen.  \"A very conservative price is a hundred dollars, at your age. You wouldn't throw a hundred dollars away.\"  \"No, sir; but I want it pulled.\"  It was all very well to talk of a hundred dollars, but when Glen had his mind set on a matter he would make any sacrifice.  \"Well, you must not have it pulled. But have the dentist look at it. I will give you a pass for this afternoon. You will wear your uniform, walk to the car line and take the street car to the dentist's office. Let me ask you one thing, Glen. Don't forget to come back.\"  It was as if the superintendent read his thoughts. Glen changed color and looked foolish. He could think of only one thing to say. \"At what time, sir?\"  \"You will be in by six o'clock. As you go to town and see the boys at liberty on the streets remember that if you keep up your good behavior you may soon be paroled and be as free as they. All you have to do, Glen, is to keep it up.\"  As he went to put on his uniform, the hated uniform that made it so hard for him to lose himself in the crowd, Glen realized better how it was that Nixon and some of the others who had been given liberty in town had never violated their trust. It seemed abominably mean and small to go back on a man like this. He actually began to have his own doubts. But it was very hard for Glen Mason to give up anything on which he had set his heart.  There were several things went wrong which were quite disturbing. In the first place he was obliged to change his clothing under the eye of the physical director which utterly spoiled any scheme of hiding a suit of overalls under his uniform. The walk to the street car and the ride to the doctor's office would have been very enjoyable had not every one stared at him and his uniform. More than once he heard some one say \"There goes a reform school boy.\" Then the dentist did all manner of things in his efforts to find the nonexistent aching tooth. Finally he did find an area of tenderness in an entirely different tooth to the one specified.  \"Does this tooth hurt you more than the others!\" he asked.  \"It does,\" Glen agreed, quite truthfully, an involuntary \"Ouch\" following his words.  \"I thought as much,\" the doctor observed. \"It is often hard to locate the pain definitely. The nerve reflexes are responsible for it. I will now drill into this and see what we find.\"  \"Do you have to drill?\" asked Glen.  \"Surely. Have to clean out all the old decayed tooth before I fill it. I often give the boys from the school a little sermon by telling them the bad has to be cleaned out before you get sound living.\"  \"Make it as easy as you can,\" Glen requested.  \"Yes, of course. But cleaning out decay often hurts.\"  It did hurt but Glen would have fainted rather than make an outcry.  The doctor stepped to the 'phone and called up the superintendent.  \"It's all right with the Mason boy,\" he said. \"I've done all I can to-day for him. I'm leaving now. What shall he do until time for his car.\"  He turned to Glen as he received a reply.  \"You are to wait until five o'clock in my reception room and then take the inter-urban car,\" he said, locking the inner office when they passed out. \"I am leaving a little early to-night.\"  Before he left he stepped into a little closet which led out of the reception room and changed his office clothes. Glen's eyes sparkled. His problem was solved.  At five o'clock Glen Mason rode down in the elevator to the ground floor and asked the elevator man how he could identify the inter-urban car. But instead of leaving the building he dodged back to the stairway as soon as the elevator had started on its return trip and ran stealthily up the stairs and again entered the dentist's reception room. It was empty. Glen boldly entered the little closet and dressing himself in the dentist's office clothes made a bundle of his uniform. The closet was both deep and high. He climbed to the top shelf and shoved his bundle far back over its wide surface against the wall. He dared not risk going out in the doctor's clothing in daylight. He must stay until the building was deserted and use the fire escape. His great fear was lest some one should come to the reception room. The only safeguard was concealment in the hot, dark closet. He waited hours without any disturbance. He felt sure that it must be almost midnight. Stealthily he opened the door of the closet and stepped to a window. It was still daylight, though the sun was setting. He returned to his closet.  It must have been some hours afterward that he heard footsteps and voices outside the door. In sudden desperation he climbed up and lay flat on the wide shelf where he had hidden the uniform. Someone opened the door of the closet, glanced inside and shut it again.  \"I tell you I took him down about five o'clock and showed him his car. He ain't here,\" said the voice of the elevator man.  \"I have to make sure,\" replied his companion.  Glen knew the voice for that of one of the school officials. So already they were seeking him!  After all was quiet Glen ventured to open the closet door and peep out. It was dark now but there were lights in the hall. After a long time they were extinguished and the building seemed deserted. The last late worker departed. The elevator ceased its rhythmic motion.  Glen waited yet longer for a time and then crept down the hall to the fire-escape, which he made out by a red light. It was a dark night, but, nerved to the act, he made no hesitation as he swung himself out on to the iron bars. It was an old-fashioned escape, bars at wide intervals so close to the wall as to leave hardly a toe hold. Down, down he went, not daring to look to see where he was going but clinging fast and letting one step follow another. Then suddenly the ladder stopped. Feel as he would, in this direction or in that, there were no more steps. He had known of fire-escapes ending ten or twelve feet from the ground with an extension which might be lowered. But he found no extension. He looked down, but it was black night and he could see nothing but shadowy outlines. Looking up, the ladder soon disappeared in the darkness. There was no sense in mounting again. He let down his legs as far as he could reach, with his body balanced on his elbows, then he let himself hang by his hands and kicked out in the hope of finding some landing. There was nothing to be felt but the brick wall. His arms grew tired as he swung. His efforts to draw up again were ineffectual. In desperation he swung off into space.  Splash! He was choking and gasping in water!     CHAPTER II  A FRIEND AND A FOE   Splashing about in his watery quarters Glen speedily discovered that he had fallen into an enormous rain barrel. He was able to reach the top with his hands, and lost no time in drawing himself up and crawling over the side. Then he stood in the shelter of the barrel and wrung a gallon or so of water out of the doctor's clothes. When the job was finished he had pretty well destroyed the identity of that suit of clothing. The draggled, wrinkled and stained garments bore no resemblance to the neat office suit. His mishap had given material help in effecting a disguise.  He struck out away from the town and met no one to interfere with him as he walked along the quiet residence streets. Just at the edge of the city he was attracted by a great illumination. It was the electric lighting of a park, which even at that hour was thronged with visitors. The boy who had been shut up for a year and more looked hungrily through the great entrance way. It was free to all. He walked cautiously in, keeping a suspicious eye wide for policemen; for though he thought he was free he was in bondage to his guilty conscience.  Of the many attractions the one which made the greatest appeal to Glen--and the only one he could afford, for his sole fortune was the nickel he had for car-fare--was the merry-go-round with its gaudy horses and its gurdy tunes. He bought a ticket and mounted one of the turbulent steeds with a little thrill of anticipatory pleasure. The music began, the movement gradually quickened, and he was just giving himself up to the pleasure of it when he saw working toward him, on the inside running-board, a man collecting tickets. On his coat was the nickeled badge of a constable. Glen did not know that he was a special officer for the sole purpose of protecting his own outfit against rowdies. In his eyes it was the approach of the law. Although they were now swinging round at a good rate he slipped from his horse and jumped, at peril of his neck. The sight of an official badge struck terror to his soul.  So it was wherever he went. He saw in every man an officer. One might have supposed the park policed by an army. He had just dodged one of the two real park policemen when he overheard a momentous conversation.  A man from the bathhouse came by.  \"Anything doing, Jake?\" he asked the officer.  \"Nothing much,\" replied the policeman. \"They 'phoned us a boy got away from the reform school. They think he might just have come out to the park for fun and overstayed. Ain't seen any one, have ye?\"  \"Not me.\"  \"Well, if he's in here we'll get him as he goes out. I'll watch one gate and Barney the other.\"  So they were on the look out for him. But there was nothing in his present clothing to suggest the reform school boy, and though he was hatless there were numbers of hatless boys in the park. There were many people of all kinds, in fact, and if he went with the crowd, he could surely slip out unnoticed. Yet he feared to attempt to pass the representative of the law at the gate. How conscience doth make cowards of us all!  It was a good deed, done"]]]
