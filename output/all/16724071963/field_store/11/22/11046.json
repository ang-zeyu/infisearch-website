Every time Joe's big dog comes along the kitten climbs    a tree and the............. cannot follow.   3 Anna had never seen a squirrel in her life, although she had always    wanted to very much.

The raven    saw that the swan lived in the water, and thought it was the water that    made the swan's feathers so white. So the............. decided to wash    his feathers every day to see if it would not make them..............   8 Birds' eggs are almost as different from each other as are the birds    themselves. The robin lays four or five blue eggs. The dove lays two    white eggs. The sparrow lays six or eight speckled eggs. If we should    find a nest with four blue eggs in it, we could be pretty sure that it    was the nest of a............. rather than of a............. or dove.   9 Once there lived on a mountain near a village an immense giant whose    cruelty kept the people of the village in great terror. However, there    was one person in the village who was not afraid of the giant. This was    a young soldier who carried a magic sword that a fairy had given him.    Once when the............. came down from the............. the    soldier attacked him with his magic............. and killed him.  10 Once a hen was so foolish as to go to a fox and ask him to look after    her chicks while she went to the barnyard to find some worms for her    chicks. The fox was of course quite willing. The hen was gone a long    time. When she finally returned, she found that the fox had eaten all    her chicks.

Miss Cabot left Richard in the carriage,    walked quickly to the door, and sending up her card by the servant,    requested to see Mr. Smith. The............. soon returned and begged    her to come in. As soon as she had done so. Miss Cabot introduced    herself to Mr.............. and begged him to come out and talk with    ............., who was waiting outside in the carriage.  15 Joe made up a game which he called \"Jac-alack.\" One person called Jack    must climb a tree and hang by his arms from a low bough. The others    stand behind him and say in unison, \"Alas, alack, he fell on his back,\"    and while they are saying it, one of them hits Jack with a bean bag. If    Jack can see or guess who did it, he may drop down, and the guilty    person takes his place. Otherwise he has to............. there for    another turn and sing out, \"Alas, alack, another whack.\" It is quite a    game and Jack must have strong..............  16 It is well established that the bee, which is commonly supposed to be    so industrious, really works only two or three hours a day.

The motto of the worker is, \"I owe the world a life,\" and the motto of    the.................. is, \"The.................. owes me a living.\"  22 Caution, when not present in excess, is a desirable trait. Often it    saves one from disappointment or failure. Occasionally, however, one    finds a person so extremely.................. that his will is    paralyzed and he is totally unable to set about any new undertaking.    Too much.................. is indeed often.................. than too    little.  23 A whale is not a fish, even though it does live in water. A fish has no    lungs, is cold-blooded, and absorbs oxygen from the water through its    gills; but a whale is warm-blooded and has a genuine set of lungs. In    consequence, in bodily structure the is.................. like a    shark, which is a true fish, than it is like a horse.  24 The brook on our farm has many whims. It ripples over bright and shiny    rocks, and falls into a placid little pool so clear that I can see the    pebbles on the bottom and can see myself down there, too. As I look    straight down, it is hard to tell whether what I see is my nose or a    .................., but as I move a little, that which I sec stands    still, so I know it is not.....................................

The ambitious person may    think that he merely thirsts to \"do something\" or \"be somebody\" but    really what he craves is to figure potently in the minds of others, to    be greatly loved, admired, or feared. To reap a success which no one    .................. does not satisfy the yearnings of the    .................. individual.  26 Washington was a very silent man. Of no man in the world's history do    we have so few sayings of a personal kind. As for talking about    himself, that was something in which he almost never indulged. Yet it    would be a great error to interpret his.................. as an    indication that he was in any sense cold or unfeeling.  27 As a rule, it is more economical to remember things by associating them    clearly and vigorously than by going through many repetitions of them.    Thus, a clear understanding of the causes for the Democratic victory in    the national election in 1916 will be.................. effective in    remembering the fact than a dozen.................. of the statement    \"Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1916.\"  28 Fundamentally, education depends upon the capacity of a person to    profit by past experiences. Past situations modify present and future    adjustments. Education in its broadest sense means acquiring    experiences that serve to.................. existing inherited or    acquired tendencies of behavior.  29 \"Naรฏve\" and \"unsophisticated\" are frequently confused. The former    suggests a type of behavior which is artless, spontaneous, and free    from the restraints of custom. The latter implies fully as great lack    of knowledge of social usage, and, in addition, conduct which is    primitive and perchance inelegant. Thus, the.................. youth    was the first to enter the car, and his.................. little    sister warmly kissed him in the presence of the king. We may also say    that a country boy is.................. with respect to city life and    customs.                       _Test 1. Number right.......... x 2 = Score.........._   Adv.
