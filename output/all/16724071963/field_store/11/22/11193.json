Some of the more respectable leaders of Opposition, though, they supported the Queen, had no heart in the cause.  \"Lord ----\" (we learn from another authority), \"whom I always look upon as a most honest man, said it was rather hard upon him to have to present her petitions, but he could not refuse, being so intimate with Brougham. But they were brought to him at a minute's notice, and he knew nothing about, consequently could not support them. In the present instance, he thought she was taken in, in pressing for trial within four-and-twenty hours. She thought we would not take her at her word, and might bully, as she had done before; that she was a bold, dangerous, impudent woman, as full of revenge as careless of crime, and that if we did not take care, might play the part of Catherine the Second, who, by means of the Guards, murdered her husband and usurped the throne.\"[39]        [39] Phipps's \"Memoirs of Robert Plumer Ward,\" vol. ii. p. 56.  The nobleman whose opinions have here been preserved was most probably Lord Dacre, who, in his place in the House of Lords, presented more than one petition from the Queen. One also was presented by Lord Auckland. Another of the Queen's partisans in the other House appears to have entertained similar sentiments:--\"Walked with Sir ---- ----. He said he had no doubt that the Queen was guilty, but would never vote for the Bill, as unconstitutional; at the same time, ready to admit that Ministers had proved such a case as perfectly justified them in bringing it forward.\"[40]        [40] Phipps's \"Memoirs of Robert Plumer Ward,\" vol. ii. p. 58.  A description of the sort of satellites that followed the Queen's movements when she went abroad, or surrounded her dwelling while she remained at home, is preserved in the postscript of a letter from Mr. Wilberforce to Hannah More, repeating the observations of a friend who had ventured to approach the Queen's residence. He describes her retainers as \"a most shabby assemblage of quite the lowest of the people, about fifty in number, who every now and then kept calling out 'Queen, Queen!' and several times, once in about a quarter of an hour, she came out of one window of a balcony and Alderman Wood at the other, and she bowed to them; her obeisance, of course, being met by augmented acclamations. My friend,\" adds Mr. Wilberforce, \"entered into conversation with a person present who argued for the natural equality of man, and that any other of the people present had as good right to be King as George the Fourth.\"[41]        [41] \"Life,\" vol. v. p. 72.  The Duke of Wellington at this period took an anxious share in the proceedings against the Queen. \"We fell upon the general situation of things,\" relates a confidential friend of his Grace, \"which the Duke allowed was almost as bad as could be; nor could he see the remedy, if the upper and middle ranks would not stir. But all,\" he continued, with some sadness as well as indignation, \"seem struck with panic--ourselves and all; and if the country is lost, it will be through our own cowardice. Everything,\" said he--\"audacity and insolence on one side, and tameness on ours. We go to the House seemingly on purpose to be insulted; the Opposition know it, and act accordingly.\" I said, \"I feared it was particularly so in the House of Commons, where the Ministerial bench, with the exception of Lord Castlereagh, seemed like victims.\"[42]        [42] Phipps's \"Memoirs of Ward,\" vol. ii. p. 63.  The principal Ministers went in daily danger of their lives. Lord Sidmouth never drove out without a case of loaded pistols on the seat of the carriage, ready for instant use;[43] and when either of them was recognised in the public streets, he was sure to be greeted by groans and hisses, and sometimes with more formidable missiles.        [43] \"Life,\" by Dean Pellew, vol. iii. p. 330.  The attempt to induce the Queen to adopt a more rational course, is here referred to:--       SIR BENJAMIN BLOOMFIELD TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Carlton House, June 20, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD,      As yet there is no certain information of the precise course to be     taken by Mr. Wilberforce. I, however, collect that he has no     intention to weaken the position of the Government, nor the basis,     on the part of the King, upon which the late negotiation has broken     off. The object, therefore, is to maintain that basis which was     considered as the only safeguard to the preservation of all that's     dear to man. To attain this there seems, under the present state of     the public mind, no alternative but investigation, with as much     publicity as the House can be induced to give to the question.      I need not reiterate to your Lordship the sense which is     entertained of the affectionate attachment manifested by your     Lordship in this most painful transaction.      With great respect, I have the honour to be,      My dear Lord,      Your Lordship's obliged and obedient humble Servant,      B. BLOOMFIELD.   But Caroline of Brunswick would not have been Caroline of Brunswick had she suffered this well-meant intervention to influence her purpose. The sad business, therefore, proceeded in the saddest possible way:--       LORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      June 27, 1820.      All speculation is at fault in attempting to follow these daily     changes of plans and operations.      Certainly, it is far more convenient and more becoming to let this     matter be first investigated in the House of Lords. But how this is     to be reconciled to the present state of the business in the House     of Commons, it seems difficult to imagine; but by this time that     difficulty will have been solved in one way or another, and I need     not trouble myself about it.      As to popular impressions, the only way by which they can now be     counteracted, is by bringing the matter as soon as possible into     some regular form of proceeding.      What is to result from all this, it is impossible to conjecture;     but he must be sanguine indeed who can hope that it will turn to     good.       RIGHT HON. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Dropmore, June 28, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      When I came here I found an entire concurrence of opinion as to the     extreme folly of Ministers pressing on the Secret Committee in the     House of Lords, after they had pledged themselves in the House of     Commons to bring forward a charge upon their own responsibility; I     was therefore much gratified to see in your letter, just received,     that if there was a question upon that subject, you should vote     against the Secret Committee, though if the Committee were     appointed, you might in that case continue your name upon it. The     proceeding is become so odious and unpopular, that the general     prejudice against it is in itself great ground of objection to it;     and as the Ministers have already taken the charge upon their own     responsibility, it seems now likely to answer no other end than     that of furnishing to their adversaries a fund of clamour and of     invective, on a topic by which, while Ministers gain nothing, they     must lose much. But by this time the question must be already     decided, and therefore it is useless to pursue it If the Committee     is appointed, and if you do attend it, I am sure you will in that     case feel the absolute necessity of your declining any confidential     communication, either on foot or on horseback, with any person not     upon that Commission, in reference to the business of it. Even the     conversation of the table, and the ears of those who sit at it with     you, must on every account be most cautiously guarded upon this     peculiar topic. You must not start at these suggestions; you know     the affectionate motives that prompt them; and nothing but the     extreme importance of the nicest attention to them, under your     particular position, could have called for them both from Lord     G---- and me.      I would not unnecessarily prolong this letter, because you have     enough to think of; but I feel confident that the more you reflect     upon your own position, the more you must be confirmed in the     persuasion that while, on the one hand, you have thought it     necessary to withdraw from the Opposition, on the other hand, you     will most effectually be enabled to support the constitutional     principles of the Monarchy by maintaining an absolute independence,     and by taking care not to put yourself within the reach of the     imputation of favouritism, which, once established against you,     will render your means of real and effectual assistance useless, by     discrediting your station in the country, and by depriving it of     its best recommendation, its absolute independence.   It will be seen from the foregoing communication how extremely anxious were Lord Buckingham's uncles, at this crisis, that he should act with the utmost circumspection on every possible contingency.       THE MARQUIS WELLESLEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      MY DEAR LORD,      Many thanks for your note by Lord Cassilis; I do not credit any of     the rumours to which you refer. I believe that all is now quiet in     those quarters. I understand that the Secret Committee is to meet     in our House on Wednesday, and on its Report a Bill is to be     introduced; in the Commons, a delay of ten days is to be proposed,     for the purpose of waiting for our Bill. You have "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22553"],["title","Memoirs of the Court of George IV. 1820-1830 (Vol 1) (#7)"],["body","of the     proceedings in our House to-night: a petition from the Queen,     praying against a Secret Committee, and for a delay of any     proceedings, in order to enable her to collect her witnesses;     Brougham and Denman called in and heard in support of the petition,     and the House adjourned until to-morrow, when Lord Grey is to make     his motion for rescinding the order respecting the Secret     Committee. When this motion is disposed of, Lord Liverpool will     move that the Secret Committee shall meet on Wednesday. I cannot     ascertain the temper of the House positively, but I perceive no     alteration in it of any description.      Yours, my dear Lord, sincerely,      W.       LORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Dropmore, July 2, 1820.      I am glad you are so near the end of your labours, though that end     is to be the beginning of a fresh and very painful scene. I am     clear, however, that in the state to which the matter is now     brought, the course at last adopted was the only one which affords     any hope of concluding it without the most alarming consequences.     And if the House of Lords manifests, as I trust it will, a     temperate and truly judicial spirit in the conduct of the trial, I     am sanguine enough to believe that much lost ground may still be     recovered.      I am utterly at variance with Charles's notion, that such     proceedings ought to commence in the House of Commons; and I am     sure in this case it was of unspeakable importance that the matter     should first undergo a judicial investigation, before it was     brought any more under the cognizance of a body so liable to act on     momentary impressions, in place of the settled rules and permanent     principles of legal proceeding.       RIGHT HON. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Dropmore, July 5, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      I cannot help writing a line to say how well satisfied I am with     the result which this post has brought us, and how glad I am that     no secondary matter has been tacked on to that which is of primary     interest. We neither of us can as yet collect by what precise     course the matter is to be so charged as to give the proper notice     so as to enable the party concerned to provide a reply. I should,     of course, suppose that by this time the whole march of all the     proceedings is foreseen and determined upon, if there was not such     frequent occasion to remark that foresight and decision are much     more frequently to be desired than to be found.      I should suppose that the Bill must contain specific charges, or     that those charges must be communicated by a resolution of the     House. What is most to be apprehended is that dexterous advocates     may awaken new questions in so novel a proceeding, and may thereby     prolong the discussion to a most inconvenient and dangerous length,     by which this state of hazardous agitation of the public mind will     be continued, and a feeling of commiseration will be excited by the     length of the proceeding, although the prolongation of it will be     owing more to the accused than to the accusers. You see every hour     of every day that \"the mountain\" is dragging all that side of the     house into an avowed party-protection, to be afforded before trial;     that the answers to addresses are so many appeals made to the     \"soldiers and sailors;\" and that the hypocritical lamentations over     the ill-judged time of the Coronation, are indulged in for the     obvious purpose of exciting the tumults which they affect to     deprecate. All this is very disgusting, and not without real     danger. I suppose your Committee, being now dissolved by its     Report, you have nothing more to do in these odious abominations,     which the Vice-Chancellor will probably have to manage.       LORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Dropmore, July 5, 1820.      I see nothing _primá facie_ to object to in the Report, and I am     very glad that the _doubt_ was decided negatively.      I imagine, however, that there may still be some difficulty in the     course of the proceeding, if she requires, as I suppose she will be     advised to do, that the facts of both descriptions should be more     precisely specified as to time and place, before she is called upon     to answer them in any judicial form.       MR. W. H. FREMANTLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Stanhope Street, July 19, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD,      I am passing through town in my way to E. Green, and find it not     only greatly thinned, but those remaining in a much more melancholy     mood than when I left it. The language even of the Government is     most croaking, and you may be assured the Queen's party is far from     diminishing. The City is completely with her,--not the Common     Council, but the shopkeepers and merchants,--and I have great     doubts if the troops are not infected. The press is paid for her     abundantly, and there are some ale-houses open where the soldiers     may go and drink and eat for nothing, provided they will drink     \"Prosperity and health to the Queen.\" The K---- grows daily more     unpopular, and is the only individual in the kingdom insensible to     it. He sees Lady C---- daily, and had a party of his family at     dinner this week, she the only exception. You may think, perhaps,     this letter gloomy; but I assure you I write much less desponding     than the general language and feeling would authorize me.      The peerages are eight, and hourly expected:--Lord Conyngham,     Roden, Sir W. Scott, Forester, Cholmondeley, Liddel, W. Pole, Lord     James Murray.      I don't hear a word of the Dukedoms. The King reviews the Guards     on Friday, and then goes to the cottage at Windsor, to meet the     Conynghams. Boats are gone from Chatham and Staines for the     Virginia Lake, where he is to have water-parties. Probably or     possibly we shall participate in these. If so, you shall hear from     me.--It is said the Lords meet the 17th; begin immediately the     witnesses for the prosecutor: finish this in a fortnight; then the     Queen asks for two months (at least) before she commences her     defence, _if she makes any_. But there is a strong report she means     to make none in the Lords, but reserve herself for the Commons; if     so, it is no great compliment to us, who examine not on oath.     These, however, are only the rumours of the day.--Lushington got a     most handsome and proper dressing from Castlereagh, who, I am told,     did it remarkably well.      Ever truly yours,      W. H. F.       RIGHT HON. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Cleveland Square, July 22, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      Lord G---- wrote to me last night, and tells me that he must,     however reluctantly, attend on the 17th, the Chancellor being, as     it is said, determined to go all lengths to enforce attendance. He     is, in my mind, quite right in doing so. You will be much rejoiced     to hear that on the 20th Lord G---- received a letter from Lord     Liverpool, offering through him, in the K----'s name and in his,     and in the most flattering terms from both, the situation of Regius     Professor of Divinity at Oxford, with the Canonship of Christ     Church, to Dr. Hodgson, as a thing proper in itself, and also as     what was wished to be done on account of his connexion with Lord     G----.      Nothing could be more gratifying to Lord G----, who has always felt     mortified at observing that hitherto his connexion with Hodgson had     been rather prejudicial than serviceable to him.--I write this the     rather because my brother adds that the post being in the moment of     going, he has not time to write you word of it then.      St. Paul's is given to Llandaff. The dandy Pelham is gone sulkily     down to look at Bugden, and to see whether he will condescend to     take that after his disappointment, at which there seems to be a     very general feeling of satisfaction.      Vague reports of negotiation with the Queen through Lady     Cholmondeley; but I do not hear them from any sort of authority,     and therefore I know not how to believe them. I hope you observe     the _Morning Chronicle's_ congratulations on the Naples revolution     without loss of life, \"in consequence of its being achieved by the     _soldiery_, since wherever they raise their voice, it is     imperative.\" And this is the Whig and Opposition printer!!! The     K---- was prevented by gout from attending the cavalry review.       RIGHT HON. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.      Cleveland Square, July 26, 1820.      MY DEAR LORD B----,      The little that I hear is not worth sending you, either in quality     or in quantity. The rumours about the military increase daily and     frightfully. How much of these rumours is true, and how much is     invented, and how much is exaggerated, I have no means to judge;     but the prevalence of that topic of conversation, while it shews     the generality of the apprehension, is itself but too much     calculated to bring on the evil of which it treats. Tierney     yesterday told us he had heard Wood say the day before that the     Q---- had irrevocably determined to come down every day to the     trial in her \"coach-and-six _in a high style;_\" if so, she     will very likely be attended by all the idle populace between     Hammersmith and London, besides a host of radicals, who will not     let go by such an auspicious opportunity. How the peace of the     metropolis or the safety of the Parliament is to be secured under     all these circumstances, might puzzle wiser heads than those whose     business it will be to decide upon it. T---- admits himself to be     considerably alarmed, and describes the appearance of the Ministers     in these latter days as betraying more anxiety and"]]]
