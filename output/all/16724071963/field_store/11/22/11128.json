You, Bill, bring along his valise. I'll take ye home in the wagon, though it would be only right if I let ye walk.\"  \"Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, \"you have no right to touch me. You have no authority over me.\"  \"I ain't, hey? Well, we'll argy that matter when we get home.\"  And he commenced dragging Kit in the direction of the wagon.  It certainly seemed as if Kit's plans were destined, if not for defeat, to postponement. Unconditional surrender was his only choice against the superior strength of Aaron Bickford. It was certainly very vexatious.  But help was nearer than he anticipated.  They were now within sight of the circus tents, and Kit, to his joy, descried the giant, Achilles Henderson, taking a morning walk, and already within hearing distance.  \"Mr. Henderson!\" he called out, eagerly.  \"Who is that you're calling?\" asked the blacksmith sharply.  Achilles heard, and instantly recognized the boy who had talked with him at Smyrna.  It took but a few strides to bring him to the spot where Kit was held in captivity.  \"What does this mean?\" he asked.  \"This man is dragging me away without authority,\" answered Kit.  \"Who is he?\" asked the giant.  \"He is a blacksmith, and claims me as an apprentice, but I never agreed to work for him.\"  \"That's a lie,\" said the blacksmith, \"he's my runaway apprentice.\"  \"I would believe the boy sooner than you,\" said Achilles, not favorably impressed by the blacksmith's bull dog look.  \"It doesn't make any difference what you believe,\" said Bickford, rudely; and he began to pull Kit in the direction of the wagon.  \"Let go that boy's collar,\" cried Achilles, sternly.  \"I won't!\" retorted the blacksmith. \"I advise you to mind your own business.\"  Achilles Henderson, like most big men, was good natured, but he was roused by the other's insolence. He carried war into the enemy's camp by seizing the blacksmith and shaking him till he was compelled to release his grasp.  \"What do you mean by this outrage?\" demanded Bickford, furiously.  \"It's only a gentle hint,\" said Achilles, smiling. \"Now, my friend, I've got a piece of advice to give you. If that is your wagon back there you'd better get into it as soon as convenient--the sooner the better--and get out of my way or I'll give you a stronger hint.\"  The blacksmith was too indignant to be prudent. What! Confess himself vanquished, and go home without the boy! The idea was intolerable to him.  \"I'm goin' to take the boy,\" he said, angrily, and darting forward he essayed to seize Kit by the collar again.  \"Oho! You need a stronger hint,\" said Achilles. With this he grasped the blacksmith about the middle, and tossed him over the fence into the adjoining field as easily as if he were a cat.  Aaron Bickford did not know what had happened to him. He lay motionless for a few seconds, and then picked himself up with some difficulty, and confronted the giant with mingled fear and anger.  \"I'll have the law of ye for this,\" he shouted.  Achilles laughed.  \"It's as you like,\" he said. \"I've got my witnesses here,\" pointing to the two boys.  Mr. Bickford got over the fence, and sullenly turned in the direction of his deserted wagon.  \"You'll hear from me again, all of you!\" he shouted, shaking his fist.  \"Don't trouble yourself to write,\" said the giant, jocosely. \"We can worry along without a letter.\"  The blacksmith was too full of wrath for utterance. He kept on his way, muttering to himself, and shaking his fist at intervals.  \"Now what's all this about?\" asked Achilles. \"What's the matter with our amiable friend?\"  Kit explained.  \"So you don't want to be a blacksmith? Where are you going, if I may inquire?\"  \"I'm going to join the circus,\" answered Kit.  \"In what capacity--as a lion tamer?\"  \"No; I shouldn't fancy that business. I am to be an acrobat.\"  \"An acrobat! But are you qualified?\" asked Achilles, somewhat surprised.  He had not heard of Kit's practice with the Vincenti brothers on the day of his first visit to the circus.  \"I am pretty well qualified already,\" answered Kit, \"I saw Mr. Barlow yesterday morning, and he promised me an engagement at ten dollars a week.\"  \"Good!\" said Achilles, heartily. \"I am pleased to hear it. I took a liking to you the other day, and I'm glad you're going to join us. But do you think it wise to choose such a life?\"  \"You have chosen it,\" said Kit.  \"Yes; but what could I do--a man of my size? I must earn more than a common man. My board and clothes both cost more. What do you think I paid for this suit I have on?\"  \"I couldn't tell, sir.\"  \"Sixty dollars. The tailor only charges thirty dollars to a man of ordinary size, but I am so absurdly large that I have to pay double price.\"  \"Why don't you buy your suits ready made?\" asked Kit, smiling.  Achilles laughed heartily at the idea.  \"Show me a place where I can get ready made clothes to fit me,\" he answered, \"and I will gladly accept your suggestion.\"  \"That may be a little difficult, I admit.\"  \"Why, you have no idea how inconvenient I find it to be so large. I can't find a bed to suit me in any hotel. If I go to the theater I can't crowd myself into an ordinary seat. I have to have all kinds of clothing, inside and outside, made to order. My hats and shoes must also be made expressly for me.\"  \"I suppose you get very well paid,\" suggested Kit.  \"Seventy-five dollars a week sounds pretty large, and would be if my expenses were not so great. You wouldn't be a giant for that money, would you?\"  \"I am not so ambitious,\" replied Kit, smiling. \"But there was a moment when I wished myself of your size.\"  \"When was that?\"  \"When the blacksmith grasped me by the collar.\"  \"You don't have to work very hard,\" said William Morris.  \"My boy, it is pretty hard work to be stared at by a crowd of people. I get tired of it often, but I see no other way of making a living.\"  \"You would make a pretty good blacksmith.\"  \"I couldn't earn more than a man of average strength, and that wouldn't be enough, as I have explained.\"  \"Were your parents very tall?\" asked Kit.  \"My father was six feet in height, but my mother was a small woman. I don't know what put it into me to grow so big. But here we are at the lot. Will you come in?\"  \"When can I see Mr. Barlow?\" asked Kit, anxiously.  \"He is at the hotel. He won't be round till half-past nine. Have you two boys had breakfast?\"  \"No,\" answered Kit; \"I'm nearly famished.\"  \"Come round to the circus tent. You are to be one of us, and will board there. I guess we can provide for your friend, too.\"  Never was invitation more gladly accepted. Both Kit and William felt as if they had not broken their fast for a week.     CHAPTER XIII.  BREAKFAST IN THE CIRCUS TENT.   Achilles entered the circus inclosure--the \"lot,\" as it is generally called,--and made his way to a small tent situated not far from the one devoted to the performances. An attendant was carrying in a plate of hot steak and potatoes from the cook tent near by.  \"Is breakfast ready?\" asked Achilles.  \"Yes; any time you want it.\"  \"Is anybody inside?\"  \"Only Mademoiselle Louise.\"  \"Well, I want three breakfasts--for myself and my two young friends here.\"  \"I didn't know you had sons,\" said Mike, the attendant, regarding Kit and William with some curiosity.  \"I haven't. One of these young men is an acrobat, who will be one of us. The other is his friend. Bring along the grub as quick as possible--we are all hungry.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  Running the length of the tent, which was about twenty feet by ten, was a long table surrounded by benches.  The giant took his seat and placed the boys one on each side of him. Just opposite sat a woman of twenty-five or thereabouts, who was already eating breakfast.  \"Good morning, Mlle. Louise,\" said the giant.  \"Good morning, Mr. Henderson,\" responded the lady. \"Who are your young companions?\"  \"I don't know their names, but this one,\" placing his hand on Kit's shoulder, \"has been engaged by Mr. Barlow as an acrobat.\"  \"Indeed! He looks young.\"  \"I am sixteen,\" volunteered Kit.  \"What circus have you traveled with before this season?\" asked Mlle. Louise.  \"I have never traveled with any, madam.\"  \"But you are an acrobat?\"  \"I have had my practice in a gymnasium.\"  \"How came Mr. Barlow to engage you?\"  \"At Smyrna I practiced a little with the Vincenti brothers.\"  \"At Smyrna? Why, that's where the lion dashed into the arena!\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do you know the boy who had the courage to face him?\"  Kit blushed.  \"I am the boy,\" he said.  \"You don't mean it!\" exclaimed the lady, vivaciously. \"Why, you're a hero. I must shake hands with you,\" and she reached across the table and gave Kit a hearty grasp of the hand.  \"Is that so?\" interposed Achilles. \"Why, I didn't know you were the boy. I was not present at the time, and only heard of it afterwards. Mlle. Louise is right. You are a brave fellow.\"  \"I am much obliged to you both for your favorable opinion,\" said Kit modestly, \"but I didn't realize my danger till afterwards.\"  \"Oh, heavens! I can see him now--that wicked beast!\" exclaimed the lady. \"I was nearly scared out of my senses. As for poor Dupont, he was nearer death than I ever want to be till my time comes.\"  \"Was Dupont the clown?\" asked Kit.  \"Yes. The lion held him down, with his foot upon the poor clown's back, and but for your brave act he would have torn the poor fellow to pieces. Mr. Henderson, you missed the most thrilling act of the evening.\"  \"So I begin to think. By the way, boys, I ought to have introduced this lady. She is the famous aerial artist, whom you saw the other evening in her wonderful feats upon the trapeze.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mlle. Louise, complacently, \"I think I have a pretty good act. I get plenty of applause, eh, Mr."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],["title","Artists' Wives (#0)"],["body","ARTISTS' WIVES  By Alphonse Daudet  Translated by Laura Ensor  Illustrated by De Bieler, Myrbach; And Rossi  [Illustration: Frontispiece]  [Illustration: Titlepage]  [Illustration: p007-018]     PROLOGUE.  _Stretched at full length, on the great divan of a studio, cigar in mouth, two friends--a poet and a painter--were talking together one evening after dinner_.  _It was the hour of confidences and effusion. The lamp burned softly beneath its shade, limiting its circle of light to the intimacy of the conversation, leaving scarcely distinct the capricious luxury of the vast walls, cumbered with canvases, hangings, panoplies, surmounted by a glass roof through which the sombre blue shades of the night penetrated unhindered. The portrait of a woman, leaning slightly forward, as if to listen, alone stood out a little from the shadow; young with intelligent eyes, a grave and sweet mouth and a spirituel smile which seemed to defend the husband's easel from fools and disparagers. A low chair pushed away from the fire, two little blue shoes lying on the carpet, indicated also the presence of a child in the house; and indeed from the next room, within which mother and child had but just disappeared, came occasional bursts of soft laughter, of childish babble; the pretty flutterings of a nest going off to sleep. All this shed over the artistic interior a vague perfume of family happiness which the poet breathed in with delight:_  \"_Decidedly, my dear fellow?\" he said to his friend, \"you were in the right. There are no two ways of being happy. Happiness lies in this and in nothing else. You must find me a wife!_\"   THE PAINTER.  _Good Heavens, no! not on any account. Find one for yourself, if you are bent upon it. As for me, I will have nothing to do with it._   THE POET.  _And why?_   THE PAINTER.  _Because--because artists ought never to marry._   THE POET.  _That's rather too good. You dare to say that, and the lamp does not go out suddenly, and the walls don't fall down upon your head! But just think, wretch, that for two hours past, you have been setting before me the enviable spectacle of the very happiness you forbid me. Are you by chance like those odious millionaires whose well-being is in-creased by the sufferings of others, and who better enjoy their own fireside when they reflect that it is raining out of doors, and that there are plenty of poor devils without a shelter?_   THE PAINTER.  _Think of me what you will. I have too much affection for you to help you to commit a folly--an irreparable folly._   THE POET.  _Come! what is it? You are not satisfied? And yet it seems to me that one breathes in happiness here, just as freely as one does the air of heaven at a country window._   THE PAINTER.  _You are right, I am happy, completely happy, I love my wife with all my heart. When I think of my child, I laugh aloud to myself with pleasure. Marriage for me has been a harbour of calm and safe waters, not one in which you make fast to a ring on the shore, at the risk of rusting there for ever, but one of those blue creeks where sails and masts are repaired for fresh excursions into unknown countries, I never worked as well as I have since my marriage. All my best pictures date from then._   THE POET.  _Well then!_   THE PAINTER.  _My dear fellow, at the risk of seeming a coxcomb, I will say that I look upon my happiness as a kind of miracle, something abnormal and exceptional. Yes! the more I see what marriage is, the more I look back with terror at the risk I ran. I am like those who, ignorant of the dangers they have unwittingly gone through, turn pale when all is over, amazed at their own audacity._   THE POET.  _But what then are these terrible dangers?_   THE PAINTER.  _The first and greatest of all, is the loss or degradation of one's talent. This should count, I think, with an artist. For observe that at this moment, I am not speaking of the ordinary conditions of life. I grant you, that in general marriage is an excellent thing, and that the majority of men only begin to be of some account when the family circle completes them or makes them greater. Often, indeed, it is necessary to a profession. A bachelor lawyer cannot even be imagined. He would not have the needful air of weight and gravity. But for all of us, painters, poets, sculptors, musicians, who live outside of life, wholly occupied in studying it, in reproducing it, holding ourselves always a little remote from it, as one steps back from a picture the better to see it, I say that marriage can only be the exception. To that nervous, exacting, impressionable being, that child-man that we call an artist, a special type of woman, almost impossible to find, is needful, and the safest thing to do is not to look for her. Ah! how well our great Delacroix, whom you admire so much, understood that! What a fine existence was his, bounded by his studio wall, devoted exclusively to Art! I was looking the other day at his cottage at Champrosay and the prim little garden full of roses, where he sauntered alone for twenty years! It has the calm and the narrowness of celibacy. Well now! think for a moment of Delacroix married, father of a family, with all the preoccupations of children to bring up, of money matters, of illnesses; do you believe his work would have been the same?_   THE POET.  _You cite Delacroix, I reply Victor Hugo. Do you think that marriage hampered him for instance, while writing so many admirable books?_   THE PAINTER.  _I think as a matter of fact, that marriage did not hamper him in anything. But all husbands have not the genius that obtains pardon, nor a halo of glory with which to dry the tears they cause to flow. It cannot be very amusing to be the wife of a genius. There are plenty of labourers' wives who are happier._   THE POET.  _A curious thing, all the same, this special pleading against marriage, by a married man, who is happy in being so._   THE PAINTER.  _I repeat that I don't give myself as an example. My opinion is formed by all the sad things I have seen elsewhere; all the misunderstandings so frequent in the households of artists, and caused solely by their abnormal life. Look at that sculptor who, in full maturity of age and talent, has just exiled himself, leaving wife and children behind him. Public opinion condemns him, and certainly I offer no excuse for him. And, nevertheless, I can well understand how he arrived at such a point! Here was a fellow who adored his art, and had a horror of the world, and society. The wife, though amiable and intelligent, instead of shielding him from the social obligations he loathed, condemned him for some ten years to all the exactions they involved. Thus she induced him to undertake a lot of official busts, horrible respectabilities in velvet skull caps, frights of women utterly devoid of grace; she disturbed him ten times a day with importunate visitors, and then every evening laid out for him a dress suit and light gloves, and dragged him from drawing-room to drawing-room. You will tell me he could have rebelled, could have replied point-blank: \"No!\" But don't you know that the very fact of our sedentary existences leaves us more than other men dependent on domestic influence? The atmosphere of the home envelopes us, and if some touch of the ideal does not lighten it, soon wearies and drags us down. Moreover, the artist as a rule puts what force and energy he has into his work, and after his solitary and patient struggles, finds himself left with no will to oppose to the petty importunities of life. With him, feminine tyrannies have free play. No one is more easily conquered and subdued. Only, beware! He must not be made to feel the yoke too heavily. If one day the invisible bonds with which he is surreptitiously fettered are drawn too tight and arrest the artistic effort, he will all at once tear them asunder, and, mistrusting his own weakness, will fly like our sculptor, over the hills and far away._  _The wife of this sculptor was astounded at his flight. The unhappy creature is still wondering: \"What can I have done to him?\" Nothing. She simply did not understand him. For it is not enough to be good and intelligent to be the true helpmate of an artist, A woman must also possess infinite tact, smiling abnegation; and all this is found only by a miracle in a young creature, curious though ignorant as regards life. She is pretty, she has married a well-known man, received everywhere; why should she not wish to show herself a little on his arm? Is it not quite natural? The husband, on the contrary, growing intolerant of society as his talent progresses, finding time short, and art engrossing, refuses to be exhibited. Behold them both miserable, and whether the man gives in or resists, his life is henceforward turned from its course, and from its tranquillity. Ah! how many of these ill-matched couples have I known, where the wife was sometimes executioner, sometimes victim, but more often executioner, and nearly always unwittingly so! The other evening I was at Dargenty's, the musician. There were but a few guests, and he was asked to play. Hardly had he begun one off those pretty mazurkas with a Polish rhythm, which make him the successor of Chopin, when his wife began to talk, quite low at first, then a little louder. By degrees the fire of conversation spread. At the end of a minute I was the only listener. Then he shut the piano, and said to me with a heart-rent smile: \"It is always like this here--my wife does not care for music.\" Can you imagine anything more terrible than to marry a woman who does not care for your art? Take my word for it, my friend, and don't marry. You are alone, you are free; keep as precious things, your liberty and your loneliness._   THE POET.  _That is all very well! You talk at your ease of solitude. Presently, when I am gone, if some idea occurs to you, you will gently follow it by the side of your dying embers, without feeling around you that"]]]
