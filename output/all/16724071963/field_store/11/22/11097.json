I am bound to take you home again, if you do.”  “There!” cried Diamond, who was still looking after the little girl. “I'm sure the wind will blow her over, and perhaps kill her. Do let me go.”  They had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street. There was a lull in the roaring.  “Well, though I cannot promise to take you home,” said North Wind, as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses, “I can promise you it will be all right in the end. You will get home somehow. Have you made up your mind what to do?”  “Yes; to help the little girl,” said Diamond firmly.  The same moment North Wind dropt into the street and stood, only a tall lady, but with her hair flying up over the housetops. She put her hands to her back, took Diamond, and set him down in the street. The same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast, and all but blown away. North Wind stepped back a step, and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses. A chimney-pot clashed at Diamond's feet. He turned in terror, but it was to look for the little girl, and when he turned again the lady had vanished, and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent. The little girl was scudding before the blast, her hair flying too, and behind her she dragged her broom. Her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling. Diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway, thinking to stop her; but she passed him like a bird, crying gently and pitifully.  “Stop! stop! little girl,” shouted Diamond, starting in pursuit.  “I can't,” wailed the girl, “the wind won't leave go of me.”  Diamond could run faster than she, and he had no broom. In a few moments he had caught her by the frock, but it tore in his hand, and away went the little girl. So he had to run again, and this time he ran so fast that he got before her, and turning round caught her in his arms, when down they went both together, which made the little girl laugh in the midst of her crying.  “Where are you going?” asked Diamond, rubbing the elbow that had stuck farthest out. The arm it belonged to was twined round a lamp-post as he stood between the little girl and the wind.  “Home,” she said, gasping for breath.  “Then I will go with you,” said Diamond.  And then they were silent for a while, for the wind blew worse than ever, and they had both to hold on to the lamp-post.  “Where is your crossing?” asked the girl at length.  “I don't sweep,” answered Diamond.  “What do you do, then?” asked she. “You ain't big enough for most things.”  “I don't know what I do do,” answered he, feeling rather ashamed. “Nothing, I suppose. My father's Mr. Coleman's coachman.”  “Have you a father?” she said, staring at him as if a boy with a father was a natural curiosity.  “Yes. Haven't you?” returned Diamond.  “No; nor mother neither. Old Sal's all I've got.” And she began to cry again.  “I wouldn't go to her if she wasn't good to me,” said Diamond.  “But you must go somewheres.”  “Move on,” said the voice of a policeman behind them.  “I told you so,” said the girl. “You must go somewheres. They're always at it.”  “But old Sal doesn't beat you, does she?”  “I wish she would.”  “What do you mean?” asked Diamond, quite bewildered.  “She would if she was my mother. But she wouldn't lie abed a-cuddlin' of her ugly old bones, and laugh to hear me crying at the door.”  “You don't mean she won't let you in to-night?”  “It'll be a good chance if she does.”  “Why are you out so late, then?” asked Diamond.  “My crossing's a long way off at the West End, and I had been indulgin' in door-steps and mewses.”  “We'd better have a try anyhow,” said Diamond. “Come along.”  As he spoke Diamond thought he caught a glimpse of North Wind turning a corner in front of them; and when they turned the corner too, they found it quiet there, but he saw nothing of the lady.  “Now you lead me,” he said, taking her hand, “and I'll take care of you.”  The girl withdrew her hand, but only to dry her eyes with her frock, for the other had enough to do with her broom. She put it in his again, and led him, turning after turning, until they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane. There she knocked.  “I shouldn't like to live here,” said Diamond.  “Oh, yes, you would, if you had nowhere else to go to,” answered the girl. “I only wish we may get in.”  “I don't want to go in,” said Diamond.  “Where do you mean to go, then?”  “Home to my home.”  “Where's that?”  “I don't exactly know.”  “Then you're worse off than I am.”  “Oh no, for North Wind--” began Diamond, and stopped, he hardly knew why.  “What?” said the girl, as she held her ear to the door listening.  But Diamond did not reply. Neither did old Sal.  “I told you so,” said the girl. “She is wide awake hearkening. But we don't get in.”  “What will you do, then?” asked Diamond.  “Move on,” she answered.  “Where?”  “Oh, anywheres. Bless you, I'm used to it.”  “Hadn't you better come home with me, then?”  “That's a good joke, when you don't know where it is. Come on.”  “But where?”  “Oh, nowheres in particular. Come on.”  Diamond obeyed. The wind had now fallen considerably. They wandered on and on, turning in this direction and that, without any reason for one way more than another, until they had got out of the thick of the houses into a waste kind of place. By this time they were both very tired. Diamond felt a good deal inclined to cry, and thought he had been very silly to get down from the back of North Wind; not that he would have minded it if he had done the girl any good; but he thought he had been of no use to her. He was mistaken there, for she was far happier for having Diamond with her than if she had been wandering about alone. She did not seem so tired as he was.  “Do let us rest a bit,” said Diamond.  “Let's see,” she answered. “There's something like a railway there. Perhaps there's an open arch.”  They went towards it and found one, and, better still, there was an empty barrel lying under the arch.  “Hallo! here we are!” said the girl. “A barrel's the jolliest bed going--on the tramp, I mean. We'll have forty winks, and then go on again.”  She crept in, and Diamond crept in beside her. They put their arms round each other, and when he began to grow warm, Diamond's courage began to come back.  “This is jolly!” he said. “I'm so glad!”  “I don't think so much of it,” said the girl. “I'm used to it, I suppose. But I can't think how a kid like you comes to be out all alone this time o' night.”  She called him a kid, but she was not really a month older than he was; only she had had to work for her bread, and that so soon makes people older.  “But I shouldn't have been out so late if I hadn't got down to help you,” said Diamond. “North Wind is gone home long ago.”  “I think you must ha' got out o' one o' them Hidget Asylms,” said the girl. “You said something about the north wind afore that I couldn't get the rights of.”  So now, for the sake of his character, Diamond had to tell her the whole story.  She did not believe a word of it. She said he wasn't such a flat as to believe all that bosh. But as she spoke there came a great blast of wind through the arch, and set the barrel rolling. So they made haste to get out of it, for they had no notion of being rolled over and over as if they had been packed tight and wouldn't hurt, like a barrel of herrings.  “I thought we should have had a sleep,” said Diamond; “but I can't say I'm very sleepy after all. Come, let's go on again.”  They wandered on and on, sometimes sitting on a door-step, but always turning into lanes or fields when they had a chance.  They found themselves at last on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side. It was a waste kind of spot below, bounded by an irregular wall, with a few doors in it. Outside lay broken things in general, from garden rollers to flower-pots and wine-bottles. But the moment they reached the brow of the rising ground, a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run. Nor could Diamond stop before he went bang against one of the doors in the wall. To his dismay it burst open. When they came to themselves they peeped in. It was the back door of a garden.  “Ah, ah!” cried Diamond, after staring for a few moments, “I thought so! North Wind takes nobody in! Here I am in master's garden! I tell you what, little girl, you just bore a hole in old Sal's wall, and put your mouth to it, and say, 'Please, North Wind, mayn't I go out with you?' and then you'll see what'll come.”  “I daresay I shall. But I'm out in the wind too often already to want more of it.”  “I said with the North Wind, not in it.”  “It's all one.”  “It's not all one.”  “It is all one.”  “But I know best.”  “And I know better. I'll box your ears,” said the girl.  Diamond got very angry. But he remembered that even if she did box his ears, he musn't box hers again, for she was a girl, and all that boys must do, if girls are rude, is to go away and leave them. So he went in at the door.  “Good-bye, mister” said the girl.  This brought Diamond to his senses.  “I'm sorry I was cross,” he said. “Come in, and my mother will give you some breakfast.”  “No, thank you. I must be off to my crossing. It's morning now.”  “I'm very sorry for you,” said Diamond.  “Well, it is a life to be tired of--what with old Sal, and so many holes in my shoes.”  “I wonder you're so good. I should kill myself.”  “Oh, no, you wouldn't! When I think of it, I always want to see what's coming next, and so I always wait till next is over. Well! I suppose there's somebody happy somewheres. But it ain't in them carriages. Oh my! how they do look sometimes--fit to bite your head off! Good-bye!”  She ran up the hill and disappeared behind it. Then Diamond shut the door as he best could, and ran through the kitchen-garden to the stable.

THE SUMMER-HOUSE   DIAMOND said nothing to his mother about his adventures. He had half a notion that North Wind was a friend of his mother, and that, if she did not know all about it, at least she did not mind his going anywhere with the lady of the wind. At the same time he doubted whether he might not appear to be telling stories if he told all, especially as he could hardly believe it himself when he thought about it in the middle of the day, although when the twilight was once half-way on to night he had no doubt about it, at least for the first few days after he had been with her. The girl that swept the crossing had certainly refused to believe him. Besides, he felt sure that North Wind would tell him if he ought to speak.  It was some time before he saw the lady of the wind again. Indeed nothing remarkable took place in Diamond's history until the following week. This was what happened then. Diamond the horse wanted new shoes, and Diamond's father took him out of the stable, and was just getting on his back to ride him to the forge, when he saw his little boy standing by the pump, and looking at him wistfully. Then the coachman took his foot out of the stirrup, left his hold of the mane and bridle, came across to his boy, lifted him up, and setting him on the horse's back, told him to sit up like a man. He then led away both Diamonds together.  The boy atop felt not a little tremulous as the great muscles that lifted the legs of the horse knotted and relaxed against his legs, and he cowered towards the withers, grasping with his hands the bit of mane worn short by the collar; but when his father looked back at him, saying once more, “Sit up, Diamond,” he let the mane go and sat up, notwithstanding that the horse, thinking, I suppose, that his master had said to him, “Come up, Diamond,” stepped out faster. For both the Diamonds were just grandly obedient. And Diamond soon found that, as he was obedient to his father, so the horse was obedient to him. For he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle, and when his father, whose hand was upon it, felt the boy pull it towards him, he looked up and smiled, and, well pleased, let go his hold, and left Diamond to guide Diamond; and the boy soon found that he could do so perfectly. It was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that. And another discovery he made was that, in order to guide the horse, he had in a measure to obey the horse first. If he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse's body, he could not guide him; he must fall off.  The blacksmith lived at some distance, deeper into London. As they crossed the angle of a square, Diamond, who was now quite comfortable on his living throne, was glancing this way and that in a gentle pride, when he saw a girl sweeping a crossing scuddingly before a lady. The lady was his father's mistress, Mrs. Coleman, and the little girl was she for whose sake he had got off North Wind's back. He drew Diamond's bridle in eager anxiety to see whether her outstretched hand would gather a penny from Mrs. Coleman. But she had given one at the last crossing, and the hand returned only to grasp its broom. Diamond could not bear it. He had a penny in his pocket, a gift of the same lady the day before, and he tumbled off his horse to give it to the girl. He tumbled off, I say, for he did tumble when he reached the ground. But he got up in an instant, and ran, searching his pocket as he ran. She made him a pretty courtesy when he offered his treasure, but with a bewildered stare. She thought first: “Then he was on the back of the North Wind after all!” but, looking up at the sound of the horse's feet on the paved crossing, she changed her idea, saying to herself, “North Wind is his father's horse! That's the secret of it! Why couldn't he say so?” And she had a mind to refuse the penny. But his smile put it all right, and she not only took his penny but put it in her mouth with a “Thank you, mister. Did they wollop you then?”  “Oh no!” answered Diamond. “They never wollops me.”  “Lor!” said the little girl, and was speechless.  Meantime his father, looking up, and seeing the horse's back bare, suffered a pang of awful dread, but the next moment catching sight of him, took him up and put him on, saying--  “Don't get off again, Diamond. The horse might have put his foot on you.”  “No, father,” answered the boy, and rode on in majestic safety.  The summer drew near, warm and splendid. Miss Coleman was a little better in health, and sat a good deal in the garden. One day she saw Diamond peeping through the shrubbery, and called him. He talked to her so frankly that she often sent for him after that, and by degrees it came about that he had leave to run in the garden as he pleased. He never touched any of the flowers or blossoms, for he was not like some boys who cannot enjoy a thing without pulling it to pieces, and so preventing every one from enjoying it after them.  A week even makes such a long time in a child's life, that Diamond had begun once more to feel as if North Wind were a dream of some far-off year.  One hot evening, he had been sitting with the young mistress, as they called her, in a little summer-house at the bottom of the lawn--a wonderful thing for beauty, the boy thought, for a little window in the side of it was made of coloured glass. It grew dusky, and the lady began to feel chill, and went in, leaving the boy in the summer-house. He sat there gazing out at a bed of tulips, which, although they had closed for the night, could not go quite asleep for the wind that kept waving them about. All at once he saw a great bumble-bee fly out of one of the tulips.  “There! that is something done,” said a voice--a gentle, merry, childish voice, but so tiny. “At last it was. I thought he would have had to stay there all night, poor fellow! I did.”  Diamond could not tell whether the voice was near or far away, it was so small and yet so clear. He had never seen a fairy, but he had heard of such, and he began to look all about for one. And there was the tiniest creature sliding down the stem of the tulip!  “Are you the fairy that herds the bees?” he asked, going out of the summer-house, and down on his knees on the green shore of the tulip-bed.  “I'm not a fairy,” answered the little creature.  “How do you know that?”  “It would become you better to ask how you are to know it.”  “You've just told me.”  “Yes. But what's the use of knowing a thing only because you're told it?”  “Well, how am I to know you are not a fairy? You do look very like one.”  “In the first place, fairies are much bigger than you see me.”  “Oh!” said Diamond reflectively; “I thought they were very little.”  “But they might be tremendously bigger than I am, and yet not very big. Why, I could be six times the size I am, and not be very huge. Besides, a fairy can't grow big and little at will, though the nursery-tales do say so: they don't know better. You stupid Diamond! have you never seen me before?”  And, as she spoke, a moan of wind bent the tulips almost to the ground, and the creature laid her hand on Diamond's shoulder. In a moment he knew that it was North Wind.  “I am very stupid,” he said; “but I never saw you so small before, not even when you were nursing the primrose.”  “Must you see me every size that can be measured before you know me, Diamond?”  “But how could I think it was you taking care of a great stupid bumble-bee?”  “The more stupid he was the more need he had to be taken care of. What with sucking honey and trying to open the door, he was nearly dated; and when it opened in the morning to let the sun see the tulip's heart, what would the sun have thought to find such a stupid thing lying there--with wings too?”  “But how do you have time to look after bees?”  “I don't look after bees. I had this one to look after. It was hard work, though.”  “Hard work! Why, you could blow a chimney down, or--or a boy's cap off,”  said Diamond.  “Both are easier than to blow a tulip open. But I scarcely know the difference between hard and easy. I am always able for what I have to do. When I see my work, I just rush at it--and it is done. But I mustn't chatter. I have got to sink a ship to-night.”  “Sink a ship! What! with men in it?”  “Yes, and women too.”  “How dreadful! I wish you wouldn't talk so.”  “It is rather dreadful. But it is my work. I must do it.”  “I hope you won't ask me to go with you.”  “No, I won't ask you. But you must come for all that.”  “I won't then.”  “Won't you?” And North Wind grew a tall lady, and looked him in the eyes, and Diamond said--  “Please take me. You cannot be cruel.”  “No; I could not be cruel if I would. I can do nothing cruel, although I often do what looks like cruel to those who do not know what I really am doing. The people they say I drown, I only carry away to--to--to--well, the back of the North Wind--that is what they used to call it long ago, only I never saw the place.”  “How can you carry them there if you never saw it?”  “I know the way.”  “But how is it you never saw it?”  “Because it is behind me.”  “But you can look round.”  “Not far enough to see my own back. No; I always look before me. In fact, I grow quite blind and deaf when I try to see my back. I only mind my work.”  “But how does it be your work?”  “Ah, that I can't tell you. I only know it is, because when I do it I feel all right, and when I don't I feel all wrong. East Wind says--only one does not exactly know how much to believe of what she says, for she is very naughty sometimes--she says it is all managed by a baby; but whether she is good or naughty when she says that, I don't know. I just stick to my work. It is all one to me to let a bee out of a tulip, or to sweep the cobwebs from the sky. You would like to go with me to-night?”  “I don't want to see a ship sunk.”  “But suppose I had to take you?”  “Why, then,"]]]
