And, even though I cannot go farther east, trade here in Tanagor is quite profitable.\" He paused, smiling, as he sipped his drink.  \"I think the priests like having a few penitents around to explain things to newcomers, and to furnish examples of the power of Kondaro.\"  Musa smiled in response. \"But my ten caldor make me and my goods acceptable?\"  Tonda looked around quickly, then turned a horrified face toward his protégé.  \"Never say such things,\" he cautioned in a low tone of voice. \"Don't even think them. Your piety makes you acceptable, so long as you continue in a way pleasing to the great Kondaro. The money means nothing. It is only the spirit of sacrifice that counts.\"  \"I see.\" Musa's face was solemn. \"And how else may I be sure I will remain acceptable?\"  Tonda nodded approvingly. \"I thought you were a man of good sense and prudence.\" He launched into a description of the technicalities of the worship of Kondaro, the god of the Eastern Sea.  At length, Musa left his tutor, and repaired to an inn, where he secured lodging for the night.         *       *       *       *       *  The following morning, in obedience to the advice given him by Tonda, Musa took his way toward the Temple of the Sea. As he threaded through the crowds already gathering in the streets, he took note of the types of merchandise displayed in the booths, and hawked by the street peddlers. Suddenly, one of these roving sellers approached him. In his hands he held a number of ornaments.  \"Good day to you, oh Traveler,\" he cried. \"Surely, it is a fortunate morning for both of us.\" With a deft gesture, he threw one of the trinkets, a cunningly contrived amulet, about Musa's neck.  Musa would have brushed the man aside, but the chain of the amulet had tangled about his neck and he was forced to pause while removing it.  \"I told myself when I saw you,\" the man continued, \"ah, Banasel, here is one who should be favored by the gods. Now, how can such a one venture upon the Eastern Sea without a sacred amulet?\"  Musa had slipped the chain over his head. He paused, holding the ornament in his hand. \"How, then, are you to know where I am going?\"  \"Oh, Illustrious Traveler,\" exclaimed the man, \"how can I fail to know these things when it is given to me to vend these amulets of great fortune?\"  In spite of himself, Musa was curious. He looked at the amulet. There was no question as to the superb workmanship, and his trading instincts took over.  \"Why, this is a fair piece of work,\" he said. \"Possibly I could spare a caldor or so.\"  The man before him struck his forehead.  \"A caldor, he says! Why, the gold alone is worth ten.\"  Musa looked more closely at the ornament. The man was probably not exaggerating too much. Actually, he knew he could get an easy twenty-five balata for the bauble in Karth. A rapid calculation told him that here was a possible profit from the skies.  \"Why, possibly it is worth five, at that,\" he said. \"Look, I'll be generous. Shall we say six?\"  \"Oh, prince of givers! Thou paragon of generosity! After all, I, too, must live.\" The man smiled wryly. \"However, you are a fine, upstanding young man, and one must make allowance. I had thought to ask twenty, but we'll make it ten. Just the price of the gold.\"  Musa smiled inwardly. The profit was secured, but maybe--  \"Let's make it eight, and I'll give you my blessing with the money.\"  The man held out his hand. \"Nine.\"  Musa shrugged. \"Very well, most expert of vendors.\" He reached into his purse.         *       *       *       *       *  Banasel hesitated before accepting the money. He looked Musa over carefully, then nodded as if satisfied.  \"Yes,\" he said softly, \"I was right.\" He paused, then addressed himself directly to Musa.  \"We must be very careful to whom we sell these enchanted amulets,\" he explained, \"for they are talismans of the greatest of powers. The wearer of one of these need never fear the unjust wrath of man, beast, or demon, for he has powerful protectors at his call. Only wear this charm. Never let it out of your possession, and you will have nothing to fear during your voyage. Truly, you will be most favored.\"  He looked sharply at Musa again, took the money, glanced at it, and dropped it into a pouch.  \"Do you really believe in the powers of your ornaments, then?\" Musa asked skeptically.  Banasel's eyes widened, and he spread his arms. \"To be sure,\" he said in a devout tone. \"How can I believe else, when I have seen their miraculous workings so often?\" He held up a hand. \"Why, I could spend hours telling you of the powers these little ornaments possess, and of the miracles they have been responsible for. None have ever come to harm while wearing one of these enchanted talismans. None!\" He spread his arms again.  Musa looked at him curiously. \"I should like to hear your stories some day,\" he said politely.  He felt uncomfortable, as many people do when confronted by a confessed fanatic. His feelings were divided between surprise, a mild contempt, and an unease, born of wonder and uncertainty.  Obviously, the man was not especially favored. He was dressed like any street peddler. He had the slightly furtive, slightly brazen air of those who must avoid the anger, and sometimes the notice, of more powerful people, and yet, who must ply their trade. But he talked grandly of the immense powers of the baubles he vended, seeming to hold them in a sort of reverence. And, when he had spread his arms, there had been a short-lived hint of suppressed power. Musa shuddered a little.  \"But I must go to the temple now, if I am to make arrangements for my voyage,\" he added apologetically. He turned away, then hurried down the street.  Banasel watched him go, a slight smile growing on his face.  \"I don't blame you, Pal,\" he chuckled softly. \"I'd feel the same way myself.\"  He glanced around noting a narrow alley. Casually, he walked into it, then looked around carefully. No one could observe him. He straightened, dropping the slightly disreputable, hangdog manner, then reached for his body shield controls.  Quickly, he cut out visibility, then actuated the levitator modulation and narrowed out of the alley, rose over the city, and headed toward the rugged mountains that formed the backbone of the island.         *       *       *       *       *  Lanko was waiting, and quickly lowered the base shield.  \"Well,\" he asked, \"how did it go?\"  \"I found him.\" Banasel walked over to the cabinets, and started sorting the goods he had been carrying. \"Sold him a miniature communicator. Now, I hope he wears the thing.\"  \"We'll have to keep a close watch on him,\" commented Lanko, \"just in case he puts it in his luggage and forgets about it. Did you give him a good sales talk?\"  \"Sure. Told him to wear it always. I pawed the air, raved a little, and made him think I was crazy. But I've an idea he'll remember and grab the thing if he sees trouble coming.\" Banasel put the last ornament in its place, and started unhooking his personal equipment. Then, he turned.  \"Look,\" he commented, \"why bother with all this mystic business? We've got mentacoms. Why not just clamp onto him, and keep track of him that way? It'd be a lot simpler. Less chance of a slip, too.\"  \"Yeah, sure it would.\" Lanko gave his companion a disgusted look. \"But have you ever tried that little trick?\"  \"No. I never had the occasion, but I've seen guardsmen run remote surveillances, and even exert control when necessary. They didn't have any trouble. We could try it, anyway.\"  Lanko sat up. \"We could try it,\" he admitted, \"but I know what would happen. I did try it once, and I found out a lot of things--quick.\" He looked into space for a moment. \"How old are you, Banasel?\"  \"Why, you know that. I'm forty-one.\"  Lanko nodded. \"So am I,\" he said. \"And our civilization is a few thousand years old. And our species is somewhat older than that. We were in basic Guard training, and later in specialist philosophical training together. It took ten years, remember?\"  \"Sure. I remember every minute of it.\"  \"Of course you do. It was that kind of training. But how old do you think some of those young guardsmen we worked with were?\"  \"Why, most of 'em were kids, fresh from school.\"  \"That they were. But how many years--our years--had they spent in their schooling? How old were the civilizations they came from? And how old were their species?\"  Lanko eyed him wryly.  Banasel looked thoughtfully across the room. \"I never thought of it that way. Why, I suppose some of their forefathers were worrying about space travel before this planet was able to support life. And, come to think of it, I remember one of them making a casual remark about 'just a period ago,' when he was starting citizen training.\"  \"That's what I mean.\" Lanko nodded emphatically. \"'Just a period.' Only ten or twelve normal lifetimes for our kind of people. And his civilization's just as old compared to ours as he is compared to us--older, even.  \"During that period he was so casual about, he was learning--practicing with his mind, so that the older citizens of the galaxy could make full contact with him without fear of injuring his mentality. He was learning concepts that he wouldn't dare even suggest to you or to me. Finally, after a few more periods, he'll begin to become mature. Do you think we could pick up all the knowledge and training back of his handling of technical equipment in a mere ten years of training?\"  Banasel reached up, taking the small circlet from his head. He held it in his hand, looking at it with increased respect.  \"You know,\" he admitted, \"I really hadn't thought of it that way. They taught me to repair these things, among other pieces of equipment, and most of the construction is actually simple. They taught me a few uses for it, and I thought I understood it.  \"Of course, I knew we were in contact with an advanced culture, and I knew that most of those guys we treated so casually had something that took a long time in the getting,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22426"],["title","The Players (#4)"],["body"," but I didn't stop to think of the real stretch of time and study involved.\" He leaned back, replacing the mentacom on his head. \"Somehow, they didn't make it apparent.\"  \"Of course they didn't.\" Lanko spread his hands a little. \"One doesn't deliberately give children a feeling of inferiority.\"  \"Yeah. Will we ever learn?\"  \"Some. Some day. But we've got a long, lonely road to travel first.\" Lanko stood up and adjusted the communicator.  \"Right now, though, we'd better keep tabs on Musa. In fact, we'd better follow him when he leaves here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The temple of Kondaro, the sea god, had been built at the edge of a cliff, so that it overlooked the Eastern Sea. The huge, white dome furnished a landmark for mariners far out at sea, and dominated the waterfront of Norlar. Atop the dome, a torch provided a beacon to relieve the blackness of moonless nights. This was the home of the crimson priests, and the center of guidance for all who wished to sail eastward.  Musa stood for some time, admiring the temple, then walked between the carefully clipped hedges and up the long line of steps leading to the arched entrance.  Again, he stopped. Overhead, the curved ceiling of the main dome was lower than its outer dimensions would lead one to believe, but Musa hardly noticed that. He gazed about the main rotunda.  It was predominantly blue. The dome was a smooth, blue sky, and the smooth blueness continued down the walls. The white stone steps were terminated at the edges of a mosaic sea, which stretched to the far walls, broken only by a large statue of the sea god. Kondaro stood in the center of his temple, facing the entrance. One arm stretched out, the hand holding a torch, while the other arm cradled one of the great ships favored by the god. Beneath one foot was one of the batlike sea demons, its face mirroring ultimate despair. About the feet lapped conventionally sculptured waves, which melted into the mosaic, to be continued to the walls by the pattern of the tiles. At the far side of the rotunda, the double stairs, which led to bronze doors, were almost inconspicuous, seeming to be a vaguely appearing mirage on the horizon of a limitless sea.  The trader looked at the far side, then down, and hesitated, feeling as though he were about to walk on water. Then, he turned, remembering the pedestal nearby. A crimson bowl rested on this stand, and beside it was a slave in the crimson loincloth which marked the menials of Kondaro.  Musa stepped over to the pedestal, dropped a coin into the bowl, and walked toward the rear of the temple, making proper obeisance to the huge statue. A young priest approached him.  \"I crave blessings for a voyage I propose to take,\" announced the trader.  The priest inclined his head.  \"Very well, Traveler, follow me.\"  He led the way to a small office. An older priest sat at a large table, reading a tablet. Conveniently placed were writing materials, and on the table before him was another votive bowl. Musa dropped a coin into the bowl, and the priest looked up.  \"I bring a voyager, O, Wise One,\" said the young priest.  \"It is well,\" the older priest acknowledged in a deep voice. He turned to Musa. \"Your name, Voyager?\"  Musa gave his name, his age, the amount of his goods, and an account of his actions since his arrival in Tanagor. At the mention of Tonda, the priest nodded.  \"The actions of Tonda have been most exemplary for the past several seasons,\" he remarked. \"He is a good man, but he lacks the proper spirit of sacrifice.\" He concluded his writing.  \"Well, then, Musa, you may go to those who sail ships with the blessing of Kondaro upon you. I shall only caution you as to the observance of the rites and laws for those who sail the Great Sea. Go now, in peace.\"  As Musa turned, the younger priest spoke. \"I will lead you to one who will give you further guidance,\" he said.  Musa followed him to another small room, where he met still another priest. This man, he discovered, was a shrewd trader in his own right. He was familiar with goods and their values, and in addition to the rites he described, he presented definite advice as to what to take and what to leave behind. Fortunately, Musa discovered as he talked to this priest, he had picked very nearly as good a selection as he could wish.  [Illustration]  During the days that followed, Musa made more votive offerings, practiced the rites ordered by the priest, and watched his goods as they were delivered to the _Bordeklu_, a ship belonging to Maladro, beloved of Kondaro, a shipowner whose ships were permitted by the sea god and his priests to sail the Eastern Sea.  At last, the day arrived when Musa himself boarded the ship and set sail past the headland of Norlar.         *       *       *       *       *  As the ship was warped out of the harbor, Musa took stock of his fellow passengers. Among them were a slender, handsome man named Ladro, who had been on many previous voyages to the land of the East, and Min-ta, a native of the eastern continent, who was returning from a trading voyage to Norlar. There were several others, but they kept to themselves, seeming to radiate an aura of exclusiveness. Ladro and Min-ta on the other hand, were more approachable.  _Surely_, thought Musa, _these two can teach me a great deal of the land I am to visit, if they will_.  He walked over to the rail, where the two stood, looking out over the shoreline. The ship was coming abreast of the great temple of Kondaro.  \"It's the most prominent landmark on the island, isn't it?\" Musa commented.  \"What?\" Ladro turned, looking at him curiously. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"the temple. Yes, it's the last thing you see as you leave, and the first when you return.\" He paused, examining Musa. \"This is your first trip?\"  \"Yes, it is. I've always traded ashore before this.\"  \"But you finally decided to visit Kneuros?\"  \"Yes. I've dealt with a few traders who had goods from there, and their stories interested me.\"  Ladro smiled. \"Romance of the far places?\"  \"Well, there's that, too,\" Musa admitted, \"but I'm interested in some of the merchandise I've seen.\"  \"There's profit in it,\" agreed Ladro. \"How long have you been trading around Norlar?\"  \"This is my first trip. I'm from Karth, in the Galankar.\"  \"You mean you were never in Norlar before?\" Min-ta joined the conversation.  Musa shook his head. \"I left Karth for the purpose of trading east of the Great Sea.\"  \"Unusual,\" mused Min-ta. \"Most traders work between Tanagor and the mainland for several years before they try the Sea.\"  \"Yes,\" added Ladro, \"and some never go out. They satisfy themselves with the channel trade.\" He pointed. \"We're getting out to the open sea now, past the reef.\"  The ship drew away from the island kingdom, setting its course toward the vague horizon. The day wore on, to be replaced by the extreme blackness of night. Then, the sky lit up again, heralding another day.  The ship's company had settled to sea routine, and the traders roamed about their portion of the deck, talking sometimes, or napping in the sun. Musa leaned over the low rail, watching the water, and admiring the clear, blue swells.  He raised his head as the door of the forward cabins opened. A priest, followed by a group of slaves, went up to the raised forecastle. Under the priest's direction, the slaves busied themselves putting up a high, crimson and yellow curtain across the foredeck. They completed their task and went below.  Again, the door opened, and a procession, headed by the chief priest, slowly mounted the ladder to the forecastle. Each of the three priests was followed by his slave, who bore a crimson casket. The curtain closed behind them, then the slaves came out and ranged themselves across the deck, facing aft.  \"I wonder,\" said Musa, turning to Ladro, \"what ritual they are performing.\"  Ladro shook his head. \"The less a man knows of the activities of the priests, the better he fares,\" he declared. \"Truly, on a great ship, curiosity is a deadly vice.\"  Musa nodded to the stern. \"I see that one of the priests is not at the bow.\"  \"That is right. One priest always remains by the steersman, to ward off the spells of the sea demons.\" Ladro paused, pointing overside. \"See,\" he said in a pleased tone, \"here is an envoy from Kondaro.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Musa's gaze followed the pointing finger. A huge fish was cruising alongside, gliding effortlessly through the waves, and occasionally leaping into the air.  \"An envoy?\"  \"Yes. So long as a kontar follows a ship, fair weather and smooth sailing may be expected. They are sent by Kondaro as guardians for those ships he especially favors.\"  At a call from the priest in the stern, two sailors appeared, carrying chunks of meat. As the priest chanted, they tossed these overside. The great fish rose from the water, catching one of the chunks as it fell, then dropped back, and the water frothed whitely as he retrieved the other. He gulped the meat, then swam contentedly, still pacing the ship.  \"Suppose someone fell overboard?\" Musa gazed at the kontar in fascination.  Ladro and Min-ta exchanged glances.  \"If one is favored by the Great One,\" replied Min-ta slowly, \"it is believed that the kontar would guard him from harm. Otherwise, the sacrifice would be accepted.\"  Musa looked at the clear water, then glanced back to the spot of foam which drew astern.  \"I don't believe I'll try any swimming from the ship.\" He backed slightly from the rail, glancing quickly at Ladro and Min-ta, then looking away again.  He suddenly realized that he had exceeded his quota of questions, and that he could get into trouble. He had noted that most of the ship's company appeared to know the other traders aboard, even though some of them hadn't been to sea before. Min-ta and Ladro were obviously well acquainted with several of the ship's officers. But he, Musa, was a stranger.  He had already observed that the priesthood of Kondaro was not "]]]
