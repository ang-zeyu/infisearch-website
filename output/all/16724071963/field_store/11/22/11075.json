Our mechanics are building a broadcast unit we'll spare a tiny bit of fuel for. It will run twenty-odd years, broadcasting directions so it can be found regardless of how the terrain is changed by drifting sand.\"  \"And,\" said Bordman, \"the fact that nobody will be here to give directions.\"  Chuka added benignly:  \"We're doing a great deal of singing, too. My people are ... ah ... religious. When we are ... ah ... no longer here ... there have been boastings that there'll be a well-practiced choir ready to go to work in the next world.\"  White teeth showed in grins. Bordman was almost envious of men who could grin at such a thought. But he went on grimly:  \"And I understand that athletics have also been much practiced.\"  Redfeather said:  \"There's been time for it. Climbing teams have counted coup on all the worst mountains within three hundred miles. There's been a new record set for the javelin, adjusted for gravity constant, and Johnny Cornstalk did a hundred yards in eight point four seconds. Aletha has the records and has certified them.\"  \"Very useful!\" said Bordman sardonically. Then he disliked himself for saying it even before the bronze-skinned men's faces grew studiedly impassive.  Chuka waved his hand.  \"Wait, Ralph! Lewanika's nephew will beat that within a week!\"  Bordman was ashamed again because Chuka had spoken to cover up his own ill-nature.  \"I take it back!\" he said irritably. \"What I said was uncalled for. I shouldn't have said it! But I came here to do a completion survey and what you've been giving me is material for an estimate of morale! It's not my line! I'm a technician, first and foremost! We're faced with a technical problem!\"  Aletha spoke suddenly from behind him.  \"But these are men, first and foremost, Mr. Bordman. And they're faced with a very human problem--how to die well. They seem to be rather good at it, so far.\"  Bordman ground his teeth. He was again humiliated. In his own fashion he was attempting the same thing. But just as he was genetically not qualified to endure the climate of this planet, he was not prepared for a fatalistic or pious acceptance of disaster. Amerind and African, alike, these men instinctively held to their own ideas of what the dignity of a man called upon him to do when he could not do anything but die. But Bordman's idea of his human dignity required him to be still fighting: still scratching at the eyes of fate or destiny when he was slain. It was in his blood or genes or the result of training. He simply could not, with self-respect, accept any physical situation as hopeless even when his mind assured him that it was.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I agree,\" he said coldly, \"but still I have to think in technical terms. You might say that we are going to die because we cannot land the _Warlock_ with food and equipment. We cannot land the _Warlock_ because we have no landing grid. We have no landing grid because it and all the material to complete it is buried under millions of tons of sand. We cannot make a new light-supply-ship type of landing grid because we have no smelter to make beams, nor power to run it if we had, yet if we had the beams we could get the power to run the smelter we haven't got to make the beams. And we have no smelter, hence no beams, no power, no prospect of food or help because we can't land the _Warlock_. It is strictly a circular problem. Break it at any point and all of it is solved.\"  One of the dark men muttered something under his breath to those near him. There were chuckles.  \"Like Mr. Woodchuck,\" explained the man, when Bordman's eyes fell on him. \"When I was a little boy there was a story like that.\"  Bordman said icily:  \"The problem of coolness and water and food is the same sort of problem. In six months we could raise food--if we had power to condense moisture. We've chemicals for hydroponics--if we could keep the plants from roasting as they grew. Refrigeration and water and food are practically another circular problem.\"  Aletha said tentatively:  \"Mr. Bordman----\"  He turned, annoyed. Aletha said almost apologetically:  \"On Chagan there was a--you might call it a woman's coup given to a woman I know. Her husband raises horses. He's mad about them. And they live in a sort of home on caterwheels out on the plains--the llanos. Sometimes they're months away from a settlement. And she loves ice cream and refrigeration isn't too simple. But she has a Doctorate in Human History. So she had her husband make an insulated tray on the roof of their trailer and she makes her ice cream there.\"  Men looked at her. Her cousin said amusedly:  \"That should rate some sort of technical-coup feather!\"  \"The Council gave her a brass pot--official,\" said Aletha. \"Domestic science achievement.\" To Bordman she explained: \"Her husband put a tray on the roof of their house, insulated from the heat of the house below. During the day there's an insulated cover on top of it, insulating it from the heat of the sun. At night she takes off the top cover and pours her custard, thin, in the tray. Then she goes to bed. She has to get up before daybreak to scrape it up, but by then the ice cream is frozen. Even on a warm night.\" She looked from one to another. \"I don't know why. She said it was done in a place called Babylonia on Earth, many thousands of years ago.\"  Bordman blinked. Then he said decisively:  \"Damn! Who knows how much the ground-temperature drops here before dawn?\"  \"I do,\" said Aletha's cousin, mildly. \"The top-sand temperature falls forty-odd degrees. Warmer underneath, of course. But the air here is almost cool when the sun rises. Why?\"  \"Nights are cooler on all planets,\" said Bordman, \"because every night the dark side radiates heat to empty space. There'd be frost everywhere every morning if the ground didn't store up heat during the day. If we prevent daytime heat-storage--cover a patch of ground before dawn and leave it covered all day--and uncover it all night while shielding it from warm winds---- We've got refrigeration! The night sky is empty space itself! Two hundred and eighty below zero!\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a murmur. Then argument. The foremen of the Xosa II colony-preparation crew were strictly practical men, but they had the habit of knowing why some things were practical. One does not do modern steel construction in contempt of theory, nor handle modern mining tools without knowing why as well as how they work. This proposal sounded like something that was based on reason--that should work to some degree. But how well? Anybody could guess that it should cool something at least twice as much as the normal night temperature-drop. But somebody produced a slipstick and began to juggle it expertly. He astonishedly announced his results. Others questioned, and then verified it. Nobody paid much attention to Bordman. But there was a hum of absorbed discussion, in which Redfeather and Chuka were immediately included. By calculation, it astoundingly appeared that if the air on Xosa II was really as clear as the bright stars and deep day-sky color indicated, every second night a total drop of one hundred and eighty degrees temperature could be secured by radiation to interstellar space--if there were no convection-currents, and they could be prevented by----  It was the convection-current problem which broke the assembly into groups with different solutions. But it was Dr. Chuka who boomed at all of them to try all three solutions and have them ready before daybreak, so the assembly left the hulk, still disputing enthusiastically. But somebody had recalled that there were dewponds in the one arid area on Timbuk, and somebody else remembered that irrigation on Delmos III was accomplished that same way. And they recalled how it was done----  Voices went away in the ovenlike night outside. Bordman grimaced, and again said:  \"Damn! Why didn't I think of that myself?\"  \"Because,\" said Aletha, smiling, \"you aren't a Doctor of Human History with a horse-raising husband and a fondness for ice cream. Even so, a technician was needed to break down the problem here into really simple terms.\" Then she said, \"I think Bob Running Antelope might approve of you, Mr. Bordman.\"  Bordman fumed to himself.  \"Who's he? Just what does that whole comment mean?\"  \"I'll tell you,\" said Aletha, \"when you've solved one or two more problems.\"  Her cousin came back into the room. He said with gratification:  \"Chuka can turn out silicone-wool insulation, he says. Plenty of material, and he'll use a solar mirror to get the heat he needs. Plenty of temperature to make silicones! How much area will we need to pull in four thousand gallons of water a night?\"  \"How do I know?\" demanded Bordman. \"What's the moisture-content of the air here, anyhow?\" Then he said vexedly, \"Tell me! Are you using heat-exchangers to help cool the air you pump into the buildings, before you use power to refrigerate it? It would save some power----\"  The Indian project engineer said absorbedly:  \"Let's get to work on this! I'm a steel man myself, but----\"  They settled down. Aletha turned a page.  The _Warlock_ spun around the planet. The members of its crew withdrew into themselves. In even two months of routine tedious voyaging to this planet, there had been the beginnings of irritation with the mannerisms of other men. Now there would be years of it. At the beginning, every man tended to become a hermit so that he could postpone as long as possible the time when he would hate his shipmates. Monotony was already so familiar that its continuance was a foreknown evil. The crew of the _Warlock_ already knew how intolerable they would presently be to each other, and the foreknowledge tended to make them intolerable now.  Within two days of its establishment in orbit, the _Warlock_ was manned by men already morbidly resentful of fate; with the psychology of prisoners "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22467"],["title","Sand Doom (#7)"],["body","to close confinement for an indeterminate but ghastly period. On the third day there was a second fist fight. A bitter one.  Fist fights are not healthy symptoms in a spaceship which cannot hope to make port for a matter of years.         *       *       *       *       *  Most human problems are circular and fall apart when a single trivial part of them is solved. There used to be enmity between races because they were different, and they tended to be different because they were enemies, so there was enmity--The big problem of interstellar flight was that nothing could travel faster than light, and nothing could travel faster than light because mass increased with speed, and mass increased with speed--obviously!--because ships remained in the same time-slot, and ships remained in the same time-slot long after a one-second shift was possible because nobody realized that it meant traveling faster than light. And even before there was interstellar travel, there was practically no interplanetary commerce because it took so much fuel to take off and land. And it took more fuel to carry the fuel to take off and land, and more still to carry the fuel for that, until somebody used power on the ground for heave-off instead of take-off, and again on the ground for landing. And then interplanetary ships carried cargoes. And on Xosa II there was an emergency because a sandstorm had buried the almost completed landing grid under some megatons of sand, and it couldn't be completed because there was only storage power because it wasn't completed, because there was only storage power because----  But it took three weeks for the problem to be seen as the ultimately simple thing it really was. Bordman had called it a circular problem, but he hadn't seen its true circularity. It was actually--like all circular problems--inherently an unstable set of conditions. It began to fall apart when he saw that mere refrigeration would break its solidity.  In one week there were ten acres of desert covered with silicone-wool-felt in great strips. By day a reflective surface was uppermost, and at sundown caterwheel trucks hooked on to towlines and neatly pulled it over on its back, to expose gridded black-body surfaces to the starlight. And the gridding was precisely designed so that winds blowing across it did not make eddies in the grid-squares, and the chilled air in those pockets remained undisturbed and there was no conduction of heat downward by eddy currents, while there was admirable radiation of heat out to space. And this was in the manner of the night sides of all planets, only somewhat more efficient.         *       *       *       *       *  In two weeks there was a water yield of three thousand gallons per night, and in three weeks more there were similar grids over the colony houses and a vast roofed cooling-shed for pre-chilling of air to be used by the refrigeration systems themselves. The fuel-store--stored power--was thereupon stretched to three times its former calculated usefulness. The situation was no longer a simple and neat equation of despair.  Then something else happened. One of Dr. Chuka's assistants was curious about a certain mineral. He used the solar furnace that had made the silicone wool to smelt it. And Dr. Chuka saw him. And after one blank moment he bellowed laughter and went to see Ralph Redfeather. Whereupon Amerind steel-workers sawed apart a robot hull that was no longer a fuel tank because its fuel was gone, and they built a demountable solar mirror some sixty feet across--which African mechanics deftly powered--and suddenly there was a spot of incandescence even brighter than the sun of Xosa II, down on the planet's surface. It played upon a mineral cliff, and monstrous smells developed and even the African mining-technicians put on goggles because of the brightness, and presently there were threads of molten metal and slag trickling--and separating as they trickled--hesitantly down the cliff-side.  And Dr. Chuka beamed and slapped his sweating thighs, and Bordman went out in a caterwheel truck, wearing a heat-suit, to watch it for all of twenty minutes. When he got back to the Project Engineer's office he gulped iced salt water and dug out the books he'd brought down from the ship. There was the specbook for Xosa II, and there were the other volumes of definitions issued by the Colonial Survey. They were definitions of the exact meanings of terms used in briefer specifications, for items of equipment sometimes ordered by the Colony Office.         *       *       *       *       *  When Chuka came into the office, presently, he carried the first crude pig of Xosa II iron in his gloved hand. He gloated. Bordman was then absent, and Ralph Redfeather worked feverishly at his desk.  \"Where's Bordman?\" demanded Chuka in that resonant bass voice of his. \"I'm ready to report for degree-of-completion credit that the mining properties on Xosa II are prepared as of today to deliver pig iron, cobalt, zirconium and beryllium in commercial quantities! We require one day's notice to begin delivery of metal other than iron at the moment, because we're short of equipment, but we can furnish chromium and manganese on two days' notice--the deposits are farther away.\"  He dumped the pig of metal on the second desk, where Aletha sat with her perpetual loose-leafed volumes before her. The metal smoked and began to char the desk-top. He picked it up again and tossed it from one gloved hand to the other.  \"There y'are, Ralph!\" he boasted. \"You Indians go after your coups! Match this coup for me! Without fuel and minus all equipment except of our own making--I credit an assist on the mirror, but that's all--we're set to load the first ship that comes in for cargo! Now what are you going to do for the record? I think we've wiped your eye for you!\"  Ralph hardly looked up. His eyes were very bright. Bordman had shown him and he was copying feverishly the figures and formulae from a section of the definition book of the Colonial Survey. The books started with the specifications for antibiotic growth equipment for colonies with problems in local bacteria. It ended with definitions of the required strength-of-material and the designs stipulated for cages in zoos for motile fauna, subdivided into flying, marine, and solid-ground creatures: sub-sub-divided into carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores, with the special specifications for enclosures to contain abyssal creatures requiring extreme pressures, and the equipment for maintaining a healthfully re-poisoned atmosphere for creatures from methane planets.  Redfeather had the third volume open at, \"Landing Grids, Lightest Emergency, Commerce Refuges, For Use Of.\" There were some dozens of non-colonized planets along the most-traveled spaceways on which refuges for shipwrecked spacemen were maintained. Small forces of Patrol personnel manned them. Space lifeboats serviced them. They had the minimum installations which could draw on their planets' ionospheres for power, and they were not expected to handle anything bigger than a twenty-ton lifeboat. But the specifications for the equipment of such refuges were included in the reference volumes for Bordman's use in the making of Colonial surveys. They were compiled for the information of contractors who wanted to bid on Colonial Survey installations, and for the guidance of people like Bordman who checked up on the work. So they contained all the data for the building of a landing grid, lightest emergency, commerce refuge for use of, in case of need. Redfeather copied feverishly.  Chuka ceased his boasting, but still he grinned.  \"I know we're stuck, Ralph,\" he said amiably, \"but it's nice stuff to go in the records. Too bad we don't keep coup-records like you Indians!\"  Aletha's cousin--Project Engineer--said crisply:  \"Go away! Who made your solar mirror? It was more than an assist! You get set to cast beams for us! Girders! I'm going to get a lifeboat aloft and away to Trent! Build a minimum size landing grid! Build a fire under somebody so they'll send us a colony ship with supplies! If there's no new sandstorm to bury the radiation refrigerators Bordman brought to mind, we can keep alive with hydroponics until a ship can arrive with something useful!\"  Chuka stared.  \"You don't mean we might actually live through this! Really?\"  Aletha regarded the two of them with impartial irony.  \"Dr. Chuka,\" she said gently, \"you accomplished the impossible. Ralph, here, is planning to attempt the preposterous. Does it occur to you that Mr. Bordman is nagging himself to achieve the inconceivable? It is inconceivable, even to him, but he's trying to do it!\"  \"What's he trying to do?\" demanded Chuka, wary but amused.  \"He's trying,\" said Aletha, \"to prove to himself that he's the best man on this planet. Because he's physically least capable of living here! His vanity's hurt. Don't underestimate him!\"  \"He the best man here?\" demanded Chuka blankly. \"In his way he's all right. The refrigeration proves that! But he can't walk out-of-doors without a heat-suit!\"  Ralph Redfeather said dryly, without ceasing his feverish work:  \"Nonsense, Aletha. He has courage. I give him that. But he couldn't walk a beam twelve hundred feet up. In his own way, yes. He's capable. But the best man----\"  \"I'm sure,\" agreed Aletha, \"that he couldn't sing as well as the worst of your singing crew, Dr. Chuka, and any Amerind could outrun him. Even I could! But he's got something we haven't got, just as we have qualities he hasn't. We're secure in our competences. We know what we can do, and that we can do it better than any--\" her eyes twinkled--\"paleface. But he doubts himself. All the time and in every way. And that's why he may be the best man on this planet! I'll bet he does prove it!\"  Redfeather said scornfully:  \"You suggested radiation refrigeration! What does it prove that he applied it?\"  \"That,\" said Aletha, \"he couldn't face the disaster"]]]
