Gatton continued to look at me in that perplexed way, and believing that I detected the trend of his reflections:  \"Look here, Inspector,\" I said, \"let us understand one another. Whatever may be the evidence of stage-doorkeepers and others, upon one point you can be assured. Miss Merlin had nothing whatever to do with this horrible crime. The idea is unthinkable. So confident am I of this, that you can be perfectly open with me and I give you my word of honor that I shall be equally frank with you. The truth of the matter cannot possibly injure her in the end and I am as anxious to discover it as you are.\"  Gatton suddenly extended his hand, and:  \"Good!\" he said. \"We understand one another, but how is Miss Merlin going to explain this?\"  He drew a note-book from his pocket, turned over several leaves, and then:  \"On no fewer than six occasions,\" he said, \"I have approximate dates here, Sir Marcus sent his card to Miss Merlin's dressing-room.\"  \"I know,\" I interrupted him; \"he persecuted her, but she never saw him.\"  \"Wait a minute. Last night\"--Gatton glanced at me sharply--\"Marie, the maid, came down after Sir Marcus's card had been sent to the dressing-room and talked for several minutes to the late baronet, just by the doorkeeper's box, but out of earshot. That was at ten o'clock. At eleven, that is after the performance, Sir Marcus returned, and again Marie came down to see him. They went out into the street together and Sir Marcus entered a cab which was waiting and drove off. Miss Merlin left a quarter of an hour later.\"  Our glances met and a silence of some moments' duration fell between us; then:  \"You suggest,\" I said, \"that Miss Merlin had arranged a rendezvous with him and to save appearances had joined him there later?\"  \"Well\"--Gatton raised his eyebrows--\"what do _you_ suggest?\"  I found myself temporarily at a loss for words, but:  \"Knowing nothing of this,\" I explained, \"naturally I was not in a position to tax Miss Merlin with it. Possibly you have done so. What is her explanation?\"  \"I have not seen her,\" confessed Gatton; \"I arrived at her flat ten minutes after she had gone out--with you.\"  \"You saw Marie?\"  \"Unfortunately Marie was also out, but I saw an old charwoman who attends daily, I understand, and it was from her that I learned of your visit.\"  \"Marie,\" I said, \"may be able to throw some light on the matter.\"  \"I don't doubt it!\" replied Gatton grimly. \"Meanwhile we have sufficient evidence to show that Sir Marcus drove from the New Avenue Theater to this house.\"  \"He may not have driven here at all,\" I interrupted; \"he may have driven somewhere else and performed the latter part of his journey here--\"  \"In the crate!\" cried Gatton. \"Yes, you are right; his body may actually have been inside the crate at the time that you and Bolton arrived here last night; for that would be fully an hour after Sir Marcus left the stage-door.\"  \"But who can have rung up the police station last night?\" I cried, \"and what can have been the object of this unknown person?\"  \"That we have to find out,\" said Gatton quietly; \"undoubtedly it formed part of a scheme planned with extraordinary cunning; it was not an accident or an oversight, I mean. The men who are assisting me haven't been idle, for we have already learned some most amazing facts about the case. I haven't yet visited the house myself, but I have here the report of one of my assistants who has done so; also I have the keys. The garage I will inspect more carefully later on.\"  He glanced quickly about the place before we left it, then, leaving the door locked behind us, we walked along to the gate before which the constable stood on duty, and from thence proceeded up the drive to the front entrance. There was a deep porch supported by pillars and densely overgrown with creeper. I noted, too, a heavy and unhealthy odor as of decaying leaves, and observed that a perfect carpet of these lay on the path. In the shade of the big trees it was comparatively cool, but the heavy malarious smell did not please me and I imagined that it must have repelled more than one would-be lessee.  As we approached the porch I saw that the windows of the rooms immediately left and right of it had been stripped of the agent's bills, for I could see where fragments of paper still adhered to the glass. There were no bills in the porch either; but when Gatton opened the front door I uttered an exclamation of surprise.  We stood in a small lounge-hall. There was a staircase on the left and three doors opened on to the hall. But although the Red House was palpably unoccupied, the hall was furnished! There were some rugs upon the polished floor, a heavy bronze club-fender in front of the grate, several chairs against the walls and a large palm in a Chinese pot.  \"Why,\" I exclaimed, \"the place is furnished and the stairs are carpeted too!\"  \"Yes,\" said Gatton, looking keenly about him, \"but according to report if you will step upstairs you will get a surprise.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Well, suppose we go and see.\"  Gatton led the way and I followed up the stairs as far as the first landing. Here I paused in amazement. For at this point all attempts at furnishing ceased. The landing was quite bare and so were the stairs above it! Seeing my expression of incredulous surprise:  \"Yes,\" said Gatton, smiling, \"it's a strange arrangement, isn't it?\"  We descended again to the furnished hall.  \"Look here,\" continued my companion.  He unlocked a door on the left, having tried several keys from the bunch which he carried without success, but finally discovering the right one.  A long rectangular room was revealed, evidently intended for a dining-room. It was empty and unfurnished, odds and ends of newspaper and other rubbish lying here and there upon the floor. My astonishment was momentarily increasing. A second door, that in the center, Gatton opened, revealing another empty room, but:  \"I have reserved this one for the last,\" he said: \"you will find that it is unlocked.\"  He pointed to the third door, that on the right, and as he evidently intended me to open it, I stepped forward, turned the handle and entered a small square room, exquisitely furnished.  A heavy Persian carpet was spread upon the floor and the windows were draped with some kind of brightly colored Madras. Tastefully-framed water-colors hung upon the wall. There was a quaint cabinet in the room, too; a low cushioned settee and two armchairs. In the center was a table upon which stood a lamp with a large mosaic shade. Two high-backed chairs were set to the table--and the table was laid for supper! A bottle of wine stood in an ice-pail, in which the ice had long since melted, and a tempting cold repast was spread. The table was decorated with a bowl of perfect white roses. The silver was good; the napery was snowy.  Like a fool I stood gaping at the spectacle, until, noting the direction of Gatton's glance, I turned my attention to the mantelpiece upon which a clock was ticking with a dull and solemn note.  Standing beside the clock, in a curious carved frame, was a large photograph of Isobel!     CHAPTER VI  THE VOICE   \"This is where the mystery centers,\" said Gatton.  I made no reply, for I had not yet recovered from the shock of that discovery in the deserted supper room. It was so wholly unexpected and yet it so cruelly confirmed the Inspector's undisguised suspicions that it seemed to me to have created a sort of impalpable barrier between us. Of this Gatton was evidently conscious. He endeavored to arouse my interest in the inquiries which he was conducting in the garage, but for long enough I saw nothing of the place in which we stood; I could only see that photograph smiling at me inquiringly through a haze of doubt, and my companion's words reached me in a muffled fashion. Finally, however, I succeeded in rousing myself from this dazed condition, and confident as ever that Isobel was innocent of all complicity in the matter:  \"The presence of the photograph,\" I said, \"takes us a step further. Don't you see, Inspector, that this is a deeply and cunningly laid trap? What I had taken for a series of unfortunate coincidences I perceive now to be the workings of an elaborate scheme involving perfectly innocent people in the crime.\"  \"H'm,\" said Gatton doubtfully; \"it may be as you suggest; at any rate it is a new point of view and one which I confess had not occurred to me. There is one witness who can clear up any doubt on the subject.\"  \"You mean Marie?\"  \"Exactly. She will lie, beyond doubt, but we shall find means to reach the truth.\"  \"Would it not be advisable, Inspector,\" I asked excitedly, \"to make sure of her at once?\"  Gatton smiled grimly, and:  \"Marie would have to make herself invisible to evade Scotland Yard now,\" he replied. \"She is being watched closely. But,\" he continued, \"what do you make of these marks on the door?\"  We had reclosed the garage door and now were standing immediately inside. The marks to which my companion had drawn my attention were situated high up near the roof.  \"This may account for the statement of Bolton that the door seemed more difficult to open last night than to-day,\" he said. \"Unless I am greatly mistaken, some sort of attachment existed here until quite recently.\"  \"Possibly a contrivance for reclosing the door?\" I suggested.  The marks in fact roughly corresponded to those which would be made by the presence of such a contrivance and there seemed to have been some attempt where it had been removed to disguise the holes left by the screws.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],["title","The Green Eyes of BÃ¢st (#7)"],["body","\"But the purpose of it?\" muttered Gatton helplessly.  \"God knows,\" I said; \"the purpose of the whole thing is a mystery beyond me entirely.\"  \"Assuming that such a piece of mechanism as you suggest had been attached to the door,\" mused Gatton, \"you would have noticed its operation last night, unless one of you held the door open.\"  \"Neither of us held the door!\" I interrupted excitedly. \"I remember that we stood just outside looking in. I was behind the constable and he was directing the rays of his lantern into the place.\"  \"H'm,\" muttered Gatton. \"Then it wasn't a contrivance for closing the door; it was something else. Suppose we investigate the other door?\"  We proceeded to the other door and I became aware of an intense curiosity respecting what we should find, and of a conviction too that there would be evidence here of another attachment. In this I was quite correct. Some piece of mechanism had evidently been fastened to this door also. Together we stood staring up at these tell-tale screw-holes and then rather blankly we stared at one another.  \"We only lack one thing,\" said Gatton; \"the scheme upon which all these contrivances and apparently isolated episodes were hung together. Nothing, as we have already assumed, was accident, and nothing coincidence. It was with some deliberate purpose that the constable was instructed to walk through this garage, opening and shutting the doors behind him.\"  \"From whom did these instructions come?\"  \"That is one of the minor points which I have already cleared up,\" he replied. \"On my way here I called at the house agent's, as you know, since I have the keys; I also called at the station. The sergeant who was on duty last night I could not see, unfortunately, but I learned--that it was a woman who rang up.\"  My heart sank lower and lower. It seemed to me as we stood in that empty garage that an invisible hand was drawing a net closer and closer about Isobel and my ideas became increasingly chaotic, for the purpose of it all eluded me, try how I would to conceive of a scheme by which any one could profit which necessitated the imprisonment, or worse, of Isobel.  \"And the agent?\" I asked in a rather toneless voice.  Gatton shook his head.  \"I have no reason to doubt the word of this man of business,\" he replied, \"because at the time when I saw him he could not possibly have learned of the crime, but nevertheless his account is almost unbelievable. It appears then, he, too, received his instructions throughout by telephone.\"  \"What?\" I exclaimed.  \"By telephone,\" repeated Gatton. \"He was rung up about ten days ago by some one who made a verbal offer to lease the Red House for a period of twelve months. A foreigner, who in lieu of the usual references, was prepared to pay the annual rent in advance. As the Red House, to use an Irishism, was regarded as something of a white elephant, the agent was interested, apparently; and when on the following day the sum agreed upon arrived by post, he did not demur about delivering the keys to the prospective lessee, who desired to take certain measurements in regard to carpets and so forth.\"  \"Wait a moment,\" I interrupted; \"to whom did he deliver these keys?\"  \"To a district messenger who called for them, as the agent had been advised that one would do.\"  \"Very well. What then?\"  \"That is all that the agent had to say.\"  \"What, that is all?\"  \"Substantially there is nothing more. It is quite evident that the sole intention of this unknown lessee was to secure possession of the house for the purpose of the crime only.\"  \"Do you mean that from first to last no one but the district messenger appeared in the matter?\"  \"No one,\" Gatton assured me, \"and the rent, payment of which quite disarmed the agent of course, was sent in the form of Treasury notes and not by check.\"  \"But surely some name, some address, must have been given?\"  \"A name was given,\" replied Gatton, \"and a hotel address, but confirmation of their accuracy was never sought, after the receipt of the money.\"  \"And the voice on the telephone?\"  Again I saw that odd expression creep over Gatton's face, and:  \"It was a woman's voice,\" he answered.  \"Great heavens!\" I muttered--\"what does it all mean?\"  That the evidence of the cabman when he was discovered and of the carter who had taken the box from the garage to the docks, and (for it was possibly the same man) who had first delivered it at the Red House, would but tighten the net about Isobel, whom I knew to be innocent, I felt assured.  \"Gatton,\" I said, \"this case appears to me to resolve itself into a deliberate conspiracy of which the end was not the assassination of Sir Marcus, but the conviction of Miss Merlin!\"  Gatton looked at me with evident complexity written all over him.  \"I begin to think the same,\" he confessed. \"This business was never planned and carried out by a woman, I'll swear to that. There is a woman concerned in it, for at every point we come upon evidence of her voice issuing the mysterious instructions; but she is not alone in the matter. Already the intricacy of the thing points to a criminal of genius. When we know the whole truth, if we ever do, that the crime was planned by a man of amazing, if perverted, intellect, will be put beyond dispute, I think.\"  \"What is puzzling me, Gatton,\" I said, \"is the connection existing between the incidents which took place in this garage and those, unknown at present, which took place in the furnished room in the Red House.\"  \"Obviously,\" replied Gatton, \"a supper for two had been prepared, and that one of those two was the late Sir Marcus is perfectly obvious. That he expected the other to be Miss Merlin is at least suggested by the presence of her photograph in the room; for you will have noticed that it is the _only_ photograph there.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" I said firmly, \"I am positive that no one would be more surprised than herself to learn of its presence.\"  \"And as I have already said,\" replied Gatton, \"I am rapidly coming round to your way of thinking. But even if I were quite sure of it the evidence at the moment is all the other way, you will admit. As to the connection between this garage and the interrupted supper party (for obviously it was interrupted) this it must be my business to find out.\"  \"Don't you think,\" I said, \"that we are attaching perhaps undue importance to the fact that some kind of fittings have been removed from the doors? They may have been removed by the late occupier, and the call to the police depÃ´t may have been made with the idea of securing a witness, and a credible one, to the presence of the crate here on the night of the murder.\"  \"At the moment,\" replied Gatton, musingly, \"I cannot see that this would have served any useful purpose; but nevertheless you may be right. I am going to assume, however, that you are wrong, and that the object of sending Bolton here last night was to open and shut these doors. I propose now to return again to the scene of the interrupted supper.\"  Leaving the garage not very much wiser than when we had entered it, we paced once more up the drive in the shade of the big trees and were greeted again by the malarious smell of rotting leaves. Entering the Red House, Gatton and I proceeded first to that incredible oasis in the desert of empty rooms and my companion made a detailed examination of everything in the place, even sounding the walls, examining the fittings of the door, and finally proceeding through the hall in the direction of the south wing of the house--that nearest to the garage.  What he expected to find I had no idea, but his attention seemed to be more particularly directed towards the wainscot and the picture-rails of the empty and uncarpeted rooms which we entered. Whatever he had sought he failed to find, and at last we stood in a desolate apartment looking out into the tangled shrubbery before the windows. The back of the garage was visible from there and I viewed it dully, wondering what evil secret it held, and marveling at the trick of fate which had made me witness of an act in this gruesome drama.  \"Of course, Gatton,\" I said, \"we are all along assuming that Sir Marcus actually met his death in this house. We must remember that he may merely have been brought here after the crime.\"  \"Such a short period elapsed,\" replied the Inspector, \"between his leaving the New Avenue Theater and the approximate time of his death that it seems unlikely that he visited any intermediate spot.\"  \"But he may not have been in the crate when Bolton and I saw it.\"  \"I don't believe he was in the crate then,\" replied Gatton, \"but I think he was at the Red House nevertheless.\"  I stared at him with curiosity.  \"You mean that he was in the house at the time that the constable and I opened the garage?\"  \"I do. I think he was in that room where supper was laid for two.\"  \"Good God!\" I exclaimed; for there was something horrible in the idea of the man who now lay murdered having been in the house presumably alive, whilst Bolton and I had stood within forty yards of him; in the idea that it had lain in our power, except for those human limitations which rendered us ignorant of his presence, to have averted his fate, perhaps to have checked the remorseless movement of this elaborate murder machine which seemingly had been set up in the Red House.  \"Some one was here last night,\" declared Gatton suddenly, as we turned to leave the deserted room, \"after you and Bolton had gone. Everything incriminating the assassin has been removed. Looking at the matter judicially, it becomes quite evident that any one clever enough to have planned this crime could not possibly have been guilty of an act of such glaring stupidity as that of accidentally leaving a photograph planted upon the mantelpiece.\"  That this fact had presented itself to the Inspector with such a force of conviction raised a great load from my mind. It had all along been evident to me, but I had feared that to the official outlook of my"]]]
