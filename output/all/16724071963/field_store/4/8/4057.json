He was grateful to these kindly people, but down in his heart was a great longing for Farmer Brown's boy and _home_. He always felt this longing just a wee bit stronger when Blacky the Crow passed over and cawed.     CHAPTER XXII  FARMER BROWN'S BOY LOOKS IN VAIN      Loyalty is priceless and       Is neither sold nor bought.     Alas, how few who seem to know       Its value as they ought.      _Bowser the Hound._   As I have told you, Farmer Brown's boy had been all about the neighborhood asking at each farmhouse if anything had been seen of Bowser. Of course nothing had been seen of him, and so at last Farmer Brown's boy felt sure that something dreadful had happened to Bowser in the woods.  For several days he tramped through the Green Forest and up through the Old Pasture, looking for signs of Bowser. His heart was heavy, for you know Bowser was quite one of the family. He visited every place he could think of where he and Bowser had hunted together. He knew that by this time Bowser couldn't possibly be alive if he had been caught by a foot in a trap or had met with an accident in the woods. He had quite given up all hope of ever seeing Bowser alive again. But he did want to know just what had happened to him, and so he kept searching and searching.  One day Farmer Brown's boy heard that a strange dog had been found over in the next township. That afternoon he drove over there, his heart filled with great hope. But he had his long ride for nothing, for when he got there he found that the strange dog was not Bowser at all.  Meanwhile Old Man Coyote and Reddy Fox and Old Granny Fox had become very bold. They even came up around the henyard in broad daylight.  \"I believe you know something about what has become of Bowser,\" Farmer Brown's boy said, as he chased Old Man Coyote away one day. \"You certainly know that he isn't home, and I more than suspect that you know _why_ he isn't home. I certainly shall have to get another dog to teach you not to be so bold.\"  But somehow Farmer Brown's boy couldn't bring himself quite to taking such a step as getting a new dog. He felt that no other dog ever could take Bowser's place, and in spite of the fact that he thought he had given up all hope of ever seeing Bowser again, 'way down deep inside was something which, if it were not hope, was something enough like it to keep him from getting another dog in Bowser's place.  Whenever he went about away from home, he kept an eye out for dogs in the farmyards he passed. He did it without really thinking anything about it. He had given up hope of finding Bowser, yet he was always looking for him.     CHAPTER XXIII  BOWSER'S GREAT VOICE      To long for home when far away     Will rob of joy the brightest day.      _Bowser the Hound._   There is as much difference in the voices of dogs as in the voices of human beings. For that matter, this is true of many of the little people who wear fur. Bowser the Hound had a wonderful, deep, clear voice, a voice that could be heard a great distance. No one who knew it would ever mistake it for the voice of any other Hound.  As a rule, Bowser seldom used that great voice of his save when he was hunting some one. Then, when the scent was strong, he gave tongue so fast that you wondered how he had breath enough left to run. But now that he was a prisoner of kindness, in the home of the people who had taken him in when he had crept to their doorstep, Bowser sometimes bayed from sheer homesickness. When he was tied out in the yard, he would sometimes get to thinking of his home and long to see Farmer Brown and Mrs. Brown and especially his master, Farmer Brown's boy. Then, when he could stand it no longer, he would open his mouth and send his great voice rolling across to the woods with a tone of mournfulness which never had been there before.  But great as was Bowser's voice, and far as it would carry, there was none who knew him to hear it, save Blacky the Crow. You remember that Blacky knew just where Bowser was and often flew over that farmyard to make sure that Bowser was still there. So more than once Blacky heard Bowser's great voice with its mournful note, and understood it.  It troubled Blacky. Yes, Sir, it actually troubled Blacky. He knew just what was the matter with Bowser, but for the life of him he couldn't think of any way of helping Bowser. \"That dog is homesick,\" croaked Blacky, as he sat in the top of a tall tree, scratching his head as if he thought he might scratch an idea out of it. \"Of course he doesn't know how to get home, and if he tried he probably would get as badly lost as he was before. Anyway, they don't give him a chance to try. I can't lead Farmer Brown's boy over here because he doesn't understand my talk, and I don't understand his. There isn't a thing I can do but keep watch. I wish Bowser would stop barking. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Yes, Sir, it makes me feel uncomfortable. Old Man Coyote got Bowser into this trouble, and he ought to get him out again, but I don't suppose it is the least bit of use to ask him. It won't do any harm to try, anyway.\"  So Blacky started back for the Green Forest and the Old Pasture near Farmer Brown's to look for Old Man Coyote, and for a long time as he flew he could hear Bowser's voice with its note of homesickness and longing.     CHAPTER XXIV  BLACKY TRIES TO GET HELP      You'll find that nothing more worth while can be     Than helping others whose distress you see.      _Bowser the Hound._   On his way back to the Green Forest near Farmer Brown's home, Blacky the Crow kept a sharp watch for Old Man Coyote. But Old Man Coyote was nowhere to be seen, and it was too late to go look for him, because jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had already gone to bed behind the Purple Hills and the Black Shadows were hurrying towards the Green Forest.  Blacky never is out after dark. You might think that one with so black a coat would be fond of the Black Shadows, but it isn't so at all. The fact is, bold and impudent as Blacky the Crow is in daylight, he is afraid of the dark. He is quite as timid as anybody I know of in the dark. So Blacky always contrives to go to bed early and is securely hidden away in his secret roosting-place by the time the Black Shadows reach the edge of the Green Forest.  Perhaps it isn't quite fair to say that Blacky is afraid of the dark. It isn't the dark itself that Blacky fears, but it is one who is abroad in the dark. It is Hooty the Owl. Hooty would just as soon dine on Blacky the Crow as he would on any one else, and Blacky knows it.  The next morning, bright and early, Blacky flew over to the Old Pasture to the home of Old Man Coyote. Just as he got there he saw Old Man Coyote coming home from an all-night hunt. \"I hope you have had good hunting,\" said Blacky politely.  Old Man Coyote looked up at Blacky sharply. Blacky is polite only when he wants to get something. \"There was plenty of hunting, but little enough reward for it,\" replied Old Man Coyote. \"What brings you over here so early? I should suppose you would be looking for a breakfast.\"  Now Blacky the Crow is a very wise fellow. He knows when it is to be sly and crafty and when it is best to be frank and out-spoken. This was a time for the latter. \"I know where Bowser the Hound is,\" said Blacky. \"I saw him yesterday.\"  Old Man Coyote pricked up his ears and grinned. \"I thought he was dead,\" said he. \"It's a long time since we've heard from Bowser. Is he well?\"  \"Quite well,\" replied Blacky, \"but unhappy. He is homesick. I suspect that the trouble with Bowser is that he hasn't the least idea in which direction home lies. You enjoy running, so why not go with me to pay Bowser a visit and then lead him back home?\"  Old Man Coyote threw back his head and laughed in that crazy fashion of his till the very hills rang with the sound of his voice.     CHAPTER XXV  BLACKY CALLS ON REDDY FOX      Saying what you mean, and meaning what you say     Are matters quite as different as night is from the day.      _Bowser the Hound._   Blacky the Crow wasted no time with Old Man Coyote after he heard Old Man Coyote laugh. There was a note in that crazy laugh of Old Man Coyote's that told Blacky he might just as well talk to the rocks or the trees about helping Bowser the Hound. Old Man Coyote had led Bowser into his trouble, and it was quite clear that not only did he have no regrets, but he was actually glad that Bowser was not likely to return.  \"You're a hard-hearted old sinner,\" declared Blacky, as he prepared to fly in search of Reddy Fox.  Old Man Coyote grinned. \"It is every one for himself, you know,\" said he. \"Bowser would do his best to catch me if he had the chance. So if he is in trouble, he can stay there for all of me.\"  It didn't take Blacky long to find Reddy Fox. You see, it was so early in the morning that Reddy had not retired for his daily nap. Like Old Man Coyote, he was just returning from a night's hunt when Blacky arrived.  \"Hello, Reddy!\" exclaimed Blacky. \"You certainly are looking in mighty fine condition. That red coat of yours is the handsomest coat I've ever seen. If I had a coat like that I know I should be so swelled up with pride that I just wouldn't be able to see common folks. I'm glad you're not that way, Reddy. One of the things I like about you is the fact that you never allow your fine coat to make you proud. That is more than I can say for some folks I know.\"  Reddy Fox sat down with his big bushy tail curled around to keep his toes warm, cocked his head on one side, and looked up at Blacky the Crow as if he were trying to see right inside that black head to find out what was going on there.  \"Now what has that black scamp got in his mind,\" thought Reddy. \"He never pays compliments unless he wants something in return. That old black rascal has the smoothest tongue in the Green Forest. He hasn't come 'way over "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15168"],["title","Bowser the Hound (#7)"],["body","just to tell me that I have a handsome coat. He wouldn't fly over a fence to tell anybody that unless it was for a purpose.\"  Aloud he said, \"Good morning, Blacky. I suppose I must admit I have a fine coat. Perhaps I do look very fine, but if you could see under this red coat of mine, you would find mighty little meat on my ribs. To be quite honest, I am not feeling half as fine as I look. You lucky fellows who can fly and don't have to think about distances may be able to live well these days, but as for me, I've forgotten when last I had a good meal.\"     CHAPTER XXVI  RED WITS AND BLACK WITS      This fact you'll find is always so:     He's quick of wit who fools a Crow.      _Bowser the Hound._   There is no greater flatterer in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows than Blacky the Crow when he hopes to gain something thereby. His tongue is so smooth that it is a wonder it does not drip oil. He is crafty, is Blacky. But these same things are true of Reddy Fox. No one ever yet had a chance to accuse Reddy Fox of lacking in sharp wits. Mistakes he makes, as everybody does, but Reddy's wits are always keen and active.  Now Reddy knew perfectly well that Blacky wanted something of him, and this was why he was saying such pleasant things. Blacky the Crow knew that Reddy knew this thing, and that if he would make use of Reddy as he hoped to, he must contrive to keep Reddy wholly in the dark as to what he wanted done.  So as they sat there, Reddy Fox on the snow with his tail curled around his feet to keep them warm, and Blacky the Crow in the top of a little tree above Reddy's head, they were playing a sort of game. It was red wits against black wits. Reddy was trying to outguess Blacky, and Blacky was trying to outguess Reddy, and both were enjoying it. People with sharp wits always enjoy matching their wits against other sharp wits.  When Reddy Fox said that in spite of his fine appearance he had forgotten when last he had had a good meal, Blacky pretended to think he was joking. \"You surprise me,\" said he. \"Whatever is the matter with my good friend Reddy, that he goes hungry when he no longer has anything to fear from Bowser the Hound. By the way, I saw Bowser the other day.\"  At this, just for an instant, Reddy's eyes flew wide open. Then they half closed again until they were just two yellow slits. But quickly as he closed them, Blacky had seen that startled surprise. \"Yes,\" said Blacky, \"I saw Bowser the other day, or at least some one who looked just like him. Wouldn't you like to have him back here, Reddy?\"  \"Most decidedly no,\" replied Reddy with great promptness. \"A dog is a nuisance. He isn't of any use in the wide, wide world.\"  \"Not even to drive off Old Man Coyote?\" asked Blacky slyly, for he knew that more than once Bowser the Hound had helped Reddy out of trouble with Old Man Coyote.  Reddy pretended not to hear this. \"I don't believe you saw Bowser,\" said he. \"I don't believe anybody will ever see Bowser again. I hope not, anyway.\" And Blacky knew by the way Reddy said this that it would be quite useless to ask Reddy to help get Bowser home.     CHAPTER XXVII  THE ARTFULNESS OF BLACKY      Who runs in circles never gets far.      _Bowser the Hound._   To be artful is to be very clever. It is to do things in a way so clever that people will not see what you are really doing. No one can be more artful than Blacky the Crow when he sets out to be.  Blacky was smart enough not to let Reddy know that he was seeking Reddy's help for Bowser. He soon found out that Reddy would not knowingly help the least little bit, so he decided at once that the only thing for him to do was to get Reddy to help unsuspectingly. He changed the subject very abruptly.  \"How are the chickens at Farmer Brown's?\" inquired he.  Reddy looked up and grinned. \"They seem to be in just as good health as ever,\" said he, \"so far as I can judge. Farmer Brown's boy seems to be terribly suspicious. He locks them up at night so tight that not even Shadow the Weasel could get his nose inside that henhouse.\"  Blacky's eyes twinkled, but he took care that Reddy should not see them. \"Farmer Brown's boy is different from some folks I know,\" said he.  \"How's that?\" demanded Reddy Fox.  \"Why,\" replied Blacky, \"there is a certain farmyard I know of where the hens are not kept shut up at all in the daytime, but run around where they please. I see them every day when I am flying over. They certainly are fine-looking hens. I don't think I've ever seen fatter ones. Some of them are so fat they can hardly run.\"  As Reddy Fox listened, a look of eagerness crept into his eyes, and his mouth began to water. He just couldn't help it. \"Where did you say those hens are?\" he asked, trying to speak carelessly.  \"I didn't say,\" replied Blacky, turning his head aside to hide a grin. \"It is a long way from here, Reddy, so I don't believe you would really be interested.\"  \"That all depends,\" replied Reddy. \"I would go a long way if it were worth while. I don't suppose you noticed if there were any dogs about where those hens are?\"  Blacky pretended not to hear this. \"I've often thought,\" said he, \"of you and Mrs. Reddy as I have looked down at those fat hens. It is too bad that they are so far away.\"     CHAPTER XXVIII  REDDY FOX DREAMS OF CHICKENS      It's a poor watch-dog who sleeps with both eyes closed.      _Bowser the Hound._   Reddy Fox watched Blacky the Crow grow smaller and smaller until he was just a black speck in the distance. Finally he disappeared. Reddy looked very thoughtful. He looked that way because he _was_ thoughtful. In fact, Reddy was doing a lot of hard thinking. He was thinking about those chickens Blacky had told him of. The more he thought of them, the hungrier he grew. You see, Reddy had been having rather a hard time to get enough to eat.  \"Yes, Sir,\" said Reddy to himself, \"I would go a long, long distance to get a good plump hen. I wish I knew just where that farm is that that black rascal talked about. I wonder if he has gone that way now. If I were sure that he has, I would make a little journey in that direction myself. But I'm not sure. That black rascal flies all over the country. That farm may lie in the direction he has gone now, and it may be in quite the opposite direction. Somehow I've got to find out in just which direction it is.\"  Reddy yawned, for he had been out all night, and he was sleepy. He decided that the best thing he could do would be to get a good rest. One must always be fit if one is to get on in this life. The harder one must work, the more fit one should keep, and a proper amount of sleep is one of the most necessary things in keeping fit. So Reddy curled up to sleep.  Hardly had his eyes closed when he began to dream. You see, he had been thinking so hard about those fat hens, and he was so hungry for one of them, that right away he began to dream of fat hens. It was a beautiful dream. At least, it was a beautiful dream to Reddy. Fat hens were all about him. They were so fat that they could hardly walk. Not only were they fat, but they seemed to think that their one object in life was to fill the stomachs of hungry foxes, for they just stood about waiting to be caught.  Never in all his life had Reddy Fox known anything so wonderful as was that dream. There were no dogs to worry him. There were no hunters with dreadful guns. All he had to do was to reach out and help himself to as many fat hens as he wanted. He ate and ate and ate, all in his dream, you know, and when he could eat no more he started for home. When he started for home the fat hens that were left started along with him. He led a procession of fat hens straight over to his home in the Old Pasture.  Just imagine how Reddy felt when at last he awoke and there was not so much as a feather from a fat hen anywhere about, while his stomach fairly ached with emptiness.     CHAPTER XXIX  REDDY TRIES TO AROUSE BLACKY'S PITY      Trust a Fox only as far as you can see him, and lock the     chickens up before you do that.      _Bowser the Hound._   All the next night, as Reddy Fox hunted and hunted for something to eat, he kept thinking of that dream of fat hens, and he kept wondering how he could get Blacky the Crow to tell him just where that farm with fat hens was. Blacky on his part had spent a whole day wondering how he could induce Reddy Fox to make that long journey over to where Bowser the Hound was a prisoner of kindness. Blacky was smart enough to know that if he seemed too anxious for Reddy to make that long journey, Reddy would at once suspect something. He knew well enough that if Reddy had any idea that Bowser the Hound was over there, nothing would tempt him to make the trip.  Early the next morning, just as on the morning before, Blacky stopped over by Reddy's house. This time Reddy was already home. Actually he was waiting for Blacky, though he wouldn't have had Blacky know it for the world. As soon as he saw Blacky coming, he lay down on his doorstep and pretended not to see Blacky at all.  \"Good morning, Reddy,\" said Blacky, as he alighted in the top of a little tree close by.  Reddy raised his head as if it were all he could do to lift it. \"Good morning, Blacky,\" said he in a feeble voice.  Blacky looked at him sharply. \"What's the matter, Reddy?\" he demanded. \"You seem to be feeling badly.\"  Reddy sighed. It was a long, doleful sigh. \"I am feeling badly, Blacky,\" said he. \"I never felt worse in my life. The truth is I--I--I--\" Reddy paused.  \"You what?\" demanded Blacky, looking at Reddy more sharply than ever.  \"I am starving,\" said Reddy very feebly. \"I certainly shall starve to death unless I can find some way of getting at least one good meal soon. You have no idea, Blacky, how dreadful it is to be hungry all the time.\" Again Reddy sighed, and followed this with a second sigh and then a third sigh.  Blacky looked behind him so that Reddy might not see the twinkle in his eyes. For Blacky understood perfectly what"]]]
