But even the general public sees now that this was a barbarous and idiotic perversion of relative values. What is a little perishable timber, for which substitutes can be found elsewhere, compared with a grove of trees that will be the wonder and delight of generations? What is the fleeting but abominable gratification of destroying the harmless lizard-like Tuatera of New Zealand compared with the deep interest of preserving it as the last living vertebrate that takes us back to Primary times? What is the momentary gratification of wearing egret feathers compared with the certainty of soon destroying the herons that produce them altogether; or what can compensate for the vile cruelty done to mutilated parent birds and starving young, or the murder of Bradley, the bird warden when trying to protect them?   LETTERS  The following quotations from a few of the many and wholly unsolicited letters received are arranged in alphabetical order. They are strictly _verbatim_:  _Australia._ The Animals' Protection Society. F. Montagu Rothery, Esq., Secretary, 82 Pitt Street, Sydney, New South Wales.       Here in this State our _fauna_ and _flora_ are both rapidly      disappearing, there being so many agencies at work for their      destruction. It will soon be too late to save many of our      beautiful birds and animals, and I am anxious to bring      under notice your words for the preservation of animals by      a system of sanctuaries.  Dr. Robert Bell, late Chief Geologist, Geological Survey of Canada, who has made many explorations in Labrador and adjacent lands and waters, and who has always given special attention to the mammals, writes:       I approve very heartily of the plan. It will be a humane      thing to try to protect the animals and will be very      advantageous in every way. It will no doubt receive the      sympathy of all classes. There will, however, be some      difficulties to overcome and much work to be done before the      plan gets into successful operation.... As to the location      and dimensions of the sanctuary, the north side of the lower      St. Lawrence is the most suitable or only region left,      except where it is too far north to benefit the most of the      mammals and birds which we should try to preserve. It will      be desirable to reserve and protect as great a length of the      shore as possible, but perhaps enough will be found between      Bradore bay on the east and Great Mekattina island on the      west, or this might be extended to Natashkwan. To carry it      up to Mingan, it would become more and more difficult to      protect the coast the further up you come. Between Mekattina      island and Natashkwan, there are no attractive rivers to      tempt trespassers to go inland, those which exist being      difficult for canoe navigation....       The animals soon find out where they are safe and come to      live in even a small area. The Algonquin park is a case in      point. There the bears have increased immensely in a few      years and the less noticeable mammals and birds have also      increased very much. I know of a more conspicuous case of a      small area, on the Nelson river, where, owing to an      old-standing superstition of the Indians, the animals have      not been molested for a long period and they have become      much more numerous than elsewhere.... Everything that can be      killed is called Game. Most of it should be called animal      murder and should be discouraged.       The Sanctuary should be placed in charge of a committee of      naturalists. But zoologists are scarce in Canada and those      who have taken an interest in the animals might be included.      Faithful men to carry out their instructions I think can be      found.  The President of the Boone and Crockett Club, Major W. Austin Wadsworth, Geneseo, N.Y., wrote:       I wish to express officially the admiration of our Club for      your paper on Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador, because the      whole question of Game Refuges has been one of especial      interest to us and we have been identified with all      movements in that direction in this country.  Captain R.G. Boulton, R.N., retired, was engaged for many years on the Hydrographic Survey of the Lower St. Lawrence, the Gulf and Newfoundland. He says:       There is no doubt, as regards the conservation of _birds_,      that sea-birds, such as gulls, &c., &c., are useful \"aids to      navigation,\" by warning the mariner of the proximity of      land, on making the coast. On foggy shores, like those of      Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, they are especially      useful, and it is to the advantage of the voyaging public to      conserve what we have left. While carrying on the Survey of      Georgian bay, and North channel of lake Huron, 1883-1893,      the _Bayfield_, my surveying vessel, was more than once kept      off the rocks in the foggy weather which prevails in May and      June, by the chirping and warbling of land birds.  His Excellency the Right Hon. James Bryce, British Ambassador at Washington, who is a keen botanist and lover of the wilds, writes:       It is painfully interesting. One finds it hard to realize      that such wicked waste of the gifts of Providence, and such      horrible cruelty, should be going on in our time. You are      doing a great service in calling attention to them and I      heartily wish you success in your endeavours.  At a special meeting of the Board of Governors of the Camp-Fire Club of America, held on December 12th last, the following resolution was unanimously passed:       \"_Whereas_, the Camp-Fire Club of America desires to express      its interest in and endorsement of the plan for the      establishment of Bird and Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador,      outlined by Lieut.-Colonel William Wood in his address      before the Commission of Conservation delivered at Quebec,      in January, 1911;       \"We believe that the establishment of adequate sanctuaries      is one of the most potent factors in the conservation of our      rapidly disappearing wild life. The Camp-Fire Club of      America has taken, and is taking, an active part in the      movement for the establishment of such sanctuaries in      various places. We believe that such sanctuaries should be      established in Labrador in the near future, while an      abundance of undeveloped land is available and before the      wild life has been decimated to such an extent as to make      its preservation difficult;       \"_Be it therefore Resolved_, that the Secretary convey to      Colonel Wood the assurance of our hearty interest in and      approval of the plan to establish adequate animal      sanctuaries in Labrador, and our hope that such sanctuaries      will be established in the near future.\"  Dr. John M. Clarke, Director, Science Division, New York State Education Department, and a gentleman acquainted with the wild life of the gulf of St. Lawrence, writes:       I have taken much interest in reading your paper. It seems      to be based on an extraordinary acquaintance with the      situation.       Canada is blessed with many unique natural resorts of animal      life and I have been particularly impressed with the      invasions that have been made on the wonderful nesting      places of the waterfowl. In my repeated stays on the coast      of Gaspe and the islands of the Gulf, now running over a      dozen years, I have had my attention forced to the hideous      sacrifices of bird life that are constantly going on; for      example in the Magdalen islands with their extraordinary      array of shore birds. The great lagoons within the islands      afford ideal breeding conditions, and an extraordinary      attraction for the hunter as well.       My observation leads me to the conviction that the shooting      law is not in the least respected on these islands, except      perhaps by the residents themselves. In some cases the      outsider is obliged to wait for the fall migration of the      ducks and geese and so comes within the law, but there are      plenty of early migrants that arrive during the close      season, only to be quickly picked up by the summer hunter,      who realizes that he is too far away to incur the law's      force.       As far as the shore birds are concerned, it is not the      occasional hunter that does the real damage. The islands are      becoming widely known to students of birds, and it is the      bird student, the member of the Audubon Society, (in most      instances, I regret to say, men of my own country) who are      guilty of ruthless slaughter of the shore birds for their      skins, and particularly for their eggs; all this in the      protected season.       The situation is even worse on the Bird rocks. That is a      protected area and yet is subject to fearful attacks from      the egg hunters. I do not mean the commercial \"eggers,\" but      the member of the Audubon Society who has a collection of      birds' eggs and skins and wants duplicates in order to enter      into exchange with his colleagues. I met there on one of my      visits an American \"student\" who had taken 369 clutches of      eggs of each of the seven or more species of waterfowl there      breeding, thus destroying at one swoop upwards of two      thousand potential birds. It is no wonder that, with such a      hideous desecration of the rights of the birds, the      population of the Rocks is rapidly decreasing.       I believe the light-keeper is supposed to be a conservator      of the birds and to prevent such uncontrolled destruction;      but what can he do, a man who is practically exiled from the      rest of his race for the entire year, frozen in for six      months of the year? He is naturally so overjoyed at the      sight of a fellow creature from the big world outside as to      indulge"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15134"],["title","Supplement to Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador (#3)"],["body","im, whatever his collecting proclivities may be.      The eggs that are taken by the occasional sailor seem to me      to cut no figure at all in the actual diminution of the bird      life there. That is a slender thing compared with the      destruction caused by the bird students. It is a severe      indictment of the ornithologist that such statements as the      foregoing happen to be true.       Almost as remarkable for its number of waterfowl of the same      species is the roost on the east cliffs of Bonaventure      island. These have fortunately been rendered by Nature, thus      far, inaccessible and the bird men have not yet found a way      of getting among them. Yet, even so, there is constantly a      great deal of reckless shooting at the birds simply for the      sake of \"stirring them up.\" This place is not protected by      law, I believe, as a special reservation, but that might      easily be brought about if the matter were placed in the      hands of some responsible citizen residing on that island.       There is a happy situation in connection with the great      Percé rock at Percé, on the top of which the gulls and      cormorants have kept house for untold generations. These      birds are a constant temptation to the men with a gun, but      the Percé people are so attached to the birds that no one      would ever think of killing one, except the occasional      French fisherman who will eat a young gull when hard      pressed. Any attempt made by outsiders to use the birds as      targets is resented so strongly that even the cormorants are      let live.       Your address seems to me timely and extremely pertinent. I      hope your proposition may receive more than passing      attention and the suggestions therein be made effective, for      they certainly aim to maintain the natural attractions and      the natural resources of the country.  Mr. Napoleon A. Comeau, author of _Life and Sport on the North Shore_, and one who has had fifty years' practical experience within the Labrador area, writes from Godbout River, Que.:       I trust your good work will be crowned with success. A lot      of good has already been accomplished by the spreading of      literature on this subject by the Audubon Society, the      A.O.U. and others, but much remains to be accomplished. It      has always been my aim in this section to prevent wanton      destruction of all kinds and I am glad to say I have had      considerable success in educating our younger generation      here. Small birds of all kinds used to be wantonly killed by      boys, a thing I rarely see now--it was the same in the other      ways by men--but I must say that _real_ trappers or Indians      are not the worst by any means. These men will kill at all      times and seasons but only through necessity; strangers and      so-called sportsmen are generally the offenders. I have been      a trapper myself for years, a professional, but had been      taught never to kill wantonly.... Of course, much study and      care must be exercised in preserving species of birds and      animals from destruction, or else, as you say, mistakes may      be made. There are species of such that are destructive to      others when allowed to increase beyond certain limits, and      it takes a very short time to do that in some cases....      About three years ago, ruffed grouse were so scarce      everywhere that I have travelled hundreds of miles without      seeing one. They were protected by law, which no doubt did      much near the densely populated sections, but as far as our      coast was concerned did absolutely nothing because Indians      and trappers shot them on sight for food. Last year there      were a few seen here and there and all at once, during the      present season, there are thousands. Hundreds have been shot      and they are reported abundant all over. I imagine this must      be due to particularly favourable weather conditions and the      immense number of foxes trapped last winter. There is also      this fall, an extraordinary number of muskrats--they are      swarming everywhere, even in totally, unfavourable      localities, doing much damage in some places. What is the      cause of this? Presumably it must be through some cause      decreasing the number of their enemies. This is why I think      much care must be taken before any steps are taken to      protect certain species. Some still hold their own against      all odds.  His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, Governor General of Canada, acknowledged the receipt of the _Address_ from Balmoral Castle in September, granted an interview at Ottawa in December, and authorized the use of his name to show his sympathy with the movement.  Dr. W.T. Grenfell has a long and most intimate knowledge of the Atlantic Labrador. He writes:       The matters of animal preservation which interest me most      are: The rapid decline in numbers of harp seals which we      Northern people can get for our boots and clothing. This      food and clothing supply, formerly readily obtainable all      along the Labrador, helped greatly to maintain in comfort      our scattered population. It is scarcely now worth while      putting out seal nets. We attribute this to the destruction      of seals at the time of their whelping, by steamers which      are ever growing larger and more numerous. No mammal,      producing but one offspring can long survive this.       Along the Labrador coast east of the Canadian border, birds      are destroyed on sight and nests robbed wherever found. The      laws are a dead letter because there is no one to enforce      them.       There is great need also for scientific inquiry with regard      to the fisheries--the herring and mackerel are apparently      gone, the salmon are getting scarcer, and the cod fisheries      have been failing perceptibly these past years. Yet there is      no practical effort made to discover the reason and obviate      it.  On the 9th of September, 1911, Earl Grey made the following entry in the visitors' book at La Roche:       I desire to thank the provincial government of Quebec for      having given me the opportunity of visiting, as their guest,      the Laurentides National Park, and to acknowledge the great      pleasure which I have derived from all I have seen and      done.... I would also like to congratulate them on the      wisdom of their policy in establishing so large a reserve,      as a protection for various breeds of wild animals which      would otherwise be in danger of extinction, and as a place      of rest, refreshment, and recreation for those who love the      quiet of the wilds.  Mr. George Bird Grinnell, one of the greatest authorities in the world on the Indian and wild life of North America, writes:       I have recently read with extraordinary interest your      address, presented last January to the Commission of      Conservation....       I wish to offer you my personal thanks for the effective way      in which you have set forth the desirability of establishing      wild-life refuges in Labrador, and I trust that what you      have said will start a movement in Canada to carry out this      good project. It has long interested me to know that your      people and their officials seem much more farseeing than      those on this side of the line, and Canada's show of      national parks and reservations is far more creditable than      that of her neighbour to the south.  Dr. H. Mather Hare, who does on the Canadian Labrador what Dr. Grenfell does on the Newfoundland or Atlantic Labrador, and whose headquarters are at Harrington, where the first coast sanctuary ought to be established at the earliest possible moment, says:       May I make a suggestion? The fishermen coming here from Nova      Scotia and Newfoundland do not believe there is really a law      against egging and shooting. They say it is a put-up job by      the people living on the coast, because they want all the      eggs and birds themselves. This being the case, would it not      be a good idea to have a notice in several of the Nova      Scotia and Newfoundland papers warning the fishermen      against breaking the law, and in this way putting the      interdiction on a legal footing; so they may understand that      it is not a mere bluff on the part of the people living on      the coast. So far there has been nothing but talk, and      nothing official; no arrest made, etc., so one can hardly      blame them for the position they take, especially as they      have been doing the same thing for many years.       The notice should be very clear and penalties set forth      plainly.  Mr. W.T. Lindsay, M.E., who has travelled thousands of miles through Labrador, writes:       I have spent two summers in the north eastern wilderness of      Quebec and can fully appreciate your suggestions.       I take the liberty of sending you a copy of an \"interview\"      by the _Montreal Witness_ upon my return in 1909, by which      you will see that I am in accord with your views, _i.e._,      unless the Government takes immediate steps to protect the      wild animals in the Province of Quebec, many of them will      become extinct....       I would suggest that the Commission of Conservation make a      close investigation of the _ways and means_ of the fur      traders along the north shore, and I believe that official,      unbiassed and independent investigation will expose a very      peculiar state of affairs in connection with the      mal-conservation of game.  Mr. Clive Phillips-Wolley, the well known authority on big-game sport, writes from Koksilah, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada:       ... of course I agree with your views: we have in this      Province been doing our best to put them in practice with      the most excellent results. Dr. W.T. Hornaday stirred us up,      and, though we did not put our sanctuaries"]]]
