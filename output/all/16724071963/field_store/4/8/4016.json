The furniture, though old, threadbare, and dilapidated, was kept scrupulously clean, and arranged symmetrically. There were a few books on the table, which were always placed with mathematical exactitude, and a set of chairs, so placed as to give one mysteriously the impression that they were not meant to be sat upon. There was also a grate, which never had a fire in it, and was never without a paper ornament in it, the pink and white aspect of which caused one involuntarily to shudder.  But the great point, which was meant to afford the highest gratification to the beholder, was the chimney-piece. This spot was crowded to excess in every square inch of its area with ornaments, chiefly of earthenware, miscalled china, and shells. There were great white shells with pink interiors, and small brown shells with spotted backs. Then there were china cups and saucers, and china shepherds and shepherdesses, represented in the act of contemplating the heavens serenely, with their arms round each other's waists. There were also china dogs and cats, and a huge china cockatoo as a centre-piece; but there was not a single spot the size of a sixpence on which the captain could place his pipe or his tobacco-box!  \"We'll get these things cleared away,\" said Minnie, with a laugh, on observing the perplexed look with which the captain surveyed the chimney-piece, while the changes above referred to were being made in the parlour; \"we have no place ready to receive them just now, but I'll have them all put away to-morrow.\"  \"Thank'ee, lass,\" said the captain, as he set down the sea-chest and seated himself thereon; \"they're pretty enough to look at, d'ye see, but they're raither in the way just now, as my second mate once said of the rocks when we were cruising off the coast of Norway in search of a pilot.\"  The ornaments were, however, removed sooner than anyone had anticipated. The next trip that the captain made was for his hammock (he always slept in one), which was a long unwieldy bundle, like a gigantic bolster. He carried it into the parlour on his shoulder, and Minnie followed him.  \"Where shall I sling it, lass?\"  \"Here, perhaps,\" said Minnie.  The captain wheeled round as she spoke, and the end of the hammock swept the mantelpiece of all its ornaments, as completely as if the besom of destruction had passed over it.  \"Shiver my timbers!\" gasped the captain, awestruck by the hideous crash that followed.  \"You've shivered the ornaments at any rate,\" said Minnie, half-laughing and half-crying.  \"So I have, but no matter. Never say die so long's there a shot in the locker. There's as good fish in the sea as ever come out of it; so bear a hand, my girl, and help me to sling up the hammock.\"  The hammock was slung, the pipe of peace was smoked, and thus Captain Ogilvy was fairly installed in his sister's cottage.  It may, perhaps, be necessary to remind the reader that all this is a long digression; that the events just narrated occurred a few days before the return of Ruby, and that they have been recorded here in order to explain clearly the reason of the captain's appearance at the supper table of his sister, and the position which he occupied in the family.  When Ruby reached the gate of the small garden, Minnie had gone to the captain's room to see that it was properly prepared for his reception, and the captain himself was smoking his pipe close to the chimney, so that the smoke should ascend it.  The first glance through the window assured the youth that his mother was, as letters had represented her, much better in health than she used to be. She looked so quiet and peaceful, and so fragile withal, that Ruby did not dare to \"surprise her\" by a sudden entrance, as he had originally intended, so he tapped gently at the window, and drew back.  The captain laid down his pipe and went to the door.  \"What, Ruby!\" he exclaimed, in a hoarse whisper.  \"Hush, uncle! How is Minnie; where is she?\"  \"I think, lad,\" replied the captain in a tone of reproof, \"that you might have enquired for your mother first.\"  \"No need,\" said Ruby, pointing to the window; \"I _see_ that she is there and well, thanks be to God for that:--but Minnie?\"  \"She's well, too, boy, and in the house. But come, get inside. I'll explain, after.\"  This promise to \"explain\" was given in consequence of the great anxiety he, the captain, displayed to drag Ruby into the cottage.  The youth did not require much pressing, however. He no sooner heard that Minnie was well, than he sprang in, and was quickly at his mother's feet. Almost as quickly a fair vision appeared in the doorway of the inner room, and was clasped in the young sailor's arms with the most thorough disregard of appearances, not to mention propriety.  While this scene was enacting, the worthy captain was engaged in active proceedings, which at once amused and astonished his nephew, and the nature and cause of which shall be revealed in the next chapter.    CHAPTER VII  RUBY  IN  DIFFICULTIES  Having thrust his nephew into the cottage, Captain Ogilvy's first proceeding was to close the outer shutter of the window and fasten it securely on the inside. Then he locked, bolted, barred, and chained the outer door, after which he shut the kitchen door, and, in default of any other mode of securing it, placed against it a heavy table as a barricade.  Having thus secured the premises in front, he proceeded to fortify the rear, and, when this was accomplished to his satisfaction, he returned to the kitchen, sat down opposite the widow, and wiped his shining pate.  \"Why, uncle, are we going to stand out a siege that you take so much pains to lock up?\"  Ruby sat down on the floor at his mother's feet as he spoke, and Minnie sat down on a low stool beside him.  \"Maybe we are, lad,\" replied the captain; \"anyhow, it's always well to be ready--            'Ready, boys, ready,           We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again'.\"  \"Come uncle, explain yourself.\"  \"Explain myself, nephy? I can neither explain myself nor anybody else. D'ye know, Ruby, that you're a burglar?\"  \"Am I, uncle? Well, I confess that that's news.\"  \"Ay, but it's true though, at least the law in Arbroath says so, and if it catches you, it'll hang you as sure as a gun.\"  Here Captain Ogilvy explained to his nephew the nature of the crime that was committed on the night of his departure, the evidence of his guilt in the finding part of the plate in the garden, coupled with his sudden disappearance, and wound up by saying that he regarded him, Ruby, as being in a \"reg'lar fix\".  \"But surely,\" said Ruby, whose face became gradually graver as the case was unfolded to him, \"surely it must be easy to prove to the satisfaction of everyone that I had nothing whatever to do with this affair?\"  \"Easy to prove it!\" said the captain in an excited tone; \"wasn't you seen, just about the hour of the robbery, going stealthily down the street, by Big Swankie and Davy Spink, both of whom will swear to it.\"  \"Yes, but _you_ were with me, uncle.\"  \"Ay, so I was, and hard enough work I had to convince them that I had nothin' to do with it myself, but they saw that I couldn't jump a stone wall eight foot high to save my life, much less break into a house, and they got no further evidence to convict me, so they let me off; but it'll go hard with you, nephy, for Major Stewart described the men, and one o' them was a big strong feller, the description bein' as like you as two peas, only their faces was blackened, and the lantern threw the light all one way, so he didn't see them well. Then, the things found in our garden,--and the villains will haul me up as a witness against you, for, didn't I find them myself?\"  \"Very perplexing; what shall I do?\" said Ruby.  \"Clear out,\" cried the captain emphatically.  \"What! fly like a real criminal, just as I have returned home? Never. What say _you_, Minnie?\"  \"Stand your trial, Ruby. They cannot--they dare not--condemn the innocent.\"  \"And you, mother?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know what to say,\" replied Mrs. Brand, with a look of deep anxiety, as she passed her fingers through her son's hair, and kissed his brow. \"I have seen the innocent condemned and the guilty go free more than once in my life.\"  \"Nevertheless, mother, I will give myself up, and take my chance. To fly would be to give them reason to believe me guilty.\"  \"Give yourself up!\" exclaimed the captain, \"you'll do nothing of the sort. Come, lad, remember I'm an old man, and an uncle. I've got a plan in my head, which I think will keep you out of harm's way for a time. You see my old chronometer is but a poor one,--the worse of the wear, like its master,--and I've never been able to make out the exact time that we went aboard the _Termagant_ the night you went away. Now, can _you_ tell me what o'clock it was?\"  \"I can.\"  '\"Xactly?\"  \"Yes, exactly, for it happened that I was a little later than I promised, and the skipper pointed to his watch, as I came up the side, and jocularly shook his head at me. It was exactly eleven P.M.\"  \"Sure and sartin o' that?\" enquired the captain, earnestly.  \"Quite, and his watch must have been right, for the town-clock rung the hour at the same time.\"  \"Is that skipper alive?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Would he swear to that?\"  \"I think he would.\"  \"D'ye know where he is?\"  \"I do. He's on a voyage to the West Indies, and won't be home for two months, I believe.\"  \"Humph!\" said the captain, with a disappointed look. \"However, it can't be helped; but I see my way now to get you out o' this fix. You know, I suppose, that they're buildin' a lighthouse on the Bell Rock just now; well, the workmen go off to it for a month at a time, I believe, if not longer, and don't come ashore, and it's such a dangerous place, and troublesome to get to, that nobody almost ever goes out to it from this place, except those who have to do with it. Now, lad, you'll go down to the workyard the first thing in the mornin', before daylight, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15124"],["title","The Lighthouse (#8)"],["body","to go off to work at the Bell Rock. You'll keep all snug and quiet, and nobody'll be a bit the wiser. You'll be earnin' good wages, and in the meantime I'll set about gettin' things in trim to put you all square.\"  \"But I see many difficulties ahead,\" objected Ruby.  \"Of course ye do,\" retorted the captain. \"Did ye ever hear or see anything on this earth that hadn't rocks ahead o' some sort? It's our business to steer past 'em, lad, not to 'bout ship and steer away. But state yer difficulties.\"  \"Well, in the first place, I'm not a stonemason or a carpenter, and I suppose masons and carpenters are the men most wanted there.\"  \"Not at all, blacksmiths are wanted there,\" said the captain, \"and I know that you were trained to that work as a boy.\"  \"True, I can do somewhat with the hammer, but mayhap they won't engage me.\"  \"But they _will_ engage you, lad, for they are hard up for an assistant blacksmith just now, and I happen to be hand-and-glove with some o' the chief men of the yard, who'll be happy to take anyone recommended by me.\"  \"Well, uncle, but suppose I do go off to the rock, what chance have you of making things appear better than they are at present?\"  \"I'll explain that, lad. In the first place, Major Stewart is a gentleman, out-and-out, and will listen to the truth. He swears that the robbery took place at one o'clock in the mornin', for he looked at his watch and at the clock of the house, and heard it ring in the town, just as the thieves cleared off over the wall. Now, if I can get your old skipper to take a run here on his return from the West Indies, he'll swear that you was sailin' out to the North Sea _before twelve_, and that'll prove that you _couldn't_ have had nothin' to do with it, d'ye see?\"  \"It sounds well,\" said Ruby dubiously, \"but do you think the lawyers will see things in the light you do?\"  \"Hang the lawyers! d'ye think they will shut their eyes to _the truth?_\"  \"Perhaps they may, in which case they will hang _me_, and so prevent my taking your advice to hang _them_,\" said Ruby.  \"Well, well, but you agree to my plan?\" asked the captain.  \"Shall I agree, Minnie? it will separate me from you again for some time.\"  \"Yet it is necessary,\" answered Minnie, sadly; \"yes, I think you should agree to go.\"  \"Very well, then, that's settled,\" said Ruby, \"and now let us drop the subject, because I have other things to speak of; and if I must start before daylight my time with you will be short----\"  \"Come here a bit, nephy, I want to have a private word with 'ee in my cabin,\" said the captain, interrupting him, and going into his own room. Ruby rose and followed.  \"You haven't any----\"  The captain stopped, stroked his bald head, and looked perplexed.  \"Well, uncle?\"  \"Well, nephy, you haven't--in short, have ye got any money about you, lad?\"  \"Money? yes, a _little_; but why do you ask?\"  \"Well, the fact is, that your poor mother is hard up just now,\" said the captain earnestly, \"an' I've given her the last penny I have o' my own; but she's quite----\"  Ruby interrupted his uncle at this point with a boisterous laugh. At the same time he flung open the door and dragged the old man with gentle violence back to the kitchen.  \"Come here, uncle.\"  \"But, avast! nephy, I haven't told ye all yet.\"  \"Oh! don't bother me with such trifles just now,\" cried Ruby, thrusting his uncle into a chair and resuming his own seat at his mother's side; \"we'll speak of that at some other time; meanwhile let me talk to mother.  \"Minnie, dear,\" he continued, \"who keeps the cash here; you or mother?\"  \"Well, we keep it between us,\" said Minnie, smiling; \"your mother keeps it in her drawer and gives me the key when I want any, and I keep an account of it.\"  \"Ah! well, mother, I have a favour to ask of you before I go.\"  \"Well, Ruby?\"  \"It is that you will take care of my cash for me. I have got a goodish lot of it, and find it rather heavy to carry in my pockets--so, hold your apron steady and I'll give it to you.\"  Saying this he began to empty handful after handful of coppers into the old woman's apron; then, remarking that \"that was all the browns\", he began to place handful after handful of shillings and sixpences on the top of the pile until the copper was hid by silver.  The old lady, as usual when surprised, became speechless; the captain smiled and Minnie laughed, but when Ruby put his hand into another pocket and began to draw forth golden sovereigns, and pour them into his mother's lap, the captain became supremely amazed, the old woman laughed, and,--so strangely contradictory and unaccountable is human nature,--Minnie began to cry.  Poor girl! the tax upon her strength had been heavier than anyone knew, heavier than she could bear, and the sorrow of knowing, as she had come to know, that it was all in vain, and that her utmost efforts had failed to \"keep the wolf from the door\", had almost broken her down. Little wonder, then, that the sight of sudden and ample relief upset her altogether.  But her tears, being tears of joy, were soon and easily dried--all the more easily that it was Ruby who undertook to dry them.  Mrs. Brand sat up late that night, for there was much to tell and much to hear. After she had retired to rest the other three continued to hold converse together until grey dawn began to appear through the chinks in the window-shutters. Then the two men rose and went out, while Minnie laid her pretty little head on the pillow beside Mrs. Brand, and sought, and found, repose.    CHAPTER VIII  THE SCENE CHANGES--RUBY IS VULCANIZED  As Captain Ogilvy had predicted, Ruby was at once engaged as an assistant blacksmith on the Bell Rock. In fact, they were only too glad to get such a powerful, active young fellow into their service; and he was shipped off with all speed in the sloop _Smeaton_, with a few others who were going to replace some men who had become ill and were obliged to leave.  A light westerly breeze was blowing when they cast off the moorings of the sloop.  \"Goodbye, Ruby,\" said the captain, as he was about to step on the pier. \"Remember your promise, lad, to keep quiet, and don't try to get ashore, or be hold communication with anyone till you hear from me.\"  \"All right, uncle, I won't forget, and I'll make my mind easy, for I know that my case is left in good hands.\"  Three hours elapsed ere the _Smeaton_ drew near to the Bell Rock. During this time, Ruby kept aloof from his fellow-workmen, feeling disposed to indulge the sad thoughts which filled his mind. He sat down on the bulwarks, close to the main shrouds, and gazed back at the town as it became gradually less and less visible in the faint light of morning. Then he began to ponder his unfortunate circumstances, and tried to imagine how his uncle would set about clearing up his character and establishing his innocence; but, do what he would, Ruby could not keep his mind fixed for any length of time on any subject or line of thought, because of a vision of sweetness which it is useless to attempt to describe, and which was always accompanied by, and surrounded with, a golden halo.  At last the youth gave up the attempt to fix his thoughts, and allowed them to wander as they chose, seeing that they were resolved to do so whether he would or no. The moment these thoughts had the reins flung on their necks, and were allowed to go where they pleased, they refused, owing to some unaccountable species of perversity, to wander at all, but at once settled themselves comfortably down beside the vision with golden hair, and remained there.  This agreeable state of things was rudely broken in upon by the hoarse voice of the mate shouting--  \"Stand by to let go the anchor.\"  Then Ruby sprang on the deck and shook himself like a great mastiff, and resolved to devote himself, heart and soul, from that moment, to the work in which he was about to engage.  The scene that presented itself to our hero when he woke up from his dreams would have interested and excited a much less enthusiastic temperament than his.  The breeze had died away altogether, just as if, having wafted the _Smeaton_ to her anchorage, there were no further occasion for its services. The sea was therefore quite calm, and as there had only been light westerly winds for some time past, there was little or none of the swell that usually undulates the sea. One result of this was, that, being high water when the Smeaton arrived, there was no sign whatever of the presence of the famous Bell Rock. It lay sleeping nearly two fathoms below the sea, like a grim giant in repose, and not a ripple was there to tell of the presence of the mariner's enemy.  The sun was rising, and its slanting beams fell on the hulls of the vessels engaged in the service, which lay at anchor at a short distance from each other. These vessels, as we have said, were four in number, including the Smeaton. The others were the _Sir Joseph Banks_, a small schooner-rigged vessel; the _Patriot_, a little sloop; and the _Pharos_ lightship, a large clumsy-looking Dutch-built ship, fitted with three masts, at the top of which were the lanterns. It was intended that this vessel should do duty as a lightship until the lighthouse should be completed.  Besides these there were two large boats, used for landing stones and building materials on the rock.  These vessels lay floating almost motionless on the calm sea, and at first there was scarcely any noise aboard of them to indicate that they were tenanted by human beings, but when the sound of the _Smeaton's_ cable was heard there was a bustle aboard of each, and soon faces were seen looking inquisitively over the sides of the ships.  The _Smeaton's_ boat was lowered after the anchor was let go, and the new hands were transferred to the _Pharos_, which was destined to be their home for some time to come.  Just as they reached her the bell rang for breakfast, and when Ruby stepped upon the deck he found himself involved in all the bustle that ensues when men"]]]
