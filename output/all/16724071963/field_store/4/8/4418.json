[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],["title","New Latin Grammar (#3)"],["body"," a long vowel; as, māter, rēgnum, dīus.    b) if it contains a diphthong; as, causae, foedus.    c) if it contains a short vowel followed by x, z, or any two consonants   (except a mute with l or r); as, axis, gaza, restō.  2. A syllable is short, if it contains a short vowel followed by a vowel or by a single consonant; as, mea, amat.  3. Sometimes a syllable varies in quantity, _viz_. when its vowel is short and is followed by a mute with l or r, i.e. by pl, cl, tl; pr, cr, tr, etc.; as, ăgrī, volŭcris.[8] Such syllables are called _common_. In prose they were regularly short, but in verse they might be treated as long at the option of the poet.  NOTE.--These distinctions of _long_ and _short_ are not arbitrary and artificial, but are purely natural. Thus, a syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonants, as ng, is long, because such a syllable requires _more time_ for its pronunciation; while a syllable containing a short vowel followed by one consonant is short, because it takes _less time_ to pronounce it. In case of the common syllables, the mute and the liquid blend so easily as to produce a combination which takes no more time than a single consonant. Yet by separating the two elements (as ag-rī) the poets were able to use such syllables as long.  ACCENT.  6. 1. Words of two syllables are accented upon the first; as, tégit, mō´rem.  2. Words of more than two syllables are accented upon the penult (next to the last) if that is a long syllable, otherwise upon the antepenult (second from the last); as, amā´vī, amántis, míserum.  3. When the enclitics -que, -ne, -ve, -ce, -met, -dum are appended to words, if the syllable preceding the enclitic is long (either originally or as a result of adding the enclitic) it is accented; as, miserō´que, hominísque. But if the syllable still remains short after the enclitic has been added, it is not accented unless the word originally took the accent on the antepenult. Thus, pórtaque; but míseráque.  4. Sometimes the final -e of -ne and -ce disappears, but without affecting the accent; as, tantō´n, istī´c, illū´c.  5. In utră´que, _each_, and plēră´que, _most_, -que is not properly an enclitic; yet these words accent the penult, owing to the influence of their other cases,--utérque, utrúmque, plērúmque.  VOWEL CHANGES.[9]  7.. 1. In Compounds,    a) ĕ before a single consonant becomes ĭ; as,--      colligō     for con-legō.    b) ă before a single consonant becomes ĭ: as,--      adigō       for ad-agō.    c) ă before two consonants becomes ē; as,--      expers      for ex-pars.    d) ae becomes ī; as,--      conquīrō    for con-quaerō.    e) au becomes ū, sometimes ō; as,--      conclūdō    for con-claudō;     explōdō     for ex-plaudō.  2. Contraction. Concurrent vowels were frequently contracted into one long vowel. The first of the two vowels regularly prevailed; as,--    trēs      for tre-es;         cōpia     for co-opia;   mālō      for ma(v)elō;       cōgō      for co-agō;   amāstī    for amā(v)istī;     cōmō      for co-emō;   dēbeō     for dē(h)abeō;      jūnior    for ju(v)enior.   nīl       for nihil;  3. Parasitic Vowels. In the environment of liquids and nasals a parasitic vowel sometimes develops; as,--    vinculum for earlier vinclum.  So perīculum, saeculum.  4. Syncope. Sometimes a vowel drops out by syncope; as,--    ārdor for āridor (compare _āridus_);   valdē for validē (compare _validus_).  CONSONANT CHANGES[10]  8. 1. Rhotacism. An original s between vowels became r; as,--    arbōs, Gen. arboris (for arbosis);   genus, Gen. generis (for genesis);   dirimō (for dis-emō).  2. dt, tt, ts each give s or ss; as,--    pēnsum for pend-tum;   versum for vert-tum;   mīles for mīlet-s;   sessus for sedtus;   passus for pattus.  3. Final consonants were often omitted; as,--    cor for cord;   lac for lact.  4. Assimilation of Consonants. Consonants are often assimilated to a following sound. Thus: accurrō (adc-); aggerō (adg-); asserō (ads-); allātus (adl-); apportō (adp-); attulī (adt-); arrīdeō (adr-); afferō (adf-); occurrō (obc-); suppōnō (subp-); offerō (obf-); corruō (comr-); collātus (coml-); etc.  5. Partial Assimilation. Sometimes the assimilation is only partial. Thus:--    a) b before s or t becomes p; as,--      scrīpsī (scrīb-sī), scrīptum (scrīb-tum).    b) g before s or t becomes c; as,--      āctus (āg-tus).    c) m before a dental or guttural becomes n; as,--      eundem (eum-dem); prīnceps (prīm-ceps).  PECULIARITIES OF ORTHOGRAPHY.  9. Many words have variable orthography.  1. Sometimes the different forms belong to different periods of the language. Thus, quom, voltus, volnus, volt, etc., were the prevailing forms almost down to the Augustan age; after that, cum, vultus, vulnus, vult, etc. So optumus, maxumus, lubet, lubīdō, etc. down to about the same era; later, optimus, maximus, libet, libīdō, etc.  2. In some words the orthography varies at one and the same period of the language. Examples are exspectō, expectō; exsistō, existō; epistula, epistola; adulēscēns, adolēscēns; paulus, paullus; cottīdiē, cotīdiē; and, particularly, prepositional compounds, which often made a concession to the etymology in the spelling; as,--    ad-gerō or aggerō;            ad-serō or asserō;   ad-liciō or alliciō;          in-lātus or illātus;   ad-rogāns or arrogāns;        sub-moveō or summoveō;                        and many others.  3. Compounds of jaciō were usually written ēiciō, dēiciō, adiciō, obiciō, etc., but were probably pronounced as though written adjiciō, objiciō, etc.  4. Adjectives and nouns in -quus, -quum; -vus, -vum; -uus, -uum preserved the earlier forms in -quos, -quom; -vos, -vom; -uos, -uom, down through the Ciceronian age; as, antīquos, antīquom; saevos; perpetuos; equos; servos. Similarly verbs in the 3d plural present indicative exhibit the terminations -quont, -quontur; -vont, -vontur; -uont, -uontur, for the same period; as, relinquont, loquontur; vīvont, metuont.  The older spelling, while generally followed in editions of Plautus and Terence, has not yet been adopted in our prose texts.         *       *       *       *       *  PART II.         *       *       *       *       *  INFLECTIONS.         *       *       *       *       *  10. The Parts of Speech in Latin are the same as in English, viz. Nouns, Adjectives, Pronouns, Verbs, Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections; but the Latin has no article.  11. Of these eight parts of speech the first four are capable of Inflection, i.e. of undergoing change of form to express modifications of meaning. In case of Nouns, Adjectives, and Pronouns, this process is called Declension; in case of verbs, Conjugation.         *       *       *       *       *  CHAPTER I.--_Declension._  A. NOUNS.  12. A Noun is the name of a _person_, _place_, _thing_, or _quality_; as, Caesar, _Caesar_; Rōma, _Rome_; penna, _feather_; virtūs, _courage_.  1. Nouns are either Proper or Common. Proper nouns are permanent names of persons or places; as, Caesar, Rōma. Other nouns are Common: as, penna, virtūs.  2. Nouns are also distinguished as Concrete or Abstract.    a) Concrete nouns are those which designate individual objects; as, mōns,   _mountain_; pēs, _foot_; diēs, _day_; mēns, _mind_.    Under concrete nouns are included, also, collective nouns; as, legiō,   _legion_; comitātus, _retinue_.    b) Abstract nouns designate qualities; as, cōnstantia, _steadfastness_;   paupertās, _poverty_.  GENDER OF NOUNS.  13. There are three Genders,--Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter. Gender in Latin is either natural or grammatical.  Natural Gender.  14. The gender of nouns is natural when it is based upon sex. Natural gender is confined entirely to names of persons; and these are--  1. Masculine, if they denote males; as,--    nauta, _sailor_; agricola, _farmer_.  2. Feminine, if they denote females; as,--    māter, _mother_; rēgīna, _queen_.  Grammatical Gender.  15. Grammatical gender is determined not by sex, but by the general signification of the word, or the ending of its Nominative Singular. By grammatical gender, nouns denoting things or qualities are often Masculine or Feminine, simply by virtue of their signification or the ending of the Nominative Singular. The following are the general principles for determining grammatical gender:--  _A. Gender determined by Signification._  1. Names of _Rivers_, _Winds_, and _Months_ are Masculine; as,--    Sēquana, _Seine_; Eurus, _east wind_; Aprīlis, _April_.  2. Names of _Trees_, and such names of _Towns_ and _Islands_ as end in -us, are Feminine; as,--    quercus, _oak_; Corinthus, _Corinth_; Rhodus, _Rhodes_.  Other names of towns and islands follow the gender of their endings (see _B_, below); as,--    Delphī, n.; Leuctra, n.; Tībur, n.; Carthāgō, f.  3. Indeclinable nouns, also infinitives and phrases, are Neuter; as,--    nihil, _nothing_; nefās, _wrong_; amāre, _to love_.  NOTE.--Exceptions to the above principles sometimes occur; as, Allia (the river), f.  _B. Gender determined by Ending of Nominative Singular._  The gender of other nouns is determined by the ending of the Nominative Singular.[11]  NOTE 1.--_Common Gender._ Certain nouns are sometimes Masculine, sometimes Feminine. Thus, sacerdōs may mean either _priest_ or _priestess_, and is Masculine or Feminine accordingly. So also cīvis, _citizen_; parēns, _parent_; etc. The gender of such nouns is said to be _common_.  NOTE 2.--Names of animals usually have grammatical gender, according to the ending of the Nominative Singular, but the one form may designate either the male or female; as, ānser, m., _goose_ or _gander_. So vulpēs, f., _fox_; aquīla, f., _eagle_.  NUMBER.  16. The Latin has two Numbers,--the Singular and Plural. The Singular denotes one object, the Plural, more than one.  CASES.  17. There are six Cases in Latin:--    Nominative,     Case of Subject;   Genitive,       Objective with _of_, or Possessive;   Dative,         Objective with _to_ or _for_;   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],["title","New Latin Grammar (#4)"],["body","Accusative,     Case of Direct Object;   Vocative,       Case of Address;   Ablative,       Objective with _by_, _from_, _in_,                   _with_.  1. LOCATIVE. Vestiges of another case, the Locative (denoting place where), occur in names of towns and in a few other words.  2. OBLIQUE CASES. The Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and Ablative are called Oblique Cases.  3. STEM AND CASE-ENDINGS. The different cases are formed by appending certain case-endings to a fundamental part called the Stem.[12] Thus, _portam_ (Accusative Singular) is formed by adding the case-ending -m to the stem porta-. But in most cases the final vowel of the stem has coalesced so closely with the actual case-ending that the latter has become more or less obscured. The _apparent case-ending_ thus resulting is called a termination.  THE FIVE DECLENSIONS.  18. There are five Declensions in Latin, distinguished from each other by the final letter of the Stem, and also by the Termination of the Genitive Singular, as follows:--    DECLENSION.     FINAL LETTER OF STEM.   GEN. TERMINATION.   First           ā                       -ae   Second          ŏ                       -ī   Third           ĭ / Some consonant      -īs   Fourth          ŭ                       -ūs   Fifth           ē                       -ēī / -ĕī  Cases alike in Form.  19. 1. The Vocative is regularly like the Nominative, except in the singular of nouns in -us of the Second Declension.  2. The Dative and Ablative Plural are always alike.  3. In Neuters the Accusative and Nominative are always alike, and in the Plural end in -ă.  4. In the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Declensions, the Accusative Plural is regularly like the Nominative.         *       *       *       *       *  FIRST DECLENSION.  ā-Stems.  20. Pure Latin nouns of the First Declension regularly end, in the Nominative Singular, in -ă, weakened from -ā, and are of the Feminine Gender. They are declined as follows:--                     Porta, _gate_; stem, portā-.                              SINGULAR.        CASES.                 MEANINGS.            TERMINATIONS.   _Nom._  porta      _a gate_ (as subject)         -ă   _Gen._  portae     _of a gate_                   -ae   _Dat._  portae     _to_ or _for a gate_          -ae   _Acc._  portam     _a gate_ (as object)          -am   _Voc._  porta      _O gate!_                     -ă   _Abl._  portā      _with, by, from, in a gate_   -ā                               PLURAL.   _Nom._  portae     _gates_ (as subject)          -ae   _Gen._  portārum   _of gates_                    -ārum   _Dat._  portīs     _to_ or _for gates_           -īs   _Acc._  portās     _gates_ (as object)           -ās   _Voc._  portae     _O gates!_                    -ae   _Abl._  portīs     _with, by, from, in gates_    -īs  1. The Latin has no article, and porta may mean either _a gate_ or _the gate_; and in the Plural, _gates_ or _the gates_.  Peculiarities of Nouns of the First Declension.  21. 1. EXCEPTIONS IN GENDER. Nouns denoting males are Masculine; as, nauta, _sailor_; agricola, _farmer_; also, Hadria, _Adriatic Sea_.  2. Rare Case-Endings,--    a) An old form of the Genitive Singular in -ās is preserved in the   combination pater familiās, _father of a family_; also in māter familiās,   fīlius familiās, fīlia familiās. But the regular form of the Genitive in   -ae is also admissible in these expressions; as, pater familiae.    b) In poetry a Genitive in -āī also occurs; as, aulāī.    c) The Locative Singular ends in -ae; as, Rōmae, _at Rome_.    d) A Genitive Plural in -um instead of -ārum sometimes occurs; as,   Dardanidum instead of Dardanidārum. This termination -um is not a   contraction of -ārum, but represents an entirely different case-ending.    e) Instead of the regular ending -īs, we usually find -ābus in the Dative   and Ablative Plural of dea, _goddess_, and fīlia, _daughter_, especially   when it is important to distinguish these nouns from the corresponding   forms of deus, _god_, and fīlius, _son_. A few other words sometimes have   the same peculiarity; as, lībertābus (from līberta, _freedwoman_),   equābus (_mares_), to avoid confusion with lībertīs (from lībertus,   _freedman_) and equīs (from equus, _horse_).  Greek Nouns.  22. These end in -ē (Feminine); -ās and -ēs (Masculine). In the Plural they are declined like regular Latin nouns of the First Declension. In the Singular they are declined as follows:--            Archiās,           Epitomē,           Comētēs, _comet_.           _Archias_.         _epitome_.   _Nom._  Archiās            epitomē            comētēs   _Gen._  Archiae            epitomēs           comētae   _Dat._  Archiae            epitomae           comētae   _Acc._  Archiam (or -ān)   epitomēn           comētēn   _Voc._  Archiā             epitomē            comētē (or -ă)   _Abl._  Archiā             epitomē            comētē (or -ā)  1. But most Greek nouns in -ē become regular Latin nouns in -a, and are declined like porta; as, grammatica, _grammar_; mūsica, _music_; rhētorica, _rhetoric_.  2. Some other peculiarities occur, especially in poetry.         *       *       *       *       *  SECOND DECLENSION.  ŏ-Stems.  23. Pure Latin nouns of the Second Declension end in -us, -er, -ir, Masculine; -um, Neuter. Originally -us in the Nominative of the Masculine was -os; and -um of the Neuters -om. So also in the Accusative.  Nouns in -us and -um are declined as follows:--            Hortus, _garden_;    Bellum, _war_;           stem, hortŏ-.        stem, bellŏ-.

Note that in words of the type of puer and vir the final vowel of the stem has disappeared in the Nominative and Vocative Singular.  In the Nominative and Vocative Singular of ager, the stem is further modified by the development of e before r.  2. The following nouns in -er are declined like puer: adulter, _adulterer_; gener, _son-in-law_; Līber, _Bacchus_; socer, _father-in-law_; vesper, _evening_; and compounds in -fer and -ger, as signifer, armiger.  Nouns in _-vus_, _-vum_, _-quus_.  24. Nouns ending in the Nominative Singular in -vus, -vum, -quus, exhibited two types of inflection in the classical Latin,--an earlier and a later,--as follows:--     _Earlier Inflection (including Caesar and Cicero)._           Servos, m.,     Aevom, n.,      Equos, m.,           _slave_.        _age_.          _horse_.

The Plural of these nouns is regular, and always uniform.  Peculiarities of Inflection in the Second Declension.  25. 1. Proper names in -ius regularly form the Genitive Singular in -ī (instead of -iī), and the Vocative Singular in -ī (for -ie); as Vergílī, _of Virgil_, or _O Virgil_ (instead of Vergiliī, Vergilie). In such words the accent stands upon the penult, even though that be short. Nouns in -ajus, -ejus form the Gen. in -aī, -eī, as Pompejus, Pompeī.  2. Nouns in -ius and -ium, until after the beginning of the reign of Augustus (31 B.C.), regularly formed the Genitive Singular in -i (instead of -iī); as,--    _Nom._  ingenium        fīlius   _Gen._  ingénī          fīlī  These Genitives accent the penult, even when it is short.  3. Fīlius forms the Vocative Singular in -ī (for -ie); _viz_. fīlī, _O son!_  4. Deus, _god_, lacks the Vocative Singular. The Plural is inflected as follows:--    _Nom._  dī              (deī)   _Gen._  deōrum          (deum)   _Dat._  dīs             (deīs)   _Acc._  deōs   _Voc._  dī              (deī)   _Abl._  dīs             (deīs)  5. The Locative Singular ends in -ī; as, Corinthī, _at Corinth_.  6. The Genitive Plural has -um, instead of -ōrum,--    a) in words"]]]
