Raise the forefinger of the right hand, as the index or pointing finger.  3. Place the index finger upon the lower thumb joint of the left hand.  4. Draw the index finger down to the wrist, over the bone between the thumb knuckle and the wrist, and count \"One.\"  5. Place the index finger on the knuckle of the first finger.  6. Draw the index finger down to the wrist, over the bone leading from the first finger to the wrist, and count \"Two.\"  7. So on, for each of the three other bones of the hand. Repeat until no mistake is made in touching or counting.  II.  1. Raise the thumb, and place the index finger of the right hand on the middle of the upper part of the thumb for bone \"Six\"; then  2. On the lower part of the thumb for bone \"Seven.\" Repeat from the beginning, until the children can touch and count each bone properly.  III.  1. Keep the thumb erect; raise the first finger of the left hand.  2. Place the index finger on the bone between the tip and the first joint of the first finger for bone \"Eight.\"  3. Between the first and middle joint for bone \"Nine.\"  4. Between the middle and third joint for bone \"Ten.\" Review, from the beginning, until the class can touch and count every bone as directed.  IV.  1. Keep the thumb and forefinger erect; raise the second finger and touch, as in the lesson on the first finger bones, \"Eleven,\" \"Twelve,\" and \"Thirteen.\" Review.  2. Proceed in the same manner for the third and fourth fingers, always beginning with the bone nearest the tip of the finger, and touching that at the lowest part last.  If the exercise has been properly performed, every child will say \"Nineteen\" as its index finger touches the lowest bone of the little finger, and all the fingers of every left hand will be outspread.         *       *       *       *       *  THE BONES  OF THE HEAD: Skull                                      8 Face, including the lower jaw             14 Tongue                                     1 Ears                                       8                                         ----                                           31 OF THE TRUNK: Spine                                     24 Ribs                                      24 Breastbone                                 8 Shoulder blades                            2 Collar bones                               2                                         ----                                           60 OF THE UPPER LIMBS: Upper arms                         1 x 2 = 2 Fore-arms                          2 x 2 = 4 Wrists                            8 x 2 = 16 Hands                            19 x 2 = 38                                         ----                                           60 OF THE LOWER LIMBS: Thighs                             1 x 2 = 2 Knee-pans                          1 x 2 = 2 Lower legs                         2 x 2 = 4 Feet                             26 x 2 = 52                                         ----                                           60  Total, 211, not including the teeth.[1]  We teach the children to say \"about two hundred,\" because there is not always the same number of bones in the body. In some parts two or three bones unite and form one bone. For example: the breastbone of a child is made up of eight pieces; some of these unite as it becomes older, so that when fully grown it has but three pieces in this bone.  [1] The teeth are not bone, but a kind of soft, bone-like substance, called _dentine_. Common ivory is dentine.         *       *       *       *       *  PART IV.  FORMULAS FOR THE LESSONS ON THE ORGANS OF SENSE.  1. _The Eyes._--My eyes are to see with.  My eye is like a ball in a deep, bony socket. The black circle in the centre is the pupil or window of my eye; the colored ring is the iris or curtain; the white part is the eyeball.  My upper and lower eyelids cover and protect my eyes.

The drum of my ear is protected by a fence of short, stiff hairs, and by a bitter wax about the roots of these hairs.  3. _The Nose._--My nose is to smell and breathe with; it is in the middle of my face:    my two nostrils,   the bridge of my nose,   the cartilage,   the tip of my nose.  My nostrils lead to a passage back of my mouth through which I breathe.  The cartilage separates my nose into two parts.  4. _The Mouth._--My mouth is to speak, eat, and breathe through:    my upper lip,   my lower lip.  In my mouth are:    my tongue,   my lower teeth,   my upper teeth,   my lower teeth,   and my upper and lower jaws, covered with flesh called _gum_.  5. _The Teeth._--My teeth are used in eating and talking.  My teeth are made of a soft kind of bone, covered with enamel.  I have three kinds of teeth: cutting teeth, tearing teeth, grinding teeth.  A young child has twenty teeth, ten in each jaw.  A grown person has thirty-two teeth, sixteen in each jaw.  6. To preserve my teeth:    I must keep them clean.   I must not scratch the enamel.   I must not eat or drink anything very hot or very cold.   I must not use them for scissors or nut-crackers.   I must not burn them with tobacco or cigars.  7. _About Eating._--When I eat I move my lower jaw only.    My tongue brings the food between my teeth,   the cutters cut it,   the tearers tear it,   the grinders grind it,   the saliva moistens it,   and my tongue helps me to swallow it.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULAS.  1.

FORMULA FOR DESCRIPTION OF THE BONES.  1. My skull is formed of several bones united, like two saws with their toothed edges hooked into each other.  2. My spine extends from the base of the skull behind, down the middle of my back.  It is composed of twenty-four short bones, piled one upon the other, with cartilage between them.  These bones are fastened together, forming an upright and flexible column, which makes me erect and graceful.  3. My ribs are curved, strong, and light; there are twenty-four of them, twelve on each side; they are fastened at the back to my spine, in front to my breastbone, forming a hollow place for my heart, lungs, and stomach.  4. My shoulder blades are flat, thin, and like a triangle in shape; they are for my arms to rest upon.  5. My collar bones are fastened to my shoulder blades and my breastbone; they keep my arms from sliding too far forward.  6. The bones of old people are hard and brittle; those of children soft and flexible; so I must sit and stand erect, that mine may not be bent out of shape. I must not wear tight clothing, or do anything that will crowd them out of their places.  7. My bones are made from my food, after it has been changed into blood; so I must be careful to eat good, wholesome food, that they may be strong and healthy.  8. I must not breathe impure air, because impure air makes bad blood, and bad blood makes poor bones.  9. The body of every person is changing all the time, because the skin, flesh, and bones are always wearing out, and the blood is always repairing and building them again.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.  1. Tell about the skull.  2. Tell about the spine.  3. Tell about the ribs.  4. Tell about the shoulder blades.  5. Tell about the collar bones.  6. Tell about the difference between the bones of old people and those of children.  7. Of what are your bones made?  8. If you wish your bones to be strong, why should you not breathe impure air?  9. What have you learned about the change which is always taking place in the body?         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: THE JOINTS OF THE SKULL.]         *       *       *       *       *  A little girl was looking at some pictures of ladies in fashionable dresses.
