Towards night the fear of having no shelter made the two friends so dreadfully dismayed that the Fairy Tulip suddenly appeared before them.  [Illustration]  \"I am not going to scold you,\" she said, \"although it is through not following my advice that you are in this misfortune, for it goes to my heart to see you thus. I cannot release you altogether from this enchantment, but I have power to shorten the time, and also to say that during the night you may regain your rightful form, but by day again must you run through the forest as a Fawn.\" The fairy also told them where they could find a little hut in which to pass the nights. Then she disappeared. Giroflée and the Fawn walked in the direction the Fairy had pointed out, and arrived at a neat little cottage where an old woman showed them a room which they could occupy.  As soon as it was night Desirée came to her rightful form, but when day appeared she was once more a Fawn and, escaping into the thicket, commenced to run about in the ordinary way.  You have heard how Prince Guerrier rested in the forest while Bécafigue searched for fruit; quite late in the evening Bécafigue arrived at the cottage of the good woman who had given shelter to Giroflée and the White Fawn. He addressed her politely and asked for the things he required for his master. She hastened to fill a basket, and gave it to him, saying, \"I fear that if you pass a night without shelter some harm may come to you. I can offer you a poor one, but at any rate it is secure from the lions.\"  Bécafigue went back to the Prince and together they returned to the cottage, where they were led into the room next to that occupied by the Princess.  Next morning the Prince arose early and went out; he had not long been in the forest when he saw a beautiful little Fawn. Hunting had ever been his favourite pastime, and now he pursued the little creature. All day long hither and thither he chased, but did not succeed in capturing her, and as evening fell the Fawn slipped away and gained the little hut where Giroflée anxiously awaited her, and on hearing her adventure the Maid of Honour told her she must never again venture out, but the Princess replied:  \"It is no use talking thus, when I am a Fawn this room is stifling to me and I must depart from it.\"  The next day the young Prince sought in vain for the White Fawn, and finally tired out threw himself upon the grass and fell asleep.  While he lay there the little Fawn drew near and looking at him quietly, to her astonishment she recognised his features as those of the Prince Guerrier. Coming nearer and nearer she presently touched him and he awoke.  His surprise was great at seeing close by the shy little Fawn, who stayed not an instant longer but fled away, the Prince following.  \"Stay, dear little Fawn,\" he cried, \"I would not hurt you for the world.\" But the wind carried off the words before they reached her ears. Long he chased the poor creature, till at last worn out the Fawn sank down on the ground and the Prince came up to her.  \"Beautiful Fawn,\" said he, \"do not fear me, I shall lead you with me everywhere.\" Then he covered her with roses and fed her with the choicest leaves and grasses.  But as evening drew near the Fawn longed to escape, for what would happen should she suddenly change into a Princess there in the forest. Presently the Prince went to fetch some water for her, and while he was gone she ran homewards. The next day for a long time she hid from the Prince, but at last he found her, and as she dashed off he shot an arrow which wounded her in the leg.  Sad that he should have done so cruel a thing, the Prince took herbs and laid them upon the wound, and at last he went to fetch Bécafigue to help him carry her to the house. He tied her to a tree.  Alas! Who would have thought that the most beautiful Princess in the world would be treated thus? While she was straining at the ribbons trying to break them, Giroflée arrived, and was leading her away when the Prince met them and claimed the Fawn as his.  \"Sir,\" politely replied Giroflée, \"the Fawn was mine before it was yours,\" and she spoke to the Fawn, and the Fawn obeyed her in such a way that the Prince could not doubt that what she said was true. Giroflée then went on, and, to the surprise of the Prince and Bécafigue, entered the old woman's house where they themselves lodged. Then Bécafigue told the Prince that unless he was much mistaken the owner of the Fawn had lived with the Princess Desirée when he went there as ambassador.  \"I mean to see her again,\" said Bécafigue, \"there is only a partition between her room and ours.\" And soon he had made a hole large enough to peep through, and through it he saw the charming Princess dressed in a robe of brocaded silver, with flowers embroidered in gold and emeralds, her hair falling in heavy masses on the most beautiful neck in the world. Giroflée was on her knees before her, bandaging up one arm from which the blood was flowing. They both seemed greatly concerned about the wound: \"Let me die,\" the Princess was saying, \"death would be better than the life which I lead. To be a Fawn all the day, to hear him speaking, and not to be able to tell him of my sad fate.\"  One can guess the astonishment of Bécafigue and of the Prince. Guerrier would almost have died of pleasure had he not thought that it must be some enchantment, for did he not know that Desirée and her Lady in Waiting were shut up in the castle.  He went softly and knocked at the chamber door, which Giroflée opened, thinking it was the old woman, for she required help for the wounded arm.  The Prince entered, threw himself at Desirée's feet, and found she was indeed his Princess.  Great was their joy thus at last meeting, and while they were talking to each other the night passed, and the day dawned, and daylight came, and the morning sun shone brightly before Desirée had time to notice that she had not again taken the shape of a Fawn, but was her own beautiful self.  Then it was found that it was the Fairy Tulip in disguise of the old woman who had provided that sheltering cottage in the forest.  The joy of the King upon once more seeing his son can well be imagined, and the marriage of the Prince and Desirée, and Bécafigue and Giroflée took place on the same day, the Fairies giving their diamond palace as their wedding present to Princess Desirée, and Fairy Tulip presenting four gold mines in the Indies to Giroflée.  [Illustration]  And, in accordance with the wish of Princess Desirée, Longue Epine and her mother, the false Lady in Waiting, were set at liberty.  [Illustration]     HANSEL AND GRETHEL   Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood cutter, with his wife, and two children by his former marriage, a little boy called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel. He had little enough to break or bite; and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could hardly procure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed one night, he sighed, and said to his wife, \"What will become of us? How can we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat ourselves?\"  \"Know then, my husband,\" answered she, \"we will lead them away, quite early in the morning, into the thickest part of the wood, and there make them a fire, and give them each a little piece of bread, then we will go to our work, and leave them alone, so they will not find the way home again, and we shall be freed from them.\"  \"No, wife,\" replied he, \"that I can never do; how can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood; for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces?\"  \"Oh, you simpleton!\" said she, \"then we must all four die of hunger; you had better plane the coffins for us.\" But she left him no peace till he consented, saying, \"Ah, but I shall miss the poor children.\"  The two children, however, had not gone to sleep, for very hunger, and so they overheard what the stepmother said to their father. Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, \"What will become of us?\"  \"Be quiet, Grethel,\" said he; \"do not cry--I will help you.\" And as soon as their parents had gone to sleep, he got up, put on his coat, and, unbarring the back door, went out. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay before the door seemed like silver pieces, they glittered so brightly. Hansel stooped down, and put as many into his pocket as it would hold; and then going back he said to Grethel, \"Be of good cheer, dear sister, and sleep in peace; God will not forsake us.\" And so saying, he went to bed again.  The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the two children. \"Get up, you lazy things; we are going into the forest to chop wood.\" Then she gave them each a piece of bread, saying, \"There is something for your dinner; do not eat it before the time, for you will get nothing else.\" Grethel took the bread in her apron, for Hansel's pocket was full of pebbles; and so they all set out upon their way. When they had gone a little distance, Hansel stood still, and peeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till his father said, \"Hansel, what are you looking at, and why do you lag behind? Take care, and remember your legs.\"  \"Ah, father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house, and trying to say good-bye.\"  \"You simpleton!\" said the wife, \"that is not a cat; it is only the sun shining on the white chimney.\" But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time he stopped, he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path.  When they came to the middle of the forest, the father told the children to collect wood, and he would make them a fire, so that they should not be cold. So Hansel and Grethel gathered together quite a little mount of twigs. Then they set fire to them; and as the flame burnt up high, the wife said, \"Now, you children, lie down near the fire, and rest yourselves,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],["title","My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#8)"],["body","we go into the forest and chop more wood; when we are ready we will come and call you.\"  Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon, each ate the piece of bread; and because they could hear the blows of an axe they thought their father was near; but it was not an axe, but a branch which he had bound to an old tree, so as to be blown to and fro by the wind. They waited so long, that at last their eyes closed from weariness, and they fell fast asleep. When they awoke, it was quite dark, and Grethel began to cry. \"How shall we get out of the wood?\" But Hansel tried to comfort her by saying, \"Wait a little while till the moon rises, and then we will quickly find the way.\" The moon shone forth, and Hansel, taking his sister's hand, followed the pebbles, which glittered like new-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way. All night long they walked on, and as day broke they came to their father's house. They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, \"You wicked children! Why did you sleep so long in the wood? We thought you were never coming home again.\" But their father was extremely glad, for it had grieved his heart to leave them all alone.  [Illustration: \"HANSEL AND GRETHEL SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE.\"]  Not long afterwards there was again great scarcity in every corner of the land; and one night the children overheard their mother saying to their father, \"Everything is once more consumed; we have only half a loaf left, and then the song is ended: the children must be sent away. We will take them deeper into the wood, so that they may not find the way out again; it is the only means of escape for us.\"  But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, \"It were better to share the last crust with the children.\" His wife, however, would listen to nothing that he said, and scolded and reproached him without end.  He who says A must say B too; and he who consents the first time must also the second.  The children, however, had heard the conversation as they lay awake, and as soon as their parents went to sleep Hansel got up, intending to pick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, so that he could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying, \"Do not weep; sleep in quiet; the good God will not forsake us.\"  Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed, and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than the former piece. On the way Hansel broke his in his pocket, and stopping every now and then, dropped a crumb upon the path. \"Hansel, why do you stop and look about?\" said the father, \"keep in the path.\" \"I am looking at my little dove,\" answered Hansel, \"nodding a good-bye to me.\" \"Simpleton!\" said the wife, \"that is no dove, but only the sun shining on the chimney.\" But Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along.  The mother led the children deep into the wood, where they had never been before, and there making a gigantic fire, she said to them, \"Sit down here and rest, and when you feel tired you can sleep for a little while. We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening, when we are ready, we will come and fetch you again.\"  When noon came, Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn his on the path. They then went to sleep; but the evening arrived and no one came to visit the poor children, and in the dark night they awoke, and Hansel comforted his sister by saying, \"Only wait, Grethel, till the moon comes out, then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have dropped, and they will show us the way home.\" The moon shone and they got up, but they could not see any crumbs, for the thousands of birds which had been flying about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. Hansel kept saying to Grethel, \"We will soon find the way;\" but they did not, and they walked the whole night long and the next day, but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon the bushes. Soon they were so tired that they could not drag themselves along, then they lay down under a tree and again went to sleep.  [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_ HANSEL AND GRETHEL]  It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house, and they still walked on; but they only got deeper, and deeper, and deeper into the wood, and Hansel felt that if help did not come very soon they must die of hunger. As soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful, snow-white bird sitting upon a bough, singing so sweetly that they stood still and listened to it. It soon ceased, and spreading its wings flew off; and they followed it until it arrived at a cottage, upon the roof of which it perched; and when they went close up to it they saw that the cottage was made of bread and cakes, and the window-panes were of clear sugar.  \"We will go in here,\" said Hansel, \"and have a glorious feast. I will eat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the window. Will they not be sweet?\" So Hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof, in order to see how it tasted; while Grethel stepped up to the window and began to bite it. Then a sweet voice called out in the room, \"Tip-tap, tip-tap, who knocks at my door?\" and the children answered, \"The wind, the wind, the child of heaven;\" and they went on eating without interruption. Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so he tore off a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round pane out of the window, and sat down quite contentedly. Just then the door opened, and a very old woman, walking upon crutches, came out. Hansel and Grethel were so much frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands; but the old woman nodding her head, said, \"Ah, you dear children, what has brought you here? Come in and stop with me, and no harm shall come to you;\" and so saying she took them both by the hand, and led them into her cottage. A good meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples and nuts, was spread on the table, and in the back room were two nice little beds, covered with white, where Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down, and were happy as could be. The old woman behaved very kindly to them, but in reality she was a wicked old witch who way-laid children, and built the breadhouse in order to entice them in; but as soon as they were in her power she killed them, cooked and ate them, and made a great festival of the day. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see very far; but they have a fine sense of smelling, like wild beasts, so that they know when children approach them. When Hansel and Grethel came near the witch's house she laughed wickedly, saying, \"Here come two who shall not escape me.\" And early in the morning, before they awoke, she went up to them, and saw how lovingly they lay sleeping, with their chubby red cheeks; and she mumbled to herself, \"That will be a good bite.\" Then she took up Hansel with her rough hand, and shut him up in a little cage with a lattice-door; and although he screamed loudly it was of no use. Grethel came next, and shaking her till she awoke, she said, \"Get up, you lazy brat, and fetch some water to cook something good for your brother, who must remain in that stall and get fat; and when he is fat enough I shall eat him.\" Grethel began to cry, but it was all useless, for the old witch made her do as she wanted. So a nice meal was cooked for Hansel, but Grethel got nothing else but a crab's claw.  Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said, \"Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel whether you are getting fat.\" But Hansel used to stretch out a bone, and the old woman, having very bad sight, thought it was his finger, and wondered very much why he did not get fat. When four weeks had passed, and Hansel still kept quite lean, she lost all her patience, and would not wait any longer. \"Grethel,\" she cried in a passion, \"get some water quickly; be Hansel fat or lean, this morning I will kill and cook him.\" Oh, how the poor little sister grieved, as she was forced to fetch the water, and fast the tears ran down her cheeks! \"Dear good God, help us now!\" she prayed. \"Had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood, then we should have died together.\" But the old witch called out, \"Leave off that noise; it will not help you a bit.\"  So early in the morning Grethel was compelled to go out and fill the kettle, and make a fire. \"First, we will bake, however,\" said the old woman; \"I have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough;\" and so saying, she pushed poor Grethel up to the oven, out of which the flames were burning fiercely. \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is hot enough, and then we will put in the bread,\" but she intended when Grethel got in, to shut up the oven and let her bake, so that she might eat her as well as Hansel. Grethel perceived her wicked thoughts and said, \"I do not know how to do it; how shall I get in?\" \"You stupid goose,\" said she, \"the opening is big enough. See, I could even get in myself!\" and she got up, and put her head into the oven. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she fell right in, and shutting the iron door bolted it. Oh! how horribly the witch howled; but Grethel ran away, and left her to burn to ashes.  [Illustration]  Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening the door, called out, \"Hansel we are saved; the old witch is dead?\"  So he sprang out, like a bird from his cage when the door was opened; and they were so glad that they fell upon each other's neck, and kissed each other over and over again. And now, as there was nothing to fear, they went back to the witch's house, where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones. \"These are better than pebbles,\" said Hansel, putting as many into his pocket as it would hold; while Grethel thought, \"I will take some home too,\" and filled her apron full.  \"We must be off now,\" said Hansel, \"and"]]]
