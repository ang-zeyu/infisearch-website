DUBNOW  TRANSLATED FROM THE RUSSIAN BY I. FRIEDLAENDER   VOLUME II   FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER I. UNTIL THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER III. (1825-1894)   PHILADELPHIA THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA 5706--1946  Copyright 1918 by THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA      TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE   It was originally proposed to give the history of Russian Jewry after 1825--the year with which the first volume concludes--in a single volume. This, however, would have resulted in producing a volume of unwieldy dimensions, entirely out of proportion to the one preceding it. It has, therefore, become imperative to divide Dubnow's work into three, instead of into two, volumes. The second volume, which is herewith offered to the public, treats of the history of Russian Jewry from the death of Alexander I. (1825) until the death of Alexander III. (1894). The third and concluding volume will deal with the reign of Nicholas II., the last of the Romanovs, and will also contain the bibliographical apparatus, the maps, the index, and other supplementary material. This division will undoubtedly recommend itself to the reader. The next volume is partly in type, and will follow as soon as circumstances permit.  Of the three reigns described in the present volume, that of Alexander III., though by far the briefest, is treated at considerably greater length than the others. The reason for it is not far to seek. The events which occurred during the fourteen years of his reign laid their indelible impress upon Russian Jewry, and they have had a determining influence upon the growth and development of American Israel. The account of Alexander III.'s reign is introduced in the Russian original by a general characterization of the anti-Jewish policies of Russian Tzardom. Owing to the rearrangement of the material, to which reference was made in the preface to the first volume, this introduction, which would have interrupted the flow of the narrative, had to be omitted. But a few passages from it, written in the characteristic style of Mr. Dubnow, may find a place here:    Russian Tzardom began its consistent role as a persecutor of the   Eternal People when it received, by way of bequest, the vast Jewish   population of disintegrated Poland. At the end of the eighteenth   century, when Western Europe had just begun the emancipation of the   Jews, the latter were subjected in the East of Europe to every   possible medieval experiment.... The reign of Alexander II., who   slightly relieved the civil disfranchisement of the Jews by   permitting certain categories among them to live outside the Pale   and by a few other measures, forms a brief interlude in the Russian   policy of oppression. His tragic death in 1881 marks the beginning   of a new terrible reaction which has superimposed the system of   wholesale street pogroms upon the policy of disfranchisement, and   has again thrown millions of Jews into the dismal abyss of   medievalism.    Russia created a lurid antithesis to Jewish emancipation at a time   when the latter was consummated not only in Western Europe, but also   in the semi-civilized Balkan States.... True, the rise of Russian   Judaeophobia--the Russian technical term for Jew-hatred--was   paralleled by the appearance of German anti-Semitism in which it   found a congenial companion. Yet, the anti-Semitism of the West was   after all only a weak aftermath of the infantile disease of   Europe--the medieval Jew-hatred--whereas culturally retrograde   Russia was still suffering from the same infection in its acute,   \"childish\" form. The social and cultural anti-Semitism of the West   did not undermine the modern foundations of Jewish civil equality.   But Russian Judaeophobia, more governmental than social, being fully   in accord with the entire r√©gime of absolutism, produced a system   aiming not only at the disfranchisement, but also at the direct   physical annihilation of the Jewish people. The policy of the   extermination of Judaism was stamped upon the forehead of Russian   reaction, receiving various colors at various periods, assuming the   hue now of economic, now of national and religious, now of   bureaucratic oppression. The year 1881 marks the starting-point of   this systematic war against the Jews, which has continued until our   own days, and is bound to reach a crisis upon the termination of the   great world struggle.  Concerning the transcription of Slavonic names, the reader is referred to the explanations given in the preface to the first volume. The foot-notes added by the translator have been placed in square brackets. The poetic quotations by the author have been reproduced in English verse, the translation following both in content and form the original languages of the quotations as closely as possible. As in the case of the first volume, a number of editorial changes have become necessary. The material has been re-arranged and the headings have been supplied in accordance with the general plan of the work. A number of pages have been added, dealing with the attitude of the American people and Government toward the anti-Jewish persecutions in Russia. These additions will be found on pp. 292-296, pp. 394-396, and pp. 408-410. I am indebted to Dr. Cyrus Adler for his kindness in reading the proof of this part of the work.  The dates given in this volume are those of the Russian calendar, except for the cases in which the facts relate to happenings outside of Russia.  As in the first volume, the translator has been greatly assisted by the Hon. Mayer Sulzberger, who has read the proofs with his usual care and discrimination, and by Professor Alexander Marx, who has offered a number of valuable suggestions.  I.F.

Continued Humiliations and Death of Alexander III.             423     CHAPTER XIII   THE MILITARY DESPOTISM OF NICHOLAS I.  1. MILITARY SERVICE AS A MEANS OF DE-JUDAIZATION  The era of Nicholas I. was typically inaugurated by the bloody suppression of the Decembrists and their constitutional demands, [1] proving as it subsequently did one continuous triumph of military despotism over the liberal movements of the age. As for the emancipation of the Jews, it was entirely unthinkable in an empire which had become Europe's bulwark against the inroads of revolutionary or even moderately liberal tendencies. The new despotic regime, overflowing with aggressive energy, was bound to create, after its likeness, a novel method of dealing with the Jewish problem. Such a method was contrived by the iron will of the Russian autocrat.  [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 410, n. 1.]  Nicholas I., who was originally intended for a military career, was placed on the Russian throne by a whim of fate.[1] Prior to his accession, Nicholas had shown no interest in the Jewish problem. The Jewish masses had flitted across his vision but once--in 1816--when, still a young man, he traveled through Russia for his education. The impression produced upon him by this strange people is recorded by the then grand duke in his diary in a manner fully coincident with the official views of the Government:  [Footnote 1: After the death of Alexander I. the Russian crown fell to his eldest brother Constantine, military commander of Poland. Accordingly, Constantine was proclaimed emperor, and was recognized as such by Nicholas. Constantine, however, who had secretly abdicated some time previously, insisted on resigning, and Nicholas became Tzar.]    The ruin of the peasants of these provinces [1] are the Zhyds. [2] As   property-holders they are here second in importance to the landed   nobility. By their commercial pursuits they drain the strength of   the hapless White Russian people.... They are everything here:   merchants, contractors, saloon-keepers, mill-owners, ferry-holders,   artisans.... They are regular leeches, and suck these unfortunate   governments [3] to the point of exhaustion. It is a matter of   surprise that in 1812 they displayed exemplary loyalty to us and   assisted us wherever they could at the risk of their lives.  [Footnote 1: Nicholas is speaking of White Russia. Compare Vol. I, pp. 329 and 406.]  [Footnote 2: See on this term Vol. I, p. 320, n. 2.]  [Footnote 3: See on this term Vol. I, p. 308, n. 1.]  The characterization of merchants, artisans, mill-owners, and ferry-holders as \"leeches\" could only spring from a conception which looked upon the Jews as transient foreigners, who, by pursuing any line of endeavor, could only do so at the expense of the natives and thus abused the hospitality offered to them. No wonder then that the future Tzar was puzzled by the display of patriotic sentiments on the part of the Jewish population at the fatal juncture in the history of Russia.  This inimical view of the Jewish people was retained by Nicholas when he became the master of Russian-Jewish destinies. He regarded the Jews as an \"injurious element,\" which had no place in a Slavonic Greek-Orthodox monarchy, and which therefore ought to be combated. The Jews must be rendered innocuous, must be \"corrected\" and curbed by such energetic military methods as are in keeping with a form of government based upon the principles of stern tutelage and discipline. As a result of these considerations, a singular scheme was gradually maturing in the mind of the Tzar: to detach the Jews from Judaism by impressing them into a military service of a wholly exceptional character.  The plan of introducing personal military service, instead of the hitherto customary exemption tax, [1] had engaged the attention of the Russian Government towards the end of Alexander I's reign, and had caused a great deal of alarm among the Jewish communities. Nicholas I. was now resolved to carry this plan into effect. Not satisfied with imposing a civil obligation upon a people deprived of civil rights, the Tzar desired to use the Russian military service, a service marked by most extraordinary features, as an educational and disciplinary agency for his Jewish subjects: the barrack was to serve as a school, or rather as a factory, for producing a new generation of de-Judaized Jews, who were completely Russified, and, if possible, Christianized.  [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 318.]  The extension of the term of military service, marked by the ferocious discipline of that age, to a period of twenty-five years, the enrolment of immature lads or practically boys, their prolonged separation from a Jewish environment, and finally the employment of such methods as were likely to produce an immediate effect upon the recruits in the desired direction--all this was deemed an infallible means of dissolving Russian Jewry within the dominant nation, nay, within the dominant Church. It was a direct and simplified scheme which seemed to lead in a straight line to the goal. But had the ruling spheres of St. Petersburg known the history of the Jewish people, they might have realized that the annihilation of Judaism had in past ages been attempted more than once by other, no less forcible, means and that the attempt had always proved a failure.  In the very first year of the new reign, the plan of transforming the Jews by \"military\" methods was firmly settled in the emperor's mind. In 1826 Nichola instructed his ministers to draft a special statute of military service for the Jews, departing in some respects from the general law. In view of the fact that the new military reform was intended to include the Western region [1], which was under the military command of the Tzar's brother. Grand Duke Constantine [2], the draft was sent to him to Warsaw for further suggestions and approval, and was in turn transmitted by the grand duke to Senator Nicholas Novosiltzev, his co-regent [3], for investigation and report. As an experienced statesman, who had familiarized himself during his administrative activity with the Jewish conditions obtaining in the Western region, Novosiltzev realized the grave risks involved in the imperial scheme. In a memorandum submitted by him to the grand duke, he argued convincingly that the sudden imposition of military service upon the Jews was bound to cause an undesirable agitation among them, and that they should, on the contrary, be slowly \"prepared for such a radical transformation.\"  [Footnote 1: The official designation for the territories of Western Russia which were formerly a part of the Polish Empire.]  [Footnote 2: Constantine was appointed by his brother Alexander I, Commander-in-chief of the Polish army after the restoration of Poland in 1815. He remained in this post until his death in 1831. See also above, p. 13, n. 2.]  [Footnote 3: He was the imperial Russian Commissary in Warsaw, and was practically in control of the affairs in Poland. See below, p. 92 et seq.]  Novosiltzev was evidently well informed about the state of mind of the Jewish masses. No sooner had the rumor of the proposed ukase reached the Pale of Settlement than the Jews were "]]]
