You could take my place on the farm, and leave me free to enlist. I should have no hesitation in going. I have not forgotten that my grandfather fought at Bunker Hill.”  “I know, father,” said Frank, nodding; “and that's his musket that hangs up in your room, isn't it?”  “Yes; it was his faithful companion for three years. I often think with pride of his services. I have been trying to think all day whether I couldn't make some arrangement to have the farm carried on in my absence; but it is very hard to obtain a person in whom I could confide.”  “If I were as good a manager as some,” said Mrs. Frost, with a smile, “I would offer to be your farmer; but I am afraid that, though my intentions would be the best, things would go on badly under my administration.”  “You have enough to do in the house, Mary,” said her husband. “I should not wish you to undertake the additional responsibility, even if you were thoroughly competent. I am afraid I shall have to give up the idea of going.”  Mr. Frost took up the evening paper. Frank continued to look thoughtfully into the fire, as if revolving something in his mind. Finally he rose, and lighting a candle went up to bed. But he did not go to sleep for some time. A plan had occurred to him, and he was considering its feasibility.  “I think I could do it,” he said, at last, turning over and composing himself to sleep. “I'll speak to father the first thing to-morrow morning.”    CHAPTER IV. FRANK MAKES A PROPOSITION  When Frank woke the next morning the sun was shining into his window. He rubbed his eyes and tried to think what it was that occupied his mind the night before. It came to him in a moment, and jumping out of bed, he dressed himself with unusual expedition.  Hurrying down-stairs, he found his mother in the kitchen, busily engaged in getting breakfast.  “Where's father?” he asked.  “He hasn't come in from the barn yet, Frank,” his mother answered. “You can have your breakfast now, if you are in a hurry to get to studying.”  “Never mind, just now, mother,” returned Frank. “I want to speak to father about something.”  Taking his cap from the nail in the entry where it usually hung, Frank went out to the barn. He found that his father was nearly through milking.  “Is breakfast ready?” asked Mr. Frost, looking up. “Tell your mother she needn't wait for me.”  “It isn't ready yet,” said Frank. “I came out because I want to speak to you about something very particular.”  “Very well, Frank, Go on.”  “But if you don't think it a good plan, or think that I am foolish in speaking of it, don't say anything to anybody.”  Mr. Frost looked at Frank in some little curiosity.  “Perhaps,” he said, smiling, “like our neighbor Holman, you have formed a plan for bringing the war to a close.”  Frank laughed. “I am not quite so presumptuous,” he said. “You remember saying last night, that if I were old enough to take charge of the farm, you would have no hesitation in volunteering?”  “Yes.”  “Don't you think I am old enough?” asked Frank eagerly.  “Why, you are only fifteen, Frank,” returned his father, in surprise.  “I know it, but I am strong enough to do considerable work.”  “It isn't so much that which is required. A man could easily be found to do the hardest of the work. But somebody is needed who understands farming, and is qualified to give directions. How much do you know of that?”  “Not much at present,” answered Frank modestly, “but I think I could learn easily. Besides, there's Mr. Maynard, who is a good farmer, could advise me whenever I was in doubt, and you could write home directions in your letters.”  “That is true,” said Mr. Frost thoughtfully. “I will promise to give it careful consideration. But have you thought that you will be obliged to give up attending school.”  “Yes, father.”  “And, of course, that will put you back; your class-mates will get in advance of you.”  “I have thought of that, father, and I shall be very sorry for it. But I think that is one reason why I desire the plan.”  “I don't understand you, Frank,” said his father, a little puzzled.  “You see, father, it would require a sacrifice on my part, and I should feel glad to think I had an opportunity of making a sacrifice for the sake of my country.”  “That's the right spirit, Frank,” said his father approvingly. “That's the way my grandfather felt and acted, and it's the way I like to see my son feel. So it would be a great sacrifice to me to leave you all.”  “And to us to be parted from you, father,” said Frank.  “I have no doubt of it, my dear boy,” said his father kindly. “We have always been a happy and united family, and, please God, we always shall be. But this plan of yours requires consideration. I will talk it over with your mother and Mr. Maynard, and will then come to a decision.”  “I was afraid you would laugh at me,” said Frank.  “No,” said his father, “it was a noble thought, and does you credit. I shall feel that, whatever course I may think it wisest to adopt.”  The sound of a bell from the house reached them. This meant breakfast. Mr. Frost had finished milking, and with a well-filled pail in either hand, went toward the house.  “Move the milking:-stool, Frank,” he said, looking behind him, “or the cow will kick it over.”  Five minutes later they were at breakfast.  “I have some news for you, Mary,” said Mr. Frost, as he helped his wife to a sausage.  “Indeed?” said she, looking up inquiringly.  “Some one has offered to take charge of the farm for me, in case I wish to go out as a soldier.”  “Who is it?” asked Mrs. Frost, with strong interest.  “A gentleman with whom you are well--I may say intimately acquainted,”  was the smiling response.  “It isn't Mr. Maynard?”  “No. It is some one that lives nearer than he.”  “How can that be? He is our nearest neighbor.”  “Then you can't guess?”  “No. I am quite mystified.”  “Suppose I should say that it is your oldest son?”  “What, Frank?” exclaimed Mrs. Frost, turning from her husband to her son, whose flushed face indicated how anxious he was about his mother's favorable opinion.  “You have hit it.”  “You were not in earnest, Frank?” said Mrs. Frost inquiringly.  “Ask father.”  “I think he was. He certainly appeared to be.”  “But what does Frank know about farming?”  “I asked him that question myself. He admitted that he didn't know much at present, but thought that, with Mr. Maynard's advice, he might get along.”  Mrs. Frost was silent a moment. “It will be a great undertaking,” she said, at last; “but if you think you can trust Frank, I will do all I can to help him. I can't bear to think of having you go, yet I am conscious that this is a feeling which I have no right to indulge at the expense of my country.”  “Yes,” said her husband seriously. “I feel that I owe my country a service which I have no right to delegate to another, as long as I am able to discharge it myself. I shall reflect seriously upon Frank's proposition.”  There was no more said at this time. Both Frank and his parents felt that it was a serious matter, and not to be hastily decided.  After breakfast Frank went up-stairs, and before studying his Latin lesson, read over thoughtfully the following passage in his prize essay on “The Duties of American Boys at the Present Crisis:”  “Now that so large a number of our citizens have been withdrawn from their families and their ordinary business to engage in putting down this Rebellion, it becomes the duty of the boys to take their places as far as they are able to do so. A boy cannot wholly supply the place of a man, but he can do so in part. And where he is not called on to do this, he can so conduct himself that his friends who are absent may feel at ease about him. He ought to feel willing to give up some pleasures, if by so doing he can help to supply the places of those who are gone. If he does this voluntarily, and in the right spirit, he is just as patriotic as if he were a soldier in the field.”  “I didn't think,” thought Frank, “when I wrote this, how soon my words would come back to me. It isn't much to write the words. The thing is to stand by them. If father should decide to go, I will do my best, and then, when the Rebellion is over, I shall feel that I did something, even if It wasn't much, toward putting it down.”  Frank put his essay carefully away in a bureau drawer in which he kept his clothes, and, spreading open his Latin lexicon, proceeded to prepare his lesson in the third book of Virgil's Aeneid.    CHAPTER V. MR. RATHBURN MAKES A SPEECH  Frank's seat in the schoolroom was directly in front of that occupied by John Haynes. Until the announcement of the prize John and he had been on friendly terms. They belonged to the same class in Latin, and Frank had often helped his classmate through a difficult passage which he had not the patience to construe for himself. Now, however, a coolness grew up between them, originating with John. He felt envious of Frank's success; and this feeling brought with it a certain bitterness which found gratification in anything which he had reason to suppose would annoy Frank.  On the morning succeeding the distribution of the prizes, Frank arrived at the schoolhouse a few minutes before the bell rang. John, with half a dozen other boys, stood near the door.  John took off his hat with mock deference. “Make way for the great prize essayist, gentlemen!” he said. “The modern Macaulay is approaching.”  Frank colored with annoyance. John did not fail to notice this with pleasure. He was sorry, however, that none of the other boys seemed inclined to join in the demonstration. In fact, they liked Frank much the better of the two.  “That isn't quite fair, John,” said Frank, in a low voice.  “I am always glad to pay my homage to distinguished talent,” John"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1573"],["title","Frank's Campaign; Or, The Farm and the Camp (#4)"],["body",", in the same tone. “I feel how presumptuous I was in venturing to compete with a gentleman of such genius!”  “Do you mean to insult me?” asked Frank, growing angry.  “Oh, dear, no! I am only expressing my high opinion of your talents!”  “Let him alone, John!” said Dick Jones, “It isn't his fault that the teacher awarded the prize to him instead of you.”  “I hope you don't think I care for that!” said John, snapping his fingers. “He's welcome to his rubbishing books; they don't amount to much, anyway. I don't believe they cost more than two dollars at the most. If you'd like to see what I got for my essay, I'll show you.”  John pulled out his portemonnaie, and unrolled three new and crisp bank-notes of ten dollars each.  “I think that's pretty good pay,” he said, looking about him triumphantly. “I don't care how many prizes Rathburn chooses to give his favorite. I rather think I can get along without them.”  John's face was turned toward the door, otherwise he would have observed the approach of the teacher, and spoken with more caution. But it was too late. The words had been spoken above his ordinary voice, and were distinctly heard by the teacher. He looked sharply at John Haynes, whose glance fell before his, but without a word passed into the schoolroom.  “See if you don't get a blowing-up, John,” said Dick Jones.  “What do I care!” said John, but in a tone too subdued to be heard by any one else. “It won't do Rathburn any harm to hear the truth for once in his life.”  “Well, I'm glad I'm not in your place, that's all!” replied Dick.  “You're easily frightened!” rejoined John, with a sneer.  Nevertheless, as he entered the schoolroom, and walked with assumed bravado to his seat in the back part of the room, he did not feel quite so comfortable as he strove to appear. As he glanced stealthily at the face of the teacher, who looked unusually stern and grave, he could not help thinking, “I wonder whether he will say anything about it.”  Mr. Rathburn commenced in the usual manner; but after the devotional exercises were over, he paused, and, after a brief silence, during which those who had heard John's words listened with earnest attention, spoke as follows:  “As I approached the schoolroom this morning I chanced to catch some words which I presume were not intended for my ear. If I remember rightly they were, 'I don't care how many prizes Rathburn gives his favorite!' There were several that heard them, so that I can be easily corrected if I have made any mistake. Now I will not affect to misunderstand the charge conveyed by these words. I am accused of assigning the prizes, or at least, one of them, yesterday, not with strict regard to the merit of the essays presented, but under the influence of partiality. If this is the real feeling of the speaker, I can only say that I am sorry he should have so low an opinion of me. I do not believe the scholars generally entertain any such suspicion. Though I may err in judgment, I think that most of you will not charge me with anything more serious. If you ask me whether a teacher has favorites, I say that he cannot help having them. He cannot help making a difference between the studious on the one hand, and the indolent and neglectful on the other. But in a matter like this I ask you to believe me when I say that no consideration except that of merit is permitted to weigh. The boy who made this charge is one of my most advanced scholars, and has no reason to believe that he would be treated with unfairness. I do not choose to say any more on this subject, except that I have decided to offer two similar prizes for the two best compositions submitted within the next four weeks. I shall assign them to the best of my judgment, without regard to the scholarship of the writer.”  Mr. Rathburn spoke in a quiet, dignified manner, which convinced all who heard him of his fairness. I say all, because even John Haynes was persuaded against his own will, though he did not choose to acknowledge it. He had a dogged obstinacy which would not allow him to retract what he had once said. There was an unpleasant sneer on his face while the teacher was speaking, which he did not attempt to conceal.  “The class in Virgil,” called Mr. Rathburn.  This class consisted of Frank Frost, John Haynes, and Henry Tufts. John rose slowly from his seat, and advanced to the usual place, taking care to stand as far from Frank as possible.  “You may commence, John,” said the teacher.  It was unfortunate for John that he had been occupied, first, by thoughts of his rejected essay, and afterward by thoughts of the boat which he proposed to buy with the thirty dollars of which he had become possessed, so that he had found very little time to devote to his Latin. Had he been on good terms with Frank, he would have asked him to read over the lesson, which, as he was naturally quick, would have enabled him to get off passably. But, of course, under the circumstances, this was not to be thought of. So he stumbled through two or three sentences, in an embarrassed manner. Mr. Rathburn at first helped him along. Finding, however, that he knew little or nothing of the lesson, he quietly requested Frank to read, saying, “You don't seem so well prepared as usual, John.”  Frank translated fluently and well, his recitation forming a very favorable contrast to the slipshod attempt of John. This John, in a spirit of unreasonableness, magnified into a grave offense, and a desire to “show off” at his expense.  “Trying to shine at my expense,” he muttered. “Well, let him! Two or three years hence, when I am in college, perhaps things may be a little different.”  Frank noticed his repellent look, and it made him feel uncomfortable. He was a warm-hearted boy, and wanted to be on good terms with everybody. Still, he could not help feeling that in the present instance he had nothing to reproach himself with.  John went back to his seat feeling an increased irritation against Frank. He could not help seeing that he was more popular with his schoolmates than himself, and, of course, this, too, he considered a just cause of offense against him.  While he was considering in what way he could slight Frank, the thought of the boat he was about to purchase entered his mind. He brightened up at once, for this suggested something. He knew how much boys like going out upon the water. At present there was no boat on the pond. His would hold six or eight boys readily. He would invite some of the oldest boys to accompany him on his first trip, carefully omitting Frank Frost. The slight would be still more pointed because Frank was his classmate.  When the bell rang for recess he lost no time in carrying out the scheme he had thought of.  “Dick,” he called out to Dick Jones, “I am expecting my boat up from Boston next Tuesday, and I mean to go out in her Wednesday afternoon. Wouldn't you like to go with me?”  “With all the pleasure in life,” said Dick, “and thank you for the invitation.”  “How many will she hold?”  “Eight or ten, I expect. Bob Ingalls, would you like to go, too?”  The invitation was eagerly accepted. John next approached Henry Tufts, who was speaking with Frank Frost.  Without even looking at the latter, he asked Henry if he would like to go.  “Very much,” was the reply.  “Then I will expect you,” he said. He turned on his heel and walked off without taking any notice of Frank.  Frank blushed in spite of himself.  “Don't he mean to invite you?” asked Henry, in surprise.  “It appears not,” said Frank.  “It's mean in him, then,” exclaimed Henry; “I declare, I've a great mind not to go.”  “I hope you will go,” said Frank hastily. “You will enjoy it. Promise me you will go.”  “Would you really prefer to have me?”  “I should be very sorry if you didn't.”  “Then I'll go; but I think he's mean in not asking you, for all that.”    CHAPTER VI. MR. FROST MAKES UP HIS MIND  “Well, Frank,” said his father at supper-time, “I've been speaking to Mr. Maynard this afternoon about your plan.”  “What did he say?” asked Frank, dropping his knife and fork in his eagerness.  “After he had thought a little, he spoke of it favorably. He said that, being too old to go himself, he should be glad to do anything in his power to facilitate my going, if I thought it my duty to do so.”  “Didn't he think Frank rather young for such an undertaking?” asked Mrs. Frost doubtfully.  “Yes, he did; but still he thought with proper advice and competent assistance he might get along. For the first, he can depend upon Mr. Maynard and myself; as for the second, Mr. Maynard suggested a good man, who is seeking a situation as farm laborer.”  “Is it anybody in this town?” asked Frank.  “No, it is a man from Brandon, named Jacob Carter. Mr. Maynard says he is honest, industrious, and used to working on a farm. I shall write to him this evening.”  “Then you have decided to go!” exclaimed Frank and his mother in concert.  “It will depend in part upon the answer I receive from this man Carter. I shall feel if he agrees to come, that I can go with less anxiety.”  “How we shall miss you!” said his wife, in a subdued tone.  “And I shall miss you quite as much. It will be a considerable sacrifice for all of us. But when my country has need of me, you will feel that I cannot honorably stay at home. As for Frank, he may regard me as his substitute.”  “My substitute!” repeated Frank, in a questioning tone.  “Yes, since but for you, taking charge of the farm in my absence, I should not feel that I could go.”  Frank looked pleased. It made him feel that he was really of some importance. Boys, unless they are incorrigibly idle, are glad to be placed in posts of responsibility. Frank, though very modest, felt within himself unused powers and undeveloped capacities, which he knew must be called out by the unusual circumstances in which he would be placed. The thought, too, that he would be serving his country, even at home, filled him with satisfaction.  After a pause, Mr. Frost "]]]
