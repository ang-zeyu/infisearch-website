I. _Of the Point of a sharp small Needle._  As in _Geometry_, the most natural way of beginning is from a Mathematical _point_; so is the same method in Observations and _Natural history_ the most genuine, simple, and instructive. We must first endevour to make _letters_, and draw _single_ strokes true, before we venture to write whole _Sentences_, or to draw large _Pictures_. And in _Physical_ Enquiries, we must endevour to follow Nature in the more _plain_ and _easie_ ways she treads in the most _simple_ and _uncompounded bodies_, to trace her steps, and be acquainted with her manner of walking there, before we venture our selves into the multitude of _meanders_ she has in _bodies of a more complicated_ nature; lest, being unable to distinguish and judge of our way, we quickly lose both _Nature_ our Guide, and _our selves_ too, and are left to wander in the _labyrinth_ of groundless opinions; wanting both _judgment_, that _light_, and _experience_, that _clew_, which should direct our proceedings.  We will begin these our Inquiries therefore with the Observations of Bodies of the most _simple nature_ first, and so gradually proceed to those of a more _compounded_ one. In prosecution of which method, we shall begin with a _Physical point_; of which kind the _Point of a Needle_ is commonly reckon’d for one; and is indeed, for the most part, made so sharp, that the naked eye cannot distinguish any parts of it: It very easily pierces, and makes its way through all kind of bodies softer then it self: But if view’d with a very good _Microscope_, we may find that the _top_ of a Needle (though as to the sense very _sharp_) appears a _broad_, _blunt_, and very _irregular_ end; not resembling a Cone, as is imagin’d, but onely a piece of a tapering body, with a great part of the top remov’d, or deficient. The Points of Pins are yet more blunt, and the Points of the most curious Mathematical Instruments do very seldome arrive at so great a sharpness; how much therefore can be built upon demonstrations made onely by the productions of the Ruler and Compasses, he will be better able to consider that shall but view those _points_ and _lines_ with a _Microscope_.  Now though this point be commonly accounted the sharpest (whence when we would express the sharpness of a point the most _superlatively_, we say, As sharp as a Needle) yet the _Microscope_ can afford us hundreds of Instances of Points many thousand times sharper: such as those of the _hairs_, and _bristles_, and _claws_ of multitudes of _Insects_; the _thorns_, or _crooks_, or _hairs_ of _leaves_, and other small vegetables; nay, the ends of the _stiriæ_ or small _parallelipipeds_ of _Amianthus_, and _alumen plumosum_; of many of which, though the Points are so sharp as not to be visible, though view’d with a _Microscope_ (which magnifies the Object, in bulk, above a million of times) yet I doubt not, but were we able _practically_ to make _Microscopes_ according to the _theory_ of them, we might find hills, and dales, and pores, and a sufficient bredth, or expansion, to give all those parts elbow-room, even in the blunt top of the very Point of any of these so very sharp bodies. For certainly the _quantity_ or extension of any body may be _Divisible in infinitum_, though perhaps not the _matter_.  But to proceed: The Image we have here exhibited in the first Figure[1], was the top of a small and very sharp Needle, whose point _aa_ nevertheless appear’d through the _Microscope_ above a quarter of an inch broad, not round nor flat, but _irregular_ and _uneven_; so that it seem’d to have been big enough to have afforded a hundred armed Mites room enough to be rang’d by each other without endangering the breaking one anothers necks, by being thrust off on either side. The surface of which, though appearing to the naked eye very smooth, could not nevertheless hide a multitude of holes and scratches and ruggednesses from being discover’d by the _Microscope_ to invest it, several of which inequalities (as A, B, C, seem’d _holes_ made by some small specks of _Rust_; and D some _adventitious body_, that stuck very close to it) were _casual_. All the rest that roughen the surface, were onely so many marks of the rudeness and bungling of _Art_. So unaccurate is it, in all its productions, even in those which seem most neat, that if examin’d with an organ more acute then that by which they were made, the more we see of their _shape_, the less appearance will there be of their _beauty_: whereas in the works of _Nature_, the deepest Discoveries shew us the greatest Excellencies. An evident Argument, that he that was the Author of all these things, was no other then _Omnipotent_; being able to include as great a variety of parts and contrivances in the yet smallest Discernable Point, as in those vaster bodies (which comparatively are called also Points) such as the _Earth_, _Sun_, or _Planets_. Nor need it seem strange that the Earth it self may be by an _Analogie_ call’d a Physical Point: For as its body, though now so near us as to fill our eys and fancies with a sense of the vastness of it, may by a little Distance, and some convenient _Diminishing_ Glasses, be made vanish into a scarce visible Speck, or Point (as I have often try’d on the _Moon_, and (when not too bright) on the _Sun_ it self.) So, could a Mechanical contrivance succesfully answer our _Theory_, we might see the least spot as big as the Earth it self; and Discover, as _Des Cartes_[2] also conjectures, as great a variety of bodies in the _Moon_, or _Planets_, as in the _Earth_.  But leaving these Discoveries to future Industries, we shall proceed to add one Observation more of a _point_ commonly so call’d, that is, the mark of a _full stop_, or _period_. And for this purpose I observed many both _printed_ ones and _written_; and among multitudes I found _few_ of them more _round_ or _regular_ then this which I have delineated in the third figure of the second Scheme, but _very many_ abundantly _more disfigur’d_; and for the most part if they seem’d equally round to the eye, I found those points that had been made by a _Copper-plate_, and Roll-press, to be as misshapen as those which had been made with _Types_, the most curious and smothly _engraven strokes_ and _points_, looking but as so many _furrows_ and _holes_, and their _printed impressions_, but like _smutty daubings_ on a matt or uneven floor with a blunt extinguisht brand or stick’s end. And as for _points_ made with a _pen_ they were much _more ragged_ and _deformed_. Nay, having view’d certain pieces of exceeding curious writing of the kind (one of which in the bredth of a _two-pence_ compris’d _the Lords prayer, the Apostles Creed, the ten Commandments, and about half a dozen verses besides of the Bible_, whose _lines_ were _so small_ and _near together_, that I was unable to _number_ them with my _naked eye_,) a very ordinary _Microscope_, I had then about me, inabled me to see that what the Writer of it had asserted was _true_, but withall discover’d of what pitifull _bungling scribbles_ and _scrawls_ it was compos’d, _Arabian_ and _China characters_ being almost as well shap’d, yet thus much I must say for the Man, that it was for the most part _legible_ enough, though in some places there wanted a good _fantsy_ well _preposest_ to help one through. If this manner _of small writing_ were made _easie_ and _practicable_ (and I think I know such a one, but have never yet made tryal of it, whereby one might be inabled to write _a great deale_ with _much ease_, and _accurately_ enough in a very _little roome_) it might be of very good use to convey _secret Intelligence_ without any danger of _Discovery_ or _mistrusting_. But to come again to the point. The _Irregularities_ of it are caused by three or four _coadjutors_, one of which is, the _uneven surface_ of the _paper_, which at best appears no smother then a very course piece of _shag’d cloth_, next the _irregularity of the Type_ or _Ingraving_, and a third is the _rough Daubing_ of the _Printing-Ink_ that lies upon the instrument that makes the impression, to all which, add the _variation_ made by the Different _lights_ and _shadows_, and you may have sufficient reason to ghess that a _point_ may appear much more _ugly_ then _this_, which I have here presented, which though it appear’d through the _Microscope_ _gray_, like a great splatch of _London_ dirt, about three inches over; yet to the _naked eye_ it was _black_ and no bigger then that in the midst of the Circle A. And could I have found Room in this Plate to have inserted an O you should have seen that the _letters_ were not more distinct then the _points_ of Distinction, nor a _drawn circle_ more exactly _so_, then we have now shown a _point_ to be a _point_.         *       *       *       *       *   Observ. II. _Of the Edge of a Razor._  The sharpest _Edge_ hath the same kind of affinity to the sharpest _Point_ in Physicks, as a _line_ hath to a _point_ in Mathematicks; and therefore the Treaty concerning this, may very properly be annexed to the former. A Razor doth appear to be a Body of a very neat and curious aspect, till more closely viewed by the _Microscope_, and there we may observe its very Edge to be of all kind of shapes, except what it should be. For examining that of a very sharp one, I could not find that any part of it had any thing of sharpness in it; but it appeared a rough surface of a very considerable bredth from side to side, the narrowest part not seeming thinner then the back of a pretty thick Knife. Nor is’t likely that it should appear any otherwise, since as we just now shew’d that a _point_ appear’d a _circle_, ’tis rational a _line_ should be a _parallelogram_.  Now for the drawing this second Figure[3] (which represents a part of the Edge about half a quarter of an inch long of a Razor well set) I so plac’d it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15493"],["title","The Lancashire Witches: A Romance of Pendle Forest (#0)"],["body","Team.

CHAPTER I.--THE BEACON ON PENDLE HILL.   There were eight watchers by the beacon on Pendle Hill in Lancashire. Two were stationed on either side of the north-eastern extremity of the mountain. One looked over the castled heights of Clithero; the woody eminences of Bowland; the bleak ridges of Thornley; the broad moors of Bleasdale; the Trough of Bolland, and Wolf Crag; and even brought within his ken the black fells overhanging Lancaster. The other tracked the stream called Pendle Water, almost from its source amid the neighbouring hills, and followed its windings through the leafless forest, until it united its waters to those of the Calder, and swept on in swifter and clearer current, to wash the base of Whalley Abbey. But the watcher's survey did not stop here. Noting the sharp spire of Burnley Church, relieved against the rounded masses of timber constituting Townley Park; as well as the entrance of the gloomy mountain gorge, known as the Grange of Cliviger; his far-reaching gaze passed over Todmorden, and settled upon the distant summits of Blackstone Edge.  Dreary was the prospect on all sides. Black moor, bleak fell, straggling forest, intersected with sullen streams as black as ink, with here and there a small tarn, or moss-pool, with waters of the same hue--these constituted the chief features of the scene. The whole district was barren and thinly-populated. Of towns, only Clithero, Colne, and Burnley--the latter little more than a village--were in view. In the valleys there were a few hamlets and scattered cottages, and on the uplands an occasional \"booth,\" as the hut of the herdsman was termed; but of more important mansions there were only six, as Merley, Twistleton, Alcancoats, Saxfeld, Ightenhill, and Gawthorpe. The \"vaccaries\" for the cattle, of which the herdsmen had the care, and the \"lawnds,\" or parks within the forest, appertaining to some of the halls before mentioned, offered the only evidences of cultivation. All else was heathy waste, morass, and wood.  Still, in the eye of the sportsman--and the Lancashire gentlemen of the sixteenth century were keen lovers of sport--the country had a strong interest. Pendle forest abounded with game. Grouse, plover, and bittern were found upon its moors; woodcock and snipe on its marshes; mallard, teal, and widgeon upon its pools. In its chases ranged herds of deer, protected by the terrible forest-laws, then in full force: and the hardier huntsman might follow the wolf to his lair in the mountains; might spear the boar in the oaken glades, or the otter on the river's brink; might unearth the badger or the fox, or smite the fierce cat-a-mountain with a quarrel from his bow. A nobler victim sometimes, also, awaited him in the shape of a wild mountain bull, a denizen of the forest, and a remnant of the herds that had once browsed upon the hills, but which had almost all been captured, and removed to stock the park of the Abbot of Whalley. The streams and pools were full of fish: the stately heron frequented the meres; and on the craggy heights built the kite, the falcon, and the kingly eagle.  There were eight watchers by the beacon. Two stood apart from the others, looking to the right and the left of the hill. Both were armed with swords and arquebuses, and wore steel caps and coats of buff. Their sleeves were embroidered with the five wounds of Christ, encircling the name of Jesus--the badge of the Pilgrimage of Grace. Between them, on the verge of the mountain, was planted a great banner, displaying a silver cross, the chalice, and the Host, together with an ecclesiastical figure, but wearing a helmet instead of a mitre, and holding a sword in place of a crosier, with the unoccupied hand pointing to the two towers of a monastic structure, as if to intimate that he was armed for its defence. This figure, as the device beneath it showed, represented John Paslew, Abbot of Whalley, or, as he styled himself in his military capacity, Earl of Poverty.  There were eight watchers by the beacon. Two have been described. Of the other six, two were stout herdsmen carrying crooks, and holding a couple of mules, and a richly-caparisoned war-horse by the bridle. Near them stood a broad-shouldered, athletic young man, with the fresh complexion, curling brown hair, light eyes, and open Saxon countenance, best seen in his native county of Lancaster. He wore a Lincoln-green tunic, with a bugle suspended from the shoulder by a silken cord; and a silver plate engraved with the three luces, the ensign of the Abbot of Whalley, hung by a chain from his neck. A hunting knife was in his girdle, and an eagle's plume in his cap, and he leaned upon the but-end of a crossbow, regarding three persons who stood together by a peat fire, on the sheltered side of the beacon. Two of these were elderly men, in the white gowns and scapularies of Cistertian monks, doubtless from Whalley, as the abbey belonged to that order. The third and last, and evidently their superior, was a tall man in a riding dress, wrapped in a long mantle of black velvet, trimmed with minever, and displaying the same badges as those upon the sleeves of the sentinels, only wrought in richer material. His features were strongly marked and stern, and bore traces of age; but his eye was bright, and his carriage erect and dignified.  The beacon, near which the watchers stood, consisted of a vast pile of logs of timber, heaped upon a circular range of stones, with openings to admit air, and having the centre filled with fagots, and other quickly combustible materials. Torches were placed near at hand, so that the pile could be lighted on the instant.  The watch was held one afternoon at the latter end of November, 1536. In that year had arisen a formidable rebellion in the northern counties of England, the members of which, while engaging to respect the person of the king, Henry VIII., and his issue, bound themselves by solemn oath to accomplish the restoration of Papal supremacy throughout the realm, and the restitution of religious establishments and lands to their late ejected possessors. They bound themselves, also, to punish the enemies of the Romish church, and suppress heresy. From its religious character the insurrection assumed the name of the Pilgrimage of Grace, and numbered among its adherents all who had not embraced the new doctrines in Yorkshire and Lancashire. That such an outbreak should occur on the suppression of the monasteries, was not marvellous. The desecration and spoliation of so many sacred structures--the destruction of shrines and images long regarded with veneration--the ejection of so many ecclesiastics, renowned for hospitality and revered for piety and learning--the violence and rapacity of the commissioners appointed by the Vicar-General Cromwell to carry out these severe measures--all these outrages were regarded by the people with abhorrence, and disposed them to aid the sufferers in resistance. As yet the wealthier monasteries in the north had been spared, and it was to preserve them from the greedy hands of the visiters, Doctors Lee and Layton, that the insurrection had been undertaken. A simultaneous rising took place in Lincolnshire, headed by Makarel, Abbot of Barlings, but it was speedily quelled by the vigour and skill of the Duke of Suffolk,"]]]
