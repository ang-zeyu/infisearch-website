But at that instant Fido Flip-Flop, who had been jumping about, keeping out of the way of the fox that was after him, cried out quite loudly:  \"Look here, everybody but Uncle Wiggily, and, as for you, shut both your eyes tight.\"  Now the old gentleman rabbit couldn't imagine why he was to shut his eyes tight, but he did so, and then what do you s'pose Fido Flip-Flop did? Why, he began turning somersaults so fast that he looked just like a pinwheel going around, or an automobile tire whizzing along. Faster and faster did Fido Flip-Flop turn around, and then, all of a sudden, he began chasing his tail, making motions just like a merry-go-round in a circus, until those two foxes were fairly dizzy from watching him.  \"Stop! Stop!\" cried one fox.  \"Yes do stop! We're so dizzy that we can't stand up!\" cried the other fox, staggering about. \"Stop!\"  \"No, I'll not!\" answered Fido Flip-Flop, and he went around faster that ever, faster and faster and faster, until those two bad foxes got so dizzy-izzy that they fell right over on their backs, with their legs sticking straight up in the air like clothes posts, and their tails were wiggling back and forth in the dirt, like dusting brushes. Oh, but they were the dizzy foxes, though.  \"Now's your chance! Run! Run! Uncle Wiggily! Run!\" called Fido Flip-Flop \"Open your eyes and run!\"  So the old gentleman rabbit opened his eyes, took up his valise which he had dropped, and, hopping on his crutch, he and the poodle doggie ran on through the woods, leaving the two surprised and disappointed foxes still lying on their backs, wiggling their tails in the dust, and too dizzy, from having watched Fido Flip-Flop do somersaults, and chase his tail, to be able to get up.  \"Why did you want me to shut my eyes?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, when they were so far away from the foxes that there was no more danger.  \"That was so _you_ wouldn't get dizzy from watching me do the flip-flops,\" answered the doggie. \"My, but that was a narrow escape, though. Have you had many adventures like that since you started out to seek your fortune?\"  \"Yes, several,\" answered the rabbit. \"But turning flip-flops is a very good thing to know how to do. I wonder if you could teach me, so that when any more foxes or alligators chase me I can make them dizzy by turning around? Can you teach me?\"  \"I'm sure I can,\" said Fido. \"Here, this is the way to begin,\" and he did some flip-flops slow and easy-like. Then Uncle Wiggily tried them, and, though he couldn't do them very well at first, he practised until he was quite good at it. Then Fido showed him how to stand on one ear, and wiggle the other, and how to blink his eyes while standing on the end of his little tail, and then Uncle Wiggily thought of a new trick, all by himself.  \"I'll stick my crutch in the ground, like a clothes pole,\" he said to Fido, \"and then I'll hop up on it and sing a song,\" which he did, singing a song that went like this:      \"Did you ever see a rabbit        Do a flipper-flopper-flap?      If not just kindly watch me,        As I wear my baseball cap.      \"It's very strange, some folks may say,        And also rather funny,      To see a kinky poodle dog        Play with a flip-flop bunny.      \"But we are on our travels,        Adventures for to seek,      We may find one, or two, or three,        'Most any day next week.\"  And then Uncle Wiggily hopped down, and waved both ears backward and forward, and made a low bow to a make-believe crowd of people, only, of course, there were none there.  \"Fine! Fine!\" cried Fido Flip-Flop. \"That's better than I did when I was in the circus. Now I'll tell you what let's do.\"  \"What?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"Let's go around and give little shows and entertainments, for little folks to see,\" went on the poodle doggie. \"I can turn flip-flops, and you can stand on your head on your crutch, and sing a song, and then we'll take up a collection. I'll pass my hat, and perhaps we may make our fortune--who knows?\"  \"Who, indeed?\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"We'll do it.\"  So off they started together to give a little show, and make some money, and, as they went on through the woods, they practised doing the tricks Uncle Wiggily had learned.  Well, in a little while, not so very long, they came to a nice place in the forest--an open place where no trees grew.  \"Here is a good spot for our show,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"But there is no one to see us do the tricks,\" objected Fido.  \"Oh, yes, there are some ants, and an angle worm, and a black bug and a grasshopper,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"They will do to start on, and after they see us do the tricks they'll tell other folks, and we'll have quite a crowd.\"  So they started in to do their tricks. Fido turned a lot of flip-flops, and Uncle Wiggily did a dance on the end of his crutch, and sang a song about a monkey-doodle, which the angle worm said was just fine, being quite cute, and the grasshopper made believe play a fiddle with his two hind legs, scratching one on the other, and making lovely music.  But, all of a sudden, just as Uncle Wiggily was standing on his left ear, and wiggling his feet in the air, which is a very hard trick for a rabbit, what should happen but that out of the woods sprang two boys.  \"There's the dog! Grab him!\" cried one boy. \"Never mind about the rabbit! Get the trick dog!\" And the boys rushed right up, knocking Uncle Wiggily down, and grabbing Fido Flip-Flop. And they started off through the woods with him, while Uncle Wiggily cried out for them to come back. But they wouldn't.  Now please don't feel badly, for I'm going to tell you in the next story how Uncle Wiggily saved Fido, and also how the rabbit went to Arabella Chick's surprise party--that is I will if our automobile doesn't turn upside down, and break my ice cream cone.     STORY VI  UNCLE WIGGILY AT THE PARTY   Well, when Uncle Wiggily Longears found that the elephant wouldn't get off his trunk--oh, listen to me! What I meant to say was, that when Uncle Wiggily saw those two boys running off with Fido Flip-Flop, the little trick dog, as I told you about in the story before this, the old gentleman rabbit was so surprised at first that he didn't know what to do.  \"Won't you please come back with that little doggie?\" begged Uncle Wiggily, but the bad boys kept right on. I guess they knew how smart Fido was, and they wanted to get up a show with him. Anyhow, they kept on running through the woods, holding him tightly in their arms.  \"Oh, dear! This is terrible!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"I'll never get any good fortune if Fido has such bad luck. And it was partly my fault, too, for if we hadn't been doing tricks, we would have heard these boys coming, and could have run away. Well, now I must save Fido.\"  So Uncle Wiggily sat down on a stump, and thought, and thought, and thought of all the plans he could think of, to save the doggie from the two boys, and at last he decided the only way to do was to scare them.  \"Then they'll drop Fido, and run away,\" said the old gentleman rabbit. \"Let me see, how can I scare them? I know, I'll make believe I'm a tiger!\"  So what did that brave Uncle Wiggily do? but go to a mud hole, and with his crutch dipped into the mud, he made himself all striped over like a tiger that you see in a circus. Oh, he was a most ferocious sight when he finished decorating himself! Then he hid his satchel in the bushes, and he started off on a short cut through the woods, to get ahead of the boys. Faster and faster through the woods went Uncle Wiggily, and he looked so peculiarly terrifying that all the animals who saw him were scared out of their wits, and one old blue-jay bird was so frightened that he wiggled his tail up and down, and hid his head in a hollow tree.  Well, by and by, after a while, Uncle Wiggily got to a place in the woods where he knew those boys, with Fido Flip-Flop, would soon come by. Then the rabbit hid himself in the bushes, so that his long ears wouldn't show. For he knew that if the boys saw them, they would know right away he wasn't a tiger, no matter if he was striped like one.  In a few minutes along came the boys, and they were talking about what they were going to do to Fido, and how they would put him in a cage, and make him do lots of tricks. All of a sudden there was a rustling in the bushes, and Uncle Wiggily just stuck out his head and part of his body, laying his ears flat back where they could not be seen. But the boys could see the mud stripes, only they didn't know they were just mud, you understand.  \"Oh! See that!\" cried one boy.  \"Yes, it's a tigery-tiger!\" exclaimed the other boy.  \"Let's run!\" shouted both the boys together. \"The tiger will eat us up!\"  And just then Uncle Wiggily growled as loudly as he could, a real fierce growl, and he rattled the bushes and stuck out his striped paws, and those boys dropped Fido Flip-Flop, and ran away, as hard as they could through the woods, leaving Fido to join the rabbit.  \"Thank you very much for saving me, Uncle Wiggily,\" said the dog, as soon as he got over being frightened. \"That was a good trick, to pretend you were a tiger. But I knew you right away, only, of course, I wasn't going to tell those boys who you were. It served them right, for squeezing me the way they did. Now we'll go on, and see if we can find a fortune for you.\"  So they went back to where Uncle Wiggily had left his valise, and there it was safe and sound, and inside it were some nice things to eat, and the rabbit and doggie had a dinner there in the woods, after the mud stripes were washed off.  Then they went on and on, for ever so long, and nothing happened, except that a mosquito bit Fido on the end of his nose, and every time he sneezed it tickled him.  \"Well, I guess we won't have any more adventures to-day, Uncle Wiggily,\" spoke the doggie, but, a moment later, they heard a rustling in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#4)"],["body","and, before they could hide themselves, out jumped Arabella Chick, the sister of Charlie, the rooster boy.  \"Oh, you dear Uncle Wiggily!\" she exclaimed, \"you're just in time.\"  \"What for?\" asked Uncle Wiggily; \"for the train?\"  \"No, for my party,\" answered Arabella. \"I'm going to have one for all my friends, and I want you to come. Will you?\"  \"Oh, I guess so, Arabella. But you see, I have a friend with me, and----\"  \"Oh, he can come too,\" spoke Arabella, making a bow to Fido Flip-Flop. So Uncle Wiggily introduced the doggie to the chickie girl, and the chickie girl to the doggie.  Then they went on together to the party, which was held in a nice big chicken coop.  Oh, I wish you could have been there! It was just too nice for anything! Sammie and Susie Littletail were there, and they were so glad to see Uncle Wiggily again. He said he hadn't been very lucky in finding his fortune so far, but his rheumatism was not much worse, and he was going to keep on traveling. He sent his love to all the folks, and said he'd be home some time later.  Then, of course, all the other animal friends were at the party and they played games--games of all kinds, including a new one called \"Please don't sit on my hat, and I won't sit on yours.\" It was too funny for anything, really it was.  Then, of course, there were good things to eat. Buddy Pigg passed around the ice cream, and just as he was handing a plate of it to Jennie Chipmunk it slipped--I mean the ice cream slipped--and went right into Uncle Butter's lap. But the old goat didn't care a bit. He said it reminded him of a pail of paste, and he ate the ice cream, and Nurse Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy got Jennie some more.  Then Flip-Flop and Uncle Wiggily did some of their tricks, and every one said they were fine, and they thought it was the best party they had ever been at.  But all of a sudden, just as they were playing the game called \"Jump on the piano, and play a queer tune,\" there came a knock at the door.  \"Who's there?\" asked Arabella Chick.  \"I am,\" answered a voice, \"and I want Uncle Wiggily Longears instantly! He must come with me!\" And they all looked from the window, and there stood a big dog, dressed up like a soldier, and he had a gun with him. And he wanted Uncle Wiggily to come out, and every one was frightened, for fear he'd shoot the old gentleman rabbit.  But please don't you get alarmed. I wouldn't have that happen for worlds, and in the next story, if I catch a fish in the milk bottle, and he doesn't bite my finger, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in a parade. And it will be a Decoration Day story.     STORY VII  UNCLE WIGGILY IN A PARADE   Arabella Chick's party seemed to break up very suddenly when the guests saw that soldier-dog with the gun waiting outside the door. Buddy Pigg slipped out of a back window, and ran home with his tail behind him. Oh, excuse me, guinea pigs don't have a tail, do they? Anyhow he ran home, and so did Sammie and Susie Littletail, and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, and the Wibblewobble children, and Peetie and Jackie Bow Wow too.  But, of course, Arabella Chick couldn't run home because she was at home already, so she just looked out of the window once more, and there the dog-soldier stood, and he was looking in his gun to see if it was loaded.  \"Well, is Uncle Wiggily coming out?\" called the dog again.  \"I guess I am--that is--are you sure you want me?\" asked the poor old gentleman rabbit, puzzled like.  \"Yes, of course I want you,\" replied the dog.  \"Then I guess I've got to go!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he looked for his crutch and valise. \"I guess this is the end of my fortune-hunting. Goodbye everybody!\" And he felt so badly that two big tears rolled down his ears--I mean his eyes.  Well, he bravely walked out of the door, and as he did so the dog-soldier, with the gun, exclaimed:  \"Ah, here you are at last! Now hurry up, Uncle Wiggily, or we'll be late for the parade!\"  And, would you believe it? that dog was good, kind, old Percival, who used to be in a circus. And of course he wouldn't hurt the rabbit gentleman for anything. Percival just put his gun to his shoulder, and said:  \"Come on, we'll get in the parade now.\"  \"Parade? What parade?\" asked Uncle Wiggily. \"Oh my! how you frightened me!\"  \"Why the Decoration Day parade,\" answered Percival. \"To-day is the day when we put flowers on the soldiers' graves, and remember them for being so brave as to go to war. All old soldiers march in the parade, and so do all their friends. I'm going to march, and I'm going to put flowers on a lot of soldiers' graves. I happened to remember that you were once in the war, so I came for you. I didn't mean to scare you. You were in the war, weren't you?\"  \"Yes,\" said Uncle Wiggily, happy now because he knew he wasn't going to get shot, \"I once went to war, and killed a lot of mosquitoes.\"  \"Good! I thought so!\" exclaimed Percival. \"Well, I met Grandfather Goosey Gander, and he said he thought you were at this party, so I came for you. Come on, now, the parade is almost ready to start.\"  \"Oh, how you did frighten us!\" exclaimed Arabella, whose heart was still going pitter-patter. \"We thought you were going to hurt Uncle Wiggily, Percival.\"  \"Oh, I'm so sorry I alarmed you,\" spoke the circus dog politely. \"I won't do it again.\"  Well, in a little while Percival and Uncle Wiggily were at the parade. The old gentleman rabbit left his satchel at Arabella's house, and only took his crutch. But he limped along just like a real soldier, and Percival carried his gun as bravely as one could wish.  Oh, I wish you could have heard the bands playing, and the drums beating--the little kind that sound like when you drop beans on the kitchen oil-cloth, and the big drums, that go \"Boom-boom!\" like thunder and lightning, and the fifes that squeak like a mouse in the cheese trap, and then the big blaring horns, that make a sound like a circus performance.  They were all there, and there were lots of soldiers and horses and wagons filled with flowers to put on the graves of the soldiers, who were so brave that they didn't mind going to war to fight for their country, though war is a terrible thing.  Then the march began, and Uncle Wiggily and Percival stepped out as brave as anyone in all the parade. Oh, how fine they looked! and, when they marched past, all the animal people, and some real boys and girls, and papas and mammas clapped their hands and cried \"Hurrah!\" at the sight of the old gentleman rabbit limping along on his crutch, with the dog-soldier marching beside him.  \"Who knows,\" whispered Percival to Uncle Wiggily, \"who knows but what you may discover your fortune to-day?\"  \"Indeed I may,\" answer Uncle Wiggily. \"Who knows?\"  Well, that was a fine parade. But something happened. I was afraid it would, but I'll tell you all about it, and you can see for yourself whether or not I was right.  All of a sudden one man, with a big horn--a horn large enough to put a loaf of mother's bread down inside the noisy end--all of a sudden this man blew a terrible blast--\"Umpty-umpty-Umph! Umph!\" My, what a noise he made on that horn.  Now, right in front of this man was a little boy-duck riding on a pony. Yes, you've guessed who he was--he was Jimmy Wibblewobble. And when that man blew the loud blast, the pony was frightened, and ran away with Jimmie on his back.  Faster and faster ran the pony, and Jimmie Wibblewobble clung to his back, fearing every moment he would be thrown off. In and out among the people and animals in the parade, in and out among trolley cars and automobiles, in and out, and from one side to another of the street ran the frightened pony.  \"Oh, poor Jimmie will be killed!\" cried Percival.  \"No, he will not, for I will save him!\" shouted Uncle Wiggily. So that brave rabbit ran right out to where he saw Munchie Trot, the little pony boy.  \"Let me jump on your back, Munchie,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"and then we'll race after that runaway pony and grab off poor Jimmie. And run as fast as you can, Munchie!\"  \"I certainly will!\" cried Munchie. So Uncle Wiggily got on Munchie's back, and away they started after the runaway pony.  Faster and faster ran Munchie, and by this time the other little horsie was getting tired. Jimmie was still clinging to his back, and asking him not to run so fast, but the pony was so frightened he didn't listen to the duck-boy.  Then, just as he was going to run into a hot peanut wagon, and maybe toss Jimmie off into the red-hot roaster, all at once Uncle Wiggily, on Munchie's back, galloped up alongside of the runaway pony. And as quick as you can drink a glass of lemonade, Uncle Wiggily grabbed Jimmie up on Munchie's back beside him, and so saved the duck-boy's life. And then the runaway pony stopped short, all of a sudden, and didn't bump into the hot peanut wagon, after all, and he was sorry he had run away, and scared folks.  Then the Decoration Day parade went on, and everyone said how brave Uncle Wiggily was. But he hadn't yet found his fortune, and so in the story after this in case our front porch doesn't run away, and take the back steps with it, so I have to sleep on the doormat, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in the fountain.     STORY VIII  UNCLE WIGGILY IN THE FOUNTAIN   Well, after the Decoration Day parade, and the things that happened in it, such as the pony running away with Jimmie Wibblewobble, Uncle Wiggily Longears thought he'd like to go off to some quiet place and rest.  \"Oh, can't you come with me?\" asked Percival, the old circus dog. \"We'll go to the Bow-Wows house, and have something to eat.\"  \"No, I'm afraid I can't go,\" replied the old gentleman rabbit. \"You see I must travel on to seek my fortune, for I haven't found it yet, and I still have the rheumatism.\"  \"Why don't you try to lose that rheumatism somewhere?\" asked Percival. \"I would, if it's such a bother.\"  \"Oh, I've tried and tried and tried, but I can't seem to lose it,\" replied Uncle Wiggily. \"So I think I'll travel on. I'm"]]]
