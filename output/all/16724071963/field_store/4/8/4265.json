Ey'st be gone soon. Ah, Bess, dear lass, if theawdst promise to break thy compact wi' Satan--to repent and save thy precious sowl--ey should dee content.\"  \"Oh, do not talk thus!\" cried Bess. \"You will soon be well again.\"  \"Listen to me,\" continued Ashbead, earnestly; \"dust na knoa that if thy babe be na bapteesed efore to-morrow neet, it'll be sacrificed to t' Prince o' Darkness. Go to some o' t' oly feythers--confess thy sins an' implore heaven's forgiveness--an' mayhap they'll save thee an' thy infant.\"  \"And be burned as a witch,\" rejoined Bess, fiercely. \"It is useless, Cuthbert; I have tried them all. I have knelt to them, implored them, but their hearts are hard as flints. They will not heed me. They will not disobey the abbot's cruel injunctions, though he be their superior no longer. But I shall be avenged upon him--terribly avenged.\"  \"Leave meh, theaw wicked woman.\" cried Ashbead; \"ey dunna wish to ha' thee near meh. Let meh dee i' peace.\"  \"Thou wilt not die, I tell thee, Cuthbert,\" cried Bess; \"Nicholas hath staunched thy wound.\"  \"He stawncht it, seyst to?\" cried Ashbead, raising. \"Ey'st never owe meh loife to him.\"  And before he could be prevented he tore off the bandage, and the blood burst forth anew.  \"It is not my fault if he perishes now,\" observed Demdike, moodily.  \"Help him--help him!\" implored Bess.  \"He shanna touch meh,\" cried Ashbead, struggling and increasing the effusion. \"Keep him off, ey adjure thee. Farewell, Bess,\" he added, sinking back utterly exhausted by the effort.  \"Cuthbert!\" screamed Bess, terrified by his looks, \"Cuthbert! art thou really dying? Look at me, speak to me! Ha!\" she cried, as if seized by a sudden idea, \"they say the blessing of a dying man will avail. Bless my child, Cuthbert, bless it!\"  \"Give it me!\" groaned the forester.  Bess held the infant towards him; but before he could place his hands upon it all power forsook him, and he fell back and expired.  \"Lost! lost! for ever lost!\" cried Bess, with a wild shriek.  At this moment a loud blast was blown from the gate-tower, and a trumpeter called out,  \"The abbot and the two other prisoners are coming.\"  \"To thy feet, wench!\" cried Demdike, imperiously, and seizing the bewildered woman by the arm; \"to thy feet, and come with me to meet him!\"     CHAPTER IV.--THE MALEDICTION.   The captive ecclesiastics, together with the strong escort by which they were attended, under the command of John Braddyll, the high sheriff of the county, had passed the previous night at Whitewell, in Bowland Forest; and the abbot, before setting out on his final journey, was permitted to spend an hour in prayer in a little chapel on an adjoining hill, overlooking a most picturesque portion of the forest, the beauties of which were enhanced by the windings of the Hodder, one of the loveliest streams in Lancashire. His devotions performed, Paslew, attended by a guard, slowly descended the hill, and gazed his last on scenes familiar to him almost from infancy. Noble trees, which now looked like old friends, to whom he was bidding an eternal adieu, stood around him. Beneath them, at the end of a glade, couched a herd of deer, which started off at sight of the intruders, and made him envy their freedom and fleetness as he followed them in thought to their solitudes. At the foot of a steep rock ran the Hodder, making the pleasant music of other days as it dashed over its pebbly bed, and recalling times, when, free from all care, he had strayed by its wood-fringed banks, to listen to the pleasant sound of running waters, and watch the shining pebbles beneath them, and the swift trout and dainty umber glancing past.  A bitter pang was it to part with scenes so fair, and the abbot spoke no word, nor even looked up, until, passing Little Mitton, he came in sight of Whalley Abbey. Then, collecting all his energies, he prepared for the shock he was about to endure. But nerved as he was, his firmness was sorely tried when he beheld the stately pile, once his own, now gone from him and his for ever. He gave one fond glance towards it, and then painfully averting his gaze, recited, in a low voice, this supplication:--      \"_Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam misericordiam tuam. Et     secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum, dele iniquitatem     meam. Amplius lava me ab iniquitate meâ, et à peccato meo     munda me._\"  But other thoughts and other emotions crowded upon him, when he beheld the groups of his old retainers advancing to meet him: men, women, and children pouring forth loud lamentations, prostrating themselves at his feet, and deploring his doom. The abbot's fortitude had a severe trial here, and the tears sprung to his eyes. The devotion of these poor people touched him more sharply than the severity of his adversaries.  \"Bless ye! bless ye! my children,\" he cried; \"repine not for me, for I bear my cross with resignation. It is for me to bewail your lot, much fearing that the flock I have so long and so zealously tended will fall into the hands of other and less heedful pastors, or, still worse, of devouring wolves. Bless ye, my children, and be comforted. Think of the end of Abbot Paslew, and for what he suffered.\"  \"Think that he was a traitor to the king, and took up arms in rebellion against him,\" cried the sheriff, riding up, and speaking in a loud voice; \"and that for his heinous offences he was justly condemned to death.\"  Murmurs arose at this speech, but they were instantly checked by the escort.  \"Think charitably of me, my children,\" said the abbot; \"and the blessed Virgin keep you steadfast in your faith. Benedicite!\"  \"Be silent, traitor, I command thee,\" cried the sheriff, striking him with his gauntlet in the face.  The abbot's pale check burnt crimson, and his eye flashed fire, but he controlled himself, and answered meekly,--  \"Thou didst not speak in such wise, John Braddyll, when I saved thee from the flood.\"  \"Which flood thou thyself caused to burst forth by devilish arts,\" rejoined the sheriff. \"I owe thee little for the service. If for naught else, thou deservest death for thy evil doings on that night.\"  The abbot made no reply, for Braddyll's allusion conjured up a sombre train of thought within his breast, awakening apprehensions which he could neither account for, nor shake off. Meanwhile, the cavalcade slowly approached the north-east gateway of the abbey--passing through crowds of kneeling and sorrowing bystanders;--but so deeply was the abbot engrossed by the one dread idea that possessed him, that he saw them not, and scarce heard their woful lamentations. All at once the cavalcade stopped, and the sheriff rode on to the gate, in the opening of which some ceremony was observed. Then it was that Paslew raised his eyes, and beheld standing before him a tall man, with a woman beside him bearing an infant in her arms. The eyes of the pair were fixed upon him with vindictive exultation. He would have averted his gaze, but an irresistible fascination withheld him.  \"Thou seest all is prepared,\" said Demdike, coming close up the mule on which Paslew was mounted, and pointing to the gigantic gallows, looming above the abbey walls; \"wilt them now accede to my request?\" And then he added, significantly--\"on the same terms as before.\"  The abbot understood his meaning well. Life and freedom were offered him by a being, whose power to accomplish his promise he did not doubt. The struggle was hard; but he resisted the temptation, and answered firmly,--  \"No.\"  \"Then die the felon death thou meritest,\" cried Bess, fiercely; \"and I will glut mine eyes with the spectacle.\"  Incensed beyond endurance, the abbot looked sternly at her, and raised his hand in denunciation. The action and the look were so appalling, that the affrighted woman would have fled if her husband had not restrained her.  \"By the holy patriarchs and prophets; by the prelates and confessors; by the doctors of the church; by the holy abbots, monks, and eremites, who dwelt in solitudes, in mountains, and in caverns; by the holy saints and martyrs, who suffered torture and death for their faith, I curse thee, witch!\" cried Paslew. \"May the malediction of Heaven and all its hosts alight on the head of thy infant--\"  \"Oh! holy abbot,\" shrieked Bess, breaking from her husband, and flinging herself at Paslew's feet, \"curse me, if thou wilt, but spare my innocent child. Save it, and we will save thee.\"  \"Avoid thee, wretched and impious woman,\" rejoined the abbot; \"I have pronounced the dread anathema, and it cannot be recalled. Look at the dripping garments of thy child. In blood has it been baptised, and through blood-stained paths shall its course be taken.\"  \"Ha!\" shrieked Bess, noticing for the first time the ensanguined condition of the infant's attire. \"Cuthbert's blood--oh!\"  \"Listen to me, wicked woman,\" pursued the abbot, as if filled with a prophetic spirit. \"Thy child's life shall be long--beyond the ordinary term of woman--but it shall be a life of woe and ill.\"  \"Oh! stay him--stay him; or I shall die!\" cried Bess.  But the wizard could not speak. A greater power than his own apparently overmastered him.  \"Children shall she have,\" continued the abbot, \"and children's children, but they shall be a race doomed and accursed--a brood of adders, that the world shall flee from and crush. A thing accursed, and shunned by her fellows, shall thy daughter be--evil reputed and evil doing. No hand to help her--no lip to bless her--life a burden; and death--long, long in coming--finding her in a dismal dungeon. Now, depart from me, and trouble me no more.\"  Bess made a motion as if she "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15493"],["title","The Lancashire Witches: A Romance of Pendle Forest (#8)"],["body","go, and then turning, partly round, dropped heavily on the ground. Demdike caught the child ere she fell.  \"Thou hast killed her!\" he cried to the abbot.  \"A stronger voice than mine hath spoken, if it be so,\" rejoined Paslew. \"_Fuge miserrime, fuge malefice, quia judex adest iratus_.\"  At this moment the trumpet again sounded, and the cavalcade being put in motion, the abbot and his fellow-captives passed through the gate.  Dismounting from their mules within the court, before the chapter-house, the captive ecclesiastics, preceded by the sheriff were led to the principal chamber of the structure, where the Earl of Derby awaited them, seated in the Gothic carved oak chair, formerly occupied by the Abbots of Whalley on the occasions of conferences or elections. The earl was surrounded by his officers, and the chamber was filled with armed men. The abbot slowly advanced towards the earl. His deportment was dignified and firm, even majestic. The exaltation of spirit, occasioned by the interview with Demdike and his wife, had passed away, and was succeeded by a profound calm. The hue of his cheek was livid, but otherwise he seemed wholly unmoved.  The ceremony of delivering up the bodies of the prisoners to the earl was gone through by the sheriff, and their sentences were then read aloud by a clerk. After this the earl, who had hitherto remained covered, took off his cap, and in a solemn voice spoke:--  \"John Paslew, somewhile Abbot of Whalley, but now an attainted and condemned felon, and John Eastgate and William Haydocke, formerly brethren of the same monastery, and confederates with him in crime, ye have heard your doom. To-morrow you shall die the ignominious death of traitors; but the king in his mercy, having regard not so much to the heinous nature of your offences towards his sovereign majesty as to the sacred offices you once held, and of which you have been shamefully deprived, is graciously pleased to remit that part of your sentence, whereby ye are condemned to be quartered alive, willing that the hearts which conceived so much malice and violence against him should cease to beat within your own bosoms, and that the arms which were raised in rebellion against him should be interred in one common grave with the trunks to which they belong.\"  \"God save the high and puissant king, Henry the Eighth, and free him from all traitors!\" cried the clerk.  \"We humbly thank his majesty for his clemency,\" said the abbot, amid the profound silence that ensued; \"and I pray you, my good lord, when you shall write to the king concerning us, to say to his majesty that we died penitent of many and grave offences, amongst the which is chiefly that of having taken up arms unlawfully against him, but that we did so solely with the view of freeing his highness from evil counsellors, and of re-establishing our holy church, for the which we would willingly die, if our death might in anywise profit it.\"  \"Amen!\" exclaimed Father Eastgate, who stood with his hands crossed upon his breast, close behind Paslew. \"The abbot hath uttered my sentiments.\"  \"He hath not uttered mine,\" cried Father Haydocke. \"I ask no grace from the bloody Herodias, and will accept none. What I have done I would do again, were the past to return--nay, I would do more--I would find a way to reach the tyrant's heart, and thus free our church from its worst enemy, and the land from a ruthless oppressor.\"  \"Remove him,\" said the earl; \"the vile traitor shall be dealt with as he merits. For you,\" he added, as the order was obeyed, and addressing the other prisoners, \"and especially you, John Paslew, who have shown some compunction for your crimes, and to prove to you that the king is not the ruthless tyrant he hath been just represented, I hereby in his name promise you any boon, which you may ask consistently with your situation. What favour would you have shown you?\"  The abbot reflected for a moment.  \"Speak thou, John Eastgate,\" said the Earl of Derby, seeing that the abbot was occupied in thought.  \"If I may proffer a request, my lord,\" replied the monk, \"it is that our poor distraught brother, William Haydocke, be spared the quartering block. He meant not what he said.\"  \"Well, be it as thou wilt,\" replied the earl, bending his brows, \"though he ill deserves such grace. Now, John Paslew, what wouldst thou?\"  Thus addressed, the abbot looked up.  \"I would have made the same request as my brother, John Eastgate, if he had not anticipated me, my lord,\" said Paslew; \"but since his petition is granted, I would, on my own part, entreat that mass be said for us in the convent church. Many of the brethren are without the abbey, and, if permitted, will assist at its performance.\"  \"I know not if I shall not incur the king's displeasure in assenting,\" replied the Earl of Derby, after a little reflection; \"but I will hazard it. Mass for the dead shall be said in the church at midnight, and all the brethren who choose to come thither shall be permitted to assist at it. They will attend, I doubt not, for it will be the last time the rites of the Romish Church will be performed in those Walls. They shall have all required for the ceremonial.\"  \"Heaven's blessings on you, my lord,\" said the abbot.  \"But first pledge me your sacred word,\" said the earl, \"by the holy office you once held, and by the saints in whom you trust, that this concession shall not be made the means of any attempt at flight.\"  \"I swear it,\" replied the abbot, earnestly.  \"And I also swear it,\" added Father Eastgate.  \"Enough,\" said the earl. \"I will give the requisite orders. Notice of the celebration of mass at midnight shall be proclaimed without the abbey. Now remove the prisoners.\"  Upon this the captive ecclesiastics were led forth. Father Eastgate was taken to a strong room in the lower part of the chapter-house, where all acts of discipline had been performed by the monks, and where the knotted lash, the spiked girdle, and the hair shirt had once hung; while the abbot was conveyed to his old chamber, which had been prepared for his reception, and there left alone.     CHAPTER V.--THE MIDNIGHT MASS.   Dolefully sounds the All Souls' bell from the tower of the convent church. The bell is one of five, and has obtained the name because it is tolled only for those about to pass away from life. Now it rings the knell of three souls to depart on the morrow. Brightly illumined is the fane, within which no taper hath gleamed since the old worship ceased, showing that preparations are made for the last service. The organ, dumb so long, breathes a low prelude. Sad is it to hear that knell--sad to view those gloriously-dyed panes--and to think why the one rings and the other is lighted up.  Word having gone forth of the midnight mass, all the ejected brethren flock to the abbey. Some have toiled through miry and scarce passable roads. Others have come down from the hills, and forded deep streams at the hazard of life, rather than go round by the far-off bridge, and arrive too late. Others, who conceive themselves in peril from the share they have taken in the late insurrection, quit their secure retreats, and expose themselves to capture. It may be a snare laid for them, but they run the risk. Others, coming from a yet greater distance, beholding the illuminated church from afar, and catching the sound of the bell tolling at intervals, hurry on, and reach the gate breathless and wellnigh exhausted. But no questions are asked. All who present themselves in ecclesiastical habits are permitted to enter, and take part in the procession forming in the cloister, or proceed at once to the church, if they prefer it.  Dolefully sounds the bell. Barefooted brethren meet together, sorrowfully salute each other, and form in a long line in the great area of the cloisters. At their head are six monks bearing tall lighted candles. After them come the quiristers, and then one carrying the Host, between the incense-bearers. Next comes a youth holding the bell. Next are placed the dignitaries of the church, the prior ranking first, and the others standing two and two according to their degrees. Near the entrance of the refectory, which occupies the whole south side of the quadrangle, stand a band of halberdiers, whose torches cast a ruddy glare on the opposite tower and buttresses of the convent church, revealing the statues not yet plucked from their niches, the crosses on the pinnacles, and the gilt image of Saint Gregory de Northbury, still holding its place over the porch. Another band are stationed near the mouth of the vaulted passage, under the chapter-house and vestry, whose grey, irregular walls, pierced by numberless richly ornamented windows, and surmounted by small turrets, form a beautiful boundary on the right; while a third party are planted on the left, in the open space, beneath the dormitory, the torchlight flashing ruddily upon the hoary pillars and groined arches sustaining the vast structure above them.  Dolefully sounds the bell. And the ghostly procession thrice tracks the four ambulatories of the cloisters, solemnly chanting a requiem for the dead.  Dolefully sounds the bell. And at its summons all the old retainers of the abbot press to the gate, and sue for admittance, but in vain. They, therefore, mount the neighbouring hill commanding the abbey, and as the solemn sounds float faintly by, and glimpses are caught of the white-robed brethren gliding along the cloisters, and rendered phantom-like by the torchlight, the beholders half imagine it must be a company of sprites, and that the departed monks have been permitted for an hour to assume their old forms, and revisit their old haunts.  Dolefully sounds the bell. And two biers, covered with palls, are borne slowly towards the church, followed by a tall monk.  The clock was on the stroke of twelve. The procession having drawn up within the court in front of the abbot's lodging, the prisoners were brought forth, and at sight of the"]]]
