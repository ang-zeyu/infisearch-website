Over me he will have no power.\"  To this the king consented, and they returned together to the palace, where the wise woman became guardian to the prince, and she fulfilled her duties so well that he became much more discreet and self-controlled. Only at times his violent temper got the better of him, and led him to wish what he afterwards vainly regretted.  Thus all went well till the prince became a man, when, though he had great affection for her, he felt ashamed of having an old woman for his counsellor, and he said, \"I certainly wish that I had a faithful and discreet adviser of my own age and sex.\"  On that very day a young nobleman offered himself as companion to the prince, and as he was a young man of great ability, he was accepted: whereupon the old woman took her departure, and was never seen again.  The young nobleman performed his part so well that the prince became deeply attached to him, and submitted in every way to his counsels. But at last a day came when, being in a rage, the advice of his friend irritated him, and he cried hastily, \"Will you drive me mad with your long sermons? I wish you would hold your tongue for ever.\" On which the young nobleman became dumb, and so remained. For he was not, as the wise woman had been, independent of the prince's power.  The prince's grief and remorse knew no bounds. \"Am I not under a curse?\" said he. \"Truly I ought to be cast out from human society, and sent to live with wild beasts in a wilderness. I only bring evil upon those I love best--indeed, there is no hope for me unless I can find my godfather, and make him recall this fatal gift.\"  So the prince mounted his horse, and, accompanied by his dumb friend, who still remained faithful to him, he set forth to find the magician. They took no followers, except the prince's dog, a noble hound, who was so quick of hearing that he understood all that was said to him, and was, next to the young nobleman, the wisest person at court.  \"Mark well, my dog,\" said the prince to him, \"we stay nowhere till we find my godfather, and when we find him we go no further. I rely on your sagacity to help us.\"  The dog licked the prince's hand, and then trotted so resolutely down a certain road that the two friends allowed him to lead them and followed close behind.  They travelled in this way to the edge of the king's dominions, only halting for needful rest and refreshment. At last the dog led them through a wood, and towards evening they found themselves in the depths of the forest, with no sign of any shelter for the night. Presently they heard a little bell, such as is rung for prayer, and the dog ran down a side path and led them straight to a kind of grotto, at the door of which stood an aged hermit.  \"Does a magician live here?\" asked the prince.  \"No one lives here but myself,\" said the hermit, \"but I am old, and have meditated much. My advice is at your service if you need it.\"  The prince then related his history, and how he was now seeking the magician godfather, to rid himself of his gift.  \"And yet that will not cure your temper,\" said the hermit. \"It were better that you employed yourself in learning to control that, and to use your power prudently.\"  \"No, no,\" replied the prince; \"I must find the magician.\"  And when the hermit pressed his advice, he cried, \"Provoke me not, good father, or I may be base enough to wish you ill; and the evil I do I cannot undo.\"  And he departed, followed by his friend, and calling his dog. But the dog seated himself at the hermit's feet, and would not move. Again and again the prince called him, but he only whined and wagged his tail, and refused to move. Coaxing and scolding were both in vain, and when at last the prince tried to drag him off by force, the dog growled.  \"Base brute!\" cried the prince, flinging him from him in a transport of rage. \"How have I been so deceived in you? I wish you were hanged!\" And even as he spoke the dog vanished, and as the prince turned his head he saw the poor beast's body dangling from a tree above him. The sight overwhelmed him, and he began bitterly to lament his cruelty.  \"Will no one hang me also,\" he cried, \"and rid the world of such a monster?\"  \"It is easier to die repenting than to live amending,\" said the hermit; \"yet is the latter course the better one. Wherefore abide with me, my son, and learn in solitude those lessons of self-government without which no man is fit to rule others.\"  \"It is impossible,\" said the prince. \"These fits of passion are as a madness that comes upon me, and they are beyond cure. It only remains to find my godfather, that he may make me less baneful to others by taking away the power I abuse.\" And raising the body of the dog tenderly in his arms, he laid it before him on his horse, and rode away, the dumb nobleman following him.  They now entered the dominions of another king, and in due time arrived at the capital. The prince presented himself to the king, and asked if he had a magician in his kingdom.  \"Not to my knowledge,\" replied the king. \"But I have a remarkably wise daughter, and if you want counsel she may be able to help you.\"  The princess accordingly was sent for, and she was so beautiful, as well as witty, that the prince fell in love with her, and begged the king to give her to him to wife. The king, of course, was unable to refuse what the prince wished, and the wedding was celebrated without delay; and by the advice of his wife the prince placed the body of his faithful dog in a glass coffin, and kept it near him, that he might constantly be reminded of the evil results of giving way to his anger.  For a time all went well. At first the prince never said a harsh word to his wife; but by and by familiarity made him less careful, and one day she said something that offended him, and he fell into a violent rage. As he went storming up and down, the princess wrung her hands, and cried, \"Ah, my dear husband, I beg of you to be careful what you say to me. You say you loved your dog, and yet you know where he lies.\"  \"I know that I wish you were with him, with your prating!\" cried the prince, in a fury; and the words were scarcely out of his mouth when the princess vanished from his side, and when he ran to the glass coffin, there she lay, pale and lifeless, with her head upon the body of the hound.  The prince was now beside himself with remorse and misery, and when the dumb nobleman made signs that they should pursue their search for the magician, he only cried, \"Too late! too late!\"  But after a while he said, \"I will return to the hermit, and pass the rest of my miserable life in solitude and penance. And you, dear friend, go back to my father.\"  But the dumb nobleman shook his head, and could not be persuaded to leave the prince. Then they took the glass coffin on their shoulders, and on foot, and weeping as they went, they retraced their steps to the forest.  For some time the prince remained with the hermit, and submitted himself to his direction. Then the hermit bade him return to his father, and he obeyed.  Every day the prince stood by the glass coffin, and beat his breast and cried, \"Behold, murderer, the fruits of anger!\" And he tried hard to overcome the violence of his temper. When he lost heart he remembered a saying of the hermit: \"Patience had far to go, but she was crowned at last.\" And after a while the prince became as gentle as he had before been violent. And the king and all the court rejoiced at the change; but the prince remained sad at heart, thinking of the princess.  One day he was sitting alone, when a man approached him, dressed in a long black robe.  \"Good-day, godson,\" said he.  \"Who calls me godson?\" said the prince.  \"The magician you have so long sought,\" said the godfather. \"I have come to reclaim my gift.\"  \"What cruelty led you to bestow it upon me?\" asked the prince.  \"The king, your father, would have been dissatisfied with any ordinary present from me,\" said the magician, \"forgetting that the responsibilities of common gifts, and very limited power, are more than enough for most men to deal with. But I have not neglected you. I was the wise woman who brought you up. Again, I was the hermit, as your dog was sage enough to discover. I am come now to reclaim what has caused you such suffering.\"  \"Alas!\" cried the prince, \"why is your kindness so tardy? If you have not forgotten me, why have you withheld this benefit till it is too late for my happiness? My friend is dumb, my wife is dead, my dog is hanged. When wishes cannot reach these, do you think it matters to me what I may command?\"  \"Softly, prince,\" said the magician; \"I had a reason for the delay. But for these bitter lessons you would still be the slave of the violent temper which you have conquered, and which, as it was no gift of mine, I could not remove. Moreover, when the spell which made all things bend to your wish is taken away, its effects also are undone. Godson! I recall my gift.\"  As the magician spoke the glass sides of the coffin melted into the air, and the princess sprang up, and threw herself into her husband's arms. The dog also rose, stretched himself, and wagged his tail. The dumb nobleman ran to tell the good news to the king, and all the counsellors came back in a long train from the bottom of the sea, and set about the affairs of state as if nothing had happened.  The old king welcomed his children with open arms, and they all lived happily to the end of their days.     THE WIDOWS AND THE STRANGERS.   In days of yore, there were once two poor old widows who lived in the same hamlet and under the same roof. But though the cottages joined and one roof covered them, they had each a separate dwelling; and although they were alike in age and circumstances, yet in other respects they were very different. For one dame was covetous, though she had little to save, and the other was liberal, though she had little to give.  Now, on the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15592"],["title","Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales (#8)"],["body","ground opposite to the widows' cottages, stood a monastery where a few pious and charitable brethren spent their time in prayer, labour, and good works. And with the alms of these monks, and the kindness of neighbours, and because their wants were few, the old women dwelt in comfort, and had daily bread, and lay warm at night.  One evening, when the covetous old widow was having supper, there came a knock at her door. Before she opened it she hastily put away the remains of her meal.  \"For,\" said she, \"it is a stormy night, and ten to one some belated vagabond wants shelter; and when there are victuals on the table every fool must be asked to sup.\"  But when she opened the door, a monk came in who had his cowl pulled over his head to shelter him from the storm. The widow was much disconcerted at having kept one of the brotherhood waiting, and loudly apologized, but the monk stopped her, saying, \"I fear I cut short your evening meal, my daughter.\"  \"Now in the name of ill-luck, how came he to guess that?\" thought the widow, as with anxious civility she pressed the monk to take some supper after his walk; for the good woman always felt hospitably inclined towards any one who was likely to return her kindness sevenfold.  The brother, however, refused to sup; and as he seated himself the widow looked sharply through her spectacles to see if she could gather from any distention of the folds of his frock whether a loaf, a bottle of cordial, or a new winter's cloak were most likely to crown the visit. No undue protuberance being visible about the monk's person, she turned her eyes to his face, and found that her visitor was one of the brotherhood whom she had not seen before. And not only was his face unfamiliar, it was utterly unlike the kindly but rough countenances of her charitable patrons. None that she had ever seen boasted the noble beauty, the chiselled and refined features of the monk before her. And she could not but notice that, although only one rushlight illumined her room, and though the monk's cowl went far to shade him even from that, yet his face was lit up as if by light from within, so that his clear skin seemed almost transparent. In short, her curiosity must have been greatly stirred, had not greed made her more anxious to learn what he had brought than who he was.  \"It's a terrible night,\" quoth the monk, at length. \"Such tempest without only gives point to the indoor comforts of the wealthy; but it chills the very marrow of the poor and destitute.\"  \"Aye, indeed,\" sniffed the widow, with a shiver. \"If it were not for the charity of good Christians, what would poor folk do for comfort on such an evening as this?\"  \"It was that very thought, my daughter,\" said the monk, with a sudden earnestness on his shining face, \"that brought me forth even now through the storm to your cottage.\"  \"Heaven reward you!\" cried the widow, fervently.  \"Heaven does reward the charitable!\" replied the monk. \"To no truth do the Scriptures bear such constant and unbroken witness; even as it is written: 'He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and look, what he layeth out it shall be paid him again.'\"  \"What a blessed thing it must be to be able to do good!\" sighed the widow, piously wishing in her heart that the holy man would not delay to earn his recompense.  \"My daughter,\" said the monk, \"that blessing is not withheld from you. It is to ask your help for those in greater need than yourself that I am come to-night.\" And forthwith the good brother began to tell how two strangers had sought shelter at the monastery. Their house had been struck by lightning, and burnt with all it contained; and they themselves, aged, poor, and friendless, were exposed to the fury of the storm. \"Our house is a poor one,\" continued the monk. \"The strangers' lodging room was already full, and we are quite without the means of making these poor souls comfortable. You at least have a sound roof over your head, and if you can spare one or two things for the night, they shall be restored to you to-morrow, when some of our guests depart.\"  The widow could hardly conceal her vexation and disappointment. \"Now, dear heart, holy father!\" cried she, \"is there not a rich body in the place, that you come for charity to a poor old widow like me, that am in a case rather to borrow myself than to lend to others?\"  \"Can you spare us a blanket?\" said the monk. \"These poor strangers have been out in the storm, remember.\"  The widow started. \"What meddling busybody told him that the Baroness gave me a new blanket at Michaelmas?\" thought she; but at last, very unwillingly, she went to an inner room to fetch a blanket from her bed.  \"They shan't have the new one, that's flat,\" muttered the widow; and she drew out the old one and began to fold it up. But though she had made much of its thinness and insufficiency to the Baroness, she was so powerfully affected at parting with it, that all its good qualities came strongly to her mind.  \"It's a very suitable size,\" she said to herself, \"and easy for my poor old arms to shake or fold. With careful usage, it would last for years yet; but who knows how two wandering bodies that have been tramping miles through the storm may kick about in their sleep? And who knows if they're decent folk at all? likely enough they're two hedge birds, who have imposed a pitiful tale on the good fathers, and never slept under anything finer than a shock of straw in their lives.\"  The more the good woman thought of this, the more sure she felt that such was the case, and the less willing she became to lend her blanket to \"a couple of good-for-nothing tramps.\" A sudden idea decided her. \"Ten to one they bring fever with them!\" she cried; \"and dear knows I saw enough good bedding burnt after the black fever, three years ago! It would be a sin and a shame to burn a good blanket like this.\" And repeating \"a sin and a shame\" with great force, the widow restored the blanket to its place.  \"The coverlet's not worth much,\" she thought; \"but my goodman bought it the year after we were married, and if anything happened to it I should never forgive myself. The old shawl is good enough for tramps.\" Saying which she took a ragged old shawl from a peg, and began to fold it up. But even as she brushed and folded, she begrudged the faded rag.  \"It saves my better one on a bad day,\" she sighed; \"but I suppose the father must have something.\"  And accordingly she took it to the monk, saying, \"It's not so good as it has been, but there's warmth in it yet, and it cost a pretty penny when new.\"  \"And is this all that you can spare to the poor houseless strangers?\" asked the monk.  \"Aye, indeed, good father,\" said she, \"and that will cost me many a twinge of rheumatics. Folk at my age can't lie cold at night for nothing.\"  \"These poor strangers,\" said the monk, \"are as aged as yourself, and have lost everything.\"  But as all he said had no effect in moving the widow's compassion, he departed, and knocked at the door of her neighbour. Here he told the same tale, which met with a very different hearing. This widow was one of those liberal souls whose possessions always make them feel uneasy unless they are being accepted, or used, or borrowed by some one else. She blessed herself that, thanks to the Baroness, she had a new blanket fit to lend to the king himself, and only desired to know with what else she could serve the poor strangers and requite the charities of the brotherhood.  The monk confessed that all the slender stock of household goods in the monastery was in use, and one after another he accepted the loan of almost everything the widow had. As she gave the things he put them out through the door, saying that he had a messenger outside; and having promised that all should be duly restored on the morrow, he departed, leaving the widow with little else than an old chair in which she was to pass the night.  When the monk had gone, the storm raged with greater fury than before, and at last one terrible flash of lightning struck the widows' house, and though it did not hurt the old women, it set fire to the roof, and both cottages were soon ablaze. Now as the terrified old creatures hobbled out into the storm, they met the monk, who, crying, \"Come to the monastery!\" seized an arm of each, and hurried them up the hill. To such good purpose did he help them, that they seemed to fly, and arrived at the convent gate they hardly knew how.  Under a shed by the wall were the goods and chattels of the liberal widow.  \"Take back thine own, daughter,\" said the monk; \"thy charity hath brought its own reward.\"  \"But the strangers, good father?\" said the perplexed widow.  \"Ye are the strangers,\" answered the monk; \"and what thy pity thought meet to be spared for the unfortunate, Heaven in thy misfortune hath spared to thee.\"  Then turning to the other widow, he drew the old shawl from beneath his frock, and gave it to her, saying, \"I give you joy, dame, that this hath escaped the flames. It is not so good as it has been; but there is warmth in it yet, and it cost a pretty penny when new.\"  Full of confusion, the illiberal widow took back her shawl, murmuring, \"Lack-a-day! If I had but known it was ourselves the good father meant!\"  The monk gave a shrewd smile.  \"Aye, aye, it would have been different, I doubt not,\" said he; \"but accept the lesson, my daughter, and when next thou art called upon to help the unfortunate, think that it is thine own needs that would be served; and it may be thou shalt judge better as to what thou canst spare.\"  As he spoke, a flash of lightning lit up the ground where the monk stood, making a vast aureole about him in the darkness of the night. In the bright light, his countenance appeared stern and awful in its beauty, and when the flash was passed, the monk had vanished also.  Furthermore, when the widows sought shelter in the monastery, they found that the brotherhood knew nothing of their strange visitor.     KIND"]]]
