ZANE GREY.      THE DAY OF THE BEAST     CHAPTER I  His native land! Home!   The ship glided slowly up the Narrows; and from its deck Daren Lane saw the noble black outline of the Statue of Liberty limned against the clear gold of sunset. A familiar old pang in his breast--longing and homesickness and agony, together with the physical burn of gassed lungs--seemed to swell into a profound overwhelming emotion.  \"My own--my native land!\" he whispered, striving to wipe the dimness from his eyes. Was it only two years or twenty since he had left his country to go to war? A sense of strangeness dawned upon him. His home-coming, so ceaselessly dreamed of by night and longed for by day, was not going to be what his hopes had created. But at that moment his joy was too great to harbor strange misgivings. How impossible for any one to understand his feelings then, except perhaps the comrades who had survived the same ordeal!  The vessel glided on. A fresh cool spring breeze with a scent of land fanned Lane's hot brow. It bore tidings from home. Almost he thought he smelled the blossoms in the orchard, and the damp newly plowed earth, and the smoke from the wood fire his mother used to bake over. A hundred clamoring thoughts strove for dominance over his mind--to enter and flash by and fade. His sight, however, except for the blur that returned again and again, held fast to the entrancing and thrilling scene--the broad glimmering sun-track of gold in the rippling channel, leading his eye to the grand bulk of America's symbol of freedom, and to the stately expanse of the Hudson River, dotted by moving ferry-boats and tugs, and to the magnificent broken sky-line of New York City, with its huge dark structures looming and its thousands of windows reflecting the fire of the sun.  It was indeed a profound and stirring moment for Daren Lane, but not quite full, not all-satisfying. The great city seemed to frown. The low line of hills in the west shone dull gray and cold. Where were the screaming siren whistles, the gay streaming flags, the boats crowded with waving people, that should have welcomed disabled soldiers who had fought for their country? Lane hoped he had long passed by bitterness, but yet something rankled in the unhealed wound of his heart.  Some one put a hand in close clasp upon his arm. Then Lane heard the scrape of a crutch on the deck, and knew who stood beside him.  \"Well, Dare, old boy, does it look good to you?\" asked a husky voice.  \"Yes, Blair, but somehow not just what I expected,\" replied Lane, turning to his comrade.  \"Uhuh, I get you.\"  Blair Maynard stood erect with the aid of a crutch. There was even a hint of pride in the poise of his uncovered head. And for once Lane saw the thin white face softening and glowing. Maynard's big brown eyes were full of tears.  \"Guess I left my nerve as well as my leg over there,\" he said.  \"Blair, it's so good to get back that we're off color,\" returned Lane. \"On the level, I could scream like a madman.\"  \"I'd like to weep,\" replied the other, with a half laugh.  \"Where's Red? He oughtn't miss this.\"  \"Poor devil! He sneaked off from me somewhere,\" rejoined Maynard. \"Red's in pretty bad shape again. The voyage has been hard on him. I hope he'll be well enough to get his discharge when we land. I'll take him home to Middleville.\"  \"Middleville!\" echoed Lane, musingly. \"Home!... Blair, does it hit you--kind of queer? Do you long, yet dread to get home?\"  Maynard had no reply for that query, but his look was expressive.  \"I've not heard from Helen for over a year,\" went on Lane, more as if speaking to himself.  \"My God, Dare!\" exclaimed his companion, with sudden fire. \"Are you still thinking of her?\"  \"We--we are engaged,\" returned Lane, slowly. \"At least we _were_. But I've had no word that she----\"  \"Dare, your childlike faith is due for a jar,\" interrupted his comrade, with bitter scorn. \"Come down to earth. You're a crippled soldier--coming home--and damn lucky at that.\"  \"Blair, what do you know--that I do not know? For long I've suspected you're wise to--to things at home. You know I haven't heard much in all these long months. My mother wrote but seldom. Lorna, my kid sister, forgot me, I guess.... Helen always was a poor correspondent. Dal answered my letters, but she never _told_ me anything about home. When we first got to France I heard often from Margie Henderson and Mel Iden--crazy kind of letters--love-sick over soldiers.... But nothing for a long time now.\"  \"At first they wrote! Ha! Ha!\" burst out Maynard. \"Sure, they wrote love-sick letters. They sent socks and cigarettes and candy and books. And they all wanted us to hurry back to marry them.... Then--when the months had gone by and the novelty had worn off--when we went against the hell of real war--sick or worn out, sleepless and miserable, crippled or half demented with terror and dread and longing for home--then, by God, they quit!\"  \"Oh, no, Blair--not all of them,\" remonstrated Lane, unsteadily.  \"Well, old man, I'm sore, and you're about the only guy I can let out on,\" explained Maynard, heavily. \"One thing I'm glad of--we'll face it together. Daren, we were kids together--do you remember?--playing on the commons--straddling the old water-gates over the brooks--stealing cider from the country presses--barefoot boys going to school together. We played Post-Office with the girls and Indians with the boys. We made puppy love to Dal and Mel and Helen and Margie--all of them.... Then, somehow the happy thoughtless years of youth passed.... It seems strange and sudden now--but the war came. We enlisted. We had the same ideal--you and I.--We went to France--and you know what we did there together.... Now we're on this ship--getting into port of the good old U.S.--good as bad as she is!--going home together. Thank God for that. I want to be buried in Woodlawn.... Home! Home?... We feel its meaning. But, Dare, we'll have no home--no place.... We are old--we are through--we have served--we are done.... What we dreamed of as glory will be cold ashes to our lips, bitter as gall.... You always were a dreamer, an idealist, a believer in God, truth, hope and womanhood. In spite of the war these somehow survive in you.... But Dare, old friend, steel yourself now against disappointment and disillusion.\"  Used as Lane was to his comrade's outbursts, this one struck singularly home to Lane's heart and made him mute. The chill of his earlier misgiving returned, augmented by a strange uneasiness, a premonition of the unknown and dreadful future. But he threw it off. Faith would not die in Lane. It could not die utterly because of what he felt in himself. Yet--what was in store for him? Why was his hope so unquenchable? There could be no _resurgam_ for Daren Lane. Resignation should have brought him peace--peace--when every nerve in his shell-shocked body racked him--when he could not subdue a mounting hope that all would be well at home--when he quivered at thought of mother, sister, sweetheart!  The ship glided on under the shadow of America's emblem--a bronze woman of noble proportions, holding out a light to ships that came in the night--a welcome to all the world. Daren Lane held to his maimed comrade while they stood bare-headed and erect for that moment when the ship passed the statue. Lane knew what Blair felt. But nothing of what that feeling was could ever be spoken. The deck of the ship was now crowded with passengers, yet they were seemingly dead to anything more than a safe arrival at their destination. They were not crippled American soldiers. Except these two there were none in service uniforms. There across the windy space of water loomed the many-eyed buildings, suggestive of the great city. A low roar of traffic came on the breeze. Passengers and crew of the liner were glad to dock before dark. They took no notice of the rigid, erect soldiers. Lane, arm in arm with Blair, face to the front, stood absorbed in his sense of a nameless sublimity for them while passing the Statue of Liberty. The spirit of the first man who ever breathed of freedom for the human race burned as a white flame in the heart of Lane and his comrade. But it was not so much that spirit which held them erect, aloof, proud. It was a supreme consciousness of immeasurable sacrifice for an ideal that existed only in the breasts of men and women kindred to them--an unutterable and never-to-be-spoken glory of the duty done for others, but that they owed themselves. They had sustained immense loss of health and happiness; the future seemed like the gray, cold, gloomy expanse of the river; and there could never be any reward except this white fire of their souls. Nameless! But it was the increasing purpose that ran through the ages.  The ship docked at dark. Lane left Blair at the rail, gloomily gazing down at the confusion and bustle on the wharf, and went below to search for their comrade, Red Payson. He found him in his stateroom, half crouched on the berth, apparently oblivious to the important moment. It"]]]
