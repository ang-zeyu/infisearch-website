Our equipments consisted of a      musket, bayonet, and hatchet; to each of the servants a pistol;      Mr. ---- and myself had, in addition, another pistol and a      dagger, and a double-barrelled gun, instead of a musket: each      carried a pair of snowshoes, a supply of eight pounds of      biscuit and a piece of pork, ammunition, and one quart of rum;      besides, we had a light sled and four dogs, who took it in      turns in dragging the sled, which contained a blanket for each      man, rum and other necessaries. We depended on our guns for a      supply of provisions, and at all times could meet with plenty      of partridges and hares, though there were few days we did not      kill a deer. The description of one day's journey will suffice      for all, there being but little variation. The snow was at this      time about eight feet deep.       On the morning of our departure we set off in good spirits up      the river, and after following its course for about twelve      miles, arrived at the Rapids, a deer at full speed passed us; I      fired, and it fell; the next instant a wolf, in full pursuit,      made his appearance; on seeing the party, he halted for an      instant, and then rushed forward as if to attack us. Mr. ----      however, anticipated him; for taking a steady aim, at the same      time sitting coolly on an old tree, he passed a bullet through      the fellow's head, who was soon stretched a corpse on the snow;      a few minutes after another appeared, when several firing      together he also fell, roaring and howling for a long time,      when one of the men went and knocked him on the head with a      hatchet.       And now, ye effeminate feather bed loungers, where do you      suppose we were to sleep? There was no comfortable hotel to      receive us; not even a house where a board informs the      benighted traveller that there is \"entertainment for man and      horse;\" not even the skeleton of a wigwam; the snow eight feet      deep,--the thermometer nineteen degrees below the freezing      point. Every one having disencumbered himself of his load,      proceeded with his hatchet to cut down the small fir and birch      trees. The thick part of the trees was cut in lengths, and      heaped up in two piles; between which a sort of wigwam was      formed of the branches: a number of small twigs of trees, to      the depth of about three feet, were laid on the snow for a bed;      and having lighted the pile of wood on each side, some      prepared venison steaks for supper, while others skinned the      two wolves, in order, with the dear skin, to form a covering to      the wigwam; this some opposed, as being a luxury we should not      every day obtain. Supper being ready, we ate heartily, and      having melted some snow for water, we made some hot toddy, that      is, rum, butter, hot water and sugar; a song was proposed, and      acceeded to: and thus, in the midst of a dreary desert, far      from the voice of our fellow men, we sat cheerful and      contented, looking forward for the morrow, without dread,      anxious to renew our toils and resume our labours. Alter about      an hour thus spent the watch was appointed, and each wrapped in      his blanket. We vied unconvincing each other, with the nasal      organ, which was in the soundest sleep; mine was the last      watch, about an hour before daybreak. The Aurora Borealis      rolled in awful splendour across the deep blue sky, but I will      not tire my readers with a description. When the first glimpse      of morn showed itself in the light clouds floating in the      eastern horison, I awoke my companions; and by the time it was      sufficiently light we had breakfasted, and were ready to      proceed. Cutting off enough of the deer shot the night before,      we proceeded on our journey, leaving the rest to the wolves.      Each day and each night was a repetition of the same; the      country being in some places tolerably level, in general      covered with wood, but occasionally barren tracts, where      sometimes for miles not a tree was to be seen.       Mr. ---- instructing the men in which way he wished them to      act, informing them that his object was to open a friendly      communication with the Indians, rather than act on the      principle of intimidating them by revenge; that if they avoided      him, he should endeavour to take one or more prisoners and      bring them with him, in order that by the civilization of one      or two, an intercourse might be established that would end in      their permanent civilization. He strictly exhorted them not to      use undue violence: every one was strictly enjoined not to      _fire_ on any account. About three o'clock in the afternoon the      two men who then led the party were about two hundred yards      before the rest;--three deer closely followed by a pack of      wolves, issued from the wood on the left, and bounded across      the lake, passing very near the men, whom they totally      disregarded. The men incautiously fired at them. We were then      about half a mile from the point of land that almost      intersected the lake, and in a few minutes we saw it covered      with Indians, who instantly retired.[B] The alarm was given; we      soon reached the point; about five Hundred yards on the other      side we saw the Indian houses, and the Indians, men, women, and      children, rushing from them, across the lake, hereabout a mile      broad. Hurrying on we quickly came to the houses; when within a      shirt distance from the last house, three men and a woman      carrying a child, issued forth. One of the men took the infant      from her, and their speed soon convinced us of the futility of      pursuit; the woman, however, did not run so fast. Mr. ----      loosened his provision bag from his back and let it fall, threw      away his gun and hatchet, and set off at a speed that soon      overtook the woman. One man and myself did the same, except our      guns. The rest, picking up our things, followed. On overtaking      the woman, she instantly fell on her kness, and tearing open      the cassock, (a dress composed of deerskin lined with fur,)      showing her breasts to prove that she was a woman, and begged      for mercy. In a few moments we were by Mr. ----'s side. Several      of the Indians, with the three who had quitted the house with      the woman, now advanced, while we retreated towards the shore.      At length we stopped and they did the same. After a pause,      three of them laid down their bows, with which they were armed,      and came within two hundred yards. We then presented our guns,      intimating that not more than one would be allowed to approach.      They retired and fetched their arms, when one, the ill-fated      husband of Mary March, our captive, advanced with a branch of      fir tree (spruce) in his hand. When about ten yards off he      stopped and made a long oration. He spoke at least ten minutes;      towards the last his gesture became very animated, and his eye      \"shot fire.\" He concluded very mildly, and advancing, shook      hands with many of the party--then he attempted to take his      wife from us; being opposed in this he drew from beneath his      cassock an axe, the whole of which was finely polished, and      brandished it over our heads. On two or three pieces being      presented, he gave it up to Mr. ----, who then intimated that      the woman must go with us, but that he might go also if he      pleased, and that in the morning both should have their      liberty. At the same time two of the men began to conduct her      towards the houses. On this being done, he became infuriated,      and rushing towards her strove to drag her from them; one of      the men rushed forward and stabbed him in the back with a      bayonte: turning round, at a blow he laid the fellow at his      feet; the next instant he knocked down another, and rushing on      ----, like a child laid him on his back, and seizing his dirk      from his belt brandished it over his head; the next instant it      would have been buried in him, had I not with both hands      seized his arm; he shook me off in an instant, while I      measured my length on the ice; Mr. ---- then drew a pistol from      his girdle and fired. The poor wretch first staggered, then      fell on his face; while writhing in agonies, he seemed for a      moment to stop; his muscles stiffened: slowly and gradually he      raised himself from the ice, turned round, and with a wild gaze      surveyed us all in a circle around him. Never shall I forget      the figure he exhibited; his hair hanging on each side of his      sallow face; his bushy beard clotted with blood that flowed      from his mouth and nose; his eyes flashing fire, yet with the      glass of death upon them,--they fixed on the individual that      first stabbed him. Slowly he raised the hand that still grasped      young ----'s dagger, till he raised it considerably above his      head, when uttering a yell that made the woods echo, he rushed      at him. The man fired as he advanced, and the noble Indian      again fell on his face: a few moments' struggle, and he lay a      stiffened corpse on the icy surface of the limpid waters.--The      woman for a moment seemed scarcely to notice the corpse; in a      few minutes, however, she showed a little emotion; but it was      not until obliged to leave the remains of her husband that she      gave way to grief, and vented her sorrow in the most      heart-breaking lamentations. While the scene which I have      described was acting, and which occurred in almost less space      than the description can be read, a number of Indians had      advanced within a shore distance, but seeing the untimely fate      of their chief, halted. Mr. ---- fired over their heads, and      they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15126"],["title","Lecture on the Aborigines of Newfoundland (#5)"],["body","fled. The banks of the lake, on the other      side, were at this time covered with men, women, and children,      at least several hundreds; but immediately being joined by      their companions all disappeared in the woods. We then had time      to think. For my own part I could scarcely credit my senses as      I beheld the remains of the noble fellow stretched on the ice,      crimsoned with his already frozen blood. One of the men then      went to the shore for some fir tree boughs to cover the body,      which measured as it lay, 6 feet 7½ inches. The fellow who      first stabbed him wanted to strip off his cassock, (a garment      made of deer skin, lined with beaver and other skins, reaching      to the knees,) but met with so stern a rebuke from ----, that      he instantly desisted, and slunk abashed away.       After covering the body with boughs, we proceeded towards the      Indian houses--the woman often requiring force to take her      along. On examining them, we found no living creature, save a      bitch and her whelps about two months old. The houses of these      Indians are very different from those of the other tribes in      North America; they are built of straight pieces of fir about      twelve feet high, flattened at the sides, and driven in the      earth close to each other; the corners being much stronger than      the other parts.--The crevices are filled up with moss, and the      inside entirely lined with the same material; the roof is      raised so as to slant from all parts and meet in a point at the      centre, where a hole is left for the smoke to escape; the      remainder of the roof is covered with a treble coat of birch      bark, and between the first and second layer of bark is about      six inches of moss; about the chimney clay is substituted for      it. On entering one of the houses I was astonished at the      neatness which reigned within. The sides of the tenement were      covered with arms,--bows, arrows, clubs, axes of iron, (stolen      from the settlers) stone hatchets, arrow heads, in fact,      implements of war and for the chase, but all arranged in the      neatest order, and apparently every man's property carefully      put together. At one end was a small image, or rather a head,      carved rudely out of a block of wood; round the neck was hung      the case of a watch, and on a board close by, the works of the      watch, which had been carefully taken to pieces, and hung on      small pegs on the board; the whole were surrounded with the      main spring. In the other houses the remainder of the articles      stolen were found. Beams were placed across where the roof      began; over which smaller ones were laid: on these were piled a      considerable quantity of dried venison and salmon, together      with a little codfish. On ---- taking down the watch and works,      and bringing the image over the fire, the woman surveyed him      with anger, and in a few minutes made free with her tongue, her      manner showing us that she was not unused to scolding. When Mr.      ---- saw it displeased her, he, rather irreverently, threw the      log on one side: on this she rose in a rage, and would, had not      her hands been fastened, have inflicted summary vengeance for      the insult offered to the hideous idol. Wishing to pacify her,      he rose, and taking his _reverence_ carefully up, placed him      where he had taken him from. This pacified her. I must here do      the poor creature the justice to say, that I never afterwards      saw her out of temper. A watch was set outside; and having      partaken of the Indian's fare, we began to talk over the events      of the day. Both ---- and myself bitterly reproached the man      who first stabbed the unfortunate native; for though he acted      violently, still there was no necessity for the brutal      act--besides, the untaught Indian was only doing that which      every _man_ ought to do,--he came to rescue his wife from the      hands of her captors, and nobly lost his life in his attempt to      save her. ---- here declared that he would rather have      defeated the object of his Journey a hundred times than have      sacrificed the life of one Indian. The fellow merely replied,      \"it was only an Indian, and he wished he had shot a hundred      instead of one.\" The poor woman was now tied securely, we      having, on consideration, deemed it for the best to take her      with us, so that by kind treatment and civilization she might,      in the course of time, be returned to her tribe, and be the      means of effecting a lasting reconciliation between them and      the settlers.       After the men had laid themselves down around the fire, and the      watch was set outside, the door, Mr. ---- and myself remained      up; and, in a low voice, talked over the events of the day. We      then decided on remaining to rest three or four days; and, in      the meantime, to endeavour to find the Indians. I would I could      now describe how insensibly we glided from one subject to      another;--religion--politics--country--'home, _sweet, sweet_,      home'--alternately occupied our attention; and thus, in the      midst of a dreary waste, far away from the haunts of civilized      man, we sat contentedly smoking our pipes; and, Englishmen      like, settled the affairs of _nations_ over a glass of rum and      water--ever and anon drinking a health to each _friend_ and      _fair_, who rose uppermost in our thoughts. From this the      subject turned to \"specific gravity.\" Here an argument      commenced. When illustrating a position I had advanced, by the      ascension of the smoke from my pipe, we both turned up our eyes      to witness its progress upwards: on looking towards the      aperture in the roof what was our astonishment at beholding the      faces of _two Indians_, calmly surveying us in the quiet      occupation of _their_ abode. In an instant we shouted--\"The      Indians!\" and in a moment every one was on the alert, and each      taking his arms rushed to the door--not a creature was to be      seen; in vain we looked around;--no trace, save the marks of      footsteps on the snow, was to be discovered, but these seemed      almost innumerable. We fired about a dozen shots into the      woods, and then retired to our dwelling. ---- and I then      resolved to take alternate watch, and every half hour, at least      to walk round the house. During the night, however, we were not      again disturbed, save by the howling of wolves and barking of      foxes.                                                              E.S.   After the capture of Mary March, the next attempt, in order of time, to discover the Red Indians was made by JAMES CORMACK, Esq., in 1822, and for that purpose he crossed the whole interior of the Island--starting from Random Bar on the Eastward on the 6th September, and finding his way out at St. George's Bay, on the 2nd November following. During this excursion he suffered great privation,--which few men could have endured, and which few men indeed, would have undertaken with only one companion. Mr. Cormack did not succeed in the main object he had in view, yet was his trouble anything but profitless. We now possess through his means a general knowledge of the interior of our Island--together with a specific account of its soil--its geological and mineralogical aspect--its varied natural productions--of trees, shrubs, plants, flowers, &c., all named and methodically described--the kind of animals met with, and a variety of other useful information.  In the following year, 1823, and early in the spring of that year, three females, a mother and two daughters, in Badger Bay, near Exploits Bay, being in a starving condition, allowed themselves in despair, to be quietly captured by some English furriers who accidentally came upon them. Fortunately their miserable appearance, when within gunshot, led to the unusual circumstance of their not being fired at. The husband of the elder woman in attempting to avoid the observation of the white men, tried to cross the creek upon the ice, fell through and was drowned. About a month before this event, and a few miles distant from the spot where this accident occurred, the brother of this man and his daughter, belonging to the same party, were shot by two English furriers. The man was first shot, and the woman in despair remained calmly to be fired at, and incredible as it may appear, this poor woman, far from her tribe--helpless--with her back to her murderers,--excited in them no feeling of compassion--they deliberately shot her,--the slugs passed through her body, and she fell dead by the side of her father. The mind is slow to believe that so brutal an act as this could have been committed, and is willing to doubt the correctness of the report, but the proof of its accuracy is the statement of one of the ruffians who perpetrated the foul act.  The three females were brought to St. John's, where they remained four or five weeks, and were then sent back to the Exploits with many presents, in the hope that they may meet and share such presents with their people. They were conveyed up the river Exploits to some distance, by a party of Europeans, and left on its banks with some provisions and clothing, to find their friends as they best might. Their provisions however were soon consumed, and not finding any of the tribe, they wandered down the right bank of the river, and in a few days again reached the Exploits habitations. The mother and one daughter died there shortly afterwards, and within a few days of each other. The Survivor known as \"Nancy\" here, but among her tribe as \"Shaw-na-dith-it,\" was received and taken care of by Mr. Peyton, jun. and family, with whom she remained several years. She was then brought to St. John's, and as a Society called the \"Boeothick Institution\" had then been established,"]]]
