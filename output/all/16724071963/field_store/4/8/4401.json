Some distance above there were people walking. Shrieks filled the air and roused all within sight to running and shouting. Poor gasping, choking, deadly faced heads bobbed up a moment on the river's surface and went under struggling.  \"Help! Help!\" shouted the running people. \"God save them all! Good Lord! Good Lord!\" And in the midst of it out sprang from among the trees and bushes the great white body of a man, who dashed into the stream and swam like a dolphin.  If he had been clothed the drowning creatures would have had somewhat to drag upon--if he had not been as strong as a giant and cool enough to control them, the poor strangling fools would have so hampered him in their frenzy that they might have dragged him under water with them. But there was a power in him and a freedom from all sense of peril which dominated them all.  \"Keep your senses and you are safe,\" he shouted, swimming and pushing the overturned boat within reach of the men, who struggled together.  His voice rang like a clarion and held in it such encouragement that the poor little bride, who came up gasping near him at that moment, almost took him for a god as he shot to her rescue.  \"Your hand on my shoulder; be brave, my girl--be brave,\" he cried out with such good cheer as would have put heart in any woman and aided her to gather her poor frightened wits and obey him like a child, while even in the midst of her terror, as her little red hands clung to him, she marked, half unconsciously the beauty and vigour of him--his strong white neck like a column, the great corded muscles of his white arms as he clove the water through.  He bore her to the shore and left her safe there, and plunged in again, crying to her, over his shoulder: \"I will bring back the others!\" And she stood dripping, gazing after him, sobbing and wringing her hands, but filled with wild admiration and amaze.  He shouted orders to the sobered men to hold steady to the wherry and dived to bring back one woman after another to firm land; a boat found in the osiers was put forth above, and in time all were brought to shore, though the bridegroom, who had not come near enough to the wherry, was dragged in looking like a dead man.  The bride flung herself upon his body, shrieking and kissing him. The people who had run up crowded about in senseless excitement and would have kept all air away. But there was one among them who had his wits clear and ordered them off, plainly remembering not for a moment that his brocades and laces lay hid among the trees, and he stood among them as Apollo stands in marble.  \"Bring brandy,\" he commanded the nearest. \"Stand back; strip his clothes from him and empty the water from his stomach. Here,\" to a matron who had come up panting, \"take his wife away.\"  The good woman he addressed dropped a hurried curtsey and hustled off the woman under her wing. She led them into the sun and wrung the water from their garments, while they sobbed and choked and wept.  \"Hush thee, wench!\" she said to the stricken bride. \"Hush thee, little fool; my lord Marquess will put life into him and set him on his feet before thy petticoats are dry, Lord! Lord! what a young man! When built Heaven such another? And he a Duke's son!\"  \"A Marquess!\" cried one of the bride's friends. \"A Duke's son!\" sobbed the bride.  \"Ay, a Duke's son!\" the good woman cried, exulting further. \"And were he a King's, the nation might be proud of him. 'Tis his young lordship the Marquess of Roxholm.\"     _CHAPTER VI_  \"_No; She has not yet Come to Court_\"   'Tis but a small adventure for a youth who is a strong swimmer to save a party of cits from drowning in a river, but 'twas a story much repeated, having a picturesqueness and colour because its chief figure Nature had fitted out with all the appointments which might be expected to adorn a hero.  \"'Tis a pretty story, too,\" said a laughing great lady when 'twas talked of in town. \"My lord Marquess dashing in and out of the river, bearing in his big white arms soused little citizen beauties and their half-drowned sweethearts, and towering in their midst giving orders--like a tall young god in marble come to life. The handsomest Marquess in Great Britain, and in France likewise, they tell me.\"  \"The handsomest man,\" quoth the old Dowager Lady Storms, who had a country seat in Oxfordshire and knew more of the tale than any one else. \"The handsomest man, say I, for it chanced that I drove by the river at that moment and saw him.\"  And then--freedom of speech being the fashion in those days and she an old woman--she painted such a picture of his fine looks, his broad shoulders, and the markings of his muscles under his polished skin, as, being repeated and spread abroad, as gossip will spread itself, fixed him in the minds of admirers of manly beauty and built him a reputation in the world of fashion before he had entered it or even left his books.  When he did leave them and quitted the University, it was with honour to himself and family, and also with joy to his Governour and Chaplain Mr. Fox, who had attended him. At his coming of age there were feastings and bonfires in five villages again, and Rowe rang the bells at Camylott Church with an exultant ardour which came near to being his final end, and though seventy years of age, he would give up his post to no younger man, and actually blubbered aloud when 'twas delicately suggested that his middle-aged son should take his place to save him fatigue.  \"Nay! nay!\" he cried; \"I rang their Graces' wedding peal--I rang my lord Marquess into the world, and will give him up to none until I am a dead man.\"  At the Tower there was high feasting, the apartments being filled with guests from foreign Courts as well as from the English one, and as the young hero of the day moved among them, and among the tenantry rejoicing with waving flags and rural games in the park, as he danced with lovely ladies in the ball-room, and as he made his maiden speech to the people, who went wild with joy over him, all agreed that a noble house having such an heir need not fear for its future renown, howsoever glorious its history might have been in the past.  After he had been presented at Court there seemed nothing this young man might not have asked for with the prospect of getting--a place near the King, a regiment to lead to glory, the hand of the fairest beauty of the greatest fortune and rank. But it seemed that he wanted nothing, for he made no request for any favour which might have brought him place or power or love. The great events at that time disturbing the nation he observed with an interest grave and thoughtful beyond his years. Men who were deep in the problems of statesmanship were amazed to discover the seriousness of his views and the amount of reflection he had given to public questions. Beauties who paraded themselves before him to attract his heart and eye--even sweetly tender ones who blushed when he approached them and sighed when he made his obeisance and retired--all were treated with a like courtesy and grace of manner, but he gave none more reason to sigh and blush, to ogle and languish, than another, the honest truth being that he did not fall in love, despite his youth and the warmth of his nature, not having yet beheld the beauty who could blot out all others for him and reign alone.  \"I will not play with love,\" he said to his mother once as they talked intimately to each other. \"I have thought of it--that which should come to a man and be himself, not a part of his being but the very life of him. If it comes not, a man must go unsatisfied to his grave. If it comes--You know,\" he said, and turned and kissed her hand impulsively, \"It came to my father and to you.\"  \"Pray Heaven it may come to you, dear one,\" she said; \"you would know bliss then.\"  \"Yes,\" he answered, \"I should know rapture that would make life Heaven. I do not know what it is I wait for--but when I see it in some woman's eyes I shall know, and so will she.\"  His mother kissed his ringed hair, smiling softly.  \"Till then you wait and think of other things.\"  \"There are so many things for a man to do,\" he said, \"if he would not sit idle. But when that comes it will be first and greatest of all.\"  At this period all the world talked of the wondrous and splendid Churchill, who, having fought brilliantly for the Stuarts and been made by them first Lord Churchill of Eyemouth, and next Baron Churchill of Sandridge, having, after receiving these advancements, the cold astuteness to see the royal fortunes waver perilously, deserted James the Second with stately readiness and transferred his services to William of Orange. He was rewarded with an earldom and such favour as made him the most shining figure both at the Court of England and in the foreign countries which had learned to regard his almost supernatural powers with somewhat approaching awe.  This man inspired Roxholm with a singular feeling; he in fact exercised over him the fascination he exercised over so many others, but in the case of the young Marquess, wonder and admiration were mixed with other emotions. There were stories so brilliant to be heard of him on all sides, stories of other actions so marvellously ruthless and of things so wondrously mean. Upon a bargain so shameless he had built so wondrous a career--a faithfulness of service so magnificent he had closed with a treachery so base. All greatness and all littleness, all heroism and all crimes, seemed to combine themselves in this one strange being. Having shamelessly sold his youth to a King's mistress, he devoted his splendid maturity to a tender, faithful passion for a beauteous virago, whose displeasure was the sole thing on earth which moved him to pain or fear.

FASSETT  GINN AND COMPANY BOSTON - NEW YORK - CHICAGO - LONDON ATLANTA - DALLAS - COLUMBUS - SAN FRANCISCO   COPYRIGHT, 1914, BY JAMES H. FASSETT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED  PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 431.1  The Athenæum Press  GINN AND COMPANY - PROPRIETORS - BOSTON - U.S.A.     PREFACE   In the \"Beacon Second Reader\" the author has chosen for his stories only those of recognized literary merit; and while it has been necessary to rearrange and sometimes rewrite them for the purpose of simplification, yet he has endeavored to retain the spirit which has served to endear these ancient tales to the children of all ages. The fairy story appeals particularly to children who are in the second school year. It has been proved by our ablest psychologists that at about this period of development, children are especially susceptible to the stimulus of the old folklore. They are in fact passing through the stage which corresponds to the dawn of the human race, when demons, dragons, fairies, and hobgoblins were as firmly believed in as rivers and mountains.  As a test of this theory the author asked hundreds of second-grade and third-grade school children to recall the stories which they had read during the preceding year, and to express their preferences. The choice of more than ninety per cent proved to be either folklore stories, pure and simple, or such tales as contained the folklore element. To be sure, children like other stories, but they respond at once with sparkling eyes and animated voices when the fairy tale is suggested. How unwise, therefore, it is to neglect this powerful stimulus which lies ready at our hands! Even a pupil who is naturally slow will wade painfully and laboriously through a fairy story, while he would throw down in disgust an account of the sprouting of the bean or the mining of coal.  It can hardly be questioned, moreover, that the real culture which the child derives from these literary classics is far greater than that which he would gain from the \"information\" stories so common in the average second and third readers.

They were very, very poor, and each day they grew poorer and poorer.  At last there was nothing left in the house but leather for one pair of shoes.  \"I will cut out this last pair of shoes,\" the shoemaker said to his wife.  \"To-morrow I will sew them and peg them.\"  So he cut out the leather and left it on his bench.  The next morning he went into his shop to make the shoes.  What did he see!  A pair of shoes, all nicely made and ready to be sold.  The stitches were so fine and the shoes so well made that they were quickly sold.  With the money the poor shoemaker bought leather for two pairs of shoes.  Then he said to his wife, \"I will cut out the leather for two pairs of shoes.  To-morrow I will sew them and peg them.\"  So he cut out the leather for the shoes and left it on his bench.  The next morning when he went into his shop to make the shoes, what did he find!  [Illustration]  Yes, there were two pairs of shoes already made.  The work was so well done that those shoes were also sold very quickly.  With the money the poor shoemaker bought enough leather for four pairs of shoes.  Those he also cut out and left upon his bench.  The next morning he found four pairs of beautiful shoes, all well made.  And so it went on and on. Instead of being a very poor shoemaker, he became a very rich shoemaker.  His shoes were so well made that even the queen herself wore them.  [Illustration]   THE SHOEMAKER AND THE ELVES--II  At last the shoemaker said to his wife, \"We must find out who makes the shoes.\"  So one bright moonlight night they hid behind a curtain, where they could watch the bench and not be seen.  Just on the stroke of midnight, two little elves jumped through the window.  They went skipping and dancing up to the bench.  Sitting cross-legged they took up the leather and began to work.  How their needles flew back and forth, back and forth!  How their little hammers beat rap-a-tap-tap, rap-a-tap-tap!  Almost before the shoemaker and his wife could think, the work was all done.  The tiny elves ran about, skipping and dancing, skipping and dancing.  Then, whisk! quick as a wink, they were gone.  The next morning the good shoemaker said to his wife, \"What can we do for those dear little elves?\"  \"I should like very much to make some clothes for them,\" said his wife. \"They were almost naked.\"  \"If you will make their coats, I will make them some shoes,\" said the shoemaker. \"Their little feet were bare.\"  When the clothes and shoes were ready, they were put upon the bench.  [Illustration]  The shoemaker and his wife again hid behind the curtain.  Just as before, when the clock struck twelve, in jumped the tiny elves.  They went skipping and dancing, skipping and dancing, to their work.  They saw the little coats, the tiny stockings, and the neat little shoes.  They clapped their hands for joy.  Then, slipping on their clothes, they skipped, hand in hand, out of the window.  The shoemaker and his wife never saw the little elves again, but after that night, good luck seemed always to be with them.  _English Folk Tale_         THE SHIP      laden  move       I saw a ship a-sailing,       A-sailing on the sea;     And, oh, it was all laden       With pretty things for thee!      There were comfits in the cabin,       And apples in the hold;     The sails were made of silk,       And the masts were made of gold.      The four and twenty sailors       That stood between the decks     Were four and twenty white mice,       With chains about their necks.      The captain was a duck,       With a jacket on his back;     And when the ship began to move,       The captain said, \"Quack! quack!\"       _Old English Rhyme_     [Illustration]  THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN YOUNG KIDS--I  quietly  rough    piece  scissors learned  thought  chalk  youngest   There was once an old goat who had seven little kids.  She loved them all as much as any mother ever loved her children.  One day the old goat wished to go into the woods to get food for her kids.  Before she started she called them all to her and said:  \"Dear children, I am going into the woods.  Now do not open the door while I am away.  If the old wolf should get into our hut, he would eat you all up, and not a hair would be left.  You can easily tell him by his rough voice and his black feet.\"  \"Dear mother,\" cried all the young kids, \"we will be very careful not to let the old wolf in.  You need not think of us at all, for we shall be quite safe.\"  So the old goat went on her way into the dark woods.  She had not been gone long when there came a loud rap at the door, and a voice cried:  \"Open the door, my dear children. I have something here for each of you.\"  But the young kids knew by the rough voice that this was the old wolf.  So one of them said, \"We shall not open the door. Our mother's voice is soft and gentle. Your voice is rough. You are a wolf.\"  The old wolf ran away to a shop, where he ate a piece of white chalk to make his voice soft.  Then he went back to the goat's hut and rapped at the door.  He spoke in a soft voice and said, \"Open the door for me, my dear children. I am your mother.\"  But the oldest little goat thought of what his mother had said.  \"If you are our mother, put your foot on the window sill, that we may see it.\"  When the wolf had done this, all the little goats cried out, \"No, you are not our mother.
