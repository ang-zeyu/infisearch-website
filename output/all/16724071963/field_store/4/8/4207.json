Is it you? Is--\"  She stopped, for the man had placed a finger on his lip and was pointing to the door.  \"Take a look down the road,\" he ordered, in a guarded voice; and, when she had reached a point commanding the danger zone, he asked, \"See anybody?--soldiers?\" She shook her head. \"Hear anything?\"  She stood for a moment listening, then ran to him, and sprang into his waiting arms.  \"It's all right, Daddy! It's all right now!\"  He raised her, strained her to his breast, his cheek against her own.  \"My little girl!\" he murmured between his kisses. \"My little rebel!\" And as she snuggled in his arms, her berry-stained fingers clasped tightly about his neck, he asked her wistfully, \"Did you miss me?--_awful_ much?\"  \"Yes,\" she nodded, looking into his eyes. \"Yes--in the night time--when the wind was talkin'; but, after while, when--Why, Daddy!\" He had staggered as he set her down, sinking into a chair and closing his eyes as he leaned on the table's edge. \"You are hurt!\" she cried. \"I--I can see the blood!\"  The wounded Southerner braced himself.  \"No, dear, no,\" he strove to reassure her. \"It isn't anything; only a little scratch--from a Yank--that tried to get me. But he didn't, though,\" the soldier added with a smile. \"I'm just--tired.\"  The child regarded him in wondering awe, speaking in a half-breathed whisper:  \"Did he--did he _shoot_ at you?\"  Her father nodded, with his hand on her tumbled hair.  \"Yes, honey, I'm afraid he did; but I'm so used to it now I don't mind it any more. Get me a drink of water, will you?\" As Virgie obeyed in silence, returning with the dripping gourd, the man went on: \"I tried to get here yesterday; but I couldn't. They chased me when I came before--and now they're watching.\" He paused to sip at his draught of water, glancing toward the carriage road. \"Big fight down the river. Listen! Can you hear the guns?\"  \"Yes, plain,\" she answered, tilting her tiny head. \"An' las' night, when I went to bed, I could hear 'em--oh! ever so loud: Boom! Boom! Boom-boom! So I knelt up an' asked the Lord not to let any of 'em hit you.\"  Two arms, in their tattered gray, slipped round the child. He kissed her, in that strange, fierce passion of a man who has lost his mate, and his grief-torn love is magnified in the mite who reflects her image and her memory.  \"Did you, honey?\" he asked, with a trembling lip. \"Well, I reckon that saved your daddy, for not one shell touched him--no, not one!\" He kissed her again, and laughed. \"And I tell you, Virgie, they were coming as thick as bees.\"  Once more he sipped at the grateful, cooling draught of water, when the child asked suddenly:  \"How is Gen'ral Lee?\"  Down came the gourd upon the table. The Southerner was on his feet, with a stiffened back; and his dusty slouch hat was in his hand.  \"He's well; God bless him! Well!\"  The tone was deep and tender, proud, but as reverent as the baby's prayer for her father's immunity from harm; yet the man who spoke sank back into his seat, closing his eyes and repeating slowly, sadly:  \"He's well; God bless him! But he's tired, darling--mighty tired.\"  \"Daddy,\" the soldier's daughter asked, \"will you tell him somethin'--from me?\"  \"Yes, dear. What?\"  \"Tell him,\" said the child, with a thoughtful glance at Miss Susan Jemima across the table, \"tell him, if he ever marches along this way, I'll come over to his tent and rub his head, like I do yours--if he'll let me--till he goes to sleep.\" She clasped her fingers and looked into her father's eyes, hopefully, appealingly. \"Do you think he would, if--if I washed my hands--real clean?\"  The Southerner bit his lip and tried to smile.  \"Yes, honey, I know he would! And think! He sent a message--to _you_.\"  \"Did he?\" she asked, wide-eyed, flushed with happiness. \"What did he say, Daddy? What?\"  \"He said,\" her father answered, taking her hands in his: \"'She's a brave little soldier, to stay there all alone. Dixie and I are proud of her!'\"  \"Oh, Daddy, did he? Did he?\"  \"Yes, dear, yes,\" the soldier nodded; \"his very words. And look!\" From his boot leg he took a folded paper and spread it on his knee. \"He wrote you a pass--to Richmond. Can you read it?\"  Virgie leaned against her father's shoulder, studying the paper long and earnestly; then, presently looked up, with a note of grave but courteous hesitation in her tone:  \"Well--he--well, the Gen'ral writes a awful bad hand, Daddy.\"  Her father laughed in genuine delight, vowing in his heart to tell his general and friend of this crushing criticism, if ever the fates of war permitted them to meet again.  \"Dead right!\" he agreed, with hearty promptness. \"But come, I'll read it for you. Now then. Listen:      \"HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VA.      \"_Pass Virginia Cary and escort through all Confederate lines and     give safe-conduct wherever possible._      \"R.E. LEE, _General_.\"  There was silence for a moment, then Virgie looked up, with tears in her eyes and voice.  \"An' he did that--for little _me_? Oh, Daddy, I love him so much, it--it makes me want to cry.\"  She hid her face on the coat of gray, and sobbed; while her father stroked her hair and answered soothingly, but in a tone of mourning reverie:  \"So do we all, darling; big grown men, who have suffered, and are losing all they love. They are ragged--and wounded--hungry--and, oh, so tired! But, when they think of _him_, they draw up their belts another hole, and say, '_For General Lee!_' And then they can fight and fight and fight--till their hearts stop beating--and the god of battles writes them a bloody pass!\"  Again he had risen to his feet. He was speaking proudly, in the reckless passion of the yet unconquered Southerner, only half-conscious of the tot who watched him, wondering. So she came to him quickly, taking his hand in both her own, and striving to bring him comfort from the fountain of her little mother-heart.  \"Don't you worry, Daddy-man. We'll--we'll whip 'em yet.\"  \"No, dear--no,\" he sighed, as he dropped into his seat. \"We won't. It's hard enough on men; but harder still on children such as you.\" He turned to her gravely, earnestly: \"Virgie, I had hoped to get you through to Richmond--to-day. But I can't. The Yankees have cut us off. They are up the river and down the river--and all around us, I've been nearly the whole night getting here; creeping through the woods--like an old Molly-cotton-tail--with the blue boys everywhere, waiting to get me if I showed my head.\"  \"But they didn't, did they?\" said Virgie, laughing at his reference to the wise old rabbit and feeling for the pockets of his shabby coat, \"Did you--did you bring me anything?\"  At her question the man cried out as if in pain, then reached for her in a wave of yearning tenderness.  \"Listen, dear; I--I had a little bundle for you--of--of things to eat.\" He took her by the arms, and looked into her quaint, wise face, \"And I was so glad I had it, darling, for you are thinner than you were.\" He paused to bite his lip, and continued haltingly, \"There was bread in that bundle--and meat--real meat--and sugar--and tea.\"  Virgie released herself and clapped her hands.  \"Oh, Daddy, where is it?\" she asked him happily, once more reaching for the pocket. \"'Cause I'm _so_ hungry for somethin' good.\"  \"Don't! Don't!\" he cried, as he drew his coat away, roughly, fiercely, in the pain of unselfish suffering. \"For Daddy's sake, don't!\"  \"Why, what is it, Daddy,\" she asked, in her shrillness of a child's alarm, her eyes on the widening stain of red above his waist. \"Is--is it hurtin' you again? What is it, Daddy-man?\"  \"Your bundle,\" he answered, in the flat, dull tone of utter hopelessness. \"I lost it, Virgie. I lost it.\"  \"Oh,\" she said, with a quaver of disappointment, which she vainly strove to hide. \"How did you do it?\"  For a moment the man leaned limply against a chair-back, hiding his eyes with one trembling hand; then he spoke in shamed apology:  \"I--I couldn't help it, darling; because, you see, I hadn't any powder left; and I was coming through the woods--just as I told you--when the Yanks got sight of me.\" He smiled down at her bravely, striving to add a dash of comedy to his tragic plight. \"And I tell you, Virgie, your old dad had to run like a turkey--wishing to the Lord he had wings, too.\"  Virgie did not smile in turn, and her father dropped back into his former tone, his pale lips setting in a straight, hard line.  \"And then--the blue boy I was telling you about--when he shot at me, I must have stumbled, because, when I scrambled up, I--I couldn't see just right; so I ran and ran, thinking of you, darling, and wanting to get to you before--well, before it was breakfast time. I had your bundle in my pocket; but when I fell--why, Virgie, don't you see?--I--I couldn't go back and find it.\" He paused to choke, then spoke between his teeth, in fury at a strength which had failed to breast a barrier of fate: \"But I _would_ have gone back, if I'd had any powder left. I _would_ have! I would!\"  A pitiful apology it was, from a man to a little child; a story told only in its hundredth part, for why should he give its untold horrors to a baby's ears? How could she understand that man-hunt in the early dawn? The fugitive--with an empty pistol on his hip--wading swamps and plunging through the tangled underbrush; alert and listening, darting from tree to tree where the woods were thin; crouching behind some fallen log to catch his laboring breath, then rising again to creep along his way. He did not tell of the racking pain in his weary legs, nor the protest of his pounding heart--the strain--the agony--the puffs of smoke that floated above the pines, and the ping of bullets whining through the trees. He did not tell of the ball that slid along his ribs, leaving a fiery, aching memory behind, as the man crashed down a clay bank, to lie for an instant in a crumpled heap, to rise and stumble"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15414"],["title","The Littlest Rebel (#8)"],["body","--not toward the haven of his own Confederate lines, but forward, to where a baby waited--through a dancing mist of red.  And so the soldier made his poor apology, turning his head away to avoid a dreaded look in Virgie's big, reproachful eyes; then he added one more lashwelt to his shame:  \"And now your poor old daddy is no more use to you. I come to my little girl with empty hands--with an empty gun--and an empty heart!\"  He said it bitterly, in the self-accusing sorrow of his soul; and his courage, which had borne him through a hell of suffering, now broke; but only when a helper of the helpless failed. He laid his outflung arms across the table. He bowed his beaten head upon them and sobbed aloud, with sobs that shook him to his heels.  It was then that Virgie came to him again, a little daughter of the South, who, like a hundred thousand of her sisters, brought comfort in the blackest hours.  One tiny, weak arm was slipped about his neck. One tiny brown hand, with its berry-stained fingers, was run through his tangled hair, softly, tenderly, even as she longed to soothe the weary head of General Lee.  \"Don't cry, Daddy-man,\" she murmured in his ear; \"it's all right. _I_ can eat the blackberries. They--they don't taste so _awful_ good when you have 'em _all_ the time; but _I_ don't mind.\" She paused to kiss him, then tried once more to buoy his hope and hers. \"We'll have jus' heaps of things when we get to Richmon'--jus' heaps--an' then--\"  She stopped abruptly, lifting her head and listening, in the manner of a sheep dog scenting danger from afar. Her father looked up sharply and gripped her hands.  \"Virgie! You hear--_what_?\"  \"Horses! Oh, a lot of 'em! On the big road!\"  It was true, for down the breeze came the faintly echoed thud of many hoofs and the clinking jingle of sabers against the riders' thighs. Virgie turned back from the open door.  \"Why--why, they've turned into _our_ road!\" Her breath came fast, as she sank her voice to a faint, awed whisper, \"Daddy--do you reckon it's--_Yankees_?\"  \"Yes,\" said her father, who had risen to his feet. \"Morrison's cavalry! They won't hurt _you_; but I'll have to get to the woods again! Good-by, honey! Good-by!\"  He kissed her hurriedly and started for the door, but shrank into the shadow at sight of a blue-clothed watcher sharply outlined on the crest of a distant rise. Escape was cut off, and the hunted soldier turned to Virgie in his need.  \"Shut the door--quick!\" She obeyed in silence. \"Lock it!\" She turned the rusty key, and waited. \"Now the windows! Hurry, but do it quietly.\"  She closed the clumsy shutters and set the heavy bars into their slots; then the man came forward, knelt down before her and took her hands.  \"Listen, Virginia,\" he whispered earnestly; \"don't you remember how your dear, dear mother--and I, too, darling--always told you never to tell a lie?\"  \"An' I haven't, Daddy-man,\" she protested, wondering. \"'Deed, an' 'deed, I haven't. Why--\"  \"Yes, yes, I know,\" he interrupted hurriedly; \"but now--_you must_!\" As the child stepped backward and tried to draw away, he clasped her hands more tightly still. \"But listen, dear; it's to save _me_! Don't you understand?--and it's _right_! When those men come, they mustn't find me. Say I _was_ here, but I've gone. If they ask which way, tell them I went down past the spring--through the blackberry patch. Do you understand?--and can you remember?\" She nodded gravely, and the Southerner folded her tightly in his arms. \"Be a brave little rebel, honey--_for me_!\"  He released her and began to mount the ladder leading to the scuttle in the ceiling; but halfway up he paused, as Virgie checked him with a solemn question:  \"Daddy--would Gen'ral Lee want me to tell that lie?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" he answered slowly, thoughtfully; \"this once! And, if ever you see him, ask him, and he'll tell you so himself. God help you, darling; it's for General Lee--and _you_!\"  The littlest rebel sighed, as though a weight had been lifted from her mind, and she cocked her head at the sound of louder hoof-beats on the carriage road.  \"All right, Daddy-man. I'll tell--a _whopper_!\"     CHAPTER V   The man crawled up through the scuttle hole and disappeared; then drew the ladder after him and closed the trap, while Virgie tiptoed to the table and slipped into a seat.  The cabin was now in semi-darkness, except for a shaft of sunlight entering through the jagged wound from the cannon-shot above the door; and it fell on the quaint, brown head of little Miss Virginia Cary, and the placid form of Susan Jemima, perching opposite, in serene contempt of the coming of a conquering host.  The jingling clank of sabers grew louder to the listeners' ears, through the rumble of pounding hoofs; a bugle's note came winnowing across the fields, and Virgie leaned forward with a confidential whisper to her doll:  \"Susan Jemima, I wouldn't tell anybody else--no, not for anything--but I cert'n'y am awful scared!\"  There came a scurrying rush, a command to halt, and a rustling, scraping noise of dismounting men; a pause, and the sharp, loud rap of a saber hilt against the door. Virgie breathed hard, but made no answer.  \"Open up!\" called a voice outside, but the little rebel closed her lips and sat staring at Susan Jemima across the table. A silence followed, short, yet filled with dread; then came a low-toned order and the crash of carbine butts on the stout oak door. For a time it resisted hopefully, then slowly its top sagged in, with a groaning, grating protest from its rusty hinges; it swayed, collapsed in a cloud of dust--and the enemy swept over it.  They came with a rush; in the lead an officer, a naked saber in his fist, followed by a squad of grim-faced troopers, each with his carbine cocked and ready for discharge. Yet, as suddenly as they had come, they halted now at the sight of a little lady, seated at table, eating berries, as calmly as though the dogs of war had never even growled.  A wondering silence followed, till broken by a piping voice, in grave but courteous reproof:  \"I--I don't think you are very polite.\"  The officer in command was forced to smile.  \"I'm sorry, my dear,\" he apologized; \"but am afraid, this time, I can't quite help it.\" He glanced at the door of the adjoining room and turned to his waiting men, though speaking in an undertone: \"He's in there, I guess. Don't fire if you can help it--on account of the baby. Now then! Steady, boys! Advance!\"  He led the way, six troopers following, while the rest remained behind to guard the cabin's open door. Virgie slowly turned her head, with eyes that watched the officer's every move; then presently she called:  \"Hey, there! That's _my_ room--an' don't you-all bother any of my things, either!\"  This one command, at least, was implicitly obeyed, for in a moment the disappointed squad returned. The carbine butts were grounded; the troopers stood at orderly attention, while their officer stepped toward the table.  \"What's your name, little monkey?\"  Virgie raised her eyes in swift reproach.  \"I don't like to be called a monkey. It--it isn't respectful.\"  The Union soldier laughed.  \"O-ho! I see.\" He touched his hat and made her a sweeping bow. \"A thousand pardons, Mademoiselle.\" He shot his sword into its scabbard, and laughed again. \"Might I inquire as to what you are called by your--er--justly respectful relatives and friends?\"  \"Virgie,\" she answered simply.  \"Ah,\" he approved, \"and a very pretty name! Virgie what?\"  \"My whole name is Miss Virginia Houston Gary.\"  The soldier started, glanced at his troopers, then back to the child again:  \"Is Herbert Cary your father?\"  He waited for her answer, and got it, straight from a baby's shoulder:  \"_Mister_ Herbert Cary is--yes, sir.\"  The enemy smiled and made her another bow.  \"I stand corrected. Where is your father now?\"  Virgie hesitated.  \"I--I don't know.\"  The voice of her inquisitor took on a sterner tone:  \"Is he here?--hiding somewhere? Tell me!\"  Her little heart was pounding, horribly, and the hot blood came into her cheeks; but she looked him squarely in the face, and lied--for General Lee:  \"No, sir. Daddy _was_ here--but he's gone away.\"  The enemy was looking at her, intently, and his handsome, piercing eyes, grew most uncomfortable. She hung for an instant between success and sobbing failure, till a bubble from Mother Eve rose up in her youthful blood and burst into a spray of perfect feminine deceit. She did not try to add to her simple statement, but began to eat her berries, calmly, as though the subject were completely closed.  \"Which way did he go?\" the officer demanded, and she pointed with her spoon.  \"Down by the spring--through the blackberry patch.\"  The soldier was half-convinced. He stood for a moment, looking at the floor, then asked her sharply, suddenly:  \"If your father had gone, then why did you lock that door?\"  She faltered, but only for an instant.  \"'Cause I thought you might be--_niggers_.\"  The man before her clenched his hands, as he thought of that new-born, hideous danger menacing the South.  \"I see,\" he answered gently; \"_yes_, I see.\" He turned away, but, even as he turned, his eye was caught by the double-doored cupboard against the wall. \"What do you keep in there?\" he asked; and the child smiled faintly, a trifle sadly, in reply:  \"We _used_ to keep things to eat--when we had any.\"  He noted her mild evasion, and pushed the point.  \"What is in it now?\"  \"Tin pans.\"  \"Anything else?\"  \"Er--yes, sir.\"  He caught his breath and stepped a little nearer, bending till his face was close to hers.  \"What?\"  \"Colonel Mosby,\" declared the mite, with a most emphatic nod; \"an' you better look out, too!\"  The officer laughed as he turned to his grinning squad.  \"Bright little youngster! Still, I think we'll have a look.\" He dropped his air of amusement, growing stern again. \"Now, men! Ready!\"  They swung into line and faced the cupboard, the muzzles of their carbines trained upon it, while their"]]]
