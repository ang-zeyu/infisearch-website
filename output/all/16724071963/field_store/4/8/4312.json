Ethel Blue, who had been in his confidence, was the only one of the young people who glanced at her, however, so her annoyance passed unnoticed.  \"He isn't, and a piano is out of the question.  I wonder, if Greg Patton would bring his fiddle?\"  \"Why didn't we think of him before!  He and some of the other high school boys have been getting up a little orchestra; I shouldn't wonder a bit if they'd be glad to help--glad of the experience of playing in public.\"  \"We haven't got to make oceans of paper roses, this time,\" remarked Ethel Brown gratefully.  \"Nature is doing the work for us.\"  She waved her hand at the clump of bushes which was to conceal Dorothy's fortune telling operations, and which was pink with blossoms.  \"Our bushes at home are loaded down with them, too,\" said Margaret. \"Everybody's are, so I don't suppose it would be worth while to have a flower table.\"  \"There's no harm in trying.  We could say on the poster that exceptionally choice roses will be on exhibition and sale and--and why couldn't we take orders for the bushes?  Use the beauties for samples and if people like them, get roots from the bushes they came from and supply them the next day!\"  Ethel Blue was quite breathless with the force of this suggestion and the others applauded it.  \"Just as I think of Ethel Blue as all imagination and dreams she comes out with something practical like that and I have to study her all over again,\" said Roger, observing his cousin with his head on one side. Ethel Blue threw a leaf at him which he dodged with exaggerated fear.  They decided to have the Rose Fête just as soon as the boys put the house into presentable condition, and then the girls separated, Ethel Brown and Dorothy to see Mr. Emerson about securing the boxes, Helen and Margaret to measure the windows for curtains, Delia and Ethel Blue to work out the design for converting ordinary Chinese lanterns into roses which they had thought of as lending a charm to the veranda and the lawn after the sun went down, and the boys to calculate the quantities of putty and paint and color-wash, based on information given Roger by the local painter and decorator, who was quite willing to help with advice when he found that there was no chance of his own services being called into play.     CHAPTER V  THE ROSE FÊTE  The United Service Club had made so good a name for itself in Rosemont during the few months of its existence that when Ethel Blue's posters brought to their doors the news that the U. S. C.  was to give a Rose Fête at Rose House the townspeople were eager to know what attraction the members had devised.  The schools were still in session so the Ethels and Dorothy at the graded school and Helen and Roger and the orchestra boys at the high school made themselves into an advertising band and told everybody all about the purpose of the festival.  The scholars carried the information home, and there were few houses in Rosemont where it was not known that Mr. Emerson's old farmhouse was to be turned into a summer home for weary mothers and ailing babies.  Helen and Margaret, after consulting with their mothers and Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Emerson, had decided that a cot or single bed and two cribs ought to go in each bedroom except Moya's, where one crib would be enough.  This meant that five beds and nine cribs must be provided, and the number made the girls look serious as they calculated the probable proceeds of the Rose Fête and subtracted from them the amount that they would have to pay the local furniture dealer, even though he, being a public spirited and charitable man, offered them a discount.  For a day or two they went about in a state of depression, for they had hoped to be able to supply the furnishings without making any appeal to the grownups.  Thanks to Dorothy they could discount any expense for bureaus and desks and tables, but their ambition did not soar to constructing bedsteads; these had to be bought or given.  It became evident after a number of householders had inquired how they could help, that there was a chance that the U. S. C. treasury might not be reduced after all by the purchase of beds.  When one lady was informed by Helen of their schemes for filling the rooms--how the carpenters had provided them with a table that would do for the dining-room and how shelves innumerable were to do duty for innumerable purposes,--and she had added ruefully, \"But we can't make very good beds, and we do want the women to sleep well, poor things.  We've got to buy those--\" she had cried, \"Why, I have a cot in my attic that I should be _delighted_ to let you have, and my daughter's little boy has outgrown his crib and I'm sure she'll contribute that.\"  A week before the Fête, however, they had been promised all the bedsteads they needed--though some lacked springs, some mattresses, and almost all were without pillows--four cribs, half a dozen chairs and two high chairs, and a collection of odd pieces.  Helen refused nothing but double beds; there was not space enough for those in a bedroom with three people in it; it would seem to the women too much like the crowded tenements they came from, she thought.  Miss Merriam objected also, on the ground that it was not well for babies to sleep with grown people.  \"What do you think of this plan?\" Ethel Brown asked her mother after the girls had made a careful list of their gifts.  \"We did think that if we didn't have a stick in the house the people would be interested in helping us because of our poverty.  We've found out that they are awfully interested even without seeing the house.  Do you think it would be a good scheme to put into the rooms the things we have ready and to fasten on the door a notice saying     'THIS ROOM NEEDS' and under that a list of what is lacking?  Don't you think some of them would say, 'I've got an extra cushion at home that would do for a pillow here; I'll send it over'; or 'Don't you remember that three legged chair that used to be in Joe's room?  I believe these children can mend it and paint it to look well enough for this room'?\"  \"Ethel Brown, you're running Ethel Blue hard in the line of ideas!\" cried Roger admiringly from a position at the door which he had taken as he passed through the hall and heard discussion going on.  \"It's a capital idea,\" agreed Mrs. Morton.  \"You'd better ask Grandfather again for a wagon and go around and collect the things that have been promised.  You don't want to bother people to send them over themselves.\"  Every one worked with vigor during the last few days before the festival, for the renovating of old furniture takes more time than any one ever expects it to.  The results were so satisfactory, however, that neither the boys nor the girls gave a thought to their tired hands and backs when evening brought them release from their labors.  The great day was clear, and, for the last of June, cool.  Every plan worked out well and every helper appeared at the moment he was wanted. The box seats and tables, superintended by Ethel Brown and served by half a dozen friends all wearing white dresses and pink aprons, bloomed rosily on the veranda.  Under the large rose Delia and Ethel Blue, dressed in pink, sold fancy articles.  Dorothy, sitting \"under the rose\" in the rose jungle, and dressed like a moss rose, with a filmy green tunic draping her pink frock, described brilliant futures to laughing inquirers.  Margaret, dressed to represent the yellow Scottish roses, sold flowers from the Ethels' garden and took orders for rose bushes.  The boys were everywhere, opening ice cream tubs for Moya in the background, guiding would-be players to the tennis court and the croquet ground, and directing new arrivals where to tie their horses and park their motors.  Every member of the club was provided with a small notebook wherein to jot down any bit of advice that was offered and seemed profitable or to record any offer of fittings that might be made.  Helen took no regular duty, leaving herself free to go over the house with any one who wanted to know the Club's plans, and she had more frequent need than any of the others to use her book.  Ethel Brown's scheme had been followed.  On the door of each room was posted a list of articles needed to complete the furnishing of that room.  \"They certainly aren't greedy!\" exclaimed one matron after reading the notice.  \"This says that this room is complete except for bed clothing.\"  She waved her hand around with some scorn.  Helen dimpled with amusement.  \"We thought we'd make one room as nearly complete as we could,\" she explained.  \"You see this has a bed, two cribs, a looking-glass, and shelves as substitutes for a washstand and a closet and a table and a bureau.  \"There are no chairs, child!\"  \"These two boxes are the chairs.  We had a few chairs given us but they'll be needed down stairs.  We think they'll have more exercise than any chairs ever had before.  They'll be used in the dining-room for breakfast, and then they'll be moved to the veranda to spend the morning, and in they'll come again for dinner and out they'll go for the afternoon, and in for supper, and after supper they'll be moved into the hall which is to serve as the sitting room!\"  Helen's hearer pressed her hand to her head.  \"You make me positively dizzy!\" she exclaimed.  \"At any rate I'd like to make this room complete according to your notions, so I'll send you some sheets and pillow cases and blankets and a spread if you'll allow me.\"  \"We'll be glad to have them,\" accepted Helen, beaming.  \"Roger will call for them if that will be more convenient for you,\" and she made a note of the gift and the time when it should be sent after.  Other women remembered as they examined the door lists that they had a mattress that could be spared, or a pillow or two or a pair of summer blankets.  \"What are you going to do for ornaments,\" asked another.  Helen laughed.  \"James Hancock has an idea for decorating the walls so that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15550"],["title","Ethel Morton at Rose House (#5)"],["body","hey'll interest the babies, and we're going to have fresh cheese-cloth curtains at all the windows, but that's the end of our possibilities.\"  \"I have several bureau scarves that are in good condition but they have been washed so many times that they're a little faded.  If you'd like those--?\" she ended with an upward inflection.  \"We would,\" replied Helen promptly.  \"Could you use some prints of pictures--good paintings?\" inquired yet another, a person whose taste Helen knew could be trusted.  \"We'd be glad of them.  We can frame them in passepartout.  We'd be especially glad of madonnas.\"  \"That's just what I was going to offer you.  A club I once belonged to studied celebrated paintings of madonnas one winter and I made this collection.  Many of them are only penny prints and some are cut from magazines--\".  \"They're perfectly good for us,\" Helen reassured her, and made another note in her book.  Most of the visitors went home with the falling dark, but some stayed to see the rose lanterns lighted, and others, who had not been able to come in the afternoon, drove or walked out from town in the evening and were served with ice cream and strawberries from a supply that had been wonderfully well calculated.  \"Let us have just a week to spend this money and to make up the sheets and pillow cases and curtains and you can tell Mr. Watkins to send out the women,\" Helen announced triumphantly to Delia.  \"I'm going to spend the week with Margaret so I can come over with her every day and help,\" returned smiling Delia.  \"Then we shan't need a whole week.  When you go home to-night please ask your father to be making his selection--four mothers with two children apiece.  You and Tom can escort them out on the Tuesday after Fourth of July.\"     CHAPTER VI  FURNITURE MAKING  It did not take the women long to adjust themselves to life at Rose House, and as for the children, they loved it from the first.  It was a great international gathering that was sheltered on the old farm.  Mrs. Schuler was German; Moya, Irish.  Mrs. Peterson, a Swede, occupied the rooster room with her baby and her flaxen-haired daughter of three; Mrs. Paterno, an Italian, found good pasturage among the cows of the violet room for her black-eyed boys of two and four; Mrs. Tsanoff, a Bulgarian, told the Matron that her twin girl babies were too young to pay attention to the kittens on the curtains of the yellow room; while Mrs. Vereshchagin, a Russian, discovered that the puppies of the blue room were a great help to her in holding the attention of her boys of three and five when she was putting them to bed.  Mrs. Schuler shook her head doubtfully when she took down their names and nationalities in her notebook on the day of their arrival.  \"If we get through the summer without quarrels over the war it will be a miracle!\" she exclaimed to her husband.  But she found that the poor creatures were too weary, too sad, too physically crushed to have spirit enough left to fight any battles, even those of words.  With almost every one of them there had been a tragedy such as often comes to the immigrants who reach the United States equipped for success only with strong muscles--a tragedy of wasted hope and broken courage and failing vigor if not of death.  Mrs. Paterno was the only one of them who could sympathize with Moya's widowhood; her husband had seen the Black Hand death sign a few months before, had disregarded it and had been stabbed in the back one night as he came home from his work.  Conversation was not carried on fluently among them.  They met on the common ground of English, but not one of them could speak it well, each one translated phrases of her own tongue quite literally, and the meaning of the whole talk was largely a matter of guesswork.  What they did understand was nature's language of motherhood.  They were content to sit for hours on the veranda or in the grove or behind the house, preparing vegetables for Moya, chattering about their babies and explaining their meaning by gestures that seemed to be perfectly understood.  The women had daily duties to perform according to a schedule worked out by Mrs. Schuler, who apportioned to each a share of the general work of the house in addition to the care of her own room and the washing for herself and her children.  With so many fingers flying the tasks were soon done, and then they sat on the porch or in the grove among the sweet-smelling pines, or walked in the pasture or up and down the lane leading to the main road.  Once in a while they went to Rosemont, but for the most part they were too languid to care to walk far and too glad of the change and the rest and quiet to want to weary themselves unnecessarily.  The boys had built a platform across the back of the house, and it was here that they did their carpentry, an awning sheltering them from the sun or rain.  A cupboard at one end held their tools, and their partly finished articles were neatly stacked in a corner.  As they got out their tools now James made a confession.  \"To tell you the honest, unvarnished truth, I'm tired of making chairs. It seems as if we'd never have enough.\"  \"It takes an awful lot to furnish a house,\" commented Roger wisely, \"and you know we had very few given us so if we want enough we have to make them.\"  \"We've got all the chairs you've done upholstered all they're going to be,\" said Ethel Brown.  \"Why can't Ethel Blue and I each make a high chair?\"  \"No reason at all,\" agreed Roger quickly.  \"You've watched James and me and seen our really superior workmanship; imitate it, my child!\"  The girls were already turning over the boys' supply of boxes to select those suitable for the chairs for the children.  They took four that had held lemons or other fruit and were tall and narrow when stood on end.  The boards they were made of were very light but quite solid enough to hold the weight of a small child.  To make it firm upon the ground, however, they sawed a piece of heavy plank a little larger than the end upon which the box was to stand and nailed it on from the inside.  When the high chair was done the boys complimented their co-workers on the success of their first experiment.  \"I hardly could have done it better myself,\" said Roger grandly.  All the high chairs were covered with blue and white cretonne to match the blue and white of the dining room and the girls set to work to tack on the outside covering and to cut out the covers of the small cushions that were to make the seat and back comfortable.  The cushions themselves they had made from ticking filled with excelsior when they had calculated the number of high chairs they must have.  The boys, meanwhile were constructing two chairs of quite different build.  One was a heavy chair for the hall or the veranda, its original condition being a packing box a foot and a half deep, about twenty inches wide and three or four feet long.  This also was set on end, and the other end and the cover were laid aside to be used in making the seat and in shutting in the openings below the seat.  \"How are you going to fasten that seat so it won't let the sitter down on the floor?\" inquired Ethel Blue, as James explained what he was going to do.  \"Do you see these cleats, ma'am?  These are each a foot long.  I nail one of these standing up straight at each edge of the sides and the back--six of them altogether.  Then I lay three other cleats across their tops--thusly.\"  \"O, you've made a sort of framework that will support the seat!  I get that!\" exclaimed Ethel Blue.  \"All you have to do now is to nail your seat boards on to those horizontal cleats and it's as firm as firm can be.\"  \"Aren't you going to do something with those sides--those arms, or whatever you call them?\" inquired Ethel Brown.  \"They seem sharp and uncomfortable and in the way to me.\"  Both boys studied the chair seriously before answering.  Then they took a pencil and paper and consulted.  \"I should think it would look pretty well to cut out a right angle on each aide,\" suggested James.  \"That would leave a sort of wing effect like a hall porter's chair, only not so high, and at the same time it would make an arm to rest your elbow on.  How does that strike you ?\"  Roger nodded.  \"It hits me all right.  I was thinking of a curve instead of a right angle, but the right angle will be easier to make. Go ahead.\"  So the right angle was decided on and James proceeded to cut it.  Roger, meanwhile, had been sorting out the wood he needed for a chair of another pattern.  \"I wish Dorothy would heave in sight,\" he growled as he piled some half inch thick strips in one heap.  \"She told me she'd tell me all she knew about chair legs when I reached this stage of proceedings.\"  \"She will,\" answered a cheerful voice, and gray-eyed Dorothy appeared from the house.  \"I felt in my bones that you'd be beginning this lot this afternoon, so I ambled over to see if I could help in any way.\"  \"Keep right on ambling till you reach this end of the platform and tell me whether you said that chair legs could be made of this stripping or whether I'll have to get solid pieces, square-ended, you know, joist or scantling or whatever it's called.\"  \"Strips will do, only you'll have to use two for each leg.  Nail them together at right angles.  It will make a two-sided leg, but it will be plenty strong enough, though perhaps not truly handsome.\"  \"If handsomeness means solidity--no.  Still, they'll do.  Can you give me the lengths for these strips?\" and Roger waved his saw at his cousin as if he were so impatient to begin that he could not wait to study out the lengths for himself.  \"For the one I made for the attic,\" replied his cousin, \"I cut four strips each two inches wide and twenty-one inches long for the front legs and four strips each two inches wide and twenty-five inches long for the back legs.  Then there were two two-inch strips seventeen inches long to go under the seat to strengthen it front and back, and two "]]]
