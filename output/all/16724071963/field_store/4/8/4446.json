That mountain air sharpens the appetite amazingly; especially of men who are more accustomed to mount the rigging of a ship than the hills on shore. What say you, John Bumpus?\"  John Bumpus could not at that moment say anything, in consequence of his mouth being so full of the bacon referred to that there was no room for a single word to pass his lips. In the height of his good-humor, however, he did his best by signs to express his entire approval of the widow's provender, and even _attempted_ to speak. In so doing he choked himself, and continued in convulsions for the next five minutes, to the immense delight of the captain, who vowed he had never before seen such a blue face in the whole course of his life.  While this scene was enacting, and ere Jo Bumpus had effectually wiped away the tears from his eyes, and cleared the bacon out of his windpipe, the door opened, and the commander of H.M.S. Talisman entered.  Edmund Montague was a young man to hold such a responsible position in the navy; but he was a bold, vigorous little Englishman,--a sort of gentlemanly and well-educated John Bull terrier; a frank address, agreeable manners, and an utterly reckless temperament, which was qualified and curbed, however, by good sense and hard-earned experience.  \"Good-day to you, Mrs. Stuart; I trust you will forgive my abrupt intrusion, but urgent business must be my excuse. I have called to have a little further conversation with your son respecting that rascally pirate who has given me so much trouble. If he will have the good ness to take a short walk with me, I shall be much indebted.\"  \"By all means,\" said Henry, rising and putting on his cap.  \"Perhaps,\" said Gascoyne, as they were about to leave the room, \"if the commander of the Talisman would condescend to take a little information from a stranger, he might learn something to the purpose regarding the pirate Durward; for he it is, I presume, of whom you are in search.\"  \"I shall be happy to gain information from any source,\" replied Montague, eying the captain narrowly, \"Are you a resident in this island?\"  \"No, I am not; my home is on the sea, and has been since I was a lad.\"  \"Ah! you have fallen in with this pirate, then, on your native ocean, I fancy, and have disagreeable cause to remember him, perchance,\" said Montague, smiling. \"Has he given you much trouble?\"  \"Aye, that he has,\" replied Gascoyne, with a sudden scowl of ferocity. \"No one in these seas has received so much annoyance from him as I have. Any one who could rid them of his presence would do good service to the cause of humanity. But,\" he added, while a grim smile overspread his handsome face, \"it is said that few vessels can cope with his schooner in speed, and I can answer for it that he is a bold man, fond of fighting, with plenty of reckless cut-throats to back him, and more likely to give chase to a sloop-of-war than to show her his heels. I trust you are well manned and armed, Captain Montague; for this Durward is a desperate fellow, I assure you.\"  The young commander's countenance flushed as he replied, \"Your anxiety on my account, sir, is quite uncalled for. Had I nothing but my own longboat wherewith to attack this pirate, it would be my duty to do so. I had scarcely expected to find unmanly fears exhibited in one so stalwart in appearance as you are. Perhaps it may relieve you to know that I am both well manned and armed. It is not usual for a British man-of-war to cruise in distant seas in a less suitable condition to protect her flag. And yet, methinks, one who has spent so many years of his life on salt water might know the difference between a frigate and a sloop-of-war.\"  \"Be not so hasty, young man,\" answered Gascoyne, gravely; \"you are not on your own quarter-deck just now. There ought to be civility between strangers. I may, indeed, be very ignorant of the cut and rig of British war vessels, seeing that I am but a plain trader in seas where ships of war are not often wont to unfurl their flags, but there can be no harm, and there was meant no offense, in warning you to be on your guard.\"  A tinge of sarcasm still lingered in Captain Montague's tone as he replied, \"Well, I thank you for the caution. But to come to the point, what know you of this pirate,--this Durward, as he calls himself; though I have no doubt he has sailed under so many aliases that he may have forgotten his real name.\"  \"I know him to be a villain,\" replied Gascoyne.  \"That much I know as well as you,\" said Montague.  \"And yet it is said he takes fits of remorse at times, and would fain change his way of life if he could,\" continued Gascoyne.  \"That I might guess,\" returned the other; \"most wicked men have their seasons of remorse. Can you tell me nothing of him more definite than this, friend?\"  \"I can tell you that he is the very bane of my existence,\" said Gascoyne, the angry expression again flitting for a moment across his countenance, \"He not only pursues and haunts me like my own shadow, but he gets me into scrapes by passing his schooner off for mine when he is caught.\"  The young officer glanced in surprise at the speaker as he uttered these words.  \"Indeed,\" said he, \"that is a strange confusion of ideas. So, then, the two schooners bear so strong a resemblance as to be easily mistaken for each other?\"  \"They are twins. They were built at the same time, from the same molds, and were intended for the sandal-wood trade between these islands and Calcutta, Manila, and Australia. One of them, the Avenger, was seized on her first voyage by this Durward, then mate of the schooner, and has ever since scoured the South Seas as a pirate; the other, named the Foam, which I have the misfortune to command, still continues the traffic for which she was originally built.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Montague, turning suddenly round with an inquiring gaze at the stalwart figure of the sandal-wood trader; \"it is most fortunate that I have met with you, Mr. Gascoyne. I doubt not that you can conduct me to this vessel of yours, so that I may know the pirate when I fall in with him. If the two vessels resemble each other so closely, a sight of the Foam will be of great service to me in my search after the Avenger.\"  \"You are most welcome to a sight of my craft,\" replied Gascoyne. \"The only difference between the two is, that the figurehead of the pirate is a griffin's head, painted scarlet; that of my schooner is a female, painted white. There is also a red streak round the sides of the pirate; the hull of the Foam is entirely black.\"  \"Will you come on board my vessel, and accompany me in one of my boats to yours?\" inquired Montague.  \"That is impossible,\" replied Gascoyne. \"I came here on urgent business, which will not brook delay; but my schooner lies on the other side of the island. If you pull round, my mate will receive you. You will find him a most intelligent and hospitable man. He will conduct you over the vessel, and give you all the information you may desire. Meanwhile,\" added the captain of the Foam, rising and putting on his cap, \"I must bid you adieu.\"  \"Nay, but you have not yet told me when or where you last saw or heard of this remarkable pirate, who is so clever at representing other people; perhaps I should rather say misrepresenting them,\" said Montague, with a meaning smile.  \"I saw him no longer ago than this morning,\" replied Gascoyne, gravely. \"He is now in these waters, with what intent I know not, unless from his unnatural delight in persecuting me, or, perhaps, because fate has led him into the very jaws of the lion.\"  \"Humph! he will find that I bite before I roar, if he does get between my teeth,\" said the young officer.  \"Surely you are mistaken, Gascoyne,\" interposed Henry Stuart, who, along with John Bumpus, had hitherto been silent listeners to the foregoing conversation. \"Several of our people have been out fishing among the islands, and have neither seen nor heard of this redoubted pirate.\"  \"That is possible enough, boy; but I have seen him, nevertheless, and I shall be much surprised if you do not see and hear more of him than you desire before many days are out. That villain does not sail the seas for pastime, you may depend on it.\"  As Gascoyne said this, the outer door of the house was burst violently open, and the loud voice of a boy was heard in the porch or short passage that intervened between it and the principal apartment of the cottage shouting wildly--\"Ho! hallo! hurrah! I says Widow Stuart! Henry! here's a business--sich fun! only think, the pirate's turned up at last, and murdered half the niggers in--\"  There was an abrupt stoppage both of the voice and the muscular action of this juvenile tornado as he threw open the door with a crash, and, instead of the widow or her son, met the gaze of so many strangers. The boy stood for a few seconds on the threshold, with his curly brown hair disheveled, and his dark eyes staring in surprise, first at one, then at another of the party, until at length they alighted on John Bumpus. The mouth which up to that moment had formed a round O of astonishment, relaxed into a broad grin, and, with sudden energy, exclaimed: \"_What_ a grampus!\"  Having uttered this complimentary remark, the urchin was about to retreat, when Henry made a sudden dart at him, and caught him by the collar.  \"Where got you the news, Will Corrie?\" said Henry giving the boy a squeeze with his strong hand.  \"Oh, please, be merciful, Henry, and I'll tell you all about it. But, pray, don't give me over to that grampus,\" cried the lad, pretending to whimper. \"I got the news from a feller, that said he'd got it from a feller, that saw a feller, who said he'd heard a feller tell another feller, that he saw a _black_ feller in the bush, somewhere"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15689"],["title","Gascoyne, The Sandal-Wood Trader: A Tale of the Pacific (#6)"],["body","other 'tween this and the other end o' the island, with a shot-hole in his right arm, running like a cogolampus, with ten pirates in full chase. Ah! oh! have mercy, Henry; really, my constitution will break down if you--\"  \"Silence, you chatter-box! and give me a reasonable account of what you have heard or seen, if you can.\"  The volatile urchin, who might have been about thirteen years of age, became preternaturally grave all of a sudden, and, looking up earnestly in his questioner's face, said, \"Really, Henry, you are becoming unreasonable in your old age, to ask me to give you a reasonable account of a thing, and at the same time to be silent!\"  \"I'll tell you what, Corrie, I'll throttle you if you don't speak,\" said Henry.  \"Ah! you _couldn't_,\" pleaded Corrie, in a tone of deep pathos.  \"P'raps,\" observed John Bumpus, \"p'raps if you hand over the young gen'l'm'n to the 'grampus,' _he'll_ make him speak.\"  On hearing this, the boy set up a howl of affected despair, and suffered Henry to lead him unresistingly to within a few feet of Bumpus; but, just as he was within an inch of the huge fist of that nautical monster, he suddenly wrenched his collar out of his captor's grasp, darted to the door, turned round on the threshold, hit the side of his own nose a sounding slap with the forefinger of his right hand, uttered an unexpressively savage yell, vanished from the scene, and,      \"Like the baseless fabric of a vision,     Left not a wreck behind,\"  except the wreck of the milk-saucer of the household cat, which sagacious creature had wisely taken to flight at the first symptom of war.  The boy was instantly followed by Henry, but so light was his foot, that the fastest runner in the settlement had to penetrate the woods immediately behind his mother's house for a quarter of a mile before he succeeded in again laying hold of the refractory lad's collar.  \"What do you mean, Corrie, by such conduct?\" said his captor, shaking him vigorously. \"I have half a mind to give you a walloping.\"  \"Never do anything by halves, Henry,\" said the boy, mildly. \"_I_ never do. It's a bad habit; always go the whole length or none. Now that we are alone, I'll give you a reasonable account of what I know, if you'll remove your hand from my collar. You forget that I am growing, and that, when I am big enough, the day of reckoning between us will surely come!\"  \"But why would you not give me the information I want in the house. The people you saw there are as much interested in it as I am.\"  \"Oh! are they?\" returned Corrie, with a glance of peculiar meaning; \"perhaps they are _more_ interested than you are.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Why, how do I know, and how do you know, that these fellows are not pirates in disguise?\"  \"Because,\" said Henry, \"one of them is an old friend,--that is, an acquaintance--at least a sort of intimate, who has been many and many a time at our house before, and my mother knows him well. I can't say I like him,--that is to say, I don't exactly like some of his ways,--though I don't dislike the man himself.\"  \"A most unsatisfactory style of reply, Henry, for a man--ah, beg pardon, a boy--of your straightforward character. Which o' the three are you speaking of--the grampus?\"  \"No, the other big, handsome-looking fellow.\"  \"And you're sure you've known him long?\" continued the boy, while an expression of perplexity flitted over his face.  \"Quite sure;--why?\"  \"Because _I_ have seen you often enough, and your house and your mother,--not to mention your cat and your pigs, and hens; but I've never seen _him_ before to-day.\"  \"That's because he usually comes at night, and seldom stays more than an hour or two.\"  \"A most uncomfortable style of acquaintance,\" said Corrie, trying to look wise, which was an utterly futile effort, seeing that his countenance was fat and round and rosy, and very much the reverse of philosophical. \"But how do you know that the grampus is not the pirate?\"  \"Because he is one of Gascoyne's men.\"  \"Oh! his name is Gascoyne, is it?--a most piratical name it is. However, since he is your friend, Henry, it's all right; what's t'other's name?\"  \"Bumpus--John Bumpus.\"  On hearing this, the boy clapped both hands to his sides, expanded his eyes and mouth, showed his teeth, and finally gave vent to roars of uncontrollable laughter, swaying his body about the while as if in agony.  \"Oh dear!\" he cried, after a time, \"John Bumpus, ha! ha! the grampus--why, it's magnicicent, ha! ha!\" and again the boy gave free vent to his merriment, while his companion looked on with a quiet grin of amusement.  Presently Corrie became grave, and said, \"But what of the third, the little chap, all over gold lace? P'r'aps he's the pirate. He looked bold enough a'most for any thing.\"  \"Why, you goose, that's the commander of his Britannic Majesty's frigate Talisman.\"  \"Indeed? I hope his Britannic Majesty has many more like him.\"  \"Plenty more like him. But come, boy; what have you heard of this pirate, and what do you mean about a wounded nigger?\"  \"I just mean this,\" answered the lad, suddenly becoming serious, \"that when I was out on the mountain this morning, I thought I would cross the ridge, and when I did so, the first thing I saw was a schooner lying in the bay at the foot of the hill, where you and I have so often gone chasing pigs together. Well, being curious to know what sort of a craft she was, I went down the hill, intendin' to go aboard; but before I'd got half way through the cocoanut grove, I heard a horrible yell of a savage. So, thinks I, here comes them blackguard pagans again, to attack the settlement; and before I could hide out of the way, a naked savage almost ran into my arms. He was sea-green in the face with fright, and blood was running over his right arm.  \"The moment he saw me, instead of splitting me up with his knife and eating me alive, as these fellers are so fond of doin', he gave a start, and another great cry, and doubled on his track like a hare. His cry was answered by a shout from half a dozen sailors, who burst out of the thicket at that moment, and I saw they were in pursuit of him. Down I went at once behind a thick bush, and the whole lot o' the blind bats passed right on in full cry, within half an inch of my nose. And never saw sich a set o' piratical-looking villains since I was born. I felt quite sure that yon schooner is the pirate that has been doing so much mischief hereabouts; so I came back as fast as my legs could carry me, to tell you what I had seen. There, you have got all that I know of the matter now.\"  \"You are wrong, boy. The schooner you saw is not the pirate; it is the Foam. Strange, very strange!\" muttered Henry.  \"What's strange,\" inquired the lad.  \"Not the appearance of the wounded nigger,\" answered the other; \"I can explain all about him, but the sailors--that puzzles me.\"  Henry then related the morning's adventure to his young companion.  \"But,\" continued he, after detailing all that the reader already knows, \"I cannot comprehend how the pirates you speak of could have landed without their vessel being in sight; and that nothing is to be seen from the mountain-tops except the Talisman on the one side of the island and the Foam on the other, I can vouch for. Boats might lie concealed among the rocks on the shore, no doubt. But no boats would venture to put ashore with hostile intentions, unless the ship to which they belonged were within sight. As for the crew of the Foam, they are ordinary seamen, and not likely to amuse themselves chasing wounded savages, even if they were allowed to go ashore, which I think is not likely; for Gascoyne knows well enough that that side of the island is inhabited by the pagans, who would as soon kill and eat a man as they would a pig.\"  \"Sooner,--the monsters!\" exclaimed the boy, indignantly; for he had, on more than one occasion, been an eyewitness of the horrible practise of cannibalism which prevails, even at the present day, among some of the South Sea islanders.  \"There is a mystery here,\" said Henry, starting up, \"and the sooner we alarm the people of the settlement, the better. Come, Corrie, we shall return to the house, and let the British officer hear what you have told me.\"  When the lad had finished relating his adventure to the party in Widow Stuart's cottage, Gascoyne said quietly, \"I would advise you, Captain Montague, to return to your ship and make your preparations for capturing this pirate, for that he is even now almost within range of your guns, I have not the slightest doubt. As to the men appearing piratical-looking fellows to this boy, I don't wonder at that; most men are wild enough when their blood is up. Some of my own men are as savage to look at as one would desire. But I gave strict orders this morning that only a few were to go ashore, and these were to keep well out of sight of the settlement of the savages. Doubtless they are all aboard by this time. If you decide upon anything like a hunt among the mountains, I can lend you a few hands.\"  \"Thank you. I may perhaps require some of your hands,\" said Montague, with a dash of sarcasm in his tone; \"meanwhile, since you will not favor me with your company on board, I shall bid you good afternoon.\"  He bowed stiffly, and leaving the cottage, hastened on board his ship where the shrill notes of the boatswain's whistle, and the deep hoarse tones of that officer's gruff voice, quickly announced to the people on shore that orders had been promptly given, and were in course of being as promptly obeyed.  During the hour that followed these events, the captain of the Foam was closeted with Widow Stuart and her son, and the youthful Corrie was engaged in laying the foundations of a never-to-die friendship with John Bumpus, or, as that eccentric youngster preferred to style him, Jo Grampus.
