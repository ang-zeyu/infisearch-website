Well, after the old gentleman rabbit had eaten all the breakfast he could, he thanked the kind ants and said good-by to them. Then he started off again. He hadn't gone on very far through the woods, before, all of a sudden he saw something bright and shining under a blackberry bush.  \"Well, I do declare!\" cried the old gentleman rabbit. \"I think that looks like gold. I hope I'm not fooled this time. I will go up very slowly and carefully. Perhaps I shall find my fortune now.\"  So up he walked very softly, and he stooped down and picked up the shining thing. And what do you think it was? Why a bright new penny--as shiny as gold.  \"Good luck!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, \"I am beginning to find money. Soon I will be rich, and then I can stop traveling,\" and he put the penny in his pocket.  Well, no sooner had he done so than he heard some one crying over behind a raspberry bush. Oh, such a sad cry as it was, and the old gentleman rabbit knew right away that some one was in trouble.  \"Who is there?\" he asked, as he felt in his pocket to see if his penny was safe, for he thought that was the beginning of his fortune.  \"Oh, I'm lost!\" cried the voice. \"I came to the store to buy a chocolate lollypop, and I can't find my way back,\" and then out from behind the raspberry bush came a tiny, little striped chipmunk with the tears falling down on her little paws.  \"Oh, you poor little dear!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"And so you are lost? Well, don't you know what to do? As soon as you are lost you must go to a policeman and ask him to take you home. Policemen always know where everybody lives.\"  \"But there are no policemen here,\" said the chipmunk, who was something like a squirrel, only smaller.  \"That's so,\" agreed Uncle Wiggily. \"Well, pretend that I am a policeman, and I'll take you home. Where do you live?\"  \"If I knew,\" said the chipmunk, \"I would go home myself. All that I know is that I live in a hollow stump.\"  \"Hum!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"There are so many hollow stumps here, that I can't tell which one it is. We will go to each one, and when you find the one that is your home, just tell me.\"  \"But that is not the worst,\" said the chipmunk. \"I have lost my bright, new penny that my mamma gave me for a chocolate lollypop. Oh dear. Isn't it terrible.\"  \"Perhaps this is your penny,\" said the old gentleman rabbit a bit sadly, taking from his pocket the one he had found.  \"It is the very one!\" cried the lost chipmunk, joyfully. \"Oh, how good of you to find it for me.\"  \"Well,\" thought Uncle Wiggily with a sorrowful sigh as he handed over the penny, \"I thought I had found the beginning of my fortune, but I've lost it again. Never mind. I'll try to-morrow.\"  So he gave the penny to the chipmunk, and she stopped crying right away, and took hold of Uncle Wiggily's paw, and he led her around to all the hollow stumps until she found the right one where she lived.  And he bought her an ice cream cone because he felt sorry for her. And, just as she was eating it, along came a big, black bear and he wanted half of it, but very luckily the July bug flew past just then, and he bit the bear in the eyes, so that the bad bear was glad enough to run home, taking his little stumpy tail with him. Then the chipmunk took Uncle Wiggily back to her home, and he stayed with her papa and mamma all night.  Now, in case the rocking chair on our porch doesn't tip over in the middle of the night, and scare the pussy cat off the railing, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the black cricket.     STORY X  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BLACK CRICKET   Uncle Wiggily, the nice old gentleman rabbit, was feeling quite sad one morning as he hopped along the dusty road. It was a few days after he had helped the lost chipmunk find her way back home, and he had given her the lost penny which he had also picked up.  \"Oh, dear me!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he thought of the penny. \"That's generally the way it is in this world. Nothing seems to go right. I naturally thought I had found the beginning of my fortune, even if it was only a penny, and it turned out that the money belonged to somebody else. Oh dear!\"  Well, the old rabbit traveler actually felt so badly that he didn't much care whether he found his fortune or not, and that is a very poor way to feel in this world, for one must never give up trying, no matter what happens.  Then Uncle Wiggily looked in his satchel to see if he had anything to eat, but my goodness sakes alive and a ham sandwich! There wasn't a thing in the valise! You see he was thinking so much about the penny that he forgot to put up his lunch.  \"Humph! This is a pretty state of affairs!\" exclaimed the old rabbit gentleman. \"Worse and worse, and some more besides! I do declare! Hum! Suz! Dud!\"  Well, he didn't know what to do, so he sat down on a log beside a shady bush and thought it all over. And the more he thought the sadder he became, until he began to believe he was the most miserable rabbit in all the world.  \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"I might as well go back home and done with it.\"  But no sooner had he said this, than Uncle Wiggily heard the jolliest laugh he had ever known. Oh! it was such a rippling, happy joyous laugh that it would almost cure the toothache just to listen to it.  \"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! He! He!\" laughed the voice, and Uncle Wiggily looked up, and he looked down, and then he looked sideways and around a corner, but he could see no one. Still the laugh kept up, more jolly than ever.  \"Humph! I wonder who that is?\" said the rabbit. \"I wish I could laugh like that,\" and Uncle Wiggily actually smiled the least little bit, and he didn't feel quite so sad.  Then, all at once, there was a voice singing, and this is the song, and if you feel sad when you sing it, just get some one to tickle you, or watch baby's face when he smiles, and you will feel jolly enough to sing this song, even if you have been crying because you stubbed your toe.      \"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! I gladly sing,     I sing about most anything.     I sing about a pussy cat,     Who caught a little mousie-rat.     I sing about a doggie-dog,     Who saw a turtle on a log.     I sing about a little boy,     Who cried because he broke his toy.     And then he laughed, 'Ha! Ha! He! He!'     Because he couldn't help it; see?\"  \"Well, well!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, \"I wish I knew who that was. Perhaps it is a fairy, and if it is, I'm going to ask her for my fortune. I'm getting tired of not finding it,\" and when he thought about that he was sad again.  But a moment later a little black creature hopped out from under a leaf, and who should it be but a cricket.  \"Was that you laughing?\" asked the old gentleman rabbit, as he again looked in his valise to see if he had any sandwiches there. \"Was it you?\"  \"It was,\" said the cricket. \"I was just going--Oh, kindly excuse me, while I laugh again!\" the cricket said, and then he laughed more jolly than before.  \"What makes you so good-natured?\" asked the rabbit.  \"I just can't help it,\" said the cricket. \"Everything is so lovely. The sun shines, and the birds sing, and the water in the brooks babble such jolly songs, and well--Oh, excuse me again if you please, I'm going to laugh once more,\" and so he did then and there. He just laughed and laughed and laughed, that cricket did.  \"Well,\" said Uncle Wiggily, still speaking sadly, \"of course it's nice to be jolly, anybody can be that way when the sun shines, but what about the rain? There! I guess you can't be jolly when it rains.\"  \"Oh! when it rains I laugh because I know it will soon clear off, and then, too, I can think about the days when the sun did shine,\" said the cricket.  \"Well,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, \"there is something in that, to be sure. And as you are such a jolly chap, will you travel along with me? Perhaps with you I could find my fortune.\"  \"Of course I'll come,\" said the cricket, and he laughed again, and then he and the old gentleman rabbit hopped on together and Uncle Wiggily kept feeling more and more happy until he had forgotten all about the chipmunk's penny that wasn't his.  Well, in a little while, not so very long, the rabbit and the cricket came to a dark place in the woods. Oh! it was quite dismal, and, just as they passed a big, black stump with a hole in it, all of a sudden out popped the skillery-scalery-tailery alligator.  \"Ah, ha!\" exclaimed the unpleasant creature. \"Now I have you both. I'm going to eat you both, first you, Mr. Cricket, and then you, Uncle Wiggily.\"  \"Oh, please don't,\" begged the rabbit. \"I haven't found my fortune yet.\"  \"No matter,\" cried the alligator, \"here we go!\"  He made a grab for the cricket, but the little black insect hopped to one side, and then, all of a sudden he began to laugh. Oh, how hard he laughed.  \"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! He! He!\" My, it was wonderful! At first the alligator didn't know what to make of it. Harder and harder did the black cricket laugh, and then Uncle Wiggily began. He just couldn't help it. Harder and harder laughed the cricket and Uncle Wiggily together, and then, all at once, the alligator began to laugh. He couldn't help it either.  \"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! He! He!\" laughed the 'gator, and great big alligator tears rolled down his scaly cheeks, he laughed so hard. Why, he giggled so that he couldn't even have eaten a mosquito with mustard on.  \"Come on, now!\" suddenly cried the cricket to Uncle Wiggily. \"Now is our chance to get away.\"  And before the alligator had stopped laughing they both hopped away in the woods together, and so the bad scalery-ailery-tailery creature didn't get either of them.  \"My! it's a good thing you made him laugh,\" said the rabbit when they were safely away.  \"It's a good thing to make anybody laugh,\" said the black cricket, and then he and Uncle Wiggily went on to seek the old gentleman rabbit's fortune.  And in the next story, in case the sunshine doesn't make my "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15282"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Travels (#7)"],["body","cat sneeze and spill his milk, on the new door mat, I'll tell you all about Uncle Wiggily and the busy bug.     STORY XI  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BUSY BUG   Everywhere Uncle Wiggily and the black cricket went in the next few days, every one was glad to see them. For they were both so jolly, and laughed and joked so much along the road, that no one who heard them could be sad.  They came to one place where there was a boy sick with the toothache, and his mamma had done everything for him that she could think of, even to putting mustard on it, but still that boy's tooth ached.  Well, as soon as that boy saw the cricket and the old gentleman rabbit, and heard them laugh, why the boy smiled, and then the pain, somehow, seemed to be better, and he smiled some more, and then he laughed.  Then Uncle Wiggily told a funny story about a monkey who made faces at himself in a looking-glass, and got so excited about it that he jumped around behind the glass, thinking another monkey was there, and there wasn't, and the monkey fell into the freezer full of ice cream and caught cold because he ate so much of it.  Well, that boy opened his mouth real wide to laugh at the funny story and his mamma all of a sudden slipped a string around the aching tooth and she pulled it out in a moment, and it never ached again.  \"Oh, how glad I am!\" cried the little boy. \"I wish you would always stay with me, Uncle Wiggily--you and the jolly cricket.\"  \"I'd like to, but I can't,\" said the old gentleman rabbit. \"I must keep on after my fortune.\"  \"I'll stay with you for a little while,\" said the cricket, and he did, telling some funny stories to other boys who had the toothache, and right away after that they allowed their bad teeth to be pulled, and their pain was over.  So Uncle Wiggily said good-by to the cricket and went on by himself. He was feeling very good now, for he and the cricket had met a kind muskrat, a thirty-fifth cousin to Nurse Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy, and this muskrat gave Uncle Wiggily a lot of sandwiches for his satchel, so he wouldn't be hungry again for some time.  \"And I don't mind so much about the cent, either,\" thought the rabbit, as he remembered the one that belonged to the chipmunk. \"After all a cent is not so much, and I need more than that for my fortune. Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!\"  He just had to laugh, you see, when he thought of the jolly cricket. So he traveled on and on, over hill and dale, until one evening, just as the sun was going down behind the clouds, all red and golden and violet colored, he saw a little house built of green leaves.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"That is a very fine house. I wish I had one like it in which to stay to-night. But it's too small for me. I guess I'll have to keep on and look for a haystack under which to crawl.\"  Well, just as he said that, all of a sudden there was a little rustling, scratching noise, and a bug came to the door of the queer little green leaf house. The bug had a broom and she began sweeping off the front porch and then she knocked the dirt out of the doormat, and then she swept some cobwebs off the shutters and then she hurried out and swept off the sidewalk, all so quickly that you could scarcely see her move.  \"My, but she is a fast worker,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"She is almost as quick as Jennie Chipmunk.\"  \"I have to be!\" exclaimed the bug, for the old gentleman rabbit had spoken out loud without thinking, and the bug had heard him. \"I have to hustle around,\" she said, \"for I am the busy bug, and I have to keep busy. I work from morning to night to keep my house in order. Now excuse me; I have to go in and dust the piano,\" and she was just going to run in the house, when Uncle Wiggily said:  \"Do you happen to know of a place where I can stay to-night?\"  \"Why, yes,\" said the busy bug. \"Next door is a house where Mr. Groundhog used to live. But now he is away on his vacation, and I have the keys. I'm sure he wouldn't mind you staying in there over night. I'll get it in order for you. Come along, hurry up, no time to lose!\"  And before Uncle Wiggily knew what was happening the busy bug had run in, got the keys, opened the front door of the groundhog's house. Then she flew in, and she began dusting it. My! what a dust she raised. Uncle Wiggily had to sneeze, there was so much of it.  And the funny part of it was that the house was already just as neat and clean as a piece of cocoanut or custard, or maybe even apple pie.  \"Don't fuss any more with it,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"It will do very well as it is.\"  \"Oh, it must be made cleaner,\" said the busy bug, and she swept and dusted until Uncle Wiggily sneezed again. Then the bug dusted a little more, and at last she said the house was in pretty fair shape and Uncle Wiggily could sleep there.  Then the busy bug flew back home and she kept busy up to nine o'clock, making beds and dusting the crumbs off the mantelpiece and picking up grains of sand off the floor. Then she went to sleep.  Well, along in the middle of the night Uncle Wiggily was awakened by hearing some one talking under his window. He looked out, and there were two savage old owls.  \"Now, we'll fly right in through her window,\" said one owl, \"and we'll eat her all up, and then we'll tear her house down.\"  And, would you believe it, they started right toward the house of the poor busy lady bug, who was fast asleep.  \"Ha! This must never be!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"I must save her. How can I do it?\" So he looked around, and he saw a broom, which the busy bug had left behind when she finished sweeping. \"That will do!\" cried the rabbit. He took it in his paws and, leaning out of the window, he held it just as if it was a gun, and cried:  \"Now, you bad owls, fly away or I'll shoot all your feathers off! Fly away and don't you harm my friend, the busy lady bug!\"  Well, sir, those owls were so frightened, thinking that Uncle Wiggily was going to shoot them with the broom-gun (only, of course, they didn't know it was only a broom), and, would you believe it, they were terribly afraid and they flew off into the dark woods, and so didn't eat up the busy bug after all, and she slept in peace and quietness, never even waking up, she was so tired after being busy all day.  Then Uncle Wiggily went back to bed, and the owls didn't disturb him again that night. And in the morning the busy bug got his breakfast and thanked him when he told her about scaring the owls away with the make-believe broom-gun.  Uncle Wiggily traveled on, and soon he had another adventure. What it was I'll tell you almost right away, when, in case the cake of ice doesn't melt, and make a mud puddle for the baby to fall into, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the funny monkey.     STORY XII  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FUNNY MONKEY   It was a bright and beautiful sunshiny day, and Uncle Wiggily was hopping along the road, thinking many thoughts and about the busy bug and the black cricket and all things like that and how hard it was to look and look for your fortune and never find it, when all of a sudden, just as he happened to put his crutch down on a round stone, it slipped, and down he fell kerthump.  \"Oh, wow! Ouch!\" cried the old gentleman rabbit as he bumped his nose on a sharp stick. \"That hurt! My, I hope I haven't broken one of my ears or paw-nails. If I did I'll have to get in the ambulance and go to the hospital.\"  So he sat up very slowly and carefully and looked himself all over and he was glad to see that he hadn't broken anything except a lettuce sandwich that he carried in his satchel and, as it was just as good broken as it was whole, it didn't matter much.  \"Oh, are you hurt?\" suddenly cried a voice, as Uncle Wiggily took some dirt out of his left ear. \"If you are I can give you something to put on your cuts,\" and out from under a big leaf came a beautiful butterfly.  \"What can you put on my cuts?\" asked the rabbit.  \"Oh, I can get some sticky gum from a tree or a flower and spread it on a leaf and make some court plaster,\" spoke the butterfly. \"It will cure a cut very quickly.\"  \"Thank you very much,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"but very luckily I haven't any cuts. I'm all right, I guess, but because you are so kind to me here is just a drop of honey that I found in the bottom of my satchel. The bee gave it to me.\" So he handed to the kind butterfly a little honey he had left. The butterfly was very glad to get it, and fluttered away, jumping from one flower to another as easily as a boy can spin his top.  Then the old gentleman rabbit traveled on, and pretty soon, when it was just about time for dinner, he came to a beautiful place in the woods. The trees were nice and green and shady, and there was a little brook that was bubbling and babbling over the mossy stones and then all at once Uncle Wiggily heard the queerest music he had ever heard. It was like forty-'leven bands all playing in the park at once.  \"My, I must be near a big picnic!\" cried the rabbit. \"I shall have to look out for myself, or some boys may chase me.\"  The music kept getting louder but still the old gentleman rabbit didn't see any people, and he went on very slowly until he came to a little house built of shingles, and there in front of it sat a monkey. And he was the funniest monkey you ever saw.  For that monkey was playing five hand organs all at once. Yes, just as true as I'm telling you, he was. He played one organ with his left paw and he played another organ with his right paw, and he played still another with his left foot and he twisted the crank of another with his right foot. And then, to finish off with, he whirled around the crank of the fifth organ with his long tail. Oh, he was a smart monkey, I tell you!  \"My! This is almost as good as a circus!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"I'm glad I came this way.\"  Well, that funny monkey played faster than ever, and on one organ he played the tune \"Please Bring Your Umbrella Inside When it Rains,\" and on another he played \"May I Have Some of Your Ice Cream Cone"]]]
