Take his gun.\" He paused a moment as a brother of the man now under arrest stepped forward with a sullen face and obeyed orders. Running his glance over the line of faces, now suddenly vacant of expression, he whipped them mercilessly with his eye. \"You men, too, will hear from me. Go to the stable and wait. Another piece of work like this and I'll have your coats cut off with a belt buckle! Clear out!\"  Then he turned to the beautiful woman in white who stood only a few feet away, no longer timid but in entire possession of her faculties before what, she knew, might prove a greater danger than a drunkard.  \"Madam,\" said the Union officer as he doffed his hat, \"I couldn't apologize for this, no matter how hard I tried; but, believe me, I regret it--deeply.\"  In answer she slowly raised her heavy lidded eyes and gave him her first thrust--smoothly and deftly.  \"No apology is demanded,\" she murmured in soft tones. \"I was merely unfamiliar with the Union's method of attack.\"  \"Attack!\" he repeated, astounded, and stepped back.  \"What else?\" she asked, simply. \"My home is over-run; my servant assaulted--by a drunken ruffian.\"  \"The man will be punished,\" was the stern reply, \"to the limit of my authority.\"  \"He _should_ be. We know him,\" the Southern woman said bitterly. \"Before the war he was our overseer. He was cruel to the negroes and my husband gave him a taste of his own discipline--with a riding whip!\"  \"Ah, I see,\" Morrison nodded. \"But it is not always in an officer's power to control each individual in the service--especially at such a time. Yet I assure you on the part of the Union--and mine--that there was no intention of attack.\"  Mrs. Cary had chosen this moment in which to draw her visitor off the veranda and when she had successfully brought him to the foot of the steps she looked up in smiling sarcasm with another thrust.  \"Oh! Then since your visit would seem a _social_ one--how may I serve you, sir?\"  Morrison laughed lightly. This pretty cat could scratch.  \"I'm afraid, dear madam, you are wrong again. My detachment is on foraging duty. It is not a pleasant task--but our army is in need of horses and supplies, and by the rules of war, I must take what I can find.\"  \"Even by force?\" came the quiet inquiry.  \"Yes, even force,\" he answered, reddening. \"With its proper limitations. I rob you, it is true, but by virtue of necessity. In return I can only offer, as I would to every other woman of the South, all courtesy and protection at my command,\" and Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison, for the second time, took off his hat.  The Southern woman swept him a curtsey filled with graceful mockery.  \"I thank you. There is consolation--and even flattery--in being plundered by a gentleman.\" She made a short gesture which took in house, plantation and all the Cary possessions. \"I regret sincerely that we have nothing left; yet I beg you--help yourself.\"  Colonel Morrison bit his lip, half in vexation and half in amusement. \"At least you make my undertaking a difficult one, although I must admit, I hardly blame you.\" And then, with a quick, searching look, \"Are there any rebels hidden in your house?\"  \"No,\" she answered.  \"No wounded officers--or refugees of any kind?\"  \"None.\"  \"You give me your word for this--your oath?\"  The Southern woman's head went up and her eyes flashed. \"I do,\" she said contemptuously and moved away.  \"Thank you,\" was the grave reply, and he turned to dismiss his men. Then a thought struck him and he detained her with a gesture.  \"Pardon me, but if it _was_ true--if a brother or a father--was concealed in there--wouldn't your answer be the same?\"  The answer that came proudly back did not amaze him. \"I would try to protect them--yes! Even with a _perjury_!\"  \"Ah!\" he said sharply. \"Then, don't you you see, you tie the hands of courtesy and _force_ me to--to this invasion of your home. _Corporal!_ Make a search of the house for hidden arms or stragglers and report to me. If any rebels are found--bring them out. Wait,\" he ordered, as the Corporal promptly started forward, \"nothing else, _whatever_, must be taken or molested.\"  \"One moment,\" commanded Mrs. Cary in her turn and beckoned to Uncle Billy who had been standing by in silence. \"William! conduct these soldiers through my house--and show them every courtesy. If the Colonel's orders are not obeyed, report to me.\"  \"Yas'm,\" grinned Uncle Billy, with an opera bouffe salute. \"Ev'ry molestashun I'se gwine report.\"  Morrison laughed outright. \"I'm sorry you still have doubts of my honorable intentions. May--may my soldiers go in now? Thank you.\"  He walked away a few steps, then turned and looked at her where she sat on the bench demurely sewing. It occurred to him that she was _too_ demure. Besides, he had discovered something.  \"Er--it is true that I found your stable empty,\" he said, while his eyes probed hers, \"but, curiously enough, it seems to have been recently occupied.\"  \"Yes?\" was the non-committal reply.  \"Yes,\" he echoed, with a touch of iron in his voice. \"And you can insure our leaving you more quickly if you will tell me where these horses have been hidden.\"  Mrs. Cary did not raise her eyes.  \"Granted that we _had_ them,\" she said, \"I'm afraid I must trouble you to look for them. Otherwise there would be no sense in trying to protect my property.\"  \"Right again,\" he acknowledged, but did not swerve from what he had to do. \"Orderly,\" he commanded, \"report to Lieutenant Harris at the stables and have him hunt the woods and swamp for hidden horses. Hurry! We must leave in half an hour.\"  As Morrison spoke his eye fell on the roadway and he started perceptibly. When he turned back to the woman on the bench it was with a sterner light in his eye.  \"I also notice that a horse has recently been fed and watered in your carriage road. _Whose was he?_\"  Again that smooth, soft voice with its languid evasions. \"We have several neighbors, Colonel. They visit us at infrequent times.\"  \"Undoubtedly,\" he conceded. \"But do you usually feed their horses?\"  She smiled faintly. \"What little hospitality is ours extends to both man and beast.\"  \"I can well believe it,\" he replied, for he saw to cross-examine this quick witted woman would be forever useless. \"And in happier times I could wish it might extend--to me.  \"Oh, I mean no offense,\" he interrupted as Mrs. Cary rose haughtily. \"I only want you to believe that I'm sorry for this intrusion.\"  She raised her eyebrows faintly and sat down again. \"And was that the reason why you asked about my neighbor's horse?\"  \"No,\" he said quickly, and as suddenly caught and held her eye. \"There's a Rebel scout who has been giving us trouble--a handsome fellow riding a bay horse. I thought, perhaps, he might have passed this way.\"  If he had thought he would detect anything in her face he was once more mistaken.  \"It is more than possible,\" Mrs. Cary remarked with a touch of weariness. \"The road out there is a public one.\"  \"And where does it lead to, may I ask?\"  \"That depends upon which way you are traveling--and which fork you take.\"  \"Possibly. But suppose you were riding north. Wouldn't the right fork lead to Richmond--and the left swing around toward the river crossing?\"  \"As to that I must refer you to a more competent authority,\" she answered with a hint of some disclosure in her tones.  \"Who?\"  \"Mr. Jefferson Davis,\" she replied and almost laughed outright as he turned away to hide his vexation. This was an easy game for her to play--and every moment she gained added to Herbert's safety. But if only she could hear those three shots from across the river.  \"Well, Harris?\" said Morrison as his Lieutenant strode up.  \"I have to report, sir, that we've gotten what little hay and corn there was in the stables and are waiting for your orders.\"  \"Very well,\" and Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison's incisive words rang mercilessly in the listening woman's ears. \"Pick out the best shots you have among your men and send them at the gallop down this road to the river crossing. String them along the bank, dismount them and have them watch as they've never watched before. You understand? Now _hurry_!\"  If ever a woman hated a man, or rather the crushing force he typified, then Herbert Cary's wife hated this clear headed, efficient Northerner, who was now discovering how he had been delayed and thwarted. Yet she had plenty of spirit left, for as Corporal Dudley and his file of troopers emerged from the house she stood up and caught Uncle Billy's eye.  \"Well, Corporal?\" asked Morrison.  \"Well, William?\" asked Mrs. Cary.  \"It's all right, Miss Hallie,\" Uncle Billy grinned. \"Dey ain't took nothin'--not a single thing.\"  \"Thank you, William,\" said Mrs. Cary, having triumphed again. \"And thank _you_, gentlemen.\" With a bow to Morrison she went superbly back to her seat under the trees. But as she went it took all her strength of will to keep from crying. Down the carriage road a squad of cavalry was galloping furiously towards the river. And still she had not heard the three shots.  \"Now, then, Corporal, you found what?\"  \"Nothing, sir. We hunted from cellar to roof. No arms and no rebels.\"  \"H'm,\" he mused. \"Anything else?\"  \"Three bedrooms, sir. All in use.\"  \"Three?\" Colonel Morrison exclaimed. \"Very well. That's all. I'll join you in a moment.\" Then he turned to Mrs. Cary, his face stern with resolve.  \"Madam,\" he said crisply, \"you are not alone on this plantation with only this old negro. We are wasting time. I'm after a Rebel scout and _I want him_. Which way did he go?\"  \"I'm sorry, sir,\" she said, quite ready to play her game again. \"But our Rebel scouts usually neglect to mention their precise intentions.\"  \"Perhaps. If this one went at all."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15414"],["title","The Littlest Rebel (#6)"],["body","he still here?\"  \"I should imagine--_not_.\"  \"Then he did go this way--to the river crossing?\"  Once more he caught and held her eyes and thought he would read the truth in spite of anything she might say.  But while he looked he saw her strained face suddenly relax--saw the anxiety flee from her eyes--saw heart and soul take on new life. From far away across the river had come some faint popping sounds, regularly spaced--_three shots_.  \"Ah!\" he said, in wonder. \"What is that?\"  \"It _sounds_,\" laughed Herbert Cary's wife, \"like firing. But I think it is a friend of mine saluting me--from the safe side of the river. Good evening, Colonel,\" and she swept by him. She could go find Virgie now.  Just then came the sound of a horse, galloping. Up the road came a trooper, white with dust, his animal flecked with foam.  \"For Colonel Morrison. Urgent,\" he rasped from a dry throat, as he thudded across the lawn and dismounted. \"From headquarters,\" and he thrust out a dispatch, \"I'm ordered to return with your detachment.\"  Snatching the dispatch from the man's hand Morrison ran his eye over it--then started visibly.  \"Orderly! Report to Harris double-quick. Recall the men. Sound boots-and-saddles. Then bring my horse--_at once!_ Any details?\" he asked peremptorily of the courier.  \"Big battle to-morrow,\" the man answered. \"Two gunboats are reported coming up the river and a wing of the Rebel army is advancing from Petersburg. Every available detachment is ordered in. You are to reach camp before morning.\"  \"All right. We'll be there.\" Then, as the bugle sounded, \"Ride with us,\" he said, and strode over to where Mrs. Cary stood, arrested by the news.  \"Madam, I must make you a rather hurried farewell--and a last apology. If ever we meet again, I hope the conditions may be happier--for you.\"  \"I thank you, Colonel,\" the proud Southern woman said sincerely, with a curtsy. \"Some day the 'rebel scout' may thank you also for me and mine.\" And with a smile that augured friendship when that brighter day should come she passed out of his sight among the trees.  For a moment he watched her, proud at least that this proud woman was of his own race, then saw that the old negro, her only protector, still guarded the house.  \"Here, old man,\" he commanded, \"go along with your mistress and take care of her. I'll be the last to leave and see that nothing happens to the house.\"  \"Yas, seh. Thank'e, seh,\" said old Uncle Billy, coming down. \"If all of 'em was only lek you, seh--\"  Uncle Billy suddenly turned and looked up at the house, his mouth open in consternation. With a cry of anguish he pointed to an upper window.  \"Look what dey done done,\" he shrieked. \"Aw, Gawd a'mighty! Look what dey done done!\"  A cloud of smoke was rolling from the windows, shot through with yellow jets of flame. There was the sound of clumsy boots on the stairs and the door was thrown open. Dudley, escaped from arrest, ran out with a flaming pine torch in his hand.  \"Halt!\" cried Morrison, with raging anger. \"Dudley! HALT!\"  But Dudley knew that there would be little use in halting and so ran on until a big revolver barked behind him and he pitched heavily forward on his face. Morrison looked down on the prostrate form and his lips moved sadly, pityingly:  \"And I promised her--protection!\"     CHAPTER IV   Of all the memories of war, after the dear dead are buried, there is one that serves to bring the struggle back in all the intensity of its horrors--to stand both as a monument to those who bled and suffered and as a lonely sentinel mourning for the peace and plenty of the past--a blackened chimney.  Of all the houses, cabins, barns and cribs which had made up the home of the Carys a few short months ago nothing remained to-day but ashes and black ruin. Only one building had been left unburned and this, before the war, had been the cabin of an overseer. It had but two rooms, and a shallow attic, which was gained by means of an iron ladder reaching to a closely fitting scuttle in the ceiling. The larger room was furnished meagerly with a rough deal table, several common chairs, and a double-doored cupboard against the wall. In the deep, wide fire-place glowed a heap of raked-up embers, on which, suspended from an iron crane, a kettle simmered, sadly, as if in grief for her long-lost brother pots and pans. The plaster on the walls had broken away in patches, especially above the door, where the sunlight streamed through the gaping wound from a cannon shot. The door and window shutters were of heavy oak, swinging inward and fastening with bars; yet now they were open, and through them could be seen a dreary stretch of river bottom, withering beneath the rays of a July sun.  Beyond a distant fringe of trees the muddy James went murmuring down its muddy banks, where the blue cranes waited solemnly for the ebbing tide; where the crows cawed hoarsely in their busy, reeling flight, and the buzzards swung high above the marshes. Yet even in this waste of listless desolation came the echoed boom of heavy guns far down the river, where the \"Rebs\" and \"Yanks\" were pounding one another lazily.  From the woods which skirted the carriage road a man appeared--a thin, worn man, in a uniform of stained and tattered gray--a man who peered from right to left, as a hunted rabbit might, then darted across the road and plunged into the briery underbrush. Noiselessly he made his way to the now deserted cabin, creeping, crawling till he reached a point below an open window, then slowly raised himself and looked within.  \"Virgie!\" he whispered cautiously. \"Virgie!\"  No answer came. For a moment the man leaned dizzily against the windowsill, his eyes fast closed with a nameless dread, till he caught his grip again and entered the open door.  \"Virgie!\" he called, in a louder tone, moving swiftly but unsteadily toward the adjoining room. He flung its door open sharply, almost angrily; yet the name on his lips was tender, trembling, as he called: \"Virgie! Virgie!\"  In the loneliness of dread, he once more leaned for support against the wall, wondering, listening to the pounding of his heart, to the murmur of the muddy James, and the fall of a flake of plaster loosened by the dull reverberation of a distant gun; then suddenly his eye was caught by the kettle simmering on the fire, and he sighed in swift relief.  He wiped his brow with a ragged sleeve and went to where a water-bucket stood behind the door, knelt beside it, drinking deeply, gratefully, yet listening the while for unwonted sounds and watching the bend of the carriage road. His thirst appeased, he hunted vainly through the table drawer for balls and powder for the empty pistol at his hip; then, instinctively alert to some rustling sound outside, he crouched toward the adjoining room, slipped in, and softly closed the door.  From the sunlit world beyond the cabin walls rose the murmur of a childish song and Virgie came pattering in.  She had not changed greatly in stature in the past few months, but there was a very noticeable decrease in the girth of her little arms and body, and her big dark eyes seemed the larger for the whiteness of her face. On her head she wore an old calico bonnet several sizes too large and the gingham dress which scarcely reached to her bare, brown knees would not have done, a few months ago, for even Sally Ann. In one hand Virgie carried a small tin bucket filled with berries; in the other she clutched a doll lovingly against her breast.  Not the old Susan Jemima, but a new Susan Jemima on whom an equal affection was being lavished even though she was strangely and wonderfully made. To the intimate view of the unimaginative, Susan Jemima was formed from the limb of a cedar tree, the forking branches being her arms and legs, her costume consisting of a piece of rag tied at the waist with a bit of string.  On a chair at the table Virgie set her doll, then laughed at the hopelessness of its breakfasting with any degree of comfort, or of ease.  \"Why, Lord a-mercy, child, your chin don't come up to the table.\"  On the chair she placed a wooden box, perching the doll on top and taking a seat herself just opposite. She emptied the blackberries into a mutilated plate, brought from the cupboard a handful of toasted acorns, on which she poured boiling water, then set the concoction aside to steep.  \"Now, Miss Susan Jemima,\" said Virgie, addressing her vis-à-vis with the hospitable courtesy due to so great a lady, \"we are goin' to have some breakfas'.\" She paused, in a shade of doubt, then smiled a faint apology: \"It isn't very _much_ of a breakfas', darlin', but we'll make believe it's waffles an' chicken an'--an' hot rolls an' batter-bread an'--an' everything.\" She rose to her little bare feet, holding her wisp of a skirt aside, and made a sweeping bow. \"Allow me, Miss Jemima, to make you a mos' delicious cup of coffee.\"  And, while the little hostess prepared the meal, a man looked out from the partly open door behind her, with big dark eyes, which were like her own, yet blurred by a mist of pity and of love.  \"Susan,\" said the hostess presently, \"it's ready now, and we'll say grace; so don't you talk an' annoy your mother.\"  The tiny brown head was bowed. The tiny brown hands, with their berry-stained fingers, were placed on the table's edge; but Miss Susan Jemima sat bolt upright, though listening, it seemed, to the words of reverence falling from a mother-baby's lips:  \"Lord, make us thankful for the blackberries an' the aco'n coffee an'--an' all our blessin's; but please, sir, sen' us somethin' that tastes jus' a little better--if you don't mind. Amen!\"  And the man, who leaned against the door and watched, had also bowed his head. A pain was in his throat--and in his heart--a pain that gripped him, till two great tears rolled down his war-worn cheek and were lost in his straggling beard.  \"Virgie!\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Virgie!\"  She started at the sound and looked about her, wondering; then, as"]]]
