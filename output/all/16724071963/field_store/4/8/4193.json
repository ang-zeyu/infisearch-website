Humph!\" continued he, looking through the glass, \"they are through the wood, though, without a challenge.--Now, my booys, push him out of the gorse! Let's see vot you're made of.--There goes the first 'ound in.--It's Galloper, I believe.--I can almost see the bag of shot round his neck.--Now they all follow.--One--two--three--four--five--all together, my beauties! Oh, vot a sight! Peckham's cap's in the air, and it's a find, by heavens!\" Mr. Jorrocks is right.--The southerly wind wafts up the fading notes of the \"Huntsman's Chorus\" in _Der Frieschutz_ and confirms the fact.--Jorrocks is in ecstasies.--\"Now,\" said he, clawing up his breeches (for he dispenses with the article of braces when out hunting), \"that's what I calls fine. Oh, beautiful! beautiful!--Now, follow me if you please, and if yon gentleman in drab does not shoot the fox, he will be on the hills before long.\" Away they scampered along the top of the ridge, with a complete view of the operations below. At length Jorrocks stopped, and pulling the telescope out, began making an observation. \"There he is, at last,\" cried he, \"just crossed the corner of yon green field--now he creeps through the hedge by the fir-tree, and is in the fallow one. Yet, stay--that's no fox--it's a hare: and yet Tom Hills makes straight for the spot--and did you hear that loud tally-ho? Oh! gentlemen, gentlemen, we shall be laughed to scorn--what can they be doing--see, they take up the scent, and the whole pack have joined in chorus. Great heavens, it's no more a fox than I am!--No more brush than a badger! Oh, dear! oh, dear! that I should live to see my old friends, the Surrey fox'ounds, 'unt hare, and that too in the presence of a stranger.\" The animal made direct for the hills--whatever it was, the hounds were on good terms with it, and got away in good form. The sight was splendid--all the field got well off, nor between the cover and the hills was there sufficient space for tailing. A little elderly gentleman, in a pepper-and-salt coat, led the way gallantly--then came the scarlets--then the darks--and then the fustian-clad countrymen. Jorrocks was in a shocking state, and rolled along the hill-tops, almost frantic. The field reached the bottom, and the foremost commenced the steep ascent.  \"Oh, Tom Hills!--Tom Hills!--'what are you at? what are you after?'\" demanded Jorrocks, as he landed on the top. \"Here's a gentleman come all the way from the north-east side of the town of Boroughbridge, in the county of York, to see our excellent 'ounds, and here you are running a hare. Oh, Tom Hills! Tom Hills! ride forward, ride forward, and whip them off, ere we eternally disgrace ourselves.\" \"Oh,\" says Tom, laughing, \"he's a fox! but he's so tarnation frightened of our hounds, that his brush dropped off through very fear, as soon as ever he heard us go into the wood; if you go back, you'll find it somewhere, Mr. Jorrocks; haw, haw, haw! No fox indeed!\" said he.--\"Forrard, hounds, forrard!\" And away he went--caught the old whipper-in, dismounted him in a twinkling, and was on a fresh horse with his hounds in full cry. The line of flight was still along the hill-tops, and all eagerly pressed on, making a goodly rattle over the beds of flints. A check ensued. \"The guard on yonder nasty Brighton coach has frightened him with his horn,\" said Tom; \"now we must make a cast up to yonder garden, and see if he's taken shelter among the geraniums in the green-house. As little damage as possible, gentlemen, if you please, in riding through the nursery grounds. Now, hold hard, sir--pray do--there's no occasion for you to break the kale pots; he can't be under them. Ah, yonder he goes, the tailless beggar; did you see him as he stole past the corner out of the early-cabbage bed? Now bring on the hounds, and let us press him towards London.\"  \"See the conquering hero comes\", sounded through the avenue of elms as Tom dashed forward with the merry, merry pack. \"I shall stay on the hills\", said one, \"and be ready for him as he comes back; I took a good deal of the shine out of my horse in coming up this time\". \"I think I will do the same\", said two or three more. \"Let's be doing\", said Jorrocks, ramming his spurs into his nag to seduce him into a gallop, who after sending his heels in the air a few times in token of his disapprobation of such treatment, at last put himself into a round-rolling sort of canter, which Jorrocks kept up by dint of spurring and dropping his great bastinaderer of a whip every now and then across his shoulders. Away they go pounding together!  The line lies over flint fallows occasionally diversified with a turnip-field or market-garden, and every now and then a \"willa\" appears, from which emerge footmen in jackets, and in yellow, red and green plush breeches, with no end of admiring housemaids, governesses, and nurses with children in their arms.  Great was the emulation when any of these were approached, and the rasping sportsmen rushed eagerly to the \"fore.\" At last they approach \"Miss Birchwell's finishing and polishing seminary for young ladies,\" whose great flaring blue-and-gold sign, reflecting the noonday rays of the sun, had frightened the fox and caused him to alter his line and take away to the west. A momentary check ensued, but all the amateur huntsmen being blown, Tom, who is well up with his hounds, makes a quick cast round the house, and hits off the scent like a workman. A private road and a line of gates through fields now greet the eyes of our M'Adamisers. A young gentleman on a hired hunter very nattily attired, here singles himself out and takes place next to Tom, throwing the pebbles and dirt back in the eyes of the field. Tom crams away, throwing the gates open as he goes, and our young gentleman very coolly passes through, without a touch, letting them bang-to behind him. The Yorkshireman, who had been gradually creeping up, until he has got the third place, having opened two or three, and seeing another likely to close for want of a push, cries out to our friend as he approaches, \"Put out your hand, sir!\" The gentleman obediently extends his limb like the arm of a telegraph, and rides over half the next field with his hand in the air! The gate, of course, falls to.  A stopper appears--a gate locked and spiked, with a downward hinge to prevent its being lifted. To the right is a rail, and a ha-ha beyond it--to the left a quick fence. Tom glances at both, but turns short, and backing his horse, rides at the rail. The Yorkshireman follows, but Jorrocks, who espies a weak place in the fence a few yards from the gate, turns short, and jumping off, prepares to lead over. It is an old gap, and the farmer has placed a sheep hurdle on the far side. Just as Jorrocks has pulled that out, his horse, who is a bit of a rusher, and has got his \"monkey\" completely up, pushes forward while his master is yet stooping--and hitting him in the rear, knocks him clean through the fence, head foremost into a squire-trap beyond!--\"Non redolet sed olet!\" exclaims the Yorkshireman, who dismounts in a twinkling, lending his friend a hand out of the unsavoury cesspool.--\"That's what comes of hunting in a new[12] saddle, you see,\" added he, holding his nose. Jorrocks scrambles upon \"terra firma\" and exhibits such a spectacle as provokes the shouts of the field. He has lost his wig, his hat hangs to his back, and one side of his person and face is completely japanned with black odoriferous mixture. \"My vig!\" exclaims he, spitting and spluttering, \"but that's the nastiest hole I ever was in--Fleet Ditch is lavender-water compared to it! Hooi yonder!\" hailing a lad, \"Catch my 'oss, boouy!\" Tom Hills has him; and Jorrocks, pocketing his wig, remounts, rams his spurs into the nag, and again tackles with the pack, which had come to a momentary check on the Eden Bridge road. The fox has been headed by a party of gipsies, and, changing his point, bends southward and again reaches the hills, along which some score of horsemen have planted themselves in the likeliest places to head him. Reynard, however, is too deep for them, and has stolen down unperceived. Poor Jorrocks, what with the violent exertion of riding, his fall, and the souvenir of the cesspool that he still bears about him, pulls up fairly exhausted. \"Oh, dear,\" says he, scraping the thick of the filth off his coat with his whip, \"I'm reglarly blown, I earn't go down with the 'ounds this turn; but, my good fellow,\" turning to the Yorkshireman, who was helping to purify him, \"don't let me stop you, go down by all means, but mind, bear in mind the quarter of house-lamb--at half-past five to a minute.\"  [Footnote 12: There is a superstition among sportsmen that they are sure to get a fall the first day they appear in anything new.]  Many of the cits now gladly avail themselves of the excuse of assisting Mr. Jorrocks to clean himself for pulling up, but as soon as ever those that are going below hill are out of sight and they have given him two or three wipes, they advise him to let it \"dry on,\" and immediately commence a different sort of amusement--each man dives into his pocket and produces the eatables.  Part of Jorrocks's half-quartern loaf was bartered with the captain of an East Indiaman for a slice of buffalo-beef. The dentist exchanged some veal sandwiches with a Jew for ham ones; a lawyer from the Borough offered two slices of toast for a hard-boiled egg; in fact there was a petty market \"ouvert\" held. \"Now, Tomkins, where's the bottle?\" demanded Jenkins. \"Vy, I thought you would bring it out to-day,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15387"],["title","Jorrocks' Jaunts and Jollities (#7)"],["body","he; \"I brought it last time, you know.\" \"Take a little of mine, sir,\" said a gentleman, presenting a leather-covered flask--\"real Thomson and Fearon, I assure you.\" \"I wish someone would fetch an ocean of porter from the nearest public,\" said another. \"Take a cigar, sir?\" \"No; I feel werry much obliged, but they always make me womit.\" \"Is there any gentleman here going to Halifax, who would like to make a third in a new yellow barouche, with lavender-coloured wheels, and pink lining?\" inquired Mr.----, the coach-maker. \"Look at the hounds, gentlemen sportsmen, my noble sportsmen!\" bellowed out an Epsom Dorling's correct--cardseller--and turning their eyes in the direction in which he was looking, our sportsmen saw them again making for the hills. Pepper-and-salt first, and oh, what a goodly tail was there!--three quarters of a mile in length, at the least. Now up they come--the \"corps de reserve\" again join, and again a party halt upon the hills. Again Tom Hills exchanges horses; and again the hounds go on in full cry. \"I must be off,\" said a gentleman in balloon-like leathers to another tiger; \"we have just time to get back to town, and ride round by the park before it is dark--much better than seeing the end of this brute. Let us go\"; and away they went to canter through Hyde Park in their red coats. \"I must go and all,\" said another gentleman; \"my dinner will be ready at five, and it is now three.\" Jorrocks was game; and forgetting the quarter of house-lamb, again tackled with the pack. A smaller sweep sufficed this time, and the hills were once more descended, Jorrocks the first to lead the way. He well knew the fox was sinking, and was determined to be in at the death. Short running ensued--a check--the fox had lain down, and they had overrun the scent. Now they were on him, and Tom Hills's who-whoop confirmed the whole.  \"Ah! Tom Hills, Tom Hills!\" exclaimed Jorrocks, as the former took up the fox, \"'ow splendid, 'ow truly brilliant--by Jove, you deserve to be Lord Hill--oh, had he but a brush that we might present it to this gentleman from the north-east side of the town of Boroughbridge, in the county of York, to show the gallant doings of the men of Surrey!\" \"Ay,\" said Tom, \"but Squire----'s keeper has been before us for it.\"  \"Now,\" said a gentleman in a cap, to another in a hat, \"if you will ride up the hill and collect the money there, I will do so below--half-a-crown, if you please, sir--half-a-crown, if you please, sir.--Have I got your half-a-crown, sir?\"--\"Here's three shillings if you will give me sixpence.\" \"Certainly, sir--certainly.\" \"We have no time to spare,\" said Jorrocks, looking at his watch. \"Good afternoon, gentlemen, good afternoon,\" muttering as he went, \"a quarter of house-lamb at half-past five--Mrs. Jorrocks werry punctual--old Fleecy werry particular.\" They cut across country to Croydon, and as they approached the town, innumerable sportsmen came flocking in from all quarters. \"What sport have you had?\" inquired Jorrocks of a gentleman in scarlet; \"have you been with Jolliffe?\" \"No, with the staghounds; three beautiful runs; took him once in a millpond, once in a barn, and once in a brickfield--altogether the finest day's sport I ever saw in my life.\" \"What have you done, Mr. J----?\" \"Oh, we have had a most gallant thing; a brilliant run indeed--three hours and twenty minutes without a check--over the finest country imaginable.\" \"And who got the brush?\" inquired the stag-man. \"Oh, it was a gallant run,\" said Jorrocks, \"by far the finest I ever remember.\" \"But did you kill?\" demanded his friend. \"Kill! to be sure we did. When don't the Surrey kill, I should like to know?\" \"And who got his brush, did you say?\" \"I can't tell,\" said he--\"didn't hear the gentleman's name.\" \"What sport has Mr. Meager had to-day?\" inquired he of a gentleman in trousers, who issued from a side lane into the high road. \"I have been with the Sanderstead, sir--a very capital day's sport--run five hares and killed three. We should have killed four--only--we didn't.\" \"I don't think Mr. Meager has done anything to-day.\" \"Yes, he has,\" said a gentleman, who just joined with a hare buckled on in front of his saddle, and his white cords all stained with blood; \"we killed this chap after an hour and forty-five minutes' gallop; and accounted for another by losing her after running upwards of-three-quarters of an hour.\" \"Well, then, we have all had sport,\" said Jorrocks, as he spurred his horse into a trot, and made for Morton's stables--\"and if the quarter of house-lamb is but right, then indeed am I a happy man.\"    III. SURREY SHOOTING: MR. JORROCKS IN TROUBLE  Our readers are now becoming pretty familiar with our principal hero, Mr. Jorrocks, and we hope he improves on acquaintance. Our fox-hunting friends, we are sure, will allow him to be an enthusiastic member of the brotherhood, and though we do not profess to put him in competition with Musters, Osbaldeston, or any of those sort of men, we yet mean to say that had his lot been cast in the country instead of behind a counter, his keenness would have rendered him as conspicuous--if not as scientific--as the best of them.  For a cockney sportsman, however, he is a very excellent fellow--frank, hearty, open, generous, and hospitable, and with the exception of riding up Fleet Street one Saturday afternoon, with a cock-pheasant's tail sticking out of his red coat pocket, no one ever saw him do a cock tail action in his life.  The circumstances attending that exhibition are rather curious.--He had gone out as usual on a Saturday to have a day with the Surrey, but on mounting his hunter at Croydon, he felt the nag rather queer under him, and thinking he might have been pricked in the shoeing, he pulled up at the smith's at Addington to have his feet examined. This lost him five minutes, and unfortunately when he got to the meet, he found that a \"travelling[13] fox\" had been tallied at the precise moment of throwing off, with which the hounds had gone away in their usual brilliant style, to the tune of \"Blue bonnets are over the border.\" As may be supposed, he was in a deuce of a rage; and his first impulse prompted him to withdraw his subscription and be done with the hunt altogether, and he trotted forward \"on the line,\" in the hopes of catching them up to tell them so. In this he was foiled, for after riding some distance, he overtook a string of Smithfield horses journeying \"foreign for Evans,\" whose imprints he had been taking for the hoof-marks of the hunters. About noon he found himself dull, melancholy, and disconsolate, before the sign of the \"Pig and Whistle,\" on the Westerham road, where, after wetting his own whistle with a pint of half-and-half, he again journeyed onward, ruminating on the uncertainty and mutability of all earthly affairs, the comparative merits of stag-, fox-, and hare-hunting, and the necessity of getting rid of the day somehow or other in the country.  [Footnote 13: He might well be called a \"travelling fox,\" for it was said he had just travelled down from Herring's, in the New Road, by the Bromley stage.]  Suddenly his reverie was interrupted by the discharge of a gun in the field adjoining the hedge along which he was passing, and the boisterous whirring of a great cock-pheasant over his head, which caused his horse to start and stop short, and to nearly pitch Jorrocks over his head. The bird was missed, but the sportsman's dog dashed after it, with all the eagerness of expectation, regardless of the cracks of the whip--the \"comes to heel,\" and \"downs to charge\" of the master. Jorrocks pulled out his hunting telescope, and having marked the bird down with the precision of a billiard-table keeper, rode to the gate to acquaint the shooter with the fact, when to his infinite amazement he discovered his friend, Nosey Browne (late of \"The Surrey\"), who, since his affairs had taken the unfortunate turn mentioned in the last paper, had given up hunting and determined to confine himself to shooting only. Nosey, however, was no great performer, as may be inferred, when we state that he had been in pursuit of the above-mentioned cock-pheasant ever since daybreak, and after firing thirteen shots at him had not yet touched a feather.  His dog was of the right sort--for Nosey at least--and hope deferred had not made his heart sick; on the contrary, he dashed after his bird for the thirteenth time with all the eagerness he displayed on the first. \"Let me have a crack at him,\" said Jorrocks to Nosey, after their mutual salutations were over. \"I know where he is, and I think I can floor him.\" Browne handed the gun to Jorrocks, who, giving up his hunter in exchange, strode off, and having marked his bird accurately, he kicked him up out of a bit of furze, and knocked him down as \"dead as a door-nail.\" By that pheasant's tail hangs the present one.  Now Nosey Browne and Jorrocks were old friends, and Nosey's affairs having gone crooked, why of course, like most men in a similar situation, he was all the better for it; and while his creditors were taking twopence-halfpenny in the pound, he was taking his diversion on his wife's property, which a sagacious old father-in-law had secured to the family in the event of such a contingency as a failure happening; so knowing Jorrock's propensity for sports, and being desirous of chatting over all his gallant doings with \"The Surrey,\" shortly after the above-mentioned day he dispatched a \"twopenny,\" offering him a day's shooting on his property in Surrey, adding, that he hoped he would dine with him after. Jorrocks being invited himself, with a freedom peculiar to fox-hunters, invited his friend the Yorkshireman, and visiting his armoury, selected him a regular shot-scatterer of a gun, capable of carrying ten yards on every side.  At the appointed hour on the appointed morning, the Yorkshireman appeared in Great Coram Street, where he found Mr. Jorrocks in the parlour in the act of settling himself into "]]]
