FORMULA FOR THE LESSON ON THE LUNGS AND RESPIRATION.  1. My lungs are the bellows or breathing machines of my body.  2. They are composed of a soft, fleshy substance, full of small air-cells and tubes. They are porous and spongy when healthy, but in some diseases become an almost solid mass, through which the air cannot pass.  3. I breathe by drawing the air through my windpipe, along the tubes into the cells of my lungs, swelling them out, and causing my chest to expand; then the chest contracts, and the impure vapor in my lungs is pressed out through the same tubes, windpipe, nose, and mouth, into the atmosphere.  4. I cannot live without breathing, because if the air does not go down into my lungs, the dark blood in them is not changed into pure red blood, and goes back through my body dark blood, which cannot keep me alive.  5. If I would have healthy lungs,     I must breathe pure air,     I must live in the sunlight,     I must keep my body clean,     I must wear loose clothing,     I must wear clean clothing,     I must sit and stand erect,     I must keep all parts of my body warm,     I must not change my winter clothing too early in the spring,     I must avoid draughts of cool air,     I must not rush into the cold when I am in a perspiration,     I must not poison my lungs with alcohol or tobacco.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.  1.

The air which enters through the nose and mouth passes into a tube of muscles and ring-like pieces of cartilage. The upper part of this tube is the voice-box or _larynx_, covered by a spoon-shaped lid which closes when we swallow; the lower part is the _trachea_, and the two parts are the windpipe. The trachea divides into two branches, _the bronchial tubes_, one for each lung. These tubes divide again and again like the branches of a tree, and end in exceedingly small sacs or bags. The air in these sacs, or air-cells, gives _oxygen_ to the blood in the tiny blood-vessels of the lungs and takes from them the poison, _carbonic-acid gas_, water, and impurities, which it carries back through the windpipe into the outside air.         *       *       *       *       *  QUESTIONS ON THE LUNGS AND RESPIRATION.  Of what are the lungs composed?--\"Of a soft, fleshy substance, full of small air-cells and tubes.\"  Of what use are the lungs?--\"They are the breathing machines of the body.\"  How do the lungs appear when healthy?--\"Porous and spongy.\"  How does the air get into the lungs?--\"The air flows through the nose and mouth, into the windpipe and along the air-tubes, into the air-cells of the lungs.\"  What does the air do in the lungs?--\"It swells the lungs and causes the chest to expand.\"  What do you mean by expand?--\"To increase in size.\"  How is the air expelled from the lungs?--\"The chest contracts and sends the impure air through the tubes and windpipe, the nose and mouth, into the atmosphere.\"  What do you mean by contracts?--\"Becomes smaller.\"  What do you mean by atmosphere?--\"The air.\"  Of what use is the air when it is in the lungs?--\"It makes the blood pure.\"  Why can you not live without breathing?--\"Because, if I do not breathe, pure air cannot get into the lungs to make the bad blood pure, and I cannot live if the dark, impure blood is sent back again through my body.\"  Why must you live in the sunlight?--\"Because the sunlight helps to purify the blood and strengthen the body.\"  Why must you wear loose clothing?--\"Because tight clothing stops the circulation of the blood.\"  Why must you avoid tight-lacing?--\"Because tight-lacing crowds the ribs against the lungs, so that the lungs cannot move freely.\"  Why should you wear clean clothing?--\"That nothing impure may pass into the body through the pores of the skin.\"  Why should you keep the body clean?--\"That the pores of the skin may not be closed, but remain open to let the perspiration pass through.\"  What has the cleanliness of the body to do with the health of the lungs?--\"If the body is not kept clean, the perspiratory pores become clogged.\"  What happens when the perspiratory pores are clogged?--\"The impure particles which should pass through them stay in the body, and cause disease in the lungs or other parts.\"  Why should you sit and stand erect?--\"Because, if I am in the habit of stooping, my lungs will be crowded, and will not have enough room to move freely.\"  Why should you keep all parts of the body warm?--\"Because chilling any part of the body causes the blood to chill in that part, and thus hinders its circulation.\"  Why should you not change your winter clothing too early in the spring of the year?--\"I may take cold if not warmly clothed during the cool days of early spring.\"  Why should you avoid draughts of cool air?--\"Because the cool air blows upon some parts of the body and closes the pores of the skin, checking the perspiration, and hindering the circulation of the blood.\"  Why should you not rush suddenly from a warm to a cool place?--\"Because when warm the pores of the skin are open; if I rush suddenly into the cool air, these pores are closed too quickly.\"  Why does stopping the perspiration hurt the lungs more or less?--\"The impurities it ought to carry away remain in the body, make the blood impure, and produce disease in some part; very often that part is the lungs.\"  What harm does alcohol do in the lungs?--\"It fills the lungs with impure blood.\"  What harm does it do to the air-cells?--\"It hardens the walls of the air-cells of the lungs.\"  What harm is done by the hardening of these air-cells?--\"1. The lungs cannot take in enough of the gas called oxygen to purify the blood perfectly. 2. The gases or vapors in the lungs cannot pass freely through the hardened air-cells.\"  What happens from this?--\"The lungs become diseased.\"  From what disease do some hard drinkers suffer?--\"Alcoholic consumption, for which there is no cure.\" See Appendices on Alcohol and Tobacco.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.]    1.

When my food is chewed, it is rolled by my tongue into the oesophagus, or food-pipe, which is back of my windpipe, and leads from my mouth down along the side of my spine, to the left and upper end of my stomach.  2. My stomach is an oblong, soft, and fleshy bag, extending from my left to my right side, below my lungs and heart.  3. It is composed of three coats or membranes, and resembles tripe.  4. The _outer coat_ is smooth, thick, and tough. It supports and strengthens the stomach.  5. The _middle coat_ is fibrous. Its fibres have the power of contracting, sometimes pressing upon the food, and sometimes pushing it along toward the opening which leads out of the stomach.  6. The _inner coat_ is soft, thick, spongy, and wrinkled. It prepares a slimy substance and a fluid. The slimy substance prevents the stomach from being irritated by the food. The fluid dissolves the food.  7. Food passes through several changes after it enters the mouth.  8. It is changed into pulp in the _mouth_, by the action of the teeth and the saliva. This is called _mastication_. It is changed in the _stomach_, by the action of the stomach and the gastric juice, into another kind of pulp called _chyme_. The chyme is changed by the bile and another kind of juice, called _pancreatic_ _juice_; these separate the nourishing from the waste substance.

The waste substance passes from the body. The chyle is poured into a vein behind the collar bone, and passes through the heart to the lungs, where it is changed into blood.  9.

My brain is a soft gray-and-white mass resembling marrow.  2. It is placed in a bony box called the skull; it is covered and held together by three coats or membranes.  3. The outer membrane is thick and firm; it strengthens and supports the brain.  4. The middle membrane is thick, and somewhat like a spider's web in appearance.  5. The inner membrane is a network of blood-vessels.  6. From the brain, white or reddish gray pulpy cords, called nerves, pass to all parts of the body. These nerves are of two kinds: nerves of feeling, and nerves of motion.  7. If I prick my finger, a nerve of feeling carries the message to my brain; if I wish to move my finger, a nerve of motion causes my finger to obey my will.  8. Twelve pairs of nerves pass from the base of the brain: the first pair, called the nerves of smell, to my nose; the fourth pair, called the nerves of sight, to my eyes; the fifth pair, called the nerves of taste, to my mouth, tongue, and teeth. One pair pass to my face; another to my ears. The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth pairs to my tongue and parts of my throat and neck.[3]  9.
