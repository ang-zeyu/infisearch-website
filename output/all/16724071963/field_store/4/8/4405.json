At last Dick became so unhappy that he made up his mind to run away.  He started early in the morning, before any one in the house was up.  He had gone but a short way when he heard the sound of the six great bells of Bow.  As they rang, \"Ding-dong, ding-dong!\" they seemed to say:      Turn back, Whittington,     Lord Mayor of London.  \"It is strange that the bells should speak to me,\" said Dick, \"but if I am to be Lord Mayor of London, I will gladly turn back.\"  So he ran back to the house of Mr. Fitzwarren.  \"I hope they have not missed me,\" said Dick, as he gently opened the door and stole softly in.   DICK WHITTINGTON--III  Dick's cat was taken across the ocean. The ship sailed and sailed, until at last it came to a distant country.  Now the king and queen of this country were very rich. When the captain was asked to show his goods before them he was very glad indeed to do so.  The king and queen first gave the captain a great feast.  Gold and silver dishes filled with food were brought in.  [Illustration]  When these dishes were placed upon the table an army of rats came out.  There were white rats, and black rats, and brown rats, and big rats, and little rats.  At once they fell upon the food and ate it nearly all up.  \"Why do you let the rats do this?\" asked the captain.  \"Alas, we cannot help ourselves,\" said the king. \"I would give half my kingdom to be rid of them.\"  Then the captain thought of Dick Whittington's cat.  \"I have an animal which will rid you of them,\" said the captain.  \"Pray bring it in at once,\" said the queen.  What fun Dick's cat had killing the rats and mice in the king's palace!  \"We must buy that little animal,\" said the queen. \"I do not care how much she may cost.\"  The captain could hardly carry all the jewels and gold that the king gave him for the cat.  Then the ship with Dick's money came back to London, and the captain told the story to Mr. Fitzwarren.  \"We must take these jewels and all this gold at once to Mr. Whittington,\" said the honest man. \"He is no longer a poor boy, for this has made him rich.\"  [Illustration]  They found Dick in the kitchen blacking the stove.  \"Come with me at once into the parlor,\" said Mr. Fitzwarren.  Then the bags of gold and jewels were piled at Dick's feet.  \"See what your cat has brought you,\" said Mr. Fitzwarren. \"You are now a rich man and may yet be Lord Mayor of London.\"  And it is true that after Dick Whittington became a man, he was made Lord Mayor of London.  _English Folk Tale_     [Illustration]      THE NEW MOON        Dear mother, how pretty       The moon looks to-night!     She was never so cunning before;       Her two little horns       Are so sharp and so bright,     I hope she'll not grow any more.        If I were up there,       With you and my friends,     I'd rock in it nicely, you'd see;       I'd sit in the middle       And hold by both ends.       Oh, what a bright cradle 'twould be!        I would call to the stars       To keep out of the way,     Lest we should rock over their toes;       And then I would rock       Till the dawn of the day,     And see where the pretty moon goes.        And there we would stay       In the beautiful skies,     And through the bright clouds we would roam;       We would see the sun set,       And see the sun rise,     And on the next rainbow come home.      ELIZA LEE FOLLEN     [Illustration]  BRIAR ROSE--I   A long time ago there lived a king and queen who were very, very sad because they had no children.  One day, when the queen was resting near a spring, a frog crept out of the water and said to her:  \"You shall have your wish. Within a year you shall have a little girl.\"  What the frog said came true.  The queen had a little child who was so beautiful that the king gave a party in her honor.  He wished to invite all the wise women in the land, for these wise women could grant fairy gifts to his little child.  There were thirteen of them, but only twelve were invited, as the king had only twelve golden plates.  After the dinner was over, the wise women in turn arose from the table and named their fairy gifts to the little princess.  The first gave to her goodness; the second, beauty; the third, riches; and so on, up to the last.  Before the twelfth wise woman could speak, in walked the thirteenth.  This woman was in a great rage because she had not been invited.  She cried in a loud voice, \"When the princess is fifteen years old she shall prick her finger with a spindle and shall fall down dead.\"  At these words every one turned pale with fright.  The twelfth wise woman, who had not yet spoken, now came up and said:  \"I could not stop this woman's evil words, I can only make them less harsh.  The king's child shall not die, but a deep sleep shall fall upon her, in which she shall stay one hundred years.\"   BRIAR ROSE--II  The little princess was so beautiful, so kind; and so good that no one who knew her could help loving her.  As she grew older the king and queen began to feel very unhappy, for they could not help thinking of what was to happen to their dear little daughter.  They ordered all the spindles in the kingdom to be burned.  Now, as it happened, on the very day that the princess was fifteen years old the king and queen were away from home.  The princess was quite alone in the castle, and she rain about over the palace, looking in at rooms and halls, just as her fancy led her.  At last she came to an old tower at the top of a winding stair.  She saw a little door.  In the lock was a rusty key.  When she turned it, the door flew open.  There, in a small room, sat an old woman with her spindle, spinning flax.  \"Good Morning,\" said the princess. \"Do tell me what that funny thing is that jumps about so.\"  And then she held out her hand to take the spindle.  It came about just as the fairy had foretold.  The princess pricked her finger with the spindle.  At once she fell upon a bed which was near, and lay in a deep sleep as if dead.  This sleep came not only upon the princess, but spread over the whole castle.  The king and queen, who had just come home, fell asleep, and all their lords and ladies with them.  The horses went to sleep in the stable; the dogs in the yard; the doves on the roof; the flies on the wall; yes, even the fire that burned in the fireplace grew still and slept.  The meat stopped roasting before the fire.  The cook in the kitchen was just going to box the ears of the kitchen boy, but her hand dropped and she sank to sleep.  Outside the castle the wind was still, and upon the trees not a leaf stirred.  In a short time there sprung up around the castle a hedge of thorn bushes.  Year by year the hedge grew higher and higher, until at last nothing of the castle could be seen above it, not even the roof, nor the chimneys, nor the flag on the tower.   BRIAR ROSE--III  As years went by the story of the sleeping beauty was told all over the kingdom.  Many kings' sons came and tried to get through the hedge of thorns, but this they could not do.  The sharp thorns seemed to have hands which held the young men fast.  After many, many years a prince came from a far-off kingdom.  He heard the story of the castle and its sleeping beauty.  He knew what danger lay in the great hedge of thorn bushes.  But the young prince was brave, and he was not to be turned back.  \"I am not afraid. I will go out and see this beautiful Briar Rose,\" he said.  It happened that the hundred years of the magic spell had just ended.  The day had come when the sleeping princess was to wake up again.  As the prince came to the hedge of thorn bushes, it was in full bloom and covered with beautiful red flowers. There, through the thorn bushes, lay a wide road.  Soon the prince came to the gates of the castle.  He found the horses and dogs lying asleep on the ground.  The doves sat on the roof with their heads under their wings.  He went into the castle.  Even the flies on the wall still slept.  Near the throne lay the king and queen, while all around were the sleeping lords and ladies.  [Illustration]  The whole castle was so still that he could hear his heart beat.  The prince went on from room to room until he came to the old tower.  Going up the winding stair he saw the little door.  A rusty key was in the lock, and the door was half open.  There before him lay the sleeping princess.  The prince bent down and gave her a kiss.  As he did so the sleeping beauty opened her eyes. With her the whole castle awoke.  The king waked up, and the queen, and all the lords and ladies.  The horses in the stable stood up and shook themselves.  The dogs jumped about and wagged their tails.  The doves on the roof lifted their heads and flew into the fields.  The flies on the wall began to buzz.  The fire in the kitchen began to burn.  The meat began to roast.  The cook boxed the ears of the kitchen boy, so that he ran off crying.  The hedge of thorn bushes around the castle dried up and blew away.  Then the prince married the beautiful princess, and they lived happily ever after.  WILLIAM AND JACOB GRIMM         ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL      All things bright and beautiful,       All creatures great and small,     All things wise and wonderful,       The Lord God made them all.      Each little flower that opens,       Each little bird that sings,     He made their glowing colors,       He made their tiny wings.      The cold wind in the winter,       The pleasant summer sun,     The ripe fruits in the garden,       He made them every one.      He gave us eyes to see them,       And lips that we might tell     How great is God Almighty,       Who hath made all things well.      MRS. C.F. ALEXANDER     [Illustration]  THE BAKER BOYS AND THE BEES--I  trouble  Andernach  guarded   Long years ago many cities had great stone walls around them.  The walls were built to keep out enemies, for in those old days cities often went to war"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15659"],["title","The Beacon Second Reader (#8)"],["body","one another.  The city of Andernach had around it one of these great walls.  There was only one gateway into the city, and this gateway was guarded by strong iron doors.  Just behind the doors lived a gatekeeper, who did nothing but open and shut the gates.  He watched them well.  No one could come in who was not friendly to the city.  The gates were not opened very often. Some days they were not opened at all. So the gatekeeper had much spare time.  \"I am very fond of honey,\" thought he. \"I think I will buy a few hives of bees. I can place the hives on the top of the wall. There nobody will trouble them.\"  Soon there were rows of beehives on the top of the wall over the gate.  It happened that, not far away, there was another walled city, named Lintz.  The people of Lintz were the enemies of the people of Andernach.  They were always watching each other, and fought when they could get a chance.  Now the people of Lintz planned to attack and capture the city of Andernach.  They called their wisest men together to see how the attack should be made.  Many plans were talked over.  At length an old man said, \"Men of Lintz, you know that the men of Andernach are lazy. They like to lie late in their beds. If we attack the city at sunrise, we shall capture it before they can get their eyes open.\"  This plan seemed wise to the people of Lintz, and in army was soon ready to march against the city of Andernach.  One dark night the army crept softly toward the walls of the sleeping city.   THE BAKER BOYS AND THE BEES--II  The only people who rose early in Andernach were the bakers. They had to have fresh bread ready for breakfast.  After their work was done the bakers used to have a morning nap, but the baker boys had to stay awake and watch the loaves of bread.  Two of these boys, named Hans and Fritz, were fast friends and were always together.  One morning, just at sunrise, Hans said to Fritz, \"Let us creep upon the wall over the gatekeeper's house. I think we can find some honey. The old gatekeeper is asleep; he will not hear us.\"  The two boys crept softly up the stairs.  They soon reached the top of the wall.  \"Did you hear that noise?\" whispered Fritz.  \"Yes, it must be the old gatekeeper,\" said Hans, in a low voice.  \"No, it seems to come from over the wall,\" said Fritz.  The two boys crawled to the edge of the wall and carefully looked over.  There stood the army of Lintz.  A ladder was placed against the wall.  The soldiers would soon mount over the gate into the city.  What was to be done?  There was no time to wake the people.  What could two boys do against an army?  In an instant Fritz thought of the beehives.  Ah, the bees were awake if the people were not!  Each boy seized a hive and bore it carefully to the edge of the wall.  Then with a strong push down tumbled hives, honey, and bees upon the heads of the enemy.  Such buzzing, such stinging, such shouting as arose!  The boys ran down the stairs to the city hall.  [Illustration]  The old bell ringer was aroused by the cries.  Soon the wild clang of the bell awoke the people of Andernach.  Armed men ran to the city gate, but the bees had done their work well. There was no need for soldiers.  The army of Lintz was running away.  Over the great gate the people of Andernach placed a statue of the two baker boys whose quick wit had saved the city.  _German Folk Tale_         FALLING SNOW      See the pretty snowflakes       Falling from the sky;     On the wall and housetops       Soft and thick they lie.      On the window ledges,       On the branches bare;     Now how fast they gather,       Filling all the air.      Look into the garden,       Where the grass was green;     Covered by the snowflakes,       Not a blade is seen.      Now the bare black bushes       All look soft and white,     Every twig is laden,--       What a pretty sight!      ANONYMOUS     LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES   All the world must know that Two Shoes was not her real name. No; her father's name was Meanwell, and he was for many years a well-to-do farmer.  While Margery (for that was her real name) was yet a little girl her father became very poor. He was so poor that at last he and Margery's mother and Margery and her little brother were all turned out of doors. They did not have a roof to cover their heads.  Margery's father felt so unhappy that at last he died, and only a few days later Margery's mother died, too. Poor little Margery and her brother were left alone in the wide world.  Their sorrow would have made you pity them, but it would have done your heart good to see how fond they were of each other. They always went about hand in hand, and when you saw one you were sure to see the other.  [Illustration]  Look at them in the picture.  They were both very ragged, and though Tommy had two shoes, Margery had but one. They had nothing, poor little things, to live upon but what kind people gave to them. Each night they lay on the hay in just such a barn as you see here.  [Illustration]   LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES--II  Mr. Smith was a very good man who lived in the town where little Margery and Tommy were born. Although he was a poor man, he took the children home to live with him.  \"They shall not want for food nor for a bed to sleep in while I live,\" he said.  Mr. Smith had a friend who was a very wealthy man. When he heard the story about Margery and Tommy, this man gave Mr. Smith some money to buy little Margery a new pair of shoes and Tommy a new suit of clothes. Can you see Tommy in the picture wearing his new clothes?  [Illustration]  The gentleman who had given the money for Margery's new shoes and Tommy's new clothes wished to take Tommy with him to London to make a sailor of him.  When the time came for Tommy to go, both children began to cry. They kissed each other a hundred times. At last Tommy wiped away Margery's tears and said:  \"Don't cry, little sister, for I will come home to you again and bring you beautiful clothes and much money.\"  That night Margery went to bed weeping for her dear little brother. It was the first time they had ever been parted.  The next morning the shoemaker came in with Margery's new shoes. She put them on in great glee and ran out to Mrs. Smith crying, \"Two shoes, two shoes. See goody two shoes!\" This she did to all the people she met, so that soon she was known far and wide as Goody Two Shoes.   LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES--III  Dear little Margery saw how good and wise Mr. Smith was. She thought it was because he read so many books.  Soon Margery wished, above all things, to learn to read. She would borrow books from the school children and sit down and read and read. Very soon she could read better than any of her playmates.  Margery took such delight in her books that she wished everybody else could read, too, so she formed this plan of teaching very little children how to read.  First, she made letters out of bits of wood with her knife. She worked and worked until there were ten sets of the small letters:      a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  and six sets of the large letters:      A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  She then made the little tots spell words with her wooden letters. Take the word \"plum-pudding\" (and who can think of a better one!); the first little child picked up the letter p, the next l, the next u, the next m, and so on, until the whole word was spelled.  If a child took up a wrong letter, he was to pay a fine or play no more.  Each morning, with her basket full of wooden letters, Margery went around from house to house. The little children learned to read very fast.  Can you see Margery with her basket of letters in this picture?  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The first house she came to was Farmer Wilson's. See, here it is.  Margery stopped and ran up to the door. Tap, tap, tap.  \"Who is there?\"  \"Only little Goody Two Shoes,\" said Margery, \"come to teach Billy.\"  \"Is that you, little Goody?\" said Mrs. Wilson. \"I am glad to see you.\"  Then out came the little boy.  \"How do, Doody Two Shoes,\" said he, not being able to speak plainly.  Margery took little Billy by the hand and led him to a quiet spot under a tree. Then she threw the letters on the ground all mixed up together like this:      z a y w b m p j f x c o q g e k v n i d h r i t u s  Billy picked them up, calling each one by its right name, and put them all in just their right places. They now looked like this:      a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  Do you think you could have done as well as little Billy?  The next place Margery came to was Farmer Simpson's, and here it is.  [Illustration]  \"Bowwow, wow,\" said the dog at the door.  \"Be still, sir,\" said Mrs. Simpson. \"Why do you bark at little Two Shoes? Come, Alice, here is Goody Two Shoes ready to teach you.\"  Then out came the little one.  \"Well, Alice,\" said Two Shoes, \"have you learned your lesson?\"  \"Yes, indeed, I have,\" said the little one, and taking the letters, she formed them in this way:      ba be bi bo bu da de di do du     fa fe fi fo fu ha he hi ho hu  As she formed them she gave their exact sounds.  The next place Margery came to was Gaffer Cook's house. Here a number of poor children all came around her at once. These children had been to her school longer than the first little tots, and could read words and lines.  This is what Margery gave them to read:  \"He that will thrive must rise by five.\"  \"Truth can be blamed, but cannot be shamed.\"  \"A friend in your need is a friend indeed.\"  \"A wise head makes a close mouth.\"  \"A lie stands upon one leg, but truth upon two.\"  \"A good boy will make a good man.\"  \"Honor your parents and the world will honor you.\"  \"Love your friends and your friends will love you.\"  Did you ever read lines like these in your school reader?   LITTLE GOODY TWO SHOES--IV  At last Margery grew up and was given a real school to teach and a real schoolroom to teach in. She still used her little wooden letters,"]]]
