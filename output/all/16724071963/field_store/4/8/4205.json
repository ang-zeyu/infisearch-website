Thus reassured Sally Ann continued:  \"I gwine down stairs to git my dinner When I come back, I sho' gwine kill you. Fyar you well,\" and Blue Beard, making a wide circle around the carriage whip, took himself off the scene.  \"Now, Mother,\" Virgie announced, \"I have to watch at the castle window,\" and she jumped up on the bench.  \"Sister Anne; Sister Anne, do you see anybody coming?\"  \"No one, Fatima--nothing but a cloud of dust made by the wind.\"  \"Look again, Sister Anne. Do you see anybody coming?\"  \"Oh, Fatima, Fatima. It's growing bigger.\"  \"Dar now,\" interposed Uncle Billy. \"She's seem' som'pin.\"  \"Sister Anne! Sister Anne. And what do; you see?\"  \"Dust! Dust! I see a horseman in a cloud of dust. Look! Look! He's coming this way.\" By this time Virgie's acting had taken on so close a resemblance to the real thing that both Mrs. Gary and Uncle Billy rose to their feet in wonder.  \"He's jumped the _fence_,\" cried Virgie. \"He's cutting across our fields! He sees me! He's waving his hat to me!\" With the last words the child suddenly jumped down from the bench and ran through the opening in the hedge, leaving her mother gazing after her in sudden consternation.  \"Name we Gawd! Miss Hallie,\" gasped Uncle Billy. \"You reckon she done brought somebody, sho' 'nuff? Hi! Hi! _I_ hear sum'-pin. It's a horse. Lan' er Glory! Hits, _him_!\"     CHAPTER II   Round the corner of the hedge at a swift trot came a man in the uniform of an officer in the Confederate Army,--and Virgie was in his arms.  Mrs. Cary gave him one look and threw out her arms.  \"Herbert!\"  The man on horseback let Virgie slide down and then dismounted like a flash, coming to her across the little space of lawn with his whole soul in his eyes. With his dear wife caught in his arms he could do nothing but kiss her and hold her as if he would never again let her go.  \"Hallie,\" he breathed, \"but it's good to see you again. It's _good_.\" And so they stood for a long moment, husband and wife united after months of separation, after dangers and terrors and privations which had seemed as if they never would end.  Sally Ann was one of the first to interrupt, edging up at the earliest opportunity with her beard in her hand. \"How you does, Mars' Cary? How you fine yo'sef, seh?\"  \"Why, hullo, Sally Ann!\" said Cary, and put out his hand. \"What on earth is this thing?\"  Virgie ran to his side and caught his hand in hers. \"We were playing 'Blue Beard,' Daddy,--an' you came just like the brother.\"  \"So you've been Blue Beard, have you, Sally Ann?--then I must have the pleasure of cutting you into ribbons.\" Herbert Cary's shining saber flashed half out of its scabbard and then, laughing, he slapped it back with a clank.  \"Sally Ann,\" he announced, \"I'm going to turn you into Sister Anne for a while. You run up to Miss Hallie's room and sit by the window where you can watch the road and woods. If you see anything--soldiers, I mean--\"  \"Oh, Herbert!\" cried his wife in anguish.  \"S-s-sh!\" he whispered. \"Go along, Sally Ann. If you see anyone at all report to me at once. Understand? Off with you!\"  Uncle Billy now came forward in an effort to make his master's clothes more presentable.  \"Heh, Mars' Cary, lemme brush you off, seh. You's fyar kivered.\"  \"Look out, you old rascal,\" Cary laughed, as his wife backed away coughing before the cloud of fine white dust that rose under Uncle Billy's vigorous hands. \"You're choking your mistress to death. Never mind the dust. I'll get it back in ten minutes.\"  Mrs. Cary clasped her hands together at her breast with a look of entreaty.  \"Herbert! Must you go so soon?\"  Her husband looked back at her with eyes dark with regret.  \"Yes,\" he said briefly. \"I'm on my way to Richmond. How many horses are there in the stable?\"  \"Two--only two,\" was the broken response, as his wife sank down disconsolate on a bench. \"Belle and Lightfoot--we sold the others--I _had_ to do it.\"  \"Yes, I know, little woman. It couldn't be helped. Here, Billy! Take my horse and get Belle out of the stable. Lead them down to the swamp and hide them in the cedars. Then saddle Lightfoot--bring him here and give him some water and a measure of corn. Look sharp, Billy! Lively!\"  In the face of danger to his master Uncle Billy's response was instant. \"Yes, seh. Right away, seh,\" and he took Cary's lathered animal and made off for the stables at top speed.  Mrs. Cary looked up at her husband with a great fear written on her face.  \"Why, Herbert dear. You--you don't mean to say that the Yankees are in the neighborhood?\"  Immediately Cary was on the bench beside her with his arm around her, while Virgie climbed up on the other side.  \"Now, come,\" he murmured, \"be a brave little woman and don't be alarmed. It may be nothing after all. Only--there are several foraging parties--small ones, a few miles down the river. I've been dodging them all morning. If they come at all they won't trouble either you or Virgie.\"  \"But _I'm_ not afraid of them, Daddy-man,\" cried the small daughter, and she doubled up her fist ferociously. \"Look at _that_.\"  \"Aha! There's a brave little Rebel,\" her father cried as he swept her up in a hearty hug. \"_You're_ not afraid of them,--nor you either, God bless you,\" and his lips rested for a moment on his wife's soft cheek. \"Only, you are apt to be a little too haughty. If they search the house for arms or stragglers, make no resistance. It's best.\"  \"Yes, yes, I know,\" his wife cried out, \"but you, dear, _you_! Why are you here? Why aren't you with your company?\"  Cary looked away for a moment across the fields and down the slope towards the shimmering river. They were very beautiful--he wondered why he had not fully realized all that wife and child and home meant to him when he volunteered recently for a certain hazardous duty. He knew, too, how quickly his dear wife would know the full extent of the peril with which he felt himself surrounded. And so his reply was short and seemingly gruff, as many another man's has been under too heavy circumstances.  \"Scouting duty. I've been on it for the past two months.\"  Mrs. Cary's hand went to her heart.  \"A _scout_, Herbert! But, darling, why? It's so dangerous--so horrible--so--\"  He put up his hand, with a forced smile, to check her, and broke in gayly.  \"Ah, but think of the fun in it. It's like playing hide-and-go-seek with Virgie.\"  But his wife was not to be put off so lightly and she put her impelling hands on his arm.  Gary changed his tone. His voice deepened.  \"They need me, dear,\" he said earnestly. \"What does danger to one man mean when Dixie calls us all? And I'm doing work--good work. I've already given one battle to General Lee and now I have information that will give him another and a bigger one. Two nights ago I came through the Union lines. I ...\"  Mrs. Cary rose unsteadily to her feet.  \"Through the Yankee lines! Oh, Herbert. _Not as a spy!_\"  \"A spy? Of course not. I hid in the woods all day, then climbed a tall pine tree and got the lay of their camp--the number of their guns--the disposition of forces and their lines of attack. Yesterday I had the wires at Drury's Bluff and started trouble. I'm on my way now to join my command, but I had a good excuse for coming home to hold you in in my arms again, if only for a moment. You see, poor old Roger got a wound in his flank--from a stray bullet.\"  \"A _stray_ bullet,\" asked Mrs. Gary, doubtfully.  \"Yes,\" he smiled, for he had escaped it, \"a stray bullet meant for _me_.\"  \"But, Daddy,\" Virgie interrupted, \"while you were up in the tree--\"  A wild whoop broke off Virgie's question. Sally Ann was rushing down the steps, her eyes rolling up with excitement.  \"Mars' Cary! Mars' Cary! Somebody comin' long de road!\"  \"Who? How many?\" Cary demanded, springing up and running towards the gate that opened on the wagon road over the hills.  \"Des' one,\" responded Sally Ann with na√Øve truthfulness. \"Ol' Dr. Simmons. He drivin' by de gate in de buggy.\"  Mrs. Cary threw up her hands with a muffled cry of relief and laughter. \"Oh, Sally! Sally!\" she exclaimed, \"you'll be the death of me.\"  \"But Lor! Miss Hallie,\" said Sally plaintively, \"he _tole_ me fer to tell him.\"  Cary, returning, waved Sally Ann back to her post. \"That's right,\" he laughed. \"You're a good sentry, Sally Ann. Go back and watch again. _Scoot_!\"  \"Herbert,\" and his wife stood before him. \"Come into the house and let me give you something to eat.\"  For answer Cary gently imprisoned her face in his hands. \"Honey, I can't,\" he said, his eyes grown sad again. \"Just fix me up something--anything you can find. I'll munch it in the saddle.\"  For a moment their lips clung and then she stepped back with a broken sigh. \"I'll do the best I can, but oh! how I wish it all were over and that we had you home again.\"  A spasm crossed the man's face. \"It soon _will_ be over, sweetheart. It soon _will_ be.\"  His wife flung him a startled look. \"You mean--Oh, Herbert! Isn't there a single hope--even the tiniest ray?\"  Cary took her hands in his, looked into her eyes and his answer breathed the still unconquered spirit of the South. \"There is always hope--as long as we have a man.\" Mrs. Cary went into the house, slowly, wearily, and Cary turned to Virgie.  \"Well, little lady,\" her father said, resting his hand on Virgie's shining head. \"Have you been taking good care of mother--and seeing that Uncle Billy does his plowing right?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came the prompt response. \"Susan Jemima an' me have been lookin' after everything--but we had to eat up General Butler!\"  \"General Butler,\" cried her father, astounded.  \"Yes, Daddy--our lastest calf. We named him that 'cause one day when I was feedin' him with milk he nearly swallowed my silver spoon.\"  \"Ha-ha,\" laughed the amused soldier, and swept her up in his arms. \"If we could only get rid of all their generals as easy as that we'd promise not to eat again for a week. Everything"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15414"],["title","The Littlest Rebel (#4)"],["body"," all right?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Virgie, dolefully. \"All the niggers has runned away--all 'cept Uncle Billy and Sally Ann. Jeems Henry runned away this morning.\"  \"The deuce he did! The young scamp!\"  \"He's gone to join the Yankees,\" Virgie continued.  \"What's that?\" and Cary sprang up to pace to and fro. \"I wonder which way he went?\"  \"I don' know,\" whimpered Virgie forlornly. \"I only wish I was a soldier with a big, sharp sword like yours--'cause when the blue boys came I'd _stick_ 'em in the stomach.\"  Mrs. Cary was coming down the steps now with a small package of food and in the roadway Uncle Billy stood feeding and watering his master's horse. In this bitterest of moments, when his own family had to be the ones to hurry him along his way, there had come another and greater danger--peril to those he loved.  \"Tell me, dear,\" he said with his hand warm on his wife's soft shoulder. \"Is it true that Jeems Henry ran away this morning?\"  \"Yes,\" she nodded. \"I knew the poor boy meant to leave us sooner or later, so I made no effort to detain him.\"  \"You did right,\" was the answer. \"But which way did he go?\"  \"Up the river. To a Union camp on the Chickahominy.\"  \"Chickahominy!\" exclaimed Cary sharply, and bit his lips. \"So that's the lay of the land, eh! I'm mighty glad you told me this. But still--\" Cary's voice faded away under the weight of a sudden despair. What was the use of fighting forever against such fearful odds? What could they ever gain--save a little more honor--and at what dreadful cost?  \"What makes you look so worried, Herbert?\" his wife murmured, her nerves on edge again.  \"Yes, it's true,\" the man said with a groan. \"They're gradually closing in on us--surrounding Richmond.\"  \"_Surrounding us?_\" Mrs. Cary whispered, hardly believing her ears.  \"Yes, it's true--all too true,\" the man burst out bitterly. \"We can fight against thousands--and against tens of thousands but, darling, we can't fight half the world.\"  He sank down on the bench, one elbow on his crossed knee, the other arm hanging listlessly by his side. His face grew lined and haggard. All the spirit, the indomitable courage of a moment ago had fled before the revelation that, try as they might, they could never conquer in this terribly unequal fight. Then he threw out his hand and began to speak, half to her and half to the unseen armies of his fellows.  \"Our armies are exhausted. Dwindling day by day. We are drawing from the cradle and the grave. Old men--who can scarcely bear the weight of a musket on their shoulders: and boys--mere children--who are sacrificed under the blood-stained wheels. The best! The flower of our land! We are dumping them all into a big, red hopper. Feed! Feed! Always more feed for this greedy machine of war!\"  Silently wife and daughter came to the man in his despair, as if to ward off some dark shape which hovered over him with brushing wings. Their arms went around him together.  \"There, there, dear,\" he heard a soft voice whisper, \"don't grow despondent. _Think!_ Even though you've fought a losing fight it has been a glorious one--and God will not forget the Stars and Bars! Remember,--you still have us--who love you to the end--and fight your battles--on our knees.\"  Slowly the man looked up.  \"Forgive me, honey,\" he murmured remorsefully. \"You are right--and bravest, after all. It is you--you women, who save us in the darkest hours. You--our wives--our mothers--who wage a silent battle in the lonely, broken homes. You give us love and pity--tenderness and tears--a flag of pride that turns defeat to victory. The women of the South,\" he cried, and Herbert Cary doffed his hat before his wife, \"the crutch on which the staggering hope of Dixie leans!\"  There came, then, the sound of hurrying footsteps. Once more Sally Ann rushed from the house but this time genuine danger was written plainly in her face.  \"Mars' Cary! Mars' Cary! Dey's comin' dis time--sho' 'nuff!\"  \"How many?\" Cary cried, springing for the roadway and his horse.  \"Dey's comin' thu' de woods--an' Lawd Gawd, de yearth is fyar blue wid' 'em.\"  \"Billy!\" commanded Cary. \"Take Lightfoot as fast as you can down to the edge of the woods. Don't worry, Hallie, they'll never catch me once I'm in the saddle.\"  He stooped and kissed her, then caught up Virgie for a last hug, burying his worn face in her curls. \"Good-by, little one. Take good care of Mother. Good-by!\"  With one last grasp his wife caught his hand. \"Herbert! which way do you go?\"  \"Across the river--to the Chesterfield side.\"  \"But the Yankees came that way, too!\"  \"I'll circle around them. If they've left a guard at the crossing I'll swim the river higher up.\" He slapped his holster with his open hand. \"Listen for three shots. If they come in quick succession--then I've crossed--I'm safe. If I only had a few men I'd stay, but alone, I can't--you know I can't. Good-by! God bless you.\" And in another moment he was in the saddle--had waved his hand--was gone.  Straining their eyes after him, as if they would somehow pierce the dark woods which hid his flight, mother and daughter stood as if turned to stone. Only Virgie, after a moment, waved her hand and sent her soft, childish prayer winging after him to save him from all harm. \"Good-by, Daddy-man, good-by!\"  Sally Ann, however, having seen the approaching danger with her own eyes, began to wring her hands and cry hysterically. \"Aw, Miss Hallie, I so skeered! I so skeered!\"  \"Sally,\" cried Mrs. Cary, as the sound of hoofbeats thudding through the woods came unmistakably to her ears, \"take Virgie with you instantly and run down through the grove to the old ice house. Hide there under the pine tags. Understand?\"  But the negro girl, ashen with terror, seemed incapable of flight.  \"I skeered to go, Miss Hallie,\" she whimpered. \"I wan' stay here wid you! Ou-ou!\"  \"But you can't, I tell you,\" her mistress answered, as the certainty of the girl's helplessness before a questioner flashed through her mind. \"You'd tell everything.\"  \"Oh, come on, you big baby,\" Virgie urged, pulling at Sally Arm's sleeve. \"_I'll_ take care of you.\" Then her eye fell on Susan Jemima lying neglected on the bench and she gave a faint scream at her heartlessness. \"Goodness gracious, Mother,\" she cried, as, still holding on to Sally Ann, she ran and caught up her beloved doll. \"I nearly forgot my child!\"  With the clank of sabers and the sound of gruff commands already in her ears, Mrs. Cary turned peremptorily to Uncle Billy.  \"Remember, William! If the Yankees ask for my husband _you haven't seen him!_\"  \"Nor'm, dat's right,\" was the prompt answer. \"I dunno you eben got one. But you go in de house, Miss Hallie. Dat's de bes' way,--yas'm.\"  \"Perhaps it _is_ best,\" his mistress answered. \"The longer we can detain them the better for Captain Cary. You'd better come in yourself.\"  \"Yas'm,\" replied the faithful old man, although such action was farthest from his thoughts. \"In des' a minnit. I'll be dar in des' a minnit.\"  But once his mistress had closed the door behind her Uncle Billy's plan of operations changed. Hurrying down the steps he plunged his arm under the porch and drew forth--a rusty ax. With his weapon over his shoulder he hastened up on the veranda and stood with his back against the door.     CHAPTER III   The thudding feet came nearer. A bugle call--a rattling of accouterments and then, from the other side of the hedge, came a half dozen troopers in blue, led by a Sergeant with a red face and bloodshot eyes.  \"This way, boys!\" the Sergeant shouted, and at the sound of a harsh, never-forgotten voice Uncle Billy's grasp on his ax grew tighter. \"_I_ know the place--I've been here before. _We'll_ get the liquor and silver while the Colonel is stealing the horses, eh?\" Then his eyes fell on Uncle Billy and he greeted him with a yell of recognition. \"Hello, you black old ape! Come down and show us where you buried the silver and the whisky. Oh, you won't? Then I'll come up and get you,\" and he lurched forward.  \"Look here, white man,\" Uncle Billy shouted, lifting the rusty ax high in the air, \"you stay whar you is. Ef you come up dem steps I'll split yo' ugly haid! I know you, Jim Dudley,\" he cried. \"Mars' Cary done give you _one_ horse whippin', an' ef you hang aroun' here you'll get anudder one!\"  Furious at the recollection of his shame of a few years back when he had been overseer on this same plantation, the Sergeant rushed up the steps and knocked the ax aside with his gun barrel. \"Yes, he did whip me, burn him, and now I'll do the same for you.\" Seizing Uncle Billy by the throat he pushed him against the house.  Instantly the door swung open. Mrs. Cary, her head held high, her beautiful dark eyes blazing with wrath, stood on the threshold.  \"Stop it!\" she commanded in tones that brooked no disobedience even from a drunkard. \"Let my servant go--instantly!\"  Astounded at this sudden apparition the man shrank back for a moment, but almost as quickly regained his bluster.  \"Ah-hah, the beautiful Mrs. Cary, eh! I'm glad to see you looking so well--and handsome.\"  The words might as well have been spoken to the wind for all the notice that the woman paid them. With only a gesture of mingled contempt and loathing she stepped to the railing and called to the grinning troopers below. \"Who is in command here?\"  To her horror only Dudley answered.  \"_I_ am,\" he said, triumphantly. He thrust a menacing face close to hers and ordered her curtly. \"And I'd just as soon have _you_ get me a drink as the nigger. Come on, fine lady.\"  Intent on insulting this woman whose husband had once cut his back with a whip the man caught her by the arm and roughly tried to pull her to him. But before he could accomplish his purpose retribution fell on him with a heavy hand.  Through a gap in the hedge an officer at the head of a dozen troopers appeared. One look at the scene on the veranda and Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison, with a smothered cry, dashed up the steps.  \"You beastly coward,\" "]]]
