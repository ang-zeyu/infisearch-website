So he said nothing, but ate a very good dinner.  But Neville's mother put the flower in a vase upon the mantel; and to this day it is still there, as fresh and bright as ever. It will not fade. Neville's mother thinks that is a very strange and wonderful thing. And so it is.  Since that day, when Neville goes to the top of the bald hill to watch a sunset, he is almost sure that, just as the golden light is fading, he can see a little yellow man by the gateway; and it seems to him that the little yellow man waves a cheery greeting. But, whether this is so or not, Neville always waves back; and he feels very happy to think that he has a good friend inside the sunset.    THE TRAM-MAN  I'd like to be a Tram-man, and ride about all day, Calling out, \"Fares, please!\" in quite a 'ficious way, With pockets full of pennies which I'd make the people pay. But in the hottest days I'd take my tram down to the Bay; And when I saw the nice cool sea I'd shout \"Hip, hip, hooray!\" But I wouldn't be a Tram-man if. . . .                I couldn't stop and play.                                    Would you?    THE AXE-MAN  High on the hills, where the tall trees grow, There lives an axeman that I know. From his little hut by a ferny creek, Day after day, week after week, He goes each morn with his shining axe, Trudging along by the forest tracks; And he chops and he chops     till the daylight goes-- High on the hills, where the blue-gum grows.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!) There's a log to move and a branch to lop. Now to the felling!  His sharp axe bites Into a tree on the forest heights, And scarce for a breath does the axeman stop-- (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!) Bell-birds watch him; and in the fern Wallabies listen awhile, and turn Back through the bracken, and off they hop. (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!) Patient and tireless, blow on blow The axeman swings as the minutes go; While the echoes ring from the mountain-top. (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  Round about him the rabbits play, Skipping and scampering all the day, And the sweet young grass by the logs they crop. (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  Crimson parrots above him climb, Chattering, chattering all the time, As down from the branches the twigs they drop. (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip!          Chop!) Steadily, surely, on he goes, Shaking the tree with his mighty blows: There's never a pause and there's never a stop. (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  Out from the bush beyond is heard The swaggering song of the butcher-bird Seeking a joint for his butcher's shop. (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!) Deeper and deeper the cut creeps in, While the parrots shriek with a deafening din, And the chips fly out with a flip and a flop. (Chip!     Chop!       Chip!      Chop!) Yellow robins come  flocking round, Watching the chips  as they fall to ground, Darting to catch the grubs that drop. (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip!    . . Chop!)  The blows come quicker. The   axe-biade hums, Stand well back, there, before she comes! Hark! How the splinters crack and pop-- (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!) Listen!  Listen!  She's creaking now! Look, high up, at that trembling bough! Another second, and down she'll smash, Shaking the earth with a mighty crash; Look at her! Look at her! (Chip!      Chop! Chip! . . . . . . . .Chip!)                Wee--E--E--E--E--E---                                                 FLOP!    THE DROVERS  Out across the spinifex, out across the sand, Out across the saltbush to Never Never land    That's the way the drovers go, jogging down the track--    That's the way the drovers go. But how do they come back? Back across the saltbush from Never Never land. Back across the spinifex, back across the sand.    THE LONG ROAD HOME  When I go back from Billy's place I always have to roam The mazy road, the crazy road that leads the long way home. Ma always says, \"Why don't you come through Mr Donkin's land? The footbridge track will bring you back.\" Ma doesn't understand. I cannot go that way, you know, because of Donkin's dog; So I set forth and travel north, and cross the fallen log.  Last week, when I was coming by, that log had lizards in it; And you can't say I stop to play if I just search a minute. I look around upon the ground and, if there are no lizards, I go right on and reach the turn in front of Mrs Blizzard's. I do not seek to cross the creek, because it's deep and floody, And Ma would be annoyed with me if I came home all muddy.  Perhaps I throw a stone or so at Mrs Blizzard's tank, Because it's great when I aim straight to hear the stone go \"Plank!\" Then west I wend from Blizzard's Bend, and not a moment wait, Except, perhaps, at Mr Knapp's, to swing upon his gate. So up the hill I go, until I reach the little paddock That Mr Jones at present owns and rents to Mr Craddock.  For boys my size the sudden rise is quite a heavy pull, And yet I fear a short-cut here because of Craddock's bull; So I just tease the bull till he's as mad as he can get, And then I face the corner place that's been so long to let. It's very well for Ma to tell about my dawdling habits. What would you do, suppose you knew the place was thick with rabbits?  I do not stay for half a day, as Ma declares I do. No, not for more than half-an-hour--perhaps an hour--or two. Then down the drop I run, slip-slop, where all the road is slithy. And have to go quite close, you know, to Mr Horner's smithy. A moment I might tarry by the fence to watch them hammer, And, I must say, learn more that way than doing sums and grammar.  And, if I do sometimes climb through, I do not mean to linger. Though I did stay awhile the day Bill Homer burst his finger. I just stand there to see the pair bang some hot iron thing And watch Bill Horner swing the sledge and hit the anvil--Bing! (For Mr Horner and his son are great big brawny fellows: Both splendid chaps!) And then, perhaps, they let me blow the bellows.  A while I stop beside the shop, and talk to Mr Horner; Then off I run, and race like fun around by Duggan's Corner. It's getting late, and I don't wait beside the creek a minute, Except to stop, maybe, and drop a few old pebbles in it. A few yards more, and here's the store that's kept by Mr Whittle-- And you can't say I waste the day if I 'ust wait . . .  a little.  One day, you know, a year ago, a man gave me a penny, And Mr Whittle sold me sweets (but not so very many). You never know your luck, and so I look to see what's new In Mr Whittle's window.  There's a peppermint or two, Some buttons and tobacco (Mr Whittle calls it \"baccy\"), And fish in tins, and tape, and pins. . . . And then a voice calls, \"Jacky!\"  \"I'm coming, Ma.  I've been so far-around by Duggan's Corner. I had to stay awhile to say 'Good day' to Mr Horner. I feel so fagged; I've tramped and dragged through mud and over logs, Ma-- I could not go short-cuts, you know, because of bulls and dogs, Ma. The creek, Ma? Why, it's very high! You don't call that a gutter? Bill Horner chews tobacco, Ma . . . . I'd like some bread and butter.\"    THE BAND  Hey, there!  Listen awhile!  Listen awhile, and come. Down in the street there are marching feet, and I hear the beat of a drum. Bim!  Boom!!  Out of the room!  Pick up your hat and fly! Isn't it grand?  The band!  The band!  The band is marching by!  Oh, the clarinet is the finest yet, and the uniforms are gay.      Tah, rah!  We don't go home--      Oom, pah!  We won't go home-- Oh, we shan't go home, and we can't go home when the band begins to play.  Oh, see them swinging along, swinging along the street! Left, right! buttons so bright, jackets and caps so neat. Ho, the Fire Brigade, or a dress parade of the Soldier-men is grand; But everyone, for regular fun, wants a Big-Brass-Band.  The slide-trombone is a joy alone, and the drummer!  He's a treat!      So, Rackety-rumph!  We don't go home--      Boom, Bumph!  We won't go home-- Oh, we shan't go home, and we can't go home while the band is in the street.      Tooral-ooral, Oom-pah!                                  The band is in the street!    BESSIE AND THE BUNYIP     Bessie met a bunyip down along the track, In his hand a billy and a swag upon his back.       And you will hardly believe it, but when Bessie shouted,\"Shoo!\"       He turned a double somersault and went quite blue.    GOOD ENOUGH  I do not think there ever was,    Or ever will, or ever could be, A little girl or little boy    As good as she or as he should be.  But still, I think, you will agree,    Though perfect very, very few are, They're not so bad when \"pretty good\"--    That's just about as good as you are.    THE PORTER  I'd like to be a porter, and always on the run, Calling out, \"Stand aside!\" and asking leave of none. Shoving trucks on people's toes, and having splendid fun, Slamming all the carriage doors and locking every one-- And, when they asked to be let in, I'd say, \"It can't be done.\"    But I wouldn't be a porter if . . .        The luggage weighed a ton.          Would you?    GROWING UP  Little Tommy Tadpole began to weep and wail, For little Tommy Tadpole had lost his little tail;    And his mother didn't know him as he wept upon a log,    For he wasn't Tommy Tadpole, but Mr. Thomas Frog.    THE UNSOCIABLE WALLABY  Willie spied a wallaby hopping through the fern-- Here a jump, here a thump, there a sudden turn.    Willie called the wallaby, begging him to stop,    But he went among the wattles with a                            flip,                                    flap,                                             flop!    * * *  I wonder whether, all together, you and I and father Could eat a bun that weighs a ton. I'd like to try it, rather.  I want to know why roosters crow at dawning of the day. Is it because they cannot think of something else to say?  * * *    THE SONG"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16251"],["title","A Book for Kids (#7)"],["body","THE SULKY STOCKMAN  Come, let us sing with a right good ring    (Sing hey for lifting lay, sing hey!) Of any old, sunny old, silly old thing.    (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!) The sun shone brightly overhead, And the shearers stood by the shearing shed; But \"The run wants rain,\" the stockman said (Sing di-dum, wattle-gum, Narrabori Ned. For a lifting lay sing hey!)  The colts were clipped and the sheep were shorn    (Sing hey for a lilting lay, sing hey!) But the stockman stood there all forlorn.    (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!) The rails were up and the gate was tied, And the big black bull was safe inside; But \"The wind's gone West!\" the stockman sighed (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, rally for a ride.    For a lifting lay sing hey!)  The cook came out as the clock struck one    (Sing hey for a lilting lay, sing hey!) And the boundary rider got his gun.    (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!) He fired it once at an old black crow; But the shot went wide, for he aimed too low; And the stockman said, \"Fat stock is low.\" (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, Jerridiiii Joe.    For a lifting lay sing hey!)  They spread their swags in the gum-tree's shade    (Sing hey for a lilting lay, sing hey!) For the work was done and the cheques were paid.    (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!) The overseer rode in at three, But his horse pulled back and would not gee, And the stockman said, \"We're up a tree!\" (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, Johnny-cake for tea.    For a lilting lay sing hey!)  The sun sank down and the stars shone out    (Sing hey for a lifting lay, sing hey!) And the old book-keeper moped about.    (Sing ho for the ballad of a backblock day!) The dingo wailed to the mopoke's call, The crazy colt stamped in his stall; But the stockman groaned, \"it's bunk for all.\" (Sing, di-dum, wattle-gum, wattle-gum, wattle-gum,    Hey for a backblock day!         Sing hey!    Sing hey for a lifting lay!)    OUR COW  Down by the sliprails stands our cow    Chewing, chewing, chewing, She does not care what folks out there    In the great, big world are doing. She sees the small cloud-shadows pass    And green grass shining under. If she does think, what does she think    About it all, I wonder?  She sees the swallows skimming by    Above the sweet young clover, The light reeds swaying in the wind    And tall trees bending over. Far down the track she hears the crack    of bullock-whips, and raving Of angry men where, in the sun,    Her fellow-beasts are slaving.  Girls, we are told, can scratch and scold,    And boys will fight and wrangle, And big, grown men, just now and then,    Fret o'er some fingle-fangle, Vexing the earth with grief or mirth,    Longing, rejoicing, rueing-- But by the sliprails stands our cow,    Chewing.    THE TEACHER  I'd like to be a teacher, and have a clever brain, Calling out, \"Attention, please!\" and \"Must I speak in vain?\" I'd be quite strict with boys and girls whose minds I had to train, And all the books and maps and things I'd carefully explain; I'd make then learn the dates of kings, and all the capes of Spain;    But I wouldn't be a teacher if . . .        I couldn't use the cane.          Would you?    THE SPOTTED HEIFERS  Mr Jeremiah Jeffers Owned a pair of spotted heifers These he sold for two pounds ten To Mr Robert Raymond Wren  Who reared them in the lucerne paddocks Owned by Mr Martin Maddox, And sold them, when they grew to cows, To Mr Donald David Dowse.  A grazier, Mr Egbert Innes, Bought them then for twenty guineas, Milked the cows, and sold the milk To Mr Stephen Evan Silk.  Who rents a butter factory From Mr Laurence Lampard-Lee. Here, once a week, come for his butter The grocer, Mr Roland Rutter,  Who keeps a shop in Sunny Street Next door to Mr Peter Peat. He every afternoon at two Sent his fair daughter, Lucy Loo,  To Mr Rutter's shop to buy Such things as were not priced too high, Especially a shilling tin Of \"Fuller's Food for Folk Too Thin.\"  This food was bought for Lucy Loo-- A girl of charming manners, who Was much too pale and much too slight To be a very pleasant sight.  When Lucy Loo beheld the butter Stocked by Mr Roland Rutter, She said, \"I'll have a pound of that.\" She had it, and thenceforth grew fat.  We now go back to Mr Jeffers, Who sold the pair of spotted heifers. He had a son, James Edgar John, A handsome lad to gaze upon,  Who had now reached that time of life When young men feel they need a wife; But no young girl about the place Exactly had the kind of face  That seemed to suit James Edgar John-- A saddening thing to think upon, For he grew sad and sick of life Because he could not find a wife.  One day young James was passing by (A look of sorrow in his eye) The shop of Mr Roland Rutter, When Lucy Loo came out with butter.  At once James Edgar John said, \"That Is just the girl for me!  She's fat.\" He offered her his heart and hand And prospects of his father's land.  The Reverend Saul Sylvester Slight Performed the simple marriage rite. The happy couple went their way, And lived and loved unto this day.  Events cannot be far foreseen; And all ths joy might not have been If Mr Jeremiah Jeffers Had kept his pair of spotted heifers.    TEA TALK  'Excuse me if I sit on you,' the cup said to the saucer.    'I fear I've been here all the afternoon.' 'Spare excuses,' said the saucer; 'you have sat on me before, sir.'    'Oh, I'll stir him up directly,' said the spoon. 'Stop your clatter!  Stop your clatter!' cried the bread-and-butter platter    'Tittle-tattle!' sneered the tea-pot, with a shrug; 'Now, the most important question is my chronic indigestion.'    'Ah, you've taken too much tannin,' jeered the jug. 'Hey, hey, hey!' sang the silver-plated tray, 'It's time you had your faces washed.  I've come to clear away!'    THE LOOKING-GLASS  When I look into the looking glass    I'm always sure to see-- No matter how I dodge about--    Me, looking out at me.  I often wonder as I look,    And those strange features spy, If I, in there, think I'm as plain    As I, out here, think I.    WOOLLOOMOOLOO  Here's a ridiculous riddle for you:    How many o's are there in Woolloomooloo? Two for the W, two for the m,   Four for the l's, and that's plenty for them.    * * *  I wonder what the Jacks have got to laugh and laugh about I'm sure the worms don't see the joke when Jacky digs them out.  I wonder which is best: a rich plum-pudding stuffed with plums, Or lemon ice, or plain boiled rice, or long-division sums.  * * *    THE BARBER  I'd like to be a barber, and learn to shave and clip, Calling out, \"Next please!\" and pocketing my tip. All day I'd hear my scissors going, \"Snip, Snip, Snip;\" I'd lather people's faces, and their noses I would grip While I shaved most carefully along the upper lip.    But I wouldn't be a barber if . . .        The razor was to slip.          Would you?    FARMER JACK  Old farmer Jack gazed on his wheat,    And feared the frost would nip it. Said he, \"it's nearly seven feet--    I must begin to strip it.\"  He stripped it with a stripper and    He bagged it with a bagger; The bags were all so lumpy that    They made the lumper stagger.  The lumper staggered up the stack    Where he was told to stack it; And Jack was paid and put the cash    Inside his linen jacket.    OLD BLACK JACKO  Old Black Jacko    Smokes tobacco    In his little pipe of clay. Puff, puff, puff, He never has enough    Though he smokes it all day.  But his lubra says, \"Mine tink dat Jacky Him shmoke plenty too much baccy.\"    BIRD SONG  I detest the Carrion Crow! (He's a raven, don't you know?)    He's a greedy glutton, also, and a ghoul, And his sanctimonious caw Rubs my temper on the raw.    He's a demon, and a most degraded fowl.  I admire the pert Blue-wren And his dainty little hen--    Though she hasn't got a trace of blue upon her; But she's pleasing, and she's pretty,    And she sings a cheerful ditty; While her husband is a gentleman of honour.  I despise the Pallid Cuckoo, A disreputable \"crook\" who    Shirks her duties for a lazy life of ease. I abhor her mournful call, Which is not a song at all    But a cross between a whimper and a wheeze.    THE SAILOR  I'd like to be a sailor--a sailor bold and bluff-- Calling out, \"Ship ahoy!\" in manly tones and gruff. I'd learn to box the compass, and to reef and tack and luff; I'd sniff and snifff the briny breeze and never get enough. Perhaps I'd chew tobacco, or an old black pipe I'd puff,    But I wouldn't be a sailor if . . .        The sea was very rough.          Would you?    THE FAMINE  Cackle and lay, cackle and lay! How many eggs did you get to-day? None in the manger, and none in the shed, None in the box where the chickens are fed, None in the tussocks and none in the tub, And only a little one out in the scrub. Oh, I say!  Dumplings to-day. I fear that the hens must be laying away.    THE FEAST  Cackle and lay, cackle and lay! How many eggs did you get to-day? Two in the manger, and four in the shed, Six in the box where the chickens are fed, Two in the tussocks and ten in the tub, And nearly two dozen right out in the scrub. Hip, hooray!  Pudding to-day! I think that the hens are beginning to lay.    UPON THE ROAD TO ROCKABOUT  Upon the road to Rockabout I came upon some sheep-- A large and woolly flock about As wide as it was deep.  I was about to turn about To ask the man to tell Some things I wished to learn about Both sheep and wool as well,  When I beheld a rouseabout Who lay upon his back Beside a little house about A furlong from the track.  I had a lot to talk about, And said to him \"Good day.\" But he got up to walk about, And so I went away--    A CHANGE OF AIR  Now, a man in Oodnadatta He grew fat, and he grew fatter,    Though he hardly had a thing to eat for dinner; While a man in Booboorowie Often sat and wondered how he    Could prevent himself from growing any thinner.  So the man from Oodnadatta    He came down to Booboorowie, Where he rapidly grew"]]]
