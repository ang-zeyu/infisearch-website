On second thoughts, you had better go back and take up the job of platoon sergeant. Come on, Glengarry, and try and trumpet an order.\"  Glengarry, so-called from his bonnet, a sturdy youth with sloping shoulders, took up his post nervously.  \"A close column forming column of fours,\" he cried in a shrill treble, quoting the cautionary part of his command. \"Advance in fours from the right; form fours--right!\"  \"Form fours--where?\" roared the adjutant.  \"Left,\" came the answer.  \"Left, your grandmother! You were right at first. Did you not know that you were right?... Where's Eyeglass, the platoon sergeant, now? Who's pinched him?\"  This unfortunate officer had dropped his eyeglass, and was now groping for it on the muddy ground, one of my mates helping him in the search.  Other officers took up the job of company commander in turn, and all suffered. One, who was a dapper little fellow, speedily earned the nickname of \"Tailor's Dummy;\" another, when giving a platoon the wrong direction in dressing, was told to be careful, and not shove the regiment over. A third, a Welshman, with the black ribbons, got angry with a section for some slight mistake made by two of its number, and was told to be careful and not annoy the men. He had only got them on appro'.  Spick and span in their new uniforms, they came to drill daily on our parade ground. Slowly the change took place. They were \"rookies\" no longer, and the adjutant's sarcasm was a thing of the past. Commands were pronounced distinctly and firmly; the officers were trained men, ready to lead a company of soldiers anywhere and to do anything.  No man who has trained with the new armies can be lacking in respect for the indefatigable N.C.O., upon whom the brunt of the work has fallen. With picturesque scorn and sarcasm he has formed huge armies out of the rawest of raw material, and all in a space of less than half a year. His methods are sometimes strange and his temper short; yet he achieves his end in the shortest time possible. He is for ever correcting the same mistakes and rebuking the same stupidity, and the wonder is, not that he loses his temper, but that he should ever be able to preserve it. He understands men, and approaches them in an idiom that is likely to produce the best results.  \"Every man of you has friends of some sort,\" said the musketry instructor, as we formed up in front of him on the parade ground, gripping with nervous eagerness the rifles which had just been served out from the quartermaster's stores. We were recruits, raw \"rookies,\" green to the grind, and chafing under discipline. \"And some sort of friends it would be as well as if you never met them,\" the instructor continued. \"They'd play you false the minute they'd get your back turned. But you've a friend now that will always stand by you and play you fair. Just give him a chance, and he'll maybe see you out of many a tight corner. Now, who is this friend I'm talking about?\" he asked, turning to a youth who was leaning on his rifle. \"Come, Weary, and tell me.\"  \"The rifle,\" was the answer.  \"The crutch?\"  \"No, the rifle.\"  \"I see that, boy, I see that! But, damn it, don't make a crutch of it. You're a soldier now, my man, and not a crippled one yet.\"  Thus was the rifle introduced to us. We had long waited for its coming, and dreamt of cross-guns, the insignia of a crack shot's proficiency, while we waited. And with the rifle came romance, and the element of responsibility. We were henceforward fighting men, numbered units, it was true, with numbered weapons, but for all that, fighters--men trained to the trade and licensed to the profession.  Our new friend was rather a troublesome individual to begin with. In rising to the slope he had the trick of breaking free and falling on the muddy barrack square. A muddy rifle gets rusty, and brings its owner into trouble, and a severe penalty is considered meet for the man who comes on parade with a rusty rifle. Bringing the friend from the slope to the order was a difficult process for us recruits at the start the back-sight tore at the fingers, and bleeding hands often testified to the unnatural instinct of the rebellious weapon. But the unkindest kick of all was given when the slack novice fired the first shot, and the heel of the butt slipped upwards and struck the jaw. Then was learnt the first real lesson. The rifle kicks with the heel and aims for the jaw. Control your friend, humour him; keep him well in hand and beware his fling.  I was unlucky in my first rifle practice on the miniature range, and out of my first five shots I did not hit the target once. The instructor lay by my side on the waterproof ground-sheet (the day was a wet one, and the range was muddy) and lectured me between misses on the peculiarities of my weapon and the cultivation of a steady eye.  \"Keep the beggar under control,\" he said. \"You've got to coax him, and not use force. Pull the trigger easily, as though you loved it, and hold the butt affectionate-like against the shoulder. It's an easy matter to shoot as you're shooting now. There's shooting and shooting, and you've got to shoot straight. If you don't you're no dashed good! Give me the rifle, you're not aiming at the bull, man, you're aiming at the locality where the bull is grazing.\"  He took my rifle, slid a cartridge into the breech, and coaxed the trigger lovingly towards him. Three times he fired, then we went together to look at the target. Not a bullet fired by him had struck it. The instructor glared down the barrel of the gun, made some nasty remarks about deflection, and went back to yell at an orderly corporal.  \"What the dickens did you take this here for?\" he cried. \"It's a blooming wash-out,[1] and was never any good. Old as an unpaid bill and worn bell-mouth it is, and nobody can fire with it.\"  [Footnote 1: \"Wash-out\" is a term used by the men when their firing is so wide of the mark that it fails to hit any spot on the card. The men apply it indiscriminately to anything in the nature of a failure.]  On a new rifle being obtained I passed the preliminary test, and a rather repentant instructor remarked that it might be possible to make a soldier of me some day.  Since then my fellow-soldiers and I have had almost unlimited rifle practice, on miniature and open ranges, at bull and disappearing targets, in field firing at distances from 100 to 600 yards. On a field exceeding 600 yards it is almost impossible to hit a point the size of an ordinary bull; fire then must be directed towards a position. Field or volley firing is very interesting. Once my company took train to Dunstable and advanced on an imaginary enemy that occupied the wastes of the Chiltern Hills. Practice commenced by firing at little squares of iron standing upright in a row about 200 yards off in front of our line. These represented heads and shoulders of men rising over the trenches to take aim at us as we advanced. In extended order we came to our position, 200 yards distant from the front trenches. At the sound of the officer's whistle, we sank to the ground, facing our front, fixed our sights, and loaded. A second whistle was blown; we fired \"three rounds rapid\" at the foe. The aiming was very accurate; little spurts of earth danced up and around the targets, and every iron disc fell. The \"searching ground,\" the locality struck by bullets, scarcely measured a dozen paces from front to rear, thus showing that there was very little erratic firing.  \"That's some shooting!\" my Jersey friend remarked. \"If the discs were Germans!\"  \"They might shoot back,\" someone said, \"and then we mightn't take as cool an aim.\"  We are trained to the rifle; it is always with us, on parade, on march, on bivouac, and recently, when going through a dental examination, we carried our weapons of war into the medical officer's room. As befits units of a rifle regiment, we have got accustomed to our gun, and now, as fully trained men, we have established the necessary unity between hand and eye, and can load and unload our weapon with butt-plate stiff to shoulder and eye steady on target while the operation is in progress. In fact, our rifle comes to hand as easy as a walking-stick. We shall be sorry to lose it when the war is over, and no doubt we shall feel lonely without it.     CHAPTER V  THE COFFEE-SHOP AND WANKIN   What the pump is to the villager, so the coffee-shop is to the soldier of the New Army. Here the men crowd nightly and live over again the incidents of the day. Our particular coffee-shop is situated in our corner of the town; our men patronise it; there are three assistants, plump, merry girls, and three of our men have fallen in love with them; in short, it is our very own restaurant, opened when we came here, and adapted to our needs; the waitresses wear our hat-badges, sing our songs, and make us welcome when we cross the door to take up our usual chairs and yarn over the cosy tables. The Jersey youth with the blue eyes, the Oxford man, who speaks of things that humble waitresses do not understand, the company drummer, the platoon sergeants, and the Cockney who vows that water is spoilt in making every cup of coffee he drinks, all come here, and all love the place.  I have come to like the place and do most of my writing there, catching snatches of conversation and reminiscence as they float across to me.  \"I wasn't meanin' to 'urt ole Ginger Nobby nohow, but the muck I throwed took 'im dead on the jor. 'Wot's yer gime?' 'e 'ollers at me. 'Wot's my gime?' I says back to 'im. 'Nuffin', if ye want ter know!' I says. 'I was just shyin' at squidges.'\"  Thus spoke the bright-eyed Cockney at the table next me, gazing regretfully at his empty coffee-cup and cutting away a fringe of rag-nails from his finger with a clasp-knife. The time was eight o'clock of the evening, and the youth was recounting an adventure which he had had in the morning when throwing mud at sparrows on the parade"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16078"],["title","The Amateur Army (#5)"],["body","und. A lump of clay had struck a red-haired non-commissioned officer on the jaw, and the officer became angry. The above was the Cockney version of the story. One of my friends, an army unit with the Oxford drawl, was voluble on another subject.  \"Russian writers have had a great effect on our literature,\" he said, deep in a favourite topic. \"They have stripped bare the soul of man with a realism that shrivels up our civilisation and proves--Two coffees, please.\"  A tall, well-set waitress, with several rings on her fingers, took the order as gravely as if she were performing some religious function; then she turned to the Cockney.  \"Cup of cawfee, birdie!\" he cried, leaning over the table and trying to grip her hand. \"Not like the last, mind; it was good water spoilt. I'll never come in 'ere again.\"  \"So you say!\" said the girl, moving out of his way and laughing loudly.  \"Strike me balmy if I do!\"  \"Where'll yer go then?\"  \"Round the corner, of course,\" was the answer. \"There's another bird there--and cawfee! It's some stuff too, not like 'ere.\"  \"All right; don't come in again if yer don't want ter.\"  The Cockney got his second cup of coffee and pronounced it inferior to the first; then looked at an evening paper which Oxford handed to him, and studied a photograph of a battleship on the front page.  \"Can't stand these 'ere papers,\" he said, after a moment, as he got to his feet and lit a cigarette. \"Nuffink but war in them always; I'm sick readin' about war! I saw your bit in one a couple of nights ago,\" he said, turning to me.  \"What did you think of it?\" I asked, anxious to hear his opinion on an article dealing with the life of his own regiment.  \"Nuffink much,\" he answered, honestly and frankly. \"Everything you say is about things we all know; who wants to 'ear about them? D'ye get paid for writin' that?\"  One of his mates, a youth named Bill, who came in at that moment, overheard the remark.  \"Paid! Of course 'e gets paid,\" said the newcomer. \"Bet you he gets 'arf a crown for every time 'e writes for the paper.\"  All sorts and conditions of soldiers drift into the place and discuss various matters over coffee and mince pies; they are men of all classes, who had been as far apart as the poles in civil life, and are now knit together in the common brotherhood of war. Caste and estate seem to have been forgotten; all are engaged in a common business, full of similar risks, and rewarded by a similar wage.  In one corner of the room a game of cards was in progress, some soldiers were reading, and a few writing letters. Now and again a song was heard, and a score of voices joined in the chorus. The scene was one of indescribable gaiety; the temperament of the assembly was like a hearty laugh, infectious and healthy. Now and then a discussion took place, and towards the close of the evening hot words were exchanged between Bill and his friend, the bright-eyed Cockney.  \"I'll give old Ginger Nobby what for one day!\" said the latter.  \"Will you? I don't think!\"  \"Bet yer a bob I will!\"  \"You'd lose it.\"  \"Would I?\"  \"Straight you would!\"  \"Strike me pink if I would!\"  \"You know nothin' of what you're sayin'.\"  \"Don't I?\"  \"Git!\"  \"Shut!\"  In the coffee-shop Wankin is invariably the centre of an interested group. As the company scapegrace and black sheep of the battalion he occupies in his mates' eyes a position of considerable importance. His repartees are famous, and none knows better than he how to score off an unpopular officer or N.C.O. He has the distinction also of having spent more days in the guard-room than any other man in the battalion.  On the occasion when identity discs were being served out to the men and a momentary stir pervaded the battalion, it was Wankin who first became involved in trouble.  He employed the disc string to fasten the water-bottle of the man on his left to the haversack of the man on his right, and the colour-sergeant, livid with rage, vowed to chasten him by confining him eternally to barracks. But the undaunted company scapegrace was not to be beaten. Fastening the identity disc on his left eye he fixed a stern look on the sergeant.  \"My deah fellah,\" he drawled out, imitating the voice of the company lieutenant who wears an eyeglass, \"your remarks are uncalled for, really. By Jove! one would think that a scrap of string was a gold bracelet or a diamond necklace. I could buy the disc and the string for a bloomin' 'apenny.\"  \"You'll pay dearly for it this time,\" said the colour with fine irony. \"Three days C.B.[2] your muckin' about'll cost you.\" And before Wankin could reply the sergeant was reporting the matter to the captain.  [Footnote 2: Confinement to Barracks.]  Wankin is eternally in trouble, although his agility in dodging pickets and his skill in making a week's C.B. a veritable holiday are the talk of the regiment. All the officers know him, and many of them who have been victims of his smart repartee fear him more than they care to acknowledge. The subaltern with the eyeglass is a bad route-marcher, and Wankin once remarked in an audible whisper that the officer had learned his company drill with a drove of haltered pack-horses, and the officer bears the name of \"Pack-horse\" ever since.  On another occasion the major suffered when a battalion kit inspection took place early one December morning. Wankin had sold his spare pair of boots, the pair that is always kept on top of the kit-bag; but when the major inspected Wankin's kit the boots were there, newly polished and freed from the most microscopic speck of dust. Someone tittered during the inspection, then another, and the major smelt a rat. He lifted Wankin's kit-bag in his hand and found Wankin's feet tucked under it--Wankin's feet in stockinged soles. The major was justly indignant. \"One step to the front, left turn,\" he roared. \"March in front of every rank in the battalion and see what you think of it!\"  With stockinged feet, cold, but still wearing an inscrutable smile of impudence, Wankin paraded in front of a thousand grinning faces and in due course got back to his kit and beside the sarcastic major.  \"What do you think of it?\" asked the latter.  \"I don't think much of it, sir,\" Wankin replied. \"It's the dirtiest regiment I ever inspected.\"  Wankin was sometimes unlucky; fortune refused to favour him when he took up the work of picket on the road between St. Albans and London. No unit of his regiment is supposed to go more than two miles beyond St. Albans without a written permit, and guards are placed at different points of the two-mile radius to intercept the regimental rakes whose feet are inclined to roving. Wankin learned that the London road was not to be guarded on a certain Sunday. The regiment was to parade for a long route-march, and all units were to be in attendance. Wankin pondered over things for a moment, girt on his belt and sword and took up his position on the London road within a hundred yards of a wayside public-house. At this tavern a traveller from St. Albans may obtain a drink on a Sabbath day.  Soldiers, like most mortals, are sometimes dry and like to drink; Wankin was often dry and Wankin had seldom much money to spend. The first soldier who came out from the town wanted to get to the tavern.  \"Can't pass here!\" the mock-picket told him.  \"But I'm dry and I've a cold that catches me awful in the throat.\"  \"Them colds are dangerous,\" Wankin remarked in a contemplative voice, tinged with compassion. \"Used to have them bad myself an' I feel one coming on. I think gin, same as they have in the trenches, is the stuff to put a cold away. But I'm on the rocks.\"  \"If you'll let me through I'll stand on my hands.\"  \"It's risky,\" said Wankin, then in a brave burst of bravado he said, \"Damn it all! I'll let you go by. It's hard to stew dry so near the bar!\" An hour later the young man set off towards home, and on his way he met two of his comrades-in-arms on the road.  \"Going to ---- pub?\" he inquired.  \"Going to see that no one does go near it,\" was the answer. \"Picket duty for the rest of the day, we are.\"  \"But Wankin--\"  \"What?\"  The young man explained, and shortly afterwards Wankin went to headquarters under an armed escort. Three days later I saw his head sticking out through the guard-room window, and at that time I had not heard of the London road escapade.  \"Here on account of drink?\" I asked him.  \"You fool,\" he roared at me. \"Do you think I mistook this damned place for the canteen?\"  I like Wankin and most of his mates like him. We feel that when detention, barrack confinement and English taverns will be things of yesterday, Wankin will make a good and trustworthy friend in the trenches.     CHAPTER VI  THE NIGHT SIDE OF SOLDIERING   There are three things in military life which make a great appeal to me; the rifle's reply to the pull of the trigger-finger, the gossip of soldiers in the crowded canteen, and the onward movement of a thousand men in full marching order with arms at the trail. And at no time is this so impressive as at night when with rifles held in a horizontal position by the side, the arm hanging easily from the shoulder, we march at attention in complete silence. Not a word is spoken by anyone save officers, little is heard but the dull crunch of boots on the gravel and the rustle of trenching-tool handles as they rub against trousers or haversack. Seen from a flank at the rear, the moving battalion, bending round the curve or straining to a hill, looks like the plesiosaur of the picture shown in the act of dragging its cumbrous length along. The silence is full of mystery, the gigantic mass, of which you form so minute a unit, is entirely voiceless, a dumb thing without a tongue, brooding, as it were, over some eternal sorrow or ancient wrong to which it cannot give expression. Marching thus at night, a battalion is doubly impressive. The silent monster is full of restrained power; resolute in its onward sweep, impervious to danger, it looks a menacing"]]]
