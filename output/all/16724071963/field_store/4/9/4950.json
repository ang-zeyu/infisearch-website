The school means _you_, and you must walk in and take your seat.\"  \"Yes, if you'll let me sit in the rocking-chair!\"  \"O, but that is mine, because I'm the teacher.\"  \"Then I'm goin' off into the kitchen,\" said Dotty, loftily, \"and I don't know as I'll come back. I won't promige.\"  \"O, take the rocking-chair!\" replied Prudy quickly. \"I'll sit on the ottoman; it's just as good. Glad you spoke of it, Dotty; 'twouldn't be proper for the teacher to rock. Hark! now I tingle the bell. School's begun!\"  Dotty walked along, and very demurely seated herself in the big chair.  \"Here,\" said Prudy, showing her a block, \"is your first letter; guess what the picture means, and I'll tell you the name of the letter.\"  \"That?\" said Dotty, glancing at it; \"that's a monkey; what you s'pose?\"  \"O, no! it's pretty near a monkey, not quite: it's what we call an _ape_.\"  \"A nape!\" echoed Dotty, pointing at it, and laughing. \"O, my! you don' know nothin' at all but just--do you, Prudy Parlin? Funny gell to keep school! Didn't you never see a monkey? I've seen 'em dancing tummy-tum-tum, and a man making music with a little mite of a churn.\"  \"Well, perhaps this is a monkey, and ape is its baby name,\" said Prudy, doubtfully.  \"Got a face like a dried apple--hasn't he?\" said the young pupil, admiringly. \"Rally round the flag, boys!\"  \"Hush! You mustn't sing in school. The name of this letter is A. Look at it ever so long, and say it over.\"  \"A, A, A,\" repeated Dotty, to the tune of \"John Brown.\"  Prudy took courage. \"All right, only you mustn't sing. I couldn't speak the letter better myself than you do, _so_ soon. A stands for ape.\"  \"No, for monkey.\"  The little teacher yielded the point. She had begun her school with plenty of love and patience.  \"Now tell a story,\" said Dotty, settling herself in the chair.  \"Can't you say 'please'?\" suggested Prudy, mildly. \"'Please' is but a little word, and 'thank you' is not long.\"  \"Well, please, and thank you,--'bout a ape.\"  \"I know a real nice one. Once there was a monkey--\"  \"No, a ape.\"  \"Well, a ape, then. But I didn't start right. Once Mr. 'Gustus Allen sailed round the world.\"  \"Did? Who sailed him?\"  \"O, he went in one of those ships that go puffing out of the bay. And he had a little ape, named Jacky.\"  \"How did you know? You wasn't there.\"  \"O, he told me about it. He was the brightest little creature, Jacky was. When he was cold, Mr. Allen used to tuck him right in his bosom. Sometimes he got into mischief, he knew so much.\"  \"Did he know as much as Zip? Did he ever talk in meetin'?\"  \"No, he couldn't bark the way Zip did at the lecture, but he chattered, as we do when our teeth are cold. When he'd been doing mischief he'd run round the floor of the ship, wagging his head the way I do now, as if he was as innocent as a whole lot of kittens. Why, he acted as you did, Dotty, when you was a little girl, and picked the inside out of that custard pie.\"  \"Ahem!\" said Dotty. \"I guess you think you're talkin' to somebody else, Prudy Parlin! I don't like your story; wish you'd stop.\"  \"But I was going to tell you how Jacky got sick, and there were ever so many more monkeys on board--\"  \"On what board?\"  \"On the ship. And they took care of Jacky, and brought him his supper as if they were folks.\"  \"What did he have for supper?\"  \"O, nuts and things, on a wooden plate.\"  \"I wish I was a monkey!\"  \"O, Dotty Dimple, that's a horrid speech!\"  \"Then I don't want to be a monkey; I want to be a ape. I wish I could go puffing round the world in a ship.\"  \"Well, Dotty, this isn't keeping school. What letter have you learned?\"  \"I didn't learn a letter; I learned a story. You're a funny gell to keep a _story_-school!\"  Prudy held up the block.  \"O, that picked thing? You called it a ape!\"  \"Why, Dotty Parlin! that's A.\"  \"A _what?_\"  \"I said _A_,\" repeated Prudy, with emphasis, \"only just _A_.\"  \"Why, 'tisn't A _nothing_--is it?\"  \"Dear me,\" thought Prudy, \"I don't see how folks do keep school. I'm getting just as hungry--and cross!\"  When Dotty had learned A so well that she knew it at a glance, her teacher proceeded to the next letter, which stood on the block for a bat. Dotty said the picture looked \"like Zip with an umbrella over him.\"  After the second story, she was tired of the business.  \"Look out the window, Prudy. See that whale! O, you April fool!\"  The young sister sighed over her sister's light-minded behavior. When they came to C, which stood for cat, Dotty seized her kitty and tried to feed her with lozenges. But Pusheen turned away her head with a gesture which signified,--  \"Candy isn't fit to touch. I'd eat a mouse with you, with pleasure.\"  \"Talk,\" said Dotty; \"say 'thank you,' Pusheen! No, indeed, you needn't do it; I's just in fun. God didn't give you any teef to talk with, Pussy; so you can't talk.\"  \"Now, Dotty, this next letter is D.\"  \"O, Prudy, I wish you'd hush! I've got the earache.\"  \"Ah, well!\" thought the gentle teacher, with a sigh; \"I'll try again, some other day. I'll not give it up. Grandma says, 'Time and patience make the mulberry leaf into satin.' I don't know what that means, only it's something about _perseverance_.\"     CHAPTER VII.  BOTH SIDES OF A STORY.   The little school was not resumed for some time. Not that Prudy had forgotten it, by any means; but the next Saturday she had visitors, and the following Wednesday an exciting event occurred. It concerned Susy's pony. Percy Eastman said he was called Wings \"because he hadn't any feet.\" Susy was vexed at this remark, and Prudy, taking her part, said, \"Percy is such a _pert_ boy;\" adding next moment, \"What _is_ pert?\"  But Percy only meant that the pony sadly needed some new shoes; and this was very true.  Now it happened that Mr. Parlin, being too busy to go himself, sent Eddy Johnson and Charley Piper with Wings to the blacksmith's shop. It seemed to Susy that the boys were gone a long while, for it was Wednesday afternoon, and she was impatient for a ride. She sat down to practise a little, but her mind was out of doors, and the unwilling piano seemed crying out to be let alone.  \"I can't play,\" said Susy, decidedly; \"and that's the truth.\"  At that moment a sweet little voice was heard, singing, \"John's Brown buddy;\" and Dotty Dimple's head and shoulders were thrust into the room.  \"I've broked it,\" said she; \"I've broked it all to smash.\"  \"Broke what, for pity's sakes?\"  \"Your teapot,\" replied Dotty, in a very cheerful voice.  \"O, I never did, in all my life, see such a child,\" wailed Susy. \"What made you go and meddle with my dear little gold-edged tea-set?\"  Dotty looked like an injured lamb, brushed the wayward hair out of her eyes, and gazed wistfully into her sister's face.  \"Is I your little comfort, Susy? Is I your little comfort?\"  \"No,\" cried Susy, wavering between a smile and a tear; \"no, indeed! To think of _your_ being a comfort! O, my stars!\"  \"Well, then,\" continued the little one, in a soothing, cooing tone, \"then I never broked it; it broked itself!\"  So saying, she produced from the depths of her pocket the fragments of the gilt-edged toy. They were past the healing power even of Spalding's glue, that was certain. At the painful sight, poor Susy's patience flew into as many pieces as the teapot.  \"O, you naughty, naughty thing, to say it broke itself!\"  \"Then it didn't,\" replied the little culprit, not a whit dismayed. \"Then 'twas Prudy. We was playing 'thimble-coop.' _She_ broked it all to smash!\"  \"O, mother,\" said Susy, running out to the kitchen; \"Dotty's making up fibs as fast as she can speak! You'll have to shut her up in the closet.\"  \"Not so fast, my dear. Let us wait till we hear both sides of the story.\"  And, as it turned out, Dotty really did not deserve to be punished for wrong stories. She and Prudy had each assisted in breaking the teapot; one had knocked it off the bureau, and the other had stepped on it. But Dotty, who gloried in \"a fuss,\" had begged to be the one to tell Susy the startling news. She wished to see her eyes flash, and hear her expressions of surprise. She knew that, however angry Susy might be, there was one magical sentence which would always her to terms: \"Dotty'll go out doors, 'out her hat, get cold, have the _coop_, and DIE!\"  At the bare mention of such a fearful thing, Susy's anger was sure to cool at once. This time Dotty varied her method a little.  \"See,\" said she, looking out of the window; \"the boys has came.\"  Of course that was the last of Susy's thoughts about the teapot. She rushed out of doors bareheaded, followed by Dotty. Eddy Johnson was just hitching Wings to a post near the gate.  \"Have they _shoed_ him?\" said Susy.  \"_Shoed_ him? I should think they had; all of that,\" replied Eddy, indignantly.  \"Booted him, more like,\" muttered Charley Piper, in the same tone.  \"Why, what do you mean, boys?\" said Susy, patting the pony, and gazing tenderly into his eyes.  \"O, we don't mean anything, as I know of. You must run into the house and ask your mother to come out here,\" said Eddy, mysteriously.  \"Why, it's my own pony, that my own father gave me, and if there's anything the matter with it I should think you might tell,\" cried Susy, her voice shaking with a vague dread of some terrible mishap.  \"Well, may be there isn't anything ails him,\" returned Eddy, coolly. \"I never said there was; but your mother'll know!\"  \"O, Dotty Dimple, run into the house this very minute, please to,\" exclaimed Susy, \"and ask mother--if she's combing her hair, or _anything_--to come right out here as quick as she can run, and not wait! O, dear, dear, dear! Why, Dotty Dimple Parlin! you haven't started yet! Quick! quick! quick!\"  Dotty, who had only waited to be spoken to the second time, now ran in such haste that she stumbled on the piazza steps; but, nothing daunted, jumped up and went on, delighted to know that this "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16390"],["title","Little Prudy's Dotty Dimple (#6)"],["body","something had probably happened. She startled her mother, and called her away from her toilet, with the sudden cry that the boys and pony were 'most killed.  At the same time she had the pleasure of throwing Prudy into a panic,--dear little Prudy, who had been for the last five minutes searching her treasures in the hope of finding some toy which would replace Susy's teapot.  Prudy and Dotty appeared at the gate in a very brief space; Prudy with her mouth in the shape of the letter O, and Mrs. Parlin not far off, in the act of fastening her breastpin.  \"Well, boys, what is it?\" said the good lady, smiling. \"I hardly think anything very serious has happened, either to you or the pony.\"  \"_You_ tell,\" said Eddy to Charley; \"I _dassn't_. The blacksmith's man may be mad if I do. But he's abused this hoss, though,\" continued Eddy, not waiting to let Charley speak for him; \"he's abused him awfully! It's right up and down mean; and three of us boys seen him!\"  Susy clasped her hands, and performed a \"stamp-act\" on the pavement.  \"See there,\" said Eddy, pointing triumphantly to Wings' left hind leg; \"see that--will you?\"  True enough, there were two or three small wounds, out of which was oozing thick dark blood. Susy looked as if her heart was breaking, but not a word did she speak.  \"Pete Grimes did that with his hobnail, cowhide boots!\" said Eddy, sternly.  \"With his hammer, you _mean_,\" interposed Charley.  \"With his _boot_, sir,\" persisted Eddy, with increasing eloquence. \"Didn't I see him, me and Dan Murphy? Didn't we stand there by the coal-bin, sir? He booted him well, Mis' Parlin. I'll tell you where he did it; here on the left side, ma'am. Look where the hair sticks up! Pooty well mauled--ain't he, ma'am? Pete swore at him, too. Never heard such talk--did you, Charley?\"  \"No, ma'am, I never did,\" replied Master Charley, addressing Mrs. Parlin, who fancied she could detect on Wings' glossy hide the marks of a boot, though there were no traces of the wicked oaths.  \"It is a most abusive thing--if it is so,\" said she, with much feeling; for if anything could move her gentle heart to anger, it was cruelty to animals. \"What made Mr. Grimes behave so strangely, boys? Was the pony restless?\"  \"Restless? No, indeed, ma'am,\" replied Eddy, the orator; \"as gentle as a lamb, ma'am. It was Pete Grimes's wicked temper, and his wicked disposition; that's what it was.\"  It was well for Susy that her over-strained feelings now found vent in words and tears. \"There is no grief like the grief which does not speak.\" Her dumb agony gave way, and she wept and raved like a little wild thing.  Mrs. Parlin ordered the boys to lead the pony around to the back door, and there she washed out his wounds, trying all the while to soothe Susy, whose heart was beating a quick-step, and who trembled in every limb.  \"Old Grimes is dead, that good old man!\" repeated Prudy, with angry emphasis; \"but it wasn't _his_ father. No, indeed; with the old blue buttons down the back! Why, Peter is an awful man! I saw him once, and his face looked as if he'd been rubbing it on a pen-wiper! There, Susy, don't you cry,\" she added, applying a moral lesson to her sister's wounded feelings, like a healing plaster; \"he's dreadful wicked, and one of these days he'll get hurt his own self; a horse'll strike _him_!\"  \"Yes, a horse'll strike _him_!\" echoed Dotty Dimple.  \"But what good will that do Wings?\" moaned Susy. \"Evil for evil only makes things worse.\"  Her indignation did not lessen, but rather increased, the longer she reflected upon the subject. What right had a man to abuse anybody's horse--more especially hers?  \"Mr. Grimes ought to be 'dited, and sent to the Reform School or State's Prison this very night,\" said she, in her wrath. Prudy thought precisely the same; also Miss Dimple, who looked upon the whole affair as a joke, intended for her amusement.  When Mr. Parlin came home to tea, and heard the story, he did not blame Susy in the least for her indignation, but started off for the blacksmith's with the limping pony, saying he meant to \"inquire into the business.\"  \"May I go with you?\" cried Susy.  \"Me, too?\" said Prudy, echoed by Dotty.  \"Only Susy,\" replied their father; \"she may go if she likes.\"  Susy very much wondered what her father was going to do. As they approached the shop, she saw, standing at the door, the man whose face looked as if it had been \"rubbed on a pen-wiper.\"  \"Mr. Grimes,\" said Mr. Parlin, in a pleasanter manner than Susy thought was at all necessary, \"Mr. Grimes, I believe I owe you for shoeing this pony.\"  While Mr. Grimes was making the change, Mr. Parlin added,--  \"How happens it, my friend, that this little animal bears such marks of ill treatment? See how he limps. Look at this gash.\"  \"O,\" said Mr. Grimes, \"he lamed himself by kicking out against the coal-box; he's a nervous thing.\"  Mr. Parlin then told the boys' story.  \"It is not so, upon my word and honor, sir,\" replied sooty-faced Mr. Grimes, with great amazement. \"I'll leave it to Mr. Fox.\"  Mr. Fox, and two or three other men, declared very positively that they had seen little Wings beating himself against the coal-box; and one of them pointed out to Mr. Parlin the blood-stain on the edge of the wood.  \"You can't trust much to what boys say, especially such harum-scarum fellows as Ed Johnson,\" added Mr. Fox. \"I shouldn't wonder, now, Grimes, if he and that Piper boy got their tempers up, and tried to spite you, for ordering them out of the shop. They were troublesome, and he had to speak sharp,\" added Mr. Fox, addressing Mr. Parlin again.  \"That's so!\" exclaimed Mr. Grimes. \"You take three little chaps, and have 'em meddling with your nails, and sticking scraps of iron into the coals, and it makes a man cross--or it frets _me_, and I told 'em to quit.\"  \"Saucy little rogues,\" chimed in Mr. Fox, anxious for the honor of his workman.  \"As for my striking the pony,\" continued Mr. Grimes, \"I might have patted him once or twice with the _handle_ of the hammer. I often do that; but my blows wouldn't kill a fly.\"  After a little more conversation Mr. Parlin was satisfied that no real cruelty had been used towards Wings. Susy's heart rose like a feather.  \"_Always wait till you hear both sides of a story!_\" said Mr. Parlin, as he and his daughter walked home.  \"Just the words _mother_ said this very day,\" cried Susy, skipping lightly over the paving-stones. \"It's so queer you and mother should _both_ talk so much alike.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  THE WATER-KELPIE.   It was nearly time for vacation. As the children were to start on the next Monday for Willow-brook, their mother allowed them to spend their last Wednesday afternoon with their cousin Florence. It fell to Prudy's lot to dress her little sister.  \"I'm ever so glad,\" said Dotty, \"that the barber snipped off my _kyurls_. Don't you think I do look like a boy, now, Prudy? You may call me Tommy, if you want to; I'm willin'.\"  \"There, now,\" she exclaimed, when her toilet was made, \"say me my lesson; please to, Prudy.\"  \"O, I forgot all about that\" replied the little teacher, uneasily. \"Susy 'll be done practising in half an hour, and I thought I'd just have time to make my doll's boots,--finish them, I mean. Can't you wait till Saturday, Dotty?\"  \"O, my suz, Prudy Parlin! When I get to be a great sister to you, I won't treat you so. I want to get my letters all smooth done to-day,--don't want to wait till Sat'day.\"  At any other time Prudy would have been gratified to see Dotty show so much eagerness.  \"Be kind to thy sister,\" hummed the gentle little teacher. \"Yes, I will. I'm always glad after I've been kind. Nothing makes me love Dotty so well as to try to please her!\"  \"Now,\" said she, calling her school to order, \"you've learned as far as S, which I think is doing finely, all alone, with nobody to help us. This next letter stands, you see, for a _top_. What is it we drink out of cups?\"  \"I don't get anything but milk, and that's in a mug,\" replied Dotty in an injured tone.  \"But what does mother drink? Now think.\"  Dotty eyed the letter sharply. \"Why, mamma drinks coffee sometimes, and it has grounds; but they don't look like that thing, the grounds don't! Why, that thing looks like a spade, with the teeth out, wrong side up.\"  \"You mean a _rake_\" laughed Prudy. \"Well, dear, this is T.\"  When Dotty came to X, she declared it stood \"for your thumb. Susy said so, and it was in the music-book.\"  Now came an hour of triumph for the little pupil. Her mother was both surprised and delighted to hear that her youngest daughter knew all her letters.  \"She can say them skipping about,\" said Prudy, \"and can spell a few little words, too.\"  \"C, a, t, cat, d, o, g, Zip,\" laughed Dotty, showing her deepest dimples, and frisking about the room.  \"My dear little ones,\" said Mrs. Parlin, kissing both the children, \"I am really very much gratified. Both teacher and pupil have shown a great deal of patience and perseverance.\"  These words from her beloved mother were most precious to Prudy. Dotty, though she did not know what was meant by patience and perseverance, presumed it was something fine, and laughed and danced in great glee.  Nothing remarkable happened during the visit to Florence Eastman, except that Miss Dimple and Johnny were found running off the track of the upper railroad just one second after the engine started. Everybody was very much frightened when it was all safely over. But Dotty said,--  \"O, my suz! Me an' Johnny has done that a hundred and a million times--hasn't we, Johnny? We wait till the injin w'istles, then we run on to the platform--don't we, Johnny?\"  It came out after a while, that these reckless children had also been in the habit of crossing pins on the track, to make \"scissors,\" the weight of the cars pressing the two pins into a solid _x_.  \"I still tremble,\" said Mrs. Eastman, with white lips. \"This Alice Parlin is the most daring little creature I ever saw, more harum-scarum than ever"]]]
