And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\"[17] This passage was the leading theme of the defenders of slavery in the pulpit for many years. Bishop Hopkins says,--       \"The heartless irreverence which Ham, the father of Canaan,      displayed toward his eminent parent, whose piety had just      saved him from the Deluge, presented the immediate      _occasion_ for this remarkable prophecy; but the actual      _fulfilment_ was reserved for his posterity after they had      lost the knowledge of God, and become utterly polluted by      the abominations of heathen idolatry. The Almighty,      foreseeing this total degradation of the race, ordained them      to servitude or slavery under the descendants of Shem and      Japheth, doubtless because _he judged it to be their fittest      condition_. And all history proves how accurately the      prediction has been accomplished, even to the present      day.\"[18]  Now, the first thing to be done by those who adopt this view is, to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Noah was inspired to pronounce this prophecy. Noah _had_ been, as a rule, a righteous man. For more than a hundred years he had lifted up his voice against the growing wickedness of the world. His fidelity to the cause of God was unquestioned; and for his faith and correct living, he and his entire household were saved from the Deluge. But after his miraculous deliverance from the destruction that overcame the old world, his entire character is changed. There is not a single passage to show us that he continued his avocation as a preacher. He became a husbandman; he kept a vineyard; and, more than all, he drank of the wine and got drunk! Awaking from a state of inebriation, he knew that Ham had beheld his nakedness and \"told his two brethren.\" But \"Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.\"[19] It is quite natural to suppose, that, humiliated and chagrined at his sinful conduct, and angered at the behavior of his son and grandson, Ham and Canaan, Noah expressed his disapprobation of Canaan. It was _his_ desire, on the impulse of the moment, that Canaan should suffer a humiliation somewhat commensurate with his offence; and, on the other hand, it was appropriate that he should commend the conduct of his other sons, who sought to hide their father's shame. And all this was done without any inspiration. He simply expressed himself as a fallible man.  Bishop Hopkins, however, is pleased to call this a \"prophecy.\" In order to prophesy, in the scriptural meaning of the word, a man must have the divine unction, and must be moved by the Holy Ghost; and, in addition to this, it should be said, that a true prophecy always comes to pass,--is sure of fulfilment. Noah was not inspired when he pronounced his curse against Canaan, for the sufficient reason that it was not fulfilled. He was not speaking in the spirit of prophecy when he blessed Shem and Japheth, for the good reason that their descendants have often been in bondage. Now, if these words of Noah were prophetic, were inspired of God, we would naturally expect to find _all of Canaan's descendants in bondage_, and all of Shem's out of bondage,--free! If this prophecy--granting this point to the learned bishop for argument's sake--has not been fulfilled, then we conclude one of two things; namely, these are not the words of God, or they have not been fulfilled. But they were not the words of prophecy, and consequently never had any divine authority. It was Canaan upon whom Noah pronounced the curse: and Canaan was the son of Ham; and Ham, it is said, is the progenitor of the Negro race. The Canaanites were not bondmen, but freemen,--powerful tribes when the Hebrews invaded their country; and from the Canaanites descended the bold and intelligent Carthaginians, as is admitted by the majority of writers on this subject. From Ham proceeded the Egyptians, Libyans, the Phutim, and the Cushim or Ethiopians, who, colonizing the African side of the Red Sea, subsequently extended themselves indefinitely to the west and south of that great continent. Egypt was called Chemia, or the country of Ham; and it has been thought that the Egyptian's deity, Hammon or Ammon, was a deification of Ham.[20] The Carthaginians were successful in numerous wars against the sturdy Romans. So in this, as in many other instances, the prophecy of Noah failed.  Following the chapter containing the prophecy of Noah, the historian records the genealogy of the descendants of Ham and Canaan. We will quote the entire account that we may be assisted to the truth.       \"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and      Canaan; and the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah,      and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba and      Dedan. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in      the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore      it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the      Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech,      and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that      land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city      Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah:      the same is a great city. And Mizraim begat Ludim, and      Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, and Pathrusim, and      Casluhim (out of whom came Philistim), and Caphtorim. And      Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth, and the      Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, and the      Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite,      and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the      families of the Canaanites spread abroad. And the border of      the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto      Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah,      and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. These are the sons of Ham,      after their families, after their tongues, in their      countries, and in their nations.\"[21]  Here is a very minute account of the family of Ham, who it is said was to share the fate of his son Canaan, and a clear account of the children of Canaan. \"Nimrod,\" says the record, \"began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord.... And the beginning of his kingdom,\" etc. We find that Cush was the oldest son of Ham, and the father of Nimrod the \"mighty one in the earth,\" whose \"kingdom\" was so extensive. He founded the Babylonian empire, and was the father of the founder of the city of Nineveh, one of the grandest cities of the ancient world. These wonderful achievements were of the children of Cush, the ancestor of the Negroes. It is fair to suppose that this line of Ham's posterity was not lacking in powers necessary to found cities and kingdoms, and maintain government.  Thus far we have been enabled to see, according to the Bible record, that the posterity of Canaan did not go into bondage; that it was a powerful people, both in point of numbers and wealth; and, from the number and character of the cities it built, we infer that it was an intellectual posterity. We conclude that thus far there is no evidence, from a biblical standpoint, that Noah's prophecy was fulfilled. But, notwithstanding the absence of scriptural proof as to the bondage of the children of Canaan, the venerable Dr. Mede says, \"There never has been a son of Ham who has shaken a sceptre over the head of Japheth. Shem has subdued Japheth, and Japheth has subdued Shem; but Ham has never subdued either.\" The doctor is either falsifying the facts of history, or is ignorant of history. The Hebrews were in bondage in Egypt for centuries. Egypt was peopled by Misraim, the second son of Ham. Who were the Shemites? They were Hebrews! The Shemites were in slavery to the Hamites. Melchizedek, whose name was expressive of his character,--_king of righteousness_ (or a righteous king), was a worthy priest of the most high God; and Abimelech, whose name imports _parental king_, pleaded the integrity of his heart and the righteousness of his nation before God, and his plea was admitted. Yet both these personages appear to have been Canaanites.\"[22] Melchizedek and Abimelech were Canaanites, and the most sacred and honorable characters in Old-Testament history. It was Abraham, a Shemite, who, meeting Melchizedek, a Canaanite, gave him a tenth of all his spoils. It was Nimrod, a Cushite, who \"went to Asher, and built Nineveh,\" after subduing the Shemites, So it seems very plain that Noah's prophecy did not come true in every respect, and that it was not the word of God. \"And God blessed Noah and his sons.\"[23] God pronounces his blessing upon this entire family, and enjoins upon them to \"be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth.\" Afterwards Noah seeks to abrogate the blessing of God by his \"cursed be Canaan.\" But this was only the bitter expression of a drunken and humiliated parent lacking divine authority. No doubt he and his other two sons conformed their conduct to the spirit of the curse pronounced, and treated the Hamites accordingly. The scholarly Dr. William Jones[24] says that Ham was the youngest son of Noah; that he had four sons, Cush, Misraim, Phut, and Canaan; and that they peopled Africa and part of Asia.[25] The Hamites were the offspring of Noah, and one of the three great families that have peopled the earth.[26]   FOOTNOTES:  [1] Gen. i. 27.

CUSHIM AND ETHIOPIA.--ETHIOPIANS, WHITE AND BLACK.--NEGRO      CHARACTERISTICS.--THE DARK CONTINENT.--THE ANTIQUITY OF THE      NEGRO.--INDISPUTABLE EVIDENCE.--THE MILITARY AND SOCIAL      CONDITION OF NEGROES.--CAUSE OF COLOR.--THE TERM ETHIOPIAN.   There seems to be a great deal of ignorance and confusion in the use of the word \"Negro;\"[27] and about as much trouble attends the proper classification of the inhabitants of Africa. In the preceding chapter we endeavored to prove, not that Ham and Canaan were the progenitors of the Negro races,--for that is admitted by the most consistent enemies of the blacks,--but that the human race is _one_, and that Noah's curse was not a divine prophecy.  The term \"Negro\" seems to be applied chiefly to the dark and woolly-haired people who inhabit Western Africa. But the Negro is to be found also in Eastern Africa.[28] Zonaras says, \"Chus is the person from whom the Cuseans are derived. They are the same people as the Ethiopians.\" This view is corroborated by Josephus.[29] Apuleius, and Eusebius. The Hebrew term \"Cush\" is translated Ethiopia by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and by almost all other versions, ancient and modern, as well as by the English version. \"It is not, therefore, to be doubted that the term '_Cushim_' has by the interpretation of all ages been translated by 'Ethiopians,' because they were also known by their black color, and their transmigrations, which were easy and frequent.\"[30] But while it is a fact, supported by both sacred and profane history, that the terms \"Cush\" and \"Ethiopian\" were used interchangeably, there seems to be no lack of proof that the same terms were applied frequently to a people who were not Negroes. It should be remembered, moreover, that there were nations who were black, and yet were not Negroes. And the only distinction amongst all these people, who are branches of the Hamitic family, is the texture of the hair. \"But it is _equally_ certain, as we have seen, that the term 'Cushite' is applied in Scripture to other branches of the same family; as, for instance, to the Midianites, from whom Moses selected his wife, and who could not have been Negroes. The term 'Cushite,' therefore, is used in Scripture as denoting nations who were not black, or in any respect Negroes, and also countries south of Egypt, whose inhabitants were Negroes; and yet both races are declared to be the descendants of Cush, the son of Ham. Even in Ezekiel's day the interior African nations were not of one race; for he represents Cush, Phut, Lud, and Chub, as either themselves constituting, or as being amalgamated with, 'a mingled people' (Ezek. xxx. 5); 'that is to say,' says Faber, 'it was a nation of Negroes who are represented as very numerous,--_all_ the mingled people.'\"[31]  The term \"Ethiopia\" was anciently given to all those whose color was darkened by the sun. Herodotus, therefore, distinguishes the Eastern Ethiopians who had straight hair, from the Western Ethiopians who had curly or woolly hair.[32]. They are a twofold people, lying extended in a long tract from the rising to the setting sun.\"[33]  The conclusion is patent. The words \"Ethiopia\" and \"Cush\" were used always to describe a black people, or the country where such a people lived. The term \"Negro,\" from the Latin \"_niger_\" and the French \"_noir_,\" means black; and consequently is a modern term, with all the original meaning of Cush and Ethiopia, with a single exception. We called attention above to the fact that all Ethiopians were not of the pure Negro type, but were nevertheless a branch of the original Hamitic family from whence sprang all the dark races. The term \"Negro\" is now used to designate the people, who, in addition to their dark complexion, have curly or woolly hair. It is in this connection that we shall use the term in this work.[34]  Africa, the home of the indigenous dark races, in a geographic and ethnographic sense, is the most wonderful country in the world It is thoroughly tropical. It has an area in English square miles of 11,556,600, with a population of 192,520,000 souls. It lies between the latitudes of 38° north and 35° south; and is, strictly speaking, an enormous peninsula, attached to Asia by the Isthmus of Suez. The most northern point is the cape, situated a little to the west of Cabo Blanco, and opposite Sicily, which lies in latitude 37° 20' 40\" north, longitude 9° 41' east. Its southernmost point is Cabo d'Agulhas, in 34° 49' 15\" south; the distance between these two points being 4,330 geographical, or about 5,000 English miles. The westernmost point is Cabo Verde, in longitude 17° 33' west; its easternmost, Cape Jerdaffun, in longitude 51° 21' east, latitude 10° 25' north, the distance between the two points being about the same as its length. The western coasts are washed by the Atlantic, the northern by the Mediterranean, and the eastern by the Indian Ocean. The shape of this \"dark continent\" is likened to a triangle or to an Oval. It is rich in oils, ivory, gold, and precious timber. It has beautiful lakes and mighty rivers, that are the insoluble problems of the present times.  Of the antiquity of the Negro there can be no doubt. He is known as thoroughly to history as any of the other families of men. He appears at the first dawn of history, and has continued down to the present time. The scholarly Gliddon says, that \"the hieroglyphical designation of 'KeSH,' exclusively applied to _African_ races as distinct from the Egyptian, has been found by Lepsius as far back as the monuments of the sixth dynasty, 3000 B.C. But the great influx of Negro and Mulatto races into Egypt as captives dated from the twelfth dynasty; when, about the twenty-second century, B.C., Pharaoh SESOUR-TASEN extended his conquests up the Nile far into Nigritia. After the eighteenth dynasty the monuments come down to the third century, A.D., without one single instance in the Pharaonic or Ptolemaic periods that Negro labor was ever directed to any agricultural or utilitarian objects.\"[35] The Negro was found in great numbers with the Sukim, Thut, Lubin, and other African nations, who formed the strength of the army of the king of Egypt, Shishak, when he came against Rehoboam in the year 971 B.C.; and in his tomb, opened in 1849, there were found among his depicted army the exact representation of the genuine Negro race, both in color, hair, and physiognomy. Negroes are also represented in Egyptian paintings as connected with the military campaigns of the eighteenth dynasty. They formed a part of the army of Ibrahim Pacha, and were prized as gallant soldiers at Moncha and in South Arabia.[36] And Herodotus assures us that Negroes were found in the armies of Sesostris and Xerxes; and, at the present time, they are no inconsiderable part of the standing army of Egypt.[37] Herodotus states that eighteen of the Egyptian kings were Ethiopians.[38]  It is quite remarkable to hear a writer like John P. Jeffries, who evidently is not very friendly in his criticisms of the Negro, make such a positive declaration as the following:--       \"Every rational mind must, therefore, readily conclude that      the African race has been in existence, as a distinct      people, over four thousand two hundred years; and how long      before that period is a matter of conjecture only, there      being no reliable data upon which to predicate any reliable      opinion.\"[39]  It is difficult to find a writer on ethnology, ethnography, or Egyptology, who doubts the antiquity of the Negroes as a distinct people. Dr. John C. Nott of Mobile, Ala., a Southern man in the widest meaning, in his \"Types of Mankind,\" while he tries to make his book acceptable to Southern slaveholders, strongly maintains the antiquity of the Negro.       \"Ethnological science, then, possesses not only the      authoritative testimonies of Lepsius and Birch in proof of      the existence of Negro races during the twenty-fourth      century, B.C., but, the same fact being conceded by all      living Egyptologists, we may hence"]]]
