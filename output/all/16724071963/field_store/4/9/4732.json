On the stone lay a pencil, and a few feet from it lay the Doctor, face downwards, as he had lain all night, with the hoar frost on his black hair.  Ah! these grave-stones (they were ugly things in those days; not the light, hopeful, pretty crosses we set up now), how they seem remorselessly to imprison and keep our dear dead friends away from us! And yet they do not lie with a feather's weight upon the souls that are gone, while GOD only knows how heavily they press upon the souls that are left behind. Did the spirit whose body was with the dead, stand that morning by the body whose spirit was with the dead, and pity him? Let us only talk about what we know.  After this it was said that the Doctor had got a fever, and was dying, but he got better of it; and then that he was out of his mind, but he got better of that, and came out looking much as usual, except that his hair never seemed quite so black again, as if a little of that night's hoar frost still remained. And no further misfortune happened to him that I ever heard of; and as time went on he grew a beard, and got stout, and kept a German poodle, and gave tea-parties to other people's children. As to the grave-stone story, whatever it was to him at the end of twenty years, it was a great convenience to his friends; for when he said anything they didn't agree with, or did anything they couldn't understand, or didn't say or do what was expected of him, what could be easier or more conclusive than to shake one's head and say,  \"The fact is, our Doctor has been a little odd, _ever since_--!\"   THE DOCTOR'S TEA-PARTY.  There is one great advantage attendant upon invitations to tea with a doctor. No objections can be raised on the score of health. It is obvious that it must be fine enough to go out when the Doctor asks you, and that his tea-cakes may be eaten with perfect impunity.  Those tea-cakes were always good; to-night they were utterly delicious; there was a perfect _abandon_ of currants, and the amount of citron peel was enervating to behold. Then the housekeeper waited in awful splendour, and yet the Doctor's authority over her seemed as absolute as if he were an Eastern despot. Deordie must be excused for believing in the charms of living alone. It certainly has its advantages. The limited sphere of duty conduces to discipline in the household, demand does not exceed supply in the article of waiting, and there is not that general scrimmage of conflicting interests which besets a large family in the most favoured circumstances. The housekeeper waits in black silk, and looks as if she had no meaner occupation than to sit in a rocking-chair, and dream of damson cheese.  Rustling, hospitable, and subservient, this one retired at last, and--  \"Now,\" said the Doctor, \"for the verandah; and to look at the moon.\"  The company adjourned with a rush, the rear being brought up by the poodle, who seemed quite used to the proceedings; and there under the verandah, framed with passion-flowers and geraniums, the Doctor had gathered mats, rugs, cushions, and arm-chairs, for the party; while far up in the sky, a yellow-faced harvest moon looked down in awful benignity.  \"Now!\" said the Doctor. \"Take your seats. Ladies first, and gentlemen afterwards. Mary and Tiny, race for the American rocking-chair. Well done! Of course it will hold both. Now, boys, shake down. No one is to sit on the stone, or put his feet on the grass: and when you're ready, I'll begin.\"  \"We're ready,\" said the girls.  The boys shook down in a few minutes more, and the Doctor began the story of   \"THE BROWNIES.\"  \"Bairns are a burden,\" said the Tailor to himself as he sat at work. He lived in a village on some of the glorious moors of the north of England; and by bairns he meant children, as every Northman knows.  \"Bairns are a burden,\" and he sighed.  \"Bairns are a blessing,\" said the old lady in the window. \"It is the family motto. The Trouts have had large families and good luck for generations; that is, till your grandfather's time. He had one only son. I married him. He was a good husband, but he had been a spoilt child. He had always been used to be waited upon, and he couldn't fash to look after the farm when it was his own. We had six children. They are all dead but you, who were the youngest. You were bound to a tailor. When the farm came into your hands, your wife died, and you have never looked up since. The land is sold now, but not the house. No! no! you're right enough there; but you've had your troubles, son Thomas, and the lads _are_ idle!\"  It was the Tailor's mother who spoke. She was a very old woman, and helpless. She was not quite so bright in her intellect as she had been, and got muddled over things that had lately happened; but she had a clear memory for what was long past, and was very pertinacious in her opinions. She knew the private history of almost every family in the place, and who of the Trouts were buried under which old stones in the churchyard; and had more tales of ghosts, doubles, warnings, fairies, witches, hobgoblins, and such like, than even her grandchildren had ever come to the end of. Her hands trembled with age, and she regretted this for nothing more than for the danger it brought her into of spilling the salt. She was past housework, but all day she sat knitting hearth-rugs out of the bits and scraps of cloth that were shred in the tailoring. How far she believed in the wonderful tales she told, and the odd little charms she practised, no one exactly knew; but the older she grew, the stranger were the things she remembered, and the more testy she was if any one doubted their truth. \"Bairns are a blessing!\" said she. \"It is the family motto.\"  \"_Are they_?\" said the Tailor emphatically.  He had a high respect for his mother, and did not like to contradict her, but he held his own opinion, based upon personal experience; and not being a metaphysician, did not understand that it is safer to found opinions on principles than on experience, since experience may alter, but principles cannot.  \"Look at Tommy,\" he broke out suddenly. \"That boy does nothing but whittle sticks from morning till night. I have almost to lug him out of bed o' mornings. If I send him an errand, he loiters; I'd better have gone myself. If I set him to do anything, I have to tell him everything; I could sooner do it myself. And if he does work, it's done so unwillingly, with such a poor grace; better, far better, to do it myself. What housework do the boys ever do but looking after the baby? And this afternoon she was asleep in the cradle, and off they went, and when she awoke, _I_ must leave my work to take her. _I_ gave her her supper, and put her to bed. And what with what they want and I have to get, and what they take out to play with and lose, and what they bring in to play with and leave about, bairns give some trouble, Mother, and I've not an easy life of it. The pay is poor enough when one can get the work, and the work is hard enough when one has a clear day to do it in; but housekeeping and bairn-minding don't leave a man much time for his trade. No! no! Ma'am, the luck of the Trouts is gone, and 'Bairns are a burden,' is the motto now. Though they are one's own,\" he muttered to himself, \"and not bad ones, and I did hope once would have been a blessing.\"  \"There's Johnnie,\" murmured the old lady, dreamily. \"He has a face like an apple.\"  \"And is about as useful,\" said the Tailor. \"He might have been different, but his brother leads him by the nose.\"  His brother led him in as the Tailor spoke, not literally by his snub, though, but by the hand. They were a handsome pair, this lazy couple. Johnnie especially had the largest and roundest of foreheads, the reddest of cheeks, the brightest of eyes, the quaintest and most twitchy of chins, and looked altogether like a gutta-percha cherub in a chronic state of longitudinal squeeze. They were locked together by two grubby paws, and had each an armful of moss, which they deposited on the floor as they came in.  \"I've swept this floor once to-day,\" said the father, \"and I'm not going to do it again. Put that rubbish outside.\" \"Move it, Johnnie!\" said his brother, seating himself on a stool, and taking out his knife and a piece of wood, at which he cut and sliced; while the apple-cheeked Johnnie stumbled and stamped over the moss, and scraped it out on the doorstep, leaving long trails of earth behind him, and then sat down also.  \"And those chips the same,\" added the Tailor; \"I will _not_ clear up the litter you lads make.\"  \"Pick 'em up, Johnnie,\" said Thomas Trout, junior, with an exasperated sigh; and the apple tumbled up, rolled after the flying chips, and tumbled down again.  \"Is there any supper, Father?\" asked Tommy.  \"No, there is not, Sir, unless you know how to get it,\" said the Tailor; and taking his pipe, he went out of the house.  \"Is there really nothing to eat, Granny?\" asked the boy.  \"No, my bairn, only some bread for breakfast to-morrow.\"  \"What makes Father so cross, Granny?\"  \"He's wearied, and you don't help him, my dear.\"  \"What could I do, Grandmother?\"  \"Many little things, if you tried,\" said the old lady. \"He spent half-an-hour to-day, while you were on the moor, getting turf for the fire, and you could have got it just as well, and he been at his work.\"  \"He never told me,\" said Tommy.  \"You might help me a bit just now, if you would, my laddie,\" said the old lady coaxingly; \"these bits of cloth want tearing into lengths, and if you get 'em ready, I can go on knitting. There'll be some food when this mat is done and sold.\"  \"I'll try,\" said Tommy, lounging up with desperate resignation. \"Hold my knife, Johnnie. Father's been cross, and everything has been miserable, ever since the farm was sold. I wish I were a big man, and could make a fortune.--Will that do, Granny?\"  The old lady put down her knitting and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16052"],["title","The Brownies and Other Tales (#2)"],["body","oked. \"My dear, that's too short. Bless me! I gave the lad a piece to measure by.\"  \"I thought it was the same length. Oh, dear! I am so tired;\" and he propped himself against the old lady's chair.  \"My dear! don't lean so; you'll tipple me over!\" she shrieked.  \"I beg your pardon, Grandmother. Will _that_ do?\"  \"It's that much too long.\"  \"Tear that bit off. Now it's all right.\"  \"But, my dear, that wastes it. Now that bit is of no use. There goes my knitting, you awkward lad!\"  \"Johnnie, pick it up!--Oh! Grandmother, I _am_ so hungry.\" The boy's eyes filled with tears, and the old lady was melted in an instant.  \"What can I do for you, my poor bairns?\" said she. \"There, never mind the scraps, Tommy.\"  \"Tell us a tale, Granny. If you told us a new one, I shouldn't keep thinking of that bread in the cupboard.--Come, Johnnie, and sit against me. Now then!\"  \"I doubt if there's one of my old-world cracks I haven't told you,\" said the old lady, \"unless it's a queer ghost story was told me years ago of that house in the hollow with the blocked-up windows.\"  \"Oh! not ghosts!\" Tommy broke in; \"we've had so many. I know it was a rattling, or a scratching, or a knocking, or a figure in white; and if it turns out a tombstone or a white petticoat, I hate it.\"  \"It was nothing of the sort as a tombstone,\" said the old lady with dignity. \"It's a good half-mile from the churchyard. And as to white petticoats, there wasn't a female in the house; he wouldn't have one; and his victuals came in by the pantry window. But never mind! Though it's as true as a sermon.\"  Johnnie lifted his head from his brother's knee.  \"Let Granny tell what she likes, Tommy. It's a new ghost, and I should like to know who he was, and why his victuals came in by the window.\"  \"I don't like a story about victuals,\" sulked Tommy. \"It makes me think of the bread. O Granny dear! do tell us a fairy story. You never will tell us about the Fairies, and I know you know.\"  \"Hush! hush!\" said the old lady. \"There's Miss Surbiton's Love-letter, and her Dreadful End.\"  \"I know Miss Surbiton, Granny. I think she was a goose. Why don't you tell us about the Fairies?\"  \"Hush! hush! my dear. There's the Clerk and the Corpse-candles.\"  \"I know the Corpse-candles, Granny. Besides, they make Johnnie dream, and he wakes me to keep him company. _Why_ won't you tell us about the Fairies?\"  \"My dear, they don't like it,\" said the old lady.  \"O Granny dear, why don't they? Do tell! I shouldn't think of the bread a bit, if you told us about the Fairies. I know nothing about them.\"  \"He lived in this house long enough,\" said the old lady. \"But it's not lucky to name him.\"  \"O Granny, we are so hungry and miserable, what can it matter?\"  \"Well, that's true enough,\" she sighed. \"Trout's luck is gone; it went with the Brownie, I believe.\"  \"Was that _he_, Granny?\"  \"Yes, my dear, he lived with the Trouts for several generations.\"  \"What was he like, Granny?\"  \"Like a little man, they say, my dear.\"  \"What did he do?\"  \"He came in before the family were up, and swept up the hearth, and lighted the fire, and set out the breakfast, and tidied the room, and did all sorts of house-work. But he never would be seen, and was off before they could catch him. But they could hear him laughing and playing about the house sometimes.\"  \"What a darling! Did they give him any wages, Granny?\"  \"No! my dear. He did it for love. They set a pancheon of clear water for him over night, and now and then a bowl of bread-and-milk, or cream. He liked that, for he was very dainty. Sometimes he left a bit of money in the water. Sometimes he weeded the garden, or threshed the corn. He saved endless trouble, both to men and maids.\"  \"O Granny! why did he go?\"  \"The maids caught sight of him one night, my dear, and his coat was so ragged, that they got a new suit, and a linen shirt for him, and laid them by the bread-and-milk bowl. But when Brownie saw the things, he put them on, and dancing round the kitchen, sang,       'What have we here? Hemten hamten!      Here will I never more tread nor stampen,'  and so danced through the door, and never came back again.\"  \"O Grandmother! But why not? Didn't he like the new clothes?\"  \"The Old Owl knows, my dear; I don't.\"  \"Who's the Old Owl, Granny?\"  \"I don't exactly know, my dear. It's what my mother used to say when we asked anything that puzzled her. It was said that the Old Owl was Nanny Besom (a witch, my dear!), who took the shape of a bird, but couldn't change her voice, and that's why the owl sits silent all day for fear she should betray herself by speaking, and has no singing voice like other birds. Many people used to go and consult the Old Owl at moon-rise, in my young days.\"  \"Did you ever go, Granny?\"  \"Once, very nearly, my dear.\"  \"Oh! tell us, Granny dear.--There are no Corpse-candles, Johnnie; it's only moonlight,\" he added consolingly, as Johnnie crept closer to his knee, and pricked his little red ears.  \"It was when your grandfather was courting me, my dears,\" said the old lady, \"and I couldn't quite make up my mind. So I went to my mother, and said, 'He's this on the one side, but then he's that on the other, and so on. Shall I say yes or no?' And my mother said, 'The Old Owl knows;' for she was fairly puzzled. So says I, 'I'll go and ask her to-night, as sure as the moon rises.'  \"So at moon-rise I went, and there in the white light by the gate stood your grandfather. 'What are you doing here at this time o' night?' says I. 'Watching your window,' says he. 'What are _you_ doing here at this time o' night?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said I, and burst out crying.\"  \"What for?\" said Johnnie.  \"I can't rightly tell you, my dear,\" said the old lady, \"but it gave me such a turn to see him. And without more ado your grandfather kissed me. 'How dare you?' said I. 'What do you mean?' 'The Old Owl knows,' said he. So we never went.\"  \"How stupid!\" said Tommy.  \"Tell us more about Brownie, please,\" said Johnnie, \"Did he ever live with anybody else?\"  \"There are plenty of Brownies,\" said the old lady, \"or used to be in my mother's young days. Some houses had several.\" \"Oh! I wish ours would come back!\" cried both the boys in chorus. \"He'd--  \"tidy the room,\" said Johnnie;  \"fetch the turf,\" said Tommy;  \"pick up the chips,\" said Johnnie;  \"sort your scraps,\" said Tommy;  \"and do everything. Oh! I wish he hadn't gone away.\"  \"What's that?\" said the Tailor, coming in at this moment.  \"It's the Brownie, Father,\" said Tommy. \"We are so sorry he went, and do so wish we had one.\"  \"What nonsense have you been telling them, Mother?\" asked the Tailor.  \"Heighty teighty,\" said the old lady, bristling. \"Nonsense, indeed! As good men as you, son Thomas, would as soon have jumped off the crags, as spoken lightly of _them_, in my mother's young days.\"  \"Well, well,\" said the Tailor, \"I beg their pardon. They never did aught for me, whatever they did for my forbears; but they're as welcome to the old place as ever, if they choose to come. There's plenty to do.\"  \"Would you mind our setting a pan of water, Father?\" asked Tommy very gently. \"There's no bread-and-milk.\"  \"You may set what you like, my lad,\" said the Tailor; \"and I wish there were bread-and-milk for your sakes, bairns. You should have it, had I got it. But go to bed now.\"  They lugged out a pancheon, and filled it with more dexterity than usual, and then went off to bed, leaving the knife in one corner, the wood in another, and a few splashes of water in their track.  There was more room than comfort in the ruined old farm-house, and the two boys slept on a bed of cut heather, in what had been the old malt-loft. Johnnie was soon in the land of dreams, growing rosier and rosier as he slept, a tumbled apple among the grey heather. But not so lazy Tommy. The idea of a domesticated Brownie had taken full possession of his mind; and whither Brownie had gone, where he might be found, and what would induce him to return, were mysteries he longed to solve. \"There's an owl living in the old shed by the mere,\" he thought. \"It may be the Old Owl herself, and she knows, Granny says. When Father's gone to bed, and the moon rises, I'll go.\" Meanwhile he lay down.         *       *       *       *       *  The moon rose like gold, and went up into the heavens like silver, flooding the moors with a pale ghostly light, taking the colour out of the heather, and painting black shadows under the stone walls. Tommy opened his eyes, and ran to the window. \"The moon has risen,\" said he, and crept softly down the ladder, through the kitchen, where was the pan of water, but no Brownie, and so out on to the moor. The air was fresh, not to say chilly; but it was a glorious night, though everything but the wind and Tommy seemed asleep. The stones, the walls, the gleaming lanes, were so intensely still; the church tower in the valley seemed awake and watching, but silent; the houses in the village round it had all their eyes shut, that is, their window-blinds down; and it seemed to Tommy as if the very moors had drawn white sheets over them, and lay sleeping also.  \"Hoot! hoot!\" said a voice from the fir plantation behind him. Somebody else was awake, then. \"It's the Old Owl,\" said Tommy; and there she came, swinging heavily across the moor with a flapping stately flight, and sailed into the shed by the mere. The old lady moved faster than she seemed to do, and though Tommy ran hard she was in the shed some time before him. When he got in, no bird was to be seen, but he heard a crunching sound from above, and looking up, there sat the Old Owl, pecking and tearing and munching at some shapeless black object, and blinking at him--Tommy--with yellow eyes.  \"Oh dear!\" said Tommy, for he didn't much like it.  The Old Owl dropped the black mass on to the floor; and Tommy did not care somehow to examine it.  \"Come up! come up!\" said she hoarsely.  She could speak, then! Beyond all doubt it was _the_ Old Owl, and none other. Tommy shuddered.  "]]]
