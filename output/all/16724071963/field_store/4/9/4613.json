We are going for a walk across the common.--We shall be in to tea, dear mother. Will you have it ready for us not later than five o'clock? And I am sure you will join me, mother darling, in asking Miss O'Hara to stay, too.\"  \"But Miss O'Hara doesn't want to join either you or your 'mother darling,'\" said Kathleen in her rudest tone. \"It is Ruth I want. I have come here for her. She must return with me at once.\"  \"But I can't. I am ever so sorry, Miss O'Hara.\"  \"You mean that you won't come when I have called for you?\"  \"I am with Miss Weldon at present.\"  \"Be sensible, dear,\" said Mrs. Weldon at that moment. \"You don't quite understand our manners in this country. However attached we may be to a person, we don't enter a strange house and snatch that person out of it. It isn't our way; and I don't think--you will forgive me for saying it--that your way is as nice as ours. Be persuaded, dear, and join Cassandra and Ruth, and have a happy time.\"  Kathleen's face had turned crimson. She looked from Mrs. Weldon to Cassandra, and then she looked at Ruth. Suddenly her eyes brimmed up with tears.  \"I don't think I can ever change my way,\" she said. \"I am sorry if I am rude and not understood. Perhaps, after all, I am mistaken, about Ruth; perhaps she is not my real proper affinity. I am a very unhappy girl. I wish I could go back to mother and to my dad. I shouldn't be lonely if I were in the midst of the mountains, and if I could see the streams and the blue sea. I don't know why Aunt Katie O'Flynn sent me to this horrid place. I wish I was back in the old country. They don't talk as you talk in the old country and they don't look as you look. If you put your heart at the feet of a body in old Ireland, that body doesn't kick it away. I will go. I don't want your tea. I don't want anything that you have to offer me. I don't like any of you. I am sorry if you think me rude, but I can't help myself. Good-bye.\"  \"No, no; stay. Stay and visit with me, and tell me about the old country and the sea and the mountains,\" said Mrs. Weldon.  But Kathleen shook her head fiercely, and the next moment left the room.  \"Poor, strange little girl,\" thought the good woman. \"I see she is about to heap unhappiness on herself and others. What is to be done for her?\"  \"I like her,\" said Ruth. \"She is very impulsive, but she is------\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Cassandra, \"she has a good heart, of course; but I foresee that she is up to all sorts of mischief. She doesn't understand our ways. Why did she leave her own country?\"  Ruth was silent. She looked wistful.  \"Come along, Ruthie; we will be late. I have no end of schemes in my head. I mean to help you. You will win that scholarship.\"  Ruth smiled. Presently she and Cassandra were crossing the common arm-in-arm. In the interest of their own conversation they forgot Kathleen.  When that young lady left the house she ran back to the Tennants'.  \"I will write to dad to-night and tell him that I can't stay,\" she thought. \"Oh, dear, my heart is in my mouth! I shall have a broken heart if this sort of thing goes on.\"  She entered the house. There sat Mrs. Tennant with a great basket of stockings before her. The remains of a rough-looking tea were on the table. The boys had disappeared.  \"Come in, Kathleen,\" called Mrs. Tennant, \"and have your tea. I want Maria to clear the tea-things away, as I have some cutting out to do; so be quick, dear.\"  Kathleen entered. The untidy table did not trouble her in the least; she was accustomed to things of that sort at home. She sat down, helped herself to a thick slice of bread-and-butter, and ate it, while burning thoughts filled her mind.  \"Have some tea. You haven't touched any,\" said Mrs. Tennant.  \"I'd rather have cold water, please,\" Kathleen replied.  She went to the sideboard, filled a glass, and drank it off.  \"Mrs. Tennant,\" she said when she had finished, \"what possessed you to live in England? You had all the world to choose from. Why did you come to a horrible place like this?\"  \"But I like it,\" said Mrs. Tennant.  \"You don't look as if you did. I never saw such a worn-out poor body. Are you awfully old?\"  \"You would think me so,\" replied Mrs. Tennant, with a smile; \"but as a matter of fact I am not forty yet.\"  \"Not forty!\" said Kathleen. \"But forty's an awful age, isn't it? I mean, you want crutches when you are forty, don't you?\"  \"Not as a rule, my dear. I trust when I am forty I shall not want a crutch. I shall be forty in two years, and that by some people is considered young.\"  \"Then I suppose it is mending those horrid stockings that makes you so old.\"  \"Mending stockings doesn't help to keep you young, certainly.\"  \"Shall I help you? I used to cobble for old nurse when I was at home.\"  \"But I shouldn't like you to cobble these.\"  \"Oh, I can darn, you know.\"  \"Then do, Kathleen. I should take it very kindly if you would. Here is worsted, and here is a needle. Will you sit by me and tell me about your home?\"  Kathleen certainly would not have believed her own ears had she been told an hour ago that she would end her first fit of desperate naughtiness by darning stockings for the Tennant boys. She did not darn well; but then, Mrs. Tennant was not particular. She certainly--although she said she would not--did cobble these stockings to an extraordinary extent; but her work and the chat with Mrs. Tennant did her good, and she went upstairs to dress for supper in a happier frame of mind.  \"I will stay here for a little,\" she said finally to Mrs. Tennant, \"because I think it will help you. You look so terribly tired; and I don't think you ought to have this horrible work to do. I'd like to do it for you, but I don't suppose I shall have time. I will stay for a bit and see what I can make of the foundation girls.\"  \"The foundation girls?\"  \"Oh, yes; don't ask me to explain. There are a hundred of them at the Great Shirley School, and I am going--No, I can't explain. I will stop here instead of running away. I meant to run away when my affinity would have nothing to do with me.\"  \"Really, Kathleen, you are a most extraordinary girl.\"  \"Of course I am,\" said Kathleen. \"Did you ever suppose that I was anything else? I am very remarkable, and I am very naughty. I always was, and I always will be. I am up to no end of mischief. I wish you could have seen me and Rory together at home. Oh, what didn't we do? Do you know that once we walked across a little bridge of metal which is put between two of the stables? It is just a narrow iron rod, six feet in length. If we had either of us fallen we'd have been dashed to pieces on the cobble-stones forty feet below. Mother saw me when I was half-way across, and she gave a shriek. It nearly finished me, but I steadied myself and got across. Oh, it was jolly! I am going to set some of the foundation girls at that sort of thing. I expect I shall have great fun with them. It is principally because my affinity won't have anything to do with me; she is attaching herself to another, and that other is little better than a monster. Your Alice won't like me; and, to be frank with you, I don't like her. I like you, because you are poor and worried and seem old for your age--although your age is a great one--and because you have to cobble those horrid socks. There! good-bye for the present. Don't hate me too much; I can't help the way I am made. Oh; I hear Alice. What a detestable voice she has! Now then, I'm off.\"  Kathleen ran up to her room, and again she locked the door. She heard Alice's step, and she felt a certain vindictiveness as she turned the key in the lock. Alice presently took the handle of the door and shook it.  \"Let me in at once, Kathleen,\" she said. \"I really can't put up with this sort of thing any longer. I want to get into my room; I want to tidy myself. I am going to supper to-night with Cassandra Weldon.\"  \"Then you don't get in,\" whispered Kathleen to herself. Aloud she said:  \"I am sorry, darling, but I am specially busy, and I really must have my share of the room to myself.\"  \"Do open the door, Kathleen,\" now almost pleaded poor Alice. \"If you want your share of the room, I want mine. Don't you understand?\"  \"I am not interfering, dearest,\" called back Kathleen, \"and I am keeping religiously to my own half. I have the straight window, and you have the bay. I am not touching your beautiful half; I am only in mine.\"  \"Let me in,\" called Alice again, \"and don't be silly.\"  \"Sorry, dear; don't think I am silly.\"  There was a silence. Alice went on her knees and peered through the keyhole: Kathleen was seated by her dressing-table, and there was a sound of the furious scratching of a pen quite audible. \"This is intolerable,\" thought Alice. \"She is the most awful girl I ever heard of. I shall be late. Mary Addersley and Rhoda Pierpont are to call for me shortly, and I shan't be ready. I don't want to appeal to mother or to be rude to the poor wild thing the first day. Stay, I will tempt her.--Kathleen!\"  \"Yes, darling.\"  \"Wouldn't you like to come with me to Cassandra Weldon's? She is so nice, and so is her mother. She plays beautifully, and they will sing.\"  \"Irish songs?\" called out Kathleen.  \"I don't know. Perhaps they will if you ask them.\"  \"Thanks,\" replied Kathleen; \"I am not going.\" Again there was silence, and the scratching of the pen continued. Alice was now obliged to go downstairs to acquaint her mother.  \"What is it, dear? Why, my dear Alice, how excited you look!\"  \"I have cause to be, mother. I have come in rather late, very much fagged out from a day of hard examination work and that imp--that horrid girl--has locked me out of my bedroom. I was so looking forward to a nice little supper with Cassandra and the other girls! Kathleen won't let me in; she really is intolerable. I can't stay in the room with her any longer; she is past bearing. Can't you give me an attic to myself at the top of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],["title","The Rebel of the School (#8)"],["body","use?\"  \"You know I haven't a corner.\"  \"Can't I share your bed, mummy? I shall be so miserable with that dreadful Kathleen.\"  \"You know quite well, Alice, that that is the only really good bedroom in the house, and I can't afford to give it to one girl by herself. I think Kathleen will be all right when we really get to know her; but she is very undisciplined. Still, three guineas a week makes an immense difference to me, Alice. I can't help telling you so, my child.\"  \"In my opinion, it is hardly earned,\" said Alice. \"I suppose I must stay down here and give up my supper. I can't go like this, all untidy, and my hair so messy, and my collar--oh, mother, it is nearly black! It is really too trying.\"  \"I will go up and see if I can persuade her,\" said Mrs. Tennant.  She went upstairs, turned the handle of the door, and spoke. The moment her voice penetrated to Kathleen's ears, she jumped to her feet, crossed the room, and bent down at the other side of the keyhole.  \"Don't tire your dear voice,\" she said. \"What is it you want?\"  \"I want you to open the door, Kathleen. Poor Alice wants to get in to get her clothes. It is her room as much as yours. Let her in at once, my dear.\"  \"I am very sorry, darling Mrs. Tennant, but I am privately engaged in my own half of the room. I am not interfering with Alice's.\"  \"But you see, Kathleen, she can't get to her half.\"  \"The door is in my half, you know,\" said Kathleen very meekly, \"so I don't see that she has any cause to complain. I am awfully sorry; I will be as quick as I can.\"  \"You annoy me very much. You make me very uncomfortable by going on in this extremely silly way, Kathleen.\"  \"I will darn some more socks for you, darling, tired pet,\" whispered Kathleen coaxingly. \"I really am awfully sorry, but there is no help for it. I must finish my own private affairs in my own half of the room.\"  She retreated from the door, and the scratching of the pen continued.  Alice downstairs felt like a caged lion. Mrs. Tennant admitted that Kathleen's conduct was very bad.  \"It won't happen again, Alice,\" she said, \"for I shall remove the key from the lock. She won't shut you out another time. Make the best of it, darling. If we don't worry her too much she is sure to capitulate.\"  \"Not she. She is a perfect horror,\" said Alice.  Mrs. Weldon's supper party was to begin at eight o'clock. It was now seven, and the girls were to call for Alice at half-past. If Kathleen would only be quick she might still have time.  The boys came in. They stared open-eyed at Alice when they saw her still sitting in her rough school things, a very cross expression on her face. David came up to her at once; he was the favorite, and people said he had a way with him. Whatever they meant by that, most people did what David Tennant liked. He stood in front of his sister now and said:  \"What's the matter? And where's the little Irish beauty?\"  \"For goodness' sake don't speak about her,\" said Alice. \"She's driving me nearly mad.\"  \"Your sister is naturally much annoyed, David,\" said his mother. \"Kathleen is evidently a very tiresome girl. She has locked the door of their mutual bedroom, and declines to open it; she says that as the door happens to be in her half of the room, she has perfect control over it.\"  David whistled. Ben burst out laughing.  \"Well, now that is Irish,\" David said.  \"If you take her part I shall hate you all the rest of my life,\" said Alice, speaking with great passion.  \"But can't you wait just for once?\" asked David. \"Any one could tell she is just trying it on. She'll get tired of sitting there by herself if only you have patience.\"  \"But I am due at Cassandra's for supper\" and Mary Addersley and Rhoda Pierpont are to call for me at half-past seven.\"  \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said David.--\"Ben, leave off teasing.\" For Ben was whistling and jumping about, and making the most expressive faces at poor Alice,--\"I will see what I can do,\" he said, and he ran upstairs. David was very musical; indeed, the soul of music dwelt in his eyes, in his voice, in his very step. He might in some respects have been an Irish boy himself. He bent down now and whistled very softly, and in the most flute-like manner, \"Garry Owen\" through the keyhole. There was a restless sound in the room, and then a cross voice said:  \"Go away.\"  David stopped whistling \"Garry Owen,\" and proceeded to execute a most exquisite performance of \"St. Patrick's Day in the Morning.\" Kathleen trembled. Her eyes filled with tears. David was now whistling right into her room \"The Wearing of the Green.\" Kathleen flung down her pen, making a splash on the paper.  \"Go away,\" she called out. \"What are you doing there?\"  \"The outside of this door doesn't belong to you,\" called David, \"and if I like to whistle through the keyhole you can't prevent me;\" and he began \"Garry Owen\" again.  Kathleen rushed to the door and flung it open. The tears were still wet on her cheeks.  \"Can't you guess what you are doing?\" she said. \"You are stabbing me--stabbing me. Oh! oh! oh!\" and she burst into violent sobs. David took her hand.  \"Come, little Irish colleen,\" he said. \"Come along downstairs. I am going to be chummy with you. Don't be so lonely. Give Alice her room; one-half of it is hers, and she wants to dress to go out.\"  \"Let her take it all,\" sobbed Kathleen. \"I am most miserable. Oh, Garry Owen, Garry Owen! Oh, Land of the Shamrock! Oh, my broken heart!\"  She laid her head on David's shoulder and went on sobbing. David felt quite bashful. There was nothing for it but to take out his big and not too clean handkerchief and wipe her tears away.  \"Whisper,\" he said in her ear. \"There are stables at the back of the house; they are old, worn-out stables. There is a loft over one, and I keep apples and nuts there. It's the jolliest place. Will you and I go there for an hour or two after supper?\"  \"Do you mean it?\" said Kathleen, her eyes filling with laughter, and the tears still wet on her cheeks.  \"Yes, colleen, I mean it, for I want you to tell me all you can about your land of the shamrock.\"  \"Why, then, that I will,\" she replied. \"Wisha, then, David, it's a broth of a boy, you are!\" and she kissed him on his forehead. David took her hand and led her into the dining-room. Alice was still there, looking more stormy than ever.  \"It's too late now,\" she said; \"the girls have come and gone. I can't go at all now.\"  \"But why, darling?\" said Kathleen. \"Oh! I wish I had let you in.--She must go, David, the poor dear. It would be cruel to disappoint her.--What dress will you wear?\" said Kathleen.  \"Let me alone,\" said Alice.  She rushed upstairs, but Kathleen was even quicker.  \"I'm not going to be nasty to you any more,\" she said. \"I have found a friend, and I shall have more friends to-morrow. Kathleen O'Hara would have died long ago but for her friends. I shall be happy when I have got a creelful of them here. Now then, let me help you. No, that isn't the shoe you want; here it is. And gloves--here's a pair, and they're neatly mended. Which hat did you say--the one with the blue scarf round it? Isn't it a pretty one? You put that on. Aunt Katie O'Flynn is going to send me a box of clothes from Dublin, and I will give you some of them. You mustn't say no; I will give you some if you are nice. I am ever so sorry that I kept you out of your part of the room; I won't do it any more. Now you are dressed; that's fine. You won't hate me forever, will you?\"  Alice growled something in reply. She had not Kathleen's passionate, quick, impulsive nature--furious with rage one minute, sweet and gentle and affectionate the next. She hated Kathleen for having humiliated and annoyed her; and she went off to Cassandra's house knowing that she would be late, and determined not to say one good word for Kathleen.     CHAPTER V.  WIT AND GENIUS: THE PLAN PROPOUNDED.   While Kathleen was locked in Alice's room, she was writing to her father:       \"MY DARLING DADDY.--If ever there was a cold, dreary,      abominable land, it is this where they wave the British flag.      The ugliness of it would make you sick. The people are as ugly      as the country, and they're so stiff and stuck-up. If you      suppose for a moment that your wild Irish girl can stand much      of this sort of thing, you are fine and mistaken, and you can      tell the mother so. I mean to write to Aunt Katie O'Flynn      to-morrow and give her a fine piece of my mind. Early in the      day, dad, I did not think that I could stay at all; but I have      got a plan in my head now, and if I succeed I may at least put      up with one term of this detestable school. I won't tell you      the plan, for you mightn't approve; in fact, I can guess in      advance that you wouldn't approve. Anyhow, it is going to      occupy the time and thoughts of your Kathleen. Now I want a      good bit of money; not a pound or even five pounds, but more      than that. Can you send me a ten-pound note, daddy mine, and      say nothing whatever about it to the mother or the retainers      at Carrigrohane? And can you let me have it as quick as quick      can be? Maybe I will want more before the term is up, or maybe      I won't. Anyhow, we will let that lie in the future. Oh, my      broth of an old dad, wouldn't I like to hug you this blessed      minute? How is everybody at home? How are the mountains? How      is the sea? How is the trout-stream? Are those young cousins      of mine behaving themselves, the spalpeens? And how are you,      my heart of hearts--missing your Kathleen, I doubt not? Well,      no more for the present. They're rattling at the door like      anything, and there's a detestable boy now whistling 'Garry      Owen' right into my heart. You can't imagine what I am      feeling. Oh, the omadhaun! he is changing it now into 'St.      Patrick's Day,' Wisha, then, daddy! I must stop, for it's more      than the heart of woman can stand. Your affectionate daughter,       \"KATHLEEN.\"  This letter"]]]
