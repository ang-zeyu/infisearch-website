Athens was the center of this intellectual activity.  In this century arose the Sophists, public teachers who busied themselves with all departments of human knowledge, but seemed to lay no little emphasis upon certain questions that touched very nearly the life of man.  Can man attain to truth at all--to a truth that is more than a mere truth to him, a seeming truth?  Whence do the laws derive their authority?  Is there such a thing as justice, as right?  It was with such questions as these that the Sophists occupied themselves, and such questions as these have held the attention of mankind ever since. When they make their appearance in the life of a people or of an individual man, it means that there has been a rebirth, a birth into the life of reflection.  When Socrates, that greatest of teachers, felt called upon to refute the arguments of these men, he met them, so to speak, on their own ground, recognizing that the subjects of which they discoursed were, indeed, matter for scientific investigation.  His attitude seemed to many conservative persons in his day a dangerous one; he was regarded as an innovator; he taught men to think and to raise questions where, before, the traditions of the fathers had seemed a sufficient guide to men's actions.  And, indeed, he could not do otherwise.  Men had learned to reflect, and there had come into existence at least the beginnings of what we now sometimes rather loosely call the mental and moral sciences.  In the works of Socrates' disciple Plato (428-347 B.C.) and in those of Plato's disciple Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), abundant justice is done to these fields of human activity.  These two, the greatest among the Greek philosophers, differ from each other in many things, but it is worthy of remark that they both seem to regard the whole sphere of human knowledge as their province.  Plato is much more interested in the moral sciences than in the physical, but he, nevertheless, feels called upon to give an account of how the world was made and out of what sort of elements.  He evidently does not take his own account very seriously, and recognizes that he is on uncertain ground.  But he does not consider the matter beyond his jurisdiction.  As for Aristotle, that wonderful man seems to have found it possible to represent worthily every science known to his time, and to have marked out several new fields for his successors to cultivate.  His philosophy covers physics, cosmology, zoölogy, logic, metaphysics, ethics, psychology, politics and economics, rhetoric and poetics.  Thus we see that the task of the philosopher was much the same at the period of the highest development of the Greek philosophy that it had been earlier.  He was supposed to give an account of the system of things.  But the notion of what it means to give an account of the system of things had necessarily undergone some change.  The philosopher had to be something more than a natural philosopher.  3. PHILOSOPHY AS A GUIDE TO LIFE.--At the close of the fourth century before Christ there arose the schools of the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Skeptics.  In them we seem to find a somewhat new conception of philosophy--philosophy appears as chiefly a guide to life.  The Stoic emphasizes the necessity of living \"according to nature,\" and dwells upon the character of the wise man; the Epicurean furnishes certain selfish maxims for getting through life as pleasantly as possible; the Skeptic counsels apathy, an indifference to all things,--blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.  And yet, when we examine more closely these systems, we find a conception of philosophy not really so very different from that which had obtained before.  We do not find, it is true, that disinterested passion for the attainment of truth which is the glory of science.  Man seems quite too much concerned with the problem of his own happiness or unhappiness; he has grown morbid.  Nevertheless, the practical maxims which obtain in each of these systems are based upon a certain view of the system of things as a whole.  The Stoic tells us of what the world consists; what was the beginning and what will be the end of things; what is the relation of the system of things to God.  He develops a physics and a logic as well as a system of ethics.  The Epicurean informs us that the world originated in a rain of atoms through space; he examines into the foundations of human knowledge; and he proceeds to make himself comfortable in a world from which he has removed those disturbing elements, the gods.  The Skeptic decides that there is no such thing as truth, before he enunciates the dogma that it is not worth while to worry about anything.  The philosophy of each school includes a view of the system of things as a whole.  The philosopher still regarded the universe of knowledge as his province.  4. PHILOSOPHY IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--I cannot do more than mention Neo-Platonism, that half Greek and half Oriental system of doctrine which arose in the third century after Christ, the first system of importance after the schools mentioned above.  But I must not pass it by without pointing out that the Neo-Platonic philosopher undertook to give an account of the origin, development, and end of the whole system of things.  In the Middle Ages there gradually grew up rather a sharp distinction between those things that can be known through the unaided reason and those things that can only be known through a supernatural revelation. The term \"philosophy\" came to be synonymous with knowledge attained by the natural light of reason.  This seems to imply some sort of a limitation to the task of the philosopher.  Philosophy is not synonymous with all knowledge.  But we must not forget to take note of the fact that philosophy, even with this limitation, constitutes a pretty wide field.  It covers both the physical and the moral sciences.  Nor should we omit to notice that the scholastic philosopher was at the same time a theologian.  Albert the Great and St. Thomas Aquinas, the famous scholastics of the thirteenth century, had to write a \"_Summa Theologiae_,\" or system of theology, as well as to treat of the other departments of human knowledge.  Why were these men not overwhelmed with the task set them by the tradition of their time?  It was because the task was not, after all, so great as a modern man might conceive it to be.  Gil Blas, in Le Sage's famous romance, finds it possible to become a skilled physician in the twinkling of an eye, when Dr. Sangrado has imparted to him the secret that the remedy for all diseases is to be found in bleeding the patient and in making him drink copiously of hot water.  When little is known about things, it does not seem impossible for one man to learn that little.  During the Middle Ages and the centuries preceding, the physical sciences had a long sleep.  Men were much more concerned in the thirteenth century to find out what Aristotle had said than they were to address questions to nature.  The special sciences, as we now know them, had not been called into existence.  5. THE MODERN PHILOSOPHY.--The submission of men's minds to the authority of Aristotle and of the church gradually gave way.  A revival of learning set in.  Men turned first of all to a more independent choice of authorities, and then rose to the conception of a philosophy independent of authority, of a science based upon an observation of nature, of a science at first hand.  The special sciences came into being.  But the old tradition of philosophy as universal knowledge remained. If we pass over the men of the transition period and turn our attention to Francis Bacon (1561-1626) and Rene Descartes (1596-1650), the two who are commonly regarded as heading the list of the modern philosophers, we find both of them assigning to the philosopher an almost unlimited field.  Bacon holds that philosophy has for its objects God, man, and nature, and he regards it as within his province to treat of \"_philosophia prima_\" (a sort of metaphysics, though he does not call it by this name), of logic, of physics and astronomy, of anthropology, in which he includes psychology, of ethics, and of politics.  In short, he attempts to map out the whole field of human knowledge, and to tell those who work in this corner of it or in that how they should set about their task.  As for Descartes, he writes of the trustworthiness of human knowledge, of the existence of God, of the existence of an external world, of the human soul and its nature, of mathematics, physics, cosmology, physiology, and, in short, of nearly everything discussed by the men of his day.  No man can accuse this extraordinary Frenchman of a lack of appreciation of the special sciences which were growing up.  No one in his time had a better right to be called a scientist in the modern sense of the term.  But it was not enough for him to be a mere mathematician, or even a worker in the physical sciences generally.  He must be all that has been mentioned above.  The conception of philosophy as of a something that embraces all departments of human knowledge has not wholly passed away even in our day.  I shall not dwell upon Spinoza (1632-1677), who believed it possible to deduce a world _a priori_ with mathematical precision; upon Christian Wolff (1679-1754), who defined philosophy as the knowledge of the causes of what is or comes into being; upon Fichte (1762-1814), who believed that the philosopher, by mere thinking, could lay down the laws of all possible future experience; upon Schelling (1775-1854), who, without knowing anything worth mentioning about natural science, had the courage to develop a system of natural philosophy, and to condemn such investigators as Boyle and Newton; upon Hegel (1770-1831), who undertakes to construct the whole system of reality out of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16406"],["title","An Introduction to Philosophy (#3)"],["body","epts, and who, with his immediate predecessors, brought philosophy for a while into more or less disrepute with men of a scientific turn of mind.  I shall come down quite to our own times, and consider a man whose conception of philosophy has had and still has a good deal of influence, especially with the general public--with those to whom philosophy is a thing to be taken up in moments of leisure, and cannot be the serious pursuit of a life.  \"Knowledge of the lowest kind,\" says Herbert Spencer, \"is _un-unified_ knowledge; Science is _partially-unified_ knowledge; Philosophy is _completely-unified_ knowledge.\" [1]  Science, he argues, means merely the family of the Sciences--stands for nothing more than the sum of knowledge formed of their contributions.  Philosophy is the fusion of these contributions into a whole; it is knowledge of the greatest generality.  In harmony with this notion Spencer produced a system of philosophy which includes the following: A volume entitled \"First Principles,\" which undertakes to show what man can and what man cannot know; a treatise on the principles of biology; another on the principles of psychology; still another on the principles of sociology; and finally one on the principles of morality.  To complete the scheme it would have been necessary to give an account of inorganic nature before going on to the phenomena of life, but our philosopher found the task too great and left this out.  Now, Spencer was a man of genius, and one finds in his works many illuminating thoughts.  But it is worthy of remark that those who praise his work in this or in that field are almost always men who have themselves worked in some other field and have an imperfect acquaintance with the particular field that they happen to be praising. The metaphysician finds the reasonings of the \"First Principles\" rather loose and inconclusive; the biologist pays little heed to the \"Principles of Biology\"; the sociologist finds Spencer not particularly accurate or careful in the field of his predilection.  He has tried to be a professor of all the sciences, and it is too late in the world's history for him or for any man to cope with such a task.  In the days of Plato a man might have hoped to accomplish it.  6. WHAT PHILOSOPHY MEANS IN OUR TIME.--It savors of temerity to write down such a title as that which heads the present section.  There are men living to-day to whom philosophy means little else than the doctrine of Kant, or of Hegel, or of the brothers Caird, or of Herbert Spencer, or even of St. Thomas Aquinas, for we must not forget that many of the seminaries of learning in Europe and some in America still hold to the mediaeval church philosophy.  But let me gather up in a few words the purport of what has been said above.  Philosophy once meant the whole body of scientific knowledge. Afterward it came to mean the whole body of knowledge which could be attained by the mere light of human reason, unaided by revelation.  The several special sciences sprang up, and a multitude of men have for a long time past devoted themselves to definite limited fields of investigation with little attention to what has been done in other fields.  Nevertheless, there has persisted the notion of a discipline which somehow concerns itself with the whole system of things, rather than with any limited division of that broad field.  It is a notion not peculiar to the disciples of Spencer.  There are many to whom philosophy is a \"_Weltweisheit_,\" a world-wisdom.  Shall we say that this is the meaning of the word philosophy now?  And if we do, how shall we draw a line between philosophy and the body of the special sciences?  Perhaps the most just way to get a preliminary idea of what philosophy means to the men of our time is to turn away for the time being from the definition of any one man or group of men, and to ask ourselves what a professor of philosophy in an American or European university is actually supposed to teach.  It is quite clear that he is not supposed to be an Aristotle.  He does not represent all the sciences, and no one expects him to lecture on mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, zoölogy, botany, economics, politics, and various other disciplines.  There was a time when he might have been expected to teach all that men could know, but that time is long past.  Nevertheless, there is quite a group of sciences which are regarded as belonging especially to his province; and although a man may devote a large part of his attention to some one portion of the field, he would certainly be thought remiss if he wholly neglected the rest.  This group of sciences includes logic, psychology, ethics and aesthetics, metaphysics, and the history of philosophy.  I have not included epistemology or the \"theory of knowledge\" as a separate discipline, for reasons which will appear later (Chapter XIX); and I have included the history of philosophy, because, whether we care to call this a special science or not, it constitutes a very important part of the work of the teacher of philosophy in our day.  Of this group of subjects the student who goes to the university to study philosophy is supposed to know something before he leaves its walls, whatever else he may or may not know.  It should be remarked, again, that there is commonly supposed to be a peculiarly close relation between philosophy and religion.  Certainly, if any one about a university undertakes to give a course of lectures on theism, it is much more apt to be the professor of philosophy than the professor of mathematics or of chemistry.  The man who has written an \"Introduction to Philosophy,\" a \"Psychology,\" a \"Logic,\" and an \"Outlines of Metaphysics\" is very apt to regard it as his duty to add to the list a \"Philosophy of Religion.\"  The students in the theological seminaries of Europe and America are usually encouraged, if not compelled, to attend courses in philosophy.  Finally, it appears to be definitely accepted that even the disciplines that we never think of classing among the philosophical sciences are not wholly cut off from a connection with philosophy.  When we are occupied, not with adding to the stock of knowledge embraced within the sphere of any special science, but with an examination of the methods of the science, with, so to speak, a criticism of the foundations upon which the science rests, our work is generally recognized as philosophical.  It strikes no one as odd in our day that there should be established a \"Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods,\" but we should think it strange if some one announced the intention to publish a \"Journal of Philosophy and Comparative Anatomy.\" It is not without its significance that, when Mach, who had been professor of physics at Prague, was called (in 1895) to the University of Vienna to lecture on the history and theory of the inductive sciences, he was made, not professor of physics, but professor of philosophy.  The case, then, stands thus: a certain group of disciplines is regarded as falling peculiarly within the province of the professor of philosophy, and the sciences which constitute it are frequently called the philosophical sciences; moreover, it is regarded as quite proper that the teacher of philosophy should concern himself with the problems of religion, and should pry into the methods and fundamental assumptions of special sciences in all of which it is impossible that he should be an adept.  The question naturally arises: Why has his task come to be circumscribed as it is?  Why should he teach just these things and no others?  To this question certain persons are at once ready to give an answer. There was a time, they argue, when it seemed possible for one man to embrace the whole field of human knowledge.  But human knowledge grew; the special sciences were born; each concerned itself with a definite class of facts and developed its own methods.  It became possible and necessary for a man to be, not a scientist at large, but a chemist, a physicist, a biologist, an economist.  But in certain portions of the great field men have met with peculiar difficulties; here it cannot be said that we have sciences, but rather that we have attempts at science.  The philosopher is the man to whom is committed what is left when we have taken away what has been definitely established or is undergoing investigation according to approved scientific methods.  He is Lord of the Uncleared Ground, and may wander through it in his compassless, irresponsible way, never feeling that he is lost, for he has never had any definite bearings to lose.  Those who argue in this way support their case by pointing to the lack of a general consensus of opinion which obtains in many parts of the field which the philosopher regards as his own; and also by pointing out that, even within this field, there is a growing tendency on the part of certain sciences to separate themselves from philosophy and become independent.  Thus the psychologist and the logician are sometimes very anxious to have it understood that they belong among the scientists and not among the philosophers.  Now, this answer to the question that we have raised undoubtedly contains some truth.  As we have seen from the sketch contained in the preceding pages, the word philosophy was once a synonym for the whole sum of the sciences or what stood for such; gradually the several sciences have become independent and the field of the philosopher has been circumscribed.  We must admit, moreover, that there is to be found in a number of the special sciences a body of accepted facts which is without its analogue in philosophy.  In much of his work the philosopher certainly seems to be walking upon more uncertain ground than his neighbors; and if he is unaware of that fact, it must be either because he has not a very nice sense of what constitutes scientific evidence, or because he is carried away by his enthusiasm for some particular form"]]]
