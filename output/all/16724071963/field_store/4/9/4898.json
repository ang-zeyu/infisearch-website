No doubt he had joined his friends in their compartment, and the moment seemed opportune to visit his. It was next to mine, and the door stood invitingly open. A few minutes, seconds even, would be enough to tell me something of his identity, perhaps all I wanted to.  At least he made no pretence at mystery; his light baggage lay about, a dressing bag, a roll of rugs, a couple of sticks and an umbrella strapped together, all very neat and precise and respectable, and all alike furnished with a parchment tag or label bearing in plain language all that I wanted to know.  His name was printed \"Lieut.-Col. Basil Annesley,\" and his club, the Mars and Neptune, that famous military house in Piccadilly. Underneath, on all, his destination was written, \"Hotel Bellevue, Bellagio, Como.\" There could never be the least difficulty in finding this person if I wanted him, as I thought likely. He was a blustering, swashbuckling army officer, who could always be brought to account if he misconducted himself, or mixed himself up in shady transactions.  In my great contentment at the discovery I had been wanting in caution, and I lingered too long on forbidden ground.  \"You infernal scoundrel,\" cried some one from the door, and once more I felt an angry hand on my shoulder. \"How come you here? Explain yourself.\"  \"It's all a mistake,\" I began, trying to make the best of it, struggling to get free. But he still held me in a grip of iron, and it was not until my friend Jules appeared that I got out of the enemy's clutches.  \"Here, I say!\" shouted Jules vaguely. \"This won't do, you know. I shall have to lodge a complaint against you for brawling.\"  \"Complaint, by George!\" he replied, shaking his fist at me. \"The boot is on the other leg, I take it. How is it that I find this chap in my compartment? Foraging about, I believe.\"  \"Indeed no, Colonel Annesley,\" I protested, forgetting myself; and he caught at it directly.  \"Oho, so you know my name! That proves what I say. You've been messing about and overhauling my things. I won't stand it. The man's a thief. He will have to be locked up.\"  \"I'm not the only thief in the car, then,\" I cried, for I was now mad with him and his threats.  \"I don't know what you're driving at, or whom you think to accuse; but I tell you this, my friend, that I shall call in the police at the next station and hand you over.\"  I looked at the conductor Jules, appealing for protection. I saw at once that it would be terrible for me to have any trouble with the police. They could do me no harm, but I might be delayed, obliged to leave the train, and I should lose sight of the lady, possibly fail altogether.  Jules responded at once. \"Come, come,\" he said. \"You're talking big. You might own the whole train. Who might you be?\"  \"None of your confounded impudence,\" shouted the Colonel, as he pointed to one of the luggage labels. \"That's who I am. It's good enough to get you discharged before you're a much older man. And now I call upon you to do your duty. I have caught this man under suspicious circumstances in the very act of rifling my effects. I insist upon his being taken into custody.\"  \"There isn't enough for that,\" Jules answered, still my friend, but weakening a little before this masterly army officer, and I felt that I must speak for myself.  \"And if you stop me I will have the law of you for false imprisonment, and bring heavy damages. You will be doing me a great injury in my business.\"  \"Precisely what I should like to do, my fine fellow. I can guess what your business is. Nothing reputable, I feel sure.\"  \"I'm not ashamed of it, and I have powerful friends behind me. I am acting for--\"  \"Yes?\" he asked me mockingly, for I had checked my tongue, fearing to say too much.  \"It is my affair. Enough that you will feel the weight of their hands if you interfere with me in carrying out their instructions.\"  \"Well, anyhow, tell me who you are. I've a right to know that in exchange. You chose to help yourself to my name; now I insist upon knowing yours.\"  I told him, not very readily, as may be supposed.  \"Domenico Falfani? Is that your own or a 'purser's' name? Come, you know what I mean. It's part of your stock in trade to understand all languages, including slang. Is that the name he has given you?\"--this to the conductor. \"Show me your way-bill, your _feuille de route_.\"  Jules at a nod from me produced it, and no doubt understood my reason when in my turn I claimed to see it.  \"I have a clear right,\" I insisted, overruling all objections raised by the Colonel; and taking it into my hands I read the names aloud, \"Colonel Annesley, Mrs. Blair, maid and child.\" I pronounced the name with great contempt.  \"You talk of purser's names,\" I said sneeringly. \"What do you think of this? Blair, indeed! No more the woman's name than Smith or Jones, or what you please.\"  \"Speak more respectfully of a lady,\" cried the Colonel, catching me tightly by the arm.  \"Lady? Oho! Don't, Colonel, drop it. At any rate, she is not Mrs. Blair; you may take that from me,\" I said as impressively as a judge on the bench. \"And what's more, Colonel, I wouldn't press charges you can't substantiate against me, or I may hit back with another not so easy to meet. Try to stop me at the next station, and I'll stop your pal--ah, don't\"--he had a cruelly strong hand--\"your Mrs. Blair, and she'll find herself in a particularly tight place.\"  \"We'll see about that,\" said the Colonel, who kept a stiff face, but was, I think, rather crestfallen. \"I shall act as I think best. Anyhow, get out of this, both of you. This is my private berth, and you are trespassing.\"     CHAPTER VII.   Whatever may have been the Colonel's intentions when he caught me in his compartment, something, and I think my last words, led him to modify them. He felt, probably, that if he attacked me I might retaliate unpleasantly. I ought to be able to hold my own with him, although in truth I was not over happy at the course events had taken, and I could not compliment myself on my good management.  I had not been overprudent; I had pressed my attentions on him rather abruptly, although I had the excuse that I usually found them well received, thanks to my affable address; again I had behaved most incautiously in penetrating his identity.  And, worse than all, I had still no certainty. I could only surmise that the lady was the one I was in search of, for I had not as yet clapt eyes on her, and I had been to some extent driven to show my hand before I had made my ground good. So the first thing I did on regaining my own compartment was to ring for Jules, the conductor, and put before him the photograph with which I was provided, and ask him if he recognized it.  \"But perfectly. It is the lady yonder,\" he said promptly. \"Is it your own, or did you find it or annex it from next door? Ah, your own; and what have you to do with her?\"  \"I may tell you some day, Jules. For the present you must know that I am after her; I have to watch her, stick to her like her shadow until it is time to act.\"  \"An adventuress, eh?\"  \"She is in possession of what does not belong to her; something she abstracted from--from--Never mind where, and it must be recovered from her here, or after she leaves the car.\"  \"Afterwards, please. We can't have any scandal on board here.\"  \"Five hundred francs wouldn't tempt you to let me have a free hand for just half an hour? I could do it, say somewhere short of Basle, and on reaching there make off. No one should be any the wiser, and they, the women, wouldn't dare to make a fuss.\"  \"It's I who do not dare--not for twice five hundred francs. My place is worth more than that; and if it is a dog's life, it is better than lying on the straw. Besides, there's her friend the Colonel, he'll be on the alert, you may depend.\"  \"So must I be, and I must find some way to circumvent him. I'll be even with him. He sha'n't beat me, the overbearing, hectoring brute. It's between him and me, and I think I'm a match for him.\"  I spoke this confidently to my friend, who engaged for his part to do all in his power to assist, or at least to do nothing against me, and I was content to bide my time. Pride goes before a fall. I was not as clever as I thought, and shall have to tell you how seriously I had underrated his worth in the coming trial of strength.  As the train sped on and the night began to close in on us, I remained quietly in my berth, pondering over my position, and in considering the course I should adopt under various contingencies. The first and most serious danger was that the lady should succeed in leaving the train at any of the intermediate stations at Basle, and so give me the slip. There were Laon, Rheims, Chaumont, and the rest.  It must be my business to keep close watch against any evasion of this kind, and Jules had promised to help. I did not look for any such attempt until far into the night, when the stations were empty and half-dark, and I agreed with Jules to divide the hours till daylight, he taking the first, I the last. We were due at Basle at 5 A.M., and I expected to join forces then with Tiler, my colleague, coming from the side of Ostend, via Brussels and Strasburg.  Meanwhile I kept quiet and made no sign beyond showing that I was there and on the spot ready to act if it should be necessary. Thus, when the train slackened speed on approaching a station, I was always on the move and the first to descend and patrol the platform. The Colonel always got out too, but he never accosted me; indeed, he seemed disposed to despise me, to ignore my existence, or dare me to the worst I could do.  I suppose the lady must have been of the same mind, for when dinner-time arrived, she came boldly out of her compartment, and I met her face to face for the first time, on her way to the restaurant. I was standing at the door of my compartment.  \"Dinner is ready,\" the Colonel said to me"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16339"],["title","The Passenger from Calais (#6)"],["body","ly, but I did not choose to understand, and shook my head, holding my ground.  \"You are coming to dinner, I think,\" he repeated in a sharp commanding way, as if he were talking to his soldiers.  \"I shall please myself about that,\" I replied gruffly.  \"Not a bit of it. One moment,\" he whispered to the lady, who walked on, and turned again to me: \"Now see here, my friend, I do not mean to leave you behind. You will come to the dining-car with us, and no two ways about it, even if I have to carry you.\"  \"I won't dine with you,\" I cried.  \"I never asked you to dine with me, but you shall dine when I do. I will pay for your dinner, but I wouldn't sit at table with you for worlds,\" he shouted with scornful laughter. \"You're going to dine under my eye, that's all, even though the sight of you is enough to make one sick. So come along, sharp's the word, see? Walk first; let him pass you, Mrs. Blair.\"  I felt I had no choice. He was capable of again assaulting me. There was something in his manner that cowed me, and I was obliged in spite of myself to give way.  There were only three of us in the dining-car, and we were not a very merry company. Our tables were laid almost adjoining, and there was no conversation between us, except when the Colonel asked me with contemptuous civility what wine I preferred. He did not talk to the lady, or the merest commonplaces, for I was within earshot. But I made an excellent dinner, I must confess. I had eaten nothing since Amiens. Then I got back to my berth, where the bed was made. I threw myself on to it, rejoiced at the prospect of getting a few hours' sleep while Jules remained on the watch.  He was to call me a little before reaching Basle, and, like an ass that I was, I fully relied on his doing so, believing him to be my friend. Such friendship as his did not bear any great strain, as I learnt presently to my great chagrin.  I slept heavily, but in fitful snatches, as a man does when constantly disturbed by the whirr and whizzing of the train, the rattle and jangle of wheels passing over ill-jointed points. After one of the longest periods of unconsciousness I awoke, aroused by the complete absence of noise. The train was at a standstill in some station and making a very protracted halt.  Something moved me to lift the blind and look out, and I saw, not without uneasiness, that we were at Basle. I thought I recognized the station, but I soon made out for certain the name \"Basilea\" (Basle), and saw the clock with the fingers at five-thirty. People were already on the move, work-people, the thrifty, industrious Swiss, forestalling time, travellers in twos and threes arriving and departing by the early train through this great junction on the frontier of Switzerland.  Stay! What? Who are those crossing the platform hurriedly. Great powers! Right under my eyes, a little party of four, two females, two men accompanying them, escorting them, carrying rugs and parcels. There could not be a shadow of doubt.  It was the lady, the so-called Mrs. Blair, in full flight, with all her belongings, and under the care and guidance not only of the Colonel, that of course, but also of the perfidious Jules l'Echelle. He had sold me! All doubt of his treachery disappeared when on rushing to the door I found I had been locked into my compartment.  I rang the electric bell frantically, again and again. I got no answer; I threw up the window and thrust my head out, shouting for help, but got none, only one or two sluggish porters came up and asked what was amiss, answering stolidly, when they heard, that it was none of their business. \"They had no key, it must be a mistake. The conductor would explain, I must wait till he came.\"  Presently Jules arrived, walking very leisurely from the direction of the restaurant, and he stood right under my window with a grin on his face and mockery in his voice.  \"What's wrong? Locked in? Can't be possible? Who could have done it? I will inquire,\" he said slowly and imperturbably.  \"No, no; let me out first. You can do it if you choose. I believe it was your trickery from the first. I must get out, I tell you, or they will escape me,\" I cried.  \"Not unlikely. I may say it is pretty certain they will. That was the Colonel's idea; you'd better talk to him about it next time you see him.\"  \"And that will be never, I expect. He's not going to show up here again.\"  \"There you're wrong; he will be back before the train starts, you may rely on that, and you'll be able to talk to him. We'll let you out then,\" he was laughing at me, traitor that he was. \"Here he comes. We're just going on.\"  Now I saw my last chance of successfully performing my mission disappearing beyond recall. I renewed my shouts and protests, but was only laughed at for my pains. The railway officials at Basle might have interfered, but Jules answered for me, declaring with a significant gesture that I was in drink and that he would see to me.  I quite despaired. Already the train was moving out of the station, when, to my intense joy, I caught sight of Ludovic Tiler, who came down the platform running alongside us, and crying, \"Falfani, Falfani,\" as he recognized me.  \"Don't mind me,\" I shouted to him. \"I must go on, I can't help myself. It's for you to take it up now. She's in the restaurant. You'll easily know her, in a long ulster, with her maid and the child. You can't miss her. By the Lord, she is standing at the door! Get away with you, don't let her see you talking with me. She must not know we are acting in common, and I do hope she hasn't noticed. Be off, I tell you, only let me hear of you; wire to Lucerne what you're doing. Address telegraph-office. Send me a second message at Goeschenen. I shall get one or both. Say where I may answer and where I can join you.\"     CHAPTER VIII.   The timely appearance of my colleague, Ludovic Tiler, consoled me a little for the loss of the lady and her lot. I had failed, myself, but I hoped that with my lead he would get on to the scent and keep to it. Ere long, on the first intimation from him I might come into the game again. I should be guided by his wire if I got it.  For the moment I was most concerned to find out whether Tiler's intervention and my short talk with him had been noticed by the other side. If the Colonel knew that another man was on his friend's track, he would surely have left the train at once so as to go to her assistance. But he was still in the train, I could hear him plainly, speaking to Jules in the next compartment. Again, as we sped on, I reasoned favourably from their leaving me as I was, still under lock and key. No one came near me until after we had passed Olten station, the first stopping-place after Basle, where I could alight and retrace my steps. By holding on to me I guessed that I was still thought to be the chief danger, and that they had no suspicion of Tiler's existence.  I laughed in my sleeve, but not the less did I rage and storm when Jules l'Echelle came with the Colonel to release me.  \"You shall pay for this,\" I cried hotly.  \"As for you, l'Echelle, it shall cost you your place, and I'll take the law of you, Colonel Annesley; I'll get damages and you shall answer for your illegal action.\"  \"Pfui!\" retorted the Colonel. \"The mischief you can do is nothing to what you might have done. We can stand the racket. I've bested you for the present--that's the chief thing, anyway. You can't persecute the poor lady any more.\"  \"Poor lady! Do you know who she is or was, anyway?\"  \"Of course I do,\" he answered bold as brass.  \"Did she let on? Told you, herself? My word! She's got a nerve. I wonder she'd own to it after all she's done.\"  \"Silence!\" he shouted, in a great taking. \"If you dare to utter a single word against that lady, I'll break every bone in your body.\"  \"I'm saying nothing--it's not me, it's all the world. It was in the papers, you must have read them, the most awful story, such--such depravity there never was--such treachery, such gross misconduct.\"  He caught me by the arm so violently and looked so fierce that for a moment I was quite alarmed.  \"Drop it, I tell you. Leave the lady alone, both by word and deed. You'll never find her again, I've seen to that. She has escaped you.\"  \"Aha! You think so? Don't be too cocksure. We understand our business better than that, we don't go into it single-handed. You've collared me for a bit, but I'm not the only one in the show.\"  \"The only one that counts,\" he said sneering.  \"Am I?\" I answered in the same tone. \"What if I had a pal waiting for me at Basle, who received my instructions there--just when you thought you had me safe--and has now taken up the running?\"  He was perfectly staggered at this, I could see plainly. I thought at first he would have struck me, he was so much upset.  \"You infernal villain,\" he shouted, \"I believe the whole thing is a confounded lie! Explain.\"  \"I owe you no explanations,\" I replied stiffly, \"my duty is to my employers. I only account to them for my conduct. I am a confidential agent.\"  He seemed impressed by this, for when he spoke again it was more quietly. But he looked me very straight in the eyes. I felt that he was still likely to give trouble.  \"Well, I suppose I cannot expect you to tell me things. You must go your own way and I shall go mine.\"  \"I should advise you to leave it, Colonel,\" I said, civilly enough. \"I'm always anxious to conciliate and avoid unpleasantness. Give up the whole business; you will only burn your fingers.\"  \"Ah! How so?\"  \"The law is altogether against you. It is a nasty job; better not be mixed up in it. Have you any idea what that woman--that lady,\" I corrected myself, for his eyes flashed, \"has done?\"  \"Nothing really wrong,\" he was warming up into a new burst of passion.  \"Tell that to the Courts and to the Judge when you are prosecuted for contempt and charged as an accessory after the fact. How will you like that? It will take the starch out of you.\"  \"Rot! The law can't do us much"]]]
