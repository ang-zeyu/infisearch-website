In his veins ran blood of that stupid race    Of docile folk, who inhabit the place Called Gosh, sad Gosh, where the tall trees sigh With a strange, significant sort of cry When the gloaming creeps and the wind is high.  When the deep shades creep and the wind is high The trees bow low as the gods ride by:    Gods of the gloaming, who ride on the breeze,    Stooping to heaften the birds and the trees. But each dull Glug sits down by his door, And mutters, \" 'Tis windy!\" and nothing more, Like the long-dead Glugs in the days of yore.  When Sym was born there was much to-do, And his parents thought him a joy to view;    But folk not prejudiced saw the Glug,    As his nurse remarked, \"In the cut of his mug.\" For he had their hair, and he had their eyes, And the Glug expression of pained surprise, And their predilection for pumpkin pies.  And his parents' claims were a deal denied By his maiden aunt on his mother's side,    A tall Glug lady of fifty-two    With a slight moustache of an auburn hue. \"Parental blither!\" she said quite flat. \"He's an average Glug; and he's red and fat! And exceedingly fat and red at that!\"  But the father, joi, when he gazed on Sym, Dreamed great and wonderful things for him.    Said he, \"If the mind of a Glug could wake    Then, Oh, what a wonderful Glug he'd make! We shall teach this laddie to play life's game With a different mind and a definite aim: A Glug in appearance, yet not the same.\"  But the practical aunt said, \"Fudge!  You fool! We'll pack up his dinner and send him to school.    He shall learn about two-times and parsing and capes,    And how to make money with inches on tapes. We'll apprentice him then to the drapery trade, Where, I've heard it reported, large profits are made; Besides, he can sell us cheap buttons and braid.\"  So poor young Sym, he was sent to school, Where the first thing taught is the Golden Rule.    \"Do unto others,\" the teacher said . . .    Then suddenly stopped and scratched his head. \"You may look up the rest in a book,\" said he. \"At present it doesn't occur to me; But do it, whatever it happens to be.\"  \"And now,\" said the teacher, \"the day's task brings Consideration of practical things.    If a man makes a profit of fifteen pounds    On one week's takings from two milk rounds, How many . . .\" And Sym went dreaming away To the sunlit lands where the field-mice play, And wrens hold revel the livelong day.  He walked in the welcoming fields alone, While from far, far away came the pedagogue's drone:    \"If a man makes  . . .Multiply . . . Abstract nouns . . .    From B take   . . .Population of towns . . . Rods, poles or perches . . . Derived from Greek Oh, the hawthorn buds came out this week, And robins are nesting down by the creek.  So Sym was head of his class not once; And his aunt repeatedly dubbed him \"Dunce.\"    But, \"Give him a chance,\" said his father, Joi.    \"His head is abnormally large for a boy.\" But his aunt said, \"Piffie! It's crammed with bosh! Why, he don't know the rivers and mountains of Gosh, Nor the names of the nephews of good King Splosh!\"  In Gosh, when a youth gets an obstinate look, And copies his washing-bill into a book,    And blackens his boot-heels, and frowns at a joke,    \"Ah, he's getting sense,\" say the elderly folk. But Sym, he would laugh when he ought to be sad; Said his aunt, \"Lawk-a-mussy!  What's wrong with the lad?    He romps with the puppies, and talks to the ants,    And keeps his loose change in his second-best pants,    And stumbles all over my cauliflower plants!\"  \"There is wisdom in that,\" laughed the father, Joi. But the aunt said, \"Toity!\" and, \"Drat the boy!\"    \"He shall play,\" said the father, \"some noble part.    Who knows but it may be in letters or art? 'Tis a dignified business to make folk think.\" But the aunt cried, \"What!  Go messing with ink? And smear all his fingers, and take to drink? Paint hussies and cows, and end in the clink?\"  So the argument ran; but one bright Spring day Sym settled it all in his own strange way.    \"'Tis a tramp,\" he announced, \"I've decided to be;    And I start next Monday at twenty to three . . .\" When the aunt recovered she screamed, \"A tramp? A low-lived, pilfering, idle scamp, Who steals people's washing, and sleeps in the damp?\"  Sharp to the hour Sym was ready and dressed. \"Young birds,\" sighed the father, \"must go from the nest.    When the green moss covers those stones you tread,    When the green grass whispers above my head, Mark well, wherever your path may turn, They have reached the valley of peace who learn That wise hearts cherish what fools may spurn.\"  So Sym went off; and a year ran by, And the father said, with a smile-masked sigh,    \"It is meet that the young should leave the nest.\"    Said the aunt, \"Don't spill that soup on your vest! Nor mention his name! He's our one disgrace! And he's probably sneaking around some place With fuzzy black whiskers all over his face.\"  But, under a hedge, by a flowering peach, A youth with a little blue wren held speech.    With his back to a tree and his feet in the grass,    He watched the thistle-down drift and pass, And the cloud-puffs, borne on a lazy breeze, Move by on their errand, above the trees, Into the vault of the mysteries.  \"Now, teach me, little blue wren,\" said he. \"'Tis you can unravel this riddle for me.    I am 'mazed by the gifts of this kindly earth.    Which of them all has the greatest worth?\" He flirted his tail as he answered then, He bobbed and he bowed to his coy little hen: \"Why, sunlight and worms!\" said the little blue wren.    VI.  THE END OF JOI  They climbed the trees . . . As was told before, The Glugs climbed trees in the days of yore,    When the oldes tree in the land to-day    Was a tender little seedling--Nay, This climbing habit was old, so old That even the cheeses could not have told    When the past Glug people first began    To give their lives to the climbing plan.            And the legend ran    That the art was old as the mind of man.   And even the mountains old and hoar, And the billows that broke on Gosh's shore    Since the far-off neolithic night,    All knew the Glugs quite well by sight. And they tell of a perfectly easy way: For yesterday's Glug is the Glug of to-day.    And they climb the trees when the thunder rolls,    To solemnly salve their shop-worn souls.            For they fear the coals    That threaten to frizzle their shop-worn souls.   They climbed the trees. 'Tis a bootless task To say so over again, or ask    The cause of it all, or the reason why    They never felt happier up on high. For Joi asked why; and Joi was a fool, And never a Glug of the fine old school    With fixed opinions and Sunday clothes,    And the habit of looking beyond its nose,            And treating foes    With the calm contempt of the One Who Knows.   And every spider who heaves a line And trusts to his luck when the day is fine,    Or reckless swings from an awful height,    He knows the Glugs quite well by sight. \"You can never mistake them,\" he will say; \"For they always act in a Gluglike way.    And they climb the trees when the glass points fair,    With circumspection and proper care,            For they fear to tear    The very expensive clothes they wear.\"   But Joi was a Glug with a twisted mind Of the nasty, meditative kind.    He'd meditate on the modes of Gosh,    And dared to muse on the acts of Splosh; He dared to speak, and, worse than that, He spoke out loud, and he said it flat.    \"Why climb?\" said he.  \"When you reach the top    There's nowhere to go, and you have to stop,            Unless you drop.    And the higher you are the worse you flop.\"   And every cricket that chirps at eve, And scoffs at the folly of fools who grieve,    And the furtive mice who revel at night,    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. For, \"Why,\" they say, \" in the land of Gosh There is no one else who will bow to Splosh.    And they climb the trees when the rain pelts down    And feeds the gutters that thread the town;            For they fear to drown,    When floods are frothy and waters brown.\"   Said the Glug called Joi, \"This climbing trees Is a foolish art, and things like these    Cause much distress in the land of Gosh.    Let's stay on the ground and kill King Splosh!\" But Splosh, the king, he smiled a smile, And beckoned once to his hangman, Guile,    Who climbed a tree when the weather was calm;    And they hanged poor Joi on a Snufflebust Palm;            Then they sang a psalm,    Did those pious Glugs 'neath the Snufflebust Palm.   And every bee that kisses a flow'r, And every blossom, born for an hour,    And every bird on its gladsome flight,    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. For they say, \"'Tis a simple test we've got: If you know one Glug, why, you know the lot!\"    So, they climbed a tree in the bourgeoning Spring,    And they hanged poor Joi with some second-hand string.            'Tis a horrible thing    To be hanged by Glugs with second-hand string.   Then Splosh, the king, rose up and said, \"It's not polite; but he's safer dead.    And there's not much room in the land of Gosh    For a Glug named Joi and a king called Splosh!\" And every Glug flung high his hat, And cried, \"We're Glugs! and you can't change that!\"    So they climbed the trees, since the weather was cold,    While the brazen bell of the city tolled            And tolled, and told    The fate of a Glug who was over-bold.   And every cloud that sails the blue, And every dancing sunbeam too,    And every sparkling dewdrop bright    All know the Glugs quite well by sight. \"We tell,\" say they, \"by a simple test; For any old Glug is like the rest.    And they climb the trees when there's weather about,    In a general way, as a cure for gout;            Tho' some folks doubt    If the climbing habit is good for gout.\"   So Joi was hanged, and his race was run, And the Glugs were tickled with what"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16362"],["title","The Glugs of Gosh (#3)"],["body","hey'd done.    And, after that, if a day should come    When a Glug felt extra specially glum, He'd call his children around his knee, And tell that tale with a chuckle of glee.    And should a little Glug girl or boy    See naught of a joke in the fate of Joi,            Then he'd employ    Stern measures with such little girl or boy.   But every dawn that paints the sky, And every splendid noontide high,    All know the Glugs so well, so well.    'Tis an easy matter, and plain to tell. For, lacking wit, with a candour smug, A Glug will boast that he is a Glug.    And they climb the trees, if it shines or rains,    To settle the squirming in their brains,            And the darting pains    That are caused by rushing and catching trains.    VII.  THE SWANKS OF GOSH  Come mourn with me for the land of Gosh,    Oh, weep with me for the luckless Glugs Of the land of Gosh, where the sad seas wash The patient shores, and the great King Splosh         His sodden sorrow hugs; Where the fair Queen Tush weeps all the day,    And the Swank, the Swank, the naughty Swank,         The haughty Swank holds sway-- The most mendacious, ostentatious,         Spacious Swank holds sway.  'Tis sorrow-swathed, as I know full well,    And garbed in gloom and the weeds of woe, And vague, so far, is the tale I tell; But bear with me for the briefest spell,         And surely shall ye know Of the land of Gosh, and Tush, and Splosh,    And Stodge, the Swank, the foolish Swank,         The mulish Swank of Gosh- The meretricious, avaricious,         Vicious Swank of Gosh.  Oh, the tall trees bend, and green trees send    A chuckle round the earth, And the soft winds croon a jeering tune,    And the harsh winds shriek with mirth, And the wee small birds chirp ribald words    When the Swank walks down the street; But every Glug takes off his hat, And whispers humbly, \"Look at that!    Hats off! Hats off to the Glug of rank!    Sir Stodge, the Swank, the Lord High Swank!\" Then the East wind roars a loud guffaw, And the haughty Swank says, \"Haw!\"  His brain is dull, and his mind is dense,    And his lack of saving wit complete; But most amazingly immense Is his inane self-confidence         And his innate conceit. But every Glug, and great King Splosh    Bowed to Sir Stodge, the fuddled Swank,         The muddled Swank of Gosh-- The engineering, peeping, peering,         Sneering Swank of Gosh.  In Gosh, sad Gosh, where the Lord Swank lives,    He holds high rank, and he has much pelf; And all the well-paid posts he gives Unto his fawning relatives,         As foolish as himself. In offices and courts and boards    Are Swanks, and Swanks, ten dozen Swanks,         And cousin Swanks in hordes-- Inept and musty, dry and dusty,         Rusty Swanks in hordes.  The clouds so soft, that sail aloft,    Weep laughing tears of rain; The blue sky spread high overhead    Peeps thro' in mild disdain. All nature laughs and jeers and chaffs    When the Swank goes out to walk; But every Glug bows low his head, And says in tones surcharged with dread,    \"Bow low, bow low, Glugs lean, Glugs fat!\"    But the North wind snatches off his hat, And flings it high, and shrieks to see         His ruffled dignity.  They lurk in every Gov'ment lair,    'Mid docket dull and dusty file, Solemnly squat in an easy chair, Penning a minute of rare hot air         In departmental style. In every office, on every floor    Are Swanks, and Swanks, distracting Swanks,         And Acting-Swanks a score, And coldly distant, sub-assistant         Under-Swanks galore.  In peaceful days when the countryside    Poured wealth to Gosh, and the skies were blue, The great King Splosh no fault espied, And seemed entirely satisfied         With Swanks who muddled thro'. But when they fell on seasons bad,    Oh, then the Swanks, the bustled Swanks,         The hustled Swanks went mad-- The minute-writing, nation-blighting,         Skiting Swanks went mad.  The tall trees sway like boys at play,    And mock him when he grieves, As one by one, in laughing fun,    They pelt him with their leaves. And the gay green trees joke to the breeze,    As the Swank struts proudly by; But every Glug, with reverence, Pays homage to his pride immense--    A homage deep to lofty rank--    The Swank!  The Swank!  The pompous Swank! But the wind-borne leaves await their chance         And round him gaily dance.  Now, trouble came to the land of Gosh:    The fear of battle, and anxious days; And the Swanks were called to the great King Splosh, Who said that their system would not wash,         And ordered other ways. Then the Lord High Swank stretched forth a paw, And penned a minute re the law,    And the Swanks, the Swanks, the other Swanks,         The brother Swanks said, \"Haw!\" These keen, resourceful, unremorseful,         Forceful Swanks said, \"Haw!\"  Then Splosh, the king, in a royal rage,    He smote his throne as he thundered, \"Bosh! In the whole wide land is there not one sage With a cool, clear brain, who'll straight engage         To sweep the Swanks from Gosh?\" But the Lord High Stodge, from where he stood, Cried, \"Barley! . . . Guard your livelihood!\"    And, quick as light, the teeming Swanks,         The scheming Swanks touched wood. Sages, plainly, labour vainly         When the Swanks touch wood.  The stealthy cats that grace the mats    Before the doors of Gosh, Smile wide with scorn each sunny morn;    And, as they take their wash, A sly grimace o'erspreads each face    As the Swank struts forth to court. But every Glug casts down his eyes, And mutters, \"Ain't 'is 'at a size!    For such a sight our gods we thank.    Sir Stodge, the Swank!  The noble Swank!\" But the West wind tweaks his nose in sport;         And the Swank struts into court.  Then roared the King with a rage intense,    \"Oh, who can cope with their magic tricks?\" But the Lord High Swank skipped nimbly hence, And hid him safe behind the fence         Of Regulation VI. And under Section Four Eight 0    The Swanks, the Swanks, dim forms of Swanks,         The swarms of Swanks lay low-- These most tenacious, perspicacious,         Spacious Swanks lay low.  Cried the King of Gosh, \"They shall not escape!    Am I set at naught by a crazed buffoon?\" But in fifty fathoms of thin red tape The Lord Swank swaddled his portly shape,         Like a large, insane cocoon. Then round and round and round and round.    The Swanks, the Swanks, the whirling Swanks,         The twirling Swanks they wound-- The swathed and swaddled, molly-coddled         Swanks inanely wound.  Each insect thing that comes in Spring    To gladden this sad earth, It flits and whirls and pipes and skirls,    It chirps in mocking mirth A merry song the whole day long    To see the Swank abroad. But every Glug, whoe'er he be, Salutes, with grave humility    And deference to noble rank,    The Swank, the Swank, the swollen Swank; But the South wind blows his clothes awry,         And flings dust in his eye.  So trouble stayed in the land of Gosh;    And the futile Glugs could only gape, While the Lord High Swank still ruled King Splosh With laws of blither and rules of bosh,         From out his lair of tape. And in cocoons that mocked the Glug    The Swanks, the Swanks, the under-Swanks,         The dunder Swanks lay snug. These most politic, parasitic,         Critic Swanks lay snug.  Then mourn with me for a luckless land,    Oh, weep with me for the slaves of tape! Where the Lord High Swank still held command, And wrote new rules in a fair round hand,         And the Glugs saw no escape; Where tape entwined all Gluggish things,    And the Swank, the Swank, the grievous Swank,         The devious Swank pulled strings-- The perspicacious, contumacious         Swank held all the strings.  The blooms that grow, and, in a row,    Peep o'er each garden fence, They nod and smile to note his style    Of ponderous pretence; Each roving bee has fits of glee    When the Swank goes by that way. But every Glug, he makes his bow, And says, \"Just watch him!  Watch him now!    He must have thousands in the bank!    The Swank!  The Swank! The holy Swank!\" But the wild winds snatch his kerchief out,         And buffet him about.    VIII. THE SEER  Somewhere or other, 'tis doubtful where, In the archives of Gosh is a volume rare,    A precious old classic that nobody reads,    And nobody asks for, and nobody heeds; Which makes it a classic, and famed thro' the land, As well-informed persons will quite understand.  'Tis a ponderous work, and 'tis written in prose, For some mystical reason that nobody knows;    And it tells in a style that is terse and correct    Of the rule of the Swanks and its baneful effect On the commerce of Gosh, on its morals and trade; And it quotes a grave prophecy somebody made.  And this is the prophecy, written right bold On a parchment all tattered and yellow and old;    So old and so tattered that nobody knows    How far into foretime its origin goes. But this is the writing that set Glugs agog When 'twas called to their minds by the Mayor of Quog:   When Gosh groaneth bastlie thro Greed and bys plannes Ye rimer shall mende ye who mendes pottes and pans.   Now, the Mayor of Quog, a small suburb of Gosh, Was intensely annoyed at the act of King Splosh    In asking the Mayor of Piphel to tea    With himself and the Queen on a Thursday at three; When the King must have known that the sorriest dog, If a native of Piphel, was hated in Quog.  An act without precedent!  Quog was ignored! The Mayor and Council and Charity Board,    They met and considered this insult to Quog;    And they said, \" 'Tis the work of the treacherous Og! 'Tis plain the Og influence threatens the Throne; And the Swanks are all crazed with this trading in stone.\"  Said the Mayor of Quog: \"This has long been foretold In a prophecy penned by the Seer of old.    We must search, if we'd banish the curse of our time,    For a mender of pots who's a maker of rhyme. 'Tis to him we must"]]]
