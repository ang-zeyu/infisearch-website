Art was the only thing worth living and dying for; the world was full of women, and they were all alike, old, young, ugly, handsome--all a pack of heartless jades; but art was one, beautiful, true, deathless and unchanging.  He looked up from the furnace door, and he felt the blood rush to his face. Marietta was standing near and watching him with her strangely veiled eyes.  \"Poor Zorzi!\" she exclaimed in a soft voice. \"How hot you look!\"  He did not remember that he had ever cared a straw whether any one noticed that he was hot or not, until that moment; but for some complicated reason connected with his own thoughts the remark stung him like an insult, and fully confirmed his recent verdict concerning women in general and their total lack of all human kindness where men were concerned. He rose to his feet suddenly and turned away without a word.  \"Come out into the garden,\" said Marietta. \"Do you need Zorzi just now?\" she asked, turning to her father, who only shook his head by way of answer, for he was very busy.  \"But I assure you that I am not too hot,\" answered Zorzi. \"Why should I go out?\"  \"Because I want you to fasten up one of the branches of the red rose. It catches in my skirt every time I pass. You will need a hammer and a little nail.\"  She had not been thinking of his comfort after all, thought Zorzi as he got the hammer. She had only wanted something done for herself. He might have known it. But for the rose that caught in her skirt, he might have roasted alive at the furnace before she would have noticed that he was hot. He followed her out. She led him to the end of the walk farthest from the door of the laboratory; the sun was low and all the little garden was in deep shade. A branch of the rose-bush lay across the path, and Zorzi thought it looked very much as if it had been pulled down on purpose. She pointed to it, and as he carefully lifted it from the ground she spoke quickly, in a low tone.  \"What was my father saying to you a while ago?\" she asked.  Zorzi held up the branch in his hand, ready to fasten it against the wall, and looked at her. He saw at a glance that she had brought him out to ask the question.  \"The master was giving me certain orders,\" he said.  \"He rarely makes such long speeches when he gives orders,\" observed the girl.  \"His instructions were very particular.\"  \"Will you not tell me what they were?\"  Zorzi turned slowly from her and let the long branch rest on the bush while he began to drive a nail into the wall. Marietta watched him.  \"Why do you not answer me?\" she asked.  \"Because I cannot,\" he said briefly.  \"Because you will not, you mean.\"  \"As you choose.\" Zorzi went on striking the nail.  \"I am sorry,\" answered the young girl. \"I really wish to know very much. Besides, if you will tell me, I will give you something.\"  Zorzi turned upon her suddenly with angry eyes.  \"If money could buy your father's secrets from me, I should be a rich man by this time.\"  \"I think I know as much of my father's secrets as you do,\" answered Marietta more coldly, \"and I did not mean to offer you money.\"  \"What then?\" But as he asked the question Zorzi turned away again and began to fasten the branch.  Marietta did not answer at once, but she idly picked a rose from the bush and put it to her lips to breathe in its freshness.  \"Why should you think that I meant to insult you?\" she asked gently.  \"I am only a servant, after all,\" answered Zorzi, with unnecessary bitterness. \"Why should you not insult your servants, if you please? It would be quite natural.\"  \"Would it? Even if you were really a servant?\"  \"It seems quite natural to you that I should betray your father's confidence. I do not see much difference between taking it for granted that a man is a traitor and offering him money to act as one.\"  \"No,\" said Marietta, smelling the rose from time to time as she spoke, \"there is not much difference. But I did not mean to hurt your feelings.\"  \"You did not realise that I could have any, I fancy,\" retorted Zorzi, still angry.  \"Perhaps I did not understand that you would consider what my father was telling you in the same light as a secret of the art,\" said Marietta slowly, \"nor that you would look upon what I meant to offer you as a bribe. The matter concerned me, did it not?\"  \"Your name was not spoken. I have fastened the branch. Is there anything else for me to do?\"  \"Have you no curiosity to know what I would have given you?\" asked Marietta.  \"I should be ashamed to want anything at such a price,\" returned Zorzi proudly.  \"You hold your honour high, even in trifles.\"  \"It is all I have--my honour and my art.\"  \"You care for nothing else? Nothing else in the whole world?\"  \"Nothing,\" said Zorzi.  \"You must be very lonely in your thoughts,\" she said, and turned away.  As she went slowly along the path her hand hung by her side, and the rose she held fell from her fingers. Following her at a short distance, on his way back to the laboratory, Zorzi stooped and picked up the flower, not thinking that she would turn her head. But at that moment she had reached the door, and she looked back and saw what he had done. She stood still and held out her hand, expecting him to come up with her.  \"My rose!\" she exclaimed, as if surprised. \"Give it back to me.\"  Zorzi gave it to her, and the colour came to his face a second time. She fastened it in her bodice, looking down at it as she did so.  \"I am so fond of roses,\" she said, smiling a little. \"Are you?\"  \"I planted all those you have here,\" he answered.  \"Yes--I know.\"  She looked up as she spoke, and met his eyes, and all at once she laughed, not unkindly, nor as if at him, nor at what he had said, but quietly and happily, as women do when they have got what they want. Zorzi did not understand.  \"You are gay,\" he said coldly.  \"Do you wonder?\" she asked. \"If you knew what I know, you would understand.\"  \"But I do not.\"  Zorzi went back to his furnace, Marietta exchanged a few words with her father and left the room again to go home.  In the garden she paused a moment by the rose-bush, where she had talked with Zorzi, but there was not even the shadow of a smile in her face now. She went down the dark corridor and called the porter, who roused himself, opened the door and hailed the house opposite. A woman looked out in the evening light, nodded and disappeared. A few seconds later she came out of the house, a quiet little middle-aged creature in brown, with intelligent eyes, and she crossed the shaky wooden bridge over the canal to come and bring Marietta home. It would have been a scandalous thing if the daughter of Angelo Beroviero had been seen by the neighbours to walk a score of paces in the street without an attendant. She had thrown a hood of dark green cloth over her head, and the folds hung below her shoulders, half hiding her graceful figure. Her step was smooth and deliberate, while the little brown serving-woman trotted beside her across the wooden bridge.  The house of Angelo Beroviero hung over the paved way, above the edge of the water, the upper story being supported by six stone columns and massive wooden beams, forming a sort of portico which was at the same time a public thoroughfare; but as the house was not far from the end of the canal of San Piero which opens towards Venice, few people passed that way.  Marietta paused a moment while the woman held the door open for her. The sun had just set and the salt freshness that comes with the rising tide was already in the air.  \"I wish I were in Venice this evening,\" she said, almost to herself.  The serving-woman looked at her suspiciously.     CHAPTER II   The June night was dark and warm as Zorzi pushed off from the steps before his master's house and guided his skiff through the canal, scarcely moving the single oar, as the rising tide took his boat silently along. It was not until he had passed the last of the glass-houses on his right, and was already in the lagoon that separates Murano from Venice, that he began to row, gently at first, for fear of being heard by some one ashore, and then more quickly, swinging his oar in the curved crutch with that skilful, serpentine stroke which is neither rowing nor sculling, but which has all the advantages of both, for it is swift and silent, and needs scarcely to be slackened even in a channel so narrow that the boat itself can barely pass.  Now that he was away from the houses, the stars came out and he felt the pleasant land breeze in his face, meeting the rising tide. Not a boat was out upon the shallow lagoon but his own, not a sound came from the town behind him; but as the flat bow of the skiff gently slapped the water, it plashed and purled with every stroke of the oar, and a faint murmur of voices in song was borne to him on the wind from the still waking city.  He stood upright on the high stern of the shadowy craft, himself but a moving shadow in the starlight, thrown forward now, and now once more erect, in changing motion; and as he moved the same thought came back and back again in a sort of halting and painful rhythm. He was out that night on a bad errand, it said, helping to sell the life of the woman he loved, and what he was doing could never be undone. Again and again the words said themselves, the far-off voices said them, the lapping water took them up and repeated them, the breeze whispered them quickly as it passed, the oar pronounced them as it creaked softly in the crutch rowlock, the stars spelled out the sentences in the sky, the lights of Venice wrote them in the water in broken reflections. He was not alone any more, for everything in heaven and earth was crying to him to go back.  That was folly, and he knew it. The master who had trusted him would drive him out of his house, and out of Venetian land and water, too, if he chose, and he should never see Marietta again; and she would be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16100"],["title","Marietta: A Maid of Venice (#3)"],["body","to Contarini just as if Zorzi had taken the message. Besides, it was the custom of the world everywhere, so far as he knew, that marriage and money should be spoken of in the same breath, and there was no reason why his master should make an exception and be different from other men.  He could put some hindrance in the way, of course, if he chose to interfere, for he could deliver the message wrong, and Contarini would go to the church in the afternoon instead of in the morning. He smiled grimly in the dark as he thought of the young nobleman waiting for an hour or two beside the pillar, to be looked at by some one who never came, then catching sight at last of some ugly old maid of forty, protected by her servant, ogling him, while she said her prayers and filling him with horror at the thought that she must be Marietta Beroviero. All that might happen, but it must inevitably be found out, the misunderstanding would be cleared away and the marriage would be arranged after all.  He had rested on his oar to think, and now he struck it deep into the black water and the skiff shot ahead. He would have a far better chance of serving Marietta in the future if he obeyed his master and delivered his message exactly; for he should see Contarini himself and judge of him, in the first place, and that alone was worth much, and afterwards there would be time enough for desperate resolutions. He hastened his stroke, and when he ran under the shadow of the overhanging houses his mood changed and he grew hopeful, as many young men do, out of sheer curiosity as to what was before him, and out of the wish to meet something or somebody that should put his own strength to the test.  It was not far now. With infinite caution he threaded the dark canals, thanking fortune for the faint starlight that showed him the turnings. Here and there a small oil lamp burned before the image of a saint; from a narrow lane on one side, the light streamed across the water, and with it came sounds of ringing glasses, and the tinkling of a lute, and laughing voices; then it was dark again as his skiff shot by, and he made haste, for he wished not to be seen.  Presently, and somewhat to his surprise, he saw a gondola before him in a narrow place, rowed slowly by a man who seemed to be in black like himself. He did not try to pass it, but kept a little astern, trying not to attract attention and hoping that it would turn aside into another canal. But it went steadily on before him, turning wherever he must turn, till it stopped where he was to stop, at the water-gate of the house of the Agnus Dei. Instantly he brought to in the shadow, with the instinctive caution of every one who is used to the water. Gondolas were few in those days and belonged only to the rich, who had just begun to use them as a means of getting about quickly, much more convenient than horses or mules; for when riding a man often had to go far out of his way to reach a bridge, and there were many canals that had no bridle path at all and where the wooden houses were built straight down into the water as the stone ones are to-day. Zorzi peered through the darkness and listened. The occupant of the gondola might be Contarini himself, coming home. Whoever it was tapped softly upon the door, which was instantly opened, but to Zorzi's surprise no light shone from the entrance. All the house above was still and dark, and he could barely make out by the starlight the piece of white marble bearing the sculptured Agnus Dei whence the house takes its name. He knew that above the high balcony there were graceful columns bearing pointed stone arches, between which are the symbols of the four Evangelists; but he could see nothing of them. Only on the balcony, he fancied he saw something less dark than the wall or the sky, and which might be a woman's dress.  Some one got out of the gondola and went in after speaking a few words in a low tone, and the door was then shut without noise. The gondola glided on, under the Baker's Bridge, but Zorzi could not see whether it went further or not; he thought he heard the sound of the oar, as if it were going away. Coming alongside the step, he knocked gently as the last comer had done, and the door opened again. He had already made his skiff fast to the step.  \"Your business here?\" asked a muffled voice out of the dark.  Zorzi felt that a number of persons were in the hall immediately behind the speaker.  \"For the Lord Jacopo Contarini,\" he answered. \"I have a message and a token to deliver.\"  \"From whom?\"  \"I will tell that to his lordship,\" replied Zorzi.  \"I am Contarini,\" replied the voice, and the speaker felt for Zorzi's face in the darkness, and brought it near his ear.  \"From Angelo,\" whispered Zorzi, so softly that Contarini only heard the last word.  The door was now shut as noiselessly as before, but not by Contarini himself. He still kept his hold on Zorzi's arm.  \"The token,\" he whispered impatiently.  Zorzi pulled the little leathern bag out of his doublet, slipped the string over his head and thrust the token into Contarini's hand. The latter uttered a low exclamation of surprise.  \"What is this?\" he asked.  \"The token,\" answered Zorzi.  He had scarcely spoken when he felt Contarini's arms round him, holding him fast. He was wise enough to make no attempt to escape from them.  \"Friends,\" said Contarini quickly, \"the man who just came in is a spy. I am holding him. Help me!\"  It seemed to Zorzi that a hundred hands seized him in the dark; by the arms, by the legs, by the body, by the head. He knew that resistance was worse than useless. There were hands at his throat, too.  \"Let us do nothing hastily,\" said Contarini's voice, close beside him. \"We must find out what he knows first. We can make him speak, I daresay.\"  \"We are not hangmen to torture a prisoner till he confesses,\" observed some one in a quiet and rather indolent tone. \"Strangle him quickly and throw him into the canal. It is late already.\"  \"No,\" answered Contarini. \"Let us at least see his face. We may know him. If you cry out,\" he said to Zorzi, \"you will be killed instantly.\"  \"Jacopo is right,\" said some one who had not spoken yet.  Almost at the same instant a door was opened and a broad bar of light shot across the hall from an inner room. Zorzi was roughly dragged towards it, and he saw that he was surrounded by about twenty masked men. His face was held to the light, and Contarini's hold on his throat relaxed.  \"Not even a mask!\" exclaimed Jacopo. \"A fool, or a madman. Speak, man I Who are you? Who sent you here?\"  \"My name is Zorzi,\" answered the glass-blower with difficulty, for he had been almost choked. \"My business is with the Lord Jacopo alone. It is very private.\"  \"I have no secrets from my friends,\" said Contarini. \"Speak as if we were alone.\"  \"I have promised my master to deliver the message in secret. I will not speak here.\"  \"Strangle him and throw him out,\" suggested the man with the indolent voice. \"His master is the devil, I have no doubt. He can take the message back with him.\"  Two or three laughed.  \"These spies seldom hunt alone,\" remarked another. \"While we are wasting time a dozen more may be guarding the entrance to the house.\"  \"I am no spy,\" said Zorzi.  \"What are you, then?\"  \"A glass-worker of Murano.\"  Contarini's hands relaxed altogether, now, and he bent his ear to Zorzi's lips.  \"Whisper your message,\" he said quickly.  Zorzi obeyed.  \"Angelo Beroviero bids you wait by the second pillar on the left in Saint Mark's church, next Sunday morning, at one hour before noon, till you shall see him, and in a week from that time you shall have an answer; and be silent, if you would succeed.\"  \"Very well,\" answered Contarini. \"Friends,\" he said, standing erect, \"it is a message I have expected. The name of the man who sends it is 'Angelo'--you understand. It is not this fellow's fault that he came here this evening.\"  \"I suppose there is a woman in the case,\" said the indolent man. \"We will respect your secret. Put the poor devil out of his misery and let us come to our business.\"  \"Kill an innocent man!\" exclaimed Contarini.  \"Yes, since a word from him can send us all to die between the two red columns.\"  \"His master is powerful and rich,\" said Jacopo. \"If the fellow does not go back to-night, there will be trouble to-morrow, and since he was sent to my house, the inquiry will begin here.\"  \"That is true,\" said more than one voice, in a tone of hesitation.  Zorzi was very pale, but he held his head high, facing the light of the tall wax candles on the table around which his captors were standing. He was hopelessly at their mercy, for they were twenty to one; the door had been shut and barred and the only window in the room was high above the floor and covered by a thick curtain. He understood perfectly that, by the accident of Angelo's name, \"Angel\" being the password of the company, he had been accidentally admitted to the meeting of some secret society, and from what had been said, he guessed that its object was a conspiracy against the Republic. It was clear that in self-defence they would most probably kill him, since they could not reasonably run the risk of trusting their lives in his hands. They looked at each other, as if silently debating what they should do.  \"At first you suggested that we should torture him,\" sneered the indolent man, \"and now you tremble like a girl at the idea of killing him! Listen to me, Jacopo; if you think that I will leave this house while this fellow is alive, you are most egregiously mistaken.\"  He had drawn his dagger while he was speaking, and before he had finished it was dangerously near Zorzi's throat. Contarini retired a step as if not daring to defend the prisoner, whose assailant, in spite of his careless and almost womanish tone, was clearly a man of action. Zorzi looked fearlessly into the eyes that peered at him through the holes in the mask.  \"It is curious,\" observed the other. \"He does"]]]
