[Fig. 51.]  [Illustration: Fig. 51.]  Six notes may be written to one of the cantus firmus, as in Fig. 52.  [Illustration: Fig. 52.]  The cadences in Fig. 53 are good.  [Illustration: Fig. 53.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write three counterpoints above and three below, in the third species.  Write two eight-measure phrases, using second species continuously in both parts. [Fig. 34.]   CANTUS FIRMUS  [Illustration: Fig. 54.]     LESSON V  THIRD SPECIES IN BOTH PARTS   [Illustration: Fig. 55.]  The suggestions given for writing second species in both parts apply here, except that when both parts move degreewise, any interval may come on the second and fourth quarters, preferably a consonance. The third quarter is treated the same as the second half when writing the second species in both parts.  The augmented fourth, and diminished fifth and seventh, may be approached in similar motion. [Fig. 56.]  [Illustration: Fig. 56.]  The augmented fourth following the perfect fourth, as in Fig. 56_a_, is good.  The minor seventh, and the major and minor ninth of a chord, may be used freely on any but the first quarter, but must be consonant with the other part. [Fig. 57.]  [Illustration: Fig. 57.]  The first and third species may be mixed, as in Fig. 58.  [Illustration: Fig. 58.]  The second species may be used in one part and the third in the other, also six notes in one part and two in the other, and six in one and three in the other. All tones appearing simultaneously, must comply with the suggestions for tones appearing on the weak beat given in previous lessons, where both parts have other than the first species. [Fig. 59.]  [Illustration: Fig. 59.]  The cadences in Fig. 60 are good, and will suggest others.  [Illustration: Fig. 60.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write one counterpoint above and one below, in the third species.  To cantus firmus _b_ write counterpoints in six notes, one above and one below. [Fig. 52.]  Write one eight-measure phrase, mixing the first and third species. [Fig. 58.]  Write two eight-measure phrases, using third species in both parts. [Fig. 55.]   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 61.]     LESSON VI  FOURTH SPECIES   [Illustration: Fig. 62.]  This species is the same as the second, except that the last note of the measure is tied to the first note of the next, forming a syncopation. As in the second species, the first note of the counterpoint should form a unison, octave or fifth, and when the counterpoint begins on the second half it may also be an imperfect consonance.  When the counterpoint begins on the first half, the second half is treated the same as the second half of succeeding measures, described in the next paragraph.  After the first measure, the second half of the measure should contain a consonance (Fig. 63_a_), the first half a consonance (_b_), or dissonance (_c_), preferably the latter, in which case a suspension is formed. This is the most desirable form of syncopation. When the first half contains a dissonance, the counterpoint must descend--or ascend in retardation (_d_)--one degree to an imperfect consonance (_c_). When the first half is a consonance, it may be left by a skip to some other chord-tone (_e_), or by degreewise progression (_f_). In the latter case the second note is non-harmonic, and therefore should not be used to prepare a syncopation except as in Fig. 63_d_ (Retardation of the root in I_6).  [Illustration: Fig. 63.]  When writing three notes to one in the fourth species, the suspension may resolve on the second beat (_a_), or the third (_b_). In the latter case, the suspension skips (_c_) to some other chord-tone, before resolving. The resolution to the leading-tone (_d_) forms an important exception to this rule. [Fig. 64.]  [Illustration: Fig. 64.]  The fifth may be used in the lower part if it becomes the preparation of a suspension (Fig. 65_a_). It may also be used in the lower part, as in Fig. 65_b_, provided it resolves by skipping to the third of the chord.  In skipping from the fifth to the root, or the reverse, in the lower part, do so in an upward direction. The fifth, when treated as an harmonic passing-tone, may, however, be approached either ascending or descending.  [Illustration: Fig. 65.]  The retardation should be used only when prepared by the leading-tone. It rises a semitone in resolving. [Fig. 66.]  [Illustration: Fig. 66.]  The following dissonant intervals may be used on the first half of the measure:--When the counterpoint is above, the fourth and seventh in suspension, and second and fifth in retardation; and when below, the second in suspension, and the fourth and seventh in retardation. [Fig. 67.]  [Illustration: Fig. 67.]  Consecutive fifths on consecutive strong beats of the measure are good when one of the tones of the second fifth is prepared, as in Fig. 68.  [Illustration: Fig. 68.]  The following cadences are good:  [Illustration: Fig. 69.]   EXERCISES  Write one eight-measure phrase with two notes to the measure in one part and six in the other; one with three notes in one and six in the other; and one with two notes in one part and four in the other. (Fig. 59.) In combining the species in this and succeeding lessons the student may place any species in any part.  To the cantus firmus write two counterpoints above and two below, in the fourth species.   CANTUS FIRMUS  [Illustration: Fig. 70.]     LESSON VII  FOURTH SPECIES (Continued)   The first and fourth species may be mixed as in Fig. 71. Rules for writing other than the first species in both parts are to be regarded.  [Illustration: Fig. 71.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write two counterpoints above and two below, in the fourth species.  To cantus firmus _b_ write two above and two below, three half-notes to the measure, with syncopations.  Write two eight-measure phrases, mixing the first and fourth species.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 72.]     LESSON VIII  COMBINING THE FOURTH SPECIES WITH THE OTHERS   All previous rules for combining species still apply.  In combining the fourth species with other than the first, the following intervals may be used on the first half of the measure, in addition to those mentioned in Lesson VI: When the counterpoint is below, the fourth, fifth and seventh in suspension, and the ninth in retardation; and when above, the fifth in suspension, and the seventh in retardation; but in every such case the part having other than the fourth species must skip to some other chord-tone before resolving the suspension. [Fig. 73.]  [Illustration: Fig. 73.]  The leading-tone may be doubled as in Fig. 74. Here the leading-tone that is prepared skips to some other chord-tone, while the new leading-tone remains stationary.  [Illustration: Fig. 74.]  The minor or diminished seventh, major or minor ninth, may be used as preparation of a suspension in either part, provided it is approached by a skip in an upward direction, and is consonant with the other part, or is one of the permitted dissonances. [Fig. 75.]  [Illustration: Fig. 75.]  The fourth species may be combined with the second or third species, and two or three notes syncopated may be written in one part with six in the other. [Fig. 76.]  [Illustration: Fig. 76.]   EXERCISES  To the cantus firmus write one counterpoint above and one below, in the fourth species.  Write one eight-measure phrase each, of the following combinations: The fourth species with the second; the fourth with the third; two notes syncopated against six notes; and three notes syncopated against six notes. Write some in major and some in minor. [Fig. 76.]   CANTUS FIRMUS  [Illustration: Fig. 77.]     LESSON IX  FIFTH SPECIES: FLORID COUNTERPOINT   [Illustration: Fig. 78.]  Florid counterpoint is a mixture of the second, third and fourth species.  In addition to these species eighth-notes may be used in groups of two on the second and fourth quarters of the measure. Both notes should be approached and left stepwise, with the exception that the first may be taken by a skip. [Fig. 79.]  [Illustration: Fig. 79.]  Not more than one and one-half measures of any one species should be used continuously in one part. [Fig. 80.]  [Illustration: Fig. 80.]  In the use of quarter-notes it is necessary to exercise care. They may be used on the first half when preceded by quarter-notes, when the entire measure is filled, or when they precede a half-note which is the preparation of a suspension. On the second half they are always good. [Fig. 81.]  [Illustration: Fig. 81.]  For the present the suspension should not be less than a half-note or its rhythmic equivalent in the ornamental resolution.  In this species the suspension may resolve ornamentally, that is, it may have some note or notes interpolated between the suspension and its resolution. The relative position of the suspension and its resolution must remain the same as in the regular resolution. [Fig. 82.]  When the suspension is left by a leap, the note skipped to should be consonant with the other part (_b_). When eighth-notes are used, as at _a_, they must be approached and left stepwise.  The suspension, instead of being sustained as a half-note, may be repeated on the second quarter, as at _c_. In this case it is best to continue stepwise through the tone of resolution.  At _d_ the resolution, instead of coming on the second half, appears on the quarters on either side. This is good.  [Illustration: Fig. 82.]  The ornamental resolution may be used in either part.  Use the suspension freely.  The solutions should be musical, and are to be written over and over again until such are secured.  All cadences of the second, third and fourth species, or any combination of these, may be used.   EXERCISES  To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write two counterpoints above and two below, in the fifth species   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 83.]     LESSON X  FLORID COUNTERPOINT (Continued)   When"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16342"],["title","A Treatise on Simple Counterpoint in Forty Lessons (#3)"],["body","counterpoint is combined with other than first species, the dotted half followed by a quarter-note (_a_), or two eighth-notes (_b_), is good. Also, a rhythmic figure, as at _c_, where a half-note occupies the second and third quarters, may be used. [Fig. 84.]  [Illustration: Fig. 84.]   EXERCISES  Write one eight-measure phrase, each, of the following combinations: The fifth species with the second; the fifth with the third; and the fifth with the fourth. Write also two eight-measure phrases with fifth species in both parts. [Fig. 85.]  [Illustration: Fig. 85.]     SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT IN THREE PARTS  LESSON XI  FIRST SPECIES   [Illustration: Fig. 86.]  Regard all rules for two-part counterpoint, unless otherwise mentioned.  If possible, each measure should contain a complete chord. When in the first species it becomes necessary to double an interval, let it be preferably the root. The third should be doubled only when a decidedly smoother melodic progression is thereby obtained; and when both thirds are in outer parts, each should be approached and left stepwise in one direction (Fig. 87). The doubling of the fifth is, of course, impossible, since it necessitates the omission of the third.  [Illustration: Fig. 87.]  All triads may be used in their first inversion.  Diminished and augmented triads, however, are best used in their first inversion.  The six-four chord may be used at the close as the cadencing tonic six-four chord. Do not approach the root and fifth in similar motion, as at _b_. [Fig. 88.]  [Illustration: Fig. 88.]  The dominant seventh may be used in any but its second inversion, the fifth being omitted.[2] The seventh requires no preparation. Other chords of the seventh are better not used until second species and later.  If possible, let the chord in the first measure appear complete. The last chord but one should be complete, unless some form of V or V_7 is used. [Fig. 89.]      [2] In severely strict counterpoint all parts above the lowest must be     consonant with it. Dissonances, when entering simultaneously with it,     must be treated as suspensions, and when used in the progression of a     part from one chord to another, should be treated as passing-tones or     embellishments. This excludes the use of the unprepared seventh and     ninth; all diminished and augmented triads except in their first     inversion; and all six-four chords, except when the lowest part is     treated as a passing-tone.  [Illustration: Fig. 89.]  Consecutive major thirds may be used when three or more parts are employed. [Fig. 90.]  [Illustration: Fig. 90.]  A note may now be repeated in the lowest part when it becomes the seventh of a dominant seventh-chord. [Fig. 91.]  [Illustration: Fig. 91.]  In writing, use soprano, alto and tenor, or alto, tenor and bass; and do not separate upper parts more than an octave. For a chord or two they may (for the sake of better voice-leading) separate a tenth.  All hidden fifths and octaves are bad, except between I and V and V and I. [Fig. 92_a, b_.]  The perfect fifth following the diminished fifth is good when taken in an upward direction stepwise in the higher parts. [Fig. 92_c_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 92.]  All cadences used in harmony are good.  Unless otherwise mentioned, put the cantus firmus in any part, but avoid its continued use in the same part.   EXERCISES  To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write the first species in all parts. Write each three times, setting the cantus firmus in a different part in each solution. This necessitates transposing the cantus firmus, when setting it in the other parts.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 93.]     LESSON XII  THE SECOND SPECIES   [Illustration: Fig. 94.]  The second species is written in one part and the first in the other two.  All suggestions made for the second species in two-part counterpoint are to be observed, unless otherwise mentioned. Those regarding consecutive perfect intervals are especially to be observed.  The fifth, when in the lowest voice, should be used as in two-part counterpoint, except when used in V4/3 or the cadencing tonic six-four chord.  The V4/3 chord may be used on the weak beat, necessitating the omission of the third. [Fig. 95_a_.]  The third may be omitted (_b_), or doubled (_c_), on the weak beat in this and succeeding species. [Fig. 95.]  [Illustration: Fig. 95.]  The minor or diminished seventh may be approached by a skip in an upward direction on the weak beat in any part. This usually necessitates the omission of some other chord-member on the weak beat.  The major or minor ninth may also be used in the same way, except in the lowest part, provided it is at least a ninth above the root. [Fig. 96.]  [Illustration: Fig. 96.]  The progression from vii_6° to V in root-position or any inversion in the same measure, is good. [Fig. 97.] Use _b_ and _c_ only when using other than first species in two or more parts.  [Illustration: Fig. 97.]  Each measure should usually contain a complete chord. If not complete on the first beat, bring the missing interval in on the second. [Fig. 98.]  [Illustration: Fig. 98.]  The cadences in Fig. 99 are good, and will suggest others. The use of the fourth species is permitted as at _a_. A note may be repeated in the final cadence in all species as at _b_.  [Illustration: Fig. 99.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write the first species in all parts, as previously directed.  To cantus firmus _b_ write second species in one part. Write three times, changing cantus firmus and counterpoint about so that they will appear in each part in turn.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 100.]     LESSON XIII  SECOND SPECIES IN TWO PARTS   [Illustration: Fig. 101.]  The suggestions for second species in both parts, in two-part counterpoint, apply for the two parts having the second species in three-part counterpoint.  Accidental harmonies sometimes appear on the weak beat. All tones in this accidental harmony foreign to the chord on the strong beat must be treated as dissonances. This must be regarded whenever two or more parts have other than the first species. [Fig. 102.]  [Illustration: Fig. 102.]  At Fig. 102_a_, the accidental harmony _f-a-c_ is on the weak beat. The _f_ and _a_, being foreign to the chord _c-e-g_ on the strong beat, are correctly treated as dissonances. At _b_, the _f_ and _a_ are left by skip, which is not permitted.  The second species may be written continuously in all parts; the tones appearing on the weak beat must be harmonically related to one another, and those foreign to the chord on the strong beat must be treated as dissonances. [Fig. 103.]  [Illustration: Fig. 103.]  The first and second species may be mixed, as in Fig. 104.  [Illustration: Fig. 104.]  The cadences in Fig. 105 are good, and will suggest others. Those with first species in all parts may also be used.  [Illustration: Fig. 105.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write a counterpoint in the second species in one part. Write three settings, as directed in the previous lesson.  Write two eight-measure phrases mixing the first and second species in all parts.  To cantus firmus _b_ write counterpoints in the second species in the other two parts. Write two settings, with the cantus firmus in different parts.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 106.]     LESSON XIV  THIRD SPECIES   [Illustration: Fig. 107.]  The suggestions for third species in two-part counterpoint, as well as those for writing the second species in three-part counterpoint, apply when writing third species in three-part counterpoint.  The cadences at Fig. 108 are good, and will suggest others.  [Illustration: Fig. 108.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write third species in one part. Write three settings as previously directed.  To cantus firmus _b_ write second species in two parts, as previously directed.  Write one eight-measure phrase, using second species in all parts.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 109.]     LESSON XV  THIRD SPECIES IN TWO OR MORE PARTS   [Illustration: Fig. 110.]  Previous suggestions when two or more parts have other than first species, apply here.  In using the ninth of a chord it is well to keep it at least a seventh distant from the third, as well as a ninth above the root, except in the case of the dominant ninth in minor keys, where it may be separated by only an augmented second ([b]). [Fig. 111.]  [Illustration: Fig. 111.]  In writing the third species in all parts, notes appearing simultaneously should be harmonically related. Treat all tones foreign to the chord on the first quarter as dissonances.  The cadences in Fig. 112 are good.  [Illustration: Fig. 112.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write third species in one part, as previously directed.  To cantus firmus _b_ write third species in two parts, as in Fig. 110_b_. Write twice, changing the cantus firmus about.  Write one eight-measure phrase, mixing first and third species as in Fig. 110_a_.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 113.]     LESSON XVI  THIRD SPECIES (Continued)  EXERCISES   To the cantus firmus write third species in one part, as previously directed.  Write one eight-measure phrase, mixing first and third species; also one mixing first, second and third. [Fig. 114.]  Write one eight-measure phrase, using third species in all parts. [Fig. 110_c_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 114.]   CANTUS FIRMUS  [Illustration: Fig. 115.]     LESSON XVII  FOURTH SPECIES   [Illustration: Fig. 116.]  When the syncopation is a suspension or retardation, it is treated the same as in harmony.  The retardation should always be prepared by the leading-tone.  When the syncopated note belongs to the harmony of the measure, it may be left by a skip or stepwise progression. [Fig. 117.]  [Illustration: Fig. 117.]  The third may be omitted on the strong beat in this species, provided the part having fourth species skips to the missing third, as at Fig. 117_a_.  Consecutive fifths, but not octaves, are saved by the suspension. Whenever they "]]]
