The     acorns, the largest among the oaks, are semispherical with the cups     extremely shallow. The buds are large and sharp pointed, but not as     large as those of the black oak. They also have a few fine hairs on     their scales, but are not nearly as downy as those of the Black oak.  [Illustration: FIG. 61--Bark of Red Oak.]  Form and size: The red oak is the largest of the oaks and among the     largest of the trees in the northern forests. It has a straight     trunk, free from branches to a higher point than in the white oak,     see Fig. 94. The branches are less twisted and emerge at sharper     angles than do those of the white oak.  Range: It grows all over Eastern North America and reaches north farther     than any of the other oaks.  Soil and location: It is less fastidious in its soil and moisture     requirements than the other oaks and therefore grows in a great     variety of soils. It requires plenty of light.  [Illustration: FIG. 62.--Leaf and Fruit of Red Oak.]  Enemies: Like most of the other oaks, this species is comparatively free     from insects and disease.  Value for planting: The red oak grows faster and adapts itself better to     poor soil conditions than any of the other oaks and is therefore     easy to plant and easy to find in the nurseries. It makes an     excellent street tree, is equally desirable for the lawn and is     hardly surpassed for woodland planting.  Commercial value: The wood is hard and strong but coarse grained, and is     used for construction timber, interior finish and furniture. It is     inferior to white oak where strength and durability are required.   PIN OAK (_Quercus palustris_)  Distinguishing characters: Its method of *branching* will characterize     the tree at a glance. It develops a well-defined _main_ ascending     _stem_ with numerous _drooping_ side _branches_ as in Fig. 63. The     buds are very small and sharp pointed and the leaves are small as in     Fig. 64. The bark is dark, firm, smooth and in close ridges. The     acorn is small and carries a light brown, striped nut, wider than     long and bitter. The cup is shallow, enclosing only the base of the     nut.  [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Pin Oaks in Winter.]  Form and size: The pin oak is a medium-sized tree in comparison with     other oaks. It develops a tall, straight trunk that tapers     continuously through a pyramidal crown of low, drooping tender,     branches.  Range: Eastern North America.  Soil and location: It requires a deep, rich, moist soil and grows     naturally near swamps. Its roots are deep and spreading. The tree     grows rapidly and is easily transplanted.  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: The pin oak is an extremely graceful tree and is     therefore extensively used for planting on lawns and on certain     streets where the tree can find plenty of water and where conditions     will permit its branches to droop low.  Commercial value: The wood is heavy and hard but coarse grained and     liable to check and warp. Its principal use is in the construction     of houses and for shingles.  [Illustration: FIG. 64.--Leaf and Fruit of Pin Oak.]   CHESTNUT (_Castanea dentata_)  Distinguishing characters: The *bark* in young trees is smooth and of a     marked reddish-bronze color, but when the tree grows older, the bark     breaks up into *diamond-shaped ridges*, sufficiently characteristic     to distinguish the tree at a glance, see Fig. 65. A close     examination of the _terminal twig_ will show _three ridges_ and _two     grooves_ running down along the stem from the base of each leaf or     leaf-scar. The twig has no true terminal bud. The fruit, a large,     round *bur*, prickly without and hairy within and enclosing the     familiar dark brown, sweet edible nuts is also a distinguishing mark     of the tree.  Leaf: The leaves are distinctly long and narrow. They are from 6 to 8     inches long.  Form and size: The chestnut is a large tree with a massive trunk and     broad spreading crown. The chestnut tree when cut, sprouts readily     from the stump and therefore in places where the trees have once     been cut, a group of two to six trees may be seen emerging from the     old stump.  [Illustration: FIG. 65.--Trunk of Chestnut Tree.]  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: It will grow on rocky as well as on fertile soils and     requires plenty of light.  Enemies: During the past nine years nearly all the chestnut trees in the     United States have been attacked by a fungus disease (_Diaporthe     parasitica_, Mur.) which still threatens the entire extinction of     the chestnut trees in this country. No remedy has been discovered     and all affected trees should be cut down and the wood utilized     before it decays and becomes worthless. No species of chestnut tree     is entirely immune from this disease, though some species are highly     resistant.  Value for planting: The chestnut is one of the most rapidly growing     hardwood trees but, on account of its disease, which is now     prevalent everywhere, it is not wise to plant chestnut trees for the     present.  Commercial value: The wood is light, not very strong and liable to warp.     It is durable when brought in contact with the soil and is therefore     used for railroad ties, fence-posts, poles, and mine timbers. It is     also valuable for interior finish in houses and for fuel. Its bark     is used in the manufacture of tanning extracts and the nuts are sold     in cities in large quantities.     CHAPTER III  HOW TO IDENTIFY TREES--(Continued)    GROUP IX. THE HICKORIES, WALNUT AND BUTTERNUT  How to tell them from other trees and from each other: The hickory     trees, though symmetrical, have a rugged _appearance_ and the     _branches_ are so sturdy and black as to give a special distinction     to this group. The _buds_ are different from the buds of all other     trees and sufficiently characteristic to distinguish the various     species of the group. The _bark_ is also a distinguishing character.      The walnut and butternut have _chambered piths_ which distinguish     them from all other trees and from each other.   SHAGBARK HICKORY (_Hicoria ovata_)  Distinguishing characters: The yellowish brown *buds* nearly as large as     those of the mockernut hickory, _are each provided with two long,     dark, outer scales_ which stand out very conspicuously as shown in     Fig. 67. The *bark* in older specimens *shags* off in rough strips,     sometimes more than a foot long, as shown in Fig. 68. These two     characters will readily distinguish the tree at all seasons of the     year.  [Illustration: FIG. 66.--A Shagbark Hickory Tree.]  Leaf: The leaf is compound, consisting of 5 or 7 leaflets, the terminal     one generally larger.  Form and size: A tall, stately tree--the tallest of the hickories--of     rugged form and fine symmetry, see Fig. 66.  Range: Eastern North America.  Soil and location: The shagbark hickory grows in a great variety of     soils, but prefers a deep and rather moist soil.  Enemies: The _hickory bark borer_ (_Scolytus quadrispinosus_) is its     principal enemy. The insect is now killing thousands of hickory     trees in the vicinity of New York City and on several occasions has     made its appearance in large numbers in other parts of the country.  Value for planting: It is difficult to transplant, grows slowly and is     seldom found in nurseries.  [Illustration: FIG. 67.--Bud of the Shagbark Hickory.]  Commercial value: The wood is extremely tough and hard and is used for     agricultural implements and for the manufacture of wagons. It is     excellent for fuel and the nuts are of great value as a food.  Other characters: The fruit is a nut covered by a thick husk that     separates into 4 or 5 segments. The kernel is sweet.  Other common names: _Shellbark hickory_.   MOCKERNUT HICKORY (_Hicoria alba_)  [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Bark of the Shagbark Hickory.]  Distinguishing characters: The *bud* is the largest among the     hickories--nearly half an inch long--is hard and oval and covered     with _yellowish brown_ downy _scales_ which _do not project_ like     those of the shagbark hickory, see Fig. 69. The twigs are extremely     coarse. The *bark* is very tight on the trunk and branches and has a     _close_, hard, _wavy_ appearance as in Fig. 70.  Leaf: The leaf consists of 5, 7 or 9 leaflets all of which are large and     pubescent and possess a distinct resinous odor.  Form and size: A tall tree with a broad spreading head.  Range: Eastern North America.  Soil and location: The mockernut hickory grows on a great variety of     soils, but prefers one which is rich and well-drained.  Enemies: The same as for the shagbark hickory.  Value for planting: It is not commonly planted.  Commercial value: The wood is similar to that of the shagbark hickory     and is put to the same uses.  Other characters: The fruit is a nut, larger and covered with a shell     thicker than that of the shagbark. The husk is also thicker and     separates into four segments nearly to the base. The kernel is small     and sweet.  Other common names: _Bigbud hickory_; _whiteheart hickory_.  Comparisons: The _pignut hickory_ (_Hicoria glabra_), sometimes called     broom hickory or brown hickory, often has a shaggy bark, but differs     from both the shagbark and the mockernut hickory in possessing buds     very much smaller, twigs more slender and leaflets fewer. The nut     has a thinner husk which does not separate into four or five     segments. The tree prefers drier ground than the other hickories.  [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Bud of the Mockernut Hickory.]      The _bitternut_ (_Hicoria minima_) can be told from the mockernut     and other species of hickory by its bud, which has no scales at all.     The color of its bud is a characteristic orange yellow. The bark is     of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16116"],["title","Studies of Trees (#8)"],["body"," lighter shade than the bark of the mockernut hickory and the     leaflets are more numerous than in any of the hickories, varying     from 7 to 11. Its nuts are bitter.   BLACK WALNUT (_Juglans nigra_)  Distinguishing characters: By cutting a twig lengthwise, it will be seen     that its *pith* is divided into little _chambers_ as shown in Fig.     71. The bud is dark gray and satiny. The bark is dark brown and     deeply ridged and the fruit is the familiar round walnut.  [Illustration: FIG. 70.--Bark of the Mockernut Hickory.]  Form and size: A tall tree with a spreading crown composed of stout     branches. In the open it grows very symmetrically.  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: The black walnut prefers a deep, rich, fertile soil     and requires a great deal of light.  Enemies: The tree is a favorite of many caterpillars.  Value for planting: It forms a beautiful spreading tree on open ground,     but is not planted to any extent because it is hard to transplant.     It grows slowly unless the soil is very deep and rich, develops its     leaves late in the spring and sheds them early in the fall and     produces its fruit in great profusion.  Commercial value: The wood is heavy, strong, of chocolate brown color     and capable of taking a fine polish. It is used for cabinet making     and interior finish of houses. The older the tree, usually, the     better the wood, and the consumption of the species in the past has     been so heavy that it is becoming rare. The European varieties which     are frequently planted in America as substitutes for the native     species yield better nuts, but the American species produces better     wood.  [Illustration: FIG. 71.--Twig of the Black Walnut. Note the large chambers in the pith.]  [Illustration: FIG. 72.--Twig of the Butternut. Note the small chambers in the pith.]  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a large round nut about two inches in     diameter, covered with a smooth husk which at first is dull green     in color and later turns brown. The husk does not separate into     sections. The kernel is edible and produces an oil of commercial     value.      The _leaves_ are compound and alternate with 15 to 23 leaflets to     each.  Comparisons: The _butternut_ (_Juglans cinerea_) is another tree that     has the pith divided into little chambers, but the little chambers     here are shorter than in the black walnut, as may be seen from a     comparison of Figs. 71 and 72. The bark of the butternut is light     gray while that of the black walnut is dark. The buds in the     butternut are longer than those of the black walnut and are light     brown instead of gray in color. The form of the tree is low and     spreading as compared with the black walnut. The fruit in the     butternut is elongated while that of the black walnut is round. The     leaves of the butternut have fewer leaflets and these are lighter in     color.    GROUP X. TULIP TREE, SWEET GUM, LINDEN, MAGNOLIA, LOCUST, CATALPA, DOGWOOD, MULBERRY AND OSAGE ORANGE   TULIP TREE (_Liriodendron tulipifera_)  Distinguishing characters: There are four characters that stand out     conspicuously in the tulip tree--the *bud*, the *trunk*, the     persistent *fruit cups* and the wedged *leaf*.      The bud, Fig. 74, about three-quarters of an inch long, is covered     by two purplish scales which lend special significance to its whole     appearance. The trunk is extremely individual because it rises stout     and shaft-like, away above the ground without a branch as shown in     Fig. 73. The tree flowers in the latter part of May but the cup that     holds the fruit persists throughout the winter. The leaf, Fig. 75,     has four lobes, is nearly as broad as it is long and so notched at     the upper end that it looks different from any other leaf.  [Illustration: FIG. 73.--The Tulip Tree.]  [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Bud of the Tulip Tree.]  Form and size: The tulip tree is one of the largest, stateliest and     tallest of our trees.  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: Requires a deep, moist soil.  Enemies: Comparatively free from insects and disease.  Value for planting: The tree has great value as a specimen on the lawn     but is undesirable as a street tree because it requires considerable     moisture and transplants with difficulty. It should be planted while     young and where it can obtain plenty of light. It grows rapidly.  Commercial value: The wood is commercially known as _whitewood_ and     _yellow poplar_. It is light, soft, not strong and easily worked. It     is used in construction, for interior finish of houses, woodenware     and shingles. It has a medicinal value.  Other characters: The _flower_, shown in Fig. 75, is greenish yellow in     color, appears in May and resembles a tulip; hence the name tulip     tree. The _fruit_ is a cone.  Other common names: _Whitewood_; _yellow poplar_; _poplar_ and _tulip     poplar_.   SWEET GUM (_Liquidambar styraciflua_)  [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Leaf and Flower of the Tulip Tree.]  Distinguishing characters: The _persistent, spiny_, long-stemmed round     *fruit*; _the corky growths on the_ *twigs*, the characteristic     _star-shaped_ *leaves* (Fig. 76) and the very shiny greenish brown     buds and the perfect symmetry of the tree are the chief characters     by which to identify the species.  Form and size: The sweet gum has a beautiful symmetrical shape, forming     a true monopodium.  [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Leaf and Fruit of the Sweet Gum. Note the corky ridges along the twig.]  Range: From Connecticut to Florida and west to Missouri.  Soil and location: Grows in any good soil but prefers low wet ground. It     grows rapidly and needs plenty of light.  Enemies: Is very often a favorite of leaf-eating caterpillars.  Value for planting: The tree is sought for the brilliant color of its     foliage in the fall, and is suitable for planting both on the lawn     and street. In growing the tree for ornamental purposes it is     important that it should be frequently transplanted in the nursery     and that it be transported with burlap wrapping around its roots.  Commercial value: The wood is reddish brown in color, tends to splinter     and is inclined to warp in drying. It is used in cooperage, veneer     work and for interior finish.  Other characters: On the smaller branches there are irregular     developments of cork as shown in Fig. 76, projecting in some cases     to half an inch in thickness.  Other common names: _Red gum_.  Comparisons: The _cork elm_ is another tree that possesses corky ridges     along its twigs, but this differs from the sweet gum in wanting the     spiny fruit and its other distinctive traits.   AMERICAN LINDEN (_Tilia Americana_)  [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Bud of the Linden Tree.]  Distinguishing characters: The great distinguishing feature of any     linden is the *one-sided* character of its *bud* and *leaf*. The     bud, dark red and conical, carries a sort of protuberance which     makes it extremely one sided as shown in Fig. 77. The leaf, Fig. 78,     is heart-shaped with the side nearest the branch largest.  [Illustration: FIG. 78.--Leaves and Flowers of the European Linden.]  Form and size: The American Linden is a medium-sized tree with a broad     round head.  Range: Eastern North America and more common in the north than in the     south.  Soil and location: Requires a rich, moist soil.  [Illustration: FIG. 79.--European Linden Tree.]  [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Bud of the Umbrella Tree.]  Enemies: Its leaves are a favorite food of caterpillars and its wood is     frequently attacked by a boring insect known as the _linden borer_     (_Saperda vestita_).  Value for planting: The linden is easily transplanted and grows rapidly. It is used for lawn and street planting but is less desirable for these purposes than the European species.  Commercial value: The wood is light and soft and used for paper pulp,     woodenware, cooperage and furniture. The tree is a favorite with bee     keepers on account of the large quantities of nectar contained in     its flowers.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is like a pea, gray and woody. The     _flowers_ appear in early July, are greenish-yellow and very     fragrant.  Other common names: _Bass-wood_; _lime-tree_; _whitewood_.  Comparisons: The _European lindens_, Fig. 79, of which there are several     species under cultivation, differ from the native species in having     buds and leaves smaller in size, more numerous and darker in color.   THE MAGNOLIAS  The various species of magnolia trees are readily distinguished by their buds. They all prefer moist, rich soil and have their principal value as decorative trees on the lawn. They are distinctly southern trees; some species under cultivation in the United States come from Asia, but the two most commonly grown in the Eastern States are the cucumber tree and the umbrella tree.  [Illustration: FIG. 81.--Bark of the Black Locust.]   CUCUMBER TREE (_Magnolia acuminata_)  Distinguishing characters: The *buds* are _small_ and _slender_ compared     with those of the other magnolia trees and are _covered_ with small     silvery silky _hairs_. The *habit* of the tree is to form a straight     axis of great height with a symmetrical mass of branches, producing     a perfect monopodial crown. The tree is sometimes known as _mountain     magnolia_.   UMBRELLA TREE (_Magnolia tripetala_)  Distinguishing characters: The _buds_, Fig. 80, are extremely _long_,     often one and a half inches, have a _purple color_ and _are smooth_.     The tree does not grow to large size and produces an open spreading     head. Its leaves, twelve to eighteen inches long, are larger than     those of the other magnolia trees. The tree is sometimes called     _elkwood_.   BLACK LOCUST (_Robinia pseudacacia_)  Distinguishing characters: The *bark* of the trunk is _rough_ and     _deeply ridged_, as shown in Fig. 81.
