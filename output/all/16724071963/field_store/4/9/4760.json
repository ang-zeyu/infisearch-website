The larch differs from the bald cypress in the broader form of its     crown and the cluster-like arrangement of its leaves. The twigs of     the bald cypress are flat and feathery. The larch and bald cypress     have the common characteristics of both shedding their leaves in     winter and preferring to grow in moist or swampy soils. The larch,     especially the native species, forms the well-known tamarack swamps     of the north. The bald cypress grows in a similar way in groups in     the southern swamps.   BALD CYPRESS (_Taxodium distichum_)  Distinguishing characters: The *feathery character* of the *twigs*, Fig.     16, and the *spire-like form* of the tree, Fig. 17, which is taller     and more slender than the larch, will distinguish this species from     others.  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Cypress \"Knees.\"]  Leaf: The leaves drop off in October, though the tree is of the     cone-bearing kind. In this respect it is like the larch.  Form and size: Tall and pyramidal.  Range: The cypress is a southern tree, but is found under cultivation in     parks and on lawns in northern United States.  Soil and location: Grows naturally in swamps, but will also do well in     ordinary well-drained, good soil. In its natural habitat it sends     out special roots above water. These are known as \"_cypress knees_\"     (Fig. 18) and serve to provide air to the submerged roots of the     tree.  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: An excellent tree for park and lawn planting.  Commercial value: The wood is light, soft, and easily worked. It is used     for general construction, interior finish, railroad ties, posts and     cooperage.  Other characters: The _bark_ is thin and scaly. The _fruit_ is a cone     about an inch in diameter. The general _color_ of the tree is a     dull, deep green which, however, turns orange brown in the fall.  Comparisons: The cypress and the larch are apt to be confused,     especially in the winter, when the leaves of both have dropped. The     cypress is more slender and is taller in form. The leaves of each     are very different, as will be seen from the accompanying     illustrations.    GROUP V. THE HORSECHESTNUT, ASH AND MAPLE  How to tell them from other trees: The horsechestnut, ash, and maple     have their branches and buds arranged on their stems *opposite* each     other as shown in Figs. 20, 22 and 24. In other trees, this     arrangement is *alternate*, as shown in Fig. 19.  How to tell these three from each other. If the bud is large--an inch to     an inch and a half long--dark brown, and _sticky_, it is a     _horsechestnut_.      If the bud is _not sticky_, much smaller, and _rusty brown to black_     in color, and the ultimate twigs, of an olive green color, are     _flattened_ at points below the buds, it is an _ash_.  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Alternate Branching (Beech.)]      If it is not a horsechestnut nor an ash and its small buds have     many scales covering them, the specimen with branches and buds     opposite must then be a _maple_. Each of the maples has one     character which distinguishes it from all the other maples. For the     sugar maple, this distinguishing character is the _sharp point of     the bud_. For the silver maple it is the _bend in the terminal     twig_. For the red maple it is the _smooth gray-colored bark_. For     the Norway maple it is the _reddish brown color of the full, round     bud_, and for the box elder it is the _greenish color of its     terminal twig_.      The form of the tree and the leaves are also characteristic in each     of the maples, but for the beginner who does not wish to be burdened     with too many of these facts at one time, those just enumerated     will be found most certain and most easily followed.  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Opposite Branching (Horsechestnut.)]   THE HORSECHESTNUT (_Aesculus hippocastanum_)  Distinguishing characters: The *sticky* nature of the *terminal bud* and     its *large size* (about an inch long). The bud is dark brown in     color. See Fig. 20.  Leaf: Five to seven leaflets, usually seven. Fig. 21.  Form and size: Medium-sized tree, pyramidal head and coarse twigs.  Range: Europe and eastern United States.  Soil and location: Prefers a deep, rich soil.  Enemies: The leaves are the favorite food of caterpillars and are     subject to a blight which turns them brown prematurely. The trunk is     often attacked by a disease which causes the flow of a slimy     substance.  Value for planting: On account of its showy flowers, the horsechestnut     is a favorite for the park and lawn.  Commercial value: The wood is not durable and is not used commercially.  Other characters: The _flowers_ appear in large white clusters in May     and June. The _fruit_ is large, round, and prickly.  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Leaf of the Horsechestnut.]  Comparisons: The _red horsechestnut_ differs from this tree in having     red flowers. The _buckeye_ is similar to the horsechestnut, but its     bud is not sticky and is of a lighter gray color, while the leaf     generally has only five leaflets.   THE WHITE ASH (_Fraxinus americana_)  Distinguishing characters: The terminal *twigs* of glossy olive green     color are *flattened* below the bud. Fig. 22. The bud is     rusty-brown.  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Twig of White Ash.]  Leaf: Five to nine leaflets. Fig. 23.  Form and size: A large tree with a straight trunk.  Range: Eastern North America.  Soil and location: Rich, moist soil.  Enemies: In cities it is very often attacked by sucking insects.  Value for planting: The white ash grows rapidly. On account of its     insect enemies in cities, it should be used more for forest planting     and only occasionally for ornament.  Commercial value: It has a heavy, tough, and strong wood, which is     valuable in the manufacture of cooperage stock, agricultural     implements, and carriages. It is superior in value to the black ash.  Other characters: The _bark_ is gray. The _flowers_ appear in May.  Comparisons: The white ash is apt to be confused with the _black ash_     (_Fraxinus nigra_), but differs from the latter in having a     lighter-colored bud. The bud of the black ash is black. The bark of     the white ash is darker in color and the terminal twigs are more     flattened than those of the black ash.  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Leaf of White Ash.]   SUGAR MAPLE (_Acer saccharum_)  Distinguishing characters: The *bud is sharp-pointed*, scaly, and     reddish brown. Fig. 24.  [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Twig of the Sugar Maple.]  Leaf: Has sharp points and round sinus. Fig. 25.  Form and size: The crown is oval when the tree is young and round in old     age. Fig. 26.  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: Moist and deep soil, and cool, shady positions.  Enemies: Subject to drouth, especially in cities. Is attacked by the     _sugar maple borer_ and the _maple phenacoccus_, a sucking insect.  Value for planting: Its rich and yellow color in the fall, and the fine     spread of its crown make it a desirable tree for the lawn,     especially in the country.  Commercial value: Its wood is hard and takes a good polish; used for     interior finish and furniture. The tree is also the source of maple     sugar. Fig. 27.  Other characters: The _bark_ is smooth in young trees and in old trees     it shags in large plates. The _flowers_ appear in the early part of     April.  Other common names: The sugar maple is sometimes called _rock maple_ or     _hard maple_.   SILVER MAPLE (_Acer saccharinum_)  Distinguishing characters: The tips of the *twigs curve upwards* (Fig.     28), the bark is scaly, and the leaves are very deeply cleft and are     silvery on the under side.  [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Leaf of Sugar Maple.]  Leaf: Deeply cleft and silvery under side. Fig. 29.  Form and size: A large tree with the main branches separating from the     trunk a few feet from the ground. The terminal twigs are long,     slender, and drooping.  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: Moist places.  Enemies: The _leopard moth_, a wood-boring insect, and the     _cottony-maple scale_, a sucking insect.  [Illustration: FIG. 26.--The Sugar Maple.]  Value for planting: Grows too rapidly and is too short-lived to be     durable.  Commercial value: Its wood is soft, weak, and little used.  Other characters: The _bark_ is light gray, smooth at first and scaly     later on. The scales are free at each end and attached in the     center. The _flowers_ appear before the leaves in the latter part of     March or early April.  [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Tapping the Sugar Maple.]  Other common names: The silver maple is sometimes known as _soft maple_     or _white maple_.   RED MAPLE (_Acer rubrum_)  [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Terminal Twig of Silver Maple.]  Distinguishing characters: The *bark is smooth and light gray*, like     that of the beech, on the upper branches in older trees, and in     young trees over the whole trunk. Fig. 30. The buds are in clusters,     and the terminal twigs, Fig. 31, are quite red.  [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Leaf of the Silver Maple.]  Leaf: Whitish underneath with three-pointed lobes. Fig. 32.  Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a narrow, round head.  Range: Eastern North America.  Soil and location: Prefers moist places.  Enemies: Leaf blotches (_Rhytisma acerinum_) which, however, are not     very injurious.  Value for planting: Suitable as a shade tree for suburban streets. Its     rich red leaves in the fall make it attractive for the lawn.  [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Bark of the Red Maple.]  Commercial value: Its wood is heavy, close-grained, and takes a good     polish. Used for furniture and fuel.  Other characters: The _bud_ is small, round, and red. The _flowers_     appear before the leaves are out in the early part of April.

[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Twig of Norway Maple.]  Comparisons: The red maple is apt to be confused with the silver maple,     but the latter can be distinguished by its turned-up twigs and scaly     bark over the whole trunk of the tree, which presents a sharp     contrast to the straight twig and smooth bark of the red maple. The     latter has a bark similar to the beech, but its branches are     _opposite_, while those of the beech are _alternate_.   NORWAY MAPLE (_Acer platanoides_)  Distinguishing characters: The bud, Fig. 33, is *oval and reddish-brown*     in color; when taken off, a *milky juice exudes*. The bark is close.     Fig. 34  [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Bark of Norway Maple.]  Leaf: Like the leaf of the sugar maple but thicker in texture and darker     in color. Fig. 35.  Form and size: A tall tree with a broad, round head.  Range: Europe and the United States.  Soil and location: Will grow in poor soil.  Enemies: Very few.  Value for planting: One of the best shade trees.  Commercial value: None.  Other characters: The _bark_ is close like that of the mockernut     hickory.  Comparisons: The Norway maple is apt to be confused with the _sycamore     maple_ (_Acer pseudoplatanus_), but differs from the latter in     having a reddish bud instead of a green bud, and a close bark     instead of a scaly bark.   BOX ELDER (_Acer negundo_)  Distinguishing characters: The terminal *twigs are green*, and the buds     are round and small. Fig. 36.  Leaf: Has three to seven leaflets.  [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Leaf of Norway Maple.]  Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a short trunk and wide-spreading     top.  Range: Eastern United States to the Rocky Mountains.  Soil and location: Grows rapidly in deep, moist soil and river valleys,     but accommodates itself to the dry and poor soil conditions of the     city.  [Illustration: Figure 36.--Twig of the Box Elder.]  Enemies: Few.  Value for planting: Used as a shade tree in the Middle West, but the     tree is so ill formed and so short-lived that it is not to be     recommended.  Commercial value: None. The wood is soft.  Other characters: The _bark_ of the trunk is smooth and yellowish-green     in young trees and grayish brown in older specimens. The _flowers_     appear in the early part of April. The _fruit_ takes the form of     yellowish-green keys which hang on the tree till late fall.  Other common names: The box elder is also commonly known as the     _ash-leaf maple_.    GROUP VI. TREES TOLD BY THEIR FORM: ELM, POPLAR, GINGKO AND WILLOW  How to tell them from other trees: The trees described in this group are     so distinctive in their general _form_ that they may, for the     purpose of study, be grouped together, and distinguished from all     other trees by this characteristic.  How to tell them from each other: The American elm is _vase-like_ in     shape; the Lombardy poplar is narrow and _spire-like_; the gingko,     or maidenhair tree, is _odd_ in its mode of _branching_; and the     weeping willow is extremely _pendulous_.   AMERICAN ELM (_Ulmus americana_)  Distinguishing characters: The tree can be told at a glance by its     general branching habit. The limbs arch out into a wide-spreading     *fan or vase-like crown* which loses itself in numerous fine     drooping branchlets. See Fig. 37.  [Illustration: FIG. 37.--American Elm.]  Leaf: The leaves are simple, alternate, and from 2 to 5 inches long.  [Illustration: FIG. 38.--English Elm in Winter.]  Form and size: It is a tall tree with a trunk that divides a short     distance above ground. Its general contour, together with the     numerous branches that interlace its massive crown, give the elm an     interesting and stately appearance which is unequaled by any other     tree.  [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Lombardy Poplar.]  Range: Eastern North America.  Soil and location: The elm prefers a deep, rich and moist soil, but will     adapt itself even to the poor soil of the city street.  Enemies: _The leopard moth_, a wood-boring insect, and the _elm leaf     beetle_, a leaf-eating insect, are the two most important enemies of     the tree. Their ravages are very extensive.  Value for planting: The tree has a character of its own which cannot be     duplicated for avenue or lawn planting.  Commercial value: The wood is strong and tough and therefore has a     special value for cooperage, agricultural implements, carriages, and     shipbuilding.  Other characters: The _buds_ are small, brown, and smooth, while those     of the European elms are covered with down. The _small side twigs_     come out at almost right angles to the larger terminal twigs, which     is not the case in other species of elm.  [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Leaf of Carolina Poplar.]  Other common names: _White elm_.  Comparisons: The _English elm_ (_Ulmus campestris_) is also a tall,     dignified tree commonly seen under cultivation in America, but may     be told from the American species by the difference in their general     contour. The branches of the English species spread out but do not     arch like those of the American elm, and the bark of the English elm     is darker and coarser, Fig. 38. Little tufts of dead twigs along the     main branches and trunk of the tree are characteristic of the     English elm and will frequently help to distinguish it from the     American elm.      The _Camperdown elm_ may be recognized readily by its dwarf size and     its low drooping umbrella-shaped crown.   LOMBARDY OR ITALIAN POPLAR (_Populus nigra, var. italica_)  Distinguishing characters: Its *tall, slender, spire-like form* and     rigidly *erect branches*, which commence low on the trunk, make this     tree very distinct at all seasons of the year. See Fig. 39.  Leaf: Triangular in shape, similar to that of the Carolina poplar but     smaller, see Fig. 40.  Range: Asia, Europe, and North America.  Soil and location: The poplar is easily grown in poor soil, in any     location, and is very hardy.  Value for planting: The tree has a distinctive form which makes it     valuable for special landscape effects. It is also used for shelter     belts and screening. Like all poplars it is short lived and will     stand pruning well.  Commercial value: None.  [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Carolina Poplar.]  Comparisons: The _Carolina poplar_, or Cottonwood (_Populus deltoides_)     can be told from the Lombardy poplar by its wider crown and its more     open branching, Fig. 41. It may be recognized by its big terminal     twigs, which are light yellow in color and coarser than those of the     Lombardy poplar, Fig. 42. Its bark is smooth, light and     yellowish-green in young trees, and dark gray and fissured in older     specimens. Its large, conical, glossy, chestnut-brown bud is also     characteristic, Fig. 42. Its flowers, in the form of large catkins,     a peculiarity of all poplars, appear in the early spring. The     Carolina poplar is commonly planted in cities because it grows     rapidly and is able to withstand the smoke and drouth conditions of     the city. Where other trees, however, can be substituted with     success, the poplar should be avoided. Its very fast growth is     really a point against the tree, because it grows so fast that it     becomes too tall for surrounding property, and its wood being     extremely soft and brittle, the tree frequently breaks in     windstorms. In many cases it is entirely uprooted, because it is not     a deep-rooted tree. Its larger roots, which spread near the     surface, upset the sidewalk or prevent the growth of other     vegetation on the lawn, while its finer rootlets, in their eager     search for moisture, penetrate and clog the joints of neighboring     water and sewer pipes. The tree is commonly attacked by the     _oyster-shell scale_, an insect which sucks the sap from its bark     and which readily spreads to other more valuable trees like the elm.     The female form of this tree is even more objectionable than the     male, because in the early spring the former produces an abundance     of cotton from its seeds which litters the ground and often makes     walking dangerous. The only justification for planting the Carolina     poplar is in places where the conditions for tree growth are so poor     that nothing else will grow, and in those cases the tree should be     cut back periodically in order to keep it from becoming too tall and     scraggly. It is also desirable for screening in factory districts     and similar situations.  [Illustration: FIG. 42.--Bud of the Carolina Poplar.]      The _silver_ or _white poplar_ (_Populus alba_) may be told from the     other poplars by its characteristic smooth, _whitish-green bark_,     often spotted with dark blotches, Fig. 43. The _leaves are     silvery-white_ and downy on the under side. The twigs are dark green     in color and densely covered with a white down. It grows to very     large size and forms an irregular, wide-spreading, broad head, which     is characteristically different from that of any of the other     poplars.  [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Bark of the Silver Poplar.]      The _quaking aspen_ (_Populus tremuloides_), the _large-toothed     aspen_ (_Populus grandidentata_) and the _balsam poplar_ or _balm of     Gilead_ (_Populus balsamifera_) are other common members of the     poplar group. The quaking aspen may be told by its reddish-brown     twigs, narrow sharp-pointed buds, and by its small finely toothed     leaves. The large-toothed aspen has thicker and rather downy buds     and broader and more widely toothed leaves. The balsam poplar has a     large bud thickly covered with a sticky, pungent, gelatinous     substance.   GINGKO OR MAIDENHAIR TREE (_Gingko biloba_)  [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Gingko Trees.]  Distinguishing characters: The *peculiar branches* of this tree *emer"]]]
