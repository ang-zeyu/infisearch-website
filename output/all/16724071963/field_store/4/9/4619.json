I can not see one tittle of evidence that the great unknown stands to us in the light of a Father.\" Nor could he. Religious truth is conditioned in a way in which the apprehension of physical truth is not. There must be a certain condition of the heart, conscience, and will to see the truth of the Godhead of Christ. One may resist this evidence.[2] Only a living Christian is competent to look at the subject--\"unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God.\" In physics \"nothing is needed but open eyes and a sound understanding.\"[3] Moral character has nothing to do with it, except as vice may affect vision and deteriorate the judgment. But in a soul's relation to the Christian religion, the ethical element is that which is fundamental. \"The pure in heart shall see God.\" The foul soul has no vision for the eternal purities. In the days of idolatry \"there was no open vision.\" So in the heart of sin there is no light of spiritual truth. The higher verities appear fully founded to the Christian consciousness only.  [Footnote 2: Cf. Denney.]  [Footnote 3: Cf. Denney.]  [Sidenote: Natural Ethical Canon.]  Yet, let us remember that below this Christian consciousness lie the substrata of reason and ethical canon common to all men. Religious truth rests on these in its first revelations. Above the first and simplest revelation, truth rests on Christian experience as to those matters for which reason and natural ethical canon are insufficient.  [Sidenote: General Calm of Methodist Episcopal Church.]  [Sidenote: Wesley's Advanced Views.]  This having been the teaching of the Methodist Episcopal Church from the beginning, she has been little disturbed by the critical school. While holding that the Bible is the sole rule of faith, she has not committed herself to any one theory of inspiration. She has not believed the Scriptures because they are written, but, being written, she has found them true. She has believed in the supernatural power of the Gospel because in her sight its leaven has wrought in the individual and in society what it claims for itself. John Wesley believed that there were God-breathed teachings outside of the Bible. He believed this because of his feeling that the Divine Fatherhood must have spoken to other than His Jewish children. Inheriting from our founder these thoughts, we have kept a high degree of calm in these later days of inquiry and doubt.  [Sidenote: Wide Range of Unbelief.]  [Sidenote: Natural Immortality.]  [Sidenote: Reward and Punishments.]  We have already admitted that the present tendency to unbelief has wider range and fresher foundations than our fathers knew. The belief in the natural immortality of the human soul whether of Platonic or Christian origin is shaken to an extent not known in a century. The doubts of Huxley, the denials of HÃ¦ckel had a purely scientific basis. The suspension of consciousness by sleep, by accident, by drugs, the decay of mind by old age and by disease are freely put forth as proofs that mind can not exist without the mechanism which supports and manifests it. If this last be true a doctrine fundamental to Christianity must be abandoned. The doctrine of immortality through Christ does not meet the new objections. The scheme of redemption and the doctrine of future rewards and punishments are involved in the fate of the doctrine of natural immortality. We have thus shadows of doubt thrown upon two great doctrines, the virgin birth of Christ and natural immortality. The miracles, Resurrection, and Ascension must be added to the shadowed list.  [Sidenote: Some Influential Facts.]  [Sidenote: A Great Mistake.]  [Sidenote: Doctored Heathenism.]  Whatever relation the fact may have as a cause, it is noteworthy that as to time, this new era of doubt largely coincides as to its beginning with the movement to revise the New Testament. The variations of the manuscripts, the interpretations, the comparatively late date of the oldest manuscripts were before this in possession of scholars only. The daily press have made them the possession of the Christian world. The shock to traditional confidence through this was very great. The Congress of Religions at Chicago had a similar effect. The mistaken liberality which permitted Christianity to appear on the same platform with the ethnic and imperfect religions contributed largely to doctrinal indifference. The taking and uncandid misrepresentations of these religions convinced many that there was at least no better foundation for Christianity and no better content therein than for and in the false and imperfect faiths. Many of these were defended by men who had had an English education and had come into contact with Christian vocabulary and civilization. They did not hesitate to read into these religions ideas wholly Christian and wholly foreign to the original teachings.  [Sidenote: What Remains?]  These and other considerations lead me to ask what remains that we may and do believe? While far from admitting as finally proved the radical conclusions reached by some as to authorship and inspiration of the Bible and Divine authority for doctrines deduced therefrom, it must be profitable for us to ask, \"What remains if some of these conclusions stand?\"  Recall that I do not admit all these for a moment, or any of them as final. Some are probably true. But taking the worst and most iconoclastic as true, are we compelled even then to surrender our Christian faith?  [Sidenote: The Apostles' Creed.]  Let us take the separate articles of the Apostles' Creed and see how they stand affected:  [Sidenote: The Fatherhood of God.]  \"I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.\"  [Sidenote: A Christian God.]  Surely this remains untouched and in full force. Huxley, to requote what has before been quoted, says: \"I can not see one tittle of evidence that the great unknown stands to us in the light of a Father.\" What a contradiction is here! He knows that the great unknown can not be proved to be our Father. Then he must know of the great unknown the negative aspects so minutely as to be sure that no Fatherhood is in the great unknown. Then he knows the great unknown much better than he is willing to admit, better than an agnostic ought.  [Sidenote: An All Pervasive Spirit.]  [Sidenote: His Commandments.]  [Sidenote: The Divine Ideal.]  Yet that the idea of God may remain in power and not as a \"passionless impersonality,\" it must be less interpreted by the teachings of Moses and more by the teachings of Christ. Human tempers and passions must be eliminated from our Divine Ideal. He must not be made an angry and jealous God as men count these. He must not be thought of as a vindictive personality, never so well pleased as when scaring His children into panic. In the thought of the Church He will be an all-pervasive Spirit whose nature is unfolded by the universe He has made. In that universe He will be felt to be immanent as the power of development, order, and destiny. All ages show Him to be \"the power which makes for righteousness.\" The commandments are not only His because they are found in the Bible, but because they are perceived to be necessary laws of conduct proceeding from such a Being as we know God to be for such beings as we know men to be. Thus we perceive them to be the Divinely authorized bond of society and the guarantee and obligation of the Divine Ideal of humanity. All nature and all history are scrutinized for traces of the Supreme. These being found to coincide with the Christian Revelation of Him, men will read with new reverence those wonderful books which make up the Book, and which beyond all others anticipate the latest results of scientific inquiry and natural ethical canon.  [Sidenote: Advantage of Newer View.]  Out of this will come such a sense of the Divine Presence as the Church and the individual Christian have not hitherto known. Moral distance from God will be the only distance. \"In Him we live and move and have our being\" comes to full interpretation through this thought of God. Humanity is immersed in Him.  [Sidenote: Transcendent.]  [Sidenote: Huxley Against Hume.]  But this immanent God is also seen to be transcendent. He is in nature and far beyond it. Vast as nature is, it is limited. God is the unlimited. Within this region of transcendence is room for all His gracious activities as distinguished from His natural activities; room for marvel and miracle if He will and we need. When Huxley abandons Hume's _a priori_ argument against miracles it is not worth while for others to use it. Fewer doubt the existence of a God, I believe, than at any time since men sought to prove that He does not exist. The Fatherly in God is proved both by His work in nature and by those works of grace which the student of nature alone can not see. God is a spirit. The human spirit refined, purified, sees Him in proportion to its purification.  [Sidenote: Modern Christology.]  [Sidenote: Former Limitations.]  [Sidenote: Ritual Statement.]  [Sidenote: Aim of Christianity.]  [Sidenote: Likeness to God.]  In respect of \"Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord,\" it may, it must, be said He remains in full and glorious vigor as the Redeemer of mankind. The marked difference between our time and a half-century ago with respect to Christ is in the extension, rather than the diminution of His relation to salvation and the extension of the idea of salvation itself. In the former days men's eyes were almost wholly fixed on His death and its relation to salvation in the future life. Seldom indeed was the value of the following text taken into consideration: \"For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved by His life.\" There is less disposition to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15861"],["title","The Things Which Remain (#2)"],["body","as to theories of the atonement. Most, I think, come to feel that no one view contains the full significance of Christ's death. Have you noticed how the Ritual puts it in the order of the Lord's Supper? \"Didst give Thine only Son Jesus Christ to suffer death upon the cross for our Redemption; who made there [on the cross] by His oblation of Himself once offered a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world.\" The men who wrote that struggled to interpret His death by every possible phase of its meaning. In our time we have come to see that the aim of Christ and Christianity is to develop character and that this must be gained in time that we may be ready for eternity. Thus the death of Christ as the ultimate of self-sacrifice persuades us to the death of sin in us that we may live renewed in God; \"rise from our dead selves to higher things.\" His life persuades us as the condition and example of growth to move on from the first self-surrender into the habit and fact of constant obedience and therefore \"into the likeness of God's dear Son.\"  The consciousness, well-nigh universal, of the nobility of self-sacrifice is that which gives vitality and vogue among the masses to the doctrine of the atonement. Self-sacrifice becomes more rare as wealth and refinement modify men and women. He that has much is loath to lose or leave it. Hence the rich generally fight in security. The poor meet the bullets first.  Bad as is the conduct of some trades-unionists, it is among these toilers that great deeds of sympathy and generosity are done. How they tax themselves to help each other! How their women work for each other when one is unable to care for herself or her children! Their doctrine that \"an injury to one is a wrong to all\" has much that is Christlike in it. Let us who believe in an atoning Christ rejoice that as long as men honor bravery--self-sacrifice unto death for country, home, or the life of dear ones; as long as they build monuments to generals, soldiers, firemen, physicians who die for others, so will the world be slow to disbelieve the doctrine that \"Jesus Christ tasted death for every man.\"  [Sidenote: John's Logos.]  [Sidenote: An Anthropomorphic God.]  More, too, is made of His life before the Incarnation. The pre-existence of Christ is an essential element in Christianity. \"His eternal relation to God is the only way of conceiving Him which answers to His real greatness.\"[4] The Christ was present and active in the creation. John's use of the word \"Logos\" is right. \"Logos\" is not merely a result but a Force. It is not only the speech, but the speaker. Let us admit once for all that the fact, much belabored of the critics, is a fact. Let us not be afraid of the word which expresses it. God must be anthropomorphic if He exists. We can come nowhere near to thinking out any other kind of God. Christ has the value of God to devout Christians because in the fullness of His moral perfections He expresses God so far as we can know Him and man so far as man can hope and grow.  [Footnote 4: Denney. Studies in Theology.]  [Sidenote: How Son of God.]  Is His Sonship different from ours, or only an expansion of the fullness and perfection of our sonship? This last seems to me a most important question. If He was born as we were born--that is, as to the beginning of His earthly life, there can be no pre-eminent sense in which He was the Son of God. He was either a happy accident of natural birth or a \"sport\" in evolution.  [Sidenote: The Virgin Birth.]  This brings us to that doctrine which is the greatest challenge to the doubter: \"Conceived by the Holy Ghost; born of the Virgin Mary,\"--a doctrine fiercely fought by Harnack and yet by no means to be dismissed as he dismisses it. His teaching on this point seems to me the result of his theory of Christianity. If one seeks to rid Christianity of the supernatural, here is the place to begin.  [Sidenote: Dignity of the Story.]  [Sidenote: A Greater Puzzle.]  But who will not feel the force of the position that, granted God was to be incarnate, the story of Christ's incarnation is the noblest and most probable? He is not born of a man's lust nor of a woman's desire--but of the submission of untainted womanhood to the direct creative power of God. The alternative to this is the Divinest man in all the world born of sinning and not yet married parents. If the new doctrine of heredity be true that men may inherit good as well as evil, we still have an astounding fact to account for; namely, the birth of such a child from such conditions, that is, with all the good kept in and all the bad left out.  [Sidenote: Parthenogenesis a Fact.]  When men speak of a virgin birth as incredible and impossible and as the weakest of all Christian doctrine, do they know or have they forgotten that parthenogenesis (virgin birth) is a fact in nature; existing, for example, in as highly organized insects as the honey bee? There are other insects which are parthenogenetic at one time and sexually productive at another. There are also hints of it in human life known to anatomists which can not be fully discussed here.  [Sidenote: Among the Bees.]  [Sidenote: A Small Departure from Nature.]  The virgin queen bee produces males in abundance, but can not produce females until she has made her nuptial flight and met her mate in an embrace invariably fatal to him. Nor does she ever need to meet another. From that time on, she is the fruitful mother of every kind of bee life the hive needs; the undeveloped females called neuters and those who become queens by being fed on royal food. Virgin birth is therefore imbedded in nature's order. To occur in the human species nature need call in no novelty. Christ, if born of a virgin, was born with the smallest possible departure from the order of nature. A process known in a lower form of life was carried into the higher to produce the unique being called for by the spiritual needs of mankind.         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: The Historical Statement.]  Passing over the historical assertions which follow the doctrine of the virgin birth, \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried,\" because there is nothing in these statements difficult or incredible, we reach the doctrine of His resurrection, \"the third day He rose from the dead,\" a doctrine next to that of the virgin birth in natural difficulty of acceptance.  [Sidenote: Christ's Resurrection.]  [Sidenote: Surprise of Disciples.]  [Sidenote: The Fact Accounts for History.]  Faith in this seems to me to depend on how far we have accepted Christ's Deity and His incarnation. If by the Holy Ghost we have been able \"to say that Jesus is the Lord;\" if by that blessed energy we perceive His Divine mastership; if by the same energy we feel that He has transformed us into the image of His dear Son; raising us \"from the death of sin into the life of righteousness\" it is not difficult to believe that Jesus \"the power of the Resurrection\" rose from the dead. \"The fact of the Resurrection and belief in the fact is not explicable by any antecedent conditions apart from its truth.\"[5] The disciples did not expect what they saw. His death was for them so far as we can see, without hope. They were not able yet to interpret His prophecy that He would build again His temple, nor understand the spirituality of His kingdom. These facts seem to me utterly to demolish the theory of a vision called up by eager, yea, agonizing, expectation. The idea of the Resurrection justifies His prophecies as to Himself and the fact accounts, better than any theory which denies the fact, for the faith and founding of the early Church as well as for the course of subsequent history and of the believer's experience.  [Footnote 5: Westcott. The Revelation of the Risen Lord.]         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: Slow Belief in Resurrection.]  It is much to see that belief became belief only with great difficulty. The idea of the Resurrection was strange and alarming to the disciples. \"They were terrified and affrighted and supposed they beheld a spirit.\" Slowly by tests of sense as well as by persuasions of teaching did the disciples come to believe that the Christ of the Resurrection was the same Christ who suffered on the cross.  [Sidenote: Not an Invention.]  [Sidenote: An Eye-witness Story.]  It seems impossible that the Resurrection could have been an invention or that the account of it could be a work of the imagination. The last is almost as great a miracle as the Resurrection itself. In detail, in naturalness, even in the presence of difficulties and hindrances to easy belief of the story, the narrative seems that of an eye-witness. No reasoning can bring faith, however, to one who denies the miraculous. As a fact, the Resurrection is incapable of naturalistic explanation. To those who deny the miraculous I can only again point out how Huxley cuts out the _a priori_ argument from Hume as worthless. As quoted in his biography, Huxley says: \"We are not justified in the _a priori_ assertion that the order of nature, as experience has revealed it to us, can not change. The assumption is illegitimate because it involves the whole point in dispute.\"         *       *       *       *       *  [Sidenote: Ascent into Heaven.]  [Sidenote: The Ascension.]  [Sidenote: Nature not Wholly Love.]  [Sidenote: Evil and Good.]  Necessarily miraculous also is the doctrine, \"He ascended into heaven.\" In this He passed from the visible into the invisible; from the conditions of human life to those of the life of a spirit; from the work of redemption to that of intercession. If His resurrection be accepted, His ascension presents no difficulties to faith. This, with His incarnation, and the facts of His earthly life are the manifestation of the tender side of God to the senses even as His wisdom and power are shown to the senses by the facts"]]]
