How can we tell that a sensation arises when a nervous impulse has been carried along a sensory nerve and has reached the brain, if every mind is shut up to the charmed circle of its own ideas?  The anatomist and the physiologist give us very detailed accounts of the sense-organs and of the brain; the physiologist even undertakes to measure the speed with which the impulse passes along a nerve; the psychologist accepts and uses the results of their labors.  But can all this be done in the absence of any first-hand knowledge of the things of which one is talking?  Remember that, if the psychologist is right, any external object, eye, ear, nerve, or brain, which we can perceive directly, is a mental complex, a something in the mind and not external at all.  How shall we prove that there are objects, ears, eyes, nerves, and brains,--in short, all the requisite mechanism for the calling into existence of sensations,--in an outer world which is not immediately perceived but is only inferred to exist?  I do not wish to be regarded as impugning the right of the psychologist to make the assumptions which he does, and to work as he does.  He has a right to assume, with the plain man, that there is an external world and that we know it.  But a very little reflection must make it manifest that he seems, at least, to be guilty of an inconsistency, and that he who wishes to think clearly should strive to see just where the trouble lies.  So much, at least, is evident: the man who is inclined to doubt whether there is, after all, any real external world, appears to find in the psychologist's distinction between ideas and things something like an excuse for his doubt.  To get to the bottom of the matter and to dissipate his doubt one has to go rather deeply into metaphysics.  I merely wish to show just here that the doubt is not a gratuitous one, but is really suggested to the thoughtful mind by a reflection upon our experience of things.  And, as we are all apt to think that the man of science is less given to busying himself with useless subtleties than is the philosopher, I shall, before closing this chapter, present some paragraphs upon the subject from the pen of a professor of mathematics and mechanics.  14. THE \"TELEPHONE EXCHANGE.\"--\"We are accustomed to talk,\" writes Professor Karl Pearson,[1] \"of the 'external world,' of the 'reality' outside us.  We speak of individual objects having an existence independent of our own.  The store of past sense-impressions, our thoughts and memories, although most probably they have beside their psychical element a close correspondence with some physical change or impress in the brain, are yet spoken of as _inside_ ourselves.  On the other hand, although if a sensory nerve be divided anywhere short of the brain, we lose the corresponding class of sense impression, we yet speak of many sense-impressions, such as form and texture, as existing outside ourselves.  How close then can we actually get to this supposed world outside ourselves?  Just as near but no nearer than the brain terminals of the sensory nerves.  We are like the clerk in the central telephone exchange who cannot get nearer to his customers than his end of the telephone wires.  We are indeed worse off than the clerk, for to carry out the analogy properly we must suppose him _never to have been outside the telephone exchange, never to have seen a customer or any one like a customer--in short, never, except through the telephone wire, to have come in contact with the outside universe_.  Of that 'real' universe outside himself he would be able to form no direct impression; the real universe for him would be the aggregate of his constructs from the messages which were caused by the telephone wires in his office.  About those messages and the ideas raised in his mind by them he might reason and draw his inferences; and his conclusions would be correct--for what?  For the world of telephonic messages, for the type of messages that go through the telephone.  Something definite and valuable he might know with regard to the spheres of action and of thought of his telephonic subscribers, but outside those spheres he could have no experience.  Pent up in his office he could never have seen or touched even a telephonic subscriber _in himself_.  Very much in the position of such a telephone clerk is the conscious _ego_ of each one of us seated at the brain terminals of the sensory nerves. Not a step nearer than those terminals can the _ego_ get to the 'outer world,' and what in and for themselves are the subscribers to its nerve exchange it has no means of ascertaining.  Messages in the form of sense-impressions come flowing in from that 'outside world,' and these we analyze, classify, store up, and reason about.  But of the nature of 'things-in-themselves,' of what may exist at the other end of our system of telephone wires, we know nothing at all.  \"But the reader, perhaps, remarks, 'I not only see an object, but I can _touch_ it.  I can trace the nerve from the tip of my finger to the brain.  I am not like the telephone clerk, I can follow my network of wires to their terminals and find what is at the other end of them.' Can you, reader?  Think for a moment whether your _ego_ has for one moment got away from his brain exchange.  The sense-impression that you call touch was just as much as sight felt only at the brain end of a sensory nerve.  What has told you also of the nerve from the tip of your finger to your brain?  Why, sense-impressions also, messages conveyed along optic or tactile sensory nerves.  In truth, all you have been doing is to employ one subscriber to your telephone exchange to tell you about the wire that goes to a second, but you are just as far as ever from tracing out for yourself the telephone wires to the individual subscriber and ascertaining what his nature is in and for himself.  The immediate sense-impression is just as far removed from what you term the 'outside world' as the store of impresses.  If our telephone clerk had recorded by aid of a phonograph certain of the messages from the outside world on past occasions, then if any telephonic message on its receipt set several phonographs repeating past messages, we have an image analogous to what goes on in the brain. Both telephone and phonograph are equally removed from what the clerk might call the 'real outside world,' but they enable him through their sounds to construct a universe; he projects those sounds, which are really inside his office, outside his office, and speaks of them as the external universe.  This outside world is constructed by him from the contents of the inside sounds, which differ as widely from things-in-themselves as language, the symbol, must always differ from the thing it symbolizes.  For our telephone clerk sounds would be the real world, and yet we can see how conditioned and limited it would be by the range of his particular telephone subscribers and by the contents of their messages.  \"So it is with our brain; the sounds from telephone and phonograph correspond to immediate and stored sense-impressions.  These sense-impressions we project as it were outwards and term the real world outside ourselves.  But the things-in-themselves which the sense-impressions symbolize, the 'reality,' as the metaphysicians wish to call it, at the other end of the nerve, remains unknown and is unknowable.  Reality of the external world lies for science and for us in combinations of form and color and touch--sense-impressions as widely divergent from the thing 'at the other end of the nerve' as the sound of the telephone from the subscriber at the other end of the wire.  We are cribbed and confined in this world of sense-impressions like the exchange clerk in his world of sounds, and not a step beyond can we get.  As his world is conditioned and limited by his particular network of wires, so ours is conditioned by our nervous system, by our organs of sense.  Their peculiarities determine what is the nature of the outside world which we construct.  It is the similarity in the organs of sense and in the perceptive faculty of all normal human beings which makes the outside world the same, or _practically_ the same, for them all.  To return to the old analogy, it is as if two telephone exchanges had very nearly identical groups of subscribers. In this case a wire between the two exchanges would soon convince the imprisoned clerks that they had something in common and peculiar to themselves.  That conviction corresponds in our comparison to the recognition of other consciousness.\"  I suggest that this extract be read over carefully, not once but several times, and that the reader try to make quite clear to himself the position of the clerk in the telephone exchange, _i.e._ the position of the mind in the body, as depicted by Professor Pearson, before recourse is had to the criticisms of any one else.  One cannot find anywhere better material for critical philosophical reflection.  As has been seen, our author accepts without question, the psychological doctrine that the mind is shut up within the circle of the messages that are conducted to it along the sensory nerves, and that it cannot directly perceive anything truly external.  He carries his doctrine out to the bitter end in the conclusion that, since we have never had experience of anything beyond sense-impressions, and have no ground for an inference to anything beyond, we must recognize that the only external world of which we know anything is an external world built up out of sense-impressions.  It is, thus, in the mind, and is not external at all; it is only \"projected outwards,\" _thought of_ as though it were beyond us.  Shall we leave the inconsistent position of the plain man and of the psychologist and take our refuge in this world of projected mental constructs?  Before the reader makes up his mind to do this, I beg him to consider the following:--  (1) If the only"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],["title","The Life-Story of Insects (#0)"],["body","Cambridge Manuals of Science and                               Literature                          THE LIFE-STORY OF INSECTS                          CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS                       London: FETTER LANE, E.C.

Considerations of space forbid anything like an exhaustive treatment of so vast a subject, and some aspects of the question, the physiological for example, are almost neglected. Other books already published in this series, such as Dr Gordon Hewitt's _House-flies_ and Mr O H. Latter's _Bees and Wasps_, may be consulted with advantage for details of special insect life-stories. Recent researches have emphasised the practical importance to human society of entomological study, and insects will always be a source of delight to the lover of nature. This humble volume will best serve its object if its reading should lead fresh observers to the brookside and the woodland.  G.H.C.  DUBLIN,  _July_, 1913.

The schoolboy watches the tiny green caterpillars hatched from eggs laid on a cabbage leaf by the common white butterfly, or maybe rears successfully a batch of silkworms through the changes and chances of their lives, while the naturalist questions yet again the 'how' and 'why' of these common though wondrous life-stories, as he seeks to trace their course more fully than his predecessors knew.  [Illustration: Fig. 1. _a_, Diamond-back Moth (_Plutella cruciferarum_); _b_, young caterpillar, dorsal view; _c_, full-grown caterpillar, dorsal view; _d_, side view; _e_, pupa, ventral view. Magnified 6 times. From _Journ. Dept. Agric. Ireland_, vol. I.]  Everyone is familiar with the main facts of such a life-story as that of a moth or butterfly. The form of the adult insect (fig. 1 _a_) is dominated by the wings--two pairs of scaly wings, carried respectively on the middle and hindmost of the three segments that make up the _thorax_ or central region of the insect's body. Each of these three segments carries a pair of legs. In front of the thorax is the head on which the pair of long jointed feelers and the pair of large, sub-globular, compound eyes are the most prominent features. Below the head, however, may be seen, now coiled up like a watch-spring, now stretched out to draw the nectar from some scented blossom, the butterfly's sucking trunk or proboscis, situated between a pair of short hairy limbs or palps (fig. 2). These palps belong to the appendages of the hindmost segment of the head, appendages which in insects are modified to form a hind-lip or _labium_, bounding the mouth cavity below or behind. The proboscis is made up of the pair of jaw-appendages in front of the labium, the _maxillae_, as they are called. Behind the thorax is situated the _abdomen,_ made up of nine or ten recognisable segments, none of which carry limbs comparable to the walking legs, or to the jaws which are the modified limbs of the head-segments. The whole cuticle or outer covering of the body, formed (as is usual in the group of animals to which insects belong) of a horny (chitinous) secretion of the skin, is firm and hard, and densely covered with hairy or scaly outgrowths. Along the sides of the insect are a series of paired openings or spiracles, leading to a set of air-tubes which ramify throughout the body and carry oxygen directly to the tissues.  [Illustration: Fig. 2. A. Head of a typical Moth, showing proboscis formed by flexible maxillae (_g_) between the labial palps (_p_); _c_, face; _e_, eye; the structure _m_ has been regarded as the vestige of a mandible. B. Basal part (_b_) of maxilla removed from head, with vestigial palp (_p_). Magnified.]  Such a butterfly as we have briefly sketched lays an egg on the leaf of some suitable food-plant, and there is hatched from it the well-known crawling larva[1] (fig. 1 _b, c, d_) called a caterpillar, offering in many superficial features a marked contrast to its parent. Except on the head, whose surface is hard and firm, the caterpillar's cuticle is as a rule thin and flexible, though it may carry a protective armature of closely set hairs, or strong sharp spines. The feelers (fig. 3 _At_) are very short and the eyes are small and simple. In connection with the mouth, there are present in front of the maxillae a pair of _mandibles_ (fig. 3 _Mn_), strong jaws, adapted for biting solid food, which are absent from the adult butterfly, though well developed in cockroaches, dragon-flies, beetles, and many other insects. The three pairs of legs on the segments of the thorax are relatively short, and as many as five segments of the abdomen may carry short cylindrical limbs or pro-legs, which assist the clinging habits and worm-like locomotion of the caterpillar. No trace of wings is visible externally. The caterpillar, therefore, differs markedly from its parent in its outward structure, in its mode of progression, and in its manner of feeding; for while the butterfly sucks nectar or other liquid food, the caterpillar bites up and devours solid vegetable substances, such as the leaves of herbs or trees. It is well-known that between the close of its larval life and its attainment of perfection as a butterfly, the insect spends a period as a _pupa_ (fig. 1 _e_) unable to move from place to place, and taking no food.  [1] The term _larva_ is applied to any young animal which differs markedly from its parent.  [Illustration: Fig. 3.
