She then flung herself on the bed, put her two arms under her head, and gazed out of the window. Her heart was beating wildly; she had a strange medley of feelings within. She was desperately, madly lonely. She was homesick in the most intense sense of the word.  Kathleen had never left Carrigrohane Castle before. This romantic abode was situated in the extreme south-west of Ireland. It was a mile away from the sea, and stood on a rocky eminence which overlooked a very wide expanse of moor and wood, rushing streams and purple mountains, and deep dark-blue sea. In the whole world there could scarcely be found a more lovely view than that which since her birth had presented itself before Kathleen's young eyes. Her father, Squire O'Hara, was, as landlords in Ireland go, very well off. His tenantry adored him. He got in his rents with tolerable regularity. He was a good landlord, firm but also kind and indulgent. A real case of distress was never turned away from his doors, but where rent could be paid he insisted on the cottars giving him his due. He kept a rather wild establishment, however. His wife was an Irishwoman from a neighboring county, and had some of the most careless attributes of her race. The house got along anyhow. There were always shoals of visitors, mostly relatives. There were heavy feasts in the old hall, and sittings up very late at night, and no end of hunting and fishing and shooting in their seasons. In the summer a pretty white yacht made a great \"divartisement,\" as the Squire was fond of saying; and in all things Kathleen O'Hara was free as the air she breathed. She was educated in a sort of fashion by an Irish governess, but in reality she was allowed to pursue her lessons exactly as she liked best herself.  It was just before she was fifteen that Kathleen's aunt, a maiden lady from Dublin, who rejoiced in the truly Irish name of O'Flynn, came to see them, remarked on Kathleen's wild, unkempt appearance, declared that the girl would be a downright beauty when she was eighteen, said that no one would tolerate such a want of knowledge in the present day, and advised that she should go to school. Mrs. O'Hara took Miss O'Flynn's hint very much to heart. Kathleen was consulted, and of course tabooed the entire scheme; in the end, however, the elder ladies carried the day. Miss O'Flynn took her niece to Dublin with her, and gave her an expensive and very unnecessary wardrobe; and Mrs. O'Hara, having heard a great deal of Mrs. Tennant, who had Irish relatives, decided that Kathleen should go to the Great Shirley School, where she herself had been educated long ago. Everything was arranged in a great hurry. It seemed to Kathleen now, as she lay on her bed, kicking her feet impatiently, and ruffled her beautiful hair, that the thing had come to pass in a flash. It seemed only yesterday that she was at home in the old house, petted by the servants, adored by her father, worshipped by all her relatives--the young queen of the castle, free as the air, followed by her dogs, riding on her pony--and now she was here in this hideous, poor, fifth-class house, going to that ugly school.  \"I can't stand it,\" she thought. \"There's only one way out. I must have a real desperate burst of naughtiness. What shall I do that will most aggravate them? For do that thing I will, and as quickly as possible.\"  Kathleen thought rapidly. She had no brothers of her own, but their loss was made up for by the adoration of about twenty young cousins who were always loafing about the place and following Kathleen wherever she turned.  \"What would most aggravate Pat if he were here,\" thought the girl, \"or dear old Michael? Ah, well! Michael--\" The girl's face slightly changed. \"I was never _very_ naughty with Michael,\" she said to herself. \"He is different from the others. I wouldn't like to see that sort of sorry look in his dear dark-blue eyes. Oh, I mustn't think of Michael now. When I was going away he said, 'Bedad, you'll come back a princess, and I'll be proud to see you.' No, I mustn't think of Michael. Pat, the imp, would help me, and so would Rory, and so would Ted. But what shall it be?\"  She thought excitedly. There came a rattle at the handle of the door.  \"Let me in, please, Kathleen; let me in,\" called Alice's voice.  \"Presently, darling,\" replied Kathleen in her most nonchalant tone.  \"But I am in a hurry. I must be back at school by half-past two. Let me in immediately.\"  \"What a nuisance it all is!\" thought Kathleen. \"But, after all, my naughtiness needn't make that stupid old Alice late for her darling lessons.\"  She scrambled off the bed, drew back the bolt, and returned to her old position. Alice came quickly in. She glanced at Kathleen with disgust.  \"I wish you wouldn't lie on the bed in your muddy boots.\"  No answer.  \"I must ask you not to lock the door. It is my room as well as yours.\"  No answer. Kathleen's eyes were fixed on the window; they were brimful of mischief. After a time she said:  \"Darling.\"  \"I wish you wouldn't talk to me in that silly way.\"  \"Faith! honey, then.\"  \"I do wish--\"  Kathleen suddenly sprang upright on her bed.  \"Don't you like the sky when it looks as it does now? I wish you could see it from Carrigrohane. You don't know the sort of expression it has when it seems to be kissing the sea. We have a ghost at Carrigrohane. Oh, wisha, then, if you only could see it! I can tell the boys about it. Sha'n't I make them creep?\"  \"It is very silly to talk about ghosts. Nobody believes in them,\" said Alice.  \"I'll ask father if I may have you at Carrigrohane in the summer, and then see if you don't believe. She wears white.\"  \"I am going out now, Kathleen; aren't you coming with me?\"  \"No, thank you, my love.\"  \"You ought to, Kathleen. I am busy preparing for my scholarship examination or I would stay and argue with you. It is an awful pity to have gone to the expense of coming here if you don't mean to do your utmost.\"  \"Thank you, darling, but it is rather a waste of breath for you to talk so long to me. I mean to be naughty this afternoon.\"  \"I can't help you,\" said Alice. \"I am very sorry you ever came.\"  \"Thank you so much, dear.\"  Alice ran downstairs.  \"Mother,\" she said, rushing into her mother's presence, \"we shall have no end of trouble with that terrible girl. She is lying now on the bed with her outdoor boots on, and she won't come to school, or do a single thing I want her to.\"  \"The money her father pays will be very welcome, Alice. We must bear with some discomforts on account of that.\"  \"I suppose so,\" said Alice, shrugging her shoulders. \"How horrid it is to be poor, and to have such a girl as that in the house! Well, I can't stay another minute. You had better keep a sort of general eye on her, mother, for there's no saying what she will do. She has declared her intention of being naughty. She knows no fear, is not guided by any sort of principle, and would, in short, do anything.\"  \"Well, go to school, Alice, and be quick home, for I have a great deal I want you to help me with.\"  Alice made no reply, and Mrs. Tennant, after thinking for a minute, went upstairs. She knocked at the door of the room which she had given up to the two girls. There was no answer. She opened it and went in. The bird had flown. There were evident signs of a stampede through the window, for it stood wide open, and there were marks of not too clean boots on the drugget, and a torn piece of ivy just without. The window was twenty feet from the ground, and Kathleen must have let herself down by the sturdy arm of the old ivy. Mrs. Tennant looked out, half expecting to see a mangled body on the ground; but there was no one in view. She returned to her darning and her anxious thoughts.  She was a widow with two sons and a daughter, and something under two hundred and fifty pounds a year on which to live. To educate the boys, to do something for Alice, and to put bread-and-butter into all their mouths was a difficult problem to solve in these expensive days. She had on purpose moved close to the Great Shirley School in order to avail herself of its cheap education for Alice. The boys went to another foundation school near by; and altogether the family managed to scrape along. But the advent of Kathleen on the scene was a great relief, for her father paid three guineas a week for Mrs. Tennant's motherly care and for Kathleen's board and lodging.  \"Poor child!\" thought the good woman. \"What a wild, undisciplined, handsome creature she is! I must do what I can for her.\"  She sat on for some time darning and thinking. Her heart was full; she felt depressed. She had been working in various ways ever since six o'clock that morning, and the darning of the boys' rough socks hurt her eyes and made her fingers ache.  Meanwhile Kathleen was running along the road. She ran until she was completely out of breath. She then came to a stile, against which she leant. By-and-by she saw a girl walking leisurely up the road; she was a shabbily dressed and rather vulgar girl. Kathleen saw at once that she was one of the Great Shirley girls, so she went forward and spoke to her.  \"You go to our school, don't you?\" she said.  \"Yes, miss,\" answered the girl, dropping a little curtsy when she saw Kathleen. She was a very fresh foundation girl, and recognized something in Kathleen which caused her to be more subservient than was necessary.  \"Then, if you please,\" continued Kathleen, \"can you tell me where that sweetly pretty girl, Ruth Craven, lives?\"  \"She isn't a lady,\" said the girl, whose name was Susan Hopkins. \"She is no more a lady than I am.\"  \"Indeed she is,\" said Kathleen. \"She is a great deal more of a lady than you are.\"  The girl flushed.  \"You are a Great Shirley girl yourself,\" she said. \"I saw you there to-day. You are in an awfully low class. Do you like sitting with the little kids? I saw you towering up in the middle of them like a mountain.\"  Kathleen's eyes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],["title","The Rebel of the School (#6)"],["body","flashed.  \"What is your name?\" she asked.  \"Susan Hopkins. I used to be a Board School girl, but now I am on the foundation at Great Shirley. It is a big rise for me. Are you a poor girl? Are you on the foundation?\"  \"I don't know what it means by being on the foundation, but I don't think I am poor. I think, on the contrary, that I am very rich. Did you ever hear of a girl who lived in a castle--a great beautiful castle--on the top of a high hill? If you ever did, I am that girl.\"  \"Oh, my!\" said Susy Hopkins. \"That does sound romantic.\"  Her momentary dislike to Kathleen had vanished. The desire to go to the town on a message for her mother had completely left her. She stood still, as though fascinated.  \"I live there,\" said Kathleen--\"that is, I do when I am at home. I come from the land of the mountain and the stream; of the shamrock; of the deep, deep blue sea.\"  \"Ireland? Are you Irish?\" said the girl.  \"I am proud to say that I am.\"  \"We don't think anything of the Irish here.\"  \"Oh, don't you?\"  \"But don't be angry, please,\" continued Susy, \"for I am sure you are very nice.\"  \"I am nice when I like. To-day I am nasty. I am wicked to-day--quite wicked; I could hate any one who opposes me. I want some one to help me; if some one will help me, I will be nice to that person. Will you?\"  \"Oh, my word, yes! How handsome you look when you flash your eyes!\" said Susy Hopkins.  \"Then I want to find that dear little girl, who is so beautiful that I love her and can't get her out of my head. I want to find Ruth Craven. She went away with a horrid, stiff, pokery girl called Cassandra Weldon. You have such strange names in your country. That horrid, prim Cassandra chose to correct me when I came into school, and she has taken my darling away--the only one I love in the whole of England. I want to find her. I will give you--- I will give you an Irish diamond set in a brooch if you will help me.\"  This sounded a very grand offer indeed to Susy Hopkins, who lived in the most modest way, and had not a jewel of any sort in her possession.  \"I will help you. I will, and I can. I know where Miss Weldon lives. I can take you to her house.\"  \"But I want Ruth.\"  \"If she has taken Ruth home, she will be at Cassandra's house,\" said Susy.  \"And you can take me there?\"  \"This blessed minute.\"  \"All right; come along.\"  \"When will you give me the diamond set in the brooch?\"  \"It isn't a real diamond, you know. It is an Irish diamond set in silver--real silver. My old nurse had it made for me, and I wear it sometimes. I will bring it to you to school to-morrow.\"  \"Oh, thank you--thank you, Miss--I forgot your name.\"  \"O'Hara--Kathleen O'Hara.\"  \"O'Hara is rather a difficult name to say. May I call you Kathleen?\"  \"Just as you please, Susan. It is more handy for me to say Susan than Hopkins. As long as I am in England I must consort, I see, with all kinds of people; and if you will make yourself useful to me, I will be good to you.\"  Susy turned and led the way in the direction of Cassandra Weldon's home. They had to walk across a very wide field, then down a narrow lane, then up a steep hill, and then into a valley. At the bottom of the valley was a straight road, and at each side of the road were neat little houses--small and very proper-looking. Each house consisted of two stories, with a hall door in the middle and a sitting room on each side. There were three windows overhead, and one or two attics in the roof. The houses were very compact; they were new, and were called by ambitious names. For instance, the house where the Weldons lived went by the ambitious name of Sans Souci. All through the walk Susy chatted for the benefit of her companion. She told Kathleen so much about her life that she was interested in spite of herself! and by the time they arrived outside Sans Souci, Kathleen's hand was lying affectionately on her companion's arm.  \"I had best not go in, miss,\" she said. \"Cassandra Weldon would never take the very least notice of me; and none of us foundation girls like her at all.\"  \"Well, it is extremely unfair,\" said Kathleen. \"From all you have been telling me, the foundation girls must be particularly clever. I tell you what it is: I think I shall take to you.\"  \"Oh, would you, indeed, miss?\" said Susy, her eyes sparkling. \"There are a hundred of us, you know, in the school.\"  \"That is a great number. And Ruth Craven is really one?\"  \"She is, miss. She isn't a bit better than the rest of us.\"  \"And I love her already.\"  \"She is no better than the rest of us,\" repeated Susan Hopkins.  \"I have a great mind to take to you all, to make a fuss about you, and to show the others how badly they behave.\"  \"You'd be a queen amongst us; there's no doubt about that.\"  \"It would be lovely, and it would be a tremendous bit of naughtiness,\" thought Kathleen.  \"Do you think you will, miss? Because, if you do, I will tell the others. We could meet you and talk over things.\"  \"Well, I will decide to-morrow. I will enclose a letter with your brooch. Good-bye now; I must go in and kiss my darling Ruth.\"  Susy Hopkins stood for a minute to watch Kathleen as she went up the little narrow path of Sans Souci. When Kathleen reached the porch she waved her hand, and Susy, putting wings to her feet, ran as fast as she could in the opposite direction. She felt very much elated and really pleased. In the whole course of her life she had never met a girl of the Kathleen O'Hara type before. Her beauty, her daring and wild manner, the flash in her bright dark eyes, the glints of gold in her lovely hair, all fascinated Susy.  \"What a queen she'd make!\" she thought. \"We must make her our queen. We'd have quite a party of our own in the school if she took us up. And she will; I'm sure she will. This is a lark. This is worth a great deal.\"  Meanwhile Kathleen rang the bell at Sans Souci in a very smart, imperative manner. A little maid, neatly dressed, came to the door.  \"Please,\" said Kathleen, \"will you say that Miss O'Hara has called and would be glad to see Miss Ruth Craven for a few minutes?\"  The girl withdrew. Presently she returned.  \"Mrs. Weldon will be pleased if you will go in, miss. She is sitting in the drawing-room. The two young ladies are out in the garden.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Kathleen.  After a brief hesitation she entered the house, and was conducted across the narrow hall into a very sweet and charmingly furnished room. The room had a bay-window with French doors; these opened on to a little flower-lawn. At one side of the house was a tiny conservatory full of bright flowers. Compared to the house where the Tennants lived, this tiny place looked like a paradise to Kathleen. She gave a quick glance round her, then came up to Mrs. Weldon.  \"I am one of the new girls at the Great Shirley School,\" she said. \"My name is Kathleen O'Hara. I am Irish. I have only just crossed the cold sea. I am lonely, too. I want Ruth Craven. May I sit down a minute while your servant fetches her? I like Ruth Craven. She is very pretty, isn't she? She is the sort of girl that you'd take a fancy to when you're lonely and far from home. May I sit here until she comes?\"  \"Of course, my dear,\" said Mrs. Weldon, speaking with kindness, and looking with eyes full of interest at the handsome, striking-looking girl. \"I quite understand your being lonely. I was very lonely indeed when I came home from India and left my dear father and mother behind me.\"  \"How old were you when you came home?\"  \"A great deal younger than you are: only seven years old. But that is a long time ago. I should like to be kind to you, Miss O'Hara. Cassandra has been telling me about you. You are living at the Tennants', are you not? Alice Tennant and Cassandra are great friends.\"  \"But I don't like either of them,\" said Kathleen in her blunt way.  Mrs. Weldon looked a little startled.  \"Do you know my daughter?\" she asked.  \"She is much too interfering, and she is frightfully stuck-up. Please forgive me, but I am always very plain-spoken; I always tell the truth. I don't want her. I like you, and wish that I lived with you, and that you'd have Ruth Craven instead of your own daughter in the house. Then I'd be perfectly happy. I always did say what I thought. Will you forgive me?\"  \"I will, dear, because at the present moment you don't know my girl at all. There never was a more splendid girl in all the world, but she requires to be known. Ah! here she comes, and your little friend, Miss Craven, with her.\"  Ruth, looking very pretty, with a delicate flush on each cheek, now entered the room in the company of Cassandra. Kathleen sprang up the minute she saw Ruth, rushed across the room, and flung one arm with considerable violence round her neck.  \"You have come,\" she said. \"I have been hunting the place for you. How dared you go away and hide yourself? Don't you know that you belong to me? The moment I saw you I knew that you were my affinity. Don't you know what an affinity means? Well, you are mine. We were twin souls before birth; now we have met again and we cannot part. I am ever so happy when I am with you. Don't mind those others; let them stare all they like. I am going to take you foundation girls up. I have made up my mind. We will have a rollicking good time--a splendid time. We will be as naughty as we like, and we will let the others see what we are made of. It will be war to the knife between the foundation girls and the good, proper, paying girls. Let the ladies look after themselves. We of the foundation will lead our own life, and be as happy as the day is long. Aren't you glad to see me, dear, sweet, pretty Ruth? Don't you know for yourself that you are my affinity--my chosen friend, my beloved? Through the ages we have been one, and now we have met in the flesh.\"  \"I think,\" said Cassandra, at last managing to get herself heard, \"that you have said enough for the present, Miss O'Hara. Ruth Craven has come to spend the day with me. I know that you are an Irish girl,"]]]
