[Illustration]  VAIN JACKDAW. No, no! I beg you--  FIRST PEACOCK. Come, let's pull them out!  [_They pull the peacock feathers from the jackdaw._]  THIRD PEACOCK. You cannot stay with us!  SECOND PEACOCK. Go back to the jackdaws!  FIRST PEACOCK. Away with you! Away!  [_The jackdaw runs. The peacocks go, laughing. The other_ JACKDAWS _enter, followed by the_ VAIN JACKDAW.]  VAIN JACKDAW. Ah, here you are! I have been looking for you.  OLD JACKDAW. Why do you look for us?  VAIN JACKDAW. I am a jackdaw. I want to be with jackdaws.  OLD JACKDAW. We will have nothing more to do with you! Away!  VAIN JACKDAW. But, brothers, my dear, dear brothers, please let me stay with you!  OLD JACKDAW. You would not walk with jackdaws! Away!  YOUNG JACKDAW. You would not talk with jackdaws! Away!  ANOTHER JACKDAW. You thought yourself too fine for jackdaws! Away!  ALL JACKDAWS. Away! Away!

THE CAMEL.         *       *       *       *       *  [_The_ JACKAL _stands on the river bank. He looks longingly toward the west shore._]  JACKAL. Ah, if I could only get at those crabs over there! It makes me hungry just to see them! Now if I could only swim! Or if I could walk on water! Or if I had a little canoe!  [_Enter the_ CAMEL. _The Jackal whispers to himself._]  Aha! Now I know the way to get across.  (_To the Camel._)  Such news as I have for you, dear friend!  CAMEL. Must I guess?  JACKAL. No, I'll tell you this time. Listen: I know a spot where the sugar-cane grows thick.  CAMEL. Tell me! I cannot wait! Tell me!  JACKAL. I cannot. I'll have to show you. It is on the other side of the river.  CAMEL. Why, then, I'll swim across and take you on my back.  JACKAL. Just the very thing!  CAMEL. Come, then! It makes me hungry just to hear of sugar-cane.  [_He kneels for the Jackal to get upon his back._]   SCENE II  TIME: _a little later._ PLACE: _the sugar-cane field._         *       *       *       *       *  THE JACKAL. THE CAMEL. FARMER. BOYS.         *       *       *       *       *  [_The_ CAMEL _eats the sugar-cane. The_ JACKAL _comes running into the field._]  CAMEL. What! Have you finished your crabs?  JACKAL. I cannot eat another one! Are you not ready to go?  CAMEL. Ready! Why, I have just begun.  JACKAL. I'll wait for you outside the field, then.  [_The Camel nods and disappears among the cane._]  Now I do not wish to wait for him. I am in a hurry to get home, I am. So I'll sing a little song I know. The farmer then will come and drive the camel out.  [_He goes. Soon he is heard singing in the distance. Enter the_ FARMER _and_ the BOYS _with clubs._]  FARMER. I see no jackal here!  A BOY. I am sure I heard him singing!  ANOTHER BOY. I heard him, too!  FARMER. We must look for him and drive him out.  [_The_ CAMEL _enters, eating cane._]  FIRST BOY. Look, look! A camel!  SECOND BOY. Look, father! A camel!  FARMER (_to Camel_). So it was you who was singing, was it? Drive him out, boys! Quick! Beat him with your clubs!  [_They rush upon the Camel and beat him as he runs from the field._]   SCENE III  TIME: _a little later._ PLACE: _the west bank of the river._         *       *       *       *       *  THE JACKAL.

Don't say \"friend\" to me!  JACKAL. Why do you speak so strangely?  CAMEL. Why did you sing so strangely?  [Illustration]  JACKAL. Oh, I don't know why! I always sing after dinner.  CAMEL. Ah! Well, let us go.  [_He kneels. The Jackal gets on his back. The Camel rises and enters the river. He swims to the middle of the river and stops._]  JACKAL. Why do you stop?  CAMEL. I have such a strange, strange feeling.  JACKAL. Well, swim on. You need not stop!  CAMEL. I feel as if I must roll over.  JACKAL. Roll over! If you do, I shall be drowned!  CAMEL. Exactly. But still I have that feeling.  JACKAL. Now that is nonsense! Why should you roll over?  CAMEL. Oh, I don't know why! I always roll over after dinner.  [_He rolls over._]     THE ENDLESS TALE   TIME: _a long time ago._ PLACE: _the King's palace._         *       *       *       *       *  KING. PRINCESS. FIRST STORY-TELLER. SECOND STORY-TELLER.

In front of them sits the_ FIRST STORY-TELLER. _The_ LORDS _and_ LADIES _sit near by._]  STORY-TELLER. \"Then the prince married the princess and they were happy forever and ever.\"  [_There is a pause._]  KING. Go on!  (_The Story-Teller hangs his head._)  Go on, I say!  STORY-TELLER. That is all, your Majesty.  KING. All!  STORY-TELLER. The prince married the princess. There is nothing more to tell.  KING. I cannot bear so short a story!  PRINCESS. Why, father; for three months we have listened to it!  KING. 'Tis short, I say! I bid you make it longer, sir!  STORY-TELLER. I cannot, Sire. The prince married the princess. There is nothing--  KING. Throw him out of the palace, guards! Cut off his head!  [_Guards seize the Story-Teller._]  PRINCESS. Father!  LORDS. Your Majesty!  LADIES. Sire!  PRINCESS. Spare his life!  STORY-TELLER. Let me keep my head, Sire!  KING. Why should you keep it? You do not use it.  STORY-TELLER. For three months I have used it, Sire!  KING. Your story is too short, I say! Away with him, guards! Away!  (_Guards take out the First Story-Teller._)  Bid another Story-Teller come!  (_A guard admits the_ SECOND STORY-TELLER, _who bows before the King and Princess._)  Sir, hear me. You must tell a story that will last forever.  SECOND STORY-TELLER. I hear, O King!  KING. If you can do this, you shall marry my daughter and be king after me.  SECOND STORY-TELLER. I hear, O King!  KING. If you fail, you shall lose your head. Begin! And remember, the story must go on forever. Now again I say, begin!  SECOND STORY-TELLER. \"Once upon a time a certain king seized upon all the corn in his country. He had it stored in a strong granary. Then came a swarm of locusts over the land. Soon they found a crack in the south side of the granary. Now the crack was just large enough for one locust to pass through at a time. So one locust went in and carried away a grain of corn. Then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn. Then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn. Then--\"  KING (_interrupting)._ Yes, yes! Now go on with the story.  SECOND STORY-TELLER. The story shall go on, O King! \"Then another locust went in and carried away another grain of corn. Then another locust--\"  KING (_interrupting). I_ tell you to go on with the story!  SECOND STORY-TELLER. I obey, great King. \"Then another locust went in and carried away another grain of corn. Then another--\"  KING. The story! The story, I tell you!  SECOND STORY-TELLER. This is the story, O King! \"Then another locust went in and carried away another grain of corn. Then--\"  KING. I cannot stand it! How long will it take the locusts to carry away all the grain?  SECOND STORY-TELLER. One thousand years, O King! \"Then another locust went in and--\"  KING. Stop! Stop! Take my daughter! Be king after me! Be king now! Anything to stop the locusts!

How can we run? We shall spill our nuts.  FRIEDA. We are so far from home!  JACOB. We went so far to find the nuts.  GRETCHEN. It will soon be dark.  FRIEDA. We must walk as fast as we can.  GRETCHEN. Why do you stop, Peter?  PETER. There is water on the sand here.  JACOB. Come, Peter, come!  PETER. Where has this water come from?  [Illustration: 'THERE IS WATER ON THE SAND HERE']  FRIEDA. Come, come, Peter!  PETER. There was no rain yesterday. There was no rain to-day.  GRETCHEN. Come, Peter!  PETER. What if the water comes through the dike!  JACOB. Oh, that could not be! How could water get through that thick wall?  PETER. There might be a hole in it. I will see.  GRETCHEN. Peter, Peter! Your mother waits for you.  PETER. I must find where the water comes from.  GRETCHEN. Well, I will not wait.  JACOB. Nor I!  FRIEDA. Nor I! It is too cold.  [_They go. Peter runs to the dike and looks at it carefully._]  PETER. Ah, I thought so! Here is a little hole! The water comes through it from the sea. Soon the hole will be larger. I must find stones and fill it.  (_He looks about for stones._)  Dear me! Dear me! I cannot find a single stone! What shall I do? The hole will grow larger and larger. The sea will come in and cover all the land. What shall I do? I cannot go and tell the people. That would take too long. What shall I do? What shall I do?  (_He thinks for a moment._)  I know! I know how to stop it!  (_He thrusts his arm through the hole. He shivers._)  How cold it is!

I must teach him that he cannot stay away all night. I will punish him for what he has done.

What is this? Why do you carry Peter?  PRINCE. Peter has saved us!  MOTHER. What do you mean?  PRINCE. He put his arm in a hole in the dike. All night long he stood there! All night long he kept out the sea! We found him there this morning. Poor little boy, he was so cold!  MOTHER. Ah, my Peter! My dear Peter!  PRINCE. He is a brave boy. The king wants to see him and to thank him. Come, soldiers, to the king with Peter! Come, to the king! To the king!  [_They go with Peter on their shoulders._]  SOLDIERS. Hurrah for Peter!  PEOPLE.

HIS THREE SONS.         *       *       *       *       *  [_The_ THREE SONS _dig lazily among the vines._]  FIRST SON. Oh, I am tired of digging! Come, brothers, let us sit and talk!  [_He throws down his spade and sits._]  [Illustration]  SECOND SON. Father said we should dig at every vine. But I must say I am tired of it.  [_He throws down his spade and sits._]  THIRD SON. I was tired when we began.  [_He throws down his spade and sits. The_ FARMER _enters. His sons do not see him._]  FIRST SON. Now I should like to go to war and ride a great white horse.  SECOND SON. I should like to be a prince. I would do nothing all day long but wear my golden crown.  THIRD SON. I want to find a purse of gold. I would never work again, I tell you!  [_The farmer shakes his head sadly._]  FARMER. My sons, these vines have not been dug about. Come, do this work as I have told you.  (_The sons take up their spades, but unwillingly._)  Now listen: a pot of gold is hidden in this vineyard. It is buried deep beneath these vines.  SONS. A pot of gold!  FARMER. It is all I have to leave you. I think it best to-tell you now, for I cannot live much longer.  FIRST SON. Why do you hide the gold, my father?  FARMER. That you may dig for it.  SECOND SON. Why do you hide it in the ground?  FARMER. That you may dig for it.  THIRD SON. Why don't you tell us where it is?  FARMER. That you may dig for it.  [_He goes._]  SONS. A pot of gold!  FIRST SON. Now I shall go to war and ride a great white horse!  SECOND SON. Now I shall marry a princess and wear her golden crown!  THIRD SON. Now I shall find my purse of gold, and never work again!

The_ FIRST SON _is seen digging. He throws down his spade showing disappointment._]  FIRST SON. I cannot find it!  (_Enter_ SECOND SON _with his spade._)  Did you find it?  SECOND SON. No, and I have dug up every inch of our western vineyard.  [_Enter_ THIRD SON _with his spade._]  FIRST AND SECOND SONS. Did you find it?  THIRD SON. No, and I have dug up every inch of the eastern vineyard.  FIRST SON. Well, you see what I have done here.  SECOND SON. Not a vine that has not been dug about!  THIRD SON. I cannot understand it!  FIRST SON. The day our father died he spoke again of the pot of gold.  SECOND SON. And told us again to dig for it.  THIRD SON. I cannot understand it.  [_They go, shaking their heads sadly._]   SCENE III  TIME: _six months later._ PLACE: _the vineyard._         *       *       *       *       *  THE THREE SONS.

They are ripe and ready to sell, sir.  SECOND SON. Come, now, and look at them.  [_They cross to the vines._]  MERCHANT. Why, I have never seen such grapes as these!  THIRD SON. We have never had such grapes before, sir.  MERCHANT. How fine and large they are!  FIRST SON. And sweet, too! Just taste one, sir!  MERCHANT (_eating a grape_). Are they all like these?  SECOND SON. Every vine bears just such grapes.  MERCHANT. I must have your grapes. I will give a pot of gold for them.  SONS. A pot of gold!  MERCHANT. Come, will you sell?  SONS. Aye, sir!  MERCHANT. Then to-morrow I will bring the pot of gold and take away the grapes.  [_He goes._]  SONS. A pot of gold!  FIRST SON. I wonder if that was father's pot of gold.  SECOND SON. I almost think it was.  THIRD SON. I wonder now, I wonder--  FIRST SON. No war horse for me! I will stay and dig again for gold!  SECOND SON. No prince's crown for me! I will stay and dig here too!  THIRD SON. I have found my purse of gold! I will stay and find another!

They are very fine indeed.  HEDGEHOG. We can feed on them all summer.  WIFE. Yes, if the hares will let us.  HEDGEHOG. Oh, there is enough for all of us, hares, hedgehogs, and farmer.  WIFE. Yes, if the hares will think that, too.  HEDGEHOG. Well, we will let them alone as we have always done.  WIFE. But they will not let us alone. Yesterday they called at me while I was eating here.  HEDGEHOG. What did they say to you?  WIFE. Oh, such things as \"Short-legs,\" and \"Duck-legs.\"  HEDGEHOG. Here comes one of them now!  WIFE. He is one who called at me. I'll hide till he goes by.  [_She hides among the cabbages. The_ HARE _enters._]  HEDGEHOG. Good-morning, sir.  HARE. Why do you speak to me?  HEDGEHOG. I always speak to neighbors, sir.  HARE. Speak to your own kind, then. I think myself too good for hedgehogs.  HEDGEHOG. Now that is strange.  HARE. There is nothing strange about it. Look at your silly little legs!  HEDGEHOG. They are quite as good as yours, sir.  HARE. As good as mine! Hear him! You can only walk with those legs, sir.  HEDGEHOG. I'll run a race with you this day.  HARE. Hear him! Hear him! Ha, ha!  HEDGEHOG. You may run in that furrow. I will run in this. We will see who gets to the field fence first.  HARE. Are you crazy?  HEDGEHOG. Come, come, let's begin the race!  HARE. Ha, ha! Well, I'll run with you. You ought to know just how silly your little duck-legs are.  HEDGEHOG. Let us go to this end of the furrow to begin.  HAKE. I will run to the brook and back while you are getting there.  HEDGEHOG. As you please.  (_The Hare runs off._)  Wife, wife, did you hear?  WIFE. I heard. Are you crazy?  HEDGEHOG. Go to the other end of this furrow, wife.  WIFE. And why should I do that?  HEDGEHOG. The hare will run in the other furrow. When he comes to your end, put up your head and say, \"I am already here.\"  WIFE. Ha, ha! He will think that I am you.  HEDGEHOG. Exactly.  WIFE. Ha, ha, ha! I go, Mr. Hedgehog! I go! You may be short on legs, my dear, but you are long on brains.  [_She runs to other end of furrow. Mr. Hedgehog goes to his end._]  [_The_ HARE _enters._]  HARE. Well, are you ready?  HEDGEHOG. I am ready.  HARE. One, two, three, go!  [_The Hare runs swiftly. The Hedgehog sits. The Hare reaches the other end of his furrow. The Wife puts up her head._]  [Illustration]  WIFE. I am already here.  HARE. What is this?  WIFE. I am already here.  HARE. We will try again! Are you ready?  WIFE. I am ready.  HARE. One, two, three, go!  [_The Hare runs swiftly. The Wife sits. The Hare reaches the other end of his furrow. Mr. Hedgehog puts up his head._]  HEDGEHOG. I am already here.  HARE. I cannot understand this.  HEDGEHOG. I am already here.  HARE. We will try again! Are you ready?  HEDGEHOG. I am ready.  HARE. One, two, three, go!  [_The Hare runs swiftly. Mr. Hedgehog sits. The Hare reaches the other end of his furrow. Mrs. Hedgehog puts up her head._]  WIFE. I am already here.  HARE. I cannot believe it!  WIFE. I am already here.  HARE. We will try again! Do you hear? We will try again.  WIFE. I am ready.  HARE. One, two, three, go!  [_The Hare runs swiftly. The Wife sits. The Hare reaches the other end of his furrow. Mr. Hedgehog puts up his head._]  HEDGEHOG. I am already here.  HARE. This is very, very strange!  HEDGEHOG. Shall we run again?  HARE. No, no! The race is yours, Neighbor Hedgehog. And will you please to call some day? I should be glad to see you.  HEDGEHOG. I shall be glad to come.  [_The Hare goes off wondering._]  WIFE (_running to meet Mr. Hedgehog_). You may be short on legs, my dear, but you are very, very long on brains.

There he is between your oxen.  KNAVE. He is my colt, sir.  NIX. How can he be your colt when he is mine?  KNAVE. I ask the same question, sir.  NIX. What do you mean?  KNAVE. How can the colt be yours when he is mine?  NIX. I'll have you before the judge, sir!  KNAVE. The judge shall speak to you, sir!  [_The_ PRINCE _comes from the castle._]  PRINCE. What is all this noise, sirs? What is all this noise, I say? The king sent me to ask.  NIX. Farmer Knave does claim my colt, Prince.  PRINCE. How is this, Farmer Knave?  KNAVE. I claim the colt because the colt is mine, Prince.  PRINCE. Now how is this, Farmer Nix?  NIX. The colt is mine, Prince.  KNAVE. The colt is mine I say!"]]]
