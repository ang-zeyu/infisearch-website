It developed in a few minutes of flight from soldiers at the German border.\"  \"That is so, but it was soon sealed by great common dangers. Who is your new friend, John?\"  \"A little Apache named Pierre Louis Bougainville, whom I have nicknamed Geronimo, after a famous Indian chief of my country. He has already gone to fight for France, and, Philip, he made an extraordinary impression upon me, although I don't know just why. He is short like Napoleon, he has the same large and beautifully shaped head, and the same penetrating eyes that seem able to look you through and through. Maybe it was a spark of genius in him that impressed me.\"  \"It may be so,\" said Lannes thoughtfully. \"It was said, and said truly that the First Republic meant the open career to all the talents, and the Third offers the same chance. One never can tell where military genius is going to appear and God knows we need it now in whatever shape or form it may come. Did you hear of the bomb?\"  \"I saw it fall. But, Phil, I don't see the object in such attacks. They may kill a few people, nearly always the unarmed, but that has no real effect on a war.\"  \"They wish to spread terror, I suppose. Lend me your glasses, John.\"  Lannes studied the heavens a long time, minutely examining every black speck against the blue, and John stood beside him, waiting patiently. Meanwhile the throng of fleeing people moved on as before, silent and somber, even the children saying little. John was again stirred by the deepest emotion of sympathy and pity. What a tremendous tragedy it would be if New York were being abandoned thus to a victorious foe! Lannes himself had seemed to take no notice of the flight, but John judged he had made a powerful effort of the will to hide the grief and anger that surely filled his heart.  \"I don't see anything in the air but our own machines,\" said Lannes, as he returned the glasses. \"It was evidently a dash by the Taube that threw the bomb. But we've stayed here long enough. They're waiting for us at home.\"  He led the way through the multitude, relapsing into silence, but casting a glance now and then at his own peculiar field, the heavens. They reached the Place de la Concorde, and stopped there a moment or two. Lannes looked sadly at the black drapery hanging from the stone figure that typified the lost city of Strassburg, but John glanced up the great sweep of the Place to the Arc de Triomphe, where he caught again the glittering shaft of sunlight that he had accepted as a sign.  \"We may be looking upon all this for the last time,\" said Lannes, in a voice of grief. \"Oh, Paris, City of Light, City of the Heart! You may not understand me, John, but I couldn't bear to come back to Paris again, much as I love it, if it is to be despoiled and ruled by Germans.\"  \"I do understand you, Philip,\" said John cheerfully, \"but you mustn't count a city yours until you've taken it. The Germans are near, but they're not here. Now, lead on. It's not like you to despair!\"  Lannes shook himself, as if he had laid violent hands upon his own body, and his face cleared.  \"That was the last time, John,\" he said. \"I made that promise before, but I keep it this time. You won't see me gloomy again. Henceforward it's hope only. Now, we must hurry. My mother and Julie will be growing anxious, for we are overdue.\"  They crossed the Seine by one of the beautiful stone bridges and entered a region of narrow and crooked streets, which John thought must be a part of old Paris. In an American city it would necessarily have been a quarter of the poor, but John knew that here wealth and distinction were often hidden behind these modest doors.  He began to feel very curious about Lannes' family, but he was careful to ask no questions. He knew that the young Frenchman was showing great trust and faith in him by taking him into his home. They stopped presently before a door, and Lannes rang a bell. The door was opened cautiously in a few moments, and a great head surmounted by thick, gray hair was thrust out. A powerful neck and a pair of immense shoulders followed the head. Sharp eyes under heavy lashes peered forth, but in an instant, when the man saw who was before him, he threw open the door and said:  \"Welcome, Monsieur.\"  John had no doubt that this was the Antoine Picard of whom Lannes had spoken, and he knew at the first glance that he beheld a real man. Many people have the idea that all Frenchmen are little, but John knew better.  Antoine Picard was a giant, much over six feet, and with the limbs and chest of a piano-mover. He was about sixty, but age evidently had made no impression upon his strength. John judged from his fair complexion that he was from Normandy. \"Here,\" young Scott said to himself, \"is one of those devoted European family servants of whom I've heard so often.\"  He regarded the man with interest, and Picard, in return, measured and weighed him with a lightning glance.  Lannes laughed.  \"It's all right, Antoine,\" he said. \"He's the young man from that far barbarian country called America, who escaped from Germany with me, only he's no barbarian, but a highly civilized being who not only likes France, but who fights for her. John, this is Antoine Picard, who rules and protects this house.\"  John held out his hand, American fashion, and it was engulfed in the mighty grasp of the Norseman, as he always thought of him afterward.  \"Madame, your mother, and Mademoiselle, your sister, have been anxious,\" said Picard.  \"We were delayed,\" said Lannes.  They stepped into a narrow hall, and Picard shut the door behind them, shooting into place a heavy bolt which sank into its socket with a click like the closing of the entrance to a fortress. In truth, the whole aspect of the house reminded John of a stronghold. The narrow hall was floored with stone, the walls were stone and the light was dim. Lannes divined John's thoughts.  \"You'll find it more cheerful, presently,\" he said. \"As for us, we're used to it, and we love it, although it's so old and cold and dark. It goes back at least five centuries.\"  \"I suppose some king must have slept here once,\" said John. \"In England they point out every very old house as a place where a king passed the night, and make reverence accordingly.\"  Lannes laughed gayly.  \"No king ever slept here so far as I know,\" he said, \"but the great Marshal Lannes, whose name I am so proud to bear, was in this house more than once, and to me, a staunch republican, that is greater than having had a king for a tenant. The Marshal, as you may know, although he took a title and served an Emperor, was always a republican and in the early days of the empire often offended Napoleon by his frankness and brusque truths. But enough of old things; we'll see my mother.\"  He led the way up the steps, of solid stone, between walls thick enough for a fortress, and knocked at a door. A deep, full voice responded \"Enter!\" and pushing open the door Lannes went in, followed by John.  It was a large room, with long, low windows, looking out over a sea of roofs toward the dome of the Invalides and Napoleon's arch of triumph. A tall woman rose from a chair, and saying \"My son!\" put her hands upon Lannes shoulders and kissed him on the forehead. She was fair like her son, and much less than fifty years of age. There was no stoop in her shoulders and but little gray in her hair. Her eyes were anxious, but John saw in them the Spartan determination that marked the women of France.  \"My friend, John Scott, of whom I have already spoken to you, Madame my mother,\" said Lannes.  John bowed. He knew little of French customs, particularly in the heart of a French family, and he was afraid to extend his hand, but she gave him hers, and let it rest in his palm a moment.  \"Philip has told me much of you,\" she said in her deep, bell-like voice, \"and although I know little of your far America, I can believe the best of it, if its sons are like you.\"  John flushed at the compliment, which he knew to be so sincere.  \"Thank you, Madame,\" he said. \"While my country can take no part in this war, many of my countrymen will fight with you. France helped us once, and some of us, at least, will help France now.\"  She smiled gravely, and John knew that he was welcome in her house. Lannes would see to that anyhow, but he wished to make a good impression on his own account.  \"I know that Philip risks his life daily,\" she said. \"He has chosen the most dangerous of all paths, the air, but perhaps in that way he can serve us most.\"  She spoke with neither complaint nor reproach, merely as if she were stating a fact, and her son added briefly:  \"You are right, mother. In the air I can work best for our people. Ah, John, here is my sister, who is quite curious about the stranger from across the sea.\"  A young girl came into the room. She was tall and slender, not more than seventeen, very fair, with blue eyes and hair of pure gold. John was continually observing that while many of the French were dark and small, in accordance with foreign opinion that made them all so, many more were blonde and tall. Lannes' sister was scarcely more than a lovely child, but his heart beat more quickly.  Lannes kissed her on the forehead, just as he kissed his mother.  \"Julie,\" he said lightly and yet proudly, \"this is the young American hero of whom I was telling you, my comrade in arms, or rather in the air, and adopted brother. Mr. John Scott, my sister, Mademoiselle Julie Lannes.\"  She made a shy curtsey and John bowed. It was the first time that he was ever in the heart of an old French home, and he did not know the rules, but he felt that he ought not to offer his hand. Young girls, he had always heard, were kept in strict seclusion in France, but the great war and the approach of the German army might make a difference. In any event, he felt bold enough to talk to her a little, and she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15760"],["title","The Forest of Swords: A Story of Paris and the Marne (#4)"],["body",", a beautiful color coming into her face.  \"Dinner is ready for our guest and you,\" said Madame Lannes, and she led the way into another apartment, also with long, low windows, where the table was set. The curtains were drawn from the windows, and John caught through one of them a glimpse of the Seine, of marching troops in long blue coats and red trousers, and of the great city, massing up beyond like a wall.  He felt that he had never before sat down to so strange a table. The world without was shaking beneath the tread of the mightiest of all wars, but within this room was peace and quiet. Madame was like a Roman matron, and the young Julie, though shy, had ample dignity. John liked Lannes' manner toward them both, his fine subordination to his mother and his protective air toward his sister. He was glad to be there with them, a welcome guest in the family.  The dinner was served by a tall young woman. Picard's daughter Suzanne, to whom Lannes had referred, and she served in silence and with extraordinary dexterity one of the best dinners that he ever ate.  As the dinner proceeded John admired the extraordinary composure of the Lannes family. Surely a woman and a girl of only seventeen would feel consternation at the knowledge that an overwhelming enemy was almost within sight of the city they must love so much. Yet they did not refer to it, until nearly the close of the dinner, and it was Madame who introduced the subject.  \"I hear, Philip,\" she said, \"that a bomb was thrown today from a German aeroplane into the Place de l'Opéra, killing a woman and injuring several other people.\"  \"It is true, mother.\"  John glanced covertly at Julie, and saw her face pale. But she did not tremble.  \"Is it true also that the German army is near?\" asked Madame Lannes, with just the faintest quiver in her voice.  \"Yes, mother. John, standing in the lantern of the Basilique du Sacré-Coeur, saw through his glasses the flash of sunlight on the lances of their Uhlans. A shell from one of their great guns could fall in the suburbs of Paris.\"  John's covert glance was now for Madame Lannes. How would the matron who was cast in the antique mold of Rome take such news? But she veiled her eyes a little with her long lashes, and he could not catch the expression there.  \"I believe it is not generally known in Paris that the enemy is so very near,\" said Philip, \"and while I have not hesitated to tell you the full truth, mother, I ask you and Julie not to speak of it to others.\"  \"Of course, Philip, we would add nothing to the general alarm, which is great enough already, and with cause. But what do you wish us to do? Shall we remain here, or go while it is yet time to our cousins, the Menards, at Lyons?\"  Now it was the mother who, in this question of physical peril, was showing deference to her son, the masculine head of the family. John liked it. He remembered an old saying, and he felt it to be true, that they did many things well in France.  Lannes glanced at young Scott before replying.  \"Mother,\" he said, \"the danger is great. I do not try to conceal it from you. It was my intention this morning to see you and Julie safe on the Lyons train, but John and I have beheld signs, not military, perhaps, but of the soul, and we are firm in the belief that at the eleventh hour we shall be saved. The German host will not enter Paris.\"  Madame Lannes looked fixedly at John and he felt her gaze resting like a weight upon his face. But he responded. His faith had merely grown stronger with the hours.  \"I cannot tell why, Madame,\" he said, \"but I believe as surely as I am sitting here that the enemy will not enter the capital.\"  Then she said decisively, \"Julie and I remain in our own home in Paris.\"     CHAPTER II  THE MESSENGER   There was little more talk. The dignified quiet of the Lannes family remained unchanged, and John imitated it. If they could be so calm in the face of overwhelming disaster it should be no effort for him to remain unmoved. Yet he glanced often, though covertly, at Julie Lannes, admiring her lovely color.  When dinner was over they returned to the room in which Madame Lannes had received them. The dark had come already, and Suzanne had lighted four tall candles. There was neither gas nor electricity.  \"Mr. Scott will be our guest tonight, mother,\" said Lannes, \"and tomorrow he and I go together to the army.\"  John raised his hand in protest. It had not been his intention when he came to remain until morning, but Lannes would listen to no objection; nor would his mother.  \"Since you fight for our country,\" she said, \"you must let us give you shelter for at least one night.\"  He acquiesced, and they sat a little while, talking of the things furthest from their hearts. Julie Lannes withdrew presently, and before long her mother followed. Lannes went to the window, and looked out over Paris, where the diminished lights twinkled. John stood at the other window and saw the great blur of the capital. All sounds were fused into one steady murmur, rather soothing, like the flowing of a river.  He seemed to hear presently the distant thunder of German guns, but reason told him it was only a trick of the imagination. Nerves keyed high often created the illusion of reality.  \"What are you thinking about, Lannes?\" he asked.  \"Of my mother and sister. Only the French know the French. The family tie is powerful with us.\"  \"I know that, Phil.\"  \"So you do. You're an adopted child of France. Madame Lannes is a woman of great heart, John. I am proud to be her son. I have read of your civil war. I have read how the mothers of your young soldiers suffered and yet were brave. None can know how much Madame, my mother, has suffered tonight, with the Germans at the gates of Paris, and yet she has shown no sign of it.\"  John was silent. He did not know what to say, but Lannes did not pursue the subject, remaining a full five minutes at the window, and not speaking again, until he turned away.  \"John,\" he said then, \"let's go outside and take a look about the quarter. It's important now to watch for everything.\"  John was full willing. He recognized the truth of Lannes' words and he wanted air and exercise also. A fortress was a fortress, whether one called it a home or not, Lannes led the way and they descended to the lower hall, where the gigantic porter was on watch.  \"My friend and I are going to take a look in the streets, Antoine,\" said Lannes. \"Guard the house well while we are gone.\"  \"I will,\" replied the man, \"but will you tell me one thing, Monsieur Philip? Do Madame Lannes and Mademoiselle Julie remain in Paris?\"  \"They do, Antoine, and since I leave tomorrow it will be the duty of you and Suzanne to protect them.\"  \"I am gratified, sir, that they do not leave the capital. I have never known a Lannes to flee at the mere rumor of the enemy's coming.\"  \"And I hope you never will, Antoine. I think we'll be back in an hour.\"  \"I shall be here, sir.\"  He unbolted the door and Lannes and John stepped out, the cool night air pouring in a grateful flood upon their faces. Antoine fastened the door behind them, and John again heard the massive bolt sink into its place.  \"The quarter is uncommonly quiet,\" said Lannes. \"I suppose it has a right to be after such a day.\"  Then be looked up, scanning the heavens, after the manner that had become natural to him, a flying man.  \"What do you see, Philip?\" asked John.  \"A sky of dark blue, plenty of stars, but no aeroplanes, Taubes or other machines of man's making.\"  \"I fancy that some of them are on the horizon, but too far away to be seen by us.\"  \"Likely as not. The Germans are daring enough and we can expect more bombs to be dropped on Paris. Our flying corps must organize to meet theirs. I feel the call of the air, John.\"  Young Scott laughed.  \"I believe the earth has ceased to be your natural element,\" he said. \"You're happiest when you're in the _Arrow_ about a mile above our planet.\"  Lannes laughed also, and with appreciation. The friendship between the two young men was very strong, and it had in it all the quality of permanence. Their very unlikeness in character and temperament made them all the better comrades. What one could not do the other could.  As they walked along now they said but little. Each was striving to read what he could in that great book, the streets of Paris. John believed Lannes had not yet told him his whole mission. He knew that in their short stay in Paris Philip had spent an hour in the office of the military governor of the city, and his business must be of great importance to require an hour from a man who carried such a fearful weight of responsibility. But whatever Lannes' secret might be, it was his own and he had no right to pry into it. If the time came for his comrade to tell it he would do so.  When they reached the Seine the city did not seem so quiet. They heard the continuous sound of marching troops and people were still departing through the streets toward the country or the provincial cities. The flight went on by night as well as day, and John again felt the overwhelming pity of it.  He wondered what the French generals and their English allies would do? Did they have any possible way of averting this terrible crisis? They had met nothing but defeat, and the vast German army had crashed, unchecked, through everything from the border almost to the suburbs of Paris.  They stood in the Place Valhubert at the entrance to the Pont d'Austerlitz, and watched a regiment crossing the river, the long blue coats and red trousers of the men outlined against the white body of the bridge. The soldiers were short, they looked little to John, but they were broad of chest and they marched splendidly with a powerful swinging stride.  \"From the Midi,\" said Lannes. \"Look how dark they are! France is called a Latin nation, but I doubt whether the term is correct. These men of the Midi though are the real Latins. We of northern France, I suspect, are more Teutonic "]]]
