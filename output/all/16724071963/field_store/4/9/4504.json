Part I.   _PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS._     CHAPTER I.  THE UNITY OF MANKIND.       THE BIBLICAL ARGUMENT.--ONE RACE AND ONE LANGUAGE.--ONE      BLOOD.--THE CURSE OF CANAAN.   During the last half-century, many writers on ethnology, anthropology, and slavery have strenuously striven to place the Negro outside of the human family; and the disciples of these teachers have endeavored to justify their views by the most dehumanizing treatment of the Negro. But, fortunately for the Negro and for humanity at large, we live now in an epoch when race malice and sectional hate are disappearing beneath the horizon of a brighter and better future. The Negro in America is free. He is now an acknowledged factor in the affairs of the continent; and no community, state, or government, in this period of the world's history, can afford to be indifferent to his moral, social, intellectual, or political well-being.  It is proposed, in the first place, to call the attention to the absurd charge that the Negro does not belong to the human family. Happily, there are few left upon the face of the earth who still maintain this belief.  In the first chapter of the Book of Genesis it is clearly stated that \"God created man,\" \"male and female created he them;\"[1] that \"the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul;\"[2] and that \"the Lord God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\"[3] It is noticeable that the sacred historian, in every reference to Adam, speaks of him as \"_man_;\" and that the divine injunction to them was,--Adam and Eve,--\"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\"[4] As among the animals, so here in the higher order, there were two,--a pair,--\"male and female,\" of the human species. We may begin with man, and run down the scale, and we are sure to find two of a kind, \"male and female.\" This was the divine order. But they were to \"be fruitful,\" were to \"replenish the earth.\" That they did \"multiply,\" we have the trustworthy testimony of God; and it was true that man and beast, fowl and fish, increased. We read that after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden, Eve bore Adam a family. Cain and Abel; and that they \"peopled the earth.\"  After a number of years we find that wickedness increased in the earth; so much so that the Lord was provoked to destroy the earth with a flood, with the exception of Noah, his wife, his three sons and their wives,--eight souls in all.[5] Of the animals, two of each kind were saved.  But the most interesting portion of Bible history comes after the Flood. We then have the history of the confusion of tongues, and the subsequent and consequent dispersion of mankind. In the eleventh chapter and first verse of Genesis it is recorded: \"_And the_ WHOLE EARTH _was of_ ONE LANGUAGE, _and of_ ONE SPEECH.\" \"The whole earth\" here means all the inhabitants of the earth,--all mankind. The medium of communication was common. Everybody used one language. In the sixth verse occurs this remarkable language: \"And the Lord said, Behold, the people is _one_, and they have all _one_ language.\" Attention is called to this verse, because we have here the testimony of the Lord that \"the people is _one_,\" and that the language of the people is one. This verse establishes two very important facts; i.e., there was but one nationality, and hence but one language. The fact that they had but one language furnishes reasonable proof that they were of one blood; and the historian has covered the whole question very carefully by recording the great truth that they were _one people_, and had but _one language_. The seventh, eighth, and ninth verses of the eleventh chapter are not irrelevant: \"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\"  It was the wickedness of the people that caused the Lord to disperse them, to confound their speech, and bring to nought their haughty work. Evidently this was the beginning of different families of men,--different nationalities, and hence different languages. In the ninth verse it reads, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15735"],["title","History of the Negro Race in America From 1619 to 1880. Vol 1 (#5)"],["body","\"from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\" There is no ambiguity about this language. He did not only \"confound their language,\" but \"scattered them from thence,\" from Babel, \"upon the face of all the earth.\" Here, then, are two very important facts: their _language_ was _confused_, and they _were_ \"_scattered_.\" They were not only \"scattered,\" they were \"scattered _abroad upon the face of all_ the earth.\" That is, they were dispersed very widely, sent into the various and remote parts of the earth; and their nationality received its being from the latitudes to which the divinely appointed wave of dispersion bore them; and their subsequent racial character was to borrow its tone and color from climateric influences. Three great families, the Shemitic, Hamitic, and Japhetic, were suddenly built up. Many other families, or tribes, sprang from these; but these were the three great heads of all subsequent races of men.       \"That the three sons of Noah overspread and peopled the      whole earth, is so expressly stated in Scripture, that, had      we not to argue against those who unfortunately disbelieve      such evidence, we might here stop: let us, however, inquire      how far the truth of this declaration is substantiated by      other considerations. Enough has been said to show that      there is a curious, if not a remarkable, analogy between the      predictions of Noah on the future descendants of his three      sons, and the actual state of those races which are      generally supposed to have sprung from them. It may here be      again remarked, that, to render the subject more clear, we      have adopted the quinary arrangement of Professor      Blumenbach: yet that Cuvier and other learned physiologists      are of opinion that the primary varieties of the human form      are more properly but three; viz., the Caucasian, Mongolian,      and Ethiopian. This number corresponds with that of Noah's      sons. Assigning, therefore, the Mongolian race to Japheth,      and the Ethiopian to Ham, the Caucasian, the noblest race,      will belong to Shem, the third son of Noah, himself      descended from Seth, the third son of Adam. That the primary      distinctions of the human varieties are but _three_, has      been further maintained by the erudite Prichard; who, while      he rejects the nomenclature both of Blumenbach and Cuvier,      as implying absolute divisions, arranges the leading      varieties of the human skull under three sections, differing      from those of Cuvier only by name. That the three sons of      Noah who were to 'replenish the earth,' and on whose progeny      very opposite destinies were pronounced, should give birth      to different races, is what might reasonably be conjectured;      but that the observation of those who do, and of those who      do not, believe the Mosaic history, should tend to confirm      truth, by pointing out in what these three races do actually      differ, both physically and morally, is, to say the least, a      singular coincidence. It amounts, in short, to a presumptive      evidence, that a mysterious and very beautiful analogy      pervades throughout, and teaches us to look beyond natural      causes in attempting to account for effects apparently      interwoven in the plans of Omnipotence.\"[6]  In the seventeenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, twenty-sixth verse, we find the following language: \"And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.\"[7] The Apostle Paul was a missionary. He was, at this time, on a mission to the far-famed city of Athens,--\"the eye of Greece, and the fountain of learning and philosophy.\" He told the \"men of Athens,\" that, as he travelled through their beautiful city, he had not been unmindful of its attractions; that he had not been indifferent to the claims of its citizens to scholarship and culture, and that among other things he noticed an altar erected to _an unknown God_. He went on to remark, that, great as their city and nation were, God, whose offspring they were, had created other nations, who lived beyond their verdant hills and swelling rivers. And, moreover, that God had created \"all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth\" out \"of one blood.\" He called their attention to the fact that God had fenced all the nations in by geographical boundaries,--had fixed the limits of their habitation.  We find two leading thoughts in the twenty-sixth verse; viz., that this passage establishes clearly and unmistakably the unity of mankind, in that God created them of one blood; second, he hath determined \"the bounds of their habitation,\"--hath located them geographically. The language quoted is very explicit. \"He hath determined the bounds of their habitation,\" that is, \"all the nations of men.[8] We have, then, the fact, that there are different \"nations of men,\" and that they are all \"of one blood,\" and, therefore, have a common parent. This declaration was made by the Apostle Paul, an inspired writer, a teacher of great erudition, and a scholar in both the Hebrew and the Greek languages.  It should not be forgotten either, that in Paul's masterly discussion of the doctrine of sin,--the fall of man,--he always refers to Adam as the \"one man\" by whom sin came into the world.[9] His Epistle to the Romans abounds in passages which prove very plainly the unity of mankind. The Acts of the Apostles, as well as the Gospels, prove the unity we seek to establish.  But there are a few who would admit the unity of mankind, and still insist that the Negro does not belong to the human family. It is so preposterous, that one has a keen sense of humiliation in the assured consciousness that he goes rather low to meet the enemies of God's poor; but it can certainly do no harm to meet them with the everlasting truth.  In the Gospel of Luke we read this remarkable historical statement: \"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.\"[10] By referring to the map, the reader will observe that Cyrene is in Libya, on the north coast of Africa. All the commentators we have been able to consult, on the passage quoted below, agree that this man Simon was a Negro,--a black man. John Melville produced a very remarkable sermon from this passage.[11] And many of the most celebrated pictures of \"The Crucifixion,\" in Europe, represent this Cyrenian as black, and give him a very prominent place in the most tragic scene ever witnessed on this earth. In the Acts of the Apostles we have a very full and interesting account of the conversion and immersion of the Ethiopian eunuch, \"a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship.\"[12] Here, again, we find that all the commentators agree as to the nationality of the eunuch: he was a Negro; and, by implication, the passage quoted leads us to the belief that the Ethiopians were a numerous and wealthy people. Candace was the queen that made war against Augustus Cæsar twenty years before Christ, and, though not victorious, secured an honorable peace.[13] She reigned in Upper Egypt,--up the Nile,--and lived at Meroe, that ancient city, the very cradle of Egyptian civilization.[14]       \"In the time of our Saviour (and indeed from that time      forward), by Ethiopia was meant, in a general sense, the      countries south of Egypt, then but imperfectly known; of one      of which that Candace was queen whose eunuch was baptized by      Philip. Mr. Bruce, on his return from Abyssinia, found in      latitude 16° 38' a place called Chendi, where the reigning      sovereign was then a queen; and where a tradition existed      that a woman, by name Hendaque (which comes as near as      possible to the Greek name [Greek: Chandakê]), once governed      all that country. Near this place are extensive ruins,      consisting of broken pedestals and obelisks, which Bruce      conjectures to be those of Meroe, the capital of the African      Ethiopia, which is described by Herodotus as a great city in      his time, namely, four hundred years before Christ; and      where, separated from the rest of the world by almost      impassable deserts, and enriched by the commercial      expeditions of their travelling brethren, the Cushites      continued to cultivate, so late as the first century of the      Christian era, some portions of those arts and sciences to      which the settlers in the cities had always more or less      devoted themselves.\"[15]  But a few writers have asserted, and striven to prove, that the Egyptians and Ethiopians are quite a different people from the Negro. Jeremiah seems to have understood that these people about whom we have been writing were Negroes,--we mean black. \"Can the Ethiopian,\" asks the prophet, \"change his skin, or the leopard his spots?\" The prophet was as thoroughly aware that the Ethiopian was black, as that the leopard had spots; and Luther's German has for the word \"Ethiopia,\" \"Negro-land,\"--the country of the blacks.[16] The word \"Ethiop\" in the Greek literally means \"sunburn.\"  That these Ethiopians were black, we have, in addition to the valuable testimony of Jeremiah, the scholarly evidence of Herodotus, Homer, Josephus, Eusebius, Strabo, and others.  It will be necessary for us to use the term \"Cush\" farther along in this discussion: so we call attention at this time to the fact, that the Cushites, so frequently referred to in the Scriptures, are the same as the Ethiopians.  Driven from unscriptural and untenable ground on the unity of the races of mankind, the enemies of the Negro, falling back in confusion, intrench themselves in the curse of Canaan. \""]]]
