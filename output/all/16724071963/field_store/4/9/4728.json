At the place where we landed there is barely sufficient room for the steamer to turn round for the bay, or arm, of the River Zarra is small, and the water shoal. Every available place near the landing was crowded, however, with crafts of all descriptions, from the light-draughted schooner to huge launches, with loads of goods which they had received from ships lying in Hobson's Bay. Altogether, the scene reminded one very much of San Francisco; and so our spirits rose as we contemplated the bustle going on.  \"Well, my men, are you in want of work?\" asked a well-dressed elderly gentleman, who had arrived in a carriage driven by a coachman in livery, and a footman, dressed in the same garb. He appeared to own every thing that he looked at; for we had seen half a dozen men take his orders, and then proceed to obey them with alacrity.  \"We thought we'd try the mines first,\" I replied, in answer to his question.  \"Hard work--hard work,\" he said, with a smile. \"Americans, I see--smart men in that country. Hope you'll do well here. Afraid not if you go to the mines. Want men to help get these goods under shelter. Like to employ you;\" and off he bustled.  \"A pretty good sort of man, I guess,\" remarked Fred.  \"I say, stranger,\" I asked, turning to a person with a cartman's frock on, who was seated on a box smoking a pipe, \"can you tell me who that gentleman is?\"  \"I didn't see any gentleman,\" he answered, without even taking his pipe from his mouth.  \"Why, I mean the one who just spoke to us--the man with the white vest and gold buttons.\"  \"Him--he's a ticket-of-leave man, and has more money than half of the merchants in Melbourne,\" replied the cartman.  \"What, that man a convict?\" I asked, with surprise.  \"Just so--transported for fourteen years for house-breaking. Behaved himself, and so got liberty to enter into business; and now he is at the top of the heap. In two years his time will be out, and then he can stay or go where he pleases.\"  After this piece of news the convict became an object of curiosity to us, and we watched him until he entered his carriage and drove off, his coachman treating him with as much respect as he would the governor general.  \"I say,\" asked Fred of our new acquaintance, \"do all convicts get rich? Because if they do I want to become one as soon as possible.\"  \"Not all,\" replied the man; \"but some blunder into luck, and others are shrewd and look after the chances. I don't suppose I shall ever be rich, although I am doing pretty well.\"  \"And are you a--\"  I didn't like to say convict, and so I hesitated.  \"O, yes; I was sentenced to ten years' transportation for writing another man's name instead of my own on a piece of paper.\"  \"That is forgery.\"  The convict smiled, as much as to say, you have hit it, and continued to smoke his pipe with infinite satisfaction.  \"I should like to know if the company we are likely to meet in the mines are of the same class?\" muttered Fred.  \"Most of them,\" replied the man, who appeared to be a man of education; \"and you'll find them more honest than those never sentenced, because they know that their freedom depends upon their reputation.\"  We sat staring at our informant for some time; but after a while he knocked the ashes from his pipe, and arose as though going.  \"If you want your traps taken to the mines at a reasonable rate, I'll do it for you, as I start to-morrow with a load of goods for Ballarat,\" he said, after a moment's hesitation.  \"Is that mine productive?\" we asked.  \"It's as rich as any of them. You may sink a shaft and strike a vein, and you may get nothing. It's all a lottery.\"  We consulted together for a few minutes, and concluded to try our fortunes at Ballarat, and so signified to our acquaintance.  \"Then shoulder your traps, and I'll show you my shanty. You can sleep there to-night, and, let me tell you, it's a favor that I wouldn't grant to half of my countrymen.\"  As we considered pride out of place in that country, we readily accepted his offer, and in a few minutes were walking through the streets of Melbourne with a convicted felon.  We found his hut to be built of rough boards, with but one room; and the furniture consisted of a stove, wooden benches, a pine table, and a curiosity in the shape of a bedstead.  That night we learned more of the customs of the Australians from our host, who gave the name of Smith as the one which he was to be called by, than we should have found out by a six months' residence.  Over a bottle of whiskey, which was made in Yankeeland, we spent our first night in Australia.  \"Come,\" said Smith, about ten o'clock, \"it's time we were asleep, for we start early in the morning, and before to-morrow night you'll not feel as fresh as you do at present.\"  As he spoke he removed the whiskey, and in half an hour deep snoring was the only sound of life in the convict's hut.     CHAPTER II.  A MORNING IN AUSTRALIA.--JOURNEY TO THE MINES OF BALLARAT.--THE CONVICT'S STORY.--BLACK DARNLEY, THE BUSHRANGER.   \"Hallo!\" cried a gruff voice, accompanied by a gentle shake, which was sufficient to arouse Fred and myself from a deep sleep, that was probably caused by the whiskey.  The time had passed so swiftly that it did not seem an hour since we had first stretched ourselves upon our blankets on the floor.  We rubbed our eyes and sat up, looking around the Australian's hut, almost fancying that we were still dreaming. A spluttering tallow candle was dimly burning, stuck in the neck of a porter bottle, and a fire was lighted in the old broken stove, on which was hissing a spider filled with small bits of beef and pieces of potatoes. A sauce pan was doing duty for a coffee-pot, and the fragrant berry was agreeable to the nostrils of hungry men. Our host, the convict Smith, after he had aroused us, seated himself upon a three-legged stool, and was busily employed stirring up the savory mess, and trying to make a wheezy pipe draw; and as the tobacco which he was smoking was damp, and the meat was liable to burn, his time was fully occupied.  \"Come, rouse up.\" Smith said, when he saw that we were awake; and while he spoke, he was trying to coax a coal into the pipe, but it obstinately refused to go.  \"We'll be off in an hour's time; so I'm getting a little bit of breakfast ready before we start. Get up, and help me set the table.\"  We rolled up our blankets, and in a few minutes had drawn the rough table to the middle of the room, and placed thereupon our tin plates and quart pots.  As breakfast was not quite ready, I strolled out of doors, and found that the first streaks of daylight were just visible, and the stars looked white and silverish. There were no clouds to obscure the sight, and for a short time I stood watching the gradual changes that were taking place as the sun edged its way towards the horizon. First long streaks of a bright golden color were extended like huge arms, and then they changed to a subdued pink tint that defied the art of a painter to transfer to canvas. Glorious are the views to be obtained in Australia at sunrise, and if those of Italy excel them, it must indeed be a land for poets and painters.  A heavy dew had fallen during the night, and refreshed the aromatic plants that sprouted beneath my feet; and as they were crushed by my heavy tread, they yielded up their life with a perfumed breath that filled the air with fragrance, and made me regret that I had no other means of locomotion beside my feet.  The heavy rumbling of carts over the dry streets was heard, and an occasional crack of the dreadful whip and the fierce shout of the driver proved that there were others stirring as early as ourselves.  \"Breakfast is ready,\" shouted Fred from the door of the hut; and I retraced my steps to the home of the convict, whom I found still sucking his pipe and pouring out the coffee.  Our meal was soon over, for the delicacy of civilized life was not particularly observed, and our long seclusion from the society of females had rendered us little better than savages, as far as manners were concerned.  \"Now, then, pack up your traps, and he ready for a start. I'll be along here with my team in half an hour, as my freight is already loaded.\"  \"Rut we shall need provisions for the route,\" I said.  \"Of course you will; but as I have to take some for myself, I'll get a quantity for you also, and charge just what I pay. At Ballarat you'll find enough to eat, and men to trust you if short of money.\"  Smith left to get his cattle, and while absent we washed the tin pans and got all ready for a start. Our rifles were reloaded, and revolvers examined, and after we had indulged in the luxury of a smoke, we heard the voice of the convict shouting in no gentle tones to his oxen, as they stopped in front of the hut.  \"All ready?\" asked Smith, coiling up his long whip, at the sight of which the cattle fairly trembled, and pricked up their ears as though ready for a stampede.  \"All ready,\" we answered, bringing out our traps and lashing them on the team.  The coffee pot and skillet were not forgotten, as we calculated if we met any game they would both be of service. A keg of water, a bottle of whiskey, a bag of ship bread, a large piece of pork, a few potatoes, coffee, a bag of flour, and a bag of sugar, were the articles needed for our long journey to the mines of Ballarat.  Smith locked the door of his hut, hung the key about his neck attached to a thick cord, and then, uncoiling his dreadful whip, he sounded the signal for an advance.  The cattle strained at their yokes, and the huge, clumsy, English-built team creaked over the road, and groaned as though offering strong remonstrance against the journey.  There were five yoke of oxen attached to the cart, and as they were in fair condition and had not been worked for a few days, they took the load along the level road at a brisk walk; and it was not until we had got beyond the city's limits and left"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16050"],["title","The Gold Hunters' Adventures; Or, Life in Australia (#3)"],["body","in the distance, that the animals fell into their accustomed steady walk.  \"I suppose that there is but little use in our carrying our rifles in our hands?\" I asked of Smith, as he walked by the side of the cattle.  \"I have been waiting for you to ask the question ever since we left Melbourne,\" Smith replied; \"I thought I wouldn't say any thing until you got tired of carrying them. There is but little fear of our meeting with bushrangers so near the city; and as for game, we may see some, but not within rifle range. Put your guns in the cart, and don't touch them until we camp to-night.\"  We gladly followed his advice, for the sun had risen, and began scorching us with its rays, although, when we started, the air was quite cool, and a jacket was not uncomfortable.  \"How far is Geelong from Melbourne?\" I asked, after we had relieved ourselves of the rifles.  \"Between fifty and sixty miles.\"  \"Do we pass near the town?\"  \"No, we branch off near Mount Macedonskirt, the range of mountains by that name, and which you can see in the distance; cross a barren tract of country, where no water but sink-holes is to be found for forty miles; strike the mines of Victoria; and then we are near the gold fields of Ballarat.\"  \"Where I hope we shall make a fortune and return to Melbourne in less than six months,\" Fred cried.  \"Amen,\" ejaculated Smith; but he smiled as he thought what a slight chance there was of our prayers being answered.  We met some half a dozen teams on their way back to Melbourne from the mines, and we surveyed the drivers as we would rare animals, for they were covered with a thick coating of white dust that had filled their hair and whiskers, and looked as though a bushel of corn meal had been scattered over their heads.  Each cart contained two or more invalids, who appeared, by their dejected air, to have taken farewell of the world, and didn't think it worth while attempting to live any longer; and when a question was asked them, it was with great reluctance that they returned an answer, and if they did speak, it was in tones so faint that with difficulty they could be understood.  Three times did the convict stop his cart to supply some little luxury to the invalids; and while he declined payment for his refreshments, it did not prevent him from requesting the sick men to say, when they reached Melbourne, that they had been befriended by himself. We were struck by this peculiarity, and as soon as the team's moved on, we resolved to inquire the reason.  \"Why are you so particular that those men should mention your name for the charities that you perform?\" asked Fred.  Smith smiled, but it was of the melancholy sort of mirth, and did not come from his heart. He hesitated, as though considering whether he should make a full expression or reserve his confidence. At length he said,--  \"I told you that I was sentenced to transportation for ten years. Five of them have passed, and I am at liberty to trade on my own account, yet liable at any moment to be remanded back to my old station, and work worse than a slave on the docks, or at any menial employment. I have so far managed very well. I have saved money, and own shares in the Royal Bank of Melbourne, besides two good houses that are paying me a large percentage. The property is mine, and government cannot touch a penny of it; yet I would willingly give all that I possess to be at liberty to call myself a free man, and to know that I am no longer watched by those in power. When I received my sentence I determined upon the course I would adopt. I never murmured at my work, no matter how disagreeable it was--I was respectful and obedient, and after a year's hardship I was favorably reported at head quarters, and was then allowed to live with a man who kept cattle, and had made a fortune as a drover. I served him faithfully for two years, and upon his report I was allowed a ticket of leave, and commenced business for myself. I am comparatively a free man; but if any unfavorable report should be heard concerning me, farewell to my present liberty. For five long years I should be used like a brute, and before my term expired I should be in a felon's grave; for a man must possess a constitution of iron to endure the tasks that are inflicted upon a convict remanded back to the tender mercies of overseers whose hearts are harder than the ball and chain which many of their prisoners wear.\"  \"And you really think that the relief you afford to those returned miners will be heard of, and that it will mitigate your sentence?\"  \"Certainly. The poor fellows will go to the hospital, and while there I shall be held in grateful remembrance. The physician will hear of my name, and one of these days I hope to receive a full pardon. But whether I do or not, I shall be conscious that I have done my duty, and in some measure atoned for the crime that I committed.\"  Smith cracked his long whip to let the oxen know that he was not asleep, and the cattle, rousing from their snail pace at the sound of the scourge, accelerated their steps, and strained at their yokes as though they would tear them from their necks.  We remained silent while getting over a mile of the dusty road; but, as the oxen fell into their slow pace again, we renewed the conversation.  \"You think that the system of letting convicts have leave tickets is a good one, then?\" we asked.  \"In some cases I think that it works well; but all men are not alike, and while some play the hypocrite and profess good conduct, others are never allowed their liberty because they brood over their past life so much that they never smile. They are marked as sullen and discontented, and are worked until their spirits are broken, and they no longer hope for freedom. The energy and enterprise of liberated felons have increased the trade of Australia until she is no longer a burden to the mother country, and I hope, before I die, to see this island conducted as an independent government. It would be better for England, and I need not tell you how much better it would be for us.\"  \"Are the bushrangers, that we hear so much about, really dangerous fellows to meet?\" we asked.  \"They are the very scum of the great cities of England--desperate men who are usually sentenced for life, and therefore have no hope of mercy; and many of them desire none. As soon as they can effect an escape they do so, and fleeing to the wilds of the island, either join a band of ruffians like themselves, or else, fearful of trusting to men that are as treacherous as wolves, will roam without companions for many days, living upon sheep, which are easily obtained from herds without the knowledge of the shepherds, and very often with their consent, to be at last betrayed and shot by the very man who was trusted most. There are hundreds of them upon the very route that we must take, and every day there are murders and robberies committed, and all the vigilance of the guard, who escort gold dust from the mines to Melbourne, is necessary to insure its protection.  \"Teams like our own, however, are most attended to, and if we should wake up in the night, and by the light of the camp fire see half a dozen ferocious-looking fellows standing over us, it would be better to let them take what they want, and go their way in peace, than to trust to an appeal to arms or oppose them. Once rouse them to anger, and our lives would not be worth a sixpence; for they think no more of shedding the blood of a man than they would that of a sheep.\"  \"I think it would be better to give them a trial than be robbed, especially when we possess weapons like these,\" cried Fred, touching his revolver, which he carried in a belt around his waist.  Smith looked at my companion for a moment in silence, as though trying to satisfy himself whether Fred was in earnest, or only talking because danger was remote.  \"I've carried many men to the mines,\" he said at length, \"and been robbed some half a dozen times; but I always found that while my passengers were firm for resistance at the beginning of the journey, yet at night a different opinion was formed, and the boldest has consented to give up a shirt or pair of boots without a murmur.\"  Fred laughed good naturedly, and spoke jestingly in reply.  \"That was because you never freighted Americans. Englishmen may consent to have their boots pulled off, but Yankees would be apt to remonstrate.\"  \"I hope that we shall have no occasion to test your courage,\" said Smith; \"but if we meet Black Darnley, I shall not blame you for keeping quiet.\"  \"And who is Black Darnley?\" we asked.  \"An escaped convict, who has been at large for three years; and, in spite of the two hundred pounds reward, no one has ventured to attempt his capture. He swears that he will never be taken alive, and he will keep his word. He has no fear of two or even three ordinary men, for he possesses the strength of a Hercules and the desperation of a wounded tiger. Of all the bushrangers on the island, he is the worst; and yet he always treats me well, and lets me pass without levying toll, for he and I are old acquaintances, and often have a social chat together about times gone by.\"  \"Tell us where you first met him,\" we said, crowding nearer the convict to hear his story.  \"Wait until we halt for a rest and feed the cattle. Half a mile from here is a small stream of water, and under the shade of some trees near at hand, we'll boil our coffee, and then I'll tell you about my first meeting with Black Darnley.\"  As it was about noon, and we had travelled near twelve miles, the proposed halt was any thing but disagreeable. Besides, the sun was nearly overhead, burning and scorching us with its intense rays, and causing the oxen to protrude their tongues and drag their weary feet along as though they hardly possessed life enough to reach the water spoken of.  A sharp crack of Smith's whip and the cattle started into life again; and as he continued to flourish the dreaded lash"]]]
