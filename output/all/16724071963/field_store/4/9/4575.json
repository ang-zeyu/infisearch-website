Then came the baking, which for two days filled the house with spicy, plum-puddingy odors; then the great feat of icing the big square loaves; and then the cutting up, in which all took part. There was much careful measurement that the slices might be an exact fit; and the kitchen rang with bright laughter and chat as Katy and Clover wielded the sharp bread-knives, and the others fitted the portions into their boxes, and tied the ribbons in crisp little bows. Many delicious crumbs and odd corners and fragments fell to the share of the younger workers; and altogether the occasion struck Amy as so enjoyable that she announced--with her mouth full--that she had changed her mind, and that Mabel might get married as often as she pleased, if she would have cake like _that_ every time,--a liberality of permission which Mabel listened to with her invariable waxen smile.  When all was over, and the last ribbons tied, the hundreds of little boxes were stacked in careful piles on a shelf of the inner closet of the doctor's office to wait till they were wanted,--an arrangement which naughty Clover pronounced eminently suitable, since there should always be a doctor close at hand where there was so much wedding-cake. But before all this was accomplished, came what Katy, in imitation of one of Miss Edgeworth's heroines, called \"The Day of Happy Letters.\"     CHAPTER II.  THE DAY OF HAPPY LETTERS.   The arrival of the morning boat with letters and newspapers from the East was the great event of the day in Burnet. It was due at eleven o'clock; and everybody, consciously or unconsciously, was on the lookout for it. The gentlemen were at the office bright and early, and stood chatting with each other, and fingering the keys of their little drawers till the rattle of the shutter announced that the mail was distributed. Their wives and daughters at home, meanwhile, were equally in a state of expectation, and whatever they might be doing kept ears and eyes on the alert for the step on the gravel and the click of the latch which betokened the arrival of the family news-bringer.  Doctors cannot command their time like other people, and Dr. Carr was often detained by his patients, and made late for the mail, so it was all the pleasanter a surprise when on the great day of the cake-baking he came in earlier than usual, with his hands quite full of letters and parcels. All the girls made a rush for him at once; but he fended them off with an elbow, while with teasing slowness he read the addresses on the envelopes.  \"Miss Carr--Miss Carr--Miss Katherine Carr--Miss Carr again; four for you, Katy. Dr. P. Carr,--a bill and a newspaper, I perceive; all that an old country doctor with a daughter about to be married ought to expect, I suppose. Miss Clover E. Carr,--one for the 'Confidante in white linen.' Here, take it, Clovy. Miss Carr again. Katy, you have the lion's share. Miss Joanna Carr,--in the unmistakable handwriting of Miss Inches. Miss Katherine Carr, care Dr. Carr. That looks like a wedding present, Katy. Miss Elsie Carr; Cecy's hand, I should say. Miss Carr once more,--from the conquering hero, judging from the post-mark. Dr. Carr,--another newspaper, and--hollo!--one more for Miss Carr. Well, children, I hope for once you are satisfied with the amount of your correspondence. My arm fairly aches with the weight of it. I hope the letters are not so heavy inside as out.\"  \"I am quite satisfied, Papa, thank you,\" said Katy, looking up with a happy smile from Ned's letter, which she had torn open first of all. \"Are you going, dear?\" She laid her packages down to help him on with his coat. Katy never forgot her father.  \"Yes, I am going. Time and rheumatism wait for no man. You can tell me your news when I come back.\"  It is not fair to peep into love letters, so I will only say of Ned's that it was very long, very entertaining,--Katy thought,--and contained the pleasant information that the \"Natchitoches\" was to sail four days after it was posted, and would reach New York a week sooner than any one had dared to hope. The letter contained several other things as well, which showed Katy how continually she had been in his thoughts,--a painting on rice paper, a dried flower or two, a couple of little pen-and-ink sketches of the harbor of Santa Lucia and the shipping, and a small cravat of an odd convent lace folded very flat and smooth. Altogether it was a delightful letter, and Katy read it, as it were, in leaps, her eyes catching at the salient points, and leaving the details to be dwelt upon when she should be alone.  This done, she thrust the letter into her pocket, and proceeded to examine the others. The first was in Cousin Helen's clear, beautiful handwriting:--      DEAR KATY,--If any one had told us ten years ago that in this     particular year of grace you would be getting ready to be     married, and I preparing to come to your wedding, I think we     should have listened with some incredulity, as to an agreeable     fairy tale which could not possibly come true. We didn't look     much like it, did we,--you in your big chair and I on my sofa?     Yet here we are! When your letter first reached me it seemed a     sort of impossible thing that I should accept your invitation;     but the more I thought about it the more I felt as if I must,     and now things seem to be working round to that end quite     marvellously. I have had a good winter, but the doctor wishes me     to try the experiment of the water cure again which benefited me     so much the summer of your accident. This brings me in your     direction; and I don't see why I might not come a little earlier     than I otherwise should, and have the great pleasure of seeing     you married, and making acquaintance with Lieutenant     Worthington. That is, if you are perfectly sure that to have at     so busy a time a guest who, like the Queen of Spain, has the     disadvantage of being without legs, will not be more care than     enjoyment. Think seriously over this point, and don't send for     me unless you are certain. Meanwhile, I am making ready. Alex     and Emma and little Helen--who is a pretty big Helen now--are to     be my escorts as far as Buffalo on their way to Niagara. After     that is all plain sailing, and Jane Carter and I can manage very     well for ourselves. It seems like a dream to think that I may     see you all so soon; but it is such a pleasant one that I would     not wake up on any account.      I have a little gift which I shall bring you myself, my Katy;     but I have a fancy also that you shall wear some trifling thing     on your wedding-day which comes from me, so for fear of being     forestalled I will say now, please don't buy any stockings for     the occasion, but wear the pair which go with this, for the sake     of your loving       COUSIN HELEN.  \"These must be they,\" cried Elsie, pouncing on one of the little packages. \"May I cut the string, Katy?\"  Permission was granted; and Elsie cut the string. It was indeed a pair of beautiful white silk stockings embroidered in an open pattern, and far finer than anything which Katy would have thought of choosing for herself.  \"Don't they look exactly like Cousin Helen?\" she said, fondling them. \"Her things always are choicer and prettier than anybody's else, somehow. I can't think how she does it, when she never by any chance goes into a shop. Who can this be from, I wonder?\"  \"This\" was the second little package. It proved to contain a small volume bound in white and gold, entitled, \"Advice to Brides.\" On the fly-leaf appeared this inscription:--      To Katherine Carr, on the occasion of her approaching bridal,     from her affectionate teacher,                                       MARIANNE NIPSON.      1 Timothy, ii. 11.  Clover at once ran to fetch her Testament that she might verify the quotation, and announced with a shriek of laughter that it was: \"Let the women learn in silence with all subjection;\" while Katy, much diverted, read extracts casually selected from the work, such as: \"A wife should receive her husband's decree without cavil or question, remembering that the husband is the head of the wife, and that in all matters of dispute his opinion naturally and scripturally outweighs her own.\"  Or: \"'A soft answer turneth away wrath.' If your husband comes home fretted and impatient, do not answer him sharply, but soothe him with gentle words and caresses. Strict attention to the minor details of domestic management will often avail to secure peace.\"  And again: \"Keep in mind the epitaph raised in honor of an exemplary wife of the last century,--'She never banged the door.' Qualify yourself for a similar testimonial.\"  \"Tanta never does bang doors,\" remarked Amy, who had come in as this last \"elegant extract\" was being read.  \"No, that's true; she doesn't,\" said Clover. \"Her prevailing vice is to leave them open. I like that truth about a good dinner 'availing' to secure peace, and the advice to 'caress' your bear when he is at his crossest. Ned never does issue 'decrees,' though, I fancy; and on the whole, Katy, I don't believe Mrs. Nipson's present is going to be any particular comfort in your future trials. Do read something else to take the taste out of our mouths. We will listen in 'all subjection.'\"  Katy was already deep in a long epistle from Rose.  \"This is too delicious,\" she said; \"do listen.\" And she began again at the beginning:--      MY SWEETEST OF ALL OLD SWEETS,--Come to your wedding! Of course     I shall. It would never seem to me to have any legal sanction     whatever if I were not there to add my blessing. Only let me     know which day \"early in June\" it is to be, that I may make     ready. Deniston will fetch us on, and by a special piece of good     luck, a man in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15798"],["title","Clover (#3)"],["body","o--whose name I shall always bless if only     I can remember what it is--has been instigated by our mutual     good angel to want him on business just about that time; so that     he would have to go West anyway, and would rather have me along     than not, and is perfectly resigned to his fate. I mean to come     three days before, and stay three days after the wedding, if I     may, and altogether it is going to be a lark of larks. Little     Rose can talk quite fluently now, and almost read; that is, she     knows six letters of her picture alphabet. She composes poems     also. The other day she suddenly announced,--      \"Mamma, I have made up a sort of a im. May I say it to you?\"      I naturally consented, and this was the                     IM.      Jump in the parlor,     Jump in the hall,     God made us all!       Now did you ever hear of anything quite so dear as that, for a     baby only three years and five months old? I tell you she is a     wonder. You will all adore her, Clover particularly. Oh, my dear     little C.! To think I am going to see her!      I met both Ellen Gray and Esther Dearborn the other day, and     where do you think it was? At Mary Silver's wedding! Yes, she is     actually married to the Rev. Charles Playfair Strothers, and     settled in a little parsonage somewhere in the Hoosac     Tunnel,--or near it,--and already immersed in \"duties.\" I can't     think what arguments he used to screw her up to the rash act;     but there she is.      It wasn't exactly what one would call a cheerful wedding. All     the connection took it very seriously; and Mary's uncle, who     married her, preached quite a lengthy funeral discourse to the     young couple, and got them nicely ready for death, burial, and     the next world, before he would consent to unite them for this.     He was a solemn-looking old person, who had been a missionary,     and \"had laid away three dear wives in foreign lands,\" as he     confided to me afterward over a plate of ice-cream. He seemed     to me to be \"taking notice,\" as they say of babies, and it is     barely possible that he mistook me for a single woman, for his     attentions were rather pronounced till I introduced my husband     prominently into conversation; after that he seemed more     attracted by Ellen Gray.      Mary cried straight through the ceremony. In fact, I imagine she     cried straight through the engagement, for her eyes looked wept     out and had scarlet rims, and she was as white as her veil. In     fact, whiter, for that was made of beautiful _point de Venise_,     and was just a trifle yellowish. Everybody cried. Her mother and     sister sobbed aloud, so did several maiden aunts and a     grandmother or two and a few cousins. The church resounded with     guggles and gasps, like a great deal of bath-water running out     of an ill-constructed tub. Mr. Silver also wept, as a business     man may, in a series of sniffs interspersed with silk     handkerchief; you know the kind. Altogether it was a most     cheerless affair. I seemed to be the only person present who was     not in tears; but I really didn't see anything to cry about, so     far as I was concerned, though I felt very hard-hearted.      I had to go alone, for Deniston was in New York. I got to the     church rather early, and my new spring bonnet--which is a     superior one--seemed to impress the ushers, so they put me in a     very distinguished front pew all by myself. I bore my honors     meekly, and found them quite agreeable, in fact,--you know I     always did like to be made much of,--so you can imagine my     disgust when presently three of the stoutest ladies you ever saw     came sailing up the aisle, and prepared to invade _my_ pew.      \"Please move up, Madam,\" said the fattest of all, who wore a     wonderful yellow hat.      But I was not \"raised\" at Hillsover for nothing, and remembering     the success of our little ruse on the railroad train long ago, I     stepped out into the aisle, and with my sweetest smile made room     for them to pass.      \"Perhaps I would better keep the seat next the door,\" I murmured     to the yellow lady, \"in case an attack should come on.\"      \"An attack!\" she repeated in an accent of alarm. She whispered     to the others. All three eyed me suspiciously, while I stood     looking as pensive and suffering as I could. Then after     confabulating together for a little, they all swept into the     seat behind mine, and I heard them speculating in low tones as     to whether it was epilepsy or catalepsy or convulsions that I     was subject to. I presume they made signs to all the other     people who came in to steer clear of the lady with fits, for     nobody invaded my privacy, and I sat in lonely splendor with a     pew to myself, and was very comfortable indeed.      Mary's dress was white satin, with a great deal of point lace     and pearl passementerie, and she wore a pair of diamond     ear-rings which her father gave her, and a bouquet almost but     not quite as large, which was the gift of the bridegroom. He has     a nice face, and I think Silvery Mary will be happy with him,     much happier than with her rather dismal family, though his     salary is only fifteen hundred a year, and pearl passementerie,     I believe, quite unknown and useless in the Hoosac region. She     had loads of the most beautiful presents you ever saw. All the     Silvers are rolling in riches, you know. One little thing made     me laugh, for it was so like her. When the clergyman said,     \"Mary, wilt thou take this man to be thy wedded husband?\" I     distinctly saw her put her fingers over her mouth in the old,     frightened way. It was only for a second, and after that I     rather think Mr. Strothers held her hand tight for fear she     might do it again. She sent her love to you, Katy. What sort of     a gown are _you_ going to have, by the way?      I have kept my best news to the last, which is that Deniston has     at last given way, and we are to move into town in October. We     have taken a little house in West Cedar Street. It is quite     small and very dingy and I presume inconvenient, but I already     love it to distraction, and feel as if I should sit up all night     for the first month to enjoy the sensation of being no longer     that horrid thing, a resident of the suburbs. I hunt the paper     shops and collect samples of odd and occult pattern, and compare     them with carpets, and am altogether in my element, only longing     for the time to come when I may put together my pots and pans     and betake me across the mill-dam. Meantime, Roslein is living     in a state of quarantine. She is not permitted to speak with any     other children, or even to look out of window at one, for fear     she may contract some sort of contagious disease, and spoil our     beautiful visit to Burnet. She sends you a kiss, and so do I;     and mother and Sylvia and Deniston and grandmamma, particularly,     desire their love.       Your loving                  ROSE RED.  \"Oh,\" cried Clover, catching Katy round the waist, and waltzing wildly about the room, \"what a delicious letter! What fun we are going to have! It seems too good to be true. Tum-ti-ti, tum-ti-ti. Keep step, Katy. I forgive you for the first time for getting married. I never did before, really and truly. Tum-ti-ti; I am so happy that I must dance!\"  \"There go my letters,\" said Katy, as with the last rapid twirl, Rose's many-sheeted epistle and the \"Advice to Brides\" flew to right and left. \"There go two of your hair-pins, Clover. Oh, do stop; we shall all be in pieces.\"  Clover brought her gyrations to a close by landing her unwilling partner suddenly on the sofa. Then with a last squeeze and a rapid kiss she began to pick up the scattered letters.  \"Now read the rest,\" she commanded, \"though anything else will sound flat after Rose's.\"  \"Hear this first,\" said Elsie, who had taken advantage of the pause to open her own letter. \"It is from Cecy, and she says she is coming to spend a month with her mother on purpose to be here for Katy's wedding. She sends heaps of love to you, Katy, and says she only hopes that Mr. Worthington will prove as perfectly satisfactory in all respects as her own dear Sylvester.\"  \"My gracious, I should hope he would,\" put in Clover, who was still in the wildest spirits. \"What a dear old goose Cecy is! I never hankered in the least for Sylvester Slack, did you, Katy?\"  \"Certainly not. It would be a most improper proceeding if I had,\" replied Katy, with a laugh. \"Whom do you think this letter is from, girls? Do listen to it. It's written by that nice old Mr. Allen Beach, whom we met in London. Don't you recollect my telling you about him?\"      MY DEAR MISS CARR,--Our friends in Harley Street have told me a     piece of news concerning you which came to them lately in a     letter from Mrs. Ashe, and I hope you will permit me to offer     you my most sincere congratulations and good wishes. I recollect     meeting Lieutenant Worthington when he was here two years ago,     and liking him very much. One is always glad in a foreign land     to be able to show so good a specimen of one's young countrymen     as he affords,--not that England need be counted as a foreign     country by any American, and least of all by myself, who have     found it a true home for so many years.      As a little souvenir of our week of sight-seeing together, of     which I retain most agreeable remembrances, I have sent you by     my friends the Sawyers, who sail for America shortly, a copy of     Hare's \"Walks in London,\" which a young _protégée_ of mine has     for the past year been illustrating with photographs of the many     curious old buildings described. You took so much interest in     them while here that I hope you may like to see them again. Will     you please accept with it my most cordial wishes for your     future, and believe"]]]
