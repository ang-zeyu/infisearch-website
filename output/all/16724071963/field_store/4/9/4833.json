H. DITSON & CO _New York_  LYON & HEALY _Chicago_     TRISTAN AND ISOLDA  _OPERA IN THREE ACTS_  BY RICHARD WAGNER  BOSTON OLIVER DITSON COMPANY  CHAS. H. DITSON & CO. NEW YORK  LYON & HEALY CHICAGO     THE STORY OF \"TRISTAN AND ISOLDA\"  ACT I  Tristan, a valiant Cornish knight, is bringing Isolda, princess of Ireland, over as a bride for his uncle, King Mark. He is himself in love with her, but owing to a blood feud between them, forces himself to conceal his passion. Isolda, in anger at his seeming unkindness, attempts to poison herself and him, but her attendant, Brangæna, changes the draft for a love potion, which enflames their passion beyond power of restraint.   ACT II  Isolda has been wedded to King Mark, but holds stolen interviews with Tristan, during one of which they are surprised, for Tristan has been betrayed by a jealous friend, Melot. Touched by King Mark's bitter reproaches, Tristan provokes Melot to fight and suffers himself to be mortally wounded.   ACT III  Tristan's faithful servant, Kurvenal, has carried his wounded master to his native home in Brittany, where he is carefully tended. Isolda has also been sent for, as being skilled above all others in the healing art. The excitement of her approach only hastens Tristan's death, and he breathes his last sigh in her arms. Mark has followed Isolda; he has had matters explained, and is prepared to reunite the lovers, but it is too late. Isolda utters her lament over the body of her lover, and her heart breaks: in death alone are they united.         *       *       *       *       *  DRAMATIS PERSONÆ  TRISTAN KING MARK ISOLDA KURVENAL MELOT BRANGÆNA A SHEPHERD A STEERSMAN SAILORS, KNIGHTS, AND ESQUIRES     TRISTAN AND ISOLDA.     ACT I.  [_A pavilion erected on the deck of a ship, richly hung with tapestry, quite closed in at back at first. A narrow hatchway at one side leads below into the cabin_.]   SCENE I.  ISOLDA _on a couch, her face buried in the cushions. --_BRANGÆNA_ holding open a curtain, looks over the side of the vessel_.  THE VOICE OF A YOUNG SAILOR (_from above as if at the mast-head_).  ISOLDA (_starting up suddenly_). What wight dares insult me?  (_She looks round in agitation_.)  Brangæna, ho! Say, where sail we?  BRANGÆNA (_at the opening_). Bluish stripes are stretching along the west: swiftly sails the ship to shore; if restful the sea by eve we shall readily set foot on land.  ISOLDA. What land?  BRANGÆNA. Cornwall's verdant strand.  ISOLDA. Never more! To-day nor to-morrow!  BRANGÆNA. What mean you, mistress? say!  (_She lets the curtain fall and hastens to_ ISOLDA.)  ISOLDA (_with wild gaze_). O fainthearted child, false to thy fathers! Ah, where, mother, hast given thy might that commands the wave and the tempest? O subtle art of sorcery, for mere leech-craft followed too long! Awake in me once more, power of will! Arise from thy hiding within my breast! Hark to my bidding, fluttering breezes! Arise and storm in boisterous strife! With furious rage and hurricane's hurdle waken the sea from slumbering calm; rouse up the deep to its devilish deeds! Shew it the prey which gladly I proffer! Let it shatter this too daring ship and enshrine in ocean each shred! And woe to the lives! Their wavering death-sighs I leave to ye, winds, as your lot.  BRANGÆNA (_in extreme alarm and concern for_ ISOLDA). Out, alas! Ah, woe! I've ever dreaded some ill!-- Isolda! mistress! Heart of mine! What secret dost thou hide? Without a tear thou'st quitted thy father and mother, and scarce a word of farewell to friends thou gavest; leaving home thou stood'st, how cold and still! pale and speechless on the way, food rejecting, reft of sleep, stern and wretched, wild, disturbed; how it pains me so to see thee! Friends no more we seem, being thus estranged. Make me partner in thy pain! Tell me freely all thy fears! Lady, thou hearest, sweetest and dearest; if for true friend you take me, your confidant O make me!  ISOLDA. Air! air! or my heart will choke! Open! open there wide!  (BRANGÆNA _hastily draws the centre curtains apart_.)   SCENE II.  [_The whole length of the ship is now seen, down to the stern, with the sea and horizon beyond. Round the mainmast sailors are ensconced, busied with ropes; beyond them in the stern are groups of knights and attendants, also seated; a little apart stands_ TRISTAN_ folding his arms and thoughtfully gazing out to sea; at his feet_ KURVENAL _reclines carelessly. From the mast-head above is once more heard the voice of the young sailor_.]  THE YOUNG SAILOR (_at the mast-head invisible_). The wind so wild blows homewards now; my Irish child, where waitest thou? Say, must our sails be weighted, filled by thy sighs unbated? Waft us, wind strong and wild! Woe, ah woe for my child!  ISOLDA (_whose eyes have at once sought_ TRISTAN _and fixed stonily on him--gloomily_). Once beloved-- now removed-- brave and bright, coward knight!-- Death-devoted head! Death-devoted heart!--  (_laughing unnaturally_).  Think'st highly of yon minion?  BRANGÆNA (_following her glance_). Whom mean'st thou?  ISOLDA. There, that hero who from mine eyes averts his own: in shrinking shame my gaze he shuns-- Say, how hold you him?  BRANGÆNA. Mean you Sir Tristan, lady mine? Extolled by ev'ry nation, his happy country's pride, The hero of creation,-- whose fame so high and wide?  ISOLDA (_jeeringly_). In shrinking trepidation his shame he seeks to hide, While to the king, his relation, he brings the corpse-like bride!-- Seems it so senseless What I say? Go ask himself, our gracious host, dare he approach my side? No courteous heed or loyal care this hero t'wards his lady turns; but to meet her his heart is daunted, this knight so highly vaunted! Oh! he wots well the cause! To the traitor go, bearing his lady's will! As my servant bound, straightway should he approach.  BRANGÆNA. Shall I beseech him to attend thee?  ISOLDA. Nay, order him: pray, understand it:-- I, Isolda do command it!  [_At an imperious sign from ISOLDA BRANGÆNA withdraws and timidly walks along the deck towards the stern, past the working sailors. ISOLDA, following her with fixed gaze, sinks back on the couch, where she remains seated during the following, her eyes still turned sternward_.]  KURVENAL (_observing Brangæna's approach, plucks Tristan by the robe without rising_.) Beware, Tristan! Message from Isolda!  TRISTAN (_starting_). What is't?--Isolda?--  (_He quickly regains his composure as BRANGÆNA approaches and curtsies to him_.)  What would my lady? I her liegeman, fain will listen while her loyal woman tells her will.  BRANGÆNA. My lord, Sir Tristan, Dame Isolda would have speech with you at once.  TRISTAN. Is she with travel worn? The end is near: nay, ere the set of sun sight we the land. All that your mistress commands me, trust me, I shall mind.  BRANGÆNA. That you, Sir Tristan, go to her,-- this is my lady's wish.  TRISTAN. Where yonder verdant meadows in distance dim are mounting, waits my sov'reign for his mate: to lead her to his presence I'll wait upon the princess: 'tis an honor all my own.  BRANGÆNA. My lord, Sir Tristan, list to me: this one thing my lady wills, that thou at once attend her, there where she waits for thee.  TRISTAN. In any station where I stand I truly serve but her, the pearl of womanhood. If I unheeding left the helm, how might I pilot her ship in surety to King Mark?  BRANGÆNA. Tristan, my master, why mock me thus? Seemeth my saying obscure to you? list to my lady's words: thus, look you, she hath spoken: \"Go order him, and understand it, I--Isolda-- do command it.\"  KURVENAL (_springing up_). May I an answer make her?  TRISTAN. What wouldst thou wish to reply?  KURVENAL. This should she say to Dame Isold': \"Though Cornwall's crown and England's isle for Ireland's child he chose, his own by choice she may not be; he brings the king his bride. A hero-knight Tristan is hight! I've said, nor care to measure your lady's high displeasure.\"  [_While_ TRISTAN _seeks to stop him, and the offended_ BRANGÆNA _turns to depart_, KURVENAL _sings after her at the top of his voice, as she lingeringly withdraws_.]  \"Sir Morold toiled o'er mighty wave the Cornish tax to levy; In desert isle was dug his grave, he died of wounds so heavy. His head now hangs in Irish lands, Sole were-gild won at English hands. Bravo, our brave Tristan! Let his tax take who can!\"  [KURVENAL, _driven away by_ TRISTAN'S _chidings, descends into the cabin_. BRANGÆNA _returns in discomposure to_ ISOLDA, _closing the curtains behind her, while all the men take up the chorus and are heard without_.]  KNIGHTS AND ATTENDANTS. \"His head now hangs in Irish lands, sole were-gild won at English hands. Bravo, our brave Tristan! Let his tax take who can!\"   SCENE III.  [ISOLDA _and_ BRANGÆNA _alone, the curtain being again completely closed_. ISOLDA _rises with a gesture of despair and wrath_. BRANGÆNA _falls at her feet_.]  BRANGÆNA. Ah! an answer so insulting!  ISOLDA (_checking herself on the brink of a fearful outburst_). How now? of Tristan? I'd know if he denies me.  BRANGÆNA. Ah! question not!  ISOLDA. Quick, say without fear!  BRANGÆNA. With courteous phrase he foiled my will.  ISOLDA. But when you bade him hither?  BRANGÆNA. When I had straightway bid him come, where'er he stood, he said to me, he truly served but thee, the pearl of womanhood; if he unheeded left the helm how could he pilot the ship in surety to King Mark?  ISOLDA (_bitterly_). \"How could he pilot the ship in surety to King Mark!\" And wait on him with were-gild from Ireland's island won!  BRANGÆNA. As I gave out the message and in thy very words, thus spoke his henchman Kurvenal--  ISOLDA. Heard I not ev'ry sentence? it all has reached my ear.

How scoffingly     they sing about me! Quickly could I requite them!     What of the boat     so bare and frail, that floated by our shore?     What of the broken     stricken man, feebly extended there?     Isolda's art     he gladly owned;     with herbs, simples     and healing salves the wounds from which he suffered she nursed in skilful wise.     Though \"Tantris\" The name that he took unto him,     as \"Tristan\" anon Isolda knew him, when in the sick man's keen blade she perceived a notch had been made,     wherein did fit     a splinter broken in Morold's head, the mangled token sent home in hatred rare: this hand did find it there. I heard a voice from distance dim; with the sword in hand I came to him. Full well I willed to slay him, for Morold's death to pay him. But from his sick bed he looked up not at the sword, not at my arm-- his eyes on mine were fastened, and his feebleness softened my heart: the sword--dropped from my fingers. Though Morold's steel had maimed him to health again I reclaimed him! when he hath homeward wended my emotion then might be ended.  BRANGÆNA. O wondrous! Why could I not see this? The guest I sometime helped to nurse--?  ISOLDA. His praise briskly they sing now:-- \"Bravo, our brave Tristan!\"-- he was that distressful man. A thousand protestations of truth and love he prated. Hear how a knight fealty knows!-- When as Tantris unforbidden he'd left me, as Tristan boldly back he came, in stately ship from which in pride Ireland's heiress in marriage he asked for Mark, the Cornish monarch, his kinsman worn and old. In Morold's lifetime dared any have dreamed to offer us such an insult? For the tax-paying Cornish prince to presume to court Ireland's princess! Ah, woe is me! I it was who for myself did shape this shame! with death-dealing sword should I have stabbed him; weakly it escaped me:-- now serfdom I have shaped me. Curse him, the villain! Curse on his head! Vengeance! Death! Death for me too!  BRANGÆNA (_throwing herself upon_ ISOLDA _with impetuous tenderness_). Isolda! lady! loved one! fairest! sweet perfection! mistress rarest! Hear me! come now, sit thee here.--  (_Gradually draws_ ISOLDA _to the couch_.)  What a whim! what causeless railing! How came you so wrong-minded and by mere fancy blinded? Sir Tristan gives thee Cornwall's kingdom; then, were he erst thy debtor, how could he reward thee better? His noble uncle serves he so: think too what a gift on thee he'd bestow! With honor unequalled all he's heir to at thy feet he seeks to shower, to make thee a queenly dower.  (ISOLDA _turns away_.)  If wife he'd make thee unto King Mark why wert thou in this wise complaining? Is he not worth thy gaining? Of royal race and mild of mood, who passes King Mark in might and power? If a noble knight like Tristan serves him, who would not but feel elated, so fairly to be mated.  ISOLDA (_gazing vacantly before her_). Glorious knight! And I must near him loveless ever languish! How can I support such anguish?  BRANGÆNA. What's this, my lady? loveless thou?  (_Approaching coaxingly and kissing_ ISOLDA.)  Where lives there a man would not love thee? Who could see Isolda And not sink at once into bondage blest? And if e'en it could be any were cold, did any magic draw him from thee, I'd bring the false one back to bondage, And bind him in links of love.--  (_Secretly and confidentially, close to_ ISOLDA.)  Mindest thou not thy mother's arts? Think you that she who'd mastered those would have sent me o'er the sea, without assistance for thee?  ISOLDA (_darkly_). My mother's rede I mind aright, and highly her magic arts I hold:-- Vengeance they wreak for wrongs, rest give to wounded spirits.-- Yon casket hither bear.  BRANGÆNA. It holds a balm for thee.--  (_She brings forward a small golden coffer, opens it, and points to its contents_.)  Thy mother placed inside it her subtle magic potions. There's salve for sickness or for wounds, and antidotes for deadly drugs.--  (_She takes a bottle_.)  The helpfullest draught I hold in here.  ISOLDA. Not so, I know a better. I make a mark to know it again-- This draught 'tis I would drain.  (_Seizes flask and shows it_.)  BRANGÆNA (_recoiling in horror_). The draught of death!  (ISOLDA _has risen from the sofa and now hears with increasing dread the cries of the sailors_.)  VOICES OF THE CREW (_without_). \"Ho! heave ho! hey! Reduce the sail! The mainsail in! Ho! heave ho! hey!\"  ISOLDA. Our journey has been swift. Woe is me! Near to the land!   SCENE IV.  (KURVENAL _boisterously enters through the curtains_.)  KURVENAL. Up, up, ye ladies! Look alert! Straight bestir you! Loiter not,--here is the land!-- To dame Isolda says the servant of Tristan, our hero true:-- Behold our flag is flying! it waveth landwards aloft: in Mark's ancestral castle may our approach be seen. So, dame Isolda, he prays to hasten, for land straight to prepare her, that thither he may bear her.  ISOLDA (_who has at first cowered and shuddered on hearing the message, now speaks calmly and with dignity_). My greeting take unto your lord and tell him what I say now: Should he assist to land me and to King Mark would he hand me, unmeet and unseemly were his act, the while my pardon was not won for trespass black and base: So bid him seek my grace.  (KURVENAL _makes a gesture of defiance_.)  Now mark me well, This message take:-- Nought will I yet prepare me, that he to land may bear me; I will not by him be landed, nor unto King Mark be handed ere granting forgiveness and forgetfulness, which 'tis seemly he should seek:-- for all his trespass base I tender him my grace.  KURVENAL. Be assured, I'll bear your words: we'll see what he will say!  (_He retires quickly_.)   SCENE V.  ISOLDA (_hurries to_ BRANGÆNA _and embraces her vehemently_). Now farewell, Brangæna! Greet ev'ry one, Greet my father and mother!  BRANGÆNA. What now? what mean'st thou? Wouldst thou flee? And where must I then follow?  ISOLDA (_checking herself suddenly_). Here I remain: heard you not? Tristan will I await.-- I trust in thee to aid in this: prepare the true cup of peace: thou mindest how it is made.  BRANGÆNA. What meanest thou?  ISOLDA (_taking a bottle from the coffer_). This it is! From the flask go pour this philtre out; yon golden goblet 'twill fill.  BRANGÆNA (_filled with terror receiving the flask_). Trust I my wits?  ISOLDA. Wilt thou be true?  BRANGÆNA. The draught--for whom?  ISOLDA. Him who betrayed!  BRANGÆNA. Tristan?  ISOLDA. Truce he'll drink with me.  BRANGÆNA (_throwing herself at_ ISOLDA'S _feet_). O horror! Pity thy handmaid!  ISOLDA. Pity thou me, false-hearted maid! Mindest thou not my mother's arts? Think you that she who'd mastered those would have sent thee o'er the sea without assistance for me? A salve for sickness doth she offer and antidotes for deadly drugs: for deepest grief and woe supreme gave she the draught of death. Let Death now give her thanks!  BRANGÆNA (_scarcely able to control herself_). O deepest grief!  ISOLDA. Now, wilt thou obey?  BRANGÆNA. O woe supreme!  ISOLDA. Wilt thou be true?  BRANGÆNA. The draught?  KURVENAL (_entering_). Sir Tristan!  (BRANGÆNA _rises, terrified and confused_. ISOLDA _strives with immense effort to control herself_.)  ISOLDA (_to Kurvenal_). Sir Tristan may approach!   SCENE VI.  [KURVENAL _retires again_. BRANGÆNA, _almost beside herself, turns up the stage_. ISOLDA, _mustering all her powers of resolution, walks slowly and with dignity towards the sofa, by the head of which she supports herself, turning her eyes firmly towards the entrance_]  (TRISTAN _enters, and pauses respectfully at the entrance_.)  TRISTAN. Demand, lady, what you will.  ISOLDA. While knowing not what my demand is, wert thou afraid still to fulfil it, fleeing my presence thus?  TRISTAN. Honor Held me in awe.  ISOLDA. Scant honor hast thou shown unto me; for, unabashed, withheldest thou obedience unto my call.  TRISTAN. Obedience 'twas forbade me to come.  ISOLDA. But little I owe thy lord, methinks, if he allows ill manners unto his own promised bride.  TRISTAN. In our land it is the law that he who fetches home the bride should stay afar from her.  ISOLDA. On what account?  TRISTAN. 'Tis the custom.  ISOLDA. Being so careful, my lord Tristan, another custom can you not learn? Of enemies friends make: for evil acts amends make.  TRISTAN. Who is my foe?  ISOLDA. Find in thy fears! Blood-guilt gets between us.  TRISTAN. That was absolved.  ISOLDA. Not between us.  TRISTAN. In open field, 'fore all the folk our old feud was abandoned.  ISOLDA. 'Twas not there I held Tantris hid when Tristan was laid low, He stood there brawny, bright and brave; but in his truce I took no part: my tongue its silence had learnt. When in chambered stillness sick he lay with the sword I stood before him, stern; silent--my lips, motionless--my hand. But that which my hand and lips had once vowed, I swore in stealth to adhere to: lo! now my desire I'm near to.  TRISTAN. What hast thou sworn?  ISOLDA (_quickly_). Vengeance for Morold!  TRISTAN (_quietly_). Mindst thou that?  ISOLDA (_animated_). Dare you to flout me?-- Was he not my betrothed, that noble Irish knight? For his sword a blessing I sought; for me only he fought. When he was murdered no honor fell. In that heartfelt misery my vow was framed; if no man remained to right it, I, a maid, must needs requite it.-- Weak and maimed, when might was mine, why at thy death did I pause? Thou shalt know the secret cause.-- Thy hurts I tended that, when sickness ended, thou shouldst fall by some man, as Isolda's revenge should plan. But now attempt thy fate to foretell me? if their friendship all men do sell thee, what foe can seek to fell thee?  TRISTAN (_pale and gloomy, offers her his sword_). If thou so lovedst this lord, then lift once more my sword, nor from thy purpose refrain; let the weapon not fail again.  ISOLDA. Put up thy sword which once I swung, when vengeful rancor my"]]]
