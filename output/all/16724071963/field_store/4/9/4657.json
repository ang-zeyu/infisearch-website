It came in directly, and in half a minute more they were being whirled away in the direction of Oak Run.  \"There is no use of talking, those girls are just all right,\" said Sam, bluntly. \"I never met a nicer lot in my life.\"  \"I guess Dick thinks one of them is all right,\" said Tom, with a grin. \"Although I don't see why you were steering her into the smoking room,\" he added, to his big brother. \"Were you going to teach her to smoke cigarettes?\"  \"Oh, say, Tom, let up,\" grumbled Dick. \"You paid about as much attention to Nellie as I did to Dora.\"  \"Anyway, I didn't steer her to the smoking room.\"  \"No, but while you were talking to her I saw you put five spoonfuls of sugar in her coffee for her,\" returned Dick. \"Maybe you didn't think she was sweet enough for you, eh?\"  At this Tom reddened, while Sam set up a roar.  \"He's got you, Tom!\" cried the youngest Rover. \"Better cry quits and talk about something else. We all like those girls amazingly, and that's the end of it;\" and then the subject was changed.  It was almost dark when Oak Run was reached. Here a carriage, driven by Jack Ness, the Rovers' hired man, was in waiting for them.  \"Hullo, Jack!\" cried Tom. \"All well at home?\"  \"Very well, Master Tom,\" was the answer. \"And how are you, and how is Master Dick and Master Sam?\"  \"All O. K. and top side up, Jack,\" said Sam.  They were soon in the carriage, and then the hired man whipped up the team and away they sped across Swift River, through the village of Dexter's Corners, and then along the highway leading to the farm.  \"I see the lights of home!\" sang out Sam, as they made the last turn. \"I can tell you, it makes a fellow feel good, doesn't it?\"  \"It's a true saying that there is no place like home,\" returned Dick. \"Here we are!\"  The carriage made a turn around a clump of trees and then dashed up to the piazza. From the house rushed several people.  \"Here we are, father!\" sang out Dick. \"How are you, Uncle Randolph, and how are you, Aunt Martha?\"  \"Dick!\" cried Mr. Anderson Rover, and embraced his oldest son. \"And Tom and Sam! I am glad to see you looking so well!\"  \"My boys!\" murmured their aunt, as of old, and gave each a sounding kiss.  \"Getting to be big young men,\" was their uncle's comment. \"They won't be boys much longer.\"  \"I'm going to stay a boy all my life, Uncle Randolph,\" answered Tom, promptly. \"By the way,\" he went on, with a merry twinkle in his eye, \"how is scientific farming getting on?\"  \"Splendidly, Thomas, splendidly.\"  \"Not losing money any more, then?\"  \"Well--er--I have lost a little, just a little, this summer. But next summer I expect grand results.\"  \"Going to grow a new kind of turnip?\"  \"No I--\"  \"Or maybe it's a squash this time, uncle.\"  \"No, I am trying--\"  \"Or a parsnip. I have heard there is a great call for parsnips in New Zealand. The natives use them for dyeing--\"  \"Thomas!\" interrupted his father, sternly. \"Please don't start to joke so early. To-morrow will do.\"  \"All right, I'll subside,\" answered Tom. \"But really, do you know, I'm bubbling all over, like an uncorked soda-water bottle.\"  \"Don't you feel hungry?\"  \"Hungry! Just you try me and see.\"  \"I made a big cherry pie for you, Tom,\" said his aunt. \"I know you like it.\"  \"Oh, Aunt Martha, that's worth an extra hug.\" He gave it to her. \"Your pie can't be beat!\"  \"And I've got some fried chicken. Dick likes that.\"  \"And I like it, too,\" said Sam.  \"Yes, I know it, Sam. But I made some spice cakes too--\"  \"Oh, aunt, just my weakness!\" cried the youngest Rover. \"There's another kiss for you, and another! You're the best aunt a boy ever had!\"  They were soon washed up and sitting down to the table. Scarcely had they seated themselves than Alexander Pop came in, acting as waiter, something he always did when the boys came home. Alexander, usually called Aleck for short, was a good-natured colored man who had once been employed at Putnam Hall. He had gone to Africa with the Rover boys, as already related in \"The Rover Boys in the Jungle,\" and had been with them on numerous other trips. He was now employed steadily in the Rover household.  \"Howde do, gen'men?\" he said, with a broad grin on his coal-black face.  \"Aleck!\" all three cried together; \"how are you?\"  \"Fust-rate, thank yo'. Yo' am looking right smart, too,\" went on the colored man. And then he began to serve them with the best the place afforded. He loved dearly to talk, but thought the present no time for so doing.  It was a happy family gathering, and all remained at the table a long time, the boys telling their different tales from beginning to end. Mr. Anderson Rover was much interested in what they had to say about the Baxters and Lew Flapp.  \"You must be careful,\" said he. \"Arnold Baxter can do you no more harm, but the others will be worse than snakes in the grass.\"  \"We'll watch out,\" answered Dick, and then he and the others asked about the houseboat which had been taken for debt and how soon they could use the craft.  \"You may use the houseboat as soon as you please,\" said Randolph Rover. \"But you must promise your father and Aunt Martha and me not to get into mischief.\"  \"How could we get into mischief with a houseboat?\" questioned Tom. \"Why, we just intend to knock around and take it easy all summer.\"  \"The rest ought to do all of you a power of good,\" came from his father. \"I declare, it seems to me you have been on the jump ever since you first went to Putnam Hall.\"  \"Where is the houseboat now?\"  \"Tied up at the village of Steelville, not very far from Pittsburg. As I wrote to you, she is under the command of Captain Starr. He knows the Ohio and the Mississippi thoroughly and will take you wherever you wish to go.\"  \"Well, we want to stay home a few days first, and make all of our arrangements,\" said Dick; and so it was decided.     CHAPTER X  A SCENE IN A CEMETERY   \"Hurrah, Fred Garrison says he will go with us!\" cried Sam, two days later. \"I have just received a telegram from him. He says he will come on to-morrow.\"  \"And here is word from Songbird Powell,\" put in Dick. \"He will go, too. He is to meet us at Pittsburg, any time I say.\"  \"And Hans Mueller will go,\" said Tom. \"That makes three of our friends to start with. I hope the Lanings and the Stanhopes go.\"  \"So do I,\" answered Dick, who could not get that talk with Dora in the hallway of the hotel out of his head.  Sam was anxious to meet Fred Garrison, and on the following afternoon drove down to the railroad station at Oak Run to greet his chum.  The train was late, and after finding this out Sam took a walk around the village to see what changes had been made during the past few months. But Oak Run was a slow place and he look in vain for improvements.  \"Guess I'll have my hair cut while I am here,\" he said to himself, and started to enter the only barber shop of which the railroad village boasted.  As he pushed open the door a young fellow got out of one of the chairs and paid the barber what was coming to him. Then he reached for his hat and started to leave.  \"Lew Flapp!\" ejaculated Sam. \"Is it possible?\"  The bully of Putnam Hall whirled around and gave a start. He had not dreamed of meeting one of the Rovers.  \"What--er--what do you want?\" he stammered, not knowing what to say.  \"Where did you come from, Flapp?\"  \"That's my business.\"  \"It was a fine trick you played on us while we were on the march back to Putnam Hall.\"  \"Trick? I haven't played any trick on you,\" answered Lew Flapp, loftily, as he began to regain his self-possession.  \"You know well enough that you robbed that jewelry shop and then tried to lay the blame on me and my brothers.\"  \"Rover, you are talking in riddles.\"  \"No, I'm not; I'm telling the strict truth.\"  \"Bah!\" Lew Flapp shoved forward. \"Let me pass.\"  \"Not just yet.\" Sam placed himself in front of the barber shop door.  \"What's the row?\" put in the barber, who happened to be the only other person in the shop.  \"This fellow is a thief, Mr. Gregg.\"  \"You don't say!\" cried Lemuel Gregg. \"Who did he rob?\"  \"He robbed a jewelry shop up near Putnam Hall and then he laid the blame on my brothers and me.\"  \"That was a mean thing to do.\"  \"It is false!\" roared Lew Flapp. \"Get out of my way, or it will be the worse for you!\"  \"I'm not afraid of you, Flapp,\" responded Sam, sturdily. \"Mr. Gregg, will you help me to make him a prisoner?\"  \"Are you certain of what you are doing?\" questioned the barber, nervously. \"I don't want to get into trouble over this. I once cut off a man's beard by mistake and had to pay twenty-two dollars damages.\"  \"I know exactly what I am doing. Help me to make him a prisoner and you shall be well rewarded.\"  At the promise of a reward Lemuel Gregg became interested. He knew that the Rovers were well-to-do and could readily pay him handsomely for his services.  \"You--you had better stay here, young man,\" he said, to Lew Flapp. \"If you are innocent it won't hurt you. We'll have the squire look into this case.\"  \"I won't stay!\" roared the bully, and making a sudden leap at Sam he hurled the youngest Rover to one side and tried to bolt through the door.  \"No, you don't!\" came from the barber, and leaping to the front he caught Lew Flapp by the end of the coat and held him.  \"Let go!\"  \"I won't!\"  \"Then take that!\" And the next instant Lew Flapp hit the barber a telling blow in the nose which made the blood spurt from that member. Then Flapp dove for the door, pulled it open, and sped up the street with all speed.  \"Oh, my nose! He has smashed it to jelly!\" groaned the barber, as he rushed to the sink for some water.  Sam had been thrown against a barber chair so forcibly that for the moment the wind was knocked completely out of him. By the time he was able to stand up, Flapp was out of the building.  \"We must catch him!\" he cried. \"Come on!\"  \"Catch him yourself,\" growled Lemuel Gregg, \"I ain't going to stand the risk of being killed. He's a reg'lar tiger, he is!\" And he began to bathe his nose at the sink.

HOFFMANN COUNSELOR LINDORF COPPELIUS DAPERTUTTO DOCTOR MIRACLE SPALANZANI CRESPEL ANDRES COCHENILLE FRANTZ LUTHER NATHANAEL HERMANN STELLA GIULIETTA OLYMPIA ANTONIA NICKLAUSSE THE MUSE A GHOST     ARGUMENT   ACT I.  In the first act, which is really a prologue, Hoffmann, a young poet, enters the tavern of Luther to meet his companions, and drinks to drown his sorrows. They think he is in love, but he answers, all that is past, and tells the story of his three loves.   ACT II. OLYMPIA.  A physician's drawing room. Spalanzani has invited a large company to witness the accomplishments of his daughter, Olympia. She sings to general applause, and Hoffmann falls desperately in love with her. As the guests go to supper, Hoffmann tells her of his passion and thinks he finds a responsive echo in her. There is dancing, and she waltzes him off his feet. A Dr. Coppelius comes in to say he has been swindled by Spalanzani. He slips into Olympia's room, from which a noise of breaking is heard. Coppelius, out of revenge, has smashed Olympia. She was only an automaton. Hoffmann is astonished.   ACT III. GIULIETTA.  At Venice, in the house of Giulietta, beloved of Schlemil, who takes the arrival of Hoffmann very ungraciously. Hoffmann cares nothing for Giulietta, but she is bribed by Dapertutto to make Hoffmann love her, and she succeeds by making him believe, that he is her ideal. But as a proof of his love she wants Hoffmann to get the key of her room away from Schlemil. Hoffmann demands the key; Schlemil tells him to come and take it, and they fight. Schlemil is killed. Hoffmann takes the key and rushes to Giulietta's room, and finding nobody, comes back, only to see her riding off in her gondola, laughing at him, and with her arms around another man's neck. Hoffmann is disgusted.   ACT IV. ANTONIA.  Antonia has been told by her father, Crespel, to sing no more. When Hoffmann, who has long loved her, comes, he wonders why, but he soon learns by overhearing a conversation between Crespel and an evil person called Doctor Miracle that Antonia is afflicted with consumption. He then begs her also not to sing, and she promises him. When Hoffmann goes, Miracle comes in and tells her it is all nonsense, to sing as much as she likes; but she will not break her promise to Hoffmann. Miracle then causes the ghost of Antonia's mother to appear, and to her prayers the girl yields. Miracle urges her on and on, until she is utterly exhausted. She falls dying, and her father receives her last breath. Hoffmann is heartbroken.   EPILOGUE.  A return to the scene of the first act. Hoffmann has told his stories. His companions leave him. The Muse appears and tells him that she is the only mistress to follow, the only one who will remain true to him. His spirit flickers a moment with gratitude. Then his head sinks on the table, and he sleeps.     The Tales of Hoffmann     ACT I.   (The Tavern of Martin Luther. The interior of a German inn. Tables and   benches.)   CHORUS of Students.

Let's watch him.   HOFFMANN (entering with sombre voice).    Good day, friends.   NICKLAUSSE.    Good-day.   HOFFMANN.  A chair, a glass, A pipe...   NICKLAUSSE (mocking).  Pardon, my lord, without displeasing, I drink, smoke and sit like you... place for two.   CHORUS.    He's right... place for both of them.

NICKLAUSSE (quietly).    Yes, master.   HERMANN (to Hoffmann).    Oh, oh, whence comes this ill temper?   NATHANAEL (to Hoffmann).    It's as if one did not know you.   HERMANN.    On what thorn have you trod?   HOFFMANN.  Alas, on a dead herb With the iced breath of the north.   NICKLAUSSE.  And there by this door, On a drunkard who sleeps.   HOFFMANN.  'Tis true... that rascal, by Jove, I envy him. A drink. Like him, let's sleep in the gutter.   HERMANN.    Without pillow.   HOFFMANN.    The flags.   NATHANAEL.    Without curtains.   HOFFMANN.    The sky.   NATHANAEL.    The rain.   HERMANN.    Have you a nightmare, Hoffmann?   HOFFMANN.  No, but to-night, A while since, at the play...   ALL.    Well?   HOFFMANN.    I thought to see again... The deuce... why reopen old wounds? Life is short. Enjoy it while we can. We must drink, sing, laugh, as we may, Left to weep to-morrow!   NATHANAEL.  Then sing the first without asking, We'll do chorus.   HOFFMANN.    Agreed!   NATHANAEL.    Something gay.   HERMANN.    The song of the Rat!   NATHANAEL.  No, for me, I'm tired of it. What we want is the legend Of Klein-Zach...   ALL.  'Tis the legand of Klein-Zach.   HOFFMANN.  Here goes for Klein-Zach!... Once at the court of Eysenach A little dwarf called Klein-Zach, Was covered o'er with a colbac, And his legs they went clic, clac!     Clic, clac. There's Klein-Zach.   CHORUS.    Crick, crack,   There's Klein-Zach.   HOFFMANN.  He had a hump in place of stomach, His webbed feet seemed to burst a sack, His nose was with tobacco black. And his head it went crick crack,     Crick, crack. There's Klein-Zach.   CHORUS.      Crick, crack, There's Klein-Zach.   HOFFMANN.  As for the features on his face.  (He becomes absorbed.)   CHORUS.    As for the features on his face.   HOFFMANN (very slowly).    As for the features...  (He rises.)  Oh, her face was charming... I see it, Fine as the day, running after her, I, like a fool, left the house paternal, And fled there'on to woods and vales Her hair, in sombre rolls, On her neck threw warm shades, Her eyes of enveloping azure, Cast about glances fresh and pure. And as our car without shock or tremor Carried our loves and hearts, her vibrant voice and sweet, To the heav'ns that listened, threw the conq'ring cry, And the eternal echo resounded in my heart.   NATHANAEL.  Oh strangest brain! Who are you painting! Klein-Zach?   HOFFMANN.    I speak of her...   NATHANAEL.    Who?   HOFFMANN.  Nobody... nothing, my spirit is dullish. Nothing. Klein-Zach is better, malformed as he is!   CHORUS.    Flick, flack,   There's Klein-Zach.   HOFFMANN (throwing away his glass).  Peuh!... this beer is detestable, Let's light up the punch and drink; And may the light-headed Roll under the table.   CHORUS.  And may the light headed Roll under the table.   CHORUS.  (The lights go out, Luther fires an immense punch bowl.)  Luther is a brave man,     Tire la laire,     Tire lan la. 'Tis to-morrow that we poison him,     Tire lan laire,     Tire lan la. His cellar is a goodly spot,     Tire lan laire. 'Tis to-morrow we will make it hot,     Tire lan laire,     Tire lan la.   NICKLAUSSE.  Very good, indeed. At least we are pruned With reason and practical sense! Away with languorous hearts.   NATHANAEL.  Let's wager that Hoffmann's in love.   HOFFMANN.    What then?   NATHANAEL.  You need not blush, I imagine Our friend Wilhelm who's there, Burns for Leonor and finds her divine. Hermann loves Gretchen and I am near ruined For the Fausta.   HOFFMANN (to Wilhelm).    Yes, Leonor, thy virtuose.  (To Hermann.)  Yes, Gretchen, thy doll inert, of icy heart.  (to Nathanael.)  And thy Fausta, poor insensate, The courtezan with front of brass.   NATHANAEL.    Morose spirit, Many thanks for Fausta, Gretchen and Leonore!...   HOFFMANN.    Pish. They are all alike.   NATHANAEL.  Then your mistress is such a treasure That you despise so much our own?   HOFFMANN.  My mistress, no, no, say rather three Charming trio of enchantresses. Who are dividing my days. Would you like the story of my crazy loves?...   CHORUS.    Yes, yes!   NICKLAUSSE.    What are you saying of three mistresses?   HOFFMANN.    Smoke!... Before this dead pipe is relighted You will have comprehended, You who in this play where my heart was consumed In good sense took the first prize!  "]]]
