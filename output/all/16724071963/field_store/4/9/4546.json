Although the German Foreign Office had a big press department its efforts were devoted more to furnishing the outside world with German views than with collecting outside opinions for the information of the German Government.  Believing that this information would be of immeasurable benefit to the German diplomats in sounding the depths of public sentiment in America, Gerard delivered the book to von Jagow personally.  In the meantime numerous conferences were held at Great Headquarters. Financiers, business men and diplomats who wanted to keep peace with America sided with the Foreign Office.  Every anti-American influence in the Central Powers joined forces with the Navy.  The _Lusitania_ note was printed and the public discussion which resulted was greater than that which followed the first declarations of war in August, 1914. The people, who before had accepted everything their Government said, began to think for themselves.  One heard almost as much criticism as praise of the _Lusitania_ incident.  For the first time the quarrel, which had been nourished between the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, became nation-wide and forces throughout Germany lined up with one side or the other.  But the Navy Department was the cleverer of the two. The press bureau sent out inspired stories that the submarines were causing England a loss of a million dollars a week.  They said that every week the Admiralty was launching two U-boats.  It was stated that reliable reports to Admiral von Tirpitz proved the high toll taken by the submarines in two weeks had struck terror to the hearts of English ship-owners.  The newspapers printed under great headlines: \"Toll of Our Tireless U-Boats,\" the names and tonnage of ships lost.  The press bureau pointed to the rise in food prices in Great Britain and France. The public was made to feel a personal pride in submarine exploits. And at the same time the Navy editorial writers brought up the old issue of American arms and ammunition to further embitter the people.  Thus the first note which President Wilson wrote in the _Lusitania_ case not only brought the quarrel between the Navy and Foreign Office to a climax but it gave the German people the first opportunity they had had seriously to discuss questions of policy and right.  In the Rhine Valley, where the ammunition interests dominated every phase of life, the Navy found its staunchest supporters.  In educational circles, in shipping centres, such as Hamburg and Bremen, in the financial districts of Frankfort and Berlin, the Foreign Office received its support.  Press and Reichstag were divided.  Supporting the Foreign Office were the _Lokal Anzeiger_, the _Berliner Tageblatt_, the _Cologne Gazette_, the _Frankforter Zeitung_, the _Hamburger Fremdemblatt_, and the _Vorw채rts_.  The Navy had the support of Count Reventlow, Naval Critic of the _Deutsche Tageszeitung_, the _T채glische Rundscha_, the _Vossische Zeitung_, the _Morgen Post_, the _B. Z. Am Mittag_, the _M체nchener Neueste Nachrichten_, the _Rheinische Westf채lische Zeitung_, and the leading Catholic organ, the _Koelnische Volks-Zeitung_.  Government officials were also divided.  Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg led the party which demanded an agreement with the United States.  He was supported by von Jagow, Zimmermann, Dr. Karl Helfferich, Secretary of the Treasury; Dr. Solf, the Colonial Minister; Dr. Siegfried Heckscher, Vice Chairman of the Reichstag Committee on Foreign Relations; and Philip Scheidemann, leader of the majority of the Socialists in the Reichstag.  The opposition was led by Grand Admiral von Tirpitz.  He was supported by General von Falkenhayn, Field Marshal von Mackensen and all army generals; Admirals von Pohl and von Bachmann; Major Bassermann, leader of the National Liberal Party in the Reichstag; Dr. Gustav Stressemann, member of the Reichstag and Director of the North German Lloyd Steamship Company; and von Heydebrand, the so-called \"Uncrowned King of Prussia,\" because of his control of the Prussian Diet.  With these forces against each other the internal fight continued more bitter than ever.  President Wilson kept insisting upon definite promises from Germany but the Admiralty still had the upper hand. There was nothing for the Foreign Office to do except to make the best possible excuses and depend upon Wilson's patience to give them time to get into the saddle.  The Navy Department, however, was so confident that it had the Kaiser's support in everything it did, that one of the submarines was instructed to sink the _Arabic_.  President Wilson's note in the _Arabic_ case again brought the submarine dispute within Germany to a head.  Conferences were again held at Great Headquarters.  The Chancellor, von Jagow, Helfferich, von Tirpitz and other leaders were summoned by the Kaiser.  On the 28th of August I succeeded in sending by courier to The Hague the following despatch:   \"With the support of the Kaiser, the German Chancellor, Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, is expected to win the fight he is now making for a modification of Germany's submarine warfare that will forever settle the difficulties with America over the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the _Arabic_.  Both the Chancellor and von Jagow are most anxious to end at once and for all time the controversies with Washington desiring America's friendship.\"  (Published in the Chicago _Tribune_, August 29th, 1915.)   \"The Marine Department, headed by von Tirpitz, creator of the submarine policy, will oppose any disavowal of the action of German's submarines. But the Kaiser is expected to approve the steps the Chancellor and Foreign Secretary contemplate taking, swinging the balance in favour of von Bethmann-Hollweg's contention that ships in the future must be warned before they are torpedoed.\"   One day I went to the Foreign Office and told one of the officials I believed that if the American people knew what a difficult time the Foreign Office was having in trying to win out over the Admiralty that public opinion in the United States might be mobilised to help the Foreign Office against the Admiralty.  I took with me a brief despatch which I asked him to pass.  He censored it with the understanding that I would never disclose his name in case the despatch was read in Germany.  A few days later the Manchester, England, _Guardian_ arrived containing my article, headed as follows:     HOLLWEG'S CHANGE OF TUNE    Respect for Scraps of Paper    LAW AT SEA    Insists on Warning by Submarines    TIRPITZ PARTY BEATEN    Kaiser Expected to Approve New Policy    \"New York, Sunday.  \"Cables from Mr. Carl W. Ackerman, Berlin correspondent of the United Press published here, indicate that the real crisis following the _Arabic_ is in Germany, not America.  He writes:  \"The Berlin Foreign Office is unalterably opposed to submarine activity, such as evidenced by the _Arabic_ affair, and it was on the initiative of this Government department that immediate steps were taken with Mr. Gerard the American Ambassador.  The nature of these negotiations is still unknown to the German public.  \"It is stated on the highest authority that Herr von Jagow, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg are unanimous in their anxiety to settle American difficulties once and for all, retaining the friendship of the United States in any event.  \"The Kaiser is expected to approve the course suggested by the Imperial Chancellor, despite open opposition to any disavowal of submarine activities which constantly emanates from the German Admiralty.  \"The Chancellor is extremely desirous of placing Germany on record as an observer of international law as regards sea warfare, and in this case will win his demand that submarines in the future shall thoroughly warn enemy ships before firing their torpedoes or shells.  \"There is considerable discussion in official circles as to whether the Chancellor's steps create a precedent, but it is agreed that it will probably close all complications with America, including the _Lusitania_ case, which remained unsettled following President Wilson's last note to Germany.  \"Thus if the United States approves the present attitude of the Chancellor this step will aid in clearing the entire situation and will materially strengthen the policy of von Bethmann-Hollweg and von Jagow, which is a deep desire for peace with America.\"   After this despatch was printed I was called to the home of Fran von Schroeder, the American-born wife of one of the Intelligence Office of the General Staff.  Captain Vanselow, Chief of the Admiralty Intelligence Department, was there and had brought with him the Manchester _Guardian_.  He asked me where I got the information and who had passed the despatch.  He said the Navy was up in arms and had issued orders to the General Telegraph Office that, inasmuch as Germany was under martial law, no telegrams were to be passed containing the words submarines, navy, admiralty or marine or any officers of the Navy without having them referred to the Admiralty for a second censoring. This order practically nullified the censorship powers of the Foreign Office.  I saw that the Navy Department was again in the saddle and that the efforts of the Chancellor to maintain peace might not be successful after all.  But the conferences at Great Headquarters lasted longer than any one expected.  The first news we received of what had taken place was that Secretary von Jagow had informed the Kaiser he would resign before he would do anything which might cause trouble with the United States.  Germany was split wide open by the submarine issue.  For a while it looked as if the only possible adjustment would be either for von Tirpitz to go and his policies with him, or for von Jagow and the Chancellor to go with the corresponding danger of a rupture with America.  But von Tirpitz would not resign.  He left Great Headquarters for Berlin and intimated to his friends that he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],["title","Germany, The Next Republic? (#8)"],["body","going to run the Navy to suit himself.  But the Chancellor who had the support of the big shipping interests and the financiers, saw a possible means of checkmating von Tirpitz by forcing Admiral von Pohl to resign as Chief of the Admiralty Staff.  They finally persuaded the Kaiser to accept his resignation and appoint Admiral von Holtzendorff as his successor. Von Holtzendorff's brother was a director of the Hamburg-American Line and an intimate friend of A. Ballin, the General Director of the company.  The Chancellor believed that by having a friend of his as Chief of the Admiralty Staff, no orders would be issued to submarine commanders contrary to the wishes of the Chancellor, because according to the rules of the German Navy Department the Chief of the Admiralty Staff must approve all naval plans and sign all orders to fleet commanders.  Throughout this time the one thing which frightened the Foreign Office was the fear that President Wilson might break off diplomatic relations before the Foreign Office had an opportunity to settle the differences with the United States.  For this reason Ambassador Gerard was kept advised by Wilhelmstrasse of the internal developments in Germany and asked to report them fully but confidentially to Wilson.  So, during this crisis when Americans were demanding a break with Germany because of Germany's continued defiance of President Wilson's notes, the American Government knew that if the Foreign Office was given more time it had a good chance of succeeding in cleaning house.  A rupture at that time would have destroyed all the efforts of the Foreign Office to keep the German military machine within bounds.  It would have over-thrown von Jagow and von Bethmann-Hollweg and put in von Tirpitz as Chancellor and von Heydebrand, the reactionary leader of the Prussian Diet, as Secretary of State.  At that time, all the democratic forces of Germany were lined up with the Foreign Office.  The people who blushed for Belgium, the financiers who were losing money, the shipping interests whose tonnage was locked in belligerent or neutral harbours, the Socialists and people who were anxious and praying for peace, were looking to the Foreign Office and to Washington to avoid a break.     CHAPTER IV  THE HATE CAMPAIGN AGAINST AMERICA  While Germany was professing her friendship for the United States in every note written following the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the government was secretly preparing the nation for a break in diplomatic relations, or for war, in the event of a rupture.  German officials realised that unless the people were made to suspect Mr. Wilson and his motives, unless they were made to resent the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Allies, there would be a division in public opinion and the government would not be able to count upon the united support of the people.  Because the government does the thinking for the people it has to tell them what to think before they have reached the point of debating an issue themselves.  A war with America or a break in diplomatic relations in 1915 would not have been an easy matter to explain, if the people had not been encouraged to hate Wilson.  So while Germany maintained a propaganda bureau in America to interpret Germany and to maintain good relations, she started in Germany an extensive propaganda against Wilson, the American press, the United States Ambassador and Americans in general.  This step was not necessary in the army because among army officers the bitterness and hatred of the United States were deeper and more extensive than the hatred of any other belligerent.  It was hardly ever possible for the American correspondents to go to the front without being insulted.  Even the American military attaches, when they went to the front, had to submit to the insults of army officers.  After the sinking of the _Arabic_ the six military observers attached to the American Embassy were invited by the General Staff to go to Russia to study the military operations of Field Marshal von Mackensen.  They were escorted by Baron von Maltzahn, former attache of the German Embassy in Paris.  At Lodz, one of the largest cities in Poland, they were taken to headquarters.  Von Maltzahn, who knew Mackensen personally, called at the Field Marshal's offices, reported that he had escorted six American army officers under orders of the General Staff, whom he desired to present to the Commander-in-Chief.  Von Mackensen replied that he did not care to meet the Americans and told von Maltzahn that the best thing he could do would be to escort the observers back to Berlin.  As soon as the military attaches reached Berlin and reported this to Washington they were recalled.       *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *    BLOOD-TRAFFICKERS    Cowards, who kill three thousand miles away,   See the long lines of shrouded forms increase!   Yours is this work, disguise it as you may;   But for your greed the world were now at peace.    Month after month your countless chimneys roar,--   Slaughter your object, and your motive gain;   Look at your money,--it is wet with gore   Nothing can cleanse it from the loathsome stain.    You, who prolong this hideous hell on earth,   Making a by-word of your native land,   Stripped of your wealth, how paltry is your worth!   See how men shrink from contact with your hand!    There is pollution in your blood-smeared gold,   There is corruption in your pact with Death,   There is dishonor in the lie, oft-told,   Of your \"Humanity\"!  'Tis empty breath.    What shall it profit you to heap on high,   Makers of orphans! a few millions more,   When you must face them--those you caused to die,   And God demands of you to pay your score?    He is not mocked; His vengeance doth not sleep;   His cup of wrath He lets you slowly fill;   What you have sown, that also shall you reap;   God's law is adamant,--\"Thou shalt not kill\"!    Think not to plead:--\"I did not act alone,\"   \"Custom allows it,\" and \"My dead were few\";   Each hath his quota; yonder are your own!   See how their fleshless fingers point at you, at you!    You, to whose vaults this wholesale murder yields   Mere needless increments of ghoulish gain,   Count up your corpses on these blood-soaked fields!   Hear . . . till your death . . . your victims' moans of pain!    Then, when at night you, sleepless, fear to pray,   Watch the thick, crimson stream draw near your bed,   And shriek with horror, till the dawn of day   Shall find you raving at your heaps of dead!    JOHN L. STODDARD.     The League of Truth   Head Offices for Germany:   Berlin W   40 Potsdamer Str.    July 4th, 1916.      Printed by Barthe & Co., Berlin W.       *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *  But this was not the only time von Mackensen, or other army officers, showed their contempt for the United States.  After the fall of Warsaw a group of American correspondents were asked to go to the headquarters of General von Besseler, afterward named Governor General of Poland. The general received them in the gardens of the Polish castle which he had seized as his headquarters; shook hands with the Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Swiss and South American newspaper men, and then, before turning on his heels to go back to his Polish palace, turned to the Americans and said:  \"As for you gentlemen, the best thing you can do is to tell your country to stop shipping arms and ammunition.\"  During General Brusiloff's offensive I was invited together with other correspondents to go to the Wohlynian battlefields to see how the Germans had reorganised the Austrian front.  In a little town near the Stochod River we were invited to dinner by Colonel von Luck.  I sat opposite the colonel, who was in charge of the reorganisation here. Throughout the meal he made so many insulting remarks that the officer who was our escort had to change the trend of the conversation.  Before he did so the colonel said:  \"Tell me, do they insult you in Berlin like this?\"  I replied that I seldom encountered such antagonism in Berlin; that it was chiefly the army which was anti-American.  \"Well, that's the difference between the diplomats and the army.  If the army was running the government we would probably have had war with America a long time ago,\" he concluded, smiling sarcastically.  Shortly after the sinking of the _Lusitania_ the naval propaganda bureau had bronze medals cast and placed on sale at souvenir shops throughout Germany.  Ambassador Gerard received one day, in exchanging some money, a fifty mark bill, with the words stamped in purple ink across the face:  \"God punish England and America.\"  For some weeks this rubber stamp was used very effectively.  The Navy Department realised, too, that another way to attack America and especially Americans in Berlin, was to arouse the suspicion that every one who spoke English was an enemy.  The result was that most Americans had to be exceedingly careful not to talk aloud in public places.  The American correspondents were even warned at the General Staff not to speak English at the front.  Some of the correspondents who did not speak German were not taken to the battle areas because the Foreign Office desired to avoid insults.  The year and a half between the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the severance of diplomatic relations was a period of terror for most Americans in Germany.  Only those who were so sympathetic with Germany that they were anti-American found it pleasant to live there.  One day one of the American girls employed in the confidential file room of the American Embassy was slapped in the face until she cried, by a German in civilian clothes, because she was speaking English in the subway. At another time the wife of a prominent American business man was spit upon and chased out of a public bus because she was speaking English. Then a group of women chased her down the street.  Another American woman was stabbed by a soldier when she was walking on "]]]
