The shadows were dark against the bank, but it seemed to him that they were darker than they had been before.  Ned's blood turned a little colder, and his scalp tingled. He was startled but not afraid. He looked intently, and saw moving figures in the river bed, keeping close against the bank. He could not see faces, he could not even discern a clear outline of the figures, but he had no doubt that these were Urrea's Mexicans. He waited only a moment longer to assure himself that the dark moving line was fact and not fancy. Then, aiming his rifle at the foremost shape, he fired. While the echo of the sharp crack was yet speeding across the plain he cried:  \"Up, men! up! Urrea is here!\"  A volley came from the creek bed, but in an instant the Panther, Obed, Will and Fields were by Ned's side.  \"Down on your faces,\" cried the Panther, \"an' pot 'em as they run! So they thought to go aroun' the grove, come down from the north an' surprise us this way! Give it to 'em, boys!\"  The rifles flashed and the dark line in the bed of the creek now broke into a huddle of flying forms. Three fell, but the rest ran, splashing through the sand and water, until they turned the curve and were protected from the deadly bullets. Then the Panther, calling to the others, rushed to the other side of the grove, where a second attack, led by Urrea in person, had been begun. Here men on horseback charged directly at the wood, but they were met by a fire which emptied more than one saddle.  Much of the charge was a blur to Ned, a medley of fire and smoke, of beating hoofs and of cries. But one thing he saw clearly and never forgot. It was the lame man with the thick white hair sitting with his back against a tree calmly firing a rifle at the Mexicans. Roylston had time for only two shots, but when he reloaded the second time he placed the rifle across his knees as before and smiled.  Most Mexican troops would have been content with a single charge, but these returned, encouraged by shouts and driven on by fierce commands. Ned saw a figure waving a sword. He believed it to be Urrea, and he fired, but he missed, and the next moment the horseman was lost in the shadows.  The second charge was beaten back like the first, and several skirmishers who tried to come anew down the bed of the creek were also put to flight. Two Mexicans got into the thickets and tried to stampede the horses, but the quickness of Obed and Fields defeated their aim. One of the Mexicans fell there, but the other escaped in the darkness.  When the second charge was driven back and the horses were quieted the Panther and Obed threshed up the woods, lest some Mexican musketeer should lie hidden there.  Nobody slept any more that night. Ned, Will and the Panther kept a sharp watch upon the bed of the creek, the moon and stars fortunately aiding them. But the Mexicans did not venture again by that perilous road, although toward morning they opened a scattering fire from the plain, many of their bullets whistling at random among the trees and thickets. Some of the Texans, crawling to the edge of the wood, replied, but they seemed to have little chance for a good shot, as the Mexicans lay behind a swell. The besiegers grew tired after a while and silence came again.  Three of the Texans had suffered slight wounds, but the Panther and Fields bound them up skillfully. It was still light enough for these tasks. Fields was particularly jubilant over their success, as he had a right to be. The day before he could look forward only to his own execution. Now he was free and victorious. Exultantly he hummed:      You've heard, I s'pose, of New Orleans,       It's famed for youth and beauty;     There are girls of every hue, it seems,       From snowy white to sooty.     Now Packenham has made his brags,       If he that day was lucky,     He'd have the girls and cotton bags       In spite of Old Kentucky.      But Jackson, he was wide awake,       And was not scared at trifles,     For well he knew Kentucky's boys,       With their death-dealing rifles.     He led them down to cypress swamp,       The ground was low and mucky;     There stood John Bull in martial pomp,       And here stood old Kentucky.  \"Pretty good song, that of yours,\" said the Panther approvingly. \"Where did you get it?\"  \"From my father,\" replied Fields. \"He's a Kentuckian, an' he fit at New Orleans. He was always hummin' that song, an' it come back to me after we drove off the Mexicans. Struck me that it was right timely.\"  Ned and Will, on their own initiative, had been drawing all the fallen logs that they could find and move to the edge of the wood, and having finished the task they came back to the bed of the creek. Roylston, the rifle across his knees, was sitting with his eyes closed, but he opened them as they approached. They were uncommonly large and bright eyes, and they expressed pleasure.  \"It gratifies me to see that neither of you is hurt,\" he said. \"This has been a strange night for two who are as young as you are. And it is a strange night for me, too. I never before thought that I should be firing at any one with intent to kill. But events are often too powerful for us.\"  He closed his eyes again.  \"I am going to sleep a little, if I can,\" he said.  But Ned and Will could not sleep. They went to Ned's old position at the edge of the creek bed, and together watched the opening dawn. They saw the bright sun rise over the great plains, and the dew sparkle for a little while on the brown grass. The day was cold, but apparently it had come with peace. They saw nothing on the plain, although they had no doubt that the Mexicans were waiting just beyond the first swell. But Ned and Will discerned three dark objects lying on the sand up the bed of the creek, and they knew that they were the men who had fallen in the first rush. Ned was glad that he could not see their faces.  At the suggestion of the Panther they lighted fires and had warm food and coffee again, thus putting heart into all the defenders. Then the Panther chose Ned for a little scouting work on horseback. Ned found Old Jack seeking blades of grass within the limits allowed by his lariat. But when the horse saw his master he stretched out his head and neighed.  \"I think I understand you,\" said Ned. \"Not enough food and no water. Well, I'll see that you get both later, but just now we're going on a little excursion.\"  The Panther and Ned rode boldly out of the trees, and advanced a short distance upon the plain. Two or three shots were fired from a point behind the first swell, but the bullets fell far short.  \"I counted on that,\" said the Panther. \"If a Mexican has a gun it's mighty hard for him to keep from firing it. All we wanted to do was to uncover their position an' we've done it. We'll go back now, an' wait fur them to make the first move.\"  But they did not go just yet. A man on horseback waving a large white handkerchief appeared on the crest of the swell and rode toward them. It was Urrea.  \"He knows that he can trust us, while we don't know that we can trust him,\" said the Panther, \"so we'll just wait here an' see what he has to say.\"  Urrea, looking fresh and spirited, came on with confidence and saluted in a light easy fashion. The two Americans did not return the salute, but waited gravely.  \"We can be polite, even if we are enemies,\" said Urrea, \"so I say good morning to you both, former friends of mine.\"  \"I have no friendship with spies and traitors,\" growled the Panther.  \"I serve my country in the way I think best,\" said Urrea, \"and you must remember that in our view you two are rebels and traitors.\"  \"We don't stab in the back,\" said the Panther.  Urrea flushed through his swarthy skin.  \"We will not argue the point any further,\" he said, \"but come at once to the business before us. First, I will admit several things. Your rescue of the prisoners was very clever. Also you beat us off last night, but I now have a hundred men with me and we have plenty of arms. We are bound to take you sooner or later.\"  \"Then why talk to us about it?\" said the Panther.  \"Because I wish to save bloodshed.\"  \"Wa'al, then, what do you have to say?\"  \"Give us the man, Roylston, and the rest of you can go free.\"  \"Why are you so anxious to have Roylston?\"  Ned eagerly awaited the answer. It was obvious that Roylston had rather minimized his own importance. Urrea flicked the mane of his mustang with a small whip and replied:  \"Our President and General, the illustrious Santa Anna, is extremely anxious to see him. Secrets of state are not for me. I merely seek to do my work.\"  \"Then you take this from me,\" said the Panther, a blunt frontiersman, \"my comrades an' me ain't buyin' our lives at the price of nobody else's.\"  \"You feel that way about it, do you?\"  \"That's just the way we feel, and I want to say, too, that I wouldn't take the word of either you or your Santa Anna. If we was to give up Mr. Roylston--which we don't dream of doin'--you'd be after us as hot an' strong as ever.\"  Urrea's swarthy cheeks flushed again.  \"I shall not notice your insults,\" he said. \"They are beneath me. I am a Mexican officer and gentleman, and you are mere riders of the plains.\"  \"All the same,\" said the Panther grimly, \"if you are goin' to talk you have to talk with us.\"  \"That is true,\" said Urrea lightly, having regained complete control of his temper. \"In war one cannot choose his enemies. I make you the proposition once more. Give us Roylston and go. If you do not accept we shall nevertheless take him and all of you who do not fall first. Remember that you are rebels and traitors and that you will surely be shot or hanged.\"  \"I don't remember any of them things,\" said the Panther grimly. \"What I do remember is that we are Texans fightin' fur our rights. To hang a man you've first got to catch him, an' to shoot him you've first got to hit him. An' since things"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],["title","The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#8)"],["body","to be remembered, remember that what you are tryin' to do to us we may first do to you. An' with that I reckon we'll bid you good day, Mr. Urrea.\"  Urrea bowed, but said nothing. He rode back toward his men, and Ned and the Panther returned to the grove. Roylston was much better that morning and he was able to stand, leaning against a tree.  \"May I ask the result of your conference,\" he said.  \"There ain't no secret about it,\" replied the Panther, \"but them Mexicans seem to be almighty fond of you, Mr. Roylston.\"  \"In what way did they show it?\"  \"Urrea said that all of us could go if we would give up you.\"  \"And your answer?\"  The Panther leaned forward a little on his horse.  \"You know something about the Texans, don't you, Mr. Roylston?\"  \"I have had much opportunity to observe and study them.\"  \"Well, they've got plenty of faults, but you haven't heard of them buyin' their lives at the price of a comrade's, have you?\"  \"I have not, but I wish to say, Mr. Palmer, that I'm sorry you returned this answer. I should gladly take my chances if the rest of you could go.\"  \"We'd never think of it,\" said the Panther. \"Besides, them Mexicans wouldn't keep their word. They're goin' to besiege us here, hopin' maybe that starvation or thirst will make us give you up. Now the first thing for us to do is to get water for the horses.\"  This presented a problem, as the horses could not go down to the creek, owing to the steep high banks, but the Texans soon solved it. The cliff was soft and they quickly cut a smooth sloping path with their knives and hatchets. Old Jack was the first to walk down it and Ned led him. The horse hung back a little, but Ned patted his head and talked to him as a friend and equal. Under such persuasion Old Jack finally made the venture, and when he landed safely at the bottom he drank eagerly. Then the other two horses followed. Meanwhile two riflemen kept a keen watch up and down the creek bed for lurking Mexican sharpshooters.  But the watering of the horses was finished without incident, and they were tethered once more in the thicket. Fields and another man kept a watch upon the plain, and the rest conferred under the trees. The Panther announced that by a great reduction of rations the food could be made to last two days longer. It was not a cheerful statement, as the Mexicans must know the scanty nature of their supplies, and would wait with all the patience of Indians.  \"All things, including starvation, come to him who waits long enough,\" said Obed White soberly.  \"We'll jest set the day through,\" said the Panther, \"an' see what turns up.\"  But the day was quite peaceful. It was warmer than usual and bright with sunshine. The Mexicans appeared on some of the knolls, seemingly near in the thin clear air, but far enough away to be out of rifle shot, and began to play cards or loll on their serapes. Several went to sleep.  \"They mean to show us that they have all the time in the world,\" said Ned to Will, \"and that they are willing to wait until we fall like ripe apples into their hands.\"  \"Do you think they will get us again?\" asked Will anxiously.  \"I don't. We've got food for two days and I believe that something will happen in our favor within that time. Do you notice, Will, that it's beginning to cloud up again? In winter you can't depend upon bright sunshine to last always. I think we're going to have a dark night and it's given me an idea.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"I won't tell you, because it may amount to nothing. It all depends upon what kind of night we have.\"  The sun did not return. The clouds banked up more heavily, and in the afternoon Ned went to the Panther. They talked together earnestly, looking frequently at the skies, and the faces of both expressed satisfaction. Then they entered the bed of the creek and examined it critically. Will was watching them. When the two separated and Ned came toward him, he said:  \"I can guess your idea now. We mean to escape to-night up the bed of the creek.\"  Ned nodded.  \"Your first guess is good,\" he said. \"If the promise of a dark night keeps up we're going to try.\"  The promise was fulfilled. The Mexicans made no hostile movement throughout the afternoon, but they maintained a rigid watch.  When the sun had set and the thick night had come down the Panther told of the daring enterprise they were about to undertake, and all approved. By nine o'clock the darkness was complete, and the little band gathered at the point where the path was cut down into the bed of the creek. It was likely that Mexicans were on all sides of the grove, but the Panther did not believe that any of them, owing to bitter experience, would enter the cut made by the stream. But, as leader, he insisted upon the least possible noise. The greatest difficulty would be with the horses. Ned, at the head of Old Jack, led the way.  Old Jack made the descent without slipping and in a few minutes the entire force stood upon the sand. They had made no sound that any one could have heard thirty yards away.  \"Now Mr. Roylston,\" whispered the Panther to the merchant, \"you get on Ned's horse an' we'll be off.\"  Roylston sighed. It hurt his pride that he should be a burden, but he was a man of few words, and he mounted in silence. Then they moved slowly over the soft sand. They had loaded the extra rifles and muskets on the other two horses, but every man remained thoroughly armed and ready on the instant for any emergency.  The Panther and Obed led. Just behind them came Ned and Will. They went very slowly in order to keep the horses' feet from making any sound that listening Mexican sentinels might hear. They were fortunate in the sand, which was fine and soundless like a carpet. Ned thought that the Mexicans would not make any attempt upon the grove until late at night, and then only with skirmishers and snipers. Or they might not make any attempt at all, content with their cordon.  But it was thrilling work as they crept along on the soft sand in the darkness and between the high banks. Ned felt a prickling of the blood. An incautious footstep or a stumble by one of the horses might bring the whole Mexican force down upon them at any moment. But there was no incautious footstep. Nor did any horse stumble. The silent procession moved on, passed the curve in the bed of the creek and continued its course.  Urrea had surrounded the grove completely. His men were on both sides of the creek, but no sound came to them, and they had a healthy respect for the deadly Texan rifles. Their leader had certainly been wise in deciding to starve them out. Meanwhile the little procession in the bed of the creek increased its speed slightly.  The Texans were now a full four hundred yards from the grove, and their confidence was rising.  \"If they don't discover our absence until morning,\" whispered Ned to Will, \"we'll surely get away.\"  \"Then I hope they won't discover it until then,\" said Will fervently. \"I don't want to die in battle just now, nor do I want to be executed in Mexico for a rebel or for anything else.\"  They were now a full mile from the grove and the banks of the creek were decreasing in height. They did not rise anywhere more than three or four feet. But the water increased in depth and the margin of sand was narrower. The Panther called a halt and they listened. They heard no sound but the faint moaning of the wind among the dips and swells, and the long lone howl of a lonesome coyote.  \"We've slipped through 'em! By the great horn spoon, we've slipped through 'em!\" said the Panther exultantly. \"Now, boys, we'll take to the water here to throw 'em off our track, when they try to follow it in the mornin'.\"  The creek was now about three feet in depth and flowing slowly like most streams in that region, but over a bed of hard sand, where the trace of a footstep would quickly vanish.  \"The water is likely to be cold,\" said the Panther, \"an' if any fellow is afraid of it he can stay behind and consort with the Mexicans who don't care much for water.\"  \"Lead on, Macduff,\" said Obed, \"and there's nobody who will cry 'hold, enough.'\"  The Panther waded directly into the middle of the stream, and all the others followed. The horses, splashing the water, made some noise, but they were not so careful in that particular now since they had put a mile between themselves and the grove. In fact, the Panther urged them to greater speed, careless of the sounds, and they kept in the water for a full two miles further. Then they quit the stream at a point where the soil seemed least likely to leave traces of their footsteps, and stood for a little while upon the prairie, resting and shivering. Then they started at a rapid pace across the country, pushing for the Rio Grande until noon. Then Fields stalked and shot an antelope, with which they renewed their supply of food. In the afternoon it rained heavily, but by dark they reached the Rio Grande, across which they made a dangerous passage, as the waters had risen, and stood once more on the soil of Texas.  \"Thank God!\" said Will.  \"Thank God!\" repeated Ned.  Then they looked for shelter, which all felt they must have.     CHAPTER IV  THE CABIN IN THE WOODS   It proved a difficult matter to find shelter. All the members of the little group were wet and cold, and a bitter wind with snow began to whistle once more across the plain. But every one strove to be cheerful and the relief that their escape had brought was still a tonic to their spirits. Yet they were not without comment upon their condition.  \"I've seen hard winters in Maine,\" said Obed White, \"but there you were ready for them. Here it tricks you with warm sunshine and then with snow. You suffer from surprise.\"  \"We've got to find a cabin,\" said the Panther.  \"Why not make it a whole city with a fine big hotel right in the center of it?\" said Obed. \"Seems to me there's about as much chance of one as the other.\"  \"No, there ain't,\" said the Panther. \"There ain't no town, but there are huts. I've "]]]
