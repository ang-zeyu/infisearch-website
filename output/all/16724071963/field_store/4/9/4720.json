How Mr. Mouse trembled!  He nearly fell off the clock, he was so frightened.  He took one jump down to the floor, and then he ran.  Oh, how he ran! Across the dining-room, across the kitchen, across the pantry, and into his hole he ran!  \"Oh, my dear, my dear! what is the matter?\" cried his wife. \"Did you see the dog? Was the cat chasing you?\"  \"No, no!\" panted Mr. Mouse.  \"I was hunting for a house, and I climbed up on a tall box.  \"Just as I had found the very place for us, there was an awful noise inside the box.\"  \"That was a clock, my dear,\" said his wife.  \"It tells Boy Blue's mother when to have dinner, and when to put the baby to bed.  \"I have heard her telling Boy Blue about it.\"  \"I think it was telling me it was time to go home,\" said Mr. Mouse, and they both laughed softly so as not to wake up the babies.  The next night Mr. Mouse went house hunting in the barn.  There he found a very good home in a box of grain.       Mistress Mary, quite contrary,     How does your garden grow?   With silver bells, and cockle shells,     And pretty maids all in a row.     MISTRESS MARY   Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mary.  She had no brothers and sisters, but she had a dear, good father and mother.  Mary always went to school with her little friends.  She played with them after school and on Saturdays.  One Saturday in winter all the children went coasting down the long hill near the school-house.  Mary took her new red sled and went with them.  Oh, it was such fun to coast down that long hill!  The children ran and laughed and shouted all the way.  They had not been coasting long when Mary fell off her sled right into a snow bank.  That was fun, too, and Mary didn't care one bit.  But when she tried to stand up, it hurt her so it made tears come into her brown eyes.  \"Are you hurt very much?\" asked Little Boy Blue.  \"My foot hurts,\" said Mary, trying not to cry.  \"We'll give you a ride home,\" said Jack Horner.  So Mary sat on her sled, and Boy Blue and Jack Horner played they were her horses.  They trotted so fast that Mary was soon at home and in her mother's arms.  When the doctor saw Mary's foot he shook his head.  \"This little girl has sprained her foot,\" he said.  \"She will have to stay in the house for some time.\"  I am afraid Mary cried when the doctor said this.  She did not like to stay at home.  She wanted to go to school with all her playmates.  She wanted to go coasting and skating and play in the snow.  In a few days Mary could sit by the window and watch the children.  Then she was not so lonely.  Jack brought home her school books and she studied very hard.  \"I want to keep up with my class, Mamma,\" she said.  So every day Mary and her mother played school together.  Every week Miss Brown came in to see how the little girl was getting along.  Of course the children went to see Mary very often.  They told her everything they had been doing in school.  One day Jack said, \"I think it would be good fun to give Mary a surprise party.\"  \"Oh yes,\" said Alice, \"and we can all take something to make her happy.\"  \"We can have the party next Saturday afternoon,\" said Jack.  \"I asked Mary's mother, and she said we could come at two o'clock.\"  At recess the children told Miss Brown about the surprise party.  \"Why don't you take some plants to Mary?\" she said.  \"Then she could have a garden to watch while she has to stay in the house.\"  \"Oh, that's just the thing for Mistress Mary,\" said Jack.  And all the children began to sing:--   \"Mistress Mary quite contrary     How does your garden grow?   With silver bells, and cockle shells,     And pretty maids all in a row.\"  Saturday afternoon Mary was playing with her dolls when the bell rang.  \"Alice has come to play with me,\" she thought.  Just then the door opened and there stood twelve little boys and girls.  [Illustration]  Each one was carrying a plant with a pretty, bright blossom.  They marched in singing \"Mistress Mary,\" and little Mistress Mary laughed, and cried, and clapped her hands, all in one minute.  Then the children put the plants on a table near the window where Mary could see them.  There were geraniums, and pinks; a sweet heliotrope, and a rose-bush with a pink rose.  Alice brought the heliotrope, and Jack brought the rose-bush.  How bright and cheerful the plants made the room look!  The children stayed an hour and played games with Mary.  They played \"hide the thimble\" and one or two guessing games, because Mary could not run around the room with them.  Then they had some little cakes and cookies which Mary's mother had made for them.  When it was time to go home they left a very happy little girl.  \"Good-bye,\" said Mary, \"I hope you will come very often.  \"Thank you for the lovely plants. My table looks like a flower garden.\"  \"Yes, Mistress Mary,\" said Jack, \"we'll come to see how your garden grows. You ought to have some silver bells and some cockle shells.\"  In a few weeks Mistress Mary, as every one called her now, came back to school.  She could run and play as well as any of the children.  But she did not forget her garden, and she often brought some of her flowers to school.  When the spring came she made a garden out of doors for her plants.  And what do you think she put all around the flower bed?  She put a splendid row of little white shells.       Little Tommy Tucker,     Sings for his supper.   What shall he eat?     White bread and butter.   How can he cut it without any knife?   How can he marry without any wife?     TOMMY TUCKER   One summer Mary went to make Grandma Hall a visit.  Grandma's little girls were all grown up now, and Grandma and Grandpa lived alone on the farm.  Mary liked to go there to visit because Grandma could tell such splendid stories, and there were always so many things to do.  It was Saturday and Mary had been busy all the morning helping Grandma make cookies, and pies, and cakes.  After dinner Grandma and little Mary took their sewing and sat out under the old apple-tree in the garden.  Grandma was making a cap, and Mary was making a white apron for her mother.  They had been sitting there only a little while when Mary saw a ragged boy coming down the road towards the house.  Running along close behind him was a ragged little dog.  The boy had a violin in his hand.  When he saw the little girl and her grandmother he stood still and began to play.  As he played, the little dog stood up on his hind legs and tried to sing.  \"Bow--wow, wow!\" he barked, and oh he did look so funny!  \"Please ask the boy to bring that funny dog over here, Grandma,\" said Mary.  \"Come here, little boy,\" said Grandma. \"What is your name?\"  \"My name is Tommy,\" said the boy, \"and this is my dog Rags.\"  \"Run and get Tommy and the dog some cookies, Mary,\" said Grandma, \"I guess they are both hungry.\"  Tommy looked so tired that Mrs. Hall asked him to sit down and rest.  \"Where do you live?\" she asked.  \"I don't live anywhere,\" replied Tommy, \"I just have my dog Rags, and he and I sleep wherever we can.\"  \"Well,\" said Grandma, \"you must both stay here to-night. We can find a place for a boy and a dog somewhere in this big house.\"  I can't tell you how happy Tommy was.  Rags seemed happy, too.  He did all the tricks he knew, and for every trick he got a big, sweet cookie.  After supper Tommy wanted to help, so he went out to the barn with Grandpa Hall.  Rags trotted along behind him, wagging his tail and barking at everything he saw.  \"What can you do, Tommy?\" asked Grandpa.  \"I can play my violin and sing,\" said Tommy. \"That is all I know how to do.\"    \"Little Tommy Tucker,   Sings for his supper.  \"I think we shall have to call you 'Tommy Tucker',\" said Grandpa.  But Tommy could do many things besides sing and play.  He helped Grandpa Hall feed the hens and chickens.  He gave them fresh water and found all the eggs.  Then he brought in some wood for Grandma's fire.  There are a great many things for a boy to do on a farm.  That night, after the children had gone to bed, Grandpa said,  \"I wish Tommy could live here with us all the time.  \"I would like a good boy to help me.\"  \"That is a good idea,\" said Grandma.  \"It is lonely now that all our children are gone.  \"And Tommy is just the kind of a boy I like.\"  So the next morning Grandma asked Tommy if he would like to live with them.  [Illustration]  \"Could Rags stay here, too?\" asked Tommy.  \"Of course he could,\" said Grandma.  \"You could help Grandpa in the summer, and in the winter you could go to school.\"  What do you think Tommy did?  He couldn't say a word.  He threw his arms around Grandma's neck and kissed her.  \"Bow-wow,\" said Rags, jumping up beside them and barking as hard as he could.  \"Bow-wow, this is a good home, Tommy.\"  And Tommy thought so too.       This little pig went to market,   This little pig stayed at home,   This little pig had bread and butter,   This little pig had none,   This little pig cried, \"Wee, wee, wee!   I can't find my way home!\"     FIVE LITTLE PIGS   Tommy Tucker and Mary had been busy all day helping Grandpa Hall pick apples.  Now the supper dishes were done and the lamp was lighted.  \"Tell us a story, Grandma,\" they begged.  \"What shall I tell you?\" said Grandma. \"Shall I tell you about 'The Three Bears,' or 'Tom Thumb,' or 'Red Riding Hood'?\"  \"Tell us a new story, please,\" said Mary.  \"Well, I will tell you the story of the 'Five Little Pigs'.\"  \"What five little pigs?\" the children asked at the same moment.  \"You know,\" said Grandma.   \"This little pig went to market,   This little pig stayed at home,   This little pig had bread and butter,   This little pig had none,   This little pig cried, 'Wee, wee, wee!      'I can't find my way home!'\"  \"Is there a story about those little pigs?\" asked Mary. \"I know I should like that.\"  So Grandma Hall told the children this story:  Once upon a time there was a mother pig and she had five"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16046"],["title","Boy Blue and His Friends (#3)"],["body","pigs.  They were the very prettiest little pigs you ever saw.  They were every one white, with pretty pink noses and very curly tails.  Perhaps the mother pig tied each little tail up at night to make it curl more tightly.  Curly and Whitey, Pearly and Twisty, and Baby, were the names of the five little pigs.  One day the mother pig said to Curly: \"You must go to market to-day, my son. I want a nice big cabbage for my soup.\"  So this little pig went to market.  The market was not very far away,--just down the road and across the field to Grandpa Hall's cabbage patch.  \"Be sure and get a good large one,\" said the mother pig, as Curly trotted away.  \"Oh, Mother,\" said Whitey, \"may I go to market with Curly?\"  \"No, Whitey,\" said his mother, \"I want you to stay at home and take care of Baby.  \"I shall be very busy all the morning.  \"You may take Baby out into the yard and play with her.\"  So this little pig stayed at home.  Whitey took Baby and went out into the yard.  Pearly and Twisty were out there, but they were not playing.  I am sorry to have to say that they were quarrelling, for one little pig had some bread and butter and the other little pig had none.  After a while the two little pigs stopped quarrelling, and then they all began to play together.  First they played tag, then they played hide and seek.  \"Oh, there is Curly!\" said Whitey.  \"See what a big cabbage he has!\"  Sure enough, Curly was coming down the road with a cabbage as big as his own head.  Mother Pig took the cabbage and put it into her soup.  Oh, how good the dinner did smell to the hungry little pigs!  \"Come to dinner, children,\" called their mother at last; and then what a scampering there was!  One, two, three, four little pigs.  They almost fell over each other, they were in such a hurry.  \"Where is Baby?\" cried Mother Pig.  Then all the pigs were so frightened that their noses turned white.  Where was she, indeed?  They had forgotten to watch her while they were playing hide and seek.  Where could she be?  They all ran out of the house faster than they ran in.  \"Perhaps she ran after me and got lost,\" thought Curly, and he ran down the big road.  Pearly thought she would go to the woods behind the barn.  Twisty ran across the big meadow.  Mother Pig walked slowly up the road, looking behind all the trees and under all the bushes.  \"Baby, Baby, Baby!\" you could hear them all calling.  As Twisty ran along beside the brook, she thought she heard a noise.  \"Baby, Baby!\" she called.  \"Wee, wee, wee!\" cried Baby Pig, \"I can't find my way home.\"  When Twisty heard this she ran so fast she nearly fell into the brook.  There sat Baby Pig on a stone, wiping the tears out of her eyes with an oak leaf.  \"Oh, Baby!\" said Twisty, giving her sister a good hug, \"what made you run away?\"  \"I didn't run away, I got lost,\" said Baby, \"and I want to see my mother.\"  So Twisty and Baby ran home as fast as they could.  There were all the little pigs looking very sad because they had not found Baby.  When they saw her coming they ran to meet her, and Curly carried her into the house \"pig-a-back.\"  Then they ate their cabbage soup, an it tasted all the better for waiting.       Jack and Jill     Went up the hill,       To get a pail of water.   Jack fell down     And broke his crown,       And Jill came tumbling after.     JACK AND JILL   Tommy Tucker and Mary had many good times together that summer.  They fished in the brook at the end of the meadow.  They went berrying and took their dinner with them.  They rode to market in the big wagon with Grandpa Hall.  In fact, they did everything that boys and girls who live on a farm like to do.  But they did not always play alone.  In the very next house lived another little boy and girl.  This little boy and girl were twins, and they looked as much alike as two green peas.  Mary called them Jack and Jill, but I don't know what their mother called them.  Jack and Jill lived in a little house at the top of the hill.  In the winter, when the snow was on the ground, it was fine coasting down that long hill.  The twins had new red sleds that Santa Claus had left them on Christmas morning.  Jack's sled was named \"Racer,\" and Jill called hers \"Lady Bird.\"  Their father had to paint the names on the sleds, for the sleds were twins, too.  After school and on Saturday you could often find Jack and Jill, with \"Racer\" and \"Lady Bird,\" coasting down the hill together.  But this story is not about coasting in the winter.  It is about a slide Jack and Jill took one day in summer.  Mary and Tommy Tucker went to Jack's house one morning to play with the twins.  Jill saw them coming and ran out to meet them.  \"Come down to the sand-bank,\" she cried. \"We've got something new down there. Papa gave it to us.\"  So they all took hold of hands and ran down the hill.  \"Be careful, Jack,\" said Tommy.  \"Don't fall down and break your crown.\"  When they reached the sand-bank, what do you think they found?  There was an old stove with a great big oven.  Some of the covers were gone, and there was no funnel. But the oven was all right, and that was what Mary needed.  \"Let's make our oven full of cakes and pies,\" said Mary.  \"I'll build the fire,\" said Jack.  \"And I'll help you get the wood,\" said Tommy.  How the boys worked to get some dry leaves and sticks!  Of course they could not light the fire but it was almost as much fun.  The little girls went to work at once getting out their table and dishes.  The table was a long board, and their dishes came from everywhere.  The pie plates were pretty, round shells that Mary had brought from the seashore.  Grandma Hall had given them some small tins to make cakes in.  Then there was a cracked bowl and a teapot without a handle.  Plenty of dishes, you see, for a morning's baking.  \"What shall we bake this morning?\" said Mary.  \"Oh, let's make some plum cake and blueberry cake.  \"Then we can make some blueberry pies and some apple pies.\"  \"Oh yes!\" said Mary, \"and I'll make some apple turnovers.\"  By this time the boys had the fire laid and the wood-box filled with wood.  \"What can we do now?\" said Tommy.  \"You can get us some blueberries for our cakes and pies,\" said Jill.  So the boys took the cracked bowl and filled it with little round seeds they called blueberries.  \"I know where I can get some apples,\" said Mary, and away she ran across the field.  She was back again in a few minutes with her apron full of little green apples.  \"You know, Jill,\" she said, \"green apples make very good pies.\"  Just then the boys came back with the berries and the baking was begun.  After a dozen pies had been put into the oven, Jill said, \"Oh, Jack! we must have some more water.  \"Will you run up to the house and get some?\"  \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"if someone will go with me.\"  Tommy had gone for more apples and Mary was mixing her cake.  \"I will go with you,\" said Jill. \"Here is our pail.\"  So Jack and Jill went up the hill to get a pail of water.  Their mother let them fill their pail.  Then she gave them four cookies that she had just taken from the oven.  When they started down the hill, Jack began to run.  [Illustration]  \"Oh, do be careful, Jack!\" said Jill, \"or you will--\"  But she didn't say any more.  For down went Jack, down went Jill, and down went the pail.  Tommy and Mary saw them fall and ran to help them.  \"Oh, Jack!\" said Mary, \"did you break your crown?\"  \"No,\" laughed Jack, \"but Jill came tumbling after.\"  \"We ought to have known better than to let Jack and Jill go for a pail of water,\" said Tommy.  \"I've broken the cookies,\" said Jill.  \"Let's go and ask Mamma for some more.\"  So they all went up the hill for more water and cookies.  This time Mary and Tommy carried the water down the hill.  The pies were baked, and the cakes ready to put into the oven in a very few minutes.  When Jill's mother called the children to dinner, there was a long row of cakes and pies and, cookies.  \"We ought to eat our dinner here,\" said Mary.  \"I like mother's pies and cookies best,\" said Jack.  So Jack and Jill ran up the hill once more, and Mary and Tommy climbed over the fence and ran across the garden to see what Grandma Hall had for their dinner.       Little Jack Homer   Sat in a corner,     Eating his Christmas pie;   He put in his thumb   And pulled out a plum,     And said, \"What a big boy am I!\"     JACK HORNER'S PIE   I am going to tell you about another one of Boy Blue's friends.  His name was Jack Horner.  At least, Boy Blue called him Jack Horner.  And I'll tell you why he called him Jack Horner, too.  His real name was Jack Horne.  Jack was a very jolly boy.  He had round red cheeks and twinkling eyes, and he was always running and jumping about and laughing at everything.  One morning when he waked up he was happier than ever.  In fact, he was the happiest boy in town.  I know he was, for he said so, and he ought to know.  His birthday was coming.  Indeed, it was the very next day.  And the very next day was Christmas, too.  Think of having a birthday and Christmas on the same day!  How would you like that?  Jack was going to have a birthday party.  Or was it a Christmas party?  Jack couldn't tell which it was.  All the children were coming,--Boy Blue, and Mary, and Alice, and Tommy Tucker, and ever so many more.  There was a secret about the party.  Jack's mother had told him, but he would not tell.  Boy Blue tried to guess.  \"Is it a Christmas tree, Jack?\"  \"Are we going to make candy?\"  \"Is Santa Claus coming?\"  \"Are we going on a sleigh-ride?\"  \"No, no, no!\" said Jack. \"You will never guess.\"  At last Christmas Day came.  Jack could hardly stop to look at all of his presents.  He was thinking of the party and of getting the secret ready.  At two o'clock the children came to the party.  They each brought Jack a present.  Mistress Mary brought him some roses.  \"They grew on the rose-bush you gave me,\" she said.  At first the children played games.  They played \"blind man's buff,\" and \"hide the"]]]
