I know by the feel of the air.\"  \"Let it come!\" said the Little Red House. \"I don't care. I couldn't be more miserable than I am.\"  Just as he said that, one great rain-drop fell right on the middle of his roof--Plop!  \"It's coming already,\" cried the Blue-gum, \"and it's going to pour.\"  Then three more big drops fell--Plop! Plop! Plop!  \"I have never in my life seen such big rain-drops,\" said the Blue-gum. \"I've lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for--\"  But--Crash! came rain before he could finish; and in two seconds everything was sopping wet. The noise of it was deafening,  \"Why, it's a cloud-burst!\" shouted the Blue-gum. \"Half of my leaves have been stripped off already.\" Then he peered through the rain and the dark to see how the Little Red House was taking it. \"Why, what's the matter with your face?\" he cried. \"You look awful.\"  \"I'm crying!\" sobbed the Little Red House. \"That's all--just crying. \"Can't you see the tears?\"  \"Nonsense!\" said the Blue-gum. \"Those are not tears. It's just the rain-water running off your window-sills.\"  \"I tell you I'm crying!\" wailed the Little Red House. \"I'm crying bitterly. I should know, shouldn't I? I'm shivering and crying because I'm cold and lonely and miserable.\"  \"Oh, very well,\" agreed the Blue-gum. \"You are crying. But if this rain doesn't stop soon, you'll cry the front path away. It certainly is wet.\"  Very late that night the rain eased a little and then stopped altogether. The tears ceased to run from the eyes of the Little Red House, and they now came only in drops, slower and slower, falling into the great pool by the front door.  \"It's a hard world!\" sobbed the Little Red House, squeezing out another tear.  \"Listen!\" cried the Big Blue-gum. \"Do you hear THAT?\"  From far away on the distant ranges came a dull, moaning sound. As they listened it grew louder, and right in the middle of of it came another sound--Thump!  \"That's wind,\" said the Blue-gum; \"and a big wind, too.\"  \"Let it come!\" sighed the Little Red House. \"I couldn't be more miserable than I am.\"  As he spoke, the moaning grew louder, and there were three or four quite big thumps one after another.  \"What's that thumping?\" asked the little House.  \"Those are my poor brothers,\" answered the big Blue-gum very sadly, \"Those are trees going down before the big wind. The birds were bringing me messages from those poor fellows quite lately; and now I shall never hear from them again. It's very sad.\"  \"I never thought the wind could blow down big trees,\" said the Little House.  \"No tree knows when his time will come,\" the big Blue-gum answered gravely. \"I've had some very narrow escapes in my time, as tree and sapling on this mountain.\"  The Little Red House was very quiet and thoughtful for a long time after that. Then he asked suddenly, \"Which way do you think you would fall if you did fall?\"  But the big Blue-gum said that he couldn't tell. It depended on the wind, and he might fall any way.  \"Not on me!\" cried the Little House.  The Blue-gum said that he didn't know; but he hoped not.  \"If you DID fall on me,\" said the Little Red House, \"I suppose it would hurt me.\"  The Blue-gum said it certainly would, and there would be very little left but splinters and glass.  \"Then don't! Please don't,\" yelled the Little Red House.  But before they could say another word the great wind struck them with a roar. It tossed the roses about so that the eyebrows of the Little House seemed to be twitching horribly; and it swayed the big Blue-gum this way and that till he appeared to be fighting for his very life. It picked up the fallen leaves and twigs, and even small stones, and hurled them down the mountain in a cloud.  In the midst of all the uproar the Little House heard the Blue-gum calling to him.  \"As long as I've lived upon this mountain, tree and sapling,\" he shouted, \"I've never known such a wind. I'm not so young as I used to be, and I fear that my end has come.\"  \"Be brave! Oh, be brave!\" implored the Little Red House. \"Don't let him blow you down. I should be so sorry to lose you, What are you grunting for?\"  \"I'm not grunting,\" answered the Blue-gym in a pained voice. \"Those are my roots giving way, one by one. I can't stand much more of this. Look out!\"  The Little Red House looked up, and what he saw terrified him. The big Blue-gum, in the clutch of the wind, was bent right over him, so that the top branches seemed to be just above his roof; and the great tree appeared to be falling, falling, helplessly.  \"Don't fall on me!\" shrieked the Little Red House. \"Oh, don't fall on me; because, if you do, you know you'll squash me! I don't want to be squashed!\"  But the big Blue-gum said, \"There is just one little root holding now. If that gives way we are both done for.\"  \"Be brave! Oh, be brave!\" shrieked the Little Red House.  Then slowly, very slowly, the big Blue-gum began to straighten up again, away from the Little Red House.  \"I have stood upon this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred years,\" he said when he had recovered; \"but if it blows like that again, it is the end of me.\"  But it did not blow like that again; though the wind howled and shrieked all that day as if it was very angry and disappointed that it could not blow down the big Blue-gum.  Then, towards evening, the wind fell; the heavy clouds went away beyond the edge of the sky, and all became very calm and peaceful.  The birds came from their hiding places and sat in the branches of the Blue-gum and chattered away to him, until he began to feel quite cheerful once more, in spite of his trouble. And when a certain little Tree-creeper--a very wise bird--came and had a long, serious talk with the Blue-gum, he became very much interested indeed and quite happy.  But the Little Red House was miserable still; and the beauty of the evening didn't cheer him up one bit.  \"Ah, well,\" said the Blue-gum, when the darkness came to the mountain, \"I am going to have a good sleep tonight. I'm a match still for old Daddy Wind, in spite of all his noise and bluster. And there are ways of dealing with white-ants, too. I've lived upon this mountain, tree and sapling, for--\"  But as he was talking he fell fast asleep.  The Little Red House did not sleep. How could he, with his eyes wide open? So he just stood there all night staring before him, lonely and wretched. And when an owl came and sat in the tree and began to call, \"Mopoke,\" the Little Red House told him rudely to stop his silly noise and clear out. That will just show you how very miserable he was.  It was quite late next morning when the Blue-gum awoke. He stretched his big limbs, and began to wonder what he might say to comfort the Little Red House. But when the Blue-gum looked down, he saw that the Little Red House was smiling all over his face.  \"Well, now!\" cried the big Blue-gum cheerfully. \"That's the kind of face I like to see in the morning! So you've decided to be sensible and forget your loneliness?\"  But the Little Red House didn't say a word. He just went on smiling.  Then the big Blue-gum began to get uneasy.  \"I do hope your troubles haven't turned you silly,\" he said. \"You haven't lost your senses, have you?\"  \"I?\" cried the Little Red House. \"Why, look down the valley! See who's coming!\"  Down, far down, the valley, just coming through the white gate, were two figures that looked like tiny specks. And much nearer was another speck, which was certainly a little dog.  \"It's them--I mean those are they!\" shouted the Little Red House happily. \"Sym and Emily Ann! And here comes our little dog.\"  \"Well, you certainly have sharp eyes,\" replied the Blue-gum. \"But I suppose I'm getting old--over a hundred years, you know.\"  The two figures were through the white gate now, and had crossed the red road out on to the stony flat--getting bigger and bigger as they came; and the smile on the Little Red House seemed to grow broader and broader. On they came, under the tree-ferns, up by the big rocks, past the sign-post. And now the Little Red House could hear Sym singing his Tinker's song.  But it was not quite the same song this time:  \"Kettles and pans! Ho, kettles and pans! Where's there a home like the tinkering man's? Weary of wandering, home is the place-- The Little Red House with the smile on his face-- Weary and hungry, my Emily Ann. Then put on the kettle! Ho, put on the pan!\"  \"Now THAT is the sort of song I DO like,\" said the Little Red House, as he watched them coming up the mountain.  On they came, growing bigger and bigger--through the sliprails, across the potato paddock, over the bridge, round by the bracken-patch, past the black stump, through the gate, and here they were, right at the front door.  \"Oh, I AM glad to be home again,\" cried Emily Ann. \"And do look at the Little House. He seems to be smiling.\"  \"Of course he is smiling,\" answered Sym; \"but he has a very dirty face.\"  \"The storm did that,\" said Emily Ann. \"Now hurry and get the fire alight, and I'll put the kettle on.\" And they went inside laughing and singing, while the little dog flew round the house, barking for dear life, and pretending he was very busy seeing everything was in order.  \"Now I suppose you're happy,\" said the big Blue-gum to the Little Red House.  \"Happy?\" cried the Little House. \"Of course I am. Why, I'm a home again!\" But suddenly he remembered that his own happiness had made him forget all about his old friend's troubles; and he tried his best to look serious, as he said: \"But what about YOU? Are the white-ants still troubling you?\"  \"Ah!\" replied the Blue-gum. \"Don't let that worry you. Yesterday I had a talk with the doctor--Doctor Tree-creeper, you know--a very clever little bird he is, and he knows all about white-ants. He examined me thoroughly all over. He says that they have hardly got under my skin yet, and he will have them all out in a couple of days. So THAT'S all "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16251"],["title","A Book for Kids (#3)"],["body","right.\"  \"Well, I am glad,\" shouted the Little Red House. \"Now we are ALL happy!\"  Then Sym got the fire started, and the smoke curled up, and the Little House had his gay blue feather once again. Sym began to sing his Tinker's Song louder than ever, and Emily Ann, who was getting the meal ready, joined in and sang too. Very soon the kettle also began to sing, and, when the pan heard that HE began to sing. Then Doctor Tree-creeper arrived to attend to the white-ants, and, as he walked round the trunk of the big Blue-gum, tapping it just like a doctor, HE began to sing. And two Kookaburras, who were sitting on the fence, were so tickled with it all, that they laughed and laughed till they made everyone else laugh with them.  \"This is quite like old times,\" laughed the big Blue-gum. \"Are you contented now?\"  \"Am I contented?\" cried the Little Red House. \"Am I contented? Well, what would you think?\"  And then--well, most ordinary grown-up folk would tell you that just then Emily Ann drew down one of the front blinds. But all the big Blue-gum knew, and all you and I know, is that the Little Red House winked.  And when I saw him last, his smile was as broad as ever, and he was still winking.    THE PIEMAN  I'd like to be a pieman, and ring a little bell, Calling out, \"Hot pies! Hot pies to sell!\" Apple-pies and Meat-pies, Cherry-pies as well, Lots and lots and lots of pies--more than you can tell. Big, rich Pork-pies! Oh, the lovely smell!    But I wouldn't be a pieman if . . .        I wasn't very well.          Would you?    THE TRIANTIWONTIGONGOLOPE  There's a very funny insect that you do not often spy, And it isn't quite a spider, and it isn't quite a fly; It is something like a beetle, and a little like a bee, But nothing like a wooly grub that climbs upon a tree. Its name is quite a hard one, but you'll learn it soon, I hope. So try:    Tri-       Tri-anti-wonti-          Triantiwontigongolope.  It lives on weeds and wattle-gum, and has a funny face; Its appetite is hearty, and its manners a disgrace. When first you come upon it, it will give you quite a scare, But when you look for it again, you find it isn't there. And unless you call it softly it will stay away and mope. So try:    Tri-       Tri-anti-wonti-          Triantiwontigongolope.  It trembles if you tickle it or tread upon its toes; It is not an early riser, but it has a snubbish nose. If you snear at it, or scold it, it will scuttle off in shame, But it purrs and purrs quite proudly if you call it by its name, And offer it some sandwiches of sealing-wax and soap. So try:    Tri-       Tri-anti-wonti-          Triantiwontigongolope .  But of course you haven't seen it; and I truthfully confess That I haven't seen it either, and I don't know its address. For there isn't such an insect, though there really might have been If the trees and grass were purple, and the sky was bottle green. It's just a little joke of mine, which you'll forgive, I hope. Oh, try!    Tri-       Tri-anti-wonti-          Triantiwontigongolope.    THE CIRCUS  Hey, there!  Hoop-la! the circus is in town! Have you seen the elephant?  Have you seen the clown? Have you seen the dappled horse gallop round the ring? Have you seen the acrobats on the dizzy swing? Have you seen the tumbling men tumble up and down? Hoop-la!  Hoop-la! the circus is in town!  Hey, there!  Hoop-la!  Here's the circus troupe! Here's the educated dog, jumping through the hoop. See the lady Blondin with the parasol and fan, The lad upon the ladder and the india-rubber man. See the joyful juggler and the boy who loops the loop. Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Here's the circus troupe!    YOU AND I  They say the eagle is a bird That sees some splendid sights When he soars high into the sky Upon his dizzy flights: He sees the ground for miles around Our house, and Billy Johnson's; But we cannot be eagles, for That would, of course, be nonsense.  But you and I, some summer day, Providing we're allowed, Will go up in an aeroplane And sail right through a cloud. But, if they say we may not go, We'll stay upon the ground With other things that have no wings, And watch them walk around.  They say the bottom of the sea Is beautiful to view; They say the fish, whene'er they wish, Can sail and see it, too; The shining pearls, the coral curls, The sharks, the squids, the schnappers, And fish with fins (though not in tins) And fish with funny flappers.  But you and I, some sunny day, When weather's in condition, Will go there in a submarine, Providing we've permission.  But if they say we may not go We must respect their wishes; And you and I will just keep dry Because we are not fishes.  The earth is quite a jolly place, And we don't care for flying; And things that creep down in the deep Are sometimes rather trying. So, if they'll grant a holiday Or even only half, We'll lie upon some grassy place, And think of things, and laugh.    GOING TO SCHOOL  Did you see them pass to-day, Billy, Kate and Robin, All astride upon the back of old grey Dobbin? Jigging, jogging off to school, down the dusty track-- What must Dobbin think of it--three upon his back? Robin at the bridle-rein, in the middle Kate, Billy holding on behind, his legs out straight.  Now they're coming back from school, jig, jog, jig. See them at the corner where the gums grow big; Dobbin flicking off the flies and blinking at the sun-- Having three upon his back he thinks is splendid fun: Robin at the bridle-rein, in the middle Kate, Little Billy up behind, his legs out straight.    HIST!  Hist! . . . . . . Hark! The night is very dark, And we've to go a mile or so Across the Possum Park.  Step . . . . . . light, Keeping to the right; If we delay, and lose our way, We'll be out half the night. The clouds are low and gloomy. Oh! It's just begun to mist! We haven't any overcoats And--Hist! . . . . . . Hist!  (Mo . . . . . . poke!) Who was that that spoke? This is not a fitting spot To make a silly joke.  Dear . . . . . . me! A mopoke in a tree! It jarred me so, I didn't know Whatever it could be. But come along; creep along; Soon we shall be missed. They'll get a scare and wonder where We--Hush! . . . . . . Hist!  Ssh! . . . . . . Soft! I've told you oft and oft We should not stray so far away Without a moon aloft.  Oo! . . . . . . Scat! Goodness! What was that? Upon my word, it's quite absurd, It's only just a cat. But come along; haste along; Soon we'll have to rush, Or we'll be late and find the gate Is--Hist! . . . . . . Hush!  (Kok!. . . . . . Korrock!) Oh! I've had a shock! I hope and trust it's only just A frog behind a rock.  Shoo! . . . . . . Shoo! We've had enough of you; Scaring folk just for a joke Is not the thing to do. But come along, slip along-- Isn't it a lark Just to roam so far from home On--Hist! . . . . . . Hark!  Look! . . . . . . See! Shining through the tree, The window-light is glowing bright To welcome you and me.  Shout! . . . . . . Shout! There's someone round about, And through the door I see some more And supper all laid out. Now, run! Run! Run! Oh, we've had such splendid fun-- Through the park in the dark, As brave as anyone.  Laughed, we did, and chaffed, we did, And whistled all the way, And we're home again! Home again! Hip . . . . . . Hooray!    BIRD SONG  I am friendly with the sparrow Though his mind is rather narrow    And his manners--well, the less we say the better. But as day begins to peep, When I hear his cheery \"Cheep\"    I am ready to admit I am his debtor  I delight in red-browed finches And all birds of scanty inches.    Willie wagtail is a pleasant bird, and coy. All the babblers, chats and wrens, Tits and robins, and their hens,    Are my very special friends, and bring me joy.    THE MUSIC OF YOUR VOICE  A vase upon the mantelpiece,    A ship upon the sea, A goat upon a mountain-top    Are much the same to me; But when you mention melon jam,    Or picnics by the creek, Or apple pies, or pantomimes,    I love to hear you speak.  The date of Magna Charta or    The doings of the Dutch, Or capes, or towns, or verbs, or nouns    Do not excite me much; But when you mention motor rides--    Down by the sea for choice Or chasing games, or chocolates,    I love to hear your voice.    THE BOY WHO RODE INTO THE SUNSET  Once upon a time--it was not so very long ago, either--a little boy, named Neville, lived with his people in a house which was almost in the country. That is to say, it was just at the edge of the city; and at the back of the house was a rather large hill, which was quite bald.  Neville, who was fond of playing by himself, would often wander to the top of the bald hill; and if he stood right on top of it and looked one way, toward the East, he could see right over the city, with all its tall buildings and domes and spires and smoking chimneys. But looking the other way, to the West, he could see for miles over the beautiful country, with its green fields and orchards and white roads and little farm houses.  One evening Neville was playing alone on the top of the hill when he noticed that one of the very finest sunsets he had ever seen was just coming on. The sky in the West, away over the broad country lands, was filled with little clouds of all sorts and shapes, and they were just beginning to take on the most wonderful colours.  Neville had often before amused himself with watching clouds and the strange shapes into which they changed themselves--sometimes like great mountain ranges, sometimes like sea-waves, and very often like elephants and lions and seals and all manner of interesting things of that sort. But never before had he been able to make out so many animal shapes in the clouds. The sky was almost as good as a Zoo. There were kangaroos and elephants and a hen with chickens and wallabies and rabbits and a funny man with large ears and all sorts of other peculiar shapes.  The sun was sinking behind a distant range of hills, where a golden light shone out as if through a gateway. It was so much"]]]
