My mother told us that she was positive he was president of a college.  \"The _melolontha vulgaris_ is the most destructive of beetles, but the larvae are still more injurious.  They do incalculable damage to the farmer.  Fortunately enormous numbers of these grubs are eaten by the birds.\"  \"Unfortunately the birds are not so numerous as they used to be.  They are being destroyed so rapidly, more's the pity!  These grounds and woods yonder were formerly alive with birds of all kinds.  Flocks of the purple grakle used to follow the plow and eat up the worms at a great rate.  You are familiar with their habits?  You know they are most devoted parents.  I have often watched them feeding their young. The little ones have such astonishingly good appetites that it keeps the old folks busy to supply them with enough to eat.  They work like beavers as long as daylight lasts, going to and from the fields carrying on each return trip a fat grub or a toothsome grasshopper.\"  \"I am a great lover of birds,\" returned the professor enthusiastically, \"and I find them very interesting subjects of study.  By the way, I was reading the other day a little incident connected with one of America's great men which impressed me deeply.  The story goes that he was one day walking in company with some noted statesmen, busily engaged in conversation.  But he was not too much occupied to notice that a young bird had fallen from its nest near the path where they were walking. He stopped short and crossing over to where the bird was lying, tenderly picked it up and put it back into its nest.  There was a gentleman of a noble nature!  No wonder that man was a leader and a liberator!\"  \"Who was he?\"  \"The grand, the great Abraham Lincoln,\" responded the professor impressively.  \"Well, he'd be the very one to do just such a kind deed as that,\" was the colonel's hearty response.  \"No man ever lived who had a bigger, more merciful heart than 'Honest Abe.'\"  For myself I did not know who Abraham Lincoln was.  I had never heard the name before, but I was quite sure from the proud tone of the professor's voice that he was a distinguished man, as I was equally sure from the story of his pity for the helpless bird, that he was a good man.  \"You mentioned the industry of the grakle a moment ago,\" resumed the professor.  \"Do you know that the redwing is equally as useful, and besides he is a delightful singer?    \"The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee.  \"Do you remember that line, colonel?\" and the professor softly whistled a strain in imitation of a bird's note.  \"The services of our little brothers of the air are exceedingly valuable to the horticulturist. And think of the damage done to arboriculture by the woodborers alone were it not for the help given by the birds.  Did you ever notice those borers at work, colonel?  Some writer has well described them as animated gimlets.  They just stick their pointed heads into the bark and turn their bodies around and around and out pours a little stream of sawdust.  The birds would pick off such pests fast enough if people would only give them a chance and not scare them off with shotguns.\"  \"Yes, the birds earn their way, there is no denying it, and he is a very stupid farmer who begrudges them the little corn and wheat they take from the fields.  The account is more than balanced by the good they do.\"  Then the conversation ceased, for the colonel and his friend moved off to inspect the quince bushes.  Pleased by the praises they had bestowed on us for our efforts in cleaning the fruit trees and cornfields of injurious insects, I went to work with new vigor to get out some bugs for my luncheon, and was thus pleasantly employed when a sharp twitter from my mother attracted my attention.  \"Look, children!\" she exclaimed.  \"Here come our young ladies with some company from the city.  Be careful to notice what they have on their heads and then tell me what you think of our sweet, pretty ladies.\"  One of my brothers was swaying lightly on a little swing below me.  I flew down hastily and placed myself on the next bough, where I could also get a good view of the ladies as they strolled toward us.  They were in a very merry mood and each one seemed striving to say something more arousing than her companions.  Miss Dorothy led the way, her arm linked in that of one of the stranger guests.  Then followed the others with Miss Katie and Marian hand in hand in the rear.  They were all very handsomely dressed, and having just returned from a drive had not yet removed their hats.  As they came under the tree where we were perched, which was a favorite spot with Miss Katie, they halted for some time and consequently I had an excellent opportunity to look, as my mother had bidden me.  And what did I see?  I saw six ladies' hats trimmed with dead birds.  Fastened on sidewise, head downward, on one was a magnificent scarlet tanager, his body half concealed by folds of tulle, his fixed eye staring into vacancy.  On another was the head and breast of a beautiful yellow-hammer; it was surmounted by the tall sweeping plumes of the egret, which this bird produces only at breeding time.  Oh, how much joy and beauty the world had lost by that cruel deed!  A third hat had two song sparrows imprisoned in meshes of star-studded lace.  Their blithesome carol had been rudely silenced, their cheer to the world cut short, simply that they might be used for hat trimming.  Of the remaining ones some were as yet unknown to me, but my mother, who had an extensive acquaintance with foreign birds, said that in that strange murderous mixture of millinery, far-away Australia had furnished the filmy feathers of the lyre bird which swept upward from a knot of ribbons, and that the forests of Germany had contributed the pretty green linnet.  Dove's wings and the rosy breast of the grosbeak completed the barbarous display.  How my heart sickened as I gazed at these pleasant, refined, soft-voiced women flaunting the trophies of their cruelty in the beautiful sunlight.  Had they no compassion for the feathered mother who had been robbed of her young for the sake of a hat?  \"Oh, how can they do such dreadful, such wicked things!\" I moaned.  My mother heard my lament and signaled for us to come up where she was perching.  \"You see now who are our worst enemies,\" said she.  \"The cat preys on us to satisfy his bodily hunger, but women have no such excuse.  We are not slaughtered to sustain their lives but to minister to their vanity. For years the women of Christian lands have waged their unholy war against us.  We have been driven from our old haunts and forced to seek new places.  We have been shot down by thousands every season until now many species are destroyed from the face of the earth.  There is no security for us in any place.  The hunter with his gun penetrates into the deepest forests, he perils his life in scaling the most dangerous cliffs, he wades through bog and marsh and mud and tracks us to our feeding grounds to surprise us with the deadly shot, and kills the mother hovering over the nest of her helpless offspring with as little compunction as if she were a poisonous reptile instead of a melodious joy-giver.  And all this horrible slaughter is for women.\"  I grew feverish with excitement at this terrible arraignment of the \"gentler sex.\"  \"But why are they so cruel?  Why do they do this wicked thing?\" I asked.  \"For the sake of Fashion,\" said my mother.  \"Fashion, what is that?\"  My mother was very patient with me, so when I asked questions she did not put me off by telling me she didn't know, or advise me to fly away and play, or tell me she was busy and couldn't be bothered just then, therefore she now took pains to make me understand.  \"You ask me what is Fashion,\" she began.  \"Well, Fashion is an exacting ruler, a great, tyrannical god who has many, many worshipers, and these he rules with an iron hand.  His followers cannot be induced to do anything contrary to his wishes.  He sits on a high throne from which he dictates to his slaves what they must do.  Often they do the most outrageous things, not because they like to, but because he demands it. He is constantly laying down new laws for their guidance, and some of these laws are so unreasonable and absurd that a part of his followers frequently threaten to rebel.  They do not hold out against him long, for he manages to make it quite unpleasant for those who disobey him or refuse to come under his yoke.\"  \"Has he any men slaves?\" asked my brother.  \"Yes, he has some slaves among men, but the larger number of those who wear his most galling fetters are women.  If he but crooks his little finger these bond-women rush pell-mell in the direction he points. They are thus keen to do his bidding, because each woman who is the first to carry out his rules in her own particular town or neighborhood acquires great distinction in the eyes of the other worshipers.\"  \"His slaves are nearly always rich women, aren't they?\" asked my brother.  \"By no means.  Many of them are poor working women who have to labor hard for a living.  But they will rob themselves of necessities and needed rest to get the means to follow his demands.  Often it takes them a long time to do this, and perhaps just as they have accomplished the weary task he suddenly proclaims a new law, and all this toiling and drudging and stinting must begin over again.  In this way the unhappy creatures have never a breathing spell.  It is utterly impossible for them to conform to the new law when it is first proclaimed by the god, and so they are always struggling to keep up. Their chains are never lifted or lightened a particle.\"  \"If the chain is so heavy why don't they break it?\" I asked impatiently.  \"Because they are afraid,\" she replied.  \"Afraid of the god?\"  \"No, no, child, they are afraid of each other.  They are afraid the richer slaves, who are able to comply with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],["title","Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#3)"],["body","will laugh at them and ridicule them, and that is why they strain every nerve to follow the god's wishes.  A slave, whether she is rich or poor, grows more cringing year by year, until at last she loses all her individuality, and becomes a mere echo of the god.\"  \"What about the slaves who rebel at first and afterward yield?\"  \"Oh, they denounce the god very severely when he lays down some new law they don't happen to like, but as all the other slaves are obediently complying with it they dislike to be set off by themselves as different, and so they reluctantly give in after a time.  Sometimes they try to compromise with the god by going half-way.\"  I inquired what the other slaves thought of that.  \"They mildly tolerate them,\" said she.  \"Sometimes they look askance at them when they meet, and try to show their superiority as being obedient, full-blooded, genuine slaves, while the others are only lukewarm servants of the monarch!\"  I wondered how the slaves regarded the woman who was independent and wouldn't worship the god.  My mother twittered softly at my question, and I knew she was smiling to herself.  \"Why,\" said she, \"they call that kind of a woman a crank--whatever that is.\"  It was very evident that this god Fashion was a cruel tyrant, and it was clearly through his influence that we were killed, and I so told my mother.  She looked very sorrowful as she replied:  \"Yes, the women do not hate us.  They do not dislike to hear our pretty songs; they have no revenge to gratify; but the god orders them to have us killed, and they do it.  He tells them that to wear our poor mutilated dead bodies will add to their appearance, and so we are sacrificed on the altar of their vanity and silly pride.  As members of humane societies women have denounced the docking of horses' tails as cruel, but from what I know of woman's indifference to the sufferings of the innocent birds, I venture to assert that were Fashion to say that she should trim her cloak with horse tails there would not be left an undocked horse in the country.\"  I knew my mother was very excited or she would never have been so vehement.  \"Just hear how those birds twitter,\" remarked one of the ladies, looking up into our tree.  \"One would think they were holding an indignation meeting over something.\"  \"Yes, the dear little things; I love to hear them chirp,\" commented Miss Katie, turning a sweet glance toward us, and then the party moved to go and we saw the six hats loaded with their mournful freight file off to the house.  We followed the retreating hats with sad eyes till they were lost to view.  My brother broke the silence by asking, \"Are there any Christian women who wear birds, and are among the god's worshipers?\"  My mother's manner grew very grave and solemn.  \"That is not for me to say,\" she replied.  \"They know whether they are guiltless of our wholesale slaughter, and they know too, how the gentle, merciful Christ regarded us when he declared that 'not a sparrow is forgotten before God.'\"     CHAPTER IV  DICKEY'S COUSINS  Another of my airy creatures breathes such sweet music out of her little instrumental throat that it might make mankind to think that miracles are not ceased.  We might well be lifted up above the earth and say, Lord, what music hast thou provided for the saints in heaven, when thou affordest bad men such music on earth?--_Izaak Walton._   The fine pasture adjoining was a popular resort for some handsome birds that often visited it as a playground.  They were said to be relatives of ours, but I do not think they were closer than seventh or eighth cousins, which is so distant that it doesn't count--especially if one doesn't want it to.  All I know is that their family name was the same as ours, _Icteridae_, and means something or other, I forget what.  It was a good honorable name, however, and our branch was as proud of our ancestry as any Daughter of the American Revolution could possibly be.  There were some tall weeds growing along the margin of a little stream in the pasture which produced quantities of delicious seeds, and to these we often repaired when we wanted a choice breakfast, as well as to watch the playful pastimes of these queer bipeds.  What would you think of a bird taking a bareback ride on a cow?   They were extremely fond of settling themselves on the cattle which browsed in the field and presented a truly comical picture as they complacently gathered in little groups on the backs of those huge animals.  Moving slowly along munching the dewy grass, first on one side, then on the other, the cows did not seem particularly to mind their saucy bareback riders.  Occasionally they would toss their heads backward, when up all the birds would fly into the air only to descend again as soon as the cattle were quiet.  As I said, they were very handsome.  At a short distance they looked to be clothed in black, but the breast and neck were really a very rich brown, with the rest of the body like jet and as lustrous as satin. They were not general favorites with the other birds on account of some dishonorable tricks which they did on the sly.  For instance, they never troubled themselves to make nests, but watched their chance to sneak in and lay their eggs, only one in a place, in the nests of other birds.  For some reason their eggs always hatch a little sooner than the eggs rightfully belonging there, consequently the foster-parents, not knowing of the deception, are quite delighted with the first little one that comes out of the shell, and immediately fly off to get food for it.  This is very unfortunate, for during their absence their own eggs get cold and will not hatch.  After a time the old birds grow disgusted and tumble the poor eggs all out of the nest and bestow their whole attention to the juvenile cowbird, entirely ignorant of the fact that they are the victims of a \"put-up job.\"  Once when we were dining in the pasture we found out the cause of the booming noise we had often heard sounding through the woods.  Two men, each carrying in his hand a long club, shaped large at one end, appeared in the meadow and began looking among the long grasses which sheltered the nests of some meadow larks.  A number of the larks were on the wing, others sat on the rail fence rolling out cadenzas in concert in a gush of melody from their downy throats.  The men moved cautiously nearer under cover of the weeds.  Raising their long clubs to their shoulders they gazed along their narrow points a moment. Without exactly knowing why, we took alarm, and larks, bobolinks, and cowbirds sped upward like the wind.  At the same instant something bright shimmered in the sunlight, and with it a horrid burst of noise and a puff of smoke.  We did not all get away, for some of the beautiful larks fell to the ground pierced by the sportsman's deadly hail.  Again and again, all through that long, sad day we heard the ominous booming crash, and knew the savage work of killing was going on.  Among our acquaintances was a lame redbird who at one time had been trapped and made a prisoner, confined behind the bars of a wire cell for many weeks and months.  Luckily he made his escape one day when his grated door was accidentally opened, and he speedily made his way back to his dearly loved forest.  During the period of his imprisonment in the city he had picked up a great deal of information regarding the bird trade, and some of the facts recited by him of the terrible cruelties perpetrated and the carnage which had been going on for years, almost caused our feathers to stand upright in horror as we listened.     CHAPTER V  \"DON'T, JOHNNY\"    Farewell happy fields, where Joy forever dwells.           --_Milton._   A very pleasant, sociable fellow was this redbird, and often when on hot afternoons we were hiding in the treetops from the rays of the sun he told us stories and anecdotes about the people he had seen while he lived in the city.  He and his brother had been caught in a trap in the woods set by a farmer's boy.  One cold spring morning when the boy came to look at his trap he was overjoyed to find he had snared two redbirds, and forthwith carried them to the village nearby and sold them to the grocer for five cents apiece, which sum he said he was going to invest in a rubber ball.  As he put the dime into his coat pocket he told the man that one of the birds was named Admiral Dewey and the other Napoleon Bonaparte.  The groceryman agreed that these names were good enough names for anybody, but he thought he'd change Bonaparte's name to Teddy Roosevelt, as being easier to pronounce, and the two birds were accordingly given these titles then and there.  Not having any cage at hand to put them in, the man thought that for a few days the new-comers could share the quarters of an old sparrow he had in the rear end of the store until an extra cage could be procured.  But alas for Teddy Roosevelt!  The very first night he was ignominiously whipped by the spiteful occupant of the cage, who resented having these country visitors thrust into his house without his leave.  Poor Teddy died the next day.  Admiral Dewey stood the battle better than his unfortunate friend, but he too was pecked at in a way so threatening that the groceryman concluded it would be wise to get rid of him immediately.  Because the admiral had not defended himself better from his pet's attack, the grocer regarded him with some disgust.  \"Being as there was two of you and only one of the sparrow, 'pears as if you hadn't much grit,\" he said.  \"I would better take your high-soundin' name away from you and call you something else besides Dewey, if you can't fight.\"  For all the man's censure, the redbird knew that if Teddy Roosevelt had killed the sparrow instead of being killed by it, the grocer would have been much more grieved at the loss, for he had heard him say the sparrow was like one of his family.  The man forgot that the result might have been"]]]
