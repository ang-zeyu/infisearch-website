I think his portrait is very vigorous, and not in the least a skit, whatever he may say.\"  \"Just sit down there a minute, old man,\" said the painter. \"I shall be jolly glad to work from an intelligent model for once. They all want to look like tailors' fashion-plates. Now, I can't change my style; I don't paint in beauty paste, I render what I see--it's like Diderot's old story about the amateur who asked a floral painter to portray a lion. 'With pleasure,' said the artist, 'but you may expect a lion that will be as like a rose as I can make him.'\"  The conversation lasted a long time; it was friendly and technical. Aurelle praised Beltara's painting; Beltara expressed his joy at having found so penetrating and artistic a critic in the midst of so many Philistines.  \"I prefer your opinion to a painter's; it's certainly sincerer. Would you mind turning your profile a bit more towards me? Some months before the war I had two friends in my studio to whom I wished to show a little picture I intended for the _Salon_. 'Yes,' said the younger of them, 'it's all right, but there ought to be a light spot in that corner; your lights are not well balanced.' 'Shut up, you fool,' the other whispered to him, 'that'll make it _really_ good!' Come on, old man, come and look; I think that sketch can be left as it is.\"  Aurelle walked up to the painter, and, cocking his head on one side, looked at the drawing.  \"It's charming,\" he said at last with some reluctance. \"It's charming. There are some delightful touches--all that still life on the table, it might be a Chardin--and I like the background very much indeed.\"  \"Well, old man, I'm glad you like it. Take it back with you when you go on leave and give it to your wife.\"  \"Er--\" sighed Aurelle, \"thank you, _mon capitaine_; it's really very kind of you. Only--you'll think me no end of a fool--you see, if it is to be for my wife, I'd like you to touch up the profile just a little. Of course you understand.\"  And Beltara, who was a decent fellow, adorned his friend's face with the Grecian nose and the small mouth which the gods had denied him.     CHAPTER II  DIPLOMACY    \"We are not foreigners; we are English; it is _you_ that are    foreigners.\"--An English Lady Abroad.   When Dr. O'Grady and Aurelle had succeeded, with some difficulty, in obtaining a room from old Madame de Vauclère, Colonel Parker went over to see them and was charmed with the château and the park.  France and England, he said, were the only two countries in which fine gardens were to be found, and he told the story of the American who asked the secret of those well-mown lawns and was answered, \"Nothing is simpler: water them for twelve hundred years.\"  Then he inquired timidly whether he also might not be quartered at the château.  \"It wouldn't do very well, sir; Madame is mortally afraid of new-comers, and she has a right, being a widow, to refuse to billet you.\"  \"Aurelle, my boy, do be a good fellow, and go and arrange matters.\"  After much complaining, Madame de Vauclère consented to put the colonel up: all her sons were officers, and she could not withstand sentimental arguments for very long.  The next day Parker's orderly joined the doctor's in the château kitchen, and together they annexed the fireplace. To make room for their own utensils, they took down a lot of comical little French articles, removed what they saw no use for, put the kettle on, and whistled hymns as they filled the cupboards with tins of boot polish in scientifically graded rows.  After adoring them on the first day, putting up with them on the second, and cursing them on the third, the old cook came up to Aurelle with many lamentations, and dwelt at some length on the sad state of her saucepans; but she found the interpreter dealing with far more serious problems.  Colonel Parker, suddenly realizing that it was inconvenient for the general to be quartered away from his Staff, had decided to transfer the whole H.Q. to the château of Vauclère.  \"Explain to the old lady that I want a very good room for the general, and the billiard-room for our clerks.\"  \"Why, it's impossible, sir; she has no good room left.\"  \"What about her own?\" said Colonel Parker.  Madame de Vauclère, heart-broken, but vanquished by the magic word \"General,\" which Aurelle kept on repeating sixty times a minute, tearfully abandoned her canopied bed and her red damask chairs, and took refuge on the second floor.  Meanwhile the drawing-room with its ancient tapestries was filled with an army of phlegmatic clerks occupied in heaping up innumerable cases containing the history in triplicate of the Division, its men, horses, arms and achievements.  \"Maps\" set up his drawing-board on a couple of arm-chairs; \"Intelligence\" concealed their secrets in an Aubusson boudoir; and the telephone men sauntered about in the dignified, slow, bantering fashion of the British workman. They set up their wires in the park, and cut branches off the oaks and lime trees; they bored holes in the old walls, and, as they wished to sleep near their work they put up tents on the lawns.  The Staff asked for their horses; and the animals were picketed in the garden walks, as the stables were too small. In the garden the Engineers made a dug-out in case of a possible bombardment. The orderlies' football developed a distinct liking for the window-panes of the summer-house. The park assumed the aspect first of a building site and then of a training camp, and new-comers said, \"These French gardens _are_ badly kept!\"  This methodical work of destruction had been going on for about a week when \"Intelligence\" got going.  \"Intelligence\" was represented at the Division by Captain Forbes.  Forbes, who had never yet arrested a real spy, saw potential spies everywhere, and as he was fond of the company of the great, he always made his suspicions a pretext for going to see General Bramble or Colonel Parker. One day he remained closeted for an hour with the colonel, who summoned Aurelle as soon as he had left.  \"Do you know,\" he said to him, \"there are most dangerous things going on here. Two old women are constantly being seen in this château. What the deuce are they up to?\"  \"What do you mean?\" gasped Aurelle. \"This is their house, sir; it's Madame de Vauclère and her maid.\"  \"Well, you go and tell them from me to clear out as soon as possible. The presence of civilians among a Staff cannot be tolerated; the Intelligence people have complained about it, and they are perfectly right.\"  \"But where are they to go to, sir?\"  \"That's no concern of mine.\"  Aurelle turned round furiously and left the room. Coming across Dr. O'Grady in the park, he asked his advice about the matter.  \"Why, doctor, she had a perfect right to refuse to billet us, and from a military point of view we should certainly be better off at Nieppe. She was asked to do us a favour, she grants it, and her kindness is taken as a reason for her expulsion! I can't 'evacuate her to the rear,' as Forbes would say; she'd die of it!\"  \"I should have thought,\" said the doctor, \"that after three years you knew the British temperament better than this. Just go and tell the colonel, politely and firmly, that you refuse to carry out his orders. Then depict Madame de Vauclère's situation in your grandest and most tragic manner. Tell him her family has been living in the château for the last two thousand years, that one of her ancestors came over to England with William the Conqueror, and that her grandfather was a friend of Queen Victoria's. Then the colonel will apologize and place a whole wing at the disposal of your _protégée_.\"  Dr. O'Grady's prescription was carried out in detail by Aurelle with most satisfactory results.  \"You are right,\" said the colonel, \"Forbes is a damned idiot. The old lady can stay on, and if anybody annoys her, let her come to me.\"  \"It's all these servants who are such a nuisance to her, sir,\" said Aurelle. \"It's very painful for her to see her own house turned upside-down.\"  \"Upside-down?\" gasped the colonel. \"Why, the house is far better kept than it was in her time. I have had the water in the cisterns analysed; I have had sweet-peas planted and the tennis lawn rolled. What can she complain of?\"  In the well-appointed kitchen garden, where stout-limbed pear trees bordered square beds of sprouting lettuce, Aurelle joined O'Grady.  \"Doctor, you're a great man, and my old lady is saved. But it appears she ought to thank her lucky stars for having placed her under the British Protectorate, which, in exchange for her freedom, provides her with a faultless tennis lawn and microbeless water.\"  \"There is nothing,\" said the doctor gravely, \"that the British Government is not ready to do for the good of the natives.\"     CHAPTER III  THE TOWER OF BABEL    \"Des barques romaines, disais-je.--Non, disais-tu,    portugaises.\"--Jean Giraudoux.   \"Wot you require, sir,\" interrupted Private Brommit, \"is a glass o' boilin' 'ot milk an' whisky, with lots o' cinnamon.\"  Aurelle, who was suffering from an attack of influenza, was at Estrées, under the care of Dr. O'Grady, who tirelessly prescribed ammoniated quinine.  \"I say, doctor,\" said the young Frenchman, \"this is a drug that's utterly unknown in France. It seems strange that medicines should have a nationality.\"  \"Why shouldn't they?\" said the doctor. \"Many diseases are national. If a Frenchman has a bathe after a meal, he is stricken with congestion of the stomach and is drowned. An Englishman never has congestion of the stomach.\"  \"No,\" said Aurelle; \"he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30596"],["title","General Bramble (#2)"],["body"," drowned all the same, but his friends say he had cramp, and the honour of Britain is saved.\"  Private Brommit knocked at the door and showed in Colonel Parker, who sat down by the bed and asked Aurelle how he was getting on.  \"He is much better,\" said the doctor; \"a few more doses of quinine----\"  \"I am glad to hear that,\" replied the colonel, \"because I shall want you, Aurelle. G.H.Q. is sending me on a mission for a fortnight to one of your Brittany ports; I am to organize the training of the Portuguese Division. I have orders to take an interpreter with me. I thought of you for the job.\"  \"But,\" Aurelle put in, \"I don't know a word of Portuguese.\"  \"What does that matter?\" said the colonel. \"You're an interpreter, aren't you? Isn't that enough?\"    *  *  *  *  *  The following day Aurelle told his servant to try and find a Portuguese in the little town of Estrées.  \"Brommit is an admirable fellow,\" said Colonel Parker, \"he found whisky for me in the middle of the bush, and quite drinkable beer in France. If I say to him, 'Don't come back without a Portuguese,' he is sure to bring one with him, dead or alive.\"  As a matter of fact, that very evening he brought back with him a nervous, talkative little man.  \"Ze Poortooguez in fifteen days,\" exclaimed the little man, gesticulating freely with his small plump hands \"A language so rich, so flexible, in fifteen days! Ah, you have ze luck, young man, to 'ave found in zis town Juan Garretos, of Portalègre, Master of Arts of ze University of Coimbra, and positivist philosopher. Ze Poortooguez in fifteen days! Do you know at least ze Low Latin? ze Greek? ze Hebrew? ze Arabic? ze Chinese? If not, it is useless to go furzer.\"  Aurelle confessed his ignorance.  \"Never mind,\" said Juan Garretos indulgently; \"ze shape of your 'ead inspire me wiz confidence: for ten francs ze hour I accept you. Only, mind, no chattering; ze Latins always talk too much. Not a single word of ze English between us now. _Faz favor d'fallar Portuguez_--do me ze favour of speaking ze Poortooguez. Know first zat, in ze Poortooguez, one speak in ze zird person. You must call your speaker Excellency.'\"  \"What's that?\" Aurelle interrupted. \"I thought you had just had a democratic revolution.\"  \"Precisely,\" said the positivist philosopher, wringing his little hands, \"precisely. In France you made ze revoluçaoung in order zat every man should be called 'citizen.' What a waste of energy! In Poortugal we made ze revoluçaoung in order zat every man should be called 'His Highness.' Instead of levelling down we levelled up. It is better. Under ze old order ze children of ze poor were _rapachos_, and zose of ze aristocracy were _meninos_: now zey are all _meninos_. Zat is a revoluçaoung! _Faz favor d'fallar Portuguez._ Ze Latins always talk too much.\"  Having thus earned his ten francs by an hour's unceasing eloquence, he made a fairer proposal to Aurelle next day.  \"I will arrange with you for a fixed sum,\" he said. \"If I teach you two souzand words, you give me fifty francs.\"  \"Very well,\" replied Aurelle, \"two thousand words will be a sufficient vocabulary to begin with.\"  \"All right,\" said Juan Garretos; \"now listen to me. All ze words which in ze English end with 'tion' are ze same in ze Poortooguez wiz ze ending 'çaoung.' Revolution--_revoluçaoung_; constitution--_constituçaoung_; inquisition--_inquisiçaoung_. Now zere are in ze English two souzand words ending in 'tion.' Your Excellency owes me fifty francs. _Faz favor d'fallar Portuguez._\"    *  *  *  *  *  A fortnight later Colonel Parker and Aurelle stepped on to the platform at B----, where they were met by Major Baraquin, the officer commanding the garrison, and Captain Pereira, the Portuguese liaison officer.  Major Baraquin was a very old soldier. He had seen service--in the 1870 campaign. All strangers, Allies included, inspired him with a distrust which even his respect for his superiors failed to remove. When the French War Office ordered him to place his barracks at the disposal of a British colonel, discipline required him to obey, but hostile memories inspired him with savage resistance.  \"After all, sir,\" said Aurelle to Parker, \"his grandfather was at Waterloo.\"  \"Are you quite sure,\" asked the colonel, \"that he was not there himself?\"  Above all things, Major Baraquin would never admit that the armies of other nations might have different habits from his own. That the British soldier should eat jam and drink tea filled him with generous indignation.  \"The colonel,\" Aurelle translated, \"requests me to ask you ...\"  \"No, no, _no_,\" replied Major Baraquin in stentorian tones, without troubling to listen any further.  \"But it will be necessary, sir, for the Portuguese who are going to land....\"  \"No, no, _no_, I tell you,\" Major Baraquin repeated, resolved upon ignoring demands which he considered subversive and childish. This refrain was as far as he ever got in his conversations with Aurelle.    *  *  *  *  *  Next day several large British transports arrived, and disgorged upon the quay thousands of small, black-haired men who gazed mournfully upon the alien soil. It was snowing, and most of them were seeing snow for the first time in their lives. They wandered about in the mud, shivering in their spotted blue cotton uniforms and dreaming, no doubt, of sunny Alemtejo.  \"They'll fight well,\" said Captain Pereira, \"they'll fight well. Wellington called them his fighting cocks, and Napoleon said his Portuguese legion made the best troops in the world. But can you wonder they are sad?\"  Each of them had brought with him a pink handkerchief containing his collection of souvenirs--little reminders of his village, his people, or his best girl--and when they were told that they could not take their pink parcels with them to the front, there was a heart-breaking outcry.  Major Baraquin, with unconscious and sinister humour, had quartered them in the shambles.  \"It would be better----\" began Colonel Parker.  \"Il vaudrait peut-être mieux----\" Aurelle attempted to translate.  \"Vossa Excellencia----\" began Captain Pereira.  \"No, no, _no_,\" said the old warrior passionately.  The Portuguese went to the shambles.     CHAPTER IV  A BUSINESS MAN IN THE ARMY    \"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable    one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore    all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\"--G. B. Shaw (in    _A Revolutionist's Handbook_).   Colonel Musgrave of the R.A.S.C. had been instructed to superintend the supply and transport arrangements of the Portuguese Division, and Lieutenant Barefoot, in charge of a Labour Company, had been detailed to assist him.  \"These men,\" he explained to Colonel Musgrave, \"are all Southampton dockers. In peace time I am their employer, and Sergeant Scott over there is their foreman. They tell me your Labour Companies have often shown rather poor discipline. There's no fear of anything like that with my men; they have been chosen with care, and look up to me as if I were a king. Scott, my sergeant, can do anything; neither he nor my men ever drink a drop. As for me, I am a real business man, and I intend to introduce new methods into the army.\"  Barefoot was fifty years old; he had a bald head shaped like an egg. He had just enlisted to serve his King and country, and was overflowing with goodwill.  The next morning twenty of his men were dead-drunk, two were absent at roll-call, and Sergeant Scott had a scar on his nose which seemed to be the result of a somewhat sudden encounter with mother earth.  \"No matter,\" said the worthy N.C.O., \"Barefoot is an ass, and never notices anything.\"  Next day the first batch of Portuguese troops arrived. British tugs towed the huge transports round the tiny harbour with graceful ease, and the decks seethed with masses of troops. The harbour captain and the _Ponts et Chaussées_ engineer were loud in protest against these wonders, as being \"contrary to the ideas of the Service.\" The wharves were filled with motor lorries, mountains of pressed hay, sacks of oats and boxes of biscuits.  Colonel Musgrave, who was to take charge of this treasure-store, began to make his plan of campaign.  \"To-morrow, Friday,\" he said, \"there will be a parade on the wharf at 7 a.m. I shall hold an inspection myself before work is begun.\"  On Friday morning at seven, Barefoot, his labourers and the lorries were all paraded on the wharf in excellent order. At eight the colonel got up, had his bath and shaved. Then he partook of eggs and bacon, bread and jam, and drank two cups of tea. Towards nine o'clock his car took him to the wharf. When he saw the men standing motionless, the officer saluting and the lorries all in a row, his face went as red as a brick, and he stood up in his car and addressed them angrily:  \"So you are incapable of the slightest initiative! If I am absent for an hour, detained by more important work, everything comes to a standstill! I see I cannot rely on anyone here except myself!\"  The same evening he called the officers together.  \"To-morrow, Saturday,\" he said, \"there will be a parade at 7 a. m.--and this time I shall be there.\"  The next morning Barefoot with his men and lorries paraded once more on the wharf, with a sea-wind sweeping an icy rain into their faces. At half-past seven the lieutenant took action.  \"We will start work,\" he said. \"The colonel was quite right yesterday and spoke like a real business man. In our respect for narrow formalism, we stupidly wasted a whole morning's work.\"  So his men began to pile up the cases, the lorries started to move the sacks of oats, and the day's work was pretty well advanced when Colonel Musgrave appeared. Having had his bath and shaved, and absorbed poached eggs on toast, bread, marmalade and three cups of tea, he had not been able to be ready before ten. Suddenly coming upon all this healthy bustle, he leaped out of his car, and angrily addressed the eager Barefoot, who was"]]]
