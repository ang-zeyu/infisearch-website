When the door finally, splinteringly gave way, he stumbled clear across the room beyond, fetched up against an instrument console, recovered his balance, and gaped.  The operator lay on the floor, swearing in a steady monotone. He had been efficiently bound with his own blouse and trousers, which revealed his predilection for maroon shorts with zebra stripes. There was a lump on the back of his head, and a hammer lay close by. Ellen must have stolen the tool and come in here with the thing behind her back. The operator would have had no reason to suspect her.  She had not left the sender's chair, not even while the door was under attack. Only a carrier beam connected the Sword with the _Altair_. She continued doggedly to fumble with dials and switches, trying to modulate it and raise the ship.  \"Praises be ... you haven't had advanced training ... in radio,\" Blades choked. \"That's ... a long-range set ... pretty special system--\" He weaved toward her. \"Come along, now.\"  She spat an unladylike refusal.  Theoretically, Blades should have enjoyed the tussle that followed. But he was in poor shape at the outset. And he was a good deal worse off by the time he got her pinioned.  \"O.K.,\" he wheezed. \"Will you come quietly?\"  She didn't deign to answer, unless you counted her butting him in the nose. He had to yell for help to frog-march her aboard ship.         *       *       *       *       *  \"_Pallas Castle_ calling NASS _Altair_. Come in, _Altair_.\"  The great ovoid swung clear in space, among a million cold stars. The asteroid had dwindled out of sight. A radio beam flickered across emptiness. Within the hull, the crew and a hundred refugees sat jammed together. The air was thick with their breath and sweat and waiting.  Blades and Chung, seated by the transmitter, felt another kind of thickness, the pull of the internal field. Earth-normal weight dragged down every movement; the enclosed cabin began to feel suffocatingly small. _We'd get used to it again pretty quickly,_ Blades thought. _Our bodies would, that is. But our own selves, tied down to Earth forever--no._  The vision screen jumped to life. \"NASS _Altair_ acknowledging _Pallas Castle_,\" said the uniformed figure within.  \"O.K., Charlie, go outside and don't let anybody else enter,\" Chung told his own operator.  The spaceman gave him a quizzical glance, but obeyed. \"I wish to report that evacuation of the Sword is now complete,\" Chung said formally.  \"Very good, sir,\" the Navy face replied. \"I'll inform my superiors.\"  \"Wait, don't break off yet. We have to talk with your captain.\"  \"Sir? I'll switch you over to--\"  \"None of your damned chains of command,\" Blades interrupted. \"Get me Rear Admiral Hulse direct, toot sweet, or I'll eat out whatever fraction of you he leaves unchewed. This is an emergency. I've got to warn him of an immediate danger only he can deal with.\"  The other stared, first at Chung's obvious exhaustion, then at the black eye and assorted bruises, scratches, and bites that adorned Blades' visage. \"I'll put the message through Channel Red at once, sir.\" The screen blanked.  \"Well, here we go,\" Chung said. \"I wonder how the food in Rehab is these days.\"  \"Want me to do the talking?\" Blades asked. Chung wasn't built for times as hectic as the last few hours, and was worn to a nubbin. He himself felt immensely keyed up. He'd always liked a good fight.  \"Sure.\" Chung pulled a crumpled cigarette from his pocket and began to fill the cabin with smoke. \"You have a larger stock of rudeness than I.\"  [Illustration]  Presently the screen showed Hulse, rigid at his post on the bridge. \"Good day, gentlemen,\" he said. \"What's the trouble?\"  \"Plenty,\" Blades answered. \"Clear everybody else out of there; let your ship orbit free a while. And seal your circuit.\"  Hulse reddened. \"Who do you think you are?\"  \"Well, my birth certificate says Michael Joseph Blades. I've got some news for you concerning that top-secret gadget you told us about. You wouldn't want unauthorized personnel listening in.\"  Hulse leaned forward till he seemed about to fall through the screen. \"What's this about a hazard?\"  \"Fact. The _Altair_ is in distinct danger of getting blown to bits.\"  \"Have you gone crazy? Get me the captain of the _Pallas_.\"  \"Very small bits.\"  Hulse compressed his lips. \"All right, I'll listen to you for a short time. You had better make it worth my while.\"  He spoke orders. Blades scratched his back while he waited for the bridge to be emptied and wondered if there was any chance of a hot shower in the near future.  \"Done,\" said Hulse. \"Give me your report.\"  Blades glanced at the telltale. \"You haven't sealed your circuit, admiral.\"  Hulse said angry words, but complied. \"Now will you talk?\"  \"Sure. This secrecy is for your own protection. You risk court-martial otherwise.\"  Hulse suppressed a retort.         *       *       *       *       *  \"O.K., here's the word.\" Blades met the transmitted glare with an almost palpable crash of eyeballs. \"We decided, Mr. Chung and I, that any missile rig as haywire as yours represents a menace to navigation and public safety. If you can't control your own nuclear weapons, you shouldn't be at large. Our charter gives us local authority as peace officers. By virtue thereof and so on and so forth, we ordered certain precautionary steps taken. As a result, if that war head goes off, I'm sorry to say that NASS _Altair_ will be destroyed.\"  \"Are you ... have you--\" Hulse congealed. In spite of everything, he was a competent officer, Blades decided. \"Please explain yourself,\" he said without tone.  \"Sure,\" Blades obliged. \"The Station hasn't got any armament, but trust the human race to juryrig that. We commandeered the scoopships belonging to this vessel and loaded them with Jovian gas at maximum pressure. If your missile detonates, they'll dive on you.\"  Something like amusement tinged Hulse's shocked expression. \"Do you seriously consider that a weapon?\"  \"I seriously do. Let me explain. The ships are orbiting free right now, scattered through quite a large volume of space. Nobody's aboard them. What is aboard each one, though, is an autopilot taken from a scooter, hooked into the drive controls. Each 'pilot has its sensors locked onto your ship. You can't maneuver fast enough to shake off radar beams and mass detectors. You're the target object, and there's nothing to tell those idiot computers to decelerate as they approach you.  \"Of course, no approach is being made yet. A switch has been put in every scooter circuit, and left open. Only the meteorite evasion units are operative right now. That is, if anyone tried to lay alongside one of those scoopships, he'd be detected and the ship would skitter away. Remember, a scoopship hasn't much mass, and she does have engines designed for diving in and out of Jupe's gravitational well. She can out-accelerate either of our vessels, or any boat of yours, and out-dodge any of your missiles. You can't catch her.\"  Hulse snorted. \"What's the significance of this farce?\"  \"I said the autopilots were switched off at the moment, as far as heading for the target is concerned. But each of those switches is coupled to two other units. One is simply the sensor box. If you withdraw beyond a certain distance, the switches will close. That is, the 'pilots will be turned on if you try to go beyond range of the beams now locked onto you. The other unit we've installed in every boat is an ordinary two-for-a-dollar radiation meter. If a nuclear weapon goes off, anywhere within a couple of thousand kilometers, the switches will also close. In either of those cases, the scoopships will dive on you.  \"You might knock out a few with missiles, before they strike. Undoubtedly you can punch holes in them with laser guns. But that won't do any good, except when you're lucky enough to hit a vital part. Nobody's aboard to be killed. Not even much gas will be lost, in so short a time.  \"So to summarize, chum, if that rogue missile explodes, your ship will be struck by ten to twenty scoopships, each crammed full of concentrated Jovian air. They'll pierce that thin hull of yours, but since they're already pumped full beyond the margin of safety, the impact will split them open and the gas will whoosh out. Do you know what Jovian air does to substances like magnesium?  \"You can probably save your crew, take to the boats and reach a Commission base. But your nice battleship will be _ganz kaput_. Is your game worth that candle?\"  \"You're totally insane! Releasing such a thing--\"  \"Oh, not permanently. There's one more switch on each boat, connected to the meteorite evasion unit and controlled by a small battery. When those batteries run down, in about twenty hours, the 'pilots will be turned off completely. Then we can spot the scoopships by radar and pick 'em up. And you'll be free to leave.\"  \"Do you think for one instant that your fantastic claim of acting legally will stand up in court?\"  \"No, probably not. But it won't have to. Obviously you can't make anybody swallow your yarn if a _second_ missile gets loose. And as for the first one, since it's failed in its purpose, your bosses aren't going to want the matter publicized. It'd embarrass them to no end, and serve no purpose except revenge on Jimmy and me--which there's no point in taking, since the Sword would still be privately owned. You check with Earth, admiral, before shooting off your mouth. They'll tell you that both parties to this quarrel had better forget about legal action. Both would lose.  \"So I'm afraid your only choice is to find that missile before it goes off.\"  \"And yours? What are your alternatives?\" Hulse had gone gray in the face, but he still spoke stoutly.  Blades grinned at him. \"None whatsoever. We've burned our bridges. We can't do anything about those scoopships now, so it's no use trying to scare us or arrest us or whatever else may occur to you."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3098"],["title","The Paths of Inland Commerce; A Chronicle of Trail, Road, and Waterway (#0)"],["body","***  The Paths of Inland Commerce  By Archer B.

The author of such a novel will find a rich fund of material in the perpetual rivalries of pack-horseman and wagoner, of riverman and canal boatman, of steamboat promoter and railway capitalist. He will find at every point the old jostling and challenging the new: pack-horsemen demolishing wagons in the early days of the Alleghany traffic; wagoners deriding Clinton's Ditch; angry boatmen anxious to ram the paddle wheels of Fulton's Clermont, which threatened their monopoly. Such opposition has always been an incident of progress; and even in this new country, receptive as it was to new ideas, the Washingtons, the Fitches, the Fultons, the Coopers, and the Whitneys, who saw visions and dreamed dreams, all had to face scepticism and hostility from those whom they would serve.

The Man Who Caught the Vision  Inland America, at the birth of the Republic, was as great a mystery to the average dweller on the Atlantic seaboard as the elephant was to the blind men of Hindustan. The reports of those who had penetrated this wilderness--of those who had seen the barren ranges of the Alleghanies, the fertile uplands of the Unakas, the luxuriant blue-grass regions, the rich bottom lands of the Ohio and Mississippi, the wide shores of the inland seas, or the stretches of prairie increasing in width beyond the Wabash--seemed strangely contradictory, and no one had been able to patch these reports together and grasp the real proportions of the giant inland empire that had become a part of the United States. It was a pathless desert; it was a maze of trails, trodden out by deer, buffalo, and Indian. Its great riverways were broad avenues for voyagers and explorers; they were treacherous gorges filled with the plunder of a million floods. It was a rich soil, a land of plenty; the natives were seldom more than a day removed from starvation. Within its broad confines could dwell a great people; but it was as inaccessible as the interior of China. It had a great commercial future; yet its gigantic distances and natural obstructions defied all known means of transportation.  Such were the varied and contradictory stories told by the men who had entered the portals of inland America. It is not surprising, therefore, that theories and prophecies about the interior were vague and conflicting nor that most of the schemes of statesmen and financiers for the development of the West were all parts and no whole. They all agreed as to the vast richness of that inland realm and took for granted an immense commerce therein that was certain to yield enormous profits. In faraway Paris, the ingenious diplomat, Silas Deane, writing to the Secret Committee of Congress in 1776, pictured the Old Northwest--bounded by the Ohio, the Alleghanies, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi--as paying the whole expense of the Revolutionary War. ¹ Thomas Paine in 1780 drew specifications for a State of from twenty to thirty millions of acres lying west of Virginia and south of the Ohio River, the sale of which land would pay the cost of three years of the war. ² On the other hand, Pelatiah Webster, patriotic economist that he was, decried in 1781 all schemes to \"pawn\" this vast westward region; he likened such plans to \"killing the goose that laid an egg every day, in order to tear out at once all that was in her belly.\" He advocated the township system of compact and regular settlement; and he argued that any State making a cession of land would reap great benefit \"from the produce and trade\" of the newly created settlements.  ¹ Deane's plan was to grant a tract two hundred miles square at the junction of the Ohio and the Mississippi to a company on the condition that a thousand families should be settled on it within seven years. He added that, as this company would be in a great degree commercial, the establishing of commerce at the junction of those large rivers would immediately give a value to all the lands situated on or near them. ² Paine thought that while the new State could send its exports southward down the Mississippi, its imports must necessarily come from the East through Chesapeake Bay because the current of the Mississippi was too strong to be overcome by any means of navigation then known.  There were mooted many other schemes. General Rufus Putnam, for example, advocated the Pickering or \"Army\" plan of occupying the West; he wanted a fortified line to the Great Lakes, in case of war with England, and fortifications on the Ohio and the Mississippi, in case Spain should interrupt the national commerce on these waterways. And Thomas Jefferson theorized in his study over the toy states of Metropotamia and Polypotamia--brought his     ... trees and houses out    And planted cities all about.  But it remained for George Washington, the Virginia planter, to catch, in something of its actual grandeur, the vision of a Republic stretching towards the setting sun, bound and unified by paths of inland commerce. It was Washington who traversed the long ranges of the Alleghanies, slept in the snows of Deer Park with no covering but his greatcoat, inquired eagerly of trapper and trader and herder concerning the courses of the Cheat, the Monongahela, and the Little Kanawha, and who drew from these personal explorations a clear and accurate picture of the future trade routes by which the country could be economically, socially, and nationally united.  Washington's experience had peculiarly fitted him to catch this vision. Fortune had turned him westward as he left his mother's knee. First as a surveyor for Lord Fairfax in the Shenandoah Valley and later, under Braddock and Forbes, in the armies fighting for the Ohio against the French he had come to know the interior as it was known by no other man of his standing. His own landed property lay largely along the upper Potomac and in and beyond the Alleghanies. Washington's interest in this property was very real. Those who attempt to explain his early concern with the West as purely altruistic must misread his numerous letters and diaries. Nothing in his unofficial character shows more plainly than his business enterprise and acumen. On one occasion he wrote to his agent, Crawford, concerning a proposed land speculation: \"I recommend that you keep this whole matter a secret or trust it only to those in whom you can confide. If the scheme I am now proposing to you were known, it might give alarm to others, and by putting them on a plan of the same nature, before we could lay a proper foundation for success ourselves, set the different interests clashing and in the end overturn the whole.\" Nor can it be denied that Washington's attitude to the commercial development of the West was characterized in his early days by a narrow colonial partisanship. He was a stout Virginian; and all stout Virginians of that day refused to admit the pretensions of other colonies to the land beyond the mountains.  But from no man could the shackles of self-interest and provincial rivalry drop more quickly than they dropped from Washington when he found his country free after the close of the Revolutionary War. He then began to consider how that country might grow and prosper. And he began to preach the new doctrine of expansion and unity. This new doctrine first appears in a letter which he wrote to the Marquis de Chastellux in 1783, after a tour from his camp at Newburg into central New York, where he had explored the headwaters of the Mohawk and the Susquehanna: \"I could not help taking a more extensive view of the vast inland navigation of these United States [the letter runs] and could not but be struck by the immense extent and importance of it, and of the goodness of that Providence which has dealt its favors to us with so profuse a hand. Would to God we may have wisdom enough to improve them. I shall not rest contented till I have explored the Western country, and traversed those lines, or great part of them, which have given bounds to a new empire.\"  \"The vast inland navigation of these United States!\" It is an interesting fact that Washington should have had his first glimpse of this vision from the strategic valley of the Mohawk, which was soon to rival his beloved Potomac as an improved commercial route from the seaboard to the West, and which was finally to achieve an unrivaled superiority in the days of the Erie Canal and the Twentieth Century Limited.
