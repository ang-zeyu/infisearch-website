I think he has a clear perception of matters demanding his cognizance, and a nice discrimination of details. As a politician he attaches the utmost importance to _consistency_--and here I differ with him. I think that to be consistent as a politician, is to change with the circumstances of the case. When Calhoun and Webster first met in Congress, the first advocated a protective tariff and the last opposed it. This was told me by Mr. Webster himself, in 1842, when he was Secretary of State; and it was confirmed by Mr. Calhoun in 1844, then Secretary of State himself. Statesmen are the physicians of the public weal; and what doctor hesitates to vary his remedies with the new phases of disease?  When the President had completed the reading of my papers, and during the perusal I observed him make several emphatic nods, he asked me what I wanted. I told him I wanted employment with my pen, perhaps only temporary employment. I thought the correspondence of the Secretary of War would increase in volume, and another assistant besides Major Tyler would be required in his office. He smiled and shook his head, saying that such work would be only temporary indeed; which I construed to mean that even _he_ did not then suppose the war was to assume colossal proportions.  MAY 18TH.--To-day I had another interview with the President. He advised me to see the Secretary of the Treasury without delay; but the Treasury would not answer so well for my Diary.  MAY 19TH.--The Secretary of War sent for me this morning, and said he required more assistance in his correspondence, then increasing daily; but the act of Congress limiting salaries would prevent him from offering me an adequate compensation. He could only name some ten or twelve hundred dollars. I told him my great desire was employment, and facilities to preserve interesting facts for future publication. I was installed at once, with Major Tyler, in the Secretary's own office. It was my duty to open and read the letters, noting briefly their contents on the back. The Secretary would then indicate in pencil marks the answers to be written, which the major and I prepared. These were signed by the Secretary, copied in another room, and mailed. I was happy in the discharge of these duties, and worked assiduously day and night.  MAY 20TH.--Mr. Walker, the Secretary of War, is some forty-seven or eight years of age, tall, thin, and a little bent; not by age, but by study and bad health. He was a successful lawyer, and having never been in governmental employment, is fast working himself down. He has not yet learned how to avoid unnecessary labor; being a man of the finest sensibilities, and exacting with the utmost nicety all due deference to the dignity of his official position. He stands somewhat on ceremony with his brother officials, and accords and exacts the etiquette natural to a sensitive gentleman who has never been broken on the wheel of office. I predict for him a short career. The only hope for his continuance in office is unconditional submission to the President, who, being once Secretary of War of the United States, is familiar with all the wheels of the department. But soon, if I err not, the President will be too much absorbed in the fluctuations of momentous campaigns, to give much of his attention to any one of the departments. Nevertheless Mr. Walker, if he be an apt scholar, may learn much before that day; and Congress may simplify his duties by enacting a uniform mode of filling the offices in the field. The applications now give the greatest trouble; and the disappointed class give rise to many vexations.  MAY 21ST.--Being in the same room with the Secretary, and seen by all his visitors, I am necessarily making many new acquaintances; and quite a number recognize me by my books which they have read. Among this class is Mr. Benjamin, the Minister of Justice, who, to-day, informed me that he and Senator Bayard had been interested, at Washington, in my \"Story of Disunion.\" Mr. Benjamin is of course a Jew, of French lineage, born I believe in Louisiana, a lawyer and politician. His age may be sixty, and yet one might suppose him to be less than forty. His hair and eyes are black, his forehead capacious, his face round and as intellectual as one of that shape can be; and Mr. B. is certainly a man of intellect, education, and extensive reading, combined with natural abilities of a tolerably high order. Upon his lip there seems to bask an eternal smile; but if it be studied, it is not a smile--yet it bears no unpleasing aspect.  MAY 22D.--To-day I had, in our office, a specimen of Mr. Memminger's oratory. He was pleading for an installment of the claims of South Carolina on the Confederacy; and Mr. Walker, always hesitating, argued the other side, merely for delay. Both are fine speakers, with most distinct enunciation and musical voices. The demand was audited and paid, amounting, I believe, to several hundred thousand dollars.  And I heard and saw Mr. Toombs to-day, the Secretary of State. He is a portly gentleman, but with the pale face of the student and the marks of a deep thinker. To gaze at him in repose, the casual spectator would suppose, from his neglect of dress, that he was a planter in moderate circumstances, and of course not gifted with extraordinary powers of intellect; but let him open his mouth, and the delusion vanishes. At the time alluded to he was surrounded by the rest of the cabinet, in our office, and the topic was the policy of the war. He was for taking the initiative, and carrying the war into the enemy's country. And as he warmed with the subject, the _man_ seemed to vanish, and the _genius_ alone was visible. He was most emphatic in the advocacy of his policy, and bold almost to rashness in his denunciations of the merely defensive idea. He was opposed to all delays, as fraught with danger; the enemy were in the field, and their purposes were pronounced. Why wait to see what they meant to do? If we did that, they would not only invade us, but get a permanent foothold on our soil. We must invade or be invaded; and he was for making the war as terrible as possible from the beginning. It was to be no child's play; and nothing could be gained by reliance upon the blunders and forbearance of the Yankees. News had been received of the occupation of Alexandria and Arlington Heights, in Virginia; and if we permitted them to build fortifications there, we should not be able to expel them. He denounced with bitterness the neglect of the authorities in Virginia. The enemy should not have been permitted to cross the Potomac. During the month which had elapsed since the passage of the ordinance in Virginia, nothing had been done, nothing attempted. It was true, the vote on ratification had not been taken; and although that fact might shield the provisional government from responsibility, yet the delay to act was fraught with danger and perhaps irreparable injury. Virginia alone could have raised and thrown across the Potomac 25,000 men, and driven the Yankees beyond the Susquehanna. But she, to avoid responsibility, had been telegraphing Davis to come to the rescue; and if he (Toombs) had been in Davis's place, he would have taken the responsibility.  The Secretary of War well knew how to parry these thrusts; he was not responsible. He was as ultra a man as any; and all he could do was to organize and arm the troops authorized by Congress. Some thirty odd thousand were mustered in already; and at least five thousand volunteers were offering daily. Mr. Toombs said five hundred thousand volunteers ought to be accepted and for the war. We wanted no six or twelve months' men. To this the Secretary replied that the Executive could not transcend the limits prescribed by Congress.  These little discussions were of frequent occurrence; and it soon became apparent that the Secretary of War was destined to be the most important man among the cabinet ministers. His position afforded the best prospect of future distinction--always provided he should be equal to the position, and his administration attended with success. I felt convinced that Toombs would not be long chafing in the cabinet, but that he would seize the first opportunity to repair to the field.  MAY 23D.--To-day the President took the cars for Pensacola, where it had been said everything was in readiness for an assault on Fort Pickens. Military men said it could be taken, and Toombs, I think, said it ought to be taken. It would cost, perhaps, a thousand lives; but is it not the business of war to consume human life? Napoleon counted men as so much powder to be consumed; and he consumed millions in his career of conquest. But still he conquered, which he could not have done without the consumption of life. And is it not better to consume life rapidly, and attain results quickly, than to await events, when all history shows that a protracted war, of immobile armies, always engulfs more men in the grave from camp fevers than usually fall in battle during the most active operations in the field?  To-day I saw Col. Bartow, who has the bearing and eye of a gallant officer. He was attended by a young man named Lamar, of fine open countenance, whom he desired to have as his aid; but the regulations forbid any one acting in that capacity who was not a lieutenant; and Lamar not being old enough to have a commission, he said he would attend the colonel as a volunteer aid till he attained the prescribed age. I saw Ben McCulloch, also--an unassuming but elastic and brave man. He will make his mark. Also Capt. McIntosh, who goes to the West. I think I saw him in 1846, in Paris, at the table of Mr. King, our Minister; but I had no opportunity to ask him. He is all enthusiasm, and will rise with honor or fall with glory. And here I beheld for the first time Wade Hampton, resolved to abandon all the comforts of his great wealth, and encounter the privations of the tented "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31088"],["title","Taxonomy and Distribution of Some American Shrews (#0)"],["body","OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY  Volume 7, No. 14, pp. 613-618  June 10, 1955     Taxonomy and Distribution of Some American Shrews  BY  JAMES S.

Findley   _=Sorex cinereus ohionensis=_ Bole and Moulthrop.--In their description of this subspecies from Ohio, Bole and Moulthrop (1942:89-95) made no mention of specimens in the United States Biological Surveys Collection from Ellsworth and Milford Center, Ohio, which stand in the literature (see Jackson, 1928:49) as _Sorex cinereus cinereus_. These two localities lie south of the geographic range ascribed to _S. c. ohionensis_ by Bole and Moulthrop. Examination of the two specimens, United States Biological Surveys Collection, Catalogue No. 70566, and United States National Museum, No. 19434, respectively, both of which are alcoholics, reveals that they are referable to the subspecies _ohionensis_ rather than to _S. c. cinereus_. This reference is made on the basis of small size, short tail (33 and 31 millimeters, respectively), and fourth upper unicuspid as large as third (the specimen from Milford Center lacks the skull). The occurrence at Milford Center provides a southward extension of known range for _S. c. ohionensis_ of approximately 70 miles. _S. c. cinereus_ seems not to occur in Ohio.  _=Cryptotis micrura=_ (Tomes).--Davis (1944:376) assigned a _Cryptotis_ from Boca del Río, Veracruz, to _Cryptotis parva berlandieri_ (Baird). Comparison of this specimen, Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collections, No. 2765, with 8 specimens of _C. micrura_ from various parts of northern Veracruz and with 9 _C. parva_ from southern Tamaulipas reveals that the shrew from Boca del Río is referable to _Cryptotis micrura_. The series of 8 specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History from Altamira, Tamaulipas, provides the southernmost known record of _Cryptotis parva berlandieri_. These 8 specimens are typical of _C. p. berlandieri_ and show no approach to _C. micrura_. Average and extreme cranial measurements of 7 specimens from 1 mi. S Altamira are: condylobasal length, 15.6 (15.2-16.1); palatal length, 6.6 (6.4-6.7); maxillary tooth-row, 5.7 (5.4-5.8); cranial breadth, 7.6 (7.4-8.0); least interorbital breadth, 3.5 (3.4-3.7); maxillary breadth, 5.0 (4.8-5.2). Cranial measurements of 8 specimens of _C. micrura_ from various localities in northern Veracruz (1 km. E Mecayucan, 1; 7 km. NNW Cerro Gordo, 3; Teocelo, 2; 7 km. W El Brinco, 1; 5 km. N Jalapa, 1) are: condylobasal length, 17.1 (16.6-17.4); palatal length, 7.1 (6.9-7.4); maxillary tooth-row, 6.2 (5.9-6.4); cranial breadth, 8.5 (8.3-8.6); least interorbital breadth, 3.7 (3.6-4.1); maxillary breadth, 5.3 (5.1-5.6). _C. parva_ and _C. micrura_ may intergrade but a distance of 140 miles separates the geographic ranges as now known of the two kinds and every specimen examined by me is clearly referable to one or the other of the two named kinds and shows no evidence of intergradation.  _=Notiosorex crawfordi crawfordi=_ Baird.--A specimen in the Museum of Natural History from Jaumave, and one from Palmillas, Tamaulipas, collected by Gerd Heinrich, provide records of the easternmost margin of the range of this species in Mexico. Assignment is made to the subspecies _crawfordi_ on geographic grounds. The two specimens differ from a male from 13 mi. S and 15 mi. W Guadalajara, Jalisco, referred (Twente and Baker, 1951:121) to _N. c. evotis_ (Coues) in slightly larger size; however two skulls from owl pellets from 21 mi. SW Guadalajara, also referred to _evotis_ (_loc. cit._), seem to me to differ in no important way from skulls of the Tamaulipan specimens. Measurements of the Tamaulipan specimens, both females, 54932 KU and 54933 KU, are respectively: condylobasal length, --, 16.7; palatal length, --, 7.2; maxillary tooth-row, 6.6, 6.1; cranial breadth, 8.3, 8.1; least interorbital breadth, --, 3.5; maxillary breadth, --, 5.1; total length, 90, 90; tail, 28, 30; hind foot, 11.0, 11.5; ear, 8, 8.  The only other eastern Mexican record of _N. crawfordi_ is based on two skulls from owl pellets collected 3 mi. NW Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila (Baker, 1953:253).  _=Sorex oreopolus emarginatus=_ Jackson.--A first-year female _Sorex_, KU 54346, obtained by Rollin H. Baker from 7 mi. SW Las Adjuntas, 8900 ft., Durango, seems closest, among Mexican shrews that I have examined, to two specimens of _S. emarginatus_ from Plateado, 7600 to 8500 ft., Zacatecas. Measurements of the Las Adjuntas specimen are: total length, 88; tail, 39; hind foot, 13; palatal length, 7.2; maxillary tooth-row, 6.4; maxillary breadth, 4.9; least interorbital breadth, 3.6.  _Sorex emarginatus_ previously was known only from Plateado and the type locality, Bolanos, Jalisco. Comparison of these three specimens with specimens of other species of Mexican shrews of the _S. saussurei_ group leads me to conclude that the group contains two species rather than four as was previously thought. _Sorex emarginatus_, _S. ventralis_, and _S. oreopolus_ seem to me to be conspecific. All three nominal species are relatively small, short-tailed shrews. The skulls of the three kinds resemble one another in relatively short rostrum and in dental details. Slight differences in cranial proportions differentiate the three and they should, until more specimens of each are obtained and studied, retain subspecific rank. The specific name, _Sorex oreopolus_ Merriam 1892, should apply to the three kinds since it antedates the names _ventralis_ and _emarginatus_. The two names last given, therefore, should stand as _Sorex oreopolus ventralis_ Merriam and _Sorex oreopolus emarginatus_ Jackson. The two species, the large _S. saussurei_, and the small _S. oreopolus_, as the latter is here understood, occur together over an extensive region in southern Mexico. In other parts of North America a large and a small species of _Sorex_ often occur together in a given area.  The Las Adjuntas specimen was taken only 10 miles southwest of El Salto, Durango, the type locality of _S. durangae_ Jackson. Jackson (1928:101) placed _durangae_ in the _Sorex vagrans-obscurus_ species group, but the two specimens available to him were second year adults with the teeth so much worn that diagnostic characters are not visible on them. I have examined these two specimens (United States Biological Surveys Collection 94539 and 94540) and find that in bodily and cranial proportions they resemble _Sorex s. saussurei_, and I so assign them.  _=Sorex milleri=_ Jackson.--Koestner (1941:10) reported 5 _Sorex_ from Cerro Potosí, near La Jolla, Municipio de Galeana, Nuevo Leon, as _Sorex emarginatus_. Comparison of 4 of these specimens (Chicago Museum of Natural History, 48227, 48228, 48229, 48230) with two _S. emarginatus_ from Plateado, Zacatecas, and specimens of other species of _Sorex_ indicates that the Cerro Potosí shrews differ in many features from _emarginatus_, but closely resemble, in size and cranial characters, a specimen (F. W. Miller, No. 20) of _S. milleri_ from Sierra del Carmen, Coahuila, and seems to be referable to that species which was not named when Koestner (_loc. cit._) recorded his specimen. The range of _S. milleri_ is therefore extended southwestward to western central Nuevo Leon.  Comparison of _S. milleri_ with specimens of other species of North American _Sorex_ leads me to conclude that _S. milleri_ is most closely related to_ S. cinereus_ Kerr, and should be included in the _S. cinereus_ group rather than in the _S. vagrans-obscurus_ group. _Sorex cinereus_ and _S. milleri_ are alike, and both differ from even the smallest _S. vagrans_ in relatively long and narrow rostrum, narrow teeth, smaller skull, and in having the third upper unicuspid more often equal to or smaller than, rather than larger than, the fourth unicuspid.  I judge _S. milleri_ to be a relict population of _S. cinereus_, isolated in the mountains of northeastern Mexico, probably in the late Pleistocene. _Sorex cinereus_ reported from Pleistocene deposits in San Josecito Cave, Nuevo Leon (Findley, 1953:635), probably represents a population ancestral to the modern _S. milleri_. _Sorex milleri_ should retain specific status because of constant cranial differences from _S. cinereus_, particularly relatively broader rostrum.
