His eyes were grey, his forehead was broad, and       his face, even at that early age, clean cut as a cameo, without       being pinched or thin. But perhaps his most attractive point was       his hair, which was pure gold in colour and tightly curled over       his shapely head. He cried a little when his nurse finally tore       herself away and left him with us. Never shall I forget the       scene. There he stood, with the sunlight from the window playing       upon his golden curls, his fist screwed over one eye, whilst he       took us in with the other. I was seated in a chair, and stretched       out my hand to him to induce him to come to me, while Job, in the       corner, was making a sort of clucking noise, which, arguing from       his previous experience, or from the analogy of the hen, he       judged would have a soothing effect, and inspire confidence in       the youthful mind, and running a wooden horse of peculiar       hideousness backwards and forwards in a way that was little short       of inane. This went on for some minutes, and then all of a sudden       the lad stretched out both his little arms and ran to me.        “I like you,” he said: “you is ugly, but you is good.”        Ten minutes afterwards he was eating large slices of bread and       butter, with every sign of satisfaction; Job wanted to put jam on       to them, but I sternly reminded him of the excellent works that       we had read, and forbade it.        In a very little while (for, as I expected, I got my fellowship)       the boy became the favourite of the whole College—where, all       orders and regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, he was       continually in and out—a sort of chartered libertine, in whose       favour all rules were relaxed. The offerings made at his shrine       were simply without number, and I had serious difference of       opinion with one old resident Fellow, now long dead, who was       usually supposed to be the crustiest man in the University, and       to abhor the sight of a child. And yet I discovered, when a       frequently recurring fit of sickness had forced Job to keep a       strict look-out, that this unprincipled old man was in the habit       of enticing the boy to his rooms and there feeding him upon       unlimited quantities of brandy-balls, and making him promise to       say nothing about it. Job told him that he ought to be ashamed of       himself, “at his age, too, when he might have been a grandfather       if he had done what was right,” by which Job understood had got       married, and thence arose the row.        But I have no space to dwell upon those delightful years, around       which memory still fondly hovers. One by one they went by, and as       they passed we two grew dearer and yet more dear to each other.       Few sons have been loved as I love Leo, and few fathers know the       deep and continuous affection that Leo bears to me.        The child grew into the boy, and the boy into the young man,       while one by one the remorseless years flew by, and as he grew       and increased so did his beauty and the beauty of his mind grow       with him. When he was about fifteen they used to call him Beauty       about the College, and me they nicknamed the Beast. Beauty and       the Beast was what they called us when we went out walking       together, as we used to do every day. Once Leo attacked a great       strapping butcher’s man, twice his size, because he sang it out       after us, and thrashed him, too—thrashed him fairly. I walked on       and pretended not to see, till the combat got too exciting, when       I turned round and cheered him on to victory. It was the chaff of       the College at the time, but I could not help it. Then when he       was a little older the undergraduates found fresh names for us.       They called me Charon, and Leo the Greek god! I will pass over my       own appellation with the humble remark that I was never handsome,       and did not grow more so as I grew older. As for his, there was       no doubt about its fitness. Leo at twenty-one might have stood       for a statue of the youthful Apollo. I never saw anybody to touch       him in looks, or anybody so absolutely unconscious of them. As       for his mind, he was brilliant and keen-witted, but not a       scholar. He had not the dulness necessary for that result. We       followed out his father’s instructions as regards his education       strictly enough, and on the whole the results, especially in the       matters of Greek and Arabic, were satisfactory. I learnt the       latter language in order to help to teach it to him, but after       five years of it he knew it as well as I did—almost as well as       the professor who instructed us both. I always was a great       sportsman—it is my one passion—and every autumn we went away       somewhere shooting or fishing, sometimes to Scotland, sometimes       to Norway, once even to Russia. I am a good shot, but even in       this he learnt to excel me.        When Leo was eighteen I moved back into my rooms, and entered him       at my own College, and at twenty-one he took his degree—a       respectable degree, but not a very high one. Then it was that I,       for the first time, told him something of his own story, and of       the mystery that loomed ahead. Of course he was very curious       about it, and of course I explained to him that his curiosity       could not be gratified at present. After that, to pass the time       away, I suggested that he should get himself called to the Bar;       and this he did, reading at Cambridge, and only going up to       London to eat his dinners.        I had only one trouble about him, and that was that every young       woman who came across him, or, if not every one, nearly so, would       insist on falling in love with him. Hence arose difficulties       which I need not enter into here, though they were troublesome       enough at the time. On the whole, he behaved fairly well; I       cannot say more than that.        And so the time went by till at last he reached his twenty-fifth       birthday, at which date this strange and, in some ways, awful       history really begins.     III. THE SHERD OF AMENARTAS         On the day preceding Leo’s twenty-fifth birthday we both       journeyed to London, and extracted the mysterious chest from the       bank where I had deposited it twenty years before. It was, I       remember, brought up by the same clerk who had taken it down. He       perfectly remembered having hidden it away. Had he not done so,       he said, he should have had difficulty in finding it, it was so       covered up with cobwebs.        In the evening we returned with our precious burden to Cambridge,       and I think that we might both of us have given away all the       sleep we got that night and not have been much the poorer. At       daybreak Leo arrived in my room in a dressing-gown, and suggested       that we should at once proceed to business. I scouted the idea as       showing an unworthy curiosity. The chest had waited twenty years,       I said, so it could very well continue to wait until after       breakfast. Accordingly at nine—an unusually sharp nine—we       breakfasted; and so occupied was I with my own thoughts that I       regret to state that I put a piece of bacon into Leo’s tea in       mistake for a lump of sugar. Job, too, to whom the contagion of       excitement had, of course, spread, managed to break the handle       off my Sèvres china tea-cup, the identical one I believe that       Marat had been drinking from just before he was stabbed in his       bath.        At last, however, breakfast was cleared away, and Job, at my       request, fetched the chest, and placed it upon the table in a       somewhat gingerly fashion, as though he mistrusted it. Then he       prepared to leave the room.        “Stop a moment, Job,” I said. “If Mr. Leo has no objection, I       should prefer to have an independent witness to this business,       who can be relied upon to hold his tongue unless he is asked to       speak.”        “Certainly, Uncle Horace,” answered Leo; for I had brought him up       to call me uncle—though he varied the appellation somewhat       disrespectfully by calling me “old fellow,” or even “my avuncular       relative.”        Job touched his head, not having a hat on.        “Lock the door, Job,” I said, “and bring me my despatch-box.”        He obeyed, and from the box I took the keys that poor Vincey,       Leo’s father, had given me on the night of his death. There were       three of them; the largest a comparatively modern key, the second       an exceedingly ancient one, and the third entirely unlike       anything of the sort that we had ever seen before, being       fashioned apparently from a strip of solid silver, with a bar       placed across to serve as a handle, and leaving some nicks cut in       the edge of the bar. It was more like a model of an antediluvian       railway key than anything else.        “Now are you both ready?” I said, as people do when they are       going to fire a mine. There was no answer, so I took the big key,       rubbed some salad oil into the wards, and after one or two bad       shots, for my hands were shaking, managed to fit it, and shoot       the lock. Leo bent over and caught the massive lid in both his       hands, and with an effort, for the hinges had rusted, forced it       back. Its removal revealed another case covered with dust. This       we extracted from the iron chest without any difficulty, and       removed the accumulated filth of years from it with a       clothes-brush.        It was, or appeared to be, of ebony, or some such close-grained       black wood, and was bound in every direction with flat bands of       iron. Its antiquity must have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3155"],["title","She (#5)"],["body","extreme, for the dense heavy       wood was in parts actually commencing to crumble from age.        “Now for it,” I said, inserting the second key.        Job and Leo bent forward in breathless silence. The key turned,       and I flung back the lid, and uttered an exclamation, and no       wonder, for inside the ebony case was a magnificent silver       casket, about twelve inches square by eight high. It appeared to       be of Egyptian workmanship, and the four legs were formed of       Sphinxes, and the dome-shaped cover was also surmounted by a       Sphinx. The casket was of course much tarnished and dinted with       age, but otherwise in fairly sound condition.        I drew it out and set it on the table, and then, in the midst of       the most perfect silence, I inserted the strange-looking silver       key, and pressed this way and that until at last the lock       yielded, and the casket stood before us. It was filled to the       brim with some brown shredded material, more like vegetable fibre       than paper, the nature of which I have never been able to       discover. This I carefully removed to the depth of some three       inches, when I came to a letter enclosed in an ordinary       modern-looking envelope, and addressed in the handwriting of my       dead friend Vincey.        “_To my son Leo, should he live to open this casket._”        I handed the letter to Leo, who glanced at the envelope, and then       put it down upon the table, making a motion to me to go on       emptying the casket.        The next thing that I found was a parchment carefully rolled up.       I unrolled it, and seeing that it was also in Vincey’s       handwriting, and headed, “Translation of the Uncial Greek Writing       on the Potsherd,” put it down by the letter. Then followed       another ancient roll of parchment, that had become yellow and       crinkled with the passage of years. This I also unrolled. It was       likewise a translation of the same Greek original, but into       black-letter Latin, which at the first glance from the style and       character appeared to me to date from somewhere about the       beginning of the sixteenth century. Immediately beneath this roll       was something hard and heavy, wrapped up in yellow linen, and       reposing upon another layer of the fibrous material. Slowly and       carefully we unrolled the linen, exposing to view a very large       but undoubtedly ancient potsherd of a dirty yellow colour! This       potsherd had in my judgment, once been a part of an ordinary       amphora of medium size. For the rest, it measured ten and a half       inches in length by seven in width, was about a quarter of an       inch thick, and densely covered on the convex side that lay       towards the bottom of the box with writing in the later uncial       Greek character, faded here and there, but for the most part       perfectly legible, the inscription having evidently been executed       with the greatest care, and by means of a reed pen, such as the       ancients often used. I must not forget to mention that in some       remote age this wonderful fragment had been broken in two, and       rejoined by means of cement and eight long rivets. Also there       were numerous inscriptions on the inner side, but these were of       the most erratic character, and had clearly been made by       different hands and in many different ages, and of them, together       with the writings on the parchments, I shall have to speak       presently.

I groped about, and produced something hard, done up in a little       linen bag. Out of the bag we took first a very beautiful       miniature done upon ivory, and secondly, a small       chocolate-coloured composition _scarabæus_, marked thus:—  [Illustration]        symbols which, we have since ascertained, mean “Suten se Ra,”       which is being translated the “Royal Son of Ra or the Sun.” The       miniature was a picture of Leo’s Greek mother—a lovely, dark-eyed       creature. On the back of it was written, in poor Vincey’s       handwriting, “My beloved wife.”        “That is all,” I said.        “Very well,” answered Leo, putting down the miniature, at which       he had been gazing affectionately; “and now let us read the       letter,” and without further ado he broke the seal, and read       aloud as follows:—        “My Son Leo,—When you open this, if you ever live to do so, you       will have attained to manhood, and I shall have been long enough       dead to be absolutely forgotten by nearly all who knew me. Yet in       reading it remember that I have been, and for anything you know       may still be, and that in it, through this link of pen and paper,       I stretch out my hand to you across the gulf of death, and my       voice speaks to you from the silence of the grave. Though I am       dead, and no memory of me remains in your mind, yet am I with you       in this hour that you read. Since your birth to this day I have       scarcely seen your face. Forgive me this. Your life supplanted       the life of one whom I loved better than women are often loved,       and the bitterness of it endureth yet. Had I lived I should in       time have conquered this foolish feeling, but I am not destined       to live. My sufferings, physical and mental, are more than I can       bear, and when such small arrangements as I have to make for your       future well-being are completed it is my intention to put a       period to them. May God forgive me if I do wrong. At the best I       could not live more than another year.”        “So he killed himself,” I exclaimed. “I thought so.”        “And now,” Leo went on, without replying, “enough of myself. What       has to be said belongs to you who live, not to me, who am dead,       and almost as much forgotten as though I had never been. Holly,       my friend (to whom, if he will accept the trust, it is my       intention to confide you), will have told you something of the       extraordinary antiquity of your race. In the contents of this       casket you will find sufficient to prove it. The strange legend       that you will find inscribed by your remote ancestress upon the       potsherd was communicated to me by my father on his deathbed, and       took a strong hold in my imagination. When I was only nineteen       years of age I determined, as, to his misfortune, did one of our       ancestors about the time of Elizabeth, to investigate its truth.       Into all that befell me I cannot enter now. But this I saw with       my own eyes. On the coast of Africa, in a hitherto unexplored       region, some distance to the north of where the Zambesi falls       into the sea, there is a headland, at the extremity of which a       peak towers up, shaped like the head of a negro, similar to that       of which the writing speaks. I landed there, and learnt from a       wandering native, who had been cast out by his people because of       some crime which he had committed, that far inland are great       mountains, shaped like cups, and caves surrounded by measureless       swamps. I learnt also that the people there speak a dialect of       Arabic, and are ruled over by a _beautiful white woman_ who is       seldom seen by them, but who is reported to have power over all       things living and dead. Two days after I had ascertained this the       man died of fever contracted in crossing the swamps, and I was       forced by want of provisions and by symptoms of an illness which       afterwards prostrated me to take to my dhow again.        “Of the adventures that befell me after this I need not now       speak. I was wrecked upon the coast of Madagascar, and rescued       some months afterwards by an English ship that brought me to       Aden, whence I started for England, intending to prosecute my       search as soon as I had made sufficient preparations. On my way I       stopped in Greece, and there, for ‘Omnia vincit amor,’ I met your       beloved mother, and married her, and there you were born and she       died. Then it was that my last illness seized me, and I returned       hither to die. But still I hoped against hope, and set myself to       work to learn Arabic, with the intention, should I ever get       better, of returning to the coast of Africa, and solving the       mystery of which the tradition has lived so many centuries in our       family. But I have not got better, and, so far as I am concerned,       the story is at an end.        “For you, however, my son, it is not at an end, and to you I hand       on these the results of my labour, together with the hereditary       proofs of its origin. It is my intention to provide that they       shall not be put into your hands until you have reached an age       when you will be able to judge for yourself whether or no you       will choose to investigate what, if it is true, must be the       greatest mystery in the world, or to put it by as an idle fable,       originating in the first place in a woman’s disordered brain.        “I do not believe that it is a fable; I believe that if it can       only be re-discovered there is a spot where the vital forces of       the world visibly exist. Life exists; why therefore should not       the means of preserving it indefinitely exist also? But I have no       wish to prejudice your mind about the matter. Read and judge for       yourself. If you are inclined to undertake the search, I have so       provided that you will not lack for means. If, on the other hand,       you are"]]]
