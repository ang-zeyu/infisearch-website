BAKER   Forming the northeastern border of Mexico, Tamaulipas extends in an elongated, north-south direction from the Temperate into the Torrid Zone and contains faunal elements from both the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. The mammals are less known than those from some of the bordering states; for the most part collecting has been limited to a few localities, chiefly along the Pan-American Highway. Accordingly, as a step towards a long-range study of the mammals of Tamaulipas, the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas acquired from William J. Schaldach, Jr., a small, but significant, collection of mammals taken in the last month of 1949 and the first four months of 1950.  Collections were made at several places in the vicinity of Ciudad Victoria, including localities along the humid, eastern face of the Sierra Madre Oriental. Many of these specimens were obtained near camps made west of the village of El Carrizo. This small community is on the Pan-American highway, 70 kilometers (by highway) south of Ciudad Victoria. The resulting collections, which are reported upon here, disclose that several tropical mammals range farther northward than previously reported. Funds for financing the field work were made available by a grant from the Kansas University Endowment Association.   ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES  ~Didelphis mesamericana mesamericana~ Oken   Central American Opossum       _Did[elphys] mes-americana_ Oken, Lehrbuch d. Naturgesch.,      pt. 3, vol. 2:1152, 1816. (Type from Northern Mexico.)       _Didelphis mes-americana_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.      Hist., 16:256, August 18, 1902.        _Specimens examined_, 2 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W      Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,      1; 12 km. N and 4 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 1.   ~Philander opossum pallidus~ (Allen)  Four-eyed Opossum       _Metachirus fuscogriseus pallidus_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus.      Nat. Hist., 14:215, July 3, 1901. (Type from Orizaba,      Veracruz, Mexico.)       _Philander opossum pallidus_ Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus.      Zool., Louisiana State Univ., No. 23:2, July 10, 1950.        _Specimens examined_, 3 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.  _Remarks._--These three specimens have proportionately longer tails than typical _P. o. pallidus_ from central Veracruz; total length and length of tail of two adult males are 575, 295, and 568, 290 respectively.  This marsupial has been previously unrecorded from Tamaulipas or from so northward a locality. The four-eyed opossum evidently ranges northward along the east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental within the humid division of the Upper Tropical Life-zone. These animals, all males, were taken in steel traps baited with the bodies of skinned mice or birds. Sets were made along well-used trails leading from a densely vegetated arroyo into a corn field through openings in a fence of roughly piled logs. The elevation of this locality is approximately 2500 feet.   ~Desmodus rotundus murinus~ Wagner  Vampire Bat       _D[esmodus] murinus_ Wagner, Schreber's Säugthiere, Suppl.,      1:377, 1840. (Type from Mexico.)       _Desmodus rotundus murinus_ Osgood, Field Mus. Nat. Hist.,      publ. 155, zool. ser., 10:63, January 10, 1912.       _Specimens examined_, 9 as follows: 12 km. W and 8 km. N      Ciudad Victoria, 2500 ft., 3; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El      Carrizo], 6.  _Remarks._--Vampire bats were taken at two caves. At the cave called \"Los Troncones\", 12 kilometers west and 8 kilometers north of Ciudad Victoria, seven bats were shot down; three were saved. The second cave, south of Ciudad Victoria, was considerably damper than the first. Vampires were found in a small side chamber; nine bats were knocked down. No other kinds of bats were present in either cave.   ~Sylvilagus floridanus connectens~ (Nelson)  Florida Cottontail       _Lepus floridanus connectens_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 17:105, May 18, 1904. (Type from Chichicaxtle,      Veracruz, Mexico.)       _Sylvilagus floridanus connectens_ Lyon and Osgood, Catal.      Type spec. Mamm. U. S. Nat. Mus., Bull. 62:32, January 28,      1909.       _Specimens examined_, 2 from 70 km. [by highway] S. Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.   ~Sciurus aureogaster aureogaster~ F. Cuvier  Red-bellied Squirrel       [_Sciurus_, by implication] _aureogaster_ F. Cuvier, Hist.      nat. mammifères, vol. 6, livr. 59, pl. with text, September,      1829. Binomial published at end of work only, vol. 7, tabl.      generale et méthodique, p. 4, 1842. (Type from \"California\"      = eastern Mexico.)       _Specimens examined_, 13 as follows: 43 km. S Ciudad      Victoria, 1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria, and 6      km. W of [Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo], 3; 70 km.      [by hwy.] S Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 9.  _Remarks._--These colorful squirrels were taken in thick timber and brush, and locally are referred to as \"ardilla pinta\" or \"ardilla colorada.\" One female obtained on January 22 is black. Local hunters state that these squirrels are most active early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Two squirrels were seen in copulation on January 19.   ~Sciurus negligens~ Nelson  Little Gray Squirrel       _Sciurus negligens_ Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,      12:147, June 3, 1898. (Type from Alta Mira, Tamaulipas,      Mexico.)       _Specimens examined_, 17 as follows: 70 km. [by highway] S      of Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway      [at El Carrizo], 5; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria      and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 12.  _Remarks._--Referred to as \"ardilla chica\" locally, these squirrels were most frequently seen in the dense forest of the lower, elevations. Active both in trees and on the ground, these animals were reported as being destructive to corn crops. Females taken in January were lactating.   ~Heterogeomys hispidus concavus~ Nelson and Goldman  Hispid Pocket Gopher       _Heterogeomys hispidus concavus_ Nelson and Goldman, Proc.      Biol. Soc. Washington, 42:148, March 30, 1929. (Type from      Pinal de Amoles, Queretaro, Mexico.)       _Specimens examined_, 5 as follows: 70 km. [by highway] S      Ciudad Victoria and 5 km. W El Carrizo, 4; 70 km. [by      highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 1.  _Remarks._--These gophers have been compared with specimens of _H. h. hispidus_ from Veracruz (5 km. N Jalapa and 4 km. WNW Fortin) and with specimens of _H. h. concavus_ from San Luis Potosí (Xilitla and vicinity and 3 mi. NW Pujal); the latter were examined through the courtesy of Dr. George H. Lowery, Jr., of the Museum of Zoology at Louisiana State University. These five specimens are assigned to _H. h. concavus_ and resemble in every way this subspecies except: slightly smaller, somewhat darker, and skull with lambdoidal crest less inclined forward. In the latter feature, the single skull available seems to resemble most closely that of _H. h. hispidus_. Unfortunately, all but one skull, that of a subadult female, were destroyed in the field.  This is the first known record of this genus in Tamaulipas and the most northern locality from which specimens have been taken. At this latitude, the gopher appears to be restricted to the humid belt on the east face of the Sierra Madre Oriental. These large gophers were difficult to trap by ordinary means; Schaldach got two by using large-sized Macabee traps but the others were taken at night either with the aid of a dog or by natives with slingshots.   ~Liomys irroratus texensis~ Merriam  Spiny Pocket Mouse       _Liomys texensis_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,      15:44, March 5, 1902. (Type from Brownsville, Cameron      County, Texas.)       _Liomys irroratus texensis_ Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:59,      September 7, 1911.       _Specimens examined_, 15 as follows: 7 km. S and 2 km. W San      Fernando, 8; 36 km. N and 10 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E      El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon, 1; 70 km. [by highway] S      Ciudad Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo, 6.  _Remarks._--Most of these mice were taken in densely vegetated fallow fields, where both grass and brush were found. Many of the mice were captured at their burrow openings, some of which were found to be plugged and others not plugged.   ~Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius~ Allen  Fulvous Harvest Mouse       _Reithrodontomys mexicanus intermedius_ Allen, Bull. Amer.      Mus. Nat. Hist., 7:136, May 21, 1895. (Type from      Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas.)       _Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius_ Howell, N. Amer.      Fauna, 36:47, June 5, 1914.       _Specimen examined_, 1 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.   ~Baiomys taylori taylori~ (Thomas)  Pygmy Mouse       _Hesperomys (Vesperimus) taylori_ Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat.      Hist, ser. 5, 19:66, January, 1887. (Type from San Diego,      Duval County, Texas.)       _Baiomys taylori_ Mearns, Mamm. Mex. Bound., Bull. 56:381,      April 13, 1907.        _Specimens examined_, 2 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.  _Remarks._--Specimens were captured in runways in dense grass and weeds at the edge of a corn field.   ~Perom"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31448"],["title","Mammals from Tamaulipas, Mexico (#1)"],["body","leucopus texanus~ (Woodhouse)  White-footed Mouse       _Hesperomys texana_ Woodhouse, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.      Philadelphia, 6:242, 1853. (Type probably from the vicinity      of Mason, Mason County, Texas.)       _Peromyscus leucopus texanus_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,      28:127, April 17, 1909.       _Specimens examined_, 8 as follows: 7 km. S and 2 km. W San      Fernando, 1; 12 km. N and 4 km. W Ciudad Victoria, 2; 70 km.

Kansas Mus. Nat. Hist.; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 6 km. W of the [Pan-American] highway [at El      Carrizo], Tamaulipas, Mexico; 12 January 1950; obtained by      William J. Schaldach, Jr., original no. 566.       _Range._--Known only from the type locality; probably found      in other localities along the humid, east face of the Sierra      Madre Oriental in Tamaulipas.       _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see measurements); upper parts      near Ochraceous Tawny (capitalized color terms after      Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington,      D. C., 1912), brighter on sides and duller on back; cheeks,      sides of neck, shoulders and upper forelegs lighter, between      Ochraceous Buff and Ochraceous Orange; eye ring dark;      underparts light Cinnamon Buff, breast patch brighter; ears      dusky, sparsely covered with hairs colored like back; feet      white; tail scaly in appearance, indistinctly bicolored with      short dark hairs above and short pale hairs below; skull      without beaded or ridged supraorbital border; rostrum      expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel; teeth with      strongly developed outer accessory cusps on the first and      second upper molar teeth; anteriormost loph      (parastyle-protoconule of Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:11,      September 23, 1918) of the first upper molar large, almost      as broad as greatest breadth of tooth.       _Comparisons._--_Peromyscus ochraventer_ has been compared      with _P. difficilis_ (specimens from Veracruz), _P. boylei_      (Veracruz), _P. banderanus_ (Guerrero), _P. mexicanus_      (Veracruz), _P. furvus_ (Veracruz), and _P. latirostris_      (San Luis Potosí). From _P. difficilis_, _P. ochraventer_      differs in having underparts distinctively brownish, rostrum      expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel, anteriormost      loph of the first upper molar larger, and auditory bulla      smaller. From _P. boylei_, _P. ochraventer_ differs in      having underparts distinctively brownish, tail less      distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides      almost parallel, and anteriormost loph of the first upper      molar larger. From _P. banderanus_, _P. ochraventer_ differs      in having underparts distinctively brownish, tail less      distinctly bicolored, rostrum expanded anteriorly with sides      almost parallel, anteriormost loph of the first upper molar      larger, auditory bulla smaller, and in lacking a beaded or      ridged supraorbital border. From _P. mexicanus_, _P.      ochraventer_ differs in having underparts distinctively      brownish, tail not irregularly blotched with dusky, rostrum      expanded anteriorly with sides almost parallel, anteriormost      loph of the first upper molar larger, and in lacking a      beaded or ridged supraorbital border. From _P. furvus_ and      _P. latirostris_, _P. ochraventer_ differs in being smaller,      having underparts distinctively brownish, tail not      irregularly blotched with dusky, rostrum proportionately      shorter, and interpterygoid space relatively narrower.  _Remarks._--_Peromyscus ochraventer_ is considered to be a distinct species showing little evident relationship with other Mexican _Peromyscus_. In the shape of the skull, especially the anterior expansion of the rostrum, _P. ochraventer_ seems to be related to _P. furvus_ and _P. latirostris_, a series of the latter being made available for examination by Dr. George G. Lowery, Jr., of the Museum of Zoology at Louisiana State University. However, the rostrum of these two larger species is proportionately longer than the rostrum of _P. ochraventer_. In size, coloration and most cranial features, _P. ochraventer_ resembles _P. mexicanus_, although the absence, instead of presence, of a supraorbital bead or ridge, the almost parallel-sided, instead of more pointed, rostrum and the larger, instead of smaller, interiormost loph of the first upper molar in _P. ochraventer_ are well-marked differences. The baculum of _P. ochraventer_ is much shorter with a proportionately heavier base and shaft than the baculum of _P. mexicanus mexicanus_ (from Veracruz) and _P. m. saxatilis_ (from Costa Rica). The geographic range of _Peromyscus ochraventer_ is not known to meet that of _P. mexicanus_; the nearest place to the type locality of _P. ochraventer_ from which _P. mexicanus_ has been taken is at Xilitla approximately 225 kilometers to the southward in San Luis Potosí (Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., No. 28:8, July 10, 1950).  The brown coloring on the underparts is a distinctive feature of _P. ochraventer_; in adults this color differs in shade. In some specimens patches of whitish hair give the tail a splotched appearance. Eleven of the twenty-eight skulls and lower jaws examined have bone eroded away from around the cheek-teeth exposing part of the roots. Most of the fully adult animals have this condition. One adult female, no. 36959, has the upper third molar on the right side missing, possibly as a result of bone erosion.  These mice were taken in junglelike forest, in rocks and adjacent to logs. Schaldach writes that \"Their burrows go back under the large limestone blocks, and each burrow where I caught a mouse has a pile of excavated earth, like a tiny gopher mound.\" The trapping area was at an elevation of approximately 2800 feet on the steep sides of a small hill on top of which the field camp was situated. Schaldach indicated that this locality was transitional between arid tropical and humid tropical conditions. On January 13, 1950, a female taken was lactating and had five recent placental scars; another taken the same day also had five placental scars.       _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of seven      adult males and six adult females of _P. ochraventer_ from      the type locality are, respectively, as follows: Total      length, 238.0 (227-249), 236.5 (226-248); length of tail,      124.4 (117-127), 122.2 (116-128); length of hind foot, 25.6      (24-26), 25.5 (25-26); length of ear from notch, 20.9      (20-21), 20.7 (20-21); greatest length of skull, 31.0      (30.6-31.9), 30.8 (30.5-31.0); basilar length, 23.3      (22.7-23.8), 23.4 (23.0-23.9); zygomatic breadth, 15.1      (14.6-15.7), 15.0 (14.9-15.2); post palatal length, 10.6      (10.5-10.9), 10.9 (10.5-11.2); interorbital breadth, 4.7      (4.5-4.9), 4.7 (4.6-4.8); mastoidal breadth, 12.8      (12.4-13.2), 12.8 (12.6-12.9); length of nasals, 11.6      (10.8-12.0), 11.6 (11.2-11.7); length of shelf of bony      palate, 4.7 (4.5-4.8), 4.6 (4.5-4.7); length of palatine      slits, 6.3 (6.0-6.5), 6.2 (6.0-6.4); length of diastema, 8.2      (8.0-8.5), 8.2 (8.1-8.4); alveolar length of upper      molariform tooth-row, 4.4 (4.3-4.6), 4.4 (4.3-4.5).       _Specimens examined_, 28, from the type locality.   ~Oryzomys couesi aquaticus~ Allen  Coues Rice Rat       _Oryzomys aquaticus_ Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,      3:289, June 30, 1891. (Type from Brownsville, Cameron      County, Texas.)       _Oryzomys couesi aquaticus_ Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:39,      September 23, 1918.       _Specimens examined_, 2 as follows: 36 km. N and 10 km. W      Ciudad Victoria, 1 km. E El Barretal, on Río Purificacíon,      1; 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad Victoria and 6 km. W of the      [Pan-American] highway [at El Carrizo], 1.  _Remarks._--The specimens, all immatures, are slightly darker than topotypes of _O. c. aquaticus_, seemingly tending toward the darker _O. c. peragrus_ Merriam to the southward. These records of occurrence extend the known range of this subspecies approximately 210 miles to the southward and increase the possibility of continuous distribution between _O. c. aquaticus_ and _O. c. peragrus_.  The male obtained south of Ciudad Victoria was taken on January 12, by William J. Shaldach, Jr., 200 yards within the tunnel of a mine at an elevation of approximately 2600 feet. This was in the Sierra Gorda, which is a part of the Sierra Madre Oriental.   ~Oryzomys rostratus rostratus~ Merriam  Rice Rat       _Oryzomys rostratus_ Merriam, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci.,      3:293, July 26, 1901. (Type from Metlaltoyuca, Pueblo,      Mexico.)       _Specimen examined_, 1 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. W El Carrizo.  _Remarks._--This immature male is paler than specimens of _O. r. rostratus_ from the state of Veracruz. This locality extends the known range of this species northward a distance of approximately 100 miles. Previously it had been recorded from only as far north as Alta Mira, Tamaulipas (Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:54, September 23, 1918). This specimen was trapped on February 16 in a rodent runway in dense grass in a fallow cane field.   ~Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae~ Osgood  Fulvous Rice Rat       _Oryzomys fulvescens engraciae_ Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 26:300,      November 14, 1945. (Type from Hacienda Santa Engracia,      northwest of Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico.)       _Specimens examined_, 5 from 70 km. [by highway] S Ciudad      Victoria and 2 km. E El Carrizo.  _Remarks._--These specimens are referred to _O. f. engraciae_ on the basis of their pale color and narrow interorbital space. They were taken in runways in dense grass in fallow cane fields.   ~Sigmodon"]]]
