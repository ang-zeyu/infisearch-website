Funkhouser (1957) followed Noble's suggestion and attempted to explain the evolution of the species of _Phyllomedusa_ (_sensu lato_) by assuming that they evolved from an advanced _Hyla_-like ancestor. Therefore, she placed those species having large, fully webbed hands and feet near the base of her phylogenetic scheme and hypothesized that evolutionary sequences involved stages of reduction and eventual loss of webbing, followed by the development of grasping toes. Such an evolutionary history is highly unlikely. The _Agalychnis_ phyletic line has one kind of specialization for an arboreal existence. It is contrary to evolutionary theory that a specialized group would evolve into a generalized form and then evolve new kinds of specializations to meet the needs imposed by the same environmental conditions affecting the earlier specialized group. A more reasonable hypothesis is that the evolution of opposable digits took place in a phyletic line that had as its ancestral stock a frog with generalized hands and feet. If this assumption is correct, _Phyllomedusa_ and _Agalychnis_ represent different phyletic lines; each exhibits divergent modes of adaptation for arboreal habits, whereas _Pachymedusa_ probably remains relatively little changed from the basic phyllomedusine stock.  On the basis of modern distribution and areas of diversification alone (no fossils are known), it is evident that _Phyllomedusa_ underwent its adaptive radiation in South America, _Agalychnis_ evolved in Central America, and _Pachymedusa_ ended up in western México. If we follow the Matthewsian concepts of the American herpetofauna outlined by Dunn (1931) and modified by Schmidt (1943) and Stuart (1950), _Pachymedusa_ represents a \"hanging-relict\" of a group that moved southward. According to Savage's (1966) interpretation of the origins and history of the American herpetofauna, _Agalychnis_ and _Pachymedusa_ are members of the Mesoamerican fauna, and _Phyllomedusa_ is part of the Neotropical fauna. Perhaps the phyllomedusines arose in South America; from there a primitive stock spread northward and survived as _Pachymedusa_ in México, whereas the stock in Central America and South America evolved into _Agalychnis_ and _Phyllomedusa_, respectively.  Evidently the primitive phyllomedusines evolved the habit of arboreal egg deposition and a walking gait; the latter is best developed in the small, highly specialized species of _Phyllomedusa_ (Lutz, 1966). Probably the other divergent arboreal adaptations resulted from environmental stresses and competition. The generalized _Pachymedusa_ inhabits relatively dry areas characterized by low forest. Throughout its range it coexists with no more than five other arboreal hylids. The species of _Agalychnis_ live in rain forests and humid montane forests. In any given area one species of _Agalychnis_ occurs sympatrically with no more than a dozen other arboreal hylids. With few exceptions the species of _Agalychnis_ are more arboreal in their habits than are other hylids. The species of _Phyllomedusa_ live in the same kinds of habitats as do those of _Agalychnis_, but throughout the ranges of most of the species of _Phyllomedusa_ the diversity of arboreal hylids is much greater than in Central America. In the upper Amazon Basin as many as 35 hylids occur sympatrically. Many groups of _Hyla_ in this area (for example, the _Hyla boans_ and _Hyla marmorata_ groups) are equally as arboreal in their habits as are the species of _Agalychnis_ in Central America. Conceivably, competition within this array of tree frogs resulted in selection for modification of the extremities, thereby bringing about a different mode of climbing in _Phyllomedusa_. The walking gait already present in phyllomedusines provided a source for further modification, which resulted in the development of opposable digits and the associated lemuroid manner of climbing.  The known life histories of most species of _Phyllomedusa_, all species of _Agalychnis_, and that of _Pachymedusa_ are similar. Characteristically the tadpoles are generalized pelagic types that develop in ponds, but at least some of the small specialized _Phyllomedusa_ in southeastern Brazil have stream-adapted tadpoles with funnel-shaped mouths (Cochran, 1955; Bokermann, 1966). Knowledge of the life histories of the other species of _Phyllomedusa_ should aid in the interpretation of the phylogenetic relationships of the several groups of frogs now assigned to that genus.

KANSAS 1953  24-7673     Geographic Distribution of the Pocket Mouse, Perognathus fasciatus  BY  J. KNOX JONES, JR.   In his \"Revision of the pocket mice of the genus Perognathus,\" Osgood (1900:18-20) reviewed the distribution, as then known, of _Perognathus fasciatus_ and recognized two geographic races--_Perognathus fasciatus_ [_fasciatus_] Wied-Neuwied in eastern Montana and Wyoming and adjacent parts of North and South Dakota, and _Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus_ Thomas, known only from the type locality at Loveland, Larimer County, Colorado. Later, Cary (1911:61) described _Perognathus fasciatus litus_ as a pale subspecies occurring in the lower Sweetwater Valley and adjacent parts of the Red Desert of south-central Wyoming. After 1911 no important taxonomic contributions dealing with _Perognathus fasciatus_ appeared.  In studying the kinds of pocket mice known from Nebraska, I examined thirteen specimens of _P. fasciatus_ from the northwestern part of the state which did not agree satisfactorily with the descriptions of any known subspecies of _fasciatus_. This impelled me to examine material from the entire range of _P. fasciatus_. This examination revealed that: (1) _Perognathus callistus_ Osgood, heretofore considered to be a full species, should be reduced to subspecific rank under _P. fasciatus_; and (2) specimens from eastern Wyoming and adjacent parts of Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska represent an heretofore unrecognized subspecies. Further investigation, however, revealed that _Perognathus flavescens olivaceogriseus_ Swenk, described from northwestern Nebraska (Swenk, 1940:6), is not _flavescens_ but actually _fasciatus_. Since the specimens on which Swenk's description was based were taken within the range of this newly recognized subspecies, and since my examination of the holotype shows it to be of the species _Perognathus fasciatus_, the subspecific name _olivaceogriseus_ is available.  The subspecies of _P. fasciatus_ are most easily distinguished by color of pelage, in which there is a general cline from northeast (dark) to southwest (pale). Cranially, the subspecies are less distinct. The skulls of _P. f. callistus_ can be distinguished from those of the other subspecies by several differences; however, among the other four subspecies, only minor cranial differences are evident. Individual variation was found to be greater than secondary sexual variation.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Distribution of the five subspecies of _Perognathus fasciatus_.

From topotypes of _Perognathus fasciatus callistus_, _P. f. olivaceogriseus_ differs in: Upper parts slightly darker, pelage not silky, coarser in appearance; hind foot shorter; skull averaging smaller in all measurements taken (especially mastoidal breadth), except interparietal breadth "]]]
