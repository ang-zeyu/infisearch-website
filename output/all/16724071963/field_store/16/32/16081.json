And I might have been fishing all the time.\"  \"Well,\" said his father, \"whose fault is it?\"  \"Old Spot's, I should think!\" Johnnie replied.  \"I don't see how you can blame him,\" said Farmer Green. \"Suppose you had buried a piece of strawberry shortcake here, expecting to eat it for your dinner. And suppose there wasn't another piece as good--or as big--to be had anywhere. And suppose you had come back from a tramp in the woods, hungry as--well, hungry as you were this noon. Wouldn't you want that piece of shortcake? If you could get old Spot to move the wood off it, wouldn't you be glad to have him do it?\"  \"Maybe!\" Johnnie admitted. \"Maybe! But Spot wasn't after a piece of strawberry shortcake. He was after an old bone. And he fooled me.\"  \"I should say that you fooled yourself,\" his father retorted. \"Anyhow, we're going to have strawberry shortcake for supper to-night. I heard your mother say so. And she made a special cake for you.\"  That news made Johnnie Green look a good deal less gloomy. In fact he almost smiled.  \"I _was_ going to give you that old fishing rod of mine if you'd help carry in the wood,\" Farmer Greene went on. \"And you _could_ take it now and go fishing, if you thought you could be home in time for supper.\"  \"Hurrah!\" Johnnie Green suddenly jumped up and down. \"Hurrah!\" he cried. \"And thank you very much!\"  And when, an hour later, old Spot came swimming across the creek and joined Johnnie on the further bank, and shook drops of water all over his young master, Johnnie Green only patted him and called him a \"good old fellow.\"     VII  SWIMMING   Old dog Spot liked boys. Somehow they always managed to have a lively time; and usually they seemed glad to have him join them in their sports.  He never could understand why Johnnie Green and the neighbors' boys didn't want him to play baseball with them. Spot loved to chase a ball. And sometimes when he was watching a game and somebody hit a slow grounder he would rush out and grab the ball and run with it.  Then all the boys would run after him and try to catch him. That always pleased Spot mightily. And the longer the chase lasted the happier he was. But it was different with the boys. The harder they had to run after Spot before they got the ball away from him the more out of patience they became.  Whenever Spot took part in a ball game like that Johnnie Green usually put an end to his fun, for the time being, by tying him to something or other--perhaps a fence or a tree. But even that was better--so Spot thought--than being sent home in disgrace.  Luckily there were other sports in which Spot could romp with the boys as much as he pleased, without anybody's objecting. Nutting in the woods in the fall; skating on the mill pond or coasting down the long hill past Farmer Green's house in the winter; berrying in the summer--and swimming! Those were only a few of the jolly times that Spot and the boys enjoyed together.  Perhaps, of them all, both Spot and the boys liked swimming the most. As for Spot, he didn't care _where_ he swam, so long as the water was wet. Broad Brook, Swift River, Black Creek, or the mill pond--any one of those places suited him as well as another. The boys, however, preferred the mill pond. It was deep enough, by the dam, to suit the best swimmers; and it was shallow enough at the upper end for those that were just learning.  All the boys thought it great fun when a wagon clattered over the bridge, which crossed right above the dam. Then they ducked into the water, with only their heads out, and shouted more or less politely at whoever was passing.  At such times Spot barked, because that seemed to him the gentlemanly thing to do. But he never could see any sense in jumping into the water if he happened to be out on the bank when a wagon came along.  The boys threw sticks about the pond for Spot to fetch back to them. They raced with him. They upset him when he was sunning himself on the big rock near the dam, and they laughed to see the splash he made when he struck the water.  No matter what tricks the boys played on him, Spot never lost his temper. He took everything good-naturedly. And one day, when Johnnie Green and his friends were swimming in the mill pond he even took a bundle of clothes from beneath a big hickory on the bank. Yes! Spot caught up somebody's clothes in his mouth and started along the road with them.  He was surprised to hear a terrible outcry from the water.     VIII  WHAT RED DID   Old dog Spot was trotting down the road from the mill pond, carrying a bundle of somebody's clothes in his mouth. When he heard frantic shouts from the water, where Johnnie Green and his friends were swimming, he quickened his pace.  One of the swimmers was known as \"Red.\" And it was a favorite trick of his to tie hard knots in other boys' garments while the owners of them were in the pond. Usually he wet the knots, because wetting them made them harder to untie.  On this day somebody had turned the tables on Red. Somebody had crept up behind the big old hickory tree on the bank and had knotted Red's clothes tightly. That was why old Spot found a bundle under the tree, all tied up and ready to carry off.  It was no wonder that the boys began to yell when they saw Spot pick up those clothes and calmly trot away with them. It was no wonder that they swam to the bank and scrambled up to the big hickory to find out whose clothes were missing.  When they saw that Red was the unlucky one, everybody else began to whoop and laugh.  But not Red! He let out a frightened scream and started to follow old dog Spot.  To the great delight of his companions, the rattle of a wagon and the thud of a horse's feet sounded from up the road. And since some one must soon drive over the bridge, which crossed right above the dam, Red scurried back again and dived into the pond, into which Johnnie Green and the others had already plunged.  Red rose to the surface spluttering. And finding that he could touch bottom with his feet, he stood with his carroty head out of water, watching for the wagon.  It soon came into view, out of the woods, and the horse that drew it thundered upon the bridge. The horse was old Ebenezer; and Farmer Green was driving him.  \"Hi!\" Red shouted. \"Stop! Wait a minute!\"  Johnnie Green's father pulled Ebenezer to a halt.  \"What's going on here?\" he inquired.  \"Spot took my clothes,\" Red explained. \"He's run down the road with them. Get them for me--please!\"  Hoots and catcalls from the other boys followed Red's speech, which was a wonderfully polite one--for him.  Farmer Green couldn't help laughing.  \"I'm going to the village,\" he said. \"If I find any clothes along the road I'll pick them up and put them in the wagon. And if you're here when I come back I'll give them to you.\"  \"He'll be here!\" Johnnie Green shouted. \"Red'll wait for you.\"  \"If you hurry, maybe you can catch Spot,\" Red called to Farmer Green as he drove off. \"I can't stay here all day.\"  \"You'll have to,\" the boys jeered.  \"Maybe you'll have to wait here till dark,\" Johnnie Green suggested.  \"I won't!\" Red replied, as he swam towards the bank. \"Your dog took my clothes,\" he cried as he ran up to the big hickory. \"And I'm going to take yours.\"  [Illustration: Spot Started After Frisky Squirrel.  (_Page 42_)]  It was Johnnie's turn to yell then. He was on the further side of the mill pond. And long before he could cross it Red had snatched up Johnnie's clothes from the shade of the hickory and dodged into the bushes with them.     IX  A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES   Old dog Spot was trotting down the road with the bundle of clothes in his mouth--the clothes which belonged to Johnnie Green's friend Red, who was one of the swimming party in the mill pond.  Somewhat to Spot's surprise the boys had not come tearing down the road after him.  \"It's queer,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder why they don't follow me. This would be fun if they'd only chase me.\"  Just then he happened to spy a squirrel on a stone wall. Spot promptly made for this gentleman. Keeping a firm hold on his bundle, he plunged through a tangle of blackberry bushes that grew beside the road.  The thorny brambles caught at Spot's bundle and held it fast.  \"_G-r-r-r!_\" he growled. \"I don't want to lose sight of that fat fellow. Unless I'm mistaken, it was Frisky Squirrel. And I've had an eye out for him for a longtime.\"  After a few frantic tugs he let go of the bundle of clothes and dashed after the squirrel.  It was Frisky Squirrel. He ran up a tree while Spot was struggling in the blackberry thicket. And he scampered from one tree top to another while Spot followed beneath him, barking furiously.  At last Frisky stopped and sat on a limb, to chatter and scold at old dog Spot.  \"What are you doing so far from home?\" he demanded after a while.  \"I've been swimming in the mill pond with the boys,\" said old dog Spot.  \"Then you'd better go back there at once, unless you want a punishing later,\" Frisky Squirrel told him. \"I can hear them whistling for you.\"  It wasn't far from the mill pond--that place where they were talking, for Spot's chase of Frisky Squirrel had led him back up the hill again. Now Spot cocked his ear in the direction of the pond and listened. Sure enough! he could hear Johnnie Green's whistle.  \"I'll see you again,\" he told Frisky Squirrel.  \"Not if I see you first!\" Frisky muttered as old Spot started through the woods for the mill pond.  \"Come here!\" Johnnie Green greeted him sternly when, a few minutes later, he appeared on the bank. \"Where are those clothes that you took?\"  Spot wagged his tail. He acted very, very friendly. Nobody would have supposed, from his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],["title","The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#3)"],["body","ooks, that he had stolen anyone's clothes.  \"This is no joke,\" Johnnie Green declared. \"I haven't anything to wear. Get those clothes and bring them back here!\"  \"I don't know what's the matter with Johnnie,\" Spot thought. \"I didn't touch his things. I don't see why he's so angry.\"  \"Good old Spot!\" Johnnie coaxed. \"Find the clothes! There's a good fellow!\"  He waded toward the bank and snapped his fingers at Spot.  The old dog edged away. Johnnie _talked_ pleasantly enough. But he had a queer look in his eye. Spot thought it safer to keep out of his clutches.  Just then the miller came driving up the hill on a load of corn. When he saw the boys in the pond he stopped his horses.  \"Anybody here lost any clothes?\" he asked, holding a bundle up in his hand. \"I found these by the side of the road. I noticed them hanging on a blackberry bush.\"  \"I'll take 'em!\" Johnnie Green cried. \"They belong to Red. But you can leave them with me.\"  The miller tossed the bundle to him.  The boy Red, wearing Johnnie's clothes, was watching everything that went on, from behind a tree. He waited until Johnnie had untied the hard, wet knots in the clothes. Then he stepped out from his hiding place.  \"Let's swap!\" he said. And while they were swapping, old dog Spot took a swim in the mill pond. Somehow he felt that all was well again.     X  DROPPING HINTS   On the table in the kitchen of the farmhouse was a leg of mutton. Farmer Green had left it there and gone away. And Mrs. Green had stepped out of the kitchen--nobody knew for how long.  At least old dog Spot and Miss Kitty Cat didn't know. They were left there in the kitchen alone--alone with the leg of mutton.  \"Ahem!\" said Miss Kitty Cat to old dog Spot. \"Don't you think you'd better go and see what's become of Farmer Green?\"  She was unusually pleasant, for her. As a rule she had little to say to Spot, except to scold at him.  \"I'm comfortable here, thank you,\" Spot answered. \"Farmer Green must be out of sight by this time. So I won't bother to chase after him.\"  \"You could smell out his track, couldn't you?\" Miss Kitty Cat suggested.  \"Perhaps!\" said Spot. \"Perhaps! But as I said, I'm comfortable here. I'm going to stay right here in the kitchen.\" Out of the corner of his eye he looked at Miss Kitty Cat. He could see that she was somewhat displeased by something or other. Her tail was beginning to swell slightly. And that was a sure sign that she was losing her temper. But when she spoke again her voice was as sweet as honey.  \"What a beautiful day to go hunting!\" she remarked as she sprang into a chair beside the window and looked out. \"The woods must be full of birds.\"  \"No doubt!\" said Spot dryly. \"I went hunting early this morning; and there was plenty of game then.\"  \"Ha!\" Miss Kitty exclaimed suddenly. \"Do I hear the cows in the cornfield?\"  Now, Spot loved to drive the cows out of the corn. But for a wonder, he never even moved an ear.  \"I hope the sheep haven't scrambled over the stone wall,\" Miss Kitty Cat mewed. \"If they have, Farmer Green would want you to get them back into the pasture for him.\"  \"Yes!\" said Spot with a yawn. \"I'm sure he would. And if he needs me he knows where he can find me.\"  Miss Kitty Cat's tail was growing bigger every moment. And the fur on her back was beginning to stand on end. Still she managed to speak in her very softest voice.  \"Did you know--\" she inquired--\"did you know that Johnnie Green had gone swimming in the mill pond?\"  \"No!\" said Spot. \"Has he? I hope he'll have a good time. I had a fine swim yesterday in Black Creek. And I almost caught a muskrat there.\"  As he spoke he rose and walked across the big, square kitchen and stretched himself out on the floor right in front of the table where the leg of mutton lay.  At that Miss Kitty Cat gave a terrible cry of rage.  \"I know why you won't leave the kitchen!\" she yowled. \"You think I'm going to eat some of that mutton. And that's why you've lain down alongside it.\"     XI  MRS. GREEN'S MISTAKE   Old dog Spot never moved from the place where he was lying in front of the kitchen table. Although Miss Kitty Cat had told him angrily that he thought she was going to enjoy a luncheon on the leg of mutton that was on the kitchen table, he didn't lose his temper.  \"Pardon me!\" he said. \"You are mistaken. I don't think you're going to have even a taste of this mutton--not while I'm in the kitchen!\"  Miss Kitty Cat was furious. She had done her best to make Spot go away. She had dropped a number of hints to get him out of doors. But Spot hadn't taken a single one of them.  \"You're a meddlesome old dog,\" she scolded. \"I've a good mind to drag my claws across your nose.\"  Spot grinned at her.  \"If you do,\" he warned her, \"I shall yelp. Then Mrs. Green will hurry back here to see what's going on. And you certainly won't get any mutton while she's in the kitchen. I happen to know that the family's going to have that leg of mutton for dinner to-morrow.\"  \"There ought to be enough of it for everybody,\" Miss Kitty Cat grumbled. \"If I ate a bit of it nobody would ever miss it. And after I've finished my meal there would be nothing to prevent your helping yourself. I certainly shouldn't stand in your way--nor lie in it, either.\"  Old dog Spot couldn't help sniffing.  \"I never snatch any food when Mrs. Green's back is turned,\" he told Miss Kitty Cat severely. \"She feeds me all she thinks I ought to eat. And if I want more, I hunt for it in the woods and fields.\"  \"Don't I hunt?\" Miss Kitty Cat hissed. \"I keep the house free of rats and mice. Mrs. Green could well spare me a bit of that mutton in return for all I do for her.... I'll thank you, sir, to move away from that table!\"  Old Spot began to look somewhat anxious. He had once felt Miss Kitty's sharp claws on his nose. And he didn't care to be scratched by her again. But there was the leg of mutton! He had to guard that for Mrs. Green.  \"I wish Mrs. Green would come back,\" he said to himself. \"I don't want a row with this Cat person.\"  Miss Kitty suddenly spat at him.  Spot knew that that was a danger sign. And he gave a few short, sharp barks.  \"There!\" he muttered. \"That ought to fetch Mrs. Green. If she's in the house she can't help hearing me.\"  Spot was right. In about a minute Farmer Green's wife came hurrying into the kitchen.  Old dog Spot jumped up and wagged his tail and gave a low-pitched bark as if to say, \"I've saved your leg of mutton for you, Mrs. Green.\"  But she didn't understand him.  \"You rascal!\" Mrs. Green exclaimed. \"You've been teasing the cat again. I can tell by the way she acts. Out you go!\" And she opened the door.  Spot went.     XII  RIGHTING A WRONG   Poor Spot! He felt so mournful that he lifted up his muzzle and howled. Farmer Green's wife had just ordered him out of the kitchen. She thought he had been teasing Miss Kitty Cat. And instead he had kept Miss Kitty from tasting the leg of mutton that lay on the kitchen table.  \"It's a sad, sad world!\" he howled. \"I thought Mrs. Green would praise me. But she didn't. She scolded me!\"  \"Sakes alive!\" cried Henrietta Hen as she rushed up to him in the farmyard. \"What's the matter with you? Are you trying to bay the moon in the daytime?\"  Turkey Proudfoot gobbled at Spot and bade him be still. Turkey Proudfoot was very pompous, for he had an idea that he ruled the farmyard.  Old dog Spot felt so meek, after the scolding that Mrs. Green gave him, that he couldn't find a word to say to anybody that spoke to him.  \"I've expected this for some time,\" the Rooster told Henrietta Hen. \"Mrs. Green has put old Spot out of the farmhouse. And Farmer Green intends to put him off the farm. Everyone agrees that he's a nuisance. It's a wonder the folks in the Green family have kept him all these years.\"  Well, old dog Spot couldn't help hearing what the Rooster said. And he hadn't even heart enough to answer that impertinent boaster.  \"Maybe he knows what he's talking about,\" Spot groaned. \"I wish Johnnie Green would come home. _He'd_ stand up for me, if nobody else will.\"  Then something happened all at once that helped Spot's spirits amazingly. The woodshed door flew open and Miss Kitty Cat all but flew out of it. Farmer Green's wife appeared in the doorway with a broom in her hand. And with it she helped Miss Kitty into the yard. She helped her so much that Miss Kitty never touched the broad stone doorstep at all.  \"Scat!\" cried Mrs. Green. \"I don't want any thieves in my kitchen.\"  It was quite plain that something had displeased Mrs. Green--something in which Miss Kitty Cat had had a part. And old dog Spot thought he knew what that something was.  \"Ha!\" he barked at Miss Kitty. \"So Mrs. Green found you out!\" And he ran at Miss Kitty and chased her into a tree. She sat herself down upon a limb and glared at him.  \"Wow!\" he yelped. \"You must have sampled that leg of mutton when you thought Mrs. Green's back was turned. And she must have caught you in the act.\"  Though that was exactly what had happened, Miss Kitty Cat wouldn't say a word. But she _looked_ whole sentences at him.  Soon Farmer Green's wife came to the door again and called, \"Come, Spot! Come, Spot!\"  He hurried up to her and caught the piece of meat that she tossed to him.  It was mutton.     XIII  HUNTING   To please old dog Spot Johnnie Green had only to ask him this question, \"Want to go hunting, Spot?\"  When he heard that, Spot would leave anything he happened to be doing, or give up anything he had intended to do. Perhaps he had expected to dig up and gnaw a choice bone that he had buried somewhere. It might be that he had been planning to chase the cat, or tease Turkey Proudfoot in order to hear him gobble. There wasn't one of those pleasures that Spot wouldn't gladly forgo for the sake of going hunting with Johnnie Green.  When Johnnie Green's father first gave him a shotgun Spot went almost frantic with delight. And they lost no time in starting for the woods. Johnnie Green trudged up the lane with the gun"]]]
