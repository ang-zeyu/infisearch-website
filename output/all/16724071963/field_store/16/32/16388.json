MARY BAKER EDDY      PREFACE.   [Page ix.]  [Transcriber’s Note: The original book includes line numbers throughout the text, for easy reference to the text by page number and line number. This transcription retains those page and line numbers; the numbers in [square brackets] at the right ends of lines are the original book’s line numbers. The paragraphs are not adjusted as is customary for text in e-books, nor are words split by hyphens rejoined, so that the lines shown below have the same words as the lines in the original book.]  A certain apothegm of a Talmudical philosopher [1] suits my sense of doing good. It reads thus: “The noblest charity is to prevent a man from accepting charity; and the best alms are to show and to enable a man to dispense with alms.” [5]  In the early history of Christian Science, among my thousands of students few were wealthy. Now, Christian Scientists are not indigent; and their comfortable fortunes are acquired by healing mankind morally, physically, spiritually. The easel of time presents pictures—once [10] fragmentary and faint—now rejuvenated by the touch of God’s right hand. Where joy, sorrow, hope, disap- pointment, sigh, and smile commingled, now hope sits dove-like.  To preserve a long course of years still and uniform, [15] amid the uniform darkness of storm and cloud and tempest, requires strength from above,—deep draughts from the fount of divine Love. Truly may it be said: There is an old age of the heart, and a youth that never grows old; a Love that is a boy, and a Psyche who is [20] ever a girl. The fleeting freshness of youth, however, is not the evergreen of Soul; the coloring glory of  [Page x.]  perpetual bloom; the spiritual glow and grandeur of [1] a consecrated life wherein dwelleth peace, sacred and sincere in trial or in triumph.  The opportunity has at length offered itself for me to comply with an oft-repeated request; namely, to collect [5] my miscellaneous writings published in _The Christian_ _Science Journal_, since April, 1883, and republish them in book form,—accessible as reference, and reliable as old landmarks. Owing to the manifold demands on my time in the early pioneer days, most of these articles [10] were originally written in haste, without due preparation. To those heretofore in print, a few articles are herein appended. To some articles are affixed data, where these are most requisite, to serve as mile-stones measuring the distance,—or the difference between then and now,— [15] in the opinions of men and the progress of our Cause.  My signature has been slightly changed from my Christian name, Mary Morse Baker. Timidity in early years caused me, as an author, to assume various _noms_ _de plume_. After my first marriage, to Colonel Glover [20] of Charleston, South Carolina, I dropped the name of Morse to retain my maiden name,—thinking that other- wise the name would be too long.  In 1894, I received from the Daughters of the American Revolution a certificate of membership made out to Mary [25] Baker Eddy, and thereafter adopted that form of signature, except in connection with my published works.  [Page xi.]  The first edition of Science and Health having been [1] copyrighted at the date of its issue, 1875, in my name of Glover, caused me to retain the initial “G” on my subsequent books.  These pages, although a reproduction of what has [5] been written, are still in advance of their time; and are richly rewarded by what they have hitherto achieved for the race. While no offering can liquidate one’s debt of gratitude to God, the fervent heart and willing hand are not unknown to nor unrewarded by Him. [10]  May this volume be to the reader a graphic guide- book, pointing the path, dating the unseen, and enabling him to walk the untrodden in the hitherto unexplored fields of Science. At each recurring holiday the Christian Scientist will find herein a “canny” crumb; and thus [15] may time’s pastimes become footsteps to joys eternal.  Realism will at length be found to surpass imagination, and to suit and savor all literature. The shuttlecock of religious intolerance will fall to the ground, if there be no battledores to fling it back and forth. It is reason for [20] rejoicing that the _vox populi_ is inclined to grant us peace, together with pardon for the preliminary battles that purchased it.  With tender tread, thought sometimes walks in memory, through the dim corridors of years, on to old battle- [25] grounds, there sadly to survey the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],["title","Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#1)"],["body","of the slain and the enemy’s losses. In compiling this work, I have tried  [Page xii.]  to remove the pioneer signs and ensigns of war, and to [1] retain at this date the privileged armaments of peace.  With armor on, I continue the march, command and countermand; meantime interluding with loving thought this afterpiece of battle. Supported, cheered, I take my [5] pen and pruning-hook, to “learn war no more,” and with strong wing to lift my readers above the smoke of conflict into light and liberty.  Mary Baker Eddy  CONCORD, N.H. January, 1897      CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY.     Prospectus.   [Page 1.]  The ancient Greek looked longingly for the Olym- [1] piad. The Chaldee watched the appearing of a star; to him, no higher destiny dawned on the dome of being than that foreshadowed by signs in the heav- [5] ens. The meek Nazarene, the scoffed of all scoffers, said, “Ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?”—for he forefelt and foresaw the ordeal of a perfect Christianity, hated by sinners. [10]  To kindle all minds with a gleam of gratitude, the new idea that comes welling up from infinite Truth needs to be understood. The seer of this age should be a sage.  Humility is the stepping-stone to a higher recognition [15] of Deity. The mounting sense gathers fresh forms and strange fire from the ashes of dissolving self, and drops the world. Meekness heightens immortal attributes only by removing the dust that dims them. Goodness reveals another scene and another self seemingly rolled [20] up in shades, but brought to light by the evolutions of  [Page 2.]  advancing thought, whereby we discern the power of [1] Truth and Love to heal the sick.  Pride is ignorance; those assume most who have the least wisdom or experience; and they steal from their neighbor, because they have so little of their own. [5]  The signs of these times portend a long and strong determination of mankind to cleave to the world, the flesh, and evil, causing great obscuration of Spirit. When we remember that God is just, and admit the total depravity of mortals, _alias_ mortal mind,—and that [10] this Adam legacy must first be seen, and then must be subdued and recompensed by justice, the eternal attri- bute of Truth,—the outlook demands labor, and the laborers seem few. To-day we behold but the first faint view of a more spiritual Christianity, that embraces [15] a deeper and broader philosophy and a more rational and divine healing. The time approaches when divine Life, Truth, and Love will be found alone the remedy for sin, sickness, and death; when God, man’s saving Principle, and Christ, the spiritual idea of God, will be revealed. [20]  Man’s probation after death is the necessity of his immortality; for good dies not and evil is self-destruc- tive, therefore evil must be mortal and self-destroyed. If man should not progress after death, but should re- main in error, he would be inevitably self-annihilated. [25] Those upon whom “the second death hath no power” are those who progress here and hereafter out of evil, their mortal element, and into good that is immortal; thus laying off the material beliefs that war against Spirit, and putting on the spiritual elements in divine [30] Science.  While we entertain decided views as to the best method  [Page 3.]  for elevating the race physically, morally, and spiritually, [1] and shall express these views as duty demands, we shall claim no especial gift from our divine origin, no supernatural power. If we regard good as more natural than evil, and spiritual understanding—the true knowl- [5] edge of God—as imparting the only power to heal the sick and the sinner, we shall demonstrate in our lives the power of Truth and Love.  The lessons we learn in divine Science are applica- ble to all the needs of man. Jesus taught them for this [10] very purpose; and his demonstration hath taught us that “through his stripes”—his life-experience—and divine Science, brought to the understanding through Christ, the Spirit-revelator, is man healed and saved. No opinions of mortals nor human hypotheses enter this [15] line of thought or action. Drugs, inert matter, never are needed to aid spiritual power. Hygiene, manipulation, and mesmerism are not Mind’s medicine. The Principle of all cure is God, unerring and immortal Mind. We have learned that the erring or mortal thought holds [20] in itself all sin, sickness, and death, and imparts these states to the body; while the supreme and perfect Mind, as seen in the truth of being, antidotes and destroys these material elements of sin and death.  Because God is supreme and omnipotent, _materia_ [25] _medica_, hygiene, and animal magnetism are impotent; and their only supposed efficacy is in apparently delud- ing reason, denying revelation, and dethroning Deity. The tendency of mental healing is to uplift mankind; but this method perverted, is “Satan let loose.” Hence the [30] deep demand for the Science of psychology to meet sin, and uncover it; thus to annihilate hallucination.  [Page 4.]  Thought imbued with purity, Truth, and Love, in- [1] structed in the Science of metaphysical healing, is the most potent and desirable remedial agent on the earth. At this period there is a marked tendency of mortal mind to plant mental healing on the basis of hypnotism, [5] calling this method “mental science.” All _Science_ is _Christian_ Science; the Science of the Mind that is God, and of the universe as His idea, and their relation to each other. Its only power to heal is its power to do good, not evil.     A Timely Issue.   At this date, 1883, a newspaper edited and published by the Christian Scientists has become a necessity. Many questions important to be disposed of come to the Col- lege and to the practising students, yet but little time [15] has been devoted to their answer. Further enlight- enment is necessary for the age, and a periodical de- voted to this work seems alone adequate to meet the requirement. Much interest is awakened and expressed on the subject of metaphysical healing, but in many [20] minds it is confounded with isms, and even infidelity, so that its religious specialty and the vastness of its worth are not understood.  It is often said, “You must have a very strong will- power to heal,” or, “It must require a great deal of faith [25] to make your demonstrations.” When it is answered that there is no will-power required, and that something more than faith is necessary, we meet with an expression of incredulity. It is not alone the mission of Christian Science to heal the sick, but to destroy sin in mortal [30]  [Page 5.]  thought. This work well done will elevate and purify [1] the race. It cannot fail to do this if we devote our best energies to the work.  Science reveals man as spiritual, harmonious, and eter- nal. This should be understood. Our College should [5] be crowded with students who are willing to consecrate themselves to this Christian work. Mothers should be able to produce perfect health and perfect morals in their children—and ministers, to heal the sick—by study- ing this scientific method of practising Christianity. [10] Many say, “I should like to study, but have not suffi- cient faith that I have the power to heal.” The healing power is Truth and Love, and these do not fail in the greatest emergencies.  _Materia medica_ says, “I can do no more. I have [15] done all that can be done. There is nothing to build upon. There is no longer any reason for hope.” Then metaphysics comes in, armed with the power of Spirit, not matter, takes up the case hopefully and builds on the stone that the builders have rejected, and is suc- [20] cessful.  Metaphysical therapeutics can seem a miracle and a mystery to those only who do not understand the grand reality that Mind controls the body. They acknowledge an erring or mortal mind, but believe it to be brain mat- [25] ter. That man is the idea of infinite Mind, always perfect in God, in Truth, Life, and Love, is something not easily accepted, weighed down as is mortal thought with mate- rial beliefs. That which never existed, can seem solid substance to this thought. It is much easier for people [30] to believe that the body affects the mind, than that the mind affects the body.  [Page 6.]  We hear from the pulpits that sickness is sent as a [1] discipline to bring man nearer to God,—even though sickness often leaves mortals but little time free from complaints and fretfulness, and Jesus cast out disease as evil. [5]  The most of our Christian Science practitioners have plenty to do, and many more are needed for the ad- vancement of the age. At present the majority of the acute cases are given to the M. D.’s, and only those cases that are pronounced incurable are passed over to [10] the Scientist. The healing of such cases should cer- tainly prove to all minds the power of metaphysics over physics; and it surely does, to many thinkers, as the rapid growth of the work shows. At no distant day, Christian healing will rank far in advance of allopathy [15] and homœopathy; for Truth must ultimately succeed where error fails.  Mind governs all. That we exist in God, perfect, there is no doubt, for the conceptions of Life, Truth, and Love must be perfect; and with that basic truth we con- [20] quer sickness, sin, and death. Frequently it requires time to overcome the patient’s faith in drugs and mate- rial hygiene; but when once convinced of the uselessness of such material methods, the gain is rapid.  It is a noticeable fact, that in families where laws [25] of health are strictly enforced, great caution is observed in regard to diet, and the conversation chiefly confined to the ailments of the body, there is the most sickness. Take a large family of children where the mother has all that she can attend to in keeping them clothed and fed, and health is generally the rule; whereas, in small families of one or two children, sickness is by no means  [Page 7.]"]]]
