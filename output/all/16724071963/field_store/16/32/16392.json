By applying this men- tal remedy or antidote directly to your belief, you scien-  [Page 45.]  tifically prove the fact that Mind is supreme. This is not [1] done by will-power, for that is not Science but mesmerism. The full understanding that God is Mind, and that mat- ter is but a belief, enables you to control pain. Chris- tian Science, by means of its Principle of metaphysical [5] healing, is able to do more than to heal a toothache; although its power to allay fear, prevent inflammation, and destroy the necessity for ether—thereby avoiding the fatal results that frequently follow the use of that drug—render this Science invaluable in the practice [10] of dentistry.  _Can an atheist or a profane man be cured by metaphysics,_ _or Christian Science?_  The moral status of the man demands the remedy of Truth more in this than in most cases; therefore, under [15] the deific law that supply invariably meets demand, this Science is effectual in treating moral ailments. Sin is not the master of divine Science, but _vice versa_; and when Science in a single instance decides the conflict, the patient is better both morally and physically. [20]  _If God made all that was made, and it was good, where_ _did evil originate?_  It never originated or existed as an entity. It is but a false belief; even the belief that God is not what the Scriptures imply Him to be, All-in-all, but that there [25] is an opposite intelligence or mind termed evil. This error of belief is idolatry, having “other gods before me.” In John i. 3 we read, “All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.”  [Page 46.]  The admission of the reality of evil perpetuates the belief [1] or faith in evil. The Scriptures declare, “To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are.” The leading self-evident proposition of Christian Science is: good being real, evil, good’s opposite, is unreal. This [5] truism needs only to be tested scientifically to be found true, and adapted to destroy the appearance of evil to an extent beyond the power of any doctrine previously entertained.  _Do you teach that you are equal with God?_ [10]  A reader of my writings would not present this ques- tion. There are no such indications in the premises or conclusions of Christian Science, and such a misconcep- tion of Truth is not scientific. Man is not equal with his Maker; that which is formed is not cause, but effect, [15] and has no power underived from its creator. It is pos- sible, and it is man’s duty, so to throw the weight of his thoughts and acts on the side of Truth, that he be ever found in the scale _with_ his creator; not weighing equally with Him, but comprehending at every point, in [20] divine Science, the full significance of what the apostle meant by the declaration, “The Spirit itself beareth wit- ness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.” In Science, man represents his divine Prin- [25] ciple,—the Life and Love that are God,—even as the idea of sound, in tones, represents harmony; but thought has not yet wholly attained unto the Science of being, wherein man is perfect even as the Father, his divine Principle, is perfect. [30]  [Page 47.]  _How can I believe that there is no such thing as matter,_ [1] _when I weigh over two hundred pounds and carry about_ _this weight daily?_  By learning that matter is but manifest mortal mind. You entertain an adipose belief of yourself as substance; [5] whereas, substance means more than matter: it is the glory and permanence of Spirit: it is that which is hoped for but unseen, that which the material senses cannot take in. Have you never been so preoccupied in thought when moving your body, that you did this with- [10] out consciousness of its weight? If never in your waking hours, you have been in your night-dreams; and these tend to elucidate your day-dream, or the mythical nature of matter, and the possibilities of mind when let loose from its own beliefs. In sleep, a sense of the body ac- [15] companies thought with less impediment than when awake, which is the truer sense of being. In Science, body is the servant of Mind, not its master: Mind is supreme. Science reverses the evidence of material sense with the spiritual sense that God, Spirit, is the only [20] substance; and that man, His image and likeness, is spiritual, not material. This great Truth does not de- stroy but substantiates man’s identity,—together with his immortality and preexistence, or his spiritual co- existence with his Maker. That which has a beginning [25] must have an ending.  _What should one conclude as to Professor Carpenter’s_ _exhibitions of mesmerism?_  That largely depends upon what one accepts as either useful or true. I have no knowledge of mesmerism, [30]  [Page 48.]  practically or theoretically, save as I measure its demon- [1] strations as a false belief, and avoid all that works ill. If mesmerism has the power attributed to it by the gentle- man referred to, it should neither be taught nor practised, but should be conscientiously condemned. One thing [5] is quite apparent; namely, that its so-called power is despotic, and Mr. Carpenter deserves praise for his public exposure of it. If such be its power, I am opposed to it, as to every form of error,—whether of ignorance or fanaticism, prompted by money-making or malice. It [10] is enough for me to know that animal magnetism is neither of God nor Science.  It is alleged that at one of his recent lectures in Bos- ton Mr. Carpenter made a man drunk on water, and then informed his audience that he could produce the [15] effect of alcohol, or of any drug, on the human system, through the action of mind alone. This honest declara- tion as to the animus of animal magnetism and the pos- sible purpose to which it can be devoted, has, we trust, been made in season to open the eyes of the people to the [20] hidden nature of some tragic events and sudden deaths at this period.  _Was ever a person made insane by studying meta-_ _physics?_  Such an occurrence would be impossible, for the [25] proper study of Mind-healing would cure the insane. That persons have gone away from the Massachusetts Metaphysical College “made insane by Mrs. Eddy’s teachings,” like a hundred other stories, is a baseless fabrication offered solely to injure her or her school. [30] The enemy is trying to make capital out of the follow-  [Page 49.]  ing case. A young lady entered the College class who, [1] I quickly saw, had a tendency to monomania, and re- quested her to withdraw before its close. We are cred- ibly informed that, before entering the College, this young lady had manifested some mental unsoundness, [5] and have no doubt she could have been restored by Christian Science treatment. Her friends employed a homœopathist, who had the skill and honor to state, as his opinion given to her friends, that “Mrs. Eddy’s teach- ings had not produced insanity.” This is the only case [10] that could be distorted into the claim of insanity ever having occurred in a class of Mrs. Eddy’s; while ac- knowledged and notable cases of insanity have been cured in her class.  _If all that is mortal is a dream or error, is not_ [15] _our capacity for formulating a dream, real; is it not_ _God-made; and if God-made, can it be wrong, sinful, or_ _an error?_  The spirit of Truth leads into all truth, and enables man to discern between the real and the unreal. Enter- [20] taining the common belief in the opposite of goodness, and that evil is as real as good, opposes the leadings of the divine Spirit that are helping man Godward: it pre- vents a recognition of the nothingness of the dream, or belief, that Mind is in matter, intelligence in non-intel- [25] ligence, sin, and death. This belief presupposes not only a power opposed to God, and that God is not All- in-all, as the Scriptures imply Him to be, but that the capacity to err proceeds from God.  That God is Truth, the Scriptures aver; that Truth [30] never created error, or such a capacity, is self-evident;  [Page 50.]  that God made all that was made, is again Scriptural; [1] therefore your answer is, that error is an illusion of mortals; that God is not its author, and it cannot be real.  _Does __“__Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures__”_ [5] _explain the entire method of metaphysical healing, or is_ _there a secret back of what is contained in that book, as_ _some say?_  “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures” is a complete textbook of Christian Science; and its [10] metaphysical method of healing is as lucid in presenta- tion as can be possible, under the necessity to express the metaphysical in physical terms. There is absolutely no additional secret outside of its teachings, or that gives one the power to heal; but it is essential that the student [15] gain the spiritual understanding of the contents of this book, in order to heal.  _Do you believe in change of heart?_  We do believe, and understand—which is more— that there must be a change from human affections, de- [20] sires, and aims, to the divine standard, “Be ye therefore perfect;” also, that there must be a change from the be- lief that the heart is matter and sustains life, to the understanding that God is our Life, that we exist in Mind, live thereby, and have being. This change of [25] heart would deliver man from heart-disease, and ad- vance Christianity a hundredfold. The human affections need to be changed from self to benevolence and love for God and man; changed to having but _one_ God and loving Him supremely, and helping our brother man. [30]  [Page 51.]  This change of heart is essential to Christianity, and [1] will have its effect physically as well as spiritually, healing disease. Burnt offerings and drugs, God does not require.  _Is a belief of nervousness, accompanied by great mental_ ["]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3144"],["title","Froude's History of England (#0)"],["body","from “Plays and Puritans and Other Historical Essays” 1890 Macmillan and Co. edition by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org                          FROUDE’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND {219}   THERE appeared a few years since a ‘Comic History of England,’ duly caricaturing and falsifying all our great national events, and representing the English people, for many centuries back, as a mob of fools and knaves, led by the nose in each generation by a few arch-fools and arch-knaves.  Some thoughtful persons regarded the book with utter contempt and indignation; it seemed to them a crime to have written it; a proof of ‘banausia,’ as Aristotle would have called it, only to be outdone by the writing a ‘Comic Bible.’  After a while, however, their indignation began to subside; their second thoughts, as usual, were more charitable than their first; they were not surprised to hear that the author was an honest, just, and able magistrate; they saw that the publication of such a book involved no moral turpitude; that it was merely meant as a jest on a subject on which jesting was permissible, and as a money speculation in a field of which men had a right to make money; while all which seemed offensive in it was merely the outcome, and as it were apotheosis, of that method of writing English history which has been popular for nearly a hundred years.  ‘Which of our modern historians,’ they asked themselves, ‘has had any real feeling of the importance, the sacredness, of his subject?—any real trust in, or respect for, the characters with whom he dealt?  Has not the belief of each and all of them been the same—that on the whole, the many always have been fools and knaves; foolish and knavish enough, at least, to become the puppets of a few fools and knaves who held the reins of power?  Have they not held that, on the whole, the problems of human nature and human history have been sufficiently solved by Gibbon and Voltaire, Gil Blas and Figaro; that our forefathers were silly barbarians; that this glorious nineteenth century is the one region of light, and that all before was outer darkness, peopled by ‘foreign devils,’ Englishmen, no doubt, according to the flesh, but in spirit, in knowledge, in creed, in customs, so utterly different from ourselves that we shall merely show our sentimentalism by doing aught but laughing at them?  On what other principle have our English histories as yet been constructed, even down to the children’s books, which taught us in childhood that the history of this country was nothing but a string of foolish wars, carried on by wicked kings, for reasons hitherto unexplained, save on that great historic law of Goldsmith’s by which Sir Archibald Alison would still explain the French Revolution—      ‘The dog, to serve his private ends,     Went mad, and bit the man?’  It will be answered by some, and perhaps rather angrily, that these strictures are too sweeping; that there is arising, in a certain quarter, a school of history books for young people of a far more reverent tone, which tries to do full honour to the Church and her work in the world. Those books of this school which we have seen, we must reply, seem just as much wanting in real reverence for the past as the school of Gibbon and Voltaire.  It is not the past which they reverence, but a few characters or facts eclectically picked out of the past, and, for the most part, made to look beautiful by ignoring all the features which will not suit their preconceived pseudo-ideal.  There is in these books a scarcely concealed dissatisfaction with the whole course of the British mind since the Reformation, and (though they are not inclined to confess the fact) with its whole course before the Reformation, because that course was one of steady struggle against the Papacy and its anti-national pretensions.  They are the outcome of an utterly un-English tone of thought; and the so-called ‘ages of faith’ are pleasant and useful to them, principally because they are distant and unknown enough to enable them to conceal from their readers that in the ages on which they look back as ideally perfect a Bernard and a Francis of Assisi were crying all day long—‘O that my head were a fountain of tears, that I might weep for the sins of my people!’  Dante was cursing popes and prelates in the name of the God of Righteousness; Boccaccio and Chaucer were lifting the veil from priestly abominations of which we now are ashamed even to read; and Wolsey, seeing the rottenness of the whole system, spent his mighty talents, and at last poured out his soul unto death, in one long useless effort to make the crooked straight, and number that which had been weighed in the balances of God, and found for ever wanting.  To ignore wilfully facts like these, which were patent all along to the British nation, facts on which the British laity acted, till they finally conquered at the Reformation, and on which they are acting still, and will, probably, act for ever, is not to have any real reverence for the opinions or virtues of our forefathers; and we are not astonished to find repeated, in such books, the old stock calumnies against our lay and Protestant worthies, taken at second-hand from the pages of Lingard.  In copying from Lingard, however, this party has done no more than those writers have who would repudiate any party—almost any Christian—purpose.  Lingard is known to have been a learned man, and to have examined many manuscripts which few else had taken the trouble to look at; so his word is to be taken, no one thinking it worth while to ask whether he has either honestly read or honestly quoted the documents. It suited the sentimental and lazy liberality of the last generation to make a show of fairness by letting the Popish historian tell his side of the story, and to sneer at the illiberal old notion that gentlemen of his class were given to be rather careless about historic truth when they had a purpose to serve thereby; and Lingard is now actually recommended as a standard authority for the young by educated Protestants, who seem utterly unable to see that, whether the man be honest or not, his whole view of the course of British events since Becket first quarrelled with his king must be antipodal to their own; and that his account of all which has passed for three hundred years since the fall of Wolsey is most likely to be (and, indeed, may be proved to be) one huge libel on the whole nation, and the destiny which God has marked out for it.  There is, indeed, no intrinsic cause why the ecclesiastical, or pseudo-Catholic, view of history should, in any wise, conduce to a just appreciation of our forefathers.  For not only did our forefathers rebel against that conception again and again, till they finally trampled it under their feet, and so appear, _primâ facie_, as offenders to be judged at its bar; but the conception itself is one which takes the very same view of nature as that cynic conception of which we spoke above.  Man, with the Romish divines, is, _ipso facto_, the same being as the man of Voltaire, Le Sage, or Beaumarchais; he is an insane and degraded being, who is to be kept in order, and, as far as may be, cured and set to work by an ecclesiastical system; and the only threads of light in the dark web of his history are clerical and theurgic, not lay and human. Voltaire is the very _experimentum crucis_ of this ugly fact.  European history looks to him what it would have looked to his Jesuit preceptors, had the sacerdotal element in it been wanting; what heathen history actually did look to them.  He eliminates the sacerdotal element, and nothing remains but the chaos of apes and wolves which the Jesuits had taught him to believe was the original substratum of society.  The humanity of his history—even of his ‘Pucelle d’Orléans’,—is simply the humanity of Sanchez and the rest of those _vingtquatre Pères_ who hang gibbeted for ever in the pages of Pascal.  He is superior to his teachers, certainly, in this, that he has hope for humanity on earth; dreams of a new and nobler life for society, by means of a true and scientific knowledge of the laws of the moral and material universe; in a word, he has, in the midst of all his filth and his atheism, a faith in a righteous and truth-revealing God, which the priests who brought him up had not.  Let the truth be spoken, even though in favour of such a destroying Azrael as Voltaire.  And what if his primary conception of humanity be utterly base?  Is that of our modern historians so much higher?  Do Christian men seem to them, on the whole, in all ages, to have had the spirit of God with them, leading them into truth, however imperfectly and confusedly they may have learnt his lessons?  Have they ever heard with their ears, or listened when their fathers have declared unto them, the noble works which God did in their days, and in the old time before them?  Do they believe that the path of Christendom has been, on the whole, the path of life and the right way, and that the living God is leading her therein?  Are they proud of the old British worthies?  Are they jealous and tender of the reputation of their ancestors?  Do they believe that there were any worthies at all in England before the steam-engine and political economy were discovered?  Do their conceptions of past society and the past generations retain anything of that great thought which is common to all the Aryan races—that is, to all races who have left aught behind them better than mere mounds of earth—to Hindoo and Persian, Greek and Roman, Teuton and Scandinavian, that men are the sons of the heroes, who were the sons of God?  Or do they believe that for civilised people of the nineteenth century it is as well to say as little as possible about ancestors who possessed our vices without our amenities, our ignorance without our science; who were bred, no matter how, like flies by summer heat, out of that everlasting midden which men call the "]]]
