He winked at me.  Such a gasp went up as we changed places that I thought my cuff must have brushed Pluto, but it was just Meadows making a long-odds hop from Earth to Uranus. The operator no longer even flinched before punching the distances and bet on his little computer, and groping in his cash drawer to pay off.         *       *       *       *       *  I stood there a few minutes, wondering if the game could be fixed after all. Still, the man who invented it also made encoding machines for the Earth space fleet. Meadows must be having a run of blind luck--no time to interrupt.  On my way out, Howlet caught me at the door of the bar.  \"How about some coffee?\" he asked. \"We'll have to start back soon. You'll be surprised at the time. Dining room still open?\"  \"Always. Okay, let's sober up and watch the fountain.\"  Only two or three women and a dozen men sat in the restaurant now. The part-time musicians had disappeared for a few hours of sleep before their usual jobs. We ordered a thermos pot of coffee and Howlet asked me about McNaughton.  \"I guess it was on the level,\" he said when I described the man's Committee position. \"He got a boost out of how they had to patch up some troublemaker he knew, after that bar fight we had. Wanted to make me chief cop here.\"  \"Some domes have regular police forces already,\" I confirmed.  \"So he said. Claimed a lot of police chiefs have been elected as mayors. Then he said that someday there will be a Martian Assembly, and men with a start in dome politics will be ready for it, and so on.\"  \"He's exactly right,\" I admitted. \"When do you figure to start?\"  \"Maybe the next time I pass through.\" He winked. \"If it's still open.\"  I relaxed and grinned at him. Somehow, I liked his looks just then.  \"You shouldn't be gone too long. It's a good spot to put your ladder down.\"  He helped himself to more coffee and stared into his cup. I knew--the watches near the end of a hop when you wondered about the dead, oily air, when the ones off watch kept watching the astrogator's expression, when you got the idea it was time to come in out of the dark before you made that one slip.  _How many pick their landing?_ I thought. _How many never know how close they come to making their mistake, or being a statistic in somebody else's?_  \"Why the double trance?\" asked Meadows.  He brought with him a vague memory of departing chatter and tramping feet in the background. Howlet shoved out a chair for him.  \"Everything okay?\" asked Jorgensen, bustling up. \"Buy anyone a drink?\"  \"What have they got there ... coffee?\" asked Meadows, sniffing.  \"Jimmy!\" yelled Jorgensen to a waiter. \"Pot of coffee for Ron! Hot!\"  He slapped Meadows' shoulder and took his glowing red face away.  \"What makes him your buddy?\" I asked Meadows.  \"In the end, I missed Mercury by ten inches and they got most of it back!\"  Then was no answer to that. He must have been half a million ahead.  \"What about the sandeaters you promised to stake?\" asked Howlet, grinning like a man who has seen it happen before but still enjoys it.  \"Some of them helped me lose it,\" said Meadows. \"Now they will all just have to use those tickets, I suppose. Where's Hughie and his little friend? Coffee all around and we'll get on course, eh?\"  \"Thought he was with you,\" answered Howlet.  \"I'll look in the bar,\" I volunteered, remembering the kid had left with more of a roll than Meadows had now.  A casual search of the bar and back room revealed both nearly empty, a natural condition just before dawn. No one had seen Konnel, apparently, so I went outside and squinted along the dim, narrow street. Four or five drunks, none tall enough to be Konnel, were slowly and softly singing their way home. The door slid open behind me and the other two came out quickly.  \"Oh, there you are! I asked around too,\" said Howlet in a low voice. \"Can you trust that Jorgensen? They wouldn't let me in the office behind the back room.\"  \"He's a better sport than he looks,\" I said.  \"I wonder,\" murmured Meadows. \"He looked queer when I was so far ahead. Or maybe one of his huskies got ideas about keeping a handy hostage....\"  Howlet suddenly looked dangerous. I gathered that he thought something of the boy, and was heating up to the door-smashing stage.  \"Let's check one other place,\" I suggested, \"before we make a mistake.\"         *       *       *       *       *  My starting off fast up the street left him the choice of coming quietly or staying to wonder. They both came. I could feel them watching me.  I turned right into a narrow street, went along it about fifty yards, and paused where it was crossed by a still narrower alley. Hoping I remembered the way, I groped along the lefthand branch of the alley. A trace of light had begun to soften the sky over the dome, but had not yet seeped down to ground level.  Howlet's soft footsteps trailed me. I knocked on what seemed to be the right door. There was no answer--only to be expected. I hammered again.  \"No one aboard, it would appear,\" murmured Meadows.  It was meant as a question. I shrugged in the darkness and banged longer and louder. Finally, listening at the flimsy panel, I detected muffled footsteps.  The door opened a crack.  \"It's Tony Lewis, Lilac.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The black opening widened, until she must have seen the two behind me. She wore a thin robe that glimmered silver in the dim light.  \"Send the boy out, Lilac,\" I said.  \"Why should I?\"  That much was good; she might have pretended not to have him there.  \"He has to catch his ship, Lilac.\"  Behind me, I heard Howlet stir uneasily. The door began to close, but my foot was in the track. Howlet could not see that.  \"Don't shut it, sister,\" he said, \"or we'll smash it down!\"  He could have too, in about ten seconds, the way they build on Mars.  \"You wanna get yourself lynched?\" Lilac warned him.  \"Over a--on account of _you_?\"  \"Shut up, Howlet!\" I interrupted. \"Let me talk to the lady alone!\"  He must have understood my tone; he let Meadows pull him away a few steps.  \"And less of the 'lady' business outa _you_,\" said Lilac, but low enough to keep it private. \"We both know Mars, so let's take things the way they are.\"  \"That's why I came, Lilac. Taking things that way means he has to go.\"  \"What're you gonna say? He has a job to do, or some such canal dust?\"  \"Not exactly. They might pick up another third pilot. They might manage somehow without any. But he won't like himself much, later, for missing his chance.\"  She swung the edge of the door back and forth in impatient little jerks. Finally, she took her hand off the latch and let it roll free. She still blocked the opening, however, and I waited.  \"Look, Tony,\" she said after a pause, \"what makes you think I couldn't settle down with him? I never figured to be an ... entertainer ... all my life. With the stake I already got together, we could start something. A mine, maybe, or a tractor service like yours. Mars is growing--\"  \"Pull your head inside the dome and breathe right!\" I snapped at her. \"I don't mind your dreaming, Lilac, but there isn't any more time.\"  It was light enough now to see her stiffen. She glared at me.  \"You tryin' to say I couldn't make a home here? You know better, Tony. Some of the best known women on Mars didn't exactly come here first-class!\"  I held up my hand. She was beginning to get loud.  \"It wouldn't matter if you were a princess. It's not what he'd think of you; it's what he'd wonder about himself, piloting a sand-buggy instead of a rocket.\"  In the alley, one of the spacers shuffled his feet impatiently. I hurried on, hoping to clinch it before she turned stubborn.  \"_You_, at least, ought to understand men better than most, Lilac. Maybe it doesn't make sense, but it would be smarter to grab him after he's had his share of space instead of before.\"  It was hard to breathe without sounding loud in the stillness. Just as I had to swallow or choke, Lilac's shoulders slumped an inch or two.  \"I'll wake him up,\" she said in a tired voice.  Feeling as if I had struck her, I stepped back into the alley. A few minutes later, Konnel slipped out and shut the door behind him. No one said a word. From the set of his shoulders, it seemed that he might be just as glad the alley was dim; but he simply trailed along behind.         *       *       *       *       *  We walked back to Number Four Airlock in a silence that had me counting the footsteps. When we reached the tractor parking lot, I cleared my throat.  \"Wait a minute. I'll warm up my sand-saucer and give you a lift to your ship.\"  \"Maybe we won't need to impose on you any more, Tony,\" said Howlet. \"Looks like those machines over there are going out.\"  I followed his gesture and, by luck, caught the eye of a driver I knew. I waved and jerked my thumb at the spacers beside me.  \"Let's go!\" said Howlet as the tractor slowed. \"Thanks for everything, Tony. Get yourself some sleep; the night watches in these domes are rough.\"  Konnel waited until they were a few steps away. Even then, he hesitated.  \"Forget it!\" I said. \"You aren't the first spacer they had to pump out of some odd corner. Look me up when you get back!\"  He shook hands and trotted after his friends. They scrambled up the ladder to the cab. The tractor picked up speed, lumbering into the airlock.  Later, a little after noon, I crawled out of bed and watched the flare of their pipes as the ship streaked up into the dark Martian sky. I hoped they would make it--almost as much as I wished it could have been me.  Well, I still come out to the wall of whatever dome I find myself in, to watch the sky a while--not that I'll see _those_ boys coming down at this late date! They must have splattered to a puddle on Jupiter, or slipped back into the sun, or taken up a cold, dark orbit out where they'll never bother anyone.

No, of course I don't feel funny about it. If they weren't the ones, it would have been another crew. By the law of averages, a certain number of bad tries seems to go with every new push out into space. Maybe there's no reason it has to be like that, but it always has. When the bad luck is used up, someone makes a new frontier.  Why say \"superstition\"? Each new orbit out from the sun has cost plenty in money, ships, and lives; it's the admission price.  Sure, it was too bad about Konnel and his little girl--who, by the way, later married a very important man in Asaph Dome. It would have been nice to see Meadows wind up rich, or for Howlet to become mayor of the dome, but what could I do? Which one should I have talked into staying for the sake of love or money or power, without even being able to go in his place?  Every time Man pushes ahead a little, a percentage of the pushers pay the fare. Still, it will be healthier if we push out of this planetary system before someone else pushes in.  For all we know, they may be on the way.  THE END         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
