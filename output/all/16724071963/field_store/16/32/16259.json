It being her     intention, then, that such trustees as she appointed would use for     your benefit the interest accruing annually from the capital at     command, _and that only_ (as specifically directed in the will), so     that on your arriving at full age the capital entrusted to us should     be handed over to you intact, I find a hard-and-fast duty in the     matter of adhering exactly to the directions given.  I have no doubt     that my co-trustees regard the matter in exactly the same light.     Under the circumstances, therefore, we, the trustees, have not only a     single and united duty towards you as the object of the testator's     wishes, but towards each other as regards the manner of the carrying     out of that duty.  I take it, therefore, that it would not be     consonant with the spirit of the trust or of our own ideas in     accepting it that any of us should take a course pleasant to himself     which would or might involve a stern opposition on the part of other     of the co-trustees.  We have each of us to do the unpleasant part of     this duty without fear or favour.  You understand, of course, that     the time which must elapse before you come into absolute possession     of your estate is a limited one.  As by the terms of the will we are     to hand over our trust when you have reached the age of twenty-one,     there are only seven years to expire.  But till then, though I should     gladly meet your wishes if I could, I must adhere to the duty which I     have undertaken.  At the expiration of that period you will be quite     free to divest yourself of your estate without protest or comment of     any man.      Having now expressed as clearly as I can the limitations by which I     am bound with regard to the corpus of your estate, let me say that in     any other way which is in my power or discretion I shall be most     happy to see your wishes carried out so far as rests with me.     Indeed, I shall undertake to use what influence I may possess with my     co-trustees to induce them to take a similar view of your wishes.  In     my own thinking you are quite free to use your own property in your     own way.  But as, until you shall have attained your majority, you     have only life-user in your mother's bequest, you are only at liberty     to deal with the annual increment.  On our part as trustees we have a     first charge on that increment to be used for purposes of your     maintenance, clothes, and education.  As to what may remain over each     half-year, you will be free to deal with it as you choose.  On     receiving from you a written authorization to your trustees, if you     desire the whole sum or any part of it to be paid over to Miss Janet     MacKelpie, I shall see that it is effected.  Believe me, that our     duty is to protect the corpus of the estate, and to this end we may     not act on any instruction to imperil it.  But there our warranty     stops.  We can deal during our trusteeship with the corpus only.     Further, lest there should arise any error on your part, we can deal     with any general instruction for only so long as it may remain     unrevoked.  You are, and must be, free to alter your instructions or     authorizations at any time.  Thus your latest document must be used     for our guidance.      As to the general principle involved in your wish I make no comment.     You are at liberty to deal with your own how you will.  I quite     understand that your impulse is a generous one, and I fully believe     that it is in consonance with what had always been the wishes of my     sister.  Had she been happily alive and had to give judgment of your     intent, I am convinced that she would have approved.  Therefore, my     dear nephew, should you so wish, I shall be happy for her sake as     well as your own to pay over on your account (as a confidential     matter between you and me), but from my own pocket, a sum equal to     that which you wish transferred to Miss Janet MacKelpie.  On hearing     from you I shall know how to act in the matter.  With all good     wishes,                                                           Believe me to be,                                                   Your affectionate uncle,                                                              ROGER MELTON.      TO RUPERT SENT LEGER, ESQ.  _Letter from Rupert Sent Leger to Roger Melton_,                                                             _July_ 5, 1892.      MY DEAR UNCLE,      Thank you heartily for your kind letter.  I quite understand, and now     see that I should not have asked you as a trustee, such a thing.  I     see your duty clearly, and agree with your view of it.  I enclose a     letter directed to my trustees, asking them to pay over annually till     further direction to Miss Janet MacKelpie at this address whatever     sum may remain over from the interest of my mother's bequest after     deduction of such expenses as you may deem fit for my maintenance,     clothing, and education, together with a sum of one pound sterling     per month, which was the amount my dear mother always gave me for my     personal use--\"pocket-money,\" she called it.      With regard to your most kind and generous offer to give to my dear     Aunt Janet the sum which I would have given myself, had such been in     my power, I thank you most truly and sincerely, both for my dear aunt     (to whom, of course, I shall not mention the matter unless you     specially authorize me) and myself.  But, indeed, I think it will be     better not to offer it.  Aunt Janet is very proud, and would not     accept any benefit.  With me, of course, it is different, for since I     was a wee child she has been like another mother to me, and I love     her very much.  Since my mother died--and she, of course, was     all-in-all to me--there has been no other.  And in such a love as     ours pride has no place.  Thank you again, dear uncle, and God bless     you.                                                         Your loving nephew,                                                         RUPERT SENT LEGER.    ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD--_Continued_.   And now _re_ the remaining one of Sir Geoffrey's children, Roger.  He was the third child and third son, the only daughter, Patience, having been born twenty years after the last of the four sons.  Concerning Roger, I shall put down all I have heard of him from my father and grandfather. From my grand-aunt I heard nothing, I was a very small kid when she died; but I remember seeing her, but only once.  A very tall, handsome woman of a little over thirty, with very dark hair and light-coloured eyes.  I think they were either grey or blue, but I can't remember which.  She looked very proud and haughty, but I am bound to say that she was very nice to me.  I remember feeling very jealous of Rupert because his mother looked so distinguished.  Rupert was eight years older than me, and I was afraid he would beat me if I said anything he did not like.  So I was silent except when I forgot to be, and Rupert said very unkindly, and I think very unfairly, that I was \"A sulky little beast.\"  I haven't forgot that, and I don't mean to.  However, it doesn't matter much what he said or thought.  There he is--if he is at all--where no one can find him, with no money or nothing, for what little he had he settled when he came of age, on the MacSkelpie.  He wanted to give it to her when his mother died, but father, who was a trustee, refused; and Uncle Roger, as I call him, who is another, thought the trustees had no power to allow Rupert to throw away his matrimony, as I called it, making a joke to father when he called it patrimony.  Old Sir Colin MacSkelpie, who is the third, said he couldn't take any part in such a permission, as the MacSkelpie was his niece.  He is a rude old man, that.  I remember when, not remembering his relationship, I spoke of the MacSkelpie, he caught me a clip on the ear that sent me across the room.  His Scotch is very broad.  I can hear him say, \"Hae some attempt at even Soothern manners, and dinna misca' yer betters, ye young puddock, or I'll wring yer snoot!\"  Father was, I could see, very much offended, but he didn't say anything.  He remembered, I think, that the General is a V.C. man, and was fond of fighting duels. But to show that the fault was not his, _he_ wrung _my_ ear--and the same ear too!  I suppose he thought that was justice!  But it's only right to say that he made up for it afterwards.  When the General had gone he gave me a five-pound note.  I don't think Uncle Roger was very pleased with the way Rupert behaved about the legacy, for I don't think he ever saw him from that day to this.  Perhaps, of course, it was because Rupert ran away shortly afterwards; but I shall tell about that when I come to him.  After all, why should my uncle bother about him?  He is not a Melton at all, and I am to be Head of the House--of course, when the Lord thinks right to take father to Himself!  Uncle Roger has tons of money, and he never married, so if he wants to leave it in the right direction he needn't have any trouble.  He made his money in what he calls \"the Eastern Trade.\"  This, so far as I can gather, takes in the Levant and all east of it.  I know he has what they call in trade \"houses\" in all sorts of places--Turkey, and Greece, and all round them, Morocco, Egypt, and Southern Russia, and the Holy Land; then on to Persia, India, and all round it; the Chersonese, China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands.  It is not to be expected that we landowners can know much about trade, but my uncle covers--or alas! I must say \"covered\"--a lot of ground, I can tell you. Uncle Roger was a very grim sort of man, and only that I was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],["title","The Lady of the Shroud (#4)"],["body"," up to try and be kind to him I shouldn't ever have dared to speak to him. But when was a child father and mother--especially mother--forced me to go and see him and be affectionate to him.  He wasn't ever even civil to me, that I can remember--grumpy old bear!  But, then, he never saw Rupert at all, so that I take it Master R--- is out of the running altogether for testamentary honours.  The last time I saw him myself he was distinctly rude.  He treated me as a boy, though I was getting on for eighteen years of age.  I came into his office without knocking; and without looking up from his desk, where he was writing, he said: \"Get out!  Why do you venture to disturb me when I'm busy?  Get out, and be damned to you!\"  I waited where I was, ready to transfix him with my eye when he should look up, for I cannot forget that when my father dies I shall be Head of my House.  But when he did there was no transfixing possible.  He said quite coolly:  \"Oh, it's you, is it?  I thought it was one of my office boys.  Sit down, if you want to see me, and wait till I am ready.\"  So I sat down and waited.  Father always said that I should try to conciliate and please my uncle.  Father is a very shrewd man, and Uncle Roger is a very rich one.  But I don't think Uncle R--- is as shrewd as he thinks he is.  He sometimes makes awful mistakes in business.  For instance, some years ago he bought an enormous estate on the Adriatic, in the country they call the \"Land of Blue Mountains.\"  At least, he says he bought it.  He told father so in confidence.  But he didn't show any title-deeds, and I'm greatly afraid he was \"had.\"  A bad job for me that he was, for father believes he paid an enormous sum for it, and as I am his natural heir, it reduces his available estate to so much less.  And now about Rupert.  As I have said, he ran away when he was about fourteen, and we did not hear about him for years.  When we--or, rather, my father--did hear of him, it was no good that he heard.  He had gone as a cabin-boy on a sailing ship round the Horn.  Then he joined an exploring party through the centre of Patagonia, and then another up in Alaska, and a third to the Aleutian Islands.  After that he went through Central America, and then to Western Africa, the Pacific Islands, India, and a lot of places.  We all know the wisdom of the adage that \"A rolling stone gathers no moss\"; and certainly, if there be any value in moss, Cousin Rupert will die a poor man.  Indeed, nothing will stand his idiotic, boastful wastefulness.  Look at the way in which, when he came of age, he made over all his mother's little fortune to the MacSkelpie! I am sure that, though Uncle Roger made no comment to my father, who, as Head of our House, should, of course, have been informed, he was not pleased.  My mother, who has a good fortune in her own right, and has had the sense to keep it in her own control--as I am to inherit it, and it is not in the entail, I am therefore quite impartial--I can approve of her spirited conduct in the matter.  We never did think much of Rupert, anyhow; but now, since he is in the way to be a pauper, and therefore a dangerous nuisance, we look on him as quite an outsider.  We know what he really is.  For my own part, I loathe and despise him.  Just now we are irritated with him, for we are all kept on tenterhooks regarding my dear Uncle Roger's Will.  For Mr. Trent, the attorney who regulated my dear uncle's affairs and has possession of the Will, says it is necessary to know where every possible beneficiary is to be found before making the Will public, so we all have to wait.  It is especially hard on me, who am the natural heir.  It is very thoughtless indeed of Rupert to keep away like that.  I wrote to old MacSkelpie about it, but he didn't seem to understand or to be at all anxious--he is not the heir!  He said that probably Rupert Sent Leger--he, too, keeps to the old spelling--did not know of his uncle's death, or he would have taken steps to relieve our anxiety.  Our anxiety, forsooth!  We are not anxious; we only wish to _know_.  And if we--and especially me--who have all the annoyance of thinking of the detestable and unfair death-duties, are anxious, we should be so.  Well, anyhow, he'll get a properly bitter disappointment and set down when he does turn up and discovers that he is a pauper without hope!                                  * * * * *  To-day we (father and I) had letters from Mr. Trent, telling us that the whereabouts of \"Mr. Rupert Sent Leger\" had been discovered, and that a letter disclosing the fact of poor Uncle Roger's death had been sent to him.  He was at Titicaca when last heard of.  So goodness only knows when he may get the letter, which \"asks him to come home at once, but only gives to him such information about the Will as has already been given to every member of the testator's family.\"  And that is nil.  I dare say we shall be kept waiting for months before we get hold of the estate which is ours.  It is too bad!  _Letter from Edward Bingham Trent to Ernest Roger Halbard Melton_.                                                  176, LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS,                                                       _December_ 28, 1906.      DEAR SIR,      I am glad to be able to inform you that I have just heard by letter     from Mr. Rupert St. Leger that he intended leaving Rio de Janeiro by     the S.S. _Amazon_, of the Royal Mail Company, on December 15.  He     further stated that he would cable just before leaving Rio de     Janeiro, to say on what day the ship was expected to arrive in     London.  As all the others possibly interested in the Will of the     late Roger Melton, and whose names are given to me in his     instructions regarding the reading of the Will, have been advised,     and have expressed their intention of being present at that event on     being apprised of the time and place, I now beg to inform you that by     cable message received the date scheduled for arrival at the Port of     London was January 1 prox.  I therefore beg to notify you, subject to     postponement due to the non-arrival of the _Amazon_, the reading of     the Will of the late Roger Melton, Esq., will take place in my office     on Thursday, January 3 prox., at eleven o'clock a.m.                                               I have the honour to be, sir,                                                          Yours faithfully,                                                      EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT.

ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD.                                                           _January_ 4, 1907.  The reading of Uncle Roger's Will is over.  Father got a duplicate of Mr. Trent's letter to me, and of the cable and two telegrams pasted into this Record.  We both waited patiently till the third--that is, we did not say anything.  The only impatient member of our family was my mother.  She _did_ say things, and if old Trent had been here his ears would have been red.  She said what ridiculous nonsense it was delaying the reading of the Will, and keeping the Heir waiting for the arrival of an obscure person who wasn't even a member of the family, inasmuch as he didn't bear the name.  I don't think it's quite respectful to one who is some day to be Head of the House!  I thought father was weakening in his patience when he said: \"True, my dear--true!\" and got up and left the room.  Some time afterwards when I passed the library I heard him walking up and down.  Father and I went up to town on the afternoon of Wednesday, January 2. We stayed, of course, at Claridge's, where we always stay when we go to town.  Mother wanted to come, too, but father thought it better not.  She would not agree to stay at home till we both promised to send her separate telegrams after the reading.  At five minutes to eleven we entered Mr. Trent's office.  Father would not go a moment earlier, as he said it was bad form to seem eager at any time, but most of all at the reading of a will.  It was a rotten grind, for we had to be walking all over the neighbourhood for half an hour before it was time, not to be too early.  When we went into the room we found there General Sir Colin MacKelpie and a big man, very bronzed, whom I took to be Rupert St. Leger--not a very creditable connection to look at, I thought!  He and old MacKelpie took care to be in time!  Rather low, I thought it.  Mr. St. Leger was reading a letter.  He had evidently come in but lately, for though he seemed to be eager about it, he was only at the first page, and I could see that there were many sheets.  He did not look up when we came in, or till he had finished the letter; and you may be sure that neither I nor my father (who, as Head of the House, should have had more respect from him) took the trouble to go to him.  After all, he is a pauper and a wastrel, and he has not the honour of bearing our Name.  The General, however, came forward and greeted us both cordially.  He evidently had forgotten--or pretended to have--the discourteous way he once treated me, for he spoke to me quite in a friendly way--I thought more warmly than he did to father.  I was pleased to be spoken to so nicely,"]]]
