Then one step leads to another, power gets more and more centralized and it isn't long before you have the total state back again. Only this total state could _never_ be overthrown!\"  Elena Casimir bit her lip. A stray breeze slid down the rock wall and rumpled her bright hair. After a long while she said, \"Maybe you're right. But America today has, on the whole, a good government. You could let them know.\"  \"Too risky. Sooner or later someone, probably with very idealistic motives, would force the whole thing into the open. So we're keeping hidden the very fact that our most important equations exist--which is why we didn't ask for help when Meade's detectives finally learned that they know.\"  \"How do you know your precious Institute won't become just such an oligarchy as you describe?\"  \"I don't,\" Simon said, \"but it's improbable. You see, the recruits who are eventually taught everything we know are pretty thoroughly indoctrinated with our own present-day beliefs. And we've learned enough individual psych to do some real indoctrinating! They'll pass it on to the next generation and so on.  \"Meanwhile we hope the social structure and the mental climate is being modified in such a way that eventually it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to impose absolute control by any means. For as I said before, even an ultimately developed psychodynamics can't do everything. Ordinary propaganda, for instance, is quite ineffective on people trained in critical thinking.  \"When enough people the world over are sane we can make the knowledge general. Meanwhile we've got to keep it under wraps and quietly prevent anyone else from learning the same things independently. Most such prevention, by the way, consists merely of recruiting promising researchers into our own ranks.\"  \"The world's too big,\" she said very softly. \"You can't foresee all that'll happen. Too many things could go wrong.\"  \"Maybe. It's a chance we've got to take.\" His own gaze was somber.  They sat for awhile in stillness. Then she said, \"It all sounds very pretty. But--what are you, Dalgetty?\"  \"Simon,\" he corrected.  \"What are you?\" she repeated. \"You've done things I wouldn't have believed were possible. _Are you human?_\"  \"I'm told so.\" He smiled.  \"Yes? I wonder! How is it possible that you--\"  He wagged a finger. \"Ah-ah! Right of privacy.\" And with swift seriousness, \"You know too much already. I have to assume you can keep it secret all your life.\"  \"That remains to be seen,\" Elena said, not looking at him.   VII  Sundown burned across the waters and the island rose like a mountain of night against the darkening sky. Dalgetty stretched cramped muscles and peered over the bay.  In the hours of waiting there had not been much said between him and the woman. He had dropped a few questions, with the careful casualness of the skilled analyst, and gotten the expected reactions. He knew a little more about her--a child of the strangling dying cities and shadowy family life of the 1980's, forced to armor herself in harshness, finding in the long training for her work and now in the job itself an ideal to substitute for the tenderness she had never known.  He felt pity for her but there was little he could do to help just now. To her own queries he gave guarded replies. It occurred to him briefly that he was, in his way, as lonesome as she. _But of course I don't mind--or do I?_  Mostly they tried to plan their next move. For the time, at least, they were of one purpose. She described the layout of house and grounds and indicated the cell where Michael Tighe was ordinarily kept. But there was not much they could do to think out tactics. \"If Bancroft gets alarmed enough,\" she said, \"he'll have Dr. Tighe flown elsewhere.\"  He agreed. \"That's why we'd better hit tonight, before he can get that worried.\" The thought was pain within him. _Dad, what are they doing to you now?_  \"There's also the matter of food and drink.\" Her voice was husky with thirst and dull with the discouragement of hunger. \"We can't stay out here like this much longer.\" She gave him a strange glance. \"Don't you feel weak?\"  \"Not now,\" he said. He had blocked off the sensations.  \"They--_Simon!_\" She grabbed his arm. \"A boat--hear?\"  The murmur of jets drifted to him through the beating waves. \"Yeah. Quick--underneath!\"  They scrambled over the hogback and slid down its farther side. The sea clawed at Dalgetty's feet and foam exploded over his head. He hunched low, throwing one arm about her as she slipped. The airboat murmured overhead, hot gold in the sunset light. Dalgetty crouched, letting the breakers run coldly around him. The ledge where they clung was worn smooth, offered little to hold onto.  The boat circled, its jets thunderous at low speed. _They're worried about her now. They must be sure I'm still alive._  White water roared above his head. He breathed a hasty gasp of air before the next comber hit him. Their bodies were wholly submerged, their faces shouldn't show in that haze of foam--but the jet was soaring down and there would be machine-guns on it.  Dalgetty's belly muscles stiffened, waiting for the tracers to burn through him.  Elena's body slipped from his grasp and went under. He hung there, not daring to follow. A stolen glance upward--yes, the jet was out of sight again, moving back toward the field. He dove off the ledge and struck into the waves. The girl's head rose over them as he neared. She twisted from him and made her own way back to the rock. But when they were in the hollow again her teeth rattled with chill and she pressed against him for warmth.  \"Okay,\" he said shakily. \"Okay, we're all right now. You are hereby entitled to join our Pacific wet-erans' club.\"  Her laugh was small under the boom of breakers and hiss of scud. \"You're trying hard, aren't you?\"  \"I--_oh_, oh! Get _down_!\"  Peering over the edge Dalgetty saw the men descending the path. There were half a dozen, armed and wary. One had a WT radio unit on his back. In the shadow of the cliff they were almost invisible as they began prowling the beach.  \"Still hunting us!\" Her voice was a groan.  \"You didn't expect otherwise, did you? I'm just hoping they don't come out here. Does anybody else know of this spot?\" He held his lips close to her ear.  \"No, I don't believe so,\" she breathed. \"I was the only one who cared to go swimming at this end of the island. But....\"  Dalgetty waited, grimly. The sun was down at last, the twilight thickening. A few stars twinkled to life in the east. The goons finished their search and settled in a line along the beach.  \"Oh-oh,\" muttered Dalgetty. \"I get the idea. Bancroft's had the land beaten for me so thoroughly he's sure I must be somewhere out to sea. If I were he I'd guess I'd swum far out to be picked up by a waterboat. So--he's guarding every possible approach against a landing party.\"  \"What can we do?\" whispered Elena. \"Even if we can swim around their radius of sight we can't land just anywhere. Most of the island is vertical cliff. Or can you...?\"  \"No,\" he said. \"Regardless of what you may think I don't have vacuum cups on my feet. But how far does that gun of yours carry?\"  She stole a glance over the edge. Night was sweeping in. The island was a wall of blackness and the men at its foot were hidden. \"You can't _see_!\" she protested.  He squeezed her shoulder. \"Oh yes I can, honey. But whether I'm a good enough shot to.... We'll have to try it, that's all.\"  Her face was a white blur and fear of the unknown put metal in her voice. \"Part seal, part cat, part deer, part what else? I don't think you're human, Simon Dalgetty.\"  He didn't answer. The abnormal voluntary dilation of pupils hurt his eyes.  \"What else has Dr. Tighe done?\" Her tone was chill in the dark. \"You can't study the human mind without studying the body too. What's he done? Are you the mutant they're always speculating about? Did Dr. Tighe create or find homo superior?\"  \"If I don't plug that radio com-set before they can use it,\" he said, \"I'll be homo-genized.\"  \"You can't laugh it off,\" she said through taut lips. \"If you aren't of our species I have to assume you're our enemy--till you prove otherwise!\" Her fingers closed hard on his arm. \"Is that what your little gang at the Institute is doing? Have they decided that mere humanity isn't good enough to be civilized? Are they preparing the way for your kind to take over?\"  \"Listen,\" he said wearily. \"Right now we're two people, very mortal indeed, being hunted. So shut up!\"  He took the pistol from her holster and slipped a full clip into its magazine. His vision was at high sensitivity now, her face showed white against the wet rock with gray highlights along its strong cheekbones beneath the wide frightened eyes. Beyond the reefs the sea was gunmetal under the stars, streaked with foam and shadow.  Ahead of him, as he rose to his feet, the line of guards stood out as paler darknesses against the vertiginous island face. They had mounted a heavy machine-gun to point seaward and a self-powered spotlight, not turned on, rested nearby. Those two things could be dangerous but first he had to find the radio set that could call the whole garrison down on them.  _There!_ It was a small hump on the back of one man, near the middle of the beach. He was pacing restlessly up and down with a tommy-gun in his hands. Dalgetty raised the pistol with slow hard-held concentration, wishing it were a rifle. _Remember your target practice now, arm loose, fingers extended, don't pull the trigger but squeeze--because you've got to be right the first time!_  He shot. The weapon was a military model, semi-noiseless and with no betraying streak of light. The first bullet spun the goon on his heels and sent him lurching across sand and rock. Dalgetty worked the trigger, spraying around his victim, a storm of lead that _must_ ruin the sender.

It includes material gathered from many visits to the Exposition grounds and from many talks with men concerned in the organization and the building and ornamentation. The brief history that forms the Introduction gives an account of the development. For me, as, I presume, for most people, the thing done, no matter how interesting it may he, is never so interesting as the doing of the thing, the play of the forces behind. Even in the talk with the architect, where the finished Exposition itself is discussed, I have tried to keep in mind those forces, and wherever I could to indicate their play.  The dialogue form I have used for several reasons: it is easy to follow; it gives scope for more than one kind of opinion; and it deals with the subject as we all do, when with one friend or more than one we visit the Exposition grounds. It has been my good fortune to he able to see the Exposition from points of view very different from my own and much better informed and equipped. I am glad to pass on the advantage.  The Exposition is generally acknowledged to be an achievement unprecedented. Merely to write about it and to try to convey a sense of its quality is a privilege. I have valued it all the more because I know that many people, not trained in matters of architecture and art, are striving to relate themselves to the expression here, to understand it and to feel it in all its hearings. If, at times, directly or in indirectly, I have been critical, the reason is that I wished, in so far as I could, to persuade visitors not to swallow the Exposition whole, but to think about it for themselves, and to bear in mind that the men behind it, those of today and those of days remote, were human beings exactly like themselves, and to draw from it all they could in the way of genuine benefit.  Though the volume is mainly devoted to the artistic features associated with the courts and the main palaces, I have included, among the illustrations, pictures of the California Building, both because of its close relation to California and because it is in itself magnificent, and of two notable art features, the mural painting by Bianca in the Italian Building, and \"The Thinker\", by Rodin, in the court of the French Pavilion.    Introduction    The First Steps    In January, 1904, R. B. Hale of San Francisco wrote to his fellow-directors of the Merchants' Association, that, in 1915, San Francisco ought to hold an exposition to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal. In the financing of the St. Louis Exposition, soon to begin, Mr. Hale found a model for his plan. Five million dollars should be raised by popular subscription, five million dollars should be asked from the State, and five million dollars should be provided by city bonds.  The idea was promptly endorsed by the business associations.   From their chairmen was formed a board of governors. It was decided that the exposition should be held, and formal notification was given to the world by introducing into Congress a bill that provided for an appropriation of five million dollars. The bill was not acted on, and it was allowed to die at the end of the session.  Soon after formulating the plan for the exposition Mr. Hale changed  the date from, 1915 to 1913, to make it coincide with the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery by Balboa of the Pacific.  In 1906 came the earthquake and fire. The next few years San Franciscans were busy clearing away the debris and rebuilding. It was predicted that the city might recover in ten years, and might not recover in less than twenty-five years.  Nevertheless, in December, 1906, within nine months of the disaster, a meeting was held in the shack that served for the St. Francis Hotel, and the Pacific Ocean Exposition Company was incorporated.  In three years  the city recovered sufficiently to hold a week's festival, the Portola, and to make it a success.  Two days afterward, in October, 1909, Mr. Hale gave a dinner to a small group of business men, and told of what had been done toward preparing for the Exposition. They agreed to help.  Shortly afterward a meeting was held at the Merchants' Exchange. It was decided that an effort should at once be made to raise the money and to rouse the people of San Francisco to the importance of the project of holding the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915.  As many as twenty-five hundred letters were sent to business men, asking if they favored the idea of holding an exposition. Out of about eight hundred replies only seven were opposed. Presently there were signs of enthusiasm, reflected in the newspapers.  A committee of six representative business men was appointed and the announcement was made that the committee should be glad to hear from anyone in the city who had suggestions or grievances. It was determined that every San Franciscan should have his day in court.  Later the committee of six appointed a foundation committee of two hundred, representing a wide variety of interests.  The committee of two hundred chose a committee of three from outside their number.  The committee of three chose from among the two hundred a directorate of thirty. The thirty became the directorate of a new corporation, made in 1910, the Panama-Pacific International Exposition Company.    Financing    The Panama-Pacific Company two local millionaires, W. H. Crocker and W. B. Bourn, started financially with twenty-five thousand dollars each. They established the maximum individual subscription. They also secured forty subscriptions of twenty-five thousand dollars each. Then followed the call for a mass meeting. Before the meeting was held the business men of the city were thoroughly canvassed. The Southern Pacific and the Union Pacific together subscribed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. There were many other large subscriptions from public-service organizations.  On the afternoon of the meeting there was a crowd in the Merchants' Exchange Board Room. The announcement of the subscriptions created enthusiasm. In two hours the amount ran up to more than four million dollars. During the next few years they were increased to about $6,500,000.  Meanwhile, the State voted a tax levy of five million dollars, and San Francisco voted a bond and issue of the same amount, and by an act of the Legislature, in special session, the counties were authorized to levy a small tax for county Participation, amounting, in estimate, to about three million dollars.    Recognition From Congress    Next came the task of securing from Congress official recognition of San Francisco as the site of the International Exposition in celebration of the Panama Canal.  Headquarters were established in Washington. Presently serious opposition developed. Emissaries went from San Francisco to Washington singly and in delegations. Stress was laid on San Francisco's purpose not to ask for an appropriation from the national government. There were several cities in competition - Boston, Washington, Baltimore and New Orleans. New Orleans proved the most formidable rival. It relied on the strength of of a united Democracy and of the solid South.  In"]]]
