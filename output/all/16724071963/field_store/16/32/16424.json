Her smile, like a ballet-dancer’s, had no connection with, nor relation to, the matter of her speech or her state of feeling; it was what a watchmaker would call a detached movement.  ‘I can’t see,’ said she, ‘that it is my duty to send Lisa away to be taught, just when I need her most.  My development is a good deal more important than hers.’  ‘Why?’  ‘Why?  Because I have a vocation and a mission; because, if I should falter or faint by the wayside, hundreds of women who depend on me for inspiration would fall back into error and suffer permanent loss and injury.’  ‘Do you suppose they really would?’ asked Mary rather maliciously, anxious if possible to ruffle the surface of Mrs. Grubb’s exasperating placidity.  ‘Or would they, of course after a long period of grief-stricken apathy, attach themselves to somebody else’s classes?’  ‘They might,’ allowed Mrs. Grubb, in a tone of hurt self-respect; ‘though you must know, little as you’ve seen of the world, that no woman has just the same revelation as any other, and that there are some who are born to interpret truth to the multitude.  I can say in all humility that it has been so with me from a child.  I’ve always had a burning desire to explore the secret chambers of Thought, always yearned to understand and explain the universe.’  ‘I have never tried to explain it,’ sighed Mary a little wearily; ‘one is so busy trying to keep one’s little corner clean and sweet and pleasant, a helpful place where sad and tired souls can sit down and rest.’  ‘Who wants to sit down and rest?  Not I!’ exclaimed Mrs. Grubb.  ‘But then, I’m no criterion, I have such an active mind.’  ‘There are just a few passive virtues,’ said Mary teasingly.  ‘We must remember that activity doesn’t always make for good; sometimes it is unrest, disintegration; not growth, Mrs. Grubb, but fermentation.’  Mrs. Grubb took out a small blank-book and made a note, for she had an ear for any sentence that might be used in a speech.  ‘That is true.  “_Distrust the activity which is not growth_, _but fermentation_” that will just hit some ladies in my classes, and it comes right in with something I am going to say this evening.  We have a Diet Congress here this week, and there’s a good deal of feeling and dispute between the various branches.  I have two delegates stopping with me, and they haven’t spoken to each other since yesterday morning, nor sat down to eat at the same table.  I shall do all I can, as the presiding officer, to keep things pleasant at the meetings, but it will be difficult.  You’ve never been in public life and can’t understand it, but you see there are women among the delegates who’ve suffered the tyranny of man so long that they will cook anything their husbands demand; women who believe in eating any kind of food, and hold that the principal trouble lies in bad cooking; women who will give up meat, but still indulge in all sorts of cakes, pastries, and kickshaws; and women who are strong on temperance in drink, but who see no need of temperance in food. The whole question of diet reform is in an awful state, and a Congress is the only way to settle it.’  ‘How do men stand on the diet question?’ asked Mary, with a twinkle in her eye.  ‘They don’t stand at all,’ answered Mrs. Grubb promptly.  ‘They sit right still, and some of them lie down flat, you might say, whenever it’s mentioned.  They’ll do even more for temperance than they will for reformed diet, though goodness knows they’re fond enough of drinking. The Edenites number about sixty-seven in this city, and nine is the largest number of gentlemen that we’ve been able to interest.  Those nine are the husbands and sons of the lady members, and at the next meeting two of them are going to be expelled for backsliding.  I declare, if I was a man, I’d be ashamed to confess that I was all stomach; but that’s what most of them are.  Not that it’s easy work to be an Edenite: it’s impossible to any but a highly spiritual nature.  I have been on the diet for six months, and nothing but my position as vice-president of the society, and my desire to crush the body and release the spirit, could have kept me faithful.  I don’t pretend to like it, but that doesn’t make me disloyal.  There’s nothing I enjoy better than a good cut of underdone beef, with plenty of dish gravy; I love nice tender porter-house steaks with mushrooms; I love thick mutton-chops broiled over a hot fire: but I can’t believe in them, and my conscience won’t allow me to eat them.  Do you believe in meat?’  ‘Certainly.’  ‘I don’t see why you say “certainly.”  You would be a good deal better off without it.  You are filling yourself full of carnal, brutal, murderous passions every time you eat it.  The people who eat meat are not half so elevated nor half so teachable as the Edenites.’  ‘The Edenites are possibly too weak and hungry to resist instruction,’ said Mary.  ‘They are neither weak nor hungry,’ replied their vice-president, with dignity.  ‘They eat milk, and stewed fruit, and all the edible grains nicely boiled.  It stands to reason that if you can subdue your earthly, devilish, sensual instincts on anything, you can do it on a diet like that.  You can’t fancy an angel or a Mahatma devouring underdone beef.’  ‘No,’ agreed Mistress Mary; ‘but for that matter, the spectacle of an angel eating dried-apple sauce doesn’t appeal to my imagination.’  ‘It’s no joking matter,’ said Mrs. Grubb, with real tears in her eyes. ‘It was my interest in Theosophy that brought me to the Edenic diet.  I have good and sufficient motives for denying my appetite, for I’ve got a certain goal to reach, and I’m in earnest.’  ‘Then here’s my hand, and I respect you for it.  Oh, how I should like a hot mutton-chop at this moment!—Do forgive me.’  ‘I forgive you, because I can see you act up to all the light that has been revealed to you.  I don’t know as I ought to be proud because I see so much truth.  My classes tell me I get these marvellous revelations because I’m so open-minded.  Now Mr. Grubb wouldn’t and couldn’t bear discussion of any sort.  His soul never grew, for he wouldn’t open a clink where a new idea might creep in.  He’d always accompany me to all my meetings (such advantages as that man had and missed!), and sometimes he’d take the admission tickets; but when the speaking began, he’d shut the door and stay out in the entry by himself till it was time to wait upon me home.  Do you believe in vaccination?’  ‘Certainly.’  ‘Well, it passes my comprehension how you can be so sure of your beliefs. You’d better come and hear some of the arguments on the opposite side.  I am the secretary of the Anti-Vaccination League.’  (Mrs. Grubb was especially happy in her anti-societies; negatives seemed to give her more scope for argument.)  ‘I say to my classes, “You must not blame those to whom higher truths do not appeal, for refusing to believe in that which they cannot understand; but you may reprove them for decrying or ridiculing those laws or facts of nature which they have never investigated with an unprejudiced mind.”  Well, I must be going.  I’ve sat longer than I meant to, this room is so peaceful and comfortable.’  ‘But what about Lisa’s future?  We haven’t settled that, although we’ve had a most interesting and illuminating conversation.’  ‘Why, I’ve told you how I feel about her, and you must respect my feeling.  The world can only grow when each person allows his fellow-man complete liberty of thought and action.  I’ve kept the child four years, and now when my good care and feeding, together with the regular work and early hours I’ve always prescribed, have begun to show their fruits in her improved condition, you want she should be put in some institution. Why, isn’t she doing well enough as she is?  I’m sure you’ve had a wonderful influence over her.’  ‘Nothing could induce me to lose sight of her entirely,’ said Mistress Mary, ‘but we feel now that she is ready to take the next step.  She needs a skilled physician who is master both of body and mind, as well as a teacher who is capable of following out his principles.  I will see to all that, if you will only give me the privilege.’  Mrs. Grubb sank down in the rocking-chair in despair.  ‘Don’t I need some consideration as well as that little imbecile?  Am I, with my ambitions and aspirations, to be for ever hampered by these three nightmares of children?  Oh, if I could once get an astral body, I would stay in it, you may be sure!’  ‘You do not absolutely need Lisa yourself,’ argued Mary.  ‘It is the twins to whom she has been indispensable.  Provide for them in some way, and she is freed from a responsibility for which she is not, and never was, fit.  It is a miracle that some tragedy has not come out of this daily companionship of three such passionate, irresponsible creatures.’  ‘Some tragedy will come out of it yet,’ said Mrs. Grubb gloomily, ‘if I am not freed from the shackles that keep me in daily slavery.  The twins are as likely to go to the gallows as anywhere; and as for Lisa, she would be a good deal better off dead than alive, as Mrs. Sylvester says.’  ‘That isn’t for us to decide,’ said Mistress Mary soberly.  ‘I might have been careless and impertinent enough to say it a year ago, but not now. Lisa has all along been the victim of cruel circumstances.  Wherever she has been sinned against through ignorance, it is possible, barely possible, that the fault may be atoned for; but any neglect of duty now would be a criminal offence.

CASSELL & COMPANY, LIMITED: _LONDON_, _PARIS_, _NEW YORK & MELBOURNE_. 1887     INTRODUCTION.   Joseph Butler was born in 1692, youngest of eight children of a linendraper at Wantage, in Berkshire.  His father was a Presbyterian, and after education at the Wantage Free Grammar School Joseph Butler was sent to be educated for the Presbyterian ministry in a training academy at Gloucester, which was afterwards removed to Tewkesbury.  There he had a friend and comrade, Secker, who afterwards became Archbishop of Canterbury.  Butler and Secker inquired actively, and there was foreshadowing of his future in the fact that in 1713, at the age of twenty-one, Butler was engaged in anonymous discussion with Samuel Clarke upon his book on the _a priori_ demonstration of the Divine Existence and Attributes.  When the time drew near for call to the ministry, Butler, like his friend Secker, had reasoned himself into accordance with the teaching of the Church of England.  Butler's father did not oppose his strong desire to enter the Church, and he was entered in 1714 at Oriel College, Oxford.  At college a strong friendship was established between Butler and a fellow- student, Edward Talbot, whose father was a Bishop, formerly of Oxford and Salisbury, then of Durham.  Through Talbot's influence Butler obtained in 1718 the office of Preacher in the Rolls Chapel, which he held for the next eight years.  In 1722 Talbot died, and on his death-bed urged his father on behalf of his friend Butler.  The Bishop accordingly presented Joseph Butler to the living of Houghton-le-Spring.  But it was found that costs of dilapidations were beyond his means at Houghton, and Butler had a dangerous regard for building works.  He was preferred two years afterwards to the living of Stanhope, which then became vacant, and which yielded a substantial income.  Butler sought nothing for himself, his simplicity of character, real worth, and rare intellectual power, secured him friends, and the love of two of them--Talbot first, and afterwards Secker, who made his own way in the Church, and became strong enough to put his friend as well as himself in the way of worldly advancement, secured for Butler all the patronage he had, until the Queen also became his active friend.  Joseph Butler was seven years at Stanhope, quietly devoted to his parish duties, preaching, studying, and writing his \"Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature.\"  In 1727, while still at Stanhope, he was appointed to a stall in Durham Cathedral.  Secker, having become chaplain to the Queen, encouraged her in admiration of Butler's sermons.  He told her that the author was not dead, but buried, and secured her active interest in his behalf.  From Talbot, who had become Lord Chancellor, Secker had no difficulty in obtaining for Butler a chaplaincy which exempted him from the necessity of residence at Stanhope.  Butler, in accepting it, stipulated for permission to live and work in his parish for six months in every year. Next he was made chaplain to the King, and Rector of St. James's, upon which he gave up Stanhope.  In 1736 Queen Caroline appointed him her Clerk of the Closet, an office which gave Butler the duty of attendance upon her for two hours every evening.  In that year he published his \"Analogy,\" of which the purpose was to meet, on its own ground, the scepticism of his day.  The Queen died in 1737, and, in accordance with the strong desire expressed in her last days, in 1738 Butler was made a Bishop.  But his Bishopric was Bristol, worth only 300 or 400 pounds a year.  The King added the Deanery of St. Paul's, when that became vacant in 1740, and in 1750, towards the close of his life, Joseph Butler was translated to the Bishopric of Durham.  He died in 1752.  No man could be less self-seeking.  He owed his rise in the Church wholly to the intellectual power and substantial worth of character that inspired strong friendship.  Seeing how little he sought worldly advancement for himself, while others were pressing and scrambling, Butler's friends used their opportunities of winning for him the advancement he deserved.  He was happiest in doing his work, of which a chief part was in his study, where he employed his philosophic mind in strengthening the foundations of religious faith.  Faith in God was attacked by men who claimed especially to be philosophers, and they were best met by the man who had, beyond all other divines of his day--some might not be afraid to add, of any day--the philosophic mind.  H. M.     SERMON I.  UPON HUMAN NATURE.      ROMANS xii. 4, 5.     _For as we have many members in one body_, _and all members have not    the same office_: _so we_, _being many_, _are one body in Christ_,    _and every one members one of another_.  The Epistles in the New Testament have all of them a particular reference to the condition and usages of the Christian world at the time they were written.  Therefore as they cannot be thoroughly understood unless that condition and those usages are known and attended to, so, further, though they be known, yet if they be discontinued or changed, exhortations, precepts, and illustrations of things, which refer to such circumstances now ceased or altered, cannot at this time be urged in that manner and with that force which they were to the primitive Christians.  Thus the text now before us, in its first intent and design, relates to the decent management of those extraordinary gifts which were then in the Church, {1} but which are now totally ceased.  And even as to the allusion that \"we are one body in Christ,\" though what the apostle here intends is equally true of Christians in all circumstances, and the consideration of it is plainly still an additional motive, over and above moral considerations, to the discharge of the several duties and offices of a Christian, yet it is manifest this allusion must have appeared with much greater force to those who, by the many difficulties they went through for the sake of their religion, were led to keep always in view the relation they stood in to their Saviour, who had undergone the same: to those, who, from the idolatries of all around them, and their ill-treatment, were taught to consider themselves as not of the world in which they lived, but as a distinct society of themselves; with laws and ends, and principles of life and action, quite contrary to those which the world professed themselves at that time influenced by.  Hence the relation of a Christian was by them considered as nearer than that of affinity and blood; and they almost literally esteemed themselves as members one of another.  It cannot, indeed, possibly be denied, that our being God's creatures, and virtue being the natural law we are born under, and the whole constitution of man being plainly adapted to it, are prior obligations to piety and virtue than the consideration that God sent his Son into the world to save it, and the motives which arise from the peculiar relation of Christians as members one of another under Christ our head.  However, though all this be allowed, as it expressly is by the inspired writers, yet it is manifest that Christians at the time of the Revelation, and immediately after, could not but insist mostly upon considerations of this latter kind.  These observations show the original particular reference to the text, and the peculiar force with which the thing intended by the allusion in it must have been felt by the primitive Christian world.  They likewise afford a reason for treating it at this time in a more general way.  The relation which the several parts or members of the natural body have to each other and to the whole body is here compared to the relation which each particular person in society has to other particular persons and to the whole society; and the latter is intended to be illustrated by the former.  And if there be a likeness between these two relations, the consequence is obvious: that the latter shows us we were intended to do good to others, as the former shows us that the several members of the natural body were intended to be instruments of good to each other and to the whole body.  But as there is scarce any ground for a comparison between society and the mere material body, this without the mind being a dead unactive thing, much less can the comparison be carried to any length.  And since the apostle speaks of the several members as having distinct offices, which implies the mind, it cannot be thought an allowable liberty, instead of the _body_ and _its members_, to substitute the _whole nature_ of _man_, and _all the variety of internal principles which belong to it_.  And then the comparison will be between the nature of man as respecting self, and tending to private good, his own preservation and happiness; and the nature of man as having respect to society, and tending to promote public good, the happiness of that society.  These ends do indeed perfectly coincide; and to aim at public and private good are so far from being inconsistent that they mutually promote each other: yet in the following discourse they must be considered as entirely distinct; otherwise the nature of man as tending to one, or as tending to the other, cannot be compared.  There can no comparison be made, without considering the things compared as distinct and different.  From this review and comparison of the nature of man as respecting self and as respecting society, it will plainly appear that _there are as real and the same kind of indications in human nature_, _that we were made for society and to do good to our fellow-creatures_, _as that we were intended to take care of our own life and health and private good_: _and that the same objections lie against one of these assertions as"]]]
