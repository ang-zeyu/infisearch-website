Brownlee has just what you say a good cop should have--a feel for his work and for the types he's dealing with. Within a very short time, Dr. Brownlee can actually get the feel of being inside his patient's mind--deep enough, at least, so that he can spot just what has to be done to put a compensating twist in a twisted mind.  \"He says the genuine zanies are very simple to operate on. They have already got the raw materials in them for him to work with. A normally sane, normally well integrated person would require almost as much work to put a permanent quirk in as removing such a quirk would be in a zany. The brainwashing techniques and hypnotism can introduce such quirks temporarily, but as soon as a normally sane person regains his balance, the quirks tend to fade away.  \"But a system that is off balance and unstable doesn't require much work to push it slightly in another direction. When Brownlee finds out what will do the job, he does it, and we have a tame zany on our hands.\"  \"It sounds as though men of Brownlee's type are rather rare,\" His Grace said.  \"They are. Rarer than psychiatrists as a whole. On the other hand, they can take care of a great many more cases.\"  \"One thing, though,\" the Duke said thoughtfully. \"You mentioned the amputation of a pickpocket's hands. It seems to me that this technique is just as drastic, just as crippling to the person to whom it is done.\"  \"Of course it is! No one has ever denied that. God help us if it's the final answer to the problem! A man who can't drive a car, or use a razor, or punch an enemy in the teeth when it's necessary is certainly handicapped. He's more crippled than he was before. The only compensation for society is that now he's less dangerous.  \"There are certain compensations for the individual, too. He stands less chance of going to prison, or to a death cell. But he's still hemmed in; he's not a free man. Of course, in most instances, he's not aware of what has been done to him; his mind compensates and rationalizes and gives him a reason for what he's undergoing. Joey Partridge thinks his condition is due to the fractures he suffered the last time he beat up a man; Manny the Moog thinks that he's afraid to drive a car because of the last wreck he was in. And, partly, maybe they're both right. But they have still been deprived of a part of their free will, their right of choice.  \"Oh, no; this isn't the final answer by a long shot! It's a stopgap--a _necessary_ stopgap. But, by using it, we can learn more about how the human mind works, and maybe one of these days we'll evolve a science of the mind that can take those twists _out_ instead of compensating for them.  [Illustration]  \"On the other hand, we can save lives by using the technique we have now. We don't dare _not_ use it.  \"When they chopped off those hands, centuries ago, the stumps were cauterized by putting them in boiling oil. It looked like another injury piled on top of the first, but the chirurgeons, not knowing _why_ it worked, still knew that a lot more ex-pickpockets lived through their ordeal if the boiling oil was used afterward.  \"And that's what we're doing with this technique right here and now. We're using it because it saves lives, lives that may potentially or actually be a great deal more valuable than the warped personality that might have taken such a life.  \"But the one thing that I am working for right now and will continue to work for is a _real_ cure, if that's possible. A real, genuine, usable kind of psychotherapy; one which is at least on a par with the science of cake-baking when it comes to the percentages of successes and failures.\"         *       *       *       *       *  His Grace thought that over for a minute. Then he leaned back and looked at me through narrowed eyes. There was a half smile on his lips \"Royall, old man, let's admit one thing, just between ourselves,\" His voice became very slow and very deliberate. \"Both you and I know that this process, whatever it is, is _not_ psychotherapy.\"  \"Why do you say that?\" I wasn't trying to deny anything; I just wanted to know the reasoning behind his conclusions.  \"Because I know what psychotherapy can and can't do. And I know that psychotherapy can _not_ do the sort of thing we've been discussing.  \"It's as if you'd taken me out on a rifle range, to a target two thousand yards from the shooter and let me watch that marksman put fifty shots out of fifty into a six-inch bull's-eye. I might not know what the shooter is using, but I would know beyond any shadow of doubt that it was _not_ an ordinary revolver. More, I would know that it could not be any possible improvement upon the revolver. It simply would have to be an instrument of an entirely different order.  \"If, in 1945, any intelligent military man had been told that the Japanese city of Hiroshima had been totally destroyed by a bomber dropping a single bomb, he would be certain that the bomb was a new and different kind from any ever known before. He would know that, mind you, without necessarily knowing a great deal about chemistry.  \"I don't need to know a devil of a lot about psychotherapy to know that the process you've been describing is as far beyond the limits of psychotherapy as the Hiroshima bomb was beyond the limits of chemistry. Ditto for hypnosis and/or Pavlov's 'conditioned reflex', by the way.  \"Now, just to clear the air, what _is_ it?\"  \"It has no official name yet,\" I told him. \"To keep within the law, we have been calling it psychotherapy. If we called it something else, and admitted that it _isn't_ psychotherapy, the courts couldn't turn the zanies over to us. But you're right--it is as impossible to produce the effect by psychotherapy as it is to produce an atomic explosion by a chemical reaction.  \"I've got a hunch that, just as chemistry and nucleonics are both really branches of physics, so psychotherapy and Brownlee's process are branches of some higher, more inclusive science--but that doesn't have a name, either.\"  \"That's as may be,\" the Duke said, \"but I'm happy to know that you're not deluding yourself that it's any kind of psychotherapy.\"  \"You know,\" I said, \"I kind of like your word _geas_. Because that's exactly what it seems to be--a _geas_. A hex, an enchantment, if you wish.  \"Did you know that Brownlee was an anthropologist before he turned to psychology? He has some very interesting stories to tell about hexes and so on.\"  \"I'll have to hear them one day.\" His Grace took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket. \"Cigarette?\"  \"No, thanks. I gave up smoking a few years back.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He puffed his alight. \"This _geas_,\" he said, \"reminds me of the fact that, before the medical profession came up with antibiotics that would destroy the microorganisms that cause gas gangrene, amputation was the only method of preventing the death of the patient. It was crippling, but necessary.\"  \"_No!_\" My voice must have been a little too sharp, because he raised one eyebrow. \"The analogy,\" I went on in a quieter tone, \"isn't good because it gives a distorted picture. Look, Your Grace, you know what's done to keep a captive wild duck from flying away?\"  \"One wing is clipped.\"  \"Right. Certain of the feathers are trimmed, which throws the duck off balance every time he tries to fly. He's crippled, right? But if you clip the _other_ wing, what happens? He's in balance again. He can't fly as _well_ as he could before his wings were clipped--but he _can_ fly!  \"That's what Brownlee's _geas_ does--restore the balance by clipping the other wing.\"  His Grace smiled. There was an odd sort of twinkle in his eyes. \"Let me carry your analogy somewhat farther. If the one wing is too severely clipped, clipping the other won't help. Our duck wouldn't have enough lift to get off the ground, even if he's balanced.  \"Now, a zany who was that badly crippled--?\"  I grinned back at him. \"Right. It would be so obvious that he would have been put away very quickly. He would not be just psychopathic, but completely psychotic--and demonstrably so.\"  \"Then,\" the Duke said, still pursuing the same track, \"the only way to 'cure' that kind would be to find a method to ... ah ... 'grow the feathers back', wouldn't it? And where does that put today's psychotherapy? Providing, of course, that the analogy follows.\"  \"It does,\" I said. \"The real cure that I want to find would do just that--'grow the feathers back'. And that's beyond the limits of psychotherapy, too. That's why Dr. Brownlee and his boys want to study every zany we bring in, whether he can be helped or not. They're looking for a _cure_, not a stopgap.\"  \"Let me drag that analogy out just a tiny bit more,\" said His Grace. \"Suppose there is a genetic defect in the duck which makes it impossible--absolutely impossible--to grow feathers on that wing. Will your cure work?\"  I was very quiet for along time. At least, it seemed long. The question had occurred to me before, and I didn't even like to think about it. Now, I had to face it again for a short while.  \"Frankly,\" I said as evenly as I could, \"I doubt that anything could be done. But that's only an opinion. We don't know enough yet to make any such predictions. It is my hope that some day we'll find a method of restoring every human being to his or her full potential--but I'm not at all certain of what the source of that potential is.  \"But when we do get our cure,\" I went on, \"then our first move must be to abolish the _geas_. And I wish that day were coming tomorrow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There seemed to be a sudden silence in the room. I hadn't realized that I'd been talking so loudly or so vehemently.  The Duke broke it by saying: \"Look here, Royall; I'm going to stay on here until I've learned all about every phase of this thing. It may sound a bit conceited, but I'm going to try to learn in a few weeks everything you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30833"],["title","The Eyes Have It (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:    This etext was produced from Analog Science Fact & Fiction January 1964.

RANDALL GARRETT                       Illustrated by John Schoenherr                               [Illustration]         *       *       *       *       *     Sir Pierre Morlaix, Chevalier of the Angevin Empire, Knight of the Golden Leopard, and secretary-in-private to my lord, the Count D'Evreux, pushed back the lace at his cuff for a glance at his wrist watch--three minutes of seven. The Angelus had rung at six, as always, and my lord D'Evreux had been awakened by it, as always. At least, Sir Pierre could not remember any time in the past seventeen years when my lord had not awakened at the Angelus. Once, he recalled, the sacristan had failed to ring the bell, and the Count had been furious for a week. Only the intercession of Father Bright, backed by the Bishop himself, had saved the sacristan from doing a turn in the dungeons of Castle D'Evreux.  Sir Pierre stepped out into the corridor, walked along the carpeted flagstones, and cast a practiced eye around him as he walked. These old castles were difficult to keep clean, and my lord the Count was fussy about nitre collecting in the seams between the stones of the walls. All appeared quite in order, which was a good thing. My lord the Count had been making a night of it last evening, and that always made him the more peevish in the morning. Though he always woke at the Angelus, he did not always wake up sober.  Sir Pierre stopped before a heavy, polished, carved oak door, selected a key from one of the many at his belt, and turned it in the lock. Then he went into the elevator and the door locked automatically behind him. He pressed the switch and waited in patient silence as he was lifted up four floors to the Count's personal suite.  By now, my lord the Count would have bathed, shaved, and dressed. He would also have poured down an eye-opener consisting of half a water glass of fine Champagne brandy. He would not eat breakfast until eight. The Count had no valet in the strict sense of the term. Sir Reginald Beauvay held that title, but he was never called upon to exercise the more personal functions of his office. The Count did not like to be seen until he was thoroughly presentable.  The elevator stopped. Sir Pierre stepped out into the corridor and walked along it toward the door at the far end. At exactly seven o'clock, he rapped briskly on the great door which bore the gilt-and-polychrome arms of the House D'Evreux.  For the first time in seventeen years, there was no answer.  Sir Pierre waited for the growled command to enter for a full minute, unable to believe his ears. Then, almost timidly, he rapped again.  There was still no answer.  Then, bracing himself for the verbal onslaught that would follow if he had erred, Sir Pierre turned the handle and opened the door just as if he had heard the Count's voice telling him to come in.  \"Good morning, my lord,\" he said, as he always had for seventeen years.  But the room was empty, and there was no answer.  He looked around the huge room. The morning sunlight streamed in through the high mullioned windows and spread a diamond-checkered pattern across the tapestry on the far wall, lighting up the brilliant hunting scene in a blaze of color.  \"My lord?\"  Nothing. Not a sound.  The bedroom door was open. Sir Pierre walked across to it and looked in.  He saw immediately why my lord the Count had not answered, and that, indeed, he would never answer again.  My lord the Count lay flat on his back, his arms spread wide, his eyes staring at the ceiling. He was still clad in his gold and scarlet evening clothes. But the great stain on the front of his coat was not the same shade of scarlet as the rest of the cloth, and the stain had a bullet hole in its center.  Sir Pierre looked at him without moving for a long moment. Then he stepped over, knelt, and touched one of the Count's hands with the back of his own. It was quite cool. He had been dead for hours.  \"I knew someone would do you in sooner or later, my lord,\" said Sir Pierre, almost regretfully.  Then he rose from his kneeling position and walked out without another look at his dead lord. He locked the door of the suite, pocketed the key, and went back downstairs in the elevator.         *       *       *       *       *  Mary, Lady Duncan stared out of the window at the morning sunlight and wondered what to do. The Angelus bell had awakened her from a fitful sleep in her chair, and she knew that, as a guest at Castle D'Evreux, she would be expected to appear at Mass again this morning. But how could she? How could she face the Sacramental Lord on the altar--to say nothing of taking the Blessed Sacrament itself.  Still, it would look all the more conspicuous if she did not show up this morning after having made it a point to attend every morning with Lady Alice during the first four days of this visit.  She turned and glanced at the locked and barred door of the bedroom. _He_ would not be expected to come. Laird Duncan used his wheelchair as an excuse, but since he had taken up black magic as a hobby he had, she suspected, been actually afraid to go anywhere near a church.  If only she hadn't lied to him! But how could she have told the truth? That would have been worse--infinitely worse. And now, because of that lie, he was locked in his bedroom doing only God and the Devil knew what.  If only he would come out. If he would only stop whatever it was he had been doing for all these long hours--or at least finish it! Then they could leave Evreux, make some excuse--any excuse--to get away. One of them could feign sickness. Anything, anything to get them out of France, across the Channel, and back to Scotland, where they would be safe!  She looked back out of the window, across the courtyard, at the towering stone walls of the Great Keep and at the high window that opened into the suite of Edouard, Count D'Evreux.  Last night she had hated him, but no longer. Now there was only room in her heart for fear.  She buried her face in her hands and cursed herself for a fool. There were no tears left for weeping--not after the long night.  Behind her, she heard the sudden noise of the door being unlocked, and she turned.  Laird Duncan of Duncan opened the door and wheeled himself out. He was followed by a malodorous gust of vapor from the room he had just left. Lady Duncan stared at him.  He looked older than he had last night, more haggard and worn, and there was something in his eyes she did not like. For a moment he said nothing. Then he wet his lips with the tip of his tongue. When he spoke, his voice sounded dazed.  \"There is nothing to fear any more,\" he said. \"Nothing to fear at all.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Reverend Father James Valois Bright, Vicar of the Chapel of Saint-Esprit, had as his flock the several hundred inhabitants of the Castle D'Evreux. As such, he was the ranking priest--socially, not hierarchically--in the country. Not counting the Bishop and the Chapter at the Cathedral, of course. But such knowledge did little good for the Father's peace of mind. The turnout of the flock was abominably small for its size--especially for week-day Masses. The Sunday Masses were well attended, of course; Count D'Evreux was there punctually at nine every Sunday, and he had a habit of counting the house. But he never showed up on weekdays, and his laxity had allowed a certain further laxity to filter down through the ranks.  The great consolation was Lady Alice D'Evreux. She was a plain, simple girl, nearly twenty years younger than her brother, the Count, and quite his opposite in every way. She was quiet where he was thundering, self-effacing where he was flamboyant, temperate where he was drunken, and chaste where he was--  Father Bright brought his thoughts to a full halt for a moment. He had, he reminded himself, no right to make judgments of that sort. He was not, after all, the Count's confessor; the Bishop was.  Besides, he should have his mind on his prayers just now.  He paused and was rather surprised to notice that he had already put on his alb, amice, and girdle, and he was aware that his lips had formed the words of the prayer as he had donned each of them.  _Habit_, he thought, _can be destructive to the contemplative faculty_.  He glanced around the sacristy. His server, the young son of the Count of Saint Brieuc, sent here to complete his education as a gentleman who would some day be the King's Governor of one of the most important counties in Brittany, was pulling his surplice down over his head. The clock said 7:11.  Father Bright forced his mind Heavenward and repeated silently the vesting prayers that his lips had formed meaninglessly, this time putting his full intentions behind them. Then he added a short mental prayer asking God to forgive him for allowing his thoughts to stray in such a manner.  He opened his eyes and reached for his chasuble just as the sacristy door opened and Sir Pierre, the Count's Privy Secretary, stepped in.  \"I must speak to you, Father,\" he said in a low voice. And, glancing at the young De Saint-Brieuc, he added: \"Alone.\"  Normally, Father Bright would have reprimanded anyone who presumed to break into the sacristy as he was vesting for Mass, but he knew that Sir Pierre would never interrupt without good reason. He nodded and went outside in the corridor that led to the altar.  \"What is it, Pierre?\" he asked.  \"My lord the Count is dead. Murdered.\"  After the first "]]]
