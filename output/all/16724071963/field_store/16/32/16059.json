I see again that I cannot rely on anyone here except myself!\"  Meanwhile the crestfallen Barefoot was meditating upon the mysterious ways of the army. Musgrave inspected the work and decided that everything was to be done all over again. The biscuits were to be put in the shed where the oats had been piled, and the oats were to be put out in the open where the biscuits had been. The meat was to change places with the jam, and the mustard with the bacon. The lorries were to take away again everything they had just brought up. So that when lunch-time arrived, everything was in exactly the same state as it had been at dawn. The Admiralty announced the arrival of a transport at two o'clock; the men were supposed to find their rations ready for them upon landing.  Musgrave very pluckily decided that the Labour Company were to have no rest, and were just to be content with nibbling a light lunch while they went on with their work.  Barefoot, who had got up at six and was very hungry, approached the colonel in fear and trembling.  \"May I leave my sergeant in charge for half an hour, sir?\" he asked. \"He can do everything as well as I can. I should like just to run along to the nearest café and have something warm to eat.\"  Musgrave gazed at him in mournful astonishment.  \"Really,\" he said, \"you young fellows don't seem to realize that there's a war on.\" Whereupon he stepped into his car and drove off to the hotel.    *  *  *  *  *  Barefoot, somewhat downcast, buttonholed the interpreter, who was father-confessor to all Englishmen in distress. Aurelle begged him not to get excited.  \"You are always talking about introducing your business methods into the army. As if that were possible! Why, the objects of the two things are entirely different. A business man is always looking for work; an officer is always trying to avoid it. If you neglect these principles, I can foresee an ignominious end in store for you, Barefoot, and Colonel Musgrave will trample on your corpse.\"  Now the thirty thousand Portuguese had been fed during their long voyage on tinned food; and as the transports' holds were being cleared, innumerable empty tins began to accumulate on the wharves. Barefoot and his men were ordered to gather these tins together into regular heaps. These grew so rapidly that the Mayor of the town was exceedingly concerned to see such a waste of space in a harbour already filled to bursting-point, and sent a pointed letter to Colonel Musgrave, asking him to find some other place for his empty tins.  Colonel Musgrave ordered his interpreter to write an equally pointed letter, reminding the Mayor of B---- that the removal of refuse was a municipal concern, and that the British Army was therefore waiting for the Town to hand over a plot of ground for the purpose.  Barefoot happened to speak of this difficulty one day to the business man at whose house he was billeted; and the latter told him that a process had recently been discovered by which old tins could be melted down and used again, and that a company had been floated to work out the scheme; they would be sure to purchase Colonel Musgrave's tins.  The enthusiastic Barefoot began to see visions of profitable and glorious enterprises. Not only would he rid his chief and the Mayor of B---- of a lot of cumbersome salvage, but this modest contract for some tens of tons might well serve as a model to those responsible for the sale of the millions of empty tins scattered daily by the British Army over the plains of Flanders and Artois. And the Commander-in-Chief would call the attention of the War Office to the fact that \"Lieutenant E. W. Barefoot, by his bold and intelligent initiative, had enabled salvage to be carried out to the extent of several million pounds.\"  \"Aurelle,\" he said to the interpreter, \"let's write to this company immediately; we'll speak about it to the colonel when we get their reply.\"  The answer came by return; they were offered twenty francs per ton, carriage at the company's cost.  Barefoot explained his scheme to Colonel Musgrave with assumed modesty, adding that it would be a good thing to flatten out the tins before dispatching them, and that Sergeant Scott, who was a handy man, could easily undertake the job.  \"First of all,\" said the colonel, \"why can't you mind your own business? Don't you know you are forbidden to correspond with strangers upon matters pertaining to the service without consulting your superior officers? And who told you _I_'ve not been thinking for quite a long time of selling your damned tins? Do you think things are as simple as all that in the army? Fetch Aurelle; I'm going to see the superintendent of the French Customs.\"  Three years' experience had taught Colonel Musgrave that the French Customs Service were always to be relied on.  \"Kindly ask this gentleman whether the British Army, having imported tins with their contents without paying any duty, has the right to sell these tins empty in France?\"  \"No,\" answered the official, when the colonel's question had been translated to him, \"there is an order from our headquarters about the matter. The British Army must not carry on any sale of metal on French soil.\"  \"Thank him very much,\" said the colonel, satisfied.  \"Now just look here,\" he said to Barefoot on returning, \"what a nice mess you would have made if I hadn't known my business. Let this be a lesson to you. In future it will be better if you look after your men and leave the rest to me. As for the tins, I have thought of a solution which will satisfy everyone concerned.\"  Next day Barefoot received orders to have the tins packed on lorries, and carried in several loads to the end of the pier, whence they were neatly cast into the sea. In this way the Mayor was spared the trouble of finding a dumping-ground, the British Government paid for the petrol consumed by the lorries, the _Ponts et Chaussées_ bore the expense of the dredging, and, as Colonel Musgrave said, every one was satisfied.    *  *  *  *  *  Colonel Parker, before rejoining the Division, wrote out a report, as usual, about the operations at B----.  \"I beg to draw attention,\" the document ran, \"to the excellent organization of the Supply arrangements. Thirty thousand men have been provided with rations in a harbour where no British base existed. This result is due especially to the organizing abilities displayed by Colonel A. C. Musgrave, C.M.G., D.S.O. (R.A.S.C.). Although this officer has only recently been promoted, I consider it my duty to recommend him ...\"  \"What about Barefoot?\" said Aurelle. \"Couldn't he be made a captain?\"  \"Barefoot? That damned shopkeeper fellow whom Musgrave told me about? The man who wanted to introduce his methods into the army? He's a public danger, my boy! But I can propose your friend Major Baraquin for a C.M.G., if you like.\"  \"Baraquin?\" Aurelle exclaimed in turn. \"Why, he always refused everything you asked him for.\"  \"Yes,\" said the colonel; \"he's not very easy to get on with; he doesn't understand things; but he's a soldier, every inch of him! I like old Baraquin!\"     CHAPTER V  THE STORY OF PRIVATE BIGGS    \"La Nature fait peu de gens vaillants; c'est la bonne institution    et la discipline.\"--Charron.   The new padre was a stout, artless man with a kind face. He was only just out from England, and delighted the general with his air of innocent surprise.  \"What's making all that noise?\" he asked.  \"Our guns,\" said Colonel Parker.  \"Really?\" replied the padre, in mild astonishment. As he walked into the camp, he was stopped by a sentry.  \"Who goes there?\"  \"Friend,\" he answered. Then he went up to the man and added anxiously, \"I suppose that was the right thing to answer, wasn't it?\"  The general was delighted at these stories, and asked the Rev. Mr. Jeffries to take his meals at his own table.  \"Padre,\" he said, \"don't you think our mess is a happy family?\"  \"Padre,\" chimed in the doctor approvingly, \"don't you think that this mess has all the characteristics of a family? It is just a group of people thrown together by chance, who never understand each other in the least, who criticize one another severely, and are compelled by circumstances to put up with each other.\"  \"There's nothing to joke about,\" said Colonel Parker. \"It's these compulsory associations that often give rise to the finest devotion.\"  And being in a lively mood that evening, he related the story of Private Biggs:  \"You remember Biggs, who used to be my orderly? He was a shy, refined little fellow, who used to sell neckties in peace-time. He loathed war, shells, blood and danger.  \"Well, at the end of 1916, the powers that be sent the battalion to Gamaches training camp. A training camp, padre, is a plot of ground traversed by imitation trenches, where officers who have never been near the line teach war-worn veterans their business.  \"The officers in charge of these camps, having a _clientèle_ to satisfy, start some new fashion every season. This spring I understand that 'open file' is to be the order of the day; last autumn 'massed formation' was the watchword of the best firms. There's a lot of talk been going on for some time, too, about 'firing from the hip'; that's one of my friend Lamb's absolutely original creations--a clever fellow that; he ought to do very well.  \"At Gamaches the officer in command was Major Macleod, a bloodthirsty Scot whose hobby was bayonet work. He was very successful at showing that, when all's said and done, it's the bayonet that wins battles. Others before him have sworn that it is only hand-grenades, heavy guns, or even cavalry that can give a decisive victory. But Macleod's doctrine was original in one respect: he favoured moral suggestion rather than actual practice for the manufacture of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30596"],["title","General Bramble (#4)"],["body"," soldiers. For the somewhat repulsive slaughter of bayonet fighting he found it necessary to inspire the men with a fierce hatred of the enemy.  \"For this purpose he had bags of straw stuffed to the shape of German soldiers, adorned with a sort of German helmet and painted field-grey, and these were given as targets to our Highlanders.  \"'Blood is flowing,' he used to repeat as the training proceeded, 'blood is flowing, and you must rejoice at the sight of it. Don't get tender-hearted; just think only of stabbing in the right place. To withdraw the bayonet from the corpse, place your foot on the stomach.'  \"You can imagine how Biggs's soul revolted at these speeches. In vain did Sergeant-Major Fairbanks of the Guards deliver himself of his most bloodthirsty _repertoire_; Biggs's tender heart was horror-struck at the idea of bowels and brains exposed, and it was always owing to him that the most carefully-prepared charges were deprived of the warlike frenzy demanded by Major Macleod.  \"'_As_ you were!' Sergeant-Major Fairbanks used to yell. '_As_ you were! Now then, Private Biggs.' And after twenty attempts had failed, he would conclude sadly, 'Well, boys, mark my words, come Judgment Day, when we're all p'radin' for the final review an' the Lord comes along, no sooner will the Archangel give the order, \"'Tention!\" than 'e'll 'ave to shout, \"As you were! Now then, Private Biggs!\"'  \"When the period of training was over, Macleod assembled all our men in a large shed and gave 'em his celebrated lecture on 'hatred of the enemy.'  \"I was really curious to hear him, because people at G.H.Q. were always talking about the extraordinary influence he had over the troops' _moral_. 'One of Macleod's speeches,' said the Chief of Staff, 'does the Huns as much harm as ten batteries of heavy howitzers.'  \"The lecturer began with a ghastly description of the shooting of prisoners, and went on to a nauseating account of the effects of gas and a terrible story about the crucifixion of a Canadian sergeant; and then, when our flesh was creeping and our throats were dry, came a really eloquent hymn of hate, ending with an appeal to the avenging bayonet.  \"Macleod was silent for a few minutes, enjoying the sight of our haggard faces; then, considering we were sufficiently worked up, he went on:  \"'Now, if there is any one of you who wants anything explained, let him speak up; I'm ready to answer any questions.'  \"Out of the silence came the still, small voice of Private Biggs.  \"'Please, sir?'  \"'Yes, my man,' said Major Macleod kindly.  \"'Please, sir, can you tell me how I can transfer to the Army Service Corps?'  \"That evening, in the kitchen, our orderlies discussed the incident, and discovered in course of conversation that Biggs had never killed a man. All the others were tough old warriors, and they were much astonished.  \"Kemble, the general's orderly, a giant with a dozen or so to his account, was full of pity for the poor little Cockney. 'Mon, mon,' he said, 'I can hardly believe ye. Why, never a single one? Not even wounded?'  \"'No,' said Biggs, 'honest Injun. I run so slowly, I'm always the last to get there--I never get a chance.'  \"Well, a few days later, the battalion was up in the line again, and was sent into a little stunt opposite Fleurbaix, to straighten out a salient. You remember, sir? It's one of the best things the Division has ever done.  \"Artillery preparation, low barrage, cutting communications--everything came off like clockwork, and we caught the Boches in their holes like rabbits.  \"While the men were busy with their rifles, grenades and bayonets, cleaning up the conquered trenches, suddenly a voice was heard shouting:  \"'Harry, Harry, where are you?... Just send Biggs along here, will you?... Pass the word along to Private Biggs.'  \"It was the voice of the Highlander, Kemble. Some giant grasped Biggs by the seat of his trousers and swung him and his rifle up to the parapet. Then two strong hands seized the little man, and he was swung in mid-air from man to man right up the file till he was finally handed over to Kemble, who seized him affectionately with his left hand, and, full of joy at the dainty treat he had in store for his friend, cried, 'Mon, mon, look in this wee hole: I've got twa of 'em at the end of my rifle, but I've kept 'em for you.'  \"This is a true story,\" added Colonel Parker, \"and it shows once more that the British soldier has a kind heart.\"  The Rev. Mr. Jeffries had turned very pale.     CHAPTER VI  AN AIR RAID    \"I do not like seriousness. I think it is irreligious.\"--Chesterton.   \"They'll be here soon,\" said Dr. O'Grady. \"The moon is low, and the shadows are long, and these oblique lights will suit them very well.\"  The division was in rest on the hills overlooking Abbeville, and the doctor was walking to and fro with Colonel Parker and Aurelle along the lime-bordered terrace, from which they could see the town that was going to be attacked. From the wet grassy lawns near by groups of anxious women were scanning the horizon.  \"Yesterday evening, in a suburb,\" said Aurelle, \"they killed a baker's three children.\"  \"I am sorry,\" put in the doctor, \"they should be favoured with this fine weather. The law of the storm seems to be exactly the same for these barbarians as it is for innocent birds. It's absolutely contradictory to the notion of a just Divinity.\"  \"Doctor,\" said Aurelle, \"you are an unbeliever.\"  \"No,\" replied the doctor, \"I am an Irishman, and I respect the bitter wisdom of the Catholic faith. But this universe of ours, I confess, strikes me as completely non-moral. Shells and decorations fall haphazard from above on the just and the unjust alike; M. Poincaré's carburettor gets out of order just as often as the Kaiser's. The Gods have thrown up their job, and handed it over to the Fates. It is true that Apollo, who is a well-behaved person, takes out his chariot every morning; that may satisfy the poets and the astronomers, but it distresses the moralist. How satisfactory it would be if the resistance of the air were relative to the virtues of the airman, and if Archimedes' principle did not apply to pirates!\"  \"O'Grady,\" observed Colonel Parker, \"you know the words of the psalm: 'As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; but they are like the chaff which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.'\"  \"Yes, colonel; but supposing you, a good man, and I, a sinner, were suddenly hit by a bomb----\"  \"But, doctor,\" Aurelle interrupted, \"this science of yours is after all only an act of faith.\"  \"How so, my boy? It is obvious that there are laws in this world. If I press the trigger of this revolver, the bullet will fly out, and if General Webb is given an Army Corps, General Bramble will have a bilious attack.\"  \"Quite so, doctor; you observe a few series linked together, and you conclude that the world is governed by laws. But the most important facts--life, thought, love--elude your observations. You may perhaps be sure that the sun is going to rise to-morrow morning, but you don't know what Colonel Parker is going to say next minute. Yet you assert that the colonel is a machine; that is because your religion tells you to.\"  \"So does every one else's religion,\" said the doctor. \"Only yesterday I read in the Bishop of Broadfield's message: 'The prayers for rain cannot take place this week, as the barometer is too high.'\"  Far away over the plain, in the direction of Amiens, the star-sprinkled sky began to flicker with tiny, flashing points of light.  \"Here they come,\" said Aurelle.  \"They'll be ten minutes yet,\" said the doctor. They resumed their walk.  \"O'Grady,\" Colonel Parker put in, \"you're getting more crazy every day. You claim, if I comprehend your foolish ideas aright, that a scientist can foretell rain better than an Anglican bishop. What a magnificent paradox! Meteorology and medicine are far less solid sciences than theology. _You_ say that the universe is governed by laws, don't you? Nothing is less certain. It is true that chance seems to have established a relative balance in the tiny corner of the universe which we inhabit, but there is nothing to show that this balance is going to last. If you were to press the trigger of this revolver to-morrow, it is just possible that it would not go off. It is also possible that the German aeroplanes will cease to fly, and that General Bramble will take a dislike to the gramophone. _I_ should not be surprised at any of these things; I should simply recognize that supernatural forces had come into our lives.\"  \"Doctor,\" said Aurelle, \"you know the clock which my orderly Brommit winds up every evening? Let us suppose that on one of the molecules that go to make up the minute-hand of that clock there live a race of beings who are infinitely small, and yet as intelligent as we are. These little creatures have measured their world, and have noticed that the speed of its motion is constant; they have discovered that their planet covers a fixed distance in a fixed period of time, which for us is a minute and for them a century. Amongst their people there are two schools of thought. The scientists claim that the laws of the universe are immutable, and that no supernatural power can intervene to change them. The believers admit the existence of these laws, but they also assert that there is a divine being who can interfere with their course; and to that being they address prayers. In that tiny world, which of them is right? The believers, of course; for there is such a being as Private Brommit, and if he forgets one evening to wind up the clock, the scientists and all their proud theories will vanish away like smoke in a cataclysm which will bring whole worlds to their doom.\"  \"That's so,\" said the doctor; \"but if they had prayed----\"  \"Listen,\" interrupted Aurelle.  The park had become strangely silent; and though there was no wind, they could hear the gentle rustling of the leaves, the barking of a dog in the"]]]
