He got the latter not long ago, after the Frontier War in India.  I was not, however, led away into cordiality myself.  I had not forgotten his rudeness, and I thought that he might be sucking up to me.  I knew that when I had my dear Uncle Roger's many millions I should be a rather important person; and, of course, he knew it too.  So I got even with him for his former impudence.  When he held out his hand I put one finger in it, and said, \"How do?\"  He got very red and turned away. Father and he had ended by glaring at each other, so neither of us was sorry to be done with him.  All the time Mr. St. Leger did not seem to see or hear anything, but went on reading his letter.  I thought the old MacSkelpie was going to bring him into the matter between us, for as he turned away I heard him say something under his breath.  It sounded like \"Help!\" but Mr. S--- did not hear.  He certainly no notice of it.  As the MacS--- and Mr. S--- sat quite silent, neither looking at us, and as father was sitting on the other side of the room with his chin in his hand, and as I wanted to show that I was indifferent to the two S's, I took out this notebook, and went on with the Record, bringing it up to this moment.    THE RECORD--_Continued_.   When I had finished writing I looked over at Rupert.  When he saw us, he jumped up and went over to father and shook his hand quite warmly.  Father took him very coolly.  Rupert, however, did not seem to see it, but came towards me heartily.  I happened to be doing something else at the moment, and at first I did not see his hand; but just as I was looking at it the clock struck eleven.  Whilst it was striking Mr. Trent came into the room.  Close behind him came his clerk, carrying a locked tin box.  There were two other men also.  He bowed to us all in turn, beginning with me.  I was standing opposite the door; the others were scattered about.  Father sat still, but Sir Colin and Mr. St. Leger rose.  Mr. Trent not did shake hands with any of us--not even me. Nothing but his respectful bow.  That is the etiquette for an attorney, I understand, on such formal occasions.  He sat down at the end of the big table in the centre of the room, and asked us to sit round.  Father, of course, as Head of the Family, took the seat at his right hand.  Sir Colin and St. Leger went to the other side, the former taking the seat next to the attorney.  The General knows, of course, that a Baronet takes precedence at a ceremony.  I may be a Baronet some day myself, and have to know these things.  The clerk took the key which his master handed to him, opened the tin box, and took from it a bundle of papers tied with red tape.  This he placed before the attorney, and put the empty box behind him on the floor.  Then he and the other man sat at the far end of the table; the latter took out a big notebook and several pencils, and put them before him.  He was evidently a shorthand-writer.   Mr. Trent removed the tape from the bundle of papers, which he placed a little distance in front of him.  He took a sealed envelope from the top, broke the seal, opened the envelope, and from it took a parchment, in the folds of which were some sealed envelopes, which he laid in a heap in front of the other paper. Then he unfolded the parchment, and laid it before him with the outside page up.  He fixed his glasses, and said:  \"Gentlemen, the sealed envelope which you have seen me open is endorsed 'My Last Will and Testament--ROGER MELTON, _June_, 1906.'  This document\"--holding it up--\"is as follows:      \"'I Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange in the County of Dorset; of     number one hundred and twenty-three Berkeley Square London; and of     the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains, being of     sound mind do make this my Last Will and Testament on this day Monday     the eleventh day of the month of June in the year of Our Lord one     thousand nine hundred and six at the office of my old friend and     Attorney Edward Bingham Trent in number one hundred and seventy-six     Lincoln's Inn Fields London hereby revoking all other wills that I     may have formerly made and giving this as my sole and last Will     making dispositions of my property as follows:      \"'1.  To my kinsman and nephew Ernest Halbard Melton Esquire, justice     of the Peace, Humcroft the County of Salop, for his sole use and     benefit the sum of twenty thousand pounds sterling free of all Duties     Taxes and charges whatever to be paid out of my Five per centum Bonds     of the City of Montreal, Canada.      \"'2.

To the various persons charities and Trustees named in the     schedule attached to this Will and marked A. the various sums     mentioned therein, all free of Duties and Taxes and charges     whatsoever.'\"  Here Mr. Trent read out the list here following, and announced for our immediate understanding of the situation the total amount as two hundred and fifty thousand pounds.  Many of the beneficiaries were old friends, comrades, dependents, and servants, some of them being left quite large sums of money and specific objects, such as curios and pictures.      \"'5.  To my kinsman and nephew Ernest Roger Halbard Melton presently     living in the house of his father at Humcroft Salop the sum of Ten     thousand pounds sterling.      \"'6.

To my dear nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my dear sister     Patience Melton by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger the     sum of one thousand pounds sterling.

In case of the non-acceptance of the     conditions of such letter, I devise and bequeath the whole of the     sums and properties reserved therein to the executors herein     appointed Colin Alexander MacKelpie and Edward Bingham Trent in trust     to distribute the same in accordance with the terms of the letter in     the present custody of Edward Bingham Trent marked C, and now     deposited sealed with my seal in the sealed envelope containing my     last Will to be kept in the custody of the said Edward Bingham Trent     and which said letter C is also an integral part of my Will.  And in     case any doubt should arise as to my ultimate intention as to the     disposal of my property the above-mentioned Executors are to have     full power to arrange and dispose all such matters as may seem best     to them without further appeal.  And if any beneficiary under this     Will shall challenge the same or any part of it, or dispute the     validity thereof, he shall forfeit to the general estate the bequest     made herein to him, and any such bequest shall cease and be void to     all intents and purposes whatsoever.      \"'8.

Holding the bundle in his hand, he stood up, saying as he did so:  \"That is all, gentlemen, unless any of you wish to ask me any questions; in which case I shall answer, of course, to the best of my power.  I shall ask you, Sir Colin, to remain with me, as we have to deal with some matters, or to arrange a time when we may meet to do so.  And you also, Mr. Sent Leger, as there is this letter to submit to you.  It is necessary that you should open it in the presence of the executors, but there is no necessity that anyone else should be present.\"  The first to speak was my father.  Of course, as a county gentleman of position and estate, who is sometimes asked to take the chair at Sessions--of course, when there is not anyone with a title present--he found himself under the duty of expressing himself first.  Old MacKelpie has superior rank; but this was a family affair, in which my father is Head of the House, whilst old MacKelpie is only an outsider brought into it--and then only to the distaff side, by the wife of a younger brother of the man who married into our family.  Father spoke with the same look on his face as when he asks important questions of witnesses at Quarter Sessions.  \"I should like some points elucidated.\"  The attorney bowed (he gets his 120 thou', any way, so he can afford to be oily--suave, I suppose he would call it); so father looked at a slip of paper in his hand and asked:  \"How much is the amount of the whole estate?\"  The attorney answered quickly, and I thought rather rudely.  He was red in the face, and didn't bow this time; I suppose a man of his class hasn't more than a very limited stock of manners:  \"That, sir, I am not at liberty to tell you.  And I may say that I would not if I could.\"  \"Is it a million?\" said father again.  He was angry this time, and even redder than the old attorney.  The attorney said in answer, very quietly this time:  \"Ah, that's cross-examining.  Let me say, sir, that no one can know that until the accountants to be appointed for the purpose have examined the affairs of the testator up to date.\"  Mr. Rupert St. Leger, who was looking all this time angrier than even the attorney or my father--though at what he had to be angry about I can't imagine--struck his fist on the table and rose up as if to speak, but as he caught sight of both old MacKelpie and the attorney he sat down again. _Mem._--Those three seem to agree too well.  I must keep a sharp eye on them.  I didn't think of this part any more at the time, for father asked another question which interested me much:  \"May I ask why the other matters of the Will are not shown to us?\"  The attorney wiped his spectacles carefully with a big silk bandanna handkerchief before he answered:  \"Simply because each of the two letters marked 'B' and 'C' is enclosed with instructions regarding their opening and the keeping secret of their contents.  I shall call your attention to the fact that both envelopes are sealed, and that the testator and both witnesses have signed their names across the flap of each envelope.  I shall read them.  The letter marked 'B,' directed to 'Rupert Sent Leger,' is thus endorsed:      \"'This letter is to be given to Rupert Sent Leger by the Trustees and     is to be opened by him in their presence.  He is to take such copy or     make such notes as he may wish and is then to hand the letter with     envelope to the Executors who are at once to read it, each of them     being entitled to make copy or notes if desirous of so doing.  The     letter is then to be replaced in its envelope and letter and envelope     are to be placed in another envelope to be endorsed on outside as to     its contents and to be signed across the flap by both the Executors     and by the said Rupert Sent Leger.                                            \"'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.  \"The letter marked 'C,' directed to 'Edward Bingham Trent,' is thus endorsed:      \"'This letter directed to Edward Bingham Trent is to be kept by him     unopened for a term of two years after the reading of my Last Will     unless said period is earlier terminated by either the acceptance or     refusal of Rupert Sent Leger to accept the conditions mentioned in my     letter to him marked 'B' which he is to receive and read in the     presence of my Executors at the same meeting as but subsequent to the     Reading of the clauses (except those to be ultimately numbers ten and     eleven) of my Last Will.  This letter contains instructions as to     what both the Executors and the said Rupert Sent Leger are to do when     such acceptance or refusal of the said Rupert Sent Leger has been     made known, or if he omit or refuse to make any such acceptance or     refusal, at the end of two years next after my decease.      \"'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.'\"  When the attorney had finished reading the last letter he put it carefully in his pocket.  Then he took the other letter in his hand, and stood up.  \"Mr. Rupert Sent Leger,\" he said, \"please to open this letter, and in such a way that all present may see that the memorandum at top of the contents is given as--      \"'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will.'\"  St. Leger rolled up his sleeves and cuffs just as if he was going to perform some sort of prestidigitation--it was very theatrical and ridiculous--then, his wrists being quite bare, he opened the envelope and took out the letter.  We all saw it quite well.  It was folded with the first page outward, and on the top was written a line just as the attorney said.  In obedience to a request from the attorney, he laid both letter and envelope on the table in front of him.  The clerk then rose up, and, after handing a piece of paper to the attorney, went back to his seat.  Mr. Trent, having written something on the paper, asked us all who were present, even the clerk and the shorthand man, to look at the memorandum on the letter and what was written on the envelope, and to sign the paper, which ran:  \"We the signatories of this paper hereby declare that we have seen the sealed letter marked B and enclosed in the Will of Roger Melton opened in the presence of us all including Mr. Edward Bingham Trent and Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie and we declare that the paper therein contained was headed 'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will' and that there were no other contents in the envelope.  In attestation of which we in the presence of each other append our signatures.\"  The attorney motioned to my father to begin.  Father is a cautious man, and he asked for a magnifying-glass, which was shortly brought to him by a clerk for whom the clerk in the room called.  Father examined the envelope all over very carefully, and also the memorandum at top of the paper.  Then, without a word, he signed the paper.  Father is a just man. Then we all signed.  The attorney folded the paper and put it in an envelope.  Before closing it he passed it round, and we all saw that it had not been tampered with.  Father took it out and read it, and then put it back.  Then the attorney asked us all to sign it across the flap, which we did.  Then he put the sealing-wax on it and asked father to seal it with his own seal.  He did so.  Then he and MacKelpie sealed it also with their own seals, Then he put it in another envelope, which he sealed himself, and he and MacKelpie signed it across the flap.  Then father stood up, and so did I.  So did the two men--the clerk and the shorthand writer.  Father did not say a word till we got out into the street.  We walked along, and presently we passed an open gate into the fields.  He turned back, saying to me:  \"Come in here.  There is no one about, and we can be quiet.  I want to speak to you.\"  When we sat down on a seat with none other near it, father said:  \"You are a student of the law.  What does all that mean?\"  I thought it a good occasion for an epigram, so I said one word:  \"Bilk!\"  \"H'm!\" said father; \"that is so far as you and I are concerned.  You with a beggarly ten thousand, and I with twenty.  But what is, or will be, the effect of those secret trusts?\"  \"Oh, that,\" I said, \"will, I dare say, be all right.  Uncle Roger evidently did not intend the older generation to benefit too much by his death.  But he only gave Rupert St. Leger one thousand pounds, whilst he gave me ten.  That looks as if he had more regard for the direct line. Of course--\"  Father interrupted me:  \"But what was the meaning of a further sum?\"  \"I don't know, father.  There was evidently some condition which he was to fulfil; but he evidently didn't expect that he would.  Why, otherwise, did he leave a second trust to Mr. Trent?\"  \"True!\" said father.  Then he went on: \"I wonder why he left those enormous sums to Trent and old MacKelpie.  They seem out of all proportion as executors' fees, unless--\"  \"Unless what, father?\"  \"Unless the fortune he has left is an enormous one.  That is why I asked.\"  \"And that,\" I laughed, \"is why he refused to answer.\"  \"Why, Ernest, it must run into big figures.\"  \"Right-ho, father.  The death-duties will be annoying.  What a"]]]
