That was about his kindest expression.  \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"You need somebody who can test and diagnose, and then make a repair.\"  \"And who is an astronaut, too,\" he said. \"I wonder if there is such a thing?\"  \"Make one,\" I suggested.  He scowled a little more fiercely. \"Explain that,\" he ordered.  \"I figure you could take one of our men from my laboratory, who knows how to test the gate, and a man who is handy enough with miniature components to cut out the one that failed and replace it, and teach him how to get around in a spacesuit. That would surer than hell be quicker than taking one of these hot-shot astronauts and teaching him solid-state physics.\"  \"Yes,\" he agreed, looking down his fingers. \"That was a pretty sneaky way to get out from between Fred Stone and me, young man.\"  I couldn't resist it: \"That's what took most of the three days,\" I said, just a little too smugly.  \"I liked you better in the middle,\" Cleary grumped. \"Well, you have a thought, and it calls for a conference.\" He took his coat off again, hung it on the clothes tree, came back to his desk and got on the phone.  \"Sylvia? Have Fred Stone come up, and you come in with him, eh? That's a dear.\"  He racked up the instrument and smiled at me as he stoked his pipe into more activity. \"Relax,\" he advised me. \"It always takes a while to round up Fred Stone.\"  He wanted no small talk, so I fidgeted in my chair while Cleary rocked gently in his. In about ten minutes, curly-headed Sylvia brought Dr. Stone in with her.         *       *       *       *       *  It was, \"Hello, Fred,\" and \"Hello there, Paul,\" when they came in. Sylvia didn't have anything to say, although she gave me a hot-eyed glance before pulling out the dictation board on Paul Cleary's desk and making herself comfortable with her notebook.  Cleary offered Doc Stone some of his tobacco, which was politely refused. The old man began it:  \"Your Dr. Seaman has quite an idea, Fred,\" he said, in a mild, kindly voice, with a dumb, guileless look on his face.  \"Good, Paul,\" Doc Stone smiled thinly. \"I've told you he's a good boy.\"  \"Hm-m-m,\" said Cleary. \"He says his tests can't prove what went wrong with the switching gate on the satellites, and in effect that the telemetry doesn't make it plain whether we have design or assembly trouble.\"  \"Well, _well_!\" said Fred Stone. I decided to start shopping for a marker for my grave.  \"Yes,\" Cleary said. \"He made quite a suggestion, that we send a man out in space to look over the Telstars and find out what went wrong. Even better, he says it might be possible to make a repair at the same time and get the bird working. You can see the advantages of doing that, the way they are orbiting.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" Doc Stone said, looking at me with slitted eyes. \"Quite a unique adventure for some technician.\"  \"Just what I was thinking,\" Cleary said. \"The problem resolves into: Who do we send? Now Mike, here, says we should take a man from his lab who knows the bird and its assembly and teach him how to get around in a spacesuit--that, he claims, would be quicker than taking one of these space jockeys and making a technician out of him.\"  \"I think he's right.\"  \"So--there we are. Who do we send?\"  \"There can hardly be any choice,\" Dr. Stone said, looking at me with eyes like granite.  \"Hardly,\" Cleary agreed. \"The head of the lab is the best man, beyond a doubt.\"  They were talking about me! Try to get out of taking sides, would I? Cleary wanted me back in the middle. Stone wanted me dead. They were both likely to get their way, unless I told them off.  I opened my mouth. Cleary cleared his throat loudly.  \"Oh, Dr. Seaman!\" Sylvia cut in, breaking her careful silence. \"What a thrilling opportunity for you!\"  I gaped at her. Well, Cleary had said it. She only went out with astronauts. She was space-happy.  \"There are men in the shop who deserve the chance....\" I started.  \"Nonsense!\" she said quickly. \"It's your idea, doctor, and you deserve the fame!\"  \"And the promotion this will undoubtedly earn--if you can bring it off,\" Cleary added.  \"Yes!\" Dr. Stone said with relish. He didn't think I could, either. Well, that made three of us, unless Sylvia made four.  \"Thank you very much,\" I started, as a prelude to backing out.  \"Good, that's settled,\" Cleary said. \"That's all, Sylvia.\"  She got up and left. She had done her dirty work. If I hadn't been so sick at my stomach, I would have had to admire really great teamwork.  Stone shook my hand with an evil kind of relish and followed her out.  That left Paul Cleary and me alone. \"This is a great thing, young man,\" he said.  I couldn't stand him any longer. \"You are a worm!\" I told him.  \"You're probably right, Mike,\" he agreed, without any particular heat. \"But a rather just one. I think you'll admit you've been paid off in your own coin. All you had to do was beg off.\"  \"In front of her? You knew I wouldn't.\"  \"I _figured_ you wouldn't. That's one of the advantages of being older. You know more about how the young will behave. Come on,\" he said, getting up to put on his coat again. \"We have to see a man.\"  \"One thing,\" I said, as I got up, \"while we're being so just.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"I had thought of asking your Sylvia for a date. But she was so snippy the other night I decided to forget it. Now, she got me into this, and she'll have to pay and pay! How do I get to her? It'll be quite a while before I'm an astronaut.\"  He took his pipe from between his teeth. \"This calls for the wisdom of a Solomon,\" he decided. \"But you might try oysters.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was pretty good advice. I hung behind him long enough to tell Sylvia about the Chincoteague oysters they put in the stew at Grand Central Terminal, and got a dinner date. That was all, just the date, because Cleary was itching to take me to see a man.  Politics must be an awfully large part of business. The man we went to see was the government side of COMCORP, and I guess he had had to do as much explaining about Telstar failures to a Senate Committee as Paul Cleary had had to do to the Western. He wanted an out just as bad as Paul did.  There were a good many conferences before a sufficient number of people decided the cheapest way out was to send a man to fix the Telstars that had broken down. The question was whether it was possible.  We went at it from two directions. They got a team assigned to figuring out if the Dyna-Soar rocket could be modified to make the three contacts around the orbit, carry two men and enough air and fuel for the job, and at COMCORP we appointed a crew to figure out what it meant to make the repair in orbit.  Cleary put me in charge of our crew. They gave me a full-size Telstar satellite for my lab, and I went to work.  Fancy electronic equipment consists of millions of parts, and Telstar is no exception. One of the bonuses America got from its poor rocket booster performance, as compared with the Russians, was a forced-draft course in miniaturization. Our engineers have learned how to make almost anything about one-tenth the size you'd think it ought to be, and still work. To get all these tiny parts into a total system, they are assembled in racks. In the Telstar each of these long skinny sticks of perforated magnesium alloy is hinged to the main framework so that it can be swung out for testing or for replacement of parts, which is why the engineers call each component a \"gate.\"  I spent several weeks learning how to take each suspected component out of the gate. Most of the time I needed a screwdriver. Sometimes I had to drill out a soft aluminium rivet. The hard part was that some of the components were so deep inside, even with a couple gates swung out the way, that I needed all kinds of extension tools.  Of course, I had to visualize what it would be like doing all this out in space. I'd be in a spacesuit, wearing thick gloves, and when I removed a screw that would have looked good in a Swiss watch, there'd be no work bench on which to place it while I took out the next one. Worse yet, I would have to put it back in.  The longer I worked with the parts, the harder it looked. There wouldn't be a prayer of just turning the parts loose in space. In theory they'd follow along in orbit. In practice you can't bring your hand to a halt and release a tiny part without imparting a small proper motion to it. And even worse, you couldn't handle the little wretches when you tried to put them back in. With a solid floor to lie on, with gravity to give things a position orientation, I kept losing tiny screws. Magnets didn't help, because the screws were nonmagnetic for what seemed pretty good reasons. Some were made of dural for lightness. Some were silicon bronze. None of them was steel.  That put us back in the lab to find out what would happen if we used steel screws. The answer was, surprisingly, nothing important. So there was one solid achievement. I had a few thousand of each of the thirty-four different sizes of fasteners machined from steel, and magnetized a fly-tier's tweezers. The result was that I could get screws back into their holes without dropping them, especially when I put little pads of Alnico on the point of each tweezer to give me a really potent magnet. Then we had to cook up an offset screwdriver with a ratchet that would let me reach in about a yard and still run a number 0-80 machine screw up tight. That called for a kind of torque-limit clutch and other snivies.  It was the fanciest and most expensive screwdriver you ever saw. The handle was a good two feet long. The problem then became that of seeing what you were doing, and one of the boys faked up a kind of binocular jeweler's loupe with long focus, so that I could lie back a yard from the screw and focus on it with about ten diameters magnification. The trouble was that the long focal length gave a field of vision about six times the diameter of the screw-head,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30679"],["title","The Trouble with Telstar (#3)"],["body","meant that every time my heart beat my head moved enough to throw the field of vision off the work.         *       *       *       *       *  By that time I was working in a simulated spacesuit--the actual number was still being made to fit an accurate plaster cast of my body. So the boys figured out a clamp that would hold my helmet firmly to the gate, and a chin rack inside the helmet against which I could press and hold my head steady enough to keep my binoculars focused where they had to be focused. At a certain point I went back to Paul Cleary and said I thought I could make the necessary tests, dismount what I had to dismount, and replace any affected part.  \"All worked out, eh?\" he said, reaching for his pipe.  \"Not by a county mile, Mr. Cleary. But I know what the problems are, and the shop can figure out sensible answers. Some of the hardest parts turned out to be the easiest.\"  \"Name any three,\" he suggested.  \"Well, the screws. As I take them out, I'll discard them into space. I have to use magnetic screws on reassembly, so there is no point saving what I take out. Doug Folley has doped out something like a motorman's change-dispenser that will dispense one screw at a time into my tweezers, and I'll carry a supply of all thirty-four kinds at my waist.\"  \"That's one,\" he counted on a hairy forefinger.  \"We can use something like a double-faced pressure-sensitive tape to hold other parts,\" I said. \"We'll draw a diagram on it, stick it to some unopened part of the satellite near where I'm working, and as I pull pieces out, I'll just press them against the other sticky face, in the correct place in the diagram, and they'll be there to pull loose when I want them.\"  \"At absolute zero?\" he scoffed. \"That sticky face will be hard as glass.\"  \"We'll face the bird around to the sun,\" I said. \"And warm it up. If we have to, we'll put wiring in the tape, connect it to Telstar's battery supply, and keep it warm.\"  \"Might work,\" he grumped. \"That's two. How about the spacesuit part?\"  That had been tougher. Some forty or fifty men had made the ride into space and back from Cape Canaveral by this time, and there had been rendezvous in space in preparation for flights to the moon. But so far no one had done any free maneuvering in space in a suit.  [Illustration]  They had put me in a swimming pool in a concentrated salt solution that gave me just zero buoyancy, and I had practiced a kind of skin-diving in a spacesuit. The problem was one of mobility, and the one thing we could not reproduce, of course, was frictionless motion. No matter how I moved, the viscosity of the solution quickly slowed me down. Out in space I'd have to learn on the first try how to get around where every force imparted a motion that would continue indefinitely until an equal and opposite force had been applied.  The force part had been worked out in theory long before. To my spacesuit they had fixed two tiny rockets. One aimed out from the small of my back, the other straight out from my belly. Two pressurized containers contained hydrazine and nitric acid, which could be released in tiny streams into peanut rocket chambers by a single valve-release. They were self-igniting, and spurted out a needle-fine jet of fire that imparted a few dynes of force as long as the valve was held open. It only had two positions--full open, or closed, so that navigation would consist of triggering the valve briefly open until a little push had been imparted, and drifting until you triggered the opposite rocket for braking.  The airtanks on my back were right off a scuba outfit.  Really, they spent more time on the gloves than anything else. At first we thought of the problem as a heat problem, but it was tougher than that. Heat loss was not much, out there in a vacuum, and they made arrangements to warm the handles of my tools so that I wouldn't bleed heat through my gloves to them and thus freeze my fingers. No, the problem was to get a glove that stood up to a pressure difference of three or four pounds per square inch and could still be flexed with any accuracy by my fingers. We could make a glove that was pretty thin, but it stiffened out under pressure and made delicate work really tough. It was a lot like trying to do brain surgery in mittens.  They eventually gave me a porous glove that leaked air when you flexed your fingers. Air, they said, could always be gotten from the Dyna-Soar rocket that would be hanging close at hand in space. Well, we hoped it would work. I could do pretty fair work with the leaky gloves, and all we could hope was that the vapor would be dry enough as it seeped out through the gloves to prevent formation of a foggy cloud all around me, or the formation of frost on the gloves. That we could not test under any conditions easy to simulate.  Each team spent ninety days. They tell me that's right quick work for pointing up a launch. But at the end of three months I had assembled enough stuff to do the job, and still well within the weight limit they had to set. I wasn't a walking machine shop, but there was a lot I could do if I had to.         *       *       *       *       *  Ninety days had been enough for several dates with Sylvia. Out of the office she wasn't quite the protective harpy about Paul Cleary that she had been in the office, although the thought was never far from her mind.  We spent my final night in New York before leaving for the Cape at Sweets, a real old fashioned seafood house down on Fulton street. After the obligatory oysters, we had broiled bluefish, and otherwise lived it up. They serve a good piece of apple pie, and we had that with our coffee.  \"Are you scared?\" Sylvia asked me.  \"Of what?\" I lied innocently.  \"Of being out in space--just floating around?\"  \"Yes,\" I told her honestly. \"I'm scared to death. What if I have a queasy stomach? They say a good half of the men who have been in orbit have chucked up or gotten dizzy or something. What if they go to all this trouble and I get spacesick?\"  \"What if you drift away and can't get back?\" she said. \"It isn't like swimming back to shore.\"  \"There's always a way,\" I said, my stomach tightening as I thought of what she said.  That was the night she kissed me good night. It wasn't much of a kiss, because we were standing in the lobby of her apartment house, and she wasn't going to invite me up, because she never did. But she said: \"Hurry back.\"  \"Just you know it, Shouff,\" I said, bitter inside.  I'd have been a lot more bitter if I had known what was in store for me at the Cape. COMCORP flew me down in one of our private prop-jets, with only Paul Cleary for company. He introduced me to the brass, and we sat through a couple conferences while the idea was spelled out to a group of sure-enough spacemen. Then they turned that mob loose on me.  I was emotionally unprepared. First off, Cleary and Fred had been building me up all through the three months, and I had actually gotten to the point where I thought I knew what I was doing. These space-jockeys spent most of their time deflating my ego.  My tormentor-in-chief was a wise punk from Brooklyn named Sid Stein. \"How have you made out in your centrifuge tests?\" he asked me at breakfast the first morning after I had reached the Cape.  \"I have never done any of that stuff, Mr. Stein,\" I said.  \"Well, how many gees can you pull?\"  I shrugged. \"Same as you, I suppose. How many is that?\"  \"Brot_her_!\"  The space medic wasn't any better. The mission chief insisted that it wasn't safe to put anybody in a satellite who couldn't pass the physical. I guess you know that about one man in a thousand can qualify. This was supposed to wash me out.  \"Remarkable shape.\" The space medic kept saying. \"You must take considerable exercise, doctor.\"  \"Oh, no,\" I said. \"Just jog a mile or so before breakfast. Nothing spectacular.\"  \"No other formal activity?\"  \"Well,\" I snarled, \"just swimming, fencing and weight lifting. I've given up the boxing and handball.\"  \"Kept in excellent shape, nevertheless,\" he said. \"You'll be a disappointment to them.\"  \"Look,\" Stein said to me after a week of tests and countertests. \"Don't be deceived by these tests. All they show is that your heart is still beating. The big thing is emotional. Doc, I think you should reconsider this idea of flopping around out there in the void. We've got experienced men here, and none of them is ready to try it.\"  \"Fools rush in, eh, Mr. Stein.\"  \"Precisely.\"  In the meantime I got a daily phone call from Paul Cleary. That I could have snarled off, but Sylvia always came on the line first, and there was a minute or so of chit-chat before she cut her boss in on the line. I'm sure she listened to all the calls. But her first words were deadly. For example:  \"Mike! Hi, Mike. Mr. Cleary wants to see how you're doing.\"  \"Good. Put him on.\"  \"In a minute. I think it's so wonderful you passed the final physical, Mike. You're really so deceptive. I never had imagined you had such a steely physique.\"  \"Clean living,\" I said. \"No girls.\"  \"There'd better not be!\"  \"Don't worry. How could I get to see any girls down here? Every time I look away from my work all I can see is Bikini swim suits.\"  \"Cut that out!\" she snickered, and put Cleary on the line.         *       *       *       *       *  There came a final day when the mission chief called me in to his office.  \"Come in, Mike. Come in,\" he said shortly. \"Sit down.\" He leaned back against his desk and started talking to me, like they say, straight from the shoulder:  \"I'll give it to you straight, Mike. We've tried every legal way to wash you out of this mission. There isn't a one of us here at the Cape that wants any part of taking an armchair theorist and slapping him into space--into the kind of a mission you've cooked up. Somebody's going to get hurt out there, because you aren't fit for the job. Now, physically, yes, you have the capacity. But emotionally and environmentally, you simply don't add up. You'"]]]
