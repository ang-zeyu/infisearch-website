We are empowered to use our judgment in all circumstances. And in this particular instance I believe I can convince you that the course I suggest is the more just one.\" He turned to Toolls. \"Just what stage of cultural development would you say this creature's race has attained?\"  \"It still retains more of an animal-like adaptation to its surroundings than an intellectual one,\" Toolls replied. \"Its civilization is divided into various sized units of cooperation which it calls governments. Each unit vies with the others for a greater share of its world's goods. That same rivalry is carried down to the individual within the unit. Each strives for acquisition against his neighbor.  \"Further they retain many of their tribal instincts, such as gregariousness, emotional rather than intellectual propagation, and worship of the mightiest fighter. This last, however, is manifested by reverence for individuals attaining position of authority, or acquiring large amounts of their medium of exchange, rather than by physical superiority.\"  \"That's what I mean,\" Macker said. \"Our policy in the past has been to avoid tampering, only because of the fear of bringing harm. If we created a super being among them, to act as a controlling and harmonizing force, we'd hasten their development by thousands of years. We'd be granting them the greatest possible boon!\"  \"I don't know,\" Remm said, obviously swayed by Macker's logic. \"I'm still hesitant about introducing a being into their midst whose thought processes would be so subtle and superior to their own. How do you feel about it, Toolls?\"  \"What would they have to lose?\" Toolls asked with his penchant for striking the core of an argument.  \"The right or wrong of such moral and philosophical considerations has always been a delicate thing to decide,\" Remm acquiesced reluctantly. \"Go ahead if you think it is the right thing to do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"All finished?\" Macker asked.  \"That depends on how much you want me to do,\" Toolls replied. \"I've substituted our 'heavy' substances for his entire body structure, including the brain--at the same time transferring his former memory and habit impressions. That was necessary if he is to be able to care for himself. Also I brought his muscular reaction time up to our norm, and speeded his reflexes.\"  \"Have you implanted any techniques which he did not possess before, such as far-seeing, or mental insight?\" Macker asked.  \"No,\" Toolls said. \"That is what I want your advice about. Just how much should I reveal about ourselves and our background? Or should he be left without any knowledge of us?\"  \"Well ...\" Now that the others had deferred to Macker's arguments, he had lost much of his certainty. \"Perhaps we should at least let him know who we are, and what we have done. That would save him much alarm and perplexity when it comes time to reorient himself. On the other hand, perhaps we should go even farther and implant the knowledge of some of our sciences. Then he could do a better job of advancing his people. But maybe I'm wrong. What do you think about it, Remm?\"  \"My personal opinion,\" Remm said, \"is that we can't give him much of our science, because it would be like giving a baby a high explosive to play with. His race is much too primitive to handle it wisely. Either he, or someone to whom he imparts what we teach him, would be certain to bring catastrophe to his world. And if we let him learn less, but still remember his contact with us, in time his race would very likely come to regard us as gods. I would hesitate to drag in any metaphysical confusion to add to the uncertainties you are already engendering. My advice would be to wipe his mind of all memory of us. Let him explain his new found invincibility to himself in his own way.\"  Macker had no criticism to offer to this suggestion. \"Does he retain any of his immunity to this world's malignant germs?\" he asked.  \"They are too impotent to represent any hazard to his present body mechanism,\" Toolls replied. \"If and when he dies, it will not be from disease.\"  \"He will be subject to the deterioration of old age, the same as we are, won't he?\" Macker asked.  \"Of course,\" Toolls said, \"but that's the only thing that will be able to bring him down. He cannot be harmed by any force this 'light' world can produce; he is impervious to sickness; and he will live indefinitely.\"  \"Indefinitely?\"  \"As his world reckons time. Their normal life span is less than a hundred years. Ours is over five thousand. He will probably live approximately twice that long, because he will be subjected to less stress and strain, living as he does on a world of lighter elements.\"  \"Then we have truly made a superman,\" Macker's tones inflected satisfaction. \"I wish we were returning this way in a thousand years or so. I'd like to see the monumental changes he will effect.\"  \"We may at that,\" Remm said, \"or others of our people will. He will probably be a living legend by then. I'd like to hear what his race has to say about him. Do they have names with which to differentiate individuals?\"  \"Yes,\" Toolls said. \"This one has a family designation of Pollnow, and a member designation of Orville.\"  \"It will be necessary for us to leave in exactly ten minutes,\" Remm reminded them. \"Our next stopping place--the red star--will reach its nearest conjunction with this planet by the time we meet it out in space.\"  \"Then we will have time to do nothing more for him before we go,\" Macker said. \"But as far as I can see we've forgotten nothing, have we, Toolls?\"  \"Nothing,\" Toolls answered. \"No--we forgot nothing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  But Toolls was wrong. They had forgotten one thing. A minor detail, relatively....  On Toolls' world his race, in the course of its evolution, had adjusted itself to its own particular environment. Logically, the final result was that they evolved into beings best able to survive in that environment. As such their food--a \"heavy,\" highly concentrated food--was ideally suited to supply the needs of their \"heavy,\" tremendously avid organisms.  Orville Pollnow had no such food available. His body--no larger than before--had an Earth mass of one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. One hundred and eighty thousand pounds--the weight of twelve hundred average sized men--of fiercely burning, intense virility. Even continuous eating--of his own world's food--could not supply the demands of that body.  Twenty-four hours after the aliens left, Pollnow was dead--of starvation.

The Star had been designed to be much more than a convenient transfer station for travelers and freight; for some years after it was opened to the public, it retained a high rating among the more exotic pleasure resorts of the Hub. The Seventh Star Hotel was the place to have been that season, and the celebrities and fat cats converged on it with their pals and hangers-on. The Star blazed with life, excitement, interstellar scandals, tinkled with streams of credits dancing in from a thousand worlds. In short, it had started out as a paying proposition.  But gradually things changed. The Star's entertainment remained as delightfully outrageous as ever, the cuisine as excellent; the accommodations and service were still above reproach. The fleecing, in general, became no less expertly painless. But one had _been_ there. By its eighth year, the Star was dated. Now, in its twelfth, it lived soberly off the liner and freighter trade, four fifths of the guest suites shut down, the remainder irregularly occupied between ship departures.  And in another seven hours, if the plans of certain men went through, the Seventh Star Hotel would abruptly wink out of existence.         *       *       *       *       *  Some fifty or sixty early diners were scattered about the tables on the garden terraces of Phalagon House, the Seventh Star Hotel's most exclusive eatery. One of them had just finished his meal, sat smoking and regarding a spiraling flow of exquisitely indicated female figures across the garden's skyscape with an air of friendly approval. He was a large and muscular young man, deeply tanned, with shoulders of impressive thickness, an aquiline nose, and dark, reflective eyes.  After a minute or two, he yawned comfortably, put out the cigarette, and pushed his chair back from the table. As he came to his feet, there was a soft bell-note from the table ComWeb. He hesitated, said, \"Go ahead.\"  \"Is intrusion permitted?\" the ComWeb inquired.  \"Depends,\" the guest said. \"Who's calling?\"  \"The name is Reetal Destone.\"  He grinned, appeared pleasantly surprised. \"Put the lady through.\"  There was a brief silence. Then a woman's voice inquired softly, \"Quillan?\"  \"Right here, doll! Where--\"  \"Seal the ComWeb, Quillan.\"  He reached down to the instrument, tapped the seal button, said, \"All right. We're private.\"  \"Probably,\" the woman's voice said. \"But better scramble this, too. I want to be very sure no one's listening.\"  Quillan grunted, slid his left hand into an inner coat pocket, briefly fingered a device of the approximate size and shape of a cigarette, drew his hand out again. \"Scrambling!\" he announced. \"Now, what--\"  \"Mayday, Quillan,\" the soft voice said. \"Can you come immediately?\"  Quillan's face went expressionless. \"Of course. Is it urgent?\"  \"I'm in no present danger. But we'd better waste no time.\"  \"Is it going to take real hardware? I'm carrying a finger gun at the moment.\"  \"Then go to your rooms and pick up something useful,\" Reetal said. \"This should take real hardware, all right.\"  \"All right. Then where do I go?\"  \"I'll meet you at your door. I know where it is.\"  When Quillan arrived, she was standing before the door to his suite, a tall blonde in a sleeveless black and gold sheath; a beautiful body, a warm, lovely, humorous face. The warmth and humor were real, but masked a mind as impersonally efficient as a computer, and a taste for high and dangerous living. When Quillan had last met Reetal Destone, a year and a half before, the taste was being satisfied in industrial espionage. He hadn't heard of her activities since then.  She smiled thoughtfully at him as he came up. \"I'll wait outside,\" she said. \"We're not talking here.\"  Quillan nodded, went on into his living room, selected a gun belt and holstered gun from a suitcase, fastened the belt around his waist under the coat, and came out. \"Now what?\"  \"First a little portal-hopping--\"  He followed her across the corridor and into a tube portal, watched as she tapped out a setting. The exit light flashed a moment later; they stepped out into a vacant lounge elsewhere in the same building, crossed it, entered another portal. After three more shifts, they emerged into a long hall, dimly lit, heavily carpeted. There was no one in sight.  \"Last stop,\" Reetal said. She glanced up at his face. \"We're on the other side of the Star now, in one of the sections they've closed up. I've established a kind of emergency headquarters here. The Star's nearly broke, did you know?\"  \"I'd heard of it.\"  \"That appears to be part of the reason for what's going on.\"  Quillan said, \"What's going on?\"  Reetal slid her arm through his, said, \"Come on. That's my, hm-m-m, unregistered suite over there. Big boy, it's very, very selfish of me, but I was extremely glad to detect your name on the list of newly arrived guests just now! As to what's going on ... the _Camelot_ berths here at midnight, you know.\"  Quillan nodded. \"I've some business with one of her passengers.\"  Reetal bent to unlock the entrance door to the indicated suite. \"The way it looks now,\" she remarked, \"the odds are pretty high that you're not going to keep that appointment.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because shortly after the _Camelot_ docks and something's been unloaded from her, the _Camelot_ and the Seventh Star Hotel are scheduled to go _poof!_ together. Along with you, me, and some twelve thousand other people. And, so far, I haven't been able to think of a good way to keep it from happening.\"  Quillan was silent a moment. \"Who's scheduling the poof?\" he asked.  \"Some old acquaintances of ours are among them. Come on in. What they're doing comes under the heading of destroying the evidence.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She locked the door behind them, said, \"Just a moment,\" went over to the paneled wall, turned down a tiny silver switch. \"Room portal,\" she said, nodding at the wall. \"It might come in handy. I keep it turned off most of the time.\"  \"Why are you turning it on now?\" Quillan asked.  \"One of the Star's stewards is working on this with me. He'll be along as soon as he can get away. Now I'll give you the whole thing as briefly as I can. The old acquaintances I mentioned are some boys of the Brotherhood of Beldon. Movaine's here; he's got Marras Cooms and Fluel with him, and around thirty of the Brotherhood's top guns. Nome Lancion's coming in on the _Camelot_ in person tonight to take charge. Obviously, with all that brass on the job, they're after something very big. Just what it is, I don't yet know. I've got one clue, but a rather puzzling one. Tell you about that later. Do you know Velladon?\"  \"The commodore here?\" Quillan nodded. \"I've never met him but I know who he is.\"  Reetal said, \"He's been manager of the Seventh Star Hotel for the past nine years. He's involved in the Beldon outfit's operation. So is the chief of the Star's private security force--his name's Ryter--and half a dozen other Star executives. They've got plenty of firepower, too; close to half the entire security force, I understand, including all the officers. That would come to nearly seventy men. There's reason to believe the rest of the force was disarmed and murdered by them in the subspace section of the Star about twelve hours ago. They haven't been seen since then.  \"Now, Velladon, aside from his share in whatever they're after, has another reason for wanting to wipe out the Star in an unexplained blowup. There I have definite information. Did you know the Mooley brothers owned the Star?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I've been working for the Mooleys the past eight months,\" Reetal said, \"checking up on employees at Velladon's level for indications of graft. And it appears the commodore had been robbing them blind here for at least several years.\"  \"Sort of risky thing to try with the Mooleys, from what I hear,\" Quillan remarked.  \"Yes. Very. Velladon had reason to be getting a little desperate about that. Two men were planted here a month ago. One of them is Sher Heraga, the steward I told you about. The other man came in as a bookkeeper. Two weeks ago, Heraga got word out that the bookkeeper had disappeared. Velladon and Ryter apparently got wise to what he was trying to do. So the Mooleys sent me here to find out exactly what was going on before they took action. I arrived four days ago.\"  She gave a regretful little headshake. \"I waited almost a day before contacting Heraga. It seemed advisable to move very cautiously in the matter. But that made it a little too late to do anything. Quillan, for the past three days, the Seventh Star Hotel has been locked up like a bank vault. And except for ourselves, only the people who are in on the plot are aware of it.\"  \"The message transmitters are inoperative?\" he asked.  Reetal nodded. \"The story is that a gravitic storm center in the area has disrupted transmissions completely for the time being.\"  \"What about incoming ships?\"  \"Yours was the only one scheduled before the _Camelot_ arrives. It left again eight hours ago. Nobody here had been let"]]]
