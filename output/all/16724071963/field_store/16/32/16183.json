Finally, I called my son, Steve, at the apartment we shared, told him I wouldn't be home that night, and sacked out in the ready room.  By nine o'clock, I was ready to go back to work.  At nine thirty, Kleek called. His saggy face looked sleepier and more bored than ever. \"No rest for the weary, Roy. I got a call on a killing on the Upper East Side. Some rich gal with too much time on her hands was having an all-night party, and she got herself shot to death. It looks like her husband did it, but there's plenty of money involved, and the Deputy Commissioner wants me to handle it personally, all the way through. I'm putting Lieutenant Shultz in charge of the Homicide end of the Donahue case, but I told him you were the man to listen to. He'll report directly to you if there's any new leads. O.K.?\"  \"O.K. with me, Sam.\" As I said, Kleek is a good cop in spite of his \"system.\"  \"The boys are out making the rounds,\" he went on, \"bringing in all the men with conviction records and questioning the others. And we're combing the neighborhood for the kid's clothes. They might still be around somewhere. Shultz'll keep you posted.\"  \"Fine, Sam. Happy hunting in High Society.\"  \"Thanks, Roy. Take it easy.\"  At fifteen of eleven, the Police Commissioner called. He spent ten minutes telling me that I was going to be visited by a VIP and giving me exact instructions on how to handle the man. \"I'm depending on you to take care of him, Roy,\" he said finally. \"If we can get this program operating in other places, it will help us a lot. And if you need help from my office, grab the nearest phone.\"  \"I'll do my best,\" I promised him. \"And thanks, sir.\"  The Commissioner was a lawyer, not a cop, so he wasn't as tied to the system as Kleek and the others were. He was backing me all the way.  I punched Sergeant Vanney's number on the intercom. \"Inspector Royall here, Sergeant. Do me a favor.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Go down to the library and get me a copy of Burke's 'Peerage.'\"  \"Burke's which, sir?\"  I repeated it and spelled it for him. He didn't waste any time; he had it on my desk in less than twenty minutes. When the VIP arrived, I had already read up on Chief Inspector, The Duke of Acrington.  Here's how he was listed:  _ACRINGTON, Seventh Duke of (Robert St. James Acrington) Baron Bennevis of Scotland, K. C. B.: Born 7 November 1950, B.S., M.S., Oxon.,_ cum laude. _Married (1977) Lady Susan Burley, 2nd dau. Viscount Burley. 2 sons, Richard St. James, Philip William._  [Illustration]  _Joined Metropolitan Police (1975); C. I. D. (1976); dep. Insp. (1980); Insp. (1984); Ch. Insp. (1990). Awarded George Medal for extraordinary heroism during the False War (1981)._  _Author_ Criminal Law and the United Nations, The Use of Forensic Psychology (_police textbook_), _and_ The Night People (_fiction; under nom de plume R. A. James_).  _Clubs: Royal Astronomical, Oxonian, Baker Street Irregulars._  _Motto: Amicus Curiae._  I had to admit that I was impressed, but I decided to withhold any judgment until I had met the man.         *       *       *       *       *  He was right on time for his appointment. The car pulled up to the parking lot with a sergeant at the wheel, and I got a bird's eye view of him from my window as he got out of the car and headed for the door. I had to grin a little; the Commissioner had obviously wanted to take the visitor around personally--roll out the rug for royalty, so to speak--but he had had a conference scheduled with the Mayor and some Federal officials, and, after all, the duke was only here on police business, not as Ambassador from the Court of St. James. So he ended up being treated just as any visitor from Scotland Yard would be treated.  He was shown directly to my office, and I gave him a quick once-over as he came in the door. Tall, about six feet even; weight about 175, none of it surplus fat; light brown hair smoothed neatly back, almost no gray; eyes, blue-gray, with finely-etched lines around them that indicated they'd been formed by both smiles and frowns: face, rather long and bony, with thin, firm lips and a longish, thin, slightly curved nose. He wore good clothes, and he wore them well. His age, I knew; it was the same as mine. It was the first time I had ever seen a man who looked like a real aristocrat and a good cop rolled into one.  He had an easy smile on his face, and his eyes were taking me in, too. I stand an inch under six feet, but I'm a little broader across the shoulders than he, so the ten more pounds I carry doesn't make me look fat. My face is definitely not aristocratic--wide and square, with a nose that shows a slight bend where it was broken when I was a rookie, heavy, dark eyebrows, and hair that is receding a little on top and graying perceptibly at the sides. The eyes are a dark gray, and I'm well aware that the men under me call me \"Old Flint-eye\" when I put the pressure on them.  \"I'm Chief Inspector Acrington,\" he said pleasantly, giving me a firm handshake.  \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace,\" I said. \"I'm Inspector Royall. Sit down, won't you?\" I gestured toward one of the upholstered guest chairs, and sat down in the other one myself, so we wouldn't have the desk between us. \"Have a good trip across?\" I asked.  \"Fine. Except, of course, for the noise.\"  \"Noise?\" I knew he'd come over in one of the Transatlantic Airways' new inertia-drive ships, and they're supposed to be fairly quiet.  His smile broadened a trifle. \"Exactly. There wasn't any. I'm rather used to the vibration of jets, and these new jobs float along at a hundred thousand feet in the deadest silence you ever heard--if you'll pardon the oxymoron. Everybody chattered like a flight of starlings, just to keep the air full of sound.\"  I chuckled. \"Maybe they'll put vibrators on them, just to make the people feel comfortable. I read that the men in the moon ships complain about the same thing.\"  \"So I've heard. But, actually, the silence is a minor thing when one realizes the time one saves. When one is looking forward to something interesting, traveling can be deadly dull.\"  It was beautiful, the way he did it. He had told me plainly that he wanted to get down to business and cut the small talk, but he'd done it in such a way that the transition was frictionlessly smooth.  \"Not much scenery up there,\" I said. \"I hope you'll find what we're trying to do here has a few more points of interest.\"  \"I'm quite sure it will, from what I've heard of your pilot project here. That's why I want to, well, sort of be a hanger-on for a few days, if that's all right with you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Before I could answer, the phone blinked. I excused myself to the Duke and cut in. The image that came on the screen was almost myself, except that he had his mother's mouth and was twenty-odd years younger.  \"Hi, Dad,\" he said, with that apologetic smile of his. \"Sorry to bother you during office hours, but could I borrow fifty? Pay you back next week.\"  I threw a phony scowl at him. \"Running short, eh? Have you been betting on the stickball teams again?\"  He cast his eyes skyward, and raised the three fingers of his right hand. \"Scout's Honor, Dad, I spent it on a new turbine for my ElectroFord.\" Then he lowered his hand and looked down from the upper regions. \"I really did. I forgot that I was supposed to take Mary Ellen out this evening. Car-happy, I guess. Can you advance the fifty?\"  I threw away my phony scowl and gave him a smile. \"Sure, Stevie. How's Mary Ellen?\"  \"Swell. She's all excited about going to the Art Ball tonight--that's why I didn't want to disappoint her.\"  \"Slow up, son,\" I told him, \"you've already made your pitch and been accepted. You'll get your fifty, so don't push it. Want to come down here and pick it up?\"  \"Can do. And have I told you that you'll be invited to the wedding?\"  \"Thanks, pal. Can I give the groom away?\" It was a family joke that we'd kicked back and forth ever since he had met Mary Ellen, two years before.  \"Sure thing. See you in a couple of hours. Bye, Dad.\" He cut off, and I looked at the Duke.  \"Sorry. Now, you were saying?\"  \"Perfectly all right.\" He smiled. \"I have two of my own at home.  \"At any rate, I was saying that the Criminal Investigation Department of New Scotland Yard has become interested in this experiment of yours, so I was sent over to get all the first-hand information I can. Frankly, I volunteered for the job; I was eager to come. There are plenty of skeptics at the Yard, I'll admit, but I'm not one of them. If the thing's workable, I want to see it used in England.\"  Here was another man who wasn't tied to the \"system.\"  \"D'you mind if I ask some questions?\" he said.  \"Go ahead, Your Grace. If I can't answer 'em, I'll say so.\"  \"Thanks. First off, I'll tell you what I _do_ know--get my own knowledge of the background straight, so to speak. Now, as I understand it, the courts have agreed--temporarily, at least--that any person convicted of certain types of crimes must undergo a psychiatric examination before sentencing. Right?\"  \"That's right.\"  \"Then, depending on the result of that examination, the magistrate of the court may sentence the offender to undertake psychiatric therapy instead of sending him to a penal institution, such time in therapy not to exceed the maximum time of imprisonment originally provided for the offense under the law.  \"His sentence is suspended, in other words, if he will agree to the therapy. If, after he is released by the psychiatrists, he behaves himself, he is not imprisoned. If he misbehaves, he must serve out the original sentence, plus any new sentence that may be imposed. Have I got it straight so far?\"  \"Perfectly.\"  \"As I understand it, you've had astounding success.\" He looked, in spite of what he had said about skepticism, as though he thought the reports he'd heard were exaggerated.  \"So far,\" I said evenly, \"not a single one of our 'patient"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30832"],["title","Nor Iron Bars a Cage.... (#3)"],["body","s' has failed us.\"  He looked amazed, but he didn't doubt me. \"And you've been in operation for how long?\"  \"A little over a year since the first case. But I think the record will stand the same way five, ten, fifty years from now.  \"You see, Your Grace, we don't _dare_ lose a man. If one of our tame zanies goes haywire again, the courts will stop this pilot project _fast_. There's a lot of pressure against us.  \"In the first place, we only work with repeaters. You know the type. The world is full of them. The boys that are picked up over and over again for the same kind of crime.\"  He nodded. \"They're the ones we wait for. The ones we catch, convict, and send to prison--and then wait until they get out, and then wait some more until they commit their next crime, so that we can catch them and start the whole cycle over again.\"  \"That's them,\" I said. \"When they're out, they're just between crimes, that's all. And that puts the police in a hell of a position, doesn't it? You _know_ they're going to fall again; you know that they're going to rob, or hurt, or kill someone. But there's nothing you can do about it. You're helpless. No police force has enough men to enable a cop to be assigned to every known repeater and follow him night and day.  \"In this state, if a man is convicted of a felony for a fourth time, a life sentence is mandatory. _But that means that at least four victims have to be sacrificed before the dangerous man is removed from society!_\"  The Duke nodded thoughtfully. \"'Sacrifice' is the word. Go on.\"  \"Now, the type of crime we're working with--the kind we expect future laws to apply to--is strictly limited. It must be a crime of violence against a human being, or a crime of destruction in which there is a grave danger that human lives may be lost. The sex maniac, the firebug, or the goon who gets a thrill out of beating people. Or the reckless driver who has proven that he can't be trusted behind the wheel of a car.  \"We can't touch the kleptomaniac or the common drunk or the drug addict. They're already provided for under other laws. And those habits are not, _by themselves_, dangerous to the lives of others. A good many of our kind of zany _do_ drink or take drugs--about fifty per cent of them. But what they're sentenced for is crimes of violence, not for guzzling hooch or mainlining heroin.\"         *       *       *       *       *  My phone chimed. It was Lieutenant Shultz, of Homicide. His square, blocky face held a trace of excitement. \"Inspector Royall, Inspector Kleek told me to report to you if there was any news in the Donahue case.\"  \"What is it, Lieutenant?\"  \"We're pretty sure of our man. Scrapings from the kid's fingernails gave us his blood type. The computer narrowed the list down quite a bit with that data. Then, a few minutes ago, one of the boys found the kid's clothes stuffed in with some trash paper in the back stairwell of a condemned building just a couple of blocks from where we found her last night.  \"And--get this, Inspector!--she was wearing a pair of those shiny patent-leather shoes, practically brand-new, and they have prints all over them! His are over hers, since he was the last one to handle them, and there's only the two sets of prints! We just now got positive identification.\"  \"Grab him and bring him in,\" I said. \"I'll be right down. I want to talk to him.\"  His face fell a little. \"Well, it isn't going to be as easy as all that, sir. You see, we'd already checked at his last known address, earlier this morning, before we got the final check on the blood type. This guy left the rooming house he was staying in--checked out two days ago, just a short time after the girl was killed. I figured that looked queer at the time, so I had two of my men start tracing him in particular. But there's not a sign of him so far.\"  I untensed myself. \"O.K. What's his record?\"  \"Periodic drunk. Goes for weeks without touching the stuff, then he goes out on a binge that lasts for a week sometimes.  \"Name's Lawrence Nestor, alias Larry Nestor. Twenty-eight years old, six feet one inch, slight build, but considered fairly strong. Brown hair, brown eyes. Speaks with a lisp due to a dental defect; the lisp becomes more noticeable when he's drinking.\" He turned the page of the report he was reading from. \"Arrested for drunkenness four times in the past five years, got off with a fine when he pleaded guilty. He molested a little girl two years ago and was picked up for questioning, but nothing came of it. The girl hadn't been physically hurt, and she couldn't make a positive identification, so he was released from custody.  \"Officers on duty in the neighborhood report that he has frequently been seen talking to small children, usually girls, but he wasn't seen to molest them in any way, and there were no complaints from parents, so no action could be taken.\"  Lieutenant Shultz looked up from the paper. \"He's had all kinds of jobs, but he can't hold 'em very long. Goes on a binge, doesn't show up for work, so they fire him. He's a pretty good short-order cook, and that's the kind of work he likes, if he can talk a lunch room into hiring him. He's also been a bus boy, a tavern porter, and a janitor.  \"One other thing: The superintendent at the place where he was staying reports that he had an unusual amount of money on him--four or five hundred dollars he thinks. Doesn't know where Nestor got the money, but he's been boozing it up for the past five days. Bought new clothes--hat, suit, shoes, and so on. Living high on the hog, I guess.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I thought for a minute. If he had money, he could be anywhere in the world by now. On the other hand--  \"Look, Lieutenant, you haven't said anything to the newsmen yet, have you?\"  He looked surprised. \"No. I called you first. But I figured they could help us. Plaster his picture and name all over the area, and somebody will be bound to recognize him.\"  \"Somebody might kill him, too, and I don't want that. Look at it this way: If he had sense enough to get out of the local area two days ago and really get himself lost, then it won't hurt to wait twenty-four hours or so to release the story. On the other hand, if he's still in the city or over in Jersey, he could still get out before the news was so widespread that he'd be spotted by very many people.  \"But if he's still drinking and thinks he's safe, we may be able to get a lead on him. I have a hunch he's still in the city. So hold off on that release to the newsmen as long as you can. Don't let it leak.  \"Meanwhile, check all the transportation terminals. Find out if he's ever been issued a passport. If he has, check the foreign consuls here in the city to see if he got a visa. Notify the FBI; they're back in it now, since there's a chance that he may have crossed a state line--unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.  \"And tell the boys that do the footwork that they're to say that the guy they're looking for is wanted by the Missing Persons Bureau--that he left home and his wife is looking for him. Don't connect him up with the Donahue case at all. Have every beat patrolman in the city on the lookout for a drunk with a lisp, but tell them the same story about the wife; I don't want any leaks at all.  \"I'll call the Commissioner right away to get his O.K., because I don't want either one of us to get in hot water over this. If he's with us, we'll go ahead as planned; if he's not, we'll just have to call in the newsmen. O.K.?\"  \"Sure, Inspector. Whatever you say. I'll get right to work on it. You'll have the Commissioner call me?\"  \"Right. So long. Call me if anything happens.\"  I had added the bit about calling the Commissioner because I wasn't sure but what Kleek would decide I was wrong in handling the case and let the story out \"accidentally.\" But I had to be careful not to make Shultz think I was trying to show my muscles. I called the Commissioner, got his O.K., and turned my attention back to my guest.  He had been listening with obvious interest. \"Another one of your zanies, eh?\"  \"One that went too far, Your Grace. We didn't get to him in time.\" I spent five or six minutes giving him the details of the Donahue case.  \"The same old story,\" he said when I had finished. \"If your pilot project here works out, maybe that kind of slaughter can be eliminated.\" Then he smiled. \"Do you know something? You're one of the few Americans I've ever met, outside your diplomats, who can address a person as 'Your Grace' and make it sound natural. Some people look at me as though they expected me to be all decked out in a ducal coronet and full ermines, ready for a Coronation. Your Commissioner, for instance. He seems quite a nice chap, but he also seems a bit overawed at a title. You seem perfectly relaxed.\"  I considered that for a moment. \"I imagine it's because he tends to look at you as a Duke who has taken up police work as a sort of gentlemanly hobby.\"  \"And you?\"  \"I guess I tend to think of you as a good cop who had the good fortune to be born the eldest son of a Duke.\"  His smile suddenly became very warm. \"Thank you,\" he said sincerely. \"Thank you very much.\"  There came the strained silence that sometimes follows when an honest compliment is passed between two men who have scarcely met. I broke it by pointing at the plaque on the front of my desk and giving him a broad grin. \"Or maybe it's just the kind of blood that flows in my veins.\"  He looked at the little plaque that said _Inspector Royal C. Royall_ and laughed pleasantly. \"I like to think that it's a little bit of both.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The intercom on my desk flashed, and the sergeant's voice said: \"Inspector, a couple of the boys just brought in a man named Manewiscz. A stolen car was run into a fire plug over on Fifth Avenue near 99th Street. A witness has positively identified Manewiscz as the driver who ran away before the squad car arrived.\"  \"Sidney Manewiscz?\" I"]]]
