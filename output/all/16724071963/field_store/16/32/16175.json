Further, everyone had heard that another shipload of Galactics had landed and were, at the moment, enjoying the sights of New York. A few of them knew that Pete was the bell-captain in one of the big midtown hotels.  McLeod listened while Pete expounded on the shame he had had to undergo to earn half a credit--a lousy five bucks.  McLeod did some estimating. Tourists--the word had acquired an even more pejorative sense than it had before, and now applied only to Galactics--bought nothing, but they tipped for services, unless the services weren't wanted or needed. Pete had given them information that they hadn't had before--where to find a particular place. All in all, the group of fifteen Galactics had given out five or six credits in such tips. Say half a credit apiece. There were, perhaps, a hundred Galactics in this shipload. That meant fifty credits. Hm-m-m.  They didn't need anyone to carry their bags; they didn't need anyone to register them in hotels; they didn't need personal service of that kind. All they wanted to do was look. But they wouldn't pay for looking. They had no interest in Broadway plays or the acts in the night-clubs--at least, not enough to induce them to pay to see them. This particular group had wanted to see a hotel. They had wandered through it, looking at everything and laughing fit to kill at the carpets on the floor and the electric lighting and such. But when the management had hinted that payment for such services as letting them look should be forthcoming, they had handed half a credit to someone and walked out. Then they had gone to the corner of Fifty-first and Madison and looked for nothing.  Fifty credits for a shipload. Three shiploads a year. Hell, give 'em the benefit of the doubt and say _ten_ shiploads a year. In a hundred years, they'd add another fifty thousand to Earth's resources.  McLeod grinned.  And waited.         *       *       *       *       *  They came for him, eventually, as McLeod had known they would.  But they came long before he had expected. He had given them six months at the least. They came for him at the end of the third month.  It was Jackson, of course. It would have to be Jackson. He walked into the cheap little room McLeod had rented, followed by his squad of men.  He tossed a peculiar envelope on the bed next to McLeod.  \"Letter came for you, humorist. Open it.\"  McLeod sat on the edge of the bed and read the letter. The envelope had already been opened, which surprised him none.  It looked very much like an ordinary business letter--except that whatever they used for paper was whiter and tougher than the paper he used.  He was reminded of the time he had seen a reproduction of a Thirteenth Century manuscript alongside the original. The copy had been set up in a specially-designed type and printed on fine paper. The original had been handwritten on vellum.  McLeod had the feeling that if he used a microscope on this letter the lines and edges would be just as precise and clear as they appeared to the naked eye, instead of the fuzziness that ordinary print would show.  The way you tell a synthetic ruby from a natural ruby is to look for flaws. The synthetic doesn't have any.  This letter was a Galactic imitation of a Terran business letter.  It said:       Dear Mac,       I am happy to report that your book, \"Interstellar Ark,\" is      a smash hit. It looks as though it is on its way to becoming      a best seller. As you already know by your royalty      statement, over a billion copies were sold the first year.      That indicates even better sales over the years to come as      the reputation of the book spreads. Naturally, our      advertising campaign will remain behind it all the way.      Congratulations.       Speaking of royalty checks, there seems to be some sort of      irregularity about yours. I am sorry, but according to      regulations the check must be validated in the presence of      your Galactic Resident before it can be cashed. Your      signature across the back of it doesn't mean anything to our      bankers.       Just go to your Galactic Resident, and he'll be happy to      take care of the matter for you. That's what he's there for.      The next check should come through very shortly.                                     All the best,                                              Clem.  [Illustration]  _Better and better_, McLeod thought. He hadn't expected to be able to do anything until his next royalty check arrived. But now--  He looked up at Jackson. \"All right. What's next?\"  \"Come with us. We're flying to Hawaii. Get your hat and coat.\"  McLeod obeyed silently. At the moment, there was nothing else he could do. As a matter of fact, there was nothing he wanted to do more.  It was no trouble at all for Professor McLeod to get an audience with the Galactic Resident, but when he was escorted in by Jackson and his squad, the whole group was halted inside the front door.  The Resident, a tall, lean being with a leathery, gray face that somehow managed to look crocodilian in spite of the fact that his head was definitely humanoid in shape, peered at them from beneath pronounced supraorbital ridges. \"Is this man under arrest?\" he asked in a gravelly baritone.  \"Er ... no,\" said Jackson. \"No. He is merely in protective custody.\"  \"He has not been convicted of any crime?\"  \"No sir,\" Jackson said. His voice sounded as though he were unsure of himself.  \"That is well,\" said the Resident. \"A convicted criminal cannot, of course, use the credits of society until he has become rehabilitated.\" He paused. \"But why protective custody?\"  \"There are those,\" said Jackson, choosing his words with care, \"who feel that Professor McLeod has brought disgrace upon the human race ... er ... the Terrestrial race. There is reason to believe that his life may be in danger.\"  McLeod smiled wryly. What Jackson said was true, but it was carefully calculated to mislead.  \"I see,\" said the Resident. \"It would appear to me that it would be simpler to inform the people that he has done no such thing; that, indeed, his work has conferred immense benefits upon your race. But that is your own affair. At any rate, he is in no danger here.\"  He didn't need to say anything else. Jackson knew the hint was an order and that he wouldn't get any farther with his squad.  McLeod spoke up. \"Subject to your permission, sir, I would like to have Mr. Jackson with me.\"  The Galactic Resident smiled. \"Of course, professor. Come in, both of you.\" He turned and led the way through the inner door.         *       *       *       *       *  Nobody bothered to search either of them, not even though they must know that Jackson was carrying a gun. McLeod was fairly certain that the gun would be useless to Jackson if he tried to assert his authority with it. If Clem had been able to render the U.B.I.'s eavesdropping apparatus inoperable, it was highly probable that the Galactic Resident would have some means of taking care of weapons.  \"There are only a few formalities to go through,\" the Resident said pleasantly, indicating chairs with a gesture. The room he had led them to didn't look much different from that which would be expected in any tastefully furnished apartment in New York or Honolulu.  McLeod and Jackson sat down in a couple of comfortable easy-chairs while the Resident went around a large desk and sat down in a swivel chair behind it. He smiled a little and looked at McLeod. \"Hm-m-m. Ah, yes. Very good.\" It was as though he had received information of some kind on an unknown subject through an unknown channel, McLeod thought. Evidently that was true, for his next words were: \"You are not under the influence of drugs nor hypnotic compulsion, I see. Excellent, professor. Is it your desire that this check be converted to cash?\" He made a small gesture. \"You have only to express it, you see. It would be difficult to explain it to you, but rest assured that such an expression of will--while you are sitting in that chair--is impressed upon the structure of the check itself and is the equivalent of a signature. Except, of course, that it is unforgeable.\"  \"May I ask a few questions first?\" McLeod said.  \"Certainly, professor. I am here to answer your questions.\"  \"This money--is it free and clear, or are there Galactic taxes to pay?\"  If the Galactic Resident had had eyebrows, it is likely that they would have lifted in surprise. \"My dear professor! Aside from the fact that we run our ... er ... government in an entirely different manner, we would consider it quite immoral to take what a man earns without giving services of an exact kind. I will charge you five credits for this validation, since I am rendering a service. The bank will take a full tenth of a percent in this case because of the inconvenience of shipping cash over that long distance. The rest is yours to do with as you see fit.\"  _Fifty-five credits out of fifty thousand_, McLeod thought. _Not bad at all._ Aloud, he asked: \"Could I, for instance, open a bank account or buy a ticket on a star-ship?\"  \"Why not? As I said, it is your money. You have earned it honestly; you may spend it honestly.\"  Jackson was staring at McLeod, but he said nothing.  \"Tell me, sir,\" McLeod said, \"how does the success of my book compare with the success of most books in the galaxy?\"  \"Quite favorably, I understand,\" said the Resident. \"The usual income from a successful book is about five thousand credits a year. Some run even less than that. I'm not too familiar with the publishing business, you understand, but that is my impression. You are, by Galactic standards, a very wealthy man, professor. Fifty thousand a year is by no means a median income.\"  \"Fifty thousand a _year_?\"  \"Yes. About that. I understand that in the publishing business one can depend on a life income that does not vary much from the initial period. If a book is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30816"],["title","A World (#4)"],["body","in one area of the galaxy it will be equally successful in others.\"  \"How long does it take to saturate the market?\" McLeod asked with a touch of awe.  \"Saturate the--? Oh. Oh, I see. Yes. Well, let's see. Most publishing houses can't handle the advertising and marketing on more than a thousand planets at once--the job becomes too unwieldy. That would indicate that you sold an average of a million copies per planet, which is unusual but not ... ah ... miraculous. That is why you can depend on future sales, you see; over a thousand planets the differences in planetary tastes averages out.  \"Now if your publishers continue to expand the publication at the rate of a thousand planets a year, your book should easily last for another century. They can't really expand that rapidly, of course, since the sales on the planets they have already covered will continue with diminishing success over the next several years. Actually, your publishers will continue to put a billion books a year on the market and expand to new planets at a rate that will balance the loss of sales on the planets where it has already run its course. Yes, professor, you will have a good income for life.\"  \"What about my heirs?\"  \"Heirs?\" The Galactic Resident blinked. \"I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.\"  \"My relatives. Anyone who will inherit my property after my death.\"  The Resident still looked puzzled. \"What about them?\"  \"How long can they go on collecting? When does the copyright run out?\"  The Galactic Resident's puzzlement vanished. \"Oh my dear professor! Surely you see that it is impossible to ... er ... inherit money one hasn't earned! The income stops with your death. Your children or your wife have done nothing to earn that money. Why should it continue to be paid out after the earner has died? If you wish to make provisions for such persons during your lifetime, that is your business, but the provisions must be made out of money you have already earned.\"  \"Who does get the income, then?\" McLeod asked.  The Galactic Resident looked thoughtful. \"Well, the best I can explain to you without going into arduous detail is to say that our ... er ... government gets it. 'Government' is not really the proper word in this context, since we have no government as you think of it. Let us merely say that such monies pass into a common exchequer from which ... er ... public servants like myself are paid.\"  McLeod had a vision of a British Crown Officer trying to explain to a New Guinea tribesman what he meant when he said that taxes go to the Crown. The tribesman would probably wonder why the Chief of the English Tribe kept cowrie shells under his hat.  \"I see. And if I am imprisoned for crime?\" he asked.  \"The payments are suspended until the ... er ... rehabilitation is complete. That is, until you are legally released.\"  \"Is there anything else that can stop the payments?\"  \"Not unless the publishing company fails--which is highly unlikely. Of course, a man under hypnotic compulsion or drugs is not considered legally responsible, so he cannot transact any legal business while he is in that state, but the checks are merely held for him until that impediment is removed.\"  \"I see.\" McLeod nodded.  He knew perfectly well that he no more understood the entire workings of the Galactic civilization than that New Guinea tribesman understood the civilization of Great Britain, but he also knew that he understood more of it than Jackson, for instance, did. McLeod had been able to foresee a little of what the Resident had said.  \"Would you do me the service, sir,\" McLeod said, \"of opening a bank account for me in some local bank?\"  \"Yes, of course. As Resident, I am empowered to transact business for you at your request. My fees are quite reasonable. All checks will have to go through me, of course, but ... hm-m-m ... I think in this case a twentieth of a per cent would be appropriate. You will be handling fairly large amounts. If that is your wish, I shall so arrange it.\"  \"Hey!\" Jackson found his tongue. \"The Earth Union Government has a claim on that! McLeod owes forty-nine thousand Galactic credits in income taxes!\"  If the Galactic Resident was shocked at the intimation that the Galactic \"government\" would take earned money from a man, the announcement that Earth's government did so was no surprise to him at all. \"If that is so, I am certain that Professor McLeod will behave as a law-abiding citizen. He can authorize a check for that amount, and it will be honored by his bank. We have no desire to interfere with local customs.\"  \"I am certain that I can come to an equitable arrangement with the Earth authorities,\" said McLeod, rising from his chair. \"Is there anything I have to sign or--\"  \"No, no. You have expressed your will. Thank you, Professor McLeod; it is a pleasure to do business with you.\"  \"Thank you. The pleasure is mutual. Come on, Jackson, we don't need to bother the Resident any more just now.\"  \"But--\"  \"Come on, I said! I want a few words with you!\" McLeod insisted.  Jackson sensed that there would be no point in arguing any further with the Resident, but he followed McLeod out into the bright Hawaiian sunshine with a dull glow of anger burning in his cheeks. Accompanied by the squad, they climbed into the car and left.         *       *       *       *       *  As soon as they were well away from the Residence, Jackson grabbed McLeod by the lapel of his jacket. \"All right, humorist! What was the idea of that? Are you trying to make things hard for yourself?\"  \"No, but _you_ are,\" McLeod said in a cold voice. \"Get your hands off me. I may get you fired anyway, just because you're a louse, but if you keep acting like this, I'll see that they toss you into solitary and toss the key away.\"  \"What are you talking about?\" But he released his hold.  \"Just think about it, Jackson. The Government can't get its hands on that money unless I permit it. As I said, we'll arrive at an equitable arrangement. And that will be a damn sight less than ninety-eight percent of my earnings, believe me.\"  \"If you refuse to pay, we'll--\" He stopped suddenly.  \"--Throw me in jail?\" McLeod shook his head. \"You can't get money while I'm in jail.\"  \"We'll wait,\" said Jackson firmly. \"After a little while in a cell, you'll listen to reason and will sign those checks.\"  \"You don't think very well, do you, Jackson? To 'sign' a check, I have to go to the Galactic Resident. As soon as you take me to him, I authorize a check to buy me a ticket for some nice planet where there are no income taxes.\"  Jackson opened his mouth and shut it again, frowning.  \"Think about it, Jackson,\" McLeod continued. \"Nobody can get that money from me without my consent. Now it so happens that I want to help Earth; I have a certain perverse fondness for the human race, even though it is inconceivably backward by Galactic standards. We have about as much chance of ever becoming of any importance on the Galactic scale as the Australian aborigine has of becoming important in world politics, but a few thousand years of evolution may bring out a few individuals who have the ability to do something. I'm not sure. But I'm damned if I'll let the boneheads run all over me while they take my money.  \"I happen to be, at the moment--and through sheer luck--Earth's only natural resource as far as the galaxy is concerned. Sure you can put me in jail. You can kill me if you want. But that won't give you the money. I am the goose that lays the golden eggs. But I'm not such a goose that I'm going to let you boot me in the tail while you steal the gold.  \"Earth has no other source of income. None. Tourists are few and far between and they spend almost nothing. As long as I am alive and in good health and out of prison, Earth will have a nice steady income of fifty thousand Galactic credits a year.  \"Earth, I said. Not the Government, except indirectly. I intend to see that my money isn't confiscated.\" He had a few other plans, too, but he saw no necessity of mentioning them to Jackson.  \"If I don't like the way the Government behaves, I'll simply shut off the source of supply. Understand, Jackson?\"  \"Um-m-m,\" said Jackson. He understood, he didn't like it, and he didn't know what to do about it.  \"One of the first things we're going to do is start a little 'information' flowing,\" McLeod said. \"I don't care to live on a planet where everybody hates my guts, so, as the Resident suggested, we're going to have to start a propaganda campaign to counteract the one that denounced me. For that, I'll want to talk to someone a little higher in the Government. You'd better take me to the head of the U.B.I. He'll know who I should speak to for that purpose.\"  Jackson still looked dazed, but it had evidently penetrated that McLeod had the upper hand. \"Wha ... er ... what did you say, sir?\" he asked, partially coming out of his daze.  McLeod sighed.  \"Take me to your leader,\" he said patiently.         *       *       *       *       *"]]]
