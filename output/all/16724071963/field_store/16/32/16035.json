The Cubans were at a distance of two hundred and fifty yards; the \"point\" of five picked men under Sergeant Byrne and duty-Sergeant Fish followed them at a distance of a hundred yards, and then came Capron's troop of sixty men strung out in single file.  No flankers were placed for the reason that the dense undergrowth and the tangle of vines that stretched from the branches of the trees to the bushes below made it a physical impossibility for man or beast to move forward except along the single trail.  Colonel Wood rode at the head of the column, followed by two regular army officers who were members of General Wheeler's staff, a Cuban officer, and Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt.  They rode slowly in consideration of the troopers on foot, who under a cruelly hot sun carried heavy burdens. To those who did not have to walk, it was not unlike a hunting excursion in our West; the scenery was beautiful and the view down the valley one of luxuriant peace.  Roosevelt had never been in the tropics and Captain McCormick and I were talking back at him over our shoulders and at each other, pointing out unfamiliar trees and birds.  Roosevelt thought it looked like a good deer country, as it once was; it reminded McCormick of Southern California; it looked to me like the trails in Central America. We advanced, talking in that fashion and in high spirits, and congratulating ourselves in being shut of the transport and on breathing fine mountain air again, and on the fact that we were on horseback.  We agreed it was impossible to appreciate that we were really at war--that we were in the enemy's country.  We had been riding in this pleasant fashion for an hour and a half with brief halts for rest, when Wood stopped the head of the column, and rode down the trail to meet Capron, who was coming back.  Wood returned immediately, leading his horse, and said to Roosevelt:  \"Pass the word back to keep silence in the ranks.\"  The place at which we had halted was where the trail narrowed, and proceeded sharply downward.  There was on one side of it a stout barbed-wire fence of five strands.  By some fortunate accident this fence had been cut just where the head of the column halted.  On the left of the trail it shut off fields of high grass blocked at every fifty yards with great barricades of undergrowth and tangled trees and chapparal.  On the other side of the trail there was not a foot of free ground; the bushes seemed absolutely impenetrable, as indeed they were later found to be.  When we halted, the men sat down beside the trail and chewed the long blades of grass, or fanned the air with their hats.  They had no knowledge of the situation such as their leaders possessed, and their only emotion was one of satisfaction at the chance the halt gave them to rest and to shift their packs.  Wood again walked down the trail with Capron and disappeared, and one of the officers informed us that the scouts had seen the outposts of the enemy.  It did not seem reasonable that the Spaniards, who had failed to attack us when we landed at Baiquiri, would oppose us until they could do so in force, so, personally, I doubted that there were any Spaniards nearer than Santiago. But we tied our horses to the wire fence, and Capron's troop knelt with carbines at the \"Ready,\" peering into the bushes.  We must have waited there, while Wood reconnoitred, for over ten minutes.  Then he returned, and began deploying his troops out at either side of the trail.  Capron he sent on down the trail itself.  G Troop was ordered to beat into the bushes on the right, and K and A were sent over the ridge on which we stood down into the hollow to connect with General Young's column on the opposite side of the valley.  F and E Troops were deployed in skirmish-line on the other side of the wire fence.  Wood had discovered the enemy a few hundred yards from where he expected to find him, and so far from being \"surprised,\" he had time, as I have just described, to get five of his troops into position before a shot was fired.  The firing, when it came, started suddenly on our right.  It sounded so close that--still believing we were acting on a false alarm, and that there were no Spaniards ahead of us--I guessed it was Capron's men firing at random to disclose the enemy's position.  I ran after G Troop under Captain Llewellyn, and found them breaking their way through the bushes in the direction from which the volleys came.  It was like forcing the walls of a maze.  If each trooper had not kept in touch with the man on either hand he would have been lost in the thicket.  At one moment the underbrush seemed swarming with our men, and the next, except that you heard the twigs breaking, and heavy breathing or a crash as a vine pulled some one down, there was not a sign of a human being anywhere.  In a few minutes we broke through into a little open place in front of a dark curtain of vines, and the men fell on one knee and began returning the fire that came from it.  The enemy's fire was exceedingly heavy, and his aim was excellent.  We saw nothing of the Spaniards, except a few on the ridge across the valley.  I happened to be the only one present with field glasses, and when I discovered this force on the ridge, and had made sure, by the cockades in their sombreros, that they were Spaniards and not Cubans, I showed them to Roosevelt.  He calculated they were five hundred yards from us, and ordered the men to fire on them at that range.  Through the two hours of fighting that followed, although men were falling all around us, the Spaniards on the ridge were the only ones that many of us saw. But the fire against us was not more than eighty yards away, and so hot that our men could only lie flat in the grass and return it in that position.  It was at this moment that our men believed they were being attacked by Capron's troop, which they imagined must have swung to the right, and having lost its bearings and hearing them advancing through the underbrush, had mistaken them for the enemy.  They accordingly ceased firing and began shouting in order to warn Capron that he was shooting at his friends.  This is the foundation for the statement that the Rough Riders had fired on each other, which they did not do then or at any other time.  Later we examined the relative position of the trail which Capron held, and the position of G Troop, and they were at right angles to one another.  Capron could not possibly have fired into us at any time, unless he had turned directly around in his tracks and aimed up the very trail he had just descended.  Advancing, he could no more have hit us than he could have seen us out of the back of his head.  When we found many hundred spent cartridges of the Spaniards a hundred yards in front of G Troop's position, the question as to who had fired on us was answered.  It was an exceedingly hot corner.  The whole troop was gathered in the little open place blocked by the network of grape-vines and tangled bushes before it.  They could not see twenty feet on three sides of them, but on the right hand lay the valley, and across it came the sound of Young's brigade, who were apparently heavily engaged.  The enemy's fire was so close that the men could not hear the word of command, and Captain Llewellyn and Lieutenant Greenway, unable to get their attention, ran among them, batting them with their sombreros to make them cease firing. Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt ran up just then, bringing with him Lieutenant Woodbury Kane and ten troopers from K Troop.  Roosevelt lay down in the grass beside Llewellyn and consulted with him eagerly.  Kane was smiling with the charming content of a perfectly happy man.  When Captain Llewellyn told him his men were not needed, and to rejoin his troop, he led his detail over the edge of the hill on which we lay.  As he disappeared below the crest he did not stoop to avoid the bullets, but walked erect, still smiling.  Roosevelt pointed out that it was impossible to advance farther on account of the network of wild grape-vines that masked the Spaniards from us, and that we must cross the trail and make to the left.  The shouts the men had raised to warn Capron had established our position to the enemy, and the firing was now fearfully accurate.  Sergeant Russell, who in his day had been a colonel on a governor's staff, was killed, and the other sergeant was shot through the wrist.  In the space of three minutes nine men were lying on their backs helpless.  Before we got away, every third man was killed, or wounded.  We drew off slowly to the left, dragging the wounded with us. Owing to the low aim of the enemy, we were forced to move on our knees and crawl.  Even then men were hit.  One man near me was shot through the head.  Returning later to locate the body and identify him, I found that the buzzards had torn off his lips and his eyes.  This mutilation by these hideous birds was, without doubt, what Admiral Sampson mistook for the work of the Spaniards, when the bodies of the marines at Guantanamo were found disfigured.  K Troop meantime had deployed into the valley under the fire from the enemy on the ridge.  It had been ordered to establish communication with General Young's column, and while advancing and firing on the ridge, Captain Jenkins sent the guidon bearer back to climb the hill and wave his red and white banner where Young's men could see it.  The guidon bearer had once run for Congress on the gold ticket in Arizona, and, as some one said, was naturally the man who should have been selected for a forlorn hope.  His flag brought him instantly under a heavy fire, but he continued waving it until the Tenth Cavalry on the other side of the valley answered, and the two columns were connected by a skirmish-line composed of K Troop and A, under Captain \"Bucky\" O'Neill.  G Troop meanwhile had hurried over to the left, and passing through the opening in the wire fence had spread out into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],["title","Notes of a War Correspondent (#6)"],["body","order.  It followed down after Captain Luna's troop and D and E Troops, which were well already in advance.  Roosevelt ran forward and took command of the extreme left of this line.  Wood was walking up and down along it, leading his horse, which he thought might be of use in case he had to move quickly to alter his original formation.  His plan, at present, was to spread out his men so that they would join Young on the right, and on the left swing around until they flanked the enemy.  K and A Troops had already succeeded in joining hands with Young's column across the valley, and as they were capable of taking care of themselves, Wood was bending his efforts to keep his remaining four companies in a straight line and revolving them around the enemy's \"end.\"  It was in no way an easy thing to do.  The men were at times wholly hidden from each other, and from him; probably at no one time did he see more than two of his troops together.  It was only by the firing that he could tell where his men lay, and that they were always advancing.  The advances were made in quick, desperate rushes--sometimes the ground gained was no more than a man covers in sliding for a base.  At other times half a troop would rise and race forward and then burrow deep in the hot grass and fire.  On this side of the line there was an occasional glimpse of the enemy.  But for a great part of the time the men shot at the places from where the enemy's fire seemed to come, aiming low and answering in steady volleys.  The fire discipline was excellent.  The prophets of evil of the Tampa Bay Hotel had foretold that the cowboys would shoot as they chose, and, in the field, would act independently of their officers.  As it turned out, the cowboys were the very men who waited most patiently for the officers to give the word of command.  At all times the movement was without rest, breathless and fierce, like a cane-rush, or a street fight.  After the first three minutes every man had stripped as though for a wrestling match, throwing off all his impedimenta but his cartridge-belt and canteen.  Even then the sun handicapped their strength cruelly.  The enemy was hidden in the shade of the jungle, while they, for every thicket they gained, had to fight in the open, crawling through grass which was as hot as a steam bath, and with their flesh and clothing torn by thorns and the sword-like blade of the Spanish \"bayonet.\"  The glare of the sun was full in their eyes and as fierce as a lime-light.  When G Troop passed on across the trail to the left I stopped at the place where the column had first halted--it had been converted into a dressing station and the wounded of G Troop were left there in the care of the hospital stewards.  A tall, gaunt young man with a cross on his arm was just coming back up the trail.  His head was bent, and by some surgeon's trick he was carrying a wounded man much heavier than himself across his shoulders.  As I stepped out of the trail he raised his head, and smiled and nodded, and left me wondering where I had seen him before, smiling in the same cheery, confident way and moving in that same position.  I knew it could not have been under the same conditions, and yet he was certainly associated with another time of excitement and rush and heat.  Then I remembered him.  As now he had been covered with blood and dirt and perspiration, but then he wore a canvas jacket and the man he carried on his shoulders was trying to hold him back from a white-washed line.  And I recognized the young doctor, with the blood bathing his breeches, as \"Bob\" Church, of Princeton.  That was only one of four badly wounded men he carried that day on his shoulders over a half-mile of trail that stretched from the firing-line back to the dressing station and under an unceasing fire. {3}  As the senior surgeon was absent he had chief responsibility that day for all the wounded, and that so few of them died is greatly due to this young man who went down into the firing-line and pulled them from it, and bore them out of danger.  The comic paragraphers who wrote of the members of the Knickerbocker Club and the college swells of the Rough Riders and of their imaginary valets and golf clubs, should, in decency, since the fight at Guasimas apologize.  For the same spirit that once sent these men down a white-washed field against their opponents' rush line was the spirit that sent Church, Channing, Devereux, Ronalds, Wrenn, Cash, Bull, Lamed, Goodrich, Greenway, Dudley Dean, and a dozen others through the high hot grass at Guasimas, not shouting, as their friends the cowboys did, but each with his mouth tightly shut, with his eyes on the ball, and moving in obedience to the captain's signals.  Judging from the sound, our firing-line now seemed to be half a mile in advance of the place where the head of the column had first halted.  This showed that the Spaniards had been driven back at least three hundred yards from their original position.  It was impossible to see any of our men in the field, so I ran down the trail with the idea that it would lead me back to the troop I had left when I had stopped at the dressing station.  The walk down that trail presented one of the most grewsome pictures of the war.  It narrowed as it descended; it was for that reason the enemy had selected that part of it for the attack, and the vines and bushes interlaced so closely above it that the sun could not come through.  The rocks on either side were spattered with blood and the rank grass was matted with it.  Blanket rolls, haversacks, carbines, and canteens had been abandoned all along its length.  It looked as though a retreating army had fled along it, rather than that one troop had fought its way through it to the front.  Except for the clatter of the land-crabs, those hideous orchid-colored monsters that haunt the places of the dead, and the whistling of the bullets in the trees, the place was as silent as a grave.  For the wounded lying along its length were as still as the dead beside them.  The noise of the loose stones rolling under my feet brought a hospital steward out of the brush, and he called after me:  \"Lieutenant Thomas is badly wounded in here, and we can't move him.  We want to carry him out of the sun some place, where there is shade and a breeze.\"  Thomas was the first lieutenant of Capron's troop.  He is a young man, large and powerfully built.  He was shot through the leg just below the trunk, and I found him lying on a blanket half naked and covered with blood, and with his leg bound in tourniquets made of twigs and pocket-handkerchiefs.  It gave one a thrill of awe and wonder to see how these cowboy surgeons, with a stick that one would use to light a pipe and with the gaudy 'kerchiefs they had taken from their necks, were holding death at bay.  The young officer was in great pain and tossing and raving wildly.  When we gathered up the corners of his blanket and lifted him, he tried to sit upright, and cried out, \"You're taking me to the front, aren't you?  You said you would.  They've killed my captain--do you understand?  They've killed Captain Capron.  The --- Mexicans!  They've killed my captain.\"  The troopers assured him they were carrying him to the firing-line, but he was not satisfied.  We stumbled over the stones and vines, bumping his wounded body against the ground and leaving a black streak in the grass behind us, but it seemed to hurt us more than it did him, for he sat up again clutching at us imploringly with his bloody hands.  \"For God's sake, take me to the front,\" he begged.  \"Do you hear?  I order you; damn you, I order--We must give them hell; do you hear? we must give them hell.  They've killed Capron.  They've killed my captain.\"  The loss of blood at last mercifully silenced him, and when we had reached the trail he had fainted and I left them kneeling around him, their grave boyish faces filled with sympathy and concern.  Only fifty feet from him and farther down the trail I passed his captain, with his body propped against Church's knee and with his head fallen on the surgeon's shoulder.  Capron was always a handsome, soldierly looking man--some said that he was the most soldierly looking of any of the young officers in the army--and as I saw him then death had given him a great dignity and nobleness.  He was only twenty-eight years old, the age when life has just begun, but he rested his head on the surgeon's shoulder like a man who knew he was already through with it and that, though they might peck and mend at the body, he had received his final orders.  His breast and shoulders were bare, and as the surgeon cut the tunic from him the sight of his great chest and the skin, as white as a girl's, and the black open wound against it made the yellow stripes and the brass insignia on the tunic, strangely mean and tawdry.  Fifty yards farther on, around a turn in the trail, behind a rock, a boy was lying with a bullet wound between his eyes.  His chest was heaving with short, hoarse noises which I guessed were due to some muscular action entirely, and that he was virtually dead.  I lifted him and gave him some water, but it would not pass through his fixed teeth.  In the pocket of his blouse was a New Testament with the name Fielder Dawson, Mo., scribbled in it in pencil.  While I was writing it down for identification, a boy as young as himself came from behind me down the trail.  \"It is no use,\" he said; \"the surgeon has seen him; he says he is just the same as dead.  He is my bunkie; we only met two weeks ago at San Antonio; but he and me had got to be such good friends--But there's nothing I can do now.\"  He threw himself down on the rock beside his bunkie, who was still breathing with that hoarse inhuman rattle, and I left them, the one who had been spared looking down helplessly with the tears creeping across his cheeks.  The firing was quite close now, and the trail was no longer filled with blanket rolls and"]]]
