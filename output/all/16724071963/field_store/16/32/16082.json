They hadn't been long in the woods when Spot suddenly stood still and pointed ahead of him with his nose.  Try as he would, Johnnie couldn't see what Spot was pointing at. So he took a few steps forward until he came abreast of the old dog. Then all at once there was a rumbling _whir_ that sounded to Johnnie Green almost as loud as thunder. A brownish streak flashed from the ground just ahead of him.  He knew that it was a grouse rising. And he fired.  Johnnie Green missed the bird. It had given him such a start that he was still shaking long afterward. He was disappointed, but not less downcast than old Spot.  \"Never mind, old boy!\" Johnnie said. \"We'll have better luck next time!\"  But they didn't. Twice more that same thing happened. And after the third miss old Sport turned tail and ran away.  \"I don't see what's the matter with that boy,\" he muttered. \"I've pointed three birds for him. And he has let every one of them get away.... There's no fun in that kind of shooting.\"  After that Johnnie couldn't get Spot to go into the woods with him. Whenever Johnnie appeared in the yard with his gun, Spot promptly vanished.  So Johnnie spent a good deal of time shooting at old tin cans which he set on a fence post or a stone wall. And it wasn't long before he found he could hit them at every shot.  At last he came home from the woods one day with a grouse. When he showed it to Spot the old dog actually began teasing him to go hunting.  The next day they set out together for the woods. And Johnnie knocked down the very first grouse that Spot found for him.  Spot brought the bird to Johnnie and laid it proudly at his feet.  \"Did Johnnie Green ever give you any of the birds that you find for him?\" Miss Kitty Cat inquired when Spot was boasting a bit about the sport he and Johnnie had in the woods. \"No!\" she said, answering her own question. \"You're silly to hunt for him. I prefer to do my hunting alone. Then nobody can take the game away from me.\"  Old dog Spot walked away from her, to the barn.  \"Miss Kitty Cat doesn't know what real hunting is,\" he told the old horse Ebenezer. \"She creeps up on small birds after dark, when they are asleep.\"  \"And you creep up on big birds in the daytime,\" said old Ebenezer, \"so Johnnie Green can shoot them.\"  Being a sporting dog, Spot couldn't see anything queer in that remark.  \"Certainly!\" he said.     XIV  MISSING HIS MASTER   Johnnie Green went visiting one summer, after haying was done. Much to old dog Spot's disgust, Johnnie did not take him on this journey. But it was not Spot's fault that he was left at home. Had he not been shut up in the harness room in the barn when Johnnie drove the old horse Ebenezer out of the yard Spot would have followed beneath the buggy.  It was hours before Farmer Green set Spot free. When Farmer Green at last flung open the door of the harness room Spot rushed out and dashed into the road. To his sorrow he couldn't smell a trace of Ebenezer's track. So many other horses had passed by the house since morning that Spot couldn't even tell which way Ebenezer had gone.  In desperation Spot ran up the road a little way. Then he turned around and ran down the hill as far as the gristmill.  By the time he reached the mill pond Spot gave up the chase. He knew it was hopeless.  And seeing several of Johnnie Green's friends swimming in the pond, he joined them.  The boys welcomed him with shouts. And the water was just as cool as ever. But somehow Spot didn't find swimming as pleasant as he always had before. He missed Johnnie Green. There wasn't another boy there that gave Spot the same thrill by whistling to him, or patting him, or romping with him that Johnnie Green gave him.  After a while Spot shook himself and trotted back to Farmer Green's place. He felt homesick. But when he reached the house somehow he felt worse than ever. It was terribly quiet. It was just like a Sunday morning, when everybody was at church. Farmer Green and the hired man were working in the fields. Mrs. Green was busy in the house--too busy to stop and talk with old Spot.  \"It's frightfully dull here,\" Spot groaned. \"I wish somebody would shout.\" And just to break the silence he lifted up his nose and tried to bark.  It was far from a cheerful noise that he made, for he only succeeded in giving a mournful howl. And that sad sound made Spot gloomier than ever.  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's nothing else to do, so I'll go and dig up that bone that I buried in the orchard last week.\"  He found the bone where he had hidden it. Yet it did not look half as inviting as it had when he covered it with dirt a few days before. He stared at it dully. Then he put it back in its hole and pawed the dirt over it again.  He found no pleasure in anything. No longer was there any fun in chasing woodchucks. The cows might have stayed in the cornfield all day long and Spot wouldn't have bothered them. He didn't even get any sport out of teasing Miss Kitty Cat.  Strangest of all, he couldn't find any comfort in lying down for a quiet nap. The moment he tried to pass the time away in that fashion he began to think about Johnnie Green and what a nice boy he was. And then he would get up and walk around and around the house. Hour after hour Spot spent in that fashion.  It wasn't many days before he had worn a path in the grass all the way around the farmhouse. When Farmer Green noticed it he didn't scold Spot. He patted his head and said, \"Cheer up, old boy! Johnnie'll be back one of these days.\"  Old dog Spot wagged his tail feebly. But it was hard to wait.  \"It wouldn't be so bad,\" he said to himself, \"if there was only somebody to play with. If there was a puppy here on the farm I'd have some one that would be ready to romp whenever I felt like it. And then Johnnie could go away visiting every summer and I wouldn't miss him half as much.\"  Spot forgot that a puppy wouldn't stay a puppy forever.     XV  A BASKETFUL OF FUN   Johnnie Green came home from his visit at last. The moment Spot heard the old horse Ebenezer come jogging up the road he tore out of the yard and ran, barking, to meet the travellers. He frisked about the buggy, he sprang up and touched Ebenezer's nose with his own, he tried to jump into the buggy beside Johnnie Green.  Spot made such a racket that everybody in the farmhouse knew that Johnnie had returned. The family were just sitting down for dinner. And they all hurried out into the yard. For old dog Spot was not the only one that had missed Johnnie while he was away on his visit.  Johnnie leaped out of the buggy, to be met by a smother of pawings and nosings from old Spot.  \"Now, Spot--you behave!\" said Johnnie Green. \"I'm hungry and I want to get my dinner.\"  Spot paid not the slightest heed to his young master's objections. \"You'll never know how I've missed you,\" he barked. \"And if I want to romp with you for a few minutes, I'm going to; and nobody can stop me.\"  After a little Spot grew a bit calmer. He let Johnnie Green turn to the buggy and lift out a covered basket.  Spot promptly stuck his nose against it. Then he drew back quickly.  \"Wow!\" he exclaimed. \"This basket smells _doggy!_\"  Spot followed Johnnie into the house. And in the woodshed Johnnie opened the basket and brought out of it a soft, silky, blinking--puppy!  \"Wow!\" said Spot again. \"It was no wonder that I noticed a doggy smell about that basket.\" And then he said, \"G-r-r-r!\"  Yes! Spot actually growled at the little newcomer. For the moment he forgot that he had been wishing, for days, that there was a puppy about the place. To tell the truth, he couldn't help feeling the least bit jealous of Johnnie Green's new pet.  In a day or two, however, old Spot liked the puppy as much as anybody else did. He proved to be a playful little chap. And the older he grew the more fun-loving he became.  [Illustration: Sometimes the Puppy Would Bite Spot's Tail.  (_Page 73_)]  There were no more dull days for old dog Spot. When school opened in the fall he no longer moped around the farmhouse, waiting for Johnnie to come home. The puppy kept him too busy to notice Johnnie's absence.  At first Spot found it very pleasant to roll on the ground with his small friend, and pretend to bite him, and upset him off his somewhat wobbly legs. But as time passed Spot began to weary of never-ending play. There were moments when Spot wanted to lie still and doze. But as soon as he had settled himself for a nap the puppy was sure to come bouncing up and sprawl all over him. He would seize one of Spot's long ears between his teeth and give it a bit of a nip. Sometimes he would even pull Spot's tail.  Of course nobody can sleep under such interruptions. Spot learned that when he wanted to rest he had to hide in some place where the puppy couldn't follow him. And as the puppy became bigger Spot found it harder to slip away from him. The youngster would trail Spot into the barn and even as far as the hay-stack in the meadow.  Once the old dog had _wished_ for a puppy. Now, however, he could scarcely wait for this lively youngster to grow into a dog.  A whole year passed before Spot had any peace again. And when another summer had come, and Johnnie Green went visiting again, Spot muttered with a deep groan:  \"I hope Johnnie will have sense enough not to bring another puppy with him when he comes home.\"     XVI  MRS. WOODCHUCK RUNS   Mrs. Woodchuck was on her way home, waddling across the pasture. She had been making a call on Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the herb doctor, who lived under the hill. They had talked over all the news in the neighborhood. And Mrs. Woodchuck had her mind on some gossip that Aunt Polly had told her. Otherwise she might have noticed sooner that old dog Spot had spied her.  If he hadn't spoken he would certainly have caught her that time. For Mrs. Woodchuck was fat and couldn't run as fast as she used to. But when Spot's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],["title","The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#5)"],["body","nose caught a scent that told him there was one of the Woodchuck family not far away he just had to give one long-drawn howl.  When Mrs. Woodchuck heard that dreadful sound she scurried for home. She dropped her knitting and the apple that Aunt Polly had given her. And she only managed to pop down the hole that was her front door with Spot scarcely a length behind her.  \"Just missed her!\" the old dog yelped. \"How unlucky!\"  \"Just escaped!\" Mrs. Woodchuck gasped. \"How fortunate!\"  She knew that she was safe. So she took her own time in crawling through the long hall that led to her one-room dwelling.  \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed as she entered her underground home and saw that it was empty. \"Mr. Woodchuck and Billy are away. I must hurry and warn them that old dog Spot is prowling about the pasture.\"  Meanwhile Spot lingered at Mrs. Woodchuck's front door. He scratched in the dirt that was thrown up before it. He sniffed at the tracks that the Woodchuck family had made all about.  \"I know now where that fat Mrs. Woodchuck lives,\" he growled. \"I'll keep an eye on this hole. Some day I may be able to get between her and her home. And then--\"  He did not finish what he was saying, but licked his lips as if he had just enjoyed a hearty meal.  For a long time Spot waited there. He could hardly have expected Mrs. Woodchuck to come out and invite him to enter her house. The most that she was likely to do would be to creep not quite to the upper end of her front hall and peer out to see what she could through the small round opening.  \"That dame must have a family,\" Spot thought. \"I'd like to meet them--whether there's one youngster or seven. The more the merrier for me.\"  If Spot had happened to look around just then he would have had his wish granted. Or if the wind had been blowing the other way he could have told, without looking around, that Mrs. Woodchuck's son Billy was gazing at him, with popeyes, from behind a near-by hummock. He had meandered homewards, pausing here and there to nip off a clover head or tear at a plantain leaf, little dreaming that old dog Spot was right in his door-yard.  When he caught sight of the unwelcome caller Billy sat up and took one good, long look at him.  Then Mrs Woodchuck's son turned and ran down the hillside as fast as his short legs would carry him. He didn't stop until he had reached the fence between the pasture and the meadow. Dashing in among the brakes that grew deep along the fence he cowered under the cover that they gave him.  All at once he felt quite ashamed of himself.  \"I almost forgot the rule!\" he chattered. \"The rule says, 'When there's a Dog about, warn everybody!'\"     XVII  THE DANGER SIGNAL   Billy Woodchuck remembered, after he had fled from old dog Spot, that he ought to warn his family and his friends. So he sat up, stuck his head out of the tangle of brakes where he had hidden, and gave the danger signal, a sharp whistle.  \"Dear me!\" he said. \"I fear Father and Mother won't hear that. And if they go home they'll run upon old dog Spot. And then there's no knowing what might happen.\"  He knew that his mother had gone to see Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who lived under the hill. And he knew that his father, with a few cronies, was enjoying a feast in Farmer Green's clover patch.  \"I'll hurry over to Aunt Polly's first,\" he decided, \"and tell Mother to beware the Dog.\"  So Billy Woodchuck scampered off toward the hill where Aunt Polly Woodchuck made her home. When he knocked at Aunt Polly's door and learned that Mrs. Woodchuck had left some time before Billy was much upset.  \"Perhaps she went to the clover patch,\" Aunt Polly suggested. \"You know your father sometimes forgets to go home unless somebody goes for him.\"  Well, Billy started off again. And he hadn't gone far when he heard a sound that made him sit up and listen. Like all his family, he had very sharp ears. And now, after cocking his head on one side for a few moments, he knew that what he heard was old dog Spot grumbling and growling.  \"My goodness!\" Billy Woodchuck gasped. \"He's left our house. And if I don't look out he'll catch me.\"  At almost the same instant old Spot paused and sniffed the air.  \"Ha!\" he cried. \"I smell a Woodchuck. And if I'm not mistaken it's a different Woodchuck from the one I chased a little while ago.\"  Billy Woodchuck and Spot began to run at the same time. Billy headed for home; and Spot headed for him.  Again old dog Spot was just a bit too late. Billy Woodchuck darted into the hole in the hillside not a second too soon. He could hear Spot panting close behind him.  \"Such luck!\" Spot growled. \"There's another that's got away from me. There's the second one that I've run into that hole. I suppose they're chuckling inside their house and making all manner of fun of me.\"  The old dog was mistaken. Billy Woodchuck was not chuckling. He found nobody at home. It was plain that his parents were still abroad.  \"They may be coming from the clover patch now,\" he groaned. And if they are, they're sure to stumble upon that terrible creature at the door. I must warn them before it's too late.\"  While Spot was still snorting and snuffling around the Woodchuck family's front door, Billy Woodchuck crept out of the back door and started for the clover patch. Little did he know that his mother had already stolen out the same way, to warn him and his father.  When unwelcome callers come, a back door is sometimes a convenient thing to have about a house.     XVIII  A CROWDED HOUSE   Old dog Spot never once guessed that there was a back door to the Woodchuck family's home in the pasture. He had chased Mrs. Woodchuck into her house. He had likewise hunted her son Billy into the same front door through which his mother had scrambled only a short time before.  \"There must be more of these fat folks about the pasture,\" Spot thought. \"I'll range around a bit and see if I can't surprise another.\"  So he began running about the pasture in big circles. And he was lucky enough, before long, to come upon Mr. Woodchuck himself, who had dined so heartily on clover heads that he had decided to go to his chamber and take a nap.  Spot was unlucky enough to lose him. Mr. Woodchuck had been feeling quite sleepy. But when he suddenly found himself pursued by a dog he was wide awake in an instant and running like a youngster.  He reached his home just in time.  \"Well, that makes the third one that's inside the house,\" Spot muttered, shortly afterward, as he paused to get his breath.  Little did he know how mistaken he was. There wasn't even one of the Woodchuck family at home; for Mr. Woodchuck had at once hurried out the back way, because he wanted to find his wife and his son and tell them to keep away from old dog Spot.  Soon Spot took a few more turns around the pasture. And this time he ran across Mrs. Woodchuck again.  He had no sooner run her to earth once more than he found Billy for the second time.  \"This is a twin brother of the fellow I chased home once before,\" Spot panted, little dreaming that Billy Woodchuck had come back into the daylight.  \"This twin is just as spry as the other one was,\" Spot gasped as he reached for Billy right at his door--and missed him.  After that the old dog chased Mr. Woodchuck, then his wife, and next their son Billy Woodchuck. And he didn't succeed in catching any one of the three. Each of them beat him in the race to the Woodchuck family's front door.  Old Spot began to feel quite upset.  \"I don't see what the matter with me to-day,\" he puzzled. \"I hope I'm not getting so old that I'm _weeble_.\" (By that he meant _weak_ and _feeble_.)  \"This last one makes eight that I've followed all the way to this door,\" Spot growled. \"There can't be many more left in the pasture. I'm going to lie down behind this hummock and wait till they come out.\"  So he hid a little way off and watched closely.  He had been there a long time when Mr. Crow at last flew low over the pasture and alighted in a tree near-by.  \"What are you waiting for?\" he asked Spot.  \"Woodchucks!\" said Spot. \"This burrow is full of them.\"  \"Are you sure?\" Mr. Crow inquired.  \"I chased eight of them home,\" Spot explained.  \"That's odd,\" said Mr. Crow. \"There have been only three living here lately. And they don't live here any more.\"  \"They don't!\" Spot cried.  \"No!\" Mr. Crow told him. \"They moved this afternoon.\"  Old dog Spot sprang to his feet.  \"Where did they go?\" he demanded.  \"Ah!\" Mr. Crow croaked. \"That's telling.\" And he would say no more.  Then Spot went back to the farmyard.  Meanwhile the Woodchuck family were working hard, digging a new home for themselves at the other end of the pasture. They had all met at last on the edge of the clover patch. And Mr. Woodchuck had declared that they must move at once, because it wasn't safe to live in their old house any longer. He said that old dog Spot would be sure to keep an eye on it for some time.  They soon found a place that suited them all very well.  \"We'll live here,\" said Mr. Woodchuck to his wife and their son Billy. \"You two can take turns digging while I sit up and watch for old dog Spot. After all the running I did to-day it wouldn't be safe for me to do any digging.\"  That was Mr. Woodchuck's plan. And they followed it.     XIX  OFF FOR THE CIRCUS   Great circus posters had covered one side of Farmer Green's barn for weeks. Ever since some men came and pasted them on the barn Johnnie Green had studied them carefully. He had practiced bareback riding on his pony, Twinkleheels. He had tried a high dive into the mill pond from the top of the dam. And much to old dog Spot's disgust Johnnie had tried to make him jump through a hoop covered with paper.  Spot had refused flatly to do anything of the kind. If he had known that his young master had half a notion to teach him to jump through a hoop of fire Spot would have run away--at least until circus time had come and gone.  \"What puts all these queer ideas into Johnnie's head?\" the old dog asked his "]]]
