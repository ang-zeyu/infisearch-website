The silky webs flashed into nothing as the flames hit them, but they wouldn't support the fire, and other webs streamed down behind the two. They had to burn another mattress to get back with a few cases of food.  Then we dug a well under the floor of our tent. Hit water within a few feet. But when we cut through the screen floor it cost us sentry duty. We had to have one person awake all night long to stamp on the spiders that slipped in around the edge of the well.  Through all of this Cleveland has been out on his feet. He has just stood and stared out through the screen all day. We had to force him to eat. He didn't snap out of it until this morning.  Sparks couldn't stand our radio silence any longer, so he talked Sellers into helping him make a dash for the gas drums on the beach. They set fire to two mattresses and disappeared into the tunnel of burned webs that tangled and caved in behind them.  When they were gone, Cleveland suddenly came out of his trance and put a hand on my shoulder. I thought for a moment he was going to jump me, but his eyes were calm. He said, \"Well, Fred, are you convinced now that we've been attacked?\"  I said, \"It makes no sense to me at all. Why these little flies?\"  Cleve said, \"They couldn't have done better so easily. They studied our ecology well. They saw that our greatest potential enemy was the insect population, and the most vicious part of it was the spider. _Tabanidae viridis_ was not sent just to plague us with horsefly bites. Tabby was sent to multiply and feed the arachnids. There are durable species in all climates. And if our botanist were still alive he could explain in detail how long our plant life can last under this spider infestation.  \"Look for yourself,\" he said pointing outside. \"Not only are the regular pollenizing insects doomed, but the density of those webs will choke out even wind pollinated grains.\"  He stared down our shallow well hole and stamped on a small, black, flat spider that had slithered under the screening. \"I suppose you realize the spiders got the others. Down here in the tropics the big varieties could do it by working together. Sellers and Sparks won't return. Sounds like they got through all right, but they'll be bitten so badly they won't try to get back.\"  And even as he spoke we heard one of the aircraft engines start up. The sound was muffled as under a bed quilt.  Cleve said, \"I don't blame them. I'd rather die in the sun, too. The beach should be fairly clear of webs. We've got one mattress left. What do you say?\"  He's standing there now holding the mattress with the ticking sticking out. I don't think one torch will get us through. But it will be worth a try for one more look at the sun."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32623"],["title","Geographic Variation in the Pocket Gopher, Cratogeomys castanops, in Coahuila, (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net            ~University of Kansas Publications~              ~Museum of Natural History~            Volume 7, No. 12, pp. 591-608                    March 15, 1955          Geographic Variation in the Pocket Gopher,        Cratogeomys castanops, in Coahuila, México                           BY           ROBERT J.

Russell and Rollin H. Baker     The plateau pocket gopher, _Cratogeomys castanops_, inhabits open lands from southeastern Colorado southward onto the Mexican Plateau as far south as southern San Luis Potosí and southeastern Zacatecas and southeastward to the Coastal Plain of northern Tamaulipas. This species occurs at elevations from as low as 26 feet at Matamoras in Tamaulipas to as high as 8700 feet in valleys of south-eastern Coahuila. In 1934, Nelson and Goldman (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:135-154, June 13, 1934) revised the genus _Cratogeomys_ and decided that six subspecies of _C. castanops_ occurred in Coahuila. In the present account, we describe four previously unknown subspecies from Coahuila, exclude from the state two others recorded from there by Nelson and Goldman, and show that three others named previously from adjacent Mexican states do occur in Coahuila. This makes eleven subspecies now known from that state. From Coahuila Nelson and Goldman had 35 study specimens of _C. castanops_ from seven localities and we have had 234 specimens from 63 localities. Consequently we have been able to define with greater certainty, than formerly was possible, the geographic distribution of _C. castanops_ in this Mexican state and similarly analyze more completely the geographic variation.  Coahuila is near the center of the geographic range of _C. castanops_. The occurrence of 11 subspecies within the state seems to be the result of partial or perhaps, in some cases, total isolation of populations of _C. castanops_ because of the highly dissected topography and the variability of the soil. _Cratogeomys castanops_ is a sedentary animal preferring open plains mantled by suitable soils, preferably sandy in texture, in which the animals can dig their elaborate underground systems of runways. Thin soils of hard texture and rocky soils do not offer optimum habitat for _C. castanops_, and the animals usually are absent or uncommon in such situations. Desert mountains with their thin rocky soils, elevated passes, perpendicular rocky cliffs, and stands of oaks and conifers at higher elevations present impassable barriers for pocket gophers of this species. The Río Grande, bordering Coahuila to the north, in many places flowing through steep-walled cañons, also seems to be a barrier that this fossorial rodent does not cross; distinct subspecies occur on the two sides of the river directly opposite each other (also see Nelson and Goldman, _op. cit._: 143). Smaller streams, such as the Río Salado, Río Nazas and Río Salinas, seem to be unimportant barriers to the passage of these pocket gophers. The food supply of _C. castanops_ seems adequate in most situations and consequently food is unimportant in governing the distribution of this species. Principal foods of _C. castanops_ are fleshy tuberous roots of well-distributed desert shrubs, but in the valleys of the high mountains of southeastern Coahuila, where desert shrubs are absent, roots and leaves of low-growing forbs are eaten.  Three distinct habitats for _C. castanops_ occur in Coahuila. The state is crossed by a series of mostly impassable, mountainous ridges beginning at the northwestern boundary at the Cañon de Boquillas on the Río Grande and extending southeastward to the east-central border. This divides Coahuila into a more humid and less elevated northeastern area which is an inland extension westward of the Coastal Plain and a more arid and higher western and southern area which is a part of the \"Mesa del Norte\" of the Mexican Plateau. In the extreme southeast the still higher elevated plains and intermontane valleys within the Sierra Madre Oriental afford a third habitat for populations of this species. The subspecies of these pocket gophers found in any one of these three habitats show greater affinity to each other than they do to any subspecies found in the other habitats.  Generally speaking, populations of _C. castanops_ from northeastern Coahuila are related, as a group, in color and cranial features. Partial isolation of subspecies in this area results chiefly from discontinuity of suitable soils rather than from topography. These pocket gophers occur most commonly in the deep, sandy soils which are found along streams, especially where farm lands are irrigated. In western and southern Coahuila, mountains extending in both north-south and east-west directions act as partial barriers to the passage of _C. castanops_. Within this large area, pocket gophers occur in desert basins many of which are enclosed on two or more sides by mountains. Even so, with the exception of the smaller _C. c. consitus_ of northwestern Coahuila, all known subspecies occurring at lower elevations in the western and southern part of the state show close relationships in color and cranial features. Those subspecies in the higher parts of southeastern Coahuila by their small size and dark color reflect to a high degree their isolation in an elevated habitat.  Males of _C. castanops_ differ greatly from females of equal age; consequently animals of the same sex, as well as of the same age, are used herein for taxonomic comparisons. Since, of any given age-group, females show less individual variation than do males, we have relied more on the characteristics of the females in this taxonomic study. Only specimens taken at approximately the same times of the year have been compared for color of pelage. Capitalized color terms are those of Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912. Specimens made available through the courtesy of the authorities of the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum are indicated in the accounts of subspecies as BSC; other specimens listed are in the collection of the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Assistance with field work is acknowledged from the Kansas University Endowment Association and the National Science Foundation.  In any one of the lists of \"Specimens examined\" beyond, the order of arrangement of the localities is from north to south. Those localities listed in Roman type are represented on the distribution map (Figure 1) by blacked-in circles. Each of several circles covers two or more localities because the localities are close together. In any such instance the northernmost place is listed in Roman type and the names of the other places follow in Italic type. Measurements in millimeters are given in table 1 for females and in table 2 for males.    +Cratogeomys castanops convexus+ Nelson and Goldman   1934. _Cratogeomys castanops convexus_ Nelson and Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 47:142, June 13, type from 7 mi. E Las Vacas [= Villa Acuña], Río Grande Valley, Coahuila (opposite Del Río, Texas).  _Distribution._--Extreme northern Coahuila, east and north of the Serranías del Burro (see fig. 1).  _Diagnosis._--Previously known from only one specimen, a subadult female, this subspecies has not been well diagnosed. At hand we have five near topotypes of _convexus_ (including two adult females and one adult male) and specimens assignable to this subspecies from several other localities. This subspecies may be characterized as follows: Size medium (see tables 1 and 2); dorsal profile of skull convex in females and flat, especially posteriorly, in males; zygomata weakly constructed and not widely flaring; mastoid and tympanic bullae inflated; nasals short; rostrum broad and short; maxillary teeth large.

For comparisons of _convexus_ with the subspecies of _C. castanops_ found to the west, south and southeast, see accounts of the subspecies to follow.  _Remarks._--The geographic range of _convexus_ is restricted, being bounded on the west and southwest by mountains, especially the Serranías del Burro, and on the north and east by the Río Grande. The range of the subspecies found to the southeast may not be continuous with that of _convexus_. At least, in the area between Villa Acuña and Piedras Negras, along the Río Grande, no specimens were obtained and no sign was observed. We suspect that"]]]
