The answer will largely depend upon the way in which we regard those few acres wherein a resting place is ultimately found. For myself, I believe that they are of importance, inasmuch as the securing of a place suitable for the rearing of offspring is a primary condition of success in the attainment of reproduction; and if this be so, it is evident that the interests of the race will be better served by the males making good this first step before the females are ready to pair, otherwise they might oscillate between two modes of behaviour, created by the premature functioning of conflicting impulses.  The different steps in the process seem to follow one another in ordered sequence. The male inherits a disposition--which for us, of course, has prospective meaning--to seek the appropriate breeding ground and there to establish itself; and as early a functioning of this disposition as possible, consonant with the conditions of existence in the external environment, may have been evolved for the following reasons--firstly, the earlier individuals will meet with less interference wherever they may settle, every locality will be open to them, every acre free, their only need being that particular environment for which racial preparation has fitted them. In the second place, being already established when other males appear upon the scene, and advertising their presence by song, they will be less liable to molestation; thirdly, in those cases in which a long journey is undertaken, they will have ample time to recover from the fatigue, and, if attacked by later arrivals, will thus be in a better position to defend their territories; and lastly, a greater uniformity in their distribution will be insured before the females begin their search.  There is, besides, another good reason for thinking that the earlier males will have an advantage. We will assume--and from the abundant evidence supplied by the marking of birds, it is quite a reasonable assumption--that there is a tendency, generally speaking, for individuals to return to the neighbourhood of their birthplace, or to the place in which they had previously reared their offspring. Now the earlier arrivals will have no difficulty in securing territories; those that come later may have to search more diligently, still they will gain all that they require so long as any available space remains. Then comes the point when all suitable ground is occupied, and yet there are males to be provided for. What will be the position of these males? Urged by their inherited nature, they will leave the district and possibly continue their search into those adjoining, only, however, to add to the difficulties of the males there similarly situated; and even allowing that they are at length successful in establishing themselves, what are their prospects of securing mates? Since the earlier females will not extend their wanderings farther than is absolutely necessary, but will pair whenever the opportunity for doing so arises, it is to the later females, forced onwards by competition, that the late males must look for mates; so that when at length pairing does take place, much valuable time will have been lost.  The disadvantages which the late arrivals have to face are therefore great, and it is probable that the percentage which attain to reproduction will on the average be somewhat lower than the percentage in the case of the earlier arrivals. The district in which my observations have been made lies well within the limits of the breeding range of most of our common species, and it is not surprising that I should have met with little evidence of failure to breed as a result of failure to secure territory. Some interesting information was supplied to me, however, by the late Robert Service. He found, in certain seasons in Dumfriesshire, flocks of from ten to fifty unmated Sedge-Warblers, which, from the time of their arrival in May until the middle of July, haunted reed-filled spaces along stagnant streams. These flocks appeared to him to be composed of loosely-attached individuals of a migrant flock that had failed to find things congenial enough to entice them to disperse. But may they not have been composed of males that had failed to secure territories, or of females that had failed to discover males in possession of territories, or of both?   We have seen that, in the case of many species, each male establishes itself in a particular place at the commencement of the breeding season, even though this may mean a partial or perhaps a complete severance from former companions. We must now discuss this fact in greater detail because it is opposed to the views often held regarding the sexual behaviour of birds, and is manifestly of importance when considering the theory of breeding territory.  First, however, there is a point which requires some explanation. I speak of the _same_ male being in the _same_ place. How can I prove its identity? In the first place it is highly improbable that a bird which roams about within the same small area of ground, makes regular use of a certain tree and a certain branch of that tree, and observes a similar routine day after day, can be other than the same individual. But, apart from this general consideration, are there any means by which individuals of the same species can be identified? Well, there is variation in the plumage. Supposing we take a dozen cock Chaffinches and examine them carefully, we shall find slight differences in pattern and in colour--more grey here or a duller red there, as the case may be--and though these differences may not be sufficient to enable us to pick out a bird at a distance, they are nevertheless conspicuous when it is close at hand. Then again there is variation in the song; and the more highly developed the vocal powers the greater scope there is for variation. But even the phrases of a simple song can be split up and recombined in different ways. If one were asked casually whether the different phrases of the Reed-Bunting's song always followed one another in the same sequence, the answer would probably be that they certainly did so, whereas the bird is capable of combining the few notes it possesses in a surprising number of different ways. And lastly, there are differences in just the particular way in which specific behaviour, founded upon a congenital basis, is adapted by each individual to its own special environment. Racial preparation determines behaviour as a whole, but the individual is allowed some latitude in the execution of details which are in themselves of small moment--the selection of a particular tree as a headquarters and a particular branch upon that tree, the direction of the distant excursion, and the direction of the limited wanderings within the small area surrounding the headquarters which in the course of time determine the extent of the territory, are matters for each individual to decide when the occasion for doing so arises. Moreover instances of abnormal coloration or abnormal song are not rare, and they are valuable since they place the identity of the individual beyond dispute. I can recall the case of a Willow-Warbler whose song was unlike that of its own or any other species, and of a Redbreast whose voice puzzled me not a little. I can recollect also a male Yellow Bunting whose foot was injured or deformed. Of this bird's behaviour I kept a record for two months or so; and inasmuch as it inhabited a roadside hedge, and was of fearless disposition, the deformed foot could plainly be seen whenever it settled upon the road to search for food. Identification is not, therefore, a difficulty. There is always some small difference in colour or in song, or some well-defined routine which makes recognition possible.  Owing to their great powers of locomotion, birds have generally been regarded as wanderers more or less; anything in the nature of a fixed abode, apart from the actual nest, having been accounted foreign to their mode of life; and even the locality immediately surrounding the nest has not been apprehended as possessing any meaning for the owner of that nest. No doubt the supply of food determines their movements for a considerable part of the year; they seek it where they can find it, here to-day, there to-morrow--in fact few species fail to move their quarters at one season or another, so that there is much truth in the notion that birds are wanderers. Yet to suppose that every individual one sees or hears--every Lapwing on the meadow, or Nightingale in the withy bed--is in that particular spot just because it happens to alight there as it roams from place to place, is to take a view which the observed facts do not support. For as soon as the question of reproduction dominates the situation, a new condition arises, and the habits formed during the previous months are reversed, and the males, avoiding one another, or even becoming actively hostile, prefer a life of seclusion to their former gregariousness--all of which occurs just at the moment when we might reasonably expect them to exhibit an increased liveliness and restlessness as a result of their endeavour to secure mates; and so universal is the change that it might almost be described as an accompaniment of the sexual life of birds generally.  That the Raven and certain birds of prey exert an influence over the particular area which they inhabit has long been known, and it has been recognised more especially in the case of the Peregrine Falcon, possibly because the bird lives in a wild and attractive country, and, forcing itself under the notice of naturalists, has thus had a larger share of attention devoted to its habits. Moreover, when a species is represented by comparatively few individuals, and each pair occupies a comparatively large tract of country, it is a simple matter to trace the movements and analyse the behaviour of the birds. There is a rocky"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],["title","Territory in Bird Life (#8)"],["body"," in the north-west of Co. Donegal comprising some seven miles or so of cliffs, where three pairs of Falcons and two pairs of Ravens have nested for many years. Each year the different pairs have been more or less successful in rearing their young; each year the young can be seen accompanying their parents up to the time when the sexual instinct arises; and yet the actual number of pairs is on the whole remarkably constant, and there is no perceptible increase. It seems as if the numbers of three and two respectively were the maximum the headland could maintain. But this is no exceptional case; it represents fairly the conditions which obtain as a rule amongst those species, granting, of course, a certain amount of variation in the size of each territory determined by the exigencies of diverse circumstances.  If we take a given district, and devote our attention to the smaller migrants that visit Western Europe each returning spring for the purpose of procreation, we shall find that the movements of the males are subject to a very definite routine. This, however, is not true of every male; some may be wending their way to breeding grounds at a distance; others may be seeking the particular environment to which they may be adapted; others again, having found their old haunts destroyed, may consequently be seeking new.  Of all this there is evidence. Small parties of Chiffchaffs pass through a district on their way to other breeding grounds, flitting from hedge to hedge as they move in a definite direction with apparently a definite purpose; Reed-Warblers settle in a garden or plantation, eminently unsuited to their requirements, and disappear; Wood-Warblers arrive in some old haunt, and finding it no longer suitable for their purpose, seek new ground. So that plenty of individuals are always to be found, which, for the time being at least, are wanderers.  In the district which I have in mind, the wandering males form only a small part of the incoming bird population. The majority of individuals that fall under observation are those that have made this particular district their destination; and in doing so, they may possibly have been guided by their experience as owners or inmates of former nests, for it cannot be doubted that a return to the neighbourhood of the birthplace would lead to a more uniform distribution and therefore be advantageous, and the tendency to do so might consequently have become interwoven in the tissue of the race. How, then, do they behave? A certain amount of movement, an interchanging of positions, even though restricted to an area defined, let us say, by experience, might be expected under the circumstances--that, however, is not what we find; we observe the available situations plotted out into so many territories, each one of which is occupied by a male who passes the whole of his time therein. Take whatever species we will--Whitethroat, Whinchat, Willow-Warbler, Red-backed Shrike, it matters not which, for there is no essential difference in the general course of procedure--this condition will be found to prevail. Generally speaking, the behaviour in relation to the territory can be studied more conveniently where a number of individuals of the same species have established themselves in proximity to one another. Such species as the Chiffchaff, Willow-Warbler, or Wood-Warbler are often sufficiently common to allow of three or more of their respective males being kept in view at the same time; and the disposition to occupy a definite position can be readily observed. The Reed-Warbler is a suitable subject for an investigation of this kind; for since it is restricted by its habits to localities wherein the common reed (_Arundo phragmites_) grows in abundance, and since such localities are none too plentiful and often limited in extent, the area occupied by each individual is necessarily small--if it were not so the species would become extinct. Hence it is a simple matter to study the routine of the different individuals and to mark the extent of their wanderings.  In this way the males of all the Warblers that breed commonly in Great Britain establish themselves, each one in its respective station at the respective breeding ground; so, too, do those of many other migrants--for example, the Whinchat, Wheatear, Tree-Pipit, and Red-backed Shrike. All of these, it is true, are common species--numbers of individuals can often be found in close proximity--and therefore it may be argued that they keep to one position more from pressure of population than from any inherited disposition working towards that end. But the rarer species behave similarly. Districts frequented by the Marsh-Warbler and offering plenty of situations of the type required by the bird are often inhabited by a few members only, and yet the disposition to remain in a definite position is just as marked.  You will say, however, that these smaller migrants have no exceptional powers of flight; that they have besides just completed a long and arduous journey; and you will ask why they should be expected to wander, whether it is not more reasonable to expect that, in order to overcome their fatigue, they should remain where they settle. The Cuckoo is a wanderer in the wider sense of the term, and is gifted with considerable powers of flight. Upon arrival the male flies briskly from field to field, showing but little signs of weariness; yet we have only to follow its movements for a few days in succession to assure ourselves that the bird is no longer a wanderer; for just as the Warbler or the Chat moves only within a definitely delimited area, so the male Cuckoo, strange as it may seem, restricts itself to a particular tract of land. The area over which it wanders is often considerable and consequently it is not possible to keep the bird always in view, but inasmuch as the variation in the voices of different individuals is quite appreciable, identification is really a simple matter. If we cannot keep the bird in sight, we can trace its movements by sound and mark the extent of its wanderings, which by repetition become more and more defined, until a belt of trees here, or an orchard there, mark a rough and rarely passed boundary line.  Let us take another example from the larger migrants--the Black-tailed Godwit, a bird common enough in the Dutch marshes but no longer breeding in this country. On suitable stretches of marsh land, numbers will be found in proximity one to another after the manner of the Lapwing, each male occupying a definite space of ground wherein it passes the time preening, searching for food, or in sleep--though at the same time keeping a strict watch over its territory. Now the preference shown for a particular piece of ground, and the determination with which it is resorted to, is the more remarkable when we take into consideration the specific emotional behaviour arising from the seasonal sexual condition. This behaviour is expressed in a peculiar flight. The bird rises high in the air, circles round with slowly beating wings above the marsh, and utters a call which, as far as my experience goes, is characteristic of the performance. The air is often full of individuals circling thus even beyond the confines of the marsh, for a male does not limit its flight to a space immediately above its territory; but nevertheless careful observation will show how unerringly each one returns to its own position on the breeding ground, no matter how extensive the aerial excursion may have been. And so, when the males of the smaller migrants confine their movements to an acre of ground at the completion of their long journey, they are acting no more under the influence of fatigue than the Cuckoo, which keeps within certain bounds yet flies about briskly, or the Godwit which, though holding to its few square yards on the ground, executes most tiring and extensive flights above the marsh.  Of all the migrants, however, the behaviour of the Ruff is perhaps the most strange, and though it has long been known that these birds have their special meeting places where they perform antics and engage in serious strife, yet it is only within recent years that the primary purpose of these gatherings has been ascertained--that purpose being the actual discharge of the sexual function. Mr. Edmund Selous has carried out some exhaustive investigations into their activities at the meeting places, and he makes it clear that each bird has its allotted position. He says, for example, that \"It begins to look as though different birds had little seraglios of their own in different parts of the ground,\" that \"each Ruff has certainly a place of its own,\" or again that \"this Ruff indeed, which I think must be a tender-foot, does not seem to have a place of its own like the others.\" Nevertheless it is only at the meeting places that they have their special positions; there is no evidence to show that each one has a special territory, wherein it seeks its food, as the Warbler has, and therefore some may think that we are here confronted with behaviour of a different order. But we must bear in mind that the process has been adjusted to meet the requirements of different species: the size of the territory, the period of its daily occupation, the purpose which it serves--these all depend upon manifold relationships and do not affect the principle. Why it has been differentiated in different circumstances we shall have occasion to discuss later; for the moment it is enough that at the end of its migratory journey each Ruff occupies one position on the meeting ground.
