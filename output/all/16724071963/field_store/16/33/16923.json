A red light pulsated on a panel, alone in a string of white ones.  \"Trouble's in the hoist-mechanism,\" said Hyrst. \"That's your department.\" He smiled and sat down on a metal bench in the center of the room, with his back to the stair. \"D Level.\"  MacDonald grumbled, and went to a skeletal cage built over a round segment of the floor. Various tools were clipped to the ribs of the cage. MacDonald pulled an extra rayproof protectall over his vac-suit and stepped inside the cage, pressing a button. The cage dropped, into a circular shaft that paralleled the hoist right down to the feeder mechanism.  Hyrst waited. Inside his helmet he could hear MacDonald breathing and grumbling as he worked away, repairing a break in the belt. He did not hear anything else. Then something happened, so swiftly that he had never had any memory of it, and some time later he came to and looked for MacDonald. The cage was way down at the bottom of the shaft and MacDonald was in it, with a very massive pedestal-block on top of him. The block had been unbolted from the floor and dragged to the edge of the shaft, and it could not possibly have been an accident that it tumbled in, between the wide-apart ribs of the cage.  And that's how MacDonald died, Hyrst thought--and so _I_ died. They said I forced the secret of his Titanite find out of him, and then killed him.  Shearing asked swiftly, \"MacDonald never gave you any hint of where he'd hidden the Titanite?\"  \"No,\" said Hyrst. He paused, and then said, \"It's the Titanite you're after?\"  Shearing answered carefully. \"In a way, yes. But _we_ didn't kill MacDonald for it. Those who did kill him are the men who are after you now. They're afraid you might lead us to the stuff.\"  Hyrst swore, shaking with sudden anger. \"Damn it, I won't be treated like a child. Not by you, by anyone. I want--\"  \"You want the men who killed MacDonald,\" said Shearing. \"I know. I remember what was in your mind when you met your son.\"  A weakness took Hyrst and he leaned his forehead against the cold stone wall.  \"I'm sorry,\" said Shearing. \"But we want what you want--and more. So much more that you can't dream it. You must trust us.\"  \"Us? That woman?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Once again in Shearing's mind Hyrst saw the woman with her head against the stars, and the ship looming darkly. He saw the woman much more clearly, and she was like a fire, burning with anger, burning with a single-minded, dedicated purpose. She was beautiful, and frightening.  \"She, and others,\" said Shearing. \"Listen. We must go soon. We're to be picked up, secretly. Will you trust us--or would you rather trust yourself to those who are hunting you?\"  Hyrst was silent. Shearing said, \"Well?\"  \"I'll go with you,\" said Hyrst.  They went out into the cold darkness, and Hyrst heard Shearing say in his mind, \"I wouldn't try to run--\"  _But it wasn't Shearing speaking in his mind now, it was a third man._  \"I wouldn't try to run--\"  Frantically startled, Hyrst threw out his mental vision and saw the men who stood around them in the darkness, four men, three of them holding the wicked little weapons called bee-guns in their hands. The fourth man came closer, a dark slender man with a face like a fox, high-boned, narrow-eyed, smiling. It came to Hyrst that the three with weapons were only ordinary men, and that it was this fourth man whose mind had spoken.  He was speaking aloud now. \"I want you alive, believe me--but there are endless gradations between alive and dead. My men are very accurate.\"  Shearing's face was suddenly drawn and exhausted. \"Don't try anything,\" he warned Hyrst wearily. \"He means it.\"  The dark man shook his head at Shearing. \"This wasn't nice of you. You knew we had a particular interest in Mr. Hyrst.\" He turned to Hyrst and smiled. His teeth were small and very neat and white. \"Did you know that Shearing has been keeping a shield over your mind as well as his? A little too large a task for him. When you jarred his mind open for an instant, it was all we needed to lead us here.\"  He went on. \"Mr. Hyrst, my name is Vernon. We'd like you to come with us.\"  Vernon nodded to the three accurate men, and the whole little group began to walk in the direction of the spaceport. Shearing seemed almost asleep on his feet now. It was as though he had expended all his energy on a task, and failed at it, and was now quiescent, like an empty well waiting to fill again.  \"Where are we going?\" Hyrst asked, and Vernon answered:  \"To see a gentleman you've never heard of, in a place you've never been.\" He added, with easy friendliness, \"Don't worry, Mr. Hyrst, we have nothing against _you_. You're new to this--ah--state of life. You shouldn't be asked to make decisions or agreements until you know both sides of the question. Mr. Shearing was taking an unfair advantage.\"  Remembering the dark hard purpose Shearing had let him see in his mind, Hyrst could not readily dispute that. But he put out an exploring probe in the direction of Vernon's mind.  It was shut tight.  They walked on, toward the spaceport gates.     CHAPTER III   All space was before him, hung with the many-colored lights of the stars, intensely brilliant in the black nothing. It was incredibly splendid, but it was too much like what he had looked at with his cold unseeing eyes for fifty years. He looked down--down being relative to where he was standing in the blister-window--and saw the whole Belt swarming by under him like a drift of fireflies. He quivered inwardly with a chill vertigo, and turned away.  Vernon was talking aloud. He had been talking for some time. He was stretched out on a soft, deep lounge, smoking, pretending to sip from a tall glass.  \"So you see, Mr. Hyrst, we can help you a lot. It's not easy for a Lazarite--for one of us--to get a job. I know. People have a--well, a _feeling_. Now Mr. Bellaver--\"  \"Where is Shearing?\" asked Hyrst. He came and stood in the center of the room, with the soft lights in his eyes and the soft carpets under his feet. His mind reached out, uneasy and restless, but it seemed to be surrounded by a zone of fog that tangled and confused and deflected it. He could not find Shearing.  \"We've been here for hours,\" he said. \"Where is he?\"  \"Probably talking a deal with Mr. Bellaver. I wouldn't worry. As I was saying, Bellaver Incorporated is interested in men like you. We're the largest builders of spacecraft in the System, and we can afford--\"  \"I know all about it,\" said Hyrst impatiently. \"Old Quentin Bellaver was busy swallowing up his rivals when I went through the door.\"  \"Then,\" said Vernon imperturbably, \"you should realize how much we can do for you. Electronics is a vital branch--\"  Hyrst moved erratically around the room, looking at things and not really seeing them, hearing Vernon's voice but not understanding what it said. He was growing more and more uneasy. It was as though someone was calling to him, urgently, but just out of earshot. He kept straining, with his ears and his mind, and Vernon's voice babbled on, and the barrier was like a wall around his thoughts.  They had been aboard this ship for a long time now, and he had not seen Shearing since they came through the hatch. It was not really a ship, of course. It had no power of its own, depending on powerful tugs to tow it. It was Walter Bellaver's floating pleasure-palace, and the damnedest thing Hyrst had ever seen. Vernon said it could and often did accommodate three or four hundred guests in the utmost luxury. There was nobody aboard it now but Bellaver, Vernon, Hyrst and Shearing, the three very accurate men, and perhaps a dozen others including stewards and the crews of the tugs and Bellaver's yacht. It was named the _Happy Dream_, and it was presently drifting in an excessively lonely orbit high above the ecliptic, between nothing and nowhere.  Vernon had been with him almost constantly. He was getting tired of Vernon. Vernon talked too much.  \"Listen,\" he said. \"You can stop selling Bellaver. I'm not looking for a job. Where's Shearing?\"  \"Oh, forget Shearing,\" said Vernon, impatient in his turn. \"You never heard of him until a few days ago.\"  \"He helped me.\"  \"For reasons of his own.\"  \"What's _your_ reason? And Bellaver's?\"  \"Mr. Bellaver is interested in all social problems. And I'm a Lazarite myself, so naturally I have a sympathy for others like me.\" Vernon sat up, putting his glass aside on a low table. He had drunk hardly any of the contents.  \"Shearing,\" he said, \"is a member of a gang who some time ago stole a particular property of Bellaver Incorporated. You're not involved in the quarrel, Mr. Hyrst. I'd advise you, as a friend, to stay not involved.\"  Hyrst's mind and his ears were stretched and quivering, straining to hear a cry for help just a little too far away.  \"What kind of a property?\" asked Hyrst.  Vernon shrugged. \"The Bellavers have never said what kind, for fairly obvious reasons.\"  \"Something to do with ships?\"  \"I suppose so. It isn't important to me. Nor to you, Mr. Hyrst.\"  \"Will you pour me a drink?\" said Hyrst, pointing to the cellaret close beside Vernon. \"Yes, that's fine. How long ago?\"  \"What?\" asked Vernon, measuring whisky into a glass.  \"The theft,\" said Hyrst, and threw his mind suddenly against the barrier. For one fleeting second he forced a crack in it. \"Something over fifty--\", said Vernon, and let the glass fall. He spun around from the cellaret and was halfway to his feet when Hyrst hit him. He hit him three or four times before he would stay down, and three or four more before he would lie quiet. Hyrst straightened up, breathing hard. His lip was bleeding and he wiped it with the back of his hand. \"That was a little too big a job for _you_, Mr. Vernon,\" he said viciously. \"Trying to keep my mind blanked and under control for hours.\" He stuffed a handkerchief into Vernon's mouth, and tied him up with his own cummerbund,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32486"],["title","The Legion of Lazarus (#3)"],["body"," and shoved him out of sight behind an enormous bed. Then he opened the door carefully, and went out.         *       *       *       *       *  There was nobody in the corridor. This was wide and ornate, with doors opening off it, and nothing to show what was behind them or which way to go. Hyrst stood still a minute, getting control of himself. The barrier no longer obscured his mind. He let it rove, finding that every time he did that it was easier, and the images clearer. He heard Shearing again, as he had heard him in that one second when Vernon's guard had faltered. His face became set and ugly. He began to move toward the stern of the _Happy Dream_.  Heavy metal-cloth curtains closed this end of the corridor. Beyond them was a ballroom in which only one dim light now burned, a vastness of black polished floors and crystal windows looking upon space. Hyrst's footsteps were hushed and swallowed up in whispering echoes. He made his way across to another set of curtains, edged between them with infinite caution, and found himself in the upper aisle of an amphitheater.  It was pitch dark where he was, and he stood perfectly still, exploring with his mind. He could not see any guards. The rows of empty seats were arranged in circles around a central pit, large enough for any entertainment Mr. Bellaver might decide to give. The pit was brilliantly lighted, and from somewhere lower down came the intermittent sound of voices.  Also from the pit came Shearing's cries. Hyrst began to tremble with outrage and anger, and his still-uncertain mental control faltered dangerously. Then from out of nowhere, a voice spoke in his mind, and he saw the face of the woman he had seen twice before, the woman Shearing served.  \"Careful,\" she said. \"There is a Lazarite with Bellaver. His attention is all on Shearing, but you must keep your mind shielded. I'll help you.\"  Hyrst whispered. \"Thanks.\" He felt calm now, alert and capable. He crept along the dark aisle, toward the pit.  Mr. Bellaver's theater lacked nothing. The large circular stage area was fitted with upper and lower electro-magnets for the use of acrobats and dancers with null-grav specialties. They could perform without disturbing the regular grav-field of the _Happy Dream_, thus keeping the guests comfortable, and by skillful manipulation of the magnetic fields more spectacular stunts were possible than in ordinary no-gravity.  Shearing was in the pit, between the upper and lower magnets. He wore an acrobat's metal attraction-harness, strapped on over his clothes. When Hyrst looked over the rail he was hanging at the central point of weightlessness, where everything in a man floats free and his senses are lost in a dreadful vertigo unless he has been conditioned over a long period of time to get used to it. Shearing had not been conditioned.  \"Careful,\" said the woman's warning voice in his mind. \"His life depends on you. No, don't try to make contact with him! The Lazarite would sense you--\"  Shearing began a slow ascension toward the upper magnet as the current was increased, from some unseen control board. He moved convulsively turning horizontally around the axis of his own middle like a toy spun on a string. His back was uppermost, and Hyrst could not see his face.  \"Bellaver and the Lazarite,\" said the woman quietly, \"are trying to learn from Shearing where our ship is. He has been able so far to keep his mind shielded. He is--a very brave man. But you'll have to hurry. He's near the breaking point.\"  Shearing was now almost level with Hyrst, suspended over that open pit, looking down, a long way.  \"You'll have to be quick, Hyrst. Please. Please get him out of there before we have to kill him.\"  The current in the magnet was cut and Shearing fell, with a long neighing scream.         *       *       *       *       *  Hyrst looked down. The repelling force of the lower magnet cushioned the fall, and the upper magnet took hold, hard. Shearing stopped about three feet above the stage floor and started slowly to rise again. He seemed to be crying. Hyrst turned and ran back to the top of the aisle. Halfway around the circle he found steps and went tearing down them. On the next level--there were three--he saw two men leaning over the broad rail, watching Shearing.  \"Yes, there they are. You must find a weapon--\"  Hyrst looked around, blinking like a mole in the dark. Seats, nothing but seats. Ornamentation, but all solid. Small metal cylinder, set in a wall niche. Chemical extinguisher. Yes. Compact and heavy. He took it.  \"Hurry. He's almost through--\"  The two men were tense and hungry, eager as wolves. One was the Lazarite, a grey man, old and seamed with living and none of it good. The other was Bellaver, and he was young. He was tall and fresh-faced, impeccably shaven, impeccably dressed, the keen, clean, public-spirited executive.  \"I can give you more if you want it, Shearing,\" Bellaver said, his fingers ready on a control-plate set into the broad rail. \"How about it?\"  \"Shut up, Bellaver,\" whispered the Lazarite aloud. \"I've almost got it. Almost--\" His face was agonized with concentration.  \"_Now!_\"  The woman's voiceless cry in his mind sent Hyrst forward. His hand swung up and then down in a crashing arc, elongated by the heavy cylinder. The Lazarite fell without a sound. He fell across Bellaver, pushing him back from the control-plate, and lay over his feet, bleeding gently into the thick pile of the carpet. Bellaver's mouth and eyes opened wide. He looked at the Lazarite and then at Hyrst. He leaped backward, away from the encumbrance at his ankles, making the first hoarse effort at a shout for help. Hyrst did not give him time to finish it. The first row of seats caught Bellaver and threw him, and Hyrst swung the cylinder again. Bellaver collapsed.  \"Was I in time?\" Hyrst asked of the woman, in his mind. He thought she was crying when she answered, \"Yes.\" He smiled. He stepped over the Lazarite and went to the control-plate and began to work with it until he had Shearing safely on the floor of the stage. Then he cut the power and ran down another flight of steps to the bottom level. His mind was able to range free now. He could not sense anyone close at hand. Bellaver seemed to have sent underlings elsewhere in the _Happy Dream_ while he worked on Shearing. It was nothing for which a man would seek witnesses. Hyrst vaulted the rail onto the stage and dragged Shearing away from the magnet. He felt uncomfortable in all that glare of light. He hauled and grunted until he got Shearing over the rail into the dark. Then he wrestled the harness off him. Shearing sobbed feebly, and retched.  \"Can you stand up?\" said Hyrst. \"Hey. Shearing.\" He shook him, hard. \"Stand up.\"  He got Shearing up, a one-hundred-and-ninety pound rag doll draped over his shoulders. He began to walk him out of the theater. \"Are you still there?\" he asked of the woman.  The answer came into his mind swiftly. \"Yes. I'll help you watch. Do you see where the skiff is?\"  It was in a pod under the belly of the _Happy Dream_. \"I see it,\" said Hyrst.  \"Take that. Bellaver's yacht is faster, but you'd need the crew. The skiff you can handle yourself.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He walked Shearing into a fore-and-aft corridor. Shearing's feet were beginning to move of their own accord, and he had stopped retching. But his eyes were still blank and he staggered aimlessly. Hyrst's nerves were prickling with a mixture of fierce satisfaction and fear. Far above in the lush suite he felt Vernon stir and come to. There were men somewhere closer, quite close. He forced his mind to see. Two of the very accurate men who had been with Vernon were playing cards with two others who were apparently stewards. The third one lolled in a chair, smoking. All five were in a lounge just around the corner of a transverse corridor. The door was open.  Without realizing that he had done so, Hyrst took control of Shearing's mind. \"Steady, now. We're going past that corner without a sound. You hear me, Shearing? Not a sound.\"  Shearing's eyes flickered vaguely. He frowned, and his step became steadier. The floor of the corridor was covered in a tough resilient plastic that deadened footsteps. They passed the corner. The men continued to play cards. Hyrst sent up a derisive insult to Vernon and told Shearing to hurry a little. The stair leading down into the pod was just ahead, ten yards, five--  A man appeared in the corridor ahead, coming from some storeroom with a rack of plastic bottles in his hand.  \"You'll have to run now,\" came the woman's thought, coolly. \"Don't panic. You can still make it.\"  The man with the bottles yelled. He began to run toward Hyrst and Shearing, dropping the rack to leave his hands free. In the loungeroom behind them the card-party broke up. Hyrst took Shearing by the arm and clamped down even tighter on his mind, giving him a single command. They ran together, fast.  The men from the lounge poured out into the main corridor. Their voices were confused and very loud. Ahead, the man who had been bringing the bottles was now between Hyrst and the stair. He was a brown, hard man who looked like a pilot. He said, \"You better stop,\" and then he grappled with Hyrst and Shearing. The three of them spun around in a clumsy dance, Shearing moving like an automaton. Hyrst and the pilot flailing away with their fists, and then the pilot fell back hard on the seat of his pants, with the blood bursting out of his nose and his eyes glazing. Hyrst raced for the stair, propelling Shearing. They tumbled down it with a shot from a bee-gun buzzing over their heads. It was a short stair with a double-hatch door at the bottom. They fell through it, and Hyrst slammed it shut almost on the toes of a man coming down the stair behind them. The automatic lock took hold. Hyrst told Shearing, \"You can stop now.\"  A few minutes later, from the great swag belly of the _Happy Dream_, a small space-ski"]]]
