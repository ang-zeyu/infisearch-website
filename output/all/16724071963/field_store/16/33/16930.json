Pity you refused to return to the States for a complete cure right then. As it is it's turned recurrent; left you a bit anemic, liver's slightly affected. But in all other respects you're sound of limb and wind; we've gone over the report pretty carefully.\"  \"Then why bother with me at all?\" Lee said irritably. He had been in doctors' hands too often and had become a little impatient of them.  The freckled hand of Mellish patted his arm. \"We do things different over here,\" he said and Bondy chimed in. \"Or rather The Brain does. Just lie down on that table, Dr. Lee, and relax. We're going to enjoy a little movie together, that's all.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lee did as he was bidden, but hesitant and suspiciously. He hated medical exams, especially those where parts of one's body were hooked up to a lot of impressive machinery. Of this there obviously was a good deal. The two medics seemed determined literally to wall him in with gadgetry. From the ceiling they lowered a huge, heavy-looking disk; not lights, but more like an electro-magnet beset with protruding needles. Lee couldn't see the cables but hoped they were strong, for the thing weighed at least a ton and, overhanging him, looked much more ominous than the sword of Damocles. They wheeled a silver screen to the foot of the table and batteries of what appeared to be thermo-therapeutic equipment to both sides. He wasn't being hooked up to anything, but there was much activity with testing of circuits, button-pushings and shiftings of relay-levers. And then all of a sudden lights went out in the room.  \"Say, what is the meaning of all this?\" Lee raised his head uneasily from the hard cushion. All he could see now were arrays of luminous dials and the faint radiations from electronic tubes filtering through metal screens inside the apparatus which fenced him in. From behind his head a suave voice--was it Bondy's or Mellish's answered out of the dark.  \"This is a subconscious analysis and mental reactions test, Dr. Lee. It's an entirely new method made possible only by The Brain. It has tremendous possibilities; they might include your own work as well.\"  \"Oh Lord,\" Lee moaned. \"Something like psychoanalysis? Have you got it mechanized by now? How terrible.\"  There was a low chuckle from the other side of his head; they both appeared to have drawn up chairs beyond his field of vision. Lee didn't like it; he liked none of it, in fact. He felt trapped.  \"No, Dr. Lee,\" said the chuckling voice. \"This isn't psychoanalysis in the old sense at all. You are not exposed to any fanciful human interpretation, and it isn't wholly mechanical either as you seem to think. The Brain is going to show you certain images and by way of spontaneous psychosomatic reaction you are going to produce certain images in response. Results are visual, immediate and as convincing as a reflection in a mirror; that's the new beauty of it. And now, concentrate your mind upon your body. Do you feel anything touching you?\"  \"Y-e-s,\" Lee said, \"I think I do--it's--it's uncanny: it's like spiders' feet--millions of them. It's running all over my skin. What is it?\"  \"I think he's warming up,\" whispered the second voice; then came the first again.  \"It's feeler rays, Dr. Lee; the first wave, low penetration surface rays.\"  \"Where do they come from?\"  \"From overhead; that is, from the teletactile centers of The Brain.\"  \"What do they do to me?\"  There was the low chuckle again. \"They excite the surface nerves of your body, open up the path for the deep-penetration rays; they proceed from the lower organs to the higher ones; in the end they reach the conscious levels of your brain. It's the tune-in as we call it, Dr. Lee.\"  A small movie projector began to purr; a bright rectangle was thrown upon the silver screen and then, Lee stirred. Hands, soothing but firm held him down. \"Where did you get _those_.\" he exclaimed.  \"From many sources,\" a calm answer came, \"The papers, the newsreels, the War-Department, old friends of yours....\"         *       *       *       *       *  What was unrolled on the silver screen were chapters from Lee's own life. They were incomplete, they were hastily thrown together, they were like leaves which a child tears from its picturebook. But knowing the book of his life, every picture acted as a key unlocking the treasures and the horrors amassed in the vaults of memory. It began with the old homestead in Virginia. Mother had taken that reel of the new mechanical cotton picker at work. There it was, a great big thing with the darkies standing around scratching their heads. There he was himself, aged twelve, with his .22 cal. rifle in hand and Musha, the coon dog, by his side; Musha, how he had loved that dog--and how he had cried when it got killed.  Pictures of the Alexander Hamilton Military Academy. Some of the worst years of his life he had spent behind the walls of that imitation castle.  The bombs upon Pearl Harbor.... He had enlisted the following day. On his return from the induction center mother had said.... Her figure, her movements, her voice loomed enormous in his memory.... But now the pictures of the Pacific War flicked across the screen.... They were picked from campaigns in which he, Lee had participated. They were also picked from documentaries which the government had never dared to let the public see ... close-ups of a torpedoed troop carrier, capsizing, coming down upon the struggling survivors in the shark-infested sea. It had been his own ship, the _Monticello_, but he had never known that an automatic camera had operated in the nose of the plane which had circled the scene....  Port Darwin--Guadacanal--Iwo Jima: close-ups of flame throwing tanks advancing up a ridge. He had commanded one of them.... Antlike human figures of fleeing Japs and the flames leaping at them.... So vivid was the memory that the smell returned to his nostrils, the sickening stench of burning human flesh. It tortured him. His voice was husky with revulsion as he said:  \"What's the good of all this; take it away.\"  \"Oh, no,\" one of the medics answered. \"We couldn't think of that. We've got to see this to the end. What are your physical sensations now, Dr. Lee?\"  \"It's fingers now--soft fingers. They are tapping me from all sides like--like a vibration massage. It's strange though--they're tapping from the inside--little pneumatic hammers at a furious pace. They seem to work upon my diaphragm for a drum. But it doesn't pain.\"  \"Good, very good; that was a fine description, Lee. That burning city was Manilla wasn't it, when MacArthur returned? You were in that second Philippine campaign too weren't you, Lee? That was when you won the Congressional Medal of Honor.\"  Yes, it was Manila all right, and there was Mindanao where the Japs had put up that suicide defence of the caves.  Lee's battalion had been in the attack; steeply uphill with no cover, it had been murder.... And seeing his best men mowed down, he had turned berserk. He had used a bulldozer for a battering ram, had driven it single handed directly into the fire-spitting mouth of the objective, raising its blade like a battle-axe. An avalanche of rocks and dirt had come down from the top of the cave under the artillery barrage and he had rammed the stuff down into the throat of the fiery dragon, again and again. He never rightly knew he did it. It had all ended in a blackout from loss of blood. It had been in a hospital that they pinned that medal on him which he felt was undeserved....  Now the reel showed him what at the time he hadn't seen; the end of the battle for the Philippines: Pulverised volcanic rock seen from the air, battle planes swooping down upon little fumaroles, the ventilator shafts of caves defeated but still unsurrendered. Big, plump canisters plummeted from the bellies of the planes. And then the jellied gasoline ignited, turning those thousands of lives trapped in the deep into one vast funeral pyre.... For over fifteen years he had tried to forget, to bury the war, to keep it jailed up in the dungeon of the subconscious. Now those accursed medics had unleashed the monster of war and as it stared at him from the screen it had that blood-freezing, that hypnotic effect which the Greeks once ascribed to the monstrous Gorgon.  Mellish's voice--or was it Bondy's?--seemed to come through a fog and over a vast distance as it asked: \"What seems to be the matter, Lee? You're sweating, your body shakes; what do you feel?\"  \"It's those rays,\" he tried to defend himself. \"It's the vibrations--the fingers. They are gripping the heart; it's like the whole body was turned into a heart. It's like another life invading mine--it's ghostly. Stop it, for heaven's sake.\"  \"Not yet, Lee, not yet. Everything's under control, you're reacting beautifully; you're really feeling fine, Lee, just fine.\"  \"If only I could get at his throat,\" Lee thought. \"I would squeeze the oil of that voice and never be sorry I did.\" He tried to stir and found that it couldn't be done; every muscle seemed tied in a cataleptic state. Then he heard the other medic speak.  \"You were shown this little movie Lee in order to stimulate your mind into the production of a movie of its own. You have responded, you have answered the call. While you saw the first, the sensory tactile rays working in five layers of penetration have recorded and have carried your every reaction to The Brain. The Brain, in a very real sense has read your mind and it has retranslated these readings into visual images. We are now going to watch the shapes of your own thoughts. Here we go....\"         *       *       *       *       *  The projector which had stopped for a minute began to purr again. As the first thought-image jumped upon the screen there was a low moan of amazement mixed with acute pain. It escaped Lee's mouth, uncontrollably as the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32498"],["title","The Brain (#8)"],["body","of the subconscious opened and he saw:  A monstrous animal shaped like an octopus crawling across a cotton field. Nearer and nearer it crept, enormous, threatening; and suddenly there was a sharp excited bark and a spotted coon dog raced across the field toward the monster. He heard the voice of a small boy whimpering: \"Musha, oh Musha, don't, _please_ don't.\" But the dog wouldn't hear and the monster flashed an enormous evil eye, just once and then it gripped the dog with its tentacle arms tearing its body apart, chewing it up between horrible sabre teeth.... As through an ether mask he heard the two medics say: \"That must have been a considerable shock to him,\" and \"With a sensitive nature like that, and at that sensitive age, such an impression becomes permanent.\"  The Alexander Hamilton Military Academy appeared, not real, yet more than real. It was a narrow court yard surrounded by huge walls slanting toward the inside; it was huge and forbidding, fortress-towers standing guard, it was enormous gates forever barred, it was the figure of a huge Marine pacing fiercely back and forth in front of those gates, the same ghostly Marine watching all gates so that nobody could escape....  \"That's probably his father,\" the voices whispered behind his ears. \"Yes; the archetype. He'll bring up the Mother, too, I'll bet....\"  As in those paintings of the primitives where kings and queens are very tall and common folks are very small, Lee saw her now: Mother. That had been just after induction when he had brought her what he thought was joyous news. Her face filled the whole screen. It looked as if composed from jagged ectoplasms, quite transparent except for the eyes. Deep and burning with pain they were, boring into his own. And there was smoke coming out of her mouth and it formed words: \"But, Semper, you are still a child. One mustn't use children for this sort of thing; one mustn't.\" Every letter of these smoke-written words seemed to be flying toward him on wings....  \"Terrific,\" the voices murmured at Lee's back. \"Remember the case history? She died of cancer six months after he went overseas.\" \"Yes, I remember; he's never seen her again. He's probably built up a strong complex out of that one, too.\"  On the screen now danced images almost totally abstracted from the realities of the filmed documentaries from the war.  They were whirling columns of smoke; they were like the vast, dark interior of a huge thunderhead cloud through which a glider soars, illuminated only by the flashes of lightning as for split seconds they revealed a fraction of some horrible reality: A burning ocean with screaming human faces bobbing in the flames. The whirling tracks of a tank going across some writhing human body and leaving it flat in its tracks, sprawling like an empty coat dyed red. And then the swirling, howling darkness closing in again....  \"Interesting eh?\" A voice broke through his cataleptic trance and the other answered: \"Beautiful; almost a classical case. Great plasticity of imagination.\" \"Yes; that's exactly what sets me wondering; the fellow should have cracked up by all the rules of the game.\" \"How do we know that he hasn't? Maybe he was psycho and they didn't notice; they had some godawful asses for psychiatrists in war medicine. It's quite a possibility; well, his image production is ebbing now; I don't expect anything new of significance, what do you think?\" \"Now; we've got what we wanted anyway. Let's take him out of it; but go easy on the rheostats.\"  The projector stopped. The masterful, the ghostly fingers which had been playing on the keyboard of his mind very slowly receded from a furious fortissimo to a pianissimo. At first only the flutterings of the diaphragm eased, then the violent palpitations of a foreign pulse slipped off the heart; the liberated lungs expanded; tremors were running through the body as through the ice of a frozen river at spring; and then at last the mind escaped from its captivity.         *       *       *       *       *  Gradually as in a cinema after the show the lights reappeared. Blinking, Lee stared at the man who stood over him taking his pulse; it was Bondy. Mellish stood at the foot of the table with his back to Lee; he seemed to watch some apparatus which made noises like a teletype machine. Swinging his legs off the table Lee said:  \"I'm okay; you needn't hold my hand.\"  But then he noticed that he wasn't. His head spun, his whole body was wet with perspiration, he felt very weak and limp. He swayed and buried his face in his hands trying to gain his balance, trying to shake off the trance. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I'm a bit dizzy.\"  As he opened his eyes again the two medics were standing right in front of him and smiling down on him with their bland, professional smiles. Lee felt the upsurge of intense dislike. He had seen those smiles before, often--too often: they seemed to be standard equipment with the medical profession whenever a fellow was about to be dispatched to the \"table\", or worse, to the psychopathic ward. Instinct told him that there was something in the air and also that his best bet would be a brave show of normalcy:  \"This test, these new methods of psychoanalysis, they are extremely interesting,\" he said with an effort.  \"Thank you, Dr. Lee,\" it was Mellish who spoke. \"We knew you would find the experience worthwhile even if we put you under a considerable strain. A complete analysis in those olden days of Dr. Freud took three years; now thanks to The Brain we get approximately the same results within as many hours; that's some progress, isn't it?\"  \"Enormous,\" Lee said dryly while his eyes wandered over to Bondy; he knew the pattern, it would be Bondy's turn now to have a shot at him. There it came; and how he loathed the false heartiness of that voice.  \"Dr. Lee, I'm afraid we have a bit of bad news for you--your test--the results have been negative. You have failed.\"  \"Failed?\" For a fraction of a second Lee's heart stopped beating. \"In what sense? And what does that mean?\"  Now it was Mellish's turn. \"Dr. Lee, there must be frankness amongst colleagues and as a fellow scientist you'll understand. In the first place the decision isn't ours; we merely conduct the test on behalf of The Brain. The Brain, as you know, is the most highly developed machine in all the world. Its functions, its whole existence depend entirely upon the human skills and the human loyalties amongst its staff. A three-billion-dollar investment, plus the vital role of The Brain in our national defence, justify the extreme precautions which we are forced to take for its protection.\"  \"What exactly are you driving at?\"  \"Please don't take it as an insult,\" now it was Bondy again. \"There's nothing personal in this. It's merely that your emotional-reaction chart definitely shows a certain antagonism which from childhood-experience and war-experience you have built up against technology. It's nothing but a potential; it is confined to your subconscious. But even a potential danger of subconscious revolt is more than The Brain can risk amongst its associates. We fully appreciate the wish of our Dr. Scriven to enlist your very valuable aid, but....\"  \"I see\" Lee interrupted, \"but you would feel safer if I were to return to Australia by the next plane.\"  His head bent under the blow. A short 24 hours ago The Brain had been a nebulous, almost a non-existent thing. Since then a whole new world had been opened to him in revelations blinding and magnetic with infinite possibilities. His work--the efforts of a lifetime--would not equal what he could do in days with the aid of The Brain. His love--he would never see Oona Dahlborg again as he left under a shadow, rejected by The Brain.  \"Sorry I wasted so much of your time,\" he said aloud. \"I do not believe in this analysis; I cannot disprove it though. That's all, I guess; I better be going now.\"  \"Here's your pass, Dr. Lee.\" He took mechanically the yellow slip which Bondy handed him....  He had already opened the door when somebody sharply called: \"Dr. Lee, one moment please.\"  He whirled around. \"Yes?\"  \"Will you please read what's written on your slip?\"  Suspiciously he looked at the yellow paper; what more torture were these fellows going to inflict? Then his eyes popped as he read: \"Lee, Semper Fidelis, 39: Cortex capacity 119%, Sensitivity 208%, Personality integration 95%, Service qualification 100%....\" There were more data, but he didn't read them as wide-eyed he stared at the medics. With their faces beaming they looked like identical twins to him; Lee never knew who said the words:  \"Congratulations Lee. That has been your last test. We just had to find out how you would take a serious frustration. You've passed it with flying colors. Shake.\"     CHAPTER IV   Apperception 36, Lee's lab within The Brain, looked much like Apperception 27 except for its interior fittings. As a matter of fact, all the several hundred Apperception Centers were built after the same plan, like suites in a big office building in many respects. They were spread over The Brain occipital region; they were built inside the concrete wall of the \"dura matter\" which in turn lay within the shell of the \"bone matter\", a mile or so of solid rock. Each apperception center had its own elevator shaft which went through the concrete of the \"dura matter\" down to \"Grand Central\", the traffic center below The Brain. Each one was also connected at the other end of its corridor with the glideways which snaked through the interior of The Brain. There were, however, no transversal or direct communications from one apperception center to the next. Because of the extraordinary diversity and secrecy of the projects submitted to The Brain' processings, each apperception center was completely insulated against its neighbors.  Life hadn't changed so much from what it had been in the Australian desert Lee had found; at least not his working life. For all he knew some nuclear "]]]
