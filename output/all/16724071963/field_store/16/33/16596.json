They did not come in sight, but the main road to Chattanooga did, and then a new trouble suggested itself.  \"I won't never dare haul this load uncovered through camp,\" he said to himself. \"The first gang o' roustabout teamsters that I meet'll take every spoonful of the vittles, and I'd be lucky if I have the horse and wagon left. I must hide it some way. How? That's a puzzler.\"  At length a happy idea occurred to him. He stopped by a cedar thicket, and with his jack-knife cut a big load of cedar boughs, which he piled on until every bit of food was thoroughly concealed. This took much time, and as he was finishing he heard a yell on the hill behind, and saw a squad of rebels riding down toward him. He sprang to the seat, whipped up his horse, and as he reached the main road was rejoiced to see a squad of Union cavalry approaching.  \"Here, old man,\" said the Lieutenant in command; \"who are you, and what are you doing here?\"  \"I'm a nurse in the hospital,\" answered the Deacon unhesitatingly. \"I was sent out here to get some cedar boughs to make beds in the hospital. Say, there's some rebels out there, comin' down the hill. They saw me and tuk after me. You'll find 'em right over the hill.\"  \"That's a pretty slick horse you're driving,\" said the Lieutenant. \"Looks entirely too slick to belong to Chattanooga. It's a much better horse than mine. I've a notion--\"  \"Say, them rebels are just over the hill, I tell you,\" said the Deacon in a fever of apprehension of losing his steed. \"They'll be on top of you in a minute if you don't look out.\"  \"Right over the hill, did you say?\" said the Lieutenant, forgetting for the moment the horse. \"Attention, there, boys. Look out for the rebels. Advance carbines--Forward--trot! I'll come back directly and take another look at that horse.\"  The squad trotted up the hill in the direction the Deacon had pointed, and as he drove off as fast as he could he heard the spatter of exchanging shots.  Late in the evening, as he drove off the pontoon into Chattanooga and turned to the right toward his corn-crib he muttered over to himself:  \"They say that when a man starts down the path of sin and crime the road seems greased for his swift progress. The other day I begun with petty larceny and chicken stealin'. To-day it's bin highway robbery, premeditated murder, horse stealin', grand larceny, and tellin' a deliberate lie. What'll I be doin' this time next week? I must git that old man's horse and buckboard back to him somehow, and pay him for his vittles. But how'm I goin' to do it? The army's terribly demoralizin'. I must git Si back home soon, or I won't be fit to associate with anybody outside the penitentiary. How kin I ever go to the communion table agin?\"    CHAPTER II. THE DEACON ATTEMPTED RESTITUTION  TRIED TO RETURN THE HORSE TO HIS OWNER.  SI AND SHORTY were on the anxious lookout for the Deacon when he arrived, and not a little worried lest something might have befallen him.  Si's weakness made him peevish and fretful, and Shorty was not a great deal better.  \"It's an awful risk to have an old man and a civilian come down here into camp,\" Si complained. \"And he oughtn't to go about alone. He's always been used to mingling with the quiet, honest, respectable people. Up home the people are as honest as the day is long. They're religious and peaceable, and Pap's never knowed no other kind. He wouldn't harm nobody for the world, and none o' them'd harm him. He's only a child among these toughs down here. I wisht one of us was able to be with him all the time.\"  \"That father o' yours is certainly quite an innocent old party,\" Shorty answered, consolingly, \"and the things he don't know about army life'd make more'n a pamphlet. But he has a way of wakin' up to the situation that is sometimes very surprisin'. I wisht I was able to go about with him, but I think he's fully able to take care o' himself around in camp. There's always somebody about who won't see an old man and a citizen imposed on. But what I'm afraid of is that he's wandered out in the country, huntin' for somethin' for us to eat, and the guerrillas've got him.\"  And he and Si shuddered at the thought of that good old man in the hands of the merciless scoundrels who infested the mountains and woods beyond the camps.  \"Yes,\" mourned Si, \"Pap's likely to mosey out into the country, jest like he would on Bean Blossom Crick, and stop at the first house he come to, and set down with 'em on the porch, and talk about the weather, and the crops, and the measles in the neighborhood, and the revivals, and the price o' pork and corn, and whether they'd better hold their wheat till Spring, and who was comin' up for office, and all the time the bushwhackers'd be sneakin' up on him, an' him know no more 'bout it than where the blackbirds was roostin'. He's jest that innocent and unsuspiciouslike.\"  \"If they've ketched him,\" said Shorty fiercely, \"we'll find out about it, and when we git able, we'll go out there and kill and burn everything for five miles around. I'll do it, if I have to spend the rest o' my life at hard labor on the Dry Tortugas.\"  They heard the rattle of light wheels on the frozen ground outside, and the hoof-beats of a quickly-moving horse.  \"Buggy or spring-wagon,\" muttered Si with a farmer boy's instinctive interpretation of such sounds. \"What's it doin' in camp? Strange horse. In better condition than any around here.\"  The vehicle stopped in front of the corn-crib at the Deacon's command, \"Whoa!\"  \"Gracious--there's Pap now,\" ejaculated Si, with whom memory went in a bound to the many times he had listened for his father's coming and heard that order.  \"Hello, boys,\" called out the Deacon. \"How are you? Shorty, come out here.\"  Shorty sprang up with something of his old-time alacrity, and Si made an effort to rise, but was too weak.  \"Throw a piece o' that fat pine on the fire. Shorty,\" said the Deacon, \"and let's see what I've got.\"  By the light of the blazing pine, the Deacon pulled off the cedar boughs and developed his store. The boughs had kept in the heat, so that the food was not yet quite cold, though it had a resinous flavor, from its covering. The Deacon broke one of the cornpones in two and gave half of it to Shorty, with as much as he thought he should have of the meat and vegetables. Then he fed Si, who relished the new diet almost as much as he had relished the chicken broth. The Deacon made a hearty supper himself, and then stored away the rest in his \"cellar\" under the crib, rolling up some more large stones as an additional precaution.  \"Well, you beat me,\" said Shorty admiringly, as he studied over the Deacon's booty. \"I used to think I was as slick a forager as there was in the army, but I simply ain't in the same class with a man that kin go out in this Sahara Desert o' starvation and bring in a four-year-old horse and a wagon-load o' cooked vittles. I'd never even see the distance pole runnin' with him. Gen. Rosecrans ought to know you. He'd appoint you Commissary-General o' the army at once. When I get a little stronger I want you to take me out and learn me the ABC's o' foragin'. To think that me and Si wuz grievin' about your being ketched by the guerrillas. What fools we wuz. It wuz lucky for the guerrillas that you didn't run acrost 'em, for you'd a ketched 'em, instid o' 'em you.\"  \"That's what I come purty nigh doin',\" chuckled the Deacon. \"But what in the world 'm I goin' to do with that hoss and buckboard? I must hunt around and find that poor beast some corn for tonight. He's bin driven purty sharp, and he needs his supper jest as bad as I did mine, and I won't feel right unless he has it. Then I must try to git him back to his owner termorrer.\"  \"If he's here to-morrer,\" said Shorty, looking at the animal carefully, \"it'll be a miracle. That's too good a hoss to be kept in this camp by anybody lower'n a Brigadier-General. The boys'll steal him, the Captains take him, the Colonels seize him, and the Brigadier-Generals appropriate him for the Government's service. They'll call it by different names, but the horse goes all the same. I don't see how you're goin' to keep him till mornin'. You can't put him in your cellar. If they don't steal him, it's because it's too dark to see him. I'm sorry to say there's an awful lot o' thieves in the Army o' the Cumberland.\"  And Shorty looked very grieved over the deplorable lack of regard in the army for the rights of property. He seemed to mourn this way for several minutes, and then broke out with:  \"Say, Mr. Klegg, I've an idee. That Quartermaster o' the Maumee Muskrats is a sport from way back. He'd give his vary eyes for a good hoss--one that kin beat everybody else's. The way the horses are run down now this one kin carry a heavy handicap, and beat any one in camp. I'll bet I kin take this hoss over to him and git $150 in greenbacks for him, for he kin win a bushel o' money with him the very first day.\"  \"Shorty,\" said the Deacon, in a tone that made that worthy start, \"necessity and the stress o' circumstances may force me to do many things which are agin my conscience, and for which I shall repent in sackcloth and ashes, if needs be, but I hain't yit bin reduced to sellin' stolen property. The Lord save me from that. That hoss and wagon's got to go back to the owner, if I risk my life in takin' 'em.\"  Shorty wisely kept his reply to himself, but he thought how absurd it was to have men about the army who were too old and set in their ideas to learn army ways. He muttered to himself:  \"If he succeeds in gittin' that hoss outen camp agin, I'll expect to see the back o' my neck, or something else quite as wonderful.\"  The Deacon finally succeeded in getting a couple of ears of corn and a handful of fodder for the horse's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31775"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 5 (#3)"],["body","supper, and it was decided that Shorty should watch him the first part of the night, and the Deacon from thence till morning.  As the Deacon pondered over the matter in the early morning hours, he saw that his only chance of getting the horse back was to start with him before daylight revealed him to the men in camp.  [Illustration: WELL, I'LL BE DUMBED, MUTTERED THE DEACON. 35]  \"I'll drive him well outside our lines, and as near to the house as I think it prudent to go, and then turn him loose,\" he said to himself. \"If he's got the sense o' the horses up North he'll go straight home, and then my conscience will be clear. If he don't, I'll have done all I could. The Lord don't ask unreasonable things of us, even in atonement.\"  So he cooked as good a breakfast for the boys as he could prepare from his materials, woke up Shorty and put him in charge, and an hour before daybreak turned the horse's head toward the pontoon bridge, and started him on a lively trot.  He had only fairly started when a stern voice called out to him from a large tent:  \"Here, you, stop that trotting. What do you mean? Don't you know that it's strictly against orders to trot horses in their present condition?\"  \"Excuse me. Captain,\" said the Deacon. \"I\"  \"Blank your Captain,\" roared the voice; \"I'm no Captain.\"  \"Major,\" said the Deacon deprecatingly.  \"To thunder with your Majors, you ignorant fool. You\"  \"I beg your pardon, Colonel. I was\"  \"What's the matter with you, you ignoramus?\" roared the voice, more indignantly than ever. \"Don't you know Brigade Headquarters when you see them? Don't you know your own officers when you hear their voices?\"  \"Rayly, General,\" said the Deacon, much disturbed, \"I didn't mean to insult you. I'm only a citizen, and a stranger in the camp, and--\"  \"A citizen and a stranger,\" echoed the voice. \"What are you doing in here, anyway? Orderly, bring that man in here till I see him.\"  The Orderly started to obey, when a regiment which had been ordered to report at Headquarters came up at quick step, halted, and ordered arms with much clatter. The frightened horse bounded off down the road, with the Deacon sawing on the lines and trying to stop him.  He only slowed down when he came up near a corral of other horses, to which he turned for companionship and sympathy.  \"Frosty mornin' makes that hoss purty frisky,\" said the Deacon, as he readjusted his hat, and got himself in shape after his jolting. \"Lucky, though. I didn't like that old General's voice. I'm afraid he had it in for me, and would 've made me trouble for lowerin' his dignity by callin' him Captain. Big officers are awfully tetchy.\"  \"Here, who are you? And what are you doin' out there?\" came the stem inquiry from the dark depths of one of the sheds.  \"Excuse me. General,\" answered the Deacon hastily, \"I\"  \"General? Who are you callin' General, you fool? Don't try to be funny with me. You know I'm no General.\"  \"I meant Colonel,\" the Deacon started to explain.  \"The blazes you did. You expect Colonels to run hoss-corrals, and manage mule boarding-houses, do you? stop your blimmed nonsense and answer my questions.\"  \"Major, I was tryin' to say\"  \"I'll Major you when I git my boots on and git out there. Don't think to shut my eye up callin' me big titles.\"  \"But, Captain.\"  \"I'm no Captain, neither. I'm plain Jim Crimmins, Quartermaster-Sergeant, in charge o' this corral, that you're stealin' around. I'm comin' out there to break every bone in your body. You infernal sneaks 've pestered the life out o' me stealin' my corn and my mules, even. I've bin watchin' you piroutin' around in the dark for a long time. I'm goin' to stop this business if I've got to kill every thievin' varmint in the Army o' the Cumberland. Don't you dare move till I come out, or I'll put a bullet through you. Do you hear?\"  \"I don't believe I've got any more time to waste on that bellerin' bull-calf,\" said the Deacon to himself. He gathered up the lines, turned the horse's head toward the road, and gave him a lick with a switch, and he dashed off, followed by a couple of shots from Mr. Crimmins, to give color and confirmation to the story that worthy related later in the day of a particularly audacious attempt on the part of sneak thieves to get away with his mules and corn, and which was frustrated by his vigilance and daring.  As the horse slowed down to a walk again a Sergeant of the Guard at the head of a squad stepped out and took him by the reins.  \"Here, who are you, and where are you going so early in the morning?\" he inquired.  \"My name's Josiah Klegg, sir,\" said the Deacon, prudently ignoring titles. \"I'm from Injianny, and am down here 'tendin' to my son, who belongs to Co. Q, 200th Injianny Volunteers, and who was shot at Chickamaugy. I borryed this hoss and wagon from a man out in the country to bring in some vittles for him and his pardner, and some boughs for 'em to sleep on, and I'm takin' 'em back to him.\"  \"Well, that story may be true, and it mayn't. Probably it ain't. Men don't get up before daybreak to take back borrowed horses. You're up to some devilment; probably taking information or contraband out to the rebels. I haven't time now to investigate. I'll put you under guard until I have. As for the horse, we've got use for him. McCook's Cavalry needs about a thousand such as he. We're out lookin' for horses now. Unhitch him, boys.\"  The Deacon started to make an earnest protest, but at that moment the rebels on Lookout Mountain made their usual daylight salute to the camp. The size of the squad had attracted their attention, and a shell shrieked over and struck quite near. This was too much for the nervous horse. He made a convulsive leap, which scattered the guards around him and almost threw the Deacon out of the seat. When the latter recovered himself, and got the horse under control again the guards were far away, and he was at the approach to the pontoon bridge.  \"I'll be plagued,\" mused the Deacon, as the horse moved over the bridge at a slow walk, and gave him time to think, \"the army's a terrible place. I had no sort o' trouble when I was doin' something that mebbe I oughtn't to have done, but the minute I start out to do a right thing I meet no end o' difficulties. But these are the obstacles that Satan always puts in the way of the righteous. I'm goin' to git this boss 'back to its owner, or know the reason why. Git up, there.\"  He soon came to a piece of the road which was in full view of the rebels on Lookout Mountain. They had been preparing the day before to stop all travel by that route, and the Deacon's was the first vehicle that had appeared since they had got their guns planted. They waited until he was fairly out into the open, and sent a shell which struck a panel of the fence off to the left, burst with a crash, and sent rails, chunks, stones and pieces of brush flying through the air. The horse became frantic, and tore up the hill at such a rate the buckboard and harness speedily went to pieces, and the Deacon was flung in the ditch, while the horse galloped wildly over the hill.  The Union artillerymen on Moccasin Point had evidently anticipated just such an attempt on the part of the rebels. Instantly a score of guns which had been placed to cover that spot thundered out, and their shells could be seen striking and tearing up the ground all around where the shot came from. Other rebel guns came to the assistance of the first one; the Union batteries within reach started in to help their side, and in a minute the whole country was shaking with the uproar.  \"Well, I'll be dumbed,\" muttered the Deacon, crawling out of the ditch, shaking himself together again, cleaning off the mud, and trying to comprehend what was happening. \"Did anybody ever see sich a commotion kicked up over one four-year-old hoss, and not a particularly good hoss at that? 't'd take a mighty smart man to git as much as $100 for him up in Posey County. Nobody but a Methodist Elder could do it. I've sold a better hoss than that for $80, and got all he was worth.\"  He stood for a few minutes and looked at the grand display until the Union batteries, satisfied that they had finally quashed the impudent rebel, ceased firing, and then he looked around.  \"Well, that buckboard's done for. I can't take it back. It's only good for kindlin' wood now. But I may ketch the hoss and take him back.\"  He went up on top of the hill, and saw the horse standing under a tree, apparently pondering over what had happened, and wondering whether he should run farther or remain where he was.  The horse gave him a glad whinney of recognition, as if congratulating him on escaping from the crash of matter.  \"Yes, you beast,\" snorted the Deacon; \"I'm safe, but no thanks to you. You done your best to kick my brains out. Twice your condemned heels jest grazed my eyebrows. All the thanks I git for tryin' to save you from being starved to death there in Chattanoogy, and git you back home. But you go back home all the same.\"  He led the horse to a rock, mounted him, and started up the road. He reached the point where the road to the house turned off, and was debating whether he should go farther or turn the horse loose there, when he saw a company of cavalry coming up the main road from the other direction--that toward Bridgeport. Though they wore blue overcoats, he had learned enough about army life to not trust this implicitly, so he prudently rode into the woods to watch them until he could make sure. The company came up to where the roads parted, and he overheard a man who rode by the Captain at the head, and who wore a semi-soldier costume and seemed to be a scout or guide, tell the Captain:  \"Their camp's right over there on that ridge (pointing to the crest on which the Deacon had seen the smoke). They're probably on the lookout for us, and we'll have to be very careful if we get near enough to jump them. I thought I saw one of their lookouts about here when we came up. Yes, there he is "]]]
