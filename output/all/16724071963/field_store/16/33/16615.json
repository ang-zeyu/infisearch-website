Measurably justified, in my opinion, is the plan of the old opera, which concentrated and musically rounded out the passions aroused by a moving dramatic scene in a piece of set form (the aria). _Word_ and stage-play conveyed the dramatic progress of the action, followed more or less meagrely by musical recitative; arrived at the point of rest, music resumed the reins. This is less extrinsic than some would now have us believe. On the other hand, it was the ossified form of the \"aria\" itself which led to inveracity of expression and decadence.                             *       *       *  THE audible presentation, the \"performance,\" of music, its _emotional interpretation_, derives from those free heights whence descended the Art itself. Where the art is threatened by earthliness, it is the part of interpretation to raise it and reëndow it with its primordial essence.  Notation, the writing out of compositions, is primarily an ingenious expedient for catching an inspiration, with the purpose of exploiting it later. But notation is to improvisation as the portrait to the living model. It is for the interpreter to _resolve the rigidity of the signs_ into the primitive emotion.  But the lawgivers require the interpreter to reproduce the rigidity of the signs; they consider his reproduction the nearer to perfection, the more closely it clings to the signs.--  What the composer's inspiration _necessarily_ loses[H] through notation, his interpreter should restore by his own.    [H] How strongly notation influences style in music, and fetters   imagination, how \"form\" grew up out of it and from form arose   \"conventionalism\" in expression, is shown very convincingly and   avenges itself in tragic wise in E. T. A. Hoffmann, who occurs to me   here as a typical example.    This remarkable man's mental conceptions, lost in visionary moods   and revelling in transcendentalism, as his writings set forth in oft   inimitable fashion, must naturally--so one would infer--have found in   the dreamlike and transcendental art of tones a language and mode of   expression peculiarly congenial.    The veil of mysticism, the secret harmonies of Nature, the thrill of   the supernatural, the twilight vagueness of the borderland of dreams,   everything, in fact, which he so effectively limned with the precision   of _words_--all this, one would suppose, he could have interpreted to   fullest effect by the aid of music. And yet, comparing Hoffmann's best   musical work with the weakest of his literary productions, you will   discover to your sorrow how a conventional system of measures, periods   and keys--whereto the hackneyed opera-style of the time adds its   share--could turn a poet into a Philistine. But that his fancy   cherished another ideal of music, we learn from many, and frequently   admirable, observations of Hoffmann the _littérateur_.  To the lawgivers, the signs themselves are the most important matter, and are continually growing in their estimation; the new art of music is derived from the old signs--_and these now stand for musical art itself_.  If the lawgivers had their way, any given composition would always be reproduced in precisely the same tempo, whensoever, by whomsoever, and under whatsoever conditions it might be performed.  But, it _is_ not possible; the buoyant, expansive nature of the divine child rebels--it demands the opposite. Each day begins differently from the preceding, yet always with the flush of dawn.--Great artists play their own works differently at each repetition, remodel them on the spur of the moment, accelerate and retard, in a way which they could not indicate by signs--and always according to the given conditions of that \"eternal harmony.\"  And then the lawgiver chafes, and refers the creator to his own handwriting. As matters stand to-day, the lawgiver has the best of the argument.                             *       *       *  \"Notation\" (\"writing down\") brings up the subject of Transcription, nowadays a term much misunderstood, almost discreditable. The frequent antagonism which I have excited with \"transcriptions,\" and the opposition to which an ofttimes irrational criticism has provoked me, caused me to seek a clear understanding of this point. My final conclusion concerning it is this: Every notation is, in itself, the transcription of an abstract idea. The instant the pen seizes it, the idea loses its original form. The very intention to write down the idea, compels a choice of measure and key. The form, and the musical agency, which the composer must decide upon, still more closely define the way and the limits.  It is much the same as with man himself. Born naked, and as yet without definite aspirations, he decides, or at a given moment is made to decide, upon a career. From the moment of decision, although much that is original and imperishable in the idea or the man may live on, either is depressed to the type of a class. The musical idea becomes a sonata or a concerto; the man, a soldier or a priest. That is an Arrangement of the original. From this first transcription to a second the step is comparatively short and unimportant. And yet it is only the second, in general, of which any notice is taken; overlooking the fact, that a transcription does not destroy the archetype, which is, therefore, not lost through transcription.  Again, the performance of a work is also a transcription, and still, whatever liberties it may take, it can never annihilate the original.  For the musical art-work exists, before its tones resound and after they die away, _complete and intact_. It exists both within and outside of time, and through its nature we can obtain a definite conception of the otherwise intangible notion of the Ideality of Time.  For the rest, most of Beethoven's piano compositions sound like transcriptions of orchestral works; most of Schumann's orchestral compositions, like arrangements from pieces for the piano--and they are so, in a way.                             *       *       *  Strangely enough, the Variation-Form is highly esteemed by the Worshippers of the Letter. That is singular; for the variation-form--when built up on a borrowed theme--produces a _whole series of \"arrangements\"_ which, besides, are least respectful when most ingenious.  So the arrangement is _not_ good, because it _varies_ the original; and the variation _is_ good, although it \"_arranges_\" the original.                             *       *       *  THE term \"musikalisch\" (musical) is used by the Germans in a sense foreign to that in which any other language employs it.[I] It is a conception belonging to the Germans, and not to culture in general; the expression is incorrect and untranslatable. \"Musical\" is derived from _music_, like \"poetical\" from _poetry_, or \"physical\" from _physic(s)_. When I say, \"Schubert was one of the most musical among men,\" it is the same as if I should say, \"Helmholtz was one of the most physical among men.\" That is musical, which _sounds_ in rhythms and intervals. A cupboard can be \"musical,\" if \"music-works\" be enclosed in it.[J] In a comparative sense, \"musical\" may have the further signification of \"euphonious.\"--\"My verses are too musical to bear setting to music,\" a noted poet once remarked to me.    [I] The author probably had in mind the languages of southern Europe;   the word is employed in English, and in the tongues of the   Scandinavian group, with precisely the same meaning as in German.   [Translator's Note.]    [J] The only kind of people one might properly call _musical_, are the   singers; for they themselves can sound. Similarly, a clown who by some   trick produces tones when he is touched, might be called a   _pseudo-musical_ person.      \"Spirits moving musically      To a lute's well-tuned law,\"  writes Edgar Allan Poe. Lastly, one may speak quite correctly of \"musical laughter,\" because it _sounds_ like music.  Taking the signification in which the term is applied and almost exclusively employed in German, a musical person is one who manifests an inclination for music by a nice discrimination and sensitiveness with regard to the _technical aspects_ of the art. By \"technics\" I mean rhythm, harmony, intonation, part-leading, and the treatment of themes. The more subtleties he is capable of hearing or reproducing in these, the more \"musical\" he is held to be.  In view of the great importance attached to these elements of the art, this \"musical\" temperament has naturally become of the highest consequence. And so an artist who plays with perfect technical finish should be deemed the most musical player. But as we mean by \"technics\" only the mechanical mastery of the instrument, the terms \"technical\" and \"musical\" have been turned into opposites.  The matter has been carried so far as to call a composition itself \"musical,\"[K] or even to assert of a great composer like Berlioz that he was not sufficiently musical.[L] \"Unmusical\" conveys the strongest reproach; branded thus, its object becomes an outlaw.[M]    [K] \"But these pieces are so musical,\" a violinist once remarked to me   of a four-hand worklet which I had characterized as trivial.    [L] \"My dog is _very_ musical,\" I have heard said in all seriousness.   Should the dog take precedence of Berlioz?    [M] Such has been my own fate.  In a country like Italy, where all participate in the delights of music, this differentiation becomes superfluous, and the term corresponding is not found in the language. In France, where a living sense of music does not permeate the people, there are musicians and non-musicians; of the rest, some \"are very fond of music,\" and others \"do not care for it.\" Only in Germany is it made a point of honor to be \"musical,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31799"],["title","Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music (#3)"],["body","is to say, not merely to love music, but more especially to understand it as regards its technical means of expression, and to obey their rules.  A thousand hands support the buoyant child and solicitously attend its footsteps, that it may not soar aloft where there might be risk of a serious fall. But it is still so young, and is eternal; the day of its freedom will come.--When it shall cease to be \"musical.\"                             *       *       *  THE creator should take over no traditional law in blind belief, which would make him view his own creative endeavor, from the outset, as an exception contrasting with that law. For his individual case he should seek out and formulate a fitting individual law, which, after the first complete realization, he should annul, that he himself may not be drawn into repetitions when his next work shall be in the making.  The function of the creative artist consists in making laws, not in following laws ready made. He who follows such laws, ceases to be a creator.  Creative power may be the more readily recognized, the more it shakes itself loose from tradition. But an intentional avoidance of the rules cannot masquerade as creative power, and still less engender it.  The true creator strives, in reality, after _perfection_ only. And through bringing this into harmony with _his own_ individuality, a new law arises without premeditation.                             *       *       *  So narrow has our tonal range become, so stereotyped its form of expression, that nowadays there is not one familiar motive that cannot be fitted with some other familiar motive so that the two may be played simultaneously. Not to lose my way in trifling,[N] I shall refrain from giving examples.    [N] With a friend I once indulged in such trifling in order to   ascertain how many commonly known compositions were written according   to the scheme of the second theme in the Adagio of the Ninth Symphony.   In a few moments we had collected some fifteen analogues of the most   different kinds, among them specimens of the lowest type of art. And   Beethoven himself:--Is the theme of the Finale in the \"Fifth\" any   other than the one wherewith the \"Second\" introduces its Allegro?--or   than the principal theme of the Third Piano Concerto, only in minor?                             *       *       *  That which, within our present-day music, most nearly approaches the essential nature of the art, is the Rest and the Hold (Pause). Consummate players, improvisers, know how to employ these instruments of expression in loftier and ampler measure. The tense silence between two movements--_in itself music_, in this environment--leaves wider scope for divination than the more determinate, but therefore less elastic, sound.                             *       *       *  What we now call our Tonal System is nothing more than a set of \"signs\"; an ingenious device to grasp somewhat of that eternal harmony; a meagre pocket-edition of that encyclopedic work; artificial light instead of the sun.--Have you ever noticed how people gaze open-mouthed at the brilliant illumination of a hall? They never do so at the millionfold brighter sunshine of noonday.--  And so, in music, the signs have assumed greater consequence than that which they ought to stand for, and can only suggest.  How important, indeed, are \"Third,\" \"Fifth,\" and \"Octave\"! How strictly we divide \"consonances\" from \"dissonances\"--_in a sphere where no dissonances can possibly exist_!  We have divided the octave into twelve equidistant degrees, because we had to manage somehow, and have constructed our instruments in such a way that we can never get in above or below or between them. Keyboard instruments, in particular, have so thoroughly schooled our ears that we are no longer capable of hearing anything else--incapable of hearing except through this impure medium. Yet Nature created an _infinite gradation_--_infinite!_ who still knows it nowadays?[O]    [O] \"The equal temperament of 12 degrees, which was discussed   theoretically as early as about 1500, but not established as a   principle until shortly before 1700 (by Andreas Werkmeister),   divides the octave into twelve equal portions (semitones, hence   'twelve-semitone system') through which mean values are obtained;   no interval is perfectly pure, but all are fairly serviceable.\"   (Riemann, \"Musik-Lexikon.\") Thus, through Andreas Werkmeister, this   master-workman in art, we have gained the \"twelve-semitone\" system   with intervals which are all impure, but fairly serviceable. But what   is \"pure,\" and what \"impure\"? We hear a piano \"gone out of tune,\" and   whose intervals may thus have become \"pure, but unserviceable,\" and it   sounds _impure_ to us. The diplomatic \"Twelve-semitone system\" is an   invention mothered by necessity; yet none the less do we sedulously   guard its imperfections.  And within this duodecimal octave we have marked out a series of fixed intervals, seven in number, and founded thereon our entire art of music. What do I say--_one_ series? Two such series, one for each leg: The Major and Minor Scales. When we start this series of intervals on some other degree of our semitonic ladder, we obtain a _new key_, and a \"foreign\" one, at that! How violently contracted a system arose from this initial confusion,[P] may be read in the law-books; we will not repeat it here.    [P] It is termed \"The Science of Harmony.\"                             *       *       *  We teach four-and-twenty keys, twelve times the two Series of Seven; but, in point of fact, we have at our command only two, the major key and the minor key. _The rest are merely transpositions._ By means of the several transpositions we are supposed to get different shades of harmony; but this is an illusion. In England, under the reign of the high \"concert pitch,\" the most familiar works may be played a semitone higher than they are written, without changing their effect. Singers transpose an aria to suit their convenience, leaving untransposed what precedes and follows. Song-writers not infrequently publish their own compositions in three different pitches; in all three editions the pieces are precisely alike.  When a well-known face looks out of a window, it matters not whether it gazes down from the first story or the third.  Were it feasible to elevate or depress a landscape, far as eye can reach, by several hundred yards, the pictorial impression would neither gain nor lose by it.                             *       *       *  Upon the two Series of Seven, the major key and the minor key, the whole art of music has been established; one limitation brings on the other.  To each of these a definite character has been attributed; we have learned and have taught that they should be heard as contrasts, and they have gradually acquired the significance of symbols:--Major and Minor--Maggiore e Minore--Contentment and Discontent--Joy and Sorrow--Light and Shade. The harmonic symbols have fenced in the expression of music, from Bach to Wagner, and yet further on until to-day and the day after to-morrow. _Minor_ is employed with the same intention, and has the same effect upon us now, as two hundred years ago. Nowadays it is no longer possible to \"compose\" a funeral march, for it already exists, once for all. Even the least informed non-professional knows what to expect when a funeral march--whichever you please--is to be played. Even such an one can anticipate the difference between a symphony in major and one in minor. We are tyrannized by Major and Minor--by the bifurcated garment.                             *       *       *  Strange, that one should feel major and minor as opposites. They both present the same face, now more joyous, now more serious; and a mere touch of the brush suffices to turn the one into the other. The passage from either to the other is easy and imperceptible; when it occurs frequently and swiftly, the two begin to shimmer and coalesce indistinguishably.--But when we recognize that major and minor form one Whole with a double meaning, and that the \"four-and-twenty keys\" are simply an elevenfold transposition of the original twain, we arrive unconstrainedly at a perception of the UNITY _of our system of keys_ [tonality]. The conceptions of \"related\" and \"foreign\" keys vanish, and with them the entire intricate theory of degrees and relations. _We possess one single key._ But it is of most meagre sort.                             *       *       *  \"Unity of the key-system.\"  --\"I suppose you mean that 'key' and 'key-system' are the sunbeam and its diffraction into colors?\"  No; that I can not mean. For our whole system of tone, key, and tonality, taken in its entirety, is only a part of a fraction of one diffracted ray from that Sun, \"Music,\" in the empyrean of the \"eternal harmony.\"                             *       *       *  However deeply rooted the attachment to the habitual, and inertia, may be in the ways and nature of humankind, in equal measure are energy, and opposition to the existing order, characteristic of all that has life. Nature has her wiles, and persuades man, obstinately opposed though he be to progress and change; Nature progresses continually and changes unremittingly, but with so even and unnoticeable movement that men perceive only quiescence. Only on looking backward from a distance do they note with astonishment that they have been deceived.  The Reformer of any given period excites irritation for the reason that his changes find men unprepared, and, above all, because these changes are appreciable. The Reformer, in comparison with Nature, is undiplomatic; and, as a wholly logical consequence, his changes do not win general acceptance until Time, with subtle, imperceptible advance, has bridged over the leap of the self-assured leader. Yet we find cases in which the reformer marched abreast of the times, while the rest fell behind. And then they have to be"]]]
