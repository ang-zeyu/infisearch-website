A species which visits us in              the spring while en route to its more northern              nesting grounds, and in the fall when returning              to its winter home in the South. Most Transient              Visitants are found both in the spring and fall,              but some, like the Connecticut Warbler, are found              in the North Atlantic States only in the fall.      W.V.  Winter Visitant. A species which comes from the              North to remain with us all, or part of the winter              and then return to the North. Winter Visitants              may arrive in September and remain until April,              or they may come later and only for a brief stay.         *       *       *       *       *  NOTE.

Case 1. Figs. 1, 2_            The black and white markings of the male are           respectively buff and brown in the female. In           flight the Bob-white, or Quail, suggests a           Meadowlark, but the tail is without white           feathers. L. 10.            _Range._ Eastern United States north to Minnesota           and Maine south to the Gulf. A Permanent Resident.           Severe winters and much shooting have made it rare           in the more northern parts of its range.            Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, P.R. N. Ohio, not common P.R. Glen           Ellyn, rare P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.  Except when nesting Bob-whites live in flocks or \"coveys\" usually composed of the members of one family. Their song, heard in spring and summer, is the clear, ringing two- or three-noted whistle which gives them their common name. Their fall and winter notes, which sportsmen term \"scatter calls\" are signals by which the members of a flock keep within speaking distance of one another. \"_Where_ are you?\" \"_Where_ are you?\" they seem to say. As with other protectively colored, ground-inhabiting birds, Bob-whites do not take wing until one almost steps upon them. Then, like a bursting bomb, the covey seems to explode, its brown pieces flying in every direction. The nest is on the ground and the 10-18 white, pear-shaped eggs are laid in May or June.  The Florida Bob-white (_C. v. floridanus_, Case 3, Figs. 1, 2), a smaller darker race is resident in Florida, except in the northern part of the state. It begins to nest in April.     GROUSE. FAMILY TETRAONIDÆ   CANADA SPRUCE PARTRIDGE  _Canachites canadensis canace_            The male is a grayish bird with a jet black throat           and breast, the former bordered with white; the           skin above the eye is red. The female is barred           with black and reddish brown with a black mottled           tail tipped with brown. L. 15.            _Range._ Northern parts of United States from New           Brunswick to Manitoba. Other races are found           throughout the wooded parts of Canada and Alaska.  An unsuspicious inhabitant of swampy coniferous forests. Now rare in the United States. It nests on the ground in June, laying 9-16 eggs, buff, lightly speckled with brown.   RUFFED GROUSE  _Bonasa umbellus umbellus. Case 1, Fig. 3_            The female resembles the male in color but has the           black neck-tufts smaller. The tail-feathers vary           from gray to bright rusty. L. 17.            _Range._ Eastern United States south in the           Alleghanies to Georgia. In the southern states the           Grouse is often called 'Pheasant.' A Permanent           Resident.            Washington, not common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, P.R., formerly very common. N. Ohio,           rare P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare and local P.R.  On our western plains and prairies there is a Grouse which we call Prairie Hen and we might well apply the name Wood Hen to this Grouse of our forests. To flush a Grouse in the quiet of the woods always makes the \"heart jump.\" His whirring wings not only produce the roar which accompanies his flight, but they are also responsible for the \"drumming\" which constitutes the Grouse's song as sitting upright on some favorite log, he rapidly beats the air with his wings.  The horny fringes which in winter border the toes of the Grouse, or Partridge, as he is also called, form in effect snow-shoes which help to support the bird on soft snow. At this season they also feed in trees on buds and catkins, and they may roost in trees or seek a bed by plunging into a snow-bank.  The nest, lined with leaves, is placed at the base of a tree or stump; the 8-14 buffy eggs are laid in May.  The Canada Ruffed Grouse (_B. u. togata_), of northern New England and northwards is grayer above and more distinctly barred below.   PRAIRIE CHICKEN  _Tympanuchus americanus_            The Prairie Hen has a rounded or nearly square           tail and a barred breast; in the Sharp-tailed           Grouse the tail is pointed, the breast with           V-shaped markings. L. 18.            _Range._ Central Plains region from Texas to           Manitoba, east to Indiana. Migratory at its           northern limits.            Glen Ellyn, P.R. local, S.E. Minn., P.R. much           decreased in numbers.  The Ruffed Grouse sounds his rolling, muffled drum-call in the seclusion of the forest, but the Prairie Hen beats his loud _boom-ah-boom_ in the open freedom of the plains. Hardy and strong of wing, he can cope with winter storms and natural enemies, but against the combined assault of man, dog, and gun, he cannot successfully contend.  About a dozen buff-olive eggs are laid on the ground in April or early May.   HEATH HEN  _Tympanuchus cupido_  This is a close relative of the Prairie Hen, having the black neck-tuft of less than ten feathers with pointed, not rounded, ends. It is now found only on the Island of Martha's Vineyard, but formerly inhabited plains or barrens, locally, from New Jersey to Massachusetts. It nests in June.     TURKEYS. FAMILY MELEAGRIDÆ   WILD TURKEY  _Meleagris gallopavo silvestris_            The Wild Turkey was formerly found as far north as           Maine and Ontario but it is unknown now north of           central Pennsylvania. South of Maryland it is not           uncommon locally.            _Range._ Kansas and central Pennsylvania to the           Gulf coast, and northern Florida. Non-migratory.            Washington, rare P.R.  Our domestic Turkey is descended from the Mexican Wild Turkey and like that race has the upper tail-coverts and tail tipped with whitish, whereas in our eastern Wild Turkey these tips are chestnut. The nest is on the ground and 10-14 eggs, pale cream-color finely speckled with brownish, are laid in April.  The Florida Wild Turkey (_M. g. osceola_), of southern Florida, is smaller and the white bars on the primaries are narrower and more broken.     PIGEONS AND DOVES. ORDER COLUMBÆ     PIGEONS AND DOVES. FAMILY COLUMBIDÆ   MOURNING DOVE  _Zenaidura macroura carolinensis. Case 3, Fig. 3; Case 5, Fig. 11_            Except the southern little Ground Dove, this is           our only Dove. Its long, pointed tail and the           swift, darting flight are its field characters. It           is often mistaken for the Wild or Passenger           Pigeon, now extinct. The two birds differ in size           and in color, but size is a matter of distance,           and color, of comparison, so it seems probable           that as long as there is a possibility of seeing a           Passenger Pigeon, Mourning Doves will be mistaken           for them. L. 11¾. The Wild Pigeon is about five           inches longer.            _Range._ North America. In a railway journey from           the Atlantic to the Pacific one may expect to see           the Dove daily. Winters from Virginia southward,           migrating northward in March.            Washington, P.R., common, except in midwinter.           Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 3-Nov. 27; a few           winter. Cambridge, rather rare T.V., Apl. 8-June           18; Sept. 18-Nov. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Mch.           20-Oct. 25; rare W.V. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common           S.R., formerly common, Mch. 12-Oct. 21. S.E.           Minn., common S.R., Mch. 15-Dec. 25.  Doves are particularly common in the southern states where, ranked as game-birds, they are shot in large numbers. The Wild Pigeon's note was an explosive squawk; the Dove's is a soft, mournful _coo-oo-ah, coo-o-o-coo-o-o-coo-o-o-_. During the winter, Doves are usually found in small flocks but, unlike the Wild Pigeon, they nest in scattered pairs. The nest is in a tree or on the ground. Two white eggs are laid in April.   GROUND DOVE  _Chæmepelia passerina terrestris. Case 3, Fig. 4_            The female is duller than the male. L. 6¾.            _Range._ Tropical and subtemperate parts of the           Western Hemisphere. Our form is found in Florida           and on the coast region from North Carolina to           Texas.            Washington, accidental; two records, Sept., Oct.  This dainty, miniature Pigeon is common in southern gardens and old fields. It runs gracefully before one, and when flushed rises with a whirring flight but soon alights, usually on the ground. Its call is a crooning _coo_. The nest is placed on the ground and in low trees and bushes. Two white eggs are laid in March.     BIRDS OF PREY. ORDER RAPTORES     AMERICAN VULTURES.

The 'Turkey Buzzard' has a wider wing-stretch and is a better aviator than the Black Vulture. It is more a bird of the country than the last-named species which is the common Vulture of the streets in many southern cities. Extremely graceful in the air, it is far from pleasing when at rest. The two dull white, brown-marked eggs are laid on the ground under logs, in crevices in rocks, etc., in March in Florida, in April in Virginia.   BLACK VULTURE  _Catharista urubu urubu. Case 3, Fig. 10_            Head black, plumage without the brownish cast of           the Turkey Vulture.            _Range._ Eastern U.S., north to Virginia; an           abundant Permanent Resident. Washington, casual,           Mch., July, Dec.  The Vulture of southern cities; a frequenter of slaughter houses and markets. In flight the under surfaces of the wing look silvery. It is by no means so impressive a figure in the air as the Turkey Vulture. Two pale bluish white eggs, generally with brown markings, are laid on the ground under logs, bushes, palmettoes, etc., in March and April.     HAWKS, EAGLES, KITES, ETC. FAMILY BUTEONIDÆ   SWALLOW-TAILED KITE  _Elanoides forficatus forficatus_            The head and lower parts are white, the rest of           the plumage glossy black; the tail deeply forked.           L. 24.            _Range._ Florida to South Carolina, and up the           Mississippi Valley rarely to Saskatchewan; winters           south of the United States, returning in March.            Washington, three records, Aug.; Apl. SE. Minn.,           uncommon S.R., May 4.  Color, form, grace, and power of motion combine to make the flight of the Swallow-tail an impressive demonstration of the bird's mastery of the air. It feeds on lizards and small snakes which it captures when on the wing from the branches of trees. The nest is placed in the upper branches of tall trees, 2-3 eggs heavily marked with brown being laid in Florida in April; in Iowa in June.   WHITE-TAILED KITE  _Elanus leucurus_            A gray bird with white underparts, rather short           white tail and black shoulders. L. 15½.            _Range._ Chiefly southwestern United States and           southward east to the lower Mississippi Valley.  This is a rare bird east of the Mississippi. It frequents open marshy places and feeds upon small snakes, lizards, grasshoppers, etc., which it captures on the ground. The nest is built in trees, and the 3-5 eggs, heavily marked with brown, are laid in May.   MISSISSIPPI KITE  _Ictinia mississippiensis_            A slaty-blue bird with black tail and wings and           red eyes. L. 14.            _Range._ Southern United States, north to South           Carolina, and southern Indiana; winters chiefly           south of the United States and returns in April.  A low-flying hunter of insects, snakes and frogs. It migrates in loose flocks sometimes near the earth, at others far above it. The nest is placed in tall trees. The eggs are laid in May; they number 1-3, and are dull white, occasionally with a bluish tinge.   EVERGLADE KITE  _Rostrhamus sociabilis_            A dark slate-colored bird with a white rump and a           rather slender hooked bill. The young are quite           different; black above, tipped with reddish brown,           below mottled and barred with black, reddish brown           and buff, but with the white rump-patch of the           adult. L. 18.            _Range._ Tropical America north to southern           Florida.  The Everglade Kite is found in marshes and about lakes and ponds hunting for its favorite food of large snails, which it extracts from their shells by means of its hooked bill. It is rarely seen north of southern Florida. The nest is placed in bushes or among reeds. The 2-3 eggs, which are heavily marked with brown, are laid in March.   MARSH HAWK  _Circus hudsonius. Case 3, Fig. 15_            The immature bird and adult female are dark brown           above, reddish brown below, but, in any plumage,           the species may be known by the white upper           tail-coverts which show clearly in flight. L.,           male, 19; female, 22.            _Range._ North America, wintering from New Jersey           southward; migrates northward in March.            Washington, common W.V., July-Apl. Ossining,           tolerably common S.R., Mch. 6-Oct. 30; a few           winter. Cambridge, common T.V., Mch. 20-Nov. 10,           one breeding record. N. Ohio, not common S.R.,           Mch. 5-Nov. 30. Glen Ellyn, S.R., several pairs,           Apl. 4-Nov. 6. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 6-Nov.           1.  The Marsh Hawk quarters low over the fields turning sharply here and there to follow the course of a meadow mouse in the grass forest below. As a rule the bird is silent but in the mating season he repeats a 'screeching' note. The nest is made on the ground in the marshes; the 4-6 white eggs are laid in May.   SHARP-SHINNED HAWK  _Accipiter velox. Case 1, Figs. 11, 12; Case 3, Figs. 7, 8_            The sexes differ only in size, the female being           much the larger. There is a marked difference in           color between adult and immature birds, the latter           being more commonly seen. L. male, 11¼; female,           13½.            _Range._ North America; wintering from           Massachusetts southward.            Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.           Cambridge, common T.V., Apl. 3-May 11; Sept.           5-Oct. 25; rare S.R., uncommon W.V. N. Ohio, not           common P.R., a few winter. Glen Ellyn, not common           S.R., Mch. 19-Dec. 9. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch.           28-Dec 28.  This small, bird-killing Hawk dashes recklessly after its victims, following them through thick cover. It is less often seen in the open than the Sparrow Hawk, which it resembles in size, but from which it may be known by its different color, longer tail, and much shorter wings. It nests in trees 15-40 feet from the ground. The eggs, 3-6 in number, are bluish white or cream, marked with brown and are laid in May.  [Illustration: SHARP-SHINNED HAWK.  Note the Long Tail.]   COOPER'S HAWK  _Accipiter cooperi. Case 1, Figs. 9, 10_            A large edition of the Sharp-shinned Hawk, with           the tail more rounded, the adult with a darker           crown. L. male, 15½; female, 19.            _Range._ Nests throughout United States; winters           from southern New England southward.            Washington, common S.R., less common W.V.           Ossining, tolerably common P.R. Cambridge, common           T.V., not uncommon S.R., rare W.V., Apl. 10-Oct.           20. N. Ohio, not common, Mch. 20-Nov. 1; a few           winter. Glen Ellyn, local S.R., a few winter. SE.           Minn., common S.R., Mch. 3.  This is the real 'Chicken Hawk,' but it is less often seen and heard than the soaring, screaming Buteos to which the name is usually applied. It resembles the Sharp-shinned in habits but being larger may prey on larger birds. The female may be easily distinguished from the Sharp-shinned by her larger size, but the male is not appreciably larger than a female Sharp-shin.  The nest is built in a tree 25-50 feet up. The bluish white, rarely spotted eggs are laid in late April or early May.   GOSHAWK  _Astur atricapillus_            The adult is blue-gray above with a darker crown           and a white line over the eye. The underparts are           finely and beautifully marked with gray and white.           Young birds resemble the young of Cooper's Hawk,           but are much larger. L., male, 22; female, 24.            _Range._ North America, nests chiefly north of the           United States and winters southward, usually           rarely, as far as Virginia.            Washington, casual in winter. Ossining, rare W.V.,           Oct. 10-Jan. 14. Cambridge, irregular and uncommon           W.V. SE. Minn., W.R., Nov. 5-Apl. 4.  Like its smaller relatives the Sharp-shin and Cooper's Hawks, this powerful raptor is a relentless hunter of birds. It is particularly destructive to Ruffed Grouse. Fortunately it does not often visit us in numbers. It nests in trees, laying 2-5 white eggs, rarely marked with brownish, in April.   RED-TAILED HAWK  _Buteo borealis borealis. Case 1, Figs. 5, 6; Case 3, Fig. 13._            This, the largest of our common Hawks, is a           heavy-bodied bird with wings which when closed,           reach nearly to the end of the tail. The adult has           the tail bright reddish brown with a narrow black           band near the tip. The immature bird has the tail           rather inconspicuously barred with blackish, and a           broken band of blackish spots across the           underparts. L. male, 20; female, 23.            _Range._ Eastern North America, migrating only at           the northern limit of its range. There are several           races, Krider's Red-tail, a paler form inhabiting           the great Plains, and Harlan's Hawk, a darker form           with a mottled tail, the lower Mississippi Valley.            Washington, common W.V., rare S.R. Ossining,           common P.R., less common in winter. Cambridge,           rare T.V., locally W.V., Oct. 10-Apl. 20. N. Ohio,           common P.R. Glen Ellyn, P.R., not common, chiefly           T.V. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 2.  The Red-tail resembles the Red-shoulder in general habits, but it is more a bird of the fields, where it may be seen perched on the limb of a dead tree or similar exposed situation. Its note, a long-drawn, squealing whistle, is quite unlike that of the Red-shoulder. The Red-tail"]]]
