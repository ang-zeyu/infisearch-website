Answer the questions I ask you, and I promise that you will not be treated as spies. I also promise you that you will be made comfortable until arrangements can be made to send you home. Now!\"  \"What are the questions?\" Freddy asked.  The stern look fled the German's face, and he smiled.  \"Ah, that is better!\" he said and spread the map on the desk. \"Now, here you have marked a line showing the route you traveled from Paris. Each town you passed through is marked. Those towns are French troop and equipment garrisons. This town here, close to the Belgian border, what did you see there? French troops? British troops? And what was their equipment? Tanks? Big ones, or small ones? Were there motorized anti-aircraft batteries? Were...?\"  The German suddenly stopped and looked up from the map.  \"You are not listening?\" he said softly.  Freddy's face seemed actually to grow thin as Dave looked at him. The English boy licked his lips just once and then put his shoulders back a little more.  \"Certainly I'm listening,\" he said. \"But I won't answer a single one of your questions even though you do shoot me!\"  Dave felt like throwing his arms about young Farmer and hugging him. Here was the kind of cool, calm courage for which the British were famous the world over. Instead, Dave turned his head and looked at the German.  \"We're not saying a thing!\" he shouted. \"I demand that we be permitted to see the nearest American Consul!\"  The German officer ignored Dave's outburst as though he had not spoken. He looked steadily at Freddy for a moment and then sighed heavily and raised both hands in a gesture of despair.  \"Very well,\" he said. \"That is all for now. I will give you until tomorrow morning to think it over ... and change your mind. Guard!\"  The side door popped open and in popped the guard. Colonel Stohl pointed a finger.  \"Take them back,\" he said, \"and stand guard outside the door. If either of them attempts to escape ... _shoot!_\"  The Colonel gave them an angry stare and a curt nod, and then busied himself with some papers on the desk. Two minutes later the boys were back in their prison room. The door was closed and bolted, and they could hear the boots of the guard pacing up and down the hallway outside. Freddy sat down on a cot and started to shiver violently. Dave went over to him instantly and put a friendly arm about his shoulders.  \"Steady, Freddy!\" he whispered. \"We'll get out somehow. He was only bluffing. He wouldn't dare shoot us. I'll make him let me see the nearest American Consul. I'll ... I'll make him let me telephone the American Ambassador in Brussels.\"  \"I hope you do for your sake, Dave,\" Freddy whispered. \"But England is at war, and I'm an Englishman. And, Dave ... that map was mine. I used it and marked my route until it got too dark.\"  Fingers of ice clutched at Dave's heart and pressed hard. He sucked air sharply into his lungs.  \"Holy smokes!\" he breathed. \"Then you did put down all that stuff he was talking about?\"  \"Oh no, not that!\" the English youth said and shook his head vigorously. \"I just penciled in the route I had taken until it got too dark. Besides, I lost my pencil when I tried to do it in the glow of the dash light. The rest of the things he must have marked in.\"  Dave gave a shake of his head and looked puzzled.  \"I don't get it!\" he murmured. \"Why?\"  \"Don't you see?\" Freddy said. \"It's really very simple, Dave. They did it to frighten me, to make me answer their questions. They'll hold a military court and use that map as evidence. There'll be an awful row. They'll make one, hoping to scare me into talking. I knew a Jewish boy in England who escaped with his family from the German Gestapo and he told me about the tricks they play to scare you into telling them things. That's what he plans to do with me. But, I won't tell him a thing, not a thing! It's my map all right, but they're not going to frighten me into telling anything that would hurt the Allies. They can't make me!\"  \"You bet they can't, pal!\" Dave said. \"And they won't get anything out of me, either.\"  \"I don't think he means any harm toward you, Dave,\" Freddy said after a long pause. \"You just insist on seeing the American Consul and I think he'll let you. When you spoke of your father's trip to London he seemed surprised. You're an American, Dave. You'll be all right.\"  \"But what about you, Freddy?\" Dave exclaimed.  \"I won't tell them a thing, no matter what they do,\" the English youth said determinedly. \"Never!\"  Dave started to speak, checked himself, and stepped back a pace.  \"So that's the kind of a pal you are, huh?\" he grunted. \"You just up and let me down!\"  Freddy jerked his head up in blank amazement. Tears were dangerously close to his eyes.  \"Let you down, Dave?\" he gasped. \"But, Dave...!\"  \"Sure, let me down,\" Dave snapped at him. \"I thought we were pals? I thought we were going to see this through together?\"  \"But, Dave, you...!\"  \"Me walk out and leave you behind?\" Dave interrupted the English youth's speech. \"Quit a pal just because I'm American and he's English? Not a chance. We're sticking together. You can't toss me off like that!\"  \"But I was only thinking of you, Dave,\" Freddy protested. \"After all I really got you into this, you know.\"  Dave suddenly stopped acting hurt and angry. He bent down and grinned broadly.  \"So what?\" he whispered. \"So I'll get you _out_. We've got until tomorrow morning to think things over. That's what he said. Well, we're not going to think things, we're going to _do_ things. Are you game, Freddy?\"  For an answer Freddy put out his hand, and the two clasped hands warmly. The color came back into the English youth's face, and that made Dave feel almost happy.  \"Okay, Freddy,\" he whispered. \"I saw something besides airplanes out the window awhile ago. Come over and I'll show you.\"  For a couple of seconds Dave stood still listening to the footsteps of the guard outside, then he motioned to Freddy and tiptoed over to the window.  \"Look out, and down,\" he breathed in Freddy's ear. \"See? The bottom half of this building sticks out. See the roof? It's not more than six feet below this window. And it's not more than ten feet from the edge of the roof to the back yard. Think you could jump it?\"  \"Easy!\" Freddy whispered. \"But what about this window, here? It's screwed in.\"  \"Got that all figured, too,\" Dave said and pulled an army canteen spoon from the pocket of the old clothes he wore. \"Swiped this from the breakfast tray,\" he said. \"A hunch made me stick it in my pocket. A spoon makes a swell screw driver sometimes. I found that out once when I was a kid. I used one of my Mother's to open an old chest I found up in the attic. I got a licking for it because I marked up the wood pretty bad. But the spoon did the trick. Now, here's what you do.\"  Dave paused and slipped the tip of the spoon handle into the groove of the nearest screw head and applied pressure with both hands. He turned the screw a sixteenth of an inch or so and then stopped.  \"Hot dog!\" he whispered. \"I was scared for a minute the darn things would be so rusted with age they wouldn't budge. But, it's okay. Now, you go over to the door and start talking to me. Talk about anything. Sure, let's talk about baseball.\"  \"But I don't know anything about baseball!\" Freddy whispered.  \"That's swell!\" Dave said. \"You can ask me questions and I'll give you the answers. But keep an ear open for that guard. If he starts to open the door you ask me, What's a home run? See? That'll give me time to get away from this window. Okay, got it?\"  \"Yes, I understand,\" Freddy said and nodded eagerly. \"Gee, you're a great friend, Dave!\"  \"You too, Freddy,\" Dave said and gave him a push. \"Now, get over there and start asking questions. Thank goodness this window is dirty and nobody can see me from outside.\"  The instant Freddy went over near the door Dave gave his attention to the first screw. The English youth asked question after question and Dave answered them without half thinking. Every second of the time he worked feverishly with the spoon on the screws. There were eight of them and he guessed it was well over an hour before he had seven of them out and the eighth well loosened. That one he let stay partly in so that the window would remain in place. The last thing he did was to cover the screw holes with bits of cobweb so they wouldn't be noticed. Then he walked over to the cot and sat down.  \"Okay, that's enough baseball talk!\" he said in a loud voice and winked at Freddy. \"Gee, how you can ask questions. Well, it looks like we're not going to get anything to eat. So I'm going to try and get some sleep.\"  Stretching out on the cot Dave pointed at the window and grinned. Then clasping his hands together he put them over his head and shook them like a prize fighter being introduced to the fight fans. Freddy looked puzzled for a moment, then realized what Dave meant, and went through the hand-shaking motions himself.  \"Well, I guess I might as well try to get a little sleep, myself,\" he said loudly and walked to the other cot.  A moment later the two boys listened to the sound of the guard's footsteps outside and looked at the gradually fading light of day outside the dust and cobweb smeared window.     CHAPTER EIGHT  _Escape!_   Somewhere in the distance a church clock tolled the hour of ten. Dave absently counted the strokes, and then slowly sat up on the army cot. All was pitch dark inside as well as outside. For a couple of minutes he sat perfectly still listening to the various sounds that came to him faintly. He heard the guard outside in the hallway cough and then strike a match. He heard the muffled sounds of hobnailed boots marching along in the street outside, and the clanking sound of tank and scout car tractor treads on the stones. Somewhere in the distance a whistle was blown. He heard the occasional dull boom of heavy guns, or of bombs exploding. And once a flight of planes droned "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32447"],["title","The Thing in the Attic (#0)"],["body","THING IN THE ATTIC                             By James Blish                        Illustrated by Paul Orban  [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from If Worlds of Science Fiction July 1954.

Therefore did they make men      to live always in the air and in the sunlight, and in the light of      the stars, that he would be reminded of them.

And thereafter they departed to the far stars,      saying, Take this world as your own, and though we shall return,      fear not, for it is yours._       --THE BOOK OF LAWS   Honath the Pursemaker was hauled from the nets an hour before the rest of the prisoners, as befitted his role as the arch-doubter of them all. It was not yet dawn, but his captors led him in great bounds through the endless, musky-perfumed orchid gardens, small dark shapes with crooked legs, hunched shoulders, slim hairless tails carried, like his, in concentric spirals wound clockwise. Behind them sprang Honath on the end of a long tether, timing his leaps by theirs, since any slip would hang him summarily.  He would of course be on his way to the surface, some 250 feet below the orchid gardens, shortly after dawn in any event. But not even the arch-doubter of them all wanted to begin the trip--not even at the merciful snap-spine end of a tether--a moment before the law said, Go.  The looping, interwoven network of vines beneath them, each cable as thick through as a man's body, bellied out and down sharply as the leapers reached the edge of the fern-tree forest which surrounded the copse of fan-palms. The whole party stopped before beginning the descent and looked eastward, across the dim bowl. The stars were paling more and more rapidly; only the bright constellation of the Parrot could still be picked out without doubt.  \"A fine day,\" one of the guards said, conversationally. \"Better to go below on a sunny day than in the rain, pursemaker.\"  Honath shuddered and said nothing. Of course it was always raining down below in Hell, that much could be seen by a child. Even on sunny days, the endless pinpoint rain of transpiration, from the hundred million leaves of the eternal trees, hazed the forest air and soaked the black bog forever.  He looked around in the brightening, misty morning. The eastern horizon was black against the limb of the great red sun, which had already risen about a third of its diameter; it was almost time for the small, blue-white, furiously hot consort to follow. All the way to that brink, as to every other horizon, the woven ocean of the treetops flowed gently in long, unbreaking waves, featureless as some smooth oil. Only nearby could the eye break that ocean into its details, into the world as it was: a great, many-tiered network, thickly overgrown with small ferns, with air-drinking orchids, with a thousand varieties of fungi sprouting wherever vine crossed vine and collected a little humus for them, with the vivid parasites sucking sap from the vines, the trees, and even each other. In the ponds of rain-water collected by the closely fitting leaves of the bromeliads tree-toads and peepers stopped down their hoarse songs dubiously as the light grew and fell silent one by one. In the trees below the world, the tentative morning screeches of the lizard-birds--the souls of the damned, or the devils who hunted them, no one was quite sure which--took up the concert.  A small gust of wind whipped out of the hollow above the glade of fan-palms, making the network under the party shift slightly, as if in a loom. Honath gave with it easily, automatically, but one of the smaller vines toward which he had moved one furless hand hissed at him and went pouring away into the darkness beneath--a chlorophyll-green snake, come up out of the dripping aerial pathways in which it hunted in ancestral gloom, to greet the suns and dry its scales in the quiet morning. Farther below, an astonished monkey, routed out of its bed by the disgusted serpent, sprang into another tree, reeling off ten mortal insults, one after the other, while still in mid-leap. The snake, of course, paid no attention, since it did not speak the language of men; but the party on the edge of the glade of fan-palms snickered appreciatively.  \"Bad language they favor below,\" another of the guards said. \"A fit place for you and your blasphemers, pursemaker. Come now.\"  The tether at Honath's neck twitched, and then his captors were soaring in zig-zag bounds down into the hollow toward the Judgment Seat. He followed, since he had no choice, the tether threatening constantly to foul his arms, legs or tail, and--worse, far worse--making his every mortifying movement ungraceful. Above, the Parrot's starry plumes flickered and faded into the general blue.  Toward the center of the saucer above the grove, the stitched leaf-and-leather houses clustered thickly, bound to the vines themselves, or hanging from an occasional branch too high or too slender to bear the vines. Many of these purses Honath knew well, not only as visitor but as artisan. The finest of them, the inverted flowers which opened automatically as the morning dew bathed them, yet which could be closed tightly and safely around their occupants at dusk by a single draw-string, were his own design as well as his own handiwork. They had been widely admired and imitated.  The reputation that they had given him, too, had helped to bring him to the end of the snap-spine tether. They had given weight to his words among others--weight enough to make him, at last, the arch-doubter, the man who leads the young into blasphemy, the man who questions the Book of Laws.  And they had probably helped to win him his passage on the Elevator to Hell.  The purses were already opening as the party swung among them. Here and there, sleepy faces blinked out from amid the exfoliating sections, criss-crossed by relaxing lengths of dew-soaked rawhide. Some of the awakening householders recognized Honath, of that he was sure, but none came out to follow the party--though the villagers should be beginning to drop from the hearts of their stitched flowers like ripe seed-pods by this hour of any normal day.  A Judgment was at hand, and they knew it--and even those who had slept the night in one of Honath's finest houses would not speak for him now. Everyone knew, after all, that Honath did not believe in the Giants.  Honath could see the Judgment Seat itself now, a slung chair of woven cane crowned along the back with a row of gigantic mottled orchids. These had supposedly been transplanted there when the chair was made, but no one could remember how old they were; since there were no seasons, there was no particular reason why they should not have been there forever. The Seat itself was at the back of the arena and high above it, but in the gathering light Honath could make out the white-furred face of the Tribal Spokesman, like a lone silver-and-black pansy among the huge vivid blooms.  At the center of the arena proper was the Elevator itself. Honath had seen it often enough, and had himself witnessed Judgments where it was called into use, but he could still hardly believe that he was almost surely to be its next passenger. It consisted of nothing more than a large basket, deep enough so that one would have to leap out of it, and rimmed with thorns to prevent one from leaping back in. Three hempen ropes were tied to its rim, and were then cunningly interwound on a single-drum windlass of wood, which could be turned by two men even when the basket was loaded.  The procedure was equally simple. The condemned man was forced into the basket, and the basket lowered out of sight, until the slackening of the ropes indicated that it had touched the surface. The victim climbed out--and if he did not, the basket remained below until he starved or until Hell otherwise took care of its own--and the windlass was rewound.  The sentences were for varying periods of time, according to the severity of the crime, but in practical terms this formality was empty. Although the basket was dutifully lowered when the sentence had expired, no one had ever been known to get back into it. Of course, in a world without seasons or moons, and hence without any but an arbitrary year, long periods of time are not easy to count accurately. The basket could arrive thirty or forty days to one side or the other of the proper date. But this was only a technicality, however, for if keeping time was difficult in the attic world it was probably impossible in Hell.  Honath's guards tied the free end of his tether to a branch and settled down around him. One abstractedly passed a pine cone to him and he tried to occupy his mind with the business of picking the juicy seeds from it, but somehow they had no flavor.  More captives were being brought in now, while the Spokesman watched with glittering black eyes from his high perch. There was Mathild the Forager, shivering as if with ague, the fur down her left side glistening and spiky, as though she had inadvertently overturned a tank plant on herself. After her was brought Alaskon the Navigator, a middle-aged man only a few years younger than Honath himself; he was tied up next to Honath, where he settled down at once, chewing at a joint of cane with apparent indifference."]]]
