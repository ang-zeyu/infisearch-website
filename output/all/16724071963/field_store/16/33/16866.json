The only thing dead in here is my appetite. Weightlessness doesn't let you become very hungry.\"  \"You'll grow used to it,\" the guard promised. He patted his paunch happily. \"I am. Well, don't raise the alarm unless there's some trouble. Remember about the boy who cried wolf.\"  \"Of course,\" said Temple. \"Sure. Sorry.\"  He watched the guard depart.  \"Bad dream?\" Arkalion wanted to know.  \"Bad dream, my foot. I accidentally hit you. Hard enough to hurt. You didn't move.\"  \"I'm a sound sleeper.\"  \"I felt for your heart. It wasn't beating. It wasn't!\"  \"Oh, come, come.\"  \"Your heart was not beating, I said.\"  \"And I suppose I was cold as a slab of ice?\"  \"Umm, no. I don't remember. Maybe you were. You had no pulse, either.\"  Arkalion laughed easily. \"And am I still dead?\"  \"Well--\"  \"Clearly a case of overwrought nerves and a highly keyed imagination. What you need is some more sleep.\"  \"I'm not sleepy, thanks.\"  \"Well, I think I'll get up and go down for breakfast.\" Arkalion climbed out of bed gingerly, made his way to the sink and was soon gargling with a bottle of prepared mouthwash, occasionally spraying weightless droplets of the pink liquid up at the ceiling.  Temple lit a cigarette with shaking fingers, made his way to Arkalion's bed while the man hummed tunelessly at the sink. Temple let his hands fall on the sheet. It was not cold, but comfortably cool. Hardly as warm as it should have been, with a man sleeping on it all night.  Was he still imagining things?  \"I'm glad you didn't call for a burial detail and have me expelled into space with yesterday's garbage,\" Arkalion called over his shoulder jauntily as he went outside for some breakfast.  Temple cursed softly and lit another cigarette, dropping the first one into a disposal chute on the wall.         *       *       *       *       *  Every night thereafter, Temple made it a point to remain awake after Arkalion apparently had fallen asleep. But if he were seeking repetition of the peculiar occurrence, he was disappointed. Not only did Arkalion sleep soundly and through the night, but he snored. Loudly and clearly, a wheezing snore.  Arkalion's strange feat--or his own overwrought imagination, Temple thought wryly--was good for one thing: it took his mind off Stephanie. The days wore on in endless, monotonous routine. He took some books from the ship's library and browsed through them, even managing to find one concerned with traumatic catalepsy, which stated that a severe emotional shock might render one into a deep enough trance to have a layman mistakenly pronounce him dead. But what had been the severe emotional disturbance for Arkalion? Could the effects of weightlessness manifest themselves in that way in rare instances? Temple naturally did not know, but he resolved to find out if he could after reaching their destination.  One day--it was three weeks after they left the space station, Temple realized--they were all called to assembly in the ship's large main lounge. As the men drifted in, Temple was amazed to see the progress they had made with weightlessness. He himself had advanced to handy facility in locomotion, but it struck him all the more pointedly when he saw two hundred men swim and float through air, pushing themselves along by means of the hand-holds strategically placed along the walls.  The ever-present microphone greeted them all. \"Good afternoon, men.\"  \"Good afternoon, mac!\"  \"Hey, is this the way to Ebbetts' Field?\"  \"Get on with it!\"  \"Sounds like the same man who addressed us in White Sands,\" Temple told Arkalion. \"He sure does get around.\"  \"A recording, probably. Listen.\"  \"Our destination, as you've probably read in newspapers and magazines, is the planet Mars.\"  Mutterings in the assembly, not many of surprise.  \"Their suppositions, based both on the seven hundred eighty day lapse between Nowhere Journeys and the romantic position in which the planet Mars has always been held, are correct. We are going to Mars.  \"For most of you, Mars will be a permanent home for many years to come--\"  \"Most of us?\" Temple wondered out loud.  Arkalion raised a finger to his lips for silence.  \"--until such time as you are rotated according to the policy of rotation set up by the government.\"  Temple had grown accustomed to the familiar hoots and catcalls. He almost had an urge to join in himself.  \"Interesting,\" Arkalion pointed out. \"Back at White Sands they claimed not to know our destination. They knew it all right--up to a point. The planet Mars. But now they say that all of us will not remain on Mars. Most interesting.\"  \"--further indoctrination in our mission soon after our arrival on the red planet. Landing will be performed under somewhat less strain than the initial takeoff in the Earth-to-station ferry, since Mars exerts less of a gravity pull than Earth. On the other hand, you have been weightless for three weeks and the change-over is liable to make some of you sick. It will pass harmlessly enough.  \"We realize it is difficult, being taken from your homes without knowing the nature of your urgent mission. All I can tell you now--and, as a matter of fact, all I know--\"  \"Here we go again,\" said Temple. \"More riddles.\"  \"--is that everything _is_ of the utmost urgency. Our entire way of life is at stake. Our job will be to safeguard it. In the months which follow, few of you will have any big, significant role to play, but all of you, working together, will provide the strength we need. When the _cadre_--\"  \"So they call their guards teachers,\" Arkalion commented dryly.  \"--come around, they will see that each man is strapped properly into his bunk for deceleration. Deceleration begins in twenty-seven minutes.\"  _Mars_, thought Temple, back in his room with Arkalion. _Mars._ He did not think of Stephanie, except as a man who knows he must spend the rest of his life in prison might think of a lush green field, or the cool swish of skis over fresh, powdery snow, or the sound of yardarms creaking against the wind on a small sailing schooner, or the tang of wieners roasting over an open fire with the crisp air of fall against your back, or the scent of good French brandy, or a woman.  Deceleration began promptly. Before his face was distorted and his eyes forced shut by a pressure of four gravities, Temple had time to see the look of complete unconcern on Arkalion's face. Arkalion, in fact, was sleeping.  He seemed as completely relaxed as he did that morning Temple thought he was dead.    CHAPTER IV  \"Petrovitch, S. A.!\" called the Comrade standing abreast of the head of the line, a thin, nervous man half a head shorter than the girl herself. Sophia Androvna Petrovitch strode forward, took a pair of trim white shorts from the neat stack at his left.  \"Is that all?\" she said, looking at him.  \"Yes, Comrade. Well, a woman. Well.\"  Without embarrassment, Sophia had seen the men ahead of her in line strip and climb into the white shorts before they disappeared through a portal ahead of the line, depositing their clothing in a growing pile on the floor. But now it was Sophia's turn, after almost a two hour wait. Not that it was chilly, but....  \"Is that all?\" she repeated.  \"Certainly. Strip and move along, Comrade.\" The nervous little man appraised her lecherously, she thought.  \"Then I must keep some of my own clothing,\" she told him.  \"Impossible. I have my orders.\"  \"I am a woman.\"  \"You are a volunteer for the Stalintrek. You will take no personal property--no clothing--with you. Strip and advance, please.\"  Sophia flushed slightly, while the men behind her began to call and taunt.  \"I like this Stalintrek.\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"We are waiting, Comrade.\"  Quickly and with an objective detachment which surprised her, Sophia unbuttoned her shirt, removed it. Her one wish--and an odd one, she thought, smiling--was for wax for her ears. She loosened the three snaps of her skirt, watched it fall to the floor. She stood there briefly, lithe-limbed, a tall, slim girl, then had the white shorts over her nakedness in one quick motion. She still wore a coarse halter.  \"All personal effects, Comrade,\" said the nervous little man.  \"No,\" Sophia told him.  \"But yes. Definitely, yes. You hold up the line, and we have a schedule to maintain. The Stalintrek demands quick, prompt obedience.\"  \"Then you will give me one additional item of clothing.\"  The man looked at Sophia's halter, at the fine way she filled it. He shrugged. \"We don't have it,\" he said, clearly enjoying himself.  In volunteering for the Stalintrek, Sophia had invaded man's domain. She had watched not with embarrassment but with scorn while the men in front of her got out of their clothing. She had invaded man's domain, and as she watched them, the short, flabby ones, the bony ones with protruding ribs and collar-bones, those of milky white skin and soft hands, she knew most of them would bite off more than they could chew if ever they tried what was the most natural thing for men to try with a lone woman in an isolated environment. But she _was_ in a man's world now, and if that was the way they wanted it, she would ask no quarter.  She reached up quickly with one hand and unfastened the halter, catching it with her free hand and holding it in front of her breasts while the nervous little man licked his lips and gaped. Sophia grabbed another pair of the white shorts, tore it quickly with her strong fingers, fashioning a crude covering for herself. This she pulled around her, fastening it securely with a knot in back.  \"You'll have to give that back to me,\" declared the nervous little Comrade.  \"I'll bet you a samovar on that,\" Sophia said quietly, so only the man heard her.  He reached out, as if to rip the crude halter from her body, but Sophia met him half-way with her strong, slim fingers, wrapping them around his biceps and squeezing. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32351"],["title","Voyage To Eternity (#5)"],["body","n's face turned quickly to white as he tried unsuccessfully to free his arm.  \"Please, that hurts.\"  \"I keep what I am wearing.\" She tightened her grip, but gazed serenely into space as the man stifled a whimper.  \"Well--\" the man whispered indecisively as he gritted his teeth.  \"Fool!\" said Sophia. \"Your arm will be black and blue for a week. While you men grow soft and lazy, many of the women take their gymnastics seriously, especially if they want to keep their figures with the work they must do and the food they must eat. I am stronger than you and I will hurt you unless--\" And her hand tightened around his scrawny arm until her knuckles showed white.  \"Wear what you have and go,\" the man pleaded, and moaned softly when Sophia released his numb arm and strode through the portal, still drawing whistles and leers from the other men, who missed the by-play completely.         *       *       *       *       *  \"So we're on Mars!\"  \"It ain't Nowhere after all, it's Mars.\"  \"Wait and see, buster. Wait and see.\"  \"Kind of cold, isn't it? Well, if this was Venus and some of them beautiful one-armed dames was waiting for us--\"  \"That's just a statue, stupid.\"  \"Lookit all them people down there, will you?\"  \"You think they're Martians?\"  \"Stupid! We ain't the first ones went on the Nowhere Journey.\"  \"What are we waiting for? It sure will feel good to stretch your legs.\"  \"Let's go!\"  \"Look out, Mars, here I come!\"  It would have been just right for a Hollywood epic, Temple thought. The rusty ochre emptiness spreading out toward the horizon in all directions, spotted occasionally with pale green and frosty white, the sky gray with but a shade of blue in it, distant gusts of Martian wind swirling ochre clouds across the desert, the spaceship poised on its ungainly bottom, a great silver bowling ball with rocket tubes for finger holes, and the Martians from Earth who had been here on this alien world for seven-hundred-eighty days or twice seven-eighty or three times, and who fought in frenzied eagerness, like savages, to reach the descending gangplank first.  Earth chorus: Hey, Martians, any of you guys speak English? Hah-ha, I said, any of you guys....  Where are all them canals I heard so much about?  You think maybe they're dangerous? (Laughter)  No dames. Hey, no dames....  Who were you expecting, Donna Daunley?  What kind of place is Mars with no women?  What do they do here, anyway, just sit around and wait for the next rocket?  I'm cold.  Get used to it, brother, get used to it.  Look out, Mars, here I come!  Martian chorus: Who won the Series last year, Detroit?  Hey, bud, tell me, are dames still wearing those one piece things, all colors, so you see their legs up to about here and their chests down to about here? (Gestures lewdly)  Which one of you guys can tell me what it's like to take a bath? I mean a real bath in a real bath tub.  Hey, we licked Russia yet?  We heard they were gonna send some dames!  Dames--ha-ha, you're breaking my heart.  Tell me what a steak tastes like. So thick.  Me? Gimme a bowl of steamed oysters. And a dame.  Dames. Girls. Women. Females. Chicks. Tomatoes. Frails. Dames. Dames. Dames....  They did not seem to mind the cold, these Earth-Martians. Temple guessed they never spent much time out of doors (above ground, for there were no buildings?) because all seemed pale and white. While the sun was weaker, so was the protection offered by a thinner atmosphere. The sun's actinic rays could burn, and so could the sand-driving wind. But pale skins could not be the result of staying indoors, for Temple noted the lack of man-made structures at once. Underground, then. The Earth-Martians lived underground like moles. Doing what? And for what reason? With what ultimate goal, if any? And where did those men who did not remain on Mars go? Temple's head whirled with countless questions--and no answers.  Shoulder to shoulder with Arkalion, he made his way down the gangplank, turning up the collar of his jumper against the stinging wind.  \"You got any newspapers, pal?\"  \"Magazines?\"  \"Phonograph records?\"  \"Gossip?\"  \"Newsfilm?\"  \"Who's the heavyweight champ?\"  \"We lick those Commies in Burma yet?\"  \"Step back! Watch that man. Maybe he's your replacement.\"  \"Replacement. Ha-ha. That's good.\"  All types of men. All ages. In torn, tattered clothing, mostly. In rags. Even if a man seemed more well-groomed than the rest, on closer examination Temple could see the careful stitching, the patches, the fades and stains. No one seemed to mind.  \"Hey, bud. What do you hear about rotation? They passed any laws yet?\"  \"I been here ten years. When do _I_ get rotated?\"  \"Ain't that something? Dad Jenks came here with the first ship. Don't you talk about rotation. Ask Dad.\"  \"Better not mention that word to Dad Jenks. He sees red.\"  \"This whole damn planet is red.\"  \"Want a guided tour of nowhere, men? Step right up.\"  Arkalion grinned. \"They seem so well-adjusted,\" he said, then shuddered against the cold and followed Temple, with the others, through the crowd.         *       *       *       *       *  They were inoculated against nameless diseases. (Watch for the needle with the hook.)  They were told again they had arrived on the planet Mars. (No kidding?)  Led to a drab underground city, dimly lit, dank, noisome with mold and mildew. (Quick, the chlorophyll.)  Assigned bunks in a dormitory, with four men to a room. (Be it ever so humble--bah!)  Told to keep things clean and assigned temporarily to a garbage pickup detail. (For this I left Sheboygan?)  Read to from the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and Public Law 1182 (concerned with the Nowhere Journey, it told them nothing they did not already know).  Given as complete a battery of tests, mental, emotional and physical, as Temple ever knew existed. (Cripes, man! How the hell should I know what the cube root of -5 is? I never finished high school!)  Subjected to an exhaustive, overlong, and at times meaningless personal interview. (No, doc, honest. I never knew I had a--uh--anxiety neurosis. Is it dangerous?)  \"How do you do, Temple? Sit down.\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"Thought you'd like to know that while your overall test score is not uncanny, it's decidedly high.\"  \"So what?\"  \"So nothing--not necessarily. Except that with it you have a very well balanced personality. We can use you, Temple.\"  \"That's why I'm here.\"  \"I mean--elsewhere. Mars is only a way station, a training center for a select few. It takes an awful lot of administrative work to keep this place going, which explains the need for all the station personnel.\"  \"Listen. The last few weeks I had everything thrown at me. Everything, the works. Mind answering one question?\"  \"Shoot.\"  \"What's this all about?\"  \"Temple, I don't know!\"  \"You what?\"  \"I know you find it hard to believe, but I don't. There isn't a man here on Mars who knows the whole story, either--and certainly not on Earth. We know enough to keep everything in operation. And we know it's important, all of it, everything we do.\"  \"You mentioned a need for some men elsewhere. Where?\"  The psychiatrist shrugged. \"I don't know. Somewhere. Anywhere.\" He spread his hands out eloquently. \"That's where the Nowhere Journey comes in.\"  \"Surely you can tell me something more than--\"  \"Absolutely not. It isn't that I don't want to. I can't. I don't know.\"  \"Well, one more question I'd like you to answer.\"  The psychiatrist lit a cigarette, grinned. \"Say, who is interviewing whom?\"  \"This one I think you can tackle. I have a brother, Jason Temple. Embarked on the Nowhere Journey five years ago. I wonder--\"  \"So that's the one factor in your psychograph we couldn't figure out--anxiety over your brother.\"  \"I doubt it,\" shrugged Temple. \"More likely my fiancee.\"  \"Umm, common enough. You were to be married?\"  \"Yes.\" _Stephanie, what are you doing now? Right now?_  \"That's what hurts the most.... Well, yes, I can find out about your brother.\" The psychiatrist flicked a toggle on his desk. \"Jamison, find what you can on Temple, Jason, year of--\"  \"1987,\" Temple supplied.  \"1987. We'll wait.\"  After a moment or two, the voice came through, faintly metallic: \"Temple, Jason. Arrival: 1987. Psychograph, 115b12. Mental aggregate, 98. Physcom, good to excellent. Training: two years, space perception concentrate, others. Shipped out: 1989.\"  So Jase had shipped out for--Nowhere.  \"Someday you'll follow in your brother's footsteps, Temple. Now, though, I have a few hundred questions I'd like you to answer.\"  The psychiatrist hadn't exaggerated. Several hours of questioning followed. Once reminded of her, Temple found it hard to keep his thought off Stephanie.  He left the psychiatrist's office more confused than ever.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Good morning, child. You Stephanie Andrews?\"  Stephanie hadn't felt up to working that first morning after Kit's final goodbye. She answered the door in her bathrobe, saw a small, middle-aged woman with graying hair and a kind face. \"That's right. Won't you come in?\"  \"Thank you. I represent the Complete Emancipation League, Miss Andrews.\"  \"Complete Emancipation League? Oh, something to do with politics. Really, I'm not much interested in--\"  \"That's entirely the trouble,\" declared the older woman. \"Too many of us are not interested in politics. I'd like to discuss the C.E.L. with you, my dear, if you will bear with me a few minutes.\"  \"All right,\" said Stephanie. \"Would you like a glass of sherry?\"  \"In the morning?\" the older woman smiled.  \"I'm sorry. Don't mind me. My fiance left yesterday, took his final goodbye. He--he embarked on the Nowhere Journey.\"  \"I realize that. It is precisely why I am here. My dear, the C.E.L. does not want to fight the government. If the government decides that the Nowhere Journey is vital for the welfare of the country--even if the government won't or can't explain what the Nowhere Journey is--that's all right with us. But if the government says"]]]
