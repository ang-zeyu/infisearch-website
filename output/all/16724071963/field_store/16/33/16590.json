You are either not true to the South, or you hain't the right kind of grit. Why, you have told me yourself that you let two Yankees capture you, without firing a shot. Think of it; a Confederate officer captured by two Yankee privates, without firing a shot.\"  \"They had the dead drop on me,\" murmured Rosenbaum. \"If I had moved they'd killed me sure.\"  \"Dead drop on you!\" repeated Bolivar scornfully. \"Two men with muskets have the dead drop on you! And you had a carbine and a revolver. Why, I have ridden into a nest of 10 or 15 Yankees, who had me covered with their guns. I killed three of them, wounded three others, and run the rest away with my empty revolver. If I'd had another revolver, not one would've got away alive. I always carry two revolvers now.\"  \"I think our guns'll be in the way in that room,\" said Shorty, sotting his down. His face bore a look of stern determination. \"They're too long. I'm itching to have it out with that feller hand-to-hand.{79} We'll rush in. You pretend to be goin' for Rosenbaum and leave me to have it out with Mr. Bolivar. Don't you mix in at all. If I don't settle him he ought to be allowed to go.\"  \"No,\" said Si decisively. \"I'm your superior officer, and it's my privilege to have the first shy at him. I'll 'tend to him. I want a chance singlehanded at a man that talks that way. You take care of Rosenbaum.\"  \"We mustn't dispute,\" said Shorty, stooping down and picking up a couple of straws. \"Here, pull. The feller that gits the longest 'tends to Bolivar; the other to Rosenbaum.\"  Si drew and left the longer straw in Shorty's hand. They drew their revolvers and rushed for the room, Shorty leading, Rosenbaum and Bolivar sprang up in alarm at the sound of their feet on the steps, and drew their revolvers.  \"Surrender, you infernal rebels,\" shouted the boys, as they bolted through the door.  With the quickness of a cat, Rosenbaum had sidled near the door through which they had come. Suddenly he fired two shots into the ceiling, and sprang through the door so quickly that Si had merely the chance to fire a carefully-aimed shot through the top of his hat. Si jumped toward the door again, and fired a shot in the air, for still further make-believe. He would waste no more, but reserve the other four for Bolivar, if he should need them.  Shorty confronted Bolivar with fierce eyes and leveled revolver, eagerly watching every movement and expression. The rebel was holding his pistol pointed upward, and his eyes looked savage. As his eyes met Shorty's the latter was amazed to see him close the left with a most emphatic wink. Seeing this was recognized, the rebel fired two shots into the ceiling, and motioned with his left hand to Si to continue firing. Without quite understanding. Si fired again. The rebel gave a terrific yell and fired a couple of shots out the window.  \"Do the same,\" he said to Shorty, who complied, as Si had done, in half-comprehension. The rebel handed his revolver to Shorty, stepped to the window and listened.  [Illustration: THE SURPRISE 79]  There came the sounds of two horses galloping away on the hard, rocky road.  \"He's gone, and taken the nigger with him,\" he said contentedly, turning from the window, and giving another fierce yell. \"Better fire the other two shots out of that pistol, to hurry him along.\"  Shorty fired the remaining shots out of the rebel's revolver.  \"What regiment do you belong to, boys?\" asked Bolivar calmly.  \"The 200th Ind.,\" answered Si, without being able to control his surprise.  \"A very good regiment,\" said the rebel. \"What's your company?\"  \"Co. Q,\" answered Si.  \"Who's your Colonel?\"  \"Col. Duckworth.\"  \"Who's your Captain?\"  \"Capt. McGillicuddy.\"  \"All right,\" said the rebel, with an air of satisfaction. \"I asked those questions to make sure you were genuine Yankees. One can't be too careful in my business. I'm in the United States Secret Service, and have to be constantly on the watch to keep it from being played on me by men pretending to be Yankees when they are rebels, and rebels when they are Yankees. I always make it the first point to ask them the names of their officers. I know almost all the officers in command on both sides.\"  \"You in the Secret Service?\" exploded the boys.{82}  They were on the point of adding \"too,\" but something whispered to them not to betray Rosenbaum.  \"Yes,\" answered Bolivar. \"I've just come from Tullahoma, where I've been around Bragg's Headquarters. I wanted to get inside our lines, but I was puzzled how to do it. That Jew you've just run off bothered me. I wish to the Lord you'd killed him. I'm more afraid of him than any other man in Bragg's army. He's smart as a briar, always nosing around where you don't want him, and anxious to do something to commend him to Headquarters, Jew like. I've thought he suspected me, for he'd been paying special attention to me for some weeks. Two or three times I've been on the point of tailing him into the woods somewhere and killing him, and so get rid of him. It's all right now. He'll go back to Tullahoma with a fearful story of the fight I made against you, and that I am probably killed. I'll turn up there in a week or two with my own story, and I'll give him fits for having skipped out and left me to fight you two alone. Say, it's a good ways to camp. Let's start at once, for I want to get to Headquarters as soon as possible.\"  \"You've got another revolver there,\" said Si, who had prudently reloaded his own weapon.  \"That's so,\" said Bolivar, pulling it out. \"You can take and carry it or I'll take the cylinder out, if you are not convinced about me.\"  \"You'd better let me carry it,\" said Shorty, shoving the revolver in his own belt. \"These are queer times, and one can't be too careful with rebels who{83} claim to be Yankees, and Yankees who claim to be rebels.\"  They trudged back to camp, taking turns riding the horse. When the rebel rode, however, one of the boys walked alongside with the bridle in his hand. All doubts as to Bolivar's story were dispelled by his instant recognition by the Provost-Marshal, who happened to be at the picket-post when they reached camp.  \"The longer I live,\" remarked Shorty, as they made their way along to the Hoosier's Rest, \"and I seem to live a little longer every day, the less I seem to understand about this war.\"  Shorty spoke as if he had had an extensive acquaintance with wars.  \"The only thing that I've come to be certain about,\" assented Si, \"is that you sometimes most always can't generally tell.\"  And they proceeded to get themselves some supper, accompanying the work of denunciations of the Commissary for the kind of rations he was drawing for the regiment, and of the Orderly-Sergeant for his letting the other Orderlies eucher him out of the company's fair share.    CHAPTER VI. LETTER FROM HOME  THE DEACON'S TROUBLES IN GETTING HOME WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN.  ONE MORNING the Orderly-Sergeant handed Si the following letter:  Deer Son: I got hoam safely a weke ago, thanks 2 all-protecting Providens; likewise 2 about 175 pound of tuff & helthy Josiah Klegg. Providens helpt rite along, but it tuk 50-year-old Injianny hickory & whit-leather 2 pull through sum ov the tite plasis.  Abraham Lincoln is as strong as an ox, but I never thought that anything that diddent wear horns or chew the cud could be so measly dumb. He kin eat as much as Buck, our off-steer, & I declare I don't believe he knows any more.  We had only bin on the train long enuff for Abe to finish up the whole of the 3 days rations you provided us with 2 last us home, when I notist that Blowhard Billings was on board. He was still dressed in full uniform, & playin off officer yit, but I happened 2 recolleck that he was no officer no more, & it wuz lucky that I done so. He wuz lookin at me & Abe hard with them mean, fatfish ize ov hizn.  Jest as a matter ov precaushon. I make Abe change seats with me & taik the inside. Billings{85} caim up. You know what I thought ov him ov old, & there's never bin any love lost betwixt us sence I stopped him cheatin poor Eli Mitchell outen his plow-team. I told him then that the coppers on a dead nigger's eyes wuzzent saif when he wuz around, & I woulddent trust him ez fur ez I could sling a bull by the tale. He got mad at this & never got over it. I never encouraged him to. I woulddent feel satisfied with myself if he wuzzent mad at me. I coulddent change my opinion, even when he tried to steal into respectability by goin into the army. I knowed he'd do anything but fite, & woulddent've bin supprized any day by hearing that him and the other mules in camp had disappeared together.  Presently Billings he cum up very corjil like & says:  \"Howdy, Deacon. I hope you air very well.\"  I told him I wuz tollable peart, and he says:  \"I see a man in the third car forward that wuz inquiring for you, and wanted to see you powerful bad.\"  \"That so?\" says I, unconcernedlike.  \"Yes,\" says he. \"He wuz awful anxious to see you, and I said I'd send you to him if I cum acrost you.\"  Somehow, I dropped onto it in a minnit that he wuz schemin' to git me away from Abraham Lincoln--  \"Well,\" says I, \"it's about ez fur for me forward to him as it is for him back here to me. I don't know as I want to see him at all. If he wants to see me so bad let him cum back here.\"{86}  \"I think I'd go forward and see him,\" said Billings, sort ov impatient-like. \"You'll have no trouble finding him. He's in the third car from here, up at the front end, right-hand side, next to the watercooler. He inquired most partickerlerly for you.\"  \"Probably he wants 2 borry money,\" says I, without stirrin'. \"Men that want particularly 2 see me always do. Well, I hain't got none 2 lend--hain't got no more'n 'll talk me hoam.\"  \"You'd better go forward & see him,\" he said very bossy like, as if he was orderin me.  \"I'd better stay right here, & I'm goin' to stay,\" says I, so decided"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31774"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 4 (#0)"],["body","KLEGG  EXPERIENCES OF SI AND SHORTY ON THE GREAT TULLAHOMA CAMPAIGN.

STEWED CHICKEN   PREFACE  \"Si Klegg, of the 200th Ind., and Shorty, his Partner,\" were born years ago in the brain of John McElroy, Editor of THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE.  These sketches are the original ones published in THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE, revised and enlarged some what by the author. How true they are to nature every veteran can abundantly testify from his own service. Really, only the name of the regiment was invented. There is no doubt that there were several men of the name of Josiah Klegg in the Union Army, and who did valiant service for the Govern ment. They had experiences akin to, if not identical with, those narrated here, and substantially every man who faithfully and bravely carried a musket in defense of the best Government on earth had some times, if not often, experiences of which those of Si Klegg are a strong reminder.  THE PUBLISHERS.   THIS BOOK IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED  TO THE RANK AND FILE  OF THE GRANDEST ARMY EVER MUSTERED FOR WAR.     SI KLEGG    CHAPTER I. THE TULLAHOMA CAMPAIGN ON TO DUCK RIVER  \"ONLY 25 MILES TO SHELBYVILLE.\"  JUNE 23, 1863, ended the Army of the Cumberland's six months of wearisome inaction around Murfreesboro its half-year of tiresome fort-building, drilling, picketing and scouting.  Then its 60,000 eager, impatient men swept forward in combinations of masterful strategy, and in a brief, wonderfully brilliant campaign of nine days of drenching rain drove Bragg out of his strong fortifications in the rugged hills of Duck River, and compelled him to seek refuge in the fastnesses of the Cumberland Mountains, beyond the Tennessee River.  \"Now,\" said Shorty, as they stood in line, waiting the order to move, \"as Old Rosy has clearly waked up to business, I hope to gracious that Mr. Bragg will be found at home ready for callers. We've wasted six months waiting for him to get good and ready, and he certainly ought to be in trim to transact any little business we may have with him.\"  \"I think you needn't trouble yourself about that, Shorty,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy. \"All the news is that Bragg is down there in Shelbyville in force, and with blood in his eye. Somebody is going to be terribly whipped before the end of the week, and I'm pretty sure it won't be the Army of the Cumberland.\"  \"Well, let's have it over and done with,\" said Si. \"It's got to be fought out some time, and the sooner the better. I wish the whole thing could be fought to a finish to-morrow. Then I'd know at once whether I'm to live through this war.\"  \"I don't think you'll be kept long in suspense,\" replied Capt. McGillicuddy. \"Shelbyville is only 25 miles away. We can't go forward many hours with out forcing a collision as to the right of way. If we can whip Bragg behind the works he has been building for the last six months, we'll settle the whole business for the Southern Confederacy in the West. Grant will take Vicksburg, and then we'll have peace.\"  \"Only 25 miles,\" repeated Shorty. \"We ought to be squarely up against them not later than to-morrow night and one or two days' lively pounding ought to make Mr. Bragg holler enough.\"  \"Rosenbaum is as certain as he is of his life,\" said Si to the Captain and the rest, \"that Bragg has the bulk of his army at Shelbyville, which, as you say, is but 25 miles from here, and that he will draw the rest in and fight us behind the awfully big forts that he has been building for the last six months from Shelbyville to War Trace. Rosenbaum says that he knows it for a fact that 3,000 negroes have been worked on the forts ever since Bragg retreated there last January.\"  \"Well, 25 miles isn't far to go for a fight,\" returned Shorty. \"All that I ask is that the 200th Ind. be given the advance. We'll make schedule time to ward Shelbyville, and bring on the fight before early candle-lightin' to-morrow evening.\"  \"I guess you'll have your wish, Shorty,\" returned Capt. McGillicuddy. \"We lead the brigade to-day, anyway, and we'll try to keep the lead clear through.\"  Then the rain poured down so violently that all the conversation was suspended, except more or less profane interjections upon the luck of the Army of the Cumberland in never failing to bring on a deluge when it started to march.  In the midst of this the bugles sounded \"For ward!\" and the 200th Ind. swung out on the Shelby ville Pike, and set its face sternly southward. After it trailed the rest of the brigade, then the ambulances and wagons, and then the rest of the division.  At times the rain was actually blinding, but the men plodded on doggedly and silently. They had ex austed their epithets at the start, and now settled down to stolid endurance.  \"We've only got to go 25 miles, boys,\" Si would occasionally say, by way of encouragement. \"This rain can't last forever at this rate. It'll probably clear up bright just as we reach Shelbyville to-morrow, and give us sunshine to do our work in.\"  But when the column halted briefly at noon, for dinner for the men and mules, it was raining harder and steadier than ever. It was difficult to start fires with the soaked rails and chunks, all were wet to the skin, and rivulets of water ran from them as they stood or walked. The horses of the officers seemed shrunken and drawn-up, and the mud was getting deeper every minute.  \"Lucky we had the advance,\" said the optimistic Si. \"We have churned the roads into a mortar-bed, and them that comes after us will have hard pullin'. I wonder how many miles we've made of them 25?\"  \"I feel that we've already gone full 25,\" said Shorty. \"But Tennessee miles's made o' injy-rubber, and stretch awfully.\"  They were too ill-humored to talk much, but stood around and sipped their hot coffee and munched sodden crackers and fried pork in silence. Pork fried in the morning in a half-canteen, and carried for hours in a dripping haversack, which reduced the crackers to a tasteless mush, is not an appetizing viand; but the hunger of hard exercise in the open air makes it \"go.\"  Again the bugles sounded \"Forward,\" and they plodded on more stolidly than ever.  Increasing evidences of the enemy's presence be gan to stimulate them. Through the sheets of rain they saw a squad of rebel cavalry close to them. There was much snapping of damp gun-caps on both sides, a few unavailing shots were actually fired, and they caught glimpses between the rain-gusts of the rebel horsemen galloping up the muddy road to ward the rising hills.  They pushed forward with more spirit now. They came to insignificant brooks which were now raging torrents, through which they waded waist deep, first placing their treasured ammunition on their shoul ders or heads.  As they were crossing one of these, Si unluckily stepped into a deep hole, which took him in over his head. His foot struck a stone, which rolled, and down he went. Shorty saw him disappear, made a frantic clutch for him, and went down himself. For a brief tumultuous instant they bobbed around against the legs of the other boys, who went down like tenpins. Nearly the whole of Co. Q was at once floundering in the muddy torrent, with the Captain, who had succeeded in crossing, looking back in dis may at the disaster. The Orderly-Sergeant and a few others at the head of the company rushed in and pulled out by the collars such of the boys as they could grab. Si and Shorty came to the bank a little ways down, blowing and sputtering, and both very angry.  [Illustration: DURING THE HALT FOR DINNER. 20]  \"All your infernal clumsiness,\" shouted Shorty. \"You never will look where you're goin'. No more sense than a blind hoss.\"  \"Shut up,\" said Si, wrathfully. \"Don't you talk about clumsiness. It was them splay feet o' your'n that tripped me, and then you downed the rest o' the boys. Every mite of our grub and ammunition's gone.\"  How far the quarrel would have gone cannot be told, for at that instant a regiment of rebels, which had been pushed out in advance, tried to open a fire upon the 200th Ind. from behind a rail fence at the bottom of the hill. Only enough of their wet guns could be gotten off to announce their presence. The Colonel of the 200th Ind. yelled:  \"Companies left into line!\"  The soggy men promptly swung around.  \"Fix bayonets! Forward, double-quick!\" shouted the Colonel.  It was a sorry \"double-quick,\" through the pelting rain, the entangling weeds and briars, and over the rushing streams which flooded the field, but it was enough to discourage the rebels, who at once went back in a heavy-footed run to the works on the hill, and the rebel cannon boomed out to cover their retreat.  \"Lie down!\" shouted the Colonel, as they reached the fence, and a shell struck a little in advance, filling the air with mud and moist fragments of vegetation.  As they lay there and recovered their breath there was much splashing and splattering of mud, much running to and fro, much galloping of Aids in their rear. The 200th Ind. was ordered to hold its place, and be ready for a charge upon the hill when it received orders. The"]]]
