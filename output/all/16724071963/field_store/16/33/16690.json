We soon rallied, and went back to the line with only one hundred men to guard the colors; the rest were scattered but came up during the day and night. Hard fighting every day till the 21st. Then Grant made one of his masterly movements round their right flank. Our Brigade started direct for their extreme right, struck them about five o'clock, and made preparations for a charge, but darkness set in, and about ten o'clock we started for the rear; marched all night, and took our breakfast on the bank of the Pamunkey river; continued our march, and on the 24th crossed the North Anna river, under a severe storm of shell bursting over our heads; we then entered the line. On the 25th, advanced our line about five hundred yards; 26th, hard fighting, but nothing gained. During the night we fell back across the river and burned the bridge.  May 27th, we took up our line of march, crossed the Pamunkey river, and went into camp; a distance of thirty-five miles. On the 30th, we started out as rear guard for the brigade teams. May 31st, General Griffin ordered our regiment alone into the woods to try the enemy's strength; we passed down into the ravine and up a steep bluff under a galling fire, but at last we reached the top and held our position till the reserves were sent to support both of our flanks; hard fighting all day.  June 1st, 1864. All quiet till about ten o'clock; then the enemy charged on our left and were driven back with heavy loss. They also charged on our right in plain sight. Two lines came up on the double-quick till within two hundred yards. Then you might have seen a line of dusty forms spring up as if by magic, and a sheet of fire burst forth which sent them reeling back to their cover in the woods. They soon rallied again and came on with double the force that had first assailed us. Just then, one of our light batteries, of six guns, was placed in position in the woods, and gave them grape and canister.  On they came regardless of life and fearless as demons; but soon they met a sheet of fire which seemed to consume them; they retreated to the woods for the second time, and made no further attack on that part of our line.  On the 2d, we fell back and moved about five miles to the left. At four o'clock, they came down on us and tried to get in our rear; but all to no purpose. We fought hard during the following day, but rested that night. On the 4th, we moved about four miles, and formed on the right of the line at Coal Harbor. Every one knows about this place. It will be sufficient to say that we had work to do, and I think all were glad when the order came to fall back.  Just after dark, on the 11th, we started back and took our breakfast near Whitehouse landing, and continued our march. Our next rest was near the James river, where we remained until the 15th, when we took up our line of march just at dusk, and marched all night and till four o'clock of the following day. Forming on the line of battle near the Weldon railroad, we went in on a charge, and fought more or less all night.  On the morning of the 17th, we charged all along the line, drove the enemy back, took several pieces of artillery, and more or less prisoners. Advanced about one mile on the 18th, and during the night threw up earth works in an old oat field near a peach orchard. On the 19th, we dug our pit eight feet wide and three deep, throwing all the earth in front. Hard fighting on the left. On the 20th, hard fighting all along the line. I received a slight wound across my left temple.  June 21st ended my term in the field. I was wounded in the left arm, and had it amputated just above the elbow. Now for the hospital. I was carried to City Point on the 23d. Thanks to the Christian and Sanitary Commissions, which greatly relieved us, not only in furnishing so many good things, but in sending to us those who always had a kind word for us all.  On the 30th, I was carried on board the hospital boat, and arrived at Washington, D. C., on the 1st of July, and was carried to Finley Hospital. I was well cared for here, and my arm healed rapidly, while many others sickened and died.  On the 22d of August, I received a furlough for sixty days. I arrived home on the 24th. I cannot attempt to describe my feelings as I crossed the threshold, and placed this good right arm around the aged form of my beloved mother, who tottered to meet me, and throwing her arms around my neck, kissed me again and again. Not less welcome was the fervent \"God bless you, my son,\" from father. My wife was absent at this time, at the bedside of a sick sister, who died in about two weeks after I got home. Then she returned to me, and entered into the general rejoicing at my safe arrival.  Soon after I came home the stump of my arm began to trouble me very much. Gangrene set in, the stump swelled up and turned black. They carried me to my sister's, Mrs. Smith Hancock, in Franklin, where I was attended by Dr. Knights of that town. For about three weeks my life was despaired of; then I began to gain. Through the kind care of all and the skill of Dr. Knights,--but more through the providence of God,--I was spared; for what, I do not know. God knows, and he doeth all things well.  December 2d, I reported at Concord, and went into the Hospital there. On the 8th, I was sent forward to Washington. Arrived there on the 11th, and went into Finley Hospital. I was transferred to Manchester, N. H., on the 10th of January, 1865, and remained there till I received my discharge, on the 29th of May.  My story is told.

We split up to avoid attracting attention. Engdahl just came in over the big bridge, but I had Arthur with me so I had to come the long way around.      [Illustration]  When I registered at the desk, I said I was from Chicago. You know how it is. If you say you're from Philadelphia, it's like saying you're from St. Louis or Detroit--I mean _nobody_ lives in Philadelphia any more. Shows how things change. A couple years ago, Philadelphia was all the fashion. But not now, and I wanted to make a good impression.  I even tipped the bellboy a hundred and fifty dollars. I said: \"Do me a favor. I've got my baggage booby-trapped--\"  \"Natch,\" he said, only mildly impressed by the bill and a half, even less impressed by me.  \"I mean _really_ booby-trapped. Not just a burglar alarm. Besides the alarm, there's a little surprise on a short fuse. So what I want you to do, if you hear the alarm go off, is come running. Right?\"  \"And get my head blown off?\" He slammed my bags onto the floor. \"Mister, you can take your damn money and--\"  \"Wait a minute, friend.\" I passed over another hundred. \"Please? It's only a shaped charge. It won't hurt anything except anybody who messes around, see? But I don't want it to go off. So you come running when you hear the alarm and scare him away and--\"  \"No!\" But he was less positive. I gave him two hundred more and he said grudgingly: \"All right. If I hear it. Say, what's in there that's worth all that trouble?\"  \"Papers,\" I lied.  He leered. \"Sure.\"  \"No fooling, it's just personal stuff. Not worth a penny to anybody but me, understand? So don't get any ideas--\"  He said in an injured tone: \"Mister, naturally the _staff_ won't bother your stuff. What kind of a hotel do you think this is?\"  \"Of course, of course,\" I said. But I knew he was lying, because I knew what kind of hotel it was. The staff was there only because being there gave them a chance to knock down more money than they could make any other way. What other kind of hotel was there?  Anyway, the way to keep the staff on my side was by bribery, and when he left I figured I had him at least temporarily bought. He promised to keep an eye on the room and he would be on duty for four more hours--which gave me plenty of time for my errands.         *       *       *       *       *  I made sure Arthur was plugged in and cleaned myself up. They had water running--New York's very good that way; they always have water running. It was even hot, or nearly hot. I let the shower splash over me for a while, because there was a lot of dust and dirt from the Bronx that I had to get off me. The way it looked, hardly anybody had been up that way since it happened.  I dried myself, got dressed and looked out the window. We were fairly high up--fifteenth floor. I could see the Hudson and the big bridge up north of us. There was a huge cloud of smoke coming from somewhere near the bridge on the other side of the river, but outside of that everything looked normal. You would have thought there were people in all those houses. Even the streets looked pretty good, until you noticed that hardly any of the cars were moving.  I opened the little bag and loaded my pockets with enough money to run my errands. At the door, I stopped and called over my shoulder to Arthur: \"Don't worry if I'm gone an hour or so. I'll be back.\"  I didn't wait for an answer. That would have been pointless under the circumstances.  After Philadelphia, this place seemed to be bustling with activity. There were four or five people in the lobby and a couple of dozen more out in the street.  I tarried at the desk for several reasons. In the first place, I was expecting Vern Engdahl to try to contact me and I didn't want him messing with the luggage--not while Arthur might get nervous. So I told the desk clerk that in case anybody came inquiring for Mr. Schlaepfer, which was the name I was using--my real name being Sam Dunlap--he was to be told that on no account was he to go to my room but to wait in the lobby; and in any case I would be back in an hour.  \"Sure,\" said the desk clerk, holding out his hand.  I crossed it with paper. \"One other thing,\" I said. \"I need to buy an electric typewriter and some other stuff. Where can I get them?\"  \"PX,\" he said promptly.  \"PX?\"  \"What used to be Macy's,\" he explained. \"You go out that door and turn right. It's only about a block. You'll see the sign.\"  \"Thanks.\" That cost me a hundred more, but it was worth it. After all, money wasn't a problem--not when we had just come from Philadelphia.         *       *       *       *       *  The big sign read \"PX,\" but it wasn't big enough to hide an older sign underneath that said \"Macy's.\" I looked it over from across the street.  Somebody had organized it pretty well. I had to admire them. I mean I don't like New York--wouldn't live there if you gave me the place--but it showed a sort of go-getting spirit. It was no easy job getting a full staff together to run a department store operation, when any city the size of New York must have a couple thousand stores. You know what I mean? It's like running a hotel or anything else--how are you going to get people to work for you when they can just as easily walk down the street, find a vacant store and set up their own operation?  But Macy's was fully manned. There was a guard at every door and a walking patrol along the block-front between the entrances to make sure nobody broke in through the windows. They all wore green armbands and uniforms--well, lots of people wore uniforms.  I walked over.  \"Afternoon,\" I said affably to the guard. \"I want to pick up some stuff. Typewriter, maybe a gun, you know. How do you work it here? Flat rate for all you can carry, prices marked on everything, or what is it?\"  He stared at me suspiciously. He was a monster; six inches taller than I, he must have weighed two hundred and fifty pounds. He didn't look very smart, which might explain why he was working for somebody else these days. But he was smart enough for what he had to do.  He demanded: \"You new in town?\"  I nodded.  He thought for a minute. \"All right, buddy. Go on in. You pick out what you want, see? We'll straighten out the price when you come out.\"  \"Fair enough.\" I started past him.  He grabbed me by the arm. \"No tricks,\" he ordered. \"You come out the same door you went in, understand?\"  \"Sure,\" I said, \"if that's the way you want it.\"  That figured--one way or another: either they got a commission, or, like everybody else, they lived on what they could knock down. I filed that for further consideration.  Inside, the store smelled pretty bad. It wasn't just rot, though there was plenty of that; it was musty and stale and old. It was dark, or nearly. About one light in twenty was turned on, in order to conserve power. Naturally the escalators and so on weren't running at all.         *       *       *       *       *  I passed a counter with pencils and ball-point pens in a case. Most of them were gone--somebody hadn't bothered to go around in back and had simply knocked the glass out--but I found one that worked and an old order pad to write on. Over by the elevators there was a store directory, so I went over and checked it, making a list of the departments worth visiting.  Office Supplies would be the typewriter. Garden & Home was a good bet--maybe I could find a little wheelbarrow to save carrying the typewriter in my arms. What I wanted was one of the big ones where all the keys are solenoid-operated instead of the cam-and-roller arrangement--that was all Arthur could operate. And those things were heavy, as I knew. That was why we had ditched the old one in the Bronx.  Sporting Goods--that would be for a gun, if there were any left. Naturally, they were about the first to go after it happened, when _everybody_ wanted a gun. I mean everybody who lived through it. I thought about clothes--it was pretty hot in New York--and decided I might as well take a look.  Typewriter, clothes, gun, wheelbarrow. I made one more note on the pad--try the tobacco counter, but I didn't have much hope for that. They had used cigarettes for currency around this area for a while, until they got enough bank vaults open to supply big bills. It made cigarettes scarce.  I turned away and noticed for the first time that one of the elevators was stopped on the main floor. The doors were closed, but they were glass doors, and although there wasn't any light inside, I could see the elevator was full. There must have been thirty or forty people in the car when it happened.  I'd been thinking that, if nothing else, these New Yorkers were pretty neat--I mean if you don't count the Bronx. But here were thirty or forty skeletons that nobody had even bothered to clear away.  You call that neat? Right in plain view on the ground floor, where everybody who came into the place would be sure to go--I mean if it had been on one of the upper floors, what difference would it have made?  I began to wish we were out of the city. But naturally that would have to wait until we finished what we came here to do--otherwise, what was the point of coming all the way here in the first place?         *       *       *       *       *  The tobacco counter was bare. I got the wheelbarrow easily enough--there were plenty of those, all sizes; I picked out a nice light red-and-yellow one with rubber-tired wheel. I rolled it over to Sporting Goods on the same floor, but that didn't work out too well. I found a 30-30 with telescopic sights, only there weren't"]]]
