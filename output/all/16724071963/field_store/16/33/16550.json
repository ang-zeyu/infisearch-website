In comparison with _nanus_ this subspecies is      slightly paler, in this respect showing more resemblance to      _codiensis_ although not so pale, and more grizzled or unevenly      colored. This difference in color between _zygomaticus_ and      _codiensis_ may not be of taxonomic significance. From both the      topotypes of _nanus_, and the series of it from Wyoming,      _zygomaticus_ differs on the average in having a relatively shorter      tail, a relatively shorter upper molar tooth-row, relatively more      rounded and relatively more wide-spread zygomatic arches, and      smaller more flattened bullae.       _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of 24 adult males      and females from several localities here referred to _M. m.      zygomaticus_ are as follows: total length, 159(150-175); length of      tail, 37.6(31-46); hind foot, 18.6(17-20); condylobasilar length of      the skull, 25.3(24.2-26.7); zygomatic breadth, 15.3(14.1-16.7);      alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.2 (5.7-6.8);      prelambdoidal breadth, 8.7(8.3-9.4); lambdoidal breadth,      11.9(11.0-12.5). Average and extreme measurements of a series of 12      adult male topotypes are as follows: total length, 159(144-174);      length of tail, 36.4 (30-41); hind foot, 18.2(16-20);      condylobasilar length of skull, 25.8(24.7-26.7); alveolobasilar      length, 14.8(13.8-15.3); palatilar length, 13.8 (12.7-14.2);      alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.4(5.9-6.6); zygomatic      breadth, 15.9 (15.0-16.7); interorbital breadth, 3.6(3.4-3.7);      lambdoidal breadth, 12.1 (11.5-12.5); prelambdoidal breadth,      8.6(8.3-8.9); depth of braincase, 8.0 (7.6-8.3).  _Discussion._--This subspecies is separated from _M. m. codiensis_ to the west by the Big Horn Basin. A series from along Buffalo Creek, 27 mi. N, 1 mi. E Powder River, 6075 ft., in Natrona County, Wyoming, is intermediate between the topotypes of _zygomaticus_ and _nanus_ in the characters cited above as distinguishing the two, but shows greater resemblance to _zygomaticus_ in the shape of the zygomatic arch, in color which is paler than in topotypes of _zygomaticus_, and in the short hind foot. On these and on geographic grounds this population is referred to _zygomaticus_. Unfortunately we cannot be certain in many cases that an intermediate condition in a certain character indicates a genetically intermediate population and therefore true intergradation between the two subspecies to which the population is geographically intermediate. The topotypes of this subspecies are the most distinct of all the series which I have studied from the eastern Rocky Mountains, in terms of the degree of morphological departure from the norm for the species. After _zygomaticus_ the following populations are arranged according to their degree of deviation from this norm (_codiensis_ deviates most): topotypes of _codiensis_, _fusus_ and a population from southern Sweetwater County, Wyoming, and lastly the _nanus-caryi_ complex. Within the latter group, as I have mentioned, there are a number of local variants most of which do not differ significantly and do not conform to any geographic pattern.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 55, distributed as follows      (abbreviations for collections are given in the account of _M. m.      nanus_; localities that are not represented in Fig. 1 because      overlapping or crowding of the symbols would result are      Italicized): WYOMING: _Big Horn Co._: Medicine Wheel Ranch, 9000      ft., 28 mi.

Alexander; original number 2568. Type not seen by me.       _Range._--Southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.       _Comparisons._--For comparison with _M. m. nanus_, the subspecies      to the northward, see the preceding account of that subspecies. For      comparison with _M. m. amosus_ the subspecies to the west see Hall      (1938) and Durrant (1952). I have not examined specimens of      _amosus_.       _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements for 17 adults      including both males and females from several localities in      southern Colorado are as follows: total length, 160 (136-179);      length of tail, 42 (35-55); hind foot, 19.2 (17-23); condylobasilar      length of the skull, 25.2 (24.0-26.0); zygomatic breadth, 15.0      (14.1-15.5); alveolar length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.4      (6.0-6.7); prelambdoidal breadth, 8.7 (8.3-9.2); lambdoidal      breadth, 11.7 (11.1-12.6).       Average and extreme measurements of 4 adults (2 males and 2      females) from the type locality and 11 adults (4 males and 7      females) from other localities in southern Colorado are as follows:      total length, 162 (157-168), 157 (137-169); length of tail (means      only), 44.5, 40.5; hind foot, 18.8 (18-19), 18.6 (18-23);      condylobasilar length of skull, 24.5 (24.0-24.7), 25.2 (24.3-26.1);      alveolobasilar length, 14.2 (13.9-14.5), 14.6 (14.1-15.1);      palatilar length, 13.2 (13.0-13.4), 13.5 (13.1-14.2); alveolar      length of upper molar tooth-row, 6.3 (6.0-6.6), 6.4 (6.3-6.7);      zygomatic breadth, 15.0 (14.3-15.5), 14.9 (14.1-15.5); interorbital      breadth, 3.5 (3.3-3.6), 3.5 (3.3-3.7); lambdoidal breadth, 11.8      (11.1-12.6), 11.7 (11.2-12.3); prelambdoidal breadth, 8.6      (8.3-9.2), 8.8 (8.3-9.0); depth of braincase, 7.5 (7.2-7.8), 7.6      (7.1-7.9).  _Discussion._--There is no sharp boundary between _M. m. fusus_ of southern Colorado and the subspecies to the north, _M. m. nanus_. Although the line separating these two subspecies is drawn somewhat arbitrarily, on the whole the samples from north of this line more closely resemble _nanus_. All of the means for total length given above are larger than the maximum given in Hall's description of _fusus_. The caudal index (38 and 35% in two series) is slightly larger than that cited by Hall (33.3%) and is not significantly different from that in _nanus_ (35.2%). The color in both young and old mice is variable, but in general is more yellowish, and less grayish, than in any other series studied.  There is a large area in western Colorado and eastern Utah, between the known ranges of _M. m. fusus_ and _M. m. amosus_ from which there are no specimens. Probably the species occurs only at certain places in this arid region which seems to be a partial barrier to the species.  Specimens of _M. montanus_ from northern New Mexico have been referred previously to _M. m. arizonensis_. When he named _M. m. fusus_, Hall mentioned its resemblance to _arizonensis_ in reddish coloration, but pointed out that _fusus_ is less reddish. Of six specimens from Valle Santa Rosa, Jemez Mountains (USBS), 8500 ft., Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, three are immature, and the skulls of the remaining specimens are damaged. In reddish color and relatively large size these few specimens resemble _arizonensis_ more than _fusus_ although the locality of occurrence is closer to the geographic range of the northern _fusus_ than to that of _arizonensis_. The identification of these specimens as _arizonensis_ is provisional; additional specimens are needed from the area, 200 miles wide, which separates the ranges as now known of _arizonensis_ in Arizona from the occurrence in New Mexico. There is a single specimen from this area, the damaged skull of which prevents conclusive identification. The specimen is either _M. montanus_ or _M. mexicanus_, and is from Nutria, on the southern edge of the Zuni Mountains (USBS). Detailed comparison of _fusus_ and _arizonensis_ is not attempted here although it may be stated that in several characters _fusus_ is intermediate between _arizonensis_ to the south and _nanus_ to the north.       _Specimens examined._--Total, 89, distributed as follows      (abbreviations for collections are given in the account of _M. m.      nanus_; localities that are not represented in Fig. 1 because      overlapping or crowding of the symbols would result are      Italicized):       COLORADO: _Pitkin Co._: 5 mi.

So that the variability can be evaluated more adequately, the coefficient of variability and 2 times the standard error of the mean are included for the measurements in two series. The series consist of all the adult specimens (with a condylobasilar length of 24.0 mm. or more) of both sexes from the areas specified. Various barriers are shown in Fig. 2 for comparison with the distributions of the subspecies and the localities of known occurrence shown in Fig. 1. _Microtus montanus_ has not been taken in the Black Hills area of extreme northeastern Wyoming. Suitable montane habitat is present and both _Microtus pennsylvanicus insperatus_ and _Microtus longicaudus longicaudus_ occur there. The arid basin of the Powder River presumably is a barrier that has prevented _M. montanus_ from reaching this area.   REFERENCES CITED  BAILEY, V.       1900.
