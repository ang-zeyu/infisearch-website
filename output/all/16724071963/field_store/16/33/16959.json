It rose to about twenty thousand feet, leveled off. Twice it circled the battleship, ignoring the shell bursts, that tried to keep up with it.  Then it turned in the direction from which it had come. It was out of sight in seconds.  There was silence on the bridge of the Idaho.  \"Holy cats!\" Craig heard an officer mutter. \"Somebody is crazy as hell. _We_ don't have planes that will fly like that and I know damned good and well they didn't have them a hundred thousand years ago!\"  Was Michaelson wrong? Was he talking through his hat when he said the Idaho had been precipitated through a time fault into the remote past? He had said they might be a hundred thousand years in the past, or a million years--he didn't know which. The appearance of the lizard-birds, the great winged dragons of mythology, had seemed to prove that the scientist was correct.  Did these two mysterious planes, of strange shape and design and with the ability to fly at such blinding speed, prove that he was wrong?  Was it possible--the thought stunned Craig--that they had been precipitated into the future?  The winged dragons belonged to the past. The planes, theoretically at least, belonged to the future.  \"Something is crazy!\" Captain Higgins said. \"Go get that scientist,\" he spoke to one of his aides. \"I want to talk to him.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Michaelson came to the bridge and listened quietly to what Higgins had to say. His grave face registered no emotion but his eyes were grim.  \"I can definitely tell you _two_ things,\" he said at last. \"One of them is that we are not in what could be called the future.\"  \"But those two planes were better than anything we have invented!\" Captain Higgins insisted. \"The airplane was not invented until 1907. This _has_ to be the future.\"  \"_Men_ invented airplanes in 1907,\" Michaelson said. Ever so slightly he emphasized the word \"_men_.\"  Higgins stared at him. Slowly, as he realized the implication of what the scientist had said, his face began to change. \"What are you driving at?\" he said, his voice a whisper.  Michaelson spread his hands in a helpless gesture. \"The Wright brothers invented the lighter-than-air ship early in the twentieth century,\" he said. \"They were the first men to fly a plane, the first men of our race. But how do we know what happened on earth a million years ago, and I can definitely tell you that we are at least a million years in the past? The history that we know fairly well does not cover a span of more than five thousand years. How can we be certain what happened or did not happen on earth millions of years ago?\"  The scientist spoke quietly, his voice almost a whisper. \"We are before the time of the airplane. Yet we find airplanes? What do you think that might mean?\"  \"I--\" Higgins faltered, his mind flinching away from facing the unknown gulfs of time. He forced his mind to heel. \"It means there are people here in this time,\" he said huskily. \"People, or _something_, who know how to make planes.\"  Michaelson nodded. \"That would be my conclusion,\" he said.  \"But that is impossible,\" Higgins flared. \"If there had been civilizations in the past, we would have a record of them. I mean, we would have found their cities, even if the people had disappeared. We would have found traces of their factories, of their buildings--\"  \"Would we?\" Michaelson asked.  \"Certainly. Don't you agree with me?\"  \"Not necessarily,\" the scientist said. \"You are forgetting one important fact--the size of a million years. A million years from now will anyone be able to find New York? Chicago? London? The steel mills of Pittsburgh? I think not. In that length of time, the action of the rain, the frost, and the sun will have completely destroyed every sign that these places once existed. Besides, the continents we now know may have sunk and new ones appeared. How could we locate the ruin of Pittsburgh if the city were at the bottom of the Atlantic? A million years ago there may have been huge cities on earth. Man is not necessarily the first race ever to appear on the planet.\"  Craig, listening, recognized the logic in what Michaelson had said. There might have been other races on earth! The vanity of men blinded them to that fact, when they thought about it at all. They wanted to believe they were the most important, and the only effort of creation, that the earth had come into being expressly for their benefit. Nature might have other plans.  Michaelson had suggested a logical solution for the dilemma of airplanes and flying dragons existing in the same world.  Craig saw the officers glancing uneasily in the direction from which the planes had come. Off yonder somewhere below the horizon was _something_. They were worried about it. Against the beasts of this time, the Idaho was all-powerful. But how would the Idaho stack up against the _something_ that lay below the horizon? Or would the ship be able to escape back through the time fault before the threat of the mysterious planes became greater?  Out around the ship, small boats were planting charges of explosive. One boat was dashing out to the wrecked scouting plane to rescue the pilot.  \"We have to see if we can get away from here, at once,\" Higgins said. \"We have to set off those explosives and see if they will force us back through the time fault.\"  They had to get away from this world. There was danger here. Planes that flew as fast as the one that had gone streaking off across the sky represented danger.  Higgins ordered the planting of the explosives to proceed at the double-quick.  \"I said I could definitely tell you two things,\" Michaelson spoke again. \"One of them was that we are in the past, millions of years in the past.\" He spoke slowly, his eyes on the busy boats around the ship. \"Are you not interested in the second of the two things I said I could tell you?\"  \"Yes,\" said Higgins. \"What is it?\"  The scientist sighed. \"It is that we will never be able to return to our own time!\"  \"What? But--we are planting mines. If the explosion of the Jap bombs sent us through the time fault, maybe a second explosion will send us back through it.\"  Michaelson shook his head. \"I have investigated the mathematics of it,\" he said. \"It is impossible. You might as well call in your boats and save your explosives. The fact is, we are marooned in this time, _forever_!\"  Marooned in time, forever! The words rang like bells of doom. Marooned forever. No chance of escape. No hope for escape.  \"Are you sure?\" Higgins questioned.  \"Positive,\" the scientist answered.  Craig looked at the sea. He lit a cigarette, noting that it was the last one in the package. He drew the smoke into his lungs, feeling the bite of it.  Marooned in time, forever!     CHAPTER IV  Silver on the Sea   Night had come hours ago. Craig stood on the deck, watching the sea and the sky and the stars in the sky. Up overhead the constellations had changed. They were not the familiar star clusters that he knew. Completely blacked out, the Idaho moved very slowly through the darkness. Her speed was kept to almost nothing because the charts of the navigators were useless. The charts had been made in that far future which the battle wagon had quitted forever and they revealed nothing about this sea. There might be a mile of water under the ship. She might be scraping bottom. The navigators were going mad worrying about what might be under the ship. Captain Higgins was going mad worrying not only about what might be under the ship but about what might soon be over it, when the mysterious planes returned. The pilot of the scouting plane had been rescued. He had not lived to tell what he had found.  Craig was aware of a shadow near him but he thought it was one of the crew until the match flared. It was Margy Sharp. She was lighting a cigarette.  A sharp reprimand from an officer caused her to drop the match.  \"What's wrong?\" she demanded. \"Why can't I smoke?\"  \"Blackout,\" Craig said.  \"Oh, it's _you_,\" the girl spoke.  \"Where have you been?\" Craig asked. \"I looked around for you but I couldn't find you.\"  \"In the hospital,\" she said. \"Helping out a baffled doctor.\"  \"How is English?\" Craig asked.  \"English has been dead for hours,\" she said. \"I've been with Mrs. Miller.\"  \"Oh! How is she?\"  \"Fine. But the doctor almost went nuts. He said it was the first time in naval history that a baby had been born on a battleship. He seemed to think it violated the rules of etiquette, or something. It was a girl,\" she went on, a little breathlessly now, as if talking about babies made her excited. \"Mrs. Miller said she was going to name it Margaret, after me. Isn't that nice? She says her husband will be worried to death about her and she wants to use the ship's radio to send him a message. Do you think she could do that?\"  \"Do I--\" Craig choked. \"Listen, girl, do you know what has happened?\"  The tone of his voice alarmed her. \"No,\" she said quickly. \"I don't know. What has happened?\"  She had been busy down in the hospital bay, too busy to wonder what was going on up above. Craig told her the whole story. She listened in incredulous amazement. He had to tell it twice before she began to understand it. And then she didn't believe it.  \"You're kidding me,\" she said.  \"Sorry,\" Craig answered. \"But I'm not kidding.\"  \"You mean--you actually mean we're back somewhere in the past?\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"But--but what are we going to do?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The big man shrugged. \"We're going to wait and see what happens. That's all we can do. Wait and see.\" There were tones of excitement in his voice.  \"You sound pleased about this,\" she challenged.  \"I'm not pleased,\" he quickly corrected her. \"I'm sorry for Mrs. Miller and for Margaret, for you, for Captain Higgins, and the men on the Idaho. But as for myself--well, I'm not sorry. This is the ultimate adventure. We have a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32563"],["title","The Lost Warship (#6)"],["body"," world to explore, new things to see. I know hundreds of men who would give an arm to be dropped back here into this world. I've met them in every mining camp I ever saw, in every trading post on the frontiers of civilization, in every corner of earth. They were misfits, most of them. I'm a misfit, or I was, back in our time. I didn't belong, I didn't fit in. I wasn't a business man, I never would have made a business man. I couldn't have been a lawyer or a clerk or a white-collar worker. But here--well I seem to belong here. This is my time, this is my place in the world.\" He broke off. \"I don't know why I am telling you all this,\" he said shortly.  She had listened quietly and sympathetically. \"You can tell me,\" she said. \"Remember, back in the life-boat, when I told you we were two of a kind? I didn't fit in, either, back home. I belong here too.\"  She had moved closer to him, in the soft darkness. He could sense her nearness, sense her womanliness. He started to put his arms around her.  \"Well,\" a voice said behind him.  Craig turned. Voronoff stood there. \"What do you want?\" Craig said.  \"From you, I want nothing,\" Voronoff answered. \"I was not speaking to you. I, at least, have not forgotten about the water.\"  \"The water?\" Craig said puzzled. \"What are you talking about?\"  \"The water that wasn't in the cask we had in the life-boat,\" Voronoff answered. \"The water that you drank in the night when the rest of us were asleep.\"  \"Damn you--\" Craig said.  Voronoff walked away. Craig made no attempt to follow him. He had completely forgotten about the water. With an effort, he got his temper under control and turned back to the girl.  She had turned away and was looking at the sea. When Craig spoke, she did not answer. A moment before, a warm magic had been between them. Voronoff's words had changed the warmth to coldness.         *       *       *       *       *  That night the lookouts on the Idaho were constantly reporting that the ship was being shadowed. Overhead in the darkness were planes, silent planes. The lookout occasionally spotted them against the moon.  The fact that the planes flew silently, like shadows in the night, perturbed the lookouts and their uneasiness was communicated to the crew. No one would have much minded planes that made the proper amount of noise, but ghost planes that made no noise at all were dreadful things. The silent planes scouted the ship, then seemed to disappear. At least they were no longer visible, but whether or not they were still hidden somewhere in the sky, no one knew. They made no attempt to bomb the ship, or to attack it in any way. This seemed ominous.  The Idaho carried four planes of her own. One had been lost. Before dawn, Captain Higgins ordered another catapulted into the sky, to search the surrounding area. This plane went aloft. It was not attacked or molested. The pilot, by radio, reported the presence of a large body of land very near. Navigators, consulting their charts, discovered that this body of land was not on any of their maps.  Dawn, that hour of danger when an attack might reasonably be expected, came. The crew of the Idaho stood by their guns, waiting. No attack came.  The sun rose. Still there was no attack. The ship, moving very slowly, entered an area where the surface of the sea seemed to have turned to silver. This effect was caused by some oily substance that floated on the water, a new phenomenon to officers and men alike.  On the horizon the land mass the pilot of the scouting plane had reported was dimly visible, a range of forested hills sloping upward to mountains in the background, the rim of some mighty continent of the old time. Later, millions of years later, only the tops of these mountains would remain above the sea, to form the thousands of islands of the Pacific.         *       *       *       *       *  Craig breakfasted below. He came on deck just as the alarm sounded. The crew raced to their stations. He discovered the cause of the alarm.  Overhead, at a height of thirty to thirty-five thousand feet, was a plane. It was shadowing the ship. It made no attempt to attack. Craig went to the bridge. Captain Higgins had been on the bridge all night. He was still there. He greeted Craig wanly.  \"We're being watched,\" Higgins said. \"I don't like it.\"  \"Anything we can do about it?\"  Higgins squinted upward through his glasses. \"Too high for ack-ack. No, there is nothing we can do about it. And I'm not sure we want to do anything about it.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"We're not fighting a war here in _this_ time,\" the captain answered. \"We don't want to fight, if we can possibly avoid it.\"  \"It may be a problem to avoid fighting,\" Craig said. \"Remember, they shot down the pilot of your scouting plane.\"  \"I remember,\" Higgins said grimly.  \"Of course, we could surrender,\" Craig suggested.  \"How would you like to go to hell?\" Higgins said.  \"It was only an idea,\" Craig grinned. \"But I don't like this business. We don't know what we're trying to avoid fighting, or what strength they have, or how they will attack, if they attack.\"  \"I don't like it either,\" Higgins answered. \"But I didn't choose it. Damn them, if they're going to attack, I wish they would get on with it!\"  Over the huge ship the tiny plane circled. Every man on the Idaho knew the situation was nasty. They were being watched. There was nothing they could do to stop it. The shadowing plane was above anti-aircraft fire. The warship could not hide from it. There was no protecting destroyer to lay a friendly smoke screen to shield them from the eyes in the sky. Meanwhile, somewhere around them a hidden enemy might be marshalling forces to destroy them.  \"Have you tried to contact them?\" Craig asked.  \"I tried to reach them by radio all last night,\" Higgins answered. \"There was no answer. The radio operators say there are no signals in the air. This, plus the fact that they have not attempted to answer our signals, forces me to the conclusion that they have not discovered radio. Of course they may use wave bands beyond the range of out receivers--Hello! What's that?\"  From somewhere near them a shout had sounded.  Leaning over the edge of the bridge, Craig saw a sailor on the lower deck. The man was also leaning over pointing down toward the sea. He shouted again and turned upward toward the bridge. His face was white with terror.  \"What is it?\" Captain Higgins demanded.  \"It's--It's that silver stuff on the surface, sir,\" the sailor answered. \"It's--it's eating the sides of the ship sir. It's eating the ship.\"  The Idaho was still in the area of the bright substance that floated on the surface of the sea. Captain Higgins raced from the bridge down to the main deck. Craig followed him. By the time they reached the spot where the sailor was standing several other officers had gathered. They were all staring down at the sea.  Craig leaned over the rail, looked down. Horror tightened an iron band around his heart.         *       *       *       *       *  At the waterline, a great gash had been eaten into the steel hull of the Idaho. The plates of the ship were the best grade of chrome steel, heat-treated and hardened. They were designed to withstand the battering of sixteen-inch shells. The steel in them was the toughest metal that had ever come out of Pittsburgh.  Where the oily, shiny substance touched it, the steel was crumbling away.  \"Acid!\" Craig heard an officer gasp. \"That's what the silver stuff is. Acid! They sprayed it on the sea.\"  \"They plotted our course and set a booby-trap for us.\"  \"That can't be an acid,\" someone protested. \"It is impossible to secure a concentration of acid on the surface of the sea strong enough to eat holes in steel.\"  \"Maybe it's impossible but it sure as hell has happened!\"  Each passing wave tossed the oily liquid against the hull of the Idaho. It hissed softly when it struck and promptly began its deadly work. What was happening below the waterline was not visible. Probably no damage was being done there because the acid was on the surface and did not touch the areas below the waterline. But enough damage was being done above the water! Pits two inches deep were already appearing in the steel sides of the ship.  \"Full speed ahead!\" Captain Higgins ordered.  Their hope was to get out of the area covered by the acid and to get out of it quickly. But--the patch of silver was miles in extent. And there was no way to determine exactly how much damage had been done to the ship. The line of corrosion extending around the hull might have weakened her so badly that she was unseaworthy.  Captain Higgins took the only possible course. He ordered the ship to make for land.         *       *       *       *       *  Two hours later the Idaho was resting in a natural harbor between low hills. A river emptied into the sea here. Captain Higgins had grown years older as he took the ship into the mouth of the harbor. He had no charts of the place, no way of knowing how much water was available, or whether there were hidden reefs waiting to rip the bottom out of the ship. He took her in blind, the hardest job any ship's master ever has to face.  Like a wounded lion, the Idaho was seeking a place where she could lie up and determine how badly she had been hurt. In entering the harbor she was going into what might easily be a death trap but if she stayed outside, her weakened hull might give away and she might go down with all hands.  Higgins sent his engineers in boats to determine how much damage had been done to the hull. With his officers, he waited on the bridge for the engineers to report. There was none of the acid on the surface of the harbor.  Craig heard the chief engineer report.  \"The hull is so weak that the ship may sink at any moment, sir. An effort to move her might crumble the plates. Holes in the sides six to eight inches deep, sir.\"  The captain's hands on the rail of the bridge tightened until the knuckles showed white.  \"Very well,\""]]]
