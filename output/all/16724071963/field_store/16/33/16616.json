I believe that the major-and-minor key with its transpositional relations, our \"twelve-semitone system,\" exhibits such a case of falling behind.                             *       *       *  That some few have already felt how the intervals of the Series of Seven might be differently arranged (graduated) is manifested in isolated passages by Liszt, and recently by Debussy and his following, and even by Richard Strauss. Strong impulse, longing, gifted instinct, all speak from these strains. Yet it does not appear to me that a conscious and orderly conception of this intensified means of expression had been formed by these composers.  I have made an attempt to exhaust the possibilities of the arrangement of degrees within the seven-tone scale; and succeeded, by raising and lowering the intervals, in establishing _one hundred and thirteen different scales_. These 113 scales (within the octave _C-C_) comprise the greater part of our familiar twenty-four keys, and, furthermore, a series of new keys of peculiar character. But with these the mine is not exhausted, for we are at liberty to _transpose_ each one of these 113, besides the blending of two such keys in harmony and melody.  There is a significant difference between the sound of the scale _c-d♭-e♭-f♭-g♭-a♭-b♭-c_ when _c_ is taken as tonic, and the scale of _d♭_ minor. By giving it the customary _C_-major triad as a fundamental harmony, a novel harmonic sensation is obtained. But now listen to this same scale supported alternately by the _A_-minor, _E♭_-major, and _C_-major triads, and you cannot avoid a feeling of delightful surprise at the strangely unfamiliar euphony.  But how would a lawgiver classify the tone-series _c-d♭-e♭-f♭-g-a-b-c_, _c-d♭-e♭-f-g♭-a-b-c_, _c-d-e♭-f♭-g♭-a-b-c_, _c-d♭-e-f-g♭-a-b♭-c_?--or these, forsooth: _c-d-e♭-f♭-g-a♯-b-c_, _c-d-e♭-f♭-g♯-a-b-c_, _c-d♭-e♭-f♯-g♯-a-b♭-c_?  One cannot estimate at a glance what wealth of melodic and harmonic expression would thus be opened up to the hearing; but a great many novel possibilities may be accepted as certain, and are perceptible at a glance.                             *       *       *  With this presentation, the unity of all keys may be considered as finally pronounced and justified. A kaleidoscopic blending and interchanging of twelve semitones within the three-mirror tube of Taste, Emotion, and Intention--the essential feature of the harmony of to-day.                             *       *       *  The harmony of _to-day_, and not for long; for all signs presage a revolution, and a next step toward that \"eternal harmony.\" Let us once again call to mind, that in this latter the gradation of the octave is _infinite_, and let us strive to draw a little nearer to infinitude. The tripartite tone (third of a tone) has for some time been demanding admittance, and we have left the call unheeded. Whoever has experimented, like myself (in a modest way), with this interval, and introduced (either with voice or with violin) two equidistant intermediate tones between the extremes of a whole tone, schooling his ear and his precision of attack, will not have failed to discern that tripartite tones are wholly independent intervals with a pronounced character, and not to be confounded with ill-tuned semitones. They form a refinement in chromatics based, as at present appears, on the whole-tone scale. Were we to adopt them without further preparation, we should have to give up the semitones and lose our \"minor third\" and \"perfect fifth;\" and this loss would be felt more keenly than the relative gain of a system of eighteen one-third tones.  But there is no apparent reason for giving up the semitones for the sake of this new system. By retaining, for each whole tone, a semitone, we obtain a second series of whole tones lying a semitone higher than the original series. Then, by dividing this second series of whole tones into third-tones, each third-tone in the lower series will be matched by a semitone in the higher series.  Thus we have really arrived at a system of whole tones divided into sixths of a tone; and we may be sure that even sixth-tones will sometime be adopted into musical speech. But the tonal system above sketched must first of all train the hearing to thirds of a tone, without giving up the semitones.  To summarize: We may set up either two series of third-tones, with an interval of a semitone between the series; or, the usual semitonic series _thrice repeated_ at the interval of one-third of a tone.  Merely for the sake of distinction, let us call the first tone _C_, and the next third-tones _C♯_, and _D♭_; the first semitone (small) _c_, and its following thirds _c♯_ and _d♭_; the result is fully explained by the table below:  [Music]  A preliminary expedient for notation might be, to draw six lines for the staff, using the lines for the whole tones and the spaces for the semitones:  [Music]  then indicating the third-tones by sharps and flats:  [Music]  The question of notation seems to me subordinate. On the other hand, the question is important and imperious, how and on what these tones are to be produced. Fortunately, while busied with this essay, I received from America direct and authentic intelligence which solves the problem in a simple manner. I refer to an invention by Dr. Thaddeus Cahill.[Q] He has constructed a comprehensive apparatus which makes it possible to transform an electric current into a fixed and mathematically exact number of vibrations. As pitch depends on the number of vibrations, and the apparatus may be \"set\" on any number desired, the infinite gradation of the octave may be accomplished by merely moving a lever corresponding to the pointer of a quadrant.    [Q] \"New Music for an Old World.\" Dr. Thaddeus Cahill's Dynamophone,   an extraordinary electrical invention for producing scientifically   perfect music. Article in McClure's Magazine for July, 1906, by Ray   Stannard Baker. Readers interested in the details of this invention   are referred to the above-mentioned magazine article.  Only a long and careful series of experiments, and a continued training of the ear, can render this unfamiliar material approachable and plastic for the coming generation, and for Art.                             *       *       *  And what a vista of fair hopes and dreamlike fancies is thus opened for them both! Who has not dreamt that he could float on air? and firmly believed his dream to be reality?--Let us take thought, how music may be restored to its primitive, natural essence; let us free it from architectonic, acoustic and esthetic dogmas; let it be pure invention and sentiment, in harmonies, in forms, in tone-colors (for invention and sentiment are not the prerogative of melody alone); let it follow the line of the rainbow and vie with the clouds in breaking sunbeams; _let Music be naught else than Nature mirrored by and reflected from the human breast_; for it is sounding air and floats above and beyond the air; within Man himself as universally and absolutely as in Creation entire; for it can gather together and disperse without losing in intensity.                             *       *       *  IN his book \"Beyond the Good and the Bad\" (_Jenseits von Gut und Böse_) Nietzsche says: \"With regard to German music I consider precaution necessary in various ways. Assuming that a person loves the South (as I love it) as a great training-school for health of soul and sense in their highest potency, as an uncontrollable flood and glamour of sunshine spreading over a race of independent and self-reliant beings;--well, such an one will learn to be more or less on his guard against German music, because, while spoiling his taste anew, it undermines his health.  \"Such a Southlander (not by descent, but by belief) must, should he dream of the future of music, likewise dream of a redemption of music from the North, while in his ears there rings the prelude to a deeper, mightier, perchance a more evil and more mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, wither and die away in view of the blue, sensuous sea and the splendor of Mediterranean skies, as all German music does;--a super-European music, that asserts itself even amid the tawny sunsets of the desert, whose soul is allied with the palm-tree, and can consort and prowl with great, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey.  \"I could imagine a music whose rarest charm should consist in its complete divorce from the Good and the Bad;--only that its surface might be ruffled, as it were, by a longing as of a sailor for home, by variable golden shadows and tender frailties:--an Art which should see fleeing toward it, from afar off, the hues of a perishing moral world become wellnigh incomprehensible, and which should be hospitable and profound enough to harbor such belated fugitives.\"  And Tolstoi transmutes a landscape-impression into a musical impression when he writes, in \"Lucerne\": \"Neither on the lake, nor on the mountains, nor in the skies, a single straight line, a single unmixed color, a single point of repose;--everywhere movement, irregularity, caprice, variety, an incessant interplay of shades and lines, and in it all the reposefulness, softness, harmony and inevitableness of Beauty.\"  Will this music ever be attained?  \"Not all reach Nirvana; but he who, gifted from the beginning, learns everything that one ought to learn, experiences all that one should experience, renounces what one should renounce, develops what one should develop, realizes what one should realize--he shall reach Nirvana.\"[R] (Kern, _Geschichte des Buddhismus in Indien_.)    [R] As if anticipating my thoughts, M. Vincent d'Indy has just written   me: \"... laissant de côté les contingences et les petitesses de la   vie pour regarder constamment vers un idéal qu'on ne pourra jamais   atteindre, mais dont il est permis de se rapprocher.\"  If Nirvana be the realm \"beyond the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31799"],["title","Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music (#5)"],["body","and the Bad,\" _one_ way leading thither is here pointed out. A way to the very portal. To the bars that divide Man from Eternity--or that open to admit that which was temporal. Beyond that portal sounds _music_. Not the strains of \"musical art.\"[S]--It may be, that we must leave Earth to find that music. But only to the pilgrim who has succeeded on the way in freeing himself from earthly shackles, shall the bars open.    [S] I think I have read, somewhere, that Liszt confined his Dante   Symphony to the two movements, _Inferno_ and _Purgatorio_, \"because   our tone-speech is inadequate to express the felicities of Paradise.\"     ADDENDA   FEELING--like honesty--is a moral point of honor, an attribute of whose possession no one will permit denial, which claims a place in life and art alike. But while, in life, a want of feeling may be forgiven to the possessor of a more brilliant attribute, such as bravery or impartial justice, in art feeling is held to be the highest moral qualification.  In music, however, feeling requires two consorts, taste and style. Now, in life, one encounters real taste as seldom as deep and true feeling; as for style, it is a province of art. What remains, is a species of pseudo-emotion which must be characterized as lachrymose hysteria or turgidity. And, above all, people insist upon having it plainly paraded before their eyes! It must be underscored, so that everybody shall stop, look, and listen. The audience sees it, greatly magnified, thrown on the screen, so that it dances before the vision in vague, importunate vastness; it is cried on the streets, to summon them that dwell remote from art; it is gilded, to make the destitute stare in amaze.  For in life, too, the _expressions_ of feeling, by mien and words, are oftenest employed; rarer, and more genuine, is that feeling which acts without talk; and most precious is the feeling which hides itself.  \"Feeling\" is generally understood to mean tenderness, pathos, and extravagance, of expression. But how much more does the marvelous flower \"Emotion\" enfold! Restraint and forbearance, renunciation, power, activity, patience, magnanimity, joyousness, and that all-controlling intelligence wherein feeling actually takes its rise.  It is not otherwise in Art, which holds the mirror up to Life; and still more outspokenly in Music, which repeats the emotions of Life--though for this, as I have said, taste and style must be added; Style, which distinguishes Art from Life.  What the amateur and the mediocre artist attempt to express, is feeling in little, in detail, for a short stretch.  Feeling on a grand scale is mistaken by the amateur, the semi-artist, the public (and the critics too, unhappily!), for a want of emotion, because they all are unable to hear the longer reaches as parts of a yet more extended whole. Feeling, therefore, is likewise economy.  Hence, I distinguish feeling as Taste, as Style, as Economy. Each a whole in itself, and each one-third of the Whole. Within and over them rules a subjective trinity: Temperament, Intelligence, and the instinct of Equipoise.  These six carry on a dance of such subtility in the choice of partners and intertwining of figures, in the bearing and the being borne, in advancing and curtesying, in motion and repose, that no loftier height of artistry is conceivable.  When the chords of the two triads are in perfect tune, Fantasy may--nay, must--associate with Feeling; supported by the Six, she will not degenerate, and out of this combination of all the elements arises Individuality. The individuality catches, like a lens, the light-impressions, reflects them, according to its nature, as a negative, and the hearer perceives the true picture.                             *       *       *  In so far as taste participates in feeling, the latter--like all else--alters its forms of expression with the period. That is, one aspect or another of feeling will be favored at one time or another, onesidedly cultivated, especially developed. Thus, with and after Wagner, voluptuous sensuality came to the fore; the form of _intensification of passion_ is still unsurmounted by contemporary composers. On every tranquil beginning followed a swift upward surge. Wagner, in this point insatiable, but not inexhaustible, turned from sheer necessity to the expedient, after reaching a climax, of starting afresh softly, to soar to a sudden new intensification.  Modern French writers exhibit a revulsion; their feeling is a reflexive chastity, or perhaps rather a restrained sensualism; the upstriving mountain-paths of Wagner are succeeded by monotonous plains of twilight uniformity.  Thus \"style\" forms itself out of feeling, when led by taste.                             *       *       *  The \"Apostles of the Ninth Symphony\" have devised the notion of \"depth\" in music. It is still current at face-value, especially in Germanic lands.  There is a depth of feeling, and a depth of thought; the latter is literary, and can have no application to tones. Depth of feeling, by contrast, is psychical, and thoroughly germane to the nature of music. The Apostles of the Ninth Symphony have a peculiar and not quite clearly defined estimate of \"depth\" in music. _Depth_ becomes _breadth_, and the attempt is made to attain it through _weight_; it then discovers itself (through an association of ideas) by a preference for a _deep register_, and (as I have had opportunity to observe) by the insinuation of a second, mysterious notion, usually of a literary sort. If these are not the sole specific signs, they are the most important ones.  To every disciple of philosophy, however, depth of feeling would seem to imply exhaustiveness in feeling, a complete absorption in the given mood.  Whoever, surrounded by the full tide of a genuine carnival crowd, slinks about morosely or even indifferently, neither affected nor carried away by the tremendous self-satire of mask and motley, by the might of misrule over law, by the vengeful feeling of wit running riot, shows himself incapable of sounding the depths of feeling. This gives further confirmation of the fact, that depth of feeling roots in a complete absorption in the given mood, however frivolous, and blossoms in the interpretation of that mood; whereas the current conception of deep feeling singles out only one aspect of feeling in man, and specializes that.  In the so-called \"Champagne Aria\" in Don Giovanni there lies more \"depth\" than in many a funeral march or nocturne:--Depth of feeling also shows in not wasting it on subordinate or unimportant matters.                             *       *       *  ROUTINE is highly esteemed and frequently required; in musical \"officialdom\" it is a _sine qua non_. That routine in music should exist at all, and, furthermore, that it can be nominated as a condition in the musician's bond, is another proof of the narrow confines of our musical art. Routine signifies the acquisition of a modicum of experience and artcraft, and their application to all cases which may occur; hence, there must be an astounding number of analogous cases. Now, I like to imagine a species of art-praxis wherein each case should be a new one, an exception! How helpless and impotent would the army of practical musicians stand before it!--in the end they would surely beat a retreat, and disappear. Routine transforms the temple of art into a factory. It destroys creativeness. For creation means, the bringing form out of the void; whereas routine flourishes on imitation. It is \"poetry made to order.\" It rules because it suits the generality: In the theatre, in the orchestra, in virtuosi, in instruction. One longs to exclaim, \"Avoid routine! Let each beginning be, as had none been before! Know nothing, but rather think and feel! For, behold, the myriad strains that once shall sound have existed since the beginning, ready, afloat in the æther, and together with them other myriads that shall never be heard. Only stretch forth your hands, and ye shall grasp a blossom, a breath of the sea-breeze, a sunbeam; avoid routine, for it strives to grasp only that wherewith your four walls are filled, and the same over and over again; the spirit of ease so infects you, that you will scarcely leave your armchairs, and will lay hold only of what is nearest to hand. And myriad strains are there since the beginning, still waiting for manifestation!\"                             *       *       *  \"It is my misfortune, to possess no routine,\" Wagner once wrote Liszt, when the composition of \"Tristan\" was making no progress. Thus Wagner deceived himself, and wore a mask for others. He had too much routine, and his composing-machinery was thrown out of gear, just when a tangle formed in the mesh which only inspiration could unloose. True, Wagner found the clew when he succeeded in throwing off routine; but had he really never possessed it, he would have declared the fact without bitterness. And, after all, this sentence in Wagner's letter expresses the true artist-contempt for routine, inasmuch as he waives all claim to a qualification which he thinks meanly of, and takes care that others may not invest him with it. This self-praise he utters with a mien of ironic desperation. He is, in very truth, unhappy that composition is at a standstill, but finds rich consolation in the consciousness that his genius is above the cheap expedients of routine; at the same time, with an air of modesty, he sorrowfully confesses that he has not acquired a training belonging to the craft.  The sentence is a masterpiece of the native cunning of the instinct of self-preservation; but equally proves--and that is our point--the pettiness of routine in creative work.                             *       *       *  RESPECT the Pianoforte! Its disadvantages are evident, decided, and unquestionable: The lack of sustained tone, and the pitiless, unyielding adjustment of the inalterable semitonic scale.  But its advantages and"]]]
