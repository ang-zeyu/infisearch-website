Romantic as this Kensington wood was, however, it was not lonely.  We came on many groups both coming and going, or wandering in the edges of the wood.  Amongst these were many children from six or eight years old up to sixteen or seventeen.  They seemed to me to be especially fine specimens of their race, and enjoying themselves to the utmost; some of them were hanging about little tents pitched on the greensward, and by some of these fires were burning, with pots hanging over them gipsy fashion.  Dick explained to me that there were scattered houses in the forest, and indeed we caught a glimpse of one or two.  He said they were mostly quite small, such as used to be called cottages when there were slaves in the land, but they were pleasant enough and fitting for the wood.  \"They must be pretty well stocked with children,\" said I, pointing to the many youngsters about the way.  \"O,\" said he, \"these children do not all come from the near houses, the woodland houses, but from the country-side generally.  They often make up parties, and come to play in the woods for weeks together in summer-time, living in tents, as you see.  We rather encourage them to it; they learn to do things for themselves, and get to notice the wild creatures; and, you see, the less they stew inside houses the better for them.  Indeed, I must tell you that many grown people will go to live in the forests through the summer; though they for the most part go to the bigger ones, like Windsor, or the Forest of Dean, or the northern wastes.  Apart from the other pleasures of it, it gives them a little rough work, which I am sorry to say is getting somewhat scarce for these last fifty years.\"  He broke off, and then said, \"I tell you all this, because I see that if I talk I must be answering questions, which you are thinking, even if you are not speaking them out; but my kinsman will tell you more about it.\"  I saw that I was likely to get out of my depth again, and so merely for the sake of tiding over an awkwardness and to say something, I said--  \"Well, the youngsters here will be all the fresher for school when the summer gets over and they have to go back again.\"  \"School?\" he said; \"yes, what do you mean by that word?  I don't see how it can have anything to do with children.  We talk, indeed, of a school of herring, and a school of painting, and in the former sense we might talk of a school of children--but otherwise,\" said he, laughing, \"I must own myself beaten.\"  Hang it! thought I, I can't open my mouth without digging up some new complexity.  I wouldn't try to set my friend right in his etymology; and I thought I had best say nothing about the boy-farms which I had been used to call schools, as I saw pretty clearly that they had disappeared; so I said after a little fumbling, \"I was using the word in the sense of a system of education.\"  \"Education?\" said he, meditatively, \"I know enough Latin to know that the word must come from _educere_, to lead out; and I have heard it used; but I have never met anybody who could give me a clear explanation of what it means.\"  You may imagine how my new friends fell in my esteem when I heard this frank avowal; and I said, rather contemptuously, \"Well, education means a system of teaching young people.\"  \"Why not old people also?\" said he with a twinkle in his eye.  \"But,\" he went on, \"I can assure you our children learn, whether they go through a 'system of teaching' or not.  Why, you will not find one of these children about here, boy or girl, who cannot swim; and every one of them has been used to tumbling about the little forest ponies--there's one of them now!  They all of them know how to cook; the bigger lads can mow; many can thatch and do odd jobs at carpentering; or they know how to keep shop.  I can tell you they know plenty of things.\"  \"Yes, but their mental education, the teaching of their minds,\" said I, kindly translating my phrase.  \"Guest,\" said he, \"perhaps you have not learned to do these things I have been speaking about; and if that's the case, don't you run away with the idea that it doesn't take some skill to do them, and doesn't give plenty of work for one's mind: you would change your opinion if you saw a Dorsetshire lad thatching, for instance.  But, however, I understand you to be speaking of book-learning; and as to that, it is a simple affair. Most children, seeing books lying about, manage to read by the time they are four years old; though I am told it has not always been so.  As to writing, we do not encourage them to scrawl too early (though scrawl a little they will), because it gets them into a habit of ugly writing; and what's the use of a lot of ugly writing being done, when rough printing can be done so easily.  You understand that handsome writing we like, and many people will write their books out when they make them, or get them written; I mean books of which only a few copies are needed--poems, and such like, you know.  However, I am wandering from my lambs; but you must excuse me, for I am interested in this matter of writing, being myself a fair-writer.\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"about the children; when they know how to read and write, don't they learn something else--languages, for instance?\"  \"Of course,\" he said; \"sometimes even before they can read, they can talk French, which is the nearest language talked on the other side of the water; and they soon get to know German also, which is talked by a huge number of communes and colleges on the mainland.  These are the principal languages we speak in these islands, along with English or Welsh, or Irish, which is another form of Welsh; and children pick them up very quickly, because their elders all know them; and besides our guests from over sea often bring their children with them, and the little ones get together, and rub their speech into one another.\"  \"And the older languages?\" said I.  \"O, yes,\" said he, \"they mostly learn Latin and Greek along with the modern ones, when they do anything more than merely pick up the latter.\"  \"And history?\" said I; \"how do you teach history?\"  \"Well,\" said he, \"when a person can read, of course he reads what he likes to; and he can easily get someone to tell him what are the best books to read on such or such a subject, or to explain what he doesn't understand in the books when he is reading them.\"  \"Well,\" said I, \"what else do they learn?  I suppose they don't all learn history?\"  \"No, no,\" said he; \"some don't care about it; in fact, I don't think many do.  I have heard my great-grandfather say that it is mostly in periods of turmoil and strife and confusion that people care much about history; and you know,\" said my friend, with an amiable smile, \"we are not like that now.  No; many people study facts about the make of things and the matters of cause and effect, so that knowledge increases on us, if that be good; and some, as you heard about friend Bob yonder, will spend time over mathematics.  'Tis no use forcing people's tastes.\"  Said I: \"But you don't mean that children learn all these things?\"  Said he: \"That depends on what you mean by children; and also you must remember how much they differ.  As a rule, they don't do much reading, except for a few story-books, till they are about fifteen years old; we don't encourage early bookishness: though you will find some children who _will_ take to books very early; which perhaps is not good for them; but it's no use thwarting them; and very often it doesn't last long with them, and they find their level before they are twenty years old.  You see, children are mostly given to imitating their elders, and when they see most people about them engaged in genuinely amusing work, like house- building and street-paving, and gardening, and the like, that is what they want to be doing; so I don't think we need fear having too many book- learned men.\"  What could I say?  I sat and held my peace, for fear of fresh entanglements.  Besides, I was using my eyes with all my might, wondering as the old horse jogged on, when I should come into London proper, and what it would be like now.  But my companion couldn't let his subject quite drop, and went on meditatively:  \"After all, I don't know that it does them much harm, even if they do grow up book-students.  Such people as that, 'tis a great pleasure seeing them so happy over work which is not much sought for.  And besides, these students are generally such pleasant people; so kind and sweet tempered; so humble, and at the same time so anxious to teach everybody all that they know.  Really, I like those that I have met prodigiously.\"  This seemed to me such very queer talk that I was on the point of asking him another question; when just as we came to the top of a rising ground, down a long glade of the wood on my right I caught sight of a stately building whose outline was familiar to me, and I cried out, \"Westminster Abbey!\"  \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"Westminster Abbey--what there is left of it.\"  \"Why, what have you done with it?\" quoth I in terror.  \"What have _we_ done with it?\" said he; \"nothing much, save clean it.  But you know the whole outside was spoiled centuries ago: as to the inside, that remains in its beauty after the great clearance, which took place over a hundred years ago, of the beastly monuments to fools and knaves, which once blocked it up, as great-grandfather says.\"  We went on a little further, and I looked to the right again, and said, in rather a doubtful tone of voice, \"Why, there are the Houses of Parliament!  Do you still use them?\"  He burst out laughing, and was some time before he could control himself; then he clapped me on the back and said:  \"I take you, neighbour; you may well wonder at our keeping them standing, and I know something about that, and my old kinsman has given me books to read about the strange game that they played there.  Use them!  Well, yes, they are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],["title","News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#6)"],["body","for a sort of subsidiary market, and a storage place for manure, and they are handy for that, being on the waterside.  I believe it was intended to pull them down quite at the beginning of our days; but there was, I am told, a queer antiquarian society, which had done some service in past times, and which straightway set up its pipe against their destruction, as it has done with many other buildings, which most people looked upon as worthless, and public nuisances; and it was so energetic, and had such good reasons to give, that it generally gained its point; and I must say that when all is said I am glad of it: because you know at the worst these silly old buildings serve as a kind of foil to the beautiful ones which we build now.  You will see several others in these parts; the place my great-grandfather lives in, for instance, and a big building called St. Paul's.  And you see, in this matter we need not grudge a few poorish buildings standing, because we can always build elsewhere; nor need we be anxious as to the breeding of pleasant work in such matters, for there is always room for more and more work in a new building, even without making it pretentious.  For instance, elbow-room _within_ doors is to me so delightful that if I were driven to it I would most sacrifice outdoor space to it.  Then, of course, there is the ornament, which, as we must all allow, may easily be overdone in mere living houses, but can hardly be in mote-halls and markets, and so forth.  I must tell you, though, that my great-grandfather sometimes tells me I am a little cracked on this subject of fine building; and indeed I _do_ think that the energies of mankind are chiefly of use to them for such work; for in that direction I can see no end to the work, while in many others a limit does seem possible.\"     CHAPTER VI: A LITTLE SHOPPING   As he spoke, we came suddenly out of the woodland into a short street of handsomely built houses, which my companion named to me at once as Piccadilly: the lower part of these I should have called shops, if it had not been that, as far as I could see, the people were ignorant of the arts of buying and selling.  Wares were displayed in their finely designed fronts, as if to tempt people in, and people stood and looked at them, or went in and came out with parcels under their arms, just like the real thing.  On each side of the street ran an elegant arcade to protect foot-passengers, as in some of the old Italian cities.  About halfway down, a huge building of the kind I was now prepared to expect told me that this also was a centre of some kind, and had its special public buildings.  Said Dick: \"Here, you see, is another market on a different plan from most others: the upper stories of these houses are used for guest-houses; for people from all about the country are apt to drift up hither from time to time, as folk are very thick upon the ground, which you will see evidence of presently, and there are people who are fond of crowds, though I can't say that I am.\"  I couldn't help smiling to see how long a tradition would last.  Here was the ghost of London still asserting itself as a centre,--an intellectual centre, for aught I knew.  However, I said nothing, except that I asked him to drive very slowly, as the things in the booths looked exceedingly pretty.  \"Yes,\" said he, \"this is a very good market for pretty things, and is mostly kept for the handsomer goods, as the Houses-of-Parliament market, where they set out cabbages and turnips and such like things, along with beer and the rougher kind of wine, is so near.\"  Then he looked at me curiously, and said, \"Perhaps you would like to do a little shopping, as 'tis called.\"  I looked at what I could see of my rough blue duds, which I had plenty of opportunity of contrasting with the gay attire of the citizens we had come across; and I thought that if, as seemed likely, I should presently be shown about as a curiosity for the amusement of this most unbusinesslike people, I should like to look a little less like a discharged ship's purser.  But in spite of all that had happened, my hand went down into my pocket again, where to my dismay it met nothing metallic except two rusty old keys, and I remembered that amidst our talk in the guest-hall at Hammersmith I had taken the cash out of my pocket to show to the pretty Annie, and had left it lying there.  My face fell fifty per cent., and Dick, beholding me, said rather sharply--  \"Hilloa, Guest! what's the matter now?  Is it a wasp?\"  \"No,\" said I, \"but I've left it behind.\"  \"Well,\" said he, \"whatever you have left behind, you can get in this market again, so don't trouble yourself about it.\"  I had come to my senses by this time, and remembering the astounding customs of this country, had no mind for another lecture on social economy and the Edwardian coinage; so I said only--  \"My clothes--Couldn't I?  You see--What do think could be done about them?\"  He didn't seem in the least inclined to laugh, but said quite gravely:  \"O don't get new clothes yet.  You see, my great-grandfather is an antiquarian, and he will want to see you just as you are.  And, you know, I mustn't preach to you, but surely it wouldn't be right for you to take away people's pleasure of studying your attire, by just going and making yourself like everybody else.  You feel that, don't you?\" said he, earnestly.  I did _not_ feel it my duty to set myself up for a scarecrow amidst this beauty-loving people, but I saw I had got across some ineradicable prejudice, and that it wouldn't do to quarrel with my new friend.  So I merely said, \"O certainly, certainly.\"  \"Well,\" said he, pleasantly, \"you may as well see what the inside of these booths is like: think of something you want.\"  Said I: \"Could I get some tobacco and a pipe?\"  \"Of course,\" said he; \"what was I thinking of, not asking you before? Well, Bob is always telling me that we non-smokers are a selfish lot, and I'm afraid he is right.  But come along; here is a place just handy.\"  Therewith he drew rein and jumped down, and I followed.  A very handsome woman, splendidly clad in figured silk, was slowly passing by, looking into the windows as she went.  To her quoth Dick: \"Maiden, would you kindly hold our horse while we go in for a little?\"  She nodded to us with a kind smile, and fell to patting the horse with her pretty hand.  \"What a beautiful creature!\" said I to Dick as we entered.  \"What, old Greylocks?\" said he, with a sly grin.  \"No, no,\" said I; \"Goldylocks,--the lady.\"  \"Well, so she is,\" said he.  \"'Tis a good job there are so many of them that every Jack may have his Jill: else I fear that we should get fighting for them.  Indeed,\" said he, becoming very grave, \"I don't say that it does not happen even now, sometimes.  For you know love is not a very reasonable thing, and perversity and self-will are commoner than some of our moralists think.\"  He added, in a still more sombre tone: \"Yes, only a month ago there was a mishap down by us, that in the end cost the lives of two men and a woman, and, as it were, put out the sunlight for us for a while.  Don't ask me about it just now; I may tell you about it later on.\"  By this time we were within the shop or booth, which had a counter, and shelves on the walls, all very neat, though without any pretence of showiness, but otherwise not very different to what I had been used to. Within were a couple of children--a brown-skinned boy of about twelve, who sat reading a book, and a pretty little girl of about a year older, who was sitting also reading behind the counter; they were obviously brother and sister.  \"Good morning, little neighbours,\" said Dick.  \"My friend here wants tobacco and a pipe; can you help him?\"  \"O yes, certainly,\" said the girl with a sort of demure alertness which was somewhat amusing.  The boy looked up, and fell to staring at my outlandish attire, but presently reddened and turned his head, as if he knew that he was not behaving prettily.  \"Dear neighbour,\" said the girl, with the most solemn countenance of a child playing at keeping shop, \"what tobacco is it you would like?\"  \"Latakia,\" quoth I, feeling as if I were assisting at a child's game, and wondering whether I should get anything but make-believe.  But the girl took a dainty little basket from a shelf beside her, went to a jar, and took out a lot of tobacco and put the filled basket down on the counter before me, where I could both smell and see that it was excellent Latakia.  \"But you haven't weighed it,\" said I, \"and--and how much am I to take?\"  \"Why,\" she said, \"I advise you to cram your bag, because you may be going where you can't get Latakia.  Where is your bag?\"  I fumbled about, and at last pulled out my piece of cotton print which does duty with me for a tobacco pouch.  But the girl looked at it with some disdain, and said--  \"Dear neighbour, I can give you something much better than that cotton rag.\"  And she tripped up the shop and came back presently, and as she passed the boy whispered something in his ear, and he nodded and got up and went out.  The girl held up in her finger and thumb a red morocco bag, gaily embroidered, and said, \"There, I have chosen one for you, and you are to have it: it is pretty, and will hold a lot.\"  Therewith she fell to cramming it with the tobacco, and laid it down by me and said, \"Now for the pipe: that also you must let me choose for you; there are three pretty ones just come in.\"  She disappeared again, and came back with a big-bowled pipe in her hand, carved out of some hard wood very elaborately, and mounted in gold sprinkled with little gems.  It was, in short, as pretty and gay a toy as I had ever seen; something like the best kind of Japanese work, but better.  \"Dear me!\" said I, when I set eyes on it, \"this is altogether too grand for me, or for anybody but the Emperor of the World.  Besides, I shall lose it: I always lose my pipes.\"  The child seemed rather dashed, and said, \"D"]]]
