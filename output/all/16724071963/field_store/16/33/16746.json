Time paused, and the next moment he knew he had returned to Thone. The sounds of the alien city floated up to him and he stirred.  He grasped the sides of his coffinlike bed with fingers that had lost their sense of touch. He pulled himself up to a sitting position and looked about him. On one side stood Lima, though now her features were not those of the implacable, merciless mystic, but rather those of a woman in love.  She smiled happily and said, \"At last you have returned.\"  Bennett strove to move his tongue and lips to ask questions, but they refused, as though numbed by long inaction. He turned to his other side and gazed questioningly at the replica of Tournay who stood there.  Tournay's image spoke. \"We had quite a time bringing you back, Sire. But now it has been accomplished--for good.\"  Striving to move his throat muscles, Bennett finally forced a sound, and then words, through his lips.  \"Tell me,\" he pleaded. \"Who are you? And, more important, who am I?\"  He turned to Lima for an answer, realizing that now she would help him if anyone would.  \"Doctor Tournay will explain it to you,\" Lima replied, indicating the dark man.  Imploringly, Bennett turned back to face Tournay.  \"I see that very little of your memory has returned yet,\" Tournay said. \"In a short while, everything--all your past--will come back to you. Until then, perhaps I had better explain to you who you are. My words will help trigger your returning memory, and speed up the process.\"  \"Please do,\" Bennett begged.  \"You are Benn Ett, _Le Roy_ of the city-state of Thone, in the year 4526 A. D. Six months ago, the strain of governing the city began to undermine your health. Acting under my advice, you decided to take a somno-rest cure.  \"This rest cure,\" the doctor continued, \"is quite standard practice in our time. We had a little difficulty bringing you out of it at the end of six months. Evidently your somno-existence must have been very pleasant.\"  \"Do you mean that the existence I remember was merely an induced figment of my imagination?\"  \"Yes. You see, the best rest that can be given a mind is to give it not sleep, but pleasant work. Therefore, under my manipulation, you were given a pseudo-existence in a past era of history. You were led to conceive yourself as occupying a position, which, after close study, I deduced would be the most suitable and relaxing for you.\"  \"But if that is true, why did my dream have to end so unpleasantly--I might say, so nearly fatally?\" Bennett demanded.  \"The more successful I am in choosing a pleasant existence for a patient in the somno, the more difficult it is to bring him out of it,\" the doctor replied. \"Your unconscious mind, realizing how happy you were in your simulated existence, and how it would have to return to the rigor and stress which unnerved it before, fought with all its strength to remain where the somno had placed it.  \"The usual practice in bringing a patient back to reality is for the doctor to enter the dream and convince him, by whatever means may be necessary, to return. Sometimes, however, the patient is so firmly tied to his somno-existence that drastic measures must be used. This is usually done by means of making the somno-existence so anxiety-producing that the patient is glad to return.  \"Your particular release was one of the most difficult that I have ever encountered. In fact, I was unable to bring you back myself, and asked your wife, Lima, to enter the somno with me and help force you to return.\"  Bits of recollection, which had been edging into Bennett's memory, burst through in full force, and he remembered. It was true. He _was_ Benn Ett, _Le Roy_ of the city-state of Thone.  He turned to Lima and, as he read the glad light in her eyes, he knew that she had witnessed the return of his complete memory.  \"Welcome home,\" she said.                                                        --CHARLES V.

THE DICTATOR                                    _By_                             _Milton Lesser_        Ellaby's society was a perfect democracy, where all men were      equal. But some still wanted more personal attention, and      they got it,  like--         *       *       *       *       *     Just looking at Ellaby, you could tell he was going places. He was five feet nine inches tall and weighed a hundred and fifty pounds. He had an I. Q. of ninety-eight point five-seven, less than four hundredths off the mode. His hair was mousey and worn slightly long for a man, slightly short for a woman. Back in High Falls, where he was born, he was physically weaker than sixty percent of the men but stronger than sixty percent of the women.  He had been in training since his twentieth birthday to assassinate the Dictator. Ellaby was now thirty years old.  Dorcas Sinclair met Ellaby at the pneumo-station. She was too big and strapping for a woman, but otherwise not unattractive with her lusterless hair, slightly thick-featured face, small sagging bosom and heavy-calved legs.  \"I'll take your bags,\" she told Ellaby, and led him from the station. She walked quickly, but not too quickly. You always had to find the happy medium, thought Ellaby. For Ellaby, finding the happy medium had always come easy. Ten years ago, when Ellaby had been graduated from the High Falls secondary school, the four words MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED had been printed under his picture in the yearbook. It was expected by everyone: young Ellaby had learned his three R's--rules, rights, responsibilities--satisfactorily. Ellaby had neither excelled nor failed: he was by nature a first class citizen.  Running to keep up with the too big, too long-legged Dorcas Sinclair who was carrying one of his suitcases in each hand, Ellaby was led from the pneumo-station. The splendid, unimaginative geometric precision of the Capitol stretched out before him in the dazzling summer sunlight, the view serving as a leaven for Ellaby's usually phlegmatic disposition. He could feel his spirits rise, his heart thump more rapidly, speeding the sudden flow of adrenalin through his body.  [Illustration]  This was the city. It was here where the fruits of whatever had gone wrong in Ellaby's upbringing or whatever had gone wrong in the linear arrangement of his genes would ripen. It was here where Ellaby, modal Ellaby would pass his tests for top-secret work; unsuspected, average Ellaby, would write his name in flaming letters across the pages of history. It was here where Ellaby would kill the Dictator.  And after that--what? Chaos? A new order based not on modality but something else? Ellaby wasn't sure. No one in the organization knew for sure. The concept was staggering to Ellaby. It was the system--or nothing. Well, let the others worry about it. They did the planning. Ellaby was only the executioner.         *       *       *       *       *  The house was like all the others on the block, all the others in the Capitol, a grimly solid structure of lets-pretend brick fronting on a street which faded into distant haze, straight as a ruled line, to north and south, crossing the east-west avenues at precise right angles every five hundred feet. The grid pattern city, Ellaby remembered from his rights course in school, (every man has the right to a room and bath in any city as long as he is employed) made the best use of available space for houses. The strip city is unnecessary in time of peace--was there ever, had there ever been any other time? the radial city is preferred for rapid transportation, being the accepted pattern in the great economic hubs and ports like Greater New York and Hampton Roads.  \"You will have to live here with me\" Dorcas Sinclair told Ellaby, \"until you pass your tests for employment. I don't have to tell you how much depends on the outcome of those tests, Ellaby.\"  \"But I can't fail them. I thought you knew my record.\"  With an unnerving unmodal violence, Dorcas Sinclair's strong fingers dug into the flabby muscle of Ellaby's upper arm. \"Well, you had better not,\" she said, her large teeth hardly parting to let the sounds out.  Ellaby was suddenly alarmed. He had had very little truck with people of this sort. They were as unpredictable as the weather in High Falls which having a population under twenty-five thousand, had never qualified for weather control. Unlike modal man, they had never been exhaustively studied. Their likes and dislikes were not catered to, but their passions couldn't be predicted, either.  \"Ease up, Dorcas,\" a deep voice said from the doorway leading to the kitchen.  Ellaby stared in that direction gratefully. It was indecent for a woman, for anyone, to expose her emotions that way. Ellaby was almost inclined to thank the stranger.  \"Stranger, nothing!\" Ellaby blurted aloud. Ellaby's face reddened and he apologized. \"I didn't mean to raise my voice,\" he explained. \"You surprised me.\"  \"I guess you didn't expect to find me here, at that. You haven't changed much, Ellaby.\"  Automatically, Ellaby mumbled his thanks for the compliment. Sam Mulden, though, had changed. He'd always been a radical. He wore his hair cropped too short. He was tall and thin, his elbows and knees exposed by the tunic he wore like knots on gnarled, living wood. Mulden looked older. He hadn't bothered to dye his graying hair, or to smooth the premature wrinkles on his long-nosed, thin-lipped face. He was smiling sardonically at Ellaby now, as if he could read Ellaby's mind. \"I might have known it would be you,\" he said. \"As soon as they said the assassin was coming from High Falls, I should have guessed.\"  \"Why?\" asked Ellaby. It was a question which had nudged for ten years at his docile patience. When people go out of their way to train you, though, to spend ten years teaching you every inch of Capitol territory without once taking you there, to make you proficient with various deadly weapons although your reflexes are splendidly modal, to teach you meaningless phrases like democratic inequality (?) and individuality (?) and the right to live a self-directed (?) life, to make your own decisions (?), when people act, in short, like a very thorough government school, even if their motives seem strangely misdirected, you don't question them.  \"For two reasons,\" Mulden said. \"You can understand the first, Ellaby. If the second one bothers you, forget it. In the first place, you're so perfectly modal, the government would never suspect you. In the second place, you're so well adjusted you're bound to follow our instructions.\"  \"Or any instructions,\" Dorcas Sinclair said. \"That's what I'm afraid of, Mulden.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ellaby still couldn't get over it. He never expected to find poor, unfortunate Sam Mulden in such a high position in the organization or anywhere. He remembered Mulden clearly from their school days together. Mulden was a character, a real character. Physically, he was barely acceptable: more than eighty percent of the men and some sixty-five percent of the women were able to knock Mulden down in the High Falls gymnasium classes. But mentally Mulden was a misfit. His I. Q. was in the neighborhood of a hundred and fifty. His gangling, ineffectual physique wasn't too far below the mode, but mentally he soared intolerably above it.  Now Mulden told Dorcas Sinclair, \"Don't worry about that. We've had ten years to work on him. They can't undo it in a few days. Ellaby, you are quite sure you know what you must do?\"  \"Oh, yes. Tomorrow morning I will take my security tests. According to the record of my previous physical and mental testing, I should make top secret classification. I will work here in the capitol. I will find the Dictator and kill him. The only thing that bothers me is I don't know who to look for. What does the Dictator look like?\"  \"Didn't they explain all of that to you in High Falls?\" the woman asked irritably, without even making an effort to poker her face.  \"Ease off,\" Mulden told her for the second time. \"He's confused. Listen to me, Ellaby. Don't you remember? The Dictator never makes public appearances.\"  \"Yes. Yes, now I remember. No one knows what the Dictator looks like. He keeps to himself. He issues orders which are instantly obeyed, helping to maintain universal modality in the country. It almost seems a shame I'll have to kill him.\"  \"So we've pavloved him for ten years, have we?\" Dorcas Sinclair raged. Ellaby turned away in embarrassment. \"Damn you, Mulden, he still questions it!\"  \"He's supposed to,\" Mulden explained quietly. \"If he accepted what we told him, he'd go around talking about it naively. This way, he understands the necessity for secrecy.\"  \"He doesn't understand--\"  \"Well, then he realizes it. Let him get some sleep, will you? Tomorrow's going to be a good day for us, a big day for him. Good night, Ellaby. If you want anything, Sinclair will get it for you.\"  Ellaby assured them he would want nothing except a simple meal of whatever most people in the Capitol ate on Wednesdays. It turned out to be pork chops, which Ellaby neither particularly liked nor disliked. He chewed his food with the proper lack of enthusiasm and retired early.         *       *       *       *       *  The next morning, Ellaby took his I. Q. test at the Capitol personnel bureau. He was slightly above average in space perception but slightly below average in comparisons. He hoped his anxiety didn't show on his face. If anyone asked him why he had come to the Capitol he was ready to blurt out the reason and have done with it. He wondered what Sam Mulden would have thought if he knew. The Sinclair woman would have been furious.  No one asked Ellaby."]]]
