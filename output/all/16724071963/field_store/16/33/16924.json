CHAPTER IV   It did not stay lost for long. Shearing was at the controls. The chronometer showed fourteen hours and twenty-seven minutes since they left the _Happy Dream_. Shearing had spent eight of those hours in a species of comatose slumber, from which he had roused out practically normal. Now Hyrst was heavily asleep in the pneumo-chair beside him.  Shearing punched him. \"Wake up.\"  After several more punches Hyrst groaned and opened his eyes. He mumbled a question, and Shearing pointed out the wide curved port that gave full vision forward and on both sides.  \"It was a good try,\" he said, \"but I don't think we're going to make it. Look there. No, farther back. See it? Now the other side. And there's one astern.\"  Still sleepy, but alarmed, Hyrst swung his mental vision around. It was easier than looking. Two fast, powerful tugs from the _Happy Dream_, and Bellaver's yacht. He frowned in heavy concentration. \"Bellaver's aboard. He's got a mighty goose-egg on his head. Vernon too, with his shields up tight. The three accurate men and the pilot--his nose is a thing of beauty--plus crew. Nine in all. Two men each to the tugs. The other Lazarite, the one I laid out--he's not along.\"  Shearing nodded approvingly. \"You're getting good. Now take a glance at our fuel-tanks and tell me what you see.\"  Hyrst sat up straight, fully awake. \"Practically,\" he said, \"nothing.\"  \"This skiff was meant for short hops only. We've got enough for perhaps another forty-five minutes, less if we get too involved. They're faster than we are, so they'll catch up to us--oh, say in about half an hour. We have friends coming--\"  \"Friends?\"  \"Certainly. You don't think we let each other down, do you? Not the brotherhood. But they had to come from a long way off. We can't possibly rendezvous under an hour and a half, maybe more if--\"  \"I know,\" said Hyrst. \"If we all get involved.\" He looked out the port. In the beginning, following directions from the young woman--whose name he had never thought to ask--he had set a course that plunged him deep into one of the wildest sectors of the Belt. He was not a pilot. He could, like most men of his time, handle a simple craft under simple conditions, but these conditions were not simple. The skiff's radar was short-range and it had no automatic deflection reflexes. Hyrst had had to fly on ESP, spotting meteor swarms, asteroids, debris of all sorts in this poetically named hell-hole, the Path of Minor Worlds, and then figuring out how to get by, through, or over them without a crash. Shearing had relieved him just in time.  He glowered at the whirling, glittering mess outside, the dust, the shards and fragments of a shattered world. It merged into mist and his mind was roving again. Shearing jockeyed the controls. He was flying esper too. The tugs and Bellaver's fast yacht were closing up the gap. The level in the tanks went down, used up not in free fall but in the constant maneuvering.  Hyrst swung mentally inboard to check vac-suits and equipment in the locker, and then out again. His vision was strong and free. He could look at the Sun, and see the splendid fires of the corona. He could look at Mars, old and cold and dried-up, and at Jupiter, massive and sullen and totally useless except as an anchor for its family of crazy moons. He could look farther than that. He could look at the stars. In a little while, he thought, he could look at whole galaxies. His heart pounded and the breath came hot and hard into his lungs. It was a good feeling. It made all that had gone before almost worthwhile. The primal immensities drew him, the black gulfs lit with gold and crimson and peacock-colored flames. He wanted to go farther and farther, into--  \"You're learning too fast,\" said Shearing dryly. \"Stick to something small and close and sordid, namely an asteroid where we can land.\"  \"I found one,\" said Hyrst. \"There.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Shearing followed his mental nudge. \"Hell,\" he said, \"couldn't you have spotted something better? These Valhallas give me the creeps.\"  \"The others within reach are too small, or there's no cover. We'll have quite a little time to wait. I take it you would like to be alive when your friends come.\"  Vernon's thought broke in on them abruptly. \"You have just one chance of that, and that's to give yourselves up, right now.\"  \"Does the socially-conscious Mr. Bellaver still want to give me that job?\" asked Hyrst.  \"I'm warning you,\" said Vernon.  \"Your mind is full of hate,\" said Hyrst. \"Cleanse it.\" He shut Vernon out as easily as hanging up a phone. Under stress, his new powers were developing rapidly. He felt a little drunk with them. Shearing said, \"Don't get above yourself, boy. You're still a cub, you know.\" Then he grinned briefly and added, \"By the way, thanks.\"  Hyrst said, \"I owed it to you. And you can thank your lady friend, too. She had a big hand in it.\"  \"Christina,\" said Shearing softly. \"Yes.\"  He dropped the skiff sharply in a descending curve, toward the asteroid.  \"Do you think,\" said Hyrst, \"you could now tell me what the devil this is all about?\"  Shearing said, \"We've got a starship.\"  Hyrst stared. For a long time he didn't say anything. Then, \"You've got a starship? But nobody has! People talk of someday reaching other stars, but nobody tried yet, nobody _could_ try--\" He broke off, suddenly remembering a dark, lonely ship, and a woman with angry eyes watching it. Even in his astonishment, things began to come clearer to him. \"So that's it--a starship. And Bellaver wants it?\"  Shearing nodded.  \"Well,\" said Hyrst. \"Go on.\"  \"You've already developed some amazing mental capabilities since you came back from beyond the door. You'll find that's only the beginning. The radiation, the exposure--something. The simple act of pseudo-death, perhaps. Anyway, the brain is altered, stepped up, a great deal of its normally unused potential released. You've always been a fair-to-middling technician. You'll find your rating boosted, eventually, to the genius level.\"  The skiff veered wildly as Shearing dodged a whizzing chunk of rock the size of a skyscraper.  \"That's one reason,\" he said, \"why we wanted to get you before Bellaver did. The number of technicians undergoing the Humane Penalty is quite small. We--the brotherhood--need all of them we can get.\"  \"But that wasn't the main reason you wanted me?\" pressed Hyrst.  Shearing looked at him. \"No. We wanted you mainly because you were present when MacDonald died. Handled right--\"  He paused. The asteroid was rushing at them, and Bellaver's ships were close behind. Hyrst was already in a vac-suit, all but the helmet.  \"Take the controls,\" said Shearing. \"As she goes. Don't worry, I'll make the landing.\" He pulled the vac-suit on. \"Handled right,\" he said, \"you might be the key to that murder, and to the mystery behind it that the brotherhood _must_ solve.\"  He took the controls again. They helped each other on with their helmets. The asteroid filled the port, a wild, weird jumble of vari-colored rock.  \"I don't see how,\" said Hyrst, into his helmet mike.  \"Latent impressions,\" answered Shearing briefly, and sent the skiff skittering in between two great black monoliths, to settle with a jar on a pan of rock as smooth and naked as a ballroom floor.  \"Make it fast,\" said Shearing. \"They're right on top of us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The skiff, designed as Sheering had said for short hops, could not accommodate the extra weight and bulk of an airlock. You were supposed to land in atmosphere. If you didn't, you just pushed a release-button and hung on. The air was exhausted in one whistling swoosh that took with it everything loose. The moisture in it crystallized instantly, and before this frozen drift had even begun to settle, Hyrst and Shearing were on their way.  They crossed the rock pan in great swaggering bounds. The gravity was light, the horizon only twenty or so miles away. Literally in his mind's eye Hyrst could see the three ships arrowing at them. He opened contact with Vernon, knowing Shearing had done so too. Vernon had been looking for them.  \"Mr. Bellaver still prefers to have you alive,\" he said. \"If you'll wait quietly beside the skiff, we'll take you aboard.\"  Shearing gave him a hard answer.  \"Very well,\" said Vernon. \"Mr. Bellaver wants me to make it clear to you that he doesn't intend for you to get away. So you can interpret that as you please. Be seeing you.\"  He broke contact, knowing that Hyrst and Shearing would close him out. From now on, Hyrst realized, he would keep track of them the way he and Shearing had kept track of obstructions in the path of flight, by mental \"sight\". The yacht was extremely close. Suddenly Hyrst had a confused glimpse of a hand on a control-lever over-lapped by a view of the black-mouthed tubes of the yacht's belly-jets. He dived, literally, into a crack between one of the monoliths and a slab that leaned against its base, dragging Shearing with him.  The yacht swept over. Nothing happened. It dropped out of sight, braking for a landing.  \"Imagination,\" said Shearing. \"You realize a possibility, and you think it's so. Tricky. But I don't blame you. The safe side is the best one.\"  Hyrst looked out the crack. One of the tugs was coming in to land beside the skiff, while the other one circled.  \"Now what?\" he said. \"I suppose we can dodge them for a while, but we can't hide from Vernon.\"  Shearing chuckled. He had got his look of tough competence back. He seemed almost to be enjoying himself. \"I told you you were only a cub. How do you suppose we've kept the starship hidden all these years? Watch.\"  In the flick of a second Hyrst went blind and deaf. Then he realized that it was only his mental eyes and ears that were blanked out as though a curtain had been drawn across them. His physical eyes were still clear and sharp, and when Shearing's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32486"],["title","The Legion of Lazarus (#5)"],["body"," voice came over the helmet audio he heard it without trouble.  \"This is called the cloak. I suppose you could call it an extension of the shield, though it's more like a force field. It's no bar to physical vision, and it has the one great disadvantage of being opaque both ways to mental energy. But it does act as a deflector. If Vernon follows us now, he'll have to do it the hard way. Stick close by me, so I don't have too wide a spread. And it'll be up to you to lead. I can't do both. Let's go.\"  Hyrst had, unconsciously, become so used to his new perceptions that it made him feel dull and helpless to be without them. He led off down one of the smooth rock avenues, going away from the skiff and the tug which had just landed.  On either side of the avenue were monoliths, irregularly spaced and of different sizes and heights but following an apparently orderly plan. The light of the distant sun lay raw and blinding on them, casting shadows as black and sharp-edged as though drawn upon the rock with india ink.  You could see faces in the monoliths. You could see mighty outlines, singly and in groups, of gods and beasts and men, in combat, in suppliance, in death and burial. That was why these asteroids were called Valhallas. Twenty-six of them had been found so far, and studied, and still no one could say certainly whether or not the hands of any living beings had fashioned them. They might be actual monuments, defaced by cosmic dust, by collision with the myriad fragments of the Belt, by time. They might be one of Nature's casual jokes, created by the same agencies. No actual tombs had been found, nor tools, nor definitely identifiable artifacts. But still the feeling persisted, in the airless silence of the avenues, that some passing race had paused and wrought for itself a memorial more enduring than its fame, and then gone on into the great galactic sea, never to return.         *       *       *       *       *  Hyrst had never been on a Valhalla before. He understood why Shearing had not wanted to land and he wished now that they hadn't. There was something overwhelmingly sad and awesome about these leaning, towering figures of stone, moving forever in their lonely orbit, going nowhere, returning to nowhere.  Then he saw the second tug overhead. He forgot his daydreams. \"They're going to act as a spotter,\" he said. Shearing grunted but did not speak. His whole mind was concentrated on maintaining the cloak. Hyrst stopped him still in the pitchy shadow under what might have been a kneeling woman sixty feet high. He watched the tug. It lazed away, circling slowly, and he did not think it had seen them. He could not any longer see the place where they had landed, but he assumed that by now the yacht had looped back and come in--if not there somewhere close by. They could figure on nine to eleven men hunting them, depending on whether they left the ships guarded or not. Either way, it was too many.  \"Listen,\" he said aloud to Shearing. \"Listen, I want to ask you. What you said about latent impressions--you think I might have seen and heard the killer even though I was unconscious?\"  \"Especially heard. Possible. With your increased power, and ours, impressions received through sense-channels but not recognized at the time or remembered later might be recovered.\" He shook his head. \"Don't bother me.\"  \"I just wanted to know,\" said Hyrst. He thought of his son, and the two daughters he hoped he would never see. He thought of Elena. It was too late to do anything for her, but the others were still living. So was he, and he intended to stay that way, at least until he had done what he set out to do.  \"Old Bellaver was behind that killing, wasn't he? Old Quentin, this one's grandfather.\"  \"Yes. Don't bother me.\"  \"One thing more. Do we Lazarites live longer than men?\"  Shearing gave him a curious, brief look. \"Yes.\"  The tug was out of sight behind a massive rearing shape that seemed to clutch a broken ship between its paws. Symbolic, perhaps, of space? Who knew? Hyrst led Shearing in wild impala-like leaps across an open space, and into a narrow way that twisted, filled with darkness, among the bases of a group that resembled an outlandish procession following a king.  \"How much longer?\"  \"Humane Penalty first came in a hundred and fourteen years ago, right? After Seitz' method was perfected for saving spacemen. I was one of the first they used it on.\"  \"My God,\" said Hyrst. Yet, somehow, he was not as surprised as he might have been.  \"I've aged,\" said Shearing apologetically. \"I was only twenty-seven then.\"  They crouched, beside a humped shape like a gigantic lizard with a long tail. The tug swung overhead and slowly on.  Hyrst said, \"Then it's possible the one who killed MacDonald is still alive?\"  \"Possible. Probable.\"  Hyrst bared his teeth, in what was not at all like a smile. \"Good,\" he said. \"That makes me happy.\"  They did not do any talking after that. They had had their helmet radios operating on practically no power at all, so that they couldn't be picked up outside a radius of a few yards, but even that might be too close, now that Bellaver's men had had time to get suited and fan out. They shut them off entirely, communicating by yanks and nudges.         *       *       *       *       *  For what seemed to Hyrst like a very long time, but which was probably less than half an hour in measured minutes, they dodged from one patch of shadow to another, following an erratic course that Hyrst thought would lead them away from the ships. Once more the tug went over, slow, and then Hyrst didn't see it again. The idea that they might have given up occurred to him but he dismissed it as absurd. With the helmet mike shut off, the silence was beginning to get on his nerves. Once he looked up and saw a piece of cosmic debris smash into a monolith. Dust and splinters flew, and a great fragment broke off and fell slowly downward, bumping and rebounding, and all of it as soundless as a dream. You couldn't hear yourself walk, you couldn't hear anything but the roar of your own breathing and the pounding of your own blood. The grotesque rocky avenues could hide an army, stealthy, creeping--  There was a hill, or at least a higher eminence, crowned with what might have been the cyclopean image of a man stretched out on a noble catafalque, with hooded giants standing by in attitudes of mourning. It seemed like the best place to stop that Hyrst had seen, with plenty of cover and a view of the surrounding area. With luck, you might stay hidden there a long time. He jogged Shearing's elbow and pointed, and Shearing nodded. There was a wide, almost circular sweep of open rock around the base of the hill. Hyrst looked carefully for the tug. There was no sign of it. He tore out across the open, with Shearing at his heels.  The tug swooped over, going fast this time. It could not possibly have missed them. Shearing dropped the cloak with a grunt. \"No use for that any more,\" he said. They bounded up the hillside and in among the mourning figures. The tug whipped around in a tight spiral and hung over the hill. Hyrst shook the sweat out of his eyes. His mind was clear again. The tug's skipper was babbling into his communicator, and in another place on the asteroid Hyrst could mentally see a thin skirmish line spread out, and in still another four men in a bunch. They all picked up and began to move, toward the hill.  Shearing said, nodding spaceward, \"Our friends are on the way. If we can hold out--\"  \"Fat chance,\" said Hyrst. \"They're armed, and all we've got is flare-pistols.\" But he looked around. His eyes detected nothing but rock, hard sunlight, and deep shadow, but his mind saw that one of the black blots at the base of the main block, the catafalque, was more than a shadow. He slid into a crack that resembled a passage, being rounded rather than ragged. Shearing was right behind him. \"I don't like this,\" he said, \"but I suppose there's no help for it.\"  The crack led down into a cave, or chamber, too irregularly shaped to be artificial, too smoothly surfaced and floored to be natural. There was nothing in it but a block of stone, nine feet or so long and about four feet wide by five feet high. It seemed to be a natural part of the floor, but Hyrst avoided it. On the opposite, the sunward side, there was a small windowlike aperture that admitted a ray of blinding radiance, sharply defined and doing nothing to illumine the dark on either side of it.  Vernon's thought came to them, hard, triumphant, peremptory. \"Mr. Bellaver says you have ten minutes to come out. After that, no mercy.\"     CHAPTER V   The minutes slid past, sections of eternity arbitrarily measured by the standards of another planet and having no relevance at all on this tiny whirling rock. The beam of light from the small aperture moved visibly across the opposite wall. Hyrst watched it, blinking. Outside, Bellaver's men were drawn up in a wide crescent across the hill in front of the catafalque. They waited.  \"No mercy,\" said Hyrst softly. \"No mercy, is it?\" He bent over and began to loosen the clamps that held the lead weights to the soles of his boots.  \"It isn't mercy we need,\" said Shearing. \"It's time.\"  \"How much?\"  \"Look for yourself.\"  Hyrst shifted his attention to space. There was a ship in it, heading toward the asteroid, and coming fast. Hyrst frowned, doing in his head without thinking about it a calculation that would have required a computer in his former life.  \"Twenty-three minutes and seventeen seconds,\" he said, \"inclusive of the four remaining.\"  He finished getting the weights off his boots. He handed one to Shearing. Then he half-climbed, half-floated up the wall and settled himself above the entrance, where there was a slight concavity in the rock to give him hold.  \"Shearing,\" he said.  \"What?\" He was settling himself beside the mouth of the crack, where a man would have to come clear inside to get a shot at him.  \"A starship"]]]
