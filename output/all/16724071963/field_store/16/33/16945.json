You never can tell a fellow by the rank insignia on his shoulders.\"  \"Quite, oh quite,\" the English-born air ace murmured absently. \"But I'm wondering why so many pilots have been ordered to Headquarters. I wonder.\"  Dawson shrugged and headed toward a war-painted staff car with a corporal driver lounging against a front fender.  \"Search me,\" he said. \"Could be that they have decided to wash out the Army Air Forces, and make ditch diggers of us all. Not a bad idea, after the flying I've seen _some_ guys do.\"  \"Yes, definitely,\" Freddy Farmer replied instantly. \"But how the deuce do you manage it, Dave? I should think the whirling prop tips would smash it.\"  \"Huh?\" Dawson ejaculated. \"Come again, Freddy? How do I manage what?\"  \"To hold a mirror out in front of you, so you can see yourself flying around!\" the English youth shot at him. \"Quite a trick, isn't it?\"  \"Bingo, and out!\" Dawson laughed. \"Okay, wise guy! That puts you one up for the day. But the sun hasn't set yet. So keep right up there on your toes, my lad. Well, this must be ours.\"  As Dave spoke the last he returned the salute of the corporal driver, who had straightened to attention.  \"This the H.Q. taxi, Corporal?\" he asked.  \"I guess you could call it that, sir,\" the non-com said with a chuckle. \"Step right in and it will take you there itself. It sure has made enough trips these last couple of days to be able to do it on its own.\"  \"Really?\" Freddy Farmer murmured. \"All Air Forces officers, Corporal?\"  \"No, not all, sir,\" the non-com replied. \"About fifty-fifty Army and Navy, sir, I'd say. Quite a bunch of them, too. I guess maybe something's being cooked up for Tojo and his boys. High time, I'm thinking, too. We're quite a few runs behind them tramps.\"  \"But we'll catch up, don't worry,\" Dawson assured him. \"They took first swings, you know, so our team will get last swings. And I do mean last swings, too.\"  The non-com driver nodded and grinned broadly. Then as he held the car door open for the pair to climb in, he let his eyes rest on their decoration ribbons.  \"Yeah, Captain,\" he grunted, \"we get last swings. But I can see that you two officers ain't been exactly hitting loud fouls every time you came up. Nailed plenty of them slant eyes, huh?\"  \"A couple, I guess,\" Dave grinned. \"But they were probably fledglings on their first time out.\"  \"Yeah, I bet, I bet!\" the corporal snorted, and slid in behind the wheel. \"Well, here goes for trip nine thousand and something!\"  Regardless of what number trip it was for that corporal, it was certainly the fastest, wildest ride that either Dawson or Freddy Farmer had ever had in a car. When they finally pulled up in front of the building that served as USAFFE Headquarters (United States Armed Forces in the Far East) they were both quite certain that they had left ten years of their lives somewhere along the road. As he climbed out, Dave took a five-dollar bill from his pocket and offered it to the driver. But the non-com shook his head.  \"That's okay, sir, and thanks just the same,\" he said. \"I used to drive a hack in New York before the draft nailed me. So I know right guys when I see them. I don't want no tip, sir.\"  \"It isn't a tip,\" Dave grinned, and dropped the bill in the driver's lap. \"Just a little something to buy stuff from the hospital canteen with while you're convalescing. Go on; keep it.\"  The non-com blinked stupidly for a moment; then his flat, freckled face cracked in a broad grin.  \"I get it, Skipper,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I won't spend _this_ in no hospital. I can drive this baby with my eyes closed.\"  \"And I think you did!\" Dave laughed at him. \"And good luck.\"  \"And good hunting for both of you, sir!\" the driver called out as Dave and Freddy went up Headquarters front steps.  Just inside the big front doors, they were buttonholed by an officer seated at a desk who wanted to know their business there. They couldn't tell him that, but they gave the officer their names, and that was good enough. In fact, it seemed to please him, for he let out a long sigh.  \"Well, thank Heaven, you're the last of the lot!\" he breathed. \"I've been seeing nothing but Army and Navy pilots--even in my dreams. Report to Room Twelve Fifty for further orders. Good luck.\"  Dave asked where he'd find Room Twelve Fifty, received the information, and started off with Freddy.  \"This is getting to make me feel not so good,\" he grunted, as he stabbed an elevator button and waited for the car to come down.  \"What do you mean?\" the English youth asked quickly. \"Have you heard something I haven't?\"  \"With your big ears?\" Dave shot at him. \"Such a question! No. I mean the parting crack everybody gives us. Good luck, good hunting, and so forth. It makes me nervous when everybody keeps wishing me good luck. Makes me feel they really do know something bad is going to pop, and they're saying to themselves, 'And he seems such a nice guy, too!\"  \"If they _know_ you they're not saying that!\" Freddy cracked back fast. \"But I get the idea of what you mean. Frankly, I'm getting to hate those two words, good luck. Half the time I fancy they're not really meant.\"  \"Boy, are you going sour in your middle age!\" Dave chuckled. \"Cheer up, pal, and--and _Good luck!_\"  Freddy glared, and he might have started things right then and there but for the fact that the elevator came down at that moment and the sliding doors parted open. A couple of minutes later they were pushing through the door of Room Twelve Fifty. It wasn't a very big room, but it seemed jammed to the ceiling with Army, Navy, and Marine Corps pilots. Both Dave and Freddy spotted several pilots whom they knew. Then, suddenly, both came to a full stop and stared pop-eyed at the far end of the room. There was a desk there manned by a couple of high ranking officers. The pilots in the room were filing past the desk, and obviously giving their names, and so forth, to the two officers. One of them was an infantry colonel, and the other was an Air Forces major. It was sight of the infantry colonel that caused both Dave and Freddy to stop dead, and gape. In short, once again they were meeting their old friend Colonel Welsh, Chief of Combined U.S. Intelligence.  \"Oh-oh!\" Dave murmured. \"Do you see what I see, Freddy?\"  \"I most certainly do,\" the English youth replied. \"Fact is, we might have guessed, what?\"  \"Yeah, something like that,\" Dawson grunted absently. \"The colonel in the flesh, huh? Well, that means there isn't any clam bake coming up, that's certain. But I guess we must have fallen down on that last job he gave us, Freddy. And he's very disappointed.\"[A]  \"Eh?\" Freddy gasped. \"What do you mean, we must have fallen down on the job? Don't be silly!\"  \"Well, look at all these other pilots here,\" Dave replied. \"Must be he doesn't think we're so hot any more, and is going to give us plenty of help on the next job--whatever it is.\"  \"Man! How some people hate themselves!\" Freddy Farmer snorted. \"But I wonder what's up; what he has up his sleeve?\"  \"Well, there's one way to find out, I guess,\" Dave grunted, and started to move. \"Get into line, here, and ask him when it comes our turn.\"  As Dave and Freddy were the last two to enter the room, and were therefore at the end of the line, the room was pretty well cleared of pilots when they reached the desk. Colonel Welsh was bent over a list of names and didn't look up.  \"Name, rank, and former unit?\" he asked mechanically.  \"Dawson, sir. Captain. Returned from special assignment in China.\"  Colonel Welsh stiffened, let his pencil drop, and looked up quickly. A broad smile of welcome lighted up his thin, sun-bronzed face. He didn't bother to reply to their salutes. He simply put out his hand.  \"So you made it, Dawson, and you, too, Farmer?\" he said. \"Good! I've been worrying you wouldn't get under the wire. How are you?\"  \"Fine, sir,\" Dave grinned as he shook hands. \"And sort of curious, of course.\"  \"Oh, quite, sir,\" Freddy echoed, and extended his hand. \"And I fancy Dawson has expressed it for both of us.\"  \"Well, stay curious for a while, boys,\" the colonel replied with a dry chuckle. \"But here, I want both of you to meet Major Taylor. He's seen a bit of action in this mess, too. Take a look at his decorations, if you don't believe me. Major Taylor, Captains Dawson and Farmer.\"  The two youths shook hands with the major, and both liked him instantly. He had twinkling grey eyes that could become as cold as ice cubes when he wanted, and a warm smile that showed he always meant what he said from the heart.  \"Big moment Number One for me today, Captains,\" he said. \"I've heard about you two plenty, of course. So I'm mighty glad to meet you. Maybe we can have fun together. With the Jap rats, I mean.\"  \"Nothing would suit me better, Major,\" Dawson replied, and meant it, too.  \"Definitely, Major,\" Freddy Farmer added. And then with a faint smile, \"But _where_, sir?\"  \"Oh, haven't I told you yet?\" Colonel Welsh spoke up with a quick laugh. \"Why, we're all making a little flight to--well, to give you something to think about, Farmer, let's call it a little flight to nowhere!\"  [Footnote A: _Dave Dawson With The Flying Tigers._]     CHAPTER FOUR  _Action Bound_   \"Flight to nowhere, eh? What the blasted blue blazes did he mean by that? Is this thing going to be fitted with wings, or something, I'd like to know?\"  It was Freddy Farmer who spoke the words. With Dave Dawson, and some two dozen Army, Navy, and Marine Corps pilots, he stood on the deck of an American destroyer steaming out of Sydney into the Tasman Sea at full knots. Just five hours ago they had met Colonel Welsh at H.Q., and--and learned nothing except that they were going on a flight to nowhere. Shortly after the Colonel had imparted to them that choice bit of \"secret information,\" he had sent them on their way to enjoy the sights of Sydney for a few hours, and then to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32542"],["title","Dave Dawson on Guadalcanal (#4)"],["body","to a certain Army pier at such and such a time.  Well, they had seen most of the sights of Sydney in a restaurant where Freddy Farmer was at least happy, because the place was stocked with far more food than he could possibly eat at one sitting. And when it was practically coming out of his ears, they left the place and took a short walk about town. At the proper time they reported to the pier where a bunch of Army, Navy, and Marine Corps pilots were already gathered. Everybody was full of questions, but there wasn't a single answer in the whole crowd. Then presently a sleek, battle grey destroyer slid in and tied up long enough for the whole gang to be taken aboard. And now the destroyer was cleaving the night-blackened waters of Sydney Harbor and sending spray flying well back over the bridge.  \"Don't ask me, sweetheart,\" Dawson grunted, and stared down at the black waters swirling past the destroyer's hull. \"Could be they're going to take us out and drown the lot of us. How do I know?\"  \"Well, you could at least be helpful enough to make a sensible guess!\" Freddy snapped. \"Confound you Yanks, anyway! I never saw such mysterious business!\"  \"Listen to the guy!\" Dawson hooted. \"You forget I've been to England, and served in the R.A.F. with you. For cat's sake, it usually takes a ton of TNT to get an Englishman to open his mouth long enough to admit that the sun is shining. Us Yanks mysterious? Pal, we're blabber-mouths compared with your British Intelligence Service. And don't argue with me, because I've had experience, I have!\"  \"Rot!\" the English youth growled. \"But never mind, anyway. The point is, where are we going?\"  Dawson said nothing. He just leaned a bit more over the chain railing, and stared down at the water.  \"Well, can't you make a guess?\" Freddy insisted.  Dave started to shake his head, but on second thought checked himself. He turned and peered at Freddy in the gloom.  \"_I_ don't have to guess, Freddy,\" he said quietly.  Young Farmer stiffened, caught his breath in a gasp, and leaned close.  \"What's that, Dave?\" he breathed excitedly. \"You know? You know where we're going?\"  \"Yes, I know,\" Dawson murmured, as though it were the most natural thing in the world for him to know. \"Sure, I know, pal.\"  Freddy Farmer waited just two split seconds before he practically exploded in a shower of small pieces.  \"Then for goodness' sake, tell me, Dave!\" he choked out. \"Don't keep me like this, blast you! _Where are we going?_\"  \"You want to know, huh?\" Dave echoed, and bent his head close to Farmer. \"You want to know where we're going? Well, see where my hand is pointing? Out there beyond the bow of this tub? Well, we're going out there, sweetheart.\"  Freddy groaned, choked and spluttered, but before he could spit out a single word, Dawson pushed back the cuff of his jacket to reveal his wrist watch. The radium-treated dial showed that it was exactly five minutes to midnight.  \"So that makes us one all for the day, Freddy,\" he chuckled. \"I told you I'd get you to bite on something before the day was over. I warned you to keep up on your toes. Okay, and not sore, huh?\"  \"Just plain disgusted, you blighter!\" Freddy snarled. \"Man! Why I put up with you day after day, I don't know!\"  \"Maybe it's love,\" Dave chuckled, and jumped quickly as the English youth aimed a booted foot.  Freddy's foot didn't connect with certain places, however. And he didn't make a second try. He simply snorted to himself and joined Dave in staring silently down at the black water flowing past. For perhaps some ten of fifteen minutes neither youth said anything. Each seemed to be quite content with his own thoughts. Eventually, though, Dave broke the silence.  \"Well, there's one thing, anyway, Freddy,\" he said. \"Wherever we're going, we're going to get there soon, I guess.\"  \"Would that be the beginning of another side-splitting act of yours?\" Freddy growled. \"And what do you mean by it, anyway?\"  \"It's the detective in me,\" Dawson replied, unruffled. \"Here we are on a destroyer heading out to sea in pitch darkness, but I haven't been assigned any place to sleep, have you?\"  \"By Jove, that's right, Dave!\" young Farmer exclaimed excitedly. \"We haven't, have we? Good grief! Do you suppose this is taking us to New Zealand, and we've got to ride on deck all the way?\"  Dawson didn't answer for a moment. He threw back his head and stared up at the trillions upon trillions of stars that glittered and gleamed in the jet black sky.  \"My celestial navigation tells me we're headed more toward New Caledonia than New Zealand,\" he said. \"But I'll bet you a pair of flying goggles that we're not going to either of those places.\"  \"I won't take the bet, because you're too blasted lucky,\" Freddy spoke up quickly. \"But anyway, why didn't you think so?\"  \"Well, I got hit by a sudden hunch, while we were waiting on the pier for this tin can to tie up,\" Dawson said slowly. \"And I got chewing the fat with some of the others there. Know something, Freddy?\"  \"Well, I will after you tell me, of course,\" the English youth replied. \"What?\"  \"Keep your shirt on; a guy has to take a breath now and then, you know!\" Dave grunted. \"Well, I didn't run into a single guy who hasn't had some experience flying off an aircraft carrier. If you want my guess, it's that this load of pilots is being taken out to some carrier force waiting way off shore.\"  \"I wonder, I wonder!\" Freddy Farmer murmured after a long pause. \"Why would a carrier force be so top hat as not to come in and get us, I'd like to know?\"  \"Call it 'high hat' next time, Freddy,\" Dave corrected gently. \"White folks will think you're English, if you--\"  \"Now, look out, my good man!\" Freddy began menacingly. \"I'll have you know that I'm--\"  \"And I don't blame you for being proud that you're English, pal,\" Dave broke in with a chuckle. \"So would I be, if I wasn't Yank. Okay, skip the funny crack. The reason a carrier force wouldn't come in to pick us up is probably because of that one word pronounced _spies_! One thing we want to keep plenty secret out here in the Southwest Pacific is the location of our carrier task forces. So we were loaded aboard this tin can at night, and are being sneaked out to one. Catch on?\"  \"Not definitely,\" Freddy Farmer muttered, and scowled in the darkness. \"Seems to me that a carrier task force at sea would have its own pilots, and what not. Besides, a lot of us aboard this destroyer are Army Air Forces pilots.\"  \"So what?\" Dave said, and shrugged. \"So maybe the Navy needs help in the air, and knows just where to get it.\"  \"Better keep those remarks under cover, or a certain Army pilot may be reported lost overboard!\"  Dave jumped straight up at the sound of the voice at his elbow, and whirled around in midair. When his feet came back on deck again he saw Colonel Welsh standing in front of him.  \"Gosh, you scared me, Colonel!\" he gasped. \"I thought a Navy pilot _had_ overheard me!\"  \"Good thing one didn't,\" the senior officer chuckled. \"Plenty of rivalry between you Army and Navy pilots. And I'm afraid there are hot heads on both sides. Well, how are you enjoying a ride on a destroyer, eh?\"  \"Oh, just too, too wonderful, sir!\" Dawson replied with a groan. \"But I didn't see you on the pier, Colonel. When did you come aboard? At the last minute?\"  \"No, I came aboard much earlier,\" the Colonel replied. \"I've been up in the commander's quarters.\"  \"Er ...\" Freddy Farmer began, and faltered. \"I mean,\" he began again, \"I don't suppose he told you, sir, where we are headed?\"  The colonel laughed and shook his head.  \"He didn't have to, Farmer,\" he replied. \"You see, I already knew. But hold on with your questions, because I don't mind telling you, now that we've shoved off. We're making for a rendezvous with a carrier task force a couple of hundred miles out to sea. We should contact it just about dawn. You chaps, if you want to sleep, will have to do it on the deck, I'm afraid. I wouldn't advise it, though, the way this ship is smashing the swells. And the commander says that it will be even rougher outside.\"  \"Thanks, I think I'll stay awake,\" Dawson laughed. Then, in a serious tone, \"And when we reach the carrier task force, sir?\"  \"Why, we go aboard, of course,\" the colonel replied. \"There are two carriers. The Hawk, and the Carson. Half of you will go to one, and half to the other.\"  \"And then, sir?\" Dave persisted.  \"For military reasons, Dawson, I'm afraid I didn't hear you,\" the senior officer replied. \"Count on it for something interesting, though. And not easy by any manner of means. Fact is, all this may be simply the beginning of a very costly waste of time, and effort.\"  The Chief of Combined U.S. Intelligence spoke the last while staring flint-eyed out over the rail, and as though he were repeating his own thoughts aloud to himself. A million questions piled up on the tip of Dave's tongue. And it was the same with Freddy Farmer. However, neither one of them spoke for fear it might stop the Colonel from saying more. However, they were both out of luck. The senior officer grunted, shook himself a little, and turned to them with a smile that showed his even white teeth even in the gloomy light.  \"Well, I wish I had time, now, to get a first-hand report from you boys of that trip to Chungking you made,\" he said. \"And your experiences with the Flying Tigers. However, I only popped out for a breath of air. There's still a lot of paper work for me to do. I'll be seeing you soon, though; don't worry. A lot of you, probably, as I'll be aboard your carrier, the Carson. Until then, good luck!\"  Dave groaned, but not loud enough for Colonel Welsh to hear as he walked away.  \"Even him!\" Dave sighed. \"Good luck to you, and good luck to you--and nuts! If anybody should suddenly say, 'Bad luck' to me just once, I think I'd keel over in a dead faint!\"  \"Oh, come off it, Dave!\" Freddy grated. \"What do you expect folks to say? Man, but you're getting to be a testy blighter! So we are"]]]
