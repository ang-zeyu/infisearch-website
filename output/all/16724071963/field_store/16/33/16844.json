Then he stammered out, \"I put the question not to damage you but Modestus.\"  Observe the man's malignant nature who does not mind acknowledging that he wished to do an injury to an exile.  Then he went on to make this fine excuse; \"He wrote in a letter which was read aloud in Domitian's presence, 'Regulus is the vilest creature that walks on two legs.'\"  Modestus never wrote a truer word.  That practically closed the conversation.  I did not wish it to go any further, so that I might not commit myself until Mauricus arrived. Moreover, I am quite aware that Regulus is a difficult bird to net.  He is rich, he is a shrewd intriguer, he has no inconsiderable body of followers and a still larger circle of those who fear him, and fear is often a more powerful factor than affection.  But, after all, these are bonds that may be shattered and weakened, for a bad man's influence is as little to be relied upon as is the man himself.  Moreover, let me repeat that I am waiting for Mauricus.  He is a man of sound judgment and sagacity, which he has learned by experience, and he can gauge what is likely to happen in the future from what has occurred in the past.  I shall be guided by him, and either strike a blow or put by my weapons just as he thinks best.  I have written you this letter because it is only right, considering our regard for one another, that you should be acquainted not only with what I have said and done, but also with my plans for the future.  Farewell.   1.VI.--TO CORNELIUS TACITUS.  You will laugh, and I give you leave to.  You know what sort of sportsman I am, but I, even I, have bagged three boars, each one of them a perfect beauty.  \"What!\" you will say, \"YOU!\"  Yes, I, and that too without any violent departure from my usual lazy ways.  I was sitting by the nets; I had by my side not a hunting spear and a dart, but my pen and writing tablets.  I was engaged in some composition and jotting down notes, so that I might have full tablets to take home with me, even though my hands were empty.  You need not shrug your shoulders at study under such conditions.  It is really surprising how the mind is stimulated by bodily movement and exercise.  I find the most powerful incentive to thought in having the woods all about me, in the solitude and the silence which is observed in hunting.  So when next you go hunting, take my advice and carry your writing tablets with you as well as your luncheon basket and your flask.  You will find that Minerva loves to wander on the mountains quite as much as Diana.  Farewell.   1.VII.--TO OCTAVIUS RUFUS.  See on what a pinnacle you have placed me by giving me the same power and royal will that Homer attributed to Jupiter, Best and Greatest:-- \"One half his prayer the Father granted, the other half he refused.\" For I too can answer your request by just nodding a yes or no.  It is open to me, especially as you press me to do so, to decline to act on behalf of the Barbici against a single individual; but I should be violating the good faith and constancy that you admire in me, if I were to accept a brief against a province to which I am bound by many friendly ties, and by the work and dangers I have often undertaken in its behalf.  So I will take a middle course, and of the alternative favours you ask I will choose the one which will commend itself both to your interest and your judgment.  For what I have to consider is not so much what will meet your wishes of the moment, but how to do that which will win the steady approval of a man of your high character.  I hope to be in Rome about the Ides of October and then join my credit with yours, and convince Gallus in person of the wisdom of my resolve, though even now you may assure him of my good intentions.  \"He spake, and Kronios nodded his dark brows.\"  Homer again, but why should I not go on plying you with Homeric lines?  You will not let me ply you with verses of your own, though I love them so well that I think your permission to quote them would be the one bribe that would induce me to appear against the Barbici.  I have almost made a shocking omission, and forgotten to thank you for the dates you sent me.  They are very fine, and are likely to prove strong rivals of my figs and mushrooms.  Farewell.   1.VIII.--TO POMPEIUS SATURNINUS.  Your letter, asking me to send you one of my compositions, came at an opportune moment, for I had just made up my mind to do so.  So you were spurring a willing horse, and you have not only spoiled your only chance of making excuses for declining, but have enabled me to press work upon you without feeling ashamed at asking the favour.  For it would be equally unbecoming for me to hesitate about accepting your offer as for you who made it to look upon it as a bore.  However, you must not expect anything of an original kind from a lazy man like me.  I shall only ask you to find time to again look through the speech which I made to my townsfolk at the dedication of the public library.  I remember that you have already criticised a few points therein, but merely in a general way, and I now beg that you will not only criticise it as a whole, but will ply your pencil on particular passages as well, in your severest manner.  For even after a thorough revision it will still be open to us to publish or suppress it as we think fit.  Very likely the revision will help us out of our hesitation and enable us to decide one way or the other.  By looking through it again and again we shall either find that it is not worth publication or we shall render it worthy by the way we revise it.  What makes me doubtful is rather the subject-matter than the actual composition.  It is perhaps a shade too laudatory and ostentatious.  And this will be more than our modesty can carry, however plain and unassuming the style in which it is written, especially as I have to enlarge on the munificence of my relatives as well as on my own.  It is a ticklish and dangerous subject, even when one can flatter one's self that there was no way of avoiding it.  For if people grow impatient at hearing the praises of others, how much more difficult must it be to prevent a speech becoming tedious when we sing our own praises or those of our family?  We look askance even at unpretentious honesty, and do so all the more when its fame is trumpeted abroad.  In short, it is only the good action that is done by stealth and passes unapplauded which protects the doer from the carping criticism of the world.  For this reason I have often debated whether I ought to have composed the speech, such as it is, simply to suit my own feelings, or whether I should have looked beyond myself to the public.  I am inclined to the former alternative by the thought that many actions which are necessary to the performance of an object lose their point and appositeness when that object is attained.  I will not weary you with examples further than to ask whether anything could have been more appropriate than my gracing in writing the reasons which prompted my generosity.  By so doing, the result was that I grew familiar with generous sentiments; the more I discussed the virtue the more I saw its beauties, and above all I saved myself from the reaction that often follows a sudden fit of open- handedness.  From all this there gradually grew up within me the habit of despising money, and whereas nature seems to have tied men down to their money bags to guard them, I was enabled to throw off the prevailing shackles of avarice by my long and carefully reasoned love of generosity.  Consequently my munificence appeared to me to be all the more worthy of praise, inasmuch as I was drawn to it by reason and not by any sudden impulse.  Again, I also felt that I was promising not mere games or gladiatorial shows, but an annual subscription for the upbringing of freeborn youths. The pleasures of the eye and ear never lack eulogists; on the contrary, they need rather to be put in the background than in the foreground by speakers:  but to obtain volunteers who will undertake the fatigue and hard work of self-culture, we have not only to offer rewards but to encourage them with the choicest addresses.  For if doctors have to coax their patients into adopting an insipid but yet wholesome diet, how much the more ought the man who is giving his fellows good advice to use all the allurements of oratory to make his hearers adopt a course which, though most useful, is not generally popular?  Especially is this the case when we have to try and convince men who have no children of the value of the boon which is bestowed on those who have, and to induce all the rest to wait patiently till their turn comes to receive the benefit now given to a few, and in the meantime show themselves fit recipients for it.  But just as then, when we wished to explain the meaning and bearing of our bounty, we were studying the common good and not seeking an opportunity for self-boasting, so now in the matter of publication we are afraid lest people should think that we have had an eye not so much to the benefit of others as to our own glorification.  Besides, we do not forget how much better it is to seek the reward of a good action in the testimony of one's conscience than in fame.  For glory ought to follow of its own accord, and not to be consciously sought for; nor, again, is a good deed any the less beautiful because owing to some chance or other no glory attends it.  Those who boast of their own good deeds are credited not so much with boasting for having done them, but with having done them in order to be able to boast of them. Consequently what would have been considered a noble action if told of by a stranger, loses its striking qualities when recounted by the actual doer.  For when men find that the deed itself is inassailable they attack the boastfulness of the doer, and hence if you commit anything to be ashamed of, the deed itself is blamed, while if you perform anything deserving of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3234"],["title","The Letters of the Younger Pliny, First Series â€” Volume 1 (#6)"],["body","ise, you are blamed for not having kept silence upon it.  Beyond all this, however, there is a special obstacle in the way of publishing the speech.  I delivered it not before the people but before the municipal corporation, not in public but in the Council Chamber.  So I am afraid that it may look inconsistent if, after avoiding the applause and cheers of the crowd when I delivered the speech, I now seek for that applause by publishing it, and if, after getting the common people, whose interests I was seeking, removed from the threshold and the walls of the Chamber--to prevent the appearance of courting popularity--I should now seem to deliberately seek the acclamations of those who are only interested in my munificence to the extent of having a good example shown them.  Well, I have told you the grounds of my hesitation, but I shall follow the advice you give me, for its weight will be reason sufficient for me.  Farewell.   1.IX.--TO MINUTIUS FUNDANUS.  It is surprising how if you take each day singly here in the city you pass or seem to pass your time reasonably enough when you take stock thereof, but how, when you put the days together, you are dissatisfied with yourself.  If you ask any one, \"What have you been doing to-day?\" he will say, \"Oh, I have been attending a coming-of-age function; I was at a betrothal or a wedding; so-and-so asked me to witness the signing of a will; I have been acting as witness to A, or I have been in consultation with B.\"  All these occupations appear of paramount importance on the day in question, but if you remember that you repeat the round day after day, they seem a sheer waste of time, especially when you have got away from them into the country; for then the thought occurs to you, \"What a number of days I have frittered away in these chilly formalities!\"  That is how I feel when I am at my Laurentine Villa and busy reading or writing, or even when I am giving my body a thorough rest and so repairing the pillars of my mind.  I hear nothing and say nothing to give me vexation; no one comes backbiting a third party, and I myself have no fault to find with any one except it be with myself when my pen does not run to my liking.  I have no hopes and fears to worry me, no rumours to disturb my rest.  I hold converse with myself and with my books.  'Tis a genuine and honest life; such leisure is delicious and honourable, and one might say that it is much more attractive than any business.  The sea, the shore, these are the true secret haunts of the Muses, and how many inspirations they give me, how they prompt my musings!  Do, I beg of you, as soon as ever you can, turn your back on the din, the idle chatter, and the frivolous occupations of Rome, and give yourself up to study or recreation.  It is better, as our friend Attilius once very wittily and very truly said, to have no occupation than to be occupied with nothingness.  Farewell.   1.X.--TO ATTIUS CLEMENS.  If ever there was a time when this Rome of ours was devoted to learning, it is now.  There are many shining lights, of whom it will be enough to mention but one.  I refer to Euphrates the philosopher.  I saw a great deal of him, even in the privacy of his home life, during my young soldiering days in Syria, and I did my best to win his affection, though that was not a hard task, for he is ever easy of access, frank, and full of the humanities that he teaches.  I only wish that I had been as successful in fulfilling the hopes he then formed of me as he has been increasing his large stock of virtues, though possibly it is I who now admire them the more because I can appreciate them the better.  Even now my appreciation is not as complete as it might be.  It is only an artist who can thoroughly judge another painter, sculptor, or image-maker, and so too it needs a philosopher to estimate another philosopher at his full merit.  But so far as I can judge, Euphrates has many qualities so conspicuously brilliant that they arrest the eyes and attention even of those who have but modest pretensions to learning.  His reasoning is acute, weighty, and elegant, often attaining to the breadth and loftiness that we find in Plato.  His conversation flows in a copious yet varied stream, strikingly pleasant to the ear, and with a charm that seizes and carries away even the reluctant hearer.  Add to this a tall, commanding presence, a handsome face, long flowing hair, a streaming white beard--all of which may be thought accidental adjuncts and without significance, but they do wonderfully increase the veneration he inspires.  There is no studied negligence in his dress, it is severely plain but not austere; when you meet him you revere him without shrinking away in awe.  His life is purity itself, but he is just as genial; his lash is not for men but for their vices; for the erring he has gentle words of correction rather than sharp rebuke.  When he gives advice you cannot help listening in rapt attention, and you hope he will go on persuading you even when the persuasion is complete.  He has three children, two of them sons, whom he has brought up with the strictest care.  His father-in-law is Pompeius Julianus, a man of great distinction, but whose chief title to fame is that though, as ruler of a province, he might have chosen a son-in-law of the highest social rank, he preferred one who was distinguished not for social dignities but for wisdom.  Yet why describe at greater length a man whose society I can no longer enjoy?  Is it to make myself feel my loss the more?  For my time is all taken up by the duties of an office--important, no doubt, but tedious in the extreme.  I sit at my magisterial desk; I countersign petitions, I make out the public accounts; I write hosts of letters, but what illiterary productions they are!  Sometimes--but how seldom I get the opportunity--I complain to Euphrates about these uncongenial duties.  He consoles me and even assures me that there is no more noble part in the whole of philosophy than to be a public official, to hear cases, pass judgment, explain the laws and administer justice, and so practise in short what the philosophers do but teach.  But he never can persuade me of this, that it is better to be busy as I am than to spend whole days in listening to and acquiring knowledge from him.  That makes me the readier to urge you, whose time is your own, to let him put a finish and polish upon you when you come to town, and I hope you will come all the sooner on that account.  I am not one of those--and there are many of them--who grudge to others the happiness they are debarred from themselves; on the contrary, I feel a very lively sense of pleasure in seeing my friends abounding in joys that are denied to me.  Farewell.   1.XI.--TO FABIUS JUSTUS.  It is quite a long time since I had a letter from you.  \"Oh,\" you say, \"there has been nothing to write about.\"  But at least you might write and say just that, or you might send me the line with which our grandfathers used to begin their letters:  \"All is well if you are well, for I am well.\"  I should be quite satisfied with so much; for, after all, it is the heart of a letter.  Do you think I am joking?  I am perfectly serious.  Pray, let me know of your doings.  It makes me feel downright uneasy to be kept in ignorance.  Farewell.   1.XII.--TO CALESTRIUS TIRO.  I have suffered a most grievous loss, if loss is a word that can be applied to my being bereft of so distinguished a man.  Corellius Rufus is dead, and what makes my grief the more poignant is that he died by his own act.  Such a death is always most lamentable, since neither natural causes nor Fate can be held responsible for it.  When people die of disease there is a great consolation in the thought that no one could have prevented it; when they lay violent hands on themselves we feel a pang which nothing can assuage in the thought that they might have lived longer.  Corellius, it is true, felt driven to take his own life by Reason--and Reason is always tantamount to Necessity with philosophers-- and yet there were abundant inducements for him to live.  His conscience was stainless, his reputation beyond reproach; he stood high in men's esteem.  Moreover, he had a daughter, a wife, a grandson, and sisters, and, besides all these relations, many genuine friends.  But his battle against ill-health had been so long and hopeless that all these splendid rewards of living were outweighed by the reasons that urged him to die.  I have heard him say that he was first attacked by gout in the feet when he was thirty-three years of age.  He had inherited the complaint, for it often happens that a tendency to disease is handed down like other qualities in a sort of succession.  While he was in the prime of life he overcame his malady and kept it well in check by abstemious and pure living, and when it became sharper in its attacks as he grew old he bore up against it with great fortitude of mind.  Even when he suffered incredible torture and the most horrible agony--for the pain was no longer confined, as before, to the feet, but had begun to spread over all his limbs--I went to see him in the time of Domitian when he was staying at his country house.  His attendants withdrew from his chamber, as they always did whenever one of his more intimate friends entered the room.  Even his wife, a lady who might have been trusted to keep any secret, also used to retire.  Looking round the room, he said:  \"Why do you think I endure pain like this so long?  It is that I may outlive that tyrant, even if only by a single day.\"  Could you but have given him a frame fit to support his resolution, he would have achieved the object of his desire.  However, some god heard his prayer and granted it, and then feeling that he could die without anxiety and as a free man ought, he snapped the bonds that bound him to life.  Though they were many, he preferred death.  His malady had become worse, though he tried to moderate "]]]
