Bob Smiles caught hold of my collar unt started to drag me toward a tree. Just as I was giving up everything for lost, up comes Jim Jones--the same man I'm going to meet here--he come runnin' up. He was dressed in full uniform as a rebel officer--gray coat unt pants, silver stars on his collar, high boots, gray slouched hat with gold cord, unt so on.  \"'Here, what is the matter? What's all this fuss in camp?' he said.  \"'We've ketched one of them Dutch Jews from St. Louis spying our camp, Major,' said Bob Smiles, letting loose of my collar to salute the Major's silver stars. 'And we are going to hang him.'{30}  \"'A spy? How do you know he's a spy?'\" asked Jim Jones.  \"'Well, he's Dutch; he's a Jew, unt he's from St. Louis. What more do you want?'\" asked Bob Smiles.  [Illustration: TRYING TO SAVE HIS NECK. 30]  The crowd yelled, unt de man with the rope went to the tree unt flung one end over a limb.  \"'His being a St. Louis Dutchman is against him,'{31} said Jim Jones, 'but his being a Jew is in his favor. A Jew don't care a blame for politics. He hain't got no principles. He'd rather make a picayune off you in a trade than have a wagon-load of principles. But you fellers have got nothing to do with spies, anyway. That's headquarters' bizniss. I'm an officer at General Price's headquarters. I'll take him up there unt examine him. Bring him along.'  \"'Go along, Jew,' said two of three of them, giving me kicks, as Bob Smiles started with me. The man with the rope stood by the tree looking very disappointed.  \"When we got near General Price's tent, Jim Jones says to the rest:  \"'You stop there. Come along with me, Jew.'  \"He took me by the collar, unt we walked toward General Price's tent. He whispered to me as we went along: 'You're all right, Rosenbaum. I know you, unt I know what you're here for. Just keep a stiff upper lip, tell your story straight, unt I'll see you through.'  [Illustration: \"I KNOW YOU, UNT WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR.\" 32]  \"That scared me worse than ever, but all that I could do was to keep up my nerve, unt play my cards coolly. We went into the General's tent, but he was busy, unt motioned us with his hand to the Adjutant-General.  \"'What's the matter?' asked the Adjutant-General, motioning me to sit down, while he went on making tally marks on a sheet of paper, as a man called off the regiments that had reported. Then he footed them all up, unt, turning to another officer, read from it so many Arkansaw regiments, so many{32} Louisianny, so many Mizzouri, so many Texas, so many batteries of artillery, unt he said to another officer as he laid the paper face down among the other papers on his table: 'Just as I told you, Colonel. We have fully 22,000 men ready for battle.' Then to us: 'Well, what can I do for you?'  \"'The boys had picked up this Jew for a spy, Colonel,' said Jim Jones, pointing to me, 'unt they{33} were about to hang him, just to pass away the afternoon more than for anything else. I took him away from them, telling them that it was your privilege to hang spies, unt you could do it according to the science of war. I brung him up here to get him away from them. After they're gone away or got interested in something else I'll take him unt put him outside of camp.'  \"'All right,\" said de Adjutant-General, without taking much interest in the matter. 'Do with him as you please. A Jew more or less isn't of any consequence. Probably he deserves hanging, though, but it isn't well to encourage the boys to hang men on sight. They're quite too ready to do that, anyway.'  \"He talked to the other man a little, unt then when he went away he turned to me, unt said, sort of lazy like, as if he didn't care anything about it:  \"'Where are you from?'  \"'From Memphis,' said I.  \"'Great place, Memphis,' said he; 'one of the thriving suburbs of Satan's Kingdom. Had lots of fun there. I know every faro bank in it, which speaks well for my memory, if not for my morals. What bizniss was you in?'  \"'Clothing,' said I.  \"'What a fool question to ask a Jew,' said he, yawning. 'Of course, you was in the clothing trade. You was born in it. All Jews have been since they gambled for the Savior's garments.'  \"'They wasn't Jews what gambled for Christ's clothes,' said I, picking up a little courage. 'They vass Romans--Italians--Dagoes.'{34}  \"'Was they?' said he. 'Well, mebbe they was. I haven't read my Bible for so long that I've clean forgot. Say, what are you doing with all them pins?'  \"The question come so unexpected that it come nearly knocking me off my base. I had calculated on almost every other possible thing, unt was ready for it, except that fool question. I thought for a minit that disappointed man by the tree with the rope was going to get his job, after all. But I gathered myself together with a jerk, unt calmly said with a smile:  \"'O, that's some of my foolishness. I can't get over being a tailor, and sticking all the pins what I find in my lapel. I must pick up every one I see.'  \"'Queer where you found them all,' said he. 'Must've brung them from Memphis with you. I can't find one in the whole camp. Our men use nails unt thorns instead of pins. I've been wanting a lot of pins for my papers. Let me have all you got. I wish you had a paper of them.'  \"I did have two or three papers in my pockets, unt first had a fool idea of offering them to him. Then I remembered that disappointed man with the rope by the tree, unt pulled the pins out of my lapels one by one unt give them to him, trying to keep count in my head as I did so.  \"'What are you doing here, anyway?' he asked as he gathered up the pins unt put them in a pasteboard box.  \"'I come here at General Pillow's orders, to pick up some Mexican silfer dollars, to buy ammunition in Mexico.  \"'Another of old blowhard Pillow's fool schemes,'{35} said he. 'I know old Pillow. I served with him in Mexico, when he dug his ditch on the wrong side of his fortification. He's probably going to do some-thing else with the dollars than buy ammunition. Old Gid Pillow's a mighty slick one, I tell you, when it comes to filling his own pockets. He's no fool there, whatever he may be in other ways. He's working some scheme to skin our men, unt making you his partner, then he'll turn around unt skin you. I'll stop it going any further by turning you out of camp, unt I ought to take away from you all the money you've gathered up, but I won't do it on one condition.'  \"'What is your condition?' said I, trying not to speak too quick.  \"'You say you are in the clothing pizniss. I want awfully a nice uniform, just like the Major's there. What's such a uniform worth?'  \"'About $75,' said I.  \"'I paid $65 for this in St. Louis,' said Jim Jones.  \"'Well, $10 is not much of a skin for a Memphis Jew,' laughed the Adjutant-General. 'I tell you what I'll do, if you'll swear by the book of Deuteronomy, unt Moses, Abraham unt Isaac, to have me inside of two weeks just such a uniform as the Major's there, I'll let you off with all the money you have made already, unt when you come back with it I'll give you written permission to trade for every silver dollar in camp.'  \"'It is a bargain,' said I.  \"'Unt it'll be a perfect fit,\" said he.  \"'Just like the paper on the wall,' said I. 'Let me{36} take your measure.'  \"I had my eye all the time on the paper he had laid carelessly down unt forgotten. I pulled my tapemeasure out. The old idee of the tailor come up. I forgot about the disappointed man with the rope by the tree, unt was my old self taking the measure of a customer. I put all the figures down on his piece of paper, without his noticing what I was using. I asked him about the lining, the trimming, unt the pockets, unt wrote them down. Then I folded up the paper unt stuck it in my breast pocket, unt my heart gave a big thump, though I kept my face straight, unt went on talking about buttons unt silk braid unt gold lace for the sleeves. I promised him he should have the uniform in the army in two weeks' time. Just then some officers come in, unt Jim Jones hurried me out. I could not understand Jim Jones. He hurried me across to a place behind the woods, where we found some horses.  \"'Untie that one unt get on quick,' he said. 'My God, you've got the thing dead to rights; you've got everything on that piece of paper. My God, what luck! Smartest thing I ever saw done. Get that paper in General Lyon's hands before midnight if you kill yourself unt horse in doing it. I'll take you out past part of the guards, unt show you how to avoid the rest. Then ride as if the devil was after you, until you reach General Lyon's tent.'  \"I was dumfounded. I looked at Jim Jones. His eyes was like fire. Then it suddenly occurred to me that Jim Jones was a spy, too.  \"As I mounted I looked back across the camp. I saw the rope still hanging from a limb of the tree,{37} and the disappointed man sitting down beside it patiently waiting.  \"That night the paper was in General Lyon's hands, unt the next night the army moved out to fight the battle of Wilson's Creek.  \"The Adjutant-General is still waiting for that uniform.\"  \"Halt, who comes there?\" called out Shorty, whose quick ears caught the sound of approaching footsteps.  \"The Officer of the Guard,\" responded from the bank of darkness in the rear.  \"Advance, Officer of the Guard, and give the countersign,\" commanded Shorty, lowering his musket to a charge bayonets.  The officer advanced, leaned over the bayonet's point, and whispered the countersign.  \"Countersign's correct,\" announced Shorty, bringing his gun to a present. \"Good evening. Lieutenant. We have got a man here who claims to belong to the Secret Service.\"  \"Yes,\" answered the officer. \"We've been expecting him all afternoon, but thought he was coming in on the other road. I'd have been around here long ago only for that. This is he, is it? Well, let's hurry in. They want you at Headquarters as soon as possible.\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31773"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 3 (#3)"],["body","\"Good night, boys,\" called out Mr. Rosenbaum as he disappeared; \"see you again soon.\"  {38}    CHAPTER III. THE DEACON GOES HOME  SHORTY FALLS A VICTIM TO HIS GAMBLING PROPENSITIES.  THE BOYS did not finish their tour of picket duty till the forenoon of the next day, and it was getting toward evening when they reached their own camp.  \"What in the world's going on at the house?\" Si asked anxiously, as they were standing on the regimental parade ground waiting to be dismissed. Strange sounds came floating from that direction. The scraping of a fiddle was mingled with yells, the rush of feet, and laughter.  \"I'll go over there and see,\" said the Deacon, who had sat down behind the line on a pile of the things they had brought back with them. He picked up the coffee-pot, the frying-pan, and one of the haversacks, and walked in the direction of the house. As he turned into the company street and came in sight of the cabin he looked for an instant, and then broke out:  \"I'm blamed if they don't seem to be havin' a nigger political rally there, with the house as campaign headquarters. Where in time could they have all come from? Looks like a crow-roost, with some o' the crows drunk.\"  Apparently, all the negro cooks, teamsters, officers' servants, and roustabouts from the adjoining camps{39} had been gathered there, with Groundhog, Pilgarlic, and similar specimens of the white teamsters among them and leading them.  [Illustration: THE NEGROES MERRYMAKING. 39]  Seated on a log were three negroes, one sawing on an old fiddle, one picking a banjo, and one playing the bones. Two negroes were in the center of a ring, dancing, while the others patted \"Juba.\" All were more or less intoxicated. Groundhog and Pilgarlic were endeavoring to get up a fight between Abraham Lincoln and another stalwart, stupid negro, and were plying them with whisky from a canteen and egging them on with words.{40}  The Deacon strode up to Groundhog and, catching him by the arm, demanded sternly:  \"What are you doing, you miserable scoundrel? Stop it at once.\"  Groundhog, who had drunk considerable himself, and was pot-valiant, shook him off roughly, saying:  \"G'way from here, you dumbed citizen. This hain't none o' your bizniss. Go back to your haymow and leave soldiers alone.\"  The Deacon began divesting himself of his burden to prepare for action, but before he could do so, Shorty rushed in, gave Groundhog a vigorous kick, and he and Si dispersed the rest of the crowd in a hurry with sharp cuffs for all they could reach. The meeting broke up without a motion to adjourn.  The Deacon caught Abraham Lincoln by the collar and shook him vigorously.  \"You black rascal,\" he said, \"what've you bin up to?\"  \"Didn't 'spect you back so soon. Boss,\" gasped the negro. \"Said you wouldn't be back till termorrer.\"  \"No matter when you expected us back,\" said the Deacon, shaking him still harder, while Si winked meaningly at Shorty. \"What d'ye mean by sich capers as this? You've bin a-drinkin' likker, you brute.\"  \"Cel'bratun my freedom,\" gasped the negro. \"Groundhog done tole me to.\"  \"I'd like to celebrate his razzled head offen him,\" exploded the Deacon. \"I'll welt him into dog's meat hash if I kin lay my hands on him. He's too mean and wuthless to even associate with mules. If I'd a{41} dog on my place as onery as he is I'd give him a button before night. He's not content with bein' a skunk himself; he wants to drag everybody else down to his level. Learnin' you to drink whisky and fight as soon as you're out o' bondage. Next thing he'll be learnin' you to steal sheep and vote for Vallandigham. I'd like to put a stone around his neck and feed him to the catfish.\"  There was something so strange and earnest about the Deacon's wrath that it impressed the negro more than any of the most terrible exhibitions of wrath that he had seen his master make. He cowered down, and began crying in a maudlin way and begging:  \"Pray God, Boss, don't be so hard on a poor nigger.\"  Si, who had learned something more of the slave nature than his father, ended the unpleasant scene by giving Abraham Lincoln a sharp slap across the hips with a piece of clapboard and ordering:  \"Pick up that camp-kettle, go to the spring and fill it, and git back here in short meter.\"  The blow came to the negro as a welcome relief. It was something that he could understand. He sprang to his feet, grinned, snatched up the campkettle, and ran to the spring.  \"I must get that man away from here without delay,\" said the Deacon. \"The influences here are awful. They'll ruin him. He'll lose his soul if he stays here. I'll start home with him to-morrow.\"  \"He'll do worse'n lose his soul,\" grumbled Shorty, who had been looking over the provisions. \"He'll lose the top of his woolly head if he brings another{42} gang o' coons around here to eat us out o' house and home. I'll be gosh durned if I don't believe they've eat up even all the salt and soap. There ain't a crumb left of anything. Talk about losin' his soul. I'd give six bits for something to make him lose his appetite.\"  \"I'll take him home to-morrow,\" reiterated the Deacon. \"I raised over 'leven hundred bushels o' corn last year, 'bout 500 o' wheat, and just an even ton o' pork. I kin feed him awhile, anyway, but I don't know as I'd chance two of him.\"  \"What'll you do if you have him and the grasshoppers the same year, Pap?\" inquired Si.  That night the Deacon began his preparations for returning home. He had gathered up many relics from the battlefield to distribute among his friends at home and decorate the family mantlepiece. There were fragments of exploded shells, some canister, a broken bayonet, a smashed musket, a solid 12-pound shot, and a quart or more of battered bullets picked up in his walks over the scenes of the heavy fighting.  \"Looks as if you were going into the junk business. Pap,\" commented Si, as the store was gathered on the floor.  The faithful old striped carpetsack was brought out, and its handles repaired with stout straps. The thrifty Deacon insisted on taking home some of Si's and Shorty's clothes to be mended. The boys protested.  \"We don't mend clothes in the army, Pap,\" said Si. \"They ain't wuth it. We just wear 'em out throw 'em away, and draw new ones.\"  The Deacon held out that his mother and sisters{43} would take great pleasure in working on such things, from the feeling that they were helping the war along. Finally the matter was compromised by putting in some socks to be darned and shirts to be mended. Then the bullets, canister, round-shot, fragments of shell, etc., were filled in.  \"I declare,\" said the Deacon dubiously, as he hefted the carpetsack. \"It's goin' to be a job to lug that thing back home. Better hire a mule-team. But I'll try it. Mebbe it'll help work some o' the stupidity out o' Abraham Lincoln.\"  The whole of Co. Q and most of the regiment had grown very fond of the Deacon, and when it was noised around that he was going, they crowded in to say good-by, and give him letters and money to take home. The remaining space in the carpetsack and all that in the Deacon's many pockets were filled with these.  The next morning the company turned out to a man and escorted him to the train, with Si and his father marching arm-in-arm at the head, the company fifers playing,       \"Ain't I glad to get out of the Wilderness,      Way down in Tennessee,\"  and Abraham Lincoln, laden with the striped carpetsack, the smashed musket and other relics, bringing up the rear, under the supervision of Shorty. Tears stood in the old man's eyes as he stood on the platform of the car, and grasped Si's and Shorty's hands in adieu. His brief farewell was characteristic of the strong, self-contained Western{44} man:  \"Good-by, boys. God bless you. Take care of yourselves. Be good boys. Come home safe after the war.\"  [Illustration: KLEGG STARTS HOME. 45]  The boys stood and watched the train with sorrowful eyes until it had passed out of sight in the woods beyond Overall's Creek, and then turned to go to their camp with a great load of homesickness weighing down their hearts.  \"Just think of it; he's going straight back to God's country,\" said someone near.  A sympathetic sigh went up from all.  \"Shet up,\" said Shorty savagely. \"I don't want to hear a word o' that kind. He pulled his hat down over his eyes, rammed his hands deep in his pockets, and strode off, trying to whistle       \"When this cruel war is over,\"  but the attempt was a dismal failure. Si separated from the crowd and joined him. They took an unfrequented and roundabout way back to camp.  \"I feel all broke up. Si,\" said Shorty. \"I wish that we were goin' into a fight, or something to stir us up.\"  Si understood his partner's mood, and that it was likely to result in an outbreak of some kind. He tried to get him over to the house, so that he could get him interested in work there.  They came to a little hidden ravine, and found it filled with men playing that most fascinating of all gambling games to the average soldier--chucka-luck. There were a score of groups, each gathered around as{45} many \"sweat-boards.\" Some of the men \"running\" the games were citizens, and some were in uniform. Each had before him a small board on which was sometimes painted, sometimes rudely marked with charcoal, numbers from 1 to 6.  On some of the boards the numbers were indicated by playing-cards, from ace to six-spot, tacked down. The man who \"ran\" the game had a dice-box, with three dice. He would shake the box, turn it upside{46} down on the board, and call upon the group in front of him to make their bets.  The players would deposit their money on the numbers that they fancied, and then, after the inquiry, \"All down?\" the \"banker\" would raise the box and reveal the dice. Those who had put their money on any of the three numbers which had turned up, would be paid, while those who bet on the other three would lose.  Chuck-a-luck was strictly prohibited in camp, but it was"]]]
