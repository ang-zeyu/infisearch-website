To be serious though--and out of order, I guess--anything in Tiger's message that I should know?\"  \"Just what we told you,\" Dave replied pleasantly. \"Our survey job is held up until Colonel Welsh arrives. Which will be midnight tonight.\"  Major Parker looked disappointed. Then he sighed, and grinned.  \"Okay,\" he said, \"we'll let it go at that. If he had wanted me to know anything, he'd have sent me a message, too. Well, as I said, the place is yours. I've got some paper work to do, so I'll have to leave you for a spell. Don't hesitate to make yourselves at home. If there is anything you want, just yell. See you later.\"  \"Yes, sir, and thanks for everything,\" Dawson said. He and Farmer also rose as the senior officer got to his feet.  \"Think nothing of it,\" the major said with a wave of his hand. \"And have fun, if you can find any fun around this place.\" With a smile and a nod, he went through the mess door.  Freddy looked at Dawson, and Dawson looked right back at him.  \"Nice enough chap, isn't he?\" the English youth finally broke the silence.  \"Yes, he's okay,\" Dawson agreed. \"I guess he is going bats down here with nothing to do. That is, nothing in his own line of work. Say, Freddy?\"  \"Yes, Dave.\"  \"How about walking down some of this swell meal, huh?\" Dave suggested. \"I could do with a walk around. And like Colonel Welsh, I'm not so keen about four walls.\"  \"A top-hole idea,\" Freddy Farmer said gravely, and brushed a couple of crumbs off the skirt of his tunic. \"I know just what you mean, old thing. I've been thinking about it myself. Yes, definitely a top-hole idea. Let's get along, shall we?\"  \"Yeah, let's,\" Dawson murmured, and led the way toward the mess door.     CHAPTER SEVEN  _Blackout_   The setting sun was turning the waters of Paria Gulf between Trinidad and Venezuela to blood red as Dawson and Farmer strolled along a footpath that skirted a huge sugar plantation close to the San Fernando field. As neither had ever set foot on Trinidad before, the many and strange sights that met their wandering gaze took up all of their attention, and the thought that was in the back of each youth's mind was not given utterance for quite some time.  Presently, though, Dawson came to a full stop, took a deep breath, and squatted down on the ground.  \"Let's rest and watch the sunset,\" he said. \"It looks like it's going to be something. Besides, that's plenty enough walking for these aged bones.\"  \"I was wondering if you were going to keep it up forever,\" Freddy Farmer grunted, and sank down beside him. \"Good grief! It does get your legs when you're not used to it.\"  \"Think of the poor infantry, and realize how lucky you are,\" Dawson chuckled. \"After all, pal, you and I were flying last night, not sleeping.\"  \"And don't I know it!\" the other youth replied. \"Can hardly keep my eyes open now. As a matter of fact, when we get back, I'm going to borrow a place from Major Parker to sleep until Colonel Welsh shows up. Blast it, Dave! I don't think I feel very friendly toward the colonel, just now. Heaven knows he's kept us in the dark once or twice in the past, but certainly nothing like this. I'm just about ready to explode with curiosity.\"  \"Me, I'm almost beginning not to give a darn,\" Dawson said, and lazily stretched his arms over his head. \"Too doggone much mystery and not an answer to a single question. Speaking of questions, Freddy--call me nuts, but I've got an awful funny feeling.\"  \"About what, Dave?\" the English youth asked quickly, and gave him a searching look.  \"These darned sealed envelopes we're still carrying around,\" Dave replied. \"The four we've still got, counting Major Parker's. In the colonel's message, he ordered us to destroy them if necessary. Well--well, outside of that dizzy U-boat thing, it's been just an airplane flight. Yet--darn it, Freddy--having these envelopes in my pocket is giving me the jim-jams!\"  \"Yes, I know what you mean,\" young Farmer admitted, and frowned. \"I'm getting rather fed up with carrying them around, too. Silly, of course, but a couple of times I've felt as though somebody were watching every move I made.\"  Dawson started slightly and took a quick glance in all four directions, but he didn't see anyone, except some people near the San Fernando base over half a mile away. He looked at Freddy and grinned a little sheepishly.  \"You have, kid?\" he echoed. \"Well, me too. I've been having exactly that kind of feeling, too. You know what I think about hunches!\"  \"Yes,\" the other replied. \"And I also know that sometimes your hunches are worth giving serious consideration.\"  \"Sometimes, he says\" Dawson snorted. \"Look, pal--Oh, skip it! Now about the four envelopes, Freddy, if you want my opinion on the matter, it's--let's dump the acid on them and be rid of the darn things. Maybe Colonel Welsh won't like it, but what the heck? He said, _if necessary_, and the funny feeling I've got right now, and have had ever since we got his message, makes me think it _is_ necessary! What do you think? Or am I going off half-cocked?\"  Freddy Farmer didn't reply for a moment. He sat staring out over the Gulf of Paria that was now changing from blood red to midnight blue since the sun had gone down behind the headlands of Venezuela. Finally he reached a hand up inside his tunic and nodded abruptly.  \"If you're going off half-cocked, then we both are, Dave,\" he said quietly. \"I'm all for getting rid of them. If you alone had the funny feeling, I'd say no. But I've got a queer feeling, too. So--well, here go my two, anyway.\"  As young Farmer spoke, he took out his two sealed envelopes and dropped them on the ground. Then, moving back a bit, he unscrewed the cap of his little vial and poured the brownish-colored contents over the envelopes. There was a small flash of flame as the stuff came in contact with the envelopes which seemed to melt away into the ground, leaving nothing but a black smudge where they had been.  \"Boy, does that do the trick!\" Dawson breathed, and dropped his two sealed envelopes on the spot where Freddy's two had been. \"Drop that vial, Freddy, and kick dirt over it. Just a smell of that stuff would most likely take the soles off your shoes. Okay, here go mine, too.\"  A few seconds later there was another dark smudge on the ground, and not so much as a shred of any of the sealed envelopes, or their contents. Both Dawson and Freddy dropped their empty vials, kicked dirt over them, and stamped the little mounds flat. Then, as if by mutual agreement, they relaxed and heaved deep sighs of relief.  \"Maybe I was wrong,\" Dawson said thoughtfully. \"Maybe Colonel Welsh will hit the roof when we tell him. Just the same, though, I feel a hundred per cent better.\"  \"Quite!\" Freddy Farmer murmured, but with emphasis. \"I feel as though a terrific weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I swear, Dave, I haven't got a strong enough heart to stand much of this sort of thing. Frankly, this is the first contented breath I've taken since we left Washington.\"  \"Yeah, I know,\" Dawson agreed. \"The colonel certainly did pour on the old caution stuff this time. So I guess it was--or still is--something pretty doggone important. But there I go again, wondering what it's all about. I sure wish the colonel would hurry up and get here!\"  \"Know something, Dave?\" Freddy asked after a couple of moments of silence between them.  \"_Know_ something?\" Dave groaned, and rolled over on his stomach. \"Maybe you haven't been listening to me, pal. _I_ don't know from nothing. Do you?\"  \"Not exactly,\" Freddy replied. \"Just the old guessing game again. I am guessing, though, that somebody found out about those sealed envelopes. Also, they found out that you and I were acting as the messenger boys. Also, they arranged that balmy life-raft and U-boat business this afternoon. And also, Colonel Welsh is a very worried man, right at the moment.\"  \"All of which means nothing,\" Dawson added, \"and will continue to mean nothing until the colonel gets here, and explains. _If_ he does.\"  \"Most naturally!\" Freddy said with a slight edge to his voice. \"I've been doing some extra thinking about this thing, in case you don't realize it.\"  \"Well, go right ahead and think yourself black, blue, and sky-pink in the face, if it makes you happy, little man,\" Dawson said with a laugh, \"but you still won't know from beans until the colonel gets here. And if he--\"  \"I know, _I know_!\" Freddy interrupted with an impatient gesture of his hand. \"Save your breath, old thing. However, you might give this a bit of thought, if your brain can stand the strain. We've been flying part of the air transport route to North Africa.\"  \"No kidding?\" Dawson said with a mock gasp. \"Why, I always thought the air transport route to North Africa was by way of Salt Lake City and Alaska!\"  \"Very, _very_ funny!\" Freddy snapped. \"If I'm not boring you, Major Parker said he was sent down here to keep an eye out for sabotage. He also said nothing has happened in all the time he's been here. Colonel Welsh admitted that his special agents were acting as C.O. of the points where we've stopped and were going to stop. Why, Dave? _Why_ should Intelligence have a sudden interest in this air route to North Africa?\"  Dawson started to make another wisecrack, but the deadly serious look on young Farmer's face stopped him. He gave the question a moment or two of thought and then shook his head.  \"I don't know, Freddy,\" he replied. \"I really don't know. You can search me. If it isn't because of possible sabotage, then what?\"  \"I guess I've asked myself that question a thousand times,\" the English-born air ace said slowly. \"I can think up but one answer that might make sense. This is it. All these arrangements are being made to make absolutely sure nothing will happen to something very special that is soon to be flown to North Africa.\"  \"Such as?\" Dawson prompted.  Freddy seemed to hesitate for a long time."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3234"],["title","The Letters of the Younger Pliny, First Series — Volume 1 (#0)"],["body","Sue Asscher <asschers@dingoblue.net.au>      THE LETTERS OF THE YOUNGER PLINY.  WITH AN INTRODUCTORY ESSAY BY JOHN B. FIRTH.  FIRST SERIES.  THE WALTER SCOTT PUBLISHING CO., LTD, LONDON AND FELLING-ON-TYNE. NEW YORK: 3 EAST 14TH STREET.    NOTE.--In the following translation the Teubner text, edited by Keil, has been followed.   INTRODUCTION.  Some slight memoir and critical estimate of the author of this collection of Letters may perhaps be acceptable to those who are unfamiliar with the circumstances of the times in which he lived. Moreover, few have studied the Letters themselves without feeling a warm affection for the writer of them.  He discloses his character therein so completely, and, in spite of his glaring fault of vanity and his endless love of adulation, that character is in the main so charming, that one can easily understand the high esteem in which Pliny was held by the wide circle of his friends, by the Emperor Trajan, and by the public at large.  The correspondence of Pliny the Younger depicts for us the everyday life of a Roman gentleman in the best sense of the term.  We see him practising at the Bar; we see him engaged in the civil magistracies at Rome, and in the governorship of the important province of Bithynia; we see him consulted by the Emperor on affairs of state, and occupying a definite place among the \"Amici Caesaris.\"  Best of all, perhaps, we see him in his daily life, a devoted scholar, never so happy as when he is in his study, laboriously seeking to perfect his style, whether in verse or prose, by the models of the great writers of the past and the criticisms of the friends whom he has summoned, in a friendly way, to hear his compositions read or recited.  Or again we find him at one of his country villas, enjoying a well-earned leisure after the courts have risen at Rome and all the best society has betaken itself into the country to escape the heats and fevers of the capital. We see him managing his estates, listening to the complaints of his tenants, making abatements of rent, and grumbling at the agricultural depression and the havoc that the bad seasons have made with his crops. Or he spends a day in the open air hunting, yet never omits to take with him a book to read or tablets on which to write, in case the scent is cold and game is not plentiful.  In short, the Letters of Pliny the Younger give us a picture of social life as it was in the closing years of the first, and the opening years of the second century of the Christian era, which is as fascinating as it is absolutely unique.  Pliny was born either in 61 or 62 A.D. at Comum on Lake Larius.  His father, Lucius Caecilius Cilo, had been aedile of the colony, and, dying young, left a widow, who with her two sons, sought protection with her brother, Caius Plinius Secundus, the famous author of the Natural History.  The elder Pliny in his will adopted the younger of the two boys, and so Publius Caecilius Secundus--as he was originally called-- took thenceforth the name of Caius Plinius, L.F. Caecilius Secundus. Though later usage has assigned him the name of Pliny the Younger, he was known to his contemporaries and usually addressed as Secundus.  But in his early years Pliny was placed under the guardianship of Virginius Rufus, one of the most distinguished Romans of his day, a successful and brilliant general who had twice refused the purple, when offered to him by his legionaries, and who lived to a ripe old age--the Wellington of his generation.  So it was at Comum that he spent his early boyhood, and his affection for his birthplace led him in later years to provide for the educational needs of the youth of the district, who had previously been obliged to go to Mediolanum (Milan) to obtain their schooling. What can be better, he asks, than for children to be educated where they are born, so that they may grow to love their native place by residing in it?  Pliny was fortunate in having so distinguished an uncle.  On the accession of Vespasian, the elder Pliny was called to Rome by the Emperor, and when his nephew--vixdum adolescentus--joined him in the capital, he took charge of his studies.  At the age of fourteen the young student had composed a Greek tragedy, to which he playfully refers in one of his letters, and in Rome he had the benefit of attending the lectures of the great Quintilian and Nicetes Sacerdos, and of making literary friendships which were to prove of the utmost value to him in after years.  Pliny tells us that his uncle looked to him for assistance in his literary work, and he was thus engaged when his uncle lost his life in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79, so graphically described in the two famous letters to Tacitus.  That Pliny deeply felt the loss of his relative and patron is shown by the eloquent tribute he paid to his memory, and doubtless, as his death occurred just at his own entry into public life, he was deprived of an influence which might have helped him greatly in his career.  Domitian was on the throne, when, in 82, Pliny joined the 3rd Gallic legion, stationed in Syria, as military tribune. Service in the field, however, was not to his liking, and, as soon as his period of soldiering was over, he hurried back to Rome to win his spurs at the Bar and climb the ladder of civic distinction.  He became Quaestor in 89 on the recommendation of the Emperor, Tribune in 91, and Praetor in 93.  So far his advancement had been rapid, but evil times succeeded. Domitian went from bad to worse.  Always moody, suspicious, and revengeful, he began to imitate the worst vices of his predecessors of the line of Augustus.  His hand fell heavily upon the Senatorial order, and another era of proscription began, in which the dreaded delatores again became the \"terror\" of Rome.  It was a time of spoliation and murder, and Pliny writes of it with a shudder.  Contrasting with the happy regime of Trajan that which prevailed in his youth and early manhood, he declares that virtue was regarded with suspicion and a premium set upon idleness, that in the camps the generals lacked authority and the soldiers had no sense of obedience, while, when he entered the Senate, he found it a craven and tongueless assembly (Curiam trepidam et elinguem), only convened to perpetrate some piece of villainy for the Emperor, or to humiliate the Senators by the sense of their own impotence.  Pliny was not the man to make a bold stand against tyranny, and, during those perilous years, one can well believe that he did his best to avoid compromising himself, though his sympathies were wholly on the side of his proscribed friends.  He was a typical official, suave and polished in manner, yet without that perilous enthusiasm which would simply have marked him for destruction.  For two years he was Prefect of the Military Treasury, an office directly in the gift of the Emperor, and it would seem, therefore, that his character for uprightness stood him in good stead with the tyrant even in his worst years.  He did not, like so many of the Roman nobles, retire from public life and enter into the sullen opposition which enraged the Emperors even more than active and declared antagonism.  In one passage, indeed, Pliny declares that he, too, was on the black list of the Emperor, but the words must not be taken too literally.  He was given to boasting, and he may easily have represented, when the danger was past, that the peril in which he had stood was greater than it really was.  No doubt he felt keenly the judicial murder of his friends Senecio, Rusticus, and Helvidius, and the banishment of Mauricus, Gratilla, Arria, and Fannia--for women were not spared in the general proscription; but, after all, the fact that he held office during the closing years of Domitian's life is ample proof that he knew how to walk circumspectly, and did not allow his detestation of the informers to compromise his safety.  When at length, in 96, the Emperor was assassinated in the palace, and the Senate raised Nerva to the purple, Pliny stepped forward as the champion of the oppressed, and impeached Publicius Certus for compassing the death of Helvidius Priscus, though he was only so far successful that he prevented Certus from enjoying the consulship which had been promised him.  Pliny revised the speech and published it in book form, and Certus died a few days after it appeared, haunted, so Pliny tells us, by the vision of his prosecutor pursuing him, sword in hand.  Nerva's reign was short, but he was succeeded by one of the best of the Roman Emperors, Trajan, a prince under whose just, impartial and strong rule, a man of Pliny's character was bound to thrive and pass from office to office.  In 98 he had been appointed by Nerva Prefect of the Treasury of Saturn, and in 100 he held the Consulship for two months, while still retaining his post at the Treasury, and delivered his well-known Panegyric on the 1st of September in that year.  Either in 103 or 104 he was advanced to the Augurate, and two years later was appointed Curator of the Tiber.  Then in 111 or 112--according to Mommsen's Chronology--Trajan bestowed upon him a signal mark of his esteem by selecting him for the Governorship of the province of Pontus and Bithynia, which he had transferred from the list of senatorial to that of imperial provinces.  Pliny was given the special title of Legate Propraetor with full Consular powers, and he remained in his province for at least fifteen months.  After that the curtain falls.  Whether he died in Bithynia, or shortly after his return to Rome, or whether he lived on to enjoy the ripe old age of which he writes so pleasantly in his letters, we do not know.  Certainly the probabilities are that, if he had lived, he would have continued to correspond with his friends, and the absence of further letters makes for the probability that he died in about his fiftieth year.  In judging these letters for their literary value, the first thing which strikes"]]]
