It's for you, Mr. Karnes.\"  Karnes took the instrument. \"Karnes speaking.\"  \"Radio Central, Mr. Karnes,\" came the voice. \"We just got some more on Brittain. About ten minutes ago, he abandoned the police 'copter. Officer Powers was in the seat, shot through the head. We'll get the essobee on a murder rap, now.\"  \"Where was the 'copter abandoned?\"  Radio Central told him and went on: \"Funny thing was, he didn't try to hide it or anything. And he stole another 'copter from a private citizen. We're trying to get the description now. I'll call you if anything further comes in.\"  \"Fine.\" Karnes hung up. The address where Brittain had left the 'copter was in almost a direct line between the apartment building and Long Island Spaceport. But if Brittain were actually heading there, why should he leave such a broad and obvious trail?  He turned to the officer who was driving the 'copter.  \"I've got a hunch. Swivel this thing around and head for Long Island. I've got a funny feeling that Brittain will be there. He--\"  The phone rang again, and Karnes grabbed it.  \"Mr. Karnes, we've found that civilian's 'copter! It's at Long Island Spaceport! Just a second, the stuff's still coming in.\" Pause. \"Get this: A man answering to Brittain's description bought a ticket for the West Coast rocket.  \"As you know, that's UN territory, and we have no jurisdiction. The rocket is sealed for takeoff, but they're holding it for us until you get there!\"  \"Right! I'm headed there now!\" he answered quickly.  It was twelve minutes later that the police 'copter settled just outside the rocket enclosure. Karnes had already notified the pilot to be ready for him. He sprinted up the ramp and stood at the airlock of the transcontinental rocket.  It sighed open, and Karnes stepped inside. He was met by a frightened stewardess.  \"Tell him to get in here and not to try any funny stuff!\" snapped a voice from the passenger cabin.  Brittain was standing at the forward end of the passenger compartment with a levelled gun.  The rocket was tilted at forty-five degrees for the takeoff, and the passenger's seats had swiveled with a section of the flooring to keep them level, which gave the effect of a stairway which climbed toward the pilot's cabin in the forward section of the ship. Brittain's position was at the top of the stairway.  Karnes raised his hands and kept them carefully away from his hip holster.  \"All right,\" called Brittain, \"Close that door and get this ship off the ground.\"  The pilot could hear him through the intercom system. The airlock door slid shut again.  \"You and the stewardess get into a seat,\" the spy continued sharply. \"If you try anything funny, I start shooting the other passengers if I can't hit you.\"  Karnes saw then what hold Brittain had on the pilot. The rocketeer couldn't afford to risk the lives of his passengers.  He and the stewardess slid into the acceleration seats and strapped themselves in. Brittain stepped down the tiered floor and took a rear seat near a frightened-looking blonde girl.  \"Anything funny, and Blondie here gets a bullet. Okay, pilot. Take her up!\"  There was a faint hiss, and then the rockets began their throbbing roar. Acceleration pressure began to shove the passengers back in their seats. Karnes leaned back and tried--successfully--to suppress the smile of triumph that kept trying to come to his lips.  Brittain had finally made a mistake.  One hundred and twenty-five miles over Pennsylvania, the rockets cut out, and the ship went into free fall. And Brittain's mistake became evident.  With the abrupt cessation of weight, the padded acceleration seats expanded again, pressing the passengers up against their safety straps. But Brittain had failed to strap himself in.         *       *       *       *       *  The expanding seat shoved forward and toward the ceiling. Before he could recover from his surprise, Karnes had undone his own seat belt and snapped his body through the air toward Brittain. They collided with a thump and Brittain's body slammed against the roof of the cabin with agonizing force. The gun came out of his hand and clanged against a wall, then drifted off harmlessly. Brittain was out cold.  Karnes handcuffed him securely and, with the stewardess' help, tugged him back to the baggage compartment. One of the passengers was quietly retching into a vacuum disposal chute.  With Brittain securely strapped into an empty baggage rack, Karnes swam back to the pilot's compartment, pulling himself along the railing that ran along the floor.  The pilot looked relieved. \"Thank heaven you got the devil! He got wise when we delayed the takeoff, and threatened to start shooting my passengers. There wasn't a thing I could do.\"  \"I know. Let me use your radio.\"  It took a couple of minutes to get UN International Investigation on the hookup, but Karnes finally was talking to his superior in the UN office. He reported what had happened.  \"Fine, Karnes,\" came the tight-beamed voice. \"Now, here's something else you ought to know. Our radar net has spotted robot rockets coming in over the Pole. So far, five of them have been hit by interceptor rockets, but we don't have them all by a long shot.  \"Evidently, the League feels that they're ready to slam us, now that they've got Moonbase and two of our spacecraft plants out of the way. _The war is on_, Karnes.\"  Karnes acknowledged, they cut the connection.  There was one thing burning hotly in his brain. Brittain had fled New York without seeming to care how far they traced him or what kind of trail he left behind. _Why?_  He jerked open the door of the pilot's cabin, and, not bothering to use the rail, launched himself toward the rear of the ship, flipping himself halfway down to land with his feet against the baggage room door. He pulled the door open and pushed inside.  Brittain was still groggy, so Karnes began slapping his face methodically, rocking his head from side to side.  \"Okay! Okay! Stop it!\" Brittain yelled, fully awake.  Karnes stopped, and Brittain blinked, owlishly. Karnes' hunch factory was still operating at full blast; he was fairly sure that the lie he was about to tell would have all of the desired effect.  \"You didn't really think you could get away, did you, bud?\" he asked, nastily. \"We're headed back for New York now, and you'll stand trial for murder as well as sabotage and espionage.\"  Brittain's eyes widened in horror.  \"What did that mind impressor tell you?\" Karnes went on.         *       *       *       *       *  Brittain was trying to keep his mouth shut, but at that moment there was a glare of light which flashed bluely through the hard quartz of a nearby window.  From somewhere far to the north, another interceptor rocket had found the atomic warhead of an enemy bomb.  Brittain knew and recognized that flash. He screamed wordlessly and then began to sob like a hysterical child.  Karnes began to slap him again. \"Come on, what was it?\"  \"Don't--don't let them go back to New York! It said--it said--\" he gasped and took a deep breath \"--WE'LL ALL BE KILLED!\" he screamed.  \"Why?\" Karnes's voice was cold.  \"BOMB!\" Brittain screamed again.  After a few more minutes of questioning, Karnes finally got the rest of the story from him.  The Galactics had found that on this date a nuclear bomb would get through the UN screen and completely destroy most of Greater New York. Only one other bomb would get through, but it would be thrown off course and land somewhere in the Pacific, having missed Los Angeles entirely.  \"Anything else?\" asked Karnes after a few seconds of silence from Brittain. \"Didn't it say they would have to prevent that?\"  Brittain's voice was dull now. \"All it said was that the records would have to be preserved. It said that things must go on exactly as before. It said that nothing must interfere with the complete development, whatever that means.\"  Karnes pushed his way out of the room and back towards the pilot's compartment. What the pilot had to say was no news to Karnes.  \"Radio from New York says that a bomb missed LA and hit the ocean. That was a close one.\"  Karnes nodded silently, and leaned back in the stewardess' seat to think.         *       *       *       *       *  No wonder Brittain had been so anxious to get out of New York.  New York would be destroyed, but that was inevitable. The thing that had bothered him, his dilemma, was solved.  Was this the real Earth that he lived in, or a museum that had been set up by the Galactics? If it was old Earth, then man would solve his present problems and go on to solve the problem of time travel and interstellar transportation. The present war would be just another little incident in the far past, like the battles of Gettysburg and Agincourt.         *       *       *       *       *  And if it were the museum Earth? No difference. For the Galactics had decided not to interfere. They had decided to let the race of Earth go on as it was--exactly as it had gone before. It made no difference, really. _No difference at all._ A perfect duplication of an original _was_ the original, in every meaningful way.  \"Funny,\" said the pilot abruptly, \"I'm not getting any signal from New York.\"  Karnes took a deep breath and bit at his lower lip. But he did not look toward the horror that was New York. The city was gone, but the world was there--solid and real!  _You'd better expand your museum a little bit, boys_, he thought. _We'll need to include Mars and Venus before very long. And then the stars._         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32104"],["title","Turning Point (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from If Worlds of Science Fiction November     1953.

A great, mile-square blind cube topping a ragged mountain; bare escarpments falling away to a turbulent sea. For five centuries the Creche had stood so, and the Androids had come forth in an unending stream to labor for Man, the Master...._                             --_Quintus Bland, The Romance of Genus Homo._  Director Han Merrick paced the floor nervously. His thin, almost ascetic face was pale and drawn.  \"We can't allow it, Virginia,\" he said, \"Prying of this sort can only precipitate a pogrom or worse. Erikson is a bigot of the worst kind. The danger--\" He broke off helplessly.  His wife shook her head slowly. \"It cannot be prevented, Han. Someone was bound to start asking questions sooner or later. History should have taught us that. And five hundred years of secrecy was more than anyone had a right to expect. Nothing lasts forever.\"  _The trouble is_, Merrick told himself, _simply that I am the wrong man for this job. I should never have taken it. There's a wrongness in what we are doing here that colors my every reaction and makes me incapable of acting on my own. Always the doubts and secret questioning. If the social structure of our world weren't moribund, I wouldn't be here at all...._  \"History, Virginia,\" he said, \"can't explain what there is no precedent for. The Creche is unique in human experience.\"  \"The Creche may be, Han, but Sweyn Erikson is not. Consider his background and tell me if there hasn't been an Erikson in every era of recorded history. He is merely another obstacle in the path of progress that must be overcome. The job is yours, Han.\"  \"A pleasant prospect,\" Merrick replied bleakly. \"I am an organizer, not a psychotechnician. How am I supposed to protect the Creche from the likes of Erikson? What insanity bore this fruit, Virginia? The Prophet, the number one Fanatic, coming here as an _investigator_ in the name of the Council of Ten! I realize the Council turns pale at the thought of the vote the Fanatics control, but surely _something_ could have been done! Have those idiots forgotten what we do here? Is that possible?\"  Virginia Merrick shook her head. \"The stone got too hot for them to handle, so they've thrown it to you.\"  \"But Erikson, himself! The very man who organized the Human Supremacy Party and the Antirobot League! If he sets foot within the Creche it will mean an end to everything!\"  The woman lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. \"We can't keep him out and you know it. There's an army of Fanatics gathering out there in the hills this very minute. Armed with cortical-stimulant projectors, Han. That isn't a pleasant way to die--\"  Merrick studied his wife carefully. There was fear under her iron control. She was thinking of the shattering pain of death under the projectors. Nothing else, really. The Creche didn't matter to her. The Creche didn't really matter to any of the staff. Three hundred years ago it would have been different. The custodians of the Creche would have gladly died to preserve their trust in those times....  What irony, Merrick thought, that it should come like this. He knew what the projectors did to men. He also knew what they did to robots.  \"If they dare to use their weapons on us it will wipe out every vestige of control work done here since the beginning,\" he said softly.  \"They have no way of knowing that.\"  \"Nor would they believe it if we told them.\"  \"And that brings us right back to where we started. You can't keep Erikson out, and the Council of Ten has left us on our own. They don't dare oppose the Fanatics. But there's an old political maxim you would do well to consider very carefully since it's our only hope, Han,\" Virginia Merrick said, \"'If you can't beat someone--join him.'\"         *       *       *       *       *  She dragged deeply on her cigarette, blue smoke curling from her gold-tinted lips. \"This has been coming on for ten years. I tried to warn you then, but you wouldn't listen. Remember?\"  How like a woman, Merrick thought bitterly, to be saying I told you so.  \"What would you have me do, Virginia?\" he asked, \"Help the bigot peddle his robot-hate? That can't be the way. Don't you feel anything at all when the reports of pogroms come in?\"  Virginia Merrick shrugged. \"Better they than we, Han.\"  \"Has it occurred to you that our whole culture might collapse if Erikson has his way?\"  \"Antirobotism is natural to human beings. Compromise is the only answer. Precautions have to be taken--\"  \"_Precautions_!\" exploded Merrick. \"What sort of precautions can be taken against pure idiocy?\"  \"The founding board of Psychotechnicians--\"  \"No help from that source. You know that I've always felt the whole premise was questionable. On the grounds of common fairness, if nothing else.\"  \"Really, Han,\" Virginia snapped, \"It was the only thing to do and you know it. The Creche is the only safeguard the race has.\"  \"Now you sound like the Prophet. In reverse.\"  \"We needn't argue the point.\"  \"No, I suppose not,\" the Director muttered.  \"Then what are you going to do when he gets here?\" She ground out her cigarette anxiously. \"The procession is in the ravine now. You had better decide quickly.\"  \"I don't know, Virginia. I just don't know.\" Merrick sank down behind his desk, hands toying with the telescreen controls. \"I was never intended to make this sort of decisions. I feel helpless. Look here--\"  The image of the ravine glowed across the screen in brilliant relief. The densely timbered slopes were spotted with tiny purposeful figures in the grey robes that all Fanatics affected. Here and there the morning sun caught a glint of metal as the Fanatics labored to set up their projectors. Along the floor of the ravine that was the only land approach to the Creche moved the twisting, writhing snake of the procession. The enraptured Fanatics were chanting their hate-songs as they came. In the first rank walked the leonine Erikson, his long hair whipping in the moisture-laden wind from the sea.  With a muttered curse, Merrick flipped a toggle and the scene dimmed. The face of a secretary appeared superimposed on it. It was the expressionless face of an android, a fine example of the Creche's production line. \"Get Graves up here,\" he ordered, \"You may find him at Hypno-Central or in Semantic Evaluation.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" intoned the android, fading from the screen.  Merrick looked at his wife. \"Maybe Graves and I can think of something.\"  \"Don't plan anything rash, Han.\"  Merrick shrugged and turned back to watch the steady approach of the procession of grey-frocked zealots in the ravine.  Graves appeared as the doorway dilated. He looked fearful and pale. \"You wanted to see me, Han?\"  \"Come in, Jon. Sit down.\"  \"Have you seen the projectors those crackpots have set up in the hills?\" Graves demanded.  \"I have, Jon. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.\"  \"My God, Han! Do you have any idea of what it must feel like to die from cortical stimulation?\" Graves' voice was tense and strained. \"Can't we get out of here by 'copter?\"  \"No. The 'copters are both in Francisco picking up supplies. I ordered them out yesterday. Besides, that wouldn't settle anything. There are almost a thousand androids in the Creche as of this morning. What about them?\"  Graves made a gesture of impatience. \"It's the humans I'm thinking about.\"  Merrick forced down the bitter taste of disgust that welled into his throat and forced himself to go on. \"We have to take some sort of action to protect the Creche, Jon. I've held off until the last moment, thinking the Council would never allow a Fanatic to investigate the Creche, but the Ten are more afraid of the HSP rubber stamp vote than they are of letting a thousand androids be slaughtered. But we can't leave it at that. If we don't prevent it, Erikson will precipitate a pogrom that will make the Canalopolis massacre look like a tea-party.\" For some reason he held back the information about the effect of the Fanatic weapon on robot tissue. The vague notion that knowing, Jon Graves might cast his lot with Erikson, restrained him.  \"Of course, Erikson will come in wearing an energy shield,\" Graves said.  \"He will. And we have none,\" Virginia Merrick said softly.  \"Can we compromise with him?\" Graves asked.  There it was again, Merrick thought, the weasel-word 'compromise.' There was a moral decay setting in everywhere--the founders of the Creche would never have spoken so. \"No,\" he said flatly, \"We cannot. Erikson has conceived a robot-menace. All the old hate-patterns are being dusted off and used on the rabble. People are actually asking one another if they would like their daughters to _marry_ robots. That sort of thing, as old as _homo sapiens_. And one cannot compromise with prejudice. It seduces the emotions and dulls the mind. No, there will be no appeasing of Sweyn Erikson or his grey-shirted nightriders!\"  \"You're talking like a starry-eyed fool, Han,\" Virginia Merrick said sharply.  \"Can't we take him in and give him the works?\" Graves asked hopefully. \"Primary Conditioning could handle the job. Give him a fill-in with false memory?\"  Merrick shook his head. \"We can't risk narcosynthesis and that's essential. He'll surely be tested for blood purity when he leaves, and scopolamine traces would be a dead give-away that we had been trying to hide something here.\"  \"Then "]]]
