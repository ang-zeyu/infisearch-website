[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],["title","A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#5)"],["body","a gladiolus farmer from the chaparral belt of Santa Clara County, California, visited the University of California seeking advice on how to prevent damage by \"cottontails\" to his gladioli plantings, we asked the farmer if brush rabbits or cottontails were responsible and suggested to the farmer, who was unable to distinguish between the two, that an animal be killed and submitted for identification. When this was done, the brush rabbit (_Sylvilagus bachmani_) was found to be responsible for the damage. Robert T. Orr's recommendation that the chaparral (brush) be cut back 45 feet from the gladioli plantings was reluctantly followed and proved to be effective. A letter from a Santa Clara County agricultural official a couple of years later expressed thanks for the recommendation made by Orr, and estimated that adoption of his recommendations saved farmers of that one county $40,000 annually. This incident illustrates how detailed knowledge of the life history of a given kind of animal and control of its environment, rather than direct \"control\" of the animal, is sometimes of value to man.  The genus _Sylvilagus_ is restricted to the New World; the two species _Sylvilagus brasiliensis_ and _S. floridanus_ are the only two which occur in South America and they occur also in North America.

Upper parts pinkish to blackish or dark grayish depending on amount     of wear. The pigmy rabbit lives in burrows, mostly dug by itself,     preferably where tall sagebrush grows densely. This species feeds     extensively on sagebrush, at least in winter. Six young seem to be     the rule and they are born any time from late in May until early in     August.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.

Characters of subgeneric worth, in contrast to those of the subgenus _Brachylagus_, are: First premolar, in upper jaw and in lower jaw, with more than one fold in the enamel; infolded enamel, which divides each molar tooth into two parts, crenate.  The many nominal species of the subgenus _Sylvilagus_ belong to no more than 12 and perhaps to only ten full species. The now more abundant specimens than were available a half century ago reveal also that there are less trenchant differences between some of the species than were supposed to exist when the five names for genera or subgenera listed immediately above were proposed. Some species can be placed in each of two subgenera with almost equal propriety. If used, four of the five subgeneric names mentioned above would contain only one species each. It seems that no useful purpose is served by attempting to fit the several species of the genus _Sylvilagus_ into more than the two subgenera _Brachylagus_ and _Sylvilagus_; the other names, _Tapeti_ Gray, _Microlagus_ Trouessart, _Limnolagus_ Mearns, and _Paludilagus_ Hershkovitz, are here arranged as synonyms of the subgeneric name _Sylvilagus_ Gray.   Sylvilagus brasiliensis  Forest Rabbit  Total length, 380-420; tail, 20-21; hind foot, 77-80; ear from notch (dry), 39-46. The principal characters of this species are small size, dark color, short tail, and dingy buffy (not white) undersurface of the tail. These rabbits rest in forests or other thick vegetative cover and do not venture far from such cover to feed.

Body uniformly dark brown or brownish gray, but tail whitish beneath; hair on midventral part of body gray at base; only a slight crenulation of ridge of enamel which separates an individual molariform tooth into anterior and posterior sections. From _Sylvilagus audubonii_, the only other species of _Sylvilagus_ in the same geographic area, _S. bachmani_ differs in smaller size, less white on underparts (the hairs on the midventral part of the body being gray instead of white at base), shorter ears and legs, and a less crenulated ridge of enamel separating the anterior and posterior parts of a molariform tooth.  The brush rabbit is a Pacific Coastal species; as may be seen from figure 9 on the next page, this species occurs from the Columbia River on the north to the tip of Baja California on the south. Nowhere, so far as I can learn, does it occur as far east as the crest of the Cascade-Sierra Nevada"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],["title","A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#6)"],["body","Chain. Throughout its range the brush rabbit is closely associated with--in fact, lives in--the chaparral that is dense enough to afford protection from raptorial birds and the larger carnivorous mammals. The rabbit's reliance on protective cover is so great that, as pointed out on an earlier page, a person can turn this trait to advantage in protecting cultivated crops from inroads that the rabbits might make on them. The protection is afforded by clearing the brush from a strip forty-five feet wide so that the cleared strip intervenes between the cultivated crops and the brushy shelter. The rabbits will not risk crossing the open strip and hence do not reach the growing crops.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.

Only one observer (Orr, 1940: 173) has reported an individual entering a hole. In patches of chaparral in which the rabbits live they make runways that are especially well defined at the edges of the brush. The outer entrance to a runway is tunnellike and one to two feet from the outer entrance there is a special form that serves as a lookout post. A brush rabbit that is about to venture into the open ordinarily pauses in such a form for several minutes, presumably to satisfy itself that no enemy is in the open area whither the rabbit is bound.  The breeding season is from January to June, at least in California. There are 2 to 5 young, averaging 3.5 per litter. They are born in a nest.

This insular species is closely related to _Sylvilagus bachmani_ and is distinguished by paleness, proportionately longer and narrower skull, fusion to skull of anterior arm of supraorbital process, and larger jugal.   =Sylvilagus palustris=  Marsh Rabbit  (See figure 42)  Total length, 425-440; tail, 33-39; hind foot, 88-91; ear from notch (dry), 45-52. Upper parts blackish brown or reddish brown; underside of tail brownish or dingy gray (not white); ears, tail and hind feet short; posterior and anterior extensions of supraorbital processes joined to skull along most (or all) of their extent. The lack of white on the underside of the tail is a ready means of distinguishing this species from the other species of the genus which occur within its geographic range. The species occurs in the lowlands, possibly not above 500 feet altitude, of the Lower Austral and Tropical life-zones. In Florida, Blair (1936) found that the marsh rabbit ate 29 per cent of its bodily weight in green food each day and that the number of embryos in 3 females was 4, 4 and 3.
