Fig. 1 is a micro-photograph showing the fat globules in whole milk. Fig. 2 is a micro-photograph of separated milk, and Fig. 3 a micro-photograph of cream, all under high magnification (450 diams.); from these figures the comparative number of fat globules present may be seen.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.—Micro-photograph of a Drop of   Whole Milk, showing distribution of fat globules.   (Magnified 450 diams.)]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.—Micro-photograph of Separated   Milk, showing the almost complete absence of fat globules   as compared with whole milk. (Magnified 450 diams.)]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.—Micro-photograph of Cream, showing   agglomeration of fat globules. (Magnified 450 diams.)]  Fats distributed through a watery liquid in this finely divided condition form together what is called an emulsion, in which the particles of fat are kept apart by surface tension. The specific gravity of milk fat averages 0.93, and compared with water weighing 10 lbs., a gallon of fat would weigh 9 lbs. 5 oz. It is thus considerably lighter than the other constituents, and when milk is left at rest, the fat globules gradually rise to the top and float there, forming cream. The difference in specific gravity between cream and milk is taken advantage of in the mechanical separator, now so much used, and which makes such a thorough separation between the two. Cream is an article of the most varied composition, according to the ideas of the person who produces it, but it ought to contain at least 20 per cent. of butter fat, and may be made with a much larger percentage if necessary. When cream is agitated in a particular way, as by churning, the surface tension of the particles is overcome, and they run together into a mass which forms butter.  The casein of milk is not held in solution in the ordinary sense, but in a peculiar state of suspension called the colloidal condition, practically the whole of it remaining behind when milk is filtered through clay filters.  It is this state of suspension of the casein which makes milk opaque, but the opacity is considerably increased by the emulsified fat.  The coagulation of the casein in milk by the addition of rennet has already been referred to. Acids, either mineral or organic, also precipitate it in the form of flakes. Skimmed milk is now largely used for the preparation of casein by this method, and the washed and dried precipitate is used very extensively in the arts for such varied purposes as the manufacture of billiard balls, paints, cements, etc.  The clear liquid which separates when milk is curdled with rennet is called whey, and contains the milk sugar and mineral salts. The sugar is manufactured from it on a limited scale, and is used as an ingredient in infant foods, and as a convenient medium in certain medical preparations. In Sweden a kind of cheese is made from whey, but the great bulk of it everywhere is used for feeding pigs.

The   whitish bacterial colonies on A are due to enormous   numbers of organisms, while B is quite free from such   growth.    For the production of a reliable lactic food, it is   essential that certain precautions as to the treatment of   the milk, and the maintenance of a suitable temperature   during the growth of the lactic bacteria, should be   observed.    In the first place, milk immediately after extraction from   the cow contains only a few organisms, but these multiply   so rapidly that in a few hours the bacterial content may   amount to many millions per ounce. In preparing a pure   culture of any specific organism, then, care must be taken   to destroy all the bacteria that have accidentally found   their way into the milk, inoculating with the organisms it   is desired to cultivate. This is best accomplished by   heating the milk to the boiling-point of water for about   thirty minutes, by which time almost all the undesirable   bacteria have been killed.]  The milk of the cow differs a good deal from human milk, and where the former is used for the feeding of children it is usual to add milk sugar to it, and otherwise alter it to bring its composition more in harmony with the human article. The high concentration of the milk of the reindeer and the whale is noteworthy. Perhaps this may be due to the low temperature conditions in which these animals live, necessitating strong nutriment to enable their young to make proper progress in growth and development. On the other hand, the milk of the ass is poor in quality, and probably on this account it is more readily assimilated by those of weak digestion, to whom it is sometimes recommended. Goats' milk is richer than either cow or human milk, and its nourishing properties are well known. The goat is usually free from tuberculosis and other diseases which affect the cow, and its milk is therefore a very safe article to use.  _The Analysis of Milk._—While the analysis of milk can only be made by a competent chemist, there are a number of simple tests and observations by which any intelligent person can obtain a fair idea of its quality. The taste and smell afford some guide, as also the general appearance. To judge of the latter, place some of the milk in a tumbler or other clear glass vessel. If the milk is of good quality it will be quite homogeneous and opaque. Any flocculent matter indicates either disease in the cow or that the milk is old and bacteria have multiplied in it and altered its composition. When the milk has stood long enough for the cream to rise freely, the latter should form a perfectly homogeneous and strongly defined layer on the top. The quantity of cream may be measured in a creamometer, which consists of a small glass cylinder graduated at the top (Fig. 5). It is filled with milk to the top graduation line, and when the cream has risen, the percentage quantity of the latter which has separated can be taken off.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. The Creamometer]  The colour should be like that of porcelain, but, as already stated, it is a common thing for the dairyman to add a small quantity of anatto or an aniline dye of a similar shade, to give the milk a rich creamy tint. If the milk is of a reddish colour this may be caused by blood from the udder, although certain foods, such as beets, mangels, and carrots sometimes give a similar tint. The milk given by cows immediately after calving is called \"colostrum\" or \"biestings,\" and is of a yellow or yellow-brown colour. It is much thicker than ordinary milk, and coagulates in boiling.  In dirty byres in which care is not taken in milking, quite considerable quantities of hairs, pieces of manure, and other filth may get into the milk. Usually the milk is strained by the dairyman, but sometimes this is omitted or carelessly done. To test for dirt, a ribbed glass funnel is useful. Get a piece of the finest muslin about twice the diameter of the funnel, fold over twice, so that it becomes one quarter of its original size; open one of the sections and place in the funnel; pass the milk into this. It will run through quickly and some water may be run into the funnel to clear away the last traces of milk. The filter cloth can then be opened out and any dirt retained will become visible. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 6.    [Illustration: TESTING-GLASS FOR EXTRANEOUS MATTER IN   MILK.    FIG. 6.—A piece of muslin is folded as shown and a   measured quantity of milk is passed through the funnel;   from the sediment left in the muslin, the percentage of   extraneous matter may be arrived at.]  If a glass funnel is not available, a very small jelly bag can be made of fine gauze and used in the same way. The washing water should be used in small quantities and directed to concentrating the dirt in the apex of the bag. After washing, the latter can be turned outside in, to permit of readier examination of the dirt. The bag should be well washed in cold water, then boiled and dried, and is then ready for future use.  The acidity of milk is a very useful guide to its age. Milk has the curious property of being \"amphoteric,\" _i.e._, it is both slightly acid and slightly alkaline when fresh. As its age increases, however, so does its acidity, and at a rate varying with the temperature and moisture contents of the atmosphere in which it is placed. Old and acid milk is heavily contaminated with bacteria, a proportion of which are likely to be injurious to health.

It might fall at any minute, crushing     your life out instantly beneath its weight. Your only possible     defenses are your brain and voice--but how do you argue with a     boulder which neither sees nor hears?_   'mid pleasures and palaces  By James McKimmey, Jr.  Illustrated by Philip Parsons   This planet was remote and set apart, and nothing about it had made William Kirk think he might find human life. Yet just beyond, through a thorny bush shaped like an exploding rose, Kirk had seen eyes and nose and a flash of yellow hair that were definitely human.  Kirk poised motionless. He was three miles from the rocket and Leo, who was waiting inside of it. He thought for a moment of how Leo had told him, as they made their landing, that this is the kind of planet where you could go no further. This is the kind of planet that could be the end of twelve years, and you'd better be careful, William, old sport.  Kirk noticed a faint breeze; his palms were wet, and they cooled when the breeze touched them. He placed his palms against his jacket. Damn you, Leo, he thought. Damn your rotten fortune-telling. Kirk was superstitious when he was in space, and the memory of Leo Mason's cool, quiet voice saying \"Watch it now, sport. Be careful, be careful ...\" seemed now like some certain kiss of fate.  The bush trembled and Kirk's right hand flicked to his holster. His pistol was cold against his fingers and he let it fit loosely in his hand, the barrel half-raised.  The bush shivered again, and then all at once the figure was rising from behind it, a tall wide figure with a very tan face, lined and toughened by the sun. The shoulders, bare like the chest, were massive, yet somehow stretched-looking, as though endless exposure to wind and rain and sun had turned the skin to brown leather.  [Illustration]  Kirk had his pistol pointing at the figure's stomach now, and the figure blinked, while the breeze touched and ruffled the long bleached hair.  The figure raised a large hand, palm up, and curled the fingers. \"Hello?\" he said softly. Kirk was surprised by the word and the polite sound of it.  Kirk remained motionless, pistol pointing. \"Who are you?\" he said through his teeth.  \"Harry,\" said the figure, as though Kirk surely should know who he was. \"I'm Harry, of course.\"  \"Yes?\" said Kirk carefully. \"Harry?\"  The figure nodded. \"Harry Loren, don't you know?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" Kirk said, his eyes watchful. \"Harry Loren.\" There was something about the man's eyes, Kirk decided. They were deep set and very bright within their sockets. They didn't match the softness of the speech. Harry Loren smiled and showed his yellow teeth. \"Who are you?\" he asked politely.  \"I'm William,\" Kirk said. It was as though he might be speaking to a frightened child, he thought, who held a sharp knife in his hands. \"William Kirk, of course.\"  Harry Loren nodded apologetically. \"Oh, yes. I can't remember everyone. It's been so long. How are you, William?\"  Kirk's eyes flickered. \"I'm fine.\"  \"That's nice,\" Harry Loren nodded. His wild hair brushed over his shoulders and reflected its yellowness against the sun. The knife then, the one that Kirk had thought about a moment ago, appeared in the figure's hand. \"_Bastard_,\" Harry Loren hissed, and he was leaping at Kirk, the knife making a sweep toward Kirk's stomach.  Something kept Kirk from squeezing the trigger, and instead he swung his pistol so that it struck the brown, weathered knuckles. The knife flew into a thicket and Loren, screaming, was upon Kirk, reaching for Kirk's neck. Kirk wrenched backward and at the same time swung the barrel of the pistol toward the yellow flying hair. There was a cracking sound, and Harry Loren, brown and wild-looking, crumpled silently before Kirk's feet.  Kirk examined the man, then he reached down and picked up the knife from the thicket. It was crudely hammered out from some kind of alloy, but sharp nevertheless, and it could have been deadly in a hand like Harry Loren's.  Kirk looked again at the yellow-haired man on the ground. He was wearing some kind of ragged cloth about his waist and nothing else. Across his back, Kirk could see, was a curving scar, an inch wide and ten or twelve inches long. It was white and very noticeable against the brown of the man's skin.  Kirk bent down, looking at the scar carefully. It could have been made during a crash of a rocket, but there were, he noticed, fine whiter ridges running along the length of the scar as though they had been made by fine comb-like teeth. A talon, perhaps. Some kind of strange claw. Kirk straightened quickly.  It went through his head that Harry Loren might not be the only animal life on this planet. He tightened his hand on his pistol, stepping backward, his eyes darting.  But he could only pivot slowly, trying to see, to discover, and he was much too slow when he finally saw it. It was only a flash of yellow and brown, making a hissing kind of sound. He felt the ripping along his right arm. The pistol was going out of his hand. And a swirling blackness got in front of his eyes.         *       *       *       *       *  When he awoke he saw Harry Loren first, who was sitting up now, silent, motionless, with Kirk's pistol resting in his hands.  To the side of Loren and just a little behind rested a peculiar-looking thing. It was alive because its head, shaped like a cone that had been attached to its neck, kept swaying gently back and forth. The dark blue eyes, spaced back from the smallest end of the cone, were rather small with no lids. The creature's neck was long and thin, a multitude of shades of yellow and brown like the head, and the rest of the body widened out like a funnel and this area was covered with yellow feathers. It had what appeared to be arms and legs, long thin extensions of dark brown with large bony joints. At the end of each of these, Kirk could see a flat claw with rows of tiny comb-like teeth.  Loren reached out and ran a hand softly along the creature's long neck.  Kirk tried to think, testing his muscles without moving, and he remembered then the ripping along his right arm. He looked at the arm and at the way his jacket had been torn away along with the shirt beneath it. He could see the comb-like marking of his skin. The cut was not deep but it bled a little and stung. He tried to move his arm and found that he could.  Kirk looked back to Loren. Loren stroked his hand along the thin neck of the creature. Kirk decided to try:  \"That's a nice-looking animal, Harry.\"  Loren's expression did not change.  Kirk paused. From the looks of the man, Loren had been here a long time, a very long time. It had been a crash, probably. And all the years afterward of loneliness, all the time for the quiet but sure warping of the brain.  He raised a hand quickly, watching Loren's eyes. Loren did not change expressions or move the pistol, but Kirk felt a comb-like claw touching his hand, freezing it to motionless with its razor tips. Kirk looked at the creature. The dark blue eyes were steady. Kirk lowered his hand slowly and the claw was drawn away. The creature's head resumed it's gentle swaying, and Loren's hand resumed its stroking.  Kirk licked his lips.  \"Where have you been?\" Loren said, his voice sudden and hoarse now.  \"Where have I been?\" Kirk said, tight and motionless.  \"Why didn't you come before?\"  Kirk considered it. The dancing lights in the man's eyes, the high-strung sound of his voice were things to make you wary and careful. Kirk closed his fingers the slightest bit. \"I didn't know you were here.\"  Loren's lips thinned. \"Liar.\"  Kirk thought he might try a smile, to reassure Loren that he was telling the truth. He decided against it. \"How long have you been here, Harry?\"  \"How would I know?\"  Kirk thought of the endless nights and days when time ran together and there was no more separation of one time from another. Today would be tomorrow and tomorrow would be today. No changes. Endless. \"Did you crash, Harry?\"  \"Did you crash, Harry?\" Loren mimicked, and for a moment Kirk felt a chill dancing through him as he watched the sarcastic leer of Loren's mouth.  Kirk kept his tone polite, patronizing. \"Was there anyone else?\"  Loren laughed, a laugh that bounced over the rocks and through the scrubs and bushes.  \"Was there, Harry?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" Loren said, grinning and showing his yellow teeth. \"Six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Would you like to see their graves? I've kept the graves pretty. I know where they are because I dug them.\"  Loren remained in a half crouch, the fingers of one hand holding the pistol loosely, the other keeping up its monotonous stroking of the animal. His eyes seemed to become vacant for a moment, as though lost in the memory of the digging of six graves. Then they narrowed. \"Where have you been?\"  Kirk tried to match his answer to the wants of the man. \"I came as soon as I could.\"  \"You did?\"  \"Yes,\" Kirk said. \"I did.\"  Loren's right hand stopped its stroking and his fingers tightened about the thin long neck of the animal. \"Eddie?\" he said.  Kirk saw the animal's left claw whipping out. He ducked suddenly, but the claw ripped along his left arm. He tried to roll sideways, and then he lay, half sprawled, looking at the blood welling up from this new set of ripped ridges in his arm. He shifted his eyes to look at the animal, and he was quite certain that he could detect a small mouth fitting around the under side of the funnel-shaped head. It was only a line, but Kirk thought that there was a grinning look to it.  \"You didn't come as soon as you could,\" Loren said, his voice an angry trembling sound.  \"I did, Harry,\" Kirk said, still remaining in his half sprawl. \"I really did.\"  Loren replaced his hand on the neck of the animal, squeezing.  \"No, no,\" Kirk said, and he tried to keep the panic out of his voice. \"Harry, I'm telling you the"]]]
