It is in response to this demand that what is commonly but not very happily known as Inductive Logic has been formulated.  In obedience to custom, I shall follow the now ordinary division of Logic into Deductive and Inductive. The titles are misleading in many ways, but they are fixed by a weight of usage which it would be vain to try to unsettle. Both come charging down the stream of time each with its cohort of doctrines behind it, borne forward with irresistible momentum.  The best way of preventing confusion now is to retain the established titles, recognise that the doctrines behind each have a radically different aim or end, and supply the interpretation of this end from history. What they have in common may be described as the prevention of error, the organisation of reason against error. I have shown that owing to the bent impressed upon it by the circumstances of its origin, the errors chiefly safeguarded by the Aristotelian logic were the errors of inconsistency. The other branch of Logic, commonly called Induction, was really a separate evolution, having its origin in a different practical need. The history of this I will trace separately after we have seen our way through the Aristotelian tradition and its accretions. The Experimental Methods are no less manifestly the germ, the evolutionary centre or starting-point, of the new Logic than the Syllogism is of the old, and the main errors safeguarded are errors of fact and inference from fact.  At this stage it will be enough to indicate briefly the broad relations between Deductive Logic and Inductive Logic.  Inductive Logic, as we now understand it--the Logic of Observation and Explanation--was first formulated and articulated to a System of Logic by J. S. Mill. It was he that added this wing to the old building. But the need of it was clearly expressed as early as the thirteenth century. Roger Bacon, the Franciscan friar (1214-1292), and not his more illustrious namesake Francis, Lord Verulam, was the real founder of Inductive Logic. It is remarkable that the same century saw Syllogistic Logic advanced to its most complete development in the system of Petrus Hispanus, a Portuguese scholar who under the title of John XXI. filled the Papal Chair for eight months in 1276-7.  A casual remark of Roger Bacon's in the course of his advocacy of Experimental Science in the _Opus Majus_ draws a clear line between the two branches of Logic. \"There are,\" he says, \"two ways of knowing, by Argument and by Experience. Argument concludes a question, but it does not make us feel certain, unless the truth be also found in experience.\"  On this basis the old Logic may be clearly distinguished from the new, taking as the general aim of Logic the protection of the mind against the errors to which it is liable in the acquisition of knowledge.  All knowledge, broadly speaking, comes either from Authority, _i.e._, by argument from accepted premisses, or from Experience. If it comes from Authority it comes through the medium of words: if it comes from Experience it comes through the senses. In taking in knowledge through words we are liable to certain errors; and in taking in knowledge through the senses we are liable to certain errors. To protect against the one is the main end of \"Deductive\" Logic: to protect against the other is the main end of \"Inductive\" Logic. As a matter of fact the pith of treatises on Deduction and Induction is directed to those ends respectively, the old meanings of Deduction and Induction as formal processes (to be explained afterwards) being virtually ignored.  There is thus no antagonism whatever between the two branches of Logic. They are directed to different ends. The one is supplementary to the other. The one cannot supersede the other.  Aristotelian Logic can never become superfluous as long as men are apt to be led astray by words. Its ultimate business is to safeguard in the interpretation of the tradition of language. The mere syllogistic, the bare forms of equivalent or consistent expression, have a very limited utility, as we shall see. But by cogent sequence syllogism leads to proposition, and proposition to term, and term to a close study of the relations between words and thoughts and things.      [Footnote 1: We know for certain--and it is one of the     evidences of the importance attached to this trivial-looking     pastime--that two of the great teacher's logical treatises,     the Topics and the Sophistical Refutations, were written     especially for the guidance of Questioners and Respondents.     The one instructs the disputant how to qualify himself     methodically for discussion before an ordinary audience, when     the admissions extracted from the respondent are matters of     common belief, the questioner's skill being directed to make     it appear that the respondent's position is inconsistent     with these. The other is a systematic exposure of sophistical     tricks, mostly verbal quibbles, whereby a delusive appearance     of victory in debate may be obtained. But in the concluding     chapter of the _Elenchi_, where Aristotle claims not only     that his method is superior to the empirical methods of     rival teachers, but that it is entirely original, it is the     Syllogism upon which he lays stress as his peculiar and     chief invention. The Syllogism, the pure forms of which are     expounded in his Prior Analytics, is really the centre of     Aristotle's logical system, whether the propositions to     which it is applied are matters of scientific truth as in the     Posterior Analytics, or matters of common opinion as in     the Topics. The treatise on Interpretation, _i.e._, the     interpretation of the Respondent's \"Yes\" and \"No,\" is     preliminary to the Syllogism, the reasoning of the admissions     together. Even in the half-grammatical half-logical treatise     on the Categories, the author always keeps an eye on the     Syllogistic analysis.]      [Footnote 2: Theætetus, 151 E.]      [Footnote 3: Gorgias, 473 D.]      [Footnote 4: Hipparchus, 225 A.]      [Footnote 5: In its leading and primary use, this was a mode     of debate, a duel of wits, in which two men engaged before     an audience. But the same form could be used, and was used,     notably by Socrates, not in an eristic spirit but as a means     of awakening people to the consequences of certain admissions     or first principles, and thus making vague knowledge explicit     and clear. The mind being detained on proposition after     proposition as assent was given to it, dialectic was a     valuable instrument of instruction and exposition. But     whatever the purpose of the exercise, controversial triumph,     or solid grounding in the first principles--\"the evolution     of in-dwelling conceptions\"--the central interest lay in the     syllogising or reasoning together of the separately assumed or     admitted propositions.]      [Footnote 6: Like every other fashion, Yes-and-No Dialectic     had its period, its rise and fall. The invention of it is     ascribed to Zeno the Eleatic, the answering and questioning     Zeno, who flourished about the middle of the fifth century     B.C. Socrates (469-399) was in his prime at the beginning of     the great Peloponnesian War when Pericles died in 429. In that     year Plato was born, and lived to 347, \"the olive groves of     Academe\" being established centre of his teaching from     about 386 onwards. Aristotle (384-322), who was the tutor of     Alexander the Great, established his school at the Lyceum     when Alexander became king in 336 and set out on his career     of conquest. That Yes-and-No Dialectic was then a prominent     exercise, his logical treatises everywhere bear witness. The     subsequent history of the game is obscure. It is probable that     Aristotle's thorough exposition of its legitimate arts and     illegitimate tricks helped to destroy its interest as an     amusement.]      [Footnote 7: Hamilton's _Lectures_, iii. p. 37.]   II.--LOGIC AS A PREVENTIVE OF ERROR OR FALLACY.--THE INNER SOPHIST.  Why describe Logic as a system of defence against error? Why say that its main end and aim is the organisation of reason against confusion and falsehood? Why not rather say, as is now usual, that its end is the attainment of truth? Does this not come to the same thing?  Substantially, the meaning is the same, but the latter expression is more misleading. To speak of Logic as a body of rules for the investigation of truth has misled people into supposing that Logic claims to be an art of Discovery, that it claims to lay down rules by simply observing which investigators may infallibly arrive at new truths. Now, this does not hold even of the Logic of Induction, still less of the older Logic, the precise relation of which to truth will become apparent as we proceed. It is only by keeping men from going astray and by disabusing them when they think they have reached their destination that Logic helps men on the road to truth. Truth often lies hid in the centre of a maze, and logical rules only help the searcher onwards by giving him warning when he is on the wrong track and must try another. It is the searcher's own impulse that carries him forward: Logic does not so much beckon him on to the right path as beckon him back from the wrong. In laying down the conditions of correct interpretation, of valid argument, of trustworthy evidence, of satisfactory explanation, Logic shows the inquirer how to test and purge his conclusions, not how to reach them.  To discuss, as is sometimes done, whether Fallacies lie within the proper sphere"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31796"],["title","Logic, Inductive and Deductive (#4)"],["body","Logic, is to obscure the real connexion between Fallacies and Logic. It is the existence of Fallacies that calls Logic into existence; as a practical science Logic is needed as a protection against Fallacies. Such historically is its origin. We may, if we like, lay down an arbitrary rule that a treatise on Logic should be content to expound the correct forms of interpretation and reasoning and should not concern itself with the wrong. If we take this view we are bound to pronounce Fallacies extra-logical. But to do so is simply to cripple the usefulness of Logic as a practical science. The manipulation of the bare logical forms, without reference to fallacious departures from them, is no better than a nursery exercise. Every correct form in Logic is laid down as a safeguard against some erroneous form to which men are prone, whether in the interpretation of argument or the interpretation of experience, and the statement and illustration of the typical forms of wrong procedure should accompany _pari passu_ the exposition of the right procedure.   In accordance with this principle, I shall deal with special fallacies, special snares or pitfalls--misapprehension of words, misinterpretation of propositions, misunderstanding of arguments, misconstruction of facts, evidences, or signs--each in connexion with its appropriate safeguard. This seems to me the most profitable method. But at this stage, it may be worth while, by way of emphasising the need for Logic as a science of rational belief, to take a survey of the most general tendencies to irrational belief, the chief kinds of illusion or bias that are rooted in the human constitution. We shall then better appreciate the magnitude of the task that Logic attempts in seeking to protect reason against its own fallibility and the pressure of the various forces that would usurp its place.  It is a common notion that we need Logic to protect us against the arts of the Sophist, the dishonest juggler with words and specious facts. But in truth the Inner Sophist, whose instruments are our own inborn propensities to error, is a much more dangerous enemy. For once that we are the victims of designing Sophists, we are nine times the victims of our own irrational impulses and prejudices. Men generally deceive themselves before they deceive others.  Francis Bacon drew attention to these inner perverting influences, these universal sources of erroneous belief, in his _De Augmentis_ and again in his _Novum Organum_, under the designation of _Idola_ ([Greek: eidôla]), deceptive appearances of truth, illusions. His classification of _Idola--Idola Tribus_, illusions common to all men, illusions of the race; _Idola Specus_, personal illusions, illusions peculiar to the \"den\" in which each man lives; _Idola Fori_, illusions of conversation, vulgar prejudices embodied in words; _Idola Theatri_, illusions of illustrious doctrine, illusions imposed by the dazzling authority of great names--is defective as a classification inasmuch as the first class includes all the others, but like all his writings it is full of sagacious remarks and happy examples. Not for the sake of novelty, but because it is well that matters so important should be presented from more than one point of view, I shall follow a division adapted from the more scientific, if less picturesque, arrangement of Professor Bain, in his chapter on the Fallacious Tendencies of the Human Mind.[1]  The illusions to which we are all subject may best be classified according to their origin in the depths of our nature. Let us try to realise how illusory beliefs arise.  What is a belief? One of the uses of Logic is to set us thinking about such simple terms. An exhaustive analysis and definition of belief is one of the most difficult of psychological problems. We cannot enter upon that: let us be content with a few simple characters of belief.  First, then, belief is a state of mind. Second, this state of mind is outward-pointing: it has a reference beyond itself, a reference to the order of things outside us. In believing, we hold that the world as it is, has been, or will be, corresponds to our conceptions of it. Third, belief is the guide of action: it is in accordance with what we believe that we direct our activities. If we want to know what a man really believes, we look at his action. This at least is the clue to what he believes at the moment. \"I cannot,\" a great orator once said, \"read the minds of men.\" This was received with ironical cheers. \"No,\" he retorted, \"but I can construe their acts.\" Promoters of companies are expected to invest their own money as a guarantee of good faith. If a man says he believes the world is coming to an end in a year, and takes a lease of a house for fifteen years, we conclude that his belief is not of the highest degree of strength.  The close connexion of belief with our activities, enables us to understand how illusions, false conceptions of reality, arise. The illusions of Feeling and the illusions of Custom are well understood, but other sources of illusion, which may be designated Impatient Impulse and Happy Exercise, are less generally recognised. An example or two will show what is meant. We cannot understand the strength of these perverting influences till we realise them in our own case. We detect them quickly enough in others. Seeing that in common speech the word illusion implies a degree of error amounting almost to insanity, and the illusions we speak of are such as no man is ever quite free from, it is perhaps less startling to use the word _bias_.   _The Bias of Impatient Impulse._  As a being formed for action, not only does healthy man take a pleasure in action, physical and mental, for its own sake, irrespective of consequences, but he is so charged with energy that he cannot be comfortable unless it finds a free vent. In proportion to the amount and excitability of his energy, restraint, obstruction, delay is irksome, and soon becomes a positive and intolerable pain. Any bar or impediment that gives us pause is hateful even to think of: the mere prospect annoys and worries.  Hence it arises that belief, a feeling of being prepared for action, a conviction that the way is clear before us for the free exercise of our activities, is a very powerful and exhilarating feeling, as much a necessity of happy existence as action itself. We see this when we consider how depressing and uncomfortable a condition is the opposite state to belief, namely, doubt, perplexity, hesitation, uncertainty as to our course. And realising this, we see how strong a bias we have in this fact of our nature, this imperious inward necessity for action; how it urges us to act without regard to consequences, and to jump at beliefs without inquiry. For, unless inquiry itself is our business, a self-sufficient occupation, it means delay and obstruction.  This ultimate fact of our nature, this natural inbred constitutional impatience, explains more than half of the wrong beliefs that we form and persist in. We must have a belief of some kind: we cannot be happy till we get it, and we take up with the first that seems to show the way clear. It may be right or it may be wrong: it is not, of course, necessarily always wrong: but that, so far as we are concerned, is a matter of accident. The pressing need for a belief of some sort, upon which our energies may proceed in anticipation at least, will not allow us to stop and inquire. Any course that offers a relief from doubt and hesitation, any conviction that lets the will go free, is eagerly embraced.  It may be thought that this can apply only to beliefs concerning the consequences of our own personal actions, affairs in which we individually play a part. It is from them, no doubt, that our nature takes this set: but the habit once formed is extended to all sorts of matters in which we have no personal interest. Tell an ordinary Englishman, it has been wittily said, that it is a question whether the planets are inhabited, and he feels bound at once to have a confident opinion on the point. The strength of the conviction bears no proportion to the amount of reason spent in reaching it, unless it may be said that as a general rule the less a belief is reasoned the more confidently it is held.  \"A grocer,\" writes Mr. Bagehot in an acute essay on \"The Emotion of Conviction,\"[2] \"has a full creed as to foreign policy, a young lady a complete theory of the Sacraments, as to which neither has any doubt. A girl in a country parsonage will be sure that Paris never can be taken, or that Bismarck is a wretch.\" An attitude of philosophic doubt, of suspended judgment, is repugnant to the natural man. Belief is an independent joy to him.  This bias works in all men. While there is life, there is pressure from within on belief, tending to push reason aside. The force of the pressure, of course, varies with individual temperament, age, and other circumstances. The young are more credulous than the old, as having greater energy: they are apt, as Bacon puts it, to be \"carried away by the sanguine element in their temperament\". Shakespeare's Laertes is a study of the impulsive temperament, boldly contrasted with Hamlet, who has more discourse of reason. When Laertes hears that his father has been killed, he hurries home, collects a body of armed sympathisers, bursts into the presence of the king, and threatens with his vengeance--the wrong man. He never pauses to make inquiry: like Hotspur he is \"a wasp-stung and impatient fool\"; he must wreak his revenge on somebody, and at once. Hamlet's father also has been murdered, but his reason must be satisfied before he proceeds to his revenge, and when doubtful proof is offered, he waits for proof more relative.  Bacon's _Idola Tribus_ and Dr. Bain's illustrations of incontinent energy, are mostly examples of unreasoning intellectual activity, hurried generalisations, unsound and superficial analogies, rash hypotheses.
