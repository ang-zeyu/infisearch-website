Down there in camp everything was straight and systematic. Every feller what don't have nothin' in his shoulder-straps bosses all the fellers what hain't no shoulder-straps at all. The feller what has one bar in his shoulder-straps bosses all the fellers what hain't nothin in theirs, and the feller what has two bars bosses the fellers with but one; the feller with leaves gives orders to the fellers with bars; the feller with an eagle lays clear over him, and the man with a star jest makes everybody jump when he talks. Out at the depot on Bean Blossom Crick Sol Pringle has the say about everything. He knows when the trains come and when they go, and what goes into 'em. This seems to be a betwixt and between place, neither pork nor bacon, I don't like it at all, I always want things straight--either one thing or t'other--reg'ler close communion, total-immersion Babtist, or free-for-all, shoutin' Methodist.\"  \"I think I can help you, 'Squire,\" said a big, goodnatured-looking civilian railroad man, who had become interested in the Deacon's troubles. \"I've bin around with the Assistant Yard-Boss pickin' out a lot o' empties to hustle back to Nashville for grub. That's one o' them over there, on the furthest switch--X634. See? It's got a chalk mark on it. I'll help you carry your boys into it, and fix 'em comfortable, and you'll go back with it all right.\"  The Deacon turned gladly to him. The man summoned some of his friends, who speedily transferred Si and Shorty, with their belongings, cedar boughs and all, to the car, and made them as comfortable as possible, and added some little offerings of their own to contribute to the ease of the journey. They bestired themselves to find something to eat that the boys would relish, and brought out from somewhere a can of peaches and one of tomatoes, which proved very acceptable. The Deacon was overwhelmed with gratitude.  \"I want every one of you to come up to my house, whenever you git a chance,\" he said, \"and make a long visit. You shall have the very best that there is on my farm, and if you don't live well it won't be Maria Klegg's fault. She'll jest lay herself out to be good to men who's bin good to her son, and when she lays herself out to git up a dinner the Burnett House in Cincinnati takes a back seat.\"  Feeling entirely at ease, he climbed into the car, with a copy of the Cincinnati Gazette, which he had bought of a newsboy, lighted his pipe, put on his spectacles, and settled down to a labored, but thorough perusal of the paper, beginning at the head-lines on the upper left-hand corner, and taking in every word, advertisements and all, as systematically as he would weed a garden-bed or milk a cow. The Deacon never did anything slip-shod, especially when he had to pay 10 cents for a copy of the Cincinnati Gazette. He was going to get his full money's worth, and if it was not in the news and editorials, he would take it out of the advertisements and patent medicine testimonials. He was just going through a convincing testimonial to the manifold virtues of Spalding's Prepared Glue, when there was a bump, the sound of coupling, and his car began to move off.  \"Glory, we're goin' home!\" shouted the Deacon, waving his paper exultingly to the railroad men who had been so helpful. But he exulted prematurely. The engine rattled ahead sharply for a few hundred yards, and then began backing to opposite the spot where it had started from.  \"That's all right,\" said his railroads friends encouragingly. \"She's just run back on the other switch to take up a couple more cars. She'll go ahead all right presently.\"  \"I hope it is all right,\" said the Deacon, a little abashed; \"but I never had any use for a hoss that went back more'n he did forrard.\"  But this was only the first of many similar experiences, which occupied the rest of the day.  \"Good gracious, do they want to wear the track and wheels and injines clean out?\" grumbled the Deacon. \"No wonder they're all out o' order. If I jammed my wagon back and forrard this way it wouldn't last a month. No wonder war-taxes are high, with everybody doin' all they kin to waste and destroy property. I've a great mind to write to Gen. Rosecrans or President Lincoln callin' attention to the way their hired men monkey around, and waste time, and don't accomplish nothin'.\"  Some time after dark, and after the Deacon's patience had become well-nigh exhausted, the railroad men came around with a lantern, and told him that at last it was settled, and the train would move out very soon. There had been conflicting orders during the day, but now the Chief Quartermaster at Nashville had ordered the train forward. Sure enough, the train pulled out presently, and went rattling up toward Shelbyville. Again the Deacon's heart bounded high, and after watching the phantom-like roadside for awhile, he grew very sleepy, and crawled in alongside of Si. He waked up at daylight, and went at once to the car-door hopefully expecting to recognize the outskirts of Nashville, or at least Murfreesboro. To his dismay, he saw the same sutler's shanty, mule-corral, pile of baled-hay, and the embalmer's sign on a tree which had been opposite them while standing on the track at Bridgeport.  Shorty swore volubly, and for once the Deacon did not check him, but was sinfully conscious in his heart of approving the profanity.  \"Swearin's awful wicked and low,\" he said to himself. \"A sensible man can get along without it ordinarily, by the grace o' God and hard tryin', though I've knowed a yoke o' dumbed steers in a stumpy field to purty nigh overcome me. But the army's no common experience, and I s'pose a man's justified in bustin' out in a time like this. Old Job was lucky that he didn't have to ride on an army railroad.\"  [Illustration: IN DESPAIR, THE DEACON TURNED TO A MAJOR. 77]  His railroad friend again came up with some hot coffee and broiled meat, and explained that after the train had reached a station some miles out it got orders to run back and clear the track for some trains of troops from the Army of the Potomac which were being rushed through. The Deacon's heart almost sank in despair, but he took the coffee and meat, and helped the boys to it. As they were all eating they heard a voice outside which struck on the chords of their memories:  \"Where is that Yard-Boss? Where is that Yard-Boss? Find him and send him to me, immediately.\"  \"That sounds like Levi Rosenbaum,\" said Shorty.  Si nodded affirmatively.  The Deacon looked out,' and recognized Levi dressed in the hight of fashion. On his jetty curls sat a glossy silk hat, his clothes looked as if just taken from the tailor's shop, and they fitted him to perfection. A large diamond flashed from his scarfpin, and another gleamed in a ring on his right hand as he waved it in giving orders to the men around. Every eye was fixed on him, and when he spoke there was hastening to obey. The Yard-Boss was coming at a run.  \"Why are those cotton-cars still standing there this morning, after the orders I gave you yesterday?\" asked Levi, in tones of severest reprehension, as that official came up.  \"Why, Mr. Rosenbaum,\" said that official apologetically--he was the same man who had so severely snubbed the Deacon the day before--\"you see I had the train made up and all ready to start, when there came orders--\"  \"Whose orders?\" demanded Levi. \"Who dares give orders that over-ride mine? You go at once and have an engine--the best one you have--hitched on. Couple on my car, and be ready to start in 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes I give you,\" continued he, looking at his watch. \"Tell the Train Dispatcher to clear everything into switches until we get to Murfreesboro, and have the operator at Murfreesboro lay by everything till we get to Nashville.\"  The Yard-Boss rushed off to execute the order.  \"Great Jehosephat, what's come over Levi?\" muttered Shorty. \"Has he become the High-muk-a-muk of the whole army? Have they put him in Gen. Rosecrans's place?\"  \"Will I dare to speak to such a high-flyer?\" said the Deacon, doubtfully.  Levi's eyes, flashed from one point to another, rested on the Deacon for a moment, and the latter wreathed his face with a grin of recognition. Then Levi's stern countenance relaxed with a still broader grin.  \"Hello, 'Squire,\" he shouted joyously. \"Is that you? Where are the boys?\" And he rushed forward with outstretched hand.  \"I've got 'em in here, badly hurt,\" answered the Deacon, jumping to the ground and grasping the outstretched hand in his own horny palm. \"I'm very glad to see you, Mr. Rosenbaum.\"  \"Glad ain't no name for it,\" said Levi. \"Did you say you'd got the boys in there? Here, you men, bring me two or three of those cracker-boxes.\"  By the aid of the cracker-boxes Levi climbed into the car, and shook the boys' hands, and cried and talked mingled gladness and sympathy in his broken English.  \"What place have you got, and what are you doin' down here, Mr. Rosenbaum,\" the Deacon asked in the first lull.  \"O, I'm Special Agent of the Treasury in charge of the cotton business. You see, these rascals have been stealing the Treasury blind, in cotton, and they had to have an honest man down here, who was up to all their tricks, and wouldn't stand no nonsense. They sent me, and gave me orders which make me boss of the whole outfit. None of them outrank me about these trains.\"  \"So I see,\" said the Deacon. \"Wisht I'd had a handful of your authority yesterday.\"  \"Here, we're wasting time,\" said Levi suddenly. \"You're tryin' to get these boys back home. I'll see that they get as far as the Ohio River as fast as the train'll go. Here, six or eight of you men pick up these boys and carry them over to my car there. Handle them as if they were eggs, for they're my friends.\"  There was no lack of willing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31776"],["title","Si Klegg, Book 6 (#0)"],["body","KLEGG  SI AND SHORTY, WITH THEIR BOY RECRUITS, ENTER ON THE ATLANTA CAMPAIGN   By John McElroy    BOOK No. 6    PUBLISHED BY  THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE COMPANY,  WASHINGTON, D.

These sketches are the original ones published in The National Tribune, revised and enlarged somewhat by the author. How true they are to nature every veteran can abundantly testify from his own service. Really, only the name of the regiment was invented. There is no doubt that there were several men of the name of Josiah Klegg in the Union Army, and who did valiant service for the Government. They had experiences akin to, if not identical with, those narrated here, and substantially every man who faithfully and bravely carried a musket in defense of the best Government on earth had sometimes, if not often, experiences of which those of Si Klegg are a strong reminder.

SHORTY BEGINS BEING A FATHER TO PETE SKIDMORE.  \"Come, my boy,\" Si said kindly. \"Don't cry. You're a soldier now, and soldiers don't cry. Stop it.\"  \"Dod durn it,\" blubbered Pete, \"I ain't cryin' bekase Pm skeered. I'm cryin' bekase I'm afeared you'll lose me. I know durned well you'll lose me yit, with all this foolin' around.\"  \"No, we won't,\" Si assured him. \"You just keep with us and you'll be all right.\"  \"Here, you blim-blammed, moon-eyed suckers, git offen that 'ere crossin',\" yelled at them a fireman whose engine came tearing down toward the middle of the squad. \"Hain't you got no more sense than to stand on a crossin'?\"  He hurled a chunk of coal at the squad, which hastily followed Si to the other side of the track.  \"Hello, there; where are you goin', you chuckle-headed clodhoppers?\" yelled the men on another train rushing down from a different direction. \"This ain't no hayfield. Go back home and drive cows, and git out o' the way o' men who're at work.\"  There was more scurrying, and when at last Si reached a clear space, he had only a portion of his squad with him, while Shorty was vowing he would not go a step farther until he had licked a railroad man. But the engines continued to whirl back and forth in apparently purposeless confusion, and the moment that he fixed upon any particular victim of his wrath, he was sure to be compelled to jump out of the way of a locomotive clanging up from an unexpected direction and interposing a train of freight cars between him and the man he was after.  Si was too deeply exercised about getting his squad together to pay attention to Shorty or the jeering, taunting railroaders. He became very fearful that some of them had been caught and badly hurt, probably killed, by the remorseless locomotives.  \"This's wuss'n a battle,\" he remarked to the boys around him. \"I'd ruther take you out on the skirmish-line than through them trains agin.\"  However, he had come to get some comprehension of the lay of the ground and the movements of the trains by this time, and by careful watching succeeded in gathering in his boys, one after another, until he had them all but little Pete Skidmore. The opinion grew among them that Pete had unwisely tried to keep up with the bigger boys, who had jumped across the track in front of a locomotive, and had been caught and crushed beneath the wheels. He had been seen up to a certain time, and then those who were last with him had been so busy getting out of the way that they had forgotten to look for him. Si calmed Shorty down enough to get him to forget the trainmen for awhile and take charge of the squad while he went to look for Pete. He had become so bewildered that he could not tell the direction whence they had come, or where the tragedy was likely to have happened. The farther he went in attempting to penetrate the maze of moving trains, the more hopeless the quest seemed. Finally he went over to the engineer of a locomotive that was standing still and inquired if he had heard of any accident to a boy soldier during the day.  \"Seems to me that I did hear some o' the boys talkin' about No. 47 or 63 havin' run over a boy, or something,\" answered the engineer carelessly, without removing his pipe from his mouth. \"I didn't pay no attention to it. Them things happen every day. Sometimes it's my engine, sometimes it's some other man's. But I hain't run over nobody for nigh a month now.\"  \"Confound it,\" said Si savagely; \"you talk about runnin' over men as if it was part o' your business.\"  \"No,\" said the engineer languidly, as he reached up for his bell-rope. \"'Tain't, so to speak, part o' our regler business. But the yard's awfully crowded, old Sherman's makin' it do five times the work it was calculated for, trains has got to be run on the dot, and men must keep off the track if they don't want to git hurt. Stand clear, there, yourself, for I'm goin' to start.\"  Si returned dejectedly to the place where he had left his squad. The expression of his face told the news before he had spoken a word. It was now getting dark, and he and Shorty decided that it was the best thing to go into bivouac where they were and wait till morning before attempting to penetrate the maze beyond in search of their regiment. They gathered up some wood, built fires, made coffee and ate the remainder of their rations. They were all horribly depressed by little Pete Skidmore's fate, and Si and Shorty, accustomed as they were to violent deaths, could not free themselves from responsibility however much they tried to reason it out as an unavoidable accident. They could not talk to one another, but each wrapped himself up in his blanket and sat moodily, a little distance from the fires, chewing the cud of bitter fancies. Neither could bear the thought of reporting to their regiment that they had been unable to take care of the smallest boy in their squad. Si's mind went back to Peter Skidmore's home, and his mother, whose heart would break over the news.  The clanging and whistling of the trains kept up unabated, and Si thought they made the most hateful din that ever assailed his ears.  Presently one of the trains stopped opposite them and a voice called from the locomotive:  \"Do you men know of a squad of Injianny recruits commanded by Serg't Klegg?\"  \"Yes, here they are,\" said Si, springing up. \"I'm Serg't Klegg.\"  [Illustration: LITTLE PETE FOUND 13]  \"That's him,\" piped out Pete Skidmore's voice from the engine, with a very noticeable blubber of joy. \"He's the same durned old-fool that I kept tellin' all the time he'd lose me if he wasn't careful, and he went and done it all the same.\"  \"Well, here's your boy,\" continued the first voice. \"Be mighty glad you've got him back and see that you take care o' him after this. My fireman run down on the cow-ketcher and snatched him up just in the nick o' time. A second more and he'd bin mince-meat. Men what can't take better care o' boys oughtn't to be allowed to have charge of 'em. But the Government gits all sorts o' damn fools for $13 a month.\"  Si was so delighted at getting Pete back unhurt that he did not have the heart to reply to the engineer's gibes.    CHAPTER II. SI AND SHORTY COME VERY NEAR LOSING THEIR BOYS.  ALL healthy boys have a strong tincture of the savage in them. The savage alternately worships his gods with blind, unreasoning idolatry, or treats them with measureless contumely.  Boys do the same with their heroes. It is either fervent admiration, or profound distrust, merging into actual contempt. After the successful little skirmish with the guerrillas the boys were wild in their enthusiasm over Si and Shorty. They could not be made to believe that Gens. Grant, Sherman or Thomas could conduct a battle better. But the moment that Si and Shorty seemed dazed by the multitude into which they were launched, a revulsion of feeling developed, which soon threatened to be ruinous to the partners' ascendancy.  During the uncomfortable, wakeful night the prestige of the partners still further diminished. In their absence the army had been turned topsy-turvy and reorganized in a most bewildering way. The old familiar guide-marks had disappeared. Two of the great corps had been abolished--consolidated into one, with a new number and a strange commander. Two corps of strange troops had come in from the Army of the Potomac, and had been consolidated into one, taking an old corps' number. Divisions, brigades and regiments had been totally changed in commanders, formation and position. Then the Army of the Tennessee had come in, to complicate the seeming"]]]
