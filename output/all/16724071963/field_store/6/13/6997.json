The quiet man in the brown tweed suit had spoken; now he looked as though he were very much regretting it.  \"Is there such a thing as Operation Triple Cross?\" Fitch was asking.  \"No, no. I never heard anything about that; that wasn't what I meant. It was this Terran Federation thing,\" the major said, a trifle too quickly and too smoothly. He turned to Chalmers. \"You never did any work for PSPB; did you ever talk to anybody who did?\" he asked.  \"I don't even know what the letters mean,\" Chalmers replied.  \"Politico-Strategic Planning Board. It's all pretty hush-hush, but this term Terran Federation is a tentative name for a proposed organization to take the place of the U. N. if that organization breaks up. It's nothing particularly important, and it only exists on paper.\"  It won't exist only on paper very long, Chalmers thought. He was wondering what Operation Triple Cross was; he had some notes on it, but he had forgotten what they were.  \"Maybe he did pick that up from somebody who'd talked indiscreetly,\" Whitburn conceded. \"But the rest of this tommyrot! Why, he was talking about how the city of Reno had been destroyed by an explosion and fire, literally wiped off the map. There's an example for you!\"  He'd forgotten about that, too. It had been a relatively minor incident in the secret struggle of the Subwar; now he remembered having made a note about it. He was sure that it followed closely after the assassination of Khalid ib'n Hussein. He turned quickly to Weill.  \"Didn't you say you had to go to Reno in a day or so?\" he asked.  Weill hushed him urgently, pointing with his free hand to the recorder. The exchange prevented him from noticing that Max Pottgeiter had risen, until the old man was speaking.  \"Are you trying to tell these people that Professor Chalmers is crazy?\" he was demanding. \"Why, he has one of the best minds on the campus. I was talking to him only yesterday, in the back room at the Library. You know,\" he went on apologetically, \"my subject is Medieval History; I don't pay much attention to what's going on in the contemporary world, and I didn't understand, really, what all this excitement was about. But he explained the whole thing to me, and did it in terms that I could grasp, drawing some excellent parallels with the Byzantine Empire and the Crusades. All about the revolt at Damascus, and the sack of Beirut, and the war between Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and how the Turkish army intervened, and the invasion of Pakistan....\"  \"When did all this happen?\" one of the trustees demanded.  Pottgeiter started to explain; Chalmers realized, sickly, how much of his future history he had poured into the trusting ear of the old medievalist, the day before.  \"Good Lord, man; don't you read the papers at all?\" another of the trustees asked.  \"No! And I don't read inside-dope magazines, or science fiction. I read carefully substantiated facts. And I know when I'm talking to a sane and reasonable man. It isn't a common experience, around here.\"  Dacre passed a hand over his face. \"Doctor Whitburn,\" he said, \"I must admit that I came to this meeting strongly prejudiced against you, and I'll further admit that your own behavior here has done very little to dispel that prejudice. But I'm beginning to get some idea of what you have to contend with, here at Blanley, and I find that I must make a lot of allowances. I had no idea.... Simply no idea at all.\"  \"Look, you're getting a completely distorted picture of this, Mr. Dacre,\" Fitch broke in. \"It's precisely as I believed; Doctor Chalmers is an unusually gifted precognitive percipient. You've seen, gentlemen, how his complicated chain of precognitions about the death of Khalid has been proven veridical; I'd stake my life that every one of these precognitions will be similarly verified. And I'll stake my professional reputation that the man is perfectly sane. Of course, abnormal psychology and psychopathology aren't my subjects, but....\"  \"They're not my subjects, either,\" Whitburn retorted, \"but I know a lunatic by his ravings.\"  \"Doctor Fitch is taking an entirely proper attitude,\" Pottgeiter said, \"in pointing out that abnormal psychology is a specialized branch, outside his own field. I wouldn't dream, myself, of trying to offer a decisive opinion on some point of Roman, or Babylonian, history. Well, if the question of Doctor Chalmers' sanity is at issue here, let's consult somebody who specializes in insanity. I don't believe that anybody here is qualified even to express an opinion on that subject, Doctor Whitburn least of all.\"  Whitburn turned on him angrily. \"Oh, shut up, you doddering old fool!\" he shouted. \"Look; there's another of them!\" he told the trustees. \"Another deadhead on the faculty that this Tenure Law keeps me from getting rid of. He's as bad as Chalmers, himself. You just heard that string of nonsense he was spouting. Why, his courses have been noted among the students for years as snap courses in which nobody ever has to do any work....\"  Chalmers was on his feet again, thoroughly angry. Abuse of himself he could take; talking that way about gentle, learned, old Pottgeiter was something else.  \"I think Doctor Pottgeiter's said the most reasonable thing I've heard since I came in here,\" he declared. \"If my sanity is to be questioned, I insist that it be questioned by somebody qualified to do so.\"  [Illustration: Had the sane restrained the insane, or was it the other way around?]  Weill set his recorder on the floor and jumped up beside him, trying to haul him back into his seat.  \"For God's sake, man! Sit down and shut up!\" he hissed.  Chalmers shook off his hand. \"No, I won't shut up! This is the only way to settle this, once and for all. And when my sanity's been vindicated, I'm going to sue this fellow....\"  Whitburn started to make some retort, then stopped short. After a moment, he smiled nastily.  \"Do I understand, Doctor Chalmers, that you would be willing to submit to psychiatric examination?\" he asked.  \"Don't agree; you're putting your foot in a trap!\" Weill told him urgently.  \"Of course, I agree, as long as the examination is conducted by a properly qualified psychiatrist.\"  \"How about Doctor Hauserman at Northern State Mental Hospital?\" Whitburn asked quickly. \"Would you agree to an examination by him?\"  \"Excellent!\" Fitch exclaimed. \"One of the best men in the field. I'd accept his opinion unreservedly.\"  Weill started to object again; Chalmers cut him off. \"Doctor Hauserman will be quite satisfactory to me. The only question is, would he be available?\"  \"I think he would,\" Dacre said, glancing at his watch. \"I wonder if he could be reached now.\" He got to his feet. \"Telephone in your outer office, Doctor Whitburn? Fine. If you gentlemen will excuse me....\"  It was a good fifteen minutes before he returned, smiling.  \"Well, gentlemen, it's all arranged,\" he said. \"Doctor Hauserman is quite willing to examine Doctor Chalmers--with the latter's consent, of course.\"  \"He'll have it. In writing, if he wishes.\"  \"Yes, I assured him on that point. He'll be here about noon tomorrow--it's a hundred and fifty miles from the hospital, but the doctor flies his own plane--and the examination can start at two in the afternoon. He seems familiar with the facilities of the psychology department, here; I assured him that they were at his disposal. Will that be satisfactory to you, Doctor Chalmers?\"  \"I have a class at that time, but one of the instructors can take it over--if holding classes will be possible around here tomorrow,\" he said. \"Now, if you gentlemen will pardon me, I think I'll go home and get some sleep.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Weill came up to the apartment with him. He mixed a couple of drinks and they went into the living room with them.  \"Just in case you don't know what you've gotten yourself into,\" Weill said, \"this Hauserman isn't any ordinary couch-pilot; he's the state psychiatrist. If he gets the idea you aren't sane, he can commit you to a hospital, and I'll bet that's exactly what Whitburn had in mind when he suggested him. And I don't trust this man Dacre. I thought he was on our side, at the start, but that was before your friends got into the act.\" He frowned into his drink. \"And I don't like the way that Intelligence major was acting, toward the last. If he thinks you know something you are not supposed to, a mental hospital may be his idea of a good place to put you away.\"  \"You don't think this man Hauserman would allow himself to be influenced ...? No. You just don't think I'm sane. Do you?\"  \"I know what Hauserman'll think. He'll think this future history business is a classical case of systematized schizoid delusion. I wish I'd never gotten into this case. I wish I'd never even heard of you! And another thing; in case you get past Hauserman all right, you can forget about that damage-suit bluff of mine. You would not stand a chance with it in court.\"  \"In spite of what happened to Khalid?\"  \"After tomorrow, I won't stay in the same room with anybody who even mentions that name to me. Well, win or lose, it'll be over tomorrow and then I can leave here.\"  \"Did you tell me you were going to Reno?\" Chalmers asked. \"Don't do it. You remember Whitburn mentioning how I spoke about an explosion there? It happened just a couple of days after the murder of Khalid. There was--will be--a trainload of high explosives in the railroad yard; it'll be the biggest non-nuclear explosion since the _Mont Blanc_ blew up in Halifax harbor in World War One....\"  Weill threw his drink into the fire; he must have avoided throwing the glass in with it by a last-second exercise of self-control.  \"Well,\" he said, after a brief struggle to master himself. \"One thing about the legal profession; you do hear the damnedest things!... Good night, Professor. And try--please try, for the sake of your poor harried lawyer--to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18584"],["title","The Edge of the Knife (#8)"],["body","your mouth shut about things like that, at least till after you get through with Hauserman. And when you're talking to him, don't, don't, for heaven's sake, _don't_, volunteer anything!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The room was a pleasant, warmly-colored, place. There was a desk, much like the ones in the classrooms, and six or seven wicker armchairs. A lot of apparatus had been pushed back along the walls; the dust-covers were gay cretonne. There was a couch, with more apparatus, similarly covered, beside it. Hauserman was seated at the desk when Chalmers entered.  He rose, and they shook hands. A man of about his own age, smooth-faced, partially bald. Chalmers tried to guess something of the man's nature from his face, but could read nothing. A face well trained to keep its owner's secrets.  \"Something to smoke, Professor,\" he began, offering his cigarette case.  \"My pipe, if you don't mind.\" He got it out and filled it.  \"Any of those chairs,\" Hauserman said, gesturing toward them.  They were all arranged to face the desk. He sat down, lighting his pipe. Hauserman nodded approvingly; he was behaving calmly, and didn't need being put at ease. They talked at random--at least, Hauserman tried to make it seem so--for some time about his work, his book about the French Revolution, current events. He picked his way carefully through the conversation, alert for traps which the psychiatrist might be laying for him. Finally, Hauserman said:  \"Would you mind telling me just why you felt it advisable to request a psychiatric examination, Professor?\"  \"I didn't request it. But when the suggestion was made, by one of my friends, in reply to some aspersions of my sanity, I agreed to it.\"  \"Good distinction. And why was your sanity questioned? I won't deny that I had heard of this affair, here, before Mr. Dacre called me, last evening, but I'd like to hear your version of it.\"  He went into that, from the original incident in Modern History IV, choosing every word carefully, trying to concentrate on making a good impression upon Hauserman, and at the same time finding that more \"memories\" of the future were beginning to seep past the barrier of his consciousness. He tried to dam them back; when he could not, he spoke with greater and greater care lest they leak into his speech.  \"I can't recall the exact manner in which I blundered into it. The fact that I did make such a blunder was because I was talking extemporaneously and had wandered ahead of my text. I was trying to show the results of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, and the partition of the Middle East into a loose collection of Arab states, and the passing of British and other European spheres of influence following the Second. You know, when you consider it, the Islamic Caliphate was inevitable; the surprising thing is that it was created by a man like Khalid....\"  He was talking to gain time, and he suspected that Hauserman knew it. The \"memories\" were coming into his mind more and more strongly; it was impossible to suppress them. The period of anarchy following Khalid's death would be much briefer, and much more violent, than he had previously thought. Tallal ib'n Khalid would be flying from England even now; perhaps he had already left the plane to take refuge among the black tents of his father's Bedouins. The revolt at Damascus would break out before the end of the month; before the end of the year, the whole of Syria and Lebanon would be in bloody chaos, and the Turkish army would be on the march.  \"Yes. And you allowed yourself to be carried a little beyond the present moment, into the future, without realizing it? Is that it?\"  \"Something like that,\" he replied, wide awake to the trap Hauserman had set, and fearful that it might be a blind, to disguise the real trap. \"History follows certain patterns. I'm not a Toynbean, by any manner of means, but any historian can see that certain forces generally tend to produce similar effects. For instance, space travel is now a fact; our government has at present a military base on Luna. Within our lifetimes--certainly within the lifetimes of my students--there will be explorations and attempts at colonization on Mars and Venus. You believe that, Doctor?\"  \"Oh, unreservedly. I'm not supposed to talk about it, but I did some work on the Philadelphia Project, myself. I'd say that every major problem of interplanetary flight had been solved before the first robot rocket was landed on Luna.\"  \"Yes. And when Mars and Venus are colonized, there will be the same historic situations, at least in general shape, as arose when the European powers were colonizing the New World, or, for that matter, when the Greek city-states were throwing out colonies across the Aegean. That's the sort of thing we call projecting the past into the future through the present.\"  Hauserman nodded. \"But how about the details? Things like the assassination of a specific personage. How can you extrapolate to a thing like that?\"  \"Well....\" More \"memories\" were coming to the surface; he tried to crowd them back. \"I do my projecting in what you might call fictionalized form; try to fill in the details from imagination. In the case of Khalid, I was trying to imagine what would happen if his influence were suddenly removed from Near Eastern and Middle Eastern, affairs. I suppose I constructed an imaginary scene of his assassination....\"  He went on at length. Mohammed and Noureed were common enough names. The Middle East was full of old U. S. weapons. Stoning was the traditional method of execution; it diffused responsibility so that no individual could be singled out for blood-feud vengeance.  \"You have no idea how disturbed I was when the whole thing happened, exactly as I had described it,\" he continued. \"And worst of all, to me, was this Intelligence officer showing up; I thought I was really in for it!\"  \"Then you've never really believed that you had real knowledge of the future?\"  \"I'm beginning to, since I've been talking to these Psionics and Parapsychology people,\" he laughed. It sounded, he hoped, like a natural and unaffected laugh. \"They seem to be convinced that I have.\"  There would be an Eastern-inspired uprising in Azerbaijan by the middle of the next year; before autumn, the Indian Communists would make their fatal attempt to seize East Pakistan. The Thirty Days' War would be the immediate result. By that time, the Lunar Base would be completed and ready; the enemy missiles would be aimed primarily at the rocketports from which it was supplied. Delivered without warning, it should have succeeded--except that every rocketport had its secret duplicate and triplicate. That was Operation Triple Cross; no wonder Major Cutler had been so startled at the words, last evening. The enemy would be utterly overwhelmed under the rain of missiles from across space, but until the moon-rockets began to fall, the United States would suffer grievously.  \"Honestly, though, I feel sorry for my friend Fitch,\" he added. \"He's going to be frightfully let down when some more of my alleged prophecies misfire on him. But I really haven't been deliberately deceiving him.\"  And Blanley College was at the center of one of the areas which would receive the worst of the thermonuclear hell to come. And it would be a little under a year....  \"And that's all there is to it!\" Hauserman exclaimed, annoyance in his voice. \"I'm amazed that this man Whitburn allowed a thing like this to assume the proportions it did. I must say that I seem to have gotten the story about this business in a very garbled form indeed.\" He laughed shortly. \"I came here convinced that you were mentally unbalanced. I hope you won't take that the wrong way, Professor,\" he hastened to add. \"In my profession, anything can be expected. A good psychiatrist can never afford to forget how sharp and fine is the knife-edge.\"  \"The knife-edge!\" The words startled him. He had been thinking, at that moment, of the knife-edge, slicing moment after moment relentlessly away from the future, into the past, at each slice coming closer and closer to the moment when the missiles of the Eastern Axis would fall. \"I didn't know they still resorted to surgery, in mental cases,\" he added, trying to cover his break.  \"Oh, no; all that sort of thing is as irrevocably discarded as the whips and shackles of Bedlam. I meant another kind of knife-edge; the thin, almost invisible, line which separates sanity from non-sanity. From madness, to use a deplorable lay expression.\" Hauserman lit another cigarette. \"Most minds are a lot closer to it than their owners suspect, too. In fact, Professor, I was so convinced that yours had passed over it that I brought with me a commitment form, made out all but my signature, for you.\" He took it from his pocket and laid it on the desk. \"The modern equivalent of the _lettre-de-cachet_, I suppose the author of a book on the French Revolution would call it. I was all ready to certify you as mentally unsound, and commit you to Northern State Mental Hospital.\"  Chalmers sat erect in his chair. He knew where that was; on the other side of the mountains, in the one part of the state completely untouched by the H-bombs of the Thirty Days' War. Why, the town outside which the hospital stood had been a military headquarters during the period immediately after the bombings, and the center from which all the rescue work in the state had been directed.  \"And you thought you could commit me to Northern State!\" he demanded, laughing scornfully, and this time he didn't try to make the laugh sound natural and unaffected. \"You--confine _me_, anywhere? Confine a poor old history professor's body, yes, but that isn't me. I'm universal; I exist in all space-time. When this old body I'm wearing now was writing that book on the French Revolution, I was in Paris, watching it happen, from the fall of the Bastile to the Ninth Thermidor. I was in Basra, and saw that"]]]
