It's coming, it's coming! Here are a dozen bars crying like Magdalens, enough to split one's heart--Brr, brr!\" and Schaunard shivered in his spangled petticoat, \"if it could only split one's wood! There's a beam in my alcove which bothers me a good deal when I have company at dinner. I should like to make a fire with it--la, la, re, mi--for I feel my inspiration coming to me through the medium of a cold in the head. So much the worse, but it can't be helped. Let us continue to drown our young girl;\" and while his fingers assailed the trembling keys, Schaunard, with sparkling eyes and straining ears, gave chase to the melody which, like an impalpable sylph, hovered amid the sonorous mist which the vibrations of the instrument seemed to let loose in the room.  \"Now let us see,\" he continued, \"how my music will fit into my poet's words;\" and he hummed, in voice the reverse of agreeable, this fragment of verse of the patent comic-opera sort:      \"The fair and youthful maiden,      As she flung her mantle by,      Threw a glance with sorrow laden      Up to the starry sky      And in the azure waters      Of the silver-waved lake.\"  \"How is that?\" he exclaimed, in transports of just indignation; \"the azure waters of a silver lake! I didn't see that. This poet is an idiot. I'll bet he never saw a lake, or silver either. A stupid ballad too, in every way; the length of the lines cramps the music. For the future I shall compose my verses myself; and without waiting, since I feel in the humour, I shall manufacture some couplets to adapt my melody to.\"  So saying, and taking his head between his hands, he assumed the grave attitude of a man who is having relations with the Muses. After a few minutes of this sacred intercourse, he had produced one of those strings of nonsense-verses which the libretti-makers call, not without reason, monsters, and which they improvise very readily as a ground-work for the composer's inspiration. Only Schaunard's were no nonsense-verses, but very good sense, expressing with sufficient clearness the inquietude awakened in his mind by the rude arrival of that date, the eighth of April.  Thus they ran:      \"Eight and eight make sixteen just,      Put down six and carry one:      My poor soul would be at rest      Could I only find some one,      Some honest poor relation,      Who'd eight hundred francs advance,      To pay each obligation,      Whenever I've a chance.\"       Chorus       \"And ere the clock on the last and fatal morning      Should sound mid-day,      To old Bernard, like a man who needs no warning,      To old Bernard, like a man who needs no warning,      To old Bernard, like a man who needs no warning,      My rent I'd pay!\"  \"The duece!\" exclaimed Schaunard, reading over his composition, \"one and some one--those rhymes are poor enough, but I have no time to make them richer. Now let us try how the notes will unite with the syllables.\" And in his peculiarly frightful nasal tone he recommenced the execution of his ballad. Satisfied with the result he had just obtained, Schaunard congratulated himself with an exultant grimace, which mounted over his nose like a circumflex accent whenever he had occasion to be pleased with himself. But this triumphant happiness was destined to have no long duration. Eleven o'clock resounded from the neighbouring steeple. Every stroke diffused itself through the room in mocking sounds which seemed to say to the unlucky Schaunard, \"Are you ready?\"  The artist bounded on his chair. \"The time flies like a bird!\" he exclaimed. \"I have but three-quarters of an hour left to find my seventy-five francs and my new lodging. I shall never get them; that would be too much like magic. Let me see: I give myself five minutes to find out how to obtain them;\" and burying his head between his knees, he descended into the depths of reflection.  The five minutes elapsed, and Schaunard raised his head without having found anything which resembled seventy-five francs.  \"Decidedly, I have but one way of getting out of this, which is simply to go away. It is fine weather and my friend Monsieur Chance may be walking in the sun. He must give me hospitality till I have found the means of squaring off with Monsieur Bernard.\"  Having stuffed into the cellar-like pockets of his overcoat all the articles they would hold, Schaunard tied up some linen in a handkerchief, and took an affectionate farewell of his home. While crossing the court, he was suddenly stopped by the porter, who seemed to be on the watch for him.  \"Hallo! Monsieur Schaunard,\" cried he, blocking up the artist's way, \"don't you remember that this is the eighth of April?\"      \"Eight and eight make sixteen just,      Put down six and carry one,\"  hummed Schaunard. \"I don't remember anything else.\"  \"You are a little behindhand then with your moving,\" said the porter; \"it is half-past eleven, and the new tenant to whom your room has been let may come any minute. You must make haste.\"  \"Let me pass, then,\" replied Schaunard; \"I am going after a cart.\"  \"No doubt, but before moving there is a little formality to be gone through. I have orders not to let you take away a hair unless you pay the three quarters due. Are you ready?\"  \"Why, of course,\" said Schaunard, making a step forward.  \"Well come into my lodge then, and I will give you your receipt.\"  \"I shall take it when I come back.\"  \"But why not at once?\" persisted the porter.  \"I am going to a money changer's. I have no change.\"  \"Ah, you are going to get change!\" replied the other, not at all at his ease. \"Then I will take care of that little parcel under your arm, which might be in your way.\"  \"Monsieur Porter,\" exclaimed the artist, with a dignified air, \"you mistrust me, perhaps! Do you think I am carrying away my furniture in a handkerchief?\"  \"Excuse me,\" answered the porter, dropping his tone a little, \"but such are my orders. Monsieur Bernard has expressly charged me not to let you take away a hair before you have paid.\"  \"But look, will you?\" said Schaunard, opening his bundle, \"these are not hairs, they are shirts, and I am taking them to my washerwoman, who lives next door to the money changer's twenty steps off.\"  \"That alters the case,\" said the porter, after he had examined the contents of the bundle. \"Would it be impolite, Monsieur Schaunard, to inquire your new address?\"  \"Rue de Rivoli!\" replied the artist, and having once got outside the gate, he made off as fast as possible.  \"Rue de Rivoli!\" muttered the porter, scratching his nose, \"it's very odd they should have let him lodgings in the Rue de Rivoli, and never come here to ask about him. Very odd, that. At any rate, he can't carry off his furniture without paying. If only the new tenant don't come moving in just as Monsieur Schaunard is moving out! That would make a nice mess! Well, sure enough,\" he exclaimed, suddenly putting his head out of his little window, \"here he comes, the new tenant!\"  In fact, a young man in a white hat, followed by a porter who did not seem over-burdened by the weight of his load, had just entered the court. \"Is my room ready?\" he demanded of the house-porter, who had stepped out to meet him.  \"Not yet, sir, but it will be in a moment. The person who occupies it has gone after a cart for his things. Meanwhile, sir, you may put your furniture in the court.\"  \"I am afraid it's going to rain,\" replied the young man, chewing a bouquet of violets which he held in his mouth, \"My furniture might be spoiled. My friend,\" continued he, turning to the man who was behind him, with something on a trunk which the porter could not exactly make out, \"put that down and go back to my old lodging to fetch the remaining valuables.\"  The man ranged along the wall several frames six or seven feet high, folded together, and apparently being capable of being extended.  \"Look here,\" said the new-comer to his follower, half opening one of the screens and showing him a rent in the canvas, \"what an accident! You have cracked my grand Venetian glass. Take more care on your second trip, especially with my library.\"  \"What does he mean by his Venetian glass?\" muttered the porter, walking up and down with an uneasy air before the frames ranged against the wall. \"I don't see any glass. Some joke, no doubt. I only see a screen. We shall see, at any rate, what he will bring next trip.\"  \"Is your tenant not going to make room for me soon?\" inquired the young man, \"it is half-past twelve, and I want to move in.\"  \"He won't be much longer,\" answered the porter, \"but there is no harm done yet, since your furniture has not come,\" added he, with a stress on the concluding words.  As the young man was about to reply, a dragoon entered the court.  \"Is this Monsieur Bernard's?\" he asked, drawing a letter from a huge leather portfolio which swung at his side.  \"He lives here,\" replied the porter.  \"Here is a letter for him,\" said the dragoon; \"give me a receipt,\" and he handed to the porter a bulletin of despatches which the latter entered his lodge to sign.  \"Excuse me for leaving you alone,\" said he to the young man who was stalking impatiently about the court, \"but this is a letter from the Minister to my landlord, and I am going to take it up to him.\"  Monsieur Bernard was just beginning to shave when the porter knocked at his door.  \"What do you want, Durand?\"  \"Sir,\" replied the other, lifting his cap, \"a soldier has just brought this for you. It comes from the Ministry.\" And he handed to Monsieur Bernard the letter, the envelope of which bore the stamp of the War Department.  \"Heavens!\" exclaimed Monsieur Bernard, in such agitation that he all but cut himself. \"From the Minister of War! I am sure it is my nomination as Knight of the Legion of Honour, which I have long solicited. At last they have done justice to my good conduct. Here, Durand,\" said he, fumbling in his waistcoat-pocket, \"here are five francs to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],["title","Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#4)"],["body","to my health. Stay! I haven't my purse about me. Wait, and I will give you the money in a moment.\"  The porter was so overcome by this stunning fit of generosity, which was not at all in accordance with his landlord's ordinary habits, that he absolutely put on his cap again.  But Monsieur Bernard, who at any other time would have severely reprimanded this infraction of the laws of social hierarchy, appeared not to notice it. He put on his spectacles, broke the seal of the envelope with the respectful anxiety of a vizier receiving a sultan's firman, and began to read the dispatch. At the first line a frightful grimace ploughed his fat, monk-like cheeks with crimson furrows, and his little eyes flashed sparks that seemed ready to set fire to his bushy wig. In fact, all his features were so turned upside-down that you would have said his countenance had just suffered a shock of face-quake.  For these were the contents of the letter bearing the ministerial stamp, brought by a dragoon--orderly, and for which Durand had given the government a receipt:       \"Friend landlord: Politeness-who, according to ancient mythology,      is the grandmother of good manners--compels me to inform you that I      am under the cruel necessity of not conforming to the prevalent      custom of paying rent--prevalent especially when the rent is due. Up      to this morning I had cherished the hope of being able to celebrate      this fair day by the payments of my three quarters. Vain chimera,      bitter illusion! While I was slumbering on the pillow of      confidence, ill-luck--what the Greeks call _ananke_--was scattering      my hopes. The returns on which I counted--times are so bad!-have      failed, and of the considerable sums which I was to receive I have      only realised three francs, which were lent me, and I will not      insult you by the offer of them. Better days will come for our dear      country and for me. Doubt it not, sir! When they come, I shall fly      to inform you of their arrival, and to withdraw from your lodgings      the precious objects which I leave there, putting them under your      protection and that of the law, which hinders you from selling them      before the expiration of a year, in case you should be disposed to      try to do so with the object of obtaining the sum for which you      stand credited in the ledger of my honesty. I commend to your      special care my piano, and also the large frame containing sixty      locks of hair whose different colours run through the whole gamut      of capillary shades; the scissors of love have stolen them from the      forehead of the Graces.\"       \"Therefore, dear sir, and landlord, you may dispose of the roof      under which I have dwelt. I grant you full authority, and have      hereto set my hand and seal.\"       \"ALEXANDER SCHAUNARD\"  On finishing this letter, (which the artist had written at the desk of a friend who was a clerk in the War Office,) Monsieur Bernard indignantly crushed it in his hand, and as his glance fell on old Durand, who was waiting for the promised gratification, he roughly demanded what he was doing.  \"Waiting, sir.\"  \"For what?\"  \"For the present, on account of the good news,\" stammered the porter.  \"Get out, you scoundrel! Do you presume to speak to me with your cap on?\"  \"But, sir--\"  \"Don't you answer me! Get out! No, stay there! We shall go up to the room of that scamp of an artist who has run off without paying.\"  \"What! Monsieur Schaunard?\" ejaculated the porter.  \"Yes,\" cried the landlord with increasing fury, \"and if he has carried away the smallest article, I send you off, straight off!\"  \"But it can't be,\" murmured the poor porter, \"Monsieur Schaunard has not run away. He has gone to get change to pay you, and order a cart for his furniture.\"  \"A cart for his furniture!\" exclaimed the other, \"run! I'm sure he has it here. He laid a trap to get you away from your lodge, fool that you are!\"  \"Fool that I am! Heaven help me!\" cried the porter, all in a tremble before the thundering wrath of his superior, who hurried him down the stairs. When they arrived in the court the porter was hailed by the young man in the white hat.  \"Come now! Am I not soon going to be in possession of my lodging? Is this the eighth of April? Did I hire a room here and pay you a deposit to bind the bargain? Yes or no?\"  \"Excuse me, sir,\" interposed the landlord, \"I am at your service. Durand, I will talk to the gentleman myself. Run up there, that scamp Schaunard has come back to pack up. If you find him, shut him in, and then come down again and run for the police.\"  Old Durand vanished up the staircase.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" continued the landlord, with a bow to the young man now left alone with him, \"to whom have I the honour of speaking?\"  \"Your new tenant. I have hired a room in the sixth story of this house, and am beginning to be tired of waiting for my lodging to become vacant.\"  \"I am very sorry indeed,\" replied Monsieur Bernard, \"there has been a little difficulty with one of my tenants, the one whom you are to replace.\"  \"Sir,\" cried old Durand from a window at the very top of the house, \"Monsieur Schaunard is not here, but his room--stupid!--I mean he has carried nothing away, not a hair, sir!\"  \"Very well, come down,\" replied the landlord. \"Have a little patience, I beg of you,\" he continued to the young man. \"My porter will bring down to the cellar the furniture in the room of my defaulting tenant, and you may take possession in half an hour. Beside, your furniture has not come yet.\"  \"But it has,\" answered the young man quietly.  Monsieur Bernard looked around, and saw only the large screens which had already mystified his porter.  \"How is this?\" he muttered. \"I don't see anything.\"  \"Behold!\" replied the youth, unfolding the leaves of the frame, and displaying to the view of the astonished landlord a magnificent interior of a palace, with jasper columns, bas-reliefs, and paintings of old masters.  \"But your furniture?\" demanded Monsieur Bernard.  \"Here it is,\" replied the young man, pointing to the splendid furniture _painted_ in the palace, which he had bought at a sale of second-hand theatrical decorations.  \"I hope you have some more serious furniture than this,\" said the landlord. \"You know I must have security for my rent.\"  \"The deuce! Is a palace not sufficient security for the rent of a garret?\"  \"No sir, I want real chairs and tables in solid mahogany.\"  \"Alas! Neither gold nor mahogany makes us happy, as for the ancient poet well says. And I can't bear mahogany; it's too common a wood. Everybody has it.\"  \"But surely sir, you must have some sort of furniture.\"  \"No, it takes up too much room. You are stuck full of chairs, and have no place to sit down.\"  \"But at any rate, you have a bed. What do you sleep on?\"  \"On a good conscience, sir.\"  \"Excuse me, one more question,\" said the landlord, \"What is your profession?\"  At this very moment the young man's porter, returning on his second trip, entered the court. Among the articles with which his truck was loaded, an easel occupied a conspicuous position.  \"Sir! Sir!!\" shrieked old Durance, pointing out the easel to his landlord, \"it's a painter!\"  \"I was sure he was an artist!\" exclaimed the landlord in his turn, the hair of his wig standing up in affright, \"a painter!! And you never inquired after this person,\" he continued to his porter, \"you didn't know what he did!\"  \"He gave me five francs _arrest_,\" answered the poor fellow, \"how could I suspect--\"  \"When you have finished,\" put in the stranger--  \"Sir,\" replied Monsieur Bernard, mounting his spectacles with great decision, \"since you have no furniture, you can't come in. The law authorizes me to refuse a tenant who brings no security.\"  \"And my word, then?\"  \"Your word is not furniture, you must go somewhere else. Durance will give you back your earnest money.\"  \"Oh dear!\" exclaimed the porter, in consternation, \"I've put it in the Savings' Bank.\"  \"But consider sir,\" objected the young man. \"I can't find another lodging in a moment! At least grant me hospitality for a day.\"  \"Go to a hotel!\" replied Monsieur Bernard. \"By the way,\" added he, struck with a sudden idea, \"if you like, I can let you a furnished room, the one you were to occupy, which has the furniture of my defaulting tenant in it. Only you know that when rooms are let this way, you pay in advance.\"  \"Well,\" said the artist, finding he could do no better, \"I should like to know what you are going to ask me for your hole.\"  \"It is a very comfortable lodging, and the rent will be twenty-five francs a month, considering the circumstances, paid in advance.\"  \"You have said that already, the expression does not deserve being repeated,\" said the young man, feeling in his pocket. \"Have you change for five hundred francs?\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" quoth the astonished landlord.  \"Five hundred, half a thousand; did you never see one before?\" continued the artist, shaking the bank-note in the faces of the landlord and porter, who fairly lost their balance at the sight.  \"You shall have it in a moment, sir,\" said the now respectful owner of the house, \"there will only be twenty francs to take out, for Durand will return your deposit.\"  \"He may keep it,\" replied the artist, \"on condition of coming every morning to tell me the day of the week and month, the quarter of the moon, the weather it is going to be, and the form of government we are under.\"  Old Durand described an angle of ninety degrees forward.  \"Yes, my good fellow, you shall serve me for almanac. Meanwhile, help my porter to bring the things in.\"  \"I shall send you your receipt immediately,\" said the landlord, and that very night the painter Marcel was installed in the lodging of the fugitive Schaunard. During this time the aforesaid Schaunard was beating his roll-call, as he styled it, through the city.  Schaunard had carried the art of borrowing to the perfection of a science. Foreseeing the"]]]
