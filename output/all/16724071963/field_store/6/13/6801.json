This wasn't any accident, it was a deliberate attempt on his life. I'll have a couple of store cops sent in here; see that they stay with you.\"  He gave her no chance to argue. Pushing Latterman ahead of him, he drove through the mob of clerks outside the door.  \"... Course she can; didn't you see her open the safe?\" he heard. \"... Nobody but a Literate--\" \"Then she's a Literate, herself!\"  A couple of centuries ago, they would have talked like that if it had been discovered that the girl were pregnant; a couple of centuries before that, they would have been equally horrified if she had been discovered to have been a Protestant, or a Catholic, or whatever the locally unpopular religion happened to be. By noon, this would be all over Penn-Jersey-York; coming on top of Slade Gardner's accusations--         *       *       *       *       *  He ran up the spiral escalator, stumbling and regaining his footing as he left it. Bayne and his striking Literates were all gone; he saw a sergeant of Pelton's store police and went toward him, taking his spare identity-badge from his pocket.  \"Here,\" he said, handing it to the sergeant. \"Get another officer, and go down to Pelton's office. Show it to Miss Pelton, and tell her I sent you. There's been an attempt on Chester Pelton's life; you're to stay with him. Use your own judgment, but don't let anybody, and that definitely includes Russell Latterman, get at him. If you see anything suspicious, shoot first and ask questions afterwards. What's your name, sergeant?\"  \"Coccozello, sir. Guido Coccozello.\"  \"All right. There'll be a medic or a pharmacist--a Literate, anyhow--with medicine for Mr. Pelton. He'll ask for you, by name, and mention me. And there'll be another Literate, maybe; he'll know your name, and use mine. Hurry, now, sergeant.\"  He jumped into his 'copter, pulled forward the plexiglass canopy, and took off vertically to ten thousand feet, then, orienting himself, swooped downward toward a landing stage on the other side of the East River, cutting across traffic levels with an utter contempt for regulations.  The building on which he landed was one of the principal pharmacies; he spiraled down on the escalator to the main floor and went directly to the Literate in charge, noticing that he wore on his Sam Browne not only the badges of retail-merchandising, pharmacist and graduate chemist but also that of medic-in-training. Snatching a pad and pencil from a counter, he wrote hastily: _Your private office, at once; urgent and important._  Looking at it, the Literate nodded in recognition of Cardon's Literacy.  \"Over this way, sir,\" he said, guiding Cardon to his small cubicle office.  \"Here.\" Cardon gave him the prescription. \"Nitrocaine bulbs. They're for Chester Pelton; he's had a serious heart attack. He needs these with all speed. I don't suppose I need tell you how many kinds of hell will break loose if he dies now and the Fraternities are accused, as the Illiterates' Organization will be sure to, of having had him poisoned.\"  \"Who are you?\" the Literate asked, taking the prescription and glancing at it. \"That,\"--he gestured toward Cardon's silver-laced black Mexican jacket--\"isn't exactly a white smock.\"  Cardon had his pocket recorder in his hand. He held it out, pressing a concealed stud; the stylus-and-tablet insignia glowed redly on it for a moment, then vanished. The uniformed Literate nodded.  \"Fill this exactly; better do it yourself, to make sure, and take it over to Pelton's yourself. I see you have a medic-trainee's badge. Ask for Sergeant Coccozello, and tell him Frank Cardon sent you.\" The Literate, who had not recognized him before, opened his eyes at the name and whistled softly. \"And fix up a sedative to keep him quiet for not less than four nor more than six hours. Let me use your visiphone for a while, if you please.\"  The man in the Literate smock nodded and hurried out. Cardon dialed William R. Lancedale's private number. When Lancedale's thin, intense face appeared on the screen, he reported swiftly.  \"The way I estimate it,\" he finished, \"Latterman put Bayne up to making a pass at the girl, after having thrown out Pelton's nitrocaine bulbs. Probably told the silly jerk that Claire was pining away with secret passion for him, or something. Maybe he wanted to kill Pelton; maybe he just wanted this to happen.\"  \"I assume there's no chance of stopping a leak?\"  Cardon laughed with mirthless harshness. \"That, I take it, was rhetorical.\"  \"Yes, of course.\" Lancedale's face assumed the blank expression that went with a pause for semantic re-integration. \"Can you cover yourself for about an hour?\"  \"Certainly. 'Copter trouble. Visits to campaign headquarters. An appeal on Pelton's behalf for a new crew of Literates for the store--\"  \"Good enough. Come over. I think I can see a way to turn this to advantage. I'm going to call for an emergency session of the Grand Council this afternoon, and I'll want you sitting in on it; I want to talk to you about plans now.\" He considered for a moment. \"There's too much of a crowd at O'Reilly's, now; come the church way.\"  Breaking the connection, Cardon dialed again. A girl's face, over a Literate Third Class smock, appeared in the screen; a lovely golden voice chimed at him:  \"Mineola High School; good morning, sir.\"  \"Good morning. Frank Cardon here. Let me talk, at once, to your principal, Literate First Class Prestonby.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ralph Prestonby cleared his throat, slipped a master disk into the recording machine beside his desk, and pressed the start button.  \"Dear Parent or Guardian,\" he began. \"Your daughter, now a third-year student at this school, has reached the age of eligibility for the Domestic Science course entitled, 'How To Win and Hold a Husband.' Statistics show that girls who have completed this valuable course are sooner, longer, and happier married than those who have not enjoyed its advantages. We recommend it most highly.  \"However, because of the delicate nature of some of the visual material used, your consent is required. You can attach such consent to this disk by running it for at least ten seconds after the sign-off and then switching from 'Play' to 'Transcribe.' Kindly include your full name, as well as your daughter's, and place your thumbprint on the opposite side of the disk. Very sincerely yours, Literate First Class Ralph C. Prestonby, Principal.\"  He put the master disk in an envelope, checked over a list of names and addresses of parents and girl students, and put that in also. He looked over the winter sports schedule, and signed and thumbprinted it. Then he loaded the recorder with his morning's mail, switched to \"Play,\" and started it. As he listened, he blew smoke rings across the room and toyed with a dagger, made from a file, which had been thrown down the central light-well at him a few days before. The invention of the pocket recorder, which put a half-hour's conversation on a half-inch disk, had done more to slow down business and promote inane correspondence than anything since the earlier inventions of shorthand, typewriters and pretty stenographers. Finally, he cleared the machine, dumping the whole mess into a basket and carrying it out to his secretary.  \"Miss Collins, take this infernal rubbish and have a couple of the girls divide it between them, play it off, and make a digest of it,\" he said. \"And here. The sports schedule, and this parental-consent thing on the husband-trapping course. Have them taken care of.\"  \"This stuff,\" Martha Collins said, poking at the pile of letter disks. \"I suppose about half of it is threats, abuse and obscenities, and the other half is from long-winded bores with idiotic suggestions and ill-natured gripes. I'll use that old tag line, again--'hoping you appreciate our brevity as much as we enjoyed yours--'\"  \"Yes. That'll be all right.\" He looked at his watch. \"I'm going to make a personal building-tour, instead of using the TV. The animals are sort of restless, today. The election; the infantile compulsion to take sides. If you need me for anything urgent, don't use oral call. Just flash my signal, red-blue-red-blue, on the hall and classroom screens. Oh, Doug!\"  Yetsko, his length of rubber hose under his arm, ambled out of Prestonby's private office, stopping to stub out his cigarette. The action reminded Prestonby that he still had his pipe in his mouth; he knocked it out and pocketed it. Together, they went into the hall outside.  \"Where to, first, captain?\" Yetsko wanted to know.  \"Cloak-and-Dagger Department, on the top floor. Then we'll drop down to the shops, and then up through Domestic Science and Business and General Arts.\"  \"And back here. We hope,\" Yetsko finished.         *       *       *       *       *  They took a service elevator to the top floor, emerging into a stockroom piled with boxes and crates and cases of sound records and cans of film and stacks of picture cards, and all the other impedimenta of Illiterate education. Passing through it to the other end, Prestonby unlocked a door, and they went down a short hall, to where ten or fifteen boys and girls had just gotten off a helical escalator and were queued up at a door at the other end. There were two Literate guards in black leather, and a student-monitor, with his white belt and rubber truncheon, outside the door.  Prestonby swore under his breath. He'd hoped they'd miss this, but since they hadn't, there was nothing for it but to fall in at the tail of the queue. One by one, the boys and girls went up, spoke briefly to the guards and the student-monitor, and were passed through the door, Each time, one of the guards had to open it with a key. Finally, it was Prestonby's turn.  \"B, D, F, H, J, L, N, P, R, T, V, X, Y,\" he recited to the guardians of the door.  \"A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, Q, S, U, W, Y,\" the monitor replied solemnly. \"The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18346"],["title","Null-ABC (#7)"],["body","is dry, and the book is dusty.\"  \"But tomorrow, there will be writing and reading for all,\" Prestonby answered.  The guard with the key unlocked the door, and he and Yetsko went through, into an utterly silent sound-proofed room, and from it into an inner, noisy, room, where a recorded voice was chanting:  \"Hat--_huh-ah-tuh._ H-a-t. Box--_buh-oh-ksss_. B-o-x. Gun--_guh-uh-nnn_. G-u-n. Girl--_guh-ih-rrr-lll_,\" while pictures were flashed on a screen at the front, and words appeared under them.  There were about twenty boys and girls, of the freshman-year age-bracket at desk-seats, facing the screen. They'd started learning the alphabet when school had opened in September; now they had gotten as far as combining letters into simple words. In another month, they'd be as far as diphthongs and would be initiated into the mysteries of silent letters. Maybe sooner than that; he was finding that children who had not been taught to read until their twelfth year learned much more rapidly than the primary grade children in the Literate schools.  What he was doing here wasn't exactly illegal. It wasn't even against the strict letter of Fraternity regulations. But it had to be done clandestinely. What he'd have liked to have done would have been to have given every boy and girl in English I the same instruction this selected group was getting, but that would have been out of the question. The public would never have stood for it; the police would have had to intervene to prevent a riotous mob of Illiterates from tearing the school down brick by brick, and even if that didn't happen, the ensuing uproar inside the Fraternity would have blown the roof off Literates' Hall. Even Lancedale couldn't have survived such an explosion, and the body of Literate First Class Ralph N. Prestonby would have been found in a vacant lot the next morning. Even many of Lancedale's supporters would have turned on him in anger at this sudden blow to the Fraternities' monopoly of the printed Word.  So it had to be kept secret, and since adolescents in possession of a secret are under constant temptation to hint mysteriously in the presence of outsiders, this hocus-pocus of ritual and password and countersign had to be resorted to. He'd been in conspiratorial work of other kinds, and knew that there was a sound psychological basis for most of what seemed, at first glance, to be mere melodramatic claptrap.  He and Yetsko passed on through a door across the room, into another sound-proofed room. The work of soundproofing and partitioning the old stockroom had been done in the last semester of his first year at Mineola High, by members of the graduating class of building-trades students, who had then gone their several ways convinced that they had been working on a set of music-class practice rooms. The Board of Education had never even found out about it. In this second room, a Literate teacher, one of the Lancedale faction, had a reading class of twenty-five or thirty. A girl was on her feet, with a book in her hand, reading from it:      \"We are not sure of sorrow;       And joy was never sure;     Today will die tomorrow;       Time stoops to no man's lure;     And love, grown faint and fretful     With lips but half regretful     Sighs, and with eyes forgetful       Weeps that no loves endure.\"  Then she handed the book--it was the only copy--to the boy sitting in front of her, and he rose to read the next verse. Prestonby, catching the teacher's eye, nodded and smiled. This was a third-year class, of course, but from h-a-t spells hat to Swinburne in three years was good work.  There were three other classes, a total of little over a hundred students. There was no trouble; they were there for one purpose only--to learn. He spoke with one of the teachers, whose class was busy with a written exercise; he talked for a while to another whose only duty at the moment was to answer questions and furnish help to a small class who were reading silently from a variety of smuggled-in volumes.  \"Only a hundred and twenty, out of five thousand,\" Yetsko said to him, as they were dropping down in the elevator by which they had come. \"Think you'll ever really get anything done with them?\"  \"I won't. Maybe they won't,\" he replied. \"But the ones they'll teach will. They're just a cadre; it'll take fifty years before the effects are really felt. But some day--\"  The shops--a good half of the school was trades-training--were noisy and busy. Here Prestonby kept his hand on his gas-projector, and Yetsko had his rubber hose ready, either to strike or to discard in favor of his pistol. The instructors were similarly on the alert and ready for trouble--he had seen penitentiaries where the guards took it easier. Carpentry and building trades. Machine shop. Welding. 'Copter and TV repair shops--he made a minor and relatively honest graft there, from the sale of rebuilt equipment. Even an atomic-equipment shop, though there was nothing in the place that would excite a Geiger more than the instructor's luminous-dial watch.  Domestic Science--Home Decorating, Home Handicrafts, Use of Home Appliances, Beautician School, Charm School. He and Yetsko sampled the products of the Cooking School, intended for the cafeteria, and found them edible if uninspired.  Business--classes in recording letters, using Illiterate business-machines, preparing Illiterate cards for same, filing recordings--always with the counsel, \"When in doubt, consult a Literate.\"  General Arts--Spanish and French, from elaborate record players, the progeny of the old Twentieth Century Linguaphone. English, with recorded-speech composition, enunciation training, semantics, and what Prestonby called English Illiterature. The class he visited was drowsing through one of the less colorful sections of \"Gone With The Wind.\" World History, with half the students frankly asleep through an audio-visual on the Feudal System, with planted hints on how nice a revival of same would be, and identifying the clergy of the Middle Ages with the Fraternities of Literates. American History, with the class wide awake, since Custer's Massacre was obviously only moments away.  \"Wantta bet one of those little cherubs doesn't try to scalp another before the day's out?\" Yetsko whispered.  Prestonby shook his head. \"No bet. Remember that film on the Spanish Inquisition, that we had to discontinue?\"  It was then that the light on the classroom screen, which had been flickering green and white, suddenly began flashing Prestonby's wanted-at-office signal.         *       *       *       *       *  Prestonby found Frank Cardon looking out of the screen in his private office. The round, ordinarily cheerful, face was serious, but the innocent blue eyes were as unreadable as ever. He was wearing one of the new Mexican _charro_-style jackets, black laced with silver.  \"I can't see all your office, Ralph,\" he said as Prestonby approached. \"Are you alone?\"  \"Doug Yetsko's all,\" Prestonby said, and, as Cardon hesitated, added: \"Don't be silly, Frank; he's my bodyguard. What could I be in that he wouldn't know all about?\"  Cardon nodded. \"Well, we're in a jam up to here.\" A handwave conveyed the impression that the sea of troubles had risen to his chin. He spoke at some length, describing the fight between Chester Pelton and Stephen S. Bayne, the Literate strike at Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise, Pelton's heart attack, and the circumstances of Claire's opening the safe. \"So you see,\" he finished. \"Maybe Latterman tried to kill Pelton, maybe he just tried to do what he did. I can't take chances either way.\"  Prestonby thought furiously. \"You say Claire's alone at the store with her father?\"  \"And a couple of store cops, sterling characters with the hearts of lions and the brains of goldfish,\" Cardon replied. \"And Russ Latterman, and maybe four or five Conservative goons he's managed to infiltrate into the store.\"  Prestonby was still thinking, aloud, now. \"Maybe they did mean to kill Pelton; in that case, they'll try again. Or maybe they only wanted to expose Claire's literacy. It's hard to say what else they'd try--maybe kidnap her, to truth-drug her and use her as a guest-artist on a Conservative telecast. I'm going over to the store, now.\"  \"That's a good idea, Ralph. If you hadn't thought of it, I was going to suggest it. Land on the central stage, ask for Sergeant Coccozello of the store police, and give my name. Even aside from everything else, it'd be a good idea to have somebody there who can read and dares admit it, till a new crew of Literates can get there. You were speaking about the possibility of kidnaping; how about the boy? Ray?\"  Prestonby nodded. \"I'll have him come here to my office, and stay there till I get back; I'll have Yetsko stay with him.\" He turned to where the big man in black leather stood guard at the door. \"Doug, go get Ray Pelton and bring him here. Check with Miss Collins for where he'd be, now.\" He turned back to the screen. \"Anything else, Frank?\"  \"Isn't that enough?\" the brewer-Literate demanded. \"I'll call you at the store, after a while. 'Bye.\"  The screen darkened as Cardon broke the connection. Prestonby got to his feet, went to his desk, and picked up a pipe, digging out the ashes from the bowl with an ice pick that one of the teachers had taken from a sixteen-year-old would-be murderer. He checked his tablet gun, made sure that there was an extra loaded clip in the holster, and got two more spare clips from the arms locker. Then, to make sure, he called Pelton's store, talking for a while to the police sergeant Cardon had mentioned. By the time he was finished, the door opened and Yetsko ushered Ray Pelton in.  \"What's happened?\" the boy asked. \"Doug told me that the Senator ... my father ... had another heart attack.\"  \"Yes, Ray. I don't believe he's in any great danger. He's at the store, resting in his office.\" He went on to tell the boy what had happened, exactly and in full detail. He was only"]]]
