By financial aid we do not only mean donations and contributions, here and there, from wealthy Catholics.  What we have in view is the financial assistance of the Church in the East, as a whole, as a corporate body.  Every Catholic in Canada must become more or less interested in \"Home Missions\" and be willing to do \"his little bit.\" As the small fibrous roots are the feeders and strength of the tree, so also the small and continued donations of all Catholics in the East will be the support of our missions in the West.  In the various Protestant denominations, for every dollar given to support of the local church another dollar goes to the \"Home Mission Fund.\"  At the last general Methodist Conference (Hamilton, 1918) that Church pledged _eight million dollars_ ($8,000,000.00) for their missions in the next five years.  With the enormous sums these various religious bodies receive from the East they support the non-Catholic institutions of higher education to be found in all cities of Western Canada, they distribute free of charge tons of literature throughout the prairie, they defray the expenses of their social workers, field secretaries, etc.  Among the Catholics of hundreds of parishes does not the prevailing policy seem to be: \"Charity begins at home\"--and we may add, often ends there.  When one has paid his pew-rent and his dues, bought a few tickets for a sacred concert or bazaar, thrown on the collection plate each Sunday a few coppers or a small piece of silver, he thinks he has accomplished all his duty to the Church.  The vision of too many Catholics does not go beyond the boundaries of their parish or their diocese.  Circumscribed in their views, they remain illiberal in their sympathies.  Floyd Keeler, a neo-convert to the Catholic Faith, made recently this most instructive statement.  \"Perhaps the greatest problem which the convert is the most surprised to find existing in the Catholic Church, is the problem why the average American Catholic is so supremely selfsatisfied and seems to have so little thought for the propagation of the Faith which he professes.  Coming from a body which has had for many years a well-organized system of missionary propaganda and which, in spite of its many and grave doctrinal difficulties, is fairly well permeated with missionary spirit, _it is a shock_ to find that within the Fold so little attention is paid to what really ought to be the very breath of life to its people, the Extension of the Kingdom of God on earth, the carrying out of our \"Lord's Last Will and Testament.\"  To find Catholics whose ideals are bound up within their own parishes, who possess no sort of vision of the world beyond, still lying \"in darkness and in the shadow of death\" and no concern over its redemption, is a phenomenon which is hard to explain.\"  \"It distresses us more than we can tell to find those who are nourished at the breasts of the Bride of Christ, callous to Her charms, unmindful of Her privileges, thoughtlessly and grudgingly rendering their minimum of service, for we realize how Christ is thus being 'wounded in the house of His friends' and His Bride made to lose Her comeliness in the sight of men.  But the Catholic press and the Catholic pulpit, fired with the zeal of this new apostolate can, and we believe will solve the problem.\"--(\"America,\" March 13, 1920.)  Our parishes and dioceses will never suffer from an increased zeal in the broader interests of the Universal Church.[4]  There can be no conflict of interests in the Church of God, if seen from the proper point of view,--the glory of God and the salvation of souls.  \"It is because we have need of men and means at home that I am convinced we ought to send both men and means abroad.  In exact proportion as we freely give what we have freely received will our works at home prosper and the zeal and number of our priests be multiplied.  This is the test and the measure of Catholic life among us.  The missionary spirit is the condition of the growth, and, if Faith is to extend at home it must be by our aiding to carry it abroad\" (Card. Manning).  Was it not while he was building the Cathedral of Westminster, that Card. Vaughn founded the \"Mission Society?\"  This missionary spirit has also a bearing on the spiritual welfare of the flock in which it is fostered.  For those who would object that giving money to our Western Church is \"carrying coals to Newcastle,\" we would state that the West now needs more the help of the East than at any other time.  The organized parishes are indeed beginning to be self-supporting; but the work we have outlined in these pages, if it is to be done, has to be supported by the Catholics of Canada at large.  The spiritual aids will be the prayers, Masses, sacrifices of all kind offered for our Home Missions.  Nothing strengthens faith and stimulates genuine piety, as prayers and sacrifices for the great cause of our missions.  They are so disinterested, they reveal true love for our Blessed Lord.  Only a chosen few are called to go into the field at home and afar and reap the ripening harvest.  But all are commanded by the Master to pray the Father for harvesters.  This sublime apostleship of prayer is the privilege and duty of every Christian.  Is there anything more instructive and more pathetic than the invitation of the Saviour to co-operate with Him in this great work of the Redemption.  \"And seeing the multitudes he had compassion on them: because they were distressed and lying like sheep that have no shepherd.  Then He said to His disciples: the harvest indeed is great but the labourers are few.  Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he send labourers into the harvest.\" (Math. IX, 36, 37, 38.)  The Divine Master cannot but hear the prayer asking Him to send \"labourers to the ripening harvest.\"  And could we give better proof of devotion to Church and Country?  Great is the seriousness of the present hour, tremendous the task that confronts us after the war.  Never has any generation in history been so freighted with the responsibilities of the future as ours is, marching home from the battlefields of Europe.  We are living in stirring and changeful times.  Nowhere in the Dominion of Canada will the period of reconstruction have more far-reaching effects than in the West.  The after-war problems will meet there with rapid and very often radical solutions.  To understand this issue that faces our country, to grasp it in all its breadth and fulness, should we not broaden our vision, readjust it, we would say, to the new scale of changing conditions?  Only then will we be able to marshal our forces and throw the weight of Catholic principles into the solving of the social, economic and religious problems of the hour.  \"The Church cannot remain an isolated factor in the nation.  The Catholic Church possesses spiritual and moral resources which are at the command of the nation in every great crisis.  The message to the nation to forget local boundaries and provincialism is a message likewise to the Catholic Church.  Parochial, diocesan and provincial limits must be forgotten in the face of the greater tasks which burden our collective religious resources.\" (Card. Gibbons.)  Let us give to the people that broad, Catholic vision of our present duty to our country and to our Church. The broader the outlook, the deeper the insight.  The measure of their vision will be the measure of their action.  No leader can meet with success without a certain receptivity to work upon.  This receptivity is formed by spreading ideas, by an educational propaganda.  It may take time before the vision struggles into consciousness and wins its way to the dominance of the mind.  What we need is a systematized, continuous effort that will gradually crystalize that vision into a definite workable project.  A flourish of trumpets and blaze of Catholic zeal, as we are accustomed to witness on the occasion of some special sermon and appeal by a missionary, will only prompt an act of passing generosity.  The special object of the _Catholic Church Extension Society_ is to awaken the collective consciousness of the Catholic population and to give to Catholics that vision of their social responsibility and religious solidarity and to keep it, by its organization, in a healthy condition.  It realizes that co-operation from the Church at large will exist and maintain itself only if preceded, accompanied and upheld by a strong and vigilant Catholic public opinion.  In return public opinion, once created in the ranks of our Catholic laity, will make the _Extension Society_ a live-wire, a dynamic force of the Church in Canada.  Let us not forget, vision--and public opinion is the vision of the multitude--is the first and primary of constructive forces.  To have Catholic action we must first create a Catholic mind.  A publicity campaign, followed by a dominion-wide drive for funds, would be now in order.  The spirit of giving and of giving for great causes is in the air.  A campaign of that nature--we have seen it often during the war,--is in itself an education.  It spreads information and arouses the sense of duty.  From the clearness, breadth and depth of that vision will spring the conquering spirit of united action.  Forgetting then our lingual and racial differences that have created in the past among us so many unfortunate misunderstandings and have weakened our forces before the enemy, we will rise to the level of our faith, to the creative powers of true Catholicity.  The \"Call of the West\" has been heard.  It comes to you with the _burning problems_ of the _present_ . . . _praesentia tangens_ . . . and the _vision of brilliant promises and heavy responsibilities_ of the future . . . _furtra prospiciens_.  WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?    [1] This Chapter formed the matter of a series of articles published in the \"Catholic Register\" of Toronto.  The Catholic Church"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18378"],["title","Catholic Problems in Western Canada (#6)"],["body","Society republished them in pamphlet form with the following introduction by Archbishop McNeil.  \"The author of this pamphlet has lived in the West and has felt--I was going to say--the need of Catholic co-operation, but that falls short of the reality.  Co-operation among Catholics is more than a means to a missionary end.  It is an essential part of Catholic life.  Boundaries of jurisdiction are conveniences and means to an end.  In the first centuries of the Christian era it was centres rather than circumferences that marked divisions of work and of jurisdiction; but, in any case, administrative divisions were never intended to be divisions of brotherhood.  In places where we are well established we are inclined to look upon Christian brotherhood in an abstract way.  In the West they feel it as a necessity of Catholic life, not only as a source of financial help, but as brotherhood in sympathy, interest, and mutual helpfulness.  The West can help the East by its growing influence, and Catholics in the West can do their part in defence of Catholic ideals and Catholic institutions.  The more we do for them the more they can do for us.  Father Daly describes the Call of the West, and it is fittingly through Catholic Extension that the call is now made and will be answered.\"  [2] \"The Universe\" the great Catholic Weekly of England, had in its editorial notes the following remarks on this suggestion of ours:  A \"DESK-POLICY\" OF APOSTLESHIP  The Catholic Church in Canada possesses a Home Missionary problem of the extent of which we can scarcely form an idea.  In making his appeal from the West to the East of the vast Dominion, Father Daly, C.S.S.R., who has just issued a pamphlet on the subject through the Church Extension Press, Toronto, brings out some salient truths on the subject of co-operation and organization which Catholics all the world over can well take to heart and apply to themselves.  \"Two conditions (he says) made united action possible--uniform plan and authoritative leadership. To readjust our methods to conditions as we find them means efficiency with the least waste of energy, and acting on this principle Father Daly advocates a 'survey' of membership and conditions of the Catholic Church in unorganized districts as the one means of getting at lapsed Catholics.  'Too often,' he observes, 'we are waiting for the fallen away to come to us.'  This is true indeed.  Protestant proselytizers in the west of Canada have the whole 'survey' scheme worked out on a scientific basis.  Father Daly is more willing to learn from them.  \"I am a firm believer,\" he writes, \"in what I would call the Catholicization of modern methods that have proved beneficial in any cause.\"  The problem of unorganized districts and of a scattered Catholic population in our own case is, of course, minute compared with that of Canada; but it is there, and sufficiently in evidence to justify the Redemptorist Father's \"desk-policy of apostleship.\"  There is no reason, in short, why the interorganization of the members of the most perfect organization in the world should be committed to a kind of spiritual rule of thumb.\"  [3] The following letter prompted by the reading of this very article was received by the President of the Church Extension, dated, March 14, 1919, at a point of Saskatchewan we know quite well; it is illustrative of conditions prevailing in many districts of our Great West:  Very Reverend and dear Father,--  I have just read your article in the Febr., 15 issue and I am so pleased with your suggestion for relieving the situation for scattered Catholics throughout the West that I must write my appreciation.  I am sure that very few people in the East realize what a veritable necessity those _Free Lances_ you spoke of are to so many Western people, or what a God-send those _auto-chapels_ would be.  Western homesteaders do not stray far from home for two very good reasons, lack of transportation facilities and lack of funds.  We live 12 miles from the church, that is my own family.  The others live thirty-five and fifty miles away and up to this year we have had nothing but a waggon to travel in, and now those that live farthest away have still only a waggon.  So you will understand that we have not made more than necessary trips or not many more.  And I wonder if my brothers would make those, were it not for my mothers insistence.  They are surrounded by such bad influences.  It's not that it is a sectarian influence, but rather a total lack of religion altogether.  The only things that matter greatly are the material things of this world.  To confess yourself religious, especially Catholic, is to confess yourself old fashioned and to cause people to smile.  You know that is harder to combat than bigoted opposition.  Your plan to send out pamphlets would be appreciated by many--But above all we need the personal touch of a priest.  We need it as our crops need rain, etc. . . .  [4] As an illustration of what in a simple and unostentatious way can be done by any parish in the mission cause the editor of the Annals of the Propagation of the Faith (N.Y.) refers to an invitation extended to him to attend a Christmas sale.  It took place in a parish of the Brooklyn diocese on Dec. 3, 1919, the feast of St. Francis Xavier, patron of the mission cause.  Thanks mainly to the efforts of an energetic lady, but with the consent and patronage of the pastor, a Xavirian Mission Circle had been formed.  Within eighteen months after its organization the newly found circle had paid off a $500.00 mortgage for a heavily burdened priest in the South, had adopted eight abandoned children of the Chinese Missions, had sent 1,000 Mass intentions, was supporting seven catechists in Africa, India, and China, was educating a Chinese seminarian, had given 150 volumes to the parochial library of a bigoted section in the South, and was able then to place upon exhibition a number of sacred vessels that were to be forwarded as gifts to poor priests.  \"And did all these activities not interfere with your parochial work?\" Mgr. Freri asked the pastor.  \"Not in the least\"--was the answer--\"My collections have never been larger.\"  \"EVEN PROTESTANTISM FINDS THAT HOME COLLECTIONS ARE IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE MISSION GIFTS.\"     CHAPTER II.  BRIDGING THE CHASM[1]  Most touching in its divine simplicity, most sublime in its inspired lessons was the invitation of the Master to His Apostles: \"Behold I say to you lift up your eyes and see the countries, for they are white, already to harvest,\" (John IV, 35)--As He stood by the well of Jacob, facing the slopes of the hills of Samaria, He pointed out to them the crowds that were hastening to listen to His Message and believe in His divine mission.  The fields around lay desolate and lifeless, for it was then winter.  \"Do you not say,\" asks Jesus, \"there are yet four months and then the harvest cometh?  Behold I say to you lift up your eyes and see the countries for they are white already to harvest.\" This human harvest, of which the Master speaks, is but the prelude of that immense harvest of souls ever ripening under the rays of God's divine grace in the great field of this world.  The Church, like Christ, also invites us to contemplate that waving harvest and to pray the Lord to send labourers into the field.  This divine invitation, the Catholic Church Extension Society makes its own, to plead the cause of our Home Missions.  Pointing to our Western Provinces, to that great Dominion beyond the Lakes, that missionary organization says to every Catholic in the land: \"The harvest is great, but the labourers are few.  Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he send labourers into the harvest.\"  The Catholic Church Extension Society has been founded in Canada, for the conservation and propagation of the Catholic Faith in our mission districts.  Its very name, as we readily see, shows forth its object and explains its existence.  Canada, as we all know, possesses vast areas, in her Western Provinces particularly, where the Church has not yet established the influence of her permanent organization.  There, her children suffer from the prolonged absence of her teaching, of her sacraments, of her authority, and are struggling against the abiding presence of numerous, rich, aggressive, and unscrupulous proselytizers. Yet, on the vast stretches of prairie, where the lonely homesteader has just broken the virgin soil, amid the snows of the bleak North, by the rushing waters of the Fraser, the Mackenzie, the Peace, and the Saskatchewan Rivers, in the far distant valleys of the Rockies--the words of the Master are still a living reality. . . .  \"The fields are ready for the harvest and the workers are few.\"  The Extension Society has been established in Canada to point out to our Catholic laity these fields where the harvest is waiting and to help to send labourers into them.  Its sublime mission is to _bridge the chasm_ which separates the East from the West.  It is the binding and living link between the organized Church and the mission field.  This sublime object of the Society makes it most worthy of our commendation and of your loyal and generous support.  Principle and policy are the basic ideas of organized action.  If the principles upon which an organization rests are true and elevating, if the policy it advocates and which governs its activities is practical, easy, and attractive, the organization itself is bound to meet in time with an unlimited success.  The higher the principles, the more inviting the policy, the more living and telling will be the resultant action.  Therefore, to place before our readers the principles and policy of the Catholic Extension Society will no doubt help them to understand better its claims and respond more generously to its appeal.   _I.--Principles_  The Kingdom of God comes upon earth through the Apostolate of the Church.  \"As the Father sent me, I also send you,"]]]
