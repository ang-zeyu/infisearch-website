Observations have shown that if manure becomes flyblown and the maggots attain a fairly good size before the manure is scattered on the fields, they can continue their development and will pupate in the ground.   CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF MANURE TO DESTROY FLY MAGGOTS.  During the summer months, when fly breeding is going on most actively, the farmer is also busy and often can not spare the time to remove manure regularly. The general practice, therefore, has been to keep the manure in heaps located, as a rule, very near the stables. How can fly breeding be prevented in such accumulations? As a result of recent investigations, it is now possible to point out two methods which are practical and effective.  The first is the treatment of the manure pile with chemical substances which will kill the eggs and maggots of the house fly. The Bureau of Entomology, in cooperation with the Bureau of Chemistry and the Bureau of Plant Industry, has conducted a series of experiments in which a large number of chemicals were applied to infested manure and observations made, not only on their efficiency in killing the maggots but also as to their effect on the chemical composition and bacterial flora of the manure. The object was to find some cheap chemical which would be effective in destroying the fly larvæ and at the same time would not reduce the fertilizing value of the manure.   TREATMENT WITH HELLEBORE.  Of the numerous substances tried, the one which seems best to fulfill these conditions is powdered hellebore.[10] For the treatment of manure a water extract of the hellebore is prepared by adding 1/2 pound of the powder to every 10 gallons of water, and after stirring it is allowed to stand 24 hours. The mixture thus prepared is sprinkled over the manure at the rate of 10 gallons to every 8 bushels (10 cubic feet) of manure. From the result of 12 experiments with manure piles treated under natural conditions it appears that such treatment results in the destruction of from 88 to 99 per cent of the fly larvæ.  Studies of treated manure indicated that its composition and rotting were not interfered with. Furthermore, several field tests showed that there was no apparent injury to growing crops when fertilized with treated manure.  Since the solution is somewhat poisonous it should not be left exposed where it might be drunk by livestock. It is quite safe to say that chickens will not be injured by pecking at hellebore-treated manure. This has been tested carefully. Hellebore can be obtained both in ground and powdered form, but the powder gives the best results in the destruction of fly larvæ.  [Footnote 10: _Veratrum viride_ or _V. aloum_.]   TREATMENT WITH POWDERED BORAX.  Another chemical found to be even more effective as a larvicide is powdered borax. This substance is available in commercial form in all parts of the country. It has the advantage of being comparatively nonpoisonous and noninflammable and is easily transported and handled. The minimum amount necessary to kill fly larvæ was found to be 0.62 pound per 8 bushels of manure, or about 1 pound per 16 cubic feet. Best results were obtained when the borax was applied in solution, or when water was sprinkled on after the borax had been scattered evenly over the pile. Borax is not only effective in killing the larvæ, but when it comes in contact with the eggs it prevents them from hatching. When applied at the rate of 1 pound to 16 cubic feet it was found to kill about 90 per cent of the larvæ, heavier applications killing from 98 to 99 per cent.  Borax has no injurious effect on the chemical composition or rotting of the manure. However, when added in large quantities with manure to the soil it will cause considerable injury to growing plants. A number of experiments have been conducted to determine the effect on crops of the use of manure treated with borax as herein recommended. When applied at the rate of 15 tons per acre it appears that no injury as a rule will follow. Some crops are more sensitive to borax than others, and also the tendency to injury appears to vary on different soils. It is necessary, therefore, to repeat the warning issued in connection with a previous bulletin[11] on this subject, that great care be exercised, in the application of borax, that the manure does not receive more than 1 pound for every 16 cubic feet, and that not more than 15 tons of manure so treated are applied to the acre.  In view of the possible injury from the borax treatment as a result of carelessness in applying it, or from other unforeseen conditions, it is recommended that horse manure and other farmyard manures which are to be used as fertilizer be treated with hellebore. Borax, on the other hand, is such a good larvicide that it call be used with advantage on the ground of soil-floor stables, in privies, on refuse piles, and on any accumulations of fermenting organic matter which are not to be used for fertilizing purposes.  [Footnote 11: Department Bulletin 118, U. S. Department of Agriculture, p. 25.]   TREATMENT WITH CALCIUM CYANAMID AND ACID PHOSPHATE.  Many experiments with mixtures of commercial fertilizers were tried to determine whether fly larvæ would be killed by any substance the addition of which would increase the fertilizing value of the manure. A mixture of calcium cyanamid and acid phosphate was found to possess considerable larvicidal action. Several experiments showed that 1/2 pound of calcium cyanamid plus 1/2 pound of acid phosphate to each bushel of manure give an apparent larvicidal action of 98 per cent. The mixture in the form of a powder was scattered evenly over the surface and then wet down with water. The use of this mixture adds to the manure two important elements, nitrogen and phosphorus.   MAGGOT TRAP FOR DESTRUCTION OF FLY LARVÆ FROM HORSE MANURE.  The second method of handling manure is one which does not require the application of chemicals. It is based on the fact, mentioned on page 4, that the larvæ of the house fly, a few hours before they are ready to pupate, show a strong tendency to migrate. This migration takes place mostly at night, and the larvæ sometimes crawl considerable distances from the manure pile. Now it is possible by means of a very simple arrangement called a maggot trap to destroy fully 99 per cent of all maggots breeding in a given lot of manure. A successful maggot trap which the Maryland Agricultural College constructed at the college barn is shown in Figure 9. The trap was designed by R. H. Hutchison and constructed under his supervision. The manure, instead of being thrown on the ground, is heaped carefully on a slatted platform, which stands about 1 foot high. This particular platform measures 10 by 20 feet. There are six 2 by 4 pieces running lengthwise 2 feet apart. Across these are nailed 1-inch strips with 1/2 to 1 inch spaces between them. The wooden platform stands on a concrete floor, and a rim or wall of concrete 4 inches high surrounds the floor. The floor slopes a little toward one corner from which a pipe leads to a small cistern near by. This pipe is plugged with a stopper of soft wood, and the concrete floor is filled with water to a depth of 1 inch in the shallowest part. Flies will lay their eggs on the manure as usual, but the maggots, when they have finished feeding and begin to migrate, crawl out of the manure, drop into the water below, and are drowned. Each week the plug is removed from the pipe, and all the maggots are washed into the cistern. The floor is then cleaned of any solid particles by means of a long-handled stable broom or by a strong stream of water from a hose. The pipe being again plugged, the floor is again partly filled with water and the trap is ready for another week's catch. A platform of this size will hold the manure accumulating from four horses during the period of four months, or about 20 days' accumulation from 25 horses, if the heap is well built and made at least 5 feet high.  [Illustration: FIG. 9. A maggot trap for house-fly control. View showing the concrete basin containing water in which larvæ are drowned, and the wooden platform on which manure is heaped. (Hutchison.)]  Experience with this maggot trap clearly indicates that best results can be secured if the manure is compactly heaped on the platform and kept thoroughly moistened. It is best to apply a small amount of water each morning after the stable cleanings have been added to the pile. It should be borne in mind that in order to make this trap a success the platform beneath the pile must be kept comparatively free of accumulations of manure, and moisture applied regularly to drive the maggots out.   COMPACT HEAPING OF MANURE.  Another method of disposing of manure has been recommended by English writers. The manure is built up in a compact rectangular heap, the sides of which are beaten hard with shovels. The ground around the edges of the heap is made smooth and hard and loose straw is placed in small windrows around the manure pile about 1 foot from the edge. The exclusion of the air, together with the high temperature and gases formed by fermentation, tends to make the heap unfavorable for the development of fly larvæ. Those which do happen to develop in the surface layers will migrate and pupate in the ring of straw around the heap, where they are destroyed by burning.   GARBAGE DISPOSAL AND TREATMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS BREEDING PLACES.  It is just as true under farm conditions as in cities that breeding places other than horse manure must be attended to. Garbage must be disposed of, hog and poultry manure must be cared for, and especially on dairy farms it is extremely important that every precaution be taken to prevent the contamination of milk by flies.  It is very desirable that all refuse possible, accumulated from cities and towns, be burned. Incineration has been practiced successfully by a number of towns and cities with populations of from 10,000 to 15,000 and over. In"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18050"],["title","The House Fly and How to Suppress It (#4)"],["body","cities provision should be made for burning carcasses as well as garbage and other refuse. If city and town garbage is sold to hog feeders the municipal authorities should have control of the sanitary conditions about the feeding yards, as there is great danger from fly breeding in such places if not kept clean.   SEWAGE DISPOSAL IN RELATION TO THE PREVENTION OF FLY-BORNE DISEASES.  In the consideration of these measures we have not touched upon the remedies for house flies breeding in human excrement. On account of the danger of the carriage of typhoid fever, the dropping of human excrement in the open in cities or towns, either in vacant lots or in dark alleyways, should be made a misdemeanor, and the same care should be taken by the sanitary authorities to remove or cover up such depositions as is taken in the removal of the bodies of dead animals. For modern methods of sewage disposal adapted for farm use one should consult Department of Agriculture Department Bulletin No. 57. In the absence of modern methods of sewage disposal, absolutely sanitary privies are prime necessities, whether in towns or on farms. Directions for building and caring for such privies will be found in Farmers' Bulletin 463 and in Yearbook Separate 712, \"Sewage Disposal on the Farm.\" The box privy is always a nuisance from many points of view, and is undoubtedly dangerous as a breeder of flies which may carry the germs of intestinal diseases. The dry-earth treatment of privies is unsatisfactory. No box privy should be permitted to exist unless it is thoroughly and regularly treated with some effective larvicide. Since the fecal matter in such privies is seldom used for fertilizing purposes it may well be treated liberally with borax. The powdered borax may be scattered two or three times a week over the exposed surface so as to whiten it.     WHAT COMMUNITIES CAN DO TO ELIMINATE THE HOUSE FLY.   Antifly crusades have been very numerous in recent years, and some have been noteworthy both in methods and in results. However, it will not be amiss here to emphasize the importance of concerted, organized effort on the part of whole communities, not only cities, but suburban and rural neighborhoods as well. By the most painstaking care one may prevent all fly breeding on his premises, but it will avail him little if his neighbors are not equally careful. Some sort of cooperation is necessary. One of the first and most important elements in any antifly crusade is a vigorous and continued educational campaign. It has been the experience of those who have undertaken such crusades that people generally regard the fly as a somewhat harmless nuisance and that the first work of the campaign was to bring the people to a realization of the dangers from flies and the possibility of getting rid of them. In the educational campaign every possible means of publicity can be employed, including newspapers, lectures, moving pictures, posters, handbills, cartoons, instruction in schools, etc.  The antifly crusade is a matter of public interest and should be supported by the community as a whole and engineered by the health officers. But health officers can do little toward the necessary work of inspection and elimination without funds, and therefore the support of the campaign must manifest itself in increased appropriations for public-health work. Very often it is lack of funds which prevents the health officers from taking the initiative in the antifly crusades, and there must necessarily be much agitation and education before they can profitably take up the work. Right here lies a field for civic associations, women's clubs, boards of trade, etc., to exercise their best energy, initiative, and leadership.
