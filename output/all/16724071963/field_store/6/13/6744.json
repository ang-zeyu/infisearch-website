So we depart from the theatre with our heart so filled with all the beauty and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind so persuaded of its innocence, that we are quite ready to receive its first impressions, or rather to seek an opportunity of awakening them in the heart of another, in order that we may receive the same pleasures and the same sacrifices which we have seen so well represented in the theatre.   12  Scaramouch,[5] who only thinks of one thing.  The doctor,[6] who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has said everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.   13  One likes to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline,[7] because she is unconscious of it. She would be displeasing, if she were not deceived.   14  When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although one did not know it. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. And thus this benefit renders him pleasing to us, besides that such community of intellect as we have with him necessarily inclines the heart to love.   15  Eloquence, which persuades by sweetness, not by authority; as a tyrant, not as a king.   16  Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a way--(1) that those to whom we speak may listen to them without pain and with pleasure; (2) that they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them more willingly to reflection upon it.  It consists, then, in a correspondence which we seek to establish between the head and the heart of those to whom we speak on the one hand, and, on the other, between the thoughts and the expressions which we employ. This assumes that we have studied well the heart of man so as to know all its powers, and then to find the just proportions of the discourse which we wish to adapt to them. We must put ourselves in the place of those who are to hear us, and make trial on our own heart of the turn which we give to our discourse in order to see whether one is made for the other, and whether we can assure ourselves that the hearer will be, as it were, forced to surrender. We ought to restrict ourselves, so far as possible, to the simple and natural, and not to magnify that which is little, or belittle that which is great. It is not enough that a thing be beautiful; it must be suitable to the subject, and there must be in it nothing of excess or defect.   17  Rivers are roads which move,[8] and which carry us whither we desire to go.   18  When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a common error which determines the mind of man, as, for example, the moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons, the progress of diseases, etc. For the chief malady of man is restless curiosity about things which he cannot understand; and it is not so bad for him to be in error as to be curious to no purpose.  The manner in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de Tultie[9] wrote, is the most usual, the most suggestive, the most remembered, and the oftenest quoted; because it is entirely composed of thoughts born from the common talk of life. As when we speak of the common error which exists among men that the moon is the cause of everything, we never fail to say that Salomon de Tultie says that when we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a common error, etc.; which is the thought above.   19  The last thing one settles in writing a book is what one should put in first.   20  _Order._--Why should I undertake to divide my virtues into four rather than into six? Why should I rather establish virtue in four, in two, in one? Why into _Abstine et sustine_[10] rather than into \"Follow Nature,\"[11] or, \"Conduct your private affairs without injustice,\" as Plato,[12] or anything else? But there, you will say, everything is contained in one word. Yes, but it is useless without explanation, and when we come to explain it, as soon as we unfold this maxim which contains all the rest, they emerge in that first confusion which you desired to avoid. So, when they are all included in one, they are hidden and useless, as in a chest, and never appear save in their natural confusion. Nature has established them all without including one in the other.   21  Nature has made all her truths independent of one another. Our art makes one dependent on the other. But this is not natural. Each keeps its own place.   22  Let no one say that I have said nothing new; the arrangement of the subject is new. When we play tennis, we both play with the same ball, but one of us places it better.  I had as soon it said that I used words employed before. And in the same way if the same thoughts in a different arrangement do not form a different discourse, no more do the same words in their different arrangement form different thoughts!   23  Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and meanings differently arranged have different effects.   24  _Language._--We should not turn the mind from one thing to another, except for relaxation, and that when it is necessary and the time suitable, and not otherwise. For he that relaxes out of season wearies, and he who wearies us out of season makes us languid, since we turn quite away. So much does our perverse lust like to do the contrary of what those wish to obtain from us without giving us pleasure, the coin for which we will do whatever is wanted.   25  _Eloquence._--It requires the pleasant and the real; but the pleasant must itself be drawn from the true.   26  Eloquence is a painting of thought; and thus those who, after having painted it, add something more, make a picture instead of a portrait.   27  _Miscellaneous. Language._--Those who make antitheses by forcing words are like those who make false windows for symmetry. Their rule is not to speak accurately, but to make apt figures of speech.   28  Symmetry is what we see at a glance; based on the fact that there is no reason for any difference, and based also on the face of man; whence it happens that symmetry is only wanted in breadth, not in height or depth.   29  When we see a natural style, we are astonished and delighted; for we expected to see an author, and we find a man. Whereas those who have good taste, and who seeing a book expect to find a man, are quite surprised to find an author. _Plus poetice quam humane locutus es._ Those honour Nature well, who teach that she can speak on everything, even on theology.   30  We only consult the ear because the heart is wanting. The rule is uprightness.  Beauty of omission, of judgment.   31  All the false beauties which we blame in Cicero have their admirers, and in great number.   32  There is a certain standard of grace and beauty which consists in a certain relation between our nature, such as it is, weak or strong, and the thing which pleases us.  Whatever is formed according to this standard pleases us, be it house, song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees, rooms, dress, etc. Whatever is not made according to this standard displeases those who have good taste.  And as there is a perfect relation between a song and a house which are made after a good model, because they are like this good model, though each after its kind; even so there is a perfect relation between things made after a bad model. Not that the bad model is unique, for there are many; but each bad sonnet, for example, on whatever false model it is formed, is just like a woman dressed after that model.  Nothing makes us understand better the ridiculousness of a false sonnet than to consider nature and the standard, and then to imagine a woman or a house made according to that standard.   33  _Poetical beauty._--As we speak of poetical beauty, so ought we to speak of mathematical beauty and medical beauty. But we do not do so; and the reason is that we know well what is the object of mathematics, and that it consists in proofs, and what is the object of medicine, and that it consists in healing. But we do not know in what grace consists, which is the object of poetry. We do not know the natural model which we ought to imitate; and through lack of this knowledge, we have coined fantastic terms, \"The golden age,\" \"The wonder of our times,\" \"Fatal,\" etc., and call this jargon poetical beauty.[13]  But whoever imagines a woman after this model, which consists in saying little things in big words, will see a pretty girl adorned with mirrors and chains, at whom he will smile; because we know better wherein consists the charm of woman than the charm of verse. But those who are ignorant would admire her in this dress, and there are many villages in which she would be taken for the queen; hence we call sonnets made after this model \"Village Queens.\"   34  No one passes in the world as skilled in verse unless he has put up the sign of a poet, a mathematician, etc. But educated people do not want a sign, and draw little distinction between the trade of a poet and that of an embroiderer.  People of education are not called poets or mathematicians, etc.; but they are all these, and judges of all these. No one guesses what they are. When they come into society, they talk on matters about which the rest are talking. We do not observe in them one quality rather than another, save when they have to make use of it. But then we remember it, for it is characteristic of such persons that we do not say of them that they are fine speakers, when it is not a question of oratory, and that we say of them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],["title","Pascal's Pens√©es (#5)"],["body","they are fine speakers, when it is such a question.  It is therefore false praise to give a man when we say of him, on his entry, that he is a very clever poet; and it is a bad sign when a man is not asked to give his judgment on some verses.   35  We should not be able to say of a man, \"He is a mathematician,\" or \"a preacher,\" or \"eloquent\"; but that he is \"a gentleman.\" That universal quality alone pleases me. It is a bad sign when, on seeing a person, you remember his book. I would prefer you to see no quality till you meet it and have occasion to use it (_Ne quid nimis_[14]), for fear some one quality prevail and designate the man. Let none think him a fine speaker, unless oratory be in question, and then let them think it.   36  Man is full of wants: he loves only those who can satisfy them all. \"This one is a good mathematician,\" one will say. But I have nothing to do with mathematics; he would take me for a proposition. \"That one is a good soldier.\" He would take me for a besieged town. I need, then, an upright man who can accommodate himself generally to all my wants.   37  [Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be known of everything, we ought to know a little about everything. For it is far better to know something about everything than to know all about one thing. This universality is the best. If we can have both, still better; but if we must choose, we ought to choose the former. And the world feels this and does so; for the world is often a good judge.]   38  A poet and not an honest man.   39  If lightning fell on low places, etc., poets, and those who can only reason about things of that kind, would lack proofs.   40  If we wished to prove the examples which we take to prove other things, we should have to take those other things to be examples; for, as we always believe the difficulty is in what we wish to prove, we find the examples clearer and a help to demonstration.  Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general theorem, we must give the rule as applied to a particular case; but if we wish to demonstrate a particular case, we must begin with the general rule. For we always find the thing obscure which we wish to prove, and that clear which we use for the proof; for, when a thing is put forward to be proved, we first fill ourselves with the imagination that it is therefore obscure, and on the contrary that what is to prove it is clear, and so we understand it easily.   41  _Epigrams of Martial._--Man loves malice, but not against one-eyed men nor the unfortunate, but against the fortunate and proud. People are mistaken in thinking otherwise.  For lust is the source of all our actions, and humanity, etc. We must please those who have humane and tender feelings. That epigram about two one-eyed people is worthless,[15] for it does not console them, and only gives a point to the author's glory. All that is only for the sake of the author is worthless. _Ambitiosa recident ornamenta._[16]   42  To call a king \"Prince\" is pleasing, because it diminishes his rank.   43  Certain authors, speaking of their works, say, \"My book,\" \"My commentary,\" \"My history,\" etc. They resemble middle-class people who have a house of their own, and always have \"My house\" on their tongue. They would do better to say, \"Our book,\" \"Our commentary,\" \"Our history,\" etc., because there is in them usually more of other people's than their own.   44  Do you wish people to believe good of you? Don't speak.   45  Languages are ciphers, wherein letters are not changed into letters, but words into words, so that an unknown language is decipherable.   46  A maker of witticisms, a bad character.   47  There are some who speak well and write badly. For the place and the audience warm them, and draw from their minds more than they think of without that warmth.   48  When we find words repeated in a discourse, and, in trying to correct them, discover that they are so appropriate that we would spoil the discourse, we must leave them alone. This is the test; and our attempt is the work of envy, which is blind, and does not see that repetition is not in this place a fault; for there is no general rule.   49  To mask nature and disguise her. No more king, pope, bishop--but _august monarch_, etc.; not Paris--_the capital of the kingdom_. There are places in which we ought to call Paris, Paris, and others in which we ought to call it the capital of the kingdom.   50  The same meaning changes with the words which express it. Meanings receive their dignity from words instead of giving it to them. Examples should be sought....   51  Sceptic, for obstinate.   52  No one calls another a Cartesian[17] but he who is one himself, a pedant but a pedant, a provincial but a provincial; and I would wager it was the printer who put it on the title of _Letters to a Provincial_.   53  A carriage _upset_ or _overturned_, according to the meaning _To spread abroad_ or _upset_, according to the meaning. (The argument by force of M. le Ma√Ætre[18] over the friar.)   54  _Miscellaneous._--A form of speech, \"I should have liked to apply myself to that.\"   55  The _aperitive_ virtue of a key, the _attractive_ virtue of a hook.   56  To guess: \"The part that I take in your trouble.\" The Cardinal[19] did not want to be guessed.  \"My mind is disquieted.\" _I am disquieted_ is better.   57  I always feel uncomfortable under such compliments as these: \"I have given you a great deal of trouble,\" \"I am afraid I am boring you,\" \"I fear this is too long.\" We either carry our audience with us, or irritate them.   58  You are ungraceful: \"Excuse me, pray.\" Without that excuse I would not have known there was anything amiss. \"With reverence be it spoken ....\" The only thing bad is their excuse.   59  \"To extinguish the torch of sedition\"; too luxuriant. \"The restlessness of his genius\"; two superfluous grand words.     SECTION II  THE MISERY OF MAN WITHOUT GOD   60  _First part_: Misery of man without God.  _Second part_: Happiness of man with God.  Or, _First part_: That nature is corrupt. Proved by nature itself.  _Second part_: That there is a Redeemer. Proved by Scripture.   61  _Order._--I might well have taken this discourse in an order like this: to show the vanity of all conditions of men, to show the vanity of ordinary lives, and then the vanity of philosophic lives, sceptics, stoics; but the order would not have been kept. I know a little what it is, and how few people understand it. No human science can keep it. Saint Thomas[20] did not keep it. Mathematics keep it, but they are useless on account of their depth.   62  _Preface to the first part._--To speak of those who have treated of the knowledge of self; of the divisions of Charron,[21] which sadden and weary us; of the confusion of Montaigne;[22] that he was quite aware of his want of method, and shunned it by jumping from subject to subject; that he sought to be fashionable.  His foolish project of describing himself! And this not casually and against his maxims, since every one makes mistakes, but by his maxims themselves, and by first and chief design. For to say silly things by chance and weakness is a common misfortune; but to say them intentionally is intolerable, and to say such as that ...   63  _Montaigne._--Montaigne's faults are great. Lewd words; this is bad, notwithstanding Mademoiselle de Gournay.[23] Credulous; _people without eyes_.[24] Ignorant; _squaring the circle,[25] a greater world_.[26] His opinions on suicide, on death.[27] He suggests an indifference about salvation, _without fear and without repentance_.[28] As his book was not written with a religious purpose, he was not bound to mention religion; but it is always our duty not to turn men from it. One can excuse his rather free and licentious opinions on some relations of life (730,231)[29]; but one cannot excuse his thoroughly pagan views on death, for a man must renounce piety altogether, if he does not at least wish to die like a Christian. Now, through the whole of his book his only conception of death is a cowardly and effeminate one.   64  It is not in Montaigne, but in myself, that I find all that I see in him.   65  What good there is in Montaigne can only have been acquired with difficulty. The evil that is in him, I mean apart from his morality, could have been corrected in a moment, if he had been informed that he made too much of trifles and spoke too much of himself.   66  One must know oneself. If this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life, and there is nothing better.   67  _The vanity of the sciences._--Physical science will not console me for the ignorance of morality in the time of affliction. But the science of ethics will always console me for the ignorance of the physical sciences.   68  Men are never taught to be gentlemen, and are taught everything else; and they never plume themselves so much on the rest of their knowledge as on knowing how to be gentlemen. They only plume themselves on knowing the one thing they do not know.   69  _The infinites, the mean._--When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing.   70  _Nature_ ...--[Nature has set us so well in the centre, that if we change one side of the balance, we change the other also. _I act._ Œ§·Ω± Œ∂·ø∂Œ± œÑœÅ·Ω≥œáŒµŒπ. This makes me believe that the springs in our brain are so adjusted that he who touches one touches also its contrary.]   71  Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth; give him too much, the same.   72  _Man's disproportion._--[This is where our innate knowledge leads us. If it be not true, there is no truth in man; and if it be true, he finds therein great cause for humiliation, being compelled to abase himself in one way or another. And since he cannot exist without this knowledge, I wish that, before entering on deeper researches into nature, he would consider her both seriously and at leisure, that he would reflect upon himself also, and knowing what proportion"]]]
