Yet, first and last, it was an act of fine and desperate recklessness--the recklessness of a soul possessed and set on one dominating purpose. This was Hervey Willetts all over. And because he had a brain and the eagle none or little, he thus used his very enemy to help him accomplish his purpose.  In that very moment when Tom Slade heard with a shudder the appalling sound of that splitting branch, something beside the brown nest was also dangling from the branch which the baffled eagle had suddenly deserted. Right close to the swaying nest the boy hung, his limbs encircling it, his two hands locked upon it, trusting to it, just trusting to it. It bent low in a great sweeping curve, the nest swayed and swung from the movement of the swing downward, a little olive-colored, speckled head peeking cautiously out as if to see what all the rumpus was about.  It must have seemed to those little frightened eyes that the familiar geography of the neighborhood was radically changed. But there was nothing near to strike terror to it now. There was nothing near but the green, enshrouding foliage, and the brown object hanging almost motionless close by.  This was Hervey Willetts of the patrol of the blue scarf, scout of the first class (if ever there was one) and winner of twenty-one merit badges....  No, not twenty-one. Twenty and two-thirds.     CHAPTER IX  TO INTRODUCE ORESTES   Hervey moved cautiously in along the limb to a point where he felt sure that it would hold his weight, and as he did so it moved slowly up into place. What the little householder thought of all this topsy-turvy business it might be amusing to know. For surely, if the world war changed the map of Europe, the little neighborhood of leaf and branch where this timid denizen of the woods lived and had its being, had been subject to jolts and changes quite as sweeping. Now and again it poked its downy speckled head out for a kind of disinterested squint at things, apparently unconcerned with mighty upheavals so long as its little home was undisturbed.  Hervey Willetts straddled the branch and calculated the thickness of it.  \"You all right?\" he heard Tom call from below.  \"Yop,\" he called back; \"did you see his nobs fly away? Back to the crags for him, hey? Wait down there a few minutes, I'm going to bring a friend.\"  Hervey had now a very nice little calculation to make. In the first place he must not frighten his new acquaintance by approaching too near again. Neither must he make any sudden and unnecessary noise or motions. He knew that a nest of that particular sort was more than a home, it was a comparatively safe refuge, and he knew that its occupant would not emerge and desert it without good cause. One of those precious twenty badges was evidence of that much knowledge.  His purpose was to cut the branch as near to the nest as he dared, both from the standpoint of the bird's peace of mind and his own safety. The further from the nest he cut, the thicker would be the branch, and the more cutting there would be to do. To cut too near to the nest might frighten his little neighbor on the branch, and endanger his own life.  Yet if he cut the branch where it was thick, how could he handle it after it was detached? How would he get down with it through all that network of lower branches?  In his quandary he hit on a plan involving new peril for himself and doubtless some agitation to his little neighbor. He would not detach the nest from its branch, for how could he ever attach it to another branch in a way satisfactory to that finicky little householder? He knew enough about his business to know that no bird would continue to live in a nest which had been tampered with to that extent.  So he advanced cautiously out on the branch again till he could reach the nest. Then very gently he bound his handkerchief about the opening. Having done this, he cut into the branch with his scout knife within about six or eight inches of the nest. When he had cut the branch almost through it was a pretty ticklish matter, straddling the stubby end, for he had the tip of the branch with the nest still in his hand and was in danger of losing his balance.  Sitting there with his legs pressed up tight against the under side of the branch so as to hold his balance on his precarious seat, he held the end in one hand while he carefully pulled away the twigs from the end beyond the nest. Thus he had a piece of branch perhaps twenty inches long, with the nest hanging midway of it. This he held with the greatest care, lest in turning the branch the delicate fabric by which it hung should strain and break away. You would have thought that that little prisoner of the speckled head owned the tree, which in point of fact was owned by Temple Camp, notwithstanding its distance from the scout community. So it was really Hervey's more than it was little downy-head's if it comes to that.  It is not every landlord that goes to so much trouble for a tenant.     CHAPTER X  OFF WITH THE OLD LOVE, ON WITH THE NEW   \"All right, we're coming down; kill the fatted calf,\" Hervey called with all his former gay manner. \"No more up and down trails for me. This is moving day.\"  When he had descended a little nearer, Tom heard the cheery voice more clearly. \"It's no easy job moving a house and family. I have to watch my step. Oh, boy, _coming down!_ This tree is tied in a sailor's knot.\"  \"Are you bringing the bird?\" Tom called.  \"I'm bringing the bird and the whole block he lived in,\" Hervey called back merrily. \"I'm transplanting the neighborhood. He's going to move into a better locality--very fashionable. He's coming up in the world--I mean down. _O-o-h, boy_, watch your step; there was a narrow escape! I stepped on a chunk of air.\"  So he came down working his way with both feet and one hand, and holding the precious piece of branch with its dangling nest in the other.  \"Talk about your barbed wire entanglements,\" he called. Then, after a minute, \"This little codger lives in a swing,\" he shouted; \"I should think she'd get dizzy. No accounting for tastes, hey? Whoa--boy! There's where I nearly took a double-header. If I should fall now, I wouldn't have so far to go.\"  \"You won't fall,\" said Tom with a note of admiring confidence in his brief remark.  \"Better knock wood,\" came the cheery answer from above.  And presently his trim, agile form stood upon the lowest stalwart limb, as he balanced himself with one hand against the trunk. His khaki jacket was in shreds, a great rent was in his sleeve, and a tear in one of his stockings showed a long bloody scratch beneath. In his free hand he held the piece of branch with its depending nest, extending his arm out so as to keep the rescued trophy safe from any harm of contact.  \"Some rags, hey?\" he called down good-humoredly, and exposing his figure in grotesque attitude for sober Tom's amusement. \"If mother could only see me now! Get out from under while I swing down. Back to terra cotta--I mean firma. Here goes----\"  Down he came, tumbling forward, and sprawling on the ground, while he held the branch above him, like the Statue of Liberty lighting the world.  \"Here we are,\" he said. \"Take it while I have a look at my leg. It's nothing but an abrasion. It looks like a trail from my ankle up to the back of my knee. What care we? I've got trails on the brain, haven't I?\"  Tom took the branch and stood looking admiringly, yet with a glint of amusement lighting his stolid features, at the younger boy, who sat with his knees drawn up humorously inspecting the scratch on his leg.  \"Well, what do you think of eagles now?\" Tom asked, in his dull way.  \"Decline to be interviewed,\" Hervey said, with irrepressible buoyancy. \"What kind of a crazy bird is this that lives upside down in a house that looks like a bat. It reminds me of a plum pudding, hanging in the pantry. What's that streak of red, anyway? His patrol colors? You'd think he'd get seasick, wouldn't you?\"  \"You've got the bird badge,\" Tom said, smiling a little; \"can't you guess?\"  What Tom did not realize was that this merry, reckless, impulsive young dare-devil, whose very talk, as he jumped from one theme to another, made him smile in spite of himself, could not be expected to bear in mind the record of his whole remarkable accomplishment. He was no handbook scout.  There is the scout who learns a thing so that he may know it. But there is the scout who learns a thing so that he may do it. And having done it, he forgets it. Perhaps there is the scout who learns, does, and remembers. But Hervey was not of that order. He had made a plunge for each merit badge, won it and, presto, his nervous mind was on another. It takes all kinds of scouts to make a world.  Perhaps Hervey was not the ideal scout, but there was something very fascinating about his blithe way of going after a thing, getting it, and burdening his mind with it no more. He lived for the present. His na√Øve manner of asking Tom for a tip as to a trail had greatly amused the more experienced scout, who now could not understand how Hervey had used the handbook so much and knew it so imperfectly.  \"Didn't you ever see one before?\" Tom asked.  \"Not while I was conscious,\" Hervey shot back, \"but if he likes to live that way it's none of my business. He's inside taking a nap, I guess. He had some rocky road to Dublin coming down. I wonder what he thinks? That wasn't the right kind of a trail, was it?\"  \"Wasn't it?\" Tom queried.  \"No; I want a trail along the ground.\"  \"Still after the Eagle, huh? Do you realize what you have done?\"  \"I've torn my suit all to shreds, I know that. Right the first time, hey? I'd look nice going up on the platform Saturday night? Good I won't have to, hey?\"  \"I thought you were going to,\" Tom said soberly.  \"So I am,\" Hervey shot back at him; \"trails up in the air don't count. Never mind, I'll find a trail to-morrow. It's my troop I'm thinking of. I'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18180"],["title","Tom Slade on Mystery Trail (#5)"],["body","it, all right. When I get my mind on a thing.... Hey, Slady, what in the dickens is that streak of red in the nest? Is it a trade mark or something like that? You're a naturalist.\"  \"It's an oriole's nest,\" Tom said, with just a note of good-humored impatience in his voice. \"I thought you'd know that.\"  \"You see my head is full of the Eagle badge just now,\" Hervey pleaded, \"but I'm going to look up orioles.\"  Tom smiled.  \"I'm going to look up orioles, and I'm going to get Doc to put some iodine on my leg, and I'm going to do that tracking stunt to-morrow. There's three things I'm going to do.\"  Tom paused, seemingly irresolute, as if not knowing whether to say what was in his mind or not. And presently they started toward the camp, Hervey limping along and carrying the branch.  \"An oriole picks up everything he can find and weaves it into his nest,\" Tom said; \"string, ribbon, bits of straw, any old thing. He likes things that are bright colored.\"  \"He's got the right idea, there,\" Hervey said.  Tom tried again to interest the rescuer in this little companion, imprisoned within its own cozy little home, whom they were taking back to camp. He could not comprehend how one who had performed such a stunt as Hervey had just performed, and been so careful and humane, could forget about his act so soon and take so little interest in the bird which had been saved by his reckless courage. But that was Hervey Willetts all over. His heart went where action was. And his interest lapsed when action ceased.  \"Somebody in a book called the oriole Orestes, because that means dweller in the woods,\" Tom ventured.  \"He dwells in a sky-scraper, that's what _I_ say,\" Hervey commented. \"In a hall bedroom upside down, twenty floors up.\"  Tom tried again. \"What do you mean to do with her now that you've got her?\" he asked.  \"I'm going to turn her over to you, Slady. You're the real scout; none genuine unless marked T. S. You've got the birds all eating out of your hands.\"  \"You didn't tear the nest from the branch,\" Tom said. \"You must have had some idea.\"  \"Well,\" said Hervey, \"my idea was to stick it up in an elm tree down at camp. Think she'd stand for it?\"  \"Guess so,\" Tom said.  \"You see I'm all through bird study,\" Hervey said with amusing artlessness, \"so I think you'd better adopt Erastus--is that the way you say it?\"  \"Orestes,\" Tom corrected him.  \"Pardon _me_,\" Hervey said.  \"Maybe you don't even care if I tell them what you did?\" Tom queried.  \"Tell them whatever you want,\" Hervey said. \"I don't care. What I'm thinking now is----\"  \"The next stunt,\" Tom interrupted him.  \"You said it,\" Hervey answered cheerily; \"just about a mile or so of tracks. I guess you think I'm kind of happy-go-lucky, don't you?\"  \"I don't blame you for not remembering all the things you've done,\" Tom said, \"and all the rules and tests and like that. But most every scout goes in for some particular thing. Maybe it's first aid, or maybe it's signaling. And he keeps on with that thing even after he has the badge.\"  \"That's right,\" Hervey concurred with surprising readiness. \"You've got the right idea. My specialty is the Eagle badge. See?\"  \"Well, that's twenty-one badges,\" Tom said.  \"Right-o, and all I need to do now is test three for the stalking badge and I'm _it_. And if I can't go over the top between now and this time Saturday, I'll never look the fellows in my troop in the face again, that's what.\"  Tom whistled to himself a moment as they strolled along. Perhaps he knew more than he wished to say. Perhaps he was just a little out of patience with this sprightly, irresponsible young hero.  \"Well, there isn't much time,\" he said.  \"That's the trouble, Slady, and it's got me guessing.\"     CHAPTER XI  OFF ON A NEW TACK   It is doubtful if ever there was a scout at Temple Camp for whom Tom felt a greater interest or by whom he was more attracted than by this irrepressible boy whose ready prowess he had just witnessed. And the funny part of it was that no two persons could possibly have been more unlike than these two. Hervey even got on Tom's nerves somewhat by his blithe disregard of the handbook side of scouting, except for what it was worth to him in his stuntful career.  The handbook was almost a sacred volume to sober Tom. Still, he was captivated by Hervey, as indeed others were in the big camp.  \"Well, you were after the Eagle and you got an oriole,\" he said, half jokingly. \"That's what I meant when I said that sometimes you don't know where a trail will bring you out. You got a lot to learn about scouting. What you did to-day was better than tracking a half a mile or so.\"  \"The pleasure is mine,\" said Hervey, in bantering acknowledgment of the compliment, \"but if there's anything higher in scouting than the Eagle award, I'd like to know what it is.\"  \"How much good has it done you trying for it?\" Tom asked. \"Nobody is supposed to go after a thing in scouting the same as he does in a game. He's supposed to learn things why he's going after something,\" he added in his clumsy way. \"You went through the bird study test and you didn't even know it was an oriole's nest that you rescued. And you forgot all about something else too, and it makes me laugh when I think about it; when I think about you and your tracks.\"  \"You think I'm a punk scout,\" Hervey sang out, gayly.  \"I think you're a bully scout,\" Tom said.  \"If I win the Eagle you'll say so, won't you?\"  \"Maybe.\"  \"And do you mean to tell me that a scout can be any more of a scout than that--an Eagle Scout?\"  \"Sure,\" said Tom uncompromisingly.  For a few seconds the young hero of the lofty elm was too astonished to reply. Then he said, \"Gee, you're a peachy scout, everybody says that, but you're a funny kind of a fellow, that's what _I_ think. I don't get you. The Eagle award is the highest award in scouting. It means, oh, it means a couple of hundred stunts--hard ones. You can't get above that. You're one yourself, you can't deny it. No, sir, you can't get above that--no, _siree_.... Do you mean to tell me that there's anything higher in scouting than the Eagle award?\" he asked defiantly, after a pause.  \"Yop, there is,\" said Tom, unmoved.  Hervey paused in consternation. \"Well, I'm for the Eagle award, anyway,\" he finally said. \"That's good enough for _me_. And I'm going to get it, too; right away, quick.\"  \"You'll get it,\" Tom said.  \"Think I will?\"  \"I don't think, I know.\"  \"You mean you're _sure_ I will?\"  \"That's what I said.\"  \"_Positive?_\"  \"That's what I said.\"  \"Well, then I'd better get busy hunting for some tracks, hadn't I? I've got to make good to _you_ as well as to my troop, haven't I?\"  \"You ask a lot of questions,\" said Tom in his funny, sober way. \"You don't need to make good with me.\"  \"Believe _me_, I've got you and my troop both on my mind now. Are you going to give me a tip about some tracks?\"  \"Maybe--to-morrow,\" Tom said.  \"Do you know what I think I'll do, Slady?\" Hervey suddenly vociferated as if caught by an inspiration. \"I think I'll follow this ledge around a little way and see if there are any prints. Good idea, hey?\"  This was too much for Tom. \"Aren't you coming back to camp with me?\" he asked. \"They'll want to hear about your adventure. It's getting pretty late, too.\"  \"Oh, I'm a regular night owl,\" Hervey said. \"You take Asbestos back to camp and hang him up in a tree and I'll blow in later. I'm going on the war path for tracks. So long.\"  Before Tom had recovered from his surprise, Hervey was picking his way along the rocky ledge at the base of the mountain, apparently oblivious to all that had happened, and intent upon a rambling quest for tracks. It was quite characteristic of him that he based his search upon no hint or well considered plan, but went looking for the tracks of a wild animal as one will hunt for shells, along the beach.  And there stood Tom, holding the memorial of Hervey's heroism in his hand. Hervey had apparently forgotten all about it....     CHAPTER XII  AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT   Hervey picked his way among the rocks, looking here and there in the crevices and upon the intervening ground as if he had lost something. A more random quest could scarcely be imagined. Tom watched him for a few minutes, then took the shorter way to camp with his little charge.  Hervey followed the rocky ledge for about fifty yards to a point where the dry bed of a stream came winding down out of the mountain. It ran in a tiny canyon between two rocks and so out upon the level fields to the south where the camp lay.  The twilight was well advanced now, the last vivid patches were mellowed into a pervading gray, which seemed to cover the rocks and woods like a mantle. Clad in this somber robe, the wooded height which rose to the north seemed the more forbidding. Not a sound was to be heard but the voice of a whip-poor-will somewhere. Even Hervey's buoyant nature was subdued by the solemn stillness.  Suddenly something between the two rocks caught his eye. The caked earth looked as if a narrow board had been drawn over it. Bordering this broad line, about half an inch from it on either side, were two narrow fancy lines--or at least that is what Hervey called them. Examining these carefully, he saw that they were made up of tiny, diagonal lines. In the place where this ran between the rocks, in the deep shadow, these singular marks were surprisingly legible, and bore not a little the appearance of a border design. The big stones formed a sort of shadow box, causing the markings to appear in bold relief.  Hervey knew nothing of the freakish influence of light on tracks and trails, but he saw here something which he knew had been made by a moving object. The continuous design was so nearly perfect that it seemed like the work of human beings, but Hervey knew that it could hardly be this.  What, then, was it?  Where the lines emerged from between the rocks the marking was less regular and less clear, but plain enough in the damp, crusted earth which"]]]
