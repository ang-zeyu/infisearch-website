Now, skip along, and remember your message.\"  \"Yes, Mr. Edward Maynard wants advice and assistance from Nobody! Well, I guess that's right, Father, but it all sounds to me like an April Fool joke. Come on, Midget.\"  As the two children skipped away, King said, thoughtfully, \"What does it all mean, Mops?\"  \"I dunno, King. But it means _something_. It isn't a wild-goose chase, or an April-fool sort of joke. I know Father has some nice surprise for us the way his eyes twinkled.\"  \"Well, but this empty house business seems so silly! I know nobody lives there, for I passed there a few days ago, and it was all shut up.\"  \"Well, we'll soon find out,\" and the children turned the corner toward the house in question. Sure enough, the blinds were closed and there was no sign of habitation.  \"Mr. Nobody lives here, all right!\" said King as they entered the gate.  \"And such a pretty place, too,\" commented Marjorie, looking at the luxuriant vines that ran riot over the front veranda.  King rang the bell, feeling half-angry and half-silly at the performance. In a moment the door swung open, but no person was seen.  \"Well!\" exclaimed King. \"Nobody opened that door!\"  \"We must walk in,\" said Midget. \"Father said so.\"  \"Oh, I hate to! We really haven't any right to go into a strange house like this!\"  \"But Father said to! Come on!\" And grasping King's hand, Midget urged him inside. They stood in the middle of a pretty and attractively furnished hall, but saw or heard no people.  \"Hello, Mr. Nobody!\" said Marjorie, still clasping King's hand tightly, for the situation was a little weird.  \"Hello, yourself!\" responded a cheery voice, but they couldn't see any one.  The voice reassured King, and he said, humorously, \"I see Nobody! How do you do, sir?\"  \"Quite well,\" answered the same voice, but it was a bit muffled, and they couldn't judge where it came from. Also it sounded very gay and laughing, and Marjorie thought it seemed a bit familiar, though she couldn't place it.  \"My father sent a message,\" went on King, sturdily. \"He says he wants Nobody's advice and assistance.\"  \"What a self-reliant man!\" said the voice, and then from behind a portière a laughing face appeared, followed by a man's active body. At the same time, from an opposite portière, a lady sprang out and took Marjorie in her arms.  \"Cousin Ethel!\"  \"Cousin Jack!\"  And the children laughed in glee as they recognized Mr. and Mrs. Bryant.  \"You dear things!\" the lady exclaimed. \"I think it's awful to startle you so, but it's the joke of your father and your Cousin Jack. I was afraid it would scare you. Did it?\"  \"Not exactly,\" said Marjorie, cuddling in Cousin Ethel's arms, but King protested:  \"No, indeed!\" he declared. \"I wasn't scared, but I felt a little queer.\"  \"You're two Ducky Daddles!\" Cousin Ethel cried, and Cousin Jack slapped King on the shoulder and said, \"You're a trump, old man!\" and King felt very grown-up and manly.  \"What's it all about?\" he inquired, and Mr. Bryant replied:  \"Well, you see, if you've room for us here in Seacote, we're going to stay here for a while. In fact, we've taken this shack with such an intention.\"  \"Oh!\" cried Marjorie. \"You've taken this house for the summer, and Father knew it, and sent us over here to be surprised!\"  \"You've sized up the situation exactly, Mehitabel,\" said Cousin Jack, who loved to call Midget by this old-fashioned name. \"And now, if we were properly invited, and very strongly urged, we _might_ be persuaded to go home to dinner with you.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Marjorie, a light breaking in upon her, \"you're the dinner guests they're expecting!\"  \"We sure are!\" said Cousin Jack. \"And as this is the first time we've been invited out to dinner in Seacote, we're impatient to go.\"  So they set off for the Maynard house, and Midget led the way with Cousin Ethel.  \"When did you come?\" she inquired.  \"Only this morning, dear. We're not quite set to rights yet, though I brought my own servants, and they'll soon have us all comfy.\"  \"And how did you and Father fix up this plan?\"  \"He was over here this afternoon, and he and Cousin Jack planned it. Then, as soon as you left your house, your father telephoned over here, and we prepared to receive you in that crazy fashion. Of course, Jack opened the door and stayed behind it. You weren't frightened, were you?\"  \"No, not really. But it seemed a little,--a little creepy, you know.\"  \"Of course it did!\" cried Cousin Jack from behind them. \"But that house is so overhung with creepers it makes you feel creepy anyway. I'm going to call it Creeper Castle.\"  \"Oh, don't!\" said Marjorie. \"It sounds horrid! Makes you think of caterpillars and things like that!\"  \"So it does! Well, Mehitabel, you name it for us. I can't live in a house without a name.\"  \"I'd call it Bryant Bower. That sounds flowery and pretty.\"  \"Just the ticket! You're a genius for names! Bryant Bower it is. What's the name of your house,--Maynard Mansion?\"  \"Maynard Manor is prettier,\" suggested Cousin Ethel.  \"So it is! Maynard Manor goes! I don't know anybody with prettier manners than the Maynards, especially the younger generation of them,\" and though Cousin Jack spoke laughingly, there was an earnest undertone in his voice that greatly pleased King and Marjorie.  \"Hooray!\" cried that hilarious gentleman, as they reached the Maynards' veranda. \"Hello, Ed. How d'ye do, Helen? Here we are! We're returning your youngsters right side up with care. Why, look who's here!\" and catching up Rosy Posy, he tossed her high in the air, to the little girl's great delight.  Dinner was a festive occasion indeed, and afterward they all sat on the wide veranda and listened to the roar of the waves.  \"This is a restful place,\" said Cousin Ethel, as she leaned back comfortably in her wicker rocker.  \"So it is,\" agreed her husband, \"but, if you ask _me_, I think it's _too_ restful. I like a place with some racket to it, don't you, Hezekiah?\"  This was his pet name for King, and the boy replied:  \"There's fun enough here, Cousin Jack, if you make it yourself.\"  \"That's so, is it? Well, I guess I'll try to make some. Let's see, isn't Fourth of July next week?\"  \"Yes, it is,\" said Marjorie. \"Next week, Wednesday.\"  \"Well, that's a good day to have fun; and an especially good day for a racket. What shall we do, kiddies?\"  \"Do you mean for us to choose?\" asked Marjorie.  \"No, Mehitabel; you suggest, and I'll choose. You think of the very nicest sort of celebrations you know, and I'll select the nicest of them all.\"  \"Well,\" said Midget, thoughtfully, \"there's a party or a picnic. How many people do you mean, Cousin Jack? And do you mean children or grown-ups?\"  \"Now I feel aggrieved, and insulted, and chagrined, and many other awful things!\" Cousin Jack looked so woe-begone that they almost thought him in earnest. \"You _know_, Mehitabel, that I'm but a child myself! I'm not a grown-up, and I never will be!\"  \"That's so!\" laughed his wife.  \"And so, us children will have a celebration of the children, for the children, and by the children! How many perfectly good children do you know down here?\"  \"Not many,\" said King; \"hardly any, in fact, except the Sand Club.\"  \"The Sand Club! That sounds interesting. Tell me about it.\"  So King and Marjorie told all about the Sand Club and its six members, and Cousin Jack declared that was just enough for his idea of a Fourth of July celebration.  \"Now for the plan,\" he went on. \"How about a picnic in the woods, which I see sticking up over there, and then come back to Bryant Bower for some fireworks later?\"  \"I think that sounds beautiful!\" said Marjorie, and King entirely agreed.  \"Why not have the fireworks here?\" said Mr. Maynard. \"You're too good to these children, Jack.\"  \"Not a bit of it. We can have a celebration here some other night. But I've picked out the glorious Fourth for my own little racketty-packetty party. You see, on that day we can make all the noise we like and not get arrested.\"  \"Can we dress up, Cousin Jack?\" asked Marjorie.  \"Sure, child; wear your best bib and tucker, if you like, but I like you better in your play-clothes.\"  \"I don't mean that. I mean costumes.\"  \"Midget is great for dressing up,\" explained King. \"She always wants some cheesecloth wobbed around her, and veils and feathers on her head.\"  \"Oh, I see! Why, yes, I rather guess we _can_ dress up.\"  \"I'll wear a red, white, and blue sash, and a liberty cap,\" said Midget, her eyes dancing.  \"Oh, we can do better than that,\" responded Cousin Jack. \"Let's see; we'll make it a sort of reception affair, and you, Mehitabel, can be the Goddess of Liberty, or Miss Columbia, whichever you like. Hezekiah, you can be Uncle Sam! Your respected Cousin Ethel and I will guarantee your costume.\"  \"I want to be a somefin',\" spoke up Rosamond, who had been allowed to stay up later than usual, in honor of the guests.  \"So you shall, Babykins. I guess we'll let Sister be Miss Columbia, and you shall be a dear little Goddess of Liberty all your own self! How's that?\" and Cousin Jack beamed at the smiling Rosy Posy.  \"Now, where shall the picnic be?\" asked Cousin Ethel, ready to help along the plans.  \"There's a lovely grove over beyond the pier,\" said Midget; \"we might go there.\"  \"The very place!\" said Cousin Jack; \"and we'll have a sand-pail picnic. Didn't you say your coat-of-arms was a sand-pail?\"  \"Yes, that's the Emblem of the Club.\"  \"And a fine emblem for a picnic. We'll have pails of sandwiches and cakes, and a pail of lemonade, and a pail of ice cream. How's that for emblems?\"  \"Fine!\" said King. \"Shall I invite the guests?\"  \"Yes, my boy. Tell them to assemble here at three o'clock, and we'll depart at once. Tell them all to wear red, white, and blue in honor of the day.\"  \"And do we catch firecrackers?\"  \"Little ones,--and torpedoes. But no cannon crackers or cap-pistols or bombs or any firearms.

In the middle of the floor he sat up and looked around. Nothing stirred--not the painted figures on the wooden walls, nor the boy who now stood in the doorway. This boy was gray-eyed and flaxen-haired, and might have been eleven or twelve years old. He was looking for the good old priest, Father Ansgar, and the wild shy animal eyeing him from the foot of the altar made it only too clear that the church, like the village, was deserted.  Father Ansgar was dead of the strange swift pestilence that was called in 1348 the Black Death. So also were the sexton, the cooper, the shoemaker, and almost all the people of the valley. A ship had come into Bergen with the plague on board, and it spread through Norway like a grass-fire. Only last week Thorolf Erlandsson[1] had had a father and mother, a grandmother, two younger sisters and a brother. Now he was alone. In the night the dairy woman and the plowmen at Ormgard farm had run away. Other farms and houses were already closed and silent, or plundered and burned. Ormgard being remote had at first escaped the sickness.  Thorolf turned away from the church door and began to climb the mountain. At the lane leading to his home he did not stop, but kept on into the woods. It was not so lonely there.  Up and up he climbed, the thrilling scent of fir-balsam in his nostrils, the small friendly noises of the forest all about him. Only a few months ago he had come down this very road with his father, driving the cattle and goats home from the summer pasture. All the other farmers were doing the same, and the clear notes of the lure, the long curving horn, used for calling the cattle and signaling across valleys, soared from slope to slope. There was laughter and shouting and joking all the way down. Now the only persons abroad seemed to be thieving ruffians whose greed for plunder was more than their fear of the plague.  A thought came to the boy. How could he leave his father's cattle unfed and uncared for? What if he were to drive the cows himself to the saeter and tend them through the summer? He faced about, resolutely, and began to descend the hill.  Within sight of the familiar roofs he heard some one coming from the village, on horseback. It proved to be Nils the son of Magnus the son of Nils who was called the Bear-Slayer, with a sack of grain and a pair of saddlebags on a sedate brown pony. Nils was lame of one foot and no taller than a boy of nine, although he was thirteen this month and his head was nearly as large as a man's. He had been an orphan from baby-hood, and for the last three years had lived in the priest's house learning to be a clerk.  \"Hoh!\" called Nils, \"where are you going?\"  \"To the farm to get our cattle and take them to the saeter. There is no one left to do it but me.\"  \"Cattle?\" queried the other interestedly, \"She will be glad of that.\"  \"She!\" said Thorolf, \"who?\"  \"The Wind-wife[2]--Mother Elle, who used to sell wind to the sailors--the Finnish woman from Stavanger. She has gathered up a lot of children who have no one to look after them and is leading them into the mountains. She has Nikolina Sven's daughter Larsson, and Olof and Anders Amundson, and half a score of younger ones from different villages. She says that if it is God's will for the plague to come to the saeter it will come, but it is not there now, and it is in the valleys and the towns. She has gone on with the small ones who cannot walk fast, and left Olof and Anders and me to bring along the ponies with the loads. I'll help you drive your beasts.\"  Without trouble the lads got the animals out of the byres and headed them up the road. Norway is so sharply divided by precipitous mountain ranges and deeply-penetrating fiords, that it may be but a few miles from a farm near sea level to the high grassy pastures three or four thousand feet above it where the cattle are pastured in summer. The saeter maidens live there in their cottages from June to September, making butter and cheese, tending the herds and doing such other work as they can. The saeter belonging to Ormgard and its neighbors was the one chosen by Mother Elle as a refuge for her flock.  The forest of magnificent firs through which the road passed presently grew less somber, beginning to be streaked with white birches whose bright leaves twinkled in the sun. Then it reached the height at which evergreens cease to grow. The birches were shorter and sparser, and through the"]]]
