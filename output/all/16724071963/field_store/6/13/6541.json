It was repeated, but still she did not move or speak; but at the third knock she rose, went to the door, and found the adjutant-general there.  \"He informed her that his friends had gone and she might now close her house for the night.  \"She did so, then lay down again, but not to sleep. She lay thinking of the momentous secret she had just learned, considering how she might help to avert the threatened danger to the patriot army, and asking help and guidance from her heavenly Father.  \"Her prayer was heard; she laid her plans, then at early dawn arose. Waking her husband she told him flour was wanted for the family and she must go immediately to the mill at Frankford for it. Then taking a bag to carry it in, she started at once on foot.  \"At General Howe's headquarters she obtained a passport to leave the city.  \"She had a five miles' walk to Frankford, where she left her bag at the mill, and hurried on toward the American camp to deliver her tidings.  \"It was still quite early, but before reaching the camp she met an American officer, Lieutenant Craig, whom Washington had sent out to seek information in regard to the doings of the enemy.  \"Lydia quickly told him her story, then hastened back to the mill for her bag of flour and hurried home with it.\"  \"Mamma,\" exclaimed Walter, \"how could she carry anything so big and heavy?\"  \"Perhaps it was but a small bag,\" returned his mother, with a smile. \"I never saw or read any statement as to its size, and perhaps the joy and thankfulness she felt in having been permitted and enabled to do such service to the cause of her country may have helped to strengthen her to bear the burden.\"  \"What a day it must have been to her!\" exclaimed Evelyn, \"hope and fear alternating in her breast; and how her heart must have gone up constantly in prayer to God for his blessing upon her bleeding country.\"  \"And how it must have throbbed with alternating hope and fear as she stood at the window that cold, starry night and watched the departure of the British troops to make the intended attack upon Washington and his little army,\" said Rosie. \"And again when the distant roll of a drum told that they were returning.\"  \"Yes,\" said Lulu; \"and when the adjutant-general came back to the house, summoned Lydia to his room, and when he got her in there shut and locked the door.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Grace, \"did he know it was she that had told of his plans?\"  \"No,\" said Mrs. Travilla; \"from the accounts I have read he does not seem to have even suspected her. He invited her to be seated, then asked, 'Were any of your family up, Lydia, on the night when I received company in this house?' 'No,' she replied; 'they all retired at eight o'clock.' 'It is very strange,' he returned. 'You I know were asleep, for I knocked at your door three times before you heard me, yet it is certain we were betrayed. I am altogether at a loss to conceive who could have given information to Washington of our intended attack. On arriving near his camp, we found his cannon mounted, his troops under arms, and so prepared at every point to receive us, that we have been compelled to march back like a parcel of fools, without injuring our enemy!'\"  \"I hope the British did not find out, before they left Philadelphia, who had given the information to the Americans, and take vengeance on her?\" said Walter.  \"No,\" replied his mother, \"fearing that, she had begged Lieutenant Craig to keep her secret; which he did; and so it has happened that her good deed finds no mention in the histories of that time and is recorded only by well authenticated tradition.\"  \"So all the Quakers were not Tories?\" remarked Walter in a satisfied yet half inquiring tone.  \"Oh, no indeed!\" replied his mother, \"there were ardent patriots among them, as among people of other denominations. Nathaniel Green--after Washington one of our best and greatest generals--was of Quaker family, and I have heard that when his mother found he was not to be persuaded to refrain from taking an active part in the struggle for freedom, she said to him, 'Well, Nathaniel, if thee must fight, let me never hear of thee having a wound in thy back!'\"  \"Ah, she must have been brave and patriotic,\" laughed Walter. \"I doubt if she was so very sorry that her son was determined to fight for the freedom of his country.\"  \"No,\" said Rosie, \"I don't believe she was, and I don't see how she could help feeling proud of him--so bright, brave, talented, and patriotic as he showed himself to be all through the war.\"  \"Yes,\" said Lulu, \"and I don't think he has had half the honors he deserved, though at West Point we saw a cannon with an inscription on it saying it had been taken from the British army and presented by Congress to Major-General Green as a monument of their high sense of his services in the revolutionary war.\"  \"Weren't the Tories very bad men, Grandma Elsie?\" asked Grace.  \"Not all of them, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Travilla, smiling lovingly into the sweet, though grave and earnest, little face; \"some were really conscientiously opposed to war, even when waged for freedom from unbearable tyranny and oppression, but were disposed to be merely inactive witnesses of the struggle, some of them desiring the success of the patriots, others that of the king's troops; then there was another set who, while professing neutrality, secretly aided the British, betraying the patriots into their hands.  \"Such were Carlisle and Roberts, Quakers of that time, living in Philadelphia. While the British were in possession of the city those two men were employed as secret agents in detecting foes to the government, and by their secret information caused many patriots to be arrested and thrown into prison. Lossing tells us that Carlisle, wearing the meek garb and deportment of a Quaker, was at heart a Torquemada.\"  \"And who was Torquemada, mamma?\" queried Walter.  \"A Dominican monk of Spain, who lived in the times of Ferdinand and Isabella, and was by them appointed inquisitor-general. He organized the Inquisition throughout Spain, drew up the code of procedure, and during sixteen years caused between nine and ten thousand persons to be burned at the stake.\"  \"Mamma! what a cruel, _cruel_ wretch!\" cried Walter. \"Oh, but I'm glad nobody can do such cruel things in these days! I hope Roberts and Carlisle weren't quite so wicked as he.\"  \"No, I should not like to think they would have been willing to go to quite such lengths, though they seem to have shown enough malignity toward their patriotic fellow-countrymen to make it evident that they had something of the spirit of the cruel and bloodthirsty Torquemada.  \"Though they would not bear arms for the wealth of the Indies, they were ever ready to act as guides to those whose object was to massacre their fellow-countrymen; and that only because they were determined to be free.\"  \"Were not some of those in New Jersey known as 'Pine Robbers,' Grandma Elsie?\" asked Evelyn.  \"Yes; they infested the lower part of Monmouth County, whence they went on predatory excursions into other parts of the State, coming upon the people at night to burn, murder, plunder, and destroy. They burrowed caves in the sandhills on the borders of the swamps, where they concealed themselves and their booty.\"  \"Did they leave their hiding-places only in the night time, mamma?\" asked Walter.  \"No,\" she replied, \"they would sometimes sally forth during the day and attack the farmers in their fields. So that the men were compelled to carry muskets and be ready to fight for their lives, while women and children were kept in a constant state of terror.\"  \"I think I have read that one of the worst of them was a blacksmith, living in Freehold?\" remarked Evelyn, half inquiringly.  \"Yes, his name was Fenton; he was a very wicked man, who, like many others calling themselves Tories, took advantage of the disturbance of the times to rob and murder his fellow-countrymen; he began his career of robbery and murder very early in the war.  \"One of his first acts, as such, was the plundering of a tailor's shop in the township. A committee of vigilance had been already organized, and its members sent Fenton word that if he did not return what he had stolen he should be hunted out and shot.  \"He was a coward, as such villains almost always are, and did return the clothing, sending with it a written message, 'I have returned your ---- rags. In a short time I am coming to burn your barns and houses, and roast you all like a pack of kittens.'  \"One summer night, shortly afterward, he led a gang of desperadoes like himself against the dwelling of an old man named Farr. There were but three persons in the house--the old man, his wife, and daughter. They barricaded their door and defended themselves for a while, but Fenton broke in a part of the door, fired through the hole at the old man and broke his leg. The women could not keep them out much longer; they soon forced an entrance, murdered the old man and woman, and badly wounded the daughter. She, however, made her escape, and the cowardly ruffians fled without waiting to secure any plunder; no doubt fearing she would bring a band of patriots to avenge the slain.\"  \"I hope that wretch, Fenton, was soon caught and well punished for his robberies and murders!\" exclaimed Lulu.  \"He was,\" replied Grandma Elsie. \"The Bible tells us that 'bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,' and Fenton's fate was one amongst many to prove the truth of it.  \"He had met a young man on his way to mill, plundered and beaten him; the victim carried his complaint to Lee, and a sergeant and two soldiers were detailed to capture or kill Fenton.  \"They used strategy and with success. The two soldiers were secreted under some straw in the bottom of a wagon, the sergeant disguised himself as a countryman, and the young man took a seat in the vehicle. Then they drove on toward the mill, expecting to meet Fenton on the road.

THE EAST RIVER DIVISION.  BY ALFRED NOBLE, PAST-PRESIDENT, AM. SOC. C. E.     A general outline of the work included in this Division has been given by General C. W. Raymond, M. Am. Soc. C. E., in the first paper of the series. The few pages following are intended only as a note to connect his paper with the more detailed descriptions of the execution of the work, which will be supplied by the Resident Engineers in immediate charge.  Soon after the Company's project was made public, in the latter part of 1901, borings were begun in the East River, and a few weeks later in Manhattan and Long Island City. A preliminary base line was measured on the Manhattan side, and temporary transit stations were established on buildings from which all borings in the river were located. The river borings were all wash-borings made from a pile-driver boat. After the results were plotted on the map, contour lines were drawn to indicate the rock surface, and profiles along the tunnel lines were plotted from the contours; as the borings were preliminary to the final location of the tunnels, and in many cases at some distance from the tunnel lines, considerable divergence from the actual rock surface was expected, and realized in a few places, yet on the whole the agreement was very good. The borings revealed two depressions or channels where the rock surface passed below the grade of the projected tunnels, these depressions being separated by a rock reef which extends down stream from Blackwell's Island. In 32d and 33d Streets in Manhattan, borings were made from the river to the station site at intervals of about 100 ft., wash-borings and core-borings alternating. In Long Island City, where the tunnel lines were to pass diagonally under the passenger station building and passenger yard of the Long Island Railroad and under streets and private property, the arrangement of borings was less regular, although the alternation of wash-borings and core-borings was carried out as far as practicable. After the final location of the work, additional borings were made, particularly on shaft sites and also along the approaches and in the Sunnyside Yard, Long Island City.  A triangulation was carried across the river with a measured base on each side. It was impossible to measure directly between the extremities of either base. The bases were measured with 100-ft. steel tapes, supported every 20 ft., stretched with a uniform pull, and frequently compared with standardized tapes. On account of the crowded condition of the streets during the hours of daylight and evening, most of the work was done between 10 P. M. and 5 A. M. Similar measurements were made in the streets along the tunnel lines. Angle readings were repeated many times, as is usual in such work. Fig. 1 shows the triangulation, the street measurements being omitted.  Levels were first transmitted across the river by simultaneous observations of the river surface; then by several repetitions, across Blackwell's Island and the narrow channels on each side, where the longest sights were about 1100 ft.; and, finally, by several lines through the tunnel of the East River Gas Company at 71st Street.  The franchise granted by the City of New York provided for the sale to the Railroad Company of the portions of 32d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Later, the Company acquired by purchase the portion of 32d Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues. The franchise granted sub-surface rights under streets around the station site to within 19 ft. of the street surface under Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Avenues; to within 30 in. of the street surface under 31st and 33d Streets, except that, under the sidewalks opposite the station, that is to say, the south sidewalk in 31st Street and the north sidewalk in 33d Street, the construction must be at least 5 ft. below the street surface. In carrying out the work, full use of these rights was made under Eighth Avenue, but only under such portions of Seventh and Ninth Avenues as were indispensable for access by trains to the station area. It was not practicable to make full use of the rights granted under 31st and 33d Streets without incurring great expense for supporting adjacent buildings or for injuries to them, and, after careful consideration, the arrangement shown in the plans was decided on, making about 45% of the sub-surface area under these streets available at track level.  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Triangulation System East River Tunnel]  The work of the East River Division at this site embraced the excavation to the depth necessary for railroad tracks, and the building of a retaining wall extending in 31st Street from the east side of Ninth Avenue to the west side of Seventh Avenue, thence northward along Seventh Avenue for a distance of 155.5 ft.; also a retaining wall in 33d Street from the west side of Seventh Avenue to the east side of Ninth Avenue, and thence southward along Ninth Avenue for a distance of 136.3 ft. This work was placed under contract June 21st, 1904, with the New York Contracting and Trucking Company, and later assigned by that company to the New York Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal, and was carried out under the direction of George C. Clarke, M. Am. Soc. C. E., as Resident Engineer, by whom it will be described in detail.  [Illustration: PLATE IX.--Map of Portion of Manhattan Island from 23d to 40th Streets, Showing Former Topography From Map Made by Gen. Egbert L. Viele in 1865]  The station tracks leading eastward from the station will converge under Seventh Avenue and for some distance farther east, and pass into two three-track tunnels, one under 32d Street and the other under 33d Street, at the respective distances of 192 and 402 ft. from Seventh Avenue. A typical cross-section of the three-track tunnel is shown on Plate XII. The converging sections were considered as easterly extensions of the station, and were not included in the East River Division. Within a few hundred feet (Plate XIV), the tracks are reduced to two, each passing into a single tube, the two tunnels under each street being formed in one excavation, the distance between center lines of tunnels being 20 ft. 4 in. This construction has been termed a twin tunnel, and a typical cross-section is shown on Plate XII. The tunnels continue on tangents under the streets to Second Avenue where they curve to the left by 1° 30' curves, passing under private property, gradually diverging and passing through shafts just east of First Avenue. About 350 ft. west of the shaft, the divergence of the two lines from each street becomes sufficient to leave a rock dividing wall between them, and thence eastward each tunnel is formed in a separate excavation. A typical cross-section of the two separated tunnels is shown on Plate XII.  It thus appears that eastward from the station the lines constitute a four-track railroad, each track being in a separate tunnel; for convenience of the work these lines were designated _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_, from north to south.  [Illustration: PLATE X.--Manhattan Shaft, Lines _A_ and _B_]  At an early date, when the organization of the engineering staff was taken up, Charles L. Harrison, M. Am. Soc. C. E., was appointed Principal Assistant Engineer. He was directly in charge of all parts of the work, and all Resident Engineers reported to him. George Leighton, M. Am. Soc. C. E., was placed in charge as Resident Engineer of the 33d Street lines from the west end of the three-track tunnel to the shaft and also eastward from the shaft under East River. As he was not then able to endure the effects of compressed air, the work under the river was transferred to James H. Brace, M. Am. Soc. C. E., as Resident Engineer. Before the completion of the land tunnels under 33d Street, Mr. Leighton accepted more responsible employment elsewhere, and Mr. Brace assumed charge of them also. Francis Mason, M. Am. Soc. C. E., was in charge as Resident Engineer of the 32d Street lines during their entire construction, and also of the tunnels extending these lines eastward from the First Avenue shaft under the river.  The work just described as the 32d and 33d Street lines, terminating at the easterly end at the First Avenue shafts, was placed under contract on May 29th, 1905, with the United Engineering and Contracting Company. The plans then provided for three-track tunnels from the west end of the work under the contract eastward 1,628 ft. in 32d Street and 1,418 ft. in 33d Street to the west line of Fifth Avenue, with a descending grade of 0.4%; this was to constitute, in a degree, an extension of the station, where trains could stand without brakes while awaiting signals to proceed to or from the station. From Fifth Avenue eastward to the lowest point under the river, the grade was to be 1.5% on all lines. Later, during construction, when excavating westward under 33d Street from Fifth Avenue, the surface of the rock was broken through, disclosing quicksand; within the next few days trial drill holes through the tunnel roof at 32d Street and Fifth Avenue showed a thin cover with quicksand above it. The conditions had been indicated in a general way by borings made before construction was begun, but they proved to be rather worse than anticipated. On the topographical map of Manhattan Island, made by General Egbert L. Viele in 1865, is shown a watercourse which had its source near what is now Broadway and 44th Street, flowing thence along the west side and south end of Murray Hill, passing under the present site of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, crossing 33d Street at the point where the rock surface was broken through in the tunnel excavation, as above stated, crossing 32d Street at its intersection with Fifth Avenue, where trial drilling showed thin rock"]]]
