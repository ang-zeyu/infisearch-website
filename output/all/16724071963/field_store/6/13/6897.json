I have made a mistake, this is not my room,\" said Schaunard.  \"Sir,\" added Colline and Rodolphe, simultaneously, addressing the person who had opened the door, \"be good enough to excuse our friend, he is as drunk as three fiddlers.\"  Suddenly a gleam of lucidity flashed through Schaunard's intoxication, he read on his door these words written in chalk:       \"I have called three times for my New Year's gift--PHEMIE.\"  \"But it is all right, it is all right, I am indeed at home,\" he exclaimed, \"here is the visiting card Phemie left me on New Year's Day; it is really my door.\"  \"Good heavens, sir,\" said Rodolphe, \"I am truly bewildered.\"  \"Believe me, sir,\" added Colline, \"that for my part, I am an active partner in my friend's confusion.\"  The young fellow who had opened the door could not help laughing.  \"If you come into my room for a moment,\" he replied, \"no doubt your friend, as soon as he has looked around, will see his mistake.\"  \"Willingly.\"  And the poet and philosopher each taking Schaunard by an arm, led him into the room, or rather the palace of Marcel, whom no doubt our readers have recognized.  Schaunard cast his eyes vaguely around him, murmuring, \"It is astonishing how my dwelling is embellished!\"  \"Well, are you satisfied now?\" asked Colline.  But Schaunard having noticed the piano had gone to it, and was playing scales.  \"Here, you fellows, listen to this,\" said he, striking the notes, \"this is something like, the animal has recognized his master,_ si la sol, fa mi re._ Ah! wretched re, you are always the same. I told you it was my instrument.\"  \"He insists on it,\" said Colline to Rodolphe.  \"He insists on it,\" repeated Rodolphe to Marcel.  \"And that,\" added Schaunard, pointing to the star-adorned petticoat that was lying on a chair, \"it is not an adornment of mine, perhaps? Ah!\"  And he looked Marcel straight in the face.  \"And this,\" continued he, unfastening from the wall the notice to quit already spoken of.  And he began to read, \"Therefore Monsieur Schaunard is hereby required to give up possession of the said premises, and to leave them in tenantable repair, before noon on the eighth day of April. As witness the present formal notice to quit, the cost of which is five francs.\" \"Ha! ha! so I am not the Monsieur Schaunard to whom formal notice to quit is given at a cost of five francs? And these, again,\" he continued, recognizing his slippers on Marcel's feet, \"are not those my papouches, the gift of a beloved hand? It is your turn, sir,\" said he to Marcel, \"to explain your presence amongst my household goods.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" replied Marcel, addressing himself more especially to Colline and Rodolphe, \"this gentleman,\" and he pointed to Schaunard, \"is at home, I admit.\"  \"Ah!\" exclaimed Schaunard, \"that's lucky.\"  \"But,\" continued Marcel, \"I am at home too.\"  \"But, sir,\" broke in Rodolphe, \"if our friend recognizes--\"  \"Yes,\" said Colline, \"if our friend--\"  \"And if on your side you recall that--,\" added Rodolphe, \"how is it that--\"  \"Yes,\" replied his echo Colline, \"how is it that--\"  \"Have the kindness to sit down, gentlemen,\" replied Marcel, \"and I will explain the mystery to you.\"  \"If we were to liquify the explanation?\" risked Colline.  \"Over a mouthful of something,\" added Rodolphe.  The four young fellows sat down to table and attacked a piece of cold veal which the wine-shop keeper had let them have.  Marcel then explained what had taken place in the morning between himself and the landlord when he had come to move in.  \"Then,\" observed Rodolphe, \"this gentleman is quite right, and we are in his place?\"  \"You are at home,\" said Marcel politely.  But it was a tremendous task to make Schaunard understand what had taken place. A comical incident served to further complicate the situation. Schaunard, when looking for something in a sideboard, found the change of the five hundred franc note that Marcel had handed to Monsieur Bernard that morning.  \"Ah! I was quite sure,\" he exclaimed, \"that Fortune would not desert me. I remember now that I went out this morning to run after her. On account of its being quarter-day she must have looked in during my absence. We crossed one another on the way, that it is. How right I was to leave the key in my drawer!\"  \"Delightful madness!\" murmured Rodolphe, looking at Schaunard, who was building up the money in equal piles.  \"A dream, a falsehood, such is life,\" added the philosopher.  Marcel laughed.  An hour later they had all four fallen asleep.  The next day they woke up at noon, and at first seemed very much surprised to find themselves together. Schaunard, Colline, and Rodolphe did not appear to recognize one another, and addressed one another as \"sir.\" Marcel had to remind them that they had come together the evening before.  At that moment old Durand entered the room.  \"Sir,\" said he to Marcel, \"it is the month of April, eighteen hundred and forty, there is mud in the streets, and His Majesty Louis-Philippe is still King of France and Navarre. What!\" exclaimed the porter on seeing his former tenant, \"Monsieur Schaunard, how did you come here?\"  \"By the telegraph,\" replied Schaunard.  \"Ah!\" replied the porter, \"you are still a joker--\"  \"Durand,\" said Marcel, \"I do not like subordinates mingling in conversation with me, go to the nearest restaurant and have a breakfast for four sent up. Here is the bill of fare,\" he added, handing him a slip of paper on which he had written it. \"Go.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" continued Marcel, addressing the three young fellows, \"you invited me to supper last night, allow me to offer you a breakfast this morning, not in my room, but in ours,\" he added, holding out his hand to Schaunard.  \"Oh! no,\" said Schaunard sentimentally, \"let us never leave one another.\"  \"That's right, we are very comfortable here,\" added Colline.  \"To leave you for a moment,\" continued Rodolphe. \"Tomorrow the 'Scarf of Iris,' a fashion paper of which I am editor, appears, and I must go and correct my proofs; I will be back in an hour.\"  \"The deuce!\" said Colline, \"that reminds me that I have a lesson to give to an Indian prince who has come to Paris to learn Arabic.\"  \"Go tomorrow,\" said Marcel.  \"Oh, no!\" said the philosopher, \"the prince is to pay me today. And then I must acknowledge to you that this auspicious day would be spoilt for me if I did not take a stroll amongst the bookstalls.\"  \"But will you come back?\" said Schaunard.  \"With the swiftness of an arrow launched by a steady hand,\" replied the philosopher, who loved eccentric imagery.  And he went out with Rodolphe.  \"In point of fact,\" said Schaunard when left alone with Marcel, \"instead of lolling on the sybarite's pillow, suppose I was to go out to seek some gold to appease the cupidity of Monsieur Bernard?\"  \"Then,\" said Marcel uneasily, \"you still mean to move?\"  \"Hang it,\" replied Schaunard, \"I must, since I have received a formal notice to quit, at a cost of five francs.\"  \"But,\" said Marcel, \"if you move, shall you take your furniture with you?\"  \"I have that idea. I will not leave a hair, as Monsieur Bernard says.\"  \"The deuce! That will be very awkward for me,\" said Marcel, \"since I have hired your room furnished.\"  \"There now, that's so,\" replied Schaunard. \"Ah! bah,\" he added in a melancholy tone, \"there is nothing to prove that I shall find my thousand francs today, tomorrow, or even later on.\"  \"Stop a bit,\" exclaimed Marcel, \"I have an idea.\"  \"Unfold it.\"  \"This is the state of things. Legally, this lodging is mine, since I have paid a month in advance.\"  \"The lodging, yes, but as to the furniture, if I pay, I can legally take it away, and if it were possible I would even take it away illegally.\"  \"So that,\" continued Marcel, \"you have furniture and no lodging, and I have lodging and no furniture.\"  \"That is the position,\" observed Schaunard.  \"This lodging suits me,\" said Marcel.  \"And for my part is has never suited me better,\" said Schaunard.  \"Well then, we can settle this business,\" resumed Marcel, \"stay with me, I will apply house-room, and you shall supply the furniture.\"  \"And the rent?\" said Schaunard.  \"Since I have some money just now I will pay it, it will be your turn next time. Think about it.\"  \"I never think about anything, above all accepting a suggestion which suits me. Carried unanimously, in point of fact, Painting and Music are sisters.\"  \"Sisters-in-law,\" observed Marcel.  At that moment Colline and Rodolphe, who had met one another, came in.  Marcel and Schaunard informed them of their partnership.  \"Gentlemen,\" said Rodolphe, tapping his waistcoat pocket, \"I am ready to stand dinner all round.\"  \"That is just what I was going to have the honour of proposing,\" said Colline, taking out a gold coin which he stuck in his eye like a glass. \"My prince gave me this to buy an Arabic grammar, which I have just paid six sous ready cash for.\"  \"I,\" said Rodolphe, \"have got the cashier of the 'Scarf of Iris' to advance me thirty francs under the pretext that I wanted it to get vaccinated.\"  \"It is general pay-day then?\" said Schaunard, \"there is only myself unable to stand anything. It is humiliating.\"  \"Meanwhile,\" said Rodolphe, \"I maintain my offer of a dinner.\"  \"So do I,\" said Colline.  \"Very well,\" said Rodolphe, \"we will toss up which shall settle the bill.\"  \"No,\" said Schaunard, \"I have something far better than that to offer you as a way of getting over the difficulty.\"  \"Let us have it.\"  \"Rodolphe shall pay for dinner, and Colline shall stand supper.\"  \"That is what I call Solomonic jurisprudence,\" exclaimed the philosopher.  \"It is worse than Camacho's wedding,\" added Marcel.  The dinner took place at a Provencal restaurant in the Rue Dauphine, celebrated for its literary waiters and its \"Ayoli.\" As it was necessary to leave room for the supper, they ate and drank in moderation. The acquaintance, begun the evening before between Colline and Schaunard and later on with Marcel, became more intimate; each of the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],["title","Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#8)"],["body","fellows hoisted the flag of his artistic opinions, and all four recognized that they had like courage and similar hopes. Talking and arguing they perceived that their sympathies were akin, that they had all the same knack in that chaff which amuses without hurting, and that the virtues of youth had not left a vacant spot in their heart, easily stirred by the sight of the narration of anything noble. All four starting from the same mark to reach the same goal, they thought that there was something more than chance in their meeting, and that it might after all be Providence who thus joined their hands and whispered in their ears the evangelic motto, which should be the sole charter of humanity, \"Love one another.\"  At the end of the repast, which closed in somewhat grave mood, Rodolphe rose to propose a toast to the future, and Colline replied in a short speech that was not taken from any book, had no pretension to style, and was merely couched in the good old dialect of simplicity, making that which is so badly delivered so well understood.  \"What a donkey this philosopher is!\" murmured Schaunard, whose face was buried in his glass, \"here is he obliging me to put water in my wine.\"  After dinner they went to take coffee at the Cafe Momus, where they had already spent the preceding evening. It was from that day that the establishment in question became uninhabitable by its other frequenters.  After coffee and nips of liqueurs the Bohemian clan, definitely founded, returned to Marcel's lodging, which took the name of Schaunard's Elysium. Whilst Colline went to order the supper he had promised, the others bought squibs, crackers and other pyrotechnic materials, and before sitting down to table they let off from the windows a magnificent display of fireworks which turned the whole house topsy-turvey, and during which the four friends shouted at the top of their voices--      \"Let us celebrate this happy day.\"  The next morning they again found themselves all four together but without seeming astonished this time. Before each going about his business they went together and breakfasted frugally at the Cafe Momus, where they made an appointment for the evening and where for a long time they were seen to return daily.  Such are the chief personages who will reappear in the episodes of which this volume is made up, a volume which is not a romance and has no other pretension than that set forth on its title-page, for the \"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter\" is only a series of social studies, the heroes of which belong to a class badly judged till now, whose greatest crime is lack of order, and who can even plead in excuse that this very lack of order is a necessity of the life they lead.     CHAPTER II  A GOOD ANGEL   Schaunard and Marcel, who had been grinding away valiantly a whole morning, suddenly struck work.  \"Thunder and lightning! I'm hungry!\" cried Schaunard. And he added carelessly, \"Do we breakfast today?\"  Marcel appeared much astonished at this very inopportune question.  \"How long has it been the fashion to breakfast two days running?\" he asked. \"And yesterday was Thursday.\" He finished his reply by tracing with his mahl-stick the ecclesiastic ordinance:      \"On Friday eat no meat,      Nor aught resembling it.\"  Schaunard, finding no answer, returned to his picture, which represented a plain inhabited by a red tree and a blue tree shaking branches; an evident allusion to the sweets of friendship, which had a very philosophical effect.  At this moment the porter knocked; he had brought a letter for Marcel.  \"Three sous,\" said he.  \"You are sure?\" replied the artist. \"Very well, you can owe it to us.\"  He shut the door in the man's face, and opened the letter. At the first line, he began to vault around the room like a rope-dancer and thundered out, at the top of his voice, this romantic ditty, which indicated with him the highest pitch of ecstasy:      \"There were four juveniles in our street;      They fell so sick they could not eat;      They carried them to the hospital!--      Tal! Tal! Tal! Tal!\"  \"Oh yes!\" said Schaunard, taking him up:      \"They put all four into one big bed,      Two at the feet and two at the head.\"  \"Think I don't know it?\" Marcel continued:      \"There came a sister of Charity--      Ty! Ty! tee! tee!\"  \"If you don't stop,\" said Schaunard, who suspected signs of mental alienation, \"I'll play the allegro of my symphony on 'The Influence of Blue in the Arts.'\" So saying, he approached the piano.  This menace had the effect of a drop of cold water in a boiling fluid. Marcel grew calm as if by magic. \"Look there!\" said he, passing the letter to his friend. It was an invitation to dine with a deputy, an enlightened patron of the arts in general and Marcel in particular, since the latter had taken the portrait of his country-house.  \"For today,\" sighed Schaunard. \"Unluckily the ticket is not good for two. But stay! Now I think of it, your deputy is of the government party; you cannot, you must not accept. Your principles will not permit you to partake of the bread which has been watered by the tears of the people.\"  \"Bah!\" replied Marcel, \"my deputy is a moderate radical; he voted against the government the other day. Besides, he is going to get me an order, and he has promised to introduce me in society. Moreover, this may be Friday as much as it likes; I am famished as Ugolino, and I mean to dine today. There now!\"  \"There are other difficulties,\" continued Schaunard, who could not help being a little jealous of the good fortune that had fallen to his friend's lot. \"You can't dine out in a red flannel shirt and slippers.\"  \"I shall borrow clothes of Rodolphe or Colline.\"  \"Infatuated youth! Do you forget that this is the twentieth, and at this time of the month their wardrobe is up to the very top of the spout?\"  \"Between now and five o'clock this evening I shall find a dress-coat.\"  \"I took three weeks to get one when I went to my cousin's wedding and that was in January.\"  \"Well, then, I shall go as I am,\" said Marcel, with a theatrical stride. \"It shall certainly never be said that a miserable question of etiquette hindered me from making my first step in society.\"  \"Without boots,\" suggested his friend.  Marcel rushed out in a state of agitation impossible to describe. At the end of two hours he returned, loaded with a false collar.  \"Hardly worth while to run so far for that,\" said Schaunard. \"There was paper enough to make a dozen.\"  \"But,\" cried Marcel, tearing his hair, \"we must have some things--confound it!\" And he commenced a thorough investigation of every corner of the two rooms. After an hour's search, he realized a costume thus composed:  A pair of plaid trousers, a gray hat, a red cravat, a blue waistcoat, two boots, one black glove, and one glove that had been white.  \"That will make two black gloves on a pinch,\" said Schaunard. \"You are going to look like the solar spectrum in that dress. To be sure, a colourist such as you are--\"  Marcel was trying the boots. Alas! They are both for the same foot! The artist, in despair, perceived an old boot in a corner which had served as the receptacle of their empty bladders. He seized upon it.  \"From Garrick to Syllable,\" said his jesting comrade, \"one square-toed and the other round.\"  \"I am going to varnish them and it won't show.\"  \"A good idea! Now you only want the dress-coat.\"  \"Oh!\" cried Marcel, biting his fists:      \"To have one would I give ten years of life,      And this right hand, I tell thee.\"  They heard another knock at the door. Marcel opened it.  \"Monsieur Schaunard?\" inquired a stranger, halting on the threshold.  \"At your service,\" replied the painter, inviting him in.  The stranger had one of those honest faces which typify the provincial.  \"Sir,\" said he. \"My cousin has often spoke to me of your talent for portrait painting, and being on the point of making a voyage to the colonies, whither I am deputed by the sugar refiners of the city of Nantes, I wish to leave my family something to remember me by. That is why I am come to see you.\"  \"Holy Providence!\" ejaculated Schaunard. \"Marcel, a seat for Monsieur--\"  \"Blancheron,\" said the new-comer, \"Blancheron of Nantes, delegate of the sugar interest, Ex-Mayor, Captain of the National Guard, and author of a pamphlet on the sugar question.\"  \"I am highly honoured at having been chosen by you,\" said the artist, with a low reverence to the delegate of the refiners. \"How do you wish to have your portrait taken?\"  \"In miniature,\" replied Blancheron, \"like that,\" and he pointed to a portrait in oil, for the delegate was one of that class with whom everything smaller than the side of a house is miniature. Schaunard had the measure of his man immediately, especially when the other added that he wished to be painted with the best colours.  \"I never use any other,\" said the artist. \"How large do you wish it to be?\"  \"About so big,\" answered the other, pointing to a kit-cat. \"How much will it be?\"  \"Sixty francs with the hands, fifty without.\"  \"The deuce it will! My cousin talked of thirty francs.\"  \"It depends on the season. Colours are much dearer at some times of the year than at others.\"  \"Bless me! It's just like sugar!\"  \"Precisely.\"  \"Fifty francs then be it.\"  \"You are wrong there; for ten francs more you will have your hands, and I will put in them your pamphlet on the sugar question, which will have a very good effect.\"  \"By Jove, you are right!\"  \"Thunder and lightning!\" said Schaunard to himself, \"if he goes on so, I shall burst, and hurt him with one of the pieces.\"  \"Did you see?\" whispered Marcel.  \"What?\"  \"He has a black coat.\"  \"I take. Let me manage.\"  \"Well,\" quoth the delegate, \"when do we begin? There is no time to lose, for I sail soon.\"  \"I have to take a little trip myself the day after tomorrow; so, if you please, we will begin at once. One good sitting will help us along some way.\"  \"But it will soon be night, and you can't paint by"]]]
