Little Fuzzy had gotten hold of the chain of his whistle and was trying to find out what was on the other end. \"Bet they're a lot of company for you.\"  \"You just get acquainted with them. Make yourselves at home; I'll go rustle up some refreshments.\"  While he was in the kitchen, filling a soda siphon and getting ice out of the refrigerator, a police whistle began shrilling in the living room. He was opening a bottle of whisky when Little Fuzzy came dashing out, blowing on it, a couple more of the family pursuing him and trying to get it away from him. He opened a tin of Extee Three for the Fuzzies, as he did, another whistle in the living room began blowing.  \"We have a whole shoebox full of them at the post,\" Lunt yelled to him above the din. \"We'll just write these two off as expended in service.\"  \"Well, that's real nice of you, George. I want to tell you that the Fuzzies appreciate that. Ahmed, suppose you do the bartending while I give the kids their candy.\"  By the time Khadra had the drinks mixed and he had distributed the Extee Three to the Fuzzies, Lunt had gotten into the easy chair, and the Fuzzies were sitting on the floor in front of him, still looking him over curiously. At least the Extee Three had taken their minds off the whistles for a while.  \"What I want to know, Jack, is where they came from,\" Lunt said, taking his drink. \"I've been up here for five years, and I never saw anything like them before.\"  \"I've been here five years longer, and I never saw them before, either. I think they came down from the north, from the country between the Cordilleras and the West Coast Range. Outside of an air survey at ten thousand feet and a few spot landings here and there, none of that country has been explored. For all anybody knows, it could be full of Fuzzies.\"  He began with his first encounter with Little Fuzzy, and by the time he had gotten as far as the wood chisel and the killing of the land-prawn, Lunt and Khadra were looking at each other in amazement.  \"That's it!\" Khadra said. \"I've found prawn-shells cracked open and the meat picked out, just the way you describe it. I always wondered what did that. But they don't all have wood chisels. What do you suppose they used ordinarily?\"  \"Ah!\" He pulled the drawer open and began getting things out. \"Here's the one Little Fuzzy discarded when he found my chisel. The rest of this stuff the others brought in when they came.\"  Lunt and Khadra rose and came over to look at the things. Lunt tried to argue that the Fuzzies couldn't have made that stuff. He wasn't even able to convince himself. Having finished their Extee Three, the Fuzzies were looking expectantly at the viewscreen, and it occurred to him that none of them except Little Fuzzy had ever seen it on. Then Little Fuzzy jumped up on the chair Lunt had vacated, reached over to the control-panel and switched it on. What he got was an empty stretch of moonlit plain to the south, from a pickup on one of the steel towers the veldbeest herders used. That wasn't very interesting; he twiddled the selector and finally got a night soccer game at Mallorysport. That was just fine; he jumped down and joined the others in front of the screen.  \"I've seen Terran monkeys and Freyan Kholphs that liked to watch screens and could turn them on and work the selector,\" Lunt said. It sounded like the token last salvo before the surrender.  \"Kholphs are smart,\" Khadra agreed. \"They use tools.\"  \"Do they make tools? Or tools to make tools with, like that saw?\" There was no argument on that. \"No. Nobody does that except people like us and the Fuzzies.\"  It was the first time he had come right out and said that; the first time he had even consciously thought it. He realized that he had been convinced of it all along, though. It startled the constabulary lieutenant and trooper.  \"You mean you think--?\" Lunt began.  \"They don't talk, and they don't build fires,\" Ahmed Khadra said, as though that settled it.  \"Ahmed, you know better than that. That talk-and-build-a-fire rule isn't any scientific test at all.\"  \"It's a legal test.\" Lunt supported his subordinate.  \"It's a rule-of-thumb that was set up so that settlers on new planets couldn't get away with murdering and enslaving the natives by claiming they thought they were only hunting and domesticating wild animals,\" he said. \"Anything that talks and builds a fire is a sapient being, yes. That's the law. But that doesn't mean that anything that doesn't isn't. I haven't seen any of this gang building fires, and as I don't want to come home sometime and find myself burned out, I'm not going to teach them. But I'm sure they have means of communication among themselves.\"  \"Has Ben Rainsford seen them yet?\" Lunt asked.  \"Ben's off on a trip somewhere. I called him as soon as Little Fuzzy, over there, showed up here. He won't be back till Friday.\"  \"Yes, that's right; I did know that.\" Lunt was still looking dubiously at the Fuzzies. \"I'd like to hear what he thinks about them.\"  If Ben said they were safe, Lunt would accept that. Ben was an expert, and Lunt respected expert testimony. Until then, he wasn't sure. He'd probably order a medical check-up for himself and Khadra the first thing tomorrow, to make sure they hadn't picked up some kind of bug.     IV   The Fuzzies took the manipulator quite calmly the next morning. That wasn't any horrible monster, that was just something Pappy Jack took rides in. He found one rather indifferent sunstone in the morning and two good ones in the afternoon. He came home early and found the family in the living room; they had dumped the wastebasket and were putting things back into it. Another land-prawn seemed to have gotten into the house; its picked shell was with the other rubbish in the basket. They had dinner early, and he loaded the lot of them into the airjeep and took them for a long ride to the south and west.  The following day, he located the flint vein on the other side of the gorge and spent most of the morning blasting away the sandstone above it. The next time he went into Mallorysport, he decided, he was going to shop around for a good power-shovel. He had to blast a channel to keep the little stream from damming up on him. He didn't get any flint cracked at all that day. There was another harpy circling around the camp when he got back; he chased it with the manipulator and shot it down with his pistol. Harpies probably found Fuzzies as tasty as Fuzzies found land-prawns. The family were all sitting under the gunrack when he entered the living room.  The next day he cracked flint, and found three more stones. It really looked as though he had found the Dying Place of the Jellyfish at that. He knocked off early that afternoon, and when he came in sight of the camp, he saw an airjeep grounded on the lawn and a small man with a red beard in a faded Khaki bush-jacket sitting on the bench by the kitchen door, surrounded by Fuzzies. There was a camera and some other equipment laid up where the Fuzzies couldn't get at it. Baby Fuzzy, of course, was sitting on his head. He looked up and waved, and then handed Baby to his mother and rose to his feet.  \"Well, what do you think of them, Ben?\" Jack called down, as he grounded the manipulator.  \"My God, don't start me on that now!\" Ben Rainsford replied, and then laughed. \"I stopped at the constabulary post on the way home. I thought George Lunt had turned into the biggest liar in the known galaxy. Then I went home, and found your call on the recorder, so I came over here.\"  \"Been waiting long?\"  The Fuzzies had all abandoned Rainsford and come trooping over as soon as the manipulator was off contragravity. He climbed down among them, and they followed him across the grass, catching at his trouser legs and yeeking happily.  \"Not so long.\" Rainsford looked at his watch. \"Good Lord, three and half hours is all. Well, the time passed quickly. You know, your little fellows have good ears. They heard you coming a long time before I did.\"  \"Did you see them killing any prawns?\"  \"I should say! I got a lot of movies of it.\" He shook his head slowly. \"Jack, this is almost incredible.\"  \"You're staying for dinner, of course?\"  \"You try and chase me away. I want to hear all about this. Want you to make a tape about them, if you're willing.\"  \"Glad to. We'll do that after we eat.\" He sat down on the bench, and the Fuzzies began climbing upon and beside him. \"This is the original, Little Fuzzy. He brought the rest in a couple of days later. Mamma Fuzzy, and Baby Fuzzy. And these are Mike and Mitzi. I call this one Ko-Ko, because of the ceremonious way he beheads land-prawns.\"  \"George says you call them all Fuzzies. Want that for the official designation?\"  \"Sure. That's what they are, isn't it?\"  \"Well, let's call the order Hollowayans,\" Rainsford said. \"Family, Fuzzies; genus, Fuzzy. Species, Holloway's Fuzzy--_Fuzzy fuzzy holloway_. How'll that be?\"  That would be all right, he supposed. At least, they didn't try to Latinize things in extraterrestrial zoology any more.  \"I suppose our bumper crop of land-prawns is what brought them into this section?\"  \"Yes, of course. George was telling me you thought they'd come down from the north; about the only place they could have come from. This is probably just the advance guard; we'll be having Fuzzies all over the place before long. I wonder how fast they breed.\"  \"Not very fast. Three males and two females in this crowd, and only one young one.\" He set Mike and Mitzi off his lap and got to his feet. \"I'll go start dinner now. While I'm doing that, you can look at the stuff they brought in with them.\"  When he had placed the dinner in the oven and taken a couple of highballs into the living room, Rainsford was still sitting at the desk, looking at the artifacts. He accepted his drink and sipped it absently, then raised his head.  \"Jack, this stuff is absolutely amazing,\" he said.  \"It's better than that. It's unique."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137"],["title","Little Fuzzy (#7)"],["body","collection of native weapons and implements on Zarathustra.\"  Ben Rainsford looked up sharply. \"You mean what I think you mean?\" he asked. \"Yes; you do.\" He drank some of his highball, set down the glass and picked up the polished-horn prawn-killer. \"Anything--pardon, anybody--who does this kind of work is good enough native for me.\" He hesitated briefly. \"Why, Jack this tape you said you'd make. Can I transmit a copy to Juan Jimenez? He's chief mammalogist with the Company science division; we exchange information. And there's another Company man I'd like to have hear it. Gerd van Riebeek. He's a general xeno-naturalist, like me, but he's especially interested in animal evolution.\"  \"Why not? The Fuzzies are a scientific discovery. Discoveries ought to be reported.\"  Little Fuzzy, Mike and Mitzi strolled in from the kitchen. Little Fuzzy jumped up on the armchair and switched on the viewscreen. Fiddling with the selector, he got the Big Blackwater woods-burning. Mike and Mitzi shrieked delightedly, like a couple of kids watching a horror show. They knew, by now, that nothing in the screen could get out and hurt them.  \"Would you mind if they came out here and saw the Fuzzies?\"  \"Why, the Fuzzies would love that. They like company.\"  Mamma and Baby and Ko-Ko came in, seemed to approve what was on the screen and sat down to watch it. When the bell on the stove rang, they all got up, and Ko-Ko jumped onto the chair and snapped the screen off. Ben Rainsford looked at him for a moment.  \"You know, I have married friends with children who have a hell of a time teaching eight-year-olds to turn off screens when they're through watching them,\" he commented.         *       *       *       *       *  It took an hour, after dinner, to get the whole story, from the first little yeek in the shower stall, on tape. When he had finished, Ben Rainsford made a few remarks and shut off the recorder, then looked at his watch.  \"Twenty hundred; it'll be seventeen hundred in Mallorysport,\" he said. \"I could catch Jimenez at Science Center if I called now. He usually works a little late.\"  \"Go ahead. Want to show him some Fuzzies?\" He moved his pistol and some other impedimenta off the table and set Little Fuzzy and Mamma Fuzzy and Baby upon it, then drew up a chair beside it, in range of the communication screen, and sat down with Mike and Mitzi and Ko-Ko. Rainsford punched out a wavelength combination. Then he picked up Baby Fuzzy and set him on his head.  In a moment, the screen flickered and cleared, and a young man looked out of it, with the momentary upward glance of one who wants to make sure his public face is on straight. It was a bland, tranquilized, life-adjusted, group-integrated sort of face--the face turned out in thousands of copies every year by the educational production lines on Terra.  \"Why, Bennett, this is a pleasant surprise,\" he began. \"I never expec--\" Then he choked; at least, he emitted a sound of surprise. \"What in the name of Dai-Butsu are those things on the table in front of you?\" he demanded. \"I never saw anything--_And what is that on your head?_\"  \"Family group of Fuzzies,\" Rainsford said. \"Mature male, mature female, immature male.\" He lifted Baby Fuzzy down and put him in Mamma's arms. \"Species _Fuzzy fuzzy holloway zarathustra_. The gentleman on my left is Jack Holloway, the sunstone operator, who is the original discoverer. Jack, Juan Jimenez.\"  They shook their own hands at one another in the ancient Terran-Chinese gesture that was used on communication screens, and assured each other--Jimenez rather absently--that it was a pleasure. He couldn't take his eyes off the Fuzzies.  \"Where did they come from?\" he wanted to know. \"Are you sure they're indigenous?\"  \"They're not quite up to spaceships, yet, Dr. Jimenez. Fairly early Paleolithic, I'd say.\"  Jimenez thought he was joking, and laughed. The sort of a laugh that could be turned on and off, like a light. Rainsford assured him that the Fuzzies were really indigenous.  \"We have everything that's known about them on tape,\" he said. \"About an hour of it. Can you take sixty-speed?\" He was making adjustments on the recorder as he spoke. \"All right, set and we'll transmit to you. And can you get hold of Gerd van Riebeek? I'd like him to hear it too; it's as much up his alley as anybody's.\"  When Jimenez was ready, Rainsford pressed the play-off button, and for a minute the recorder gave a high, wavering squeak. The Fuzzies all looked startled. Then it ended.  \"I think, when you hear this, that you and Gerd will both want to come out and see these little people. If you can, bring somebody who's a qualified psychologist, somebody capable of evaluating the Fuzzies' mentation. Jack wasn't kidding about early Paleolithic. If they're not sapient, they only miss it by about one atomic diameter.\"  Jimenez looked almost as startled as the Fuzzies had. \"You surely don't mean that?\" He looked from Rainsford to Jack Holloway and back. \"Well, I'll call you back, when we've both heard the tape. You're three time zones west of us, aren't you? Then we'll try to make it before your midnight--that'll be twenty-one hundred.\"  He called back half an hour short of that. This time, it was from the living room of an apartment instead of an office. There was a portable record player in the foreground and a low table with snacks and drinks, and two other people were with him. One was a man of about Jimenez's age with a good-humored, non-life-adjusted, non-group-integrated and slightly weather-beaten face. The other was a woman with glossy black hair and a Mona Lisa-ish smile. The Fuzzies had gotten sleepy, and had been bribed with Extee Three to stay up a little longer. Immediately, they registered interest. This was more fun than the viewscreen.  Jimenez introduced his companions as Gerd van Riebeek and Ruth Ortheris. \"Ruth is with Dr. Mallin's section; she's been working with the school department and the juvenile court. She can probably do as well with your Fuzzies as a regular xeno-psychologist.\"  \"Well, I have worked with extraterrestrials,\" the woman said. \"I've been on Loki and Thor and Shesha.\"  Jack nodded. \"Been on the same planets myself. Are you people coming out here?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" van Riebeek said. \"We'll be out by noon tomorrow. We may stay a couple of days, but that won't put you to any trouble; I have a boat that's big enough for the three of us to camp on. Now, how do we get to your place?\"  Jack told him, and gave map coordinates. Van Riebeek noted them down.  \"There's one thing, though, I'm going to have to get firm about. I don't want to have to speak about it again. These little people are to be treated with consideration, and not as laboratory animals. You will not hurt them, or annoy them, or force them to do anything they don't want to do.\"  \"We understand that. We won't do anything with the Fuzzies without your approval. Is there anything you'd want us to bring out?\"  \"Yes. A few things for the camp that I'm short of; I'll pay you for them when you get here. And about three cases of Extee Three. And some toys. Dr. Ortheris, you heard the tape, didn't you? Well, just think what you'd like to have if you were a Fuzzy, and bring it.\"     V   Victor Grego crushed out his cigarette slowly and deliberately.  \"Yes, Leonard,\" he said patiently. \"It's very interesting, and doubtless an important discovery, but I can't see why you're making such a production of it. Are you afraid I'll blame you for letting non-Company people beat you to it? Or do you merely suspect that anything Bennett Rainsford's mixed up in is necessarily a diabolical plot against the Company and, by consequence, human civilization?\"  Leonard Kellogg looked pained. \"What I was about to say, Victor, is that both Rainsford and this man Holloway seem convinced that these things they call Fuzzies aren't animals at all. They believe them to be sapient beings.\"  \"Well, that's--\" He bit that off short as the significance of what Kellogg had just said hit him. \"Good God, Leonard! I beg your pardon abjectly; I don't blame you for taking it seriously. Why, that would make Zarathustra a Class-IV inhabited planet.\"  \"For which the Company holds a Class-III charter,\" Kellogg added. \"For an uninhabited planet.\"  Automatically void if any race of sapient beings were discovered on Zarathustra.  \"You know what will happen if this is true?\"  \"Well, I should imagine the charter would have to be renegotiated, and now that the Colonial Office knows what sort of a planet this is, they'll be anything but generous with the Company....\"  \"They won't renegotiate anything, Leonard. The Federation government will simply take the position that the Company has already made an adequate return on the original investments, and they'll award us what we can show as in our actual possession--I hope--and throw the rest into the public domain.\"  The vast plains on Beta and Delta continents, with their herds of veldbeest--all open range, and every 'beest that didn't carry a Company brand a maverick. And all the untapped mineral wealth, and the untilled arable land; it would take years of litigation even to make the Company's claim to Big Blackwater stick. And Terra-Baldur-Marduk Spacelines would lose their monopolistic franchise and get sticky about it in the courts, and in any case, the Company's import-export monopoly would go out the airlock. And the squatters rushing in and swamping everything--  \"Why, we won't be any better off than the Yggdrasil Company, squatting on a guano heap on one continent!\" he burst out. \"Five years from now, they'll be making more money out of bat dung than we'll be making out of this whole world!\"  And the Company's good friend and substantial stockholder, Nick Emmert, would be out, too, and a Colonial Governor General would move in, with regular army troops and a complicated bureaucracy.
