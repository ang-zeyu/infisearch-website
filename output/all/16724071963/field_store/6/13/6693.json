SULTE:  A few years ago, when I was a resident of the Far West and tried to trace the paths of early explorers, I found that all authorities--first, second, and third rate--alike referred to one source of information for their facts.  The name in the tell-tale footnote was invariably your own.  While I assume _all_ responsibility for upsetting the apple cart of established opinions by this book, will you permit me to dedicate it to you as a slight token of esteem to the greatest living French-Canadian historian, from whom we have all borrowed and to whom few of us have rendered the tribute due?  Faithfully,  AGNES C. LAUT.    MR. BENJAMIN SULTE,  PRESIDENT ROYAL SOCIETY,  OTTAWA, CANADA.       THE GREAT NORTHWEST    I love thee, O thou great, wild, rugged land   Of fenceless field and snowy mountain height,   Uprearing crests all starry-diademed   Above the silver clouds!  A sea of light   Swims o'er thy prairies, shimmering to the sight   A rolling world of glossy yellow wheat   That runs before the wind in billows bright   As waves beneath the beat of unseen feet,   And ripples far as eye can see--as far and fleet!    Here's chances for every man!  The hands that work   Become the hands that rule!  Thy harvests yield   Only to him who toils; and hands that shirk   Must empty go!  And here the hands that wield   The sceptre work!  O glorious golden field!   O bounteous, plenteous land of poet's dream!   O'er thy broad plain the cloudless sun ne'er wheeled   But some dull heart was brightened by its gleam   To seize on hope and realize life's highest dream!    Thy roaring tempests sweep from out the north--   Ten thousand cohorts on the wind's wild mane--   No hand can check thy frost-steeds bursting forth   To gambol madly on the storm-swept plain!   Thy hissing snow-drifts wreathe their serpent train,   With stormy laughter shrieks the joy of might--   Or lifts, or falls, or wails upon the wane--   Thy tempests sweep their stormy trail of white   Across the deepening drifts--and man must die, or fight!    Yes, man must sink or fight, be strong or die!   That is thy law, O great, free, strenuous West!   The weak thou wilt make strong till he defy   Thy bufferings; but spacious prairie breast   Will never nourish weakling as its guest!   He must grow strong or die!  Thou givest all   An equal chance--to work, to do their best--   Free land, free hand--thy son must work or fall   Grow strong or die!  That message shrieks the storm-wind's call!    And so I love thee, great, free, rugged land   Of cloudless summer days, with west-wind croon,   And prairie flowers all dewy-diademed,   And twilights long, with blood-red, low-hung moon   And mountain peaks that glisten white each noon   Through purple haze that veils the western sky--   And well I know the meadow-lark's far rune   As up and down he lilts and circles high   And sings sheer joy--be strong, be free; be strong or die!     Foreword  The question will at once occur why no mention is made of Marquette and Jolliet and La Salle in a work on the pathfinders of the West.  The simple answer is--they were _not_ pathfinders.  Contrary to the notions imbibed at school, and repeated in all histories of the West, Marquette, Jolliet, and La Salle did not discover the vast region beyond the Great Lakes.  Twelve years before these explorers had thought of visiting the land which the French hunter designated as the _Pays d'en Haut_, the West had already been discovered by the most intrepid _voyageurs_ that France produced,--men whose wide-ranging explorations exceeded the achievements of Cartier and Champlain and La Salle put together.  It naturally rouses resentment to find that names revered for more than two centuries as the first explorers of the Great Northwest must give place to a name almost unknown.  It seems impossible that at this late date history should have to be rewritten.  Such is the fact _if we would have our history true_.  Not Marquette, Jolliet, and La Salle discovered the West, but two poor adventurers, who sacrificed all earthly possessions to the enthusiasm for discovery, and incurred such bitter hostility from the governments of France and England that their names have been hounded to infamy.  These were Sieur Pierre Esprit Radisson and Sieur Médard Chouart Groseillers, fur traders of Three Rivers, Quebec. [1]  The explanation of the long oblivion obscuring the fame of these two men is very simple.  Radisson and Groseillers defied, first New France, then Old France, and lastly England.  While on friendly terms with the church, they did not make their explorations subservient to the propagation of the faith.  In consequence, they were ignored by both Church and State.  The _Jesuit Relations_ repeatedly refer to two young Frenchmen who went beyond Lake Michigan to a \"Forked River\" (the Mississippi), among the Sioux and other Indian tribes that used coal for fire because wood did not grow large enough on the prairie. Contemporaneous documents mention the exploits of the young Frenchmen. The State Papers of the Marine Department, Paris, contain numerous references to Radisson and Groseillers.  But, then, the _Jesuit Relations_ were not accessible to scholars, let alone the general public, until the middle of the last century, when a limited edition was reprinted of the Cramoisy copies published at the time the priests sent their letters home to France.  The contemporaneous writings of Marie de l'Incarnation, the Abbé Belmont, and Dollier de Casson were not known outside the circle of French savants until still later; and it is only within recent years that the Archives of Paris have been searched for historical data.  Meantime, the historians of France and England, animated by the hostility of their respective governments, either slurred over the discoveries of Radisson and Groseillers entirely, or blackened their memories without the slightest regard to truth.  It would, in fact, take a large volume to contradict and disprove half the lies written of these two men.  Instead of consulting contemporaneous documents,--which would have entailed both cost and labor,--modern writers have, unfortunately, been satisfied to serve up a rehash of the detractions written by the old historians.  In 1885 came a discovery that punished such slovenly methods by practically wiping out the work of the pseudo-historians.  There was found in the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, and Hudson's Bay House, London, unmistakably authentic record of Radisson's voyages, written by himself.  The Prince Society of Boston printed two hundred and fifty copies of the collected Journals.  The Canadian Archives published the journals of the two last voyages.  Francis Parkman was too conscientious to ignore the importance of the find; but his history of the West was already written.  He made what reparation he could to Radisson's memory by appending a footnote to subsequent editions of two of his books, stating that Radisson and Groseillers' travels took them to the \"Forked River\" before 1660.  Some ten other lines are all that Mr. Parkman relates of Radisson; and the data for these brief references have evidently been drawn from Radisson's enemies, for the explorer is called \"a renegade.\"  It is necessary to state this, because some writers, whose zeal for criticism was much greater than their qualifications, wanted to know why any one should attempt to write Radisson's life when Parkman had already done so.  Radisson's life reads more like a second Robinson Crusoe than sober history.  For that reason I have put the corroborative evidence in footnotes, rather than cumber the movement of the main theme.  I am sorry to have loaded the opening parts with so many notes; but Radisson's voyages change the relative positions of the other explorers so radically that proofs must be given.  The footnotes are for the student and may be omitted by the general reader.  The study of Radisson arose from, using his later exploits on Hudson Bay as the subject of the novel, _Heralds of Empire_.  On the publication of that book, several letters came from the Western states asking how far I thought Radisson had gone beyond Lake Superior before he went to Hudson Bay.  Having in mind--I am sorry to say--mainly the early records of Radisson's enemies, I at first answered that I thought it very difficult to identify the discoverer's itinerary beyond the Great Lakes.  So many letters continued to come on the subject that I began to investigate contemporaneous documents.  The path followed by the explorer west of the Great Lakes--as given by Radisson himself--is here written.  Full corroboration of all that Radisson relates is to be found--as already stated--in chronicles written at the period of his life and in the State Papers.  Copies of these I have in my possession. Samples of the papers bearing on Radisson's times, copied from the Marine Archives, will be found in the Appendix.  One must either accept the explorer's word as conclusive,--even when he relates his own trickery,--or in rejecting his journal also reject as fictions the _Jesuit Relations_, the _Marine Archives_, _Dollier de Casson_, _Marie de l'Incarnation_, and the _Abbé Belmont_, which record the same events as Radisson.  In no case has reliance been placed on second-hand chronicles.  Oldmixon and Charlevoix must both have written "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18216"],["title","Pathfinders of the West (#1)"],["body","hearsay; therefore, though quoted in the footnotes, they are not given as conclusive proof.  The only means of identifying Radisson's routes are (1) by his descriptions of the countries, (2) his notes of the Indian tribes; so that personal knowledge of the territory is absolutely essential in following Radisson's narrative.  All the regions traversed by Radisson--the Ottawa, the St. Lawrence, the Great Lakes, Labrador, and the Great Northwest--I have visited, some of them many times, except the shores of Hudson Bay, and of that region I have some hundreds of photographs.  Material for the accounts of the other pathfinders of the West has been drawn directly from the different explorers' journals.  For historical matter I wish to express my indebtedness to Dr. N. E. Dionne of the Parliamentary Library, Quebec, whose splendid sketch of Radisson and Groseillers, read before the Royal Society of Canada, does much to redeem the memory of the discoverers from ignominy; to Dr. George Bryce of Winnipeg, whose investigation of Hudson's Bay Archives adds a new chapter to Radisson's life; to Mr. Benjamin Sulte of Ottawa, whose destructive criticism of inaccuracies in old and modern records has done so much to stop people writing history out of their heads and to put research on an honest basis; and to M. Edouard Richard for scholarly advice relating to the Marine Archives, which he has exploited so thoroughly.  For transcripts and archives now out of print, thanks are due Mr. L. P. Sylvain of the Parliamentary Library, Ottawa, the officials of the Archives Department, Ottawa, Mr. F. C. Wurtele of Quebec, Professor Andrew Baird of Winnipeg, Mr. Alfred Matthews of the Prince Society, Boston, the Hon. Jacob V. Brower and Mr. Warren Upham of St. Paul.  Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee of Ottawa was so good as to give me a reading of his exhaustive notes on La Vérendrye and of data found on the Radisson family.  To Mrs. Fred Paget of Ottawa, the daughter of a Hudson's Bay Company officer, and to Mr. and Mrs. C. C. Farr of the Northern Ottawa, I am indebted for interesting facts on life in the fur posts.  Miss Talbot of Winnipeg obtained from retired officers of the Hudson's Bay Company a most complete set of photographs relating to the fur trade.  To her and to those officers who loaned old heirlooms to be photographed, I beg to express my cordial appreciation.  And the thanks of all who write on the North are permanently due Mr. C. C. Chipman, Chief Commissioner of the Hudson's Bay Company, for unfailing courtesy in extending information.   WILDWOOD PLACE,  WASSAIC, N.Y.   [1] I of course refer to the West as beyond the Great Lakes; for Nicotet, in 1634, and two nameless Frenchmen--servants of Jean de Lauzon--in 1654, had been beyond the Sault.     Just as this volume was going to the printer, I received a copy of the very valuable Minnesota _Memoir_, Vol. VI, compiled by the Hon. J. V. Brower of St. Paul, to whom my thanks are due for this excellent contribution to Western annals.  It may be said that the authors of this volume have done more than any other writers to vindicate Radisson and Groseillers as explorers of the West.  The very differences of opinion over the regions visited establish the fact that Radisson _did_ explore parts of Minnesota.  I have purposely avoided trying to say _what_ parts of Minnesota he exploited, because, it seems to me, the controversy is futile.  Radisson's memory has been the subject of controversy from the time of his life.  The controversy--first between the governments of France and England, subsequently between the French and English historians--has eclipsed the real achievements of Radisson. To me it seems non-essential as to whether Radisson camped on an island in the Mississippi, or only visited the region of that island.  The fact remains that he discovered the Great Northwest, meaning by that the region west of the Mississippi.  The same dispute has obscured his explorations of Hudson Bay, French writers maintaining that he went overland to the North and put his feet in the waters of the bay, the English writers insisting that he only crossed over the watershed toward Hudson Bay.  Again, the fact remains that he did what others had failed to do--discovered an overland route to the bay.  I am sorry that Radisson is accused in this _Memoir_ of intentionally falsifying his relations in two respects, (1) in adding a fanciful year to the 1658-1660 voyage; (2) in saying that he had voyaged down the Mississippi to Mexico.  (1) Internal evidence plainly shows that Radisson's first four voyages were written twenty years afterward, when he was in London, and not while on the voyage across the Atlantic with Cartwright, the Boston commissioner.  It is the most natural thing in the world that Radisson, who had so often been to the wilds, should have mixed his dates.  Every slip as to dates is so easily checked by contemporaneous records--which, themselves, need to be checked--that it seems too bad to accuse Radisson of wilfully lying in the matter.  When Radisson lied it was to avoid bloodshed, and not to exalt himself.  If he had had glorification of self in mind, he would not have set down his own faults so unblushingly; for instance, where he deceives M. Colbert of Paris.  (2) Radisson does not try to give the impression that he went to Mexico.  The sense of the context is that he met an Indian tribe--Illinois, Mandans, Omahas, or some other--who lived next to another tribe who told _of_ the Spaniards.  I feel almost sure that the scholarly Mr. Benjamin Sulte is right in his letter to me when he suggests that Radisson's manuscript has been mixed by transposition of pages or paragraphs, rather than that Radisson himself was confused in his account.  At the same time every one of the contributors to the Minnesota _Memoir_ deserves the thanks of all who love _true_ history.     ADDENDUM  Since the above foreword was written, the contents of this volume have appeared serially in four New York magazines.  The context of the book was slightly abridged in these articles, so that a very vital distinction--namely, the difference between what is given as in dispute, and what is given as incontrovertible fact--was lost; but what was my amusement to receive letters from all parts of the West all but challenging me to a duel.  One wants to know \"how a reputable author dare\" suggest that Radisson's voyages be taken as authentic.  There is no \"dare\" about it.  It is a fact.  For any \"reputable\" historian to suggest--as two recently have--that Radisson's voyages are a fabrication, is to stamp that historian as a pretender who has not investigated a single record contemporaneous with Radisson's life.  One cannot consult documents contemporaneous with his life and not learn instantly that he was a very live fact of the most troublesome kind the governments of France and England ever had to accept.  That is why it impresses me as a presumption that is almost comical for any modern writer to condescend to say that he \"accepts\" or \"rejects\" this or that part of Radisson's record.  If he \"rejects\" Radisson, he also rejects the _Marine Archives of Paris_, and the _Jesuit Relations_, which are the recognized sources of our early history.  Another correspondent furiously denounces Radisson as a liar because he mixes his dates of the 1660 trip.  It would be just as reasonable to call La Salle a liar because there are discrepancies in the dates of his exploits, as to call Radisson a liar for the slips in his dates. When the mistakes can be checked from internal evidence, one is hardly justified in charging falsification.  A third correspondent is troubled by the reference to the Mascoutin Indians being _beyond_ the Mississippi.  State documents establish this fact.  I am not responsible for it; and Radisson could not circle west-northwest from the Mascoutins to the great encampments of the Sioux without going far west of the Mississippi.  Even if the Jesuits make a slip in referring to the Sioux's use of some kind of coal for fire because there was no wood on the prairie, and really mean turf or buffalo refuse,--which I have seen the Sioux use for fire,--the fact is that only the tribes far west of the Mississippi habitually used such substitutes for wood.  My Wisconsin correspondents I have offended by saying that Radisson went beyond the Wisconsin; my Minnesota friends, by saying that he went beyond Minnesota; and my Manitoba co-workers of past days, by suggesting that he ever went beyond Manitoba.  The fact remains that when we try to identify Radisson's voyages, we must take his own account of his journeyings; and that account establishes him as the Discoverer of the Northwest.  For those who know, I surely do not need to state that there is no picture of Radisson extant, and that some of the studies of his life are just as genuine (?) as alleged old prints of his likeness.
