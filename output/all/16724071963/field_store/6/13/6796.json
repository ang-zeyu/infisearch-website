Did I say, all? No; One was lame,     And could not dance the whole of the way;     And in after years, if you would blame     His sadness, he was used to say,--     \"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!     I can't forget that I'm bereft     Of all the pleasant sights they see,     Which the Piper also promised me.     For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,     Joining the town and just at hand,     Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,     And flowers put forth a fairer hue,     And everything was strange and new;     The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,     And their dogs outran our fallow deer,     And honey-bees had lost their stings,     And horses were born with eagles' wings;     And just as I became assured     My lame foot would be speedily cured,     The music stopped and I stood still,     And found myself outside the hill,     Left alone against my will,     To go now limping as before,     And never hear of that country more!\"   XIV.      Alas, alas for Hamelin!       There came into many a burgher's pate       A text which says that Heaven's gate       Opes to the rich at as easy rate     As the needle's eye takes a camel in!     The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,     To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,       Wherever it was men's lot to find him,     Silver and gold to his heart's content,     If he'd only return the way he went,       And bring the children behind him.     But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,     And Piper and dancers were gone for ever,     They made a decree that lawyers never       Should think their records dated duly     If, after the day of the month and year,     These words did not as well appear,     \"And so long after what happened here       On the Twenty-second of July,     Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:\"     And the better in memory to fix     The place of the children's last retreat,     They called it, the Pied Piper's Street--     Where any one playing on pipe or tabor,     Was sure for the future to lose his labour.     Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern       To shock with mirth a street so solemn;     But opposite the place of the cavern       They wrote the story on a column,     And on the great church-window painted     The same, to make the world acquainted     How their children were stolen away,     And there it stands to this very day.     And I must not omit to say     That in Transylvania there's a tribe     Of alien people that ascribe     The outlandish ways and dress     On which their neighbours lay such stress,     To their fathers and mothers having risen     Out of some subterraneous prison     Into which they were trepanned     Long time ago in a mighty band     Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,     But how or why, they don't understand.

And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,     If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!

What that famous blackbird-pie really cost--except in black-birds--is not disclosed, though the King seemed to show some anxiety about the state of his treasury, as he was discovered \"in his counting house\" imediately after the feast. But while the Queen, regardless of expense, regales herself on \"bread and honey\" in \"the parlour\", and her Maid-of-honour, or perhaps of-all-work, is engaged at the clothes-line, nothing is said about a princess.  No doubt there was a princess, and that Princess might have been PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE? Anyway here she is in the same boat--I mean book--and certainly her adventures are romantic enough to prevent any surprise at the company in which Her Highness now finds herself.  Even princesses cannot do without Alphabets, and so in her train comes AN ALPHABET in which will be discovered many OLD and tried FRIENDS of the Nursery.  Thus we launch another volume of our series, like a fairy ship with a rather mixed cargo, in the hope that--to change the metaphor--like the blackbird-pie, it may prove, when opened, to be \"a pretty dish to set before--\" their Babyships.

The King was in his counting-house,   Counting out his money.    The Queen was in the parlour,   Eating bread and honey.    The maid was in the garden,   Hanging out the clothes;    There came a little blackbird,   And nipp'd off her nose.   [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration] [Illustration]     PRINCESS BELLE-ETOILE.   Once upon a time there were three Princesses, named Roussette, Brunette, and Blondine, who lived in retirement with their mother, a Princess who had lost all her former grandeur. One day an old woman called and asked for a dinner, as this Princess was an excellent cook. After the meal was over, the old woman, who was a fairy, promised that their kindness should be rewarded, and immediately disappeared.  Shortly after, the King came that way, with his brother and the Lord Admiral. They were all so struck with the beauty of the three Princesses, that the King married the youngest, Blondine, his brother married Brunette, and the Lord Admiral married Roussette.  The good Fairy, who had brought all this about, also caused the young Queen Blondine to have three lovely children, two boys and a girl, out of whose hair fell fine jewels. Each had a brilliant star on the forehead, and a rich chain of gold around the neck. At the same time Brunette, her sister, gave birth to a handsome boy. Now the young Queen and Brunette were much attached to each other, but Roussette was jealous of both, and the old Queen, the King's mother, hated them. Brunette died soon after the birth of her son, and the King was absent on a warlike expedition, so Roussette joined the wicked old Queen in forming plans to injure Blondine. They ordered Feintise, the old Queen's waiting-woman, to strangle the Queen's three children and the son of Princess Brunette, and bury them secretly. But as she was about to execute this wicked order, she was so struck by their beauty, and the appearance of the sparkling stars on their foreheads, that she shrank from the deed.  [Illustration]  So she had a boat brought round to the beach, and put the four babes, with some strings of jewels, into a cradle, which she placed in the boat, and then set it adrift. The boat was soon far out at sea. The waves rose, the rain poured in torrents, and the thunder roared. Feintise could not doubt that the boat would be swamped, and felt relieved by the thought that the poor little innocents would perish, for she would otherwise always be haunted by the fear that something would occur to betray the share she had had in their preservation.  But the good Fairy protected them, and after floating at sea for seven days they were picked up by a Corsair. He was so struck by their beauty that he altered his course, and took them home to his wife, who had no children. She was transported with joy when he placed them in her hands. They admired together the wonderful stars, the chains of gold that could not be taken off their necks, and their long ringlets. Much greater was the woman's astonishment when she combed them, for at every instant there rolled out of their hair pearls, rubies, diamonds, and emeralds. She told her husband of it, who was not less surprised than herself.  \"I am very tired,\" said he, \"of a Corsair's life, and if the locks of those little children continue to supply us with such treasures, I will give up roaming the seas.\" The Corsair's wife, whose name was Corsine, was enchanted at this, and loved the four infants so much the more for it. She named the Princess, Belle-Etoile, her eldest brother, Petit-Soleil, the second, Heureux, and the son of Brunette, Cheri.  As they grew older, the Corsair applied himself seriously to their education, as he felt convinced there was some great mystery attached to their birth.  The Corsair and his wife had never told the story of the four children, who passed for their own. They were exceedingly united, but Prince Cheri entertained for Princess Belle-Etoile a greater affection than the other two. The moment she expressed a wish for anything, he would attempt even impossibilities to gratify her.  One day Belle-Etoile overheard the Corsair and his wife talking. \"When I fell in with them,\" said the Corsair, \"I saw nothing that could give me any idea of their birth.\" \"I suspect,\" said Corsine, \"that Cheri is not their brother, he has neither star nor neck-chain.\" Belle-Etoile immediately ran and told this to the three Princes, who resolved to speak to the Corsair and his wife, and ask them to let them set out to discover the secret of their birth. After some remonstrance they gained their consent. A beautiful vessel was prepared, and the young Princess and the three Princes set out. They determined to sail to the very spot where the Corsair had found them, and made preparations for a grand sacrifice to the fairies, for their protection and guidance. They were about to immolate a turtle-dove, but the Princess saved its life, and let it fly. At this moment a syren issued from the water, and said, \"Cease your anxiety, let your vessel go where it will; land where it stops.\" The vessel now sailed more quickly. Suddenly they came in sight of a city so beautiful that they were anxious their vessel should enter the port. Their wishes were accomplished; they landed, and the shore in a moment was crowded with people, who had observed the magnificence of their ship. They ran and told the King the news, and as the grand terrace of the Palace looked out upon the sea-shore, he speedily repaired thither. The Princes, hearing the people say, \"There is the King,\" looked up, and made a profound obeisance. He looked earnestly at them, and was as much charmed by the Princess's beauty, as by the handsome mien of the young Princes. He ordered his equerry to offer them his protection, and everything that they might require.  The King was so interested about these four children, that he went into the chamber of the Queen, his mother, to tell her of the wonderful stars which shone upon their foreheads, and everything that he admired in them. She was thunderstruck at it, and was terribly afraid that Feintise had betrayed her, and sent her secretary to enquire about them. What he told her of their ages confirmed her suspicions. She sent for Feintise, and threatened to kill her. Feintise, half dead with terror, confessed all; but promised, if she spared her, that she would still find means to do away with them. The Queen was appeased; and, indeed, old Feintise did all she could for her own sake. Taking a guitar, she went and sat down opposite the Princess's window, and sang a song which Belle-Etoile thought so pretty that she invited her into her chamber. \"My fair child,\" said Feintise, \"Heaven has made you very lovely, but you yet want one thing--the dancing-water. If I had possessed it, you would not have seen a white hair upon my head, nor a wrinkle on my face. Alas! I knew this secret too late; my charms had already faded.\" \"But where shall I find this dancing-water?\" asked Belle-Etoile. \"It is in the luminous forest,\" said Feintise. \"You have three brothers; does not any one of them love you sufficiently to go and fetch some?\" \"My brothers all love me,\" said the Princess, \"but there is one of them who would not refuse me anything.\" The perfidious old woman retired, delighted at having been so successful. The Princes, returning from the chase, found Belle-Etoile engrossed by the advice of Feintise. Her anxiety about it was so apparent, that Cheri, who thought of nothing but pleasing her, soon found out the cause of it, and, in spite of her entreaties, he mounted his white horse, and set out in search of the dancing-water.
