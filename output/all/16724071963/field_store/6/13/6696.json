Before the applause could cease or the councillors' ardor cool, the adopted brother sprang up, hatchet in hand, and sang of other victories.  Then, with a delicacy of etiquette which white pleaders do not always observe, father and son withdrew from the Council Lodge to let the jury deliberate.  The old sachems were disturbed.  They had been moved more than their wont.  Twenty withdrew to confer.  Dusk gathered deeper and deeper over the forests of the Mohawk Valley. Tawny faces came peering at the doors, waiting for the decision. Outsiders tore the skins from the walls of the lodge that they, too, might witness the memorable trial of the boy prisoner.  Sachem after sachem rose and spoke.  Tobacco was sacrificed to the fire-god.  Would the relatives of the dead Mohawks consider the wampum belts full compensation?  Could the Iroquois suffer a youth to live who had joined the murderers of the Mohawks?  Could the Mohawks afford to offend the great Iroquois chief who was the French youth's friend?  As they deliberated, the other councillors returned, accompanied by all the members of Radisson's friendly family.  Again the father sang and spoke.  This time when he finished, instead of sitting down, he caught the necklace of wampum from Radisson's neck, threw it at the feet of the oldest sachem, cut the captive's bonds, and, amid shouts of applause, set the white youth free.   One of the incomprehensible things to civilization is how a white man _can_ degenerate to savagery.  Young Radisson's life is an illustration.  In the first transports of his freedom, with the Mohawk women dancing and singing around him, the men shouting, he leaped up, oblivious of pain; but when the flush of ecstasy had passed, he sank to the mat of the Iroquois lodge, and he was unable to use his burned feet for more than a month.  During this time the Iroquois dressed his wounds, brought him the choice portions of the hunt, gave him clean clothing purchased at Orange (Albany), and attended to his wants as if he had been a prince.  No doubt the bright eyes of the swarthy young French boy moved to pity the hearts of the Mohawk mothers, and his courage had won him favor among the warriors.  He was treated like a king.  The women waited upon him like slaves, and the men gave him presents of firearms and ammunition--the Indian's most precious possessions.  Between flattered vanity and indolence, other white men, similarly treated, have lost their self-respect.  Beckworth, of the Missouri, became to all intents and purposes a savage; and Bird, of the Blackfeet, degenerated lower than the Indians.  Other Frenchmen captured from the St. Lawrence, and white women taken from the New England colonies, became so enamored of savage life that they refused to leave the Indian lodges when peace had liberated them.  Not so Radisson.  Though only seventeen, flattered vanity never caused him to forget the gratitude he owed the Mohawk family.  Though he relates his life with a frankness that leaves nothing untold, he never at any time returned treachery for kindness.  The very chivalry of the French nature endangered him all the more.  Would he forget his manhood, his birthright of a superior race, his inheritance of nobility from a family that stood foremost among the _noblesse_ of New France?  [Illustration: Albany, from an Old Print.]   The spring of 1653 came with unloosening of the rivers and stirring of the forest sap and fret of the warrior blood.  Radisson's Iroquois father held great feasts in which he heaved up the hatchet to break the kettle of sagamite against all enemies.  Would Radisson go on the war-path with the braves, or stay at home with the women and so lose the respect of the tribe?  In the hope of coming again within reach of Three Rivers, he offered to join the Iroquois in their wars.  The Mohawks were delighted with his spirit, but they feared to lose their young warrior.  Accepting his offer, they refused to let him accompany them to Quebec, but assigned him to a band of young braves, who were to raid the border-lands between the Huron country of the Upper Lakes and the St. Lawrence.  This was not what Radisson wanted, but he could not draw back.  There followed months of wild wanderings round the regions of Niagara.  The band of young braves passed dangerous places with great precipices and a waterfall, where the river was a mile wide and unfrozen.  Radisson was constrained to witness many acts against the Eries, which must have one of two effects on white blood,--either turn the white man into a complete savage, or disgust him utterly with savage life.  Leaving the Mohawk village amid a blare of guns and shouts, the young braves on their maiden venture passed successively through the lodges of Oneidas, Onondagas, Senecas, and Cayugas, where they were feasted almost to death by the Iroquois Confederacy.[11] Then they marched to the vast wilderness of snow-padded forests and heaped windfall between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.  Snow still lay in great drifts under the shadow of hemlock and spruce; and the braves skimmed forward winged with the noiseless speed of snow-shoes.  When the snow became too soft from thaw for snow-shoes, they paused to build themselves a skiff.  It was too early to peel the bark off the birch, so they made themselves a dugout of the walnut tree.  The wind changed from north to south, clearing the lakes of ice and filling the air with the earthy smells of up-bursting growth. \"There was such a thawing,\" writes Radisson, \"ye little brookes flowed like rivers, which made us embark to wander over that sweet sea.\" Lounging in their skiff all day, carried from shore to shore with the waves, and sleeping round camp-fires on the sand each night, the young braves luxuriated in all the delights of sunny idleness and spring life.  But this was not war.  It was play, and play of the sort that weans the white man from civilization to savagery.  One day a scout, who had climbed to the top of a tree, espied two strange squaws.  They were of a hostile tribe.  The Mohawk bloodthirst was up as a wolf's at the sight of lambs.  In vain Radisson tried to save the women by warning the Iroquois that if there were women, there must be men, too, who would exact vengeance for the squaws' death.  The young braves only laid their plans the more carefully for his warning and massacred the entire encampment.  Prisoners were taken, but when food became scarce they were brutally knocked on the head.  These tribes had never heard guns before, and at the sound of shots fled as from diabolical enemies.  It was an easy matter for the young braves in the course of a few weeks to take a score of scalps and a dozen prisoners.  At one place more than two hundred beaver were trapped.  At the end of the raid, the booty was equally divided.  Radisson asked that the woman prisoner be given to him; and he saved her from torture and death on the return to the Mohawks by presenting her as a slave to his Indian mother.  All his other share of booty he gave to the friendly family.  The raid was over.  He had failed of his main object in joining it.  He had not escaped.  But he had made one important gain.  His valor had reÃ«stablished the confidence of the Indians so that when they went on a free-booting expedition against the whites of the Dutch settlements at Orange (Albany), Radisson was taken with them. Orange, or Albany, consisted at that time of some fifty thatched log-houses surrounded by a settlement of perhaps a hundred and fifty farmers.  This raid was bloodless.  The warriors looted the farmers' cabins, emptied their cupboards, and drank their beer cellars dry to the last drop.  Once more Radisson kept his head.  While the braves entered Fort Orange roaring drunk, Radisson was alert and sober.  A drunk Indian falls an easy prey in the bartering of pelts.  The Iroquois wanted guns.  The Dutch wanted pelts.  The whites treated the savages like kings; and the Mohawks marched from house to house feasting of the best.  Radisson was dressed in garnished buckskin and had been painted like a Mohawk.  Suspecting some design to escape, his Iroquois friends never left him.  The young Frenchman now saw white men for the first time in almost two years; but the speech that he heard was in a strange tongue.  As Radisson went into the fort, he noticed a soldier among the Dutch.  At the same instant the soldier recognized him as a Frenchman, and oblivious of the Mohawks' presence blurted out his discovery in Iroquois dialect, vowing that for all the paint and grease, this youth was a white man below.  The fellow's blundering might have cost Radisson's life; but the youth had not been a captive among crafty Mohawks for nothing.  Radisson feigned surprise at the accusation.  That quieted the Mohawk suspicions and they were presently deep in the beer pots of the Dutch.  Again the soldier spoke, this time in French.  It was the first time that Radisson had heard his native tongue for months.  He answered in French.  At that the soldier emitted shouts of delight, for he, too, was French, and these strangers in an alien land threw their arms about each other like a pair of long-lost brothers with exclamations of joy too great for words.  [Illustration: The Battery, New York, in Radisson's Time.]  From that moment Radisson became the lion of Fort Orange.  The women dragged him to their houses and forced more dainties on him than he could eat.  He was conducted from house to house in triumph, to the amazed delight of the Indians.  The Dutch offered to ransom him at any price; but that would have exposed the Dutch settlement to the resentment of the Mohawks and placed Radisson under heavy obligation to people who were the enemies of New France.  Besides, his honor was pledged to return to his Indian"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18216"],["title","Pathfinders of the West (#7)"],["body","s; and it was a long way home to have to sail to Europe and back again to Quebec.  Perhaps, too, there was deep in his heart what he did not realize--a rooted love for the wilds that was to follow him all through life.  By the devious course of captivity, he had tasted of a new freedom and could not give it up. He declined the offer of the Dutch.  In two days he was back among the Mohawks ten times more a hero than he had ever been.  Mother and sisters were his slaves.  But between love of the wilds and love of barbarism is a wide difference.  He had not been back for two weeks when that glimpse of crude civilization at Orange recalled torturing memories of the French home in Three Rivers.  The filthy food, the smoky lodges, the cruelties of the Mohawks, filled him with loathing.  The nature of the white man, which had been hidden under the grease and paint of the savage--and in danger of total eclipse--now came upper-most.  With Radisson, to think was to act.  He determined to escape if it cost him his life.  Taking only a hatchet as if he were going to cut wood, Radisson left the Indian lodge early one morning in the fall of 1653.  Once out of sight from the village, he broke into a run, following the trail through the dense forests of the Mohawk Valley toward Fort Orange.  On and on he ran, all that day, without pause to rest or eat, without backward glance, with eye ever piercing through the long leafy vistas of the forest on the watch for the fresh-chipped bark of the trees that guided his course, or the narrow indurated path over the spongy mould worn by running warriors.  And when night filled the forest with the hoot of owl, and the far, weird cries of wild creatures on the rove, there sped through the aisled columns of star light and shadow, the ghostly figure of the French boy slim, and lithe as a willow, with muscles tense as ironwood, and step silent as the mountain-cat.  All that night he ran without a single stop.  Chill daybreak found him still staggering on, over rocks slippery with the night frost, over windfall tree on tree in a barricade, through brawling mountain brooks where his moccasins broke the skim of ice at the edge, past rivers where he half waded, half swam.  He was now faint from want of food; but fear spurred him on.  The morning air was so cold that he found it better to run than rest.  By four of the afternoon he came to a clearing in the forest, where was the cabin of a settler.  A man was chopping wood.  Radisson ascertained that there were no Iroquois in the cabin, and, hiding in it, persuaded the settler to carry a message to Fort Orange, two miles farther on.  While he waited Indians passed the cabin, singing and shouting.  The settler's wife concealed him behind sacks of wheat and put out all lights.  Within an hour came a rescue party from Orange, who conducted him safely to the fort.  For three days Radisson hid in Orange, while the Mohawks wandered through the fort, calling him by name.  Gifts of money from the Jesuit, Poncet, and from a Dutch merchant, enabled Radisson to take ship from Orange to New York, and from New York to Europe.  [Illustration: Fort Amsterdam, from an ancient engraving executed in Holland.  This view of Fort Amsterdam on the Manhattan is copied from an ancient engraving executed in Holland.  The fort was erected in 1623 but finished upon the above model by Governor Van Twiller in 1635.]  PÃ¨re Poncet had been captured by the Mohawks the preceding summer, but had escaped to Orange.[12]  Embarking on a small sloop, Radisson sailed down the Hudson to New York, which then consisted of some five hundred houses, with stores, barracks, a stone church, and a dilapidated fort. Central Park was a forest; goats and cows pastured on what is now Wall Street; and to east and west was a howling wilderness of marsh and woods.  After a stay of three weeks, Radisson embarked for Amsterdam, which he reached in January, 1654.   [1] Benjamin Sulte in _Chronique Trifluvienne_.  [2] It was in August of this same year, 1652, that the governor of Three Rivers was slain by the Iroquois.  Parkman gives this date, 1653, Garneau, 1651, L'AbbÃ© Tanguay, 1651; Dollier de Casson, 1651, Belmont, 1653.  Sulte gives the name of the governor Duplessis-Kerbodot, not Bochart, as given in Parkman.  [3] Dr. Bryce has unearthed the fact that in a petition to the House of Commons, 1698, Radisson sets down his age as sixty-two.  This gives the year of his birth as 1636.  On the other hand, Sulte has record of a Pierre Radisson registered at Quebec in 1681, aged fifty-one, which would make him slightly older, if it is the same Radisson.  Mr. Sulte's explanation is as follows: SÃ©bastien Hayet of St. Malo married Madeline HÃ©nault.  Their daughter Marguerite married Chouart, known as Groseillers.  Madeline HÃ©nault then married Pierre Esprit Radisson of Paris, whose children were Pierre, our hero, and two daughters.  [4] A despatch from M. Talon in 1666 shows there were 461 families in Three Rivers.  State papers from the Minister to M. Frontenac in 1674 show there were only 6705 French in all the colony.  Averaging five a family, there must have been 2000 people at Three Rivers.  Fear of the Iroquois must have driven the country people inside the fort, so that the population enrolled was larger than the real population of Three Rivers.  Sulte gives the normal population of Three Rivers in 1654 as 38 married couples, 13 bachelors, 38 boys, 26 girls--in all not 200.  [5] At first flush, this seems a slip in _Radisson's Relation_.  Where did the Mohawks get their guns?  _New York Colonial Documents_ show that between 1640 and 1650 the Dutch at Fort Orange had supplied the Mohawks alone with four hundred guns.  [6] One of many instances of Radisson's accuracy in detail.  All tribes have a trick of browning food on hot stones or sand that has been taken from fire.  The Assiniboines gained their name from this practice: they were the users of \"boiling stones.\"  [7] I have asked both natives and old fur-traders what combination of sounds in English most closely resembles the Indian war-cry, and they have all given the words that I have quoted.  One daughter of a chief factor, who went through a six weeks' siege by hostiles in her father's fort, gave a still more graphic description.  She said: \"you can imagine the snarls of a pack of furiously vicious dogs saying 'ah-oh' with a whoop, you have it; and you will not forget it!\"  [8] This practice was a binding law on many tribes.  Catlin relates it of the Mandans, and Hearne of the Chipewyans.  The latter considered it a crime to kiss wives and children after a massacre without the bath of purification.  Could one know where and when that universal custom of washing blood-guilt arose, one mystery of existence would be unlocked.  [9] I have throughout followed Mr. Sulte's correction of the name of this governor.  The mistake followed by Parkman, Tanguay, and others--it seems--was first made in 1820, and has been faithfully copied since.  Elsewhere will be found Mr. Sulte's complete elucidation of the hopeless dark in which all writers have involved Radisson's family.  [10] If there were not corroborative testimony, one might suspect the excited French lad of gross exaggeration in his account of Iroquois tortures; but the Jesuits more than confirm the worst that Radisson relates.  Bad as these torments were, they were equalled by the deeds of white troops from civilized cities in the nineteenth century.  A band of Montana scouts came on the body of a comrade horribly mutilated by the Indians.  They caught the culprits a few days afterwards. Though the government report has no account of what happened, traders say the bodies of the guilty Indians were found skinned and scalped by the white troops.  [11] Radisson puts the Senecas before the Cayugas, which is different from the order given by the Jesuits.  [12] The fact that Radisson confessed his sins to this priest seems pretty well to prove that Pierre was a Catholic and not a Protestant, as has been so often stated.     CHAPTER II  1657-1658  RADISSON'S SECOND VOYAGE  Radisson returns to Quebec, where he joins the Jesuits to go to the Iroquois Mission--He witnesses the Massacre of the Hurons among the Thousand Islands--Besieged by the Iroquois, they pass the Winter as Prisoners of War--Conspiracy to massacre the French foiled by Radisson.   From Amsterdam Radisson took ship to Rochelle.  Here he found himself a stranger in his native land.  All his kin of whom there is any record--Pierre Radisson, his father, Madeline HÃ©nault, his mother, Marguerite and FranÃ§oise, his elder and younger sisters, his uncle and aunt, with their daughter, Elizabeth--were now living at Three Rivers in New France.[1]  Embarking with the fishing fleet that yearly left France for the Grand Banks, Radisson came early in the spring of 1654 to Isle PercÃ©e at the mouth of the St. Lawrence.  He was still a week's journey from Three Rivers, but chance befriended him.  Algonquin canoes were on the way up the river to war on the Iroquois.  Joining the Indian canoes, he slipped past the hilly shores of the St. Lawrence and in five days was between the main bank on the north side and the muddy shallows of the Isle of Orleans.  Sheering out where the Montmorency roars over a precipice in a shining cataract, the canoes glided across St. Charles River among the forests of masts heaving to the tide below the beetling heights of Cape Diamond, Quebec.  [Illustration: One of the earliest maps of the Great Lakes.]  It was May, 1651, when he had first seen the turrets and spires of Quebec glittering on the hillside in the sun; it was May, 1652, that the Iroquois had carried him off from Three Rivers; and it was May, 1654, when he came again to his own.  He was welcomed back as from the dead.  Changes had taken place in the interval of his captivity.  A truce had been arranged between the Iroquois and the French.  Now that the Huron missions had "]]]
