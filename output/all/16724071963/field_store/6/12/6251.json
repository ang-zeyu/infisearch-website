There was no Southern force in this part of the country strong enough to meet them in open combat, but there was forest and thicket sufficient to shelter many men who were not only willing to shoot, but who knew how to shoot well. Yet they never caught anybody nor even saw anybody.  A stray glimpse or two of a puff of smoke was the nearest they ever came to beholding an enemy.  It became galling, intolerable.  Three more men were killed and the number of wounded was doubled.  The three colonels held a consultation, and decided to extend groups of skirmishers far out on either flank. Dick was chosen to lead a band of thirty picked men who rode about a mile on the right, and he had with him as his second, and, in reality, as his guide and mentor in many ways, the trusty Sergeant Whitley.  It was altogether likely that Colonel Winchester would not have sent Dick unless he had been able to send the wise sergeant with him.  \"While you are guarding us from ambush,\" he said to Dick, \"be sure you don't fall into an ambush yourself.\"  \"Not while Whitley, here, is with us,\" replied Dick.  \"He learned while out on the plains, not only to have eyes in the back of his head, but to have 'em in the sides of it as well.  In addition he can hear the fall of a leaf a mile away.\"  The sergeant shook his head and uttered an emphatic no in protest, but in his heart he was pleased.  He was a sergeant who liked being a sergeant, and he was proud of all his wilderness and prairie lore.  Dick gave the word and the little troop galloped away to the right, zealous in its task and beating up every wood and thicket for the hidden riflemen who were so dangerous.  At intervals they saw the cavalry force riding steadily on, and again they were hidden from it by forest or bush. More than an hour passed and they saw no foe.  Dick concluded that the sharpshooters had been scared off by the flanking force, and that they would have no further trouble with them.  His spirits rose accordingly and there was much otherwise to make them rise.  It was like Heaven to be on horseback in the pleasant country after being cramped up so much in narrow trenches, and there was the thrill of coming action.  They were going to join Sheridan and where he rode idle moments would be few.  \"Ping!\" a bullet whistled alarmingly near his head and then cut leaves from a sapling beyond him.  The young lieutenant halted the troop instantly, and Sergeant Whitley pointed to a house just visible among some trees.  \"That's where it came from, and, since it hasn't been followed by a second, it's likely that only one man is there, and he is lying low, waiting a chance for another bullet,\" he said.  \"Then we'll rout him out,\" said Dick.  He divided his little troop, in order that it could approach the house from all sides, and then he and the sergeant and six others advanced directly in front.  He knew that if the marksman were still hidden inside he would not fire now, but would seek rather to hide, since he could easily observe from a window that the building was surrounded.  It was a small house, but it was well built and evidently had been occupied by people of substance.  It was painted white, except the shutters which were green, and a brick walk led to a portico, with fine and lofty columns.  There was nobody outside, but as the shutters were open it was probable that someone was inside.  Dick disliked to force an entrance at such a place, but he had been sent out to protect the flank and he could not let a rifleman lie hidden there, merely to resume his deadly business as soon as they passed on.  They pushed the gate open and rode upon the lawn, an act of vandalism that he regretted, but could not help.  They reached the door without any apparent notice being taken of them, and as the detachments were approaching from the other sides, Dick dismounted and knocked loudly. Receiving no answer, he bade all the others dismount.  \"Curley, you hold the horses,\" he said, \"and Dixon, you tell the men in the other detachments to seize anybody trying to escape.  Sergeant, you and I and the others will enter the house.  Break in the lock with the butt of your rifle, sergeant!  No, I see it's not locked!\"  He turned the bolt, and, the door swinging in, they passed into an empty hall.  Here they paused and listened, which was a wise thing for a man to do when he entered the house of an enemy.  Dick's sense of hearing was not much inferior to that of the sergeant, and while at first they heard nothing, they detected presently a faint click, click. He could not imagine what made the odd sound, and, listening as hard as he could, he could detect no other with it.  He pushed open a door that led into the hall and he and his men entered a large room with windows on the side, opening upon a rose garden.  It was a pleasant room with a high ceiling, and old-fashioned, dignified furniture.  A blaze of sunlight poured in from the windows, and, where a sash was raised, came the faint, thrilling perfume of roses, a perfume to which Dick was peculiarly susceptible.  Yet, for years afterward, the odor of roses brought back to him that house and that room.  He thought at first that the room, although the faint clicking noise continued, contained no human being.  But presently he saw sitting at a table by the open window a woman whose gray dress and gray hair blended so nearly with the gray colors of the chamber that even a soldier could have been excused for not seeing her at once.  Her head and body were perfectly still, but her hands were moving rapidly.  She was knitting, and it was the click of her needles that they had heard.  She did not look up as Dick entered, and, taking off his cap, he stood, somewhat abashed.  He knew at once by her dress and face, and the dignity, disclosed even by the manner in which she sat, that she was a great lady, one of those great ladies of old Virginia who were great ladies in fact. She was rather small, Martha Washington might have looked much like her, and she knitted steadily on, without showing by the least sign that she was aware of the presence of Union soldiers.  A long and embarrassed silence followed.  Dick judged that she was about sixty-five years of age, though she seemed strong and he felt that she was watching them alertly from covert eyes.  There was no indication that anyone else was in the building, but it did not seem likely that a great lady of Virginia would be left alone in her house, with a Union force marching by.  He approached, bowed and said:  \"Madame!\"  She raised her head and looked at him slowly from head to foot, and then back again.  They were fierce old eyes, and Dick felt as if they burned him, but he held his ground knowing that he must.  Then she turned back to her knitting, and the needles clicked steadily as before.  \"Madame!\" repeated Dick, still embarrassed.  She lifted the fierce old eyes.  \"I should think,\" she said, \"that the business of General Grant's soldiers was to fight those of General Lee rather than to annoy lone women.\"  Dick flushed, but angry blood leaped in his veins.  \"Pardon me, madame,\" he said, \"but we have not come here to annoy a woman.  We were fired upon from this house.  The man who did it has had no opportunity to escape, and I'm sure that he's still concealed within these walls.\"  \"Seek and ye shall--not find,\" she half quoted.  \"I must search the house.\"  \"Proceed.\"  \"First question her,\" the sergeant whispered in the young lieutenant's ear.  Dick nodded.  \"Pardon me, madame,\" he said, \"but I must obtain information from you. This is war, you know.\"  \"I have had many rude reminders that it is so.\"  \"Where is your husband?\"  She pointed upward.  \"Forgive me,\" said Dick impulsively.  \"I did not intend to recall a grief.\"  \"Don't worry.  You and your comrades will never intrude upon him there.\"  \"Perhaps you have sons here in this house?\"  \"I have three, but they are not here.\"  \"Where are they?\"  \"One fell with Jackson at Chancellorsville.  It was a glorious death, but he is not dead to me.  I shall always see him, as he was when he went away, a tall, strong man with brown hair and blue eyes.  Another fell in Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.  They told me that his body lay across one of the Union guns on Cemetery Hill.  That, too, was a glorious death, and like his brother he shall live for me as long as I live.  The third is alive and with Lee.\"  She had stopped knitting, but now she resumed it, and, during another embarrassed pause, the click, click of the needles was the only sound heard in the room.  \"I regret it, madame,\" resumed Dick, \"but we must search the house thoroughly.\"  \"Proceed,\" she said again in that tone of finality.  \"Take the men and look carefully through every room,\" said Dick to the sergeant.  \"I will remain here.\"  Whitley and the troopers withdrew quietly.  When the last of them had disappeared he walked to one of the windows and looked out.  He saw his mounted men beyond the rose garden on guard, and he knew that they were as vigilant on the other sides of the house.  The sharpshooter could not escape, and he was firmly resolved not to go without him.  Yet his conscience hurt him.  It was hard, too, to wait there, while the woman said not a word, but knitted on as placidly as if he did not exist.  \"Madame,\" he said at last, \"I pray that you do not regard this as an intrusion.  The uses of war are hard.  We must search.  No one can regret it more than I do, in particular since I am really a Southerner myself, a Kentuckian.\"  \"A traitor then as well as an enemy.\"  Dick flushed deeply, and again there was angry blood in his veins, but he restrained his temper.  \"You must at least allow to a man the liberty of choice,\" he said.  \"Provided he has the intelligence and honesty to choose right.\"  Dick flushed again and bit his lip.  And yet he felt that a woman who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17677"],["title","The Tree of Appomattox (#6)"],["body","lost two sons before Northern bullets might well be unforgiving. There was nothing more for him to say, and while he turned back to the window the knitting needles resumed their click, click.  He waited a full ten minutes and he knew that the sergeant and his men were searching the house thoroughly.  Nothing could escape the notice of Whitley, and he would surely find the sharpshooter.  Then he heard their footsteps on a stairway and in another minute they entered the great room.  The face of the sergeant clearly showed disappointment.  \"There's nobody in the house,\" he said, \"or, if he is he's so cleverly hidden, that we haven't been able to find him--that is so far.  Perhaps Madame here can tell us something.\"  \"I know nothing,\" she said, \"but if I knew anything I would not tell it to you.\"  The sergeant smiled sourly, but Dick said:  \"We must look again.  The man could not have escaped with the guard that we've set around the house.\"  The sergeant and his men made another search.  They penetrated every place in which a human being could possibly hide.  They thrust their rifle barrels up the chimneys, and they turned down the bed covers, but again they found nothing.  Dick meanwhile remained as before in the large room, covertly watching the woman, lest she give a signal to the rifleman who must be somewhere.  All the while the perfume of the roses was growing stronger and more penetrating, a light wind that had sprung up bringing it through the open window.  It thrilled Dick in some singular manner, and the strangeness of the scene heightened its effect.  It was like standing in a room in a dim old castle to which he had been brought as a prisoner, while the terrible old woman was his jailer.  Then the click of the knitting needles brought him back to the present and reality, but reality itself, despite the sunshine and the perfume of the roses, was heavy and oppressive.  Dick apparently was looking from the window at the garden, brilliant with flowers, but in fact he was closely watching the woman out of the corner of his eye.  He had learned to read people by their own eyes, and he had seen how hers burned when she looked at them.  Strength of will and intent lie in the human eye.  Unless it is purposely veiled it tells the mind and power that are in the brain back of it.  A fear of her crept slowly over him.  Perhaps the fear came because, obviously, she had no fear at all of him, or of Whitley or of the soldiers.  After their short dialogue she had returned to her old immobility.  Neither her body nor her head moved, only her hands, and the motion was wholly from the wrists.  She was one of the three Fates, knitting steadily and knitting up the destiny of men.  He shook himself.  His was a sound and healthy mind, and he would allow no taint of morbidness to enter it.  He knew that there was nothing supernatural in the world, but he did believe that this woman with the gray hair, the burning eyes and the sharp chin, looking as if it had been cut from a piece of steel, was the possessor of uncanny wisdom. Beyond a doubt she knew where the marksman was hidden, and, unless he watched her ceaselessly, she would give him a signal of some kind.  Perhaps he was hidden in the garden among the rose bushes, and he would see her hand, if it was raised ever so slightly.  Maybe that was why the window was open, because the clearest glass even could obscure a signal meant to be faint, unnoticed by all except the one for whom it was intended.  He would have that garden searched thoroughly when the sergeant returned, and his heart beat with a throb of relief when he heard the stalwart Whitley's footstep once more at the door.  \"We have found nothing, sir,\" said the sergeant.  \"We've explored every place big enough to hide a cat.\"  \"Search the garden out there,\" said Dick.  \"Look behind every vine and bush.\"  \"You will at least spare my roses,\" said the woman.  \"They shall not be harmed,\" replied the lieutenant, \"but my men must see what, if anything, is in the garden.\"  She said no more.  She had not even raised her head when she spoke, and the sergeant and his men went into the garden.  They looked everywhere but they damaged nothing.  They did not even break off a single flower for themselves.  Dick had felt confident that after the failure to find the sharpshooter in the house he would be discovered there, but his net brought in no fish.  He glanced at the sergeant, who happened to glance at him at the same time.  Each read the look in the eyes of the other.  Each said that they had failed, that they were wasting time, that there was nothing to be gained by hunting longer for a single enemy, that it was time to ride on, as flankers on the right of the main column.  \"Madame,\" said Dick politely, \"we leave you now.  I repeat my regret at being compelled to search your house in this manner.  My duty required it, although we have found nobody.\"  \"You found nobody because nobody is here.\"  \"Evidently it is so.  Good-by.  We wish you well.\"  \"Good-by.  I hope that all of you will be shot by our brave troops before night!\"  The wish was uttered with the most extraordinary energy and fierceness. For the first time she had raised her level tone, and the lifted eyes that looked into Dick's were blazing with hate.  He uttered an exclamation and stepped back.  Then he recovered himself and said politely:  \"Madame, I do not wish any such ill to you or yours.\"  But she had resumed her knitting, and Dick, without another word, walked out of the house, followed by the sergeant and his men.  \"I did not know a woman could be so vindictive,\" he said.  \"Our army has killed two of her sons,\" said the sergeant.  \"To her we, like all the rest of our troops, are the men who killed them.\"  \"Perhaps that is so,\" said Dick thoughtfully, as he remounted.  They rode beside the walk and out at the open gate.  Dick carried a silver whistle, upon which he blew a signal for the rest of his men to join them, and then he and the sergeant went slowly up the road.  He was deeply chagrined at the escape of the rifleman, and the curse of the woman lay heavily upon him.  \"I don't see how it was done,\" he said.  \"Nor I,\" said the sergeant, shaking his head.  There was a sharp report, the undoubted whip-like crack of a rifle, and a man just behind, uttering a cry, held up a bleeding arm.  Dick had a lightning conviction that the bullet was intended for himself.  It was certain also that the shot had come from the house.  \"Back with me, sergeant!\" he exclaimed.  \"We'll get that fellow yet!\"  They galloped back, sprang from their horses, and rushed in, followed by the original little troop that had entered, Dick shouting a direction to the others to remain outside.  The fierce little old woman was sitting as before by the table, knitting, and she had never appeared more the great lady.  \"Once was enough,\" she said, shooting him a glance of bitter contempt.  \"But twice may succeed,\" Dick said.  \"Sergeant, take the men and go through all the house again.  Our friend with the rifle may not have had time to get back into his hidden lair.  I will remain here.\"  The sergeant and his men went out and he heard their boots on the stairway and in the other rooms.  The window near him was still open and the perfume of the roses came in again, strangely thrilling, overpowering.  But something had awakened in Dick.  The sixth, and even the germ of a seventh sense, which may have been instinct, were up and alive.  He did not look again at the rose garden, nor did he listen any longer to the footsteps of his men.  He had concentrated all his faculties, the known, and the unknown, which may have been lying dormant in him, upon a single object.  He heard only the click of the knitting needles, and he saw only the small, strong hands moving swiftly back and forth.  They were very white, and they were firm like those of a young woman.  There were none of the heavy blue veins across the back that betoken age.  The hands fascinated him.  He stared at them, fairly pouring his gaze upon them.  They were beautiful, as the hands of a great lady should be kept, and it was all the more wonderful then that the right should have across the back of it a faint gray smudge, so tiny that only an eye like his, and a concentrated gaze like his, could have seen it.  He took four swift steps forward, seized the white hand in his and held it up.  \"Madame,\" he said, and now his tone was as fierce as hers had ever been, \"where is the rifle?\"  She made no attempt to release her hand, nor did she move at all, save to lift her head.  Then her eyes, hard, defiant and ruthless, looked into his.  But his look did not flinch from hers.  He knew, and, knowing, he meant to act.  \"Madame,\" he repeated, \"where is the rifle?  It is useless for you to deny.\"  \"Have I denied?\"  \"No, but where is the rifle?\"  He was wholly unconscious of it, but his surprise and excitement were so great that his hand closed upon hers in a strong muscular contraction. Thrills of pain shot through her body, but she did not move.  \"The rifle!  The rifle!\" repeated Dick.  \"Loose my hand, and I will give it to you.\"  His hand fell away and she walked to the end of the room where a rug, too long, lay in a fold against the wall.  She turned back the fold and took from its hiding place a slender-barreled cap-and-ball rifle. Without a word she handed it to Dick and he passed his hand over the muzzle, which was still warm.  He looked at her, but she gave back his gaze unflinching.  \"I could not believe it, were it not so,\" he said.  \"But it is so.  The bullets were not aimed well enough.\"  Dick felt an emotion that he did not wholly understand.  \"Madame,\" he said, \"I shall take the rifle, and again say good-by. As before, I wish you well.\"  She resumed her seat in the chair and took up the knitting.  But she did not repeat her wish that Dick and all his men be shot before night. He went out in silence, and gently closed the door behind"]]]
