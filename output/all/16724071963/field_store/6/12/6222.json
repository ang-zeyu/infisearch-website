His hand had been swallowed up by a huge palm and thick iron-like fingers, and he was staring down on a pair of the broadest shoulders he had seen, with an arching chest to match. This was the pigmy he had imagined--this man with the shoulders of a giant and the chest of a Hercules. Then his eyes ranged over the walls, gradually recovering their animation.  \"Know 'em,\" said Mr. Hume, waving a bronzed hand towards the wall.  \"I think so, sir.\"  \"Just reel off the names.\"  Venning reeled off the names of a score or more of animals without hesitation, and Mr. Hume looked pleased.  \"There are some men,\" he said, \"who come in here and talk over me and round me and under me about fur and feather, and they can't tell a bighorn from a koodoo by the horns on the wall. Now, my friend, you knew those over there in the corner were the horns of a koodoo, but do you know his habits?\"  \"No, sir; but I spent a month watching a Dartmoor deer.\"  \"A month! Can't learn anything in a month, boy; but you've struck the right book. The pages that are spread out under the sky hold the right teaching, for those who wish to learn about animals. There are writers who make a study of structure; they argue from bones, and classify; but bones don't tell us about the living flesh and blood. You take my meaning?\"  \"You make a difference between the structure of animals and their habits.\"  \"That's so, my lad. Ever read Jeffreys, and the sketches by the 'Son of the Marshes'?\"  \"They're splendid.\"  Mr. Hume nodded and filled a pipe, having a footlong stem, made out of the wing-bone of an albatross.  \"I want to describe the personal habits of animals in their surroundings. I said 'personal' habits. Do you take me?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"You think I should use another word, and say, perhaps, 'distinctive' habits. I say personal. Now, you take a lion--a bush lion or a veld lion, a yellow lion or a black lion, young or old. That lion, whichever one you take, is a lion by himself. He's got his own character and his own experience. All lions have ways in common because they're built alike. They're heavy and muscular because they've got to pull down big game; and because they're heavy they move slowly, and because they move slowly they've got to adopt common tactics in hunting. Good; but one lion differs from another, and so with other animals, right away through the list. So, I say, one must study the personal habits of animals in their own back yard, so to say, before he can give a true description of them. Do you take my meaning?\"  \"I should like nothing better than to study animals in their home,\" said the boy, burning with excitement.  \"And the two of you think you would like to join me in my expedition?\"  Mr. Hume looked at them out of calm yellowish eyes as if he were studying them.  \"We should,\" they said eagerly.  \"Think it will turn out a picnic--a glorified sort of camping-out, with black fellows to wait on you, and a lot of shooting and fishing? Is that your idea?\"  \"We were talking about that this morning,\" said Compton, \"and we came to the conclusion that exploring was hard work. We are prepared for rough living.\"  \"That's right. And you tell me that you are free to go without giving anxiety to relatives, eh?\"  \"We neither of us have near relatives.\"  Mr. Hume stood up and felt each one over in turn, making them draw deep breaths.  \"Seem sound,\" he mused, \"in wind and limb. But there is one thing. The great danger in Central Africa is from fever--not from animals or blacks.\" Here he took down a bottle of white powder, and placed a large pinch in a wine-glass of water.  \"Quinine is the traveler's stand-by, but there are some who cannot take quinine, It has no effect on them, and such people have no business to set foot in fever districts. Drink this?\"  Compton emptied the glass with a wry face, and Venning, when his turn came, shuddered; but they got the dose down, and smiled.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Hume, \"you both of you give me references to the headmaster of your school, and I will give you one in return. I will make inquiries about you, and I would advise you to make inquiries about me. You can come back here to-morrow afternoon, and if we are mutually satisfied, we will then fix up a contract.\"  \"I don't think we require a reference,\" said Venning.  \"Why not?\" said Mr. Hume, sharply.  \"Because,\" blurted out Venning, turning red--\"because you have lived among animals.\"  Mr. Hume laughed heartily with a deep rumbling laugh.  \"Animals are tricky, boy; and yet,\" he added, \"there may be a meaning in what you say. They have a dignity in death that is grand. Go and make your inquiries, lads. I am Dave Hume, the hunter, and my life has been passed in wild lands, but there are some in London who know me.\"  He rose up to open the door, and Venning overtopped him by inches, yet he did not look either small or unwieldy. His step was springy, and his head, poised on a massive neck, was well set, with the chin raised. He was a man, evidently, who had always looked the world straight in the face. His eyes had a yellowish tinge, and in their colour and their calm they reminded Venning somehow of a lion, an impression heightened by the tawny hue of a long beard.  The next day, the references having been satisfactorily followed up, the contract was entered upon, and the two boys paid over the sum of Pounds 50 each to David Hume, who in his turn agreed to let them share in any profits which the expedition might make, from any source whatever.  \"Profits, Mr. Hume?\" they asked.  \"Profits from hunting, from trading, or from discovery. I don't say that we shall make anything. The chances are, of course, that we may lose all before we are a month out, but it is always well to be business-like. There is gold in Central Africa. We may discover a gold reef. There are new animals in the forest. We may catch an okapi, and if we could land it in England it would fetch a large sum. We might snare a live gorilla, and there is not a gorilla in the zoological gardens of Europe.\"  \"A gorilla!\" said Venning, thinking of a picture he had seen of an erect man-ape bending a rifle-barrel into an arch as if it were a cane.  \"A gorilla!\" said Compton. \"I should like to find the Garden of Rest.\"  \"You have heard his story, Mr. Venning?\" said the hunter, nodding his head at Compton.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Well, it was because of that story that I have taken you two into my expedition; otherwise I should have been obliged to decline your services on account of your youth. But the story interested me, and I will do my best to help Compton in his search.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Compton, quietly.  \"The Garden of Rest!\" mused the hunter. \"That, I take it, would be an Arabian phrase; for such a term would not occur to a native, who is too often idle to  attach much value to a state of rest. It sounds peaceful;  but I have it in my mind that if we ever reach the place,  it will be only after much hard work, much suffering, and danger. You understand that this is no pleasure excursion?\"  \"We do, sir,\" said Compton; \"yet we expect to get much pleasure from the expedition.\"  \"Another word. I am not an exacting man; but there is one thing I will not tolerate, and that is disobedience. It is well to understand that now;\" and there came a stern expression into those singular eyes.  \"That is only right,\" said Compton; and Venning agreed.    CHAPTER II  A NOVEL CRAFT  A month was devoted to preparation--a month that was full of pleasure to the two friends, for they came into close touch with Dave Hume the hunter, and learnt to regard him almost as a brother. Ordinarily, he was curt in his speech and cold in manner, especially with strangers; but at night, when he had shed his boots and coat, he would talk to them freely of his hunting experiences, and listen with interest to their opinions. He never laughed at their mistakes, nor damped their enthusiasm, but he got the best out of them by a fine courtesy that seemed part of his nature.  Thus it was that when, early in the first week, Venning said he had an idea for a boat that could be easily carried round the cataracts and worked without much labour, he was at once encouraged to give plans and specifications.  \"I read once about a 'sneak-box'--a flat-bottomed shooting canoe-- that could carry a sail and serve at the same time as a cabin.\"  \"I have used one myself duck-shooting. Go on.\"  \"Well, sir, I built a boat on the plan given, and spent a holiday one year on the Broads. It drew very little water, and was easily managed. However, you know all that. But what I was thinking about was a design for a larger boat of the kind, with a propeller attached to it which could be worked by lever.\"  \"By a lever?\"  \"Perhaps you have seen a lame man working a bicycle by a lever-- well, after that principle. There would be a steel rod with cog- wheels, and one man could work the lever as the lame cyclist does without the labour of  rowing.\" Venning waited nervously for the criticism.  \"At any rate the lever would be a relief after the paddles,\" said Mr. Hume, gravely.  \"But that is not all,\" continued the inventor, hastily. \"I would rig up a light American windmill amidships, which could work the screw and get more speed with a following wind in conjunction with a sail rigged up forward.\"  \"Bravo, my boy!\" said Mr. Hume, laughing. \"How many revolutions of the screw to the minute do you expect to get out of your windmill?\"  \"That depends on the power of the wind, sir. Do you think it is a mad scheme?\"  \"It would impress the natives,\" said Compton, \"and at any rate we could start wheat-milling, you know, in case we came to the end of our resources.\"  \"There's no wheat in Central Africa, you duffer! Besides, sir, it's mainly a question of gear. With a lever, cog-wheels, and a running chain after the pattern of the cycle chain, one could----\"  \"And ball bearings,\" suggested Compton, slyly.  \"Yes; and ball bearings--the friction would be reduced, and we could get more power out "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],["title","In Search of the Okapi (#2)"],["body","a screw and propeller than we could from four paddles.\"  \"You may be right,\" said Mr. Hume, thoughtfully.  \"We don't want to take a large party, and I confess the water transport has bothered me very much. The wind-mill, I am afraid, we must leave to some other time, but the other part of your scheme is worth placing before practical men, and I will give you a letter to a friend of mine who had a boat built on the Thames.\"  Venning saw the friend the very next day; the friend gave him an introduction to a member of a great firm of torpedo-boat builders on the Thames, and this gentleman very kindly gave the matter five minutes' attention.  \"Your idea, eh?\" said the great designer. \"Explain what advantage you expect to gain.\"  \"Less labour in working than with paddles, and greater speed.\"  \"Humph! Well, my lad, you leave the matter with me, and I will report. You can look over the yards if you like.\"  Venning spent the rest of the morning among the wicked-looking sharks of the Navy, and he went back depressed with the thought that his \"sneak-box\" was merely a plaything. However, he picked up confidence when the next day brought an offer from the builders to turn out an aluminium sneak-box in three divisions, with capacity for a crew of six, to be worked on occasion by two men pulling at levers, driving the propeller by means of endless chains and cog- wheels, the gear to be made of best oil-tempered nickel-steel, with hardened ball bearings. Each division, when detached, of such weight that it could be easily carried by three men, but no guarantee given that the propeller would give the speed desired.  \"That is good enough for us, I think,\" said Mr. Hume.  \"They give no guarantee,\" remarked Compton, cautiously.  \"No; but they would not undertake the work unless they had some belief in the idea, and if the propeller proves useless, we can at the worst unship it. In any case we must have the boat, and we could not improve on the makers.\"  The order was given, and by the fourth week the little boat was launched on the Thames for its first trial. It looked workmanlike in spite of its wide beam and shallow draught, for the great designer who had fashioned the lines of the fastest destroyer afloat had himself drawn up the plans after giving a day's careful thought to the job. The shaft, which rested on nickel-steel sockets, with ball bearings supported by nickel-steel ribs for lightness, was protected by a water-tight casing, and all the other parts made of the very best metal, so as to secure both lightness and strength, with a complicated set of cog-wheels to take off the strain. The steering was by a neat wheel right forward, where the look-out man could have an uninterrupted view. Forward, too, was the socket for the metal mast. The boat was fifteen feet in length, with a beam of four feet amidships, tapering fore and aft, with a well in the centre, and the remaining space covered in with a light aluminium deck, strengthened by oak bends. There was sleeping-room for two, so that with a crew of four there would have to be four watches of three hours each. The peculiar features of the long, low craft were the two levers rising above the after-deck through slots, which gave each a thrust of about one and a half feet, and two  saddle-like seats borne on stout supports, one near the stem facing the bows, and the other further forward facing the stem. Venning perched himself on one seat, Compton on the other, one of the hands took the wheel, and Mr. Hume and the designer sat in the well.  Compton's clear-cut face, with well-formed jaws, showed no other sign of interest than a rather amused smile, but Venning's fair features were flushed with excitement and nervous expectation, A man pushed the boat out. It moved at first sluggishly.  \"Full speed ahead!\" cried out Mr. Hume.  Venning pulled his lever over, and as he shot it back Compton pulled his, the two moving to and fro easily as if they had been rowing a steady stroke.  \"She moves, she moves!\" cried Mr. Hume, with a shout.  \"Take her over the mile,\" said the designer to the steersman; and he pulled out his watch with exactly the same look of calm interest he showed when presiding over the trial of the fastest craft afloat.  The shining aluminium boat answered to her helm, slipped through the muddy waters in a graceful curve, and then steadied for the straight course.  \"Let her go, boys.\"  The levers worked to and fro with an easy swing; there rose the hum of the chains moving easily below, and the quickened churning of the propeller blades.  The designer glanced from his watch to the bank, which was fast slipping away, and nodded his head at Mr. Hume.  \"Easy all. I think she will do;\" and he nodded at Venning. \"Ten minutes.\"  \"Ten minutes!\"  \"A mile in ten minutes--six miles an hour!\"  \"And it was as easy as nothing,\" said Venning--\"wasn't it, Dick?\"  \"Like cutting bread,\" said Compton.  \"Very good, I think; but you must remember that she carries no cargo. Now we'll try her with the sail alone, and then with the sail and screw combined, and then with the screw and oars, for you will see that I have fitted row-locks.\"  Under a fair breeze the boat skimmed along at a merry pace, with no wave worth speaking of; and with the sail and screw she put on an additional four miles, and with the oars an extra three, making from nine to ten miles an hour.  \"I congratulate you, Mr. Venning,\" said the designer, as they stepped out, thoroughly pleased.  \"I am sure, sir, we thank you,\" said the boy, warmly.  \"Eight,\" said Mr. Hume; \"and we are thoroughly pleased with the craft, every one of us.\"  \"She is a beauty,\" put in Compton--\"a real beauty; and I think she would be perfect if a light awning could be fixed up over the after- deck.\"  \"That could be done easily.  \"It would be an improvement, certainly,\" said Mr. Hume.  \"I will rig up brackets to hold the rods for the awning.\"  \"And we could fix up mosquito curtains round the sides. That is A 1. Now, what is her name to be?\" And Mr. Hume looked at Venning.  He had thought of a name, and was prompt with it--the Okapi.  \"And what does that mean?\" asked the builder, with a smile.  Venning explained, and the name was adopted.  \"Now,\" said the builder, \"if Mr. Venning will come down to-morrow afternoon, my workmen will take the Okapi to pieces in his presence before packing it for delivery in the docks, and explain thoroughly how it is to be put together. I will give orders for several extra plates with fittings to be placed in one of the divisions, so that if you have an accident you will have the material for repairing the mischief. You understand, aluminium cannot be soldered, but you could cover a hole by means of nuts and screws.\"  Venning was in time next day to receive his instructions, and made in his note-book an outline sketch of each part. While he was so engaged, Mr. Hume, with Compton, were seeing the outfit packed for the steamer, every purchase having been made with great judgment, so that nothing superfluous figured in the list. Their armament consisted of one double express for Mr. Hume, two sporting carbines for the boys, three Mauser revolvers, and one fowling-piece, strong hunting-knives, as well as four Ghoorka knives for cutting a path through the forest. As far as possible all their food-stuff was concentrated in tabloids and essences; each had his own special tin- lined  medicine-case, in addition to the common drug-chest; each his own water-bottle of double canvas, a material which, permitting evaporation, keeps the water cool; and each his regulation \"billy,\" or cooking-tin. As for clothing, it was a mixture of luxury and rough wear, of the best silk underwear, cellular shirts of a light blue, and yellow chamois-skin breeches, warranted to grow tougher with use. Putties were discarded, as likely to give harbourage to \"jiggers,\" which bore into the toes, in favour of soft leather high boots, tightly fastened at the knee; and the outfit included needles for the making of moccasins, or  veld schoen, from the hides of the larger antelope.  \"Why do you select all blue shirts, Mr. Hume?\" asked Venning.  \"On account of the mosquitoes.\"  \"Consider the feeling of the gorillas,\" said Compton, dryly. \"Perhaps they would prefer green.\"  \"They may find us green enough for their taste, Compton; but I am not joking. Mosquitoes have a preference for some colours and an aversion for others. They dislike blue most of all, so you see I have a purpose in selecting blue--not only for the shirts, but for the mosquito curtains.\"  \"All these precautions for a wretched fly.\"  \"Exactly. A mosquito's gimlet carries more terrors for the explorer than the elephant's trunk, and his hum is more dreaded than the roar of the lion. The mosquito is fever-winged, alert, and bloodthirsty. He carries the germs of malaria with him; and malaria kills off more men than all the reptiles and wild animals combined.\"  \"Is there no way of fighting?\" asked Compton, impressed.  \"Oh ay; they are fighting him on the West Coast by draining the swamps, where he breeds about the villages. But who can drain the swamps of the Congo, or let light into the Great Forest?\"  \"Then we stand a fair chance to catch malaria?\"  \"A better chance,\" said Mr. Hume, grimly, \"than we have of catching the okapi. Fear the mosquito, but at the same time take every precaution against its attack. I have an idea myself that nature has provided a safeguard.\"  \"Quinine?\" said Venning.  \"Quinine is an antidote. I mean a preventive--but that is your department, Venning. It will be one of your duties to study the little brute, and you may make a great discovery, for instance, it has been discovered that the mosquito dislikes certain colours. Why? It may be that he would show more distinctly on one colour than on another, and so fall an easy victim to an insect-eating bird. But it may be that the leaves of some plant of a particular hue, or the juices of the plant, are distasteful to"]]]
