It was barely pale gray.  It was cold and wan and washed, and wonderfully clean and sweet, and wet with dews, when a lark climbed invisibly into the sky and suddenly burst into song, next morning. There was something strange and out of place, in a way, in this song, breaking out of the night; and as it and another continued to break the utter silence for ten minutes, it seemed rather as if it were still night, and not really dawn at all.  Dawn appeared to be waiting for something else to give it authority, so to speak, and at the end of ten minutes that something else came--the slim form of Blackie, streaking, phantom-like, through the mist from the trench out in the field to the summer-house in the garden.  Here, mounted upon the very top, he stood for a moment, as one clearing his throat before blowing a bugle, and then, full, rich, deep, and flute-like, he lazily gave out the first bars of his song.  Instantly, almost as if it had been a signal, a great tit-mouse sang out, \"Tzur ping-ping! tzur ping-ping!\" in metallic, ringing notes; a thrush struck in with his brassy, clarion challenge, thrush after thrush taking it up, till, with the clear warble of robin and higher, squeaking notes of hedge-sparrow and wren joining in, the wonderful first bars of the Dawn Hymn of the birds rolled away over the fields to the faraway woods, and beyond.  Blackie sang on for a bit, in spite of the fact that people said that it was not considered \"the thing\" for a blackbird with such domestic responsibilities to sing.  And two other blackbirds helped him to break the man-made rule.  As a matter of fact, I fancy he was not taking chances upon the ground while the mist hung to cover late night prowlers, for as soon as the gay and gaudy chaffinches had stuck themselves up in the limes and the sycamores, and started their own smashing idea of song, he was down upon the lawn giving the early worm a bad time.  Then it was that he heard a rumpus that shot him erect, and sent his extraordinarily conspicuous orange dagger of a beak darting from side to side in that jerky way of listening that many birds affect.  \"Twet-twet-et-et-et! twet! twet-twet-twet-et-et-twet!\" came the unmistakable voice of one in a temper, scolding loudly.  And he knew that scold--had heard it before, by Jove!  And who should know it if not he, since it was the voice of his wife?  Perhaps he heaved a sigh as he rose from the deliciously cool, wet lawn--where it was necessary to take long, high hops if you wanted to avoid getting drenched--and winged his way towards the riot.  His wife was calling him, and it came from the other side of the garden, _her_ side, behind the house.  Perhaps it was a cat, or a rat, or something. Anything, almost, would set her on like that if experience, plus the experience of blackbirds for hundreds of generations working blindly in her brain--and not the experience of books--had taught her that the precise creature whom she saw was a danger and a menace to young blackbirds.  All the same, when Blackie arrived he _was_ surprised, for all that he saw was a grayish bird with \"two lovely black eyes,\" not by any means as large as a blackbird.  When it flew it kept low, with a weak and peculiar flight that was deceiving; and when Mrs. Blackie, following it, and yelling like several shrews, got too close, it turned its head, and said, \"Wark! wark!\" in a harsh and warning way.  Blackie joined in with his deeper \"Twoit-twoit-twoit!\" just by way of lending official dignity to the proceedings.  Whereupon his wife, feeling that he had backed her up, redoubled her excitement and shrill abuse.  And they spent two solid hours at this fool's game, helped by a robin, a blue tit, and a chaffinch or two--the chaffinch must have his finger in every pie--following that gray bird from nowhere, while it moved about the garden in its shuffling flight, or alternately sat and scowled at them.  But it must be admitted that Blackie himself looked rather bored, and might have gone off for breakfast any time, if he had dared.  As a matter of fact, however, the bird did not stand upon the Register of Bad Deeds as being a terror of even the mildest kind of blackbirds. Red-backed shrike was her name, female was her sex, and from Africa had she come.  Goodness knows where she was going, but not far, probably; and the largest thing in the bird line she appeared able to tackle was something of the chaffinch size.  But, all the same, Mrs. Blackie seemed jolly well certain that she knew better.  Then arrived the bombshell.  One of the Blackie youngsters, stump-tailed, frog-mouthed, blundering, foolish, gawky, and squawking, landed, all of a heap, right into the very middle of the picnic-party.  Mrs. Blackie very nearly had a fit on the spot, and the shrike judged that the time had about arrived for her to quit that vicinity.  Blackie himself, to do him justice, kept cool enough to do nothing. Wives will say that he was just husband all over, but there were reasons abroad.  One of them shot past Blackie, who was low down, a second later and a yard away, and had he not been absolutely still, and therefore as invisible as one of the most conspicuous of birds in the wild can be, he would have known in that instant, or the next, what lies upon the other side of death.  Another reason shot through the lower hedge, and, both together, they fell upon the young bird.  They were the cat of the house and her half-grown kitten, and they were upon the unhappy youngster before you could shout, \"Murder!\"  What followed was painful.  Mrs. Blackie went clean demented.  Blackie went--not so demented.  (It always appeared to me that his was a more practical mind than his wife's, perhaps because he wore a more conspicuous livery.)  Mrs. Blackie kept passing and repassing the cats' backs, flying from bough to bough, and sometimes touching and sometimes not touching them.  It was useless, of course, this pathetic charging; and it was foolish.  Blackie charged, too, but not within feet.  Suddenly the old cat, who had had one eye upon Mrs. Blackie the whole time, sprang up and struck quickly twice.  There was a chain of shrieks from Mrs. Blackie, and down she went in the grip of the clawed death. She never got up again.  What had happened was simple enough.  One of the laborers working on the trench, knowing of the nest, had, out of curiosity, approached a little too close, when the bevy of youngsters, being ready to fly, but not knowing it before this great fright, burst apart at his approach like a silent cannon cracker.  The fear showed them they could use their wings.  All three had made, flying low and weakly, for the nearest hedge, which was the garden hedge--two to the side which comprised their father's hunting-ground, and one to the side dominated by their ma.  And the old cat and her kitten had seen them coming, and had given chase.        *      *      *      *      *      *  Blackie discovered his remaining progeny sitting about in bushes, squawking, a few minutes later, when he returned, somewhat agitated to his precious lawn, and there he promptly proceeded to feed them.  The task was such a large one, and took so long, and so many worms had to be cut up, and so much bread, and, I may say, when all else failed, so many daisies had to be picked, before he finally silenced their ceaseless, craving remarks, that, by the time he had finished feeding himself and had a clean up, something of the pain of the tragedy had gone from him.  And fine fat blackbirds he made of those youngsters, too, in the end, I want to tell you, for he stuck to 'em like a brick.     III  UNDER THE YELLOW FLAG  A little past noon each day the sun covered a crack between two boards on the summer-house floor, and up through that aperture, for three days, had come a leggy, racy-looking, wolfish black spider.  Each day, as it grew hotter, she extended her sphere of jerky investigation, vanishing down the crack again when the sun passed from it.  To-day she prolonged her roamings right up the wall of the summer-house and along a joist bare of all save dust, and--well, the spider walked straight on, moving with little jerks as if by intermittent clockwork, and she seemed to stroll right on top of the wasp lying curled up on her side.  Only when one of the latter's delicate feelers shifted round towards her, as though in some uncanny way conscious of her approach, did she leap back as if she had touched an electric wire.  Then she froze--flat.  The wasp was lying curled up, as we have said, upon her side, her head tucked in, her wings drawn down, her jaws tight shut upon a splinter of wood.  She had been there half-a-year, asleep, hibernating, and in that state, without any other protection than the summer-house roof and walls, had survived the frosts of winter.  The wasp did not move further.  The spider appeared to be taking things in, measuring her chances, weighing the risk against her famished hunger--possibly her late husband had been her last meal, months ago--marking the vital spot upon her prey, aiming for the shot, which must be true, for one does not miss in attacking a wasp--and live.  Only, she would not have risked it at all, perhaps, if the wasp had seemed alive, or more alive, at any rate.  Then came the shot--one cannot in justice call it a spring; it was too instant to be termed that.  The spider simply was upon the wasp without seeming to go there; but the wasp was not there, or, rather, her vital spot wasn't.  She had kicked herself round on her side, like a cart-wheel, lying flat, with her feet, and the spider's jaws struck only hard cuirass.  Before the spider, leaping back, wolf-like, could lunge in her lightning second stroke, the wasp was on her feet, a live thing, after all.  The warmth had been already soaking the message of spring into her cold-drugged brain, and now this sudden attack had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],["title","The Way of the Wild (#7)"],["body","what the warmth had begun.  She was awake, on her feet, a live and dangerous proposition; groggy, it is true; dazed, half-working, so to speak; but a force to be reckoned with--after half-a-year.  And one saw, too, at a glance that she was different from ordinary wasps--would make two, in fact, of any ordinary wasp; and her great jaws looked as if they could eat one and comfortably deal with more; whilst her dagger-sting, now unsheathed and ready--probably for the first time--could deliver a wound twice as deep and deadly as the ordinary wasp.  She was, in short, a queen-wasp; a queen of the future, if Fate willed; a queen as yet without a kingdom, a sovereign uncrowned, but of regal proportions and queenly aspect, for all that; for in the insect world royalties are fashioned upon a super-standard that marks them off from the common herd.  The spider hesitated.  She knew the danger of the stripes of yellow--the yellow flag, so to speak.  The fear of it is upon every insect that lives.  At the same time, the queen was undoubtedly yet numb.  Antagonists decide in the insect world like a flash of light, and quick as thought they act.  The spider attacked now so quickly that she seemed to have vanished, and she met--jaws.  Back she shot, circled, shot in again, and she met--sting!  It was never clear whether that sting went home.  The spider did.  She fell--fell plump to the floor, only not breaking what spiders have in place of a neck because of the fact that, being a spider, she never moved anywhere, not even upon a spring, without anchoring a line of web down first.  Therefore, an inch from the ground, she fetched up with a jerk upon the line that she had anchored up on the joist, spun round, let herself drop the rest of the way, and ran into the crack between the boards of the floor.  Goodness knows if she lived.  The wasp, with that extremely droll, lugubrious look on her long, mask-like face which makes the faces of insects so funny and uncanny, like pantomime masks, sat down as if nothing had happened, apparently to scheme out the best way to possess herself of a kingdom and become a queen in fact as well as in name.  Really, she was cleaning herself--combing her antennae with her forelegs, provided with bristle hairs for the purpose, scraping and polishing her wings, as if they did not already shine like mother-o'-pearl, and washing her quaint face.  She was still rather groggy from the effects of her long sleep and the cold endured--it is a wonder how she had stood the latter at all--and when, with a subdued inward sort of hum, she finally launched herself in flight, she nearly fell to the ground before righting herself and flying in a zigzag heavily across the lawn.  A cock-chaffinch up in the limes saw her, and condescending at last to break his song, described a flashing streak of wine-red breast and white wing-bars in the sun.  He appeared to recognize her sinister yellow shield in time, however, and returned to his perch with a flourish, leaving the wasp to go on and begin dancing up the wall of the house till she came to the open window.  Here she vanished within.  The sunlight sat on the floor of the room inside, and the baby sat in the sunlight; and the wasp, apparently still half-awake, went, or, rather, nearly tumbled, and sat beside the baby.  They made an odd picture there--the golden sun, the sunny, golden-headed baby, and that silent, yellow she-devil, crawling, crawling, crawling, with her narrow wings gleaming like gems.  Then the child put out her chubby hand to seize that bright-yellow object--how was she to know that it was the yellow signal of danger in the insect world that she saw?  And, of course, being a baby, she was going to stuff it into her mouth.  But Fate had use for that wasp--perhaps for that baby.  Wherefore there was a little scream, a pair of woman's arms swept down and whisked that baby into the air, and a high-heeled shoe whisked the astonished wasp into a corner.  Here she swore savagely, vibrating her head with tremendous speed in the process, rose heavily and menacingly, made to fly out, hit the upper window, which was shut, and which she could not see, but felt, and fell to the floor again, where she apparently had brain-fever, buzzing round and round on her back like a top the while.  And then, rising suddenly, the queen flew away, hitting nothing in the process, but getting through the lower and open part of the window. She seemed anxious to make sure of not getting into the house again. She flew right away, rising high to top the garden hedge, and dropping low on the far side, to buzz and poke about in and out, up along the hedge-bank that bordered the hayfield.  She flew as one looking for something, and every insect in her way took jolly good care--in the shape of scintillating streaks and dashes--to get out of it.  The mere sight of that yellow-banded cuirass shining in the sun was apparently quite enough for them--most of them, anyway.  As a matter of fact, she was looking for a site for a city.  She had ambition, and would found her a city, a city of her very own, with generous streets at right angles, on the American plan; and she would be queen of it.  It was a big idea, and we should have said an impossible one, seeing that at that moment she was the city and its population and its queen all rolled into one, so to speak. Queen-wasps, however, also on the American plan, ruled the word \"impossible\" out of their dictionary long ago.  They \"attempt the end, and never stand to doubt.\"  The queen came to rest on a bare patch of ground an front of a hole, and a black and hairy spider, with two hindlegs missing on the offside, spun round in the entrance of that hole to face her.  He had not been noticeable until he moved.  She left him in a hurry, and thereafter resumed her endless searching along the hedge-bank.  A dozen times she vanished into a hole, and, after a minute or so, came out again with the air of one dissatisfied. Half-a-dozen times she came out tail first, buzzing warnings and very angry, at the invitation of a bumble-bee queen, a big, hook-jawed, carnivorous beetle in shining mail, and so forth, but she never lost her head.  Finally, she came to a mole-hole that suited her.  The other burrows had all turned out to be field-mouse holes, leading ultimately into a main tunnel that ran the whole length of the hedge apparently, and was a public way for all the little whiskered ones.  But this tunnel, bored by the miner mole, ran nowhither, having caved in not far from the entrance, and was very sound of construction, with a nice dry slope. She selected a wide spot where the tunnel branched, each branch forming a _cul-de-sac_.  Here she slew swiftly several suspicious-looking little tawny beetles and one field-cricket, who put up a rare good fight for it, found loafing about the place.  It pleased the queen that here, in this spot, she would found her a city.  But first she must, as it were, take the latitude and the longitude of this her stronghold to be.  She must know where her city was, must make absolutely dead sure, certain, of finding it again when she went out.  Otherwise, if she lost it--well, there would be an end to it before it had begun, so to speak.  For this purpose, therefore, she rose slowly, humming to herself some royal incantation--rose, upon a gradually widening corkscrew spiral, into the air.  She was, in point of fact, surveying the district round her capital to be, marking each point--bush, stone, grass-tuft, tree-trunk, flower-cluster, clod, branch, anything and everything, great and small--and jotting down in indelible memory fluid, upon whatever she kept for a brain, just precisely the position of every landmark.  And as she rose her circles ever widened, so that at last her big compound eyes took in quite a big stretch of sunlit picture, to be photographed upon her memory, and there remain forevermore.  It took her some time, for it was some job; but once done, it was done for good.  Next, alighting with great hustle--now that the work was once begun--the queen ran into her tunnel, and made sure that nobody had \"jumped her claim\" in the interval.  She found an ant, red and ravenous, taking too professional an interest in the place, and she abolished that ant with one nip; though, as you may be sure, the tiny insect fought like a bulldog.  Then she executed a shallow excavation upon the site of the future city itself, carrying each pellet of earth outside beyond the entrance. This also took time, though she worked at fever-pitch, almost with fury; but she managed to finish it, and fly away into the landscape in a remarkably short while, considering.  Here once again she appeared to be searching for something through the yellow sunshine and the falling blossom-petals--confetti from Spring's wedding.  And presently she found it, or seemed to--an old gate, off its hinges.  But the wood was rotting, and she was no fool.  She knew her job--the job she had never done before, by the way--and after humming around it in a fretful, undecided sort of fashion for some while, she flew on.  Apparently she was looking for wood, but not _any_ wood.  Cut wood appeared to be her desire, and that oak; at least, she put behind her a deal board lying half-overgrown, after one careful professional inspection.  Her way was through a perilous world, beset by a thousand foes, mostly in the nature of traps and lines and barbed-wire entanglements set by spiders.  As a rule you didn't see these last at all--nor did she; but her yellow-and-black badge usually won her a way of respect--and hate--and she cut or struggled herself clear of such web-lines as her feelers failed to spot in time.  At last she found some real oak rails, and set to work upon them at once, planing with her sharp shear-jaws.  A tiger-beetle, gaudy and hungry-eyed, sought to pounce upon her in this task.  He was long-legged, and keen, and lean, and very swift; but she shot"]]]
