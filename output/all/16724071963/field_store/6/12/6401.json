She expects me to find evidence to that effect while I'm at Rosemont, going over the collection. I'm not excluding other possibilities, but I'll work on that line until and unless I find out differently. Five thousand should cover both jobs.\"  \"You think that's how it is?\" Kathie asked.  \"Look, Kathie. I got just as far in Arithmetic, at school, as you did, and I suspect that Mrs. Fleming got at least as far as long division, herself. For reasons I stated, I simply couldn't have handled that collection business for anything like a reasonable fee, so I told her five thousand, thinking that would stop her. When it didn't, I knew she had something else in mind, and when she went into all that detail about the death of her husband, she as good as told me that was what it was. Now I'm sorry I didn't say ten thousand; I think she'd have bought it at that price just as cheerfully. She thinks Lane Fleming was murdered. Well, on the face of what she told me, so do I.\"  \"All right, Professor; expound,\" Ritter said.  \"You heard what he was supposed to have shot himself with,\" Rand began. \"A Colt-type percussion revolver. You know what they're like. And I know enough about Lane Fleming to know how much experience he had with old arms. I can't believe that he'd buy a pistol without carefully examining it, and I can't believe that he'd bring that thing home and start working on it without seeing the caps on the nipples and the charges in the chambers, if it had been loaded. And if it had been, he would have first taken off the caps, and then taken it apart and drawn the charges. And she says he started working on it as soon as he got home--presumably around five--and then took time out for dinner, and then went back to work on it, and more than half an hour later, there was a shot and he was killed.\" Rand blew a Bronx cheer. \"If that accident had been the McCoy, it would have happened in the first five minutes after he started working on that pistol. No, in the first thirty seconds. And then, when they found him, he had the revolver in his right hand, and an oily rag in his left. I hope both of you noticed that little touch.\"  \"Yeah. When I clean a gat, I generally have it in my left hand, and clean with my right,\" Ritter said.  \"Exactly. And why do you use an oily rag?\" Rand inquired.  Ritter looked at him blankly for a half-second, then grinned ruefully.  \"Damn, I never thought of that,\" he admitted. \"Okay, he was bumped off, all right.\"  \"But you use oily rags on guns,\" Kathie objected. \"I've seen both of you, often enough.\"  \"When we're all through, honey,\" Ritter told her.  \"Yes. When he brought home that revolver, it was in neglected condition,\" Rand said. \"Either surface-rusted, or filthy with gummed oil and dirt. Even if Mrs. Fleming hadn't mentioned that point, the length of time he spent cleaning it would justify such an inference. He would have taken it apart, down to the smallest screw, and cleaned everything carefully, and then put it together again, and then, when he had finished, he would have gone over the surface with an oiled rag, before hanging it on the wall. He would certainly not have surface-oiled it before removing the charges, if there ever were any. I assume the revolver he was found holding, presumably the one with which he was killed, was another one. And I would further assume that the killer wasn't particularly familiar with the subject of firearms, antique, care and maintenance of.\"  \"And with all the hollering and whooping and hysterics-throwing, nobody noticed the switch,\" Ritter finished. \"Wonder what happened to the one he was really cleaning.\"  \"That I may possibly find out,\" Rand said. \"The general incompetence with which this murder was committed gives me plenty of room to hope that it may still be lying around somewhere.\"  \"Well, have you thought that it might just be suicide?\" Kathie asked.  \"I have, very briefly; I dismissed the thought, almost at once,\" Rand told her. \"For two reasons. One, that if it had been suicide, Mrs. Fleming wouldn't want it poked into; she'd be more than willing to let it ride as an accident. And, two, I doubt if a man who prided himself on his gun-knowledge, as Fleming did, would want his self-shooting to be taken for an accident. I'm damn sure I wouldn't want my friends to go around saying: 'What a dope; didn't know it was loaded!' I doubt if he'd even expect people to believe that it had been an accident.\" He shook his head. \"No, the only inference I can draw is that somebody murdered Fleming, and then faked evidence intended to indicate an accident.\" He rose. \"I'll be back, in a little; think it over, while I'm gone.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Carter Tipton had his law-office on the floor above the Tri-State Detective Agency. He handled all Rand's not infrequent legal involvements, and Rand did all his investigating and witness-chasing; annually, they compared books to see who owed whom how much. Tipton was about five years Rand's junior, and had been in the Navy during the war. He was frequently described as New Belfast's leading younger attorney and most eligible bachelor. His dark, conservatively cut clothes fitted him as though they had been sprayed on, he wore gold-rimmed glasses, and he was so freshly barbered, manicured, valeted and scrubbed as to give the impression that he had been born in cellophane and just unwrapped. He leaned back in his chair and waved his visitor to a seat.  \"Tip, do you know anything about this Fleming family, out at Rosemont?\" Rand began, getting out his pipe and tobacco.  \"The Premix-Foods Flemings?\" Tipton asked. \"Yes, a little. Which one of them wants you to frame what on which other one?\"  \"That'll do for a good, simplified description, to start with,\" Rand commented. \"Why, my client is Mrs. Gladys Fleming. As to what she wants....\"  He told the young lawyer about his recent interview and subsequent conclusions.  \"So you see,\" he finished, \"she won't commit herself, even with me. Maybe she thinks I have more official status, and more obligations to the police, than I have. Maybe she isn't sure in her own mind, and wants me to see, independently, if there's any smell of something dead in the woodpile. Or, she may think that having a private detective called in may throw a scare into somebody. Or maybe she thinks somebody may be fixing up an accident for her, next, and she wants a pistol-totin' gent in the house for a while. Or any combination thereof. Personally, I deplore these clients who hire you to do one thing and expect you to do another, but with five grand for sweetening, I can take them.\"  \"Yes. You know, I've heard rumors of suicide, but this is the first whiff of murder I've caught.\" He hesitated slightly. \"I must say, I'm not greatly surprised. Lane Fleming's death was very convenient to a number of people. You know about this Premix Company, don't you?\"  \"Vaguely. They manufacture ready-mixed pancake flour, and ready-mixed ice-cream and pudding powders, and this dehydrated vegetable soup--pour on hot water, stir, and serve--don't they? My colored boy, Buck, got some of the soup, once, for an experiment. We unanimously voted not to try it again.\"  \"They put out quite a line of such godsends to the neophyte in the kitchen, the popularity of which is reflected in a steadily rising divorce-rate,\" Tipton said. \"They advertise very extensively, including half an hour of tear-jerking drama on a national hookup during soap-opera time. Your client, the former Gladys Farrand, was on the air for Premix for a couple of years; that's how Lane Fleming first met her.\"  \"So you think some irate and dyspeptic husband went to the source of his woes?\" Rand inquired.  \"Well, not exactly. You see, Premix is only Little Business, as the foods industry goes, but they have something very sweet. So sweet, in fact, that one of the really big fellows, National Milling & Packaging, has been going to rather extreme lengths to effect a merger. Mill-Pack, par 100, is quoted at around 145, and Premix, par 50, is at 75 now, and Mill-Pack is offering a two-for-one-share exchange, which would be a little less than four-for-one in value. I might add, for what it's worth, that this Stephen Gresham you mentioned is Mill-Pack's attorney, negotiator, and general Mr. Fixit; he has been trying to put over this merger for Mill-Pack.\"  \"I'll bear that in mind, too,\" Rand said.  \"Naturally, all this is not being shouted from the housetops,\" Tipton continued. \"Fact is, it's a minor infraction of ethics for me to mention it to you.\"  \"I'll file it in the burn-box,\" Rand promised. \"What was the matter; didn't Premix want to merge?\"  \"Lane Fleming didn't. And since he held fifty-two per cent of the common stock himself, try and do anything about it.\"  \"Anything short of retiring Fleming to the graveyard, that is,\" Rand amended. \"That would do for a murder-motive, very nicely.... What were Fleming's objections to the merger?\"  \"Mainly sentimental. Premix was his baby, or, at least, his kid brother. His father started mixing pancake flour back before the First World War, and Lane Fleming peddled it off a spring wagon. They worked up a nice little local trade, and finally a state-wide wholesale business. They incorporated in the early twenties, and then, after the old man died, Lane Fleming hired an advertising agency to promote his products, and built up a national distribution, and took on some sidelines. Then, during the late Mr. Chamberlain's 'Peace in our time,' he picked up a refugee Czech chemist and foods-expert named Anton Varcek, who whipped up a lot of new products. So business got better and better, and they made more money to spend on advertising to get more money to buy more advertising to make more money, like Bill Nye's Puritans digging clams in the winter to get strength to hoe corn in the summer to get strength to dig clams in the winter.  \"So Premix became a sort of symbol of achievement to Fleming. Then, he was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],["title","Murder in the Gunroom (#3)"],["body","of these old-model paternalistic employers, and he was afraid that if he relinquished control, a lot of his old retainers would be turned out to grass. And finally, he was opposed in principle to concentration of business ownership. He claimed it made business more vulnerable to government control and eventual socialization.\"  \"I'm not sure he didn't have something there,\" Rand considered. \"We get all our corporate eggs in a few baskets, and they're that much easier for the planned-economy boys to grab.... Just who, on the Premix side, was in favor of this merger?\"  \"Just about everybody but Fleming,\" Tipton replied. \"His two sons-in-law, Fred Dunmore and Varcek, who are first and second vice presidents. Humphrey Goode, the company attorney, who doubles as board chairman. All the directors. All the New York banking crowd who are interested in Premix. And all the two-share tinymites. I don't know who inherits Fleming's voting interest, but I can find out for you by this time tomorrow.\"  \"Do that, Tip, and bill me for what you think finding out is worth,\" Rand said. \"It'll be a novel reversal of order for you to be billing me for an investigation.... Now, how about the family, as distinct from the company?\"  \"Well, there's your client, Gladys Fleming. She married Lane Fleming about ten years ago, when she was twenty-five and he was fifty-five. In spite of the age difference, I understand it was a fairly happy marriage. Then, there are two daughters by a previous marriage, Nelda Dunmore and Geraldine Varcek, and their respective husbands. They all live together, in a big house at Rosemont. In the company, Dunmore is Sales, and Varcek is Production. They each have a corner of the mantle of Lane Fleming in one hand and a dirk in the other. Nelda and Geraldine hate each other like Greeks and Trojans. Nelda is the nymphomaniac sister, and Geraldine is the dipsomaniac. From time to time, temporary alliances get formed, mainly against Gladys; all of them resent the way she married herself into a third-interest in the estate. You're going to have yourself a nice, pleasant little stay in the country.\"  \"I'm looking forward to it.\" Rand grimaced. \"You mentioned suicide rumors. Such as, and who's been spreading them?\"  \"Oh, they are the usual bodyless voices that float about,\" Tipton told him. \"Emanating, I suspect, from sources interested in shaking out the less sophisticated small shareholders before the merger. The story is always approximately the same: That Lane Fleming saw his company drifting reefward, was unwilling to survive the shipwreck, and performed _seppuku_. The family are supposed to have faked up the accident afterward. I dismiss the whole thing as a rather less than subtle bit of market-manipulation chicanery.\"  \"Or a smoke screen, to cover the defects in camouflaging a murder as an accident,\" Rand added.  Tipton nodded. \"That could be so, too,\" he agreed. \"Say somebody dislikes the looks of that accident, and starts investigating. Then he runs into all this miasma of suicide rumors, and promptly shrugs the whole thing off. Fleming killed himself, and the family made a few alterations and are passing it off as an accident. The families of suicides have been known to do that.\"  \"Yes. Regular defense-in-depth system; if the accident line is penetrated, the suicide line is back of it,\" Rand said. \"Well, in the last few years, we've seen defenses in depth penetrated with monotonous regularity. I've jeeped through a couple, myself, to interrogate the surviving ex-defenders. It's all in having the guns and armor to smash through with.\"     CHAPTER 3   Humphrey Goode was sixty-ish, short and chunky, with a fringe of white hair around a bald crown. His brow was corrugated with wrinkles, and he peered suspiciously at Rand through a pair of thick-lensed, black-ribboned glasses. His wide mouth curved downward at the corners in an expression that was probably intended to be stern and succeeded only in being pompous. His office was dark, and smelled of dusty books.  \"Mr. Rand,\" he began accusingly, \"when your secretary called to make this appointment, she informed me that you had been retained by Mrs. Gladys Fleming.\"  \"That's correct.\" Rand slowly packed tobacco into his pipe and lit it. \"Mrs. Fleming wants me to look after some interests of hers, and as you're executor of her late husband's estate, I thought I ought to talk to you, first of all.\"  Goode's eyes narrowed behind the thick glasses.  \"Mr. Rand, if you're investigating the death of Lane Fleming, you're wasting your time and Mrs. Fleming's money,\" he lectured. \"There is nothing whatever for you to find out that is not already public knowledge. Mr. Fleming was accidentally killed by the discharge of an old revolver he was cleaning. I don't know what foolish feminine impulse led Mrs. Fleming to employ you, but you'll do nobody any good in this matter, and you may do a great deal of harm.\"  \"Did my secretary tell you I was making an investigation?\" Rand demanded incredulously. \"She doesn't usually make mistakes of that sort.\"  The wrinkles moved up Goode's brow like a battalion advancing in platoon front. He looked even more narrowly at Rand, his suspicion compounded with bewilderment.  \"Why should I investigate the death of Lane Fleming?\" Rand continued. \"As far as I know, Mrs. Fleming is satisfied that it was an accident. She never expressed any other belief to me. Do you think it was anything else?\"  \"Why, of course not!\" Goode exclaimed. \"That's just what I was telling you. I--\" He took a fresh start. \"There have been rumors--utterly without foundation, of course--that Mr. Fleming committed suicide. They are, I may say, nothing but malicious fabrications, circulated for the purpose of undermining public confidence in Premix Foods, Incorporated. I had thought that perhaps Mrs. Fleming might have heard them, and decided, on her own responsibility, to bring you in to scotch them; I was afraid that such a step might, by giving these rumors fresh currency, defeat its intended purpose.\"  \"Oh, nothing of the sort!\" Rand told him. \"I'm not in the least interested in how Mr. Fleming was killed, and the question is simply not involved in what Mrs. Fleming wants me to do.\"  He stopped there. Goode was looking at him sideways, sucking in one corner of his mouth and pushing out the other. It was not a facial contortion that impressed Rand favorably; it was too reminiscent of a high-school principal under whom he had suffered, years ago, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Rand began to suspect that Goode might be just another such self-righteous, opinionated, egotistical windbag. Such men could be dangerous, were usually quite unscrupulous, and were almost always unpleasant to deal with.  \"Then why,\" the lawyer demanded, \"did Mrs. Fleming employ you?\"  \"Well, as you know,\" Rand began, \"the Fleming pistol-collection, now the joint property of Mrs. Fleming and her two stepdaughters, is an extremely valuable asset. Mr. Fleming spent the better part of his life gathering it. At one time or another, he must have owned between four and five thousand different pistols and revolvers. The twenty-five hundred left to his heirs represent the result of a systematic policy of discriminating purchase, replacement of inferior items, and general improvement. It's one of the largest and most famous collections of its kind in the country.\"  \"Well?\" Goode was completely out of his depth by now. \"Surely Mrs. Fleming doesn't think...?\"  \"Mrs. Fleming thinks that expert advice is urgently needed in disposing of that collection,\" Rand replied, carefully picking his words to fit what he estimated to be Goode's probable semantic reactions. \"She has the utmost confidence in your ability and integrity, as an attorney; however, she realized that you could hardly describe yourself as an antique-arms expert. It happens that I am an expert in antique firearms, particularly pistols. I have a collection of my own, I am the author of a number of articles on the subject, and I am recognized as something of an authority. I know arms-values, and understand market conditions. Furthermore, not being a dealer, or connected with any museum, I have no mercenary motive for undervaluing the collection. That's all there is to it; Mrs. Fleming has retained me as a firearms-expert, in connection with the collection.\"  Goode was looking at Rand as though the latter had just torn off a mask, revealing another and entirely different set of features underneath. The change seemed to be a welcome one, but he was evidently having trouble adjusting to it. Rand grinned inwardly; now he was going to have to find himself a new set of verbal labels and identifications.  \"Well, Mr. Rand, that alters the situation considerably,\" he said, with noticeably less hostility. He was still a bit resentful; people had no right to confuse him by jumping about from one category to another, like that. \"Now understand, I'm not trying to be offensive, but it seems a little unusual for a private detective also to be an authority on antique firearms.\"  \"Mr. Fleming was an authority on antique firearms, and he was a manufacturer of foodstuffs,\" Rand parried, carefully staying inside Goode's Aristotelian system of categories and verbal identifications. \"My own business does not occupy all my time, any more than his did, and I doubt if an interest in the history and development of deadly weapons is any more incongruous in a criminologist than in an industrialist. But if there's any doubt in your mind as to my qualifications, you can check with Colonel Taylor, at the State Museum, or with the editor of the _American Rifleman_.\"  \"I see.\" Goode nodded. \"And as you point out, being a sort of non-professional expert, you should be free from mercenary bias.\" He nodded again, taking off his glasses and polishing them on an outsize white handkerchief. \"Frankly, now that I understand your purpose, Mr. Rand, I must say that I am quite glad that Mrs. Fleming"]]]
