It can make the perceptive sense more impressible to the influence of the music; it can quicken the fancy, and fire the imagination; it can prevent a gross misconception of the intentions of a composer and the character of his composition. Nevertheless, in determining the artistic value of the work, the question goes not to the ingenuity of the programme or the clearness with which its suggestions have been carried out, but to the beauty of the music itself irrespective of the verbal commentary accompanying it. This rule must be maintained in order to prevent a degradation of the object of musical expression. The vile, the ugly, the painful are not fit subjects for music; music renounces, contravenes, negatives itself when it attempts their delineation.  A classification of Programme music might be made on these lines:  [Sidenote: _Kinds of Programme music._]  I. Descriptive pieces which rest on imitation or suggestion of natural sounds.  II. Pieces whose contents are purely musical, but the mood of which is suggested by a poetical title.  III. Pieces in which the influence which determined their form and development is indicated not only by a title but also by a motto which is relied upon to mark out a train of thought for the listener which will bring his fancy into union with that of the composer. The motto may be verbal or pictorial.  IV. Symphonies or other composite works which have a title to indicate their general character, supplemented by explanatory superscriptions for each portion.  [Sidenote: _Imitation of natural sounds._]  [Sidenote: _The nightingale._]  [Sidenote: _The cat._]  [Sidenote: _The cuckoo._]  The first of these divisions rests upon the employment of the lowest form of conventional musical idiom. The material which the natural world provides for imitation by the musician is exceedingly scant. Unless we descend to mere noise, as in the descriptions of storms and battles (the shrieking of the wind, the crashing of thunder, and the roar of artillery--invaluable aids to the cheap descriptive writer), we have little else than the calls of a few birds. Nearly thirty years ago Wilhelm Tappert wrote an essay which he called \"Zooplastik in Tönen.\" He ransacked the musical literature of centuries, but in all his examples the only animals the voices of which are unmistakable are four fowls--the cuckoo, quail (that is the German bird, not the American, which has a different call), the cock, and the hen. He has many descriptive sounds which suggest other birds and beasts, but only by association of idea; separated from title or text they suggest merely what they are--musical phrases. A reiteration of the rhythmical figure called the \"Scotch snap,\" breaking gradually into a trill, is the common symbol of the nightingale's song, but it is not a copy of that song; three or four tones descending chromatically are given as the cat's mew, but they are made to be such only by placing the syllables _Mi-au_ (taken from the vocabulary of the German cat) under them. Instances of this kind might be called characterization, or description by suggestion, and some of the best composers have made use of them, as will appear in these pages presently. The list being so small, and the lesson taught so large, it may be well to give a few striking instances of absolutely imitative music. The first bird to collaborate with a composer seems to have been the cuckoo, whose notes  [Music illustration: Cuck-oo!]  had sounded in many a folk-song ere Beethoven thought of enlisting the little solo performer in his \"Pastoral\" symphony. It is to be borne in mind, however, as a fact having some bearing on the artistic value of Programme music, that Beethoven's cuckoo changes his note to please the musician, and, instead of singing a minor third, he sings a major third thus:  [Music illustration: Cuck-oo!]  [Sidenote: _Cock and hen._]  As long ago as 1688 Jacob Walter wrote a musical piece entitled \"Gallina et Gallo,\" in which the hen was delineated in this theme:  [Music illustration: _Gallina._]  while the cock had the upper voice in the following example, his clear challenge sounding above the cackling of his mate:  [Music illustration: _Gallo._]  The most effective use yet made of the song of the hen, however, is in \"La Poule,\" one of Rameau's \"Pièces de Clavecin,\" printed in 1736, a delightful composition with this subject:  [Music illustration: Co co co co co co co dai, etc.]  [Sidenote: _The quail._]  The quail's song is merely a monotonic rhythmical figure to which German fancy has fitted words of pious admonition:  [Music illustration: Fürch-te Gott! Lo-be Gott!]  [Sidenote: _Conventional idioms._]  [Sidenote: _Association of ideas._]  [Sidenote: _Fancy and imagination._]  [Sidenote: _Harmony and emotionality._]  The paucity of examples in this department is a demonstration of the statement made elsewhere that nature does not provide music with models for imitation as it does painting and sculpture. The fact that, nevertheless, we have come to recognize a large number of idioms based on association of ideas stands the composer in good stead whenever he ventures into the domain of delineative or descriptive music, and this he can do without becoming crudely imitative. Repeated experiences have taught us to recognize resemblances between sequences or combinations of tones and things or ideas, and on these analogies, even though they be purely conventional (that is agreed upon, as we have agreed that a nod of the head shall convey assent, a shake of the head dissent, and a shrug of the shoulders doubt or indifference), the composers have built up a voluminous vocabulary of idioms which need only to be helped out by a suggestion to the mind to be eloquently illustrative. \"Sometimes hearing a melody or harmony arouses an emotion like that aroused by the contemplation of a thing. Minor harmonies, slow movements, dark tonal colorings, combine directly to put a musically susceptible person in a mood congenial to thoughts of sorrow and death; and, inversely, the experience of sorrow, or the contemplation of death, creates affinity for minor harmonies, slow movements, and dark tonal colorings. Or we recognize attributes in music possessed also by things, and we consort the music and the things, external attributes bringing descriptive music into play, which excites the fancy, internal attributes calling for an exercise of the loftier faculty, imagination, to discern their meaning.\"[B] The latter kind is delineative music of the higher order, the kind that I have called idealized programme music, for it is the imagination which, as Ruskin has said, \"sees the heart and inner nature and makes them felt, but is often obscure, mysterious, and interrupted in its giving out of outer detail,\" which is \"a seer in the prophetic sense, calling the things that are not as though they were, and forever delighting to dwell on that which is not tangibly present.\" In this kind of music, harmony, the real seat of emotionality in music, is an eloquent factor, and, indeed, there is no greater mystery in the art, which is full of mystery, than the fact that the lowering of the second tone in the chord, which is the starting-point of harmony, should change an expression of satisfaction, energetic action, or jubilation into an accent of pain or sorrow. The major mode is \"to do,\" the minor, \"to suffer:\"  [Sidenote: _Major and minor._]  [Music illustration: Hur-rah! A-las!]  [Sidenote: _Music and movement._]  How near a large number of suggestions, which are based wholly upon experience or association of ideas, lie to the popular fancy, might be illustrated by scores of examples. Thoughts of religious functions arise in us the moment we hear the trombones intone a solemn phrase in full harmony; an oboe melody in sixth-eighth time over a drone bass brings up a pastoral picture of a shepherd playing upon his pipe; trumpets and drums suggest war, and so on. The delineation of movement is easier to the musician than it is to the poet. Handel, who has conveyed the sensation of a \"darkness which might be felt,\" in a chorus of his \"Israel in Egypt,\" by means which appeal solely to the imagination stirred by feelings, has in the same work pictured the plague of frogs with a frank _naïveté_ which almost upsets our seriousness of demeanor, by suggesting the characteristic movement of the creatures in the instrumental accompaniment to the arioso, \"Their land brought forth frogs,\" which begins thus:  [Sidenote: _Handel's frogs._]  [Music illustration]  [Sidenote: _The movement of water._]  We find the gentle flux and reflux of water as if it were lapping a rocky shore in the exquisite figure out of which Mendelssohn constructed his \"Hebrides\" overture:  [Music illustration]  and in fancy we ride on mighty surges when we listen to the principal subject of Rubinstein's \"Ocean\" symphony:  [Music illustration]  In none of these instances can the composer be said to be imitative. Music cannot copy water, but it can do what water does, and so suggest water.  [Sidenote: _High and low._]  Some of the most common devices of composers are based on conceptions that are wholly arbitrary. A musical tone cannot have position in space such as is indicated by high or low, yet so familiar is the association of acuteness of pitch with height, and gravity of pitch with depth, that composers continually delineate high things with acute tones and low things with grave tones, as witness Handel in one of the choruses of \"The Messiah:\"  [Music illustration: Glo-ry to God in the high-est, and peace on earth.]  [Sidenote: _Ascent, descent, and distance delineated._]  Similarly, too, does Beethoven describe the ascent into heaven and the descent into hell in the Credo of his mass in D. Beethoven's music, indeed, is full of tone-painting, and because it exemplifies a double device I make room for one more illustration. It is from the cantata \"Becalmed at Sea, and a Prosperous"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],["title","How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#7)"],["body","yage,\" and in it the composer pictures the immensity of the sea by a sudden, extraordinary spreading out of his harmonies, which is musical, and dwelling a long time on the word \"distance\" (_Weite_) which is rhetorical:  [Music illustration: In der un-ge-heu-'ren Wei-te.]  [Sidenote: _Bald imitation bad art._]  [Sidenote: _Vocal music and delineation._]  [Sidenote: _Beethoven's canon._]  The extent to which tone-painting is justified is a question which might profitably concern us; but such a discussion as it deserves would far exceed the limits set for this book, and must be foregone. It cannot be too forcibly urged, however, as an aid to the listener, that efforts at musical cartooning have never been made by true composers, and that in the degree that music attempts simply to copy external things it falls in the scale of artistic truthfulness and value. Vocal music tolerates more of the descriptive element than instrumental because it is a mixed art; in it the purpose of music is to illustrate the poetry and, by intensifying the appeal to the fancy, to warm the emotions. Every piece of vocal music, moreover, carries its explanatory programme in its words. Still more tolerable and even righteous is it in the opera where it is but one of several factors which labor together to make up the sum of dramatic representation. But it must ever remain valueless unless it be idealized. Mendelssohn, desiring to put _Bully Bottom_ into the overture to \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" did not hesitate to use tones which suggest the bray of a donkey, yet the effect, like Handel's frogs and flies in \"Israel,\" is one of absolute musical value. The canon which ought continually to be before the mind of the listener is that which Beethoven laid down with most painstaking care when he wrote the \"Pastoral\" symphony. Desiring to inform the listeners what were the images which inspired the various movements (in order, of course, that they might the better enter into the work by recalling them), he gave each part a superscription thus:  [Sidenote: _The \"Pastoral\" symphony._]       I. \"The agreeable and cheerful sensations awakened by      arrival in the country.\"       II. \"Scene by the brook.\"       III. \"A merrymaking of the country folk.\"       IV. \"Thunder-storm.\"       V. \"Shepherds' song--feelings of charity combined with      gratitude to the Deity after the storm.\"  In the title itself he included an admonitory explanation which should have everlasting validity: \"Pastoral Symphony; more expression of feeling than painting.\" How seriously he thought on the subject we know from his sketch-books, in which occur a number of notes, some of which were evidently hints for superscriptions, some records of his convictions on the subject of descriptive music. The notes are reprinted in Nottebohm's \"Zweite Beethoveniana,\" but I borrow Sir George Grove's translation:  [Sidenote: _Beethoven's notes on descriptive music._]       \"The hearers should be allowed to discover the situations.\"       \"Sinfonia caracteristica, or a recollection of country      life.\"       \"All painting in instrumental music, if pushed too far, is a      failure.\"       \"Sinfonia pastorella. Anyone who has an idea of country life      can make out for himself the intentions of the author      without many titles.\"       \"People will not require titles to recognize the general      intention to be more a matter of feeling than of painting in      sounds.\"       \"Pastoral symphony: No picture, but something in which the      emotions are expressed which are aroused in men by the      pleasure of the country (or), in which some feelings of      country life are set forth.\"[C]  As to the relation of programme to music Schumann laid down an admirable maxim when he said that while good music was not harmed by a descriptive title it was a bad indication if a composition needed one.  [Sidenote: _Classic and Romantic._]  There are, among all the terms used in music, no words of vaguer meaning than Classic and Romantic. The idea which they convey most widely in conjunction is that of antithesis. When the Romantic School of composers is discussed it is almost universally presented as something opposed in character to the Classical School. There is little harm in this if we but bear in mind that all the terms which have come into use to describe different phases of musical development are entirely artificial and arbitrary--that they do not stand for anything absolute, but only serve as platforms of observation. If the terms had a fixed meaning we ought to be able, since they have established themselves in the language of history and criticism, to describe unambiguously and define clearly the boundary which separates them. This, however, is impossible. Each generation, nay, each decade, fixes the meaning of the words for itself and decides what works shall go into each category. It ought to be possible to discover a principle, a touchstone, which shall emancipate us from the mischievous and misleading notions that have so long prompted men to make the partitions between the schools out of dates and names.  [Sidenote: _Trench's definition of \"classical.\"_]  The terms were borrowed from literary criticism; but even there, in the words of Archbishop Trench, \"they either say nothing at all or say something erroneous.\" Classical has more to defend it than Romantic, because it has greater antiquity and, in one sense, has been used with less arbitrariness.       \"The term,\" says Trench, \"is drawn from the political      economy of Rome. Such a man was rated as to his income in      the third class, such another in the fourth, and so on, and      he who was in the highest was emphatically said to be of the      class, _classicus_, a class man, without adding the number      as in that case superfluous; while all others were _infra      classem_. Hence by an obvious analogy the best authors were      rated as _classici_, or men of the highest class; just as in      English we say 'men of rank' absolutely for men who are in      the highest ranks of the State.\"  Thus Trench, and his historical definition, explains why in music also there is something more than a lurking suggestion of excellence in the conception of \"classical;\" but that fact does not put away the quarrel which we feel exists between Classic and Romantic.  [Sidenote: _Romantic in literature._]  [Sidenote: _Schumann and Jean Paul._]  [Sidenote: _Weber's operas._]  [Sidenote: _Mendelssohn._]  As applied to literature Romantic was an adjective affected by certain poets, first in Germany, then in France, who wished to introduce a style of thought and expression different from that of those who followed old models. Intrinsically, of course, the term does not imply any such opposition but only bears witness to the source from which the poets drew their inspiration. This was the imaginative literature of the Middle Ages, the fantastical stories of chivalry and knighthood written in the Romance, or Romanic languages, such as Italian, Spanish, and Provençal. The principal elements of these stories were the marvellous and the supernatural. The composers whose names first spring into our minds when we think of the Romantic School are men like Mendelssohn and Schumann, who drew much of their inspiration from the young writers of their time who were making war on stilted rhetoric and conventionalism of phrase. Schumann touches hands with the Romantic poets in their strivings in two directions. His artistic conduct, especially in his early years, is inexplicable if Jean Paul be omitted from the equation. His music rebels against the formalism which had held despotic sway over the art, and also seeks to disclose the beauty which lies buried in the world of mystery in and around us, and give expression to the multitude of emotions to which unyielding formalism had refused adequate utterance. This, I think, is the chief element of Romanticism. Another has more of an external nature and genesis, and this we find in the works of such composers as Von Weber, who is Romantic chiefly in his operas, because of the supernaturalism and chivalry in their stories, and Mendelssohn, who, while distinctly Romantic in many of his strivings, was yet so great a master of form, and so attached to it, that the Romantic side of him was not fully developed.  [Sidenote: _A definition of \"Classical\" in music._]  [Sidenote: _The creative and conservative principles._]  [Sidenote: _Musical laws of necessity progressive._]  [Sidenote: _Bach and Romanticism._]  [Sidenote: _Creation and conservation._]  If I were to attempt a definition it would be this: Classical composers are those of the first rank (to this extent we yield to the ancient Roman conception) who have developed music to the highest pitch of perfection on its formal side and, in obedience to generally accepted laws, preferring æsthetic beauty, pure and simple, over emotional content, or, at any rate, refusing to sacrifice form to characteristic expression. Romantic composers are those who have sought their ideals in other regions and striven to give expression to them irrespective of the restrictions and limitations of form and the conventions of law--composers with whom, in brief, content outweighs manner. This definition presents Classicism as the regulative and conservative principle in the history of the art, and Romanticism as the progressive, regenerative, and creative principle. It is easy to see how the notion of contest between them grew up, and the only harm which can come from such a notion will ensue only if we shut our eyes to the fact that it is a contest between two elements whose very opposition stimulates life, and whose union, perfect, peaceful, mutually supplemental, is found in every really great art-work. No law which fixes, and hence limits, form, can remain valid forever. Its end is served when it enforces itself long enough to keep lawlessness in check till the test of time"]]]
