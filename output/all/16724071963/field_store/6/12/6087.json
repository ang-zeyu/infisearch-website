We shall see.”  And without a shadow of hesitation, for it seems to be the privilege of police-agents to be at home everywhere, he crossed the parlor, and reached Mlle. Gilberte’s room just as she was withdrawing from the window.  “Ah, it is that way he escaped!” he exclaimed.  He rushed to the window, and remained long enough leaning on his elbows to thoroughly examine the ground, and understand the situation of the apartment.  “It’s evident,” he said at last, “this window opens on the courtyard of the next house.”  This was said to one of his agents, who bore an unmistakable resemblance to the servant who had been asking so many questions in the afternoon.  “Instead of gathering so much useless information,” he added, “why did you not post yourself as to the outlets of the house?”  He was “sold”; and yet he manifested neither spite nor anger.  He seemed in no wise anxious to run after the fugitive.  Upon the features of Maxence and of Mlle. Gilberte, and more still in Mme. Favoral’s eyes, he had read that it would be useless for the present.  “Let us examine the papers, then,” said he.  “My husband’s papers are all in his study,” replied Mme. Favoral.  “Please lead me to it, madame.”  The room which M. Favoral called loftily his study was a small room with a tile floor, white-washed walls, and meanly lighted through a narrow transom.  It was furnished with an old desk, a small wardrobe with grated door, a few shelves upon which were piled some bandboxes and bundles of old newspapers, and two or three deal chairs.  “Where are the keys?” inquired the commissary of police.  “My father always carries them in his pocket, sir,” replied Maxence.  “Then let some one go for a locksmith.”  Stronger than fear, curiosity had drawn all the guests of the cashier of the Mutual Credit Society, M. Desormeaux, M. Chapelain, M. Desclavettes himself; and, standing within the door-frame, they followed eagerly every motion of the commissary, who, pending the arrival of the locksmith, was making a flying examination of the bundles of papers left exposed upon the desk.  After a while, and unable to hold in any longer:  “Would it be indiscreet,” timidly inquired the old bronze-merchant, “to ask the nature of the charges against that poor Favoral?”  “Embezzlement, sir.”  “And is the amount large?”  “Had it been small, I should have said theft.  Embezzling commences only when the sum has reached a round figure.”  Annoyed at the sardonic tone of the commissary:  “The fact is,” resumed M. Chapelain, “Favoral was our friend; and, if we could get him out of the scrape, we would all willingly contribute.”  “It’s a matter of ten or twelve millions, gentlemen.”  Was it possible?  Was it even likely?  Could any one imagine so many millions slipping through the fingers of M. de Thaller’s methodic cashier?  “Ah, sir!” exclaimed Mme. Favoral, “if any thing could relieve my feelings, the enormity of that sum would.  My husband was a man of simple and modest tastes.”  The commissary shook his head.  “There are certain passions,” he interrupted, “which nothing betrays externally.  Gambling is more terrible than fire.  After a fire, some charred remnants are found.  What is there left after a lost game? Fortunes may be thrown into the vortex of the bourse, without a trace of them being left.”  The unfortunate woman was not convinced.  “I could swear, sir,” she protested, “that I knew how my husband spent every hour of his life.”  “Do not swear, madame.”  “All our friends will tell you how parsimonious my husband was.”  “Here, madame, towards yourself and your children, I have no doubt; for seeing is believing: but elsewhere--”  He was interrupted by the arrival of the locksmith, who, in less than five minutes, had picked all the locks of the old desk.  But in vain did the commissary search all the drawers.  He found only those useless papers which are made relics of by people who have made order their religious faith,--uninteresting letters, grocers’ and butchers’ bills running back twenty years.  “It is a waste of time to look for any thing here,” he growled.  And in fact he was about to give up his perquisitions, when a bundle thinner than the rest attracted his attention.  He cut the thread that bound it; and almost at once:  “I knew I was right,” he said.  And holding out a paper to Mme. Favoral:  “Read, madame, if you please.”  It was a bill.  She read thus:     “Sold to M. Favoral an India Cashmere, fr. 8,500.     Received payment,           FORBE & TOWLER.”  “Is it for you, madame,” asked the commissary, “that this magnificent shawl was bought?”  Stupefied with astonishment, the poor woman still refused to admit the evidence.  “Madame de Thaller spends a great deal,” she stammered.  “My husband often made important purchases for her account.”  “Often, indeed!” interrupted the commissary of police; “for here are many other receipted bills,--earrings, sixteen thousand francs; a bracelet, three thousand francs; a parlor set, a horse, two velvet dresses.  Here is a part, at least, if not the whole, of the ten millions.”    V  Had the commissary received any information in advance? or was he guided only by the scent peculiar to men of his profession, and the habit of suspecting every thing, even that which seems most unlikely?  At any rate he expressed himself in a tone of absolute certainty.  The agents who had accompanied and assisted him in his researches were winking at each other, and giggling stupidly.  The situation struck them as rather pleasant.  The others, M. Desclavettes, M. Chapelain, and the worthy M. Desormeaux himself, could have racked their brains in vain to find terms wherein to express the immensity of their astonishments. Vincent Favoral, their old friend, paying for cashmeres, diamonds, and parlor sets!  Such an idea could not enter in their minds.  For whom could such princely gifts be intended?  For a mistress, for one of those redoubtable creatures whom fancy represents crouching in the depths of love, like monsters at the bottom of their caves!  But how could any one imagine the methodic cashier of the Mutual Credit Society carried away by one of those insane passions which knew no reason?  Ruined by gambling, perhaps, but by a woman!  Could any one picture him, so homely and so plain here, Rue St. Gilles, at the head of another establishment, and leading elsewhere in one of the brilliant quarters of Paris, a reckless life, such as strike terror in the bosom of quiet families?  Could any one understand the same man at once miserly-economical and madly-prodigal, storming when his wife spent a few cents, and robbing to supply the expenses of an adventuress, and collecting in the same drawer the jeweler’s accounts and the butcher’s bills?  “It is the climax of absurdity,” murmured good M. Desormeaux.  Maxence fairly shook with wrath.  Mlle. Gilberte was weeping.  Mme. Favoral alone, usually so timid, boldly defended, and with her utmost energy, the man whose name she bore.  That he might have embezzled millions, she admitted: that he had deceived and betrayed her so shamefully, that he had made a wretched dupe of her for so many years, seemed to her insensate, monstrous, impossible.  And purple with shame:  “Your suspicions would vanish at once, sir,” she said to the commissary, “if I could but explain to you our mode of life.”  Encouraged by his first discovery, he was proceeding more minutely with his perquisitions, undoing the strings of every bundle.  “It is useless, madame,” he answered in that brief tone which made so much impression upon M. Desclavettes.  “You can only tell me what you know; and you know nothing.”  “Never, sir, did a man lead a more regular life than M. Favoral.”  “In appearance, you are right.  Besides, to regulate one’s disorder is one of the peculiarities of our time.  We open credits to our passions, and we keep account of our infamies by double entry.  We operate with method.  We embezzle millions that we may hang diamonds to the ears of an adventuress; but we are careful, and we keep the receipted bills.”  “But, sir, I have already told you that I never lost sight of my husband.”  “Of course.”  “Every morning, precisely at nine o’clock, he left home to go to M. de Thaller’s office.”  “The whole neighborhood knows that, madame.”  “At half-past five he came home.”  “That, also, is a well-known fact.”  “After dinner he went out to play a game, but it was his only amusement; and at eleven o’clock he was always in bed.”  “Perfectly correct.”  “Well, then, sir, where could M. Favoral have found time to abandon himself to the excesses of which you accuse him?”  Imperceptibly the commissary of police shrugged his shoulders.  “Far from me, madame,” he uttered, “to doubt your good faith.  What matters it, moreover, whether your husband spent in this way or in that way the sums which he is charged with having appropriated?  But what do your objections prove?  Simply that M. Favoral was very skillful, and very much self-possessed.  Had he breakfasted when he left you at nine?  No.  Pray, then, where did he breakfast?  In a restaurant?  Which?  Why did he come home only at half-past five, when his office actually closed at three o’clock?  Are you quite sure that it was to the Cafe Turc that he went every evening? Finally, why do not you say anything of the extra work which he always had to attend to, as he pretended, once or twice a month? Sometimes it was a loan, sometimes a liquidation, or a settlement of dividends, which devolved upon him.  Did he come home then?  No. He told you that he would dine out, and that it would be more convenient for him to have a cot put up in his office; and thus you were twenty-four or forty-eight hours without seeing him. Surely this double existence must have weighed heavily upon him; but he was forbidden from breaking off with you, under penalty of being caught the very next day with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1748"],["title","Other People's Money (#4)"],["body","hand in the till.  It is the respectability of his official life here which made the other possible,--that which has absorbed such enormous sums.  The harsher and the closer he were here, the more magnificent he could show himself elsewhere.  His household in the Rue St. Gilles was for him a certificate of impunity.  Seeing him so economical, every one thought him rich.  People who seem to spend nothing are always trusted.  Every privation which he imposed upon you increased his reputation of austere probity, and raised him farther above suspicion.”  Big tears were rolling down Mme. Favoral’s cheeks.  “Why not tell me the whole truth?” she stammered.  “Because I do not know it,” replied the commissary; “because these are all mere presumptions.  I have seen so many instances of similar calculations!”  Then regretting, perhaps, to have said so much,  “But I may be mistaken,” he added: “I do not pretend to be infallible.”  He was just then completing a brief inventory of all the papers found in the old desk.  There was nothing left but to examine the drawer which was used for a cash drawer.  He found in it in gold, notes, and small change, seven hundred and eighteen francs.  Having counted this sum, the commissary offered it to Mme. Favoral, saying,  “This belongs to you madame.”  But instinctively she withdrew her hand.  “Never!” she said.  The commissary went on with a gesture of kindness,--“I understand your scruples, madame, and yet I must insist.  You may believe me when I tell you that this little sum is fairly and legitimately yours.  You have no personal fortune.”  The efforts of the poor woman to keep from bursting into loud sobs were but too visible.  “I possess nothing in the world, sir,” she said in a broken voice. “My husband alone attended to our business-affairs.  He never spoke to me about them; and I would not have dared to question him.  Alone he disposed of our money.  Every Sunday he handed me the amount which he thought necessary for the expenses of the week, and I rendered him an account of it.  When my children or myself were in need of any thing, I told him so, and he gave me what he thought proper.  This is Saturday: of what I received last Sunday I have five francs left: that, is our whole fortune.”  Positively the commissary was moved.  “You see, then, madame,” he said, “that you cannot hesitate: you must live.”  Maxence stepped forward.  “Am I not here, sir?” he said.  The commissary looked at him keenly, and in a grave tone,  “I believe indeed, sir,” he replied, “that you will not suffer your mother and sister to want for any thing.  But resources are not created in a day.  Yours, if I have not been deceived, are more than limited just now.”  And as the young man blushed, and did not answer, he handed the seven hundred francs to Mlle. Gilberte, saying,  “Take this, mademoiselle: your mother permits it.”  His work was done. To place his seals upon M. Favoral’s study was the work of a moment.  Beckoning, then, to his agents to withdraw, and being ready to leave himself,  “Let not the seals cause you any uneasiness, madame,” said the commissary of police to Mme. Favoral.  “Before forty-eight hours, some one will come to remove these papers, and restore to you the free use of that room.”  He went out; and, as soon as the door had closed behind him,  “Well?” exclaimed M. Desormeaux;  But no one had any thing to say.  The guests of that house where misfortune had just entered were making haste to leave.  The catastrophe was certainly terrible and unforeseen; but did it not reach them too?  Did they not lose among them more than three hundred thousand francs?  Thus, after a few commonplace protestations, and some of those promises which mean nothing, they withdrew; and, as they were going down the stairs,  “The commissary took Vincent’s escape too easy,” remarked M. Desormeaux.  “He must know some way to catch him again.”    VI  At last Mme. Favoral found herself alone with her children and free to give herself up to the most frightful despair.  She dropped heavily upon a seat; and, drawing to her bosom Maxence and Gilberte,  “O my children!” she sobbed, covering them with her kisses and her tears,--“my children, we are most unfortunate.”  Not less distressed than herself, they strove, nevertheless, to mitigate her anguish, to inspire her with sufficient courage to bear this crushing trial; and kneeling at her feet, and kissing her hands,  “Are we not with you still, mother?” they kept repeating.  But she seemed not to hear them.  “It is not for myself that I weep,” she went on.  “I! what had I still to wait or hope for in life?  Whilst you, Maxence, you, my poor Gilberte!--If, at least, I could feel myself free from blame! But no.  It is my weakness and my want of courage that have brought on this catastrophe.  I shrank from the struggle.  I purchased my domestic peace at the cost of your future in the world.  I forgot that a mother has sacred duties towards her children.”  Mme. Favoral was at this time a woman of some forty-three years, with delicate and mild features, a countenance overflowing with kindness, and whose whole being exhaled, as it were, an exquisite perfume of _noblesse_ and distinction.  Happy, she might have been beautiful still,--of that autumnal beauty whose maturity has the splendors of the luscious fruits of the later season.  But she had suffered so much!  The livid paleness of her complexion, the rigid fold of her lips, the nervous shudders that shook her frame, revealed a whole existence of bitter deceptions, of exhausting struggles, and of proudly concealed humiliations.  And yet every thing seemed to smile upon her at the outset of life.  She was an only daughter; and her parents, wealthy silk-merchants, had brought her up like the daughter of an archduchess desired to marry some sovereign prince.  But at fifteen she had lost her mother.  Her father, soon tired of his lonely fireside, commenced to seek away from home some diversion from his sorrow.  He was a man of weak mind,--one of those marked in advance to play the part of eternal dupes.  Having money, he found many friends. Having once tasted the cup of facile pleasures, he yielded readily to its intoxication.  Suppers, cards, amusements, absorbed his time, to the utter detriment of his business.  And, eighteen months after his wife’s death, he had already spent a large portion of his fortune, when he fell into the hands of an adventuress, whom, without regard for his daughter, he audaciously brought beneath his own roof.  In provincial cities, where everybody knows everybody else, such infamies are almost impossible.  They are not quite so rare in Paris, where one is, so to speak, lost in the crowd, and where the restraining power of the neighbor’s opinion is lacking.  For two years the poor girl, condemned to bear this illegitimate stepmother, endured nameless sufferings.  She had just completed her eighteenth year, when, one evening, her father took her aside.  “I have made up my mind to marry again,” he said;  “but I wish first to provide you with a husband.  I have looked for one, and found him. He is not very brilliant perhaps; but he is, it seems, a good, hard-working, economical fellow, who’ll make his way in the world. I had dreamed of something better for you; but times are hard, trade is dull: in short, having only a dowry of twenty thousand francs to give you, I have no right to be very particular.  To-morrow I’ll bring you my candidate.”  And, sure enough, the next day that excellent father introduced M. Vincent Favoral to his daughter.  She was not pleased with him; but she could hardly have said that she was displeased.  He was, at the age of twenty-five, which he had just reached, a man so utterly lacking in individuality, that he could scarcely have excited any feeling either of sympathy or affection.  Suitably dressed, he seemed timid and awkward, reserved, quite diffident, and of mediocre intelligence.  He confessed to have received a most imperfect education, and declared himself quite ignorant of life.  He had scarcely any means outside his profession. He was at this time chief accountant in a large factory of the Faubourg St. Antoine, with a salary of four thousand Francs a year.  The young girl did not hesitate a moment.  Any thing appeared to her preferable to the contact of a woman whom she abhorred and despised.  She gave her consent; and, twenty days after the first interview, she had become Mme. Favoral.  Alas!  six weeks had not elapsed, before she knew that she had but exchanged her wretched fate for a more wretched one still.  Not that her husband was in any way unkind to her (he dared not, as yet); but he had revealed himself enough to enable her to judge him. He was one of those formidably selfish men who wither every thing around them, like those trees within the shadow of which nothing can grow.  His coldness concealed a stupid obstinacy; his mildness, an iron will.  If he had married, ‘twas because he thought a wife a necessary adjunct, because he desired a home wherein to command, because, above all, he had been seduced by the dowry of twenty thousand francs.  For the man had one passion,--money.  Under his placid countenance revolved thoughts of the most burning covetousness.  He wished to be rich.  Now, as he had no illusion whatever upon his own merits, as he knew himself to be perfectly incapable of any of those daring conceptions which lead to rapid fortune, as he was in no wise enterprising, he conceived but one means to achieve wealth, that is, to save, to economize, to stint himself, to pile penny upon penny.  His profession of accountant had furnished him with a number of instances of the financial power of the penny daily saved, and invested so as to yield its maximum of interest.  If ever his blue eye became animated, it was when he calculated what would be at the present time the capital produced by a simple penny placed at five per cent interest the year "]]]
