According to the calculations of our chronologists, the earth which we inhabit has existed for six or seven thousand years; during this time the nations have, under different forms, experienced many vicissitudes and calamities; history shows us that the human race in all ages has been tormented and devastated by tyrants, conquerors, heroes; by wars, inundations, famines, epidemics, etc. Is this long catalogue of proofs of such a nature as to inspire us with great confidence in the hidden views of the Divinity? Do such constant evils give us an exalted idea of the future fate which His kindness is preparing for us?  4. If God is as well-disposed as they assure us He is, could He not at least, without bestowing an infinite happiness upon men, communicate to them that degree of happiness of which finite beings are susceptible? In order to be happy, do we need an Infinite or Divine happiness?  5. If God has not been able to render men happier than they are here below, what will become of the hope of a Paradise, where it is pretended that the elect or chosen few will rejoice forever in ineffable happiness? If God could not or would not remove evil from the earth (the only sojourning place we know of), what reason could we have to presume that He can or will remove it from another world, of which we know nothing? More than two thousand years ago, according to Lactance, the wise epicure said: \"Either God wants to prevent evil, and can not, or He can and will not; or He neither can nor will, or He will and can. If He wants to, without the power, He is impotent; if He can, and will not, He is guilty of malice which we can not attribute to Him; if He neither can nor will, He is both impotent and wicked, and consequently can not be God; if He wishes to and can, whence then comes evil, or why does He not prevent it?\" For more than two thousand years honest minds have waited for a rational solution of these difficulties; and our theologians teach us that they will not be revealed to us until the future life.     LVIII.--ANOTHER IDLE FANCY.  We are told of a pretended scale for human beings; it is supposed that God has divided His creatures into different classes, each one enjoying the degree of happiness of which he is susceptible. According to this romantic arrangement, all beings, from the oyster to the angel, enjoy the happiness which belongs to them. Experience contradicts this sublime revery. In the world where we are, we see all sentient beings living and suffering in the midst of dangers. Man can not step without wounding, tormenting, crushing a multitude of sentient beings which he finds in his path, while he himself, at every step, is exposed to a throng of evils seen or unseen, which may lead to his destruction. Is not the very thought of death sufficient to mar his greatest enjoyment? During the whole course of his life he is subject to sufferings; there is not a moment when he feels sure of preserving his existence, to which he is so strongly attached, and which he regards as the greatest gift of Divinity.     LIX.--IN VAIN DOES THEOLOGY EXERT ITSELF TO ACQUIT GOD OF MAN'S DEFECTS. EITHER THIS GOD IS NOT FREE, OR HE IS MORE WICKED THAN GOOD.  The world, it will be said, has all the perfection of which it was susceptible; by the very reason that the world was not the God who made it, it was necessary that it should have great qualities and great defects. But we will answer, that the world necessarily having great defects, it would have been better suited to the nature of a good God not to create a world which He could not render completely happy. If God, who was, according to you, supremely happy before the world was created, had continued to be supremely happy in the created world, why did He not remain in peace? Why must man suffer? Why must man exist What is his existence to God? Nothing or something. If his existence is not useful or necessary to God, why did He not leave him in nothingness? If man's existence is necessary to His glory, He then needed man, He lacked something before this man existed!  We can forgive an unskillful workman for doing imperfect work, because he must work, well or ill, or starve; this workman is excusable; but your God is not. According to you, He is self-sufficient; in this case, why does He create men? He has, according to you, all that is necessary to render man happy; why, then, does He not do it? You must conclude that your God has more malice than goodness, or you must admit that God was compelled to do what He has done, without being able to do otherwise. However, you assure us that your God is free; you say also that He is immutable, although beginning in time and ceasing in time to exercise His power, like all the inconstant beings of this world. Oh, theologians! you have made vain efforts to acquit your God of all the defects of man; there is always visible in this God so perfect, \"a tip of the [human] ear.\"     LX.--WE CAN NOT BELIEVE IN A DIVINE PROVIDENCE, IN AN INFINITELY GOOD AND POWERFUL GOD.  Is not God the master of His favors? Has He not the right to dispense His benefits? Can He not take them back again? His creature has no right to ask the reason of His conduct; He can dispose at will of the works of His hands. Absolute sovereign of mortals, He distributes happiness or unhappiness, according to His pleasure. These are the solutions which theologians give in order to console us for the evils which God inflicts upon us. We would tell them that a God who was infinitely good, would not be the master of His favors, but would be by His own nature obliged to distribute them among His creatures; we would tell them that a truly benevolent being would not believe he had the right to abstain from doing good; we would tell them that a truly generous being does not take back what he has given, and any man who does it, forfeits gratitude, and has no right to complain of ingratitude. How can the arbitrary and whimsical conduct which theologians ascribe to God, be reconciled with the religion which supposes a compact or mutual agreement between this God and men? If God owes nothing to His creatures, they, on their part, can not owe anything to their God. All religion is founded upon the happiness which men believe they have a right to expect from the Divinity, who is supposed to tell them: \"Love, adore, obey me, and I will render you happy!\" Men on their side say to Him: \"Make us happy, be faithful to your promises, and we will love you, we will adore you, we will obey your laws!\" In neglecting the happiness of His creatures, in distributing His favors and His graces according to His caprice, and taking back His gifts, does not God violate the contract which serves as a base for all religion?  Cicero has said with reason that if God does not make Himself agreeable to man, He can not be his God. [Nisi Deus homini placuerit, Deus non erit.] Goodness constitutes Divinity; this Goodness can manifest itself to man only by the advantages he derives from it. As soon as he is unfortunate, this Goodness disappears and ceases to be Divinity. An infinite Goodness can be neither partial nor exclusive. If God is infinitely good, He owes happiness to all His creatures; one unfortunate being alone would be sufficient to annihilate an unlimited goodness. Under an infinitely good and powerful God, is it possible to conceive that a single man could suffer? An animal, a mite, which suffers, furnishes invincible arguments against Divine Providence and its infinite benefactions.     LXI.--CONTINUATION.  According to theologians, the afflictions and evils of this life are chastisements which culpable men receive from Divinity. But why are men culpable? If God is Almighty, does it cost Him any more to say, \"Let everything remain in order!\"--\"let all my subjects be good, innocent, fortunate!\"--than to say, \"Let everything exist?\" Was it more difficult for this God to do His work well than to do it so badly? Was it any farther from the nonexistence of beings to their wise and happy existence, than from their non-existence to their insensate and miserable existence? Religion speaks to us of a hell--that is, of a fearful place where, notwithstanding His goodness, God reserves eternal torments for the majority of men. Thus, after having rendered mortals very miserable in this world, religion teaches them that God can make them much more wretched in another. They meet our objections by saying, that otherwise the goodness of God would take the place of His justice. But goodness which takes the place of the most terrible cruelty, is not infinite kindness. Besides, a God who, after having been infinitely good, becomes infinitely wicked, can He be regarded as an immutable being? A God filled with implacable fury, is He a God in whom we can find a shadow of charity or goodness?     LXII.--THEOLOGY MAKES OF ITS GOD A MONSTER OF NONSENSE, OF INJUSTICE, OF MALICE, AND ATROCITY--A BEING ABSOLUTELY HATEFUL.  Divine justice, such as our theologians paint it, is, without doubt, a quality intended to make us love Divinity. According to the notions of modern theology, it appears evident that God has created the majority of men with the view only of punishing them eternally. Would it not have been more in conformity with kindness, with reason, with equity, to create but stones or plants, and not sentient beings, than to create men whose conduct in this world would cause them eternal chastisements in another? A God so perfidious and wicked as to create a single man and leave him exposed to the perils of damnation, can not be regarded as a perfect being, but as a monster of nonsense, injustice, malice, and atrocity. Far from forming a perfect God, the theologians have made the most imperfect of beings. According to theological ideas, God resembles a tyrant who, having "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],["title","In Search of the Okapi (#0)"],["body","SEARCH OF THE OKAPI  A Story of Adventure in Central Africa  by  ERNEST GLANVILLE  Author of \"The Diamond Seekers\" \"The Fossicker\" \"Tales from the Veld\" etc.  Illustrated by William Rainey, R.I.

'Why do I wish to understand Arabic?' Why do you stand on one leg watching a tadpole shed its tail.\"  \"Excuse me, I always sit down to watch a tadpole.\"  \"Yet I have seen you poised on one leg for an hour like a heron, afraid to put down the other foot lest you should scare some wretched pollywog. Why?\"  \"I do it for the love of the thing, Dick. What is a page of your crooked signs compared with a single green pond and all that it holds?\"  \"By Jove! Is that so--and would you find a volume in a caterpillar?\"  \"Why not? Listen to me, Dick.  Take the silver-spiked caterpillar, with a skin of black satin and a length that runs to four inches. He lives his life in the topmost boughs of an African palm--a feathered dome amid the forest--and there beneath the blue sky he browses till he descends into the warm earth to sleep in chrysalis form before he emerges as a splendid moth, with glass windows in his wide wings to sail with the fire-flies through the dark vaults of the silent woods.\"  \"All that from a caterpillar?\"  \"That and much more, Dicky.\"  \"And where will this study of the caterpillar lead you, Godfrey? One can't live on a caterpillar.\"  \"Yet there is one kind--fat and creamy--that makes good soup.\"  \"Ugh, you cormorant! But tell me seriously, what is the end of your studies--where will they lead you?\"  \"To Central Africa.\"  \"Do you mean that, Venning?\"  \"I do, Dick. There is one spot on the map of Africa that is marked black. That spot is covered over hundreds of square miles by the unexplored forest. Think what that means to me!\"  \"Fever most likely--or three inches of spear-head.\"  \"A forest big enough to cover England! Just think of the new forms of life--from a new ant to an elephant or hornless giraffe. The okapi was discovered near that great hunting-ground--and, who is to say there are not other animals as strange in its untrodden depths?\"  \"Is it a wild-fowl, the okapi?\"  \"A wild-fowl, you duffer!\" exclaimed Venning, indignantly. \"Haven't you heard of the dwarfed giraffe, part zebra, discovered by Sir Harry Johnston? It lost the long neck of the original species which browses in the open veld by the necessity to adapt its habits to the changed conditions of life within the forest.\"  \"Your neck is rather long, my boy, from much stretching to watch things. Look out that you don't have it shortened. And so you intend to visit Central Africa? That is very curious!\"  \"I don't see anything curious about it.\"  \"Nor do I, as to one thing.  If a fellow is crazy about butterflies, he may as well roam in Africa as a lunatic with a net as anywhere else; but the curious part of the matter is, that my study of Arabic is intended to prepare me for a trip to the very same place.\"  \"Compton, you don't mean it,\" said the other, jumping from his seat.  \"I do, most decidedly.\"  \"But what has Arabic got to do with the Central African Forest?\"  \"Quite as much as your short-nosed elephant or long-tailed hippopotamus. I also wish to discover  something that has been lost. Don't open your mouth so wide.\"  \"Is it an animal, Dick?\"  \"Good gracious, no! I don't care twopence about an animal, except it is for the pot, or unless it wants me for dinner. No; mine is another search.  It is connected with my father.\"  \"Yes,\" said Venning, quietly; for his friend had suddenly grown grave.  \"When I was a little chap, about seventeen years ago, my mother received a letter dated from the 'great forest.'\"  \"It contained only these words, 'Good-bye.' With it there was a letter in Arabic, written by my father's headman. That letter was seven months on its travels, and since then no other word have I heard.\"  Venning muttered something in sympathy.  \"My mother,\" continued the other, \"died five years ago, without having learnt the meaning of the message in Arabic. She had a wish that no one but I should read the letter, and often she told me that if it contained any instructions or directions, I was to carry them out. Well, I have interpreted the Arabic signs.\"  \"Yes, Dick; and----\"  \"And I can't quite make out the meaning. There is a reference to the journal my father kept, with the  statement that it was safely hidden; but then follows a reference to a Garden of Rest, to certain people who  protected him, and to a slave-trader who did him an injury. These references to me are a mystery; but what is clear is his desire to have his journal recovered from the Arab slave-dealer, described merely as 'The Wolf.'\"  \"And that is why you wish to go to Central Africa?\"  \"That is why, Venning. I must recover my father's journal if it exists; I must, if it is not too late, find out how he died; I must find out who are the wild people, and what is the Garden of Rest.\"  \"The Garden of Rest! That sounds peaceful, but it is very vague, Dick, as a direction. A garden in a forest hundreds of miles in length will take some finding.\"  \"I have a clue.\"  \"So.\"  \"There is mention of the 'gates' to the garden, whose summits 'are in the clouds'--twin mountains, I take it.\"  \"Even so, Dick, I think I should have more chance of finding my new animal than you would have of hitting off your garden.\"  \"Well, you know now why I have been studying Arabic. I have a little money, and no ties.\"  \"Like me. By Jove! why shouldn't we go out together?\"  \"Because we have some sense, I suppose,\" said Compton, coolly. \"Have you ever roughed it?\"  \"I have slept out in the New Forest--often.\"  \"Oh, that's picnicking, with the bark of the fox in place of the lion's roar, and good food in place of 'hard tack,' and perhaps the attentions of a suspicious keeper instead of a surprise attack by wild men of the woods. An explorer needs experience.\"  \"Yes, and he must buy his own experience; but tell me how he can, unless he makes a beginning.\"  \"Now we come to the point, Venning. He should begin with some one who already has experience.\"  \"I see. And you will wait till some seasoned explorer kindly asks you to join him? You'll have to wait a precious long time.\"  \"I'm not so sure,\" said Dick Compton, with a knowing smile.  \"Have you found your explorer, Dick?\" shouted Venning, eagerly.  Compton produced a leather purse and extracted a slip of paper cut from an advertisement column, and passed it to his friend.  \"By Jove! eh, that's splendid!\" spluttered Venning, in his excitement as he glanced at the paper.  \"Read it over.\"  Venning read the notice--  \"A GENTLEMAN, who is an experienced traveler, being about to enter upon an expedition into Central Africa, would like to make arrangements with two young men of education and of means to bear a share of the expenses to accompany him.--Apply, for further particulars, to D. H., No. 109  Box, Office of this paper.\"  \"Let us write at once to D. H.,\" he said eagerly.  \"I have seen him.\"  Venning took a deep breath and stared at his friend.  \"I saw him this very morning,\" said Compton, quietly.  \"And----------\"  \"He said you were too young! Eh? Go on--go on!\"  \"And I told him I thought I could find a friend who would join me.\"  \"You mean to say that he agreed to take you?\" cried Venning, jumping up.  Compton nodded.  \"Oh, splendid! And you will take me to him? You're a brick. What is he like, eh? Is he old or young, eh?\"  Compton kept cool outwardly, but he could not subdue the glitter of his dark eyes, or keep the colour out of his cheeks.  \"He is about five feet four. I can look over his head.\"  \"Oh!\"  \"There are grey hairs in his beard.\"  \"Quite old; old and little! What bad luck! He will have to look up to us.\"  \"Well, you know, he can't help being small, can he?\"  \"I suppose, like most little men, he is as vain as he can stick, bumptious, and fidgety,\" said Venning, despondently.  \"He struck me as being very quiet. At any rate, you can judge for yourself, as we are due to see him within half an hour. You must tell him that you are a naturalist, as he intends writing a book, in which a great deal of space will be given to animals. He said he felt a 'bit shaky on his pins' when it came to scientific terms.\"  \"I should be glad to help him there,\" said Venning; \"but it is too good. He would never take a youngster like me.\"  \"He said he would rather have a youngster who would carry out his own views about treating a subject, than a man who would try to teach him his business. Come along and see him for yourself.\"  \"Within half an hour the two friends who had just left school entered a room which was part library, part museum, armoury, dining- room, and cabin, so crammed it was.  \"This is my friend Venning, Mr. Hume.\"  \"Glad to see you, Venning. Sit down anywhere.\"  Compton sat down between the horns of a bleached buffalo skull, but Venning stood like one in a"]]]
