Since they never before had seen him, they asked him his name; and he answered them that of those at home he was called Master Sweetheart, a name he could not understand: for surely, being a cripple, he must be a very sorry sweetheart; yet, that he was a sweetheart unto his mother at least he had no doubt, for she did love to hold him in her lap and call him by that name; and many times when she did so he saw that tears were in her eyes,--a proof, she told him when he asked, that Master Sweetheart was her sweetheart before all others upon earth.  It befell that our little Mistress Merciless and Master Sweetheart became fast friends, and the Queen of Sheba was handmaiden to them both; for the simple, loyal creature had not a mind above the artless prattle of childhood, and the strange allegory of the lame boy's speech filled her with awe, even as the innocent lisping of our little Mistress Merciless delighted her heart and came within the comprehension of her limited understanding. So each day, when it was fair, these three came into the full fair garden, and rambled there together; and when they were weary they entered into the arbor and sate together upon the Siege of Restfulness. Wit ye well there was not a flower or a tree or a shrub or a bird in all that full fair garden which they did not know and love, and in very sooth every flower and tree and shrub and bird therein did know and love them.  When they entered into the arbor, and sate together upon the Siege of Restfulness, it was Master Sweetheart's wont to tell them of the land of Ever-Plaisance, for it was a conceit of his that he journeyed each day nearer and nearer to that land, and that his journey thitherward was nearly done. How came he to know of that land I cannot say, for I do not know; but I am fain to believe that, as he said, the exceeding fair angels told him thereof when by night, as he lay sleeping, they came singing and with caresses to his bedside.  I speak now of a holy thing, therefore I speak truth when I say that while little children lie sleeping in their beds at night it pleaseth God to send His exceeding fair angels with singing and caresses to bear messages of His love unto those little sleeping children. And I have seen those exceeding fair angels bend with folded wings over the little cradles and the little beds, and kiss those little sleeping children and whisper God's messages of love to them, and I knew that those messages were full of sweet tidings; for, even though they slept, the little children smiled. This have I seen, and there is none who loveth little children that will deny the truth of this thing which I have now solemnly declared.  [Illustration: The strange allegory of the lame boy's speech filled her with awe.]  Of that land of Ever-Plaisance was our little Mistress Merciless ever fain to hear tell. But when she beset the rest of us to speak thereof we knew not what to say other than to confirm such reports as Master Sweetheart had already made. For when it cometh to knowing of that far-off land,--ah me, who knoweth more than the veriest little child? And oftentimes within the bosom of a little, helpless, fading one there bloometh a wisdom which sages cannot comprehend. So when she asked us we were wont to bid her go to Master Sweetheart, for he knew the truth and spake it.  It is now to tell of an adventure which on a time befell in that full fair garden of which you have heard me speak. In this garden lived many birds of surpassing beauty and most rapturous song, and among them was one that they called Joyous, for that he did ever carol forth so joyously, it mattered not what the day soever might be. This bird Joyous had his home in the top of an exceeding high tree, hard by the pleasant arbor, and here did he use to sit at such times as the little people came into that arbor, and then would he sing to them such songs as befitted that quiet spot, and them that came thereto. But there was a full evil cat that dwelt near by, and this cruel beast found no pleasure in the music that Joyous did make continually; nay, that music filled this full evil cat with a wicked thirst for the blood of that singing innocent, and she had no peace for the malice that was within her seeking to devise a means whereby she might comprehend the bird Joyous to her murderous intent. Now you must know that it was the wont of our little Mistress Merciless and of Master Sweetheart to feed the birds in that fair garden with such crumbs as they were suffered to bring with them into the arbor, and at such times would those birds fly down with grateful twitterings and eat of those crumbs upon the greensward round about the arbor. Wit ye well, it was a merry sight to see those twittering birds making feast upon the good things which those children brought, and our little Mistress Merciless and little Master Sweetheart had sweet satisfaction therein. But, on a day, whilst thus those twittering birds made great feasting, lo! on a sudden did that full evil cat whereof I have spoken steal softly from a thicket, and with one hideous bound make her way into the very midst of those birds and seize upon that bird Joyous, that was wont to sing so merrily from the tree hard by the arbor. Oh, there was a mighty din and a fearful fluttering, and the rest flew swiftly away, but Joyous could not do so, because the full evil cat held him in her cruel fangs and claws. And I make no doubt that Joyous would speedily have met his death, but that with a wrathful cry did our little Mistress Merciless hasten to his rescue. And our little Mistress belabored that full evil cat with Master Sweetheart's crutch, until that cruel beast let loose her hold upon the fluttering bird and was full glad to escape with her aching bones into the thicket again. So it was that Joyous was recovered from death; but even then might it have fared ill with him, had they not taken him up and dressed his wounds and cared for him until duly he was well again. And then they released him to do his plaisance, and he returned to his home in the tree hard by the arbor and there he sung unto those children more sweetly than ever before; for his heart was full of gratitude to our little Mistress Merciless and Master Sweetheart.  Now, of the dolls that she had in goodly number, that one which was named Beautiful did our little Mistress Merciless love best. Know well that the doll Beautiful had come not from oversea, and was neither of wax nor of china; but she was right ingeniously constructed of a bed-key that was made of wood, and unto the top of this bed-key had the Queen of Sheba superadded a head with a fair face, and upon the body and the arms of the key had she hung passing noble raiment. Unto this doll Beautiful was our little Mistress Merciless vastly beholden, and she did use to have the doll Beautiful lie by her side at night whilst she slept, and whithersoever during the day she went, there also would she take the doll Beautiful, too. Much sorrow and lamentation, therefore, made our little Mistress Merciless when on an evil day the doll Beautiful by chance fell into the fish-pond, and was not rescued therefrom until one of her beauteous eyes had been devoured of the envious water; so that ever thereafter the doll Beautiful had but one eye, and that, forsooth, was grievously faded. And on another evil day came a monster ribald dog pup and seized upon the doll Beautiful whilst she reposed in the arbor, and bore her away, and romped boisterously with her upon the sward, and tore off her black-thread hair, and sought to destroy her wholly, which surely he would have done but for the Queen of Sheba, who made haste to rescue the doll Beautiful, and chastise that monster ribald dog pup.  Therefore, as you can understand, the time was right busily spent. The full fair garden, with its flowers and the singing birds and the gracious arbor and the Siege of Restfulness, found favor with those children, and amid these joyous scenes did Master Sweetheart have to tell each day of that far-off land of Ever-Plaisance, whither he said he was going. And one day, when the sun shone very bright, and the full fair garden joyed in the music of those birds, Master Sweetheart did not come, and they missed the little lame boy and wondered where he was. And as he never came again they thought at last that of a surety he had departed into that country whereof he loved to tell. Which thing filled our little Mistress Merciless with wonder and inquiry; and I think she was lonely ever after that,--lonely for Master Sweetheart.  I am thinking now of her and of him; for this is the Christmas season,--the time when it is most meet to think of the children and other sweet and holy things. There is snow everywhere, snow and cold. The garden is desolate and voiceless: the flowers are gone, the trees are ghosts, the birds have departed. It is winter out there, and it is winter, too, in this heart of mine. Yet in this Christmas season I think of them, and it pleaseth me--God forbid that I offend with much speaking--it pleaseth me to tell of the little things they did and loved. And you shall understand it all if, perchance, this sacred Christmas time a little Mistress Merciless of your own, or a little Master Sweetheart, clingeth to your knee and sanctifieth your hearth-stone.  When of an evening all the joy of day was done, would our little Mistress Merciless fall aweary; and then her eyelids would grow exceeding heavy and her little tired hands were fain to fold. At such a time it was my wont to beguile her weariness with little tales of faery, or with the gentle play that sleepy children like. Much was her fancy taken with what I told her of the train that every night whirleth away to Shut-Eye Town, bearing unto that beauteous country sleepy little girls and boys. Nor would she be content until I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],["title","The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: SOME CADETS CAME INTO VIEW, EACH CARRYING A BUCKET OF WATER.      _The Mystery of Putnam Hall_--_Frontispiece._ (Page 95)]      THE MYSTERY AT  PUTNAM HALL  _Or_  _The School Chums' Strange Discovery_  BY  ARTHUR M.

THE MYSTERY EXPLAINED--CONCLUSION   271     INTRODUCTION   MY DEAR BOYS:  This story is complete in itself, but forms the sixth volume in a line issued under the general title of \"Putnam Hall Series.\"  As mentioned several times, this line was started because many young folks wanted to know what happened at Putnam Hall Military School previous to the arrival at that institution of the Rover boys, as already related in my \"Rover Boys Series.\"  To gratify this curiosity I wrote the first volume of this series, called \"The Putnam Hall Cadets,\" showing how Captain Putnam organized his famous school, and how it was Jack Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore came to be among his first pupils.  In the second book, entitled \"The Putnam Hall Rivals,\" I gave the particulars of several contests on the field of sports, and also told about a thrilling balloon ride and of an odd discovery in the woods.  Following the second book came a third, \"The Putnam Hall Champions,\" with more bitterly-contested games, in one of which young Major Ruddy's enemies played him a foul trick.  From the opening of the school there had been dissatisfaction with one of the teachers, and when another was engaged who proved to be a man of peculiar whims, the boys went into open revolt, as related in another volume, called \"The Putnam Hall Rebellion.\" The cadets literally ran away, and did not return to the Hall until Captain Putnam came upon the scene to straighten matters out.  The rebellion was followed by a grand outing, as related in \"The Putnam Hall Encampment.\" The cadets marched far away from the school, to the shore of a beautiful lake, and there our heroes managed to have a good time in spite of the mean work of several of their enemies.  In the present volume are related the particulars of a most puzzling mystery which at one time threatened to bring disaster to the whole school. How the mystery was at last solved I leave for the pages which follow to explain.  Again I thank both young and old for all the nice things they have said about my books. I hope the reading of the volumes affords all both pleasure and profit.            Affectionately and sincerely yours,                                    EDWARD STRATEMEYER.     THE MYSTERY AT PUTNAM HALL     CHAPTER I  AN ENCOUNTER ON THE ROAD   \"Here we are again, as the clown says in the circus!\"  \"Right you are, Pepper. And I'll be glad to get back to Putnam Hall once more,\" responded Major Jack Ruddy, as he followed his chum from the lake steamer to the Cedarville dock.  \"Hello, there is Andy!\" cried Pepper Ditmore, as he caught sight of a familiar face in the crowd of cadets, \"Andy, where have you been? Why didn't you come on the boat with us?\"  \"I got in last night,\" answered Andy Snow. \"How are you, anyway?\" And he shook hands cordially.  \"Oh, I'm as fine as a new-tooth comb,\" answered Pepper Ditmore, with a grin. \"Ready for study and fun.\"  \"Especially fun, I'll wager. How about it, Jack?\"  \"Oh, Pepper usually manages to get his share,\" came from the young major of the Putnam Hall battalion. \"But, Andy, did you---- Hi, look where you are going, will you, Ritter!\" cried Jack, rather angrily.  A tall youth, carrying a big dress-suit case, had forced his way through the crowd, hitting Jack in the knee with his baggage.  \"What do you want to block the way for?\" demanded Reff Ritter, sourly. \"Think you own the dock?\"  \"I've got as much right here, Ritter, as you have!\" retorted the young major, sharply. \"Don't you knock me again like that.\"  \"I will--if you get in my way.\"  \"If you do, you'll take the consequences.\"  \"Bah! Don't you try to dictate to me, Jack Ruddy!\" growled Reff Ritter. \"You got the best of me last term, but you'll not get the best of me this term, I'll tell you that!\"  \"Phew! Ritter is somewhat peppery!\" whispered Andy Snow.  \"I guess I know the reason,\" came from a student named Dale Blackmore.  \"What is it?\"  \"I'll tell you later--too much of a crowd here,\" rejoined Dale.  About twenty cadets, all bound for Putnam Hall Military Academy, had arrived on the boat from Ithaca, and these, along with some others who had come down to the dock to see the boat come in, gathered around Jack Ruddy and Reff Ritter to see the outcome of the unexpected encounter.  Jack Ruddy had good cause to consider Reff Ritter his enemy. But he had hoped that during the term now opening at the school the bully of Putnam Hall would keep his distance.  \"I am not trying to dictate to you, Ritter,\" answered Jack, as calmly as he could. \"But I don't propose to let you hit me with your suitcase.\"  \"Huh! It was an accident!\" growled Reff.  \"Oh, come on, Reff!\" put in Gus Coulter, the bully's close crony. \"Let us get good seats in the carryall.\"  \"That's the talk! Let us get in before the others take the seats!\" came from Nick Paxton, another crony.  He pushed ahead, and his elbow caught Pepper Ditmore directly in the ribs.  \"Not quite so swift, Paxton!\" cried Pepper, and he gave the cadet a quick shove backwards. Paxton bumped into Reff Ritter, lost his footing, and fell over the dress-suit case in the bully's hand.  \"Hurrah! One down!\" cried Andy Snow. \"How many yards to gain for a touchdown, Nick?\"  \"What do you mean by knocking me down!\" roared Nick Paxton, as he scrambled to his feet. \"I'll not stand for it.\"  \"Then sit down again,\" answered Pepper, merrily. \"And next time keep your elbow out of my ribs,\" he added. \"Come on, we don't want to get left!\" he added to his chums.  A bolt was made by many of the cadets for the Putnam Hall carryall, and soon a crowd was inside and on the front seat, talking, joking and cheering, as suited the mood of each individual. Jack, Pepper, Andy and Dale managed to crowd inside throwing their suitcases on the top. Gus Coulter got in also, but when he saw that Reff Ritter and Nick Paxton had been left, he scrambled out again, and his place was taken by Fred Century, another student.  \"Hello, Peleg, old sport!\" cried Pepper, gaily, to the driver of the turnout. \"How have you been for the past fifty years?\"  \"Oh, I'm very well, thank you,\" responded Peleg Snuggers.  \"Heard you"]]]
