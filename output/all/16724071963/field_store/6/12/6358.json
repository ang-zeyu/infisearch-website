Several cases are reported by Dr. Abercrombie, and quoted by Professor Hyslop, in which mental impressions long since forgotten beyond the power of voluntary recall have been revived by the shock of accident or disease. \"A man,\" he says, \"mentioned by Mr. Abernethy, had been born in France, but had spent the greater part of his life in England, and, for many years, had entirely lost the habit of speaking French. But when under the care of Mr. Abernethy, on account of the effects of an injury to the head, he always spoke French.\"  [Sidenote: _Speaking a Forgotten Tongue_]  \"A similar case occurred in St. Thomas Hospital, of a man who was in a state of stupor in consequence of an injury to the head. On his partial recovery he spoke a language which nobody in the hospital understood but which was soon ascertained to be Welsh. It was then discovered that he had been thirty years absent from Wales, and, before the accident, had entirely forgotten his native language.  \"A lady mentioned by Dr. Pritchard, when in a state of delirium, spoke a language which nobody about her understood, but which was afterward discovered to be Welsh. None of her friends could form any conception of the manner in which she had become acquainted with that language; but, after much inquiry, it was discovered that in her childhood she had a nurse, a native of a district on the coast of Brittany, the dialect of which is closely analogous to Welsh. The lady at that time learned a good deal of this dialect but had entirely forgotten it for many years before this attack of fever.\"  [Sidenote: _Living Past Experiences Over Again_]  Dr. Carpenter relates the following incident in his \"Mental Physiology\": \"Several years ago, the Rev. S. Mansard, now rector of Bethnal Green, was doing clerical duty for a time at Hurstmonceaux, in Sussex; and while there he one day went over with a party of friends to Pevensey Castle, which he did not remember to have ever previously visited. As he approached the gateway he became conscious of a very vivid impression of having seen it before; and he 'seemed to himself to see' not only the gateway itself, but donkeys beneath the arch and people on top of it. His conviction that he must have visited the castle on some former occasion--although he had neither the slightest remembrance of such a visit nor any knowledge of having ever been in the neighborhood previously to his residence at Hurstmonceaux--made him inquire from his mother if she could throw any light on the matter. She at once informed him that being in that part of the country, when he was but _eighteen months old_, she had gone over with a large party and had taken him in the pannier of a donkey; that the elders of the party, having brought lunch with them, had eaten it on the roof of the gateway, where they would have been seen from below, whilst he had been left on the ground with the attendants and donkeys.\"  \"An Italian gentleman,\" says Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, \"who died of yellow fever in New York, in the beginning of his illness spoke English, in the middle of it French, but on the day of his death only Italian.\"  Striking as these instances are, they are not unusual. Everyone on reflection can supply similar instances. Who among us has not at one time or another been impressed with a mysterious feeling of having at some time in the past gone through the identical experience which he is living now?  [Sidenote: _The \"Flash of Inspiration\"_]  On such occasions the sense of familiarity is sometimes so persistent as to fill one with a strange feeling of the supernatural and to incline our minds to the belief in a reincarnation.  The \"flash of inspiration\" which, for the lawyer, solves a novel legal issue arising in the trial of a case, or, for the surgeon, sees him successfully through the emergencies of a delicate operation, has its origin in the forgotten learning of past experience and study.  [Sidenote: _The Totality of Retention_]  Succeeding books in this _Course_ will bring to light numerous other facts less commonly observed, drawn indeed from the study of abnormal mental states, indicating that we retain a great volume of sense-impressions of whose very recording we are at the time unaware. In other words, all the evidences point to the absolute totality of our retention of all sensory experiences. They indicate that every sense-impression you ever received, whether you actually perceived and were conscious of it or not, has been retained and preserved in your memory, and can be \"brought to mind\" when you understand the proper method of calling it into service.  A vast wealth of facts is stored in the treasure vaults of your mind, but there are certain inner compartments to which you have lost the combination.  [Sidenote: _Possibilities of Self-Discovery_]  The author of \"Thoughts on Business\" says: \"It is a great day in a man's life when he truly begins to discover himself. The latent capacities of every man are greater than he realizes, and he may find them if he diligently seeks for them. A man may own a tract of land for many years without knowing its value. He may think of it as merely a pasture. But one day he discovers evidences of coal and finds a rich vein beneath his land. While mining and prospecting for coal he discovers deposits of granite. In boring for water he strikes oil. Later he discovers a vein of copper ore, and after that silver and gold. These things were there all the time--even when he thought of his land merely as a pasture. But they have a value only when they are discovered and utilized.\"  \"Not every pasture contains deposits of silver and gold, neither oil nor granite, nor even coal. But beneath the surface of every man there must be, in the nature of things, a latent capacity greater than has yet been discovered. And one discovery must lead to another until the man finds the deep wealth of his own possibilities. History is full of the acts of men who discovered somewhat of their own capacity; but history has yet to record the man who fully discovered all that he might have been.\"  [Sidenote: _\"Acres of Diamonds\"_]  You who are a bit vain of your visits to other lands, your wide reading, your experience of men and things; you who secretly lament that so little of what you have seen and read remains with you, behold, your \"acres of diamonds\" are within you, needing but the mystic formula that shall reveal the treasure!     THE MECHANISM OF RECALL  [Illustration: Decorative Header]   CHAPTER III  THE MECHANISM OF RECALL   [Sidenote: _The Right Stimulus_]  Somehow, somewhere, all experiences, whether subject to voluntary recall or not, are preserved, and are capable of reproduction when the right stimulus comes along.  And it is a law that _those experiences which are associated with each other, whether ideas, emotions or voluntary or involuntary muscular movements, tend to become bound together into groups, and these groups tend to become bound together into systems_.  [Sidenote: _\"Complexes\" of Experience_]  Such a system of associated groups of experiences is technically known as a \"complex.\"  Pay particular attention to these definitions, as \"groups\" of ideas and \"complexes\" of ideas, emotions and muscular movements are terms that we shall constantly employ.  You learned in a former lesson that mental experiences may consist not only of sense-perceptions based on excitements arising in the memory nerves, but also of bodily emotions, the \"feeling tones\" of ideas, and of muscular movements based on stimuli arising in the motor nerves.  _Groups consist, therefore, not only of associated ideas, but of associated ideas coupled with their emotional qualities and impulses to muscular movements._  All groups bound together by a mutually related idea constitute a single \"complex.\" Every memory you have is an illustration of such \"complexes.\"  [Sidenote: _The Thrill of Recollection_]  Suppose, for example, you once gained success in a business deal. Your recollection of the other persons concerned in that transaction, of any one detail in the transaction itself, will be accompanied by the faster heartbeat, the quickened circulation of the blood, the feeling of triumph and elation that attended the original experience.  [Sidenote: _\"Complexes\" and Functional Derangements_]  Complexes formed out of harrowing earthquakes, robberies, murders or other dreadful spectacles, which were originally accompanied on the part of the onlooker by trembling, perspiration and palpitation of the heart, when lived over again in memory, are again accompanied by all these bodily activities. Your memory of a hairbreadth escape will bring to your cheek the pallor that marked it when the incident occurred.  The formation and existence of \"complexes\" explains the origin of many functional diseases of the body--that is to say, diseases involving no loss or destruction of tissue, but consisting simply in a failure on the part of some bodily organ to perform its allotted function naturally and effectively.  [Sidenote: _Automatically Working Mental Mechanisms_]  Thus, in hay fever or \"rose cold\" the tears, the inflammation of the membranes of the nose, the cough, the other trying symptoms, all are linked with the sight of a rose, or dust, or sunlight, or some other outside fact to which attention has been called as the cause of hay fever, into a complex, \"an automatically working mechanism.\" And the validity of this explanation of the regular recurrence of attacks of this disease is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that a paper rose is likely to prove just as effective in producing all the symptoms of the disease as a rose out of Nature's garden.  Another striking illustration of the working of this principle is afforded by two gentlemen of my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17829"],["title","The Trained Memory (#2)"],["body","ce, brothers, each of whom since boyhood has had unfailing attacks of sneezing upon first arising in the morning. No sooner is one of these men awake and seated upon the edge of his bed for dressing than he begins to sneeze, and he continues to sneeze for fifteen or twenty minutes thereafter, although he has no \"cold\" and never sneezes at any other time.  [Sidenote: _Two Classes of \"Complexes\"_]  Obviously, if absolutely all mental experiences are preserved, they consist altogether of two broad classes of complexes: first, those that are momentarily _active in consciousness_, forming part of the present mental picture, and, second, all the others--that is to say, all past experiences that are _not at the present moment before the mind's eye_.  There are, then, _conscious_ complexes and _subconscious_ complexes, complexes of _consciousness_ and complexes of _subconsciousness_.  [Sidenote: _The Subconscious Storehouse_]  And of the complexes of subconsciousness, some are far more readily recalled than others. Some are forever popping into one's thoughts, while others can be brought to the light of consciousness only by some unusual and deep-probing stimulus. And _the human mind is a vast storehouse of complexes, far the greater part buried in subconsciousness_, yet somehow, like impressions on the wax cylinder of a phonograph, preserved with life-like truth and clearness.  Turn back for a moment to our definition of memory. You will observe that its second essential element is Recall.  Recall is the process by which the experiences of the past are summoned from the reservoir of the subconscious into the light of present consciousness. We necessarily touched upon this process in a previous book, in considering the Laws of Association, but here, in relation to memory, we shall go into the matter somewhat more analytically.     THE LAWS OF RECALL  [Illustration: Decorative Header]   CHAPTER IV  THE LAWS OF RECALL   [Sidenote: _The Law of Integral Recall_]  Law I. The primary law of recall is this: _The recurrence or stimulation of one element in a complex tends to recall all the others._  In our explanation of \"complex\" formation we necessarily cited instances that illustrate this principle as well, since _recall is merely a reverse operation from that involved in \"complex\" formation_.  [Sidenote: _What Ordinary \"Thinking\" Amounts to_]  For example, in running through a book I come upon a flower pressed between its pages. At once the memory of the friend who gave it to me springs into consciousness and becomes the subject of reminiscence. This recalls the mountain village where we last met. This recalls the fact that a railroad was at the time under process of construction, which should transform the village into a popular resort. This in turn suggests my coming trip to the seashore, and I am reminded of a business appointment on which my ability to leave town on the appointed day depends. And so on indefinitely.  Far the greater part of your successive states of consciousness, or even of your ordinary \"thinking,\" commonly so-called, consists of trains of mental pictures \"suggested\" one by another. If the associated pictures are of the everyday type, common to everyone, you have a prosaic mind; if, on the other hand, the associations are unusual or unique, you are happily possessed of wit and fancy.  [Sidenote: _The Reverse of Complex Formation_]  These instances of the action of the Law of Recall illustrate but one phase of its activity. They show simply that groups of ideas are so strung together on the string of some common element that _the activity of one \"group\" in consciousness is apt to be automatically followed by the others. But the law of association goes deeper than this. It enters into the activity of every individual group, and causes all the elements of every group, ideas, emotions and impulses to muscular movements, to be simultaneously manifested._  [Sidenote: _Prolixity and Terseness_]  There is no principle to which we shall more continually refer than this one. Our explanation of hay fever a moment ago illustrates our meaning. Get the principle clearly in your mind, and see how many instances of its operation you can yourself supply from your own daily experience.  So far as the mere linking together of groups of ideas is concerned, this classifying quality is developed in some persons to a greater degree than in others. It finds its extreme exemplar in the type of man who can never relate an incident without reciting all the prolix and minute details and at the same time wandering far from the original subject in pursuit of every suggested idea.  [Sidenote: _The Law of Contiguity_]   Law II. _Similarity and nearness in time or space between two experiential facts causes the thought of one to tend to recall the thought of the other._  This is the Associative Law of Contiguity considered from the standpoint of recall. The points of contiguity are different for different individuals. Similarities and nearnesses will awaken all sorts of associated groups of ideas in one person that are not at all excitable in the same way in another whose experiences have been different.   Law III. _The greater the frequency and intensity of any given experience, the greater the ease and likelihood of its reproduction and recall._  [Sidenote: _Laws of Habit and Intensity_]  This explains why certain groups in any complex are more readily recalled than others--why some leap forth unbidden, why some come next and before others, why some arrive but tardily or not at all.  This is how the associative Laws of Habit and Intensity affect the power of recall.         *     *     *     *     *  [Sidenote: _Applications to Advertising_]  There is no department of business to which the application of these Laws of Recall is so apparent as the department of advertising. The most carefully worded and best-illustrated advertisement may fail to pay its cost unless the underlying principles of choice of position, selection of medium and size of space are understood. The advertisers in metropolitan newspapers and magazines of large circulation are the ones who have most at stake. But whatever the field to be reached, it is well to bear in mind certain facts based on the Laws of Recall that have been established by psychological experiment.  Most advertisers have a general idea that certain relative positions on the newspaper or magazine page are to be preferred over others, but they have no conception of the real differences in relative recall value. When the great cost of space in large publications is considered the financial value of such knowledge is evident.  By a great number of tests the relative recall value of every part of the newspaper page has been approximately determined. It has been found, for example, that a given space at the upper right-hand corner of the page has more than twice the value of the same amount of space in the lower left-hand corner.  [Sidenote: _Effect of Repetitions_]  Many advertisers adopt the policy of repeating full-page advertisements at long intervals instead of advertising in a small way continually. Laboratory tests have shown, on the contrary, that a quarter-page advertisement appearing in four successive issues of a newspaper is fifty per cent more effective than a full-page advertisement appearing only once. It does not follow, however, that an eighth-page advertisement repeated eight times is correspondingly more effective; for below a certain relative size the value of an advertisement decreases much more rapidly than the cost. There are, of course, modifying conditions, such as special sales of department stores, where occasional displays and announcements make it desirable to use either full pages, or even double pages, but the great bulk of advertising is not of this character.  [Sidenote: _Ratio of Size to Value_]  Every year in the United States alone six hundred millions of dollars are expended in advertising the sale of commodities, and for the most part expended in a haphazard, experimental and unscientific way. The investment of this vast sum with risk of perhaps total loss, or even possible injury, through the faulty construction or improper placing of advertisements should stimulate the interest of every advertiser in the work that psychologists have done and are doing toward the accumulation of a body of exact knowledge on this subject.  [Sidenote: _Risks in Advertising_]     THE SCIENCE OF FORGETTING  [Illustration: TESTING THE MEMORY WITH PROFESSOR JASTROW'S MEMORY APPARATUS PRIVATE LABORATORY, SOCIETY OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY]  [Illustration: Decorative Header]   CHAPTER V  THE SCIENCE OF FORGETTING   [Sidenote: _The Skilled Artisan_]  Attention is the instrumentality through which the Laws of Recall operate. Wittingly or unwittingly, consciously or unconsciously, every man's attention swings in automatic obedience to the Laws of Recall.  Attention is the artisan that, bit by bit, and with lightning quickness, constructs the mosaic of consciousness.  Having the whole vast store of all present and past experiences to draw upon, he selects only those groups and those isolated instances that are related to our general interests and aims. He disregards others.  [Sidenote: _How the Attention Works_]  The attention operates in a manner complementary to the general Laws of Recall. It is an active principle not of association, but of _dissociation_.  You choose, for example, a certain aim in life. You decide to become the inventor of an aeroplane of automatic stability. This choice henceforth determines two things. First, it determines just which of the sensory experiences of any given moment are most likely to be selected for your conscious perception. Secondly, it determines just which of your past experiences will be most likely to be recalled.  Such a choice, in other words, determines to some extent the sort of elements that will most probably be selected to make up at any"]]]
