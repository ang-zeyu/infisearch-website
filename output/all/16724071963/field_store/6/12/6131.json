Nor is he the sort of individual who can comfortably deceive himself about his fitness.  He sustains himself by no illusions of the variety: \"If I had so-and-so to do, I'd probably get through as well as nine-tenths of commanders would.\"  He is much more concerned to satisfy himself that his thoroughness is as complete as he could possibly have made it, than he is to \"get by\" and satisfy the powers that be!  So we know that it wasn't any mere longing for the scenes of his happy childhood which directed his choice of Tarbes garrison when he left the enchanting region of Fontainebleau, with its fairy forest, its delightful old town, and its many memories of Napoleon.  His mind seems to have been fixed upon a course involving more cavalry skill than was his on graduating.  And after two years at Tarbes, with much riding of the fine horses of Arabian breed which are the specialty of that region, he went to the Cavalry School at Saumur, on the Loire.  King René of Anjou, whose chronic poverty does not seem to have interfered with his taste for having innumerable castles, had one at Saumur, and it still dominates the town and lends it an air of medievalism.  Toward the end of the sixteenth century Saumur was one of the chief strongholds of Protestantism in France and the seat of a Protestant university.  But the revocation of the Edict of Nantes granting tolerance to the Huguenots, brought great reverses upon Saumur, whose inhabitants were driven into exile.  And thereupon (1685) the town fell into a decline which was not arrested until Louis XV, in the latter part of his reign, caused this cavalry school to be established there.  It is a large school, with about four hundred soldiers always in training as cavalry officers and army riding masters.  And the riding exhibitions which used to be given there in the latter part of August were brilliant affairs, worth going many miles to see.  There Ferdinand Foch studied cavalry tactics, practiced \"rough riding\" and--by no means least important--learned to know another type of Frenchman, the men of old Anjou.  In our own country of magnificent distances and myriad racial strains we are apt to think of French people as a single race: \"French is French.\"  This is very wide of the truth.  French they all are, in sooth, with an intense national unity surpassed nowhere on earth if, indeed, it is anywhere equaled.  But almost every one of them is intensely a provincial, too, and very \"set\" in the ways of his own section of country--which, usually, has been that of his forbears from time immemorial.  In the description I quoted in the second chapter, showing some of the types from the vicinity of Tarbes which frequent its horse market, one may get some idea of the extraordinary differences in the men of a single small region which is bordered by many little \"pockets\" wherein people go on and on, age after age, perpetuating their special traits without much admixture of other strains.  Not every part of France has so much variety in such small compass. But every province has its distinctive human qualities.  And between the Norman and the Gascon, the Breton and the Provençal, the man of Picardy and the man of Languedoc, there are greater temperamental differences than one can find anywhere else on earth in an equal number of square miles--except in some of our American cities.  To the commander of General Foch's type (and as we begin to study his principles we shall, I believe, see that they apply to command in civil no less than in military life) knowledge of different men's minds and the way they work is absolutely fundamental to success.  And his preparation for this mastery was remarkably thorough.  At Saumur he learned not only to direct cavalry operations, but to know the Angevin characteristics.  In each school he attended, beginning with Metz, he had close class association with men from many provinces, men of many types.  And this was valuable to him in preparing him to command under-officers in whom a rigorous uniformity of training could not obliterate bred-in-the-bone differences.  Many another young officer bent on \"getting on\" in the army would have felt that what he learned among his fellow officers of the provincial characteristics was enough.  But not so Ferdinand Foch.  Almost his entire comprehension of war is based upon men and the way they act under certain stress--not the way they might be expected to act, but the way they actually do act, and the way they can be led to act under certain stimulus _of soul_.  For Ferdinand Foch wins victories with men's souls--not just with their flesh and blood, nor even with their brains.  And to command men's souls it is necessary to understand them.     VI  FIRST YEARS IN BRITTANY  Upon leaving the cavalry school at Saumur, in 1878, Ferdinand Foch went, with the rank of captain of the Tenth Regiment of Artillery, to Rennes, the ancient capital of Brittany and the headquarters of France's tenth army corps.  He stayed at Rennes, as an artillery captain, for seven years.  It is not a particularly interesting city from some points of view, but it is a very \"livable\" one, and for a student like Foch it had many advantages.  The library is one of the best in provincial France and has many valuable manuscripts.  There is also an archaeological museum of antiquities found in that vicinity, many of them relating to prehistoric warfare.  Some good scientific collections are also treasured there.  What is now known as the University of Rennes was styled merely the \"college\" in the days of Foch's residence there.  But it did substantially the same work then as now, and among its faculty Foch undoubtedly found many who could give him able aid in his perpetual study of the past.  Rennes especially cherishes the memory of Bertrand du Guesclin, the great constable of France under King Charles V and the victorious adversary of Edward III.  This brilliant warrior, who drove the English, with their claims on French sovereignty, out of France, was a native of that vicinity.  And we may be sure that whatever special opportunity Rennes afforded of studying documents relating to his campaigns was fully improved by Captain Foch.  In that time, also, Foch had ample occasion to know the Bretons, who are, in some respects, the least French of all French provincials--being much more Celtic still than Gallic, although it is a matter of some fifteen hundred years since their ancestors, driven out of Britain by the Teutonic invasions, came over and settled \"Little Britain,\" or Brittany.  The Bretons maintained their independence of France for a thousand years, and only became united with it through the marriage of their last sovereign, Duchess Anne, with Charles VIII, in 1491 and--after his death--with his successor, Louis XII.  And even to-day, after more than four centuries of political union, the people of Brittany are French in name and in spirit rather than in speech, customs, or temperament.  Many of them do not speak or understand the French language.  Few of them, outside of the cities, have conformed appreciably to French customs.  Quaint, sturdy, picturesque folk they are--simple, for the most part, superstitious, tenacious of the old, suspicious of the new, and governable only by those who understand them.  Foch must have learned, in those seven years, not only to know the Bretons, but to like them and their rugged country very well.  For he has had, these many years past, his summer home near Morlaix on the north coast of Brittany.  It was from there that he was summoned into the great war on July 26, 1914.  In 1885 Captain Foch was called to Paris and entered the Superior School of War.  This institution, wherein he was destined to play in after years a part that profoundly affected the world's destiny, was founded only in 1878 as a training school for officers, connected with the military school which Louis XV established in 1751 to \"educate five hundred young gentlemen in all the sciences necessary and useful to an officer.\"  One of the \"young gentlemen\" who profited by this instruction was the little Corsican whom Ferdinand Foch so ardently venerated.  The building covers an area of twenty-six acres and faces the vast Champ-de-Mars, which was laid out about 1770 for the military school's use as a field for maneuvers.  This field is eleven hundred yards long and just half that wide.  It occupies all the ground between the school buildings and the river.  Across the river is the height called the Trocadéro, on which Napoleon hoped to build a great palace for the little King of Rome; but whereon, many years after he and his son had ceased to need mansions made by hands, the French republic built a magnificent palace for the French people.  This vast building, with its majestic gardens, was the principal feature of the French national exhibition of 1878, which, like its predecessor of 1867 and its successors of 1889 and 1900, was held on the Champ-de-Mars.  Facing the Trocadéro Palace, on the Champ-de-Mars, is the Eiffel Tower (nearly a thousand feet high) which was erected for the exposition of 1889, and has served, since, then-unimaginable purposes during the stress and strain of war as a wireless station.  The \"Ferris\" wheel put up for the exposition of 1900 is close by.  And a stone's throw from the military school are the Hôtel des Invalides, Napoleon's tomb, and the magnificent Esplanade des Invalides down which one looks straightway to the glinting Seine and over the superb Alexander III bridge toward the tree-embowered palaces of arts on the Champs-Élysées.  On the other side of the Hôtel des Invalides from that occupied by the military school and Champ-de-Mars is the principal diplomatic and departmental district of Paris, with many embassies (not ours, however, nor the British--which are across the river) and many"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17511"],["title","Foch the Man: A Life of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies (#5)"],["body","offices of the French nation.  Soldiers and government officials and foreign diplomats dominate the quarter--and homes of the old French aristocracy.  The Hotel des Invalides, founded by Louis XIV and designed to accommodate, as an old soldiers' home, some seven thousand veterans of his unending wars, has latterly served as headquarters for the military governor of Paris, and also--principally--as a war museum.  Here are housed collections of priceless worth and transcendent interest. The museum of artillery contains ten thousand specimens of weapons and armor of all kinds, ancient and modern.  The historical museum, across the court of honor, was--in the years when I spent many fascinating hours there--extraordinarily rich in personal souvenirs of scores of illustrious personages.  What it must be now, after the tragic years of a world war, and what it will become as a treasure house for the years to come, is beyond my imagination.  It was into this enormously rich atmosphere, pregnant with everything that conserves France's most glorious military traditions, that Captain Ferdinand Foch was called in 1885 for two years of intensive training and study.     VII  JOFFRE AND FOCH  After quitting the School of War in 1887 (he graduated fourth in his class, as he had at Saumur; he was third at Fontainebleau), Ferdinand Foch was sent to Montpellier as a probationer for the position of staff officer.  He remained at Montpellier for four years--first as a probationer and later as a staff officer in the Sixteenth Army Corps, whose headquarters are there.  [Illustration: Marshall Joffre, General Foch]  It is a coincidence--without special significance, but interesting--that Captain Joseph Joffre had spent several years at the School of Engineering in Montpellier; he left there in 1884, after the death of his young wife, to bury himself and his grief in Indo-China; so the two men did not meet in the southern city.[1]  Joffre returned from Indo-China in 1888, while Foch was at Montpellier, and after some time in the military railway service, and a promotion in rank (he was captain for thirteen years), received an appointment as professor of fortifications at Fontainebleau.  Some persons who claim to have known Joffre at Montpellier have manifested surprise at the greatness to which he attained thirty years later; he did not impress them as a man of destiny.  That is quite as likely to be their fault as his.  And also it is possible that Captain Joseph Joffre had not then begun to develop in himself those qualities which made him ready for greatness when the opportunity came.  If, however, any one has ever expressed surprise at Ferdinand Foch's attainment, I have not heard of it.  He seems always to have impressed people with whom he came in contact as a man of tremendous energy, application, and thoroughness.  The opportunities for study at Montpellier are excellent, and the region is one of extraordinary richness for the lover of history.  The splendor of the cities of Transalpine Gaul in this vicinity is attested by remains more numerous and in better preservation than Italy affords save in a very few places.  And awe-inspiring evidences of medievalism's power flank one at every step and turn.  Without doubt, Foch made the most of them.  Needless to remark, the commander-in-chief of the allied armies has not confided to me what were his favorite excursions during these four years at Montpellier.  But I am quite sure that Aigues-Mortes was one of them. And I like to think of him, as we know he looked then, pacing those battlements and pondering the warfare of those militant ages when this vast fortress in the wide salt marshes was one of the most formidable in the world.  What fullness of detail there must have been in the mental pictures he was able to conjure of St. Louis embarking here on his two crusades?  What particularity in his appreciation of those defenses!  The place is, to-day, the very epitome of desolation--much more so than if the fortifications were not so perfectly preserved.  For they look as if yesterday they might have been bristling with men-at-arms--whereas not in centuries has their melancholy majesty served any other purpose than that of raising reflections in those to whom the past speaks through her monuments.  From Montpellier, Ferdinand Foch returned to Paris, in February, 1891, as major on the general army staff.  He and Joffre had now the same rank.  Joffre became lieutenant colonel in 1894 and colonel in 1897; similar promotions came to Foch in 1896 and 1903.  He was six years later than Joffre in attaining a colonelcy, and exactly that much later in becoming a general.  Neither man had a quick rise but Foch's was (as measurable in grades and pay) specially slow.  About the time that Major Joffre went to the Soudan, to superintend the building of a railway in the Sahara desert, Major Foch went to Vincennes as commander of the mounted group of the Thirteenth Artillery.  Vincennes is on the southeastern skirts of Paris, close by the confluence of the Seine and the Marne; about four miles or so from the Bastille, which was the city's southeastern gate for three hundred years or thereabouts, until the fortified inclosure on that side of the city was enlarged under Louis XIV.  The fort of Vincennes was founded in the twelfth century to guard the approach to Paris from the Marne valley.  And on account of its pleasant situation--close to good hunting and also to their capital--the castle of Vincennes was a favorite residence of many early French kings.  It was there that St. Louis is said to have held his famous open-air court of justice, which he established so that his subjects might come direct to him with their troubles and he, besides settling them, might learn at first hand what reforms were needed.  Five Kings of France died there (among them Charles VI, the mad king, and Charles IX, haunted by the horrors of the massacre on St. Bartholomew's eve), and one King of England, Harry Hotspur.  King Charles V was born there.  From the days of Louis XI the castle has been used as a state prison. Henry of Navarre was once a prisoner there, and so was the Grand Condé, and Diderot, and Mirabeau, and it was there that the young Duc d'Enghien was shot by Napoleon's orders and to Napoleon's everlasting regret.  The castle is now (and has been for many years) an arsenal and school of musketry, artillery, and other military services.  Before its firing squad perish many traitors to France, whose last glimpse of the country they have betrayed is in the courtyard of this ancient castle.  The vicinity is very lovely.  The Bois de Vincennes, on the edge of which the castle stands, is scarcely inferior to the Bois de Boulogne in charm. We used to go out there, not infrequently, for luncheon, which we ate in a rustic summerhouse close to the edge of the lake, with many sociable ducks and swans bearing us company and clamoring for bits of bread.  It would be hard to imagine anything more idyllic, more sylvan, on the edge of a great city--anything more peaceful, restful, anywhere.  Yet the whole locality was, even then, a veritable camp of Mars--forts, barracks, fields for maneuvers and for artillery practice, infantry butts, rifle ranges, school of explosives; and what not.  France knew her need of protection--and none of us can ever be sufficiently grateful that she did!  But she did not obtrude her defensive measures.  She seldom made one conscious of her military affairs.  In Germany, for many years before this war, remembrance of the army and reverence to the army was exacted of everyone almost at every breath. Forever and forever and forever you were being made to bow down before the God of War.  In France, on the contrary, it was difficult to think about war--even in the very midst of a place like Vincennes--unless you were actually engaged in organizing and preparing the country's defenses.  After three years at Vincennes, Ferdinand Foch was recalled to the army staff in Paris.  And on the 31st of October, 1895, he was made associate professor of military history, strategy, and applied tactics, at the Superior School of War.  He had then just entered upon his forty-fifth year; and the thoroughness of his training was beginning to make itself felt at military headquarters.   [1] I have found it interesting to compare the careers of Joffre and Foch from the time they were at school together, and I daresay that others will like to know what steps forward he was taking who is not the subject of these chapters but inseparably bound up with him in many events and forever linked with him in glory.     VIII  THE SUPERIOR SCHOOL OF WAR  After a year's service as associate professor of military history, strategy, and applied tactics at the Superior School of War in Paris, Ferdinand Foch was advanced to head professorship in those branches and at the same time he was made lieutenant-colonel.  This was in 1896.  He was forty-five years old and had been for exactly a quarter of a century a student of the art of warfare.  His old schoolfellow, Joseph Joffre, was then building fortifications in northern Madagascar; and his army rank was the same as that of Foch.  It was just twenty years after Foch entered upon his full-fledged professorship at the Superior School of War that Marshal Joffre, speaking at a dinner assembling the principal leaders of the government and of the army, declared that without the Superior School of War the victory of the Marne would have been impossible.  All the world knows this now, almost as well as Marshal Joffre knew it then.  And all the world knows now as not even Marshal Joffre could have known then, how enormous far, far beyond the check of barbarism at the first battle of the Marne--is our debt and that of all posterity to the Superior School of War and, chiefly, to Ferdinand Foch.  It cannot have been prescience that called him there.  It was just Providence, nothing less!"]]]
