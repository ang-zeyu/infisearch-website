This flung and seized, he also climbed on board, but there was nothing abject in his appearance. Standing with his head thrown back and his nostrils quivering, he glared a moment at the group of natives; then, seizing a bar of iron, he made a bound forward, uttering a wild war-whoop.  There would have been bloodshed had not Mr. Hume, with surprising quietness, flung himself forward and seized the chief round the waist.  Compton, cool and ready, wrenched the bar away; and, seeing this, the natives plucked up spirit, calling on the white man to throw the \"black dog\" to the crocodiles, which had been attracted by the blood of their wounded fellow, still beating the water in his flurry.  Venning, however, stepped between with his rifle, and the uproar ceased once more.  \"Now,\" said Mr. Hume, holding the chief by his arm, \"what does this mean? What harm have those men done you?\"  \"My father has the lion's grip. Mawoh! Muata was a babe in his arms.\"  \"That may be, but it is no answer.\"  \"What harm! Did not my father hear the jackal give tongue?\"  \"I heard; and those jackals there\"--indicating the watching group-- \"yelped at me, so that I flung one into the water. But--what then? Do you seek to slay when your beast howls?\"  \"My father does not know, then.\"  \"I want to know, for it seems to me you were all mad together.\"  \"Ohe! it is the madness that slays. Ask of those mudfish there for news of the man who stood behind them to slay Muata, who had the gun aimed to shoot when Muata leapt into the water. Ask them, and they will lie.\"  \"What manner of man was this?\"  \"One of those who hound me in the canoe--even one of the man-hunters who seized my mother.\"  Mr. Hume looked at the boys. \"Did either of you see an Arab on board? Muata says a man was about to fire at him when he sprang overboard.\"  \"I thought he fell,\" said Compton. \"I saw no one with a gun.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Venning; \"but the Arab may have gone below.\"  Mr. Hume hailed the captain. \"My man said an attempt was made on his life. Have you taken an Arab onboard?\"  \"I have some mad English on board,\" said the captain, gruffly; \"and I will see they do not stay on longer than I can help.\"  \"As to that we will see.\"  The captain nodded his head and signaled full speed ahead, turning his back on the Englishman.  \"I think we can manage the lot,\" said Compton, coolly.  Mr. Hume laughed. \"Perhaps so; but it would be very awkward to be detained at the next station as prisoners, or to be sent back. We must let the matter slide.\"  \"Shall we search the ship, sir?\"  Mr. Hume shook his head. \"Suppose we found some suspicious passenger. What then? There was no actual attempt on Muata, and we have only his word; besides\"--and he glanced at the angry captain-- \"there is no need to look for trouble--it will come.\"  He was right. At the next station, reached within a few hours, the captain lodged a complaint to the  authorities in the persons of the Belgian officials, who  were evidently charmed with the opportunity of teaching the Englishmen a lesson.  First of all, they placed Muata in chains straight away on their finding that he was a dangerous person. When Mr. Hume protested, they placed him under restraint; and that done, they pronounced judgment. The English would pay a fine of Pounds 100, surrender their weapons, and return to Banana Point by the next steamer down.  \"Is that all?\"  \"That is all. But stay. As you will be possibly detained a fortnight, there would be a charge for  maintenance.\"  \"Be good enough,\" said Mr. Hume, producing a document,  \"to read that paper. It is a passport from the President of the Congo State-- your king--authorizing Mr. Hume and party to proceed with his servants by land or water anywhere within the State for purposes of exploration.\"  The officers examined the document with sour faces, and one of them made an observation in a low tone.  \"Precisely,\" said the other.  \"This document,\" he remarked, turning to Mr. Hume, \"is not in order. It has not been visaed by the officers at the sub-stations.\"  \"But it was initialed by your superior at the coast.\"  \"It must go back to the sub-stations for endorsement.\"  Mr. Hume put a restraint on his temper. \"And how long will that take?\"  \"Who knows? Perhaps a month.\"  \"And in the mean time?\"  \"In the mean time, m'sieur, you will remain our guests.\"  \"Is there no other way?\"  \"Monsieur must surrender himself to the unpleasant delay. There is no other way.\"  \"Unless--but m'sieur would not perhaps face the expense.\"  \"Explain, gentlemen.\"  \"There is a special transport for State business, but to call upon the service for other than State purpose there would be a charge of ten pounds per day.\"  \"I see.\" Mr. Hume saw that these gentlemen wished to make money out of him. \"Very good. I will myself go to the sub-stations by your special transport, and if the Governor says the charge is reasonable, I will pay on my return. I think that will meet the matter.\"  But it did not at all meet the matter, and the junior officer at once informed his senior that unhappily the special transport had that very morning developed a leak in the boiler.  There followed an embarrassing delay. The authorities waited for Mr. Hume to make a business-like proposal, but the hunter remained grimly silent. The two officers whispered.  \"Observe, m'sieur,\" said the senior, clearing his throat, \"my colleague suggests a middle way. If you will place sum demanded by the State in these cases, in the nature of a surety for good faith, we may permit you and your friends to proceed.\"  \"My servant also?\"  \"Your servant?\"  \"The man you have bound.\"  \"Ohe! Pardon, m'sieur; you are not aware that he is an offender against the laws--a notorious criminal. He will be detained and tried.\"  \"I will remain to attend his trial, unless a sum will secure his freedom also?\"  \"There is a price on his bead.\"  \"Offered by the slave-hunters?\"  The shot went home. The officers had been hand in glove with the lawless traders, but they did not want the matter bruited about by meddlesome Englishmen. They scowled.  \"He has broken the peace,\" said the senior, sharply; \"he has slain the servants of the State. Am I to understand that you claim to be his master, responsible for his conduct?\"  \"No, m'sieur,\" exclaimed the hunter, quickly, fearing he had gone too far, and shifting his ground. \"The man is a stranger; do with him as you please; but as for us, since we are here, we will, with your permission, make the place our headquarters. We could not be in better hands.\"  \"You wish to wait for another steamer while your passports are visaed?\"  \"We will proceed in our own boat, which we would put together.\"  \"Ah, you have a little boat?\"  \"A very small boat, m'sieur, with barely room for four men. We should be honoured to have your opinion on its qualities, and also upon our stores and their suitability.\"  Venning looked at Mr. Hume with puzzled eyes. He could not understand his callous abandonment of Muata.  \"But,\" he began, \"we cannot----\"  \"I think it is an excellent place,\" said Compton, quickly; \"and perhaps these gentlemen would be good enough to assist us with advice out of their great  experience.\"  \"We should be delighted,\" said Mr. Hume, politely.  The senior officer stroked his huge moustache with an air of renewed importance.  \"There are two spare rooms in my little house,\" murmured the junior-- \"one for the stores, the other for sleeping quarters.\"  \"It is understood,\" said Mr. Hume, \"that we pay rent, and also that we pay for the protection you may afford us. I insist on that, messieurs.\"  The senior nodded a dignified assent, but he was not quite won over, and retired to his quarters, while his junior inspected the landing of the goods, including the sections of the boat. In the afternoon, however, after his nap, the senior succumbed to the influence of a good cigar, and condescended to sample some of the stores. He was even pleased to crack a few jokes over the novel machinery for working the screw of the Okapi by levers, and in the  evening he invited Mr. Hume to a friendly game of cards, thoughtfully including in his invitation a bottle of brandy and a box of cigars, for, said he, he wished to wash out the execrable taste of the everlasting manioc.  All the day Muata stood bound to a post in the square, the central figure of a ring of squatting natives, who chewed manioc and discussed his approaching fate with much satisfaction.  He was there, an erect, stoical figure, when the boys sought their room in the little thatched house--a room bare of furniture, divided from the next compartment by hanging mats of native make.  \"It's a beastly shame,\" said Venning, for about the fourth time, as he stared out at the black faces reflected in the blazing log-fires.  \"What is a shame?\" asked Compton, who was inspecting the  partition before seeking his hammock.  \"You know well enough. Not a soul stands by the chief; even his jackal bolted as soon as he jumped ashore.\"  \"Because Muata ordered him. He is probably watching from  the dark.\"  \"All the worse for us, then. I never thought Mr. Hume would have knuckled down so easily. Hark at him shouting over the game.\"  \"What is the game, do you think?\"  \"Cards,\" snorted Venning, in disgust.  \"So! Queer sort of partition this;\" and Compton moved the mat aside. \"No need for doors, you see. Hulloa! Who are you?\"  \"Me Zanzibar boy, master,\" exclaimed a soft, oily voice.  \"Then clear out.\"  \"Me put here watch my master--see black fellows no steal.\"  \"Oh, I see.  Chuck a cake of tobacco, Venning. Here! You like that?\"  \"Ver good,\" said the boy, reaching out a yellow hand for the tobacco.  Venning crossed over and peered into the other room. \"You boy,\" he said, \"tell me, what will they do to Muata?\"  The Zanzibari chuckled. \"You want know, eh?\"  \"We don't care. One black fellow does not matter,\" said Compton, coolly.  \"You brute!\" "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],["title","In Search of the Okapi (#8)"],["body","Venning, but stopped as Compton's hand gripped him.  The Zanzibari chuckled again. \"What you give, eh, if cut loose that Muata?\"  \"What do you say?\"  \"You pay me? Good. In night Muata is loose. He run up river. Bymby master go along in little boat, pick Muata up, eh? What you pay?\" and the boy chuckled softly.  \"Suppose I tell your white master, you rascal?\"  \"Wow! You tell, they kill poor Zanzibar boy.\"  \"Then clear out,\" said Compton, launching a kick; \"and if I see any more of you I will tell.\"  The boy turned sulky. \"Me guard--me stay.\"  \"You go,\" said Compton, \"or I will call your masters, and let them deal with you.\"  Growling under his breath, the self-styled \"guard\" slunk soft-footed out of the room.  Compton struck a match and looked around the apartment, then turned to Venning with a grin.  \"That is the game,\" he whispered.  \"I think I understand,\" Venning replied softly. \"That fellow was testing you?\"  Compton nodded.  \"And you think Mr. Hume has not forgotten Muata?\"  \"I am sure he has not.\"  They crept into their hammocks, but not to sleep, and they were wide awake when Mr. Hume entered noisily some two hours later.  \"To-morrow night,\" he shouted boisterously.  \"With pleasure, and the night after, for good visitors are rare,\" called the Belgian.  \"And good hosts also. Touching those two men you promised as the crew for my boat?\"  \"They will be here to-morrow evening,\" said the senior officer, thrusting a head round the mat. \"Ah, you are comfortable, eh? Yes, I sent a messenger to Hassan's camp by the vessel which brought you. Rest well.\"  \"They are good fellows, these Arabs,\" said Mr. Hume, with enthusiasm--\"good fellows. I remember once----\"  \"To-morrow night,\" said the officer, as he withdrew, laughing.  Mr. Hume hummed cheerfully as he prepared for bed, taking no notice of his young comrades, who were regarding  him with silent disfavour.  With one yawn after another he blew out the light, and struggled into his hammock, to fall asleep almost at once.  Venning's uneasiness returned. He tossed restlessly, listening to the unaccustomed noises from without, and as the hours went by, and at last the sound of talking about the fires died off in a lazy drone, the desire to see what had become of Muata was too strong to resist. Softly he lowered himself to the earth-floor, but, soft as he moved, others had heard.  \"Are the mosquitoes troublesome?\"  Venning started at the deep voice so unexpected. \"I did not know you were awake, sir.\"  \"I sleep very lightly my boy.\"  \"As you are awake, sir, I would like to say----\"  But he stopped as the mat rustled.  \"Come in,\" said Mr. Hume.  \"Me guard, great master\"--in the same soft, oily tones Venning had heard before. \"Hear noise. Think may be thieves.\"  \"Mosquitoes, not thieves,\" said Mr. Hume, quietly. \"Bring a light.\"  The Zanzibar boy complied, and, holding a taper above his head, looked not for mosquitoes, but at the rifles in the corner.  \"The skeeters, master,\" he muttered, with an evil squint at Compton, who was blinking at the light.  \"Better get back into your hammock, Venning. You can go, boy; and keep a good watch, for we are coming to the thieves' hour.\"  The man showed his white teeth in a grin as he withdrew.  \"Don't stir from your hammocks until I do,\" said Mr. Hume, very sternly, in a whisper; then louder, \"Good night, Venning.\"  \"Good night, sir,\" said Venning, convinced that the master was alive to the game, and more easy in his mind.  As he dropped off to sleep he heard the wail of a jackal, and next he was awakened by the sound of a native chanting. It was already daybreak, and Mr. Hume stood on the verandah, having drawn the mats aside.  The sun, striking under the thatch, shone on the hunter's tawny hair and beard, and Venning wondered how for a moment he could have doubted the courage of a man with such a lion-like head. But he was to receive another shock.  \"Silence, dog!\" roared the hunter, addressing the singer, evidently.  Compton, who was sitting on his hammock dressing, looked out.  \"By Jove,\" he muttered, \"he's shouting at Muata!\"  Venning jumped down to the floor and looked out. Muata was still bound to the post, and, with his face to the sun, was chanting his words of greeting or of farewell in tones that lacked the deep chest-notes of his war-cry.  One of the natives, hearing the order of the white man, flung a stick at the chief with an insult; but Muata, nothing heeding, sang on his slow song in a voice that was almost like a woman's.  \"Must white men lose their sleep because a robber is to die?\" roared the hunter again.  Venning snatched up a beaker of water and ran out barefooted. He held the water to the chiefs mouth. Muata turned his smouldering eyes on the boy, sucked in a mouthful of the water, and then shot it out over Venning's outstretched arm.  Venning dropped the mug, and went back with a red face to see the two officers regarding him with sour faces.  \"Serve you right,\" shouted Mr. Hume, in apparent fury. \"When will you learn to treat a black like the brute he is?\"  \"Quite so,\" said the senior officer, showing himself. \"I am glad to find you have no ridiculous sentiment.\"  \"Ah! good morning, my friend,\" said Mr. Hume, heartily. \"As for my young comrade, you must pardon him.\"  \"He has his lesson,\" said the officer, dryly, as he pointed to the soaked pyjama.  \"The man woke me with his singing. I have seen men shot for less than that.\"  \"In good time,\" said the officer, with a sinister look, \"the accusers will be here to-night, and to-morrow\"--he made a gesture-- \"to-morrow you can also choose the two men you need for your boat's crew.\"  After breakfast, Mr. Hume had an opportunity of speaking without the fear of being overheard, for they finished putting the Okapi together, and worked her out by the levers into the river, where she gleamed in the sun.  \"I dare say you think I am a brute,\" he said, \"and I don't blame you; but if we mean to save Muata's life, we must appear to be altogether indifferent to his fate. Those men are keeping a close watch on us.\"  \"I know it,\" said Compton.  \"You do, eh?\"  \"That Zanzibar boy was spying on us last night before you came, and he tried to get us to bribe him to free Muata.\"  \"I hope you were not so foolish as to fall into the trap?\" said the hunter, sharply.  \"I kicked him out of the place,\" said Compton. \"I told Venning you were playing a game for Muata's life.\"  \"You did me justice?\" said Mr. Hume, with his gaze on Venning.  \"It seemed to me terrible to leave him without a word of encouragement,\" said the boy; \"but I am awfully sorry I doubted you, sir.\"  \"You don't now, eh? Well, that's all right, and I think the chief knows too. That is why he spouted the water over you.\"  \"A strange way of showing his gratitude,\" laughed the boy, with a reddening face at the thought of the outrage.  \"Not so strange. He saw the Belgians, and did it to put them off their guard.\"  \"That ought to help us in our plans for his escape.\"  \"We have plans, have we?\"  \"You have,\" said Compton, confidently; \"and your plan is our plan.\"  \"Thank you,\" said the hunter, quietly. \"If the plan is to succeed, it must work to-night. I do not fear these people here, but I must say I fear the Arabs who are expected this evening.\"  \"I understand that you will choose two of those Arabs as boatmen?\"  \"The Belgians have arranged that, Compton, not I. Have you any suggestions to offer?\"  \"I think, sir, that we should get all our things stored in the boat to-day,\" said Venning.  \"Eight; and then?\"  \"And then,\" said Venning, his face all alight with ardour--\"and then--why, sir, then you shoot one of the hippos over there on that little island. Shoot two; and while all the people in the village are cutting them up for a great feed, we could free Muata undetected.\"  \"That is not so bad,\" said Compton, judiciously.  \"Not at all,\" said Mr. Hume. \"But when Muata is free, what is to become of him--suppose, that is, he can get away unobserved?\"  \"I have it,\" said Compton. \"The Zanzibar spy suggested it. Let Muata wait for us up the river, and we will pick him up.\"  Mr. Hume stroked his beard for some moments in silence.  \"We'll, try that plan,\" he said finally; \"but don't show any excitement. The native, remember, is a very keen observer. Now pull the boat in.\"    CHAPTER VI  THE FLIGHT  In the afternoon the village hummed with excitement. The word had gone round that the new white man who had shot the crocodile would give a feast, and the people squatted in rows on the bank watching a couple of their stalwart fellows preparing a canoe for an expedition after the river-horse.  When Mr. Hume appeared with his Express in company with the Belgian officers, who were indifferent sportsmen, the people saluted him with a feeling of gratitude for favours to come in the shape of fat meat.  \"Good luck,\" said the junior officer, \"but I back the animals; they are very wary and very fierce.\"  \"What is the betting?\" cried the hunter.  \"Oh no, my friend!\" exclaimed the senior. \"Keep your money for to- night; and don't drown yourself. We must have one game, you know.\"  \"Very well. By the way, Compton?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You and Venning may as well amuse yourselves by getting the stores on board in case we leave to-morrow.\"  \"That depends on how the game goes,\" replied the officer. \"If you win, we must keep you for a return match.\"  \"That is only fair. But I may lose; so, my lads, go on with the packing.\"  The boat went off up the river hugging the banks, and the whole village sat down to watch the stalk, all but a few who went to and fro between Venning at the house and Compton in the boat, carrying the stores. The two officers turned in, with mats drawn, to enjoy their siesta, and the guards on duty sought the shade of the trees by the bank to watch the hunt.  The hunt was not a matter to be decided out of hand, by a swift paddle straight up to the sand-bank in the river, and a chance shot.  The canoe crept up slowly and passed out"]]]
