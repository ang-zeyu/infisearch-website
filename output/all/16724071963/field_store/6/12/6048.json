Deh!  foss' il mio cuor lento e'l duro seno   A chi pianta dal ciel si buon terreno.    Canzone.    Ridonsi donne e giovani amorosi   M' occostandosi attorno, e perche scrivi,   Perche tu scrivi in lingua ignota e strana   Verseggiando d'amor, e come t'osi?   Dinne, se la tua speme sia mai vana   E de pensieri lo miglior t' arrivi;   Cosi mi van burlando, altri rivi   Altri lidi t' aspettan, & altre onde   Nelle cui verdi sponde   Spuntati ad hor, ad hor a la tua chioma                              10   L'immortal guiderdon d 'eterne frondi   Perche alle spalle tue soverchia soma?   Canzon dirotti, e tu per me rispondi   Dice mia Donna, e'l suo dir, e il mio cuore   Questa e lingua di cui si vanta Amore.    IV    Diodati, e te'l diro con maraviglia,   Quel ritroso io ch'amor spreggiar solea   E de suoi lacci spesso mi ridea   Gia caddi, ov'huom dabben talhor s'impiglia.   Ne treccie d'oro, ne guancia vermiglia   M' abbaglian si, ma sotto nova idea   Pellegrina bellezza che'l cuor bea,   Portamenti alti honesti, e nelle ciglia   Quel sereno fulgor d' amabil nero,   Parole adorne di lingua piu d'una,                                   10   E'l cantar che di mezzo l'hemispero   Traviar ben puo la faticosa Luna,   E degil occhi suoi auventa si gran fuoco   Che l 'incerar gli oreechi mi fia poco.    V    Per certo i bei vostr'occhi Donna mia   Esser non puo che non fian lo mio sole   Si mi percuoton forte, come ci suole   Per l'arene di Libia chi s'invia,   Mentre un caldo vapor (ne senti pria)   Da quel lato si spinge ove mi duole,   Che forsi amanti nelle lor parole   Chiaman sospir; io non so che si sia:   Parte rinchiusa, e turbida si cela   Scosso mi il petto, e poi n'uscendo poco                             10   Quivi d' attorno o s'agghiaccia, o s'ingiela;   Ma quanto a gli occhi giunge a trovar loco   Tutte le notti a me suol far piovose   Finche mia Alba rivien colma di rose.    VI    Giovane piano, e semplicetto amante   Poi che fuggir me stesso in dubbio sono,   Madonna a voi del mio cuor l'humil dono   Faro divoto; io certo a prove tante   L'hebbi fedele, intrepido, costante,   De pensieri leggiadro, accorto, e buono;   Quando rugge il gran mondo, e scocca il tuono,   S 'arma di se, e d' intero diamante,   Tanto del forse, e d' invidia sicuro,   Di timori, e speranze al popol use                                   10   Quanto d'ingegno, e d' alto valor vago,   E di cetra sonora, e delle muse:   Sol troverete in tal parte men duro   Ove amor mise l 'insanabil ago.    VII   How soon hath Time the suttle theef of youth,   Stoln on his wing my three and twentith yeer!   My hasting dayes flie on with full career,   But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th,   Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,   That I to manhood am arriv'd so near,   And inward ripenes doth much less appear,   That som more timely-happy spirits indu'th.   Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow.   It shall be still in strictest measure eev'n,                        10   To that same lot, however mean, or high,   Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heav'n;   All is, if I have grace to use it so,   As ever in my great task Masters eye.     VIII    Captain or Colonel, or Knight in Arms,   Whose chance on these defenceless dores may sease,   If ever deed of honour did thee please,   Guard them, and him within protect from harms,   He can requite thee, for he knows the charms   That call Fame on such gentle acts as these,   And he can spred thy Name o're Lands and Seas,   What ever clime the Suns bright circle warms.   Lift not thy spear against the Muses Bowre,   The great Emathian Conqueror bid spare                               10   The house of Pindarus, when Temple and Towre   Went to the ground: And the repeated air   Of sad Electra's Poet had the power   To save th' Athenian Walls from ruine bare.

IX    Lady that in the prime of earliest youth,   Wisely hath shun'd the broad way and the green,   And with those few art eminently seen,   That labour up the Hill of heav'nly Truth,   The better part with Mary and with Ruth,   Chosen thou hast, and they that overween,   And at thy growing vertues fret their spleen,   No anger find in thee, but pity and ruth.   Thy care is fixt and zealously attends   To fill thy odorous Lamp with deeds of light,   And Hope that reaps not shame.  Therefore be sure   Thou, when the Bridegroom with his feastfull friends   Passes to bliss at the mid hour of night,   Hast gain'd thy entrance, Virgin wise and pure.

X    Daughter to that good Earl, once President   Of Englands Counsel, and her Treasury,   Who liv'd in both, unstain'd with gold or fee,   And left them both, more in himself content,   Till the sad breaking of that Parlament   Broke him, as that dishonest victory   At Chaeronea, fatal to liberty   Kil'd with report that Old man eloquent,   Though later born, then to have known the dayes   Wherin your Father flourisht, yet by you                             10   Madam, me thinks I see him living yet;   So well your words his noble vertues praise,   That all both judge you to relate them true,   And to possess them, Honour'd Margaret.

Part of an entertainment presented to the Countess Dowager of   Darby at Harefield, by som Noble persons of her Family, who   appear on the Scene in pastoral habit, moving toward the seat   of State with this Song.    I. SONG.    LOOK Nymphs, and Shepherds look,   What sudden blaze of majesty   Is that which we from hence descry   Too divine to be mistook:   This this is she   To whom our vows and wishes bend,   Heer our solemn search hath end.    Fame that her high worth to raise,   Seem'd erst so lavish and profuse,   We may justly now accuse                                             10   Of detraction from her praise,   Less then half we find exprest,   Envy bid conceal the rest.    Mark what radiant state she spreds,   In circle round her shining throne,   Shooting her beams like silver threds,   This this is she alone,   Sitting like a Goddes bright,   In the center of her light.   Might she the wise Latona be,                                        20   Or the towred Cybele,   Mother of a hunderd gods;   Juno dare's not give her odds;   Who had thought this clime had held   A deity so unparalel'd?    As they com forward, the genius of the Wood appears, and   turning toward them, speaks.    GEN. Stay gentle Swains, for though in this disguise,   I see bright honour sparkle through your eyes,   Of famous Arcady ye are, and sprung   Of that renowned flood, so often sung,   Divine Alpheus, who by secret sluse,                                 30   Stole under Seas to meet his Arethuse;   And ye the breathing Roses of the Wood,   Fair silver-buskind Nymphs as great and good,   I know this quest of yours, and free intent   Was all in honour and devotion ment   To the great Mistres of yon princely shrine,   Whom with low reverence I adore as mine,   And with all helpful service will comply   To further this nights glad solemnity;   And lead ye where ye may more neer behold                            40   What shallow-searching Fame hath left untold;   Which I full oft amidst these shades alone   Have sate to wonder at, and gaze upon:   For know by lot from Jove I am the powr   Of this fair wood, and live in Oak'n bowr,   To nurse the Saplings tall, and curl the grove   With Ringlets quaint, and wanton windings wove.   And all my Plants I save from nightly ill,   Of noisom winds, and blasting vapours chill.   And from the Boughs brush off the evil dew,                          50   And heal the harms of thwarting thunder blew,   Or what the cross dire-looking Planet smites,   Or hurtfull Worm with canker'd venom bites.   When Eev'ning gray doth rise, I fetch my round   Over the mount, and all this hallow'd ground,   And early ere the odorous breath of morn   Awakes the slumbring leaves, or tasseld horn   Shakes the high thicket, haste I all about,   Number my ranks, and visit every sprout   With puissant words, and murmurs made to bless,                      60   But els in deep of night when drowsines   Hath lockt up mortal sense, then listen I   To the celestial Sirens harmony,   That sit upon the nine enfolded Sphears,   And sing to those that hold the vital shears,   And turn the Adamantine spindle round,   On which the fate of gods and men is wound.   Such sweet compulsion doth in musick ly,   To lull the daughters of Necessity,   And keep unsteddy Nature to her law,                                 70   And the low world in measur'd motion draw   After the heavenly tune, which none can hear   Of human mould with grosse unpurged ear;   And yet such musick worthiest were to blaze   The peerles height of her immortal praise,   Whose lustre leads us, and for her most fit,   If my inferior hand or voice could hit   Inimitable sounds, yet as we go,   What ere the skill of lesser gods can show,   I will assay, her worth to celebrate,                                80   And so attend ye toward her glittering state;   Where ye may all that are of noble stemm   Approach, and kiss her sacred vestures hemm.     2. SONG.    O're the smooth enameld green   Where no print of step hath been,   Follow me as I sing,   And touch the warbled string.   Under the shady roof   Of branching Elm Star-proof,   Follow me,                              "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1745"],["title","The Poetical Works of John Milton (#7)"],["body","                             90   I will bring you where she sits   Clad in splendor as befits   Her deity.   Such a rural Queen   All Arcadia hath not seen.     3. SONG.    Nymphs and Shepherds dance no more   By sandy Ladons Lillied banks.   On old Lycaeus or Cyllene hoar,   Trip no more in twilight ranks,   Though Erynanth your loss deplore,                                  100   A better soyl shall give ye thanks.   From the stony Maenalus,   Bring your Flocks, and live with us,   Here ye shall have greater grace,   To serve the Lady of this place.

LYCIDAS.     In this Monody the Author bewails a learned Friend,   unfortunatly drown'd in his Passage from Chester on the Irish   Seas, 1637.  And by occasion foretels the ruine of our   corrupted Clergy then in their height.    YET once more, O ye Laurels, and once more   Ye Myrtles brown, with Ivy never-sear,   I com to pluck your Berries harsh and crude,   And with forc'd fingers rude,   Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.   Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear,   Compels me to disturb your season due:   For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime   Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer:   Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew   Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.                          10   He must not flote upon his watry bear   Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,   Without the meed of som melodious tear.    Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well,   That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring,   Begin, and somwhat loudly sweep the string.   Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse,   So may som gentle Muse   With lucky words favour my destin'd Urn,                             20   And as he passes turn,   And bid fair peace be to my sable shrowd.   For we were nurst upon the self-same hill,   Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill.    Together both, ere the high Lawns appear'd   Under the opening eye-lids of the morn,   We drove a field and both together heard   What time the Gray-fly winds her sultry horn,   Batt'ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night,   Oft till the Star that rose, at Ev'ning, bright                      30   Toward Heav'ns descent had slop'd his westering wheel.   Mean while the Rural ditties were not mute,   Temper'd to th'Oaten Flute;   Rough Satyrs danc'd, and Fauns with clov'n heel,   From the glad sound would not be absent long,   And old Damoetas lov'd to hear our song.    But O the heavy change, now thou art gon,   Now thou art gon, and never must return!   Thee Shepherd, thee the Woods, and desert Caves,   With wilde Thyme and the gadding Vine o'regrown,                     40   And all their echoes mourn.   The Willows, and the Hazle Copses green,   Shall now no more be seen,   Fanning their joyous Leaves to thy soft layes.   As killing as the Canker to the Rose,   Or Taint-worm to the weanling Herds that graze,   Or Frost to Flowers, that their gay wardrop wear,   When first the White thorn blows;   Such, Lycidas, thy loss to Shepherds ear.    Where were ye Nymphs when the remorseless deep                       50   Clos'd o're the head of your lov'd Lycidas?   For neither were ye playing on the steep,   Where your old Bards, the famous Druids ly,   Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,   Nor yet where Deva spreads her wisard stream:   Ay me, I fondly dream!   Had ye bin there--for what could that have don?   What could the Muse her self that Orpheus bore,   The Muse her self, for her inchanting son   Whom Universal nature did lament,                                    60   When by the rout that made the hideous roar,   His goary visage down the stream was sent,   Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore.    Alas! What boots it with uncessant care   To tend the homely slighted Shepherds trade,   And strictly meditate the thankles Muse,   Were it not better don as others use,   To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,   Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?   Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise                    70   (That last infirmity of Noble mind)   To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes:   But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find,   And think to burst out into sudden blaze.   Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears,   And slits the thin spun life.  But not the praise,   Phoebus repli'd, and touch'd my trembling ears;   Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,   Nor in the glistering foil   Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies,                       80   But lives and spreds aloft by those pure eyes,   And perfet witnes of all judging Jove;   As he pronounces lastly on each deed,   Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed.    O Fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd floud,   Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocall reeds,   That strain I heard was of a higher mood:   But now my Oate proceeds,   And listens to the Herald of the Sea   That came in Neptune's plea,                                         90   He ask'd the Waves, and ask'd the Fellon winds,   What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?   And question'd every gust of rugged wings   That blows from off each beaked Promontory,   They knew not of his story,   And sage Hippotades their answer brings,   That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd,   The Ayr was calm, and on the level brine,   Sleek Panope with all her sisters play'd.   It was that fatall and perfidious Bark                              100   Built in th'eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,   That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.    Next Camus, reverend Sire, went footing slow,   His Mantle hairy, and his Bonnet sedge,   Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge   Like to that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe.   Ah; Who hath reft (quoth he) my dearest pledge?   Last came, and last did go,   The Pilot of the Galilean lake,   Two massy Keyes he bore of metals twain,                            110   (The Golden opes, the Iron shuts amain)   He shook his Miter'd locks, and stern bespake,   How well could I have spar'd for thee, young swain,   Anow of such as for their bellies sake,   Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold?   Of other care they little reck'ning make,   Then how to scramble at the shearers feast,   And shove away the worthy bidden guest.   Blind mouthes! that scarce themselves know how to hold   A Sheep-hook, or have learn'd ought els the least                   120   That to the faithfull Herdmans art belongs!   What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;   And when they list, their lean and flashy songs   Grate on their scrannel Pipes of wretched straw,   The hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed,   But swoln with wind, and the rank mist they draw,   Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:   Besides what the grim Woolf with privy paw   Daily devours apace, and nothing sed,   But that two-handed engine at the door,                             130   Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.    Return Alpheus, the dread voice is past,   That shrunk thy streams; Return Sicilian Muse,   And call the Vales, and bid them hither cast   Their Bels, and Flourets of a thousand hues.   Ye valleys low where the milde whispers use,   Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,   On whose fresh lap the swart Star sparely looks,   Throw hither all your quaint enameld eyes,   That on the green terf suck the honied showres,                     140   And purple all the ground with vernal flowres.   Bring the rathe Primrose that forsaken dies.   The tufted Crow-toe, and pale Gessamine,   The white Pink, and the Pansie freakt with jeat,   The glowing Violet.   The Musk-rose, and the well attir'd Woodbine.   With Cowslips wan that hang the pensive hed,   And every flower that sad embroidery wears:   Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,   And daffadillies fill their cups with tears,                            150   And strew the Laureat Herse where Lycid lies.   For so to interpose a little ease,   Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.   Ah me! Whilst thee the shores, and sounding Seas   Wash far away, where ere thy bones are hurl'd   Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides.   Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide   Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;   Or whether thou to our moist vows deny'd,   Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,                              160   Where the great vision of the guarded Mount   Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold;   Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth.   And, O ye Dolphins, waft the haples youth.    Weep no more, woful Shepherds weep no more,   For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,   Sunk though he be beneath the watry floar,   So sinks the day-star in the Ocean bed,   And yet anon repairs his drooping head,   And tricks his beams, and with new spangled Ore,                    170   Flames in the forehead of the morning"]]]
