I think I have never seen so sudden a change of expression take place in the face of any man. Even in that imperfect light I saw him blanch. I saw a hard glitter come into his eyes. He spoke, evenly, but hoarsely:  \"Put those things down----there, on the table; anywhere.\"  I obeyed him without demur; for something in his manner had chilled me with foreboding.  \"You did not break that stalk?\"  \"No. I found it as you see it.\"  \"Have you smelled the petals?\"  I shook my head. Thereupon, having his eyes fixed upon me with the strangest expression in their gray depths, Nayland Smith said a singular thing.  \"Pronounce, slowly, the words _Sâkya Mûni,_'\" he directed.  I stared at him, scarce crediting my senses; but----  \"I mean it!\" he rapped. \"Do as I tell you.\"  \"Sâkya Mûni,\" I said, in ever increasing wonder.  Smith laughed unmirthfully.  \"Go into the bathroom and thoroughly wash your hands,\" was his next order. \"Renew the water at least three times.\" As I turned to fulfill his instructions, for I doubted no longer his deadly earnestness: \"Beeton!\" he called.  Beeton, very white-faced and shaky, came out from the bedroom as I entered the bathroom, and whist I proceeded carefully to cleanse my hands I heard Smith interrogating him.  \"Have any flowers been brought into the room today, Beeton?\"  \"Flowers, sir? Certainly not. Nothing has ever been brought in here but what I have brought myself.\"  \"You are certain of that?\"  \"Positive.\"  \"Who brought up the meals, then?\"  \"If you'll look into my room here, sir, you'll see that I have enough tinned and bottled stuff to last us for weeks. Sir Gregory sent me out to buy it on the day we arrived. No one else had left or entered these rooms until you came to-night.\"  I returned to find Nayland Smith standing tugging at the lobe of his left ear in evident perplexity. He turned to me.  \"I find my hands over full,\" he said. \"Will you oblige me by telephoning for Inspector Weymouth? Also, I should be glad if you would ask M. Samarkan, the manager, to see me here immediately.\"  As I was about to quit the room--  \"Not a word of our suspicions to M. Samarkan,\" he added; \"not a word about the brass box.\"  I was far along the corridor ere I remembered that which, remembered earlier, had saved me the journey. There was a telephone in every suite. However, I was not indisposed to avail myself of an opportunity for a few moments' undisturbed reflection, and, avoiding the lift, I descended by the broad, marble staircase.  To what strange adventure were we committed? What did the brass coffer contain which Sir Gregory had guarded night and day? Something associated in some way with Tibet, something which he believed to be \"the key of India\" and which had brought in its train, presumably, the sinister \"man with a limp.\"  Who was the \"man with the limp\"? What was the Si-Fan? Lastly, by what conceivable means could the flower, which my friend evidently regarded with extreme horror, have been introduced into Hale's room, and why had I been required to pronounce the words \"Sâkya Mûni\"?  So ran my reflections--at random and to no clear end; and, as is often the case in such circumstances, my steps bore them company; so that all at once I became aware that instead of having gained the lobby of the hotel, I had taken some wrong turning and was in a part of the building entirely unfamiliar to me.  A long corridor of the inevitable white marble extended far behind me. I had evidently traversed it. Before me was a heavily curtained archway. Irritably, I pulled the curtain aside, learnt that it masked a glass-paneled door, opened this door--and found myself in a small court, dimly lighted and redolent of some pungent, incense-like perfume.  One step forward I took, then pulled up abruptly. A sound had come to my ears. From a second curtained doorway, close to my right hand, it came--a sound of muffled _tapping_, together with that of something which dragged upon the floor.  Within my brain the words seemed audibly to form: \"The man with the limp!\"  I sprang to the door; I had my hand upon the drapery ... when a woman stepped out, barring the way!  No impression, not even a vague one, did I form of her costume, save that she wore a green silk shawl, embroidered with raised white figures of birds, thrown over her head and shoulders and draped in such fashion that part of her face was concealed. I was transfixed by the vindictive glare of her eyes, of her huge dark eyes.  They were ablaze with anger--but it was not this expression within them which struck me so forcibly as the fact that they were in some way familiar.  Motionless, we faced one another. Then--  \"You go away,\" said the woman--at the same time extending her arms across the doorway as barriers to my progress.  Her voice had a husky intonation; her hands and arms, which were bare and of old ivory hue, were laden with barbaric jewelry, much of it tawdry silverware of the bazaars. Clearly she was a half-caste of some kind, probably a Eurasian.  I hesitated. The sounds of dragging and tapping had ceased. But the presence of this grotesque Oriental figure only increased my anxiety to pass the doorway. I looked steadily into the black eyes; they looked into mine unflinchingly.  \"You go away, please,\" repeated the woman, raising her right hand and pointing to the door whereby I had entered. \"These private rooms. What you doing here?\"  Her words, despite her broken English, served to recall to me the fact that I was, beyond doubt, a trespasser! By what right did I presume to force my way into other people's apartments?  \"There is some one in there whom I must see,\" I said, realizing, however, that my chance of doing so was poor.  \"You see nobody,\" she snapped back uncompromisingly. \"You go away!\"  She took a step towards me, continuing to point to the door. Where had I previously encountered the glance of those splendid, savage eyes?  So engaged was I with this taunting, partial memory, and so sure, if the woman would but uncover her face, of instantly recognizing her, that still I hesitated. Whereupon, glancing rapidly over her shoulder into whatever place lay beyond the curtained doorway, she suddenly stepped back and vanished, drawing the curtains to with an angry jerk.  I heard her retiring footsteps; then came a loud bang. If her object in intercepting me had been to cover the slow retreat of some one she had succeeded.  Recognizing that I had cut a truly sorry figure in the encounter, I retraced my steps.  By what route I ultimately regained the main staircase I have no idea; for my mind was busy with that taunting memory of the two dark eyes looking out from the folds of the green embroidered shawl. Where, and when, had I met their glance before?  To that problem I sought an answer in vain.  The message despatched to New Scotland Yard, I found M. Samarkan, long famous as a _mâitre d' hôtel_ in Cairo, and now host of London's newest and most palatial _khan_. Portly, and wearing a gray imperial, M. Samarkan had the manners of a courtier, and the smile of a true Greek.  I told him what was necessary, and no more, desiring him to go to suite 14a without delay and also without arousing unnecessary attention. I dropped no hint of foul play, but M. Samarkan expressed profound (and professional) regret that so distinguished, though unprofitable, a patron should have selected the New Louvre, thus early in its history, as the terminus of his career.  \"By the way,\" I said, \"have you Oriental guests with you, at the moment?\"  \"No, monsieur,\" he assured me.  \"Not a certain Oriental lady?\" I persisted.  M. Samarkan slowly shook his head.  \"Possibly monsieur has seen one of the _ayahs?_ There are several Anglo-Indian families resident in the New Louvre at present.\"  An _ayah?_ It was just possible, of course. Yet ...   CHAPTER IV  THE FLOWER OF SILENCE   \"We are dealing now,\" said Nayland Smith, pacing restlessly up and down our sitting-room, \"not, as of old, with Dr. Fu-Manchu, but with an entirely unknown quantity--the Si-Fan.\"  \"For Heaven's sake!\" I cried, \"what is the Si-Fan?\"  \"The greatest mystery of the mysterious East, Petrie. Think. You know, as I know, that a malignant being, Dr. Fu-Manchu, was for some time in England, engaged in 'paving the way' (I believe those words were my own) for nothing less than a giant Yellow Empire. That dream is what millions of Europeans and Americans term 'the Yellow Peril! Very good. Such an empire needs must have----\"  \"An emperor!\"  Nayland Smith stopped his restless pacing immediately in front of me.  \"Why not an _empress_, Petrie!\" he rapped.  His words were something of a verbal thunderbolt; I found myself at loss for any suitable reply.  \"You will perhaps remind me,\" he continued rapidly, \"of the lowly place held by women in the East. I can cite notable exceptions, ancient and modern. In fact, a moment's consideration by a hypothetical body of Eastern dynast-makers not of an emperor but of an empress. Finally, there is a persistent tradition throughout the Far East that such a woman will one day rule over the known peoples. I was assured some years ago, by a very learned pundit, that a princess of incalculably ancient lineage, residing in some secret monastery in Tartary or Tibet, was to be the future empress of the world. I believe this tradition, or the extensive group who seek to keep it alive and potent, to be what is called the Si-Fan!\"  I was past greater amazement; but--  \"This lady can be no longer young, then?\" I asked.  \"On the contrary, Petrie, she remains always young and beautiful by means of a continuous series of reincarnations; also she thus conserves the collated wisdom of many ages. In short, she is the archetype of Lamaism. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],["title","The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#3)"],["body","secret of Lama celibacy is the existence of this immaculate ruler, of whom the Grand Lama is merely a high priest. She has, as attendants, maidens of good family, selected for their personal charms, and rendered dumb in order that they may never report what they see and hear.\"  \"Smith!\" I cried, \"this is utterly incredible!\"  \"Her body slaves are not only mute, but blind; for it is death to look upon her beauty unveiled.\"  I stood up impatiently.  \"You are amusing yourself,\" I said.  Nayland Smith clapped his hands upon my shoulders, in his own impulsive fashion, and looked earnestly into my eyes.  \"Forgive me, old man,\" he said, \"if I have related all these fantastic particulars as though I gave them credence. Much of this is legendary, I know, some of it mere superstition, but--I am serious now, Petrie-- _part of it is true_.\"  I stared at the square-cut, sun-tanned face; and no trace of a smile lurked about that grim mouth. \"Such a woman may actually exist, Petrie, only in legend; but, nevertheless, she forms the head center of that giant conspiracy in which the activities of Dr. Fu-Manchu were merely a part. Hale blundered on to this stupendous business; and from what I have gathered from Beeton and what I have seen for myself, it is evident that in yonder coffer\"--he pointed to the brass chest standing hard by--\"Hale got hold of something indispensable to the success of this vast Yellow conspiracy. That he was followed here, to the very hotel, by agents of this mystic Unknown is evident. But,\" he added grimly, \"they have failed in their object!\"  A thousand outrageous possibilities fought for precedence in my mind.  \"Smith!\" I cried, \"the half-caste woman whom I saw in the hotel ...\"  Nayland Smith shrugged his shoulders.  \"Probably, as M. Samarkan suggests, an _ayah!_\" he said; but there was an odd note in his voice and an odd look in his eyes.  \"Then again, I am almost certain that Hale's warning concerning 'the man with the limp' was no empty one. Shall you open the brass chest?\"  \"At present, decidedly _no_. Hale's fate renders his warning one that I dare not neglect. For I was with him when he died; and they cannot know how much _I_ know. How did he die? How did he die? How was the Flower of Silence introduced into his closely guarded room?\"  \"The Flower of Silence?\"  Smith laughed shortly and unmirthfully.  \"I was once sent for,\" he said, \"during the time that I was stationed in Upper Burma, to see a stranger--a sort of itinerant Buddhist priest, so I understood, who had desired to communicate some message to me personally. He was dying--in a dirty hut on the outskirts of Manipur, up in the hills. When I arrived I say at a glance that the man was a Tibetan monk. He must have crossed the river and come down through Assam; but the nature of his message I never knew. He had lost the power of speech! He was gurgling, inarticulate, just like poor Hale. A few moments after my arrival he breathed his last. The fellow who had guided me to the place bent over him--I shall always remember the scene--then fell back as though he had stepped upon an adder.  \"'He holds the Flower Silence in his hand!' he cried--'the Si-Fan! the Si-Fan!'--and bolted from the hut.\"  \"When I went to examine the dead man, sure enough he held in one hand a little crumpled spray of flowers. I did not touch it with my fingers naturally, but I managed to loop a piece of twine around the stem, and by that means I gingerly removed the flowers and carried them to an orchid-hunter of my acquaintance who chanced to be visiting Manipur.  \"Grahame--that was my orchid man's name--pronounced the specimen to be an unclassified species of _jatropha;_ belonging to the _Curcas_ family. He discovered a sort of hollow thorn, almost like a fang, amongst the blooms, but was unable to surmise the nature of its functions. He extracted enough of a certain fixed oil from the flowers, however, to have poisoned the pair of us!\"  \"Probably the breaking of a bloom ...\"  \"Ejects some of this acrid oil through the thorn? Practically the uncanny thing stings when it is hurt? That is my own idea, Petrie. And I can understand how these Eastern fanatics accept their sentence-- silence and death--when they have deserved it, at the hands of their mysterious organization, and commit this novel form of _hara-kiri_. But I shall not sleep soundly with that brass coffer in my possession until I know by what means Sir Gregory was induced to touch a Flower of Silence, and by what means it was placed in his room!\"  \"But, Smith, why did you direct me to-night to repeat the words, 'Sâkya Mûni'?\"  Smith smiled in a very grim fashion.  \"It was after the episode I have just related that I made the acquaintance of that pundit, some of whose statements I have already quoted for your enlightenment. He admitted that the Flower of Silence was an instrument frequently employed by a certain group, adding that, according to some authorities, one who had touched the flower might escape death by immediately pronouncing the sacred name of Buddha. He was no fanatic himself, however, and, marking my incredulity, he explained that the truth was this;--  \"No one whose powers of speech were imperfect could possibly pronounce correctly the words 'Sâkya Mûni.' Therefore, since the first effects of this damnable thing is instantly to tie the tongue, the uttering of the sacred name of Buddha becomes practically a test whereby the victim my learn whether the venom has entered his system or not!\"  I repressed a shudder. An atmosphere of horror seemed to be enveloping us, foglike.  \"Smith,\" I said slowly, \"we must be on our guard,\" for at last I had run to earth that elusive memory. \"Unless I am strangely mistaken, the 'man' who so mysteriously entered Hale's room and the supposed _ayah_ whom I met downstairs are one and the same. Two, at least, of the Yellow group are actually here in the New Louvre!\"  The light of the shaded lamp shone down upon the brass coffer on the table beside me. The fog seemed to have cleared from the room somewhat, but since in the midnight stillness I could detect the muffled sounds of sirens from the river and the reports of fog signals from the railways, I concluded that the night was not yet wholly clear of the choking mist. In accordance with a pre-arranged scheme we had decided to guard \"the key of India\" (whatever it might be) turn and turn about through the night. In a word--we feared to sleep unguarded. Now my watch informed me that four o'clock approached, at which hour I was to arouse Smith and retire to sleep to my own bedroom.  Nothing had disturbed my vigil--that is, nothing definite. True once, about half an hour earlier, I had thought I heard the dragging and tapping sound from somewhere up above me; but since the corridor overhead was unfinished and none of the rooms opening upon it yet habitable, I concluded that I had been mistaken. The stairway at the end of our corridor, which communicated with that above, was still blocked with bags of cement and slabs of marble, in fact.  Faintly to my ears came the booming of London's clocks, beating out the hour of four. But still I sat beside the mysterious coffer, indisposed to awaken my friend any sooner than was necessary, particularly since I felt in no way sleepy myself.  I was to learn a lesson that night: the lesson of strict adherence to a compact. I had arranged to awaken Nayland Smith at four; and because I dallied, determined to finish my pipe ere entering his bedroom, almost it happened that Fate placed it beyond my power ever to awaken him again.  At ten minutes past four, amid a stillness so intense that the creaking of my slippers seemed a loud disturbance, I crossed the room and pushed open the door of Smith's bedroom. It was in darkness, but as I entered I depressed the switch immediately inside the door, lighting the lamp which swung form the center of the ceiling.  Glancing towards the bed, I immediately perceived that there was something different in its aspect, but at first I found this difference difficult to define. I stood for a moment in doubt. Then I realized the nature of the change which had taken place.  A lamp hung above the bed, attached to a movable fitting, which enabled it to be raised or lowered at the pleasure of the occupant. When Smith had retired he was in no reading mood, and he had not even lighted the reading-lamp, but had left it pushed high up against the ceiling.  It was the position of this lamp which had changed. For now it swung so low over the pillow that the silken fringe of the shade almost touched my friend's face as he lay soundly asleep with one lean brown hand outstretched upon the coverlet.  I stood in the doorway staring, mystified, at this phenomenon; I might have stood there without intervening, until intervention had been too late, were it not that, glancing upward toward the wooden block from which ordinarily the pendant hung, I perceived that no block was visible, but only a round, black cavity from which the white flex supporting the lamp swung out.  Then, uttering a horse cry which rose unbidden to my lips, I sprang wildly across the room ... for now I had seen something else!  Attached to one of the four silken tassels which ornamented the lamp-shade, so as almost to rest upon the cheek of the sleeping man, was a little corymb of bloom ... the _Flower of Silence!_  Grasping the shade with my left hand I seized the flex with my right, and as Smith sprang upright in bed, eyes wildly glaring, I wrenched with all my might. Upward my gaze was set; and I glimpsed a yellow hand, with long, pointed finger nails. There came a loud resounding snap; an electric spark spat venomously from the circular opening above the bed; and, with the cord and lamp still fast in my grip, I went rolling across the carpet--as the other lamp became instantly extinguished.  Dimly I perceived Smith, arrayed in pyjamas, jumping out upon the opposite side of the bed.  \"Petrie, Petrie!"]]]
