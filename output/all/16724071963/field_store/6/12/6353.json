'Not long,' was his comment on my reply. How long had I been in the Army? What unit was I in before? Where had I been educated? When I had answered these questions he expressed himself satisfied; so I saluted and departed. So I am on quite good terms with him so far, despite his terrible reputation! The question is--how long shall I remain on good terms with him? I wonder.\"  The next letter (June 14) recounts one of those solemn Battalion parades which I recollect so well--those parades concerning which copious orders used to be issued the night before, and in preparation for which we were instructed in the formula which we (platoon commanders) had to employ when the Colonel, to the accompaniment of sweet sounds from the band, reached the edge of our platoons:  \"We had a Battalion parade in a large field this morning. There was a long type-written programme of the ceremony to be gone through. We paraded on the company parade ground at 8 a.m. and the Colonel arrived on the Battalion parade ground at 9 a.m. He rode round the Battalion. When he reached my platoon he called me up to him and asked me whether I had a roll of my platoon. I replied that I had. He asked me whether I had it on me; and I replied that I had, and produced it. He seemed perfectly satisfied. He also asked me one or two other questions; to all of which I was able to give a satisfactory answer. And last night as I passed him in the road and saluted he smiled most affably and said 'good evening.' So he is quite agreeable with me so far. I do not therefore yet join in the general condemnation of him. As far as I can tell at present his chief faults appear to me to be: that he suffers from a badly swelled head; that he fancies himself a budding Napoleon; that he is endowed by the fates with a very bad temper and a most vile tongue; that he is inconsiderate of his inferiors wherever his personal whims and ambitions are concerned; and that he is engrossed with an inordinate desire to be in the good graces of the Brigadier-General, who is really, I believe, a very good sort. Apart from those failings, some of which are, perhaps, excusable, I think he is probably all right. You may be sure that his unpopularity will not prejudice me against him; I shall not join in the general condemnation unless and until he gives me good reason. As yet I have no such reason. Up to now his personality is merely a source of curiosity and amusement.  \"During the course of the morning's training, Captain Andrews rearranged the composition of the platoons in the Company; so I now command the eighth platoon. Sergeant Clews is the name of the platoon sergeant. Sergeant Dawson (who saw Norman Kemp killed and has the same high opinion of his heroic qualities as everybody else, whether officer, N.C.O., or man, who knew him; who tells me that he was by far the most loved officer in the Battalion--'one who will never be forgotten') is also in my platoon.  \"In the afternoon I went with the Company on a bathing parade. It was about half an hour's march. They bathed in a canal.  \"After tea I had a stroll in the country: it is very pretty, especially this weather....  \"Captain Andrews goes home on leave to-night; so Lieutenant Halstead is in command of B Company for a fortnight.\"   \"June 15th.  \"The weather continues hot. We had another Battalion parade this morning: procedure the same as yesterday. The Colonel is still most agreeable; he has not said a cross word to me yet.  \"We took the afternoon easy, except that there was a parade for inspection of equipment at 4 p.m.  \"I received, this afternoon, a letter from you of June 11, and one from Mother of June 10, also enclosures. I am sorry to learn that you are both worrying. What's the use of worrying? What is there to worry about? I am quite safe. If I had the 'wind up' it might be another matter; but I do not, strange to say, even dread the time when we shall go back into the line! I think it rather exciting. One is inclined to feel a little 'windy' when shells and 'minnies' are bursting dangerously near, or when a machine-gun spurts out of the gloaming; but there is a certain element of excitement about it all. I would not have missed those few days in the Salient for worlds. I had a pleasant 'baptism of fire' there. Everybody seems to think that it was worse than going over the top in a push. Those who fought at the Battle of the Somme last year say that they would rather be there than in the place where we were last week! Candidly, I cannot understand it.  \"We shall remain out of the line for some time yet--so cheer up!\"     CHAPTER V  THE MARCH   I now come to one of the most remarkable, and in some respects certainly the most comical, of all the episodes in which Colonel Best-Dunkley figured--the memorable march from Millain to Westbecourt. The following lengthy epistle which I wrote in my billet in the Vale of Acquin at Westbecourt the following day draws a perfectly accurate picture of what happened:  \"You will be interested to learn that we have moved again. We are now billeted in a pretty little village in the heart of north-eastern France....  \"Yesterday, Saturday June 16, 1917--the hundred and second anniversary of Ligny and Quatre Bras--is a day I am not likely ever to forget. Such a march we had; and it was _some_ stunt! Let me tell you, as far as I can without naming places, the whole story.  \"Reveille sounded at 3 a.m. I rose at 5 a.m. We (the officers) had breakfast at 5.30. Parade at 6. At 6.45 we marched off from the village in which we had been billeted during the last few days. It was a very long march which we had before us to the village in which we now are--a distance of sixteen miles. Yet we were expecting to arrive there by midday! I will show you how events turned out so that we did not arrive here anything like midday. The weather was, and is, just as it has been all the time--a cloudless sky and a burning sun. It was already quite warm when we set off, and as the morning advanced the sun naturally became more powerful still. We joined up with the rest of the Brigade a little further on, and marched past General Stockwell and Major Thompson (the Brigade-Major).\"  It was in the streets of Watten that we marched past Stockwell; and I vividly recollect that he was not at all pleased with things as early as that. I distinctly heard the word 'rabble' burst from his lips! The letter proceeds:  \"Men began to fall out before we reached the first village (or town as it happened to be). And as soon as the falling out began it continued without ceasing, only becoming more frequent the farther we got. I do think they began falling out too early. Every time a man fell out we subalterns had to drop behind with him and give him a chit. That naturally took time and one got right behind; then one would endeavour to catch up again; as soon as one was back with one's own platoon--generally before--one would come across more men of one's company who had fallen out, and so would get right back again. Thus it went on the whole time. It meant that we had double the walking to do that the men had; and we were loaded like Christmas trees just like them. Fortunately there was a mess cart with the Transport, containing still lemonade; so I had a drink now and then. It is an Army idea that one should not drink on the march: that it knocks one up much quicker. I say frankly, from experience, that it is nonsense. I drank as much as I could get hold of on the way (by no means as much as I could have drunk!) and though I was jolly tired I was as fresh as anybody else, and a good deal fresher than the majority, as you will see later. Well, after the first halt the falling out became dreadful; it was almost impossible for us to cope with the number of chits required; crowds must have been without chits at all. The whole roadside became one mass of exhausted men lying full length. Some were very bad indeed, some had sunstroke, some were sick, more than one were dying. At one time the padre and I were a long way behind, attending to these men. We hurried on to catch up the Battalion. The Transport, under Humfrey, were just behind the Battalion, so we followed along the Transport. When we got to the front end of it we saw nothing beyond! 'Where is the Battalion?' I asked Humfrey. He informed me that he had lost it. The Adjutant had, at the last turning, sent the Battalion one way and the Transport another; and he (Humfrey) had not the faintest idea where he was to go to! So he halted and got out a map. Then the Medical Officer (Adam) arrived on the scene too. We told him that the Battalion had disappeared. So we (Newman, Adam, Humfrey, and myself) sat down for about five minutes and discussed the situation. It struck us as being rather comical, though we wished that we were at the end of our journey instead of in a strange village and ignorant of which way we were to go. Humfrey decided to take his Transport the same way as the remainder of the Brigade Transport had gone; so we went on with him! We went across some very open country. The sun was simply burning down upon us. I felt very exhausted now; but I can stick almost anything in the way of a route march; no route march could, in my opinion, be as bad as that memorable Kidlington-Yarnton route march in March, 1916. The difficulty then was fatigue caused by the march through thick, soft slushy snow when vaccination was just at its worst; the difficulty this time was fatigue and thirst caused by the heat of a French summer. I admit that this route march yesterday was a stern test of endurance; but if I could stick the Kidlington-Yarnton stunt I could stick this, and I did stick this all the way, which very few others did! The trail which we left behind us was a sight to be seen: men, rifles, equipment, riderless horses all over; the Retreat from Moscow was spoken of!

[Illustration:]  And his father was called Black Jumbo.  [Illustration:]  And Black Mumbo made him a beautiful little Red Coat, and a pair of beautiful little Blue Trousers.  [Illustration:]  And Black Jumbo went to the Bazaar and bought him a beautiful Green Umbrella and a lovely little Pair of Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles and Crimson Linings.  And then wasn't Little Black Sambo grand?  [Illustration:]  So he put on all his Fine Clothes and went out for a walk in the Jungle.  [Illustration:]  And by and by he met a Tiger. And the Tiger said to him, \"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\"  [Illustration:]  And Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and I'll give you my beautiful little Red Coat.\"  [Illustration:]  So the Tiger said, \"Very well, I won't eat you this time, but you must give me your beautiful little Red Coat.\" So the Tiger got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Red Coat, and went away saying,  \"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"  [Illustration:]  And Little Black Sambo went on, and by and by he met another Tiger, and it said to him, \"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\"  [Illustration:]  And Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and I'll give you my beautiful little Blue Trousers.\"  [Illustration:]  So the Tiger said, \"Very well, I won't eat you this time, but you must give me your beautiful little Blue Trousers.\" So the Tiger got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Blue Trousers, and went away saying, \"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"  [Illustration:]  And Little Black Sambo went on and by and by he met another Tiger, and it said to him, \"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\" And Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and I'll give you my beautiful little Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles and Crimson Linings.\"  [Illustration:]  [Illustration:]  But the Tiger said, \"What use would your shoes be to me? I've got four feet and you've got only two.\"  [Illustration:]  \"You haven't got enough shoes for me.\" But Little Black Sambo said, \"You could wear them on your ears.\"  \"So I could,\" said the Tiger, \"that's a very good idea. Give them to me, and I won't eat you this time.\"  So the Tiger got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles and Crimson Linings, and went away saying, \"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"  [Illustration:]  And by and by Little Black Sambo met another Tiger, and it said to him, \"Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!\"  [Illustration:]  And Little Black Sambo said, \"Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up and I'll give you my beautiful Green Umbrella.\" But the Tiger said, \"How can I carry an umbrella when I need all my paws for walking with?\"  [Illustration:]  \"You could tie a knot on your tail, and carry it that way,\" said Little Black Sambo.  [Illustration:]  \"So I could,\" said the Tiger. \"Give it to me and I won't eat you this time.\"  [Illustration:]  So he got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful Green Umbrella, and went away saying, \"Now _I_'m the grandest Tiger in the Jungle.\"  And poor Little Black Sambo went away crying, because the cruel Tigers had taken all his fine clothes.  [Illustration:]  Presently he heard a horrible noise that sounded like \"Gr-r-r-r-rrrrrrr,\" and it got louder and louder.  \"Oh dear!\" said Little Black Sambo, \"There are all the Tigers coming back to eat me up! What shall I do?\"  So he ran quickly to a palm-tree,  [Illustration:]  And peeped round it to see what the matter was.  And there he saw all the Tigers fighting and disputing which of them was the grandest.  And at last they all got so angry that they jumped up and took off all the fine clothes and began to tear each other with their claws and bite each other with their great big white teeth.  [Illustration:]  And they came, rolling and tumbling, right to the foot of the very tree where Little Black Sambo was hiding, but he jumped quickly in behind the umbrella. And the Tigers all caught hold of each others' tails.  [Illustration:]  As they wrangled and scrambled, and so they found themselves in a ring around the tree.  Then, when the Tigers were very wee and very far away, Little Black Sambo jumped up and called out,  \"Oh! Tigers! why have you taken off all your nice clothes? Don't you want them any more?\"  [Illustration:]  But the Tigers only answered \"Gr-r-r-rrrrr!\"  [Illustration:]  Then Little Black Sambo said, \"If you want them, say so, or I'll take them away.\" But the Tigers would not let go of each others' tails, and so they could only say \"Gr-r-r-rrrrrr!\"  [Illustration:]  And the Tigers were very, very angry, but still they would not let go of each others' tails. And they were so angry that they ran round the tree, trying to eat each other up, and they ran faster and faster till they were whirling round so fast that you couldn't see their legs at all.  [Illustration:]  And they still ran faster and faster and faster, till they all just melted away, and then there was nothing left but a great big pool of melted butter (or \"ghi\" as it is called in India) round the foot of the tree.  Now Black Jumbo was just coming home from his work, with a great big brass pot in his arms, and when he saw what was left of all the Tigers, he said,  \"Oh! what lovely melted butter! I'll take that home to Black Mumbo for her to cook with.\"  So he put it all into the great big brass pot, and took it home to Black Mumbo to cook with.  When Black Mumbo saw the melted butter, wasn't she pleased!  \"Now,\" said she, \"we'll all have pancakes for supper!\"  [Illustration:]  So she got flour and eggs and milk and sugar and butter, and she made a huge big plate of most lovely pancakes. And she fried them in the melted butter which the Tigers had made, and they were just as yellow and brown as little Tigers.  And then they all sat down to supper. And Black Mumbo ate Twenty-seven pancakes, and Black Jumbo ate Fifty-five, but Little Black Sambo ate a Hundred and Sixty-nine, because he was so hungry.
