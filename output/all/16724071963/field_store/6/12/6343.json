He can't see us now.\"  So away ran the rabbit gentleman and the squirrel boys, but soon the fox had dried his eyes on his big brush of a tail, and on he came after them.  \"Oh, I'll get you!  I'll get you!\" he cried, running very fast.  But Uncle Wiggily and Billie and Johnnie ran fast, too.  The fox was coming closer, however, and Billie, looking back, said:  \"Oh, I know what let's do, Uncle Wiggily.  Let's take the path that leads over the duck pond ocean.  That's shorter, and we can get to your bungalow before the fox can catch us.  He won't dare come across the bridge over the duck pond, for Old Dog Percival will come out and bite him if he does.\"  \"Very well,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"over the bridge we will go.\"  But alas!  Also sorrowfulness and sadness!  When the three friends got to the bridge it wasn't there.  The wind had blown the bridge down, and there was no way of getting across the duck pond ocean, for neither Uncle Wiggily nor the squirrel boys could swim very well.  \"Oh, what are we going to do?\" cried Billie, sadly.  \"We must get across somehow!\" chattered Johnnie, \"for here comes the fox!\"  And, surely enough the fox was coming, having by this time gotten all the water out of his eyes, so he could see very well.  \"Oh, if we only had a boat!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, looking along the shore of the pond, but there was no boat to be seen.  Nearer and nearer came the fox!  Uncle Wiggily and the squirrel boys were just going to jump in the water, whether or not they could swim, when, all at once, a big white birch tree on the edge of the woods near the pond, said:  \"Listen, Uncle Wiggily and I will save you.  Strip off some of my bark. It will not hurt me, and you can make a little canoe boat of it, as the Indians used to do.  Then, in the birch bark boat you can sail across the water and the fox can't get you.\"  \"Good!  Thank you!\" cried the bunny uncle.  With their sharp teeth he, Billie and Johnnie peeled off long strips of birch bark.  They quickly bent them in the shape of a boat and sewed up the ends with long thorns for needles and ribbon grass for thread.  \"Quick!  Into the birch bark boat!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, and they all jumped in, just as the fox came along.  Billie and Johnnie held up their bushy tails, and Uncle Wiggily held up his tall silk hat for sails, and soon they were safe on the other shore and the fox, not being able to swim, could not get them.  So that's how the birch tree of the woods saved the bunny uncle and the squirrels, for which, I am very glad, as I want to write more stories about them.  And if the gold fish doesn't tickle the wax doll's nose with his tail when she looks in the tank to see what he has for breakfast, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the butternut tree.     STORY X  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BUTTERNUT TREE  \"Well, I declare!\" exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper of Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit, as she looked in the pantry of the hollow stump bungalow one day.  \"Well, I do declare!\"  \"What's the matter?\" asked Mr. Longears, peeping over the top of his spectacles.  \"I hope that the chimney hasn't fallen down, or the egg beater run away with the potato masher.\"  \"No, nothing like that,\" Nurse Jane said.  \"But we haven't any butter!\"  \"No butter?\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, sort of puzzled like, and abstracted.  \"Not a bit of butter for supper,\" went on Nurse Jane, sadly.  \"Ha!  That sounds like something from Mother Goose.  Not a bit of butter for supper,\" laughed Uncle Wiggily.  \"Not a bit of batter-butter for the pitter-patter supper.  If Peter Piper picked a pit of peckled pippers--\"  \"Oh, don't start that!\" begged Nurse Jane.  \"All I need is some supper for butter--no some bupper for batter--oh, dear!  I'll never get it straight!\" she cried.  \"I'll say it for you,\" said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.  \"I know what you want--some butter for supper.  I'll go get it for you.\"  \"Thank you,\" Nurse Jane exclaimed, and so the old rabbit gentleman started off over the fields and through the woods for the butter store.  The monkey-doodle gentleman waited on him, and soon Uncle Wiggily was on his way back to the hollow stump bungalow with the butter for supper, and he was thinking how nice the carrot muffins would taste, for Nurse Jane had promised to make some, and Uncle Wiggily was sort of smacking his whiskers and twinkling his nose, when, all at once, he heard some one in the woods calling:  \"Uncle Wiggily!  Oh, I say, Uncle Wiggily!  Can't you stop for a moment and say how-d'-do?\"  \"Why, of course, I can,\" answered the bunny, and, looking around the corner of an old log, he saw Grandpa Whackum, the old beaver gentleman, who lived with Toodle and Noodle Flat-tail, the beaver boys.  \"Come in and sit down for a minute and rest yourself,\" invited Grandpa Whackum.  \"I will,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"And I'll leave my butter outside where it will be cool,\" for Grandpa Whackum lived down in an underground house, where it was so warm, in summer, that butter would melt.  Grandpa Whackum was a beaver, and he was called Whackum because he used to whack his broad, flat tail on the ground, like beating a drum, to warn the other beavers of danger.  Beavers, you know, are something like big muskrats, and they like water.  Their tails are flat, like a pancake or egg turner.  \"Well, how are things with you, and how is Nurse Jane?\" asked Grandpa Whackum.  \"Oh, everything is fine,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Nurse Jane is well. I've just been to the store to get her some butter.\"  \"That's just like you; always doing something for some one,\" said Grandpa Whackum, pleased like.  Then the two friends talked for some little while longer, until it was almost 6 o'clock, and time for Uncle Wiggily to go.  \"I'll take my butter and travel along,\" he said.  But when he went outside, where he had left the pound of butter on a flat stump, it wasn't there.  \"Why, this is queer,\" said the bunny uncle.  \"I wonder if Nurse Jane could have come along and taken it to the hollow stump bungalow herself?\"  \"More likely a bad fox took the butter,\" spoke the old gentleman beaver.  \"But we can soon tell.  I'll look in the dirt around the stump and see whose footprints are there.  A fox makes different tracks from a muskrat.\"  So Grandpa Whackum looked and he said:  \"Why, this is queer.  I can only see beaver tracks and rabbit tracks near the stump.  Only you and I were here and we didn't take anything.\"  \"But where is my butter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  Just then, off in the woods, near the beaver house, came the sound of laughter and voices cailed:  \"Oh, it's my turn now, Toodle.\"  \"Yes, Noodle, and then it's mine.  Oh, what fun we are having, aren't we?\"  \"It's Toodle and Noodle--my two beaver grandsons,\" said Grandpa Whackum.  \"I wonder if they could have taken your butter?  Come; we'll find out.\"  They went softly over behind a clump of bushes and there they saw Toodle and Noodle sliding down the slanting log of a tree, that was like a little hill, only there was no snow on it.  \"Why, they're coasting!\" cried Grandpa Whackum.  \"And how they can do it without snow I don't see.\"  \"But I see!\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Those two little beaver boys have taken my butter that I left outside of your house and with the butter they have greased the slanting log until it is slippery as ice.  That's how they slide down--on Nurse Jane's butter.\"  \"Oh, the little rascals!\" cried Grandpa Whackum.  \"Well, they didn't mean anything wrong,\" Uncle Wiggily kindly said. Then he called; \"Toodle!  Noodle!  Is any of my butter left?\"  \"Your butter?\" cried Noodle, surprised like.  \"Was that your butter?\" asked Toodle.  \"Oh, please forgive us!  We thought no one wanted it, and we took it to grease the log so we could slide down.  It was as good as sliding down a muddy, slippery bank of mud into the lake.\"  \"We used all your butter,\" spoke Noodle.  \"Every bit.\"  \"Oh, dear!  That's too bad!\" Uncle Wiggily said.  \"It is now after 6 o'clock and all the stores will be closed.  How can I get more?\"  And he looked at the butter the beaver boys had spread on the tree.  It could not be used for bread, as it was all full of bark.  \"Oh, how can I get some good butter for Nurse Jane?\" asked the bunny uncle sadly.  \"Ha!  I will give you some,\" spoke a voice high in the air.  \"Who are you?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, startled.  \"I am the butternut tree,\" was the answer.  \"I'll drop some nuts down and all you will have to do will be to crack them, pick out the meats and squeeze out the butter.  It is almost as good as that which you buy in the store.\"  \"Good!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, \"and thank you.\"  Then the butter tree rattled down some butternuts, which Uncle Wiggily took home, and Nurse Jane said the butter squeezed from them was very good.  And Toodle and Noodle were sorry for having taken Uncle Wiggily's other butter to make a slippery tree slide, but they meant no harm.  So if the pussy cat doesn't take the lollypop stick to make a mud pie, and not give any ice cream cones to the rag doll, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Lulu's hat.     STORY XI  UNCLE WIGGILY AND LULU'S HAT  \"Uncle Wiggily, do you want to do something for me?\" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, of the rabbit gentleman one day as he started out from his hollow stump bungalow to take a walk in the woods.  \"Do something for you, Nurse Jane?  Why, of course, I want to,\" spoke Mr. Longears.  \"What is it?\"  \"Just take this piece of pie over to Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck lady,\" went on Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.  \"I promised to let her taste how I made apple pie out of cabbage leaves.\"  \"And very cleverly you do it, too,\" said Uncle Wiggily, with a polite bow.  \"I know, for I have eaten some myself.  I will gladly take this pie to Mrs. Wibblewobble,\" and off through the woods Uncle Wiggily started with it.  He soon reached the duck lady's house, and Mrs. Wibblewobble was very glad indeed to get the piece of Nurse Jane's pie.  \"I'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17807"],["title","Uncle Wiggily in the Woods (#7)"],["body"," save a bit for Lulu and Alice, my two little duck girls,\" said Mrs. Wibblewobble.  \"Why, aren't they home?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"No, Lulu has gone over to a little afternoon party which Nannie Wagtail, the goat girl, is having, and Alice has gone to see Grandfather Goosey Gander.  Jiminie is off playing ball with Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dog boys, so I am home alone.\"  \"I hope you are not lonesome,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Oh, no, thank you,\" answered the duck lady.  \"I have too much to do. Thank Nurse Jane for her pie.\"  \"I shall,\" Uncle Wiggily promised, as he started off through the woods again.  He had not gone far before, all of a sudden, he did not stoop low enough as he was hopping under a tree and, the first thing he knew, his tall silk hat was knocked off his head and into a puddle of water.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, as he picked up his hat.  \"I shall never be able to wear it again until it is cleaned and ironed.  And how I can have that done out here in the woods is more than I know.\"  \"Ah, but I know,\" said a voice in a tree overhead.  \"Who are you, and what do you know?\" asked the bunny uncle, surprised like and hopeful.  \"I know where you can have your silk hat cleaned and ironed smooth,\" said the voice.  \"I am the tailor bird, and I do those things.  Let me have your hat, Uncle Wiggily, and I'll fix it for you.\"  Down flew the kind bird, and Uncle Wiggily gave him the hat.  \"But what shall I wear while I'm waiting?\" asked the bunny uncle.  \"It is too soon for me to be going about without my hat.  I'll need something on my head while you are fixing my silk stovepipe, dear Tailor Bird.\"  \"Oh, that is easy,\" said the bird.  \"Just pick some of those thick, green leafy ferns and make yourself a hat of them.\"  \"The very thing!\" cried Uncle Wiggily.  Then he fastened some woodland ferns together and easily made himself a hat that would keep off the sun, if it would not keep off the rain.  But then it wasn't raining.  \"There you are, Uncle Wiggily!\" called the tailor bird at last.  \"Your silk hat is ready to wear again.\"  \"Thank you,\" spoke the bunny uncle, as he laid aside the ferns, also thanking them.  \"Now I am like myself again,\" and he hopped on through the woods, wondering whether or not he was to have any more adventures that day.  Mr. Longears had not gone on very much farther before he heard a rustling in the bushes, and then a sad little voice said:  \"Oh, dear!  How sad!  I don't believe I'll go to the party now!  All the others would make fun of me!  Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!\"  \"Ha!  That sounds like trouble!\" said the bunny uncle.  \"I must see what it means.\"  He looked through the bushes and there, sitting on a log, he saw Lulu Wibblewobble, the little duck girl, who was crying very hard, the tears rolling down her yellow bill.  \"Why, Lulu!  What's the matter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"Oh, dear!\" answered the little quack-quack child.  \"I can't go to the party; that's what's the matter.\"  \"Why can't you go?\" Uncle Wiggily wanted to know.  \"I saw your mother a little while ago, and she said you were going.\"  \"I know I was going,\" spoke Lulu, \"but I'm not now, for the wind blew my nice new hat into the puddle of muddy water, and now look at it!\" and she held up a very much beraggled and debraggled hat of lace and straw and ribbons and flowers.  \"Oh, dear!  That hat is in a bad state, to be sure,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"But don't cry, Lulu.  Almost the same thing happened to me and the tailor bird made my hat as good as ever.  Mine was all mud, too, like yours.  Come, I'll take you to the tailor bird.\"  \"You are very kind, Uncle Wiggily,\" spoke Lulu, \"but if I go there I may not get back in time for the party, and I want to wear my new hat to it, very much.\"  \"Ha!  I see!\" cried the bunny uncle.  \"You want to look nice at the party.  Well, that's right, of course.  And I don't believe the tailor bird could clean your hat in time, for it is so fancy he would have to be very careful of it.  \"But you can do as I did, make a hat out of ferns, and wear that to Nannie Wagtail's party.  I'll help you.\"  \"Oh, how kind you are!\" cried the little duck girl.  So she went along with Uncle Wiggily to where the ferns grew in the wood, leaving her regular hat at the tailor bird's nest to be cleaned and pressed.  Uncle Wiggily made Lulu the cutest hat out of fern leaves.  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.  There wasn't one like it even in the five and ten-cent store.  \"Wear that to Nannie's party, Lulu,\" said the rabbit gentleman, and Lulu did, the hat being fastened to her feathers with a long pin made from the stem of a fern.  And when Lulu reached the party all the animal girls cried out:  \"Oh, what a sweet, lovely, cute, dear, cunning, swell and stylish hat! Where did you get it?\"  \"Uncle Wiggily made it,\" answered Lulu, and all the girls said they were going to get one just like it.  And they did, so that fern hats became very fashionable and stylish in Woodland, and Lulu had a fine time at the party.  So this teaches us that even a mud puddle is of some use, and if the rubber plant doesn't stretch too far, and tickle the gold fish under the chin making it sneeze, the next story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the snow drops.     STORY XII  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SNOW DROPS  \"Uncle Wiggily!  Uncle Wiggily!  Will you come with me?\" called a voice under the window of the hollow stump bungalow, where the old gentleman rabbit was sitting, half asleep, one nice, warm afternoon.  \"Ha!  Come with you?  Who is it wants me to come with them?\" asked the bunny gentleman.  \"I hope it isn't the bad fox, or the skillery-scalery alligator with humps on his tail that is calling.  They're always wanting me to go with them.\"  The rabbit looked out of the window and he heard some one laughing.  \"That doesn't sound like a bad fox, nor yet an unpleasant alligator,\" said Mr. Longears.  \"Who is it wants me to come with them?\"  \"It is I--Susie Littletail, the rabbit girl,\" was the answer.  \"And where do you want me to come?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"To the woods, to pick some flowers,\" answered Susie.  \"The lady mouse teacher wants me to see how many kinds I can find.  You know so much about the woods, Uncle Wiggily, that I wish you'd come with me.\"  \"I will,\" said the nice rabbit gentleman.  \"Wait until I get my tall silk hat and my red, white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch.\"  And, when he had them, off he started, holding Susie's paw in his, and limping along under the green trees and over the carpet of green moss.  Uncle Wiggily and the little rabbit girl found many kinds of flowers in the woods.   There were violets, some white, some yellow and some purple, with others blue, like the ones Uncle Wiggily used to make blueing water for Nurse Jane's clothes.  And there were red flowers and yellow ones, and some Jacks-in-their-pulpits, which are very queer flowers indeed.  \"Here, Susie, is a new kind of blossom.  Maybe you would like some of these,\" said Uncle Wiggily, pointing to a bush that was covered with little round, white balls.  \"Oh, I didn't know the snow had lasted this long!\" Susie cried.  \"I thought it had melted long ago.\"  \"I don't see any snow,\" said Uncle Wiggily, looking around.  \"On that bush,\" said Susie, pointing to the white one.  \"Oh!\" laughed the bunny uncle.  \"That does look like snow, to be sure. But it isn't, though the name of the flowers is snowdrop.\"  \"Flowers!  I don't call them flowers!\" said Susie.  \"They are only white balls.\"  \"Don't you want to pick any?\" asked the rabbit.  \"Thank you, no,\" Susie said.  \"I like prettier colored flowers than those, which are just plain white.\"  \"Well, I like them, and I'll take some to Nurse Jane,\" spoke the bunny uncle.  So he picked a bunch of the snowdrops and carried them in his paws, while Susie gathered the brighter flowers.  \"I think those will be all teacher will want,\" said the little rabbit girl at last.  \"Yes, we had better be getting home,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily.  \"Nurse Jane will soon have supper ready.  Won't you come and eat with me, Susie?\"  \"Thank you, I will, Uncle Wiggily,\" and the little bunny girl clapped her paws; that is, as well as she could, on account of holding her flowers, for she loved to eat at Uncle Wiggily's hollow stump bungalow, as did all the animal children.  Well, Uncle Wiggily and Susie were going along and along through the woods, when, all of a sudden, as they passed a high rock, out from behind it jumped the bad old tail-pulling monkey.  [Illustration: As they passed a high rock, out from behind it jumped the bad old tail-pulling monkey.]  \"Ah, ha!\" chattered the monkey chap.  \"I am just in time, I see.\"  \"Time for what?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, suspicious like.  \"To pull your tails,\" answered the monkey.  \"I haven't had any tails to pull in a long while, and I must pull some.  So, though you rabbits haven't very good tails, for pulling, I must do the best I can.  Now come to me and have your tails pulled.  Come on!\"  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Susie.  \"I don't want my tail pulled, even if it is very short.\"  \"Nor I mine,\" Uncle Wiggily said.  \"That makes no manner of difference to me,\" chattered the monkey.  \"I'm a tail-pulling chap, and tails I must pull.  So you might as well have it over with, now as later.\"  And he spoke just like a dentist who wants to take your lolly-pop away from you.  \"Pull our tails!  Well, I guess you won't!\" cried Uncle Wiggily suddenly.  \"Come on, Susie!  Let's run away!\"  Before the monkey could grab them Uncle Wiggily and Susie started to run.  But soon the monkey was running after them, crying:  \"Stop!  Stop!  I must pull your tails!\"  \"But we don't want you to,\" answered Susie.  \"Oh, but you must let me!\" cried the monkey.  Then he gave a great big, long, strong and double-jointed jump, like a circus clown going over the backs of fourteen elephants, and part of another one, and the monkey grabbed Uncle Wiggily by his ears.  \"Oh, let go of me, if you please!\" begged the"]]]
