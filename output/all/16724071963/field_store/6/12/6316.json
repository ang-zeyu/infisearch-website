Pee-wee climbed up and sat on the limb beside his new friend.  He was a boy somewhat older than Pee-wee with a face so round that the face of the man in the moon would have seemed narrow by comparison.  And there was a redness in his cheeks which made his head seem almost like an apple grown prematurely ripe upon that blossom laden tree.  He wore the negligee scout attire and his happy-go-lucky nature was made the more piquant by the easy, humorous fashion in which he sat upon the limb, swinging his legs.  Pee-wee could not have found it in his heart to quarrel with any boy whose face looked so much like an apple, and, moreover, it was apparent that here was a boy whom it would be utterly impossible to quarrel with on any ground whatever--or in any tree whatever.  \"Gee whiz, this is a funny thing,\" Pee-wee said; \"I was kind of making believe that I was an explorer, but anyway I'm glad you're here.\"  \"I'm here because I'm here,\" said the other boy.  \"Gee, I can't deny that,\" said Pee-wee.  \"It doesn't make any difference to me,\" said the boy; \"I'd just as soon be in one place as another.\"  \"As long as it's not school,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Oh, that's understood,\" said the other boy; \"let's talk of something pleasant.\"  \"I bet there'll be a lot of apples here later,\" said Pee-wee; \"when it's vacation, hey?\"  \"I don't know whether they'll be here,\" said the other boy, \"because you can't trust this blamed island over night, but they'll be on the tree, wherever it is, and the way to find them will be to look for the tree.\"  \"_You said it_,\" said Pee-wee.  \"What's your name?\"  \"Roland Poland,\" said the boy; \"Roly Poly for short.\"  \"Mine's Walter Harris, but they call me Pee-wee.  How did this island get here anyway?\"  \"It started being an island under my very feet,\" said Roly Poly. \"There are five scouts in my patrol besides myself; we're just getting started----\"  \"I'm the only one in my patrol,\" Pee-wee interrupted.  \"Where do you come from?\"  \"From North Bridgeboro,\" said Roly Poly, swinging his legs.  \"The six of us went to camp for the day just above old Trimmer's land up the river.\"  \"I know him,\" Pee-wee said; \"he's a grouch.\"  \"Very muchly,\" said Roly; \"he's worse than algebra.\"  \"He's worse than algebra and civil government put together,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Did you say _civil_?\" said Roly Poly; \"don't mention civil in the same sentence with him; he's the man that put the crab in crab-apple.\"  \"He's got a dandy orchard, though,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Sure, this is a part of it,\" said Roly Poly.     CHAPTER IX  THE LOOKOUT SEES A SAIL  \"_Good night_,\" said Pee-wee; \"I don't blame it for going away from him.  Can he take it back?  It's an island now and it's part of Bridgeboro.  He can't take it on account of international law; that's what _I_ think.  How did it happen?\"  \"It's a very short story,\" said his new friend; \"it's only about a mile and a half long--from North Bridgeboro down to here.  We were camping in Wallace's grove and a little way down the river we saw a kind of a little spot of land with a tree on it.  There were lots of apple trees all around there near the shore.  We didn't know that orchard belonged to old Trimmer.\"  \"He thinks he owns the whole river,\" said Pee-wee.  \"That little spot of land stuck out sort of like a balcony on account of it being near the bend of the river; the river coming around the bend sort of scooped a place out underneath it; it was all under-mined----\"  \"I know what happened!  I know what happened!\" Pee-wee shouted.  \"I know the place, it was nice and shady underneath it and you could go under it in a canoe; lots of times I did.\"  \"Well, you never will any more,\" said Roly Poly.  \"Go on, tell me!  Go on, tell me!\" Pee-wee encouraged excitedly.  \"There was a pole sticking out of the water right near there,\" Pee-wee's new friend continued, \"and we thought it meant there was good fishing there.  So I said I'd go and see if I could catch a couple of eels and sunfish or something.  While I was out at the edge of that little knob of land or whatever you want to call it, all of a sudden I could feel something giving way under me and the first thing I knew the whole business was in the water.  \"Oh, you should have heard those fellows laugh as I went sailing down the river.  That was about ten o'clock this morning and the tide was running down strong.  This little old island flopped around and went every which way but it stayed right side up anyway and do you think I'd desert the ship?  By the time we flopped downstream this far the tide was so low that our little old roots dragged the bottom and we stopped for keeps.  So here we are till the tide comes in anyway.  I don't know whether we'll float in deep water or not, or whether we'll capsize in deep water or not and I don't know anything about international law, but a life on the ocean wave for _me_.\"  \"I know all about international law,\" Pee-wee shouted.  \"Real estate is in a certain place, isn't it?  If a man owns real estate it's bounded by something, isn't it?  Well, then, if it isn't bounded by those things any more how can it belong to that same man?  If a man owns land in a certain place and it stops being in that place, whose is it?\"  \"Search me,\" said Roly Poly.  \"Besides I've got an inspiration; do you know what those are?\" Pee-wee vociferated.  \"Have you got it with you?\"  \"_Sure_ I've got it with me!  Don't I always have them with me?\"  Roly Poly seemed amused.  \"There are two kinds of scouts, aren't there?\" Pee-wee asked vociferously.  \"Regular scouts and sea scouts.  Sea scouts are supposed to live on the water and regular scouts are supposed to live under the trees, like.  So we can do both and we'll be combination scouts.  We'll be the Combination Scouts of America, hey?  Will you?\"  \"I'll be anything as long as it's Saturday; I'm not particular,\" said Roly Poly.  \"Because my father knows a man that's a lawyer and he'll stick up for us,\" Pee-wee continued excitedly.  \"Because old Trimmer hasn't got any deed that says he owns an island, has he?  All right, this is an island in Bridgeboro.  You can't deny that, can you?  Let's hear you deny that.  All right, then, if he comes and tries to get this island, he'll be trespassing, won't he?  And so we'll start the Combination Scouts of America and we'll call ourselves the--the--the----\"  \"The Sardine Patrol,\" suggested Roly.  \"We'll call ourselves the Crab-apple Patrol,\" said Pee-wee, \"because apples are on land and crabs are in the water.  Will you?\"  \"I see a sail on the horizon,\" said Roly.  \"If it's old Trimmer let me handle him,\" said Pee-wee.  \"It's the rest of the patrol,\" said Roly.  \"Do you see those two canoes coming around the bend?  We'll have a meeting of the general staff and decide what to do.\"  \"Whatever we do, we'll do something, hey?\" said Pee-wee.  \"More than that,\" said Roly.  \"Anyway, we'll start a patrol or something, hey?\"  \"Oh, we'll start something, leave it to us,\" said Roly Poly.     CHAPTER X  THE OTHERS ARRIVE  The arrival of the five North Bridgeboro scouts was the occasion of much merriment and banter.  These boys from the small village up the river had formed themselves into a patrol but they were two members short of the required number and they had no scoutmaster.  Whether they took scouting seriously it would be hard to say; if so it must have been a great comfort to them to have wished upon their budding organization such an instructor and propagandist as the diminutive genius whom they were now about to meet.  Whatever material they had among them for progress in the scouting field, they gave every indication of possessing that quality of unholy mirth which distinguished the notorious Silver Foxes.  Perhaps their silver was not quite so bright, but they gave promise.  \"Hey, where are you going with the apple tree?\" one of them called from the nearest canoe.  \"What are you trying to do?  Swipe a chunk of property?  That's a part of North Bridgeboro you've got there.\"  \"Why didn't you take the whole village?\" another called.  \"Hey, Roly, where are you going with the real estate?\" another called.  \"I knew you were too heavy for that neck of land,\" shouted another.  \"Why didn't you take the whole orchard with you?\" a third wanted to know.  \"_For the love of----_,\" another ejaculated.  \"Look at the sign, will you!  The place is discovered already!\"  Pee-wee did not wait for formal introductions.  \"We're going to start the Combination Scouts of Bridgeboro!\" he shouted.  \"We're going to be sea scouts and land scouts all rolled into one!  We took possession and it's all right!  Old Trimmer can't say that he owned an island, can he? We're going to have our pictures in _Boys' Life_ and everything and we're going to have all the apples when they're ripe and maybe we're going to call ourselves the Crab-apple Patrol!  Maybe there's treasure buried here, how do we know?  And we're going to get one of those things--a saxophone or whatever you call it--to take our latitude and longitude with!  We're going to be better than the Ravens and the Elks and the Silver Foxes and I know how to make apple-sauce!  We're going to be a new kind of a patrol!\"  \"In the name of goodness, what's that, a phonograph?\" one of the approaching canoeists called.  \"That's the discoverer,\" Roly called back.  \"He took possession of the island in the name of the King of Bridgeboro.\"  \"I thought it was an earthquake,\" laughed a tall boy who was stepping ashore.  \"Oh, we have those too,\" laughed Roly; \"all the latest improvements. That's Pee-wee; he's perfectly harmless, step right ashore, you're all welcome.\"  \"You're stepping into the seventeenth century,\" Pee-wee shouted, descending precipitately out of the tree.  \"The seventeenth century must have been very wet,\" said the tall boy as he lifted one foot out of the water only to plunge the other into the ragged, muddy edge of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17767"],["title","Pee-wee Harris Adrift (#6)"],["body","sland, in his efforts to get on shore.  It was very funny to see him wallow in the water, seeking foothold on the submerged tentacles of root, ever slipping, and always with the soberest look on his face.  \"This must be the back entrance,\" he said. \"Where are we supposed to park?\"  This tall boy, who turned out to be a sort of patrol leader and scoutmaster in one, had a kind of whimsical look of inquiry on his face which was his permanent expression, and which was made the more humorous by red hair which he wore decidedly pompadour.  There was that in his look which indicated his taking everything as he found it, his attitude being always quietly humorous and never surprised.  His demeanor, in whatever adventure befell, seemed always that of an amiable victim placing himself at the mercy of his enterprising comrades and going through every kind of outlandish escapade and adventure with a ludicrously sober look on his funny face.  To him everything that happened seemed part of the game of life and he appeared never in the least astonished at anything.  To see him soberly going through with some adventure which the sprightly genius of his associates had conceived was as good as a circus.  Naturally such a fellow was called \"old\" and they called him Old Rip and Good Old Rip and Doctor Rip and Professor Rip.  His name was Townsend Ripley.  Townsend began at the very beginning to take the irrepressible ex-Raven very soberly indeed, and the more preposterous Pee-wee's schemes the more in favor of them Townsend seemed to be.  No doubt he got a great deal of amusement out of Pee-wee.  But Pee-wee never knew it.     CHAPTER XI  PLANS  It was quite characteristic of Townsend Ripley that he did not ask Roly Poly anything about his extraordinary adventure.  Amid the chorus of exclamations and inquiries he preserved a quiet, whimsical demeanor, glancing about as if rather interested in this desert island.  There it was, and that was enough for him.  \"If this island is going to keep moving you'll have to put a license plate on it, Roly,\" he drawled.  \"First thing you know you'll have the inland waterway inspectors after you.  You're blocking up the channel too.  Why didn't you drift down as far as Southbridge where the taxes aren't so high?\"  \"I was--I was thinking about it,\" Pee-wee suddenly burst forth like a cyclone, \"and there are a lot of things we can do--I've got a lot of ideas--there are seven things and we can do any one of them!\"  \"Why not do them all?\" Ripley asked.  \"That's just what _I_ say,\" Pee-wee shouted.  \"Or we can each do a different thing,\" Ripley suggested.  \"There are just seven of us.  Anything suits me.\"  \"Do you want to know how I discovered it?\" Pee-wee said excitedly.  \"No, as long as we know it's discovered, that's enough,\" said Ripley.  \"I discovered it, then he discovered me,\" said Pee-wee, \"but I'm the discoverer because it wasn't an island when he got on it, see.  Anyway, that man can't take it, can he?  So will you start a patent combination patrol?  And I vote for you to be the leader!\"  \"Let's see if we can't start the island,\" suggested Ripley.  \"We don't want to start a Bridgeboro patrol and then find that we're in Southbridge!\" said one of the boys whom the others called Nuts.  \"Oh, I don't see why not,\" drawled Townsend; \"trouble is,\" he added, glancing casually about, \"we can't go on any hikes.  If we start skirting the coast we'll get dizzy.\"  \"I know what we can do,\" said Pee-wee, \"because, gee whiz, we've got to have exercise, that's one sure thing.  If we can make the island go round why then we can keep walking like a--like a--you know--like a horse on a treadmill--hey?  And we won't get dizzy at all, because it'll be the island that goes round, see?\"  \"That's a very good suggestion,\" said Townsend, \"but suppose on one of our long hikes we want to stop and camp.  As soon as we stop hiking we'll start going round backward with the island.\"  \"We should worry,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Oh, we're not going to worry,\" said Townsend.  \"You said it,\" vociferated Pee-wee.  \"Do you know why I like you? Because you're--you know--you're kind of--sort of----\"  \"Absolutely,\" said Townsend.  \"You read me like a book.\"  \"This is better than books,\" said Pee-wee, \"because this is a kind of a desert island and a ship, isn't it?  So will you all stay here till I get back, because I'm going to get my tent and some eats and a lot of stuff for camping and then we'll start our patrol.\"  \"I can't say that we'll stay here,\" said Townsend, \"but we'll stick to the island.  I have a hunch that this island is going to put one over on us.  If we're not here when you get back you'd better advertise in the 'Lost and Found' column of the Bridgeboro paper, 'Lost, one desert island.  Finder will be suitably rewarded upon returning same to the patent adjustable scouts----'\"  \"Not adjustable--_combination_,\" Pee-wee corrected.  \"Do you like roasted potatoes?  I know how to roast them.  And I'll get some bacon, too; shall I?\"  \"Suppose you should be captured by your parents while you're on the mainland,\" Townsend inquired.  \"Then I'll send you a smoke signal,\" Pee-wee said, \"and you can come and talk to my mother, because she'll be sure to listen to you because, anyway, you've got a lot of sense.\"  \"And several of us will canoe up to North Bridgeboro and get some stuff and tell our folks and we'll be back in an hour because the tide's starting to run up,\" said a boy they called Billy.  \"If you have any trouble with the folks just give me a smoke signal and I'll canoe up,\" drawled Townsend.  \"Good old Rip,\" chorused half a dozen voices.  The boy they called Billy turned to Pee-wee and whispered, \"Don't worry about your folks.  Old Rip makes a specialty of parents; they all eat out of his hands, fathers especially.  As soon as they see him they surrender.\"  \"I make a specialty of cooks,\" Pee-wee said.  \"Our cook gives me everything I want.  And anyway we couldn't starve because scouts can't starve; they can eat roots and herbs and things; I'll show you.  Do you like chocolate marshmallows?  Even scouts can eat moss to keep from starving.  And they can't get lost either--I'll show you how.\"  Pee-wee decided to take one of the boys with him to prove to his mother that the island was inhabited, and two other boys started back up the river in the other canoe.  This left Townsend with two companions on the island.  He sat against the trunk of the tree, knees drawn up, philosophically scanning the shore and occasionally giving an expectant glance up the river for smoke signals.  He seemed resigned to a quiet expectancy that he would be summoned to intercede in one quarter or another.  He looked very whimsical and funny.  \"I wonder if you have to crank this island or whether it has a self-starter,\" he drawled in his amusing way.  \"If they don't get back by one or so, we'll have to make some root sandwiches.  What do you say, Charlie?\"     CHAPTER XII  THE DISCOVERER RETURNS  In about an hour and a half the two boys from up the river returned with provisions.  \"Any news from the discoverer?\" they asked.  \"I think he's being held as a hostage by the cook,\" said Townsend. \"Shall we land and lay waste to his home?\"  \"Oh, I think we can safely leave everything to him,\" said Billy.  \"What do you think of the discoverer, anyway?\"  \"I'm for the discoverer first, last and always,\" said Townsend.  \"He has only to lead and I'll follow.  Now that we've met him I feel that life without the discoverer would not be worth living.  I'm glad that next week is Easter vacation, because we couldn't think of school and the discoverer at the same time.  He's more than a scout, he's an institution.  \"Do you know, Charlie, I think we're moving?  We were almost opposite that old railroad car a few minutes ago.  Either Bridgeboro is going down or we're going up.  Do you feel the climate changing?  You don't suppose this island is going to go up the river again and join old Trimmer's orchard, do you?\"  \"Maybe it's homesick,\" said a boy they called Brownie.  \"I hope the discoverer will discover it,\" said Billy.  \"We'd better scatter something in our trail,\" said Townsend soberly, \"so that he can follow.  I think that's the regulation thing for scouts to do, isn't it?\"  He had been whittling a stick and now with a sober look he began throwing the chips into the water as if to indicate the path of the departing island.  \"That's what you call blazing a trail,\" he said; \"if he's a scout he can follow.\"  The little island was now moving slowly upstream by the incoming tide. It caught on the flats, performed a slow pirouette like some drowsy toe-dancer or exhausted merry-go-round, then extricated itself and floated majestically in the channel till the little apple tree became involved with the foliage along shore.  \"Do you know this seems like a very funny kind of an island to me?\" Townsend Ripley drawled.  \"I wonder what makes it hold together?  It ought to disintegrate.\"  \"Dis what?\" asked Billy.  \"Disintegrate--that's Latin for falling to pieces.\"  \"Maybe the roots hold it together,\" said Roland.  \"It ought to dissolve,\" said Townsend.  \"This land doesn't seem to be soluble in water.  The coast all around ought to wash away.  There is something mysterious here.  This island is as solid as a pancake; I don't understand it.  By all the rules of the game there shouldn't be anything left here but the tree by this evening.  There doesn't seem to be any process of erosion.\"  \"What will we do if the island washes away from under us?\" asked the boy they called Brownie.  \"The tree'll fall over sideways, won't it?  I don't want to camp on an island that keeps getting smaller all the time.  It's bad enough to have a tent shrink after a rain, but _an island_!\"  \"I think this island is warranted not to shrink,\" said Townsend.  \"Warranted nothing,\" said Billy; \"look how muddy the water is all around it.  It'll be about as big as a fifty cent piece by midnight. The river is"]]]
