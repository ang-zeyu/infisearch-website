Schiller's Interest in Śakuntalā--Turandot.   While the Orient, as we have seen, cast its spell over Germany's greatest poet and inspired the lyric genius of his later years for one of its most remarkable efforts, it remained practically without any influence on his illustrious friend and brother-poet Schiller. If Schiller had lived longer, it is not impossible that he too might have contributed to the West-Eastern literature. As it is, however, he died before the Oriental movement in Germany had really begun. At no time did he feel any particular interest in the East. Once, indeed, he mentions _Śakuntalā_. Goethe had drawn his attention to a German version of the _Gītagōvinda_ and this reminded Schiller of the famous Hindu drama which he read with the idea of possibly utilizing it for the theatre.[116] This idea he abandons owing to the delicacy of the piece and its lack of movement.  An attempt has been made to prove that to Kālidāsa's drama Schiller was indebted for the motive of his \"Alpenjäger,\" but it cannot be said to have been successful.[117]         *       *       *       *       *  Though there was no direct Oriental influence on Schiller's poetry, there is one dramatic poem of his which indirectly goes back to a Persian source. It is _Turandot_. The direct source for this composition was Gozzi's play of the same name in the translation of August Clemens Werthes, which Schiller, however, used with such freedom that his own play may be regarded as an original production rather than a version. The Italian poet based his _fiaba_ on the story of Prince Kalaf in the Persian tales of Pétis de La Croix.[118] Now, as has been pointed out by scholars,[119] the name of the heroine, who gives the name to the play, is genuinely Persian, _Tūrān-duχt_, \"the daughter of Tūrān,\"[120] and although the scene is laid in China, most of the proper names, both in Gozzi and Schiller, are not at all Chinese, but Persian or Arabic. The oldest known model for the story is the fourth romance of Nidāmī's _Haft Paīkar_, the story of Bahrāmgūr and the Russian princess, written 1197.[121] Whether Schiller was aware of the ultimate origin of the legend or not, he certainly made no attempt to give Persian local color to his piece, but on the contrary he studiously tried to impart to it a Chinese atmosphere.[122] It is interesting nevertheless to notice that when _Turandot_ was given at Hamburg (July 9 to Sept. 9, 1802) its real provenence was recognized, and, accordingly Turandot was no longer the princess of China, but that of Shīrāz, her father being transformed into the Shāh of Persia and the doctors of the _dīvān_ into Oriental Magi.[123] At Dresden the same thing happened, and here even Tartaglia and Brigella, who had been allowed to retain their Italian names in Hamburg, were made to assume the Oriental names of Babouk and Osmin. The specifically Chinese riddles disappeared, and instead of Tien and Fohi, Hormuz was now invoked.[124]   FOOTNOTES:  [116] A Letter dated from Weimar, Feb. 20, 1802.

Friedrich Schlegel's Weisheit der Indier--Foundation of       Sanskrit Study in Germany.   We have now come to the period of the foundation of Sanskrit philology in Germany. English statesmanship had completed the material conquest of India; German scholarship now began to join in the spiritual conquest of that country. With this undertaking the names of Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel are prominently identified. The chief work of these brothers lies in the field of philosophy, translation and criticism, and is therefore beyond the scope of this investigation. Suffice it to say that Friedrich's famous little book _Die Weisheit der Indier_, published in 1808, besides marking the beginning of Sanskrit studies and comparative grammar in Germany,[125] is also of interest to us because here for the first time a German version of selections from the _Mahābhārata_, _Rāmāyaṇa_ and the _Code of Manu_, as well as a description of some of the most common Sanskrit metres is presented,[126] and an attempt is even made to reproduce these metres in the translation. The work of August Wilhelm Schlegel as critic, translator and editor of important works from Sanskrit literature is too familiar to need more than mention.[127] It is well known that to his lectures Heine owed his fondness for the lotus-flowers and gazelles on the banks of the Ganges.  On the poetry of the Schlegels their Oriental studies exercised very little influence. Friedrich translated some maxims from the _Hitōpadēśa_ and from Bhartṛhari;[128] August likewise translated from the same works, as well as from the Epics and Purāṇas.[129] There are only two original poems of his that have anything to do with India, and both of these were written before he had begun the study of Sanskrit. The first is \"Die Bestattung des Braminen,\"[130] a somewhat morbid description of the burning of a corpse. It was addressed to his brother Karl August, who had joined a Hanoverian regiment in the service of the East India Company. The second of these poems is \"Neoptolemus an Diokles\" (ii. 13), written in 1800, and dedicated to the memory of this same brother who had died at Madras in 1789.[131] As a matter of fact, there is really nothing Oriental in the spirit of the poem.  Aside from translations, the only poems that are connected with Schlegel's Sanskrit studies, are the epigrams against his illustrious contemporaries, Bopp and Rückert. Those against the former (ii. 234) are of no special interest here. With those against Rückert, however, the case is different. It is worth while noting that towards the distinguished scholar-poet Schlegel assumed a patronizing attitude. To Rückert's masterly renderings from Sanskrit literature he referred slightingly as \"Sanskritpoesiemetriknachahmungen\" (ii. 235). But when he hailed the younger poet as      Aller morgenländ'schen Zäune König,     Wechselsweise zeisigkranichtönig! (ii. 218),  he came much nearer to the truth than he imagined at the time. For, while it will be conceded that Rückert did not always sing with equal power, it also is indisputable that he is the leading spirit in the movement under investigation. But we shall not anticipate a discussion of this poet's work, which is reserved for a succeeding chapter.   FOOTNOTES:  [125] See Benfey, Gesch. der Sprachwissenschaft und orient.

His Oriental Studies--Ghaselen--Their Persian       Character--Imitation of Persian Form--Translations.   The first to introduce the _γazal_ in its strict form into German literature[132] was Rückert, who in 1821 published a version of a number of _γazals_ from the _dīvān_ of Rūmī.[133] Chronologically, therefore, he ought to have the precedence in this investigation. If we, nevertheless, take up Platen first, we do so because the _γazals_ of this poet were really the first professedly original poems of this form to appear in Germany (Rückert's claiming to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],["title","The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#8)"],["body","only), and also because they constitute almost the only portion of his poetic work that comes within the sphere of this discussion. Moreover, the remarks which we shall make concerning their content, imagery, and poetic structure, apply largely to the _γazals_ of Rückert and also to his _Östliche Rosen_, if we except the structure of the latter.  Platen became interested in the East through the work of Hammer, and still more through the influence of Goethe's _Divan_. He at once set to work studying Persian, and his zeal was increased when, on meeting Rückert in 1820 at Ebern, and again at Nürnberg, he received encouragement and instruction from that scholarly poet. Above all, the appearance of the latter's versions from Rūmī gave him a powerful stimulus, and in 1821 the first series of his _Ghaselen_ appeared at Erlangen. Others followed in rapid succession. The same year a second series appeared at Leipzig;[134] a third series, united under the title _Spiegel des Hafis_, appeared at Erlangen the next year;[135] and, lastly, a series called _Neue Ghaselen_ appeared in the same place in 1823. A few _γazals_ arose later, some being published as late as 1836 and 1839.[136]  We shall confine our discussion to those _γazals_ that date from the years 1821 and 1822, the last series being Persian in nothing but form.  The _Ghaselen_ are not at all translations. Like the _Divan_-poems they are original creations, inspired by the reading of H̱āfiḍ, and, to use the poet's own words \"dem Hafis nachgefühlt und nachgedichtet.\"[137] They follow as closely as possible the Persian metrical rules, and make use throughout of Persian images and metaphors, so much so that we can adduce direct parallels from the poems of H̱āfiḍ. Thus in 13[138] we read: \"Schenke! Tulpen sind wie Kelche Weines,\" evidently a parallel to some such line as H̱. 541. 1:       ساقی   بيا که شد قدح لاله ‍‍ پر ز می  \"_sāqī_, come! for the tulip-like goblet is filled with wine.\" In 75 the words \"Weil ihren goldnen Busen doch vor euch verschliesst die Rose\" are an echo of H̱. 300. 2:       چوغنچه سرٌ درونش کجا نهان ماند  \"like the rose-bud, how can its inward secret remain concealed?\" (cf. also H̱. 23. 3). And again in 85 \"Und nun ... entrinnet dem Herzen das Blut leicht, das sonst mir den Odem benahm\" is to be compared with H̱. 11. 9:       دل دردمند حافظ که زهجرتست پر خون  \"the sorrowful heart of H̱āfiḍ, which through separation from thee is full of blood.\" Furthermore in 81 we read:      Du fingst im lieblichen Trugnetz der Haare die ganze Welt,--     Als spiegelhaltende Sklavin gewahre die ganze Welt!  For the first line compare H̱. 102. 1:       کس  نيست که افتادهً آن زلف دوتا نيست  \"there is no one who has not been snared by that doubled tress,\" and for the second line compare H̱. 470. 1:       ی آفتاب آينه دار جمال تو  \"O, thou of whose beauty the sun is the mirror-holder!\" In 86 the idea of the young men slain like game by the beauty of the beloved is evidently inspired by H̱. 358. 6:       ناوک چشم تو در هر گوشهً      همچو من افتاده دارد صد قتيل  \"in every nook thine eye has a hundred slain ones fallen like me,\" and the following lines in the same poem 86:      O welche Pfeile strahlt zu mir dein Antlitz,     Und es befreit kein Schild von deiner Schönheit,  remind us of H̱. 561. 7:       چشم تو خدنگ از سپر جان گذراند       \"thine eye causes the arrow (lit. poplar) to pass through the      shield of life.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Again and again we meet with allusions to the famous image of the love of the nightingale for the rose (35, 75, etc.) so common in Persian poetry, especially in H̱āfiḍ. We cite only 318. 1:       فکر بلبل همه آنست که گل شد يارش      گل در انديشه که چون عشوه کند در کارش  \"the whole thought of the nightingale is that the rose may be his beloved; the rose has in her thought how she may show grace in her actions.\" In 302. 1 the nightingale is called عروس گل \"the rose's bride.\"  Besides this, the poems teem with characteristic Persian metaphors: the moth longing for the flame (37, H̱. 187. 7); the tulip-bed glowing like fire (67, H̱. 288. 1); the tulip-cheek لاله عذار (whence Moore's _Lalla Rookh_), لاله رُخ (70, H̱. 155. 2); the musk-perfumed hair لاله مشکين (73, H̱. 33. 4); the garden of the face (73, H̱. 33. 4); the pearl of Aden درٌ عدن (77, H̱. 197. 10 and 651); wine as a ruby in a golden cup (82, H̱. 204. 8 ايا پر لعل کرده جام زرٌين \"O thou, the golden cup is made full of ruby\"); the eye-brows like the crescent-moon (82, H̱. 470. 5 ابروی همچون هلال \"brow like the new moon\"); the dust on his love's threshold (83, H̱. 497. 10 خاک در يار); the sky playing ball with the moon (14, inspired by some such couplet as H̱. 409. 7); and the verses like pearls (43). For this compare H̱. 499. 11:       چو سلک درٌ خوشاست نظم پاک توحافظ  \"like a string of lustrous pearls is thy clear verse, O H̱āfiḍ.\" We might multiply such parallels, but those given bear out our statement in regard to the imitation of Persian rhetorical figures on the part of Platen.  In the eagerness to be genuinely Persian, the poet was not content, however, with imitating only what was striking or beautiful; he introduces even some features which, though very prominent in Eastern poetry, will never become congenial to the West. Thus the utter abjectness of the Oriental lover, who puts his face in the path of his beloved and invites her (or him) to scatter dust on his head (H̱. 148. 3), is presented to us with all possible extravagance in these lines of 87:      Sieh mich hier im Staub und setze deine Ferse mir auf's Haupt,     Mich, den letzten von den letzten deiner letzten Sklaven, sieh![139]  To the _sāqī_ is assigned a part almost as prominent as that which is his in the Persian original. It was the introduction of this repulsive trait (e.g. 82) that gave to Heine the opportunity for the savage, scathing onslaught on Platen in the well known passage of the _Reisebilder_.[140]         *       *       *       *       *  Otherwise Platen, like Goethe, ignores the mystic side of H̱āfiḍ, and infuses into his _Ghaselen_ a thoroughly bacchanalian spirit, taking frequent occasion to declaim against hypocrisy, fanaticism and the precepts of the _Qurān_. The _credo_ of these poems is the opening _γazal_ in _Spiegel des Hafis_ (64), where the line \"Wir schwören ew'gen Leichtsinn und ew'ge Trunkenheit\" may be taken to reflect the sentiment of the revelling Persian poet, who begs the _̱sūfī_ not to forbid wine, since from eternity it has been mingled with men's dust (H̱. 61. 4); who claims to have been predestined to the tavern (H̱. 20. 4); who asks indulgence if he turns aside from the mosque to the wine-house (H̱. 213. 4); who drinks his wine to the sound of the harp, feeling sure that God will forgive him (H̱. 292. 5); who is above the reproach of the boasters of austerity (H̱. 106. 3); and who, finally, asks that the cup be placed in his coffin so that he may drink from it on the day of resurrection (H̱. 308. 8). But when Platen flings away the _Qurān_ he certainly is not in accord with his Persian model, for, while H̱āfiḍ takes issue with the expounders of the sacred book, he discreetly refrains from assailing the book itself.  But perhaps the chief significance of these _Ghaselen_, as well as those of Rückert, lies in the fact that they introduced a new poetic form into German literature. It is astonishing to see how completely Platen has mastered this difficult form. The _radīf_ or refrain, so familiar to readers of H̱āfiḍ, he reproduces with complete success, as may be seen, for instance, in 8, where the words \"du liebst mich nicht\" are repeated at the end of each couplet, preceded successively by _zerrissen_, _wissen_, _beflissen_, _gewissen_, _vermissen_, _Narzissen_, exactly in the style of such an ode as H̱. 100. In those odes called _Spiegel des Hafis_ the name _Hafis_ is even regularly introduced into the last couplet, in accordance with the invariable rule of the Persian _γazal_ that the author's name must appear in the final couplet.  Besides the _γazal_ Platen has also attempted the _rubāʻī_ or quatrain, in which form he wrote twelve poems (_Werke_, ii. pp. 62-64), and the _qa̱sīdah_. Of this there is only one specimen, a panegyric (for such in most cases is the Persian _qa̱sīdah_) on Napoleon, and, as may therefore be imagined, of purely Occidental content.[141]         *       *       *       *       *  Of Platen's translations from H̱āfiḍ we need not speak here. But we must call attention to the attempt which he made to translate from Niḍāmī's _Iskandar Nāmah_ in the original _mutaqārib_-metre. The first eight couplets of the invocation are thus rendered, and in spite of the great difficulty attending the use of this metre in a European language, the rendering must be pronounced fairly successful. It is also faithful, as a comparison with the original shows. We cite the first two couplets from the Persian:       خدايا جهان پادشاهی تراست      زماخدمت آيدخدايی تراست       \"O God, world-sovereignty is Thine! From us comes service, Godhead      is Thine. The Protection of high and low Thou art! Everything is      nonexistent; whatever is, Thou art.\"[142]  Of other Oriental poems, not translations, we notice \"Parsenlied,\" dating from the year 1819, when Goethe's _Divan_ appeared, and it is quite possible that the _Parsi Nameh_ of that work suggested to Platen the composition of his poem.[143] His best known ballad, \"Harmosan,\" written in 1830, has a Persian warrior for its hero. The source for the poem is probably Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (chap. li.)[144]   FOOTNOTES:  [132] We might say into European literature. The only previous attempts, as far as we know, to reproduce this form were made by Jones, who translated a ghazal of Jāmī (Works, vol. ii. p. 501) into English, and by a certain Tommaso Chabert, who translated several ghazals of Jāmī into Italian (Fundgruben, vol. i. pp. 16-19).
