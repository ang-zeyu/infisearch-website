The army was unpopular in France.  This was due, partly to the disclosures of the Dreyfus case; partly to a wave of internationalism and pacifism; partly to jealousy of the army among civil officials.  An unwarranted sense of security was also to blame.  France had worked so hard to recoup her fortunes after the disaster of 1870 that her people--delighted with their ability as money makers, blinded by the glitter of great prosperity--grudged the expanse of keeping up a large army, grudged the time that compulsory military training took out of a young man's life.  And this preoccupation with success and the arts and pleasures of prosperous peace made them incline their ears to the apostles of \"Brotherhood\" and \"Federation\" and \"Arbitration instead of Armament.\"  Little by little legislation went against the army.  The period of compulsory service was reduced from three years to two; that cut down the size of the army by one-third.  The supreme command of the army was vested not in a general, but in a politician--the Minister of War.  The generals in the highest commands not only had to yield precedence to the prefects of the provinces (like our governors of states), but were subject to removal if the prefects did not like their politics and the Minister of War wished the support of the prefects.  Even the superior war council of the nation might be politically made up, to pay the War Minister's scores rather than to protect the country.  All this can happen to a people lulled by a false sense of security--even to a people which has had to defend itself against the savage rapacity of its neighbors across the Rhine for two thousand years!  It was against these currents of popular opinion and of government opposition that Ferdinand Foch took up his work in the Superior School of War--that work which was to make possible the first victory of the Marne, to save England from invasion by holding Calais, and to do various other things vital to civilization, including the prodigious achievements of the days that have since followed.  Foch foresaw that these things would have to be done and, with absolute consecration to his task, he set himself not only to train officers for France when she should need them, but to inspire them with a unity of action which has saved the world.  I have various word-pictures of him as he then appeared to, and impressed, his students.  One is by a military writer who uses the pseudonym of \"Miles.\"  \"The officers who succeeded one another at the school of war between 1896 and 1901,\" he says, referring to the first term of Foch as instructor there, \"will never forget the impressions made upon them by their professor of strategy and of general tactics.  It was this course that was looked forward to with the keenest curiosity as the foundational instruction given by the school.  It enjoyed the prestige given it by the eminent authorities who had held it; and the eighty officers who came to the school at each promotion, intensely desirous of developing their skill and judgment, were always impatient to see and hear the man who was to instruct them in these branches.  \"Lieutenant-Colonel Foch did not disappoint their expectations.  Thin, elegant, of distinguished bearing, he at once struck the beholder with his expression--full of energy, of calm, of rectitude.  \"His forehead was high, his nose straight and prominent, his gray-blue eyes looked one full in the face.  He spoke without gestures, with an air of authority and conviction; his voice serious, harsh, a little monotonous; amplifying his phrases to press home in every possible way a rigorous reasoning; provoking discussion; always appealing to the logic of his hearers; sometimes difficult to follow, because his discourse was so rich in ideas; but always holding attention by the penetration of his surveys as well as by his tone of sincerity.  \"The most profound and the most original of the professors at the school of war, which at that time counted in its teaching corps many very distinguished minds and brilliant lecturers: such Lieutenant-Colonel Foch seemed to his students, all eager from the first to give themselves up to the enjoyment of his lessons and the acceptance of his inspiration.\"  Colonel E. Réquin of the French general staff, who has fought under Foch in some of the latter's greatest engagements, says:  \"Foch has been for forty years the incarnation of the French military spirit.\"  For forty years!  That means ever since he left the cavalry school at Saumur and went, as captain of the Tenth regiment of artillery, to Rennes.  \"Through his teachings and his example,\" Colonel Réquin goes on to say, in a 1918 number of the _World's Work_, \"he was the moral director of the French general staff before becoming the supreme chief of the allied armies.  Upon each one of us he has imprinted his strong mark. We owe to him in time of peace that unity of doctrine which was our strength.  Since the war we owe to him the highest lessons of intellectual discipline and moral energy.  \"As a professor he applied the method which consists in taking as the base of all strategical and tactical instruction the study of history completed by the study of military history--that is to say, field operations, orders given, actions, results, and criticisms to be made and the instructions to be drawn from them.  He also used concrete cases--that is to say, problems laid by the director on the map or on the actual ground.  \"By this intellectual training he accustomed the officers to solving all problems, not by giving them ready-made solutions, but by making them find the logical solution to each individual case.  \"His mind was trained through so many years of study that no war situation could disturb him.  In the most difficult ones, he quickly pointed out the goal to be reached and the means to employ, and each one of us felt that it must be right.\"  But best of all the things said about Foch in that period of his life, I like this, by Charles Dawbarn, in the _Fortnightly Review_:  \"Such was\"--in spite of many disappointments--\"_his fine confidence in life, that he communicated to others not his grievances, but his secret satisfactions_.\"     IX  THE GREAT TEACHER  Foch made the men who sat under him love their work for the work's sake and not for its rewards.  He fired them with an ardor for military art which made them feel that in all the world there is nothing so fascinating, so worth while, as knowing how to defend one's country when she needs defense.  He was able, in peace times when the military spirit was little applauded and much decried, to give his students an enthusiasm for \"preparedness\" which flamed as high and burned as pure as that which ordinarily is lighted only by a great national rush to arms to save the country from ravage.  It was tremendously, incalculably important for France and for all of us that Ferdinand Foch was eager and able to impart this enthusiasm for military skill.  But also it is immensely important, to-day, when the war is won, and in all days and all walks of life, that there be those who can kindle and keep alight the enthusiasm of their fellows; who can overlook the failure of their own ardor and faithfulness to win its fair reward, and convey to others only the alluring glow of their \"secret satisfactions.\"  In the five years, 1895-1901 (his work at the school was interrupted by politics in 1901), \"many hundreds of officers,\" as René Puaux says, \"the very elite of the general staffs of our army, followed his teaching and were imbued with it; and as they practically all, at the beginning of the war, occupied high positions of command, one may estimate as he can the profound and far reaching influence of this one grand spirit.\"  Let us try to get some idea of the sort of thing that Foch taught those hundreds of French army officers, not only about war but about life.  From all his study, he repeatedly declared, one dominant conviction has evolved: Force that is not dominated by spirit is vain force.  Victory, in his belief, goes to those who merit it by the greatest strength of will and intelligence.  It was his endeavor, always, to develop in the hundreds of officers who were his students, that dual strength in which it seemed to him that victory could only lie: moral and intellectual ability to perceive what ought to be done, and intellectual and moral ability to do it.  In his mind, it is impossible to be intelligent with the brain alone. The Germans do not comprehend this, and therein, to Ferdinand Foch, lies the key to all their failures.  He believes that each of us must think with our soul's aid--that is to say, with our imagination, our emotions, our aspiration--and employ our intelligence to direct our feeling.  And he asks this combination not from higher officers alone, but from all their men down to the humblest in the ranks.  He believes in the invincibility of men fighting for a principle dearer to them than life--but he knows that ardor without leadership means a lost cause; that men must know how to fight for their ideals, their principles; but that their officers are charged with the sacred responsibility of making the men's ardor and valor count.  At the beginning of his celebrated course of lectures on tactics he always admonished his students thus:  \"You will be called on later to be the brain of an army.  So I say to you to-day: Learn to think.\"  By this he was far from meaning that officers were to confine thinking to themselves, but that they were to teach themselves to think so that they might the better hand on intelligence and stimulate their men to obey not blindly but comprehendingly.  It was a maxim of Napoleon's, of which Foch is very fond, that \"as a general rule, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17511"],["title","Foch the Man: A Life of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies (#7)"],["body","nder-in-chief ought only to indicate the direction, determine the ends to be attained; the means of getting there ought to be left to the free choice of the mediums of execution, without whom success is impossible.\"  This leaves a great responsibility to officers, but it is the secret of that flexibility which makes the French army so effective.  For Foch carries his belief in individual judgment far beyond the officers commanding units; he carries it to the privates in the ranks.  An able officer, in Foch's opinion, is one who can take a general command to get his men such-and-such a place and accomplish such-and-such a thing, and so interpret that command to his men that each and every one of them will, while acting in strict obedience to orders, use the largest possible amount of personal intelligence in accomplishing the thing he was told to do.  It is said that there was probably never before in history a battle fought in which every man was a general--so to speak--as at the battle of Château Thierry, in July, 1918.  That is to say, there was probably never before a battle in which so many men comprehended as clearly as if they had been generals what it was all about, and acted as if they had been generals to attain their objectives.  It was an intelligent democracy, acting under superb leadership that vanquished the forces of autocracy.  Foch has worked with a free hand to test the worth of his lifelong principles.  And the hundreds of men he trained in those principles were ready to carry them out for him.  No wonder his first injunction was: Learn to think!  To him, the leadership of units is not a simple question of organization, of careful plans, of strategic and tactical intelligence, but a problem involving enormous adaptability.  Battles are not won at headquarters, he contends; they are won in the field; and the conditions that may arise in the field cannot be foreseen or forestalled--they must be met when they present themselves. In large part they are made by the behavior of men in unexpected circumstances; therefore, the more a commander knows about human nature and its spiritual depressions and exaltations, the better able he is to change his plans as new conditions arise.  German power in war, Foch taught his students, lay in the great masses of their effective troops and their perfect organization for moving men and supplies.  German weakness was in the absolute autocracy of great headquarters, building its plans as an architect builds a house and unable to modify them if something happens to make a change necessary.  This he deduced from his study of their methods in previous wars, especially in that of 1870.  And with this in mind he labored so that when Germany made her next assault upon France, France might be equipped with hundreds of officers cognizant of Germany's weakness and prepared to turn it to her defeat.     X  A COLONEL AT FIFTY  \"It was not,\" Napoleon wrote, \"the Roman legions which conquered Gaul, but Caesar.  It was not the Carthaginian soldiers who made Rome tremble, but Hannibal.  It was not the Macedonian phalanx which penetrated India, but Alexander.  It was not the French army which reached the Weser and the Inn, but Turenne.  It was not the Prussian soldiers who defended their country for seven years against the three most formidable powers in Europe; it was Frederick the Great.\"  And already it has been suggested that historians will write of this war: \"It was not the allied armies, struggling hopelessly for four years, that finally drove the Germans across the Rhine, but Ferdinand Foch.\"  But I am sure that Foch would not wish this said of him in the same sense that Napoleon said it of earlier generals.  For Foch has a greater vision of generalship than was possible to any commander of long ago.  His strategy is based upon a close study of theirs; for he says that though the forms of making war evolve, the directing principles do not change, and there is need for every officer to make analyses of Xenophon and Caesar and Hannibal as close as those he makes of Frederick and Napoleon.  But his conception of military leadership is permeated with the ideals of democracy and justice for which he fights.  One of his great lectures to student-officers was that in which he made them realize what, besides the route of the Prussians, happened at Valmy in September, 1792.  On his big military map of that region (it is on the western edge of the Argonne) Foch would show his students how the Prussians, Hessians and some Austrian troops; under the Duke of Brunswick, crossed the French frontier on August 19 and came swaggering toward Paris, braggartly announcing their intentions of \"celebrating\" in Paris in September.  Brunswick and his fellow generals were to banquet with the King of Prussia at the Tuileries.  And the soldiers were bent upon the cafés of the Palais Royal.  Foch showed his classes how Dumouriez, who had been training his raw troops of disorganized France at Valenciennes, dashed with them into the Argonne to intercept Brunswick; how this and that happened which I will not repeat here because it is merely technical; and then how the soldiers of the republic, rallied by the cry, \"The country is in danger,\" and thrilled by \"The Marseillaise\" (written only five months before, but already it had changed the beat of nearly every heart in France), made such a stand that it not only halted Prussia and her allies, but so completely broke their conquering spirit that without firing another shot they took themselves off beyond the Rhine.  \"We,\" Foch used to tell his students, \"are the successors of the revolution and the empire, the inheritors of the art, new-born upon the field of Valmy to astonish the old Europe, to surprise in particular the Duke of Brunswick, the pupil of Frederick the Great, and to tear from Goethe, before the immensity of a fresh horizon, this profound cry: 'I tell you, from this place and this day comes a new era in the history of the world!'\"  It is that new era which Foch typifies--that new era which his adversaries, deaf to Goethe's cry and blind to Goethe's vision, have not yet realized.  It was \"the old Europe\" against which Foch fought--the old Europe which learned nothing at Valmy and had learned nothing since; the old Europe that fought as Frederick the Great fought and that had not yet seen the dawn of that new day which our nation and the French nation greeted with glad hails much more than a century ago.  In 1792 Prussia measured her military skill and her masses of trained men against France's  disorganization--and  overlooked \"The Marseillaise.\"  In 1914 she weighed her might against what she knew of the might of France--and omitted to weigh certain spiritual differences which she could not comprehend, but which she felt at the first battle of the Marne, has been feeling ever since, and before which she had to retire, beaten but still blind.  In 1918 she estimated the probable force of those \"raw recruits\" whom we were sending overseas--and laughed.  She based her calculations on our lack of military tradition, our hastily trained officers, our \"soft,\" ease-loving men uneducated in those ideals of blood and iron wherein she has reared her youth always.  She overlooked that spiritual force which the \"new era\" develops and which made our men so responsive to the command of Foch at Château Thierry and later.  \"The immensity of a fresh horizon\" whereon Goethe saw the new era dawning, is still veiled from the vision of his countrymen.  But across its roseate reaches unending columns of marching men passed, under the leadership of Ferdinand Foch, to liberate the captives the blind brute has made and to strike down the strongholds of \"old Europe\" forever.  For nearly six years Foch taught such principles as these and others which I shall recall in connection with great events which they made possible later on.  Then came the anti-clerical wave in French politics, and on its crest a new commandant to the School of War--a man elevated by the anti-clericals and eager to keep his elevation by pleasing those who put him there.  Foch adheres devoutly to the religious practices in which he was reared, and one of his brothers belongs to the Jesuit order.  These conditions made his continuance at the school under its new head impossible.  Whether he resigned because he realized this, or was superseded, I do not know.  But he left his post and went as lieutenant-colonel to the Twenty-ninth artillery, at Laon.  He was there two years and undoubtedly made a thorough study of the country round Laon--which was for more than four years to be the key to the German tenure in that part of France.  Ferdinand Foch, with his brilliant knowledge and high ideals of soldiering, was now past fifty and not yet a colonel.  Strong though his spirit was, sustained by faith in God and rewarded by those \"secret satisfactions\" which come to the man who loves his work and is conscious of having given it his best, he must have had hours, days, when he drank deep of the cup of bitterness.  There are, though, bitters that shrivel and bitters that tone and invigorate.  Or perhaps they are the same and the difference is in us.  At any rate, Foch was not poisoned at the cup of disappointment.  And when the armies under his command encircled the great rock whereon Laon is perched high above the surrounding plains I hope Foch was with them--in memory of the days when he was \"dumped\" there, so to speak, far away from his sphere of influence at the School of War.  In 1903 he was made colonel and sent to the Thirty-fifth artillery at Vannes, in Brittany.  Only two years later he was called to Orleans as chief of staff of the Fifth army corps.  On June 20, 1907, he was made Brigadier General and passed to the general staff of the French army at Paris.  Soon afterwards, Georges Clemenceau became Minister of War, and was seeking a new head for the Staff College.  Everyone whose advice he"]]]
