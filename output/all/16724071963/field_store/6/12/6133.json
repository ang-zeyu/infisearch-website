So the redoubtable old radical and anti-clerical summoned General Foch.  \"I offer you command of the School of War.\"  \"I thank you,\" Foch replied, \"but you are doubtless unaware that one of my brothers is a Jesuit.\"  \"I know it very well,\" was Clemenceau's answer.  \"But you make good officers, and that is the only thing which counts.\"  Thus was foreshadowed, in these two great men, that spirit of \"all for France\" which, under the civil leadership of one and the military leadership of the other, was to save the country and the world.  In 1911 Foch, at 60, was given command of the Thirteenth division at Chaumont, just above the source of the Marne.  On December 17, 1912, he was placed at the head of the Eighth Army Corps, at Bourges.  And on August 23, 1913, he took command of the Twentieth corps at Nancy.  \"When,\" says Marcel Knecht, \"we in Nancy heard that Foch had been chosen to command the best troops in France, the Twentieth Army Corps, pride of our capital, everybody went wild with enthusiasm.\"  It is M. Knecht who tells us about the visit to General Foch at Nancy, in the spring of 1914, of three British generals whose presence there Foch utilized for two purposes:  He showed them what he was doing to strengthen Nancy's defensibility, and thereby urged upon them France's conviction that an attack by Germany was imminent and unavoidable; and he utilized the occasion to show the Lorrainers his warm friendliness for England--which Lorraine was inclined still to blame for the death of Joan of Arc.  Foch knew that German propagandists were continually fanning this resentment against England.  And he made it part of his business to overcome that prejudice by showing the honor in which he held Great Britain's eminent soldiers.     XI  FORTIFYING FRANCE WITH GREAT PRINCIPLES  So much has been said about France's unreadiness for the war that it is easy for those who do not know what the real situation was to suppose that the French were something akin to fools.  For twenty centuries the Germans had been swarming over the Rhine in preying, ravaging hordes, and France had been beating them back to save her national life.  That they would swarm again, more insolent and more rapacious than ever after their triumph of 1870, was not to be doubted.  Everyone in France who had the slightest knowledge of the spirit that has animated the Hohenzollern empire knew its envy of France, its cupidity of France's wealth, its hatred of France's attractions for all the world.  Everyone who came in contact with the Germans felt the bullet-headed belligerence of their attitude which they were never at any pains to conceal.  The military men of France knew that Germany had for years been preparing for aggression on a large scale.  They knew that she would strike when she felt that she was readiest and her opponents of the Triple Entente were least ready.  The state of mind of the civilians--busy, prosperous, peace-loving, concerned with conversational warfare about a multitude of petty internal affairs--is difficult to describe.  But I think it may not be impertinent to say of it that it was something like the state of mind of a congregation, well fed, comfortable, conscious of many pleasant virtues and few corroding sins, before whom a preacher holds up the last judgment.  None of them hopes to escape it, none of them can tell at what moment he may be called to his account, none of them would wish to go in just his present state, and yet none of them does anything when he leaves church to put himself more definitely in readiness for that great decision which is to determine where he shall spend eternity.  In 1911 it seemed for a brief while that the irruption from the east was at hand.  But Germany did not feel quite ready; she \"dickered\"; and things went on seemingly as before.  France seemed to forget.  But she was not so completely abandoned to hopefulness as was England--England, who turned her deafest ear to Lord Roberts' impassioned pleas for preparedness.  France has an institution called the Superior War Council.  It is the supreme organ of military authority and the center of national defense; it consists of eleven members supposed to be the ablest commanding generals in the nation.  The president of this council is the Minister of War; the vice president is known as the generalissimo of the French army.  In 1910 General Joseph Joffre became a member of the Superior War Council, and in 1911 he became generalissimo.  It was because the Council felt the imminence of war with Germany that General Pau--to whom the vice presidency should have gone by right of his priority and also of his eminent fitness--patriotically waived the honor, because in two years he would be sixty-five and would have to retire; he felt that the defense of the country needed a younger man who could remain more years in service.  So Joffre was chosen and almost immediately he began to justify the choice.  Joffre and his associates of the council not only foresaw the war, but they quite clearly previsioned its extent and something of its character.  In 1912 Joffre declared \"the fighting front will extend from four hundred to five hundred miles.\"  He talked little, but he worked prodigiously; and always his insistence was: \"We must be prepared!\"  \"With whole nations,\" he said, \"engaged in a mortal combat, disaster is certain for those who in time of peace failed to prepare for war.\"  And \"To be ready means, to-day, to have mustered in advance all the resources of the country, all the intelligence of its citizens, all their moral energy, for the purpose of attaining this one aim--victory. Getting ready is a duty that devolves not only upon the army, but upon all public officials, upon all organizations, upon all societies, upon all families, upon all citizens.\"  This complete readiness was beyond his power to effect.  But in his province--the army--he achieved marvels that were almost miracles.  It was France's good fortune (and that of her allies) that in all he undertook for the purification and strengthening of the army Joffre had, from January, 1912, the complete co-operation of the Minister of War, M. Millerand.  Together, these two men, brilliantly supported by some of Joffre's colleagues in the Superior Council--notably Pau and Castelnau--achieved results that have been pronounced \"unparalleled in the history of the Third Republic.\"  They freed the army from the worst effects of political influence, made it once more a popular institution, and organized it into an effectiveness which needs, now, no comment.  When Foch was put in command of the Twentieth army corps at Nancy it was in the expectation that Nancy would sustain the first shock of the German invasion when it came.  The opinion prevailed that Nancy could not be held.  Whether Joffre was of this opinion or not, I do not know. If he was, he probably felt that Foch would give it up only after harder fighting than any other general.  But Foch believed that Nancy could be defended, and so did his immediate superior, the gallant General Castelnau, in command of the Second Army of Lorraine.  For nearly a year following upon his appointment to Nancy, Foch labored mightily to strengthen Nancy against the attack which was impending. He seems never to have doubted that Germany would make her first aggression there, only seventeen miles from her own border, and with Metz and Strassburg to back the invading army.  But that there were other opinions, even at Nancy, I happen to know. For, one day while the war was still new, I chanced in rooting in an old bookstall in Paris, to find a book which was written by an officer of the Twentieth Corps, in 1911.[1]  The officer was, if I mistake not, of the artillery, and he wrote this \"forecast\" to entertain the members of his mess or battery.  He predicted with amazing accuracy the successive events which happened nearly three years later, only he \"guessed\" the order for mobilization in France to fall on August 14, instead of August 1; and all his subsequent dates were just about two weeks later than the actualities. But he \"foresaw\" the invasion of Belgium, the resistance at Li√©ge and Namur, the fall of Brussels, the invasion of France by her northeastern portals.  Almost--at the time I read this book--it might have served as history instead of prophecy.  I would that I had it now!  But I clearly remember that it located the final battle of the war in Westphalia, describing the location exactly.  And that it said the Emperor would perish in that downfall of his empire.  And it cited two prophecies current in Germany--the long-standing one to the effect that Germany's greatest disaster would come to her under an Emperor with a withered arm, and one made in Strassburg in 1870, declaring that the new empire would dissolve under its third Emperor.  The book was published in January, 1912, if I remember rightly, and was almost immediately translated into German.  And I was told that one hundred thousand copies were sold in Germany in a very short time, and it was made the subject of editorials in nearly every prominent German paper.  Probably Foch read it.  He may even have discussed it with the author. But he held to the belief that when the attack came it would come through Nancy.  He was not, however, expecting it when it came.   [1] The reason I cannot give his name, nor quote directly from his book, is that a fellow-traveler borrowed the book from me and I have never seen it since.     XII  ON THE EVE OF WAR  In the first days of July, 1914, divisional maneuvers were held as usual in Lorraine.  Castelnau and Foch reviewed the troops, known throughout the army as \"the division of iron.\"  A young captain, recently assigned from the School of War to a regiment of Hussars forming part of the Twentieth army corps, wrote to his parents on July 5 an account of the maneuvers in which he had just taken part.  He said that \"the presence of these two"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1752"],["title","El Dorado: An Adventure of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#0)"],["body","DORADO  By Baroness Orczy     FOREWORD  There has of late years crept so much confusion into the mind of the student as well as of the general reader as to the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel with that of the Gascon Royalist plotter known to history as the Baron de Batz, that the time seems opportune for setting all doubts on that subject at rest.  The identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel is in no way whatever connected with that of the Baron de Batz, and even superficial reflection will soon bring the mind to the conclusion that great fundamental differences existed in these two men, in their personality, in their character, and, above all, in their aims.  According to one or two enthusiastic historians, the Baron de Batz was the chief agent in a vast network of conspiracy, entirely supported by foreign money--both English and Austrian--and which had for its object the overthrow of the Republican Government and the restoration of the monarchy in France.  In order to attain this political goal, it is averred that he set himself the task of pitting the members of the revolutionary Government one against the other, and bringing hatred and dissensions amongst them, until the cry of ‚ÄúTraitor!‚Äù resounded from one end of the Assembly of the Convention to the other, and the Assembly itself became as one vast den of wild beasts wherein wolves and hyenas devoured one another and, still unsatiated, licked their streaming jaws hungering for more prey.  Those same enthusiastic historians, who have a firm belief in the so-called ‚ÄúForeign Conspiracy,‚Äù ascribe every important event of the Great Revolution--be that event the downfall of the Girondins, the escape of the Dauphin from the Temple, or the death of Robespierre--to the intrigues of Baron de Batz. He it was, so they say, who egged the Jacobins on against the Mountain, Robespierre against Danton, Hebert against Robespierre. He it was who instigated the massacres of September, the atrocities of Nantes, the horrors of Thermidor, the sacrileges, the noyades: all with the view of causing every section of the National Assembly to vie with the other in excesses and in cruelty, until the makers of the Revolution, satiated with their own lust, turned on one another, and Sardanapalus-like buried themselves and their orgies in the vast hecatomb of a self-consumed anarchy.  Whether the power thus ascribed to Baron de Batz by his historians is real or imaginary it is not the purpose of this preface to investigate. Its sole object is to point out the difference between the career of this plotter and that of the Scarlet Pimpernel.  The Baron de Batz himself was an adventurer without substance, save that which he derived from abroad. He was one of those men who have nothing to lose and everything to gain by throwing themselves headlong in the seething cauldron of internal politics.  Though he made several attempts at rescuing King Louis first, and then the Queen and Royal Family from prison and from death, he never succeeded, as we know, in any of these undertakings, and he never once so much as attempted the rescue of other equally innocent, if not quite so distinguished, victims of the most bloodthirsty revolution that has ever shaken the foundations of the civilised world.  Nay more; when on the 29th Prairial those unfortunate men and women were condemned and executed for alleged complicity in the so-called ‚ÄúForeign Conspiracy,‚Äù de Batz, who is universally admitted to have been the head and prime-mover of that conspiracy--if, indeed, conspiracy there was--never made either the slightest attempt to rescue his confederates from the guillotine, or at least the offer to perish by their side if he could not succeed in saving them.  And when we remember that the martyrs of the 29th Prairial included women like Grandmaison, the devoted friend of de Batz, the beautiful Emilie de St. Amaranthe, little Cecile Renault--a mere child not sixteen years of age--also men like Michonis and Roussell, faithful servants of de Batz, the Baron de Lezardiere, and the Comte de St. Maurice, his friends, we no longer can have the slightest doubt that the Gascon plotter and the English gentleman are indeed two very different persons.  The latter‚Äôs aims were absolutely non-political. He never intrigued for the restoration of the monarchy, or even for the overthrow of that Republic which he loathed.  His only concern was the rescue of the innocent, the stretching out of a saving hand to those unfortunate creatures who had fallen into the nets spread out for them by their fellow-men; by those who--godless, lawless, penniless themselves--had sworn to exterminate all those who clung to their belongings, to their religion, and to their beliefs.  The Scarlet Pimpernel did not take it upon himself to punish the guilty; his care was solely of the helpless and of the innocent.  For this aim he risked his life every time that he set foot on French soil, for it he sacrificed his fortune, and even his personal happiness, and to it he devoted his entire existence.  Moreover, whereas the French plotter is said to have had confederates even in the Assembly of the Convention, confederates who were sufficiently influential and powerful to secure his own immunity, the Englishman when he was bent on his errands of mercy had the whole of France against him.  The Baron de Batz was a man who never justified either his own ambitions or even his existence; the Scarlet Pimpernel was a personality of whom an entire nation might justly be proud.

CHAPTER I. IN THE THEATRE NATIONAL  And yet people found the opportunity to amuse themselves, to dance and to go to the theatre, to enjoy music and open-air cafes and promenades in the Palais Royal.  New fashions in dress made their appearance, milliners produced fresh ‚Äúcreations,‚Äù and jewellers were not idle. A grim sense of humour, born of the very intensity of ever-present danger, had dubbed the cut of certain tunics ‚Äútete tranche,‚Äù or a favourite ragout was called ‚Äúa la guillotine.‚Äù  On three evenings only during the past memorable four and a half years did the theatres close their doors, and these evenings were the ones immediately following that terrible 2nd of September the day of the butchery outside the Abbaye prison, when Paris herself was aghast with horror, and the cries of the massacred might have drowned the calls of the audience whose hands upraised for plaudits would still be dripping with blood.  On all other evenings of these same four and a half years the theatres in the Rue de Richelieu, in the Palais Royal, the Luxembourg, and others, had raised their curtains and taken money at their doors. The same audience that earlier in the day had whiled away the time by witnessing the ever-recurrent dramas of the Place de la Revolution assembled here in the evenings and filled stalls, boxes, and tiers, laughing over the satires of Voltaire or weeping over the sentimental tragedies of persecuted Romeos and innocent Juliets.  Death knocked at so many doors these days! He was so constant a guest in the houses of relatives and friends that those who had merely shaken him by the hand, those on whom he had smiled, and whom he, still smiling, had passed indulgently by, looked on him with that subtle contempt born of familiarity, shrugged their shoulders at his passage, and envisaged his probable visit on the morrow with lighthearted indifference.  Paris--despite the horrors that had stained her walls had remained a city of pleasure, and the knife of the guillotine did scarce descend more often than did the drop-scenes on the stage.  On this bitterly cold evening of the 27th Nivose, in the second year of the Republic--or, as we of the old style still persist in calling it, the 16th of January, 1794--the auditorium of the Theatre National was filled with a very brilliant company.  The appearance of a favourite actress in the part of one of Moliere‚Äôs volatile heroines had brought pleasure-loving Paris to witness this revival of ‚ÄúLe Misanthrope,‚Äù with new scenery, dresses, and the aforesaid charming actress to add piquancy to the master‚Äôs mordant wit.  The Moniteur, which so impartially chronicles the events of those times, tells us under that date that the Assembly of the Convention voted on that same day a new law giving fuller power to its spies, enabling them to effect domiciliary searches at their"]]]
