He'll run away with you!\"  But Andy was too light-hearted to pay heed to the warning, and soon he was well in advance of his companion. Then he sighted the carriage in the distance, and urged his horse to greater efforts.  \"Whoop-la! Here we come!\" he yelled, and set up a great shouting.  \"It's Andy!\" cried Pepper. \"My, but he is riding some!\"  \"He always was a good one on horseback,\" said Fred.  \"He wants to be careful; that horse is an ugly one,\" came from Jack. \"I heard a man at the dock say he wouldn't own the beast at any price.\"  Soon Andy ranged up beside the carriage.  \"You're too slow for me!\" he sang out merrily. \"I'll have to go ahead and tell Captain Putnam you are coming.\"  He slapped the horse on the neck. Hardly had he done so when up came the animal's hind hoofs, almost unseating him. Then the horse made a mad leap forward and started down the highway at top speed.  \"My, see him go!\"  \"He is running away!\"  \"Andy, look out for yourself!\"  \"If he throws you he'll kill you!\"  So the cries rang out from the carriage as horse and rider sped over the highway leading to Putnam Hall.  Andy paid no attention to what was said. Of a sudden he had his hands full trying to keep on the horse's back. The steed was galloping along with a peculiar motion.  \"Whoa! whoa, Jim!\" yelled Andy, but Jim paid no attention. He was off for a run and did not care what happened.  The blanket had not been securely fastened and before long it commenced to slip towards the horse's tail. Andy tried to haul it back. His efforts were but partly successful, and with an end of the blanket trailing around one of his hind legs, the steed became more unmanageable than ever.  On and on went horse and rider, until, in the distance, Putnam Hall loomed up. On one side of the highway were the woods lining the lake shore; on the other the broad campus leading to the school and other buildings.  \"He'll slow up now,\" thought Andy. \"Unless he bolts right into his stable. If he tries that I'll have to jump for it.\"  In front of the school building the roadway widened out into several curves. Andy thought Jim would take to one of the curves, but he was mistaken. On kept the steed, directly past the institution of learning.  On the campus were a score or more of cadets, who stared in amazement at the sight of the runaway horse with the boy clinging desperately to his back.  \"It's Andy Snow!\" cried Henry Lee, the captain of Company A.  \"So it is,\" responded Bob Grenwood, the quartermaster of the school battalion. \"How in the world did he get on that horse?\"  \"It's the one that was hitched to the carryall,\" put in Billy Sabine, another cadet. \"Something is wrong.\"  \"Let's tell Captain Putnam,\" said another.  \"Whoa! whoa!\" yelled Andy, frantically, when he realized that the horse was not going to pass into the grounds. \"Whoa, I say! You've gone far enough!\"  The only effect his words had was to make Jim travel a little faster. Away they went, past the gymnasium and the stables and then along the country road leading to the farms back of the lake.  \"Well, if you won't stop, go on,\" said Andy, presently. \"You'll get tired sooner or later, old man. But, remember, you've got to bring me back, no matter how tired you are.\"  A good half-mile was covered, and then horse and rider reached a sharp turn in the highway. Here the trees were thick and some of the branches hung low.  [Illustration: THE YOUNG MAJOR STILL LAY WITH HIS EYES CLOSED      _The Mystery of Putnam Hall._ (Page 19)]  Andy bent down that he might avoid the branches. But he did not get quite low enough. He looked ahead, saw a man standing on one side of the roadway staring in astonishment at him, and the next instant he found himself caught by the throat in a tree-limb and carried off the horse. Then Jim bounded on riderless, and poor Andy, kicking and thrashing wildly, sprang free of the tree-limb and landed on his shoulder in the roadway.  The man who had seen him coming leaped to one side, and just in the nick of time, for the runaway horse passed within a foot of him. The man gasped in astonishment, and for several seconds did not know apparently what to do.  \"Looks like he was killed,\" the man muttered to himself, as he took a few steps forward. Andy had rolled over on his back and lay stretched out, with his eyes closed, very much as poor Jack had been stretched out only a short while before.  The man looked up and down the roadway and saw that nobody else was in sight, that part of the highway being but little traveled. Then he came closer to the unconscious boy and bent over him.  \"Only stunned, I reckon!\" he muttered to himself. \"Wonder if he belongs around here?\"  As the man bent over Andy he saw the lad's watch dangling from its chain, fastened to a buttonhole of the youth's vest. Then his ferret-like eyes caught sight of a fine ruby pin in Andy's necktie.  \"He could easily lose that watch on the road, riding like that, and the pin, too,\" he muttered to himself. \"It's a fine chance to make a little haul!\"  He straightened up and took another look around. Not a soul was in sight. With dexterous fingers he unfastened the watch and chain and transferred them to his pocket. The stickpin followed. Then he slipped his hand into a vest-pocket and brought out a five-dollar bill and three one-dollar bills.  \"Eight dollars!\" he muttered. \"Not so bad but what it might be worse. I reckon the watch, chain and pin will bring me another twenty or thirty. Sparrow, you are in luck to-day.\"  He lingered, wondering if Andy had anything more of value about him. The youth wore a ring with a cameo in it, but it looked tight and hard to get off.  \"Might try his other pockets,\" mused the thief. Then a distant shouting came to his ears.  \"Somebody is after him,\" he muttered. \"I reckon it's time I cleared out. It won't do for me to be seen in this neighborhood.\"  He looked around for an instant. Then he walked to the roadside, ran in among the trees and bushes, and disappeared from view.     CHAPTER IV.  A FRUITLESS SEARCH   \"Hello, Pepper!\"  \"How are you, Fred?\"  \"My, here's the old bunch back again!\"  \"Well, Henry, did you have a good time during the summer?\"  \"How about that trip out West, Bob? Did you kill any bears or Indians?\"  \"Getting high-toned, hiring a carriage to bring you.\"  So the cries rang out, as the three-seated carriage driven by Amos Darrison rolled up to the front of Putnam Hall. A crowd of cadets had rushed forward to greet the newcomers.  \"Where is Andy Snow?\" asked Pepper, as he leaped to the ground.  \"He went past on horseback like a streak!\" cried Bob Grenwood. \"Some of the fellows just went off to tell Captain Putnam about it. What did it mean?\"  \"Tell you later, Bob. Just now somebody had better go after Andy. That horse was running away with him.\"  A hubbub arose, in the midst of which Captain Putnam, the owner of the school, appeared. He was a fine-looking gentleman, with a face that was at once kindly and firm.  \"What is this I hear about Andrew Snow?\" he said anxiously. \"A horse ran away with him?\"  In as few words as possible Pepper and some of the others related the particulars of what had happened to the carryall. Just as they were finishing, Peleg Snuggers came up on the other horse.  \"This is very unfortunate!\" murmured Captain Putnam. \"We'll have to follow poor Snow at once. Mr. Darrison, will you drive me?\"  \"Why--er--yes, but it will take time, Captain Putnam, an' my wife wants me to----\"  \"I'll pay you for your time, sir,\" interrupted the owner of the school quickly.  \"Yes, sir? all right, sir. Jump in an' we'll go right after the runaway.\"  \"Can I go along?\" asked Pepper.  \"I'd like to go, too,\" came from Stuffer Singleton.  \"So would I,\" added Bob Grenwood.  \"Very well, you three cadets can go along,\" replied the captain. \"It is possible you may be needed--if poor Snow has been hurt.\" He turned to Jack. \"How do you feel, Major Ruddy?\"  \"Oh, I guess I'll be all right after I have rested up,\" answered Jack, with a faint smile.  \"You have a cut on the forehead.\"  \"Yes, sir, but it doesn't hurt like it did.\"  \"Better bathe it with warm water and put something on it,\" said Captain Putnam, and then leaped into the carriage, and Pepper, Stuffer and Bob followed.  \"Hope they find Andy all right,\" said Joe Nelson, as the turnout moved off in the direction the runaway had taken.  \"Yes, it would be too bad if Andy was seriously injured,\" answered the young major. \"Come on, I'm going in and wash up and put some witch hazel on my forehead.\"  \"Glad to see you, young gentlemen,\" said a pleasant voice, when the newcomers entered the school building, and George Strong, the second assistant teacher, stepped forward to shake each by the hand. \"I hope you all had a nice time this summer.\" And then he asked about the broken-down carryall and looked at Jack's wound.  Although he did not say so to his chums, Jack was glad enough to get upstairs to his dormitory and rest. The room was a large one and was occupied not only by the young major but also by Pepper, Andy and several others. While some of the boys busied themselves in arranging their things, Jack rested in an easy chair near the window.  \"Quite a few new fellows here this term,\" said Fred, who was present. \"I understand that all of the new dormitories that were built in the wing this summer will be filled up.\"  \"That shows the school is growing popular,\" answered the young major.  \"Jack, aren't you afraid somebody will try to get your position away from you?\" went on Fred.  \"What do you mean, Fred? Try to be elected major?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, some of the fellows deserve the position. Bart Connors, the captain of Company B, would make a fine major, and so would Henry Lee, the captain of Company A. And Sergeant Dave Kearney is a good"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],["title","The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#4)"],["body"," who deserves promotion.\"  \"Then you don't care so much for the position?\"  \"Oh, yes, I do care. But I realize that it isn't fair to be major all the time. I'm willing to step down and give the other fellows a show.\"  \"But not a fellow like Reff Ritter, or that Dan Baxter you told me about.\"  \"No, I couldn't stand for those chaps.\"  \"Reff is as sore as he can be over what happened last term.\"  \"I know it.\"  \"Dale says he knows something about Reff.\"  \"I do,\" came from Dale Blackmore, who had entered a moment before. \"Do you know, in one way I am sorry for Ritter,\" he added.  \"What is it you know?\" asked Fred.  \"I don't suppose I ought to speak about it, but it is bound to get out sooner or later. It seems Mr. Ritter, Reff's father, was a rich stock broker and promoter of various mining companies. Well, this summer he got himself tangled up in some mining companies that were trying to make money too fast. As a consequence he lost the most of his wealth, and some folks who had bought mining stock from him came close to having him arrested for fraud. It was that state of affairs that made Reff give up his trip to the Adirondacks and go home. I got it from some close friends that the Ritters were almost cleaned out, and that Mr. Ritter wanted Reff to give up school and go to work. But Mrs. Ritter was too proud and insisted that Reff be returned to Putnam Hall. So he is back.\"  \"Well, that certainly is hard luck,\" returned Fred. \"I wonder if Coulter and Paxton will stick to him, now he is poor? My notion of it was, Coulter stuck to him mainly for what he could get out of it, he not having much spending money of his own.\"  \"Well, I shan't throw it up to Reff that he is poor,\" said Jack, quickly. \"All he has got to do is to behave himself and I'll treat him as well as anybody.\" And then the young major left the dormitory, to bathe his head in the bathroom, and wash up generally.  In the meantime those in the carriage had driven along the country road until they came upon the unconscious form of Andy. All leaped out and gathered around while Captain Putnam made an examination.  \"He has had a bad fall,\" said the master of the school. \"But I doubt if any bones are broken.\"  They raised the sufferer up, and presently Andy stirred and opened his eyes.  \"Whoa!\" he murmured. \"Whoa!\"  \"He must think he is still on horseback!\" cried Pepper, and but for Andy's pale face he would have laughed outright.  \"Snow, are you hurt much?\" asked Captain Putnam, kindly. \"The horse is gone. You are safe.\"  \"Oh!\" gasped poor Andy, and then he stared around in bewilderment. \"I--I was hung up in the--the tree, wasn't I?\"  \"If you were, you must have dropped down,\" answered Bob Grenwood.  \"Yes. I remember now. I got caught by the throat and then I dropped--and that's all I know. Where is the horse?\"  \"Went on, I guess,\" answered Stuffer Singleton. \"He was streaking it like an Indian when you passed the Hall.\"  \"Shall we help you to get up?\" asked Captain Putnam.  \"I--I suppose so,\" faltered Andy. \"Oh, dear, but I'm weak!\" he added, as he tried to rise.  \"Let us carry him to the carriage,\" suggested Pepper, and this was done, and he was made as comfortable on the cushions as possible.  \"I wonder did anybody catch the horse?\" asked the acrobatic youth, as the turnout was on its way to Putnam Hall.  \"I don't know. I'll find out after you have been taken care of,\" answered Captain Putnam. \"You cadets are certainly arriving this term in an unusual manner,\" he added grimly.  \"You can lay the whole trouble at the door of some Pornell students,\" returned Pepper. \"They pelted us with soft apples and other things and that started the team to running away. If it hadn't been for them we would have come to the school in the carryall all safe and sound.\"  \"I shall investigate,\" answered Captain Putnam, briefly.  \"Hello!\" cried Pepper, a moment later. He was gazing at Andy's clothing. \"Weren't you wearing a watch and a stickpin?\"  \"Of course,\" replied the sufferer. He put up his hands and felt around. \"Both gone, I declare!\"  \"Did they jounce off when you were riding?\" asked Stuffer.  \"They must have! Oh, this is the worst yet!\"  \"Did you lose anything else?\" questioned the young quartermaster.  \"I don't know.\" Andy felt in his pockets. \"Yes, my money is gone--eight dollars in bills!\"  \"Where did you have the bills?\" asked Captain Putnam.  \"In this vest-pocket. It must have jounced out during the hard riding. Oh, what luck! Captain, I'll have to go back and look for my property.\"  \"You are in no condition, Snow, to do that.\"  \"I'll go back,\" said Pepper. \"Stuffer and Bob, will you go along?\"  \"Sure thing!\" cried Stuffer.  \"And if we can't find your things where you fell we'll look along the road all the way back to the Hall,\" added the young quartermaster.  \"Thank you,\" answered Andy, and then, feeling a curious fainting spell coming over him, he laid back on the cushions and closed his eyes.  The three cadets sprang from the carriage and made their way back to the spot where Andy had been found. They made a thorough search, but, of course, failed to find any of the acrobatic youth's belongings.  \"He must have lost them farther back,\" said Pepper. \"Let us look with care as we walk along.\"  This they did, but arrived at the school without finding anything but a coat-button and a yellow lead pencil. Then they walked past the school in the direction of Cedarville.  \"Might as well give it up,\" said Bob. \"It's getting too dark to see very good, anyway.\"  \"Yes, and I'm getting dead hungry,\" added Stuffer.  \"Was there ever a time when you weren't hungry?\" asked Pepper, with a grin.  \"Aw, now, quit it,\" cried the lad who had a reputation as an eater. \"Don't start so early in the term.\"  \"I must confess I'm a bit hungry myself,\" said the young quartermaster. \"I had an early dinner.\"  When they got back to the school they learned that Andy had been put to bed and that a doctor had been summoned. The acrobatic youth had been much shaken up and it was thought best to make him keep quiet for a few days.  \"Better not say anything about his loss for the present,\" advised Captain Putnam. \"I will have a man sent out to make another search.\"  The accidents to Andy and to Major Jack put something of a damper on the arrival for the term, and a jollification that had been scheduled for that night was indefinitely postponed. Captain Putnam questioned the cadets concerning the actions of Roy Bock and his cronies, and then sent a stiff letter to the head of Pornell Academy.  When Reff Ritter heard about the accidents he shrugged his shoulders and tossed his head.  \"That's what they get for crowding us out of the carryall,\" he said to Coulter and Paxton, who roomed with him.  \"Yes, and it serves 'em right,\" grumbled Coulter.  \"That's what!\" chimed in Paxton.     CHAPTER V  THE FIGHT IN THE GYMNASIUM   It was not until two days later that Andy Snow felt like himself again. No bones had been broken, but the acrobatic youth had received a shaking up that was severe.  So far he had not been told of his loss, and when he asked for his belongings he was much depressed by the news.  \"Couldn't find them anywhere?\" he repeated, to Pepper. \"Oh, are you sure you made a good search?\"  \"We certainly did, Andy,\" returned Pepper. \"We went back the next day, early in the morning.\"  \"And you didn't find a thing?\"  \"Only this button and lead pencil, and this buckle.\"  \"The pencil is mine, but not the button and the buckle.\" Andy heaved a sigh. \"Then I am out my watch and chain, the stickpin, and eight dollars! Was there ever such luck!\"  \"Andy, was anybody near you when you had the tumble?\" asked Pepper.  \"Near me? Why, yes, there was a man on the road just ahead of me! I had forgotten all about it until now.\"  \"Who was he?\"  \"I don't know. A tall fellow, with a thin, leathery face.\"  \"A farmer?\"  \"No, he looked more like a city man. He had on a regular sack suit and a derby hat.\"  \"I was thinking that possibly somebody robbed you while you were unconscious.\"  \"Perhaps that is so, Pep. I'd like to see that man.\"  \"You never saw him before?\"  \"Not that I can remember.\"  \"Would you know him if you saw him again?  \"I don't know about that. I didn't have much time to look at him. I was busy trying to escape being hit by the tree branches.\"  \"You must have been lying on the road five or ten minutes before we found you,\" pursued Pepper. \"If that stranger was a rascal he would have had plenty of time to go through your pockets. I don't see how riding could make you lose all those things at once.\"  \"If he robbed me, I'd like to get hold of him,\" cried Andy.  \"More than likely, if he did rob you, he'll take good care to keep out of your reach.\"  \"What of the horse? Did they catch him?\"  \"Not yet. Most likely he left the road after he got tired of running and wandered into the woods. He was a valuable animal and Captain Putnam is worried about him.\"  \"Will he hold me for that loss?\"  \"I don't think so--you didn't run away with him--he ran away with you.\"  The report of the loss of Andy's valuables was thoroughly circulated around Putnam Hall and Cedarville, and a reward of ten dollars for the return of the things was posted.  The next day a farmer named John Lane, who lived not far from the school, appeared there, riding on the back of the runaway Jim. The horse looked much subdued and was covered with burrs.  \"I was out in the woods with my son Bill, when we ran across the horse,\" explained John Lane. \"I knew him right away as the animal that had belonged to Jerry Toller. I asked Jerry about it and he said he had sold the horse to you, so I brought him here.\"  \"You are very kind, Mr. Lane,\" replied Captain Putnam. \"I'd like to pay you for your trouble.\"  \"Oh, that's all right, Captain Putnam,\" responded the farmer. \"Glad to do you a good turn.\"  \"Thank you very much. Any time I can do you a good turn, let me know.\"  \"Well, you might buy some of my extra hay, and extra potatoes. I've got some prime hay, and"]]]
