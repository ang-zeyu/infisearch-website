He took a diligent part in the preparations for the voyage of skipper De Vlamingh: \"We are having the vessels manned mainly with unmarried and resolute sailors; I have directed a draughtsman to join the expedition that whatever strange or rare things they meet with, may be accurately depicted\". And Witsen anxiously awaited the outcome of De Vlamingh's expedition. He was disappointed by the results: the commander had indeed \"surveyed and made soundings on the coasts, but had made few landings.\" At the same time Manager Witsen mentions not without some satisfaction the results of this voyage, meagre though they may be in his eyes, in letters to friends both at home and abroad, imparting to them what he has learned on the subject [**]. A few years later, however, he bitterly complains of the indifference of many of his countrymen in those days: \"What does Your Worship care about curious learning from India,\" he grumbles in a letter to one of his friends [***] \"no, sir, it is money only, not learned knowledge that our people go out to seek over there, the which is sorely to be regretted.\"  [* _Resolution of the \"Heeren XVII\", August 25, 1692; see also p. 60 infra._]  [** As regards this see J F GEBHARD _Het leven van Witsen_ I., pp. 480 f.: II. pp. 260 f.

But his name is indissolubly bound up with the palmy days of Dutch discovery in the Far East, initiated by the East India Company.  Fortunately, in our time Holland again bears a part in what is done by cultured Europe for the scientific exploration of the unknown regions of the world. In this field of inquiry the nineteenth century has again beheld her sons take a place which the achievements of their forefathers have as it were by right of inheritance assigned to them.  * * * * * * * *  {Page 1}    DOCUMENTS.
