Her fellow workers gathered raand    An caught her as shoo fell, An' as her heead droop'd o' ther arms,    Shoo sighed a sad \"farewell. Poor lass! her love had proved untrue,    He'd play'd a traitor's part, He'd taen another for his bride,    An' broke a trustin heart.\"  Her doleful story sooin wor known,    An' monny a tear wor shed; They took her hooam an' had her laid,    Upon her humble bed; Shoo'd nawther kith nor kin to come    Her burial fees to pay; But some poor comrade's undertuk,    To see her put away.  Each gave what little helps they could,    From aat ther scanty stoor; I' hopes 'at some at roll'd i' wealth    Wod give a trifle moor. But th' maisters ordered 'em away,    Abaat ther business, sharp! For shoo'd deed withaat a nooatice,    An' shoo hadn't fell'd her warp.     To a Daisy,  Found blooming March 7th.  A'a awm feeared tha's come too sooin,    Little daisy! Pray, whativer wor ta doin?    Are ta crazy? Winter winds are blowin' yet, Tha'll be starved, mi little pet.  Did a gleam'o' sunshine warm thee,    An deceive thee? Niver let appearance charm thee,    For believe me, Smiles tha'll find are oft but snares, Laid to catch thee unawares.  Still aw think it luks a shame,    To tawk sich stuff; Aw've lost faith, an tha'll do th' same,    Hi, sooin enuff: If tha'rt happy as tha art Trustin' must be th' wisest part.  Come, aw'll pile some bits o' stooan,    Raand thi dwellin'; They may screen thee when aw've gooan    Ther's no tellin'; An' when gentle spring draws near Aw'll release thee, niver fear.  An' if then thi pratty face,    Greets me smilin'; Aw may come an' sit bith' place,    Time beguilin'; Glad to think aw'd paar to be, Ov some use, if but to thee.     A Bad Sooart.  Aw'd raythur face a redwut brick, Sent flyin' at mi heead; Aw'd raythur track a madman's steps, Whearivei they may leead; Aw'd raythur ventur in a den, An' stail a lion's cub: Aw'd raythur risk the foamin wave In an old leaky tub; Aw'd raythur stand i'th' midst o'th fray, Whear bullets thickest shower; Nor trust a mean, black hearted man, At's th' luck to be i' power.  A redwut brick may miss its mark, A madman change his whim; A lion may forgive a theft; A leaky tub may swim; Bullets may pass yo harmless by, An' leave all safe at last; A thaasand thunders shake the sky, An' spare yo when they've past; Yo' may o'ercome mooast fell disease; Make poverty yo'r friend; But wi' a mean, blackhearted man, Noa mortal can contend.  Ther's malice in his kindest smile, His proffered hand's a snare; He's plannin deepest villany, When seemingly mooast fair; He leads yo' on wi' oily tongue, Swears he's yo're fastest friend. He get's yo' once within his coils, An' crushes yo' ith' end. Old Nick, we're tell'd, gooas prowlin' aat, An' seeks whom to devour; But he's a saint, compared to some, 'At's th' luk to be i' power.     All we Had.  It worn't for her winnin ways,    Nor for her bonny face But shoo wor th' only lass we had,    An that quite alters th' case.  We'd two fine lads as yo need see,    An' weel we love 'em still; But shoo war th' only lass we had,    An' we could spare her ill.  We call'd her bi mi mother's name,    It saanded sweet to me; We little thowt ha varry sooin    Awr pet wod have to dee.  Aw used to watch her ivery day,    Just like a oppenin bud; An' if aw couldn't see her change,    Aw fancied' at aw could.  Throo morn to neet her little tongue    Wor allus on a stir; Awve heeard a deeal o' childer lisp,    But nooan at lispt like her.  Sho used to play all sooarts o' tricks,    'At childer shouldn't play; But then, they wor soa nicely done,    We let her have her way.  But bit bi bit her spirits fell,    Her face grew pale an' thin; For all her little fav'rite toys    Shoo didn't care a pin.  Aw saw th' old wimmin shak ther heeads,    Wi monny a doleful nod; Aw knew they thowt shoo'd goa, but still    Aw couldn't think shoo wod.  Day after day my wife an' me,    Bent o'er that suff'rin child, Shoo luk'd at mammy, an' at me,    Then shut her een an' smiled.  At last her spirit pass'd away;    Her once breet een wor dim; Shoo'd heeard her Maker whisper 'come,'    An' hurried off to Him.  Fowk tell'd us t'wor a sin to grieve,    For God's will must be best; But when yo've lost a child yo've loved,    It puts yor Faith to th' test.  We pick'd a little bit o' graand,    Whear grass and daisies grew, An' trees wi spreeadin boughs aboon    Ther solemn shadows threw.  We saw her laid to rest, within    That deep grave newly made; Wol th' sexton let a tear drop fall,    On th' handle ov his spade.  It troubled us to walk away,    An' leeav her bi hersen; Th' full weight o' what we'd had to bide,    We'd niver felt till then.  But th' hardest task wor yet to come,    That pang can ne'er be towld; 'Twor when aw feszend th' door at nee't,    An' locked her aat i'th' cowld.  'Twor then hot tears roll'd daan mi cheek,    'Twor then aw felt mooast sad; For shoo'd been sich a tender plant,    An' th' only lass we had.  But nah we're growin moor resign'd,    Although her face we miss; For He's blest us wi another,    An we've hopes o' rearin this,     Give it 'em Hot.  Give it 'em hot, an be hanged to ther feelins!    Souls may be lost wol yor choosin' yor words! Out wi' them doctrines 'at taich o' fair dealins!    Daan wi' a vice tho' it may be a lord's! What does it matter if truth be unpleasant?    Are we to lie a man's pride to exalt! Why should a prince be excused, when a peasant    Is bullied an' blamed for a mich smaller fault?  O, ther's too mich o' that sneakin and bendin;    An honest man still should be fearless and bold; But at this day fowk seem to be feeared ov offendin,    An' they'll bow to a cauf if it's nobbut o' gold. Give me a crust tho' it's dry, an' a hard 'en,    If aw know it's my own aw can ait it wi' glee; Aw'd rayther bith hauf work all th' day for a farden,    Nor haddle a fortun wi' bendin' mi knee.  Let ivery man by his merit be tested,    Net by his pocket or th' clooas on his back; Let hypocrites all o' ther clooaks be divested,    An' what they're entitled to, that let em tak. Give it 'em hot! but remember when praichin,    All yo 'at profess others failins to tell, 'At yo'll do far moor gooid wi' yor tawkin an' taichin,    If yo set an example, an' improve yorsel.     Th' Honest Hard Worker.  It's hard what poor fowk mun put u'p wi'!    What insults an' snubs they've to tak! What bowin an' scrapin's expected,    If a chap's a black coit on his back. As if clooas made a chap ony better,    Or riches improved a man's heart, As if muck in a carriage smell'd sweeter    Nor th' same muck wod smell in a cart.  Give me one, hard workin, an' honest,    Tho' his clooas may be greasy and coorse; If it's muck 'ats been getten bi labor,    It does'nt mak th' man ony worse. Awm sick o' thease simpering dandies,    'At think coss they've getten some brass, They've a reight to luk daan at th' hard workers,    An' curl up their nooas as they pass.  It's a poor sooart o' life to be leadin,    To be curlin an' partin ther hair; An' seekin one's own fun and pleasure,    Niver thinkin ha others mun fare. It's all varry weel to be spendin    Ther time at a hunt or a ball, But if th' workers war huntin an' doncin,    Whativer wad come on us all?  Ther's summat beside fun an' frolic    To live for, aw think, if we try; Th' world owes moor to a honest hard worker    Nor it does to a rich fly-bi-sky. Tho' wealth aw acknowledge is useful,    An' awve oft felt a want on't misen, Yet th' world withaat brass could keep movin,    But it wodn't do long withaat men.  One truth they may put i' ther meersham,    An' smoke it--that is if they can; A man may mak hooshuns o' riches,    But riches can ne'er mak a man. Then give me that honest hard worker,    'At labors throo marnin to neet, Tho' his rest may be little an' seldom,    Yet th' little he gets he finds sweet.  He may rank wi' his wealthier brother,    An' rank heigher, aw fancy, nor some; For a hand 'at's weel hoofed wi' hard labor    Is a passport to th' world 'at's to come. For we know it's a sin to be idle,    As man's days i' this world are but few; Then let's all wi' awr lot 'be contented,    An' continue to toil an' to tew.  For ther's one thing we all may be sure on,    If we each do awr best wol we're here, 'At when, th' time comes for reckonin, we're called on,    We shall have varry little to fear. An' at last, when, we throw daan awr tackle,    An' are biddin farewell to life's stage, May we hear a voice whisper at partin,    \"Come on, lad! Tha's haddled thi wage;\"     Niver Heed.  Let others boast ther bit o' brass,    That's moor nor aw can do; Aw'm nobbut one o'th' working class,    'At's strugglin to pool throo; An' if it's little 'at aw get,    It's littie 'at aw need; An' if sometimes aw'm pinched a bit,    Aw try to niver heed.  Some fowk they tawk o' brokken hearts,    An' mourn ther sorry fate, Becoss they can't keep sarvent men,    An' dine off silver plate; Aw think they'd show more gradely wit    To listen to my creed, An' things they find they cannot get,    Why, try to niver heed.  Ther's some 'at lang for parks an' halls,    An' letters to ther name; But happiness despises walls,    It's nooan a child o' fame. A robe may lap a woeful chap,    Whose heart wi grief may bleed, Wol rags may rest on joyful breast,    Soa hang it! niver heed!  Th' sun shines as breet for me as them,    An' th' meadows smell as sweet, Th' larks sing as sweetly o'er mi heead,    An' th' flaars smile at mi feet, An' when a hard day's wark is done,    Aw ait mi humble feed, Mi appetite's a relish fun,    Soa hang it, niver heed.     Sing On.  Sing on, tha bonny burd, sing on, sing on;       Aw cannot sing; A claad hings ovver me, do what aw con       Fresh troubles spring.

Mi heart war once as full o' joy as thine,       But nah it's sad; Aw thowt all th' happiness i'th' world wor mine,       Sich faith aw had;-- But he who promised aw should be his wife Has robb'd me o' mi ivery joy i' life. Sing on: tha cannot cheer me wi' thi song;       Yet, when aw hear Thi warblin' voice, 'at rings soa sweet an' strong,       Aw feel a tear Roll daan mi cheek, 'at gives mi heart relief, A gleam o' comfort, but it's varry brief. This little darlin', cuddled to mi breast,       It little knows, When snoozlin' soa quietly at rest,       'At all mi woes Are smothered thear, an' mi poor heart ud braik But just aw live for mi wee laddie's sake. Sing on; an' if tha e'er should chonce to see       That faithless swain, Whose falsehood has caused all mi misery,       Strike up thy strain, An' if his heart yet answers to thy trill Fly back to me, an' aw will love him still. But if he heeds thee not, then shall aw feel       All hope is o'er, An' he that aw believed an' loved soa weel       Be loved noa more; For that hard heart, bird music cannot move, Is far too cold a dwellin'-place for love.     What aw Want.  Gie me a little humble cot,    A bit o' garden graand, Set in some quiet an' sheltered spot,    Wi' hills an' trees all raand;  An' if besides mi hooam ther flows    A little mumuring rill, At sings sweet music as it gooas,    Awst like it better still.  Gie me a wife 'at loves me weel,    An' childer two or three, Wi' health to sweeten ivery meal,    An' hearts brimful o' glee.  Gie me a chonce, wi' honest toil    Mi efforts to engage, Gie me a maister who can smile    When forkin aght mi wage.  Gie me a friend 'at aw can trust,    'An tell mi secrets to; One tender-hearted, firm an' just,    Who sticks to what is true.  Gie me a pipe to smook at neet,    A pint o' hooam-brew'd ale, A faithful dog 'at runs to meet    Me wi a waggin tail.  A cat to purr o'th' fender rims,    To freeten th' mice away; A cosy bed to rest mi limbs    Throo neet to commin day.  Gie me all this, an' aw shall be    Content, withaat a daat, But if denied, then let me be    Content to live withaat.  For 'tisn't th' wealth one may possess    Can purchase pleasures true; For he's th' best chonce o' happiness,    Whose wants are small an' few.     What it is to be Mother.  A'a, dear! what a life has a mother!    At leeast, if they're hamper'd like me, Thro' mornin' to neet ther's some bother,    An' ther will be, aw guess, wol aw dee.  Ther's mi chap, an misen, an' six childer,    Six o'th' roughest, aw think, under th' sun, Aw'm sartin sometimes they'd bewilder    Old Joab, wol his patience wor done.  They're i' mischief i' ivery corner,    An' ther tongues they seem niver at rest; Ther's one shaatin' \"Little Jack Horner,\"    An' another \"The realms o' the blest.\"  Aw'm sure if a body's to watch 'em,    They mun have een at th' back o' ther yed; For quiet yo niver can catch 'em    Unless they're asleep an' i' bed.  For ther's somdy comes runnin to tell us    'At one on em's takken wi' fits; Or ther's two on 'em feightin for th' bellus,    An' rivin' ther clooas all i' bits.  In a mornin' they're all weshed an' tidy'd,    But bi nooin they're as black as mi shoe; To keep a lot cleean, if yo've tried it,    Yo know 'at ther's summat to do.  When my felly comes hooam to his drinkin',    Aw try to be gradely, an' straight; For when all's nice an' cleean, to mi thinkin',    He enjoys better what ther's to ait.  If aw tell him aw'm varry near finished    Wi allus been kept in a fuss, He says, as he looks up astonished,    \"Why, aw niver see owt 'at tha does.\"  But aw wonder who does all ther mendin',    Weshes th' clooas, an cleans th' winders an' flags? But for me they'd have noa spot to stand in--    They'd be lost i' ther filth an' ther rags.  But it allus wor soa, an' it will be,    A chap thinks' at a woman does nowt; But it ne'er bothers me what they tell me,    For men havn't a morsel o' thowt.  But just harken to me wol aw'm tellin'    Ha aw tew to keep ivery thing straight; An' aw'l have yo for th' judge if yor willin',    For aw want nowt but what aw think's reight.  Ov a Monday aw start o' my weshin',    An' if th' day's fine aw get um all dried; Ov a Tuesday aw fettle mi kitchen,    An' mangle, an' iron beside.  Ov a Wednesday, then aw've mi bakin';    Ov a Thursday aw reckon to brew; Ov a Friday all th' carpets want shakin',    An' aw've th' bedrooms to clean an' dust throo.  Then o'th' Setterday, after mi markets,    Stitch on buttons, an' th' stockins' to mend, Then aw've all th' Sundy clooas to luk ovver,    An' that brings a week's wark to its end.  Then o'th' Sundy ther's cooking 'em th' dinner,    It's ther only warm meal in a wick; Tho' ther's some say aw must be a sinner,    For it's paving mi way to Old Nick.  But a chap mun be like to ha' summat,    An' aw can't think it's varry far wrang, Just to cook him an' th' childer a dinner,    Tho' it may mak me rayther too thrang.  But if yor a wife an' a mother,    Yo've yor wark an' yor duties to mind; Yo mun leearn to tak nowt as a bother,    An' to yor own comforts be blind.  But still, just to seer all ther places,    When they're gethred raand th' harston at neet, Fill'd wi six roosy-red, smilin' faces;    It's nooan a despisable seet.  An, aw connot help thinkin' an' sayin',    (Tho' yo may wonder what aw can mean), 'At if single, aw sooin should be playin'    Coortin tricks, an' be weddin' agean.     What is It.  What is it maks a crusty wife Forget to scold, an' leeave off strife? What is it smoothes the rooad throo life?       It's sooap.  What is it maks a gaumless muff Grow rich, an' roll i' lots o' stuff, Woll better men can't get enough?       It's sooap.  What is it, if it worn't theear, Wod mak some fowk feel varry queer, An' put 'em: i' ther proper sphere?       It's sooap.  What is' it maks fowk wade throo th' snow, To goa to th' church, becoss they know 'At th' squire's at hooam an' sure to goa?       It's sooap.  What is it gains fowk invitations, Throo them 'at live i' lofty stations? What is it wins mooast situations?       It's sooap.  What is it men say they detest, Yet alus like that chap the best 'At gives 'em twice as mich as th' rest?       It's sooap.  What is it, when the devil sends His agents raand to work his ends, What is it gains him lots o' friends?       It's sooap.  What is it we should mooast despise, An' by its help refuse to rise, Tho' poverty's befoor awr eyes?       It's sooap.  What is it, when life's wastin' fast, When all this world's desires are past, Will prove noa use to us at last?       It's sooap.     Come thi Ways!  Bonny lassie, come thi ways,    An' let us goa together! Tho' we've met wi stormy days,    Ther'll be some sunny weather: An' if joy should spring for me,    Tha shall freely share it; An' if trouble comes to thee,    Aw can help to bear it.  Tho thi mammy says us nay,    An' thi dad's unwillin'; Wod ta have me pine away    Wi' this love 'at's killin'? Come thi ways, an' let me twine    Mi arms once moor abaght thee; Weel tha knows mi heart is thine,    Aw couldn't live withaat thee.  Ivery day an' haar 'at slips,    Some pleasure we are missin', For those bonny rooasy lips    Aw'm niver stall'd o' kissin', If men wor wise to walk life's track    Withaat sith joys to glad 'em, He must ha' made a sad mistak    'At gave a Eve to Adam.     Advice to Jenny.  Jenny, Jenny, dry thi ee,    An' dunnot luk soa sad; It grieves me varry mich to see    Tha freeats abaat yon lad; For weel tha knows, withaat a daat,    Wheariver he may be, Tho fond o' rammellin' abaat,    He's allus true to thee.  Tha'll learn mooar sense, lass, in a while,    For wisdom comes wi' time, An' if tha lives tha'll leearn to smile    At troubles sich as thine; A faithful chap is better far,    Altho' he likes to rooam, Nor one 'at does what isn't reight,    An' sits o'th' hearth at hooam.  Tha needn't think 'at wedded life    Noa disappointment brings; Tha munnot think to keep a chap    Teed to thi appron strings: Soa dry thi een, they're varry wet,    An' let thi heart be glad, For tho' tha's wed a rooamer, yet,    Tha's wed a honest lad.  Ther's mony a lady, rich an' great,    'At's sarvents at her call, Wod freely change her grand estate    For thine tha thinks soa small: For riches cannot buy content,    Soa tho' thi joys be few, Tha's one ther's nowt con stand anent,--    A heart 'at's kind an' true.  Soa when he comes luk breet an' gay,    An' meet him wi' a kiss, Tha'll find him mooar inclined to stay    Wi treatment sich as this; But if thi een luk red like that,    He'll see all's wrang at once, He'll leet his pipe, an' don his hat,    An' bolt if he's a chonce.     Ther's mich Expected.  Life's pathway is full o' deep ruts,    An' we mun tak gooid heed lest we stumble; Man is made up of \"ifs\" and of \"buts,\"    It'seems pairt ov his natur to grumble.  But if we'd anxiously tak    To makkin' things smooth as we're able, Ther'd be monny a better clooath'd back,    An' monny a better spread table.  It's a sad state o' things when a man    Connot put ony faith in his brother, An' fancies he'll chait if he can,    An' rejoice ovver th' fall ov another.  An' it's sad when yo see some 'at stand    High in social position an' power, To know at ther fortuns wor plann'd    An' built, aght o'th' wrecks o' those lower.  It's sad to see luxury rife,    An' fortuns being thowtlessly wasted; While others are wearin' aat life,    With the furst drops o' pleasure untasted.  Some in carriages rollin' away,    To a ball, or a rout, or a revel; But their chariots may bear 'em some day    Varry near to the gates ov the devil.  Oh! charity surely is rare,    Or ther'd net be soa monny neglected; For ther's lots wi enuff an' to spare,    An' from them varry mich is expected.  An' tho' in this world they've ther fill    Of its pleasures, an' wilfully blinded, Let deeath come--as surely it will--    They'll be then ov"]]]
