The man was a rising lawyer, rather a sceptic on all sorts of questions, as most of us chaps pride ourselves on being, when we come out of college. They were married in church to please the Woman. What odds did it make?  Before they were married they had decided to live outside the city. She wanted a garden and an old house. He did not care where they lived so long as they lived together. Very proper of him, too. They spent the last year of their engaged life, the nicest year of some girls' lives, I have heard--in hunting the place. What they finally settled on was an old colonial house with a colonnaded front, and a round tower at each end, standing back from the road, and approached by a wide circular drive. It was large, substantial, with great possibilities, and plenty of ground. It had been unoccupied for many years, and the place had an evil report, and, at the time when they first saw it, appeared to deserve it.  He had looked it over. The situation was healthy. It was convenient to the city. He could make it in his car in less than forty-five minutes. They saw what could be done with the place, and did not concern themselves with _why_ other people had not cared to live there. Architects, interior decorators, and landscape gardeners were put to work on it, and, even before the wedding, the place was well on toward its habitable stage.  Then they were married, and, quite correctly, went abroad to float in a gondola on the Grand Canal--together; to cross the Gemmi--together; to stroll about Pompeii and cross to Capri--together; and then ravage antiquity shops in Paris--together. They returned in the early days of a glorious September. The house was ready for its master and mistress to lay the touch of their personality on it, and put in place the trophies of their Wedding Journey.  The evil look the house once had was gone.  A few old trees had been cut down round it to let in the glorious autumn sun all over the house, and when, on their first morning, after a good sound, well-earned sleep, they took their coffee on the terrace off the breakfast room, under a yellow awning, they certainly did not think, if they ever had, of the mysterious rumors against the house which had been whispered about when they first bought it. To them it seemed that they had never seen a gayer place.  But on the second night, just as the Woman was putting her book aside, and had a hand stretched out to shut off the light, she stopped--a carriage was coming up the drive. She sat up, and listened for the bell. It did not ring. After a few moments--as there was absolutely no sound of the carriage passing--she got up, and gently pushed the shutter--her room was on the front--there was nothing there, so, attaching no importance to it, she went quietly to bed, put out her light, just noticing as she did so, that it was midnight, and went to sleep. In the morning, the incident made so little impression on her, that she forgot to even mention it.  The next night, by some queer trick of memory, just as she went to bed, the thing came back to her, and she was surprised to find that she had no sleep in her. Instead of that she kept looking at the clock, and just before twelve, cold chills began to go down her back, when she heard the rapid approach of a carriage--this time she was conscious that her hearing was so keen that she knew there were two horses. She listened intently--no doubt about it--the carriage had stopped at the door.  Then there was a silence.  She was just convincing herself that there must be some sort of echo which made it appear that a team passing in the road had come up the drive--when she was suddenly sure that she heard a hurried step in the corridor--it passed the door. Now she was naturally a very unimaginative person, and had never had occasion to know fear. So, after a bit, she put out her light, saying to herself that a belated servant was busy with some neglected work--nothing more likely--and she went to sleep.  Again the morning sunlight, the Man's gay companionship, the hundreds of delightful things to do, wiped out that bad quarter of an hour, and again it never occurred to her to mention it.  The next night the remembrance came back so vividly after the Man had gone to his room, that she regretted she had not at least asked him if he had heard a carriage pass in the night. Of course she was sure that he had not. He was such a sound sleeper. Besides, it was not important. If he had, he would not have been nervous about it. Still, she could not sleep, and, just before the dining room clock began to chime midnight--she had never heard it before, and that she heard it now was a proof of how her whole body was listening--again came the rapid tread of running horses. This time every hair stood up on her head, and before she could control herself, she called out toward the open door: \"Dearest, are you awake?\"  Almost before she had the words out he was standing smiling in the doorway. It was all right.  \"Did you _think_ you heard a carriage come up the driveway?\" she asked.  \"Why, yes,\" he replied, \"but I didn't.\"  \"Listen! Is there some one coming along the corridor?\"  He crossed the room quietly, opened the door, and turned on the light. \"No, dear. There is no one there.\"  \"Hadn't you better ring for your man, and have him see if any of the servants are up?\"  He sat down on the edge of the bed, and laughed heartily.  \"See here, dear girl,\" he said, \"you and I are a pair of healthy people. We have happened to hear a noise which we can't explain. Be sure that there is rational explanation. You're not afraid?\"  \"Well, no, I really am not,\" she declared, \"but you cannot deny that it is strange. Did you hear it last night?\"  \"Go on, now, with your cross-examination,\" he said. \"Let's go to sleep. At any rate the exhibition is over for to-night.\"  The fourth night they did not speak in the night any more than they had in the daytime. But the next day they had a long conversation, the gist of which was this: That they had bought the place, that except for fifteen minutes at midnight, the place was ideal. They were both level-headed, neither believed in anything super-natural. Were they to be driven out of such a place by so harmless a thing as an unexplained noise? They could get used to it. After a bit it would no more wake them up,--such was the force of habit--than the ticking of the clock. To all this they both agreed, and the matter was dropped.  For ten days they did not mention it, but in all those ten days a sort of crescendo of emotion was going on in her. At first she began to think of it as soon as bed-time approached; then she felt it intruding on her thoughts at the dinner table; then she was unable to sleep for an hour or two after the fifteen minutes had passed, and, finally, one night, she fled into his room to find him wide awake, just before dawn, and to confess that the shadow of midnight was stretched before and after until it was almost a black circle round the twenty-four hours.  She knew it was absurd. She had no intention of being driven out of such a lovely place--BUT--  \"See here, dear,\" he said. \"Let's break our rule. We neither of us want company, but let's, at least, have a big week ender, and perhaps we can prove to ourselves that our nerves are wrong. One thing is sure, if you are going to get pale over it, I'll burn the blooming house down before we'll live in it.\"  \"But you mind it yourself?\"  \"Not a bit!\"  \"But you are awake.\"  \"Of course I am, because I know that you are.\"  \"Do you mean to say that if I slept you wouldn't notice it?\"  \"On my honor--I should not.\"  \"You are a comfort,\" she ejaculated. \"I shall go right to sleep.\" And off she went, and did go to sleep.  All the same, in the morning, he insisted on the house-party.  \"Let me see our list,\" he said. \"Let us have no students of occult; no men who dabble in laboratory spiritualism; just nice, live, healthy people who never heard of such things--if possible. You can find them.\"  \"You see, dear,\" she explained, \"it would not trouble me if I heard it and you did not--but--\"  \"Oh, fudge!\" he laughed. \"Just now I should be sure to hear anything you did, I suppose.\"  \"You old darling,\" she replied, \"then I don't care for it a bit.\"  \"All the same we'll have the house-party.\"  So the following Saturday every room in the house was occupied.  At midnight they were all gathered in the long drawing room opening on the colonnade, and, when the hour sounded, some one was singing. The host and hostess heard the running horses, as usual, and they were conscious that one or two people turned a listening ear, but evidently no one saw anything strange in it, and no comment was made. It was after one when they all went up to their rooms, so that evening passed off all right.  But on Sunday night two of the younger guests had gone to sit on the front terrace, and the older people were walking, in the moonlight, in the garden at the back. The sweet little girl, who was having her hand held, got up properly when she heard the carriage coming, and went to the edge of the terrace to see who was arriving at midnight. She had a fit of nerves as the invisible vehicle and its running horses seemed about to ride over her. She ran in, trembling with fear, to tell the tale, and of course every one laughed at her, and the matter would have been dropped, if it had not happened that, just at that moment a very pale gentleman came stumbling out of the house with the statement that he wanted a conveyance \"to take him back to town,\" that \"he refused to sleep in a haunted house,\" that he \"had encountered an invisible person running along the corridor to his room,\" in fact the footsteps had as he put it \"passed right through him.\"  The host broke into laughter, but he took the bull by the horns--the facts, as he knew them, were safer than the tales which he knew would run over the city if he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18004"],["title","Told in a French Garden (#4)"],["body","to deny things.  \"See here, my good people,\" he said, \"there is a little mystery here that we can't explain. The truth is, there _is_ a story about this house. It used to belong to the president of a well-known railroad. That was twenty-five years ago. They say that one night, when he was driving from a place he had up country, his team was run into at a railway crossing five miles from here--one of those grade crossings that never ought to have been--and he was killed and his horses came home at midnight. 'They say' that the people who lived here after that declared that the horses have come home every midnight since. Now, there's the story. They don't do any harm. It only takes them a few minutes. They don't even trample the driveway, so why not?\"  \"All the same, I want to go back to town,\" said the frightened guest.  \"I would stay the night, if I were you,\" said the host. \"They won't come again until to-morrow.\"  All the same, when morning came, every one skipped, and as the last of them drove away, the Woman put her hand through the Man's arm, and smiled as she said: \"It's all over. I don't mind a bit. When I heard you saying last night, 'They don't even trample the driveway, so why not?' I said to myself, 'Why not?' indeed.\"  \"Good girl,\" he replied. \"I'll bet my top hat you grow to be proud of them.\"  I don't know that they ever did, but I do know that they still live there. I went to school with the son, and whenever any one bragged, he used to say, \"Well, we've _always_ had a ghost. You ain't got that!\"  The Youngster threw his lighted cigarette into the air, ran under it, caught it between his lips, and made a bow, as the Doctor broke into a roar of laughter.  \"I know that old house,\" he said. \"Jamaica Pond. But see here, Youngster, your idea of ghosts is terribly illogical. It was the _man_ who was killed, not the _horses_. The wrong part of the team walked.\"  \"You _are_ particular,\" replied the Youngster. \"The man did not come back, and the horses did. I can't split hairs when it's a ghost story. I feel afraid that I have missed my vocation, and that flights in the imagination are more in my line than flights in the air. I don't know what you think. _I_ think it's a mighty good story. I say, Journalist, do you think I could sell that story? I've never earned a dollar in my life.\"  \"Well,\" laughed the Journalist, \"a dollar is just about what you would get for it.\"  \"If I had been doing that story,\" said the Critic, \"I should have found a logical explanation for it.\"  \"Of course you would,\" said the Youngster. \"I know one of a haunted house on St. James Street which had an explanation.\"  But the Doctor cut him short with: \"Come now, you've done your stunt. No more stories to-night. Off to bed. You and I are going to take a run to Paris to-morrow.\"  \"What for?\"  \"Tell you to-morrow.\"  As every one began to move toward the house, the Violinist remarked, \"I was thinking of running up to Paris myself to-morrow. Any one else want to go with me?\" The Journalist said that he did, and the party broke up. As they strolled toward the house the Lawyer was heard asking the Youngster, \"What were the steps in the corridor?\"  \"Well,\" replied the Youngster, \"I suppose on the night that the team came home there must have been great excitement in the house--every one running to and fro and--\"  But the Journalist's shout of laughter stopped him.  The Youngster eyed him with shocked surprise.  \"By Jupiter!\" cried the Journalist. \"That is the darnedest ghost story I ever heard. Everything and everybody walked but the dead man--even the carriage.\"  \"That isn't _my_ fault,\" said the Youngster, indignantly.     II  THE TRAINED NURSE'S STORY  THE SON OF JOSEPHINE  THE TALE OF A FOUNDLING   The house was very quiet next day. All the men, except the Critic and the Sculptor, had made an early and hurried run to Paris. So we saw little of each other until we gathered for dinner, and the conversation was calm--in fact subdued.  The Doctor was especially quiet. No one was really gay except the Youngster. He talked of what he had seen in Paris--the silent streets--the moods of the women--the sight of officers in khaki flying about in big touring cars--and no one asked what had really taken them to town.  The Trained Nurse and I had walked to the nearest village, but we brought back little in the way of news. The only interesting thing we saw was _Monsieur le Curé_ talking to a handsome young peasant woman in the square before the church. We heard her say, with a sob in her throat, \"If my man does not come back, I'll never say my prayers again. I'll never pray to a God who let this thing happen unless my man comes back.\"  \"She will, just the same,\" said the Lawyer. \"One of the strangest features of such a catastrophe is that it steadies a race, especially the race convinced that it has right on its side.\"  \"It goes deeper than that,\" said the Journalist. \"It strikes millions with the same pain, and they bear together what they could not have faced separately.\"  \"True,\" remarked the Doctor, \"and that is one reason why I have always mistrusted the effort of people outside the radius of disaster to help in anyway, except scientifically.\"  \"That is rather a cruel idea,\" commented the Trained Nurse.  \"Perhaps. But I believe organized charity even of that sort is usually ineffective, and weakens the race that accepts it. I believe victims of such disaster are healthier and come out stronger for facing it, dying, or surviving, as Fate decrees.\"  \"Keep off the grass,\" cried the Youngster. \"I brought back a car full of books.\" The hint was taken, and we talked of books until the coffee came out.  As usual, the Trained Nurse sat behind the pot, and when we were all served, she pushed the tray back, folded her strong capable white hands on the edge of the table, and said quietly:  \"_Messieurs et Mesdames_\"--  We lit our cigarettes, and she began:         *       *       *       *       *  It was the first year after I left home and took up nursing. I had a room at that time in one of the Friendly Society refuges on the lower side of Beacon Hill. It was under the auspices of an Episcopal High Church in the days of Father Hall, and was rather English in tone. Indeed its matron was an Englishwoman--gentle, round-faced, lace-capped, and very sympathetic. I was very fond of her. I had, as a seamstress, a neat little girl named Josephine.  Josephine was a tiny creature, all grey in tone, with mouse-colored hair. She was a foundling. She had not the least notion who her people were. Her first recollections were of the orphan asylum where she was brought up. In her early teens she had been bound out to a dressmaker, who had been kind to her, and, when her first employer died, Josephine, who had saved a little money, and longed for independence, began to go out as a seamstress among the women she had grown to know in the dressmaking establishment, and went to live at one of the Christian Association homes for working girls.  Every one knows what those boarding houses are--two or three hundred girls of all ages, from sixteen up, of all temperaments. All girls willing to submit to control; girls with their gay days and their tragic, girls of ambition, and girls with faith in the future, as well as girls of no luck, and girls with their simple youthful romances.  Every one loved Josephine.  She was by nature a little lady, dainty in her ways, industrious, unrebellious, always ready to help the other girls about their clothes, and a model of a confidant. Every one told her their little troubles, every one confided their little romances. They were sure of a good listener, who never had any troubles or romances of her own to confide.  I don't know how old Josephine was at that time. She might have been twenty-five, looked younger, but was perhaps older. She was so tiny, and such a mouse of a thing that she seemed a child, but for her energy, and her capacity for silence.  It was, I fancy, three years after I first knew her that she one evening confided to a group of her intimate friends, as they sat together over their sewing, that she was engaged to be married. There was a great excitement. Little lonely Josephine, so discreet, who had sympathized with the romances of so many of her comrades, had a romance of her own. Such a hugging and kissing as went on, you never saw, unless you have seen a crowd of such girls together. Every one was full of questions, and there were almost as many tears shed as questions asked.  He was a carpenter, Josephine told them. She had known him ever since she was with the dressmaker who took her out of the asylum. He lived in Utica, New York. He had a good job, and they were to be married as soon as she could get ready.  So Josephine set to work with her nimble fingers to make her trousseau. During the years she had worked for me, the Matron at the Friendly Society, and many of its patrons had come to know and love dear little Josephine, and in our house there was almost as much excitement over the news as there was at the Association at the South End. All the girls set to work to make something for little Josephine. Every one for whom she had worked gave her something. One lady gave her black silk for a frock. All the girls sewed a bit of underwear for her. She had sheets and table linen, and all sorts of dainty things which her girl friends loved to count over, and admire in the evening without the least bit of envy. By the time Spring came Josephine had to buy a new trunk to pack her things away in.  Then she told us all that she was going to Utica to be married. What was the use of his spending his money to come east for her, and pay his expenses back? That seemed reasonable, and the day was fixed for her departure.  Her trunks were packed.  She took a night train so that we could all go to the station to see her off, and I am sure that the crowd who saw us kissing her good-bye are not likely to forget the scene.  Then "]]]
