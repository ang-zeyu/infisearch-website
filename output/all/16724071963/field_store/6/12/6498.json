The _bat_ which is found as a mythological figure on pottery vessels and inscriptions from the Maya region (compare Seler, Zeitschrift f√ºr Ethnologie, 1894, p. 577) does not occur in the manuscripts. It is true, however, that hieroglyphic signs, which seem to relate to the head of the bat, occur in isolated cases in the manuscripts.     SUMMARY.   An enumeration of the most important deities in the manuscripts gives the following results, in connection with which it is to be noted that, of course, the numbers cannot be absolutely correct, because one or another of the pictures occasionally remains doubtful. As far as possible, however, only the _positively_ determined representations have been considered.  The deity occurring most frequently in the DRESDEN MANUSCRIPT is god B, who is pictured there 141 times. Following him in point of number in the same manuscript are the death-god A pictured 33 times, god D 19 times, and gods C and E 17 and 14 times respectively.  In the MADRID MANUSCRIPT, god D, with 84 pictures, is of most frequent occurrence. He is followed by the maize-god E with 76 pictures, god B with 71, god A with 53, C with 38 and M with 37 pictures.  In the PARIS MANUSCRIPT, god E's picture can be verified 8 times, those of C and B 6 times each and that of god A twice; N and K are also frequently represented.  An enumeration of all the pictures in all the manuscripts shows that the following deities occur most frequently and are therefore to be considered the most important:    1.  God B: pictured 218 times.   2.   \"  D:  \"       103  \"   3.   \"  E:  \"        98  \"   4.   \"  A:  \"        88  \"   5.   \"  C:  \"        61  \"   6.   \"  M:  \"        40  \"   7.   \"  F:  \"        33  \"  Furthermore, interesting conclusions can be arrived at, by means of a list of those deities, who occur in the representations of the manuscripts, so _united_ or _grouped together_ as to make it evident that they must stand in some relation to one another. _Mythologic combinations_ of this kind occur among the following deities and mythological animals:  1. In the DRESDEN MANUSCRIPT: D and C, B and C, dog and vulture, bird and serpent, B and K.  2. In the MADRID MANUSCRIPT: F and M, B and M, C and M, E and M, A and E, A and D, A and F, B and C, D and C, D and E.  3. In the PARIS MANUSCRIPT: N and K, B and K.  The most common of these combinations are those of the deities A and F, M and F, A and E, D and C. These groups are entirely intelligible, consisting of death-god and war-god, god of the travelling merchants and war-god, death-god and maize-god (as adversaries: meaning famine), night-god and deity of the polar star.

The war will make a great difference to our income, and we can't--simply _can't_--go on living in exactly the old way. The sooner we all realize it the better. I wish I knew where to begin.\"  \"Might knock off going to church, and save the money we give in collections!\" suggested Percy flippantly. \"It must tot up to quite a decent sum in the course of a year, not to mention pew rent!\"  His mother cast a reproachful glance at him.  \"Now, Percy, _do_ be serious for once! You and Winona are quite old enough to understand business matters. I must discuss them with somebody. As I said before, we shall really have to economize somehow, and the question is where to begin.\"  \"I saw some hints in a magazine the other day,\" volunteered Winona, hunting among a pile of papers, and fishing up a copy of _The Housewife's Journal_. \"Here you are! There's a whole article on War Economies. It says you can halve your expenses if you only try. It gives ten different recipes. Number One, Dispense with Servants. Oh, goody! I don't know how the house would get along without Maggie and Mary! Isn't that rather stiff?\"  \"It's impossible to be thought of for a moment! I should never dream of dismissing maids who have lived with me for years. I've read that article, and it may be practicable for other people, but certainly not for us. Oh, dear! Some of my friends recommend me to remove to the town, and others say 'Stay where you are, and keep poultry!'\"  \"We can't leave Highfield! We were all born here!\" objected Winona decisively.  \"And we tried keeping hens some time ago,\" said Percy. \"They laid on an average three-quarters of an egg a year each, as far as I remember.\"  \"I'm afraid we didn't know how to manage them,\" replied Mrs. Woodward fretfully. \"Percy, leave those papers alone! I didn't tell you to turn them over. You're mixing them all up, tiresome boy! Don't touch them again! It's no use trying to discuss business with you children! I shall write and consult Aunt Harriet. Go away, both of you, now! I want to have a quiet half-hour.\"  Aunt Harriet stood to the Woodward family somewhat in the light of a Delphic oracle. To apply to her was always the very last resource. Matters must have reached a crisis, Winona thought, if they were obliged to appeal to Aunt Harriet's judgment. She followed Percy into the garden with a sober look on her face.  \"You don't think mother would really leave Highfield?\" she asked her brother anxiously.  \"Bunkum!\" replied that light-hearted youth. \"We always have more or less of a fuss when my school bills come in. It'll soon fizzle out again! Don't you fret yourself. Things will jog on as they always have jogged on. There'll be nothing done, you'll see. Come on and bowl for me, that's a chubby one!\"  \"But this time mother really seemed to be in earnest,\" said Winona meditatively, as she helped to put up the stumps.  Mrs. Woodward had been left a widow three years before this story opens. She was a fair, fragile little woman, still pretty, and pathetically helpless. She had been accustomed to lean upon her husband, and now, for lack of firmer support, she leaned upon Winona. Winona was young to act as prop, and though it flattered her sense of importance, it had put a row of wrinkles on her girlish forehead. At fifteen she seemed much older than Percy at sixteen. No one ever dreamt of taking Percy seriously; he was one of those jolly, easy-going, happy-go-lucky, unreliable people who saunter through life with no other aim than to amuse themselves at all costs. To depend upon him was like trusting to a boat without a bottom. Though nominally the eldest, he had little more sense of responsibility than Ernie, the youngest. It was Winona who shouldered the family burdens.  The Woodwards had always lived at Highfield, and in their opinion it was the most desirable residence in the whole of Rytonshire. The house was old enough to be picturesque, but modern enough for comfort. Its quaint gables, mullioned windows and Cromwellian porch were the joy of photographers, while the old-fashioned hall, when the big log fire was lighted, would be hard to beat for coziness. The schoolroom, on the ground floor, had a separate side entrance on to the lawn, leading through a small ante-room where boots and coats and cricket bats and tennis rackets could be kept; the drawing-room had a luxurious ingle nook with cushioned seats, and all the bedrooms but two had a southern aspect. As for the big rambling garden, it was full of delightful old-world flowers that came up year after year: daffodils and violets and snow-flakes, and clumps of pinks, and orange lilies and Canterbury bells, and tall Michaelmas daisies, and ribbon grass and royal Osmunda fern, the sort of flowers that people used to pick in days gone by, put a paper frill round, and call a nosegay or a posy. There was a lawn for tennis and cricket, a pond planted with irises and bulrushes, and a wild corner where crocuses and coltsfoot and golden aconite came up as they liked in the spring time.  Winona loved this garden with somewhat the same attachment that a French peasant bears for the soil upon which he has been reared. She rejoiced in every yard of it. To go away and resign it to others would be tragedy unspeakable. The fear that Aunt Harriet might recommend the family to leave Highfield was sufficient to darken her horizon indefinitely. That her mother had written to consult the oracle she was well aware, for she had been sent to post the letter. She had an instinctive apprehension that the answer would prove a turning-point in her career.  For a day or two everything went on as usual. Mrs. Woodward did not again allude to her difficulties, Percy had conveniently forgotten them, and the younger children were not aware of their existence. Winona lived with a black spot dancing before her mental eyes. It was continually rising up and blotting out the sunshine. On the fourth morning appeared a letter addressed in an old-fashioned slanting handwriting, and bearing the Seaton post mark. Mrs. Woodward read it in silence, and left her toast unfinished. Aunt Harriet's communications generally upset her for the day.  \"Come here, Winona,\" she said agitatedly, after breakfast. \"Oh, dear, I wish I knew what to do! It's so very unexpected, but of course it would be a splendid thing for you. If only I could consult somebody! I suppose girls nowadays will have to learn to support themselves, and the war will alter everything, but I'd always meant you to stop at home and look after the little ones for me, and it's very--\"  \"What does Aunt Harriet say, mother?\" interrupted Winona, with a catch in her throat.  \"She says a great deal, and I dare say she's right. Oh, this terrible war! Things were so different when I was a girl! You might as well read the letter for yourself, as it concerns you. I always think she's hard on Percy, poor lad! I was afraid the children were too noisy the last time she was here, but they wouldn't keep quiet. I'm sure I try to do my best all round, and you know, Winona, how I said Aunt Harriet--\"  But Winona was already devouring the letter.                                           \"10 Abbey Close,                                                    \"Seaton,                                                      \"August 26th.          \"MY DEAR FLORITA,--You are quite right to consult me         in your difficulties, and are welcome to any advice which I am         able to offer you. I am sorry to hear of your financial         embarrassments, but I am not surprised. The present increase in         the cost of living, and extra taxation, will make retrenchments         necessary to everybody. In the circumstances I should not advise         you to leave Highfield. (\"Oh, thank goodness!\" ejaculated         Winona.) The expense of a removal would probably cancel what you         would otherwise save. Neither should I recommend you to take         Percy from Longworth College and send him daily to be coached by         your parish curate. From my knowledge of his character I         consider the discipline of a public school to be indispensable         if he is to grow into worthy manhood, and sooner than allow the   "]]]
