My goose must have known there was going to be a reunion of the Goose and Christmas families! She was so obliging as to lay another egg in honor of the occasion. You shall have it, Father Christmas, and may good luck go with it. (_Hands egg._)  _Father Christmas_: Thank you, Jack. That's a present worth having! I wish my son Santa Claus had as fine a gift to put in every poor body's stocking. He is out on his rounds now, but expects to be back, as he said, \"before the fun begins.\"  _Jack_: Santa's always ready for fun!  _Mother Goose (taking Jack's hand, as he stands beside her_):    \"This, my son Jack,   Is a smart-looking lad;   He is not very good,   Nor yet very bad.\" _(Sound of voices outside_.)  _Jack_: Dear me, mother! I can't stir without those young ones following me! _(Sound of voices and knocking.)_  _Children (outside):_ Jack! Jack!  _Jack (calling):_ All right. Come in. I'm here, and Mother Goose and Father Christmas, too. Surprise us all by being good, won't you?      (Enter, two by two, Little Bo-Peep with a bundle of lamb's     wool suspended from a shepherdess crook; Little Jack Horner,     carrying carefully a deep pan covered with paper pie crust;     Little Miss Muffett, carrying a bowl and spoon; Peter Pumpkin     Eater, with a pumpkin under his arm; Curly Locks, with a     piece of needlework; Little Boy Blue, with a Christmas horn;     Contrary Mary, with a string of bells for bracelets, and     carrying shells; Little Tommy Tucker, with a sheet of music;     Jack and Jill, carrying a pail; Simple Simon, finger in mouth,     looking as idiotic as possible; Polly Flinders, in a     torn dress, sprinkled with ashes. The children march     and countermarch to music around Mother Goose and Father     Christmas, bowing as they pass them. When Mother Goose     claps her hands the children group themselves on her side of     platform, not in a stiff row, but as naturally as possible.     As one after another comes forward for his or her speech, the     others appear to be conversing among themselves, making the     by-play in keeping with their characters.)  _Mother Goose:_ Tell Father Christmas your names now, my pretty ones, and give him the presents you have brought in his honor.  _Little Bo-Peep (coming forward)_: I'm little Bo-Peep who lost her sheep. I bring you some fine lamb's wool to keep you warm, Father Christmas.  _(Father Christmas receives with a gracious air this gift and those that follow, handing them afterward to Jack Goose, who puts them into a large box or basket previously provided for the purpose.)_  _Jack Horner:_ I'm little Jack Horner who sat in a corner, eating a Christmas pie. I've brought you one just like it, Father Christmas. This pie is full of plums, and I haven't put in my thumb to pull out one! (_Goes back to place after handing pie_.)  _Miss Muffet_: I'm little Miss Muffet, sir. I sat on a tuffet, eating some curds and whey; but there came a big spider, and I was frightened away. Do you like curds and whey, Father Christmas? I hope so, for here are some in a bowl. (_Hands gift, and returns to place_.)  _Peter Pumpkin Eater_: Here come I, Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater. But I've saved a nice pumpkin for _you_, Father Christmas, and here it is. (_Returns to place_.)  _Curly Locks_: Just little Curly Locks who sits on a cushion and sews a fine seam, and feeds upon strawberries, sugar, and cream! Here's some of my sewing, Father Christmas. (_Presents needlework, and returns to place_.)  _Little Boy Blue_ (_blowing several blasts on his horn as he comes forward_): Here's Little Boy Blue! I blow my horn when sheep's in the meadow and cow's in the corn. I've brought you my very best horn for a present, Father Christmas. It's a good one, I can tell you! (_Blows again, and hands to Father Christmas, who smilingly tries the horn before handing on to Jack_.)  _Contrary Mary_: \"Mary, Mary, quite contrary,\" they call me, Father Christmas. I'm not contrary at all. Don't you believe it. Only I _don't_ like to do just the same as other folks. That's the reason I'm not going to give you one of my silver bells or my pretty shells. I'll keep them myself for the present. Perhaps when it's Fourth of July, or some other time when nobody else is thinking about giving you anything, you'll hear from Contrary Mary. (_Flounces herself away to place_.)  _Mother Goose_: Fie, fie, my child! Give your presents to Father Christmas as you should. This contrariness grows upon you apace, and must be checked at once. _(Mary obeys Mother Goose reluctantly, pouting and muttering to herself.)_  _Little Tommy Tucker_: I am only little Tommy Tucker who sings for his supper. All I can give you is a song, Father Christmas.    TOMMY TUCKER'S SONG.    (Air: \"Ben Bolt.\")    Oh, don't you remember when children were old,     And money grew up on the trees,   How we lived upon nothing but cake and ice-cream.     And had none but our own selves to please?   We went to bed late every night of our lives,     And we played every day all day long;   And we never did sums, and could spell anyhow,     And nobody said it was wrong!    Oh, don't you remember the naughty child grew,     The good one was good all in vain,   Till dear Father Christmas and Mother Goose, too,     To children their duty made plain?   So now we can cipher and spell with a will,     And at nine we are snug in our beds,   With good Father Christmas in all of our dreams,     And Mother Goose songs in our heads!  _Father Christmas_: Bravo, Tom Tucker! Be sure you shall have the supper for which you have sung so well. Bless my eyes! Who comes here?  _Jack and Jill (together):_ We are Jack and Jill, Father Christmas. And here's a pail for you. It is the one that we had when \"Jack fell down and broke his crown, and Jill came tumbling after.\" _(Hands a pail_.)  _Simple Simon (drawling):_ Simple Simon, I am. I met a pieman going to the fair. Says Simple Simon to the pieman, \"Let me taste your fare.\" Says the pieman to Simple Simon, \"Show me first your penny.\" Says Simple Simon to the pieman, \"Indeed, I have not any.\"  _Father Christmas_: So you did not get the pie? My boy, let it be a lesson to you that in this world nobody can have something for nothing.  _Polly Flinders (sobbing):_ I don't look fit to come to a party, Father Christmas, for I burnt my best dress sitting among the cinders. Please excuse me this time, and let me stay, though I have no gift.  _Father Christmas_: Certainly, my dear, certainly.  _Mother Goose (severely}:_ You are entirely too indulgent, Father Christmas! Polly Flinders, who sat among the cinders, ought to have stayed at home. _(Polly begins to cry.)_  _Father Christmas_: Oh, we must overlook her appearance this time, Mother Goose. Christmas is no time for tears. Go back among your brothers and sisters. Polly. Mother Goose and I will let you stay, but don't sit again among the cinders, Polly Flinders!      (Sound of singing outside. Children of All Nations enter,     waving: flags. At the conclusion of their song they stand in a     semi-circle behind Father Christmas and Mother Goose.)    SONG OF ALL NATIONS.    (Air--: \"Upidee,\" page 68, Franklin Sq. Coll No. 1.)    Dear Father Christmas, you we greet,     Tra la la, tra la la,   And Mother Goose, his friend so meet,     Tra la la, la la.   From every nation on the earth   We hail you both with Christmas mirth.    _Chorus_.--Merry, merry Christmas, all.     Christmas gay, happy day!   Merry, merry Christmas, all!     Merry Christmas day!      (Pointing to Mother Goose and Father Christmas.)    \"The Children's Friends\" their name is known,     Tra la la, tra la la;   Oh, long may they that title own,     Tra la la, la la.   Wherever in the whole wide world   The flag of childhood is unfurled.--_Cho_.      (Taking places.)    Above our two most loving friends,     Tra la la, tra la la,   The banner of each nation bends,     Tra la la, la la.   Hurrah for Father Christmas dear!   And also Mother Goose we'll cheer!--_Cho_.      (Enter Thanksgiving, carrying a basket of fruit, and     accompanied by her children, Peace and Plenty.)  _Father Christmas_: Why, here's my dear niece Thanksgiving, with her two fine youngsters, Peace and Plenty! Thanksgiving, my dear, permit me to present you to Mother Goose, her son Jack, and all the rest of her family. _(Mutual recognitions.}_ Also, to the Children of All Nations. _(Bows.)_  _Thanksgiving_:    With Peace and with Plenty, my children, I bring   To good Father Christmas our small offering. _(Presents basket.)_  _Peace and Plenty (together):_    Long live Father Christmas and Mother Goose, too!   Their fame is world-wide, and their friends not a few.      (Thanksgiving, Peace, and Plenty now take places near Father     Christmas, while Happy New Year enters, carrying a bunch     of keys. She is accompanied by two children, Hope and Good     Resolutions.)  _Father Christmas (rising to greet her_): My dear daughter Happy New Year, we are glad to see you, with Hope and Good Resolutions looking so bright and well. Permit me to introduce my guests. _(Mutual recognitions.)_  _Happy New Year_:    With Good Resolutions quite close to my side,   And sweet little Hope with me whate'er betide,   I bring Father Christmas the bright golden keys   That will open my door '98 with ease.  _Hope and Good Resolutions (together)_: Good cheer, Mother Goose! Father Christmas, good cheer! We wish each and all of you happy New Year!      (Happy New Year and her children group themselves next to     Thanksgiving. Enter Santa Claus, bustling about and shaking     hands with everybody while speaking.)    _Santa Claus_:      What ho, Father Christmas! What ho, Mother Goose!     At last from my Christmas-eve duties I'm loose.     Not a stocking from north pole to south but I've filled,     Books, candies, and toys by each mantlepiece spilled.     My pack is quite empty, my reindeer done out,     But on Christmas"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12974"],["title","Christmas Entertainments (#7)"],["body","there'll be such a shout     From the east to the west, from the south to the north,     When their gifts from their stockings the children pull forth,     That it's worth all my trouble--that hearty good cheer,     \"Hurrah! In the night Santa Claus has been here!\"     But, folks, I am hungry, I freely confess,     So on to the dining-room now I will press.     Roast turkey and cranberry sauce and mince pie     Are there on the table, I saw passing by.    _Father Christmas_:      Now Santa has come, let the banquet be shared     That for our reunion I've ordered prepared.     To the dining-room we will adjourn, Mother Goose;            _(Takes her arm)_     Come, all the rest, follow--I'll take no excuse.     Santa Claus, lead Thanksgiving; Jack, Happy New Year;     Away now, my friends, to our good Christmas cheer!

(Dress four boys, or six, in a quaint costume,--full     knee-breeches, low shoes with bright buckles, tunic or doublet     with white frills at the throat and wrist; a short full cape     hanging from the shoulders, and soft caps with plumes. Old     garments may be re-arranged to give a picturesque effect, or     some new, inexpensive material bought. Each boy should have     a voice of pleasing quality, and be taught the Christmas song     perfectly.      Arrange a frame like a window casement at the back of the     platform a little to one side. Behind this let a light burn     dimly until a signal is given for full illumination. If     practicable, leave the rest of the stage and audience-room in     darkness.      The boys begin to sing behind closed doors, and are heard     coming nearer singing the first verse of \"On this Happy     Birthday.\" They enter and approach the centre of the platform.     The casement is thrown open and half a dozen children's heads     appear. There is a clapping of hands till the second verse is     begun by the waits. At the last line the children throw out     pennies and candies wrapped in paper. The singers scramble for     them, and then give the third verse of the carol. The fourth     verse may be sung as the boys move away and disappear in the     distance. As a preliminary to this little performance a few     words may be said about the old English custom of the waits     coming to sing under the windows on Christmas eve.)          *       *       *       *       *  =On This Happy Birthday.=  By Mrs. CHARLOTTE B.

On this happy Birthday    Of our Saviour King,   Come, dear little children,    Sweetly let us sing      Of the Christ Child;      Of the Christ Child,      We will glad-ly sing.    2.   Bethlehem's star is shining,     Ho-ly is its ray,   To the world proclaiming     Christ was born to-day.       Of the Christ Child,       Of the Christ Child,       We will glad-ly sing.    3.   Wise men came to worship,     Wise men from a-far,   Guided by the glo-ry     Of that ho-ly star.       Of the Christ Child,       Of the Christ Child,       We will glad-ly sing.    4.   Now He reigns forever.     Loving you and me;   Joyful, let as praise Him     Round our Christmas tree.

(CHARACTERS: _1897_, a bent and feeble old man with skull-cap     and white beard, leaning on a cane. The number 1897 across his     forehead or breast. _South Wind_, a slender brunette in veil,     mantle, and cape of green cheese cloth, cape belted down in     the back. As she enters she flourishes her arms to throw     out veil and cape. _Messenger_, in lettered uniform. Four     _Heralds_, uniformed somewhat like messenger. Nine _Fairies_,     very small girls. Coronets of silver paper. Flowing robes     of cheese cloth with angel sleeves worn over clothing     sufficiently warm for the season. Colors to present the plants     whose leaves they carry. Silver belts, shoe-buckles, and     necklaces. Leaves cut from green paper, and letters from gilt.     _Kriss Kringle, Santa Claus, St. Nicholas, Knight Rupert_,     and _Babousca_ in appropriate costumes. Nine _Children_, in     ordinary clothes. _North Wind, East Wind_, and _West Wind_ in     costumes similar to _South Wind_, but varying in color,--white     for north, blue for east, and red for west. The Winds stand     behind St. Nicholas and keep up a restless blowing; that is,     a fluttering and ballooning of capes and veils by flourishing     arms.)             _1897_: I'm growing old and feeble,                      So much excitement's wrong;                    Folks should have had their Christmas                      When I was young and strong.                    Instead of that, they take it                      When I really ought to rest.                    My last days should be peaceful                      But--Father Time knows best                     And now I must be stirring,                      And call for Santa Claus;                    I almost dread his coming,                      There's always such a noise.                    The winds shall be my heralds--                      Come, North Wind, where are you?                    Just whisper to old Santa                      That here he'll soon be due.                     Now while I am about it,                      Perhaps it would be best                    To call that windy herald                      Whose home is in the west.                         (_Enter South Wind_)                    Here comes my daughter, South Wind.       _South Wind_:                    I'm almost out of breath,                      I really fear the North Wind                    Intends to be my death.             _1897_: I'll bid him treat you kindly;                      He should not be so rough;                    He's getting much too boisterous,                      I know that well enough.                    You're all here now but East Wind                      I'll call for him again.    _Messenger (entering)_:                    The East Wind says his health demands                      A little snow or rain.             _1897_: Well, well, just tell the storm clouds                      To send us rain or snow. _(Snowflakes begin to fall, seen through a window,--cotton or bits of   paper_)                 Well done! Now are you ready                      Upon your way to go?                    For some one must be bidding                      Knight Rupert come this way,                    To give the German children                      Their presents, Christmas day.                    And then there's old Babousca--                      In Russia she'll be found;                    Kriss Kringle and St. Nicholas,                      They, too, must both be round.          _Heralds_: We know where each one liveth,                      Full soon they shall appear.                    We go to do your bidding.                      Farewell, farewell, Old Year.                      (_Exit Heralds. Enter Fairies_)             _1897_: Bless me! what little people!                    _(Speaks to first one_.)                      Why, who are you, my dear?                    I ne'er before have seen you.                      What are you doing here?          _Fairies_: Oh, we are little fairies                      From out the ether blue.                    Here is a Christmas posy                      We are bringing unto you.                    And the initial letters                      Will a starry chaplet make.                    Each trusts you will receive it,                      And wear it for her sake.  [Illustration: CHRISTMAS]    _First Fairy (pointing to first leaf in chaplet)_:                    This is for Cypress.   _Second Fairy_:  And this for Holly.   _Third Fairy_:   And this for Rose of Jericho.   _Fourth Fairy_:  And this for Ivy.   _Fifth Fairy_:   And this for Speedwell.   _Sixth Fairy_:   And this for Thyme.   _Seventh Fairy_: And this for Mistletoe.   _Eighth Fairy_:  And this for the quivering Aspen.   _Ninth Fairy_:   And this for Star of Bethlehem.  (_They place chaplet upon the head of 1897._)             _1897_: Here's thanks, my little people,                      For this your posy sweet;                    Your loving thought has surely                      Made my happiness complete.  (_Enter Kriss Kringle, Santa Claus, Prince Rupert_, and _Babousca._)                     Why here is old Kriss Kringle;                     And Santa's coming, too;                    Knight Rupert and Babousca,                     I welcome both of you.                    And from the frozen Northland,                     I see a-riding down                    The cheery old St. Nicholas,                      Clad in his friar's gown.  [Illustration]  (_Enter St. Nicholas._)  (_Enter children, singing. They march around the stage, and finally stop in front of 1897 and the others._)        See how the children, so happy and gay,       Come marching together this glad Christmas day.    _Children_:   With hands on our heads, while the bells sweetly chime,   All blithely we're keeping the glad Christmas time.   Marching and singing, so gayly we go,   Turning and winding in lines to and fro.   Clap all together, and sing, sing away,   So merrily keeping this glad Christmas"]]]
