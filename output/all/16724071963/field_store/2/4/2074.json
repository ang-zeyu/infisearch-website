Austrian sentiment is becoming greater each day. But I need more money.\"  \"That is what we have come to see you about,\" said Hal. \"You see, that while you are well informed as to just what is going on here, we have only your word for it. You may be telling the truth--and you may be lying.\"  Nicolas jumped to his feet, his fingers twitching.  \"You dare--\" he began.  \"Nonsense,\" said Hal, remaining perfectly quiet. \"This is no time for heroics. I have come here to find out something and I am going to find it out. Now how much of this gold have you given out as ordered, and how much have you kept for yourself?\"  \"I--I--well, I have--\" Nicholas began.  \"As I thought,\" said Hal. \"You have been holding out. We can't have anything like that, you know. Where is the gold?\"  Nicolas, for a moment, seemed about to make a denial, but Hal eyed him steadily, and he said at last:  \"It is under this floor here,\" and he tapped the floor with his foot.  \"All right,\" said Hal. \"In shape to be carried?\"  \"Why yes, I guess half a dozen men could carry it well enough.\"  \"I am glad to hear that,\" said Hal, \"because I want you to dig it out right now.\"  Again Nicolas started to protest, but apparently thinking better of it, changed his mind and said:  \"It shall be as you say. But you will not hold this against me, my having held some of the gold for my own?\"  \"Not if you do as I say.\"  \"And I shall have more gold?\"  \"We shall see; perhaps.\"  \"Then I shall uncover the other,\" said Nicolas.  He stooped to his knees and lifted a loose board in the floor.  \"One moment,\" said Hal. \"Your men outside. We can take no chances with them. If they knew you had all this gold stored here there would be a fight. Step outside and tell them to go away.\"  This time Nicolas obeyed without even hesitating.  While he was outside, Hal whispered quickly to the others:  \"There is no use delaying. We'll give his men time to get out of hearing and then we'll grab him.\"  \"But the gold, what are you going to do with that?\" Ivan wanted to know.  Hal smiled a bit.  \"I don't know how I happened to think of that,\" he said, \"but now that we practically have it in our hands, I vote that we turn it over to the impoverished little kingdom of Montenegro.\"  \"By Jove! Good!\" exclaimed Colonel Edwards. \"My boy, you have a wonderful head on your shoulders. I am proud to know you.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Hal. \"Now, as long as I have been doing the talking, I may as well continue. We'll keep quiet until we are sure this traitor's men are out of earshot and then we'll take possession of Mr. Nicolas and his unearned gold.\"  A few moments later Nicolas re-entered the hut.  \"Get rid of them?\" asked Hal, briefly.  \"Yes.\"  \"Good. Then get busy and bring your gold out.\"  \"Look here,\" said Nicolas, eyeing Hal somewhat angrily. \"I don't like your tone exactly.\"  \"I don't exactly care whether you do or not,\" returned Hal quietly. \"You are pretty small fry in this game, Nicolas, and I'm not afraid of you. Remember, if anything should happen to me, you'll have the German government on your trail, and then what would you do for gold?\"  Nicolas opened his mouth to reply; then thought better of it and closed his lips without uttering a sound.  \"All right, now that we understand each other,\" said Hal. \"Get to work and produce the gold.\"  Nicolas waited no further, but did as commanded.  \"One,\" counted Hal, as the man drew from beneath the board a little sack of gold.  One after another Hal counted them as they were laid on the floor at his feet, until in all there were seventeen little sacks, just small enough to permit of being stowed away in outside coat pockets.  \"Two for each of us to carry,\" said Hal, looking around, \"and one over. I'll carry the extra one in my hand.\"  \"And don't I get any of this?\" demanded Nicolas, looking at the bags of gold longingly.  \"You do not,\" replied Hal, quietly. \"This money is to be given where it will do the most good. You have had your chance with it. Now it is my turn.\"  \"Very well,\" said Nicolas, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"But I have made my agreement with the Austrian government; and when the war has been won, I shall get my pay.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Hal, with a double meaning, that was, of course, lost upon Nicolas, \"you shall receive your just pay before the war ends.\"  \"Do you really think so?\" asked Nicolas eagerly. \"I hope so.\"  \"But now,\" said Hal, \"it is time to be moving. Pick up the gold, men, and let's get away from here.\"  The others obeyed. Each stowed two sacks in his pocket and Hal carried the seventeenth package in his hand. Then Hal motioned them out the door. He emerged after them and his hand was on his automatic as he did so.  \"Which way?\" asked Chester.  \"Straight ahead,\" said Nicolas.  \"No,\" said Hal quietly. \"About face. We are going the other way.\"  \"Where to?\" demanded Nicolas surlily.  \"Right back to Cettinje,\" replied Hal, \"where you shall be turned over to the Montenegrin authorities to meet the fate you deserve!\"     CHAPTER X.  FLIGHT.   Nicolas stopped short in his tracks. His face went red, then white, then flushed a dull red again. For a moment there was a deathly silence and then the Montenegrin sprang toward Hal with a cry of fury. The boy stood his ground.  \"I wouldn't if I were you,\" he said very quietly.  His automatic glistened in his hand at his hip. Nicolas gazed down and then pulled himself up short as his eyes rested on the weapon. He said nothing.  \"I'm glad to see you're sensible,\" Hal continued. \"Now you will take the lead, and for your own sake, I advise you to take the shortest cut in the general direction of Cettinje. Ivan, and you, Nikol, will see that he goes in the proper direction.\"  The dwarf's face was covered by a comical grin and his long arms waved about eagerly as he gave his assent. He turned to Stubbs.  \"You will walk with me?\" he asked.  For a moment Stubbs hesitated. He gazed first at the little man and then at the great bulk of Nicolas. Then his eyes roved to the huge form of Ivan.  \"By Jove! I'd rather be alongside Ivan there,\" he muttered to himself, \"but it wouldn't do to let this little fellow think I'm afraid. You're taking a long chance, Anthony, but I guess you had better do it. All right,\" he said to Nikol, and ranged himself at the dwarf's side.  \"I wouldn't try any tricks if I were you, Nicolas,\" said Ivan, as he swung into step behind the traitor, Nickol and Stubbs, the prisoner in the center.  Colonel Edwards and Colonel Anderson came next in line and Hal and Chester brought up the rear.  \"It's a good two days' journey back,\" said Hal to Chester, \"and, the chances are, we will encounter many of Nicolas' friends en route. We'll have to be careful.\"  \"We shall indeed,\" returned his chum. \"One little slip and there is no telling what may happen.\"  Night brought them to Ivan's cavern again and there they decided to spend the night. It had now been more than twenty-four hours since they had closed their eyes and all were tired out.  They experienced no difficulty getting Nicolas under the rock into the cavern, nor did the Montenegrin seek to attack them as they crawled after him, as Hal had half feared he would. He seemed completely dejected and downcast. He had not spoken a word during the day's march.  \"I'll put him in your erstwhile prison,\" Ivan said to Chester with a grin. \"I guess he'll be safe enough there for the night.\"  He did so.  \"Well, I'm going to turn in,\" said Stubbs. \"I'm dead for sleep. I tell you, it's no fun hoofing it over these mountains, particularly when you are guarding a prisoner like I have been all day, never knowing what minute he may make a break for liberty. No, sir, it's no fun.\"  \"Did you watch him pretty closely, Stubbs?\" asked Chester.  \"I did,\" replied Stubbs, briefly.  \"Why?\" continued Chester. \"Afraid he might jump you? Hope you didn't think he could catch you if you had a two-foot start.\"  Stubbs drew himself up majestically.  \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded in a ruffled tone.  \"Oh, nothing,\" said Chester, smiling.  \"If you mean to insinuate that I was afraid--\" began Stubbs in an injured tone.  \"What!\" interrupted Chester. \"You afraid, Mr. Stubbs? You do me an injustice, I assure you. Why, I have seen you fight, Mr. Stubbs. Now, do you, by any chance, remember your battle with three wildcats?\"  \"I do,\" said Stubbs, considerably pleased. He turned to Nikol. \"Did I ever tell you about that fight?\" he asked.  Nikol shook his head and eyed the little war correspondent with interest.  \"Well, I did,\" continued Stubbs. \"It was in Belgium. Three of the beasts attacked me in the dark and gave me a terrific struggle. But I killed them all, as these two boys can tell you.\"  Nikol was all smiles. He was glad that the man who had conquered him was such a royal gladiator.  \"And you were not hurt?\" he asked.  \"Oh, nothing to speak of,\" said Stubbs, modestly. \"A few scratches. Nothing serious.\"  \"They are bad beasts to fool with,\" said Nikol. \"My brother had both eyes scratched out in an encounter with a single wildcat. And you killed three.\"  \"There wasn't much chance of your eyes being scratched out, was there, Mr. Stubbs?\" said Chester.  \"And why not?\" demanded the little man,  \"Come now, Mr. Stubbs,\" said Chester, \"you don't mean to tell me you have forgotten you were lying flat on your face dodging bullets when the cats jumped you.\"  \"No, I hadn't forgotten,\" said Stubbs in an injured tone. \"But was it my fault that I had stumbled over a stone in the darkness a moment before?\"  \"Well, no, possibly not,\" Chester admitted. \"But it's funny you didn't think to mention that stone at the time.\"  \"If you are determined to laugh at me,\" said Stubbs with an air of ruffled dignity, \"I have nothing more to say. Any man is likely to fall.\"  \"So he is, Mr. Stubbs,\" agreed Chester, \"and I don't know but I'd fall myself if I saw three wildcats coming for me. Yes, I would, and I'd try to get my head just as deep in the ground as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12808"],["title","Frank on a Gun-Boat (#0)"],["body","Team.

In the Navy.   \"Well, Frank, did you bring home the evening's paper?\" inquired Mrs. Nelson, as her son entered the room where she was sitting.  \"Yes, ma'am. Here it is!\" answered Frank, producing it. \"But there is no news in it. The Army of the Potomac has not moved yet. I don't see what makes them wait so long. Why don't McClellan go to work and thrash the rebels?\"  \"You must remember that the rebels have about as many men as we have,\" answered his mother. \"Perhaps, if McClellan should undertake to 'thrash' the rebels, as you say, he would get whipped himself\"  \"That makes no difference,\" answered Frank. \"If I was in his place, and the rebels _should_ whip me, it wouldn't do any good, for I'd renew the battle every day, as long as I had a man left.\"  It was toward the close of the first year of the war, during the \"masterly inactivity\" of the Army of the Potomac. For almost eight months McClellan had been lying idle in his encampment, holding in check that splendid army, which, with one blow, could have crushed out the rebellion, and allowing the rebels ample time to encircle their capital with fortifications, before which the blood of loyal men was to be poured out like water. The people of the North were growing impatient; and \"On to Richmond!\" was the cry from every part of the land.  From the time Fort Sumter had fallen, Frank had been deeply interested in what as going on. The insults which had been heaped upon the flag under which his grandfather had fought and died, made the blood boil in his veins, and he often wished that he could enlist with the brave defenders of his country. He grew more excited each day, as the struggle went on, and the news of a triumph or defeat would fire his spirit, and he longed to be standing side by side with the soldiers of the Union, that he might share in their triumphs, or assist in retrieving their disasters.  He was left almost alone now, for many of the boys of his acquaintance had shouldered their muskets and gone off with the others; and that very day he had met Harry Butler, who had enlisted as a private, wearing the uniform of a lieutenant, which he had won by his bravery at Fort Donelson.  He had never said one word to his mother about enlisting, for he was an only son, and he dreaded to ask her permission. But that mother's quick eye easily read what was going on in her son's mind. She had Puritan blood in her veins; her ancestors had fought in the war of the Revolution, and she had resolved that, if Frank wished to go, she would give her full consent. A mother's heart alone can tell the struggle it had cost her to come to this determination.  \"I've got a letter from Archie, also,\" said Frank.  His mother took it from his hand, and read as follows:      Portland, _March_ 18, 1862.       Dear Cousin:      I am about to tell you something which you will call strange news.     Father has at last given his consent to my going to war, provided     you will go too. He says that if I go, I must have you with me, to     take care of me, and keep me straight. I suppose he thinks I will     never go if I am obliged to wait for you, for he says your mother     will not consent to your going. You can ask her, any way. You know     you always wanted to have a hand in putting down this rebellion.      If we go at all, I think the best plan is to enter the navy. It is a     much better branch of the service than the army--the discipline is     better; there are no long marches to endure; and, wherever you go,     your house goes with you.      Now, be sure and do your best, for now is our chance, if ever.     Please write immediately, for I am afraid father will change his     mind.      Yours, in haste, Archibald Winters.  When Mrs. Nelson had read the letter, she handed it back to her son without saying a word.  \"Well, mother, what do you think of it?\" inquired Frank.  \"The matter rests entirely with you, my son,\" answered Mrs. Nelson, dropping her sewing into her lap. \"Do just as you think best.\"  \"Do you say I may go?\" inquired Frank, joyfully.  \"Certainly. You have my full consent to go, if you wish to.\"  \"Oh, mother,\" exclaimed Frank, springing up and throwing his arms around her neck, \"I wish I had known, long ago, that you were willing to have me go.\"  \"Where are you going, Frank?\" inquired Julia, who had a vague suspicion of what was going on.  \"I'm off to the war,\" answered her brother. \"I am going into the navy with Archie.\"  \"Oh, Frank,\" she exclaimed, bursting into tears, \"you must not go. There's enough in the army without you. You will certainly get shot.\"  \"I'll never be shot in the back,\" said Frank; \"you may rely on that. But you don't suppose that every one who goes to war gets shot, do you? I may be one of the lucky ones; so don't cry any more.\"  But Julia could not control her feelings. The thought that her brother was to be exposed to the slightest danger was terrible; and Frank, seeing that it would do no good to talk to her, left the room, and went into his study, where he wrote to Archie, stating that he would start for Portland the next day. He spent the forenoon in wandering about the house and orchard, taking a long and lingering look at each familiar object. He locked the museum, and gave the key to Julia, who was close at his side wherever he went. Even Brave seemed to have an idea of what was going on, for he followed his master about, and would look into his face and whine, as though he was well aware that they were about to be separated.  Immediately after dinner, the carriage which was to convey Frank and his baggage to the Julia Burton drew up before the door. The parting time had come. \"Good-by, mother,\" said Frank, as he stood at the door, ready to go.  \"Good-by, my son,\" said Mrs. Nelson, straining him to her bosom, and struggling hard to keep back a sob. \"We may never see you again, but I hope I shall never hear that you shrunk from your duty.\"  Frank could not reply--his breast was too full for utterance: and hastily kissing his sister, and shaking Hannah's hand, he hurried down the walk toward the gate. He had not gone far before Brave came bounding after him.  \"Go back, old fellow,\" said Frank, caressing the faithful animal; \"you can't go with me this time. It will be a long while before you and I will go anywhere together again. Go back, sir.\"  Brave understood his master perfectly; and he turned and trotted toward the house, looking back now and then, and whining, as if urging his master to allow him to go too. Frank did not stop to look back, but sprang into the carriage, and the driver closed the door after him, and mounted to his seat and drove off. He had scarcely time to get his baggage on board the steamer before she moved off into the stream. And Frank was glad it was so, for the longer he remained in sight of the village, the harder grew the struggle to leave it. But, at length, every familiar object was left behind, and being surrounded by new scenes, Frank gradually recovered his usual spirits.  In two days he arrived at Portland, and as he was getting off the cars, he was seized by Archie, who had come to the depot to meet him.  \"I'm glad to see you,\" said the latter; \"it is lucky that you wrote just as you did, for father has said a dozen times that I can't go. But I guess he will not refuse me, now that you are here.\"  \"I hope not,\" said Frank; \"we can go as well as any one else. If every one was to stay at home, we shouldn't have any army at all.\"  \"That's just what I told father; but he didn't seem to see it. He says there are some who ought to go, for they are of no earthly use here; but he thinks that boys like you and me ought to stay at home until we know enough to take care of ourselves.\"  But Mr. Winters did not raise many objections when he found that Frank had obtained his mother's consent; and, on the next day but one after Frank's arrival, he accompanied the boys on board the receiving-ship, where they were speedily examined and sworn in. Each was then supplied with a bag and hammock, and two suits of clothes; and, when they were rigged out in their blue shirts and wide pants, they made fine-looking sailors. At Mr. Winters' request they were granted permission to remain on shore until a raft of men was ready to be sent away. The boys were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased while they remained, for, as they were to leave so soon, Mr. Winters could not find it in his heart to raise any objections to the plans they proposed for their amusement. Besides, he knew that Archie was in good hands, for Frank was a boy of excellent habits, and possessed sufficient moral courage to say _no_, when tempted to do wrong; and, as he had great influence over his cousin, Mr. Winters knew their conduct would be such as he could approve.  At length, one morning, when they went on board the receiving-ship to report as usual, they were ordered to present themselves at the depot at two o'clock that afternoon, with their bags and hammocks, in readiness to take the train for the West. The boys were a good deal disappointed when they heard this,"]]]
