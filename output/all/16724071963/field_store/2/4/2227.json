We     were upon this bank two months, at the end of which time we found     ourselves in twenty-five fathoms and 5 degrees south latitude and     ten leagues from the coast; and having gone 480 leagues here, the     coast goes to the north-east. I did not search it, for the bank     became very shallow. So we stood to the north.\"  The \"very large islands\" seen by Torres were no doubt the hills of Cape York, the northernmost point of Australia, and so he, all unconsciously, had passed within sight of the continent for which he was searching. A copy of the report by Torres was lodged in the archives of Manila, and when the English took that city in 1762, Dalrymple, the celebrated geographer, discovered it, and gave the name of Torres Straits to what is now well known as the dangerous passage dividing New Guinea from Australia. De Quiros, in his ship, made no further discovery; he arrived on the Mexican coast in October, 1606, and did all he could to induce Philip III. of Spain to sanction further exploration, but without success.  Of the voyages of the Dutch in Australian waters much interesting matter is available. Major sums up the case in these words:--      \"The entire period up to the time of Dampier, ranging over two     centuries, presents these two phases of obscurity: that in the     sixteenth century (the period of the Portuguese and Spanish     discoveries) there are indications on maps of the great     probability of Australia having already been discovered, but with     no written documents to confirm them; while in the seventeenth     century there is documentary evidence that its coasts were touched     upon or explored by a considerable number of Dutch voyagers, but     the documents immediately describing these voyages have not been     found.\"    The period of known Dutch discovery begins with the        [Sidenote: 1644] establishment of the Dutch East India Company, and a knowledge of the west coast of Australia grew with the growth of the Dutch colonies, but grew slowly, for the Dutchmen were too busy trading to risk ships and spend time and money upon scientific voyages.  In January, 1644, Commodore Abel Janszoon Tasman was despatched upon his second voyage of discovery to the South Seas, and his instructions, signed by the Governor-General of Batavia, Antonio Van Diemen, begin with a recital of all previous Dutch voyages of a similar character. From this document an interesting summary of Dutch exploration can be made. Tasman, in his first voyage, had discovered the island of Van Diemen, which he named after the then Governor of Batavia, but which has since been named Tasmania, after its discoverer. During this first voyage the navigator also discovered New Zealand, passed round the east side of Australia without seeing the land, and on his way home sailed along the northern shore of New Guinea.  But to come back to the summary of Dutch voyages found in Tasman's instructions: During 1605 and 1606 the Dutch yacht _Duyphen_ made two exploring voyages to New Guinea. On one trip the commander, after coasting New Guinea, steered southward along the islands on the west side of Torres Straits to that part of Australia, a little to the west and south of Cape York, marked on modern maps as Duyphen Point, thus unconsciously--for he thought himself still on the west coast of New Guinea--making the first authenticated discovery of the continent.  Dirk Hartog, in command of the _Endragt_, while on his way from Holland to the East Indies, put into what Dampier afterwards called Sharks' Bay, and on an island, which now bears his name, deposited a tin plate with an inscription recording his arrival, and dated October 25th, 1616. The plate was afterwards found by a Dutch navigator in 1697, and replaced by another, which in its turn was discovered in July, 1801, by Captain Hamelin, of the _Naturaliste_, on the well-known French voyage in search of the ill-fated La PÃ©rouse. The Frenchman copied the inscription, and nailed the plate to a post with another recording his own voyage. These inscriptions were a few years later removed by De Freycinet, and deposited in the museum of the Institute of Paris. Hartog ran along the coast a few degrees, naming the land after his ship, and was followed by many other voyagers at frequent intervals down to the year       [Sidenote: 1623-1627] 1727, from which time Dutch exploration has no more a place in Australian discovery.  During the 122 years of which we have records of their voyages, although the Dutch navigators' work, compared with that done by Cook and his successors, was of small account; yet, considering the state of nautical science, and that the ships were for the most part Dutch East Indiamen, the Dutch names which still sprinkle the north and the west coasts of the continent show that from Cape York in the extreme north, westward of the Great Australian Bight in the south, the Dutchmen had touched at intervals the whole coast-line.  But before leaving the Dutch period there are one or two voyages that, either on account of their interesting or important character, deserve brief mention.  In 1623 Arnhem's Land, now the northern district of the Northern Territory of South Australia, was discovered by the Dutch yachts _Pesa_ and _Arnhem_. This voyage is also noteworthy on account of the massacre of the master of the _Arnhem_ and eight of his crew by the natives while they were exploring the coast of New Guinea. In 1627 the first discovery of the south coast was made by the _Gulde Zeepard_, and the land then explored, extending from Cape Leeuwin to the Nuyts Archipelago, on the South Australian coast, was named after Peter Nuyts, then on board the ship on his way to Batavia, whence he was sent to Japan as ambassador from Holland.  In the year 1628 a colonizing expedition of eleven vessels left Holland for the Dutch East Indies. Among these ships was the _Batavia_, commanded by Francis Pelsart. A terrible storm destroyed ten of the fleet, and on June 4th, 1629, the _Batavia_ was driven ashore on the reef still known as Houtman's Abrolhos, which had been discovered and named by a Dutch East Indiaman some years earlier--probably by the commander of the _Leeuwin_, who discovered and named after his ship the cape at the south-west point of the continent. The _Batavia_, which carried a number of chests of silver money, went to pieces on the reef. The crew of the ship managed to land upon the rocks, and saved some food from the wreck, but they were without water. Pelsart, in one of the ship's boats, spent a couple of weeks exploring the inhospitable coast in the neighbourhood in the hope of discovering water, but found so little that he ultimately determined to attempt to make Batavia and from there bring               [Sidenote: 1629] succour to his ship's company. On July 3rd he fell in with a Dutch ship off Java and was taken on to Batavia. From there he obtained help and returned to the wreck, arriving at the Abrolhos in the middle of September; but during the absence of the commander the castaways had gone through a terrible experience, which is related in Therenot's _Recueil de Voyages Curieux,_ and translated into English in Major's book, from which the following is extracted:--      \"Whilst Pelsart is soliciting assistance, I will return to those     of the crew who remained on the island; but I should first inform     you that the supercargo, named Jerome Cornelis, formerly an     apothecary at Haarlem, had conspired with the pilot and some     others, when off the coast of Africa, to obtain possession of the     ship and take her to Dunkirk, or to avail themselves of her for     the purpose of piracy. This supercargo remained upon the wreck ten     days after the vessel had struck, having discovered no means of     reaching the shore. He even passed two days upon the mainmast,     which floated, and having from thence got upon a yard, at length     gained the land. In the absence of Pelsart, he became commander,     and deemed this a suitable occasion for putting his original     design into execution, concluding that it would not be difficult     to become master of that which remained of the wreck, and to     surprise Pelsart when he should arrive with the assistance which     he had gone to Batavia to seek, and afterwards to cruise in these     seas with his vessel. To accomplish this it was necessary to get     rid of those of the crew who were not of his party; but before     imbruing his hands with blood he caused his accomplices to sign a     species of compact, by which they promised fidelity one to     another. The entire crew was divided [living upon] between three     islands; upon that of Cornelis, which they had named the graveyard     of Batavia, was the greatest number of men. One of them, by name     Weybehays, a lieutenant, had been despatched to another island to     seek for water, and having discovered some after a search of     twenty days, he made the preconcerted signal by lighting three     fires, but in vain, for they were not noticed by the people of     Cornelis' company, the conspirators having during that time     murdered those who were not of their party. Of these they killed     thirty or forty. Some few saved themselves upon pieces of wood,     which they joined together, and going in search of Weybehays,     informed him of the horrible massacre that had taken place. Having     with him forty-five men, he resolved to keep upon his guard, and     to defend himself from these assassins if they should make an     attack upon his company, which in effect they designed to do, and     to treat the other party in the same manner; for they feared lest     their company, or that which remained upon the third island,     should inform the commander upon his arrival, and thus prevent the     execution of their design. They succeeded easily with the party     last mentioned, which was the weakest,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12992"],["title","The Naval Pioneers of Australia (#2)"],["body","the whole of them,     excepting seven children and some women. They hoped to succeed as     easily with Weybehays' company, and in the meanwhile broke open     the chests of merchandise which had been saved from the vessel.     Jerome Cornelis caused clothing to be made             [Sidenote: 1629]     for his company out of the rich stuffs which he found therein,     choosing to himself a bodyguard, each of whom he clothed in scarlet,     embroidered with gold and silver. Regarding the women as part of     the spoil, he took one for himself, and gave one of the daughters     of the minister to a principal member of his party, abandoning     the other three for public use. He drew up also certain rules for     the future conduct of his men.  [Illustration: A DUTCH MAN-OF-WAR OF THE END OF THE 17th CENTURY. From a print after Vandervelde.]      \"After these horrible proceedings he caused himself to be elected     captain-general by a document which he compelled all his     companions to sign. He afterwards sent twenty-two men in two     shallops to destroy the company of Weybehays, but they met with a     repulse. Taking with him thirty-seven men, he went himself against     Weybehays, who received him at the water's edge as he disembarked,     and forced him to retire, although the lieutenant and his men had     no weapons but clubs, the ends of which were armed with spikes.     Finding force unavailing, the mutineer had recourse to other     means. He proposed a treaty of peace, the chaplain, who remained     with Weybehays, drawing up the conditions. It was agreed to with     this proviso, that Weybehays' company should remain unmolested,     and they, upon their part, agreed to deliver up a little boat in     which one of the sailors had escaped from the island where     Cornelis was located to that of Weybehays, receiving in return     some stuffs for clothing his people. During his negotiations     Cornelis wrote to certain French soldiers who belonged to the     lieutenant's company offering to each a sum of money to corrupt     them, with the hope that with this assistance he might easily     compass his design. His letters, which were without effect, were     shown to Weybehays, and Cornelis, who was ignorant of their     disclosure, having arrived the next day with three or four others     to find Weybehays and bring him the apparel, the latter caused him     to be attacked, killed two or three of the company, and took     Cornelis himself prisoner. One of them, by name Wouterlos, who     escaped from this rout, returned the following day to renew the     attack, but with little success.      \"Pelsart arrived during these occurrences in the frigate _Sardam_.     As he approached the wreck he observed smoke from a distance, a     circumstance that afforded him great consolation, since he     perceived by it that his people were not all dead. He cast anchor,     and threw himself immediately into a skiff with bread and wine,     and proceeded to land on one of the islands. Nearly at the same     time a boat came alongside with four armed men. Weybehays, who was     one of the four, ... informed him of the massacre, and advised him     to return as speedily as possible to his vessel, for that the     conspirators designed to surprise him, having already murdered     twenty-five persons, and to attack him with two shallops, adding     that he himself had that morning been at close quarters with them.     Pelsart perceived at the same time the two shallops coming towards     him, and had scarcely got on board his own vessel before they came     alongside. He was surprised to see the people covered with     embroidery of gold and silver and weapons in their hands, and     demanded of them why they approached the vessel armed. They     replied that they would inform him when they came on board. He     commanded them to cast their arms into the sea, or otherwise he     would sink them. Finding themselves compelled          [Sidenote: 1629]     to submit, they threw away their weapons, and being ordered on     board, were immediately placed in irons. One of them, named Jan     de Bremen, confessed that he had put to death or assisted in the     assassination of twenty-seven persons. The same evening Weybehays     brought his prisoner on board.      \"On the 18th day of September the captain and the master-pilot,     taking with them ten men of Weybehays' company, passed over in     boats to the island of Cornelis. Those who still remained thereon     lost all courage as soon as they saw them, and allowed themselves     to be placed in irons.\"  Pelsart remained another week at the Abrolhos, endeavouring to recover some of the _Batavia's_ treasure, and succeeded in finding all but one chest. The mutineers were tried by the officers of the _Sardam_, and all but two were executed before the ship left the scene of their awful crime. The two men who were not hanged were put on shore on the mainland, and were probably the first Europeans to end their lives upon the continent. Dutch vessels for many years afterwards sought for traces of the marooned seamen, but none were ever discovered.  The 1644 voyage of Tasman was made expressly for the purpose of exploring the north and north-western shores of the continent, and to prove the existence or otherwise of straits separating it from New Guinea. Tasman's instructions show this, and prove that while the existence of the straits was suspected, and although Torres had unconsciously passed through them, they were not known. Tasman explored a long length of coast-line, establishing its continuity from the extreme north-western point (Arnhem Land) as far as the twenty-second degree of south latitude (Exmouth Gulf). He failed to prove the existence of Torres Straits, but to him, it is generally agreed, is due the discovery and naming of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Carpenter in Tasman's time being President at Amsterdam of the Dutch East India Company) and the naming of a part of North Australia, as he had previously named the island to the south, after Van Diemen. From this voyage dates the name New Holland: the great stretch of coast-line embracing his discoveries became known to his countrymen as Hollandia Nova, a name which in its English form was adopted for the whole continent, and remained until it was succeeded by the more euphonious name of Australia. Tasman continued doing good service for the Dutch East India Company until his death at Batavia about 1659.  The last Dutch voyage which space permits us to mention    [Sidenote: 1727] briefly is that of the _Zeewigk_, which ship was wrecked on the Abrolhos in 1727, with a quantity of treasure on board. Some of the crew built a sloop out of the wreck and made their way to Batavia, taking with them the bulk of the treasure; but from time to time, even down to the present century, relics of the wreck, including several coins, have been recovered, and are now to be seen in the museum of the West Australian capital. But before the Dutch had given up exploring the coast of New Holland, Dampier, the first Englishman to set foot upon its shores, had twice visited the continent, and with his two voyages the English naval story of Australia may properly begin.     CHAPTER II.  DAMPIER: THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN IN AUSTRALIA.       \"I dined with Mr. Pepys, where was Captain Dampier, who had been a     famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job, and     printed a relation of his very strange adventure and his     observations. He was now going abroad again by the King's     encouragement, who furnished a ship of 290 tons. He seemed a more     modest man than one would imagine by the relation of the crew he     had consorted with. He brought a map of his observations of the     course of the winds of the South Sea, and assured us that the maps     hitherto extant were all false as to the Pacific Sea, which he     makes on the south of the line, that on the north and running by     the coast of Peru being I exceedingly tempestuous.\"  Thus wrote John Evelyn on August 6th, 1698.  Of the adventurous career of Dampier prior to this date too much fiction and quite enough history has already been written; but we cannot omit a short account of the buccaneer's life up to the time of his receiving King William's commission.  Dampier was born in 1652 at East Coker,               [Sidenote: 1673-1698] Somersetshire. Of his parents he tells us that \"they did not originally design me for the sea, but bred me at school till I came of years fit for a trade. But upon the death of my mother they who had the disposal of me took other measures, and, having removed me from the Latin school to learn writing and arithmetic, they soon placed me with a master of a ship at Weymouth, complying with the inclinations I had very early of seeing the world.\"  Dampier made several voyages in merchantmen; then he shipped as able seaman on the _Royal Prince_, Captain Sir Edward Spragge, and served under him till the death of that commander at the end of the Dutch war in 1673. Soon after he made a voyage to the West Indies; then began an adventurous life--ashore cutting logwood in the Bay of Campeachy when not fighting; afloat a buccaneer--of which he has given us details in his _Voyage round the Terrestrial Globe_.  In March, 1686, Dampier in a little barque, the _Cygnet_, commanded by Captain Swan, quitted the American coast and sailed westward across the Pacific. On this voyage the _Cygnet_ touched at the Ladrones, the Bashee Islands, the Philippines, Celebes, Timor, New Holland, and the Nicobar Islands. Here Dampier left his ship and worked his way to England, which he reached in 1691. (The _Cygnet_ was afterwards lost off Madagascar.) He had brought home with him from Mindanao a tattooed slave, whom he called the \"Painted Prince Jeoey,\" and who was afterwards exhibited as the first painted savage ever seen in England. \"Jeoey,\" who died at Oxford, is"]]]
