[Illustration: GENERAL MARTIN FIELD. _Eugene Field's Grandfather._]  But before taking up the thread of Roswell Martin Field's strange and unique story, let me give a letter written by his father to his sister, Miss Mary Field, then at the school of Miss Emma Willard in Troy, N.Y., as exhibit number one, that Eugene Field came by his peculiarities, literary and otherwise, by direct lineal descent. Roswell was a phenomenal scholar, as his own eldest son was not. At the age of eleven he was ready for college, and entered Middlebury with his brother Charles, his senior by four years. How they conducted themselves there may be judged from this letter to their sister:    Newfane, March 31st, 1822.    Dear Mary:    I sit down to write you my last letter while you remain at Troy.   Yours by Mr. Read was received, in which I find you allude to the   \"severe and satyrical language\" of mine in a former letter. That   letter was written upon the conduct of my children, which is an   important subject to me. If children are disobedient, a parent has a   right to be severe with them. If I recollect right I expressed to   you that your two oldest brothers' conduct was very reprehensible,   and I there predicted their ruin. But I then little thought that I   should soon witness the sad consequences of their ill-conduct. I   received a letter from President Bates about two weeks since and   another from Charles the same day, that Charles had been turned away   and forever dismissed from the college for his misconduct; Roswell   must suffer a public admonition and perhaps more punishment for his   evil deeds. Charles was turned out of college the 7th of March, and   I wrote on the week after to have him come directly home, but we   have heard nothing from him since. Where he is we can form no   conjecture. But probably he is five hundred miles distant without   money and without friends. I leave you to conjecture the rest.   Roswell is left alone at the age of fifteen to get along, if he is   permitted to stay through college.    These, Mary, are the consequences of dissipation and bad conduct.   And seeing as I do the temper and disposition of my children, that   they \"are inclined to evil and that continually,\" can you wonder   that I write with severity to them? Our hopes are blasted as relates   to Charles and Roswell, and you cannot conceive the trouble which   they have given us. Your mother is almost crazy about them; nor are   we without fears as to you. I say now, as I said in my former   letter, that I wish my children were all at home at work. I am   convinced that an education will only prove injurious to them. If I   had as many sons as had the patriarch Jacob not one should ever   again go nigh a college. It is not a good calculation to educate   children for destruction. The boys' conduct has already brought a   disgrace upon our family which we can never outgrow. They   undoubtedly possess respectable talents and genius, but what are   talents worth when wholly employed in mischief?    I have expended almost two thousand dollars in educating the boys,   and now just at the close they are sent off in disgrace and infamy.   The money is nothing in comparison to the disgrace and ruin that   must succeed. Mary, think of these things often, and especially when   you feel inclined to be gay and airy. Let your brother's fate be a   striking lesson to you. For you may well suppose that you possess   something of the same disposition that he does, but I hope that you   will exercise more prudence than he has. You must now return home   with a fixed resolution to become a steady, sober, and industrious   girl. Give up literary pursuits and quietly and patiently follow   that calling which I am convinced is most proper for my children.    It does appear to me that if children would consider how much   anxiety their parents have for them they would conduct themselves   properly, if it was only to gratify their parents. But it is not so.   Many of them seem determined not only to wound the feelings of the   parents in the most cruel manner but also to ruin themselves.    Remember us respectfully to Dr. and Mrs. Willard, and I am your   affectionate father    MARTIN FIELD.  That Mary did return home to be the mediator between her incensed and stern father and his wayward and mischievous, but not incorrigible sons, is part of the sequel to this letter. What her daughter, Mary Field French, afterwards became to the sons of the younger of the reprehensible pair of youthful collegians will appear later on in this narrative. It is beautifully acknowledged in the dedication of Eugene Field's \"Little Book of Western Verse,\" which I had the honor of publishing for the subscribers in 1889, more than three score years after the date of the foregoing letter. In that dedication, with the characteristic license of a true artist, Field credited the choice of Miss French for the care of his youthful years to his mother:    _A dying mother gave to you     Her child a many years ago;   How in your gracious love he grew,     You know dear, patient heart, you know._         *       *       *       *       *    _To you I dedicate this book,     And, as you read it line by line.   Upon its faults as kindly look     As you have always looked on mine._  In truth, however, it was the living bereaved father who turned in the bewilderment of his grief to the \"dear patient heart\" of his sister, to find a second mother for his two motherless boys. To Martin Field, Mary was a guardian daughter, to Charles K. and Roswell M. 1st, she was a loyal and mediating sister, and to Eugene and Roswell M. 2d, she was a loving aunt, as her daughter Mary was an indulgent mother and unfailing friend. The last name survived \"the love and gratitude\" of Eugene's dedication ten years.  As may have been surmised the parental forebodings of the grieved and satirical General Field were not realized in the eternal perdition of his two sons. Education did not prove their destruction. With more than respectable talents Charles was reinstated at Middlebury, and four months later graduated with high honors, while Roswell took his degree when only fifteen years old, the plague and admiration of his preceptors, and, we may well suppose, the pride and joy of the agonized parents, who welcomed the graduates to Newfane with all the profusion of a prodigal father and the love of a distracted but doting mother. They never had any reason to doubt the nature of sister Mary's reception.  Charles and Roswell studied law with their father in the quaint little office detached from the Field homestead at Newfane. The word edifice might fittingly be applied to this building which, though only one room square and one story high, has a front on the public square, with miniature Greek columns to distinguish it from the ordinary outbuildings that are such characteristic appendages of New England houses. The troubles of General Field with his two sons were not to end when he got them away from the temptations of college life, for they were prone to mischief, \"and that continually,\" even under his severe and watchful eye. This took one particular form which is the talk of Windham County even yet. By reason of their presence in General Field's office they were early apprised of actions at law which he was retained to institute; whereupon they sought out the defendant and offered their services to represent him gratis. Thus the elder counsellor frequently found himself pitted in the justice's courts against his keen-witted and graceless sons, who availed themselves of every obsolete technicality, quirk, and precedent of the law to obstruct justice and worry their dignified parent, whom they addressed as \"our learned but erring brother in the law.\" Not infrequently these youthful practitioners triumphed in these legal tilts, to the mortification of their father, who, in his indignation, could not conceal his admiration for the ingenuity of their misdirected professional zeal.  [Illustration: ESTHER S. FIELD. _Eugene Field's Grandmother._]  Two years after his graduation, and when only seventeen years of age, Eugene Field's father was sufficiently learned in the law to be admitted to the bar of Vermont. They wasted no time in those good old days. Before he was thirty, Roswell M. Field had represented his native town in the General Assembly, had been elected several times State's Attorney, and in every way seemed destined to play a notable part in the affairs of Vermont, if not on a broader field. He was not only a lawyer of full and exact learning, an ingenious pleader, and a powerful advocate, but an exceptionally accomplished scholar. His knowledge of Greek, Latin, French, and German rendered their literature a perennial source upon which to draw for the illumination and embellishment of the pure and virile English of which he was master. It was from him that Eugene inherited his delight in queer and rare objects of vertu and that \"rich, strong, musical and sympathetic voice\" which would have been invaluable on the stage, and of which he made such captivating use among his friends. Would that he had also inherited that \"strong and athletic\" frame which, according to his aged preceptor, enabled Roswell M. Field to graduate at the age of fifteen. It is not, however, for his learning and accomplishments of mind and person that we are interested in Roswell Martin Field, but for the strange incident in his life that uprooted him from the congenial environments of New England and the career opening so temptingly before him, to transplant him to Missouri, there to become"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],["title","Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#3)"],["body"," father of a youth, who, by all laws of heredity and by the peculiar tang of his genius, should have been born and nurtured amid the stern scenes and fixed customs of Puritan New England. That story must be told in another chapter.     CHAPTER II  HIS FATHER'S FIRST LOVE-AFFAIR   Many a time and oft in our walks and talks has Eugene Field told me the story I am about to relate, but never with the particularity of detail and the authority of absolute data with which I have \"comprehended it,\" as he would say, in the following pages. It was his wish that it should be told, and I follow his injunction the more readily, as in its relation I am able to demonstrate how clearly the son inherited his peculiar literary mode from the father.  It may be said further that, had the remarkable situation which grew out of Roswell M. Field's first marriage occurred one hundred years earlier, or had it occurred in our own day in a state like Kentucky, it would have provoked a feud that could only have been settled by blood, while it might readily have imbrued whole counties. Even in Vermont it stirred up animosities which occupied the attention of the courts for years, and which the lapse of nearly two generations has not wholly eradicated from the memory of old inhabitants. In the opening remarks of the opinion of the Supreme Court, in one of several cases growing out of it, I find the following statement: \"It would be inexpedient to recapitulate the testimony in a transaction which was calculated to call up exasperated feelings, which has apparently taxed ingenuity and genius to criminate and recriminate, where a deep sense of injury is evidently felt and expressed by the parties to the controversy, and where this state of feeling has extended, as it was to be expected, to all the immediate friends of the parties, who from their situation were necessarily compelled to become witnesses and to testify in the case.\"  In the relation of this story I shall substitute Christian names for the surnames of the parties outside of the Field family, although all have become public property and the principals are dead. The scene is laid in the adjoining counties of Windham and Windsor in the Green Mountain State, and this is how it happened:  There lived at Windsor, in the county of the same name, a widow named Susanna, and she was well-to-do according to the modest standard of the times. She was blest with a goodly family of sons and daughters, among whom was Mary Almira, a maiden fair to look upon and impressionable withal. Now it befell that Mary Almira, while still very young, was sent to school at the Academy in Leicester, Mass., where she met, and, in the language of the law, formed \"a natural and virtuous attachment\" with a student named Jeremiah, sent thither by his guardian from Oxbridge in the state last before mentioned. They met, vowed eternal devotion and parted, as many school-children have done before and will do again.  After her return to Windsor, Jeremiah seemingly faded from the thoughts of Mary Almira, so that when she subsequently accompanied her mother on a visit to Montreal, she felt free to experience \"a sincere and lively affection\" for a Canadian youth named Elder. So lively was this affection that when Jeremiah next saw Mary Almira it had completely effaced him from her memory. Nothing daunted, however, being then of the mature age of eighteen years and eight months, and two years Mary's senior, he resumed the siege of her heart, and in short order their engagement was duly \"promulgated and even notorious.\"  Before Mary succumbed to the second suit of Jeremiah, she waited for a pledge of affection from young Mister Elder in the shape of an album in which he was to have forwarded a communication, and it was \"in the bitterness of her disappointment at not receiving a letter, message, or remembrance from Mister Elder that she formed the engagement with Jeremiah, in order that she might gratify her resentment by sending the news of the same to Mister Elder.\" This she did with a peremptory request for the return of her album without the leaves on which he had written. What was her chagrin and unavailing remorse on receiving the album to find that every leaf was cut out but one, a mute witness to her \"infidelity to her early lover.\" Small wonder that \"her tenderness revived,\" and \"she cursed the hour in which she had formed the precipitate engagement with Jeremiah, and oftentimes she shed over that album tears of heartfelt sorrow and regret.\" At least so we are told in the pleadings, from which authentic source I draw my quotations.  Now Mary was nothing if not precipitate, for all this came to pass in the spring or summer of 1831, when she was not quite sweet seventeen. It also happened without the knowledge or concern of Roswell Martin Field, who was a young and handsome bachelor of quick wit and engaging manners, living at Fayetteville in the neighboring county, \"knowing nothing at that time of the said Mary Almira, her lovers, suitors, promises, engagements, intimacies, visits or movements whatsoever.\" He was soon to know.  In the summer of 1832 it happened that Mary Almira was on a visit to Mrs. Jonathan, her cousin german, the wife of Justice Jonathan of Brattleboro, Vt. And now fate began to take a swift and inexplicable interest in the affairs of Mary and Roswell. On August 30th, 1832, in company with Mrs. Jonathan and Mrs. French (the Mary Field of the first chapter of this book), Miss Mary Almira visited Fayetteville, and, we are told, \"when the chaise containing the said ladies arrived Roswell advanced to hand them out, and then for the first time saw and was introduced to said Mary Almira, who received him with a nod and a broad good-humored laugh.\" She remained over night, the guest of Mrs. French, and Roswell saw her only for a few moments in his sister's sitting-room. What occurred is naÃ¯vely told under oath in the following extract from the pleadings:  \"Some conversation of a general nature passed between them, and as the said Mary Almira was a young lady of very pleasing face and form and agreeable manners, it is by no means improbable that he (Roswell) manifested to said Mary Almira that in those matters he was not wholly devoid of sensibility and discernment.\" The next morning Mary returned to Brattleboro with Mrs. Jonathan, and Roswell \"did not then expect ever to see her more.\"  But it was otherwise decreed, for after the lapse of eleven days Justice Jonathan had professional business in Fayetteville, and, lo! Mary Almira attended him. It was Tuesday, September 11th, when for a second time she dawned on the discerning view of Roswell. For eight days she lingered as a guest of Mrs. French, whose brother began to show signs of awakening sensibility, although at this time informed of the unbroken pact between Mary Almira and Jeremiah. How young love took its natural course is told in the pleadings by Roswell with protests \"against the manifest breach of delicacy and decorum of calling him into this Honorable Court to render an account of his attentions to a lady,\" and \"more especially when that lady is his lawful wedded wife.\"  When Mary had been in Fayetteville four days it happened that Justice Jonathan was called to Westminster. When asked if she was inclined to accompany him, Mary turned to Roswell and \"inquired with a smile if it was not likely to rain?\" and Roswell confesses \"that he told her that it would be very imprudent for her to set out.\"  [Illustration: ROSWELL MARTIN FIELD. _Eugene Field's Father._]  Still protesting against the manifest indelicacy of the revelation, Roswell has told for us the story of his first advances upon the citadel of Mary's affections in words as cunningly chosen as were ever the best passages in the writings of his son Eugene. It was on the evening of September 13th that these advances first passed the outworks of formal civility. \"When bidding the said Mary Almira good-night in the sitting-room of Mrs. French, as he was about to retire into his lodgings, Roswell plucked a leaf from the rosebush in the room, kissed it, and presented it to her; on the next day when he saw the said Mary Almira she took from her bosom a paper, unfolded it, and showed Roswell a leaf (the same, he supposes, that was presented the evening before), neatly stitched on the paper, and which she again carefully folded and replaced in her bosom.\"  Another evening they played at chess, and with her permission Roswell named the queen Miss Almira, and he bent all his energies to the capture of that particular piece. He sacrificed every point of the game to that object, and when it was triumphantly achieved, \"took note of the pleasure and delight manifested by said Mary Almira at the ardor with which he pursued his object and kissed his prize.\" On still another occasion \"Jeremiah was introduced into the game as a black bishop, but very soon was exchanged for a pawn.\"  On the day when Roswell advised Mary that it would be imprudent for her to accompany Justice Jonathan to Westminster, she was \"graciously pleased to make, with her own fair hand, a pocket pin-cushion of blue silk and to put the same into Roswell's hands, at the same time remarking that blue was the emblem of love and constancy,\" and Roswell \"confesses that he received the same with a profound bow.\"  They were now in the rapids, with Jeremiah forgotten on the bank.  Roswell complimented \"the beauty of said Almira's hair, whereupon she graciously consented to present him with a lock of the same, and he humbly confesses that he accepted, kissed, and pressed it to his heart.\"  Next morning, as they stood side by side, with Roswell holding her hand \"and carelessly turning over the leaves of a Bible,\" his eye accidentally rested on this passage of the book of Jeremiah: \"As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.\" And \"thereupon he pointed out such text to said Mary Almira, and she responded to "]]]
