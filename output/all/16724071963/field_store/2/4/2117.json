I could almost think that I saw him staring with mouth agape as would a silly thrall; for so well had he taken the thrall's part that had I not known who was speaking all the time, I had certainly had no doubt that one was there.  \"Come to Hodulf, the king, and pray for freedom and your gold as a boon of his goodness, saying naught else, or making what tale you will of a hard master, or justice, so that you speak naught of what you have done, and that---and maybe more---shall be granted.\"  \"You yourself will speak for me?\"  \"I am the king---and think not that the darkness will prevent my knowing your face again,\" Hodulf replied.  There was a threat in the words, and with them he turned his horse and rode away quickly northwards. I heard the hoofs of his men's horses rattle on the road as they joined him, before he had gone far.  When the sounds died away altogether, and there was no fear of his coming back suddenly on us, my father whistled and I joined him. He almost started to find how near I was.  \"You have heard all, then?\" he said.  \"Every word,\" I answered, \"and I like it not. Where is this sack he spoke of?\"  It lay at his feet. A large sack it was, and full of somewhat heavy and warm that seemed to move a little when I put my hand on it. Still less did I like the business as I felt that.  \"More also!\" quoth my father, as if thinking of the king's last words. \"If that does not mean a halter for my neck, I am mistaken. What have we here, son, do you think?\"  \"Somewhat that should not be here, certainly,\" I answered. \"There would not be so much talk about drowning a dog, as one might think this to be.\"  \"Unless it were his wife's,\" answered my father, with a laugh.  Then he stooped, and I helped him to get the sack on his shoulders. It was heavy, but not very---not so heavy as a young calf in a sack would be; and he carried it easily, taking my spear to help him.  \"The thrall is even going to take this to the house of Grim the merchant, whom the king will not know again, though he may see in the dark,\" said he; \"then we shall know how we stand.\"  We met no one on our way back, for the town had gone to sleep, until the watchman passed the time of night with us, thinking no doubt that we had fish or goods in the burden. And when we came home a sleepy thrall opened to us, for all were at rest save him. And he too went his way to the shed where his place was when he had stirred the fire to a blaze and lit a torch that we might see to eat the supper that was left for us.  Then we were alone, and while I set Arngeir's weapons in a corner, my father put down the sack, and stood looking at it. It seemed to sway a little, and to toss as it settled down. And now that there was light it was plain that the shape of what was inside it was strangely like that of a child, doubled up with knees to chin, as it showed through the sacking.  \"Hodulf or no Hodulf,\" said my father, \"I am going to see more of this.\"  With that he took a knife from the table and cut the cord that fastened the mouth, turning back the sack quickly.  And lo! gagged and bound hand and foot in such wise that he could not move, in the sack was a wondrously handsome boy of about the size of Withelm; and for all his terrible journey across the king's saddle, and in spite of our rough handling, his eyes were bright and fearless as he looked up at us.  \"Radbard,\" said my father, \"what if Hodulf had met with a thrall who had done his bidding in truth?\"  I would not think thereof, for surely by this time there had been no light in the eyes that seemed to me to be grateful to us.  Now my father knelt down by the boy's side, and began to take the lashings from him, telling him at the same time to be silent when the gag was gone.  And hard work enough the poor child had to keep himself from screaming when his limbs were loosed, so cramped was he, for he had been bound almost into a ball. And even as we rubbed and chafed the cold hands and feet he swooned with the pain of the blood running freely once more.  \"This is a business for mother,\" said my father, on that; \"get your supper, and take it to bed with you, and say naught to the boys in the morning. This is a thing that may not be talked of.\"  Now I should have liked to stay, but my father meant what he said, and I could be of no more use; so I took my food, and went up to the loft where we three slept, and knew no more of what trouble that night might have for others.       CHAPTER III. HAVELOK, SON OF GUNNAR.  Now after I had gone, Grim, my father, tried to bring the child round, but he could not do so; and therefore, leaving him near the fire, he went softly to call Leva, my mother, to help him; and all the while he was wondering who the child might be, though indeed a fear that he knew only too well was growing in his heart, for there would surely he only one whom Hodulf could wish out of his way.  As he opened the door that led to the sleeping room beyond the high seat, the light shone on Leva, and showed her sitting up in bed with wide eyes that seemed to gaze on somewhat that was terrible, and at first he thought her awake. But she yet slept, and so he called her gently, and she started and woke.  \"Husband, is that you?\" she said. \"I had a strange dream even now which surely portends somewhat.\"  Now, as all men know, our folk in the north are most careful in the matter of attending to dreams, specially those that come in troubled times, holding that often warning or good counsel comes from them. I cannot say that I have ever had any profit in that way myself, being no dreamer at all; but it is certain that others have, as may be seen hereafter. Wherefore my father asked Leva what this dream might be.  \"In my dream,\" she answered, \"it seemed that you came into the house bearing a sack, which you gave into my charge, saying that therein lay wealth and good fortune for us. And I would not believe this, for you said presently that to gain this the sack and all that was therein was to be thrown into the sea, which seemed foolishness. Whereon I cast it into a corner in anger, and thereout came pitiful cries and wailings. Then said I that it were ill to drown aught that had a voice as of a child, and so you bade me leave it. Then I seemed to sleep here; but presently in my dream I rose and looked on the sack again, and lo! round about it shone a great light, so that all the place was bright, and I was afraid. Then you came and opened the sack, and therein was a wondrous child, from whose mouth came a flame, as it were the shaft of a sunbeam, that stretched over all Denmark, and across the sea to England, whereby I knew that this child was one who should hereafter be king of both these lands. And on this I stared even as you woke me.\"  Now Grim was silent, for this was passing strange, and moreover it fitted with his thought of who this child might be, since Hodulf. would make away with him thus secretly.  \"What make you of the dream?\" asked Leva, seeing that he pondered on it.  \"It is in my mind that your dream will come true altogether, for already it has begun to do so,\" he answered. \"Rise and come into the hall, and I will show you somewhat.\"  On that Leva made haste and dressed and came out, and there, lying as if in sleep before the fire, was the wondrous child of her dream, and the sack was under his head as he lay; and she was wont to say to those few who knew the story, that the kingliness of that child was plain to be seen, as had been the flame of which she had dreamed, so that all might know it, though the clothes that he wore were such as a churl might be ashamed of.  Then she cried out a little, but not loudly, and knelt by the child to see him the better; and whether he had come to himself before and had dropped asleep for very weariness, or out of his swoon had passed into sleep, I cannot say, but at her touch he stirred a little.  \"What child is this? and how came he here?\" she asked, wondering.  \"Already your dream has told you truly how he came,\" Grim answered, \"but who he is I do not rightly know yet. Take him up and bathe him, wife; and if he is the one I think him, there will be a mark whereby we may know him.\"  \"How should he be marked? And why look you to find any sign thus?\"  But Grim had turned down the rough shirt and bared the child's neck and right shoulder, whereon were bruises that made Leva well-nigh weep as she saw them, for it was plain that he had been evilly treated for many days before this. But there on the white skin was the mark of the king's line---the red four-armed cross with bent ends which Gunnar and all his forebears had borne.  Seeing that, Leva looked up wondering in her husband's face, and he answered the question that he saw written in her eyes.  \"He is as I thought---he is Havelok, the son of Gunnar, our king. Hodulf gave him to me that I might drown him.\"  Then he told her all that had happened, and how from the first time that he had lifted the sack and felt what was within it he had feared that this was what was being done. Hodulf would have no rival growing up beside him, and as he dared not slay him openly, he would have it thought that he had been stolen away by his father's friends, and then folk would maybe wait quietly in hopes that he would come again when time went on.  Now Leva bathed Havelok in the great tub, and with the warmth and comfort of the hot water he waked and was well content, so that straightway, when he was dressed in Withelm's holiday clothes, which fitted him, though he was but seven years old at this time, and Withelm was a well-grown boy enough for his ten winters, he asked for food, and they gave him what was yet on the board; and we lived well in Denmark.  \"There is no doubt that he hath a kingly hunger,\" quoth Grim as he watched him.  \"Friend,\" said Havelok, hearing this, though it was not meant for his ears, \"it is likely, seeing that this is the third day since I have had food given me. And "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12847"],["title","Havelok the Dane: A Legend of Old Grimsby and Lincoln (#5)"],["body","thank you, good people, though I would have you know that it is the custom to serve the king's son kneeling.\"  \"How should we know that you are the king's son indeed?\" asked Grim.  \"I am Havelok, son of Gunnar,\" the boy said gravely. \"Yon traitor, Hodulf, has slain my father, and my two sisters, and driven out my mother, whither I cannot tell, and now he would drown me.\"  Then the boy could hardly keep a brave front any longer, and he added, \"Yet I do not think that you will do to me as I heard him bid you.\"  Then came over Grim a great pity and sorrow that it should seem needful thus to sue to him, and there grew a lump in his throat, so that for a while he might not answer, and the boy thought him in doubt, so that in his eyes there was a great fear. But Leva wept outright, and threw herself on her knees beside him, putting her arms round him as he sat, speaking words of comfort.  Then Grim knelt also, and said, \"Thralls of yours are we, Havelok, son of Gunnar, and for you shall our lives be given before Hodulf shall harm you. Nor shall he know that you live until the day comes when you can go to him sword in hand and helm on head, with half the men of this realm at your back, and speak to him of what he did and what he planned, and the vengeance that shall be therefor.\"  So Grim took on himself to be Havelok's foster-father, and, as he ended, the boy said with glowing eyes, \"I would that I were grown up. How long shall this be before it comes to pass?\"  And then of a sudden he said, as a tired child will, \"Friends, I am sorely weary. Let me sleep.\"  So Leva took him in her arms and laid him in their own bed; and at once he slept, so that she left him and came back to Grim by the fireside, for there was much to be said.  First of all it was clear that Havelok must be hidden, and it was not to be supposed that Hodulf would be satisfied until he had seen the thrall to whom he had trusted such a secret come back for his reward. If he came not he would be sought; and then he would find out to whom he had spoken, and there would be trouble enough.  But it seemed easy to hide Havelok on board the ship, and sail with him to England as soon as possible. A few days might well pass before a thrall could get to Hodulf, so that he would suspect nothing just at first. There were merchants in England who would care for the boy well, and the two boats might be sunk, so that the king should not ask whose they were. So when Grim came home again the fisher would be thought of as drowned on his errand, and Hodulf would be content.  But then, after a little talk of this, it was plain that all the town could not be told to say that the fisher was drowned on such a night, and Hodulf would leave naught undone to find the truth of the matter. So the puzzle became greater, and the one thing that was clear was that Grim was in sore danger, and Havelok also.  Then suddenly outside the dogs barked, and a voice which they obeyed quieted them. Grim sprang for his axe, which hung on the wall, and went to the door, whereon someone was knocking gently.  \"Open, uncle; it is I, Arngeir.\"  \"What does the boy want at this time?\" said Grim, taking down the great bar that kept the door, axe in hand, for one must be cautious in such times as these.  Arngeir came in---a tall young man of twenty, handsome, and like Grim in ways, for he was his brother's son.  \"Lucky am I in finding you astir,\" he said. \"I thought I should have had to wake you all. Are you just home from sea, or just going out?\"  \"Not long home,\" answered Leva; \"but what has brought you?\"  \"I have a guest for you, if I may bring one here at this hour.\"  \"A friend of yours never comes at the wrong time,\" Grim said. \"Why not bring him in?\"  \"If it were a friend of mine and a man he would do well enough at my house for the night,\" said Arngeir, smiling; \"but the one for whom I have come is a lady, and, I think, one in sore trouble.\"  \"Who is she?\" asked my mother, wondering much.  \"From the king's town, certainly,\" answered Arngeir, \"but I do not know her name. Truth to tell, I forgot to ask it, for she is sorely spent; and so I made haste to come to you.\"  Then Leva would know how a lady came at this time to Arngeir's house, for he was alone, save for his four men, being an orphan without other kin beside us, and his house was close to our shipyard and the sea.  \"She came not to me, but I found her,\" he replied. \"My horse is sick, and I must get up an hour ago and see to it for the second time tonight. Then as I came from the stable I saw someone go towards the shipyard, and, as I thought, into the open warehouse. It was dark, and I could not tell then if this was man or woman; but I knew that no one had business there, and there are a few things that a thief might pick up. So I took an axe and one of the dogs, and went to see what was on hand, but at first there was naught to be found of anyone. If it had not been for the dog, I think that I should have gone away, but he went into the corner where the bales of wool are set, and there he whined strangely, and when I looked, there was this lady on the bales, and she was weeping and sore afraid. So I asked her what was amiss, and it was not easy to get an answer at first. But at last she told me that she had escaped from the burning of the king's town, and would fain be taken across the sea into some place of peace. So I cheered her by saying that you would surely help her; and then I took her to my house and came to you. Worn and rent are her garments, but one may see that they have been rich, and I deem her some great lady.\"  \"Go and bring her here, husband,\" said my mother, on hearing that.  But he was already going, and at once he and Arngeir went out and down the street. There were many other ladies and their children who had taken refuge here with the townsfolk after the burning, and the coming of this one was but another count in the long tale of trouble that began on the Welsh shore with the ways of Gunnar, the church's bane.  My father was long gone, and the day was breaking when he came back. My mother slept in the great chair before the fire, for waiting had wearied her, but she woke as she heard Grim's footstep, and unbarred the door to him, ready to welcome the guest that she looked for. But he was alone, and on his face was the mark of some new trouble, and that a great one.  He came in and barred the door after him, and then sat down wearily and ate for the first time since we had had our meal at sea; and while he did so Leva asked him nothing, wondering what was wrong, but knowing that she would hear in good time. And when he had eaten well he spoke.  \"The lady is Eleyn the queen. She has been wandering for these many days from place to place, sometimes in the woods, and sometimes in hiding in the cottages of the poor folk, always with a fear of staying in one place, lest Hodulf should find her, for it is known that he is seeking her. Then at last one told her of my ship, and she is here to seek me.\"  Now one may know what the wonder and pity of my mother was, and she would fain have gone to her. But Grim had left her at Arngeir's house, for folk were stirring in the town, and there were many who would know the queen if they saw her.  \"It will soon be known that Arngeir has a guest,\" my mother said, \"whereas none would have wondered had she been here.\"  \"By this time tomorrow it will not matter if Hodulf knows,\" answered Grim, \"for she will be safe.\"  \"Where will you hide her then and what of Havelok?\"  \"For those two there is no safety but across the sea, and they are the most precious cargo that I shall ever have carried. Already Arngeir and the men are at work on the ship, getting the rollers under her keel, that she may take the water with the next tide. I shall sail with the tide that comes with the darkness again, saying that I shall find cargo elsewhere in other ports, as I have done once before.\"  \"I had not looked to say farewell to you quite so soon,\" my mother said; \"but this is right. Now I will have all things ready, that the queen shall be in what comfort she may on the voyage. But it will be well that none shall know, even of your seamen, who the passengers are, else will word go to Hodulf in some way hereafter that Havelok has escaped.\"  \"I have thought of that,\" answered Grim. \"It will be best that none, not even Radbard, shall know who this is whom we have in the house. A chance word goes far sometimes.\"  \"The boy will tell his name.\"  \"There are many who are named after him, and that is no matter. Do you speak to him, for it is plain that he has sense enough, and bid him say naught but that he and his mother have escaped from the town, and, if you will, that he escaped in the sack. I will speak to Radbard, and there will be no trouble. Only Arngeir must know the truth, and that not until we are on the high seas perhaps.\"  So there seemed to be no more fear, and in an hour the house was astir, and there was work enough for all in preparing for the voyage. As for me, I went down to the ship with my father, and worked there.  Now, I will say that not for many a long year did I know who this foster-brother of mine was. It was enough for me to be told that he was the son of some great man or other with whom Hodulf had a private feud. Nor did I ever speak of that night's work to any, for my father bade me not to do so. Presently I knew, of course, that the lady was Havelok's mother; but that told me nothing, for I never heard her name.  We worked at the ship for three hours or so, stowing the bales of wool and the other little cargo we had; and then my father sent me to the fishing-boats for a pair of oars belonging to the ship's boat that were there, and, as it fell out, it was a good thing that I and not one of the men went. When I came to the place where they were drawn up on the beach, as we had left them last night, there was a stranger talking to some of the fisher folk, who were working at their"]]]
