For a full half minute Lieutenant Cantor stared at his subordinate in speechless anger.  Then, when he could command his voice somewhat, he resumed:  \"Oh, very good, you---you young---puppy!\"  Another brief interval of silence, and the lieutenant continued, in a crisp, official tone:  \"Mr. Darrin, go to the division bulletin board and get an accurate copy of the roster of the division.  Also make a copy of our station bills.  You will then report to me on the quarter deck just before eight bells, noon.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir!  Any further orders?\"  \"None!\"  Cantor stood there, an appealing look in his eyes, but Dave, saluting, turned on his heel and went out.  \"So that is the fellow who is to teach me the duties and the ideals of the service,\" Dave Darrin reflected, disgustedly, as he stepped briskly around to port.  \"A magnificent prospect ahead of me, if I must depend upon the instructions and the official favor of a bully and a scoundrel like Cantor!  And he can make it hot for me, too, if he has a mind to do so!  Don't I know how easy that ought to be for him?  I shall have, indeed, a lot of pleasure in my service on this ship, with Cantor for my division officer!\"  Mindful of orders, Darrin's first act was to copy the division roster and the station bills.  These he took to his room, placing them in a drawer of the desk, for future study.  For the present, he wanted to get out into the open air.  Though Ensign Dalzell had been directed to report on the quarter deck, he was not now there.  Dave walked about by himself until Lieutenant Trent came over and spoke to him.  \"Dalzell is busy, I suppose, sir?\" Dave inquired.  \"Forward and below, directing the stowage of stores,\" replied Trent.  \"Have you been detailed to a division yet, Mr. Darrin?\"  \"Yes, sir; to Lieutenant Cantor's division.\"  \"Ah, so?\" inquired Trent.  He did not say more, from which Dave wondered if Trent did not like Cantor.  If such were the case, then Darrin's opinion of Lieutenant Trent would run all the higher.  \"Cantor is a very efficient officer,\" Trent said, after a pause, not long enough to be construed unfavorably.  Dave did not answer this, for he could think of nothing to say.  \"Some of our newest youngsters haven't wholly liked him,\" Trout went on, with a smile.  \"I fancy that perhaps he works them a bit too grillingly.\"  \"After four years at the Naval Academy,\" smiled Ensign Darrin, \"it puzzles me to understand how any officer can resent grilling.\"  \"You'll find life very different on one of these big ships,\" Lieutenant Trout continued.  \"You will soon begin to realize that we are in a cramped atmosphere.  With fifteen hundred officers and men abroad there is barely elbow room at any time, and sometimes not that.\"  \"This ship looks big enough to carry a small city full of people,\" Darrin smiled.  \"See here!\" Trent stepped to the starboard rail, looking forward.  \"Just look ahead, and see the magnificent distance to the bow,\" continued the officer of the deck.  \"We call a ship 'she,' Darrin, and let me assure you, 'she' is some girl!  Look at the magnificent length and breadth.  Yet, when we are at sea, you will soon begin to realize how cramped the life is.\"  After chatting a little longer with Lieutenant Trent, Ensign Darrin started forward along the decks, taking in all he could see of this huge, floating castle.  Presently he returned to the quarter-deck, but Lieutenant Trent was busy with a lieutenant of the marine guard.  Dave stepped inside.  Almost immediately he heard a step at his side.  Glancing around, Dave looked into the face of Lieutenant Cantor.  \"A while ago I noticed you talking with Trent,\" Dave's division officer remarked, in a low voice.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Did you discuss me?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"What did you say, Darrin?\"  \"I mentioned that you were my division officer.\"  \"Did Trent say anything?\"  \"Mr. Trent said that you were a very efficient officer.\"  \"Did you tell him anything---about---er---about last night?\"  \"Nothing,\" Dave answered.  \"Positive about that?\" insinuated Cantor.  \"Sir,\" Dave answered, \"I am an officer and, I trust---a gentleman.\"  \"Then you told Trent nothing about last night?\"  \"I have already told you, sir, that I didn't.\"  \"Nor to anyone else on this ship?\" pressed the lieutenant.  \"I told Dalzell, last night, that I had met with a stranger who was-----\"  \"That will do!\" snapped Cantor.  \"Very good, sir.\"  \"Have you told Dalzell about me since coming aboard?\"  \"I have not.\"  \"And you won't?\" pressed Cantor.  \"On that point, sir, I decline to pledge myself,\" Darrin responded, with unusual stiffness.  \"Darrin, do you want to make an enemy?\"  \"Mr. Cantor, I never, at any time, wish to make an enemy.  I am not trying to make one of you.\"  \"I will regard that as a promise from you,\" returned Cantor, then moved quickly away.  \"It would have been better,\" murmured Darrin, softly, turning and regarding the moving figure, \"if you had heard me out.  However, Mr. Cantor, though you are not now here to hear me say it, I did not promise silence.  Yet it is difficult to conceive what would make me open my mouth on the subject of last night's happening. I have never been a tale-bearer, and, much as I may despise that fellow, and the affront that he offers the Navy, in remaining in the service, I fancy his secret is safe from all---except Dalzell. Danny and I haven't yet begun to have secrets from each other.\"  Presently Dan Dalzell, wearing his sword and pulling on his white gloves as he came, appeared, walking aft.  There was time only for a smiling nod, for Dave suddenly remembered, with a start that it was time for him to report for change of watch.  Hastening down the passage-way Dave hung his sword on, then hastily rummaged the suit case for a pair of white gloves that he had previously tucked in there.  Hastening, he reached the deck just as the watch was being changed. With quick step Ensign Darrin took his momentary post.  Then, when the old watch had gone off duty, Lieutenant Cantor turned to his subordinate with a frown.  \"Ensign Darrin, you made a bad beginning, sir,\" declared the new watch officer, crisply.  \"In the future, I trust you will be more mindful of the responsibility of an officer in setting his men an example in punctuality.  If this occurs again, sir, I shall feel it my duty to turn in report of your negligence!\"  Several men of the watch and two of the marine guard hoard this rebuke administered.  Dave Darrin's face flushed, then paled from the humiliation of the rebuke.  Yet he had been guilty of an actual breach of discipline, minor though it was, and could not dispute Cantor's right to reprove him.  \"I very much regret my negligence, sir,\" Dave answered, saluting, but he bit his lip in the same instant for he realized how thoroughly his superior officer enjoyed the privilege of administering the rebuke.  From inside Dan Dalzell heard the words.  At once, on the stroke of eight bells, the mess signal was hung to the breeze.  While that flag flew no one was admitted to the battleship unless he belonged on board.  Then appeared a little Filipino mess servant, who asked Dave and Dan to follow him to their assigned seats.  \"Am I permitted to go to mess, sir?\" Dave asked of Lieutenant Cantor.  \"Yes,\" was the short answer.  While the signal flew the sergeant of the marine guard was in charge at the quarter-deck gang plank.  There was no need of a commissioned officer there.  To their delight Darrin and Dalzell found themselves assigned to seats at the table together.  Lieutenant Trent stepped down, introducing the new arrivals to the officers beside whom, and opposite whom they sat.  \"I was sorry to hear you get that calling down,\" Dalzell whispered to his chum, as soon as that was possible under the cover of the conversation of others.  \"Why did Lieutenant Cantor seem to enjoy his privilege so much?\"  After a covert glance, to make sure that he was not in danger of being overheard, Darrin replied, in an undertone:  \"Lieutenant Cantor was the man of whom I told you last night.\"  \"Not the-----\"  \"Yes,\" Dave nodded.  \"But it seems incredible that an officer of our Navy could be guilty of any such conduct,\" Dalzell gasped, his eyes large with amazement.  \"Are you sure?\"  \"Didn't you notice the welt on Mr. Cantor's cheek?\" Dave asked, dryly.  Danny Grin nodded, then fell silent over his plate.  After the meal Lieutenant Trent saw to it that both the new ensigns were introduced to such officers as they had not met already.  \"We can't possibly remember all their names---scores of 'em!\" gasped Dan, as the two young officers stood outside the mess.  \"We'll learn every name and face before very long,\" Darrin answered. \"But I mustn't stand talking,\" Dave went on, as he again hung his sword at his side.  \"I'm on duty, and can't stand another call-down.\"  \"Are you going to tell what Cantor did last night?\" Dan queried.  \"No; and don't you tell, either!\"  \"Small fear of my babbling _your_ business, David, little Giant!\" assured Dalzell.  \"You are strong enough to go in and slay your own Goliath.\"  Drawing on his white gloves, Dave Darrin stepped alertly to the quarter deck, to find himself facing the frown of Lieutenant Cantor.     CHAPTER III  THE JUNIOR WORM TURNS   \"Wonder what my man has in store for me?\" flashed through Dave's mind, as he saluted his division commander.  But Cantor, after returning the salute, merely turned away to pace the deck.  Presently, however, the lieutenant stepped over to Darrin, when the pair had the quarterdeck to themselves.  \"Are you going to tell me?\" murmured the lieutenant, his burning gaze on the frank young face before him.  \"Tell you what, sir?\" Dave asked.  \"That taxicab"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12776"],["title","Dave Darrin at Vera Cruz: Fighting with the U.S. Navy in Mexico (#4)"],["body","mber?\"  \"No, sir!\"  \"Think!\"  \"When I have decided that a given course of conduct is the only course possible to a gentleman,\" Ensign Darrin replied, \"I have no further occasion to give thought to that subject.\"  \"Darrin, you might make me your friend!\" urged his superior officer.  \"That would be delightful, sir.\"  \"Darrin, don't try to be ironical with me!\"  Dave remained silent.  \"If you don't care for me for your friend, Darrin,\" Cantor warned him, \"it is possible, on the other hand, to make an enemy of me. As an enemy you would not find me wanting either in resource or opportunity.\"  \"Have you any orders for me, sir?\" asked Darrin, coolly.  That was as near as he could come, courteously, to informing Cantor that he wished from him none but official communications.  \"Pardon me, sir,\" said Cantor, and stepped away to salute Commander Bainbridge, who had just appeared on the quarter-deck.  There was a low-toned conversation between the two officers.  Then, as the pair exchanged salutes, and Bainbridge went on to the captain's quarters, Lieutenant Cantor came back to his selected victim.  \"Darrin, you will go below and finish the watch, loading stores in the number four hold.  I will pass the word for the petty officer who will have charge under you, and he will show you to the hold. If you wish you may put on dungarees, for it is rough work down there.\"  \"My baggage has not come aboard, sir,\" Dave replied.  \"This is the only uniform I have.\"  In his perturbed state of mind, it did not occur to the young ensign that he could draw dungarees---the brown overall suit that is worn by officers and crew alike when doing rough work about the ship, from the stores, nor did Cantor appear to notice his reply.  The messenger came, and brought Riley, the coxswain of one of the gigs.  \"Coxswain, Ensign Darrin will take charge of the shipping of the stores in number four hold,\" Cantor announced.  \"Show him the way to the hold and receive his instructions.\"  Dave was speedily engaged between decks, in charge of tire work of some twenty men of the crew.  At the hatch above, a boatswain's mate had charge of the lowering of the stores.  \"It would be a pity to spoil your uniform, sir,\" declared Coxswain Riley.  \"If you'll allow me, sir, I'll spare you all of the dirtiest work.\"  \"To shirk my duty would be a bad beginning of my service on this ship,\" smiled Darrin.  \"Thank you, Coxswain, but I'll take my share of the rough work.\"  The hold was close and stifling.  Although a cool breeze was blowing on deck, there was little air in number two hold.  In ten minutes Darrin found himself bathed in perspiration.  Dust from barrels and packing cases hung heavy in that confined space.  The grime settled on his perspiring face and stuck there.  \"Look out, sir, or you'll get covered with pitch from some of these barrels,\" Riley warned Dave, respectfully.  \"One uniform spoiled is nothing,\" Dave answered with a smile. \"Do not be concerned about me.\"  Officer and men were suffering alike in that close atmosphere. By the time the watch was ended Dave Darrin was truly a pitchy, soiled, perspiration-soaked sight.  Danny Grin, who reported to relieve his chum, looked rough and ready enough in a suit of dungarees that he had drawn.  \"I should have had brains enough to remember that I, too, could have drawn dungarees,\" Dave grunted, as he and his chum exchanged salutes.  Then the relieved young officer hastened above to report the completion of his duty to his division commander, who would be furious if kept waiting.  Dave glanced toward Cantor's quarters, then realized that the lieutenant must still be on the quarter deck.  In his haste to be punctual, Darrin forgot his sword and white gloves, which he had left in his own cabin on the way to duty between decks.  Without these appurtenances of duty on the quarter-deck, Darrin made haste aft, found his division commander, saluted and reported his relief.  \"Mr. Darrin,\" boomed Cantor, in a tone of high displeasure, \"don't you know that an officer reporting to the quarter-deck when in any but dungaree clothes, should wear his gloves and sword.  Go and get them, sir---and don't keep me waiting beyond my watch time when I have shore leave!\"  Again red-faced and humiliated, Ensign Darrin saluted, wheeled, made haste to his quarters, then returned wearing sword and gloves. This time he saluted and made his report in proper form.  \"Mr. Darrin,\" said his division officer, scathingly, \"this is the second time to-day that I have had to teach you the things you should have learned in your first week at Annapolis.  You are making a bad beginning, sir.\"  Dave saluted, but this time did not answer in words.  \"You may go, Mr. Darrin, and hereafter I trust to find in you a more attentive and clear-headed officer.\"  Lieutenant Cantor did not hold his tone low.  It is the privilege of an officer to rebuke an enlisted man publicly, and as severely as the offense warrants, and it is the further privilege of an officer to make his rebuke to a subordinate commissioned officer as sharp and stinging as he chooses.  Saluting, without a word, Darrin wheeled and walked to his quarters.  \"Cantor will certainly have abundant opportunity to make things warm for me,\" reflected Darrin, as he sat down before the desk in his cabin.  \"I wonder what I am to do, in order to keep my self-respect and keep my hands off the fellow.  It would probably end my career in the Navy if I struck him on this ship.\"  For some minutes Darrin sat in a rather dejected frame of mind, reviewing his first acquaintance with this official cur, and the things that had happened on shipboard since.  \"I suppose I could ask for a different detail,\" Dave mused, forlornly. \"Undoubtedly, though, I wouldn't get the detail, unless I gave what were considered sufficiently good reasons, and I can't tell tales on my division commander, cur though I know him to be.\"  In the passage outside, sounded passing footsteps and a laugh. Dave felt his face flush, for he recognized the voice of Lieutenant Cantor.  \"Danny Grin is a good chum,\" reflected Darrin, \"but in this affair he can't advise me any better than I can advise myself.  I wish I could talk freely with some older officer, who knows shipboard life better.  But if I were to go to any older officer with such a tale as I have, it would-----\"  \"In, Mr. Darrin?\" sounded a cheery voice, and Commander Bainbridge, the executive officer, stood in the doorway, bringing young Darrin to his feet in prompt salute.  \"I was passing, Darrin, and so I called,\" announced the executive officer.  \"Otherwise, I would have summoned you to my office. Lieutenant Cantor has secured shore leave until eleven o'clock to-night.  As we are busy aboard, Mr. Cantor's division is due for watch duty at eight bells this evening.  As Mr. Cantor has shore leave you will report as officer of the deck until relieved by Lieutenant Cantor on his return to the ship.  At any time between now and four bells report at my office and sign for these instructions.\"  \"Aye, aye, sir.\"  Returning the ensign's salute, the executive officer next regarded Darrin's untidy appearance with some displeasure.  \"Mr. Darrin,\" Commander Bainbridge continued, \"I note that you must have been on hard duty.  No officer, after being relieved, is entitled to retain an untidy appearance longer than is necessary. You should have bathed, sir, and attired yourself becomingly. Neatness is the first requisite in the service.\"  \"I shall be glad to do that sir,\" Dave answered, respectfully, \"as soon as my baggage comes aboard.  At present this is the only uniform I have.\"  \"That alters the case, Mr. Darrin,\" replied the executive officer, kindly.  \"In case, however, your baggage does not arrive between now and dinner-time, you will not be warranted in going to the ward-room, unless you can borrow a uniform that fits you as well as one of your own.\"  \"I shall be very careful on that point, sir,\" Dave answered, respectfully, with another salute, returning which Commander Bainbridge departed.  Ten minutes later Darrin's baggage was delivered.  In their proper places the young ensign hung his various uniforms, placed his shoes according to regulation, and stowed his linen and underclothing in the wardrobe drawers.  After this a most welcome bath followed.  Dave then dressed with care in a fresh blue uniform, stepped to the executive officer's office and signed for his evening orders.  There was time for fifteen minutes in the open air, after which Dave returned to his quarters to dress for dinner.  This done, he stepped outside, knowing that the summons to the wardroom would soon come.  At first Dave was the only officer at that point.  Commander Bainbridge soon joined him.  A desperate thought entering his mind, Dave addressed the commander as soon as his salute had been returned.  \"Sir, may I ask you a question connected with my own personal affairs?\" he asked.  \"Certainly,\" replied the executive officer.  \"I was wondering, sir, if it would be wise for me to seek counsel from an older officer if at any time I found myself threatened with trouble, or, at least, with unpleasantness.\"  \"It would be a very wise course on your part, Darrin,\" replied Commander Bainbridge, though he regarded the ensign's face with keen scrutiny.  \"An older officer should always esteem it a pleasure, as well as a duty, to advise a younger officer.  I take an interest in all the officers of this ship.  If there is anything in which I can advise you, you may command me.\"  \"Thank you, sir.  But, if you will permit me to frame an instance, if the advice that I asked of you might tend to prejudice you against one of your subordinate officers, would it be wiser for me to seek counsel of some officer not higher in rank than the officer whom I have just supposed?\"  \"That is to say, Mr. Darrin, that the advice you might otherwise wish to ask of me might be taken in the light of a complaint against an officer who is one of my "]]]
