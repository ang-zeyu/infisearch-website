Too long a story to tell in a minute.\"  \"I didn't mean to pry into your affairs, Ferrers,\" Tom made haste to say.  \"Well, for one thing, Dolph Gage shot the only brother I ever had---and got cleared of the charge in the court!\" muttered Ferrers.  \"Was your brother killed?\" Tom inquired.  \"Didn't I state that Dolph Gage shot him?\" demanded Jim in a semi-injured tone.  \"Men don't often waste ammunition out in this county, even if I did send in three wild shots just now.  But that was because I was excited, and couldn't see straight.  I'll try to do better next time.\"  Mr. Dunlop was now engaged in making his daughter, her child and the other woman comfortable in one of the touring cars.  Several of the men in the party, also, had decided that they did not care to remain if they were to be exposed to shooting at all hours of the day.  In the end Mr. Dunlop had but three of the men in his party left with him.  The younger of the two armed men was sent to drive the car containing the women.  One of the guests of the Dunlop party drove a second car.  In this order they started for Dugout City, thirty miles away.  As the roads hardly deserved the name the motor cars would not be likely to reach Dugout before dark.  \"Look out for ambushes,\" exclaimed Mr. Dunlop, to the armed driver of the women's car.  \"Yes, sir; but there isn't much danger of our being fired on.  Gage's gang will be only too glad to see the women folks leaving here.  We won't be troubled.\"  Mr. Dunlop stood anxiously gazing after the two touring cars as long as they could be seen.  Then he stepped briskly back, holding out his hand to Tom Reade.  \"Permit me, now, to thank you for your timely aid,\" said the stout man.  \"You know my name.  Will you kindly introduce your friends?\"  This Tom did at once, after which Mr. Dunlop presented his three companions.  One was his nephew, Dave Hill, the second, George Parkinson, Mr. Dunlop's secretary, and the third a man named John Ransome, an investor in Mr. Dunlop's mining enterprise.  The elder of the armed men who remained behind was Joe Timmins, both guide and chauffeur.  The young man who had gone with one of the cars was Timmins's son.  \"You have a mining claim hereabouts, Mr. Dunlop?\" Tom inquired.  \"Yes; but not exactly at this point,\" added the older man, with a smile as he noted Reade staring about him with a quizzical smile. \"The claim stands over there on that slope\"--- pointing to the westward.  \"Has it been prospected, sir?\" asked Hazelton.  \"Yes: it's a valuable property, all right.  I brought my party out here to show it to them.  The friends who have returned to Dugout, and Mr. Ransome here, have the money ready to put up the needed capital as soon as they are satisfied.\"  \"I'm satisfied now,\" spoke up Ransome, \"and I'm sure that the others are, after what Mr. Dunlop showed us this morning.\"  \"How soon do you begin operations?\" Tom asked with interest.  \"As soon as my men have talked it over and have concluded to put up the money, replied Mr. Dunlop.  \"We're ready, now---all of us,\" Ransome broke in.  \"Then,\" said Mr. Dunlop, \"the next step will be to get in touch with a satisfactory engineer.  You see, Mr. Reade, it's either a tunneling or a boring claim.  We must either sink a shaft or drive a tunnel---whichever operation can be done at the least cost.  Either way will be expensive, and we must find out for a certainty which will be the cheaper.  There's a lot of refractory rock in the slope yonder.  In the morning our party will get all the ore we can from the surface croppings, then start for Dugout, going from there to Carson City.  At Carson we hope to find an honest engineer and a capable metallurgist.\"  \"Then you haven't engaged any engineer?\" Reade asked, almost eagerly.  \"Not yet.  There was no need, until we had satisfied the investors.\"  \"Perhaps Hazelton and I can make some deal with you, Mr. Dunlop,\" Reade proposed.  \"In what line?\" inquired Dunlop.  \"Are you miners---or machinists?\"  \"When we want to be really kind to ourselves,\" smiled Tom, \"we call ourselves engineers.\"  \"Mining engineers?\" demanded Mr. Dunlop, gazing at the two youths in astonishment.  \"No, sir.  Neither Hazelton nor myself ever handled a mine yet,\" Tom answered.  \"But we have done a lot of railroad work.\"  \"Railroad work isn't mine digging,\" objected Mr. Dunlop.  \"I'm aware of that, sir,\" Tom agreed.  \"Yet boring is largely excavation work; so is tunneling.  We've had charge of considerable excavating in our services to railroads.\"  \"Very likely,\" nodded Dunlop, reflectively.  But how about the assays for gold and silver?  Sometimes, when searching for drifts and runs of the metal we may need a dozen assays in a single week.\"  \"We have the furnace with us, sir; the assay balance and all the tools and chemicals that are used in an ordinary assay.\"  \"You have?\" asked Mr. Dunlop.  \"Then you must have come prepared to go into this line of work.\"  \"We thought it more than likely that we'd amuse ourselves along that line of work for a while,\" Tom explained truthfully.  \"Yet mining attracts us.  We'd stay here and go into the thing in earnest if we could make good enough terms with you.\"  \"Would seventy-five dollars a month for each of you be satisfactory?\" asked Mr. Dunlop keenly.  \"No, sir,\" replied Reade with emphasis.  \"Nor would we take a hundred and seventy-five dollars, either.  When I said that we would consider a good proposition I meant just that, sir.\"  \"Hm-m-m-m!\" murmured Mr. Dunlop.  \"I shall have to give this matter thought, and question you a good deal more on your qualifications. I suppose you would be willing to let this matter remain open for a few days?\"  \"Certainly, sir; we are in no hurry.  However, until we are definitely engaged we do not bind ourselves to be ready for your work.\"  \"Where is your camp?\" said Mr. Dunlop.  Jim Ferrers explained the easiest way of reaching the camp in a motor car.  \"And I'd advise you to come to our camp, too,\" Tom added.  \"You'll be safer there than here.\"  \"But we would; expose you to danger, too,\" Mr. Dunlop objected.  \"We're rather used to danger,\" smiled Tom placidly.  \"In fact, just a little of danger makes us feel that we're getting more enjoyment out of life.\"  \"Do you think it a good plan to take up the invitation of these gentlemen, Timmins?\" inquired Mr. Dunlop.  \"It's the safest thing you can do, sir,\" answered Joe Timmins.  \"We'll start back, now,\" proposed Tom.  \"If you don't drive too fast you'll give us a chance to reach our camp in time to welcome you.\"  \"You start now, and we'll start within ten minutes,\" proposed Mr. Dunlop.  This being agreed to, Tom, Harry and Ferrers began the task of climbing the cliff path.  At last they reached the top, then started at long strides toward camp, Ferrers's horse having been surrendered by Harry to Dave Hill.  \"Who knows,\" laughed Tom, \"we may become mining engineers here in Nevada\"  \"Small chance of it,\" Harry rejoined.  \"In opinion Mr. Dunlop is a good enough fellow, but he's accustomed to making all the money himself.  He'd want us at about a hundred dollars a month apiece.\"  \"He can want, then,\" Tom retorted.  \"Yet, somehow, I've an idea That Mr. Dunlop will turn to be generous if he decides that we're the engineers for him.\"  For some minutes the trio tramped on silently, in Indian file, Ferrers leading.  \"Hello, Alf!\" bellowed Tom through the woods, as they neared their camp site.  No answer came.  \"Where did you leave the little fellow, Jim?\" inquired Reade.  \"I didn't notice which way he went, sir,\" returned the guide. \"He looked plumb scared, and I reckon he ducked into cover somewhere. Maybe he headed for Dugout City and hasn't stopped running yet.\"  Then a turn of the path under the trees brought them in sight of their camp.  Rather, where the camp had been.  Jim Ferrers rubbed his eyes for an instant, for the tents had been spirited away as though by magic. Nor were the cots to be seen.  Blankets lay strewn about on the ground.  A quarter the camp's food supplies was still left, and that was all.  \"Is it magic, Jim?\" gasped puzzled Tom Reade.  \"No, sir; just plain stealing,\" Ferrers responded grimly.  \"Then who-----\"  \"Dolph Gage's crew, I'll be bound, sir.  They don't want you two hanging around in this country, and they want me a heap sight less.  But maybe we'll show 'em!  The trail can't be hard to find. We'll have to start at once.\"  \"After we've seen and spoken to Mr. Dunlop,\" Tom amended.  \"We can't run off without explanation to the guests that we have invited to share the camp that we thought had.\"  Barely a hundred yards away four men lay on their stomachs, heads concealed behind a low fringe of brush under which the muzzles of their rifles peeped.  \"Remember,\" whispered Dolph Gage faintly, \"all of you fire your first shot into Jim Ferrers.  After that we'll take charge of the youngsters!  Get a close bead on Jim.  Ready!\"     CHAPTER IV  SOLD OUT FOR A TOY BALE!   Jim Ferrers had stated a plain truth when he remarked that Nevada men did not often waste ammunition.  With four rifles aimed at him, at that short, point-blank range, it would seem that Jim's last moment had come.  Yet at that instant the sound of an approaching motor ear was heard.  Then the car, moving at twelve miles an hour mounted the crest at a point less than seventy yards from where the four ambushed men lay.  Joe Timmins caught sight of them.  \"Take the wheel!\" muttered Timmins, forcing Parkinson's nearer hand to the wheel.  In an instant Joe was upon his feet, drawing his revolver.  He fired at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12777"],["title","The Young Engineers in Nevada; Or, Seeking Fortune on the Turn of a Pick (#5)"],["body","in ambush, but a lurch of the car on the rough ground destroyed his aim.  \"Dolph Gage and his rascals at the ridge,\" bellowed Joe, in a fog-horn voice, pointing.  Jim Ferrers dropped to the ground, hugging it flat.  Harry followed suit.  Tom Reade hesitated an instant, then away he flew at a dead run.  Close to a tree Tom stopped, thrusting right hand in among the bushes.  Up and down his hand moved.  \"Shoot and duck!\" snarled Dolph, in a passion because of their having been discovered.  Boom!  Over by the ridge where Gage and his fellow rascals lay it looked as though a volcano had started in operation on a small scale.  Fragments of rock, clouds of dirt, splinters and bits of brush shot up in the air.  Following the report came a volley of terrific yells from Dolph and his fellows.  They had been on the instant of firing when the big explosion came.  Jim Ferrers, too, was taking careful aim at the moment.  It is a law of Nature that whatever goes up debris, mixed with larger pieces of rock and clots of earth, descended on the scene of the explosion.  Yet little of this flying stuff reached Dolph Gage and his companions, for they were up and running despite the mark that they thus presented to Ferrers.  Nor did the rascals stop running until they had reached distant cover.  \"Stop it, Jim---don't shoot!\" gasped Tom Reade, choking with laughter, as Ferrers leaped to his feet, taking aim after the fugitives.  \"I want Dolph Gage, while I've got a good, legal excuse,\" growled Ferrers, glancing along rifle barrel at the forward sight.  \"Don't think of shooting,\" panted Tom, darting forward and laying a hand on the rifle barrel to spoil the guide's aim.  \"Jim, it isn't sportsmanlike to shoot a fleeing enemy in the back!  Fight fair and square, Jim---if you must fight.\"  There was much in this to appeal to the guide's sense of honor and fair play.  Though scowled, he lowered the rifle.  \"Tom, you everlasting joker, what happened?\" demanded Harry Hazelton.  \"You saw for yourself, didn't you?\" retorted Reade.  \"Yes; but-----\"  \"Are you so little of an engineer that you don't know a _mine_ when you see one, Harry?\"  \"But how did that mine come to be there?\"  \"I planted it.\"  \"When?\"  \"Today, when you started on your ride.\"  \"Oh!\"  \"You see, Harry, I was pondering away over mining problems this morning.  As you had the only horse, that was all that there was left for me to do.  Now, you must have noticed that most of the outcropping rock around here is of a very refractory kind?\"  \"Yes,\" nodded Hazelton.  \"Then, of course, you realize that for at least a hundred feet down in the mine the rock that would be found would be the same.\"  \"Undoubtedly.\"  \"So, Harry, I was figuring on a way to blast ore rock out whenever we should find refractory stuff down a shaft or in the galleries or tunnels of a mine.\"  \"Fine, isn't it?\" retorted Hazelton.  \"A great scheme!  You blast out the rock and the force of the explosion shoots all the fine particle of gold into the walls of the mine---just the way you'd pepper a tree with birdshot!\"  Mr. Dunlop had drawn close and now stood smiling broadly.  \"That appears to be one on you, Reade,\" suggested the mine promoter.  \"That's what I want to find out,\" returned Tom soberly; \"whether I'm a discoverer, or just a plain fool.\"  \"What do you think about it?\"  \"Let's go and look at the ledge, and then I can tell you, sir,\" Reade answered, striding forward.  \"Look out!\" cautioned Joe Timmins.  \"Those hyenas will shoot. They'll be sore over the trick you played on them, and they'll be hiding waiting for a chance for a shot.\"  \"Oh, bother the hyenas,\" Tom retorted, impatiently.  \"I'm out for business today.  Coming, Mr. Dunlop?\"  The mine operator showed signs of hanging back.  Harry promptly joined his chum at what was left of the little ledge. After a few moments Mr. Dunlop, seeing that no shots were fired, stepped over there also, followed by his nephew.  Jim Ferrers climbed a tree, holding his rifle and keeping his eyes open for a shot, while Timmins threw himself behind a rock, watching in the direction that the four men had taken.  \"This looks even better than I had expected,\" Tom explained, his eyes glowing as he held up fragments of rock.  \"You see, the dynamite charge was a low-power one.  It just splintered the rock.  There wasn't so very much driving force to the explosion.  Another time I could make the force even lower.\"  \"Here's gold in this bit of rock!\" cried Harry, turning, his eyes sparkling.  \"Yes; but not enough to look promising,\" replied Mr. Dunlop, after examining the specimen.  \"But we'll look through the rest of the stuff that's loose.\"  The two men who had hung back soon joined them.  \"I wouldn't care about filing a claim to it,\" Mr. Dunlop, shaking his head after some further exploration.  \"This rock wouldn't yield enough to the ton to make the work profitable.\"  \"Just a little, outcropping streak, possibly from the claim that I have below,\" was Mr. Dunlop's conclusion \"By the way, Reade, how did you explode the mine?\"  \"With a magneto,\" Tom explained, then ran and took the battery from behind the tree from which he had fired it.  \"I buried the wire, of course, so that no one would trip over it,\" he added. \"Just after I got it attended to Alf Drew happened along, looked forlorn, and wanted a job.  So I had almost forgotten the mine, until I realized that the thing was planted right in front of where Dolph Gage's crew were hidden.  By the way, Jim, where is Alf?\"  \"All the information I've got wouldn't send you two feet in the right direction,\" the guide reported gruffly.  \"And where are our tents and the other stuff?\" Harry demanded. \"Gage's crew couldn't get far with them in the time they've had. Shall we hustle after our property?\"  \"Yes,\" nodded Tom.  \"At the momentary risk of being shot to pieces,\" added Mr. Dunlop, dryly.  \"Those little chances go with being involved in a Nevada mining dispute, don't they?\" queried Reade.  \"Where can we begin to look?\" Harry pressed.  \"Let's scurry about a bit.  Surely men can't get away with tents without leaving some trail.\"  Within two minutes they had the trail.  Marks were discovered that plainly had been made by dragging canvas and guy-ropes along over the ground.  \"We'll find our stuff soon,\" predicted Tom, striding along over a rough trail.  \"The scoundrels didn't have a team, and they wouldn't take the stuff far without other transportation than their own backs. Hello!  What's in there?\"  Tom had detected some motions in a clump of brush.  \"Look out!\" warned Jim Ferrers, bringing his rifle to \"ready.\"  But Tom darted straight into the brush.  \"Then this is where you are?\" demanded Tom dryly.  He glanced down at the cowering form of Alf Drew.  \"So you've got the 'makings,' have you?\"  Reade demanded, seizing Alf by the collar and yanking him up to his feet.  Paper and tobacco fell from young Drew's nerveless grasp to the ground.  \"You made me drop the makings of a good one,\" whined Alf resentfully.  \"You didn't have that stuff two hours ago.  Where did you get it?\" Reade demanded.  \"Found it,\" half whimpered Drew.  \"Do you expect me to believe any such fairy tales as that?\" insisted Tom Reade.  \"If you have tobacco and cigarette papers,\" Tom continued, \"then some one gave the stuff to you.  It was Dolph Gage, or one of his rascals, wasn't it?\"  \"Don't know him,\" replied the boy, with a shake of his head.  \"Now, don't try to fool me, Drew,\" warned Tom, with a mild shake administered to the youngster's shoulders.  \"How much tobacco have you?\"  \"A whole package,\" admitted Alf reluctantly, feeling that it would be of no use to try to deceive his employer.  \"And plenty of papers to go with it?\"  \"Ye-es.\"  \"You got it from four men?\"  \"No; I didn't.\"  \"Well, from one of four men, then?  Tell me the truth.\"  \"Ye-es.\"  \"What did you do to please the four men?\"  Alf Drew shifted uneasily from one foot to the other, and then back again.  \"Come!  Speak up!\" Reade insisted sternly.  \"You're wasting our time.  What did you do for the four men?\"  \"I didn't do anything,\" Alf evaded.  \"What did you tell them, then?\" Reade wanted to know.  \"They asked me a few questions.\"  \"Of course; and you answered the questions.\"  \"Well, I-----\"  \"What did the men want to know about?\" pressed Tom, the look in his eyes growing sterner still.  \"They wanted to know how many men Jim Ferrers had,\" admitted the Drew boy.  \"Oh, I see,\" pondered Tom aloud, a half smile creeping into his face.  \"They were guessing the size of Ferrers's army, were they?\"  \"I---I guess so,\" Alf replied.  \"And you told them-----?\"  \"I told 'em the camp was made up of you and Mr. Hazelton, Jim Ferrers and myself.\"  \"And then they gave you the tobacco for cigarettes, did they?\"  \"I made 'em gimme that first,\" Alf retorted, a look of cunning in his eyes.  \"So, my bright little hero, you sold us out for a toy bale of cigarettes, did you?\" demanded Tom Reade, staring coldly down at the shame-faced youngster.     CHAPTER V  NO NEED TO WORK FOR PENNIES   \"I---I didn't see how it could do any harm,\" sniveled young Drew.  \"Perhaps it didn't,\" Tom admitted.  \"So far, it has resulted only in our being ambushed and all but murdered.  Now, where did they take our tents and the other stuff?\"  \"I don't know,\" declared Alf.  \"Are the tents gone?\"  He answered so promptly that Reade believed him.  \"Very much so,\" replied Reade, releasing his grip on Drew's shoulder. \"Come on, friends, we'll hunt further.\"  \"Say, what was that big explosion?\" asked Alf, running after the party when he found himself being left alone.  \"No time to talk until we find our camp stuff,\" Tom called back over his shoulder.  \"I'll help you,\" proposed Alf eagerly.  \"You're full of helpfulness,\" Reade jibed.  But Alf evidently preferred to stick to them.  He ran along at the heels of the last rapidly striding man.  Joe Timmins was the only one absent, he having remained at the camp site to keep a watchful eye over the"]]]
