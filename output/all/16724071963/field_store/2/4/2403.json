Not unto us is given choice of the tasks we try,    Gathering grain or chaff;   One of her favoured servants toils at an epic high,    One, that a child may laugh.    Yet if we serve her truly in our appointed place,    Freely she doth accord   Unto her faithful servants always this saving grace,    Work is its own reward!_     Song of the Wheat      We have sung the song of the droving days,    Of the march of the travelling sheep;   By silent stages and lonely ways    Thin, white battalions creep.   But the man who now by the land would thrive    Must his spurs to a plough-share beat.   Is there ever a man in the world alive    To sing the song of the Wheat!    It's west by south of the Great Divide    The grim grey plains run out,   Where the old flock-masters lived and died    In a ceaseless fight with drought.   Weary with waiting and hope deferred    They were ready to own defeat,   Till at last they heard the master-word--    And the master-word was Wheat.    Yarran and Myall and Box and Pine--    'Twas axe and fire for all;   They scarce could tarry to blaze the line    Or wait for the trees to fall,   Ere the team was yoked, and the gates flung wide,    And the dust of the horses' feet   Rose up like a pillar of smoke to guide    The wonderful march of Wheat.    Furrow by furrow, and fold by fold,    The soil is turned on the plain;   Better than silver and better than gold    Is the surface-mine of the grain;   Better than cattle and better than sheep    In the fight with drought and heat;   For a streak of stubbornness, wide and deep,    Lies hid in a grain of Wheat.    When the stock is swept by the hand of fate,    Deep down in his bed of clay   The brave brown Wheat will lie and wait    For the resurrection day:   Lie hid while the whole world thinks him dead;    But the Spring-rain, soft and sweet,   Will over the steaming paddocks spread    The first green flush of the Wheat.    Green and amber and gold it grows    When the sun sinks late in the West;   And the breeze sweeps over the rippling rows    Where the quail and the skylark nest.   Mountain or river or shining star,    There's never a sight can beat--   Away to the sky-line stretching far--    A sea of the ripening Wheat.    When the burning harvest sun sinks low,    And the shadows stretch on the plain,   The roaring strippers come and go    Like ships on a sea of grain;   Till the lurching, groaning waggons bear    Their tale of the load complete.   Of the world's great work he has done his share    Who has gathered a crop of wheat.    Princes and Potentates and Czars,    They travel in regal state,   But old King Wheat has a thousand cars    For his trip to the water-gate;   And his thousand steamships breast the tide    And plough thro' the wind and sleet   To the lands where the teeming millions bide    That say:  “Thank God for Wheat!”     Brumby's Run        Brumby is the Aboriginal word for a wild horse.  At a recent trial       a N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge, hearing of Brumby horses, asked:       “Who is Brumby, and where is his Run?”      It lies beyond the Western Pines    Towards the sinking sun,   And not a survey mark defines    The bounds of “Brumby's Run”.    On odds and ends of mountain land,    On tracks of range and rock   Where no one else can make a stand,    Old Brumby rears his stock.    A wild, unhandled lot they are    Of every shape and breed.   They venture out 'neath moon and star    Along the flats to feed;    But when the dawn makes pink the sky    And steals along the plain,   The Brumby horses turn and fly    Towards the hills again.    The traveller by the mountain-track    May hear their hoof-beats pass,   And catch a glimpse of brown and black    Dim shadows on the grass.    The eager stockhorse pricks his ears    And lifts his head on high   In wild excitement when he hears    The Brumby mob go by.    Old Brumby asks no price or fee    O'er all his wide domains:   The man who yards his stock is free    To keep them for his pains.    So, off to scour the mountain-side    With eager eyes aglow,   To strongholds where the wild mobs hide    The gully-rakers go.    A rush of horses through the trees,    A red shirt making play;   A sound of stockwhips on the breeze,    They vanish far away!         .    .    .    .    .    Ah, me! before our day is done    We long with bitter pain   To ride once more on Brumby's Run    And yard his mob again.     Saltbush Bill on the Patriarchs      Come all you little rouseabouts and climb upon my knee;   To-day, you see, is Christmas Day, and so it's up to me   To give you some instruction like--a kind of Christmas tale--   So name your yarn, and off she goes.  What, “Jonah and the Whale”?    Well, whales is sheep I've never shore; I've never been to sea,   So all them great Leviathans is mysteries to me;   But there's a tale the Bible tells I fully understand,   About the time the Patriarchs were settling on the land.    Those Patriarchs of olden time, when all is said and done,   They lived the same as far-out men on many a Queensland run--   A lot of roving, droving men who drifted to and fro,   The same we did out Queensland way a score of years ago.    Now Isaac was a squatter man, and Jacob was his son,   And when the boy grew up, you see, he wearied of the run.   You know the way that boys grow up--there's some that stick at home;   But any boy that's worth his salt will roll his swag and roam.    So Jacob caught the roving fit and took the drovers' track   To where his uncle had a run, beyond the outer back;   You see they made for out-back runs for room to stretch and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1317"],["title","Saltbush Bill, J. P. (#1)"],["body","w,   The same we did out Queensland way, a score of years ago.    Now, Jacob knew the ways of stock--that's most uncommon clear--   For when he got to Laban's Run, they made him overseer;   He didn't ask a pound a week, but bargained for his pay   To take the roan and strawberry calves--the same we'd take to-day.    The duns and blacks and “Goulburn roans” (that's brindles), coarse and hard,   He branded them with Laban's brand, in Old Man Laban's yard;   So, when he'd done the station work for close on seven year,   Why, all the choicest stock belonged to Laban's overseer.    It's often so with overseers--I've seen the same thing done   By many a Queensland overseer on many a Queensland run.   But when the mustering time came on old Laban acted straight,   And gave him country of his own outside the boundary gate.    He gave him stock, and offered him his daughter's hand in troth;   And Jacob first he married one, and then he married both;   You see, they weren't particular about a wife or so--   No more were we up Queensland way a score of years ago.    But when the stock were strong and fat with grass and lots of rain,   Then Jacob felt the call to take the homeward road again.   It's strange in every creed and clime, no matter where you roam,   There comes a day when every man would like to make for home.    So off he set with sheep and goats, a mighty moving band,   To battle down the homeward track along the Overland--   It's droving mixed-up mobs like that that makes men cut their throats.   I've travelled rams, which Lord forget, but never travelled goats.    But Jacob knew the ways of stock, for (so the story goes)   When battling through the Philistines--selectors, I suppose--   He thought he'd have to fight his way, an awkward sort of job;   So what did Old Man Jacob do? of course, he split the mob.    He sent the strong stock on ahead to battle out the way;   He couldn't hurry lambing ewes--no more you could to-day--   And down the road, from run to run, his hand 'gainst every hand,   He moved that mighty mob of stock across the Overland.    The thing is made so clear and plain, so solid in and out,   There isn't any room at all for any kind of doubt.   It's just a plain straightforward tale--a tale that lets you know   The way they lived in Palestine three thousand years ago.    It's strange to read it all to-day, the shifting of the stock;   You'd think you see the caravans that loaf behind the flock,   The little donkeys and the mules, the sheep that slowly spread,   And maybe Dan or Naphthali a-ridin' on ahead.    The long, dry, dusty summer days, the smouldering fires at night;   The stir and bustle of the camp at break of morning light;   The little kids that skipped about, the camels' dead-slow tramp--   I wish I'd done a week or two in Old Man Jacob's camp!    _But if I keep the narrer path, some day, perhaps, I'll know   How Jacob bred them strawberry calves three thousand years ago._     The Reverend Mullineux      I'd reckon his weight at eight-stun-eight,    And his height at five-foot-two,   With a face as plain as an eight-day clock   And a walk as brisk as a bantam-cock--    Game as a bantam, too,   Hard and wiry and full of steam,   That's the boss of the English Team,    Reverend Mullineux.    Makes no row when the game gets rough--    None of your “Strike me blue!”    “You's wants smacking across the snout!”    Plays like a gentleman out-and-out--    Same as he ought to do.   “Kindly remove from off my face!”    That's the way that he states his case--    Reverend Mullineux.    Kick!  He can kick like an army mule--    Run like a kangaroo!   Hard to get by as a lawyer-plant,   Tackles his man like a bull-dog ant--    Fetches him over too!   _Didn't_ the public cheer and shout   Watchin' him chuckin' big blokes about--    Reverend Mullineux.    Scrimmage was packed on his prostrate form,    Somehow the ball got through--   Who was it tackled our big half-back,   Flinging him down like an empty sack,    Right on our goal-line too?   Who but the man that we thought was dead,   Down with a score of 'em on his head,    Reverend Mullineux.     The Wisdom of Hafiz      My son, if you go to the races to battle with Ikey and Mo,   Remember, it's seldom the pigeon can pick out the eye of the crow;   Remember, they live by the business; remember, my son, and go slow.    If ever an owner should tell you, “Back mine”--don't you be such a flat.   He knows his own cunning, no doubt--does he know what the others are at?   Find out what he's frightened of most, and invest a few dollars on that.    Walk not in the track of the trainer, nor hang round the rails at his stall.   His wisdom belongs to his patron--shall he give it to one and to all?   When the stable is served he may tell you--and his words     are like jewels let fall.    Run wide of the tipster who whispers that Borak is sure to be first,   He tells the next mug that he corners a tale with the placings reversed;   And, remember, of judges of racing, the jockey's the absolute worst.    When they lay three to one on the field, and the runners are twenty-and-two,   Take a pull on yourself; take a pull--it's a mighty big field     to get through.   Is the club handicapper a fool?  If a fool is about, p'raps it's you!    Beware of the critic who tells you the handicap's absolute rot,   For this is chucked in, and that's hopeless, and somebody ought to be shot.   How is it he can't make a fortune himself when he knows such a lot?    From tipsters, and jockeys, and trials, and gallops, the glory has gone,   For this is the wisdom of Hafiz that sages have pondered upon,   “The very best tip in the world is to see the commission go on!”     Saltbush Bill, J.P.      Beyond the land where Leichhardt went,    Beyond Sturt's Western track,   The rolling tide of change has sent    Some strange J.P.s out back.    And Saltbush Bill, grown old and grey,    And worn with want of sleep,   Received the news in camp one day    Behind the travelling sheep    That Edward Rex, confiding in    His known integrity,   By hand and seal on parchment skin    Had made him a J.P.    He read the news with eager face    But found no word of pay.   “I'd like to see my sister's place    And kids on Christmas day.    “I'd like to see green grass again,    And watch clear water run,   Away from this unholy plain,    And flies, and dust, and sun.”    At last one little clause he found    That might some hope inspire,   “A magistrate may charge a pound    For inquest on a fire.”    A big blacks' camp was built close by,    And Saltbush Bill, says he,   “I think that camp might well supply    A job for a J.P.”    That night, by strange coincidence,    A most disastrous fire   Destroyed the country residence    Of Jacky Jack, Esquire.    'Twas mostly leaves, and bark, and dirt;    The party most concerned   Appeared to think it wouldn't hurt    If forty such were burned.    Quite otherwise thought Saltbush Bill,    Who watched the leaping flame.   “The home is small,” said he, “but still    The principle's the same.    “Midst palaces though you should roam,    Or follow pleasure's tracks,   You'll find,” he said, “no place like home,    At least like Jacky Jack's.    “Tell every man in camp 'Come quick,'    Tell every black Maria   I give tobacco half a stick--    Hold inquest long-a fire.”    Each juryman received a name    Well suited to a Court.   “Long Jack” and “Stumpy Bill” became    “John Long” and “William Short”.    While such as “Tarpot”, “Bullock Dray”,    And “Tommy Wait-a-While”,   Became, for ever and a day,    “Scott”, “Dickens”, and “Carlyle”.    And twelve good sable men and true    Were soon engaged upon   The conflagration that o'erthrew    The home of John A. John.    Their verdict, “Burnt by act of Fate”,    They scarcely had returned   When, just behind the magistrate,    Another humpy burned!    The jury sat again and drew    Another stick of plug.   Said Saltbush Bill, “It's up to you    Put some one long-a Jug.”    “I'll camp the sheep,” he said, “and sift    The evidence about.”    For quite a week he couldn't shift,    The way the fires broke out.    The jury thought the whole concern    As good as any play.   They used to “take him oath” and earn    Three sticks of plug a day.    At last the tribe lay down to sleep    Homeless, beneath a tree;   And onward with his travelling sheep    Went Saltbush Bill, J.P.    The sheep delivered, safe and sound,    His horse to town he turned,   And drew some five-and-twenty pound    For fees that he had earned.    And where Monaro's ranges hide    Their little farms away--   His sister's children by his side--    He spent his Christmas Day.    The next J.P. that went out back    Was shocked, or pained, or both,   At hearing every pagan black    Repeat the juror's oath.    No matter though he turned and fled    They followed faster still;   “You make it inkwich, boss,” they said,    “All same like Saltbush Bill.”    They even said they'd let him see    The fires originate.   When he refused they said that he    Was “No good magistrate.”    And out beyond Sturt's Western track,    And Leichhardt's farthest tree,   They wait till fate shall send them back    Their Saltbush Bill, J.P.     The Riders in the Stand      There's some that ride the Robbo style, and bump at every stride;   While others sit a long way back, to get a longer ride.   There's some that ride like sailors do, with legs and arms, and teeth;   And some ride on the horse's neck, and some ride underneath.    But all the finest horsemen out--the men to Beat the Band--   You'll find amongst the crowd that ride their races in the Stand.   They'll say “He had the race in hand, and lost it in the straight.”    They'll show how Godby came too soon, and Barden came too late.    They'll say Chevalley lost his nerve, and Regan lost his head;   They'll tell how one was “livened up” and something else was “dead”--   In fact, the race was never run on sea,"]]]
