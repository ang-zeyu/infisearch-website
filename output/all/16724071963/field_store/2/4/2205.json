Drop head slowly to one side, close eyes as if sleeping.      5.

Let fingers fly up quickly      _q_. Hold left hand as in _a_.

Each picture should     be preceded by descriptions from the book; these are indicated     by the number of the page in the volume.      DIRECTIONS.--A good reader must be chosen, who can bring     out the light and shade in the story--one who can make the     listeners feel the pathos of Carol's brief, helpful existence     and the contrasting homely humor of \"the Ruggleses in the     rear.\" A reading-desk and lamp must stand below the platform,     and the audience-room be left in darkness. The reader will     give the signal for the opening and closing of the curtains,     pausing long enough for a full recognition of the scene. As     a repetition of a tableau is often more successful than     its initial effort, the performers should be on the alert,     prepared to give a second view.      The characters in the story call for six young people to     represent Mr. Bird, Mrs. Bird, the Grandmother, Physician,     Mrs. Ruggles, and Uncle Jack, and fourteen children to take     the parts of Donald, Hugh, Paul, Carol, Sarah Maud, Peoria,     Cornelius, Elly, Kitty, Peter, Clem, Larry, Susan, and the boy     singer.      The first hymn, \"Carol, Brothers, Carol,\" is to be sung     behind the curtains, just before they are drawn for the second     picture. A harp, violin, and triangle would assist the piano     in making an orchestral effect. A solo voice supplies the     closing air, \"My Ain Countree.\" The piano may be played very     softly whenever the reader pauses and the tableaux are shown.      It is important that the arrangements for each scene be made     in absolute quietness, with systematic forethought, else     the attention of the listeners will be distracted from the     reading.      If a Christmas tree for the entire school is to close the     entertainment, it should be in readiness at the rear of the     platform, concealed by a curtain. In the sixth picture the     tree appears, to illustrate the story, and remains lighted     through the evening.)  FIRST PICTURE.  \"They were consulting about it in the nursery.\" (Page 1 in \"The Birds' Christmas Carol.\")  In this scene the children's belongings are scattered about: small chairs, a cradle, toys, and picture-books. Mr. Bird stands in the center of the platform holding a large doll dressed in infant's robes. Grandma is seated near, and Uncle Jack, Donald, Paul, and Hugh are discussing a name for the baby. The Christmas hymn is heard after the curtains are drawn and before the   SECOND PICTURE.  \"A famous physician had visited them.\" (Page 12.)  Mr. and Mrs. Bird and the doctor are seated around a library-table in earnest conference.   THIRD PICTURE.  Carol's \"Circulating Library.\" (Page 16.)  Carol is lying in an easy-chair beside a case filled with books. The description of her room should be carried out on the stage as far as practicable.   FOURTH PICTURE.  \"The children took their places.\" (Page 36.)  The nine Ruggles children are seated in a row facing the audience. Mrs. Ruggles stands before them, giving instructions about their behavior at Carol's dinner party. The costumes must be fantastic, following the description in the story--green glass breastpin, the purple necktie, and much-braided hair.   FIFTH PICTURE.  \"The feast being over,\" etc. (Page 35.)  Carol's room is shown again. The Ruggles children are seated around Carol, with Mr. Bird and Mrs. Bird and Uncle Jack in the background.   SIXTH PICTURE.  \"There stood the brilliantly lighted tree.\" (Page 55.)  The same characters that appeared in the preceding scene are shown in attitudes of delight and astonishment as the second curtain is drawn aside to show the Christmas tree.   SEVENTH PICTURE.  \"Softly, Uncle Jack.\" (Page 63.)  The library is shown again. Mr. and Mrs. Bird, Uncle Jack, Donald, Hugh, and Paul are grouped as if listening attentively. At the right of the platform a leaded-window effect is made with a slender wood frame covered with black gauze. Behind this stands a small boy in choir vestments, holding a music book and singing \"My Ain Countree\" to organ accompaniment.          *       *       *       *       *  =The Brownie Men.=  By M. NORA BOYLAN.      (An exercise for four little boys. They wear padded trousers     of some cheap brown material and a loose shirt of same     material in place of the school jacket. Skull-caps of same     material, worn jauntily. Broad white rings about the eyes and     charcoal lines upon face to produce resemblance to pictured     Brownies. Jolly smiles and capers. Join hands and hop on     one foot around tree or leader, before, between, and after     verses.)    Merry, merry sprites are we,   Dancing round the Christmas tree.   We've a gift for every one   Though the last one is just done.    This has been a busy year,   And we hope we bring you cheer,   And when Christmas comes again,   Look for us--The Brownie men.          *       *       *       *       *  =Winter's Children.=  By J.D. MOORE.      (The children should wear some indication of the several     characters they impersonate. Most elaborate and beautiful     costumes might be used, but the simple device of a placard     upon each child's breast bearing the name of his part will     answer the purpose.)    _Wind_:   I come from the cold and stormy North,             With a rush and a roar I hurry forth,             I toss from the trees the dead leaves down,             The withered leaves all sere and brown,             And sway the branches to and fro             As on my way I whirling go.             At crack and crevice I slip in,             And make a lively sounding din.             Swift I come and swift away,             With you I can no longer stay,             For I am wanted elsewhere now,             And so good-bye, I make my bow.    _Frost (taking Wind's hand)_:             Hand in hand we ever go             Through the season to and fro.             I breathe upon the streams. They cease             Their murmurings and are at peace.             Upon each window pane I trace             The finest filmy glistening lace.             Each boy and girl, 'tis plain to see,             Hath still a welcome kind for me.             For on the lake they whirl and wheel,             You hear the click of polished steel             As swift upon their skates they fly             With joyous heart and flashing eye.             My breath blows cold. Health, joy, delight,             Follow my silvery sparkles bright.             Now Snow, who is my guardian sweet,             Will all my young friends fondly greet.    _Snow (a little girl)_:             Over the earth so bare and brown             I spread a robe as soft as down.             Drifting, drifting down through space,             Hiding each unsightly place,             Touched to shimmering radiance bright,             In the moonbeam's mellow light,             By my brother Frost, for we (_they join hands_)             Both go hand in hand, you see.             North Wind goes gaily with us both,             To help us he is nothing loath.             And he and Frost and Rain combine             To give what in the clear sunshine             Shimmers sparkling--pure and nice,             Transparent, white, and glistening Ice.    _Ice_:    I cling to lofty gables, I rustle 'mid the snow,             I weave a gleaming covering             For lakes and streams. They know             That all must cease their murmuring             When Frost and I appear,             For we will hold them firm and fast             As long as we are here.             Gleaming, glistening, sparkling,             Yet pure and clear and bright.             You'll find me 'neath a silver moon,             Each crisp, fresh winter night.    (_Enter Old Winter_)    _Winter_: What, ho! my children, here I am,             I've sought you everywhere.             And now to busy work away,             For you must all prepare             To do your duty while I hold             In check your enemy,             The great round sun, whose rays with you.             My children, disagree.             Now up, away! Wind, to the west             And come again in glee;             And join with Frost and Snow and Ice,             In one grand jubilee.             And paint the cheeks with roses             Of all these children who,             Right joyously will run and shout,             _My_ children dear, with you.             Away! to work, you must not shirk             Your duties, dears; and now,             To these, your firmest friends, make each             Your most engaging bow.
