It denied the legal existence of the African race as persons in American society and in constitutional law, and also denied the supremacy of Congress over the territories and the constitutionality of the \"Missouri Compromise.\" Four years of civil war were necessary to overrule this sweeping opinion of Chief Justice Taney's, which is still referred to with awe and veneration by a large minority, if not by a majority, of the legal profession.  To Roswell Field belongs the honor of instituting the original action for Dred Scott, without fee or expectation of compensation. The details of this celebrated case, after it got into the United States courts, are a part of the history of our country. What I am about to relate is scarcely known outside of the old Court House and Hall of Records in St. Louis.  Dred Scott was a negro slave of Dr. Emerson, a surgeon in the United States Army, then stationed in Missouri. Dr. Emerson took Scott with him when, in 1834, he moved to Illinois, a free state, and subsequently to Fort Snelling, Wis. This territory, being north of 36 degrees and 30 minutes, was free soil under the Missouri Compromise of 1820. At Fort Snelling, Scott married a colored woman who had also been taken as a slave from Missouri. When Dr. Emerson returned to Missouri he brought Dred Scott, his wife, and child with him. The case came to the attention of Roswell Field, and at once enlisted all his human sympathy and great legal ability. His first petition to the Circuit Court for the County of St. Louis is too important and unique a human document not to be preserved in full. It reads:    Your petitioner, a man of color, respectfully represents that   sometime in the year 1835 your petitioner was purchased as a slave   by one John Emerson, since deceased, who afterwards, to wit, about   the year 1836 or 1839, conveyed your petitioner from the State of   Missouri to Fort Snelling, a fort then occupied by the troops of the   United States, and under the jurisdiction of the United States,   situated in the territory ceded by France to the United States under   the name of Louisiana, lying North of 36 degrees and 30 minutes   North latitude, not included within the limits of the State of   Missouri; and resided and continued to reside at said Fort Snelling   for upwards of one year, and holding your petitioner in slavery at   said Fort during all that time; in violation of the act of Congress   of March 6th, 1820, entitled \"An act to authorize the people of   Missouri Territory to form a constitution and State government and   for the admission of such state into the Union on an equal footing   with the original states and to prohibit slavery in certain   territories.\"    Your petitioner avers that said Emerson has since departed this   life, leaving a widow, Irene Emerson, and an infant child whose name   is unknown to your petitioner, and that one Alexander Sandford has   administered upon the estate of said Emerson and that your   petitioner is now unlawfully held by said Sandford as said   Administrator and said Irene Emerson who claims your petitioner as   part of the estate of said Emerson and by one said Samuel Russell.    Your petitioner therefore prays your Honorable Court to grant him   leave to sue as a free person in order to establish his right to   freedom and that the necessary orders may be made in the premises.    (Signed) DRED SCOTT.    his DRED X SCOTT mark    Sworn to and subscribed before me this 1st day July, 1847,   PETER W. JOHNSTONE, J.P.    Upon reading the above petition this day, it being the opinion of   the Judge of the Circuit Court that the said petition contains   sufficient matter to authorize the commencement of a suit for his   freedom, it is hereby ordered that the said petitioner, Dred Scott,   be allowed to sue, on giving security satisfactory to the Clerk of   the Circuit Court for all costs that may be adjudged against him,   and that he have reasonable liberty to attend his counsel and the   Court as occasion may require, and that he be not subjected to any   severity on account of this application for his freedom and that he   be not removed out of the jurisdiction of the Court.    A. HAMILTON,   _Judge of the St. Louis Circuit Court, 8th Judicial Circuit, Mo._   July 2d, 1847.  Having obtained the desired leave to sue from Judge Alexander Hamilton, Roswell Field procured Joseph Charless, one of the leading citizens of St. Louis, to execute the necessary bond for costs. Then he lost no time in filing the following complaint, which I have no doubt Eugene Field would have mortgaged many weeks' salary to number among his most precious possessions. He would have cherished it above the Gladstone axe, for, while that felled mighty oaks, this brief document laid the axe at the root of a deadly upas-tree which threatened the destruction of a free republic. I offer no apology for its insertion here:    STATE OF MISSOURI, ) COUNTY OF ST. LOUIS) ss.    CIRCUIT COURT OF ST. LOUIS, ST. LOUIS COUNTY. November Term, 1847.    Dred Scott, a man of color, by his attorneys, plaintiff in this   suit, complains of Alexander Sandford as administrator of the estate   of John Emerson deceased, Irene Emerson and Samuel Russell,   defendants of a plea of trespass. For that the said defendants   heretofore, to wit on the 1st day of July in the year 1846 at to wit   the County of St. Louis aforesaid with force and arms assaulted the   said plaintiff and then and there, beat, bruised, and ill-treated   him and then and there imprisoned and kept and detained him in   prison there without any reasonable or probable cause whatsoever,   for a long time, to wit for the space of one year, then next   following, contrary to law and against the will of the said   plaintiff; and the said plaintiff avers that before and at the time   of the committing of the grievances aforesaid, he the said plaintiff   was then and there and still is a free person, and that the said   defendants held and still hold him in slavery, and other wrongs to   the said plaintiff then and there did against the peace of the State   of Missouri to the damage of the said plaintiff in the sum of ($300)   Three Hundred Dollars, and therefore he sues.    FIELD & HALL, _Attys. for Plff._  With this brief and bald complaint for trespass to the person and false imprisonment was begun a long and stubbornly fought litigation, extending over ten years, and which was destined to end in Chief Justice Taney declaring:    They [negroes] had for more than a century before [the Declaration   of Independence] been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and   altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social   or political relations; and so far inferior that they had no rights   which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might   justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was   bought and sold and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise   and traffic whenever a profit could be made by it.  From the beginning of his connection with this case Roswell Field contended for the broad principle enunciated by Lord Mansfield that \"Slavery is so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law.\" He consented to a discontinuance of the original action because of the variance of the complaint from the subsequently discovered facts. In the second suit Dred Scott and his family were declared free by the local court, but the judgment was reversed on appeal to the Supreme Court of the state. Judge Gamble, in dissenting from the opinion of the majority of the Court, held that \"In Missouri it has been recognized from the beginning of the Government as a correct position in law that a master who takes his slave to reside in a state or territory where slavery is prohibited thereby emancipates his slave.\"  The subsequent sale of Dred Scott to a citizen of New York named Sandford afforded Roswell Field the opportunity to renew the fight for Scott's freedom in the United States Circuit Court at St. Louis. The case was tried in May, 1854, and it was again declared that Scott and his family \"were negro slaves, the lawful property of Sandford.\" Roswell Field immediately appealed by writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the appeal was first argued early in 1856, and a second time in December of the same year. Mr. Field's connection with the case ended when he prepared the papers on appeal and sent his brief to Montgomery Blair, with whom was associated for Scott on the second hearing George Ticknor Curtis. Both of these eminent lawyers emulated the example of Eugene Field's father, who for nearly nine years had devoted a large share of his time and energy to the fight of a penniless negro slave for liberty.  Looking back now it is almost impossible to realize how the issue in this case stirred the nation to its depth. It was first argued while the country was in the throes of the fierce Fremont-Buchanan campaign, and it was believed that the second hearing was ordered by a pro-slavery court after Buchanan's election, to permit more time in which to formulate the extraordinary decision at which the majority of the court arrived. The decision was political rather than judicial, and challenged the attention of the people beyond any act of the Supreme Court before or since.  The Civil War was virtually an appeal from the judgment of Chief Justice Taney and his associates to the God of Battles.  It must not be thought that a single case, although the most celebrated in the annals of American jurisprudence, was Roswell Field's sole claim to the title of leader of the Missouri bar during his lifetime. The records of the Superior Court of that state bear interesting and convincing testimony to the exceptional brilliancy of Eugene Field's father, while the tributes to his memory, by his brothers at the bar and the judges before whom he appeared, prove that in all the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],["title","Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#7)"],["body","of life he fulfilled the promise of ability and genius given in his graduation from college at an age when most boys are entering a preparatory school.  Before dismissing Roswell Field to take up the story of his son's career, I wish to quote a few passages from a brief memoir which is preserved in the history of Newfane, as throwing direct hereditary light on the peculiar character, fascinating personality, and entertaining genius of his son.  As I may hereafter have occasion to refer to Eugene Field's political convictions, let us begin these quotations with one as to his father's politics:  \"In the dark days of the Rebellion, during the years 1861 and 1862, when the friends of the Union in St. Louis and Missouri felt that they were in imminent danger of being drawn from their homes and of having their estates confiscated by rebels and traitors, General Lyon, General Blair, and R.M. Field were among the calm, loyal, and patriotic men who influenced public action and saved the city and state.\"  Those of my readers who knew the son will recognize much that captivated them in this description of the father:  \"In his social relations he was a genial and entertaining companion, unsurpassed in conversational powers, delighting in witty and sarcastic observations and epigrammatic sentences. He was elegant in his manners and bland and refined in his deportment. He was a skilful musician and passionately fond of children, and it was his wont in early life to gather them in groups about him and beguile them by the hour with the music of the flute or violin. He was actually devoid of all ambition for power and place, and uniformly declined all offers of advancement to the highest judicial honors of the state.\"  From the lips of Samuel Knox, of the St. Louis bar, we have this testimony as to the remarkable extent and versatility of Roswell M. Field's talents:  \"Uniting great industry and acquirements with the most brilliant wit and genius, well and accurately informed on all subjects, both in science and art; endowed with a memory that retained whatever it received, with quick and clear perceptions, the choicest, most felicitous, and forcible language in which to clothe his thoughts, no one could doubt his meaning or withhold the tribute of wonder at his power.\"  [Illustration: CHARLES KELLOGG FIELD.]  To clinch the evidence as to the source from which Eugene Field derived pretty nearly everything that won for him such meed of fame as fell to his lot, let me quote from an interview with Melvin L. Gray, his guardian and foster-father, printed in the Helena Independent, September 6th, 1895, shortly before his idol's death:  \"If I had never believed in the influence of heredity before, I would now, after having known Eugene Field and his father before him. The father was a lawyer of wonderful ability, but he was particularly distinguished by his keen wit, his intense appreciation of the humorous side of life, and his fondness for rare first editions of literary works. He was a profound student, and found much time to cultivate the fairer qualities that some lawyers neglect in the busy round of their profession. Eugene is not a lawyer, but he has his father's tastes, his father's keen wit, and much of the same fineness of character and literary ability.\"  \"Another point of similarity is found in Eugene's neglect of financial matters. In his youth the father was equally negligent, although he did subsequently grow more thrifty, and when he died left the boys a little patrimony. As executor I apportioned the money as directed. Both the boys spent it freely while it lasted.\"  I find no trace in the father of what, all through life, was the pre-eminent characteristic of Eugene, the inveterate painstaking, mirth-compelling practical-joker. But in Brattleboro, Newfane, and throughout Vermont everybody says, \"That's jest like his uncle Charles Kellogg. There was never such another for jest foolin'. He'd rather play a hoax on the parson that would embarrass him in the face of his congregation than eat.\" When they were boys, it was Charles that led Roswell into all kinds of mischief. \"Uncle Charles Kellogg\"--they always give him the benefit of the second name in Brattleboro--had a reputation for wit and never-ending badinage throughout the neighborhood that still survives and leaves no room to question whence Eugene inherited his unquenchable passion \"for jest foolin'.\"     CHAPTER IV  BIRTH AND EARLY YOUTH   For nine years after moving to St. Louis his profession was the sole mistress of Roswell Field's \"laborious days\" and bachelor nights. Almost coincident with his becoming interested in the case of the slave, Dred Scott, he met, and more to the purpose of this narrative, became interested in Miss Frances Reed, then of St. Louis, but whose parents hailed from Windham County, Vermont. Whether their common nativity, or the fact that her father was a professional musician, first brought them together, the memory of St. Louis does not disclose. Miss Reed was a young woman of unusual personal charm. All accounts agree that she was quiet and refined in her ways and yet possessed that firmness of mind that is the salt of a quiet nature. They were married in May, 1848, and in the love and domestic happiness of his mature manhood, Roswell Field found the sweet balm for the bitterness that followed from his youthful romance and the nullification of the Putney marriage.  Of this union six children were born in the eight years of Mrs. Field's wedded life, only two of whom, Eugene, the second, and Roswell, survived babyhood. There is some uncertainty as to the exact date and location of Eugene's birth. When his father was married he took his bride home to a house on Collins Street, which, under Time's transmuting and ironical fingers, has since become a noisy boiler-shop. There their first child was born. Subsequently they moved to the house, No. 634 South Fifth Street (now Broadway), which is one in the middle of a block of houses pointed out in St. Louis as the birthplace of Eugene Field. Although Eugene himself went with the photographer and pointed out the house, his brother Roswell strenuously maintains that Eugene was born before the family moved to the Walsh row, so-called, and that to the boiler-shop belongs the honor of having heard the first lullabies that greeted the ears of their greatest master.  [Illustration: EUGENE FIELD'S MOTHER. _From a daguerreotype taken a year or two before his birth._]  Roswell's view receives negative corroboration from the testimony of Mrs. Temperance Moon, of Farmington, Utah, who for a time lived in their father's family. Under date of February 25th, 1901, Mrs. Moon wrote to me:  \"I can give you very little information in regard to Mr. Field's place of birth. It was on Third Street. I do not remember the names of the cross streets, I think Cherry was one. Eugene was four months old when I went to live with them. I stayed until the family went east for the summer. Mrs. Field's sister was living with them. Her name was Miss Arabella Reed. When they came back Roswell was a few months old. They went to live on Fifth Street in a three-story house. Mrs. Field sent word for me to come and take care of Eugene. I was twelve years old. She gave me full charge of him. I was very proud of the charge. He was a noble child. I loved him as a dear brother. He took great delight in hearing me read any kind of children's stories and fairy tales. His mother was a lovely woman. I have a book and a picture Eugene sent to me. The picture is of him and his mother when he was only six months old.\"  Equal and illusive doubt hangs over the date of Eugene Field's birth. Was it September 2d or 3d, 1850? In his \"Auto-Analysis,\" of which we shall hear more further along, Field himself gives preference to the latter figure. But as his preference more than half the time went by the rule of contraries, that would be prima-facie evidence that he was born on the earlier date. There again the testimony of the younger brother is to the effect that in their youth the anniversary of Eugene's birth was held to be September 2d. Their father said he could not reconcile his mind to the thought that one of his children was born on so memorable an anniversary as September 3d, the day of Cromwell's death. I have little doubt that Field himself fostered the irrepressible conflict of dates, on the theory that two birthdays a year afforded a double opportunity to playfully remind his friends of the pleasing duty of an interchange of tokens on such anniversaries. If they forgot September 2d, he could jog their memories that Cromwell's death on September 3d, two centuries before, was no excuse for ignoring his birth on September 3d, 1850.  Whether born on the anniversary of Cromwell's death or in the boiler-shop, no stories of the youthful precocity of Eugene Field survive to entertain us or to suggest that he gave early indication of the possession either of unusual talent or of that unique personality that were to distinguish him from the thousands born every day.  But Eugene and Roswell, Jr., were not long to know the watchful tenderness and ambitious solicitude of that \"mother love\" of which the elder has so sweetly sung. In November, 1856, when Eugene was six years old, their mother died and their father's thoughts instinctively turned to his sister, hoping to find with her, amid scenes familiar to his own youth, a home and affectionate care for his motherless boys. How the early loss of his mother affected the life of Eugene Field it is impossible to tell. Not until the boy of six whom she left had become a man of forty did he attempt to pay a tribute of filial love to her memory. The following lines, under the simple title, \"To My Mother,\" first appeared in his \"Sharps and Flats\" column, October 25th, 1890. It was reprinted in his \"Second Book of Verse.\" The opening lines summon up a tender picture of a \"grace that is dead\":"]]]
