I am a blind man--I haven't seen my servant for twelve years--what idea can you give me of him? I asked you to notice.\"  \"I know you did, but your Parkinson is the sort of man who has very little about him to describe. He is the embodiment of the ordinary. His height is about average----\"  \"Five feet nine,\" murmured Carrados. \"Slightly above the mean.\"  \"Scarcely noticeably so. Clean-shaven. Medium brown hair. No particularly marked features. Dark eyes. Good teeth.\"  \"False,\" interposed Carrados. \"The teeth--not the statement.\"  \"Possibly,\" admitted Mr. Carlyle. \"I am not a dental expert and I had no opportunity of examining Mr. Parkinson's mouth in detail. But what is the drift of all this?\"  \"His clothes?\"  \"Oh, just the ordinary evening dress of a valet. There is not much room for variety in that.\"  \"You noticed, in fact, nothing special by which Parkinson could be identified?\"  \"Well, he wore an unusually broad gold ring on the little finger of the left hand.\"  \"But that is removable. And yet Parkinson has an ineradicable mole--a small one, I admit--on his chin. And you a human sleuth-hound. Oh, Louis!\"  \"At all events,\" retorted Carlyle, writhing a little under this good-humoured satire, although it was easy enough to see in it Carrados's affectionate intention--\"at all events, I dare say I can give as good a description of Parkinson as he can give of me.\"  \"That is what we are going to test. Ring the bell again.\"  \"Seriously?\"  \"Quite. I am trying my eyes against yours. If I can't give you fifty out of a hundred I'll renounce my private detectorial ambition for ever.\"  \"It isn't quite the same,\" objected Carlyle, but he rang the bell.  \"Come in and close the door, Parkinson,\" said Carrados when the man appeared. \"Don't look at Mr. Carlyle again--in fact, you had better stand with your back towards him, he won't mind. Now describe to me his appearance as you observed it.\"  Parkinson tendered his respectful apologies to Mr. Carlyle for the liberty he was compelled to take, by the deferential quality of his voice.  \"Mr. Carlyle, sir, wears patent leather boots of about size seven and very little used. There are five buttons, but on the left boot one button--the third up--is missing, leaving loose threads and not the more usual metal fastener. Mr. Carlyle's trousers, sir, are of a dark material, a dark grey line of about a quarter of an inch width on a darker ground. The bottoms are turned permanently up and are, just now, a little muddy, if I may say so.\"  \"Very muddy,\" interposed Mr. Carlyle generously. \"It is a wet night, Parkinson.\"  \"Yes, sir; very unpleasant weather. If you will allow me, sir, I will brush you in the hall. The mud is dry now, I notice. Then, sir,\" continued Parkinson, reverting to the business in hand, \"there are dark green cashmere hose. A curb-pattern key-chain passes into the left-hand trouser pocket.\"  From the visitor's nether garments the photographic-eyed Parkinson proceeded to higher ground, and with increasing wonder Mr. Carlyle listened to the faithful catalogue of his possessions. His fetter-and-link albert of gold and platinum was minutely described. His spotted blue ascot, with its gentlemanly pearl scarfpin, was set forth, and the fact that the buttonhole in the left lapel of his morning coat showed signs of use was duly noted. What Parkinson saw he recorded, but he made no deductions. A handkerchief carried in the cuff of the right sleeve was simply that to him and not an indication that Mr. Carlyle was, indeed, left-handed.  But a more delicate part of Parkinson's undertaking remained. He approached it with a double cough.  \"As regards Mr. Carlyle's personal appearance, sir--\"  \"No, enough!\" cried the gentleman concerned hastily. \"I am more than satisfied. You are a keen observer, Parkinson.\"  \"I have trained myself to suit my master's requirements, sir,\" replied the man. He looked towards Mr. Carrados, received a nod and withdrew.  Mr. Carlyle was the first to speak.  \"That man of yours would be worth five pounds a week to me, Max,\" he remarked thoughtfully. \"But, of course--\"  \"I don't think that he would take it,\" replied Carrados, in a voice of equally detached speculation. \"He suits me very well. But you have the chance of using his services--indirectly.\"  \"You still mean that--seriously?\"  \"I notice in you a chronic disinclination to take me seriously, Louis. It is really--to an Englishman--almost painful. Is there something inherently comic about me or the atmosphere of The Turrets?\"  \"No, my friend,\" replied Mr. Carlyle, \"but there is something essentially prosperous. That is what points to the improbable. Now what is it?\"  \"It might be merely a whim, but it is more than that,\" replied Carrados. \"It is, well, partly vanity, partly _ennui_, partly\"--certainly there was something more nearly tragic in his voice than comic now--\"partly hope.\"  Mr. Carlyle was too tactful to pursue the subject.  \"Those are three tolerable motives,\" he acquiesced. \"I'll do anything you want, Max, on one condition.\"  \"Agreed. And it is?\"  \"That you tell me how you knew so much of this affair.\" He tapped the silver coin which lay on the table near them. \"I am not easily flabbergasted,\" he added.  \"You won't believe that there is nothing to explain--that it was purely second-sight?\"  \"No,\" replied Carlyle tersely: \"I won't.\"  \"You are quite right. And yet the thing is very simple.\"  \"They always are--when you know,\" soliloquised the other. \"That's what makes them so confoundedly difficult when you don't.\"  \"Here is this one then. In Padua, which seems to be regaining its old reputation as the birthplace of spurious antiques, by the way, there lives an ingenious craftsman named Pietro Stelli. This simple soul, who possesses a talent not inferior to that of Cavino at his best, has for many years turned his hand to the not unprofitable occupation of forging rare Greek and Roman coins. As a collector and student of certain Greek colonials and a specialist in forgeries I have been familiar with Stelli's workmanship for years. Latterly he seems to have come under the influence of an international crook called--at the moment--Dompierre, who soon saw a way of utilizing Stelli's genius on a royal scale. Helene Brunesi, who in private life is--and really is, I believe--Madame Dompierre, readily lent her services to the enterprise.\"  \"Quite so,\" nodded Mr. Carlyle, as his host paused.  \"You see the whole sequence, of course?\"  \"Not exactly--not in detail,\" confessed Mr. Carlyle.  \"Dompierre's idea was to gain access to some of the most celebrated cabinets of Europe and substitute Stelli's fabrications for the genuine coins. The princely collection of rarities that he would thus amass might be difficult to dispose of safely, but I have no doubt that he had matured his plans. Helene, in the person of Nina Brun, an Anglicised French parlourmaid--a part which she fills to perfection--was to obtain wax impressions of the most valuable pieces and to make the exchange when the counterfeits reached her. In this way it was obviously hoped that the fraud would not come to light until long after the real coins had been sold, and I gather that she has already done her work successfully in general houses. Then, impressed by her excellent references and capable manner, my housekeeper engaged her, and for a few weeks she went about her duties here. It was fatal to this detail of the scheme, however, that I have the misfortune to be blind. I am told that Helene has so innocently angelic a face as to disarm suspicion, but I was incapable of being impressed and that good material was thrown away. But one morning my material fingers--which, of course, knew nothing of Helene's angelic face--discovered an unfamiliar touch about the surface of my favourite Euclideas, and, although there was doubtless nothing to be seen, my critical sense of smell reported that wax had been recently pressed against it. I began to make discreet inquiries and in the meantime my cabinets went to the local bank for safety. Helene countered by receiving a telegram from Angiers, calling her to the death-bed of her aged mother. The aged mother succumbed; duty compelled Helene to remain at the side of her stricken patriarchal father, and doubtless The Turrets was written off the syndicate's operations as a bad debt.\"  \"Very interesting,\" admitted Mr. Carlyle; \"but at the risk of seeming obtuse\"--his manner had become delicately chastened--\"I must say that I fail to trace the inevitable connexion between Nina Brun and this particular forgery--assuming that it is a forgery.\"  \"Set your mind at rest about that, Louis,\" replied Carrados. \"It is a forgery, and it is a forgery that none but Pietro Stelli could have achieved. That is the essential connexion. Of course, there are accessories. A private detective coming urgently to see me with a notable tetradrachm in his pocket, which he announces to be the clue to a remarkable fraud--well, really, Louis, one scarcely needs to be blind to see through that.\"  \"And Lord Seastoke? I suppose you happened to discover that Nina Brun had gone there?\"  \"No, I cannot claim to have discovered that, or I should certainly have warned him at once when I found out--only recently--about the gang. As a matter of fact, the last information I had of Lord Seastoke was a line in yesterday's _Morning Post_ to the effect that he was still at Cairo. But many of these pieces--\" He brushed his finger almost lovingly across the vivid chariot race that embellished the reverse of the coin, and broke off to remark: \"You really ought to take up the subject, Louis. You have no idea how useful it might prove to you some day.\"  \"I really think I must,\" replied Carlyle grimly. \"Two hundred and fifty pounds the original of this cost, I believe.\"  \"Cheap, too; it would make five hundred pounds in New York to-day. As I was saying, many are literally unique.

Indeed, I feel that I ought to apologize for it all being so simple.\"  \"I think,\" remarked Mr. Carlyle, critically examining the loose threads on his left boot, \"that the apology on that head would be more appropriate from me.\"     THE KNIGHT'S CROSS SIGNAL PROBLEM   \"Louis,\" exclaimed Mr. Carrados, with the air of genial gaiety that Carlyle had found so incongruous to his conception of a blind man, \"you have a mystery somewhere about you! I know it by your step.\"  Nearly a month had passed since the incident of the false Dionysius had led to the two men meeting. It was now December. Whatever Mr. Carlyle's step might indicate to the inner eye it betokened to the casual observer the manner of a crisp, alert, self-possessed man of business. Carlyle, in truth, betrayed nothing of the pessimism and despondency that had marked him on the earlier occasion.  \"You have only yourself to thank that it is a very poor one,\" he retorted. \"If you hadn't held me to a hasty promise----\"  \"To give me an option on the next case that baffled you, no matter what it was----\"  \"Just so. The consequence is that you get a very unsatisfactory affair that has no special interest to an amateur and is only baffling because it is--well----\"  \"Well, baffling?\"  \"Exactly, Max. Your would-be jest has discovered the proverbial truth. I need hardly tell you that it is only the insoluble that is finally baffling and this is very probably insoluble. You remember the awful smash on the Central and Suburban at Knight's Cross Station a few weeks ago?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Carrados, with interest. \"I read the whole ghastly details at the time.\"  \"You read?\" exclaimed his friend suspiciously.  \"I still use the familiar phrases,\" explained Carrados, with a smile. \"As a matter of fact, my secretary reads to me. I mark what I want to hear and when he comes at ten o'clock we clear off the morning papers in no time.\"  \"And how do you know what to mark?\" demanded Mr. Carlyle cunningly.  Carrados's right hand, lying idly on the table, moved to a newspaper near. He ran his finger along a column heading, his eyes still turned towards his visitor.  \"'The Money Market. Continued from page 2. British Railways,'\" he announced.  \"Extraordinary,\" murmured Carlyle.  \"Not very,\" said Carrados. \"If someone dipped a stick in treacle and wrote 'Rats' across a marble slab you would probably be able to distinguish what was there, blindfold.\"  \"Probably,\" admitted Mr. Carlyle. \"At all events we will not test the experiment.\"  \"The difference to you of treacle on a marble background is scarcely greater than that of printers' ink on newspaper to me. But anything smaller than pica I do not read with comfort, and below long primer I cannot read at all. Hence the secretary. Now the accident, Louis.\"  \"The accident: well, you remember all about that. An ordinary Central and Suburban passenger train, non-stop at Knight's Cross, ran past the signal and crashed into a crowded electric train that was just beginning to move out. It was like sending a garden roller down a row of handlights. Two carriages of the electric train were flattened out of existence; the next two were broken up. For the first time on an English railway there was a good stand-up smash between a heavy steam-engine and a train of light cars, and it was 'bad for the coo.'\"  \"Twenty-seven killed, forty something injured, eight died since,\" commented Carrados.  \"That was bad for the Co.,\" said Carlyle. \"Well, the main fact was plain enough. The heavy train was in the wrong. But was the engine-driver responsible? He claimed, and he claimed vehemently from the first, and he never varied one iota, that he had a 'clear' signal--that is to say, the green light, it being dark. The signalman concerned was equally dogged that he never pulled off the signal--that it was at 'danger' when the accident happened and that it had been for five minutes before. Obviously, they could not both be right.\"  \"Why, Louis?\" asked Mr. Carrados smoothly.  \"The signal must either have been up or down--red or green.\"  \"Did you ever notice the signals on the Great Northern Railway, Louis?\"  \"Not particularly, Why?\"  \"One winterly day, about the year when you and I were concerned in being born, the engine-driver of a Scotch express received the 'clear' from a signal near a little Huntingdon station called Abbots Ripton. He went on and crashed into a goods train and into the thick of the smash a down express mowed its way. Thirteen killed and the usual tale of injured. He was positive that the signal gave him a 'clear'; the signalman was equally confident that he had never pulled it off the 'danger.' Both were right, and yet the signal was in working order. As I said, it was a winterly day; it had been snowing hard and the snow froze and accumulated on the upper edge of the signal arm until its weight bore it down. That is a fact that no fiction writer dare have invented, but to this day every signal on the Great Northern pivots from the centre of the arm instead of from the end, in memory of that snowstorm.\"  \"That came out at the inquest, I presume?\" said Mr. Carlyle. \"We have had the Board of Trade inquiry and the inquest here and no explanation is forthcoming. Everything was in perfect order. It rests between the word of the signalman and the word of the engine-driver--not a jot of direct evidence either way. Which is right?\"  \"That is what you are going to find out, Louis?\" suggested Carrados.  \"It is what I am being paid for finding out,\" admitted Mr. Carlyle frankly. \"But so far we are just where the inquest left it, and, between ourselves, I candidly can't see an inch in front of my face in the matter.\"  \"Nor can I,\" said the blind man, with a rather wry smile. \"Never mind. The engine-driver is your client, of course?\"  \"Yes,\" admitted Carlyle. \"But how the deuce did you know?\"  \"Let us say that your sympathies are enlisted on his behalf. The jury were inclined to exonerate the signalman, weren't they? What has the company done with your man?\"  \"Both are suspended. Hutchins, the driver, hears that he may probably be given charge of a lavatory at one of the stations. He is a decent, bluff, short-spoken old chap, with his heart in his work. Just now you'll find him at his worst--bitter and suspicious. The thought of swabbing down a lavatory and taking pennies all day is poisoning him.\"  \"Naturally. Well, there we have honest Hutchins: taciturn, a little touchy perhaps, grown grey in the service of the company, and manifesting quite a bulldog-like devotion to his favourite 538.\"  \"Why, that actually was the number of his engine--how do you know it?\" demanded Carlyle sharply.  \"It was mentioned two or three times at the inquest, Louis,\" replied Carrados mildly.  \"And you remembered--with no reason to?\"  \"You can generally trust a blind man's memory, especially if he has taken the trouble to develop it.\"  \"Then you will remember that Hutchins did not make a very good impression at the time. He was surly and irritable under the ordeal. I want you to see the case from all sides.\"  \"He called the signalman--Mead--a 'lying young dog,' across the room, I believe. Now, Mead, what is he like? You have seen him, of course?\"  \"Yes. He does not impress me favourably. He is glib, ingratiating, and distinctly 'greasy.' He has a ready answer for everything almost before the question is out of your mouth. He has thought of everything.\"  \"And now you are going to tell me something, Louis,\" said Carrados encouragingly.  Mr. Carlyle laughed a little to cover an involuntary movement of surprise.  \"There is a suggestive line that was not touched at the inquiries,\" he admitted. \"Hutchins has been a saving man all his life, and he has received good wages. Among his class he is regarded as wealthy. I daresay that he has five hundred pounds in the bank. He is a widower with one daughter, a very nice-mannered girl of about twenty. Mead is a young man, and he and the girl are sweethearts--have been informally engaged for some time. But old Hutchins would not hear of it; he seems to have taken a dislike to the signalman from the first, and latterly he had forbidden him to come to his house or his daughter to speak to him.\"  \"Excellent, Louis,\" cried Carrados in great delight. \"We shall clear your man in a blaze of red and green lights yet and hang the glib, 'greasy' signalman from his own signal-post.\"  \"It is a significant fact, seriously?\"  \"It is absolutely convincing.\"  \"It may have been a slip, a mental lapse on Mead's part which he discovered the moment it was too late, and then, being too cowardly to admit his fault, and having so much at stake, he took care to make detection impossible. It may have been that, but my idea is rather that probably it was neither quite pure accident nor pure design. I can imagine Mead meanly pluming himself over the fact that the life of this man who stands in his way, and whom he must cordially dislike, lies in his power. I can imagine the idea becoming an obsession as he dwells on it. A dozen times with his hand on the lever he lets his mind explore the possibilities of a moment's defection. Then one day he pulls the signal off in sheer bravado--and hastily puts it at danger again. He may have done it once or he may have done it oftener before he was caught in a fatal moment of irresolution. The chances are about even that the engine-driver would be killed. In any case he would be disgraced, for it is easier on the face of it to believe that a man might run past a danger signal in absentmindedness, without noticing it, than that a man should pull off a signal and replace it without being conscious of his actions.\"  \"The fireman was killed.
