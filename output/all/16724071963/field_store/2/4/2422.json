On his way home, he had to pass the Calvern place, an' so he made a wide cast aroun' the hill to keep out o' sight, when suddenly, up a gully, he saw this Hez Calvern standin' there with his rifle on his arm, an', quick as he could move, Jim grabbed his gun an' fired. It was a long shot an' a sure one.\"  \"Was it--\" the boy began, but the old man waved the interruption aside and proceeded.  \"Reloadin' his rifle, Jim Beaupoint rode slowly to whar Hez Calvern was lyin', when suddenly, from a clump o' bushes close by, there come a rifle shot, an' the rider got the bullet in his chest. Befo' fallin' from the saddle, however, the young fellow fired at the bushes from which smoke was driftin', an' a shrill scream told him that the sharpshooter was a woman.\"  \"Some one who had been with Hez Calvern?\" asked Hamilton.  \"His wife. Well, although Jim was mortally hurt an' sufferin'--as the tracks showed afterwards--he tried to drag himself to the bushes in order to help the woman who had shot him an' who he had shot unknowin'; but he was too badly hurt, an' he died twenty yards from the place whar he fell.\"  \"Was the woman dead, too?\" asked Hamilton.  \"No, but terrible badly hurt. What I was wantin' to tell yo', though, was the result of all this. Wa'al, the Beaupoints took the woman to their home an' nursed her night an' day for five long years. She was helpless, only for her tongue, an' she lashed an' abused them till the day she died, an' never once, in all those years, did any one o' the Beaupoints reproach her in return.\"  \"And the youngster?\"  \"They took the boy, too, an' reared him the bes' they knew how, jes' the same as one o' their own. One o' the Beaupoint boys went an' lived on the Calvern place, an' worked it,--worked it fair an' squar', an' put aside every cent that come out o' the farm. For thirteen years the Beaupoints looked after the farm an' reared the boy. On the day he was fourteen year old, Jed Beaupoint--that was the father--called the lad, told him the whole story, give him a new rifle an' a powder horn, an' handed over the little bag o' coin that represented thirteen years o' work on the Calvern holdin'.\"  \"There certainly couldn't be anything squarer than that!\" exclaimed Hamilton. \"And he gave the boy the farm, too?\"  \"Every inch of it. Jed Beaupoint was a squar' man, cl'ar through. An' he said to the boy--he tol' me the story himself--'Johnny Calvern, thar's yo' farm an' yo' rifle. Now, if yo're willin', I'll see that thar's no trouble until yo're twenty-one, an' then yo' c'n go huntin' revenge if yo've a mind to, or, if you're willin', we'll call the trouble off now, an' thar won't be any need o' rakin' it up again.'\"  \"He made it up on the spot, of course?\" questioned Hamilton.  The Kentuckian shook his head.  \"He did not,\" he replied. \"The boy thought a minute or two an' then said he'd wait until he was grown up, an' let him know then.\"  \"Although he had been brought up by the Beaupoints!\" exclaimed the boy in surprise. \"But surely it never came up again.\"  \"Well, not exac'ly. When Johnny Calvern was about nineteen he got married, an' a few days befo' the time when he would be twenty-one, he rode up to the Beaupoint place, an' tol' the ol' man that he was willin' to let the feud rest another ten years, because of his wife an' little baby, but that he would be ready to resume shootin' at that time.\"  \"But he had no real grudge against the Beaupoints had he, Uncle Eli? They had always been kind to him, you said.\"  \"Not a bit o' grudge,\" the mountaineer answered, \"they were good friends. An' I reckon it wasn't Johnny that wanted the trouble to begin again, but thar's always a lot o' hotheads pryin' into other folks' business. However, ol' Jed Beaupoint didn't mind; he agreed to another ten years' truce, an' all went on peacefully as befo'. Durin' those ten years, however, Johnny's wife died, an' he got married again, this time to the sister o' a wanderin' preacher, a girl who had once lived in cities, an' she soon showed him that the ol' feud business must be forgotten. But it is a mite unusual, even hyeh, to farm a man's land an' bring up his child fo' thirteen years, an' then give him everythin' yo' can with the privilege o' shootin' yo' at sight for all the favors done.\"  \"It doesn't sound a bit like the usual feud story,\" said Hamilton, \"one always thinks of those as being cold-blooded and cruel.\"  \"Thar an't a mite o' intentional cruelty in them; it's jes' that life is held cheap. Most o' them begun over some small thing like an election.\"  \"There were quite a number of them, Uncle Eli, weren't there?\"  \"One ran into the other so easily that one feud would often look like half a dozen, an' trouble would be goin' on in various places. But there were really seven of them, all big ones.\"  [Illustration: KENTUCKY MOUNTAINEER FAMILY. In the heart of the feud district, where the rifle is never out of reach. (_Courtesy of the Spirit of Missions._)]  \"What were they, Uncle Eli?\"  \"Wa'al, thar was the McCoy-Hatfield feud in Pike County, that started over the ownership o' two plain razorback hogs, but afterwards got very bitter, owin' to the friendship o' one o' the McCoy girls with the son o' Bad Anse Hatfield. Then thar was the Howard-Turner feud in Harlan County. An' then--\"  \"What started the Howard-Turner feud?\" interrupted the boy.  \"That was over a game o' cards. One o' the Howards had been winnin', an' Jim Turner, with a pistol, forced him to give back the money he had won. That affair raged a long time. The Logan-Tolliver feud in Rowan County was over an election fo' sheriff. The Logans elected their candidate, an' so the Tollivers killed one o' the Logans at the polls and wounded three others.\"  \"That's expressing dissatisfaction with an election with some spirit,\" Hamilton remarked.  \"Then thar was the French-Eversole feud in Perry County,\" continued the Kentuckian, reminiscently. \"Ol' Joe Eversole was a merchant in a town called Hazard, an' he helped Fulton French to start a little store. In time French almos' drove Eversole out o' business. That was a strange fight, because neither French nor Eversole ever got into the shootin',--indeed they remained frien'ly even when their supporters were most bitter.\"  \"Who carried on the feud, then?\" asked Hamilton in surprise, \"if the principals didn't?\"  \"Wa'al, I guess the worst was a minister, the Rev. Bill Gambrill. Ho ran the French side an' kep' the trouble stirred up all the time.\"  \"I think I've heard of the Turner war, too,\" said the boy. \"Was that the same as the Howard-Turner fighting?\"  \"All of them were mixed up in each other's feuds in that Turner family,\" the Kentuckian replied, \"but the 'Turner War' or the 'Hell's Half-Acre' feud was in Bell County, an' it started over some question o' water rights in Yellow Creek. It was a sayin' down in Bell County that it couldn't rain often enough to keep Hell's Half-Acre free from stains o' blood.\"  \"It is a fearful record, Uncle Eli, when you put them together that way,\" the boy said.  \"An' I haven't even mentioned the worst o' them, the Hargis-Cockrill feud in Breathitt County. That lasted for generations, an' started over some election for a county judge. I don' know that any one rightly remembers the time when Breathitt County wasn't the scene of some such goin's on.\"  \"But they are all over now, aren't they?\"  \"I was jes' goin' to tell yo'. They're all over but one, an' that one is sometimes called the Baker-Howard or the Garrard-White feud, for all four families were mixed up in it. Not so very long ago I was talkin' to the widow o' one o' the men slain in that fightin', an' sayin' to her how good it was that the feelin' had all died out, an' she said--thar was a lot of us thar at the time--'I have twelve sons. Each day I tell them who shot their father. I'm not goin' to die till one o' them shoots him.' I'm reckonin' to hear o' trouble in Clay County mos' any time, but I really think that is the last o' them.\"  \"What started that?\"  \"An argument over a twenty-five dollar note,\" was the response. \"But you don't want to think these were the real causes; they were usually jes' firebrands that made things worse. Most o' these hyeh feuds date back to enmities made in the Civil War an' in moonshinin'.\"  \"But why the war?\" asked Hamilton. \"I thought nearly all the mountaineers in Kentucky fought for the North--I know you were with Lee, of course, but I thought that was exceptional.\"  \"None o' them fought for the No'th!\" exclaimed the old Confederate soldier indignantly.  \"Why, Uncle Eli!\" said Hamilton, in surprise, \"I was sure that most of them went into the Union army.\"  \"So they did, boy, so they did, but those who did it thought they were fightin' for the nation, not for the No'th. An' the slavery question didn' matter much hyeh. Don' yo' let any one tell yo' that the Union army was made up o' abolitionists, because it wasn't. It was made up o' bigger men than that. It was made up o' patriots. I thought them wrong then,--I do yet; but thar ain't no denyin' that they were fightin' for what they thought was right.\"  \"But why did you join the South, Uncle Eli?\" asked the boy. \"I can understand father doing it, because he was a South Carolinian.\"  \"I was workin' fo' peace,\" the mountaineer rejoined \"When No'th and South was talkin' war, Kentucky, as yo' will remember havin' read, decided to remain neutral, an' organized the State Guards to preserve that neutrality. I was willin' to let well enough alone, but when the No'th come down an' tried to force the State Guards to join their cause, I went with the rest to Dixie. I don' believe,\" added the old man solemnly,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13181"],["title","The Boy With the U.S. Census (#3)"],["body"," \"that thar ever was a war like that befo', where every man on both sides fought for a principle, an' where there was no selfish motive anywhere.\"  \"The Howkles were with the Federals, weren't they?\" prompted Hamilton, fearing lest the old man should drift into war reminiscences, when he wanted to hear about feuds.  \"Ol' Isaac Howkle was,\" the mountaineer replied \"an' that was how the little trouble we had begun. At least, it had a good deal to do with it. Isaac an' I had never got along, an' jes' befo' the war, we had some words about the Kentucky State Guards. But I wasn't bearin' any grudge, an' I never supposed Isaac was. However, in a skirmish near Cumberland Gap, I saw that he was jes' achin' to get me, an' the way he tried was jes' about the meanes' thing I ever heard o' any one doin' on the Ridge.\"  \"How was it, do tell me?\" pleaded Hamilton, his eyes shining with interest.  \"Howkle was with Wolford's cavalry, an' I was under 'Fightin'' Zollicoffer, as they called him,\" the old man began. \"Thar had been a little skirmish,--one o' these that never get into the dispatches that don' do any good, but after which thar's always good men lef' lyin' on the ground. We had driven 'em back a bit, an' I was comin' in when I saw a lad--he didn't look more'n about fifteen--lyin' in a heap an' groanin'. Knowin' a drink would do him more good than an'thin' else, I reached for my canteen, an' stooped down. Jes' about then, a horseman dashed out o' the scrub an', almos' befo' I could think o' what was comin', he struck at me with his sabre.\"  \"When you were giving drink to a wounded soldier!\" cried Hamilton indignantly. \"What a cowardly trick!\"  \"It was ol' Isaac Howkle,\" nodded his uncle, \"an' I s'pose he reckoned this was a chance to get even on the ol' grudge. But I rolled over on the grass jes' out o' reach o' his stroke, an' he missed. I grabbed my rifle an' blazed at him as soon as I could get on my feet, but he had reached the shelter of the trees again an' I missed him.\"  \"That's about the meanest thing I ever heard,\" said the boy.  \"So I thought,\" the Kentuckian answered, \"an' so the poor lad seemed to think too. I saw he was tryin' to speak, an' I put my ear close to his lips, thinkin' he might have some message he wanted to give. But, tryin' to look in the direction where Howkle had gone, he whispered, 'Don't blame the Union.' He was thinkin' more o' the credit o' his side than of his own sufferin's.\"  \"That was grit,\" said Hamilton approvingly. \"Did he die, Uncle Eli?\"  \"Not a bit of it. We got him back into our lines an' he was exchanged, I believe. Anyway, I know he was livin' after the war, fo' I saw his name once on a list o' veterans. But most o' the boys were like that--mostly young, too--an' men o' the stripe of Isaac Howkle were very few.\"  \"But you got him in the end, didn't you?\"  The old mountaineer looked intently at the boy's excited face.  \"I didn't,\" he said, \"an' I don' rightly know that it's good for yo' to be hearin' all these things. Yo' might hold it against Jake Howkle.\"  \"That I wouldn't,\" protested Hamilton. \"Jake isn't to blame for his father's meanness.\"  \"That's the right way to talk,\" the old soldier agreed. \"Wa'al, if yo' feel that way about it, I reckon thar's no harm in my tellin' yo' the rest of it, now that I've got started. When the war was all over an' I got back hyeh, I remembered what had happened, an' I sent word to Isaac Howkle that I didn' trust him, an' after what he had done I was reckonin' that he was waitin' his chance to get me, an' that he'd better keep his own side o' the mountain.\"  \"But, Uncle Eli,\" said the boy, \"that didn't make a feud surely; that was only a warning.\"  \"I wasn't reckonin' to start a feud at all,\" said the old man thoughtfully, \"an' it really never was one. It was jes' a personal difference between Isaac Howkle an' me. Thar was lots o' times that I could have picked off either o' his two brothers, but I was jes' guardin' myself against Isaac.\"  \"But you said he got there first!\" said the boy. \"Did he shoot some one in your family?\"  \"Wa'al, yes, he did,\" the mountaineer admitted \"Yo' never knew the one. He was my brother-in-law,--Ab's younges' sister's first husband. He had been married jes' two months, an' was only a hundred yards from this house when Isaac shot him.\"  \"How did you know for sure that it was Howkle who had done the shooting?\" asked Hamilton.  \"We didn't know for sure, at first. A week or two after, a boy from the Wilshes' place come up with a message sayin' that Isaac Howkle had tol' him to say that he'd get the ol' man nex' time.\"  \"I shouldn't have thought a boy would have had the nerve to bring such a message,\" said Hamilton thoughtfully. \"Wouldn't bringing word like that look like taking sides, and wouldn't it bring his own family into the trouble!\"  The old man shook his head in instant denial.  \"Po' white trash from the gullies,\" he said, \"no, they don't count one way or the other.\"  \"What happened after you got that message?\" asked the boy.  \"Nothin' much, for a while, though I was snoopin' aroun' the mount'ns consid'rable. I met the brothers sev'ral times, an' I know they could have had me. But I had nothin' against them, nor they me, an' so it was jes' left to Isaac an' me. Once I found him over near our pasture, but he saw me an' got into cover. At last I found him in the open near our house again, an' in easy range.\"  \"Did you fire right away?\" asked Hamilton excitedly.  \"I didn't shoot. I got a lead on him, sure, but I jes' couldn't shoot without warnin' him. It seemed kind o' mean to shoot him unawares, an' as I didn't want to take an unfair advantage, I shouted to him. It was pretty far off to be heard, but I could see that he recognized me. I was only waitin' long enough to let him get his gun to his shoulder when some one fired jes' behin' me. Howkle's bullet went through my arm, but he dropped in his tracks. He thought I had shot him but my gun was never fired off.\"  \"Who was it that fired, Uncle Eli!\"  \"The brother o' the young fellow he had shot befo'.\"  \"Was he dead?\" asked the boy.  \"Wa'al,\" said the mountaineer, a little grimly, \"I didn' go down to see an' wait aroun' 'till all his friends gathered. But I reckon he was dead when they found him later.\"  \"And the brothers?\"  \"They never came into the story at all. I'm jes' mentionin' this to yo' to show yo' that thar's reason in my advisin' yo' to keep clar o' this district. If you're reckonin' on doin' census work, yo' go somewhar that you're not known to any one. Thar's trouble enough even for a stranger in the mount'ns, an' a stranger would find it easier than any one else.\"  \"Why is that, Uncle Eli?\" asked the boy.  \"In the first place, yo' can't show discourtesy to a stranger, an' yo' know that if he doesn' do things jes' the way yo' like to have 'em done, it's because he doesn' know, an' so he's not to blame. I like your spirit about the census, Hamilton,\" the old mountaineer continued, \"an' if yo' can give the gov'nment any service, I reckon yo'd better try, but leave the mount'n districts either to popular favorites or to a stranger.\"     CHAPTER II  RESCUING A LOST RACE   That same evening, as it chanced, one of the younger Wilsh boys came up to the house on an errand from a neighbor, and Hamilton, remembering that the messenger's father had been a go-between in the feud story he had been hearing, noted the lad with interest. Indeed, his appearance was striking enough in itself, with his drooping form, his extreme paleness, and his look of exhaustion.  \"How far is it from the Burtons, Uncle Eli?\" asked Hamilton.  \"Eight miles,\" was the reply.  Hamilton stared at the mountain boy. Judging from his looks he was not strong enough to walk a hundred yards, yet he had just come eight miles, and evidently was intending to walk back home that evening. Then Hamilton remembered that this lad was one of the \"poor whites\" of whom he had read so much, and he strolled toward the messenger who was sitting listlessly on one of the steps.  \"Howdy!\" said the newcomer in a tired voice.  Hamilton answered his greeting, and, after a few disjointed sentences, said:  \"You look tired. It must be a long walk from the Burtons.\"  \"Jes' tol'able,\" the boy answered. \"I'm not so tired. You f'm the city?\" he queried a few minutes later, evidently noting the difference between Hamilton's appearance and that of the boys in the neighborhood.  \"Yes, New York,\" answered Hamilton.  But the stranger did not show any further curiosity and Hamilton was puzzled to account for his general listlessness. He thought perhaps it might be that the boy was unusually dull and so he asked:  \"Are you still going to school?\"  A negative shake of the head was the only reply.  \"Why not? Isn't there a school near where you live?\"  \"Close handy, 'bout five miles,\" was the reply.  \"Then why don't you go there?\" questioned Hamilton further.  \"Teacheh's gone.\"  \"Funny time for holidays,\" the city boy remarked.  \"Not gone fo' holidays.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" said Hamilton, \"you mean he's gone for good. But aren't you going to have another one?\"  \"Dunno if he's gone for good,\" the mountain boy answered.  Hamilton stared in bewilderment.  \"Cunjer got him,\" the other continued.  But this did not explain things any better.  \"Cunjer?\" repeated Hamilton. \"You mean magic?\"  The mountain boy nodded.  \"Yes, cunjer,\" he affirmed.  \"You're fooling, aren't you?\" said Hamilton questioningly, \"you can't mean it. I never heard of 'cunjer' as a real thing. There's lots about it in books, of course, but those are fairy tales and things of that sort.\"  \"An' yo' never saw a cunjer?\"  \"Of course not.\"  \"Reckon they don' know as much in cities as they think they do,\" the youngster retorted.  \"Just what do you mean by 'cunjer'?\" asked Hamilton, knowing that it would be useless to argue the conditions of a modern city with a boy who had never seen one.  \"Bein' able to put a cunjer on, so's the one yo' cunjer has got to do anythin' yo'"]]]
