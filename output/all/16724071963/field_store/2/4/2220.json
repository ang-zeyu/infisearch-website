The gentle breeze favored   her progress, and as she sailed along, the snow danced like frozen   feathers around her.    \"Oh, how nice!\" cried little Bessie.    \"Yes, this clear, fresh, cold air gives one new life,\" said Mary   Matilda.    They now came to the Nashwaak, on the farther bank of which were   crouched a pack of hungry musquashes eagerly awaiting the approach of   Mary Matilda and little Bessie.    \"Hush,\" whispered the old big musquash. \"Make no noise or they will   hear us and make good their escape.\" But just then another musquash   carelessly trod on the big musquash's tail and the old musquash   roared with pain.    \"What was that?\" cried little Bessie.    Mary Matilda had heard the strange cry. She paused to listen. Then   she saw the pack of musquashes in the snow on the farthest bank of   the Nashwaak. Oh, how frightened she was! but with a shrill cry she   seized Bessie in her arms, and, turning swiftly about, fled in the   direction of McLeod hill. The musquashes saw her retreating, and with   a howl of commingled rage and disappointment they started in hot   pursuit. They ran like mad, as only starving musquashes can run.   Every moment they gained on the maiden and her human charge until at   last they were at her very heels. Mary Matilda remembered she had   some beechnuts in her pocket. She reached down, grasped a handful of   the succulent fruit and cast it to her insatiate pursuers. It stayed   their pursuit for a moment, but in another moment they were on her   track again, howling demoniacally. Another handful of the beechnuts   went to the ravenous horde, and still another. By this time Mary   Matilda had reached McLeod hill and was crossing the Nashwaaksis. Her   imagination pictured a scuttled brigantine lying in the frozen   stream. On its slippery deck stood a pirate, waving a gory cutlass.  [Illustration: THE PRINCE'S COAT-OF-ARMS--FLIGHT OF THE FAIR MARY MATILDA--THE AGGRAVATING MIRAGE.]    \"Ha, ha, ho, ho!\" laughed the gory and bearded pirate.    \"Save me!\" cried Mary Matilda. \"My beechnuts are all gone!\"    \"Throw them the baby!\" answered the bearded pirate, \"and save   yourself! Ha, ha, ho, ho!\"    Should she do it? Should she throw little Bessie to the devouring   musquashes? No, she could not stoop to that ungenerous deed.    \"No, base pirate!\" she cried. \"I would not so demean myself!\"    But the scuttled brigantine had disappeared. Mary Matilda saw it was   a mirage. Meanwhile the musquashes gained on her. The beechnuts had   whetted their appetite. It seemed as if they were sure of their prey.   But all at once they stopped, and Mary Matilda stopped, too. They   were confronted by a haggard but manly form. It was the mysterious   young stranger, and he had a saw which Eddie Martin had lent him. His   aspect was so terrible that the musquashes turned to flee, but they   were too late. The mysterious stranger laid about him so vigorously   with his saw that the musquashes soon were in bits. Here was a tail,   there a leg; here an ear, there a nose--oh, it was a rare potpourri,   I can tell you! Finally the musquashes all were dead.    \"To whom am I indebted for my salvation?\" inquired Mary Matilda,   blushing deeply.    \"Alas, I do not know,\" replied the wan stranger. \"I am called Juan,   but my lineage is enveloped in gloom.\"    At once Mary Matilda suspected he was her brother's missing friend,   and this suspicion was confirmed by the lavender trousers he wore.   She questioned him closely, and he told her all. Bessie heard all he   said, and she could tell you more particularly than I can about it. I   only know that Juan confessed that, having tasted of Mary Matilda's   cake, he fell deeply in love with her and had come all this distance   to ask her to be his, indissolubly.    \"Still,\" said he, sadly, \"'tis too much to ask you to link your   destiny with one whose lineage is not known.\"    By this time they had reached the back-yard gate. Eddie Martin was   sitting on the wood-pile talking with a weird old woman. The weird   old woman scrutinized Mary Matilda closely.    \"Do you know me?\" she asked.    \"No,\" said Mary Matilda.    \"I have been serving ten years for a mild indiscretion,\" said the old   woman, sadly. \"I am the gypsy who told your fortune many years ago.\"    Then the old gypsy's keen eyes fell on Juan, the stranger. She gave a   fierce cry.    \"I have seen that face before!\" she cried, trembling with emotion.   \"When I knew it, it was a baby face; but the spectacles are still the   same!\"  [Illustration: BROTHER SLOSSON AND HIS OTHER FRIEND EN ROUTE TO THE WEDDING.]    Juan also quivered with emotion.    \"Have you a thistle mark on your left arm?\" demanded the old gypsy,   fiercely.    \"Yes,\" he answered, hoarsely; and pulling up the sleeve of his linen   ulster he exposed the beautiful emblem on his emaciated arm.    \"It is as I suspected!\" cried the old gypsy. \"You are the Prince of   Lochdougal, heir presumptive to the estates and titles of the   Stuarts.\" And with these words the old gypsy swooned in Eddie   Martin's arms.    When she came to, she explained that she had been a stewardess in the   Lochdougal castle at Inverness when Juan's parents had been exiled   for alleged conspiracy against the queen. Juan was then a prattling   babe; but even then he gave promise of a princely future. Since his   arrival at maturity his parents had feared to impart to him the   secret of his lineage, lest he might return to Scotland and attempt   to recover his estates, thereby incurring the resentment of the   existing dynasty.    Of course when she heard of his noble lineage, Mary Matilda could do   naught but accept the addresses of the brave prince. He speedily   regained his health and flesh under the grateful influences of her   cuisine. The wedding day has been set, and little Bessie is to be one   of her bridesmaids. The brother Slosson is to be present, and he is   to bring with him his other friend, whose name he will not mention,   since his lineage is still in doubt.     CHAPTER III  SOME LETTERS   \"There's no art,\" said the doomed Duncan, \"to find the mind's construction in the face,\" nor after a somewhat extensive acquaintance with men and their letters am I inclined to think there is very much to be found of the true individuality of men in their letters. All men, and especially literary men, seem to consider themselves on dress parade in their correspondence, and pose accordingly. Ninety-nine persons out of a hundred are more self-conscious in writing than they are in talking. Even the least conscious seem to imagine that what they put down in black and white is to pass under some censorious eye. The professional writer, whether his reputation be international, like that of a Lowell or a Stevenson, or confined to the circle of his village associates, never appears to pen a line without some affectation. The literary artist does this with an ease and grace that provokes comment upon its charming naturalness, the journeyman only occasions some remark upon his effort to \"show off.\" If language was given us to conceal thoughts, letter writing goes a step further and puts the black-and-white mask of deliberation on language.  Eugene Field was no exception to the rule that literary men scarcely ever write letters for the mere perusal or information of the recipient. He almost always wrote for an ulterior effect or for an ulterior audience. But he seldom wrote letters deliberately for reproduction in his \"Memoirs.\" If he had done so they would have been written so skilfully that he would have made himself out to be pretty much the particular kind of a character he pleased. For obvious reasons most of the communications that passed between Field and myself were verbal, across a partition in the office, or by notes that were destroyed as soon as they had served their purpose. That Field had other correspondents the following request for a postage stamp will testify:    _THE GOOD KNIGHT'S DIPLOMACY.[1]    One evening in his normal plight   The good but impecunious knight       Addressing Thompson said:   \"Methinks a great increasing fame   Shall add new glory to thy name,       And cluster round thy head.    \"There is no knight but he will yield   Before thy valor in the Field       Or in exploits of arms;   And all admit the pleasing force   Of thy most eloquent discourse--       Such are thy social charms.    \"Alike to lord and vassal dear   Thou dost incline a pitying ear       To fellow-men in pain;   And be he wounded, sick, or broke,   No brother knight doth e'er invoke       Thy knightly aid in vain.    \"Such--such a gentle knight thou art,   And it is solace to my heart       To have so fair a friend.   No better, sweeter boon I pray   Than thy affection--by the way,       Hast thou a stamp to lend?\"    \"Aye, marry, 'tis my sweet delight   To succor such an honest knight!\"       Sir Thompson straight replied.   Field caught the proffered treasure up,   Then tossing off a stirrup-cup       From out the castle hied.    July 2d, 1885._    [1] In this specimen of Field's privately circulated verse, as in   his letters, his own punctuation and capitalization are followed.   He had a system of his own which, when complicated with the   office style of the News, resulted in most admirable confusion   and inconsistency.  Was ever request for so small a \"boon\" couched in such lordly pomp of phrase and in such insinuating rhyme?  It was shortly after Field secured this boon that he had his first opportunity to waste postage stamps on me. With a party of friends I went up to Mackinac Island to spend a few days. By the first mail that reached the island after I had registered at the old Island House, I received a letter bearing in no less than five different colored inks the following unique superscription:    For that Most Illustrious and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],["title","Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 2 (#6)"],["body"," Knight Errant,   _Sir Slosson Thompson_,   Erstwhile of Chicago, but now illumining   _Mackinac Island, Michigan,_    Where, under civic guise, he is accomplishing prodigious slaughter   among the fish that do infest that coast.  It may be taken for granted that the clerks and the hotel guests were consumed with curiosity as to the contents of an envelope over which they had a chance to speculate before it reached me. These were:    CHICAGO, July 19th, 1885.    SWEET KNIGHT:    Heedful of the promise I made to thee prior to thy setting out for   the far-distant province of Mackinac, I am minded to temporarily lay   aside the accoutrements of war and the chase, and pen thee this   missive wherein I do discourse of all that has happened since thy   departure. Upon Saturday I did lunch with that ill-tempered knight,   Sir P----, and in the evening did I discuss a goodly feast with Sir   Cowan, than whom a more hospitable knight doth not exist--saving only   and always thyself, which art the paragon of courtesy. This day did I   lunch at my own expense, but in very sooth I had it charged, whereat   did the damned Dutchman sorely lament. Would to God I were now   assured at whose expense I shall lunch upon the morrow and the many   days that must elapse ere thy coming hence.    By this courier I send thee divers rhymes which may divert thee.   Soothly they are most honest chronicles, albeit in all modesty I may   say they do not o'erpraise me.    The good Knight Melville crieth it from the battlements that he will   go into a far country next week. Meanwhile the valorous Sir   Ballantyne saweth wood but sayeth naught. That winsome handmaiden   Birdie quitteth our service a week hence; marry, I shall miss the   wench.    The fair lady Julia doth commend thy prudence in getting out of the   way ere she reproaches thee for seducing the good Knight into that   Milwaukee journey, of the responsibility of which naughtiness I have   in very sooth washed my hands as clean as a sheep's liver.    By what good fortune, too, hast thou escaped the heat and toil of   this irksome weather. By my halidom the valor trickleth down my   knightly chin as I pen these few lines, and my shirt cleaveth to my   back like a porous plaster. The good knight of the Talking Cat   speaketh to me of taking his vacation in the middle of August,   whereat I much grieve, having a mind to hie me away at that sweet   season myself.    One sumptuous feast have we already had at thy expense at Boyle's, as   by the check thou shalt descry on thy return. Sir Harper did send me   a large fish from Lake Okeboji to-day, which the same did I and my   heirdom devour triumphantly this very evening. I have not beheld the   Knight of the Lawn since thy departure. Make fair obeisance to the   sweet ladies who are with thee, and remember me in all courtesy to   Sir Barbour, the good Knight of the Four Winds.    Kissing thy hand a thousand times, I sign myself   Thy loyal and sweet servant,    FIELD,   The Good and Honest Knight.  Under another cover addressed ostentatiously:  \"For the Good and Generous Knight, Sir Slosson Thompson, now summering amid rejoicings and with triumphant cheer at Mackinac Island, Michigan,\"  came the following poem, entitled:    _THE GOOD SIR SLOSSON'S EPISODE WITH THE GARRULOUS SIR BARBOUR    Sir Slosson and companions three--   With hearts that reeked with careless glee--       Strode down the golden sand,   And pausing on the pebbly shore,   They heard the sullen, solemn roar       Of surf on every hand.    Then Lady Florence said \"I ween\"--   \"Nay, 'tis not half so grand a scene,\"       Sir Barbour quickly cried,   \"As you may see in my fair state,   Where swings the well-greased golden gate       Above the foamy tide.\"    Sir Slosson quoth, \"In very sooth\"--   \"Nay, say not so, impetuous youth,\"       Sir Barbour made his boast:   \"This northern breeze will not compare   With that delicious perfumed air       Which broods upon our coast.\"    Then Lady Helen fain would say   Her word, but in his restless way       Sir Barbour nipped that word;   The other three were dumb perforce--   Except Sir Barbour's glib discourse,       No human sound was heard.    And even that majestic roar   Of breakers on the northern shore       Sank to a murmur low;   The winds recoiled and cried, \"I' sooth,   Until we heard this 'Frisco youth,       We reckoned we could blow!\"    Sir Slosson paled with pent-up ire--   His eyes emitted fitful fire--       With rage his blood congealed;   Yet, exercising sweet restraint,   He swore no vow and breathed no plaint--       But pined for Good Old Field.    The ladies, too, we dare to say,   (If they survived that fateful day),       Eschew all 'Frisco men,   Who, as perchance you have inferred,   Won't let a person get a word       In edgewise now and then._  The subject of the good-natured and clever satire was our mutual friend, Barbour Lathrop, with whom I had been associated in journalism in San Francisco and who is famous from the Bohemian Club literally around the globe and in many of its most out-of-the-way islands as a most entertaining, albeit incessant, story-teller and conversationalist. Pretty nearly all subjects that interest humanity have engaged his attention. He could no more rest from travel than Ulysses; and he brought to those he associated with all the fruits that faring forth in strange lands could give to a mind singularly alert for education and experience under any and all conditions. His fondness for monologue frequently exposed him to raillery, like the above, in the column where Field daily held a monopoly of table talk.  But the episode with the \"Garrulous Sir Barbour\" was not the rhyme of chief interest (to Field and me) forwarded by \"this courier.\"  This was confided to a third envelope even more elaborately addressed and embellished than either of the others, as follows:    For the valorous, joyous, Triumphant and Glorious Knight,   The ever gentle and Courteous Flower of Chivalry,   Cream of Knight Errantry and Pole Star of Manly virtues,   _Sir Slosson Thompson_,   who doth for the nonce sojourn at   _Mackinac Island, Michigan_,    Where under the guise of a lone Fisherman he is   regaled with sumptuous   cheer and divers rejoicings,   wherein he doth right merrily disport.  The rhyme under this cover in which the impecunious knight did not \"overpraise\" himself bore the title \"How the Good Knight protected Sir Slosson's Credit,\" and was well calculated to fill me with forebodings. It ran in this wise:    _One midnight hour, Sir Ballantyne   Addressed Old Field: \"Good comrade mine,         The times i' faith are drear;   Since you have not a son to spend   I would to God our generous friend         Sir Slosson now were here!\"    Then spake the Impecunious Knight,   Regardful of his piteous plight:         \"Odds bobs, you say the truth;   For since our friend has gone away,   It doth devolve on thee to pay--         Else would I starve i' sooth.\"    Emerging from their lofty lair   This much bereaved but worthy pair         Proceeded unto Boyle's,   Agreed that buttered toast would do.   Although they were accustomed to         The choicest roasts and broils.    \"Heyday, sir knights,\" a varlet cried   ('Twas Charlie, famous far and wide         As Boyle's devoted squire);   \"Sir Slosson telegraphs me to   Deliver straightway unto you         Whatever you desire.\"    The knights with radiant features saw   The message dated Mackinaw--         Then ordered sumptuous cheer;   Two dollars' worth, at least, they \"cheered\"   While from his counter Charlie leered         An instigating leer.    I wot poor Charlie did not dream   The telegram was but a scheme         To mulct Sir Slosson's pelf;   For in the absence of his friend   The Honest Knight made bold to send         That telegram himself.    Oh, honest Field I to keep aright   The credit of an absent Knight--         And undefiled his name!   Upon such service for thy friends   Such knightly courtesies depends         Thy everlasting fame!_  Two days later I received a postal written in a disguised hand by Ballantyne, I think, and purporting to come from \"Charlie,\" showing the progress of the conspiracy to mulct Sir Slosson's pelf. It read:    FRIEND THOMPSON,    Fields and Ballantyne gave me the telegram tonight ordering one   supper. But they have been eating all the week at your expense. Is   it all right?    Yours,    CHAS. BURKEY.  And by the same mail came this comforting epistle from the arch conspirator:    CHICAGO, July the 22d, 1885.    DEAR SIR KNIGHT:    I have been too busy to reply to your many kind letters before this.   On receipt of your telegram last night, we went to Boyle's and had   sumptuous cheer at your expense. Charlie has begun to demur, and   intends to write you a letter. Browne wrote me a note the other day.   I enclose it to you. Please keep it for me. I hope your work will   pan out more successfully.    I had a long talk with Stone to-night, and churned him up about the   paper. He agreed with me in nearly all particulars. He is going to   fire W---- when D---- goes (August 1). He said, \"I am going to have a   lively shaking up at that time.\" One important change I am not at   liberty to specify, but you will approve it. By the way, Stone spoke   very highly of you and your work. It would be safe for you to strike   him on the salary question as soon as you please. The weather is   oppressively warm. Things run along about so so in the office.   Hawkins told me he woke up the other night, and could not go to sleep   again till he had sung a song. The Dutch girls at Henrici's inquire   tenderly for you.... Hastily yours,    EUGENE FIELD.  The note from Mr. Browne here mentioned related to the proposed publication of a collection of Field's verse and stories. The Browne was Francis F., for a long time editor of The Dial, and at that time holding the position of principal reader for A.C. McClurg &"]]]
