Even if one should come here, your father would kill him.\"  \"And would you kill him, too, little Marie?\"  \"We would all kill him, for you would help us, my Pierre, wouldn't you? You're not afraid, I know. You would hit him hard!\"  \"Yes, yes,\" said the child, proudly, assuming a heroic attitude, \"we would kill 'em.\"  \"There's no one like you for talking to children,\" said Germain to little Marie, \"and for making them hear reason. To be sure, it isn't long since you were a child yourself, and you remember what your mother used to say to you. I believe that the younger one is, the better one understands the young. I am very much afraid that a woman of thirty, who doesn't know what it is to be a mother, will find it hard to learn to prattle and reason with young brats.\"  \"Why so, Germain? I don't know why you have such a bad idea of this woman; you'll get over it!\"  \"To the devil with the woman!\" said Germain. \"I would like to go home and never come back here. What do I need of a woman I don't know!\"  \"Little father,\" said the child, \"why do you keep talking about your wife to-day, when she is dead?\"  \"Alas! you haven't forgotten your poor dear mother, have you?\"  \"No, for I saw them put her in a pretty box of white wood, and my grandma took me to her to kiss her and bid her good-by!--She was all white and cold, and every night my aunt tells me to pray to the good Lord to let her get warm with Him in heaven. Do you think she's there now?\"  \"I hope so, my child; but you must keep on praying: that shows your mother that you love her.\"  \"I am going to say my prayer,\" replied the child; \"I did not think of saying it this evening. But I can't say it all by myself; I always forget something. Little Marie must help me.\"  \"Yes, Pierre, I will help you,\" said the girl. \"Come, kneel here by my side.\"  The child knelt on the girl's skirt, clasped his little hands, and began to repeat his prayer with interest and fervently at first, for he knew the beginning very well; then more slowly and hesitatingly, and at last repeating word for word what Marie dictated to him, when he reached that point in his petition beyond which he had never been able to learn, as he always fell asleep just there every night. On this occasion, the labor of paying attention and the monotony of his own tones produced their customary effect, so that he pronounced the last syllables only with great effort, and after they had been repeated three times; his head grew heavy, and fell against Marie's breast: his hands relaxed, separated, and fell open upon his knees. By the light of the camp-fire, Germain looked at his little angel nodding against the girl's heart, while she, holding him in her arms and warming his fair hair with her sweet breath, abandoned herself to devout reverie and prayed mentally for Catherine's soul.  Germain was deeply moved, and tried to think of something to say to little Marie to express the esteem and gratitude she inspired in him, but he could find nothing that would give voice to his thoughts. He approached her to kiss his son, whom she was still holding against her breast, and it was hard for him to remove his lips from Petit-Pierre's brow.  \"You kiss him too hard,\" said Marie, gently pushing the ploughman's head away, \"you will wake him. Let me put him to bed again, for he has gone back to his dreams of paradise.\"  The child let her put him down, but as he stretched himself out on the goat-skin of the saddle, he asked if he were on Grise. Then, opening his great blue eyes, and gazing at the branches for a moment, he seemed to be in a waking dream, or to be impressed by an idea that had come into his mind during the day and took shape at the approach of sleep. \"Little father,\" he said, \"if you're going to give me another mother, I want it to be little Marie.\"  And, without awaiting a reply, he closed his eyes and went to sleep.     X  DESPITE THE COLD   Little Marie seemed to pay no further heed to the child's strange words than to look upon them as a proof of friendship; she wrapped him up carefully, stirred the fire, and, as the mist lying upon the neighboring pool gave no sign of lifting, she advised Germain to lie down near the fire and have a nap.  \"I see that you're almost asleep now,\" she said, \"for you don't say a word, and you are staring at the fire just as your little one did just now. Come, go to sleep, and I will watch over you and the child.\"  \"You're the one to go to sleep,\" replied the ploughman, \"and I will watch both of you, for I never was less inclined to sleep; I have fifty ideas in my head.\"  \"Fifty, that's a good many,\" said the maiden, with some suggestion of mockery in her tone; \"there are so many people who would like to have one!\"  \"Well, if I am not capable of having fifty, at all events I have one that hasn't left me for an hour.\"  \"And I'll tell you what it is, as well as the ones you had before it.\"  \"Very good! tell me, if you can guess, Marie; tell me yourself, I shall like that.\"  \"An hour ago,\" she retorted, \"you had the idea of eating, and now you have the idea of sleeping.\"  \"Marie, I am only an ox-driver at best, but really, you seem to take me for an ox. You're a bad girl, and I see that you don't want to talk with me. Go to sleep, that will be better than criticising a man who isn't in good spirits.\"  \"If you want to talk, let us talk,\" said the girl, half-reclining beside the child and resting her head against the saddle. \"You're determined to worry, Germain, and in that you don't show much courage for a man. What should I not say, if I didn't fight as hard as I can against my own grief?\"  \"What, indeed; and that is just what I have in my head, my poor child! You're going to live far away from your people in a wretched place, all moors and bogs, where you will catch the fever in autumn, where there's no profit in raising sheep for wool, which always vexes a shepherdess who is interested in her business; and then you will be among strangers who may not be kind to you, who won't understand what you are worth. Upon my word, it pains me more than I can tell you, and I have a mind to take you back to your mother, instead of going to Fourche.\"  \"You speak very kindly, but without sense, my poor Germain; one shouldn't be cowardly for his friends, and instead of pointing out the dark side of my lot, you ought to show me the bright side, as you did when we dined at La Rebec's.\"  \"What would you have? that's the way things looked to me then, and they look different now. You would do better to find a husband.\"  \"That can't be, Germain, as I told you; and as it can't be, I don't think about it.\"  \"But suppose you could find one, after all? Perhaps, if you would tell me what sort of a man you'd like him to be, I could succeed in thinking up some one.\"  \"To think up some one is not to find him. I don't think about it at all, for it's of no use.\"  \"You have never thought of finding a rich husband?\"  \"No, of course not, as I am poor as Job.\"  \"But if he should be well off, you wouldn't be sorry to be well lodged, well fed, well dressed, and to belong to a family of good people who would allow you to help your mother along?\"  \"Oh! as to that, yes! to help my mother is my only wish.\"  \"And if you should meet such a man, even if he wasn't in his first youth, you wouldn't object very much?\"  \"Oh! excuse me, Germain. That's just the thing I am particular about. I shouldn't like an old man.\"  \"An old man, of course not; but a man of my age, for instance?\"  \"Your age is old for me, Germain; I should prefer Bastien so far as age goes, though Bastien isn't such a good-looking man as you.\"  \"You would prefer Bastien the swineherd?\" said Germain bitterly. \"A fellow with eyes like the beasts he tends!\"  \"I would overlook his eyes for the sake of his eighteen years.\"  Germain had a horrible feeling of jealousy.--\"Well, well,\" he said, \"I see that your mind is set on Bastien. It's a queer idea, all the same!\"  \"Yes, it would be a queer idea,\" replied little Marie, laughing heartily, \"and he would be a queer husband. You could make him believe whatever you chose. For instance, I picked up a tomato in monsieur le cur√©'s garden the other day; I told him it was a fine red apple, and he bit into it like a glutton. If you had seen the wry face he made! _Mon Dieu_, how ugly he was!\"  \"You don't love him then, as you laugh at him?\"  \"That wouldn't be any reason. But I don't love him: he's cruel to his little sister, and he isn't clean.\"  \"Very good! and you don't feel inclined toward anybody else?\"  \"What difference does it make to you, Germain?\"  \"No difference, it's just for something to talk about. I see, my girl, that you have a sweetheart in your head already.\"  \"No, Germain, you're mistaken, I haven't one yet; it may come later: but as I shall not marry till I have saved up a little money, it will be my lot to marry late and to marry an old man.\"  \"Well, then, take an old man now.\"  \"No indeed! when I am no longer young myself, it will be all the same to me; now it would be different.\"  \"I see, Marie, that you don't like me; that's very clear,\" said Germain angrily, and without weighing his words.  Little Marie did not reply. Germain leaned over her: she was asleep; she had fallen back, conquered, struck down, as it were, by drowsiness, like children who fall asleep while they are prattling.  Germain was well pleased that she had not heard his last words; he realized that they were unwise, and he turned his back upon her, trying to change the current of his thoughts.  But it was of no avail, he could not sleep, nor could he think of anything else than what he had just said. He walked around the fire twenty times, walked away and returned; at last, feeling as excited as if he had swallowed a mouthful of gunpowder,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12820"],["title","The Case for India (#0)"],["body","CASE FOR INDIA  The Presidential Address Delivered by Annie Besant at the Thirty-Second Indian National Congress Held at Calcutta 26th December 1917        FELLOW-DELEGATES AND FRIENDS,  Everyone who has preceded me in this Chair has rendered his thanks in fitting terms for the gift which is truly said to be the highest that India has it in her power to bestow. It is the sign of her fullest love, trust, and approval, and the one whom she seats in that chair is, for his year of service, her chosen leader. But if my predecessors found fitting words for their gratitude, in what words can I voice mine, whose debt to you is so overwhelmingly greater than theirs? For the first time in Congress history, you have chosen as your President one who, when your choice was made, was under the heavy ban of Government displeasure, and who lay interned as a person dangerous to public safety. While I was humiliated, you crowned me with honour; while I was slandered, you believed in my integrity and good faith; while I was crushed under the heel of bureaucratic power, you acclaimed me as your leader; while I was silenced and unable to defend myself, you defended me, and won for me release. I was proud to serve in lowliest fashion, but you lifted me up and placed me before the world as your chosen representative. I have no words with which to thank you, no eloquence with which to repay my debt. My deeds must speak for me, for words are too poor. I turn your gift into service to the Motherland; I consecrate my life anew to her in worship by action. All that I have and am, I lay on the Altar of the Mother, and together we shall cry, more by service than by words: VANDE MATARAM.  There is, perhaps, one value in your election of me in this crisis of India‚Äôs destiny, seeing that I have not the privilege to be Indian-born, but come from that little island in the northern seas which has been, in the West, the builder-up of free institutions. The Aryan emigrants, who spread over the lands of Europe, carried with them the seeds of liberty sown in their blood in their Asian cradle-land. Western historians trace the self-rule of the Saxon villages to their earlier prototypes in the East, and see the growth of English liberty as up-springing from the Aryan root of the free and self-contained village communities.  Its growth was crippled by Norman feudalism there, as its millennia-nourished security here was smothered by the East India Company. But in England it burst its shackles and nurtured a liberty-loving people and a free Commons‚Äô House. Here, it similarly bourgeoned out into the Congress activities, and more recently into those of the Muslim League, now together blossoming into Home Rule for India. The England of Milton, Cromwell, Sydney, Burke, Paine, Shelley, Wilberforce, Gladstone; the England that sheltered Mazzini, Kossuth, Kropotkin, Stepniak, and that welcomed Garibaldi; the England that is the enemy of tyranny, the foe of autocracy, the lover of freedom, that is the England I would fain here represent to you to-day. To-day, when India stands erect, no suppliant people, but a Nation, self-conscious, self-respecting, determined to be free; when she stretches out her hand to Britain and offers friendship not subservience; co-operation not obedience; to-day let me: western-born but in spirit eastern, cradled in England but Indian by choice and adoption: let me stand as the symbol of union between Great Britain and India: a union of hearts and free choice, not of compulsion: and therefore of a tie which cannot be broken, a tie of love and of mutual helpfulness, beneficial to both Nations and blessed by God.  GONE TO THE PEACE.  India‚Äôs great leader, Dadabhai Naoroji, has left his mortal body and is now one of the company of the Immortals, who watch over and aid India‚Äôs progress. He is with V.C. Bonnerjee, and Ranade, and A.O. Hume, and Henry Cotton, and Pherozeshah Mehta, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale: the great men who, in Swinburne‚Äôs noble verse, are the stars which lead us to Liberty‚Äôs altar:      These, O men, shall ye honour,         Liberty only and these.     For thy sake and for all men‚Äôs and mine,     Brother, the crowns of them shine,     Lighting the way to her shrine,     That our eyes may be fastened upon her,         That our hands may encompass her knees.  Not for me to praise him in feeble words of reverence or of homage. His deeds praise him, and his service to his country is his abiding glory. Our gratitude will be best paid by following in his footsteps, alike in his splendid courage and his unfaltering devotion, so that we may win the Home Rule which he longed to see while with us, and shall see, ere long, from the other world of Life, in which he dwells to-day.     CHAPTER I.  PRE-WAR MILITARY EXPENDITURE.   The Great War, into the whirlpool of which Nation after Nation has been drawn, has entered on its fourth year. The rigid censorship which has been established makes it impossible for any outside the circle of Governments to forecast its duration, but to me, speaking for a moment not as a politician but as a student of spiritual laws, to me its end is sure. For the true object of this War is to prove the evil of, and to destroy, autocracy and the enslavement of one Nation by another, and to place on sure foundations the God-given Right to Self-Rule and Self-Development of every Nation, and the similar right of the Individual, of the smaller Self, so far as is consistent with the welfare of the larger Self of the Nation. The forces which make for the prolongation of autocracy--the rule of one--and the even deadlier bureaucracy--the rule of a close body welded into an iron system--these have been gathered together in the Central Powers of Europe--as of old in Ravana--in order that they may be destroyed; for the New Age cannot be opened until the Old passes away. The new civilisation of Righteousness and Justice, and therefore of Brotherhood, of ordered Liberty, of Peace, of Happiness, cannot be built up until the elements are removed which have brought the old civilisation crashing about our ears. Therefore is it necessary that the War shall be fought out to its appointed end, and that no premature peace shall leave its object unattained. Autocracy and bureaucracy must perish utterly, in East and West, and, in order that their germs may not re-sprout in the future, they must be discredited in the minds of men. They must be proved to be less efficient than the Governments of Free Peoples, even in their favourite work of War, and their iron machinery--which at first brings outer prosperity and success--must be shown to be less lasting and effective than the living and flexible organisations of democratic Peoples. They must be proved failures before the world, so that the glamour of superficial successes may be destroyed for ever. They have had their day and their place in evolution, and have done their educative work. Now they are out-of-date, unfit for survival, and must vanish away.  When Great Britain sprang to arms, it was in defence of the freedom of a small nation, guaranteed by treaties, and the great principles she proclaimed electrified India and the Dominions. They all sprang to her side without question, without delay; they heard the voice of old England, the soldier of Liberty, and it thrilled their hearts. All were unprepared, save the small territorial army of Great Britain, due to the genius and foresight of Lord Haldane, and the readily mobilised army of India, hurled into the fray by the swift decision of Lord Hardinge. The little army of Britain fought for time; fought to stop the road to Paris, the heart of France; fought, falling back step by step, and gained the time it fought for, till India‚Äôs sons stood on the soil of France, were flung to the front, rushed past the exhausted regiments who cheered them with failing breath, charged the advancing hosts, stopped the retreat, and joined the British army in forming that unbreakable line which wrestled to the death through two fearful winters--often, these soldiers of the tropics, waist-deep in freezing mud--and knew no surrender.  India, with her clear vision, saw in Great Britain the champion of Freedom, in Germany the champion of Despotism. And she saw rightly. Rightly she stood by Great Britain, despite her own lack of freedom and the coercive legislation which outrivalled German despotism, knowing these to be temporary, because un-English, and therefore doomed to destruction; she spurned the lure of German gold and rejected German appeals to revolt. She offered men and money; her educated classes, her Vakils, offered themselves as Volunteers, pleaded to be accepted. Then the never-sleeping distrust of Anglo-India rejected the offer, pressed for money, rejected men. And, slowly, educated India sank back, depressed and disheartened, and a splendid opportunity for knitting together the two Nations was lost.  Early in the War I ventured to say that the War could not end until England recognised that autocracy and bureaucracy must perish in India as well as in Europe. The good Bishop of Calcutta, with a courage worthy of his free race, lately declared that it would be hypocritical to pray for victory over autocracy in Europe and to maintain it in India. Now it has been clearly and definitely declared that Self-Government is to be the objective of Great Britain in India, and that a substantial measure of it is to be given at once; when this promise is made good by the granting of the Reforms outlined last year in Lucknow, then the end of the War will be in sight. For the War cannot end till the death-knell of autocracy is sounded.  Causes, with which I will deal presently and for which India was not responsible, have somewhat obscured the first eager expressions of India‚Äôs sympathy, and have forced her thoughts largely towards her own position in the Empire. But that does not detract from the immense aid she has given, and is still giving. It"]]]
