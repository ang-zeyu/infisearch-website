SALZBACHER'S CHOCOLATE HEARTS  Melt, by standing over hot water, three ounces of unsweetened chocolate; add a pound of sifted powdered sugar and mix thoroughly; work to a stiff yet pliable paste with the unbeaten whites of three eggs (or less), adding vanilla to flavor. If the paste seems too soft, add more sugar. Break off in small pieces and roll out about one-fourth of an inch thick, sprinkling the board and paste with granulated sugar instead of flour. Cut with a tiny heart-shaped cake cutter (any other small cake cutter will do), and place on pans oiled just enough to prevent sticking. Bake in a very moderate oven. When done, they will feel firm to the touch, a solid crust having formed over the top. They should be very light, and will loosen easily from the pan after being allowed to stand a moment to cool.

If properly made, they are very excellent and but little labor. Use the yolks for chocolate whips.--_From \"Good Housekeeping.\"_   COCOA CHARLOTTE (Without Cream)      1 pint of water,     Whites of 2 eggs,     1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla,     1/2 a cup of sugar,     2 level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,     1/2 a teaspoonful of cinnamon,     3 tablespoonfuls of cocoa.  Dissolve the cornstarch in a quarter of a cup of cold water, add it to the pint of boiling water, stir until it thickens, add the sugar and the cocoa, which have been thoroughly mixed together. Remove from the fire, add the cinnamon and vanilla, and pour slowly over the stiffly beaten whites of eggs. Pour at once into a pudding mould, and put away in a cold place to harden.

Have ready wafer paper cut round, on which lay pieces of the mixture rolled to fit the wafer. Press one-half a blanched almond on each macaroon and bake in a moderate oven.   PETITS FOUR  Bake a simple, light sponge cake in a shallow biscuit tin or dripping pan, and when cold turn out on the moulding board and cut into small dominoes or diamonds. They should be about an inch in depth. Split each one and spread jelly or frosting between the layers, then ice tops and sides with different tinted icings, pale green flavored with pistachio, pale pink with rose, yellow with orange, white with almond. Little domino cakes are also pretty. Ice the cakes on top and sides with white icing, then when hard put on a second layer of chocolate, using _Walter Baker & Co.'s Unsweetened Chocolate_ and made as for layer cake, dipping the brush in the melted chocolate to make the spots.  Candied violets, bits of citron cut in fancy shapes, candied cherries and angelica may all be utilized in making pretty designs in decoration.--_American Housekeeper._   POTATO CAKE  Two cups of white sugar, one cup of butter, one cup of hot mashed potatoes, one cup of chopped walnuts, half a cup of sweet milk, two cups of flour, four eggs well beaten, five teaspoonfuls of melted chocolate, one tablespoonful each of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder.

Ice on top and between the layers.     _Home Made Candies_  Recipes Specially Prepared _by_ Mrs. Janet McKenzie Hill   PEPPERMINTS, CHOCOLATE MINTS, Etc. (Uncooked Fondant)  [Illustration: PEPPERMINTS, CHOCOLATE MINTS, ETC.]      White of 1 egg,     2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,     Sifted confectioner's sugar,     1/2 teaspoonful of essence of peppermint or a few drops of oil of         peppermint,     1 or 2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,     Green color paste,     Pink color paste.  Beat the egg on a plate, add the cold water and gradually work in sugar enough to make a firm paste. Divide the sugar paste into three parts. To one part add the peppermint and a very little of the green color paste. Take the paste from the jar with a wooden tooth pick, add but a little. Work and knead the mixture until the paste is evenly distributed throughout. Roll the candy into a sheet one-fourth an inch thick, then cut out into small rounds or other shape with any utensil that is convenient. Color the second part a very delicate pink, flavor with rose extract and cut out in the same manner as the first. To the last part add one or two squares of Baker's Chocolate, melted over hot water, and flavor with peppermint. Add also a little water, as the chocolate will make the mixture thick and crumbly. Begin by adding a tablespoonful of water, then add more if necessary, knead and cut these as the others.   CHOCOLATE CARAMEL WALNUTS (Uncooked Fondant)  [Illustration: CHOCOLATE CARAMEL WALNUTS.]      White of 1 egg,     3 tablespoonfuls of maple or caramel syrup,     1 tablespoonful of water,     Sifted confectioner's sugar,     1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract,     2 or more squares of Baker's Chocolate,     English walnuts.  Beat the white of egg slightly, add the syrup, water, sugar as needed, the chocolate, melted over hot water, and the vanilla, also more water if necessary. Work with a silver plated knife and knead until thoroughly mixed, then break off small pieces of uniform size and roll them into balls, in the hollow of the hand, flatten the balls a little, set the half of an English walnut upon each, pressing the nut into the candy and thus flattening it still more. The caramel gives the chocolate a particularly nice flavor.   HOW TO COAT CANDIES, &c., WITH BAKER'S \"DOT\" CHOCOLATE  Half a pound of \"Dot\" Chocolate will coat quite a number of candy or other \"centers,\" but as depth of chocolate and an even temperature during the whole time one is at work are essential, it is well, when convenient, to melt a larger quantity of chocolate. When cold, the unused chocolate may be cut from the dish and set aside for use at a future time. If the chocolate be at the proper temperature when the centers are dipped in it, it will give a rich, glossy coating free from spots, and the candies will not have a spreading base. After a few centers have been dipped set them in a cool place to harden. The necessary utensils are a wire fork and a very small double boiler. The inner dish of the boiler should be of such size that the melted chocolate will come nearly to the top of it. Break the chocolate in small pieces and surround with warm water, stir occasionally while melting. When the melted chocolate has cooled to about 80° F. it is ready to use. Drop whatever is to be coated into the chocolate, with the fork push it below the chocolate, lift out, draw across the edge of the dish and drop onto a piece of table oil cloth or onto waxed paper. Do not let a drop of water get into the chocolate.   CHOCOLATE DIPPED PEPPERMINTS (Uncooked Fondant)  [Illustration: CHOCOLATE DIPPED PEPPERMINTS.]  Prepare green, white, pink and chocolate colored mints by the first recipe. After they have dried off a little run a spatula under each and turn to dry the other side. Coat with Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.   GINGER, CHERRY, APRICOT and NUT CHOCOLATES  [Illustration: GINGER, CHERRY, APRICOT AND NUT CHOCOLATES.]      White of 1 egg,     2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,     Sifted confectioner's sugar,     Almond or rose extract,     Preserved ginger,     Candied cherries,     Candied apricots,     Halves of almond,     Halves of pecan nuts,     1/2 a pound of Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.  Use the first four ingredients in making uncooked fondant. (Caramel syrup is a great addition to this fondant, especially if nuts are to be used. Use three tablespoonfuls of syrup and one tablespoonful of water with one egg white instead of the two tablespoonfuls of water indicated in the recipe). Work the fondant for some time, then break off little bits and wrap around small pieces of the fruit, then roll in the hollow of the hand into balls or oblongs. For other candies, roll a piece of the fondant into a ball, flatten it with the fingers and use to cover a whole pecan or English walnut meat. Set each shape on a plate as it is finished. They will harden very quickly. Dip these, one by one, in Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate and set on an oil cloth.   CHOCOLATE PEANUT CLUSTERS  [Illustration: CHOCOLATE PEANUT CLUSTERS.]  Shell a quart of freshly-roasted peanuts and remove the skins. Drop the peanuts, one by one, into the center of a dish of \"Dot\" Chocolate made ready for use; lift out onto oil cloth with a dipping fork (a wire fork comes for the purpose, but a silver oyster fork answers nicely) to make groups of three nuts,--two below, side by side, and one above and between the others.   CHOCOLATE COATED ALMONDS  [Illustration: CHOCOLATE COATED ALMONDS.]  Select nuts that are plump at the ends. Use them without blanching. Brush, to remove dust. Melt \"Dot\" Chocolate and when cooled properly drop the nuts, one at a time, into the center of it; push the nuts under with the fork, then drop onto waxed paper or oil cloth. In removing the fork make a design on the top of each nut. These are easily prepared and are particularly good.   PLAIN AND CHOCOLATE DIPPED PARISIAN SWEETS  [Illustration: CHOCOLATE DIPPED PARISIAN SWEETS.]      1/2 a cup of Sultana raisins,     5 figs,     1 cup of dates,     2 ounces citron,     2/3 a cup of nut meats, (almonds, filberts, pecans or walnuts, one         variety or a mixture),     1-1/2 ounces of Baker's Chocolate,     1/3 a cup of confectioner's sugar,     1/4 a teaspoonful of salt,     Chocolate Fondant or     Baker's \"Dot\" Chocolate.  Pour boiling water over the figs and dates, let boil up once, then drain as dry as possible; remove stones from the dates, the stem ends from the figs; chop the fruit and nut meats (almonds should be blanched) in a food chopper; add the salt; and the sugar and work the whole to a smooth paste; add the chocolate, melted, and work"]]]
