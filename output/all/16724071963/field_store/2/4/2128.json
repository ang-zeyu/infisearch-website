BURT COMPANY   THE BOY ALLIES ON THE FIRING LINE      THE BOY ALLIES ON THE  FIRING LINE.     CHAPTER I.  TERRIBLE ODDS.   \"Feels pretty good to be back in harness, doesn't it, Hal?\" asked Chester, as, accompanied by a small body of men, they rode slowly along.  \"Great!\" replied his friend enthusiastically. \"And it looks as if we were to see action soon.\"  \"Yes, it does look that way.\"  The little body of British troopers, only forty-eight of them all told, with Hal Paine and Chester Crawford as their guides, were reconnoitering ten miles in advance of the main army along the river Marne in the great war between Germany and the allied armies. For several hours they had been riding slowly without encountering the enemy, when, suddenly, as the little squad topped a small hill and the two boys gained an unobstructed view of the little plain below, Hal pulled up his horse with an exclamation.  Quickly he threw up his right hand and the little troop came to an abrupt halt.  \"Germans!\" he said laconically.  \"And thousands of 'em,\" said Chester. \"They haven't seen us yet. What is best to be done?\"  The answer to this question came from the enemy. Several flashes of fire broke out along the German front, and the boys involuntarily ducked their heads as bullets sped whizzing past them.  \"Well, they have seen us now,\" said Hal; then turning to the men: \"To the woods,\" pointing with his sword to a dense forest on his right.  Rapidly the little body of men disappeared among the trees.  \"Up in the trees,\" ordered Hal, \"and pick them off as they come!\"  Swiftly the troopers leaped from their horses and climbed up among the branches. Here all could easily command a view of the oncoming German horde.  Rapidly the enemy advanced, firing volley after volley as they approached; then, at a word from Hal, the British poured forth their answer. And such an answer! Before the aim of these few British troopers, accounted among the best marksmen in the world, the Teuton cavalry went down in heaps.  There was a perceptible slackening in the speed of the approaching horsemen. Then, as the English continued their work, firing with machine-like precision and deadly accuracy, the Germans came to a halt.  \"What are they stopping for?\" cried Chester. \"There are enough of them to overwhelm us!\"  \"I believe they fear a trap,\" replied Hal. \"They are afraid we are trying to ambush them with a larger force. We must keep up the delusion if we expect to get away.\"  So saying, he ordered the men to the ground, and the little force advanced to the extreme edge of the woods. So far not a man had been even wounded, for the Germans, unable to see that their foe had climbed into the trees, had aimed too low.  From the edge of the woods the British poured several volleys, and then, as the enemy finally began an advance, they retreated slowly, firing as they flitted from tree to tree.  Apparently, Hal had rightly guessed the cause of the enemy's indecision. They advanced slowly and warily; and when they finally gained the edge of the woods there was not a Briton in sight; but from further in among the trees the leaden messengers of death still struck the Germans, and man after man fell in his tracks.  Now the man nearest Chester threw up his arms and with a cry fell to the ground. The lad made as if to go to his assistance, but Hal stayed him with a word, and the little body of English continued their retreat, firing as they went.  Suddenly the pursued emerged from the woods into the open. A distance of half a mile lay between them and the next clump of trees. In this half a mile there was nothing that would afford shelter; and the Germans were approaching nearer every second.  Hal did not hesitate.  \"We shall have to make a dash for it!\" he cried. \"One more volley, men, and then run!\"  One more death-dealing volley was delivered at close range, and then the little troop of English turned and fled. But they had traversed scarcely half the distance when the Germans reached the edge of the woods, and poured a volley into them.  Hal groaned as men fell on all sides of him. But still those who were left ran on. At length they reached the friendly shelter of the trees, but half their number lay behind, either dead or dying.  Once more, screened from the enemy, Hal halted the men.  \"We may as well fight it out here,\" he told them. \"We will hold them off if we can, and if not we must retreat slowly, keeping behind whatever cover offers.\"  A faint cheer went up from the handful who were left, and they turned determinedly to face their foes. They did not waste their fire. As the Germans came again into view, the British rifles cracked. Their marksmanship was superb, and rather than face this deadly fire the enemy halted.  Then began a game of hide and seek, with death the penalty for all who were seen. The firing was only at intervals now. Wherever a German arm or leg showed itself, a British rifle sounded and a German was accounted for.  For almost half an hour the game continued; and it was kept up until darkness fell. Fearing that it was the intent of the British to lure them into the hands of a strong force, the Germans did not attempt a charge, but contented themselves with trying to pick off their foes as they flitted from one tree to another.  But if the Germans had suffered, so had the English. Of the little troop of fifty, there now remained, besides Hal and Chester, but ten men. The two boys seemed to bear charmed lives, for neither had been struck once. They had exposed themselves to all dangers as well as had the troopers, but fortunately no German bullets had reached them.  And still the few English fought on. Now that darkness had fallen and two more men had dropped, Hal ordered those who were left to make a last dash for life. He sprang from behind the tree which had sheltered him, and Chester and the few remaining troopers joined him. Then they turned and sped as rapidly as the darkness would permit in the direction of their own lines.  Now that the fire of the English had ceased entirely, the Germans halted, puzzled. It was impossible for their officers to tell whether the enemy had all been killed, or whether the silence heralded the approach of a larger force. Their indecision undoubtedly saved the lives of Hal and Chester and the eight troopers, for had the Germans advanced they would have experienced little difficulty in killing or capturing them.  Silently but swiftly the ten forms dashed through the woods, and when at length they once more emerged into the open country they were completely exhausted.  \"Well, I guess we are safe, what is left of us, at any rate,\" said Chester as they halted to take a much needed rest. \"It's terrible to think of those poor fellows we left behind.\"  \"It is, indeed,\" replied Hal; \"but I don't think they would complain. The British soldier is not that kind.\"  \"You are right,\" agreed Chester. \"And each accounted for more than one of his country's foes before he went down. Were you hit, Hal?\"  \"No. Were you?\"  \"No. But come, we had better be pushing on again.\"  With the loss of their comrades still preying upon their minds, the little troop continued on its way; and while they are hurrying onward we shall take time to introduce Hal and Chester more fully to those who have not met them before, and to relate how it came about that they were serving in such an important capacity with the British army in France.     CHAPTER II.  TWO YOUNG LIEUTENANTS.   Sturdy American lads, young though they were, Hal Paine and Chester Crawford had, when this story opens, already seen considerable military service. Each had received his baptism of fire during the heroic defense of the Belgian city of Liège, which had held out for days against the overwhelming horde of Teutons.  In Berlin with Hal's mother when the war broke out, they had been separated from her and left behind. With Captain Raoul Derevaux, a gallant French officer, and Lieutenant Harry Anderson of the British army, they finally succeeded in making their way, after many desperate experiences and daring adventures, over the Belgian frontier, as told in the first book of this series, entitled \"The Boy Allies at Liège.\" They had reached Liège in time to take an active part in the defense of that city.  In escaping from Germany, each had done his full share of fighting and each had been wounded. They had finally reached Brussels, where they remained some time, while Hal's wound healed sufficiently to continue his homeward journey. As the result of their heroic actions, the Belgian commander at Liège had mentioned them so favorably in his report to King Albert, that he had bestowed upon them commissions as lieutenants in the Belgian army as a mark of distinction for their bravery.  It was while waiting in Brussels that they again encountered Lieutenant Anderson, from whom they had been separated, and it was through his inducement that they now found themselves attached to the staff of Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British forces on the continent, engaged in scout duty.  At the time when this story opens they had been sent in advance of the main army on a reconnaissance.  The German advance through Belgium into France, up to this time, had been steady, although the Allies had contested every foot of the ground. Day after day and night after night the hard pressed British troops, to which Hal and Chester were attached, had borne the brunt of the fighting. But for the heroism of these comparatively few English, slightly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12870"],["title","The Boy Allies on the Firing Line; Or, Twelve Days Battle Along the Marne (#1)"],["body","than one hundred thousand men, the Germans probably would have marched to the very gates of Paris.  But the arrival of the British troops had been timely, and under the gallant command of Sir John French, they had checked the overwhelming numbers of Germans time after time. The bravery of these English troops under a galling fire and against fearful odds is one of the greatest military achievements of the world's history.  Slowly, but standing up to the enemy like the true sons of Great Britain always have done, they were forced back. They stood for hours, without sight of the enemy, men dropping on all sides under the fearful fire of the great German guns miles away. While the French, farther south, gave way more rapidly, these few English stood their ground.  Time after time they came to hand grips with the enemy, and at the point of the bayonet drove them back with terrible losses. These bayonet charges were things of wonder to Hal and Chester, in spite of the fact that they had been in the midst of similar actions before Liège.  As the French and Belgians advanced in a wild whirlwind of fury, the English went about the business of a charge more deliberately, though with the same savage determination. They charged swiftly, but more coolly; gallantly, but more seriously, and the effect of their charges was terrible. The Germans who came on in the face of the fierce rifle and artillery fire, could not face the British bayonets, and time after time were driven back in disorder.  And as the British charged, always the words of their battle-song, fated for some unfathomed reason to become historic, rose above the sounds of battle:       \"It's a long way to Tipperary.        It's a long way to go;      It's a long way to Tipperary,        To the sweetest girl I know.      Good-by, Piccadilly,        Farewell, Leicester square.      It's a long, long way to Tipperary,        But my heart's right there!\"  Liège had fallen before the invading German hosts, though several of the forts still held out; Louvain had been captured and its beautiful buildings burned to the ground. Brussels had been invested by the Teutons. In Alsace-Lorraine the French had been forced to relinquish the spoils won in the first days of the war. General Pau, after a stubborn resistance, had fallen back, and General Joffre, commander-in-chief of the French army, also had been forced to retire.  So close to Paris were the Germans now that the seat of government, the day before this story opens, had been removed to Bordeaux. Homes and other buildings in the French capital were being razed, so that the great French guns in the city could sweep the approach to the town unobstructed. Paris, the most strongly fortified city in the world, was being prepared to withstand a siege.  And still the Germans came on. Several of the enemy's war aviators flew over Paris and dropped bombs in the streets. This occurred upon several days, and then the French airmen put an end to these daring sky fighters. After this, no more bombs were dropped on Paris.  But as the Allies fell back, it was always the few British troops that time and again checked the Germans. The morale of the English was excellent.  In a final desperate charge, a small body of British cavalry had succeeded in driving back the German vanguard, while the main body of English retired still further. Then this little body of men returned, their number much smaller than when they had charged.  For some time now there had been no sign of the enemy, and Hal and Chester, with a small squad, had been sent toward the enemy's line to reconnoiter. It was while on this reconnaissance that they had been attacked by the Germans in force.  Slowly the two lads and the eight men, all that was left of the fifty who had gone forth, continued their retreat. They had gone forth on horses; they were returning afoot. Their mounts were in the hands of the enemy. From the rear, in the darkness, still came the sounds of firing.  \"Evidently they have not given up the pursuit,\" said Hal.  \"No; and they are probably mounted. Let's turn off into this little woods,\" replied Chester.  They did so, and followed by the remaining eight troopers continued on their way.  As they came to the edge of the woods, Hal, who was slightly in advance, stopped suddenly, and raised a warning hand. The little party halted.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Chester in a whisper.  \"Germans!\" replied Hal briefly.  Chester approached closer and peered over his friend's shoulder. Less than three hundred yards ahead he could dimly make out moving forms.  \"Perhaps they are not Germans,\" said Chester hopefully. \"How did they manage to get behind us?\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Hal. \"But I am sure they are Germans. Some way, I can feel it.\"  \"Well, what are we going to do?\"  \"We shall have to try and go round them without letting them hear us. Otherwise we are likely to be killed or captured.\"  Making a wide detour, the little party continued on their way. For an hour they walked along unmolested, and then, suddenly, from almost directly before them, came a cry, in German:  \"Halt!\"     CHAPTER III.  WITH THE ARMY AGAIN.   In the dimness of the little woods in which they stood, the boys, at first, could not see the man who had accosted them.  At a word from Hal the little party came to a halt.  \"Who goes there?\" came the question from the darkness.  \"Friends!\" replied Hal in German, which he spoke like a native.  \"Advance!\" came the reply, and the shadow of a German soldier, with his rifle raised, ready to fire, suddenly appeared before them.  It was too dark for the German soldier to make out their uniforms until the English were upon him. Then he started back with a cry.  \"English!\" he exclaimed in surprise.  His amazement, slight though it was, proved his undoing. For as he staggered back Hal sprang forward, and the butt of his upraised rifle fell with stunning force upon the German's head. The soldier dropped to the ground with a slight moan.  \"We'll have to get away from here quick!\" exclaimed Chester. \"Come on, men, follow us!\"  Silently the little party, bearing off slightly to the right, went forward. Suddenly Chester stopped and clutched Hal by the arm.  \"Great Scott!\" he whispered. \"Look! We are right in the middle of them!\"  It was true. Ahead of them, in a long line running in each direction, the boys could see figures sprawled on the ground. It was a German force sleeping. There was not the sign of a light, a tent, or a hut. Here and there the boys could make out the dim form of a sentry flitting about.  \"We have certainly got into a mess,\" whispered Hal.  \"We have that,\" replied Chester. \"Shall we make another detour?\"  Hal thought for a few moments.  \"I believe the best way is to try and go right through them without being seen,\" he replied at length. \"There is no telling how far this line stretches out, and if we didn't get around them by daylight it would be all off with us.\"  \"But the sentries?\" asked Chester.  \"Well, we shall have to dispose of anyone who sees us without being heard. That's all there is about it.\"  \"All right, then,\" said Chester. \"We might as well move at once.\"  The plan was outlined to the men and they went forward. A moment and they were in the midst of the sleeping Germans. It was plain now that the line of sleepers stretched out for some distance, but that it was not very deep. Three minutes undiscovered and they would be through safely.  Silently they crept between the sleeping soldiers. There was a certain amount of safety in the very boldness of the plan, for it was unlikely, should a sentry see them moving about, he would take them for English; and even if he did now, they would be able to make a dash with some hope of success. The German soldiers, tired and completely exhausted, slept heavily, and not one so much as moved in his sleep.  The little party was now at the last line of sleepers, and just as Hal, believing they had accomplished their difficult task, drew a breath of relief, a form suddenly appeared from the darkness before them. It was a German sentry.  Before he could make an outcry Chester and Hal both leaped forward. The former's hands grasped the German by the throat, stifling the sound of his voice, and Hal quickly delivered two hard blows to the man's face. The German fell limply into Chester's arms, and the boy laid him quietly on the ground.  Then they moved forward again. The sounds of the scuffle had aroused no one. But suddenly there was the sound of a fall behind. Turning his head quickly, Hal perceived the cause of this commotion which caused such a racket in the stillness of the night.  One of the English soldiers had tripped over the body of a sleeping German and had fallen across him. He was up in a moment, but so was the German, sleepily hurling imprecations at the disturber of his slumber.  Before the German soldier was able to arouse himself, the Englishman dealt him a heavy blow over the head with his rifle butt. But the noise had brought another to the scene. There was the sharp crack of a rifle, and the English soldier who had caused all the trouble pitched to the ground. To the right Hal and Chester saw another sentry, a smoking rifle in his hands.  At the sound of the shot the whole German camp sprang to life as if by magic; and at the same instant Hal shouted:  \"Run!\"  At full speed the little party, only nine now, dashed forward. The other man lay dead in the German camp. There was a hoarse German cry of command, and a hail of bullets followed the fugitives into the woods. No man fell, though two groaned, and one dropped his rifle. The darkness made accurate shooting by the Germans impossible.  Not pausing to return the fire of the enemy, the fugitives stumbled on through the woods. Another and another volley came from the pursuing Germans, but they were firing at random now, and the fact that Hal and Chester had led the way well to the right augured well for their chance of"]]]
