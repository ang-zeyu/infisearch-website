Hal, now sheltered by trees, perceived the little man's plight.  \"Can't leave him there,\" he called to Edwards. \"Cover me if you can.\"  Edwards nodded and held his revolver ready.  Hal dashed quickly from his shelter, grasped Stubbs by the right arm, jerked him violently to his feet and turned his face toward the woods on the right.  Stubbs seemed too frightened to realize in what direction lay safety, and breaking from Hal's hold, whirled about and dashed across the road, almost directly toward the spot from whence had come the shot a few moments before.  Hal gave a cry of dismay and dashed after him. But even as he would have given chase, there came a second rifle shot from the trees and Hal felt the breeze as a bullet sped by his ear. At the same moment Edwards yelled:  \"Come back!\"  Hal wasted no time in thought. He obeyed Edwards' command and dashed back to shelter with all speed.  \"Whew!\" he muttered. \"That was pretty close.\"  \"Rather,\" agreed Edwards dryly. \"Where did the little man get to?\"  \"Oh, he's over there with our unseen enemy some place. He got away from me.\"  \"I saw him,\" said Edwards grimly. \"He's likely to have a warm time on the other side of the road.\"  Hal grinned in spite of himself, as he replied:  \"He is that. I suppose we should do something to help him, but I am frank to say I don't know just what.\"  \"We'll have to figure some way to get rid of that fellow,\" said Edwards. \"He's dangerous. Apparently there is only one.\"  \"Tell you what,\" said Hal, \"you stick here. I'll sneak through the trees here for a quarter of a mile, cross the road and double back. If I can go quietly enough perhaps I can catch him off his guard.\"  Edwards considered this plan.  \"Might be done,\" he said finally. \"I don't think of anything else. Off with you then.\"  Hal walked still deeper into the woods and then turned to his left. Keeping himself well screened from the road he made his way carefully and silently along. At last, when he felt sure that he could no longer be seen by their unexpected foe, he approached the road again.  The lad poked his head out cautiously and, after a quick glance back to make sure there was no one in sight, crossed the road at a bound, almost expecting as he did so to hear a bullet whiz near.  No bullet came.  Once safe on the other side, the lad turned again to his left and doubled back. He went more cautiously now, making sure of each footstep that he might not warn the unseen foe of his approach.  In the woods there was the silence of death.  Hal, moving slowly forward, now felt that he must have reached the point from which the two shots had been fired and stopped and listened intently. Once he thought he heard the sound of a snapping twig and became perfectly quiet, waiting for the sound to be repeated; but it did not come again.  \"Guess I must have been mistaken,\" the lad told himself, as he moved forward again.  Five minutes later Hal stopped suddenly in his tracks. He had heard a sound close at hand and knew he was not mistaken this time. A twig had snapped perhaps twenty yards to his right and as far ahead.  Hal grasped his automatic more firmly.  \"Hope I get the first shot,\" he muttered.  Suddenly he caught sight of a form as it flitted from one tree to another. Quickly the lad raised his revolver and fired.  There was no outcry, and looking again, the lad saw no one.  \"Missed him,\" he muttered. \"Well, I've betrayed myself! Now I'll have to be more careful.\"  He lay down upon the ground behind the tree where he had taken shelter and waited patiently. Ten minutes later he thought he saw an object move behind a tree a scant fifteen yards away.  Again the lad fired.  This shot was followed by a startled cry as a figure leaped to its feet and started off through the woods at full speed.  Hal sprang to his feet.  \"Halt!\" he cried.  The figure seemed to run faster than before.  Hal paused and leveled his revolver in deliberate aim. His finger tightened on the trigger--then, suddenly he let his arm fall.  \"Stubbs!\" he cried in amazement.  The running figure was indeed the little war correspondent.  \"By Jove!\" muttered Hal. \"Another moment and I would have shot him.\" He raised his voice in a shout: \"Hey, Stubbs!\"  But the little man ran on, unheeding.  \"He'll run right smack into that other fellow if he doesn't watch out,\" Hal told himself. \"Well, I suppose I'll have to stop him.\"  Still holding his revolver in his right hand, he also broke into a run and made after the fleeing Stubbs.  Several times he called, but Stubbs paid no heed. Then Hal grew angry.  \"I'll get you if I have to chase you right back to the door of the _New York Gazette_\" he muttered to himself.  He gained at every stride and was rapidly overtaking the war correspondent, although Stubbs, with head lowered, looking neither to the right nor to the left, his arms working like pistons, ran blindly on.  Suddenly Hal stopped almost in his tracks and his heart leaped into his throat.  From behind a tree directly in Stubbs' path, stepped a short squat figure, with great long arms dangling at its side. A revolver was clasped in the right hand and the weapon was slowly raised until it covered Stubbs.  Hal gave a loud cry of warning, raised his own revolver and fired. But even as his finger tightened on the trigger he knew he had missed. Stubbs was so close to the other figure that the lad had been afraid of hitting him. Consequently the bullet went wild.  But though it missed its mark, Hal's bullet undoubtedly saved Stubbs' life, for it attracted the attention of the enemy for a brief moment; and in that moment, Anthony Stubbs, still unaware of the danger that confronted him, dashed head first into his would-be slayer.  So great was the force of the impact that both were hurled to the ground. With rare presence of mind, Stubbs, recovering his breath before his unexpected opponent realized what had happened, reached out and procured the other's revolver and hurled it aside.  Then he attempted to get to his feet, but at this point the other came back to life and seized him by the legs.  \"Hey! Leggo my legs!\" shouted Stubbs.  The other held him tightly.  \"Let me up!\" cried Stubbs again.  Still the other clung fast, while Stubbs raised a cry for help.  At this juncture Hal reached the combatants. He was about to lend a hand, when he saw that Stubbs' opponent was unarmed, and drew back.  Stubbs did not see him, and apparently believing that he was to get no help, he turned to give battle. He kicked out with his left foot and the foot came free. He followed suit with the right foot and felt it strike something soft. At the same moment there came a cry of pain from Stubbs' opponent and the grasp upon his other leg relaxed.  Quickly the little man leaped to his feet and darted toward the spot where he had thrown the revolver. He snatched it up and leveled it at his adversary.  \"Hands up there!\" he called.  There came a choking cry from the queer figure and the long arms were raised high in the air.  \"Good for you, Stubbs!\" cried Hal at this juncture.  Stubbs gazed about sharply.  \"About time you were getting here,\" he said. \"I had a terrible fight with this fellow.\"     CHAPTER VI.  A STRANGE ENCOUNTER.   Hal laughed aloud.  \"Terrible fight, eh?\" he exclaimed. \"Of course you did. What else could you do? You had to fight. Pretty lucky, Stubbs.\"  \"Lucky!\" echoed Stubbs. \"What do you mean, lucky? If you had been here in time to see me tackle this fellow you would have known what a hard time I had.\"  \"I saw you,\" replied Hal. \"You can put down your gun, now. I'll take care of this fellow.\"  He leveled his own revolver at the queer-looking creature before him and Stubbs placed his newly-acquired revolver in his coat pocket.  Hal motioned to his prisoner to approach. The latter did so with an ugly scowl on his face. He seemed not to have the slightest fear and came up to the lad unflinchingly.  \"Speak English?\" asked Hal.  There was no reply.  \"French?\"  The man nodded.  \"Who are you?\" demanded Hal.  \"Nikol.\"  \"Nikol what?\"  The man did not reply, and Hal surveyed him critically. He was at least thirty-five years of age, could not have been an inch more than four feet in height, and his long, knotted arms, apparently as strong as a gorilla's, reached almost to the ground, where his huge hand clasped and unclasped nervously. Involuntarily Hal shuddered.  \"Must be as strong as an ox,\" the lad muttered. \"Lucky for Stubbs he kicked at the right time and happened to land.\"  \"What's your last name?\" the lad demanded again.  \"Haven't any,\" was the reply.  \"What are you, an Albanian?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What are you doing here?\"  The man did not reply.  Stubbs had been an interesting listener to the conversation and became decidedly impatient when the dwarf refused to answer Hal's questions.  \"Why don't you speak?\" he demanded aggressively, taking a step forward. He felt perfectly safe now that Hal had the man covered.  Instantly there was an unexpected change in the dwarf's manner. He stepped back a pace and bowed his head before the angry Stubbs.  \"I did not know that you wished me to answer,\" he replied civilly. \"I will talk to you, for you are the first man who has ever conquered me; and you are a small man, too--a dwarf.\"  \"What's that?\" exclaimed Stubbs still more angrily, for \"the dwarf\" had touched upon a tender spot. \"Dwarf, am I? What do you mean by talking to me like that?\"  Again he took a step forward and the Albanian drew back.  \"You will please excuse me,\" he said humbly. \"I did not mean to offend. For myself I am proud that I am a dwarf and I was glad that it was one of my own kind who conquered me.\"  Stubbs, greatly flattered, threw out his chest and turned to Hal.  \"You see,\" he exclaimed, \"if you have any doubts as to how I overcame this man, he will tell you himself. Won't you, Nik--Nikol?\"  Nikol bowed.  \"I will, sir,\" he replied.  \"Well, you seem to have done "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12805"],["title","The Boy Allies in the Balkan Campaign; Or, the Struggle to Save a Nation (#5)"],["body","good job,\" Hal replied. \"I don't believe I could have overcome him. In fact, I am sure of it. Now if you will kindly order your newly made slave to answer my questions, perhaps we may learn something.\"  Stubbs gave the order in the tone of a man born to command and the dwarf nodded his understanding.  \"If my boss knew I could give orders like that, I'd have a better job,\" was Stubbs' comment as Hal turned to Nikol.  \"What are your sympathies in this war?\" asked the lad quietly.  \"My sympathies,\" was the reply, \"I have kept locked up here,\" and Nikol tapped his breast with one of his huge fingers. \"But, now that my conqueror requests me to talk, I will tell you. My sympathies are with Montenegro; always have been and always will be.\"  \"Good!\" exclaimed Hal. \"Then perhaps you can tell me something of the Austrian sentiment in these mountains.\"  \"The Austrian sympathy is very strong,\" was the reply. \"Not so much here as further north. Thousands of tribesmen there are only awaiting the arrival of the Austrians to join their ranks. Some have joined already.\"  \"And is there not danger for a man of your sympathies in these parts?\"  The Albanian shrugged his shoulders.  \"I have said,\" he replied, \"that I keep my sympathies locked up here,\" and again he tapped his breast.  Hal was silent for a few moments, considering a plan that had come to him. At length he turned to Stubbs.  \"Will you ask your newly made friend,\" he said, \"if he will join us? He will be invaluable. He can lead us where we would go without question.\"  Stubbs grasped the situation instantly.  He put the question to the Albanian. For long minutes the man hesitated, and then he, in turn, asked a question.  \"You say that you are working in the interests of Montenegro?\" he asked.  \"I can give you my word,\" replied Stubbs soberly.  The dwarf extended a hand to Stubbs and looked him in the eye.  \"Such men as you, such fighters as you, do not lie,\" he said gravely.  Stubbs blushed like a schoolboy as he extended a hand, which was seized in a grip that brought tears to the little man's eyes. But he bore the pain bravely, for he did not wish to lose caste in the eyes of his new admirer.  \"Come then,\" said Hal. \"We'll pick up Colonel Edwards again and be moving.\"  He led the way back to where the first shot had been fired and raised his voice in a shout:  \"All right, Edwards?\"  \"All right,\" was the reply.  \"I've caught the enemy,\" explained Hal. \"You can come from under cover.\"  He led the way to the road and a moment later Colonel Edwards joined them.  \"What have we here?\" he exclaimed, after a glance at the dwarf.  \"A guide,\" replied Hal; \"the same being the man who fired at us, and also Stubbs' own prisoner.\"  \"Stubbs' prisoner?\"  \"Exactly. He captured him single-handed.\"  Colonel Edwards eyed Stubbs in the greatest surprise, until Hal explained in a low voice, so that neither Stubbs nor the dwarf might hear.  \"Well, we may as well be moving then,\" said Colonel Edwards. \"Have your guide take the lead, Stubbs.\"  Stubbs, undeniably proud at the honor now being bestowed upon him, did as requested, and the dwarf led the way down the road at a rapid gait.  Hour after hour they walked along encountering no one, until shortly before nightfall when they drew up near a small hut. Here Nikol went forward and secured food, which he brought back in his hands. This they devoured hungrily, drank from a little brook, and moved forward again.  Now Nikol deserted the beaten path and struck off through the mountains proper, climbing steep hills, leaping ruts and gullies, rocks and brooks, but making such good progress that the others were hard pressed to keep up with him.  Darkness fell suddenly and Stubbs shuddered.  \"Nice place for an assassin here, too,\" he muttered gloomily.  \"Back at it, are you?\" said Hal. \"What will your friend Nikol say?\"  Stubbs did not reply.  Suddenly the dwarf halted and motioned the others to silence. All listened intently and directly made out what the sharp ears of Nikol had caught first--the sound of approaching footsteps.  Nikol motioned the others back into the shadow of a great rock and stepped boldly forward. Then he hesitated a moment, came back and spoke to Stubbs in a low voice, yet loud enough for the others to hear.  \"If I should chance to be outmatched,\" he said, \"you will come to my assistance? The others,\" he snapped his fingers, \"are no good. You will come?\"  Taken wholly off his guard, Stubbs stuttered and stammered.  \"You will come?\" Nikol repeated again.  \"Ye-e-s, I'll come,\" Stubbs articulated at last.  Nikol wasted no further time in words, but moved forward perhaps a hundred yards. Then he halted and stood still, waiting.  The sound of footsteps drew nearer and still nearer, and then suddenly Nikol sprang forward, silently and swiftly.  There came a sudden startled cry from ahead and then a great, boisterous laugh.  \"Ho! Ho!\" exclaimed a voice in French. \"Look what has attacked Ivan Vergoff.\"  For some reason that he could not explain, Hal left his place of concealment and moved toward the combatants. The others followed him.  \"Ho! Ho!\" came the great voice again. \"Ivan Vergoff, the greatest of the Cossacks, attacked by this puny pygmy.\"  Hal had now approached close enough to see the gigantic figure of Nikol's antagonist and to witness the struggle.  The giant had stooped over and seized Nikol by one arm. He pulled, but the dwarf, his feet firmly planted on the ground, did not budge. It was a great exhibition of strength, for Hal knew that the stranger must be a powerful man.  This time the giant did not laugh.  \"A strong man,\" he muttered aloud. \"A strong man, though he be a pygmy.\"  He now extended another arm, seized the dwarf around the middle and lifted him high above his head. With his right arm the dwarf struck the face that gazed up at him as he was suspended high in the air.  The big man gave a roar like that of an angry bull, hurled the dwarf from him and then jumped after the flying figure with remarkable agility for a man of his huge size.  But even as he would have seized Nikol again, Hal stepped forward.  \"Wait!\" cried the lad, who had been doing some quick thinking. \"Your name is Ivan Vergoff and you are a Cossack?\"  The big man paused suddenly and glanced about him.  \"Yes!\" he shouted. \"What of it?\"  \"Only,\" replied Hal quietly, \"that I bring you word of your brother, Alexis!\"     CHAPTER VII.  NEW FRIENDS.   The big man paused and turned an enquiring eye upon Hal, whom he could dimly perceive in the darkness.  \"Alexis!\" he echoed. \"What of him? How do you know I have a brother Alexis?\"  Hal replied rapidly in the Russian dialect which he had picked up during his service with the Cossacks, as told in the story of \"The Boy Allies With the Cossacks,\" while the man listened intently. Then the giant set the dwarf upon his feet remarking:  \"Now, you just stay there a little while. I may have more to say to you later, but right now I would know something of my brother Alexis, whom I have not seen in years. And my brother Stephan, also, what do you know of him?\" he demanded of Hal.  The lad shook his head.  \"Not much,\" he said. \"But come, we'll find some spot where we can make a fire and I'll tell you what I know of Alexis.\"  \"Good,\" boomed the big man. \"Follow me.\"  Without another word he turned on his heel and strode away whence he had come. The other four followed him, Nikol the while muttering angrily to himself.  Stubbs turned upon him suddenly.  \"What's the matter with you?\" he demanded. \"Don't you know it's cold here? I want to sit by the fire awhile. Keep still.\"  The dwarf made no reply, but became silent. It was plain enough that he stood very much in awe of Stubbs.  After a five-minute walk through the dark woods, the big Cossack wheeled sharply to the left, and walking swiftly for perhaps fifty yards drew up before what appeared to be a solid rock.  Looking closer in the darkness, however, Hal saw a slight opening at the bottom, the space between the rock and the ground being perhaps three feet. The rock, apparently, rested upon more solid ground farther back.  \"Follow me,\" said the big man again.  He dropped on his hands and knees and wriggled through the opening.  At this point Stubbs manifested a desire to leave the others in the lurch.  \"Say!\" he exclaimed. \"You're not going to get me under there. How do you know what he may have in mind to do to us?\"  \"Come, Stubbs,\" said Hal. \"Don't be a quitter all the time. Nothing is going to hurt--\"  Before he could finish his sentence he felt himself seized in a powerful grip from behind. He twisted about with an effort and looked down upon the scowling face of Nikol.  \"Here! What's the matter?\" he cried.  The dwarf grinned at him evilly, and still retaining his hold, gazed at Stubbs.  \"He insulted you,\" he said. \"What shall I do with him?\"  \"Great Scott! Let him down!\" exclaimed the little man, anxiously. \"He didn't do anything to me.\"  \"But he insulted you,\" protested Nikol. \"I heard him say--\"  \"Oh, that was just in fun,\" cried Stubbs. \"Let him go.\"  The dwarf's hold relaxed and Hal jumped away.  \"Don't try any of that on me again,\" he said, facing Nikol angrily. He turned to Stubbs. \"You just instruct this fellow to keep his hands off me, or I shall have to take my gun to him.\"  \"Oh, he didn't mean any harm,\" Stubbs protested.  \"Maybe he didn't and maybe he did,\" replied Hal. \"At any rate, I don't like that kind of treatment. You tell him what I said.\"  \"He was just sticking up for me,\" said Stubbs, aggrievedly. \"But I'll tell him.\"  He did so, but the dwarf said nothing.  At this juncture the big Cossack poked his head from beneath the rock.  \"Are you coming in here or not?\" he demanded in a gruff voice.  \"Coming,\" said Hal, dropping to his knees.  \"Look here, Hal,\" said Stubbs, \"I don't like the looks of this place. Maybe we had better stay outside.\"  \"Nonsense,\" Edwards spoke up at this point. \"The man means us no harm.\"  Hal had disappeared"]]]
