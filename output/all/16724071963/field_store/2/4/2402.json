Like lions gaping to devour, When God had left him in their power.  5 They wound his head, his hands, his feet, Till streams of blood each other meet; By lot his garments they divide And mock the pangs in which he dy'd.  6 But God, his Father, heard his cry: Rais'd from the dead he reigns on high. The nations learn his righteousness, And humble sinners taste his grace.   Psalm 23:1. L. M. God our Shepherd.  1 My shepherd is the living Lord; Now shall my wants be well supply'd His providence and holy word Become my safety and my guide.  2 In pastures where salvation grows He makes me feed, he makes me rest; There living water gently flows, And all the food's divinely blest.  3 My wandering feet his ways mistake, But he restores my soul to peace, And leads me for his mercy's sake, In the fair paths of righteousness.  4 Tho' I walk thro' the gloomy vale, Where death and all its terrors are, My heart and hope shall never fail, For God my shepherd's with me there.  5 Amidst the darkness and the deeps Thou art my comfort, thou my stay; Thy staff supports my feeble steps, Thy rod directs my doubtful way.  6 The sons of earth and sons of hell Gaze at thy goodness and repine To see my table spread so well With living bread and cheerful wine.  7 [How I rejoice when on my head Thy Spirit condescends to rest! 'Tis a divine anointing shed Like oil of gladness at a feast.  8 Surely the mercies of the Lord Attend his household all their days; There will I dwell to hear his word, To seek his face, and sing his praise.]   Psalm 23:2. C. M. The same.  1. My Shepherd will supply my need, Jehovah is his name; In pastures fresh he makes me feed Beside the living stream.  2 He brings my wandering spirit back, When I forsake his ways; And leads me for his mercy's sake, In paths of truth and grace.  3 When I walk thro' the shades of death, Thy presence is my stay; A word of thy supporting breath Drives all my fears away.  4 Thy hand, in spite of all my foes, Doth still my table spread; My cup with blessings overflows, Thine oil anoints my head.  5 The sure provisions of my God Attend me all my days; O may thy house be mine abode, And all my work be praise!  6 There would I find a settled rest, (While others go and come) No more a stranger or a guest, But like a child at home.   Psalm 23:3. S. M. The same.  1 The Lord my shepherd is, I shall be well supply'd; Since he is mine, and I am his, What can I want beside?  2 He leads me to the place Where heavenly pasture grows, Where living waters gently pass, And full salvation flows.  3 If e'er I go astray, He doth my soul reclaim, And guides me in his own right way, For his most holy name.  4 While he affords his aid, I cannot yield to fear; Tho' I should walk thro' death's dark shade My Shepherd's with me there.  5 In spite of all my foes, Thou dost my table spread, My cup with blessings overflows, And joy exalts my head.  6 The bounties of thy love Shall crown my following days; Nor from thy house will I remove, Nor cease to speak thy praise.   Psalm 24:1. C. M. Dwelling with God.  1 The earth for ever is the Lord's, With Adam's numerous race; He rais'd its arches o'er the floods, And built it on the seas.  2 But who among the sons of men May visit thine abode? He that has hands from mischief clean, Whose heart is right with God.  3 This is the man may rise, and take The blessings of his grace; This is the lot of those that seek The God of Jacob's face.  4 Now let our soul's immortal powers To meet the Lord prepare, Lift up their everlasting doors, The King of glory's near.  5 The King of glory! who can tell The wonders of his might! He rules the nations; but to dwell With saints is his delight.   Psalm 24:2. L. M. Saints dwell in heaven; or, Christ's ascension.  1 This spacious earth is all the Lord's, And men, and worms, and beasts, and birds: He rais'd the building on the seas, And gave it for their dwelling-place.  2 But there's a brighter world on high, Thy palace, Lord, above the sky: Who shall ascend that blest abode, And dwell so near his Maker God?  3 He that abhors and fears to sin, Whose heart is pure whose hands are clean, Him shall the Lord the Saviour bless, And clothe his soul with righteousness.  4 These are the men, the pious race That seek the God of Jacob's face; These shall enjoy the blissful sight, And dwell in everlasting light.  PAUSE.  5 Rejoice, ye shining worlds on high, Behold the King of glory nigh! Who can this King of glory be? The mighty Lord, the Saviour's he.  6 Ye heavenly gates, your leaves display To make the Lord the Saviour way: Laden with spoils from earth and hell, The conqueror comes with God to dwell.  7 Rais'd from the dead he goes before, He opens heaven's eternal door, To give his saints a blest abode Near their Redeemer, and their God.   Psalm 25:1. 1-11. First Part. Waiting for pardon and direction.  1 I Lift my soul to God, My trust is in his name; Let not my foes that seek my blood Still triumph in my shame.  2 Sin and the powers of hell Persuade me to despair; Lord, make me know thy covenant well, That I may 'scape the snare.  3 From the first dawning light Till the dark evening rise, For thy salvation, Lord, I wait With ever-longing eyes.  4 Remember all thy grace, And lead me in thy truth; Forgive the sins of riper days, And follies of my youth.  5 The Lord is just and kind, The meek shall learn his ways; And every humble sinner find The methods of his grace.  6 For his own goodness' sake He saves my soul from shame; He pardons (tho' my guilt be great) Thro' my Redeemer's name.   Psalm 25:2. 12 14 10 13. Second Part. Divine instruction.  1 Where shall the man be found That fears t' offend his God, That loves the gospel's joyful sound, And trembles at the rod?  2 The Lord shall make him know The secrets of his heart, The wonders of his covenant show, And all his love impart.  3 The dealings of his hand Are truth and mercy still With such as to his covenant stand, And love to do his will.  4 Their souls shall dwell at ease Before their Maker's face, Their seed shall taste the promises, In their extensive grace.   Psalm 25:3. 15-22. Third Part. Distress of soul; or, Backsliding and desertion.  1 Mine eyes and my desire Are ever to the Lord; I love to plead his promises, And rest upon his word.  2 Turn, turn thee to my soul, Bring thy salvation near: When will thy hand release my feet Out of the deadly snare?  3 When shall the sovereign grace Of my forgiving God Restore me from those dangerous ways My wandering feet have trod?  4 The tumult of my thoughts Doth but enlarge my woe; My spirit languishes, my heart Is desolate and low.  5 With every morning light My sorrow new begins; Look on my anguish and my pain, And pardon all my sins.  PAUSE.  6 Behold the hosts of hell How cruel is their hate! Against my life they rise, and join Their fury with deceit.  7 O keep my soul from death, Nor put my hope to shame, For I have plac'd my only trust In my Redeemer's name.  8 With humble faith I wait To see thy face again; Of Israel it shall ne'er be said, \"He sought the Lord in vain.\"   Psalm 26. Self-examination; or, Evidences of grace.  1 Judge me, O Lord, and prove my ways, And try my reins, and try my heart; My faith upon thy promise stays, Nor from thy law my feet depart.  2 I hate to walk, I hate to sit, With men of vanity and lies; The scoffer and the hypocrite Are the abhorrence of mine eyes.  3 Amongst thy saints will I appear, With hands well wash'd in innocence; But when I stand before thy bar, The blood of Christ is my defence.  4 I love thy habitation, Lord, The temple where thine honours dwell; There shall I hear thine holy word, And there thy works of wonder tell.  5 Let not my soul be join'd at last With men of treachery and blood, Since I my days on earth have past Among the saints, and near my God.   Psalm 27:1. 1-6. First Part. The church is our delight and safety.  1 The Lord of glory is my light, And my salvation too; God is my strength, nor will I fear What all my foes can do.  2 One privilege my heart desires; O grant me an abode Among the churches of thy saints, The temples of my God!  3 There shall I offer my requests, And see thy beauty still, Shall hear thy messages of love, And there enquire thy will.  4 When troubles rise, and storms appear, There may his children hide: God has a strong pavilion where He makes my soul abide.  5 Now shall my head be lifted high Above my foes around, And songs of joy and victory Within thy temple sound.   Psalm 27:2. 8 9 13 14. Second Part.  Prayer and Hope.  1 Soon as I heard my Father say, \"Ye children, seek my grace;\" My heart reply'd without delay, \"I'll seek my Father's face.\"  2 Let not thy face be hid from me, Nor frown my soul away; God of my life, I fly to thee In a distressing day.  3 Should friends and kindred near and dear Leave me to want, or die, My God would make my life his care And all my need supply.  4 My fainting flesh had dy'd with grief, Had not my soul believ'd To see thy grace provide relief, Nor was my hope deceiv'd.  5 Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints, And keep your courage up; He'll raise your spirit when it faints, And far exceed your hope.   Psalm 29. L. M. Storm and thunder.  1 Give to the Lord, ye sons of fame, Give to the Lord renown and power, Ascribe due honours to his name, And his eternal might adore.  2 The Lord proclaims his power aloud Over the ocean and the land; His voice divides the watery cloud, And lightnings blaze at his command.  3 He speaks, and tempest, hail, and wind, Lay the wide forests bare around; The fearful hart, and frighted hind, Leap at the terror of the sound.  4 To Lebanon he turns his voice, And, lo, the stately cedars break; The mountains tremble at the noise, The vallies roar, the deserts quake.  5 The Lord sits sovereign on the flood, The thunderer reigns for ever king; But makes his church his blest abode, Where we his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13166"],["title","The Psalms of David (#8)"],["body","glories sing.  6 In gentler language there the Lord The counsels of his grace imparts; Amidst the raging storm his word Speaks peace and courage to our hearts.   Psalm 30:1. First Part. Sickness healed, and sorrow removed.  1 I will extol thee, Lord, on high, At thy command, diseases fly; Who but a God can speak and save From the dark borders of the grave?  2 Sing to the Lord, ye saints of his, And tell how large his goodness is; Let all your powers rejoice and bless, While you record his holiness.  3 His anger but a moment stays His love is life and length of days; Tho' grief and tears the night employ, The morning-star restores the joy.   Psalm 30:2. 6. Second Part. Health, sickness, and recovery.  1 Firm was my health, my day was bright, And I presum'd 'twould ne'er be night; Fondly I said within my heart, \"Pleasure and peace shall ne'er depart.\"  2 But I forgot thine arm was strong, Which made my mountain stand so long; Soon as thy face began to hide, My health was gone, my comforts dy'd.  3 I cry'd aloud to thee, my God, \"What canst thou profit by my blood? \"Deep in the dust can I declare \"Thy truth, or sing thy goodness there?  4 \"Hear me, O God of grace,\" I said, \"And bring me from among the dead:\" Thy word rebuk'd the pains I felt, Thy pardoning love remov'd my guilt.  5 My groans, and tears, and forms of woe, Are turn'd to joy and praises now; I throw my sackcloth on the ground, And ease and gladness gird me round.  6 My tongue, the glory of my frame, Shall ne'er be silent of thy name Thy praise shall sound thro' earth and heaven, For sickness heal'd, and sins forgiven.   Psalm 31:1. 5 13-19 22 23. First Part. Deliverance from death.  1 Into thine hand, 0 God of truth, My spirit I commit; Thou hast redeem'd my soul from death, And sav'd me from the pit.  2 The passions of my hope and fear Maintain'd a doubtful strife, While sorrow, pain, and sin conspir'd To take away my life.  3 \"My times are in thine hand,\" I cry'd, \"Tho' I draw near the dust ;\" Thou art the refuge where I hide, The God in whom I trust.  4 O make thy reconciled face Upon thy servant shine, And save me for thy mercy's sake, For I'm entirely thine.  PAUSE.  5 ['Twas in my haste, my spirit said, \"I must despair and die, \"I am cut off before thine eyes;\" But thou hast heard me cry.]  6 Thy goodness how divinely free! How wondrous is thy grace To those that fear thy majesty, And trust thy promises!  7 O love the Lord, all ye his saints, And sing his praises loud; He'll bend his ear to your complaints, And recompense the proud.   Psalm 31:2. 7-13 18-21. Second Part. Deliverance from slander and reproach.  1 My heart rejoices in thy name, My God, my help, my trust; Thou hast preserv'd my face from shame, Mine honour from the dust.  2 \"My life is spent with grief,\" I cry'd, \"My years consum'd in groans, \"My strength decays, mine eyes are dry'd, \"And sorrow wastes my bones.\"  3 Among mine enemies my name Was a mere proverb grown, While to my neighbours I became Forgotten and unknown.  4 Slander and fear on every side, Seiz'd and beset me round; I to the throne of grace apply'd, And speedy rescue found.  PAUSE.  5 How great deliverance thou hast wrought Before the sons of men! The lying lips to silence brought, And made their boastings vain!  6 Thy children, from the strife of tongues, Shall thy pavilion hide, Guard them from infamy and wrongs, And crush the sons of pride.  7 Within thy secret presence, Lord, Let me for ever dwell; No fenced city, wall'd and barr'd, Secures a saint so well.   Psalm 32:1. S. M. Forgiveness of sins upon confession.  1 O blessed souls are they Whose sins are cover'd o'er! Divinely blest, to whom the Lord imputes their guilt no more.  2 They mourn their follies past, And keep their hearts with care; Their lips and lives without deceit, Shall prove their faith sincere.  3 While I conceal'd my guilt I felt the festering wound, Till I confess'd my sins to thee, And ready pardon found.  4 Let sinners learn to pray, Let saints keep near the throne; Our help in times of deep distress, Is found in God alone.   Psalm 32:2. First Part. L. M. Free pardon and sincere obedience; or, Confession and forgiveness.  1 Happy the man to whom his God No more imputes his sin, But wash'd in the Redeemer's blood, Hath made his garments clean!  2 Happy, beyond expression, he Whose debts are thus discharg'd; And from the guilty bondage free, He feels his soul enlarg'd.  3 His spirit hates deceit and lies, His words are all sincere; He guards his heart, he guards his eyes, To keep his conscience clear.  4 While I my inward guilt supprest, No quiet could I find; Thy wrath lay burning in my breast, And rack'd my tortur'd mind.  5 Then I confess'd my troubled thoughts, My secret sins reveal'd; Thy pardoning grace forgave my faults, Thy grace my pardon seal'd.  6 This shall invite thy saints to pray, When, like a raging flood, Temptations rise, our strength and stay Is a forgiving God.   Psalm 32:3. L. M. Repentance and free pardon; or, Justification and sanctification.  1 Blest is the man, for ever blest, Whose guilt is pardon'd by his God, Whose sins with sorrow are confess'd, And cover'd with his Saviour's blood.  2 Blest is the man to whom the Lord Imputes not his iniquities, He pleads no merit of reward, And not on works, but grace relies.  3 From guile his heart and lips are free, His humble joy, his holy fear, With deep repentance well agree, And join to prove his faith sincere.  4 How glorious is that righteousness That hides and cancels all his sins! While a bright evidence of grace Thro' his whole life appears and shines.   Psalm 32:4. Second Part. L. M. A guilty conscience eased by confession and pardon.  1 While I keep silence, and conceal My heavy guilt within my heart, What torments doth my conscience feel! What agonies of inward smart!  2 I spread my sins before the Lord, And all my secret faults confess; Thy gospel speaks a pard'ning word Thine Holy Spirit seals the grace.  3 For this shall every humble soul Make swift addresses to thy seat; When floods of huge temptations roll, There shall they find a blest retreat.  4 How safe beneath thy wings I lie, When days grow dark, and storms appear! And when I walk, thy watchful eye Shall guide me safe from every snare.   Psalm 33:1. First Part. C. M. Works of creation and providence.  1 Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord, This work belongs to you: Sing of his name, his ways, his word, How holy, just, and true!  2 His mercy and his righteousness Let heaven and earth proclaim; His works of nature and of grace Reveal his wondrous name.  3 His wisdom and almighty word The heavenly arches spread; And by the Spirit of the Lord Their shining hosts were made.  4 He bid the liquid waters flow To their appointed deep; The flowing seas their limits know, And their own station keep.  5 Ye tenants of the spacious earth, With fear before him stand; He spake, and nature took its birth, And rests on his command.  6 He scorns the angry nations' rage, And breaks their vain designs; His counsel stands thro' every age, And in full glory shines.   Psalm 33:2. Second Part. C. M. Creatures vain, and God all-sufficient.  1 Blest is the nation where the Lord Hath fix'd his gracious throne; Where he reveals his heavenly word, And calls their tribes his own.  2 His eye, with infinite survey, Does the whole world behold; He form'd us all of equal clay, And knows our feeble mould.  3 Kings are not rescu'd by the force Of armies from the grave; Nor speed nor courage of an horse Can the bold rider save,  4 Vain is the strength of beasts or men To hope for safety thence; But holy souls from God obtain A strong and sure defence.  5 God is their fear, and God their trust, When plagues or famine spread, His watchful eye secures the just Amongst ten thousand dead.  6 Lord, let our hearts in thee rejoice, And bless us from thy throne; For we have made thy word our choice, And trust thy grace alone.   Psalm 33:3. First Part. As the 113th Psalm. Works of creation and providence.  1 Ye holy souls, in God rejoice, Your Maker's praise becomes your voice; Great is your theme, your songs be new: Sing of his name, his word, his ways, His works of nature and of grace, How wise and holy, just and true.  2 Justice and truth he ever loves, And the whole earth his goodness proves, His word the heavenly arches spread; How wide they shine from north to south! And by the Spirit of his mouth Were all the starry armies made.  3 He gathers the wide-flowing seas, Those watery treasures know their place, In the vast storehouse of the deep: He spake, and gave all nature birth; And fires, and seas, and heaven, and earth, His everlasting orders keep.  4 Let mortals tremble and adore A God of such resistless power, Nor dare indulge their feeble rage: Vain are your thoughts, and weak your hands; But his eternal counsel stands, And rules the world from age to age.   Psalm 33:4. Second Part. As the 113th Psalm. Creatures vain, and God all-sufficient.  1 O Happy nation, where the Lord Reveals the treasure of his word, And builds his church his earthly throne! His eye the heathen world surveys, He form'd their hearts, he knows their ways; But God their Maker is unknown.  2 Let kings rely upon their host, And of his strength the champion boast; In vain they boast, in vain rely; In vain we trust the brutal force, Or speed, or courage of an horse, To guard his rider, or to fly.  3 The eye of thy compassion, Lord, Doth more secure defence afford When death or dangers threatening stand; Thy watchful eye preserves the just, Who make thy name their fear and trust, When wars or famine waste the land.  4 In sickness or the bloody field, Thou our physician, thou our shield, Send us salvation from thy throne; We wait to see thy goodness shine; Let us rejoice in help divine, For all our hope is God alone.   Psalm 34:1. First Part. L. M. God's care of the saints; or, Deliverance by prayer.  1 Lord, I will bless thee all my days, Thy praise shall dwell"]]]
