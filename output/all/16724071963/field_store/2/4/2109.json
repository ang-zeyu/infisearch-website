Then, catching sight of their rods, he added, \"If you came to get fish, you struck a mighty poor place.\"  \"It used to be the best place for trout I ever saw,\" replied Lew. \"This brook used to be full of 'em--big ones, too. But the season has been so dry, the brook has almost disappeared.\"  \"You mean that the fires that have swept this valley have burned it up,\" replied the stranger.  \"It's too awful a thing to joke about,\" replied Lew.  \"A joke!\" exclaimed the stranger, frowning.  \"It's the literal truth--and a most terrible truth, at that.\"  \"I don't understand,\" said Lew, slowly. \"How can fire burn water? I supposed the lack of snow last winter and of rain this spring had made the brook shrink.\"  \"Not for a minute, young man, not for a minute. If fires hadn't swept this valley the past two or three years, there would have been plenty of water in the run, rain or no rain.\"  \"I--I don't exactly understand,\" said Lew hesitatingly.  \"It's like this,\" said the stranger. \"The forest floor is like a great sponge. The decayed leaves and twigs are so light and porous that they soak up most of the rain as it falls and hold the water indefinitely. That keeps the springs full, and the springs feed the brooks, and so there is water all the year round. It is nature's method of storing up water. When a fire sweeps through the forest, especially such awful fires as have gone through this valley, the leaves and twigs above ground are burned, and even the roots and the decaying vegetable matter under the earth are consumed. Nothing is left but mineral matter--particles of rock, stones, sand, and the like. The rain will no longer sink into the ground, nor will the earth hold the water as the rotting leaves do. Then when it rains, the water runs off as fast as it falls. The brooks are flooded for a few hours and then they dry up until another rain comes. So you see I meant exactly what I said. This trout-stream was burned up by the forest fires. Likewise many of the trout were burned up with it, for in places the fire made the water hotter than trout can stand. Thousands of them were literally cooked.\"  For a while both boys were silent. The idea was a new one to them.  Presently Charley spoke. \"I knew that fire burned up our timber,\" he said, \"but I never thought about its burning up our water, too. I know we're getting awful short of lumber. Is there any danger of our running out of water? But that can't be, surely.\"  \"It surely can be,\" said the stranger. \"I judge you boys have been here before, and-----\"  \"We have,\" interrupted Lew.  \"Then you know what a magnificent stream this run used to be. Look at it now. I don't believe there is one-tenth as much water in it as there used to be. Suppose all the mountains in this state should be devastated like this valley. Where would the towns and cities get their water?\"  \"Great Cæsar!\" said Lew. \"I never thought of that. There wouldn't be any water for them to get. If the brooks dried up, the rivers would dry up, too. Why--why--what in the world would we do? There wouldn't be any water to drink or wash in or cook with or run our factories. Why, great Cæsar! If the forests vanished, I guess we'd be up against it. I never thought of the forests as furnishing anything but lumber. And I never thought much about that until we tried to buy a little lumber the other day and the dealer wanted ten dollars for half a dozen boards.\"  \"Exactly!\" said the stranger. \"That's the price you and I and the rest of us in Pennsylvania pay for allowing our forests to be destroyed.\"  \"They haven't all been destroyed,\" protested Lew.  \"No, but the greater part of them have been.\"  \"You don't mean really destroyed, do you?\" asked Lew.  \"Yes, sir. Absolutely destroyed. You came up this valley, didn't you?\"  \"Sure,\" said Charley.  \"Would you call the forest there destroyed?\"  \"If it isn't, I don't know how you would describe it,\" said Lew.  \"All right, then. There are some 45,000 square miles in this state. Originally practically all of that area was dense forests. The early settlers thought the timber would last forever and they cut and destroyed it recklessly. The lumbermen that followed were just as wasteful. It was all right to clear the land that was good for farming. But there are more than 20,000 square miles in this state just like these mountains--land that is fit for nothing but the production of timber. None of that land is producing as much timber as it should. Much of it yields very little. And more than 6,400 square miles are absolutely desert, as bare and hideous as the burned valley below us. That's one acre in every seven in Pennsylvania. Think of it! Six thousand, four hundred square miles, an area larger than the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island put together, that is absolute desert! Every foot of that land ought to be producing timber for us. Then we should have lumber at a fraction of its present cost. You see the freight charges alone on the lumber used in this state are enormous.\"  \"That lumber dealer told us they amounted to $25,000,000 a year,\" replied Lew.  \"They do,\" assented the stranger. \"And when the new freight rates go into effect the amount will be $40,000,000. What it will be when we get our wood from the Pacific coast I have no idea, but I suppose it will be at least double what it is now, anyway.\"  \"The Pacific coast!\" cried Lew. \"Why should we get lumber from the Pacific coast when we can get it from the South? The lumber dealer told us that practically all the wood we use now conies from the South.\"  \"He was right. But we shall presently be getting our lumber from the far West for the same reason that we now get it from the South. In ten or a dozen years there won't be any lumber left in the South for us to buy. They will do well to supply themselves. Then we must bring our lumber from Idaho and Oregon and Washington and California. The freight charges will be something terrific, and the wood itself will cost a good deal more than it now does because it will be so scarce.\"  \"Great Cæsar!\" cried Lew. \"What will a poor devil do then if he wants to build a boat?\"  \"Or if he wants to build a house?\" suggested the stranger. \"You know lots of folks have to build houses every year. Look at all the people who get married and build homes. Why, when I was a little boy, you could buy the finest kind of lumber for ten or fifteen dollars a thousand. It didn't cost much then to build a house. Now a man has to work for years before he can save enough to pay for a home, even a very modest one. And what it will cost when the wood from the South and the far West is all gone I hate to imagine.\"  \"The wood from the far West all gone!\" cried Charley. \"Surely that can never be. Why, the forests there are enormous. I've read all about them.\"  \"The forests here were enormous, too, young man. Forty years ago Pennsylvania supplied a large part of the nation with its lumber. And to-day we don't grow more than one-tenth of the wood we use. Yes, sir; within twenty-five years or so after we have finished up the wood in the South, there won't be any left in the far West, either.\"  \"What in the world are we going to do?\" asked Lew.  \"God knows,\" said the stranger solemnly. \"But there is one thing we've <i>got</i> to do right now. Get these mountains to growing timber again. We must take care of what has already started to grow and plant trees where there are none. Most important of all, we must be careful with fire. I came down here just to warn you boys to be careful with your fire.\"  \"It wasn't necessary,\" said Lew. \"We fought a forest fire once, and nobody but an idiot would ever be careless with fire if he had seen what we have seen this morning.\"  \"Well, I must be moving, boys. There are lots of other fishermen that are not as careful as you are. Good-bye.\"  The man started on, then turned back. \"If you came here to fish,\" he said slowly, \"you're up against it. But I can tell you where to go to get all the trout you want. Go on up to the top of this knob. Face exactly east and you will see a gap in the second range of mountains. Make your way through that gap and you'll find as fine a trout-stream as God ever made. This is state forest and the Forestry Department wants everybody to use and enjoy the forests. We are always glad to help campers.\"  \"Are you connected with the State Forest Service?\" asked Charley, all interest.  \"Of course,\" smiled the stranger. \"I'm a forest-ranger,\" and he threw back his coat, exhibiting a keystone shaped badge on his breast.  \"And it's your duty to protect the forest from fire?\" asked Charley.  \"Yes; and do a lot more besides. A forest-ranger has to look after the forest just as a gardener has to tend a garden. And that means we must care for everything in the forest--birds and animals and fish as well as trees, though, of course, the game wardens have particular charge of the animals.\"  \"And how do you take care of the animals and the trees?\" demanded Charley eagerly.  \"Young man,\" he said, \"it would take me all day to answer your question. We do whatever is necessary to the welfare of the forest and its inhabitants. We take out wolf trees, make improvement cuttings, plant little trees, keep our telephone-line in shape, and do a million other things, as we find them necessary. If I had time just now, I'd go down this run and pile some stones in the pools for the trout to hide under. I was through here the other day and I noticed that the coons are playing hob with the fish.\"  \"And does the state pay you for doing this work?\"  \"Certainly. Pays me well, too.\"  \"Tell me how I could-----\" began Charley.  But the ranger interrupted him. \"I can't tell you another thing now,\" he said. \"I must be moving. You never can tell when some careless fisherman will set the forest on fire. The fact is I ought to be at headquarters with the other rangers. The chief keeps us pretty close to the office during the fire season, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12839"],["title","The Young Wireless Operator—As a Fire Patrol (#7)"],["body","as to have a fire crew at hand to respond instantly to an alarm. But we have had such difficulty in securing fire patrols this spring that some of us rangers have to do patrol duty. This piece of timber you are in is the most valuable part of this entire forest. It is virgin pine. It would cut close to 100,000 feet to the acre. There is very little timber left in all Pennsylvania as fine as this. A good part of it has already been burned. We are keeping close watch on what is left. You never can tell when or where fires will start and we want to grab them at the first possible minute. So I must shake a leg.\"  \"How do you grab a fire?\" demanded Charley. \"Please tell us. Maybe we could help put one out some day if we knew how.\"  The ranger laughed. \"You're a persistent Indian,\" he said, \"and I'm glad you like the forest.\"  \"Like it!\" exclaimed Charley. \"I love it.\"  He poured a cup of hot coffee and handed it to the ranger. \"Tell us how you put out a fire,\" he pleaded.  The ranger chuckled. \"You're a diplomat as well as a forest lover, I see,\" he said. \"Well, I shall keep moving through this tract of timber all day long. If I see a fire I shall hurry to it, the way I came down to your big smoke. I'll put it out, if possible. And if I can't get it out, I'll summon help. Then we'll fight it until we do get it out.\"  \"How could you get help, when you're alone in the deep forest?\"  \"I'd make my way out to the highway where our wire runs and connect up this portable telephone,\" and the ranger pointed to a little leather case, like a kodak box, that hung from his shoulder by a leather strap. \"In a minute's time a fire crew would be on the way to my assistance in a motor-truck.\"  The ranger handed Charley the empty cup and thanked him.  \"Have some more coffee?\" urged Charley.  \"'Get thee behind me, Satan,'\" quoted the ranger. \"I believe you'd keep me here all day if you could. I must be moving.\"  \"Just a minute,\" pleaded Charley. \"You said it was difficult to find fire patrols. Could I get a job as a fire patrol? I don't know as much about fighting fire as you do, but I can patrol the forest and report fires as well as anybody.\"  \"I wish you could be a patrol,\" replied the ranger heartily. \"I'm sure you'd make a good one. You seem to like the forest. But I don't believe it is possible. The chief never hires anybody under twenty-one years of age excepting in very unusual circumstances. In fact, I know of only two such cases. And those two boys were almost of age and were unusualy well qualified. I'm sorry, for I'd like to see you in the Forest Service. Good-bye.\" He turned on his heel and was gone.  Lew watched the ranger until he disappeared from view. Charley scarcely glanced at him. He was lost in thought. Evidently his thoughts were not pleasant, for from time to time he scowled.  \"Lew,\" he said, at length, \"I never realized until this minute just what that sign on the old hemlock meant.\" And he quoted: \"'Everybody loses when timber burns.' It's true. <i>Everybody</i> loses--positively everybody. The sportsmen lose game, the fishermen lose fish, the towns lose their water-supply, the mills lose their water-power, civilization loses wood. Why, Lew, civilization's built of wood. How could we live without it? And as for me, think what I've lost through forest fires. I've lost an opportunity to own half of a boat. I've suffered from thirst. I've lost a chance to catch some fish. And, Lew, I've lost a college education! I never understood it before. If the cost of lumber hadn't gone up so much, Dad could have paid for his house easily and helped me through college. Now I've got to give up going to college. I've got to work two or three years for Dad and if ever I get married and want to build a home, I see where I've got to slave for the rest of my life to pay for the lumber that's in it, and the wooden furnishings inside of it. Think of it, Lew! You and I and all the rest of us have to work for years and years just to pay for what a lot of reckless people did before we were born. It's terrible, Lew, terrible. I've got to spend three years in a factory because of it. I thought for a minute that I might get a job here in the forest. That would have been grand. But there's no such luck. It's the factory for me. I'm sure of it. I don't know how I'll ever stand it, Lew.\"     Chapter V  A Lost Opportunity    Half an hour later the two boys were all but ready to go on. Before rolling his pack, Charley filled his coffee-pot in the run and thoroughly soaked the last embers of their fire.  \"You'll never burn any timber,\" he said, as he poured on the last potful. Then he stowed the coffee-pot in his pack and in a few moments the two boys were once more afoot.  They struck directly for the top of the knob, as the ranger had told them to do. The slope of the ground alone guided them. So dense was the stand of timber that the huge trunks shut off the view in all directions. It was almost as though they were encircled by palisades. And so thick was the shade that rarely did a sunbeam reach the earth. They were in the forest primeval, a land of perpetual gloom. There was no underbrush and they could travel rapidly. In a very short time they came to the top of the knob.  The summit had been entirely cleared of timber. On the very highest point one lone tree remained. A long pole had been planted near its trunk, with its top fastened to a branch of the tree. Crossbars between the tree and the pole made a sort of rude ladder of the affair. And well up the tree a rough staging had been constructed of small limbs. The boys saw at once that this was a rude sort of watch-tower, and they suspected that the ranger had been in the tree when he discovered the smoke from their fire.  They climbed up the tree and surveyed the scene before them in silence. Indeed, it was too sublime for words. On every side stretched the forest. Mile upon mile, league after league, east, west, north, south, far as the eye could reach, spread the leafy roof of the forest, seemingly illimitable, boundless, vast as the ocean, a sea of trees. And like a sea the forest rose and fell in huge billows. On either hand great mountains reared their huge bulk heavenward. Beyond them other ranges heaved their rugged crests aloft. And still other ranges lay beyond these. Over all was a cover of living green, the canopy of the forest. Sublime, majestic, awesome, almost overpowering was the spectacle. And neither lad could find words to express the emotion that arose within him. So they stood and looked in silent wonder. Finally Charley spoke.  \"It's worth all we've been through, Lew, just to see this,\" he said. \"I shall be well paid for the trip, even if we never get a fish.\"  Presently Lew looked up at the sun. Then he examined the mountains a little to the left of the sun.  \"There's where we go,\" he said, pointing over the nearest ridge to a gap in the mountain beyond it. \"The trout-stream will be in the third valley. We've got to travel due east. And it will be some hike, too--over a mountain and through a high gap. Let's pick out our landmarks and get under way. It will take us a good many hours to make it, but we ought to be there in time to have trout for supper.\"  For a few moments the boys examined the way in silence.  \"See that bunch of rocks on the summit?\" asked Lew. \"They look like chimney-rocks from here. Anyway, they stick up higher than any other part of the mountain. And there's three tall pines right beside them. That's a good landmark. It's exactly in a straight line for the gap. We can find that mark if we can find anything. But you can't see very clearly through this timber. Was there ever anything like it?\"  \"Finest timber I ever set eyes on, Lew. Isn't it wonderful? and to think that the whole state was once covered with timber like that!\"  They climbed down the rude ladder, slipped their packs over their shoulders, and set off down the mountainside at a fast pace. And they could go fast in such timber. No underbrush tripped them or caught in their sacks. No low limbs impeded their progress. Indeed there was hardly a limb nearer the ground than fifty feet. Their only care was for the rocks and the roughness underfoot. From time to time they paused as they came to some mammoth pine, and gazed in awed wonder at its huge bulk.  As they got down into the bottom the timber seemed to be even larger than it was on the slope. The forest floor was soft and springy. Their feet sank into it as into a soft, thick rug. The top of this leafy covering was dry enough; but a few inches under the surface, the forest mold was as moist as though a shower had just fallen. Yet there had been almost no rain for months. Not only did the leaves hold the moisture, but the very shade itself conserved it by preventing evaporation.  In the very centre of the valley ran a little stream. Long before they could see it, they heard the brook talking to itself. The forest was filled with a gentle murmur, which grew to a distinct rushing sound as they approached the stream.  \"Can't you just hear it speak?\" said Lew. \"What do you suppose it is saying?\"  \"Those really are voices,\" insisted Charley.  \"Now who's getting dippy?\" laughed Lew. \"You'll be as bad as I am if you keep on.\"  \"But I do hear voices,\" protested Charley. \"I plainly heard the word 'six.' Listen. Somebody said 'eight,' just as plain as could be.\"  Lew looked puzzled. \"Of course there might be some fishermen in here besides ourselves,\" he said.  They looked carefully about them, but at first saw nothing. Then a voice distinctly said, \"Hemlock--five.\" There could no longer be any doubt. Some one besides themselves was in the forest.  They made their way in the direction of the sound. Presently they saw three men. Two of them carried calipers and walked in advance. The third came behind and held a pencil and note-book.  \"Wonder who they are and what they are doing,\" Charley said quietly.  \"Let's watch and see.\"  But in a"]]]
