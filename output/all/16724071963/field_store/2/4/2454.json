We did not know whether to run or stand, when Captain Field gave the command to fire and charge the bushes. We charged the bushes and saw the Yankees running through them, and we fired on them as they retreated.  I do not know how many Yankees were killed, if any.  Our company (H) had one man killed, Pat Hanley, an Irishman, who had joined our company at Chattanooga.  Hugh Padgett and Dr. Hooper, and perhaps one or two others, were wounded.  After the fighting was over, where, O where, was all the fine rigging heretofore on our officers?  They could not be seen.  Corporals, sergeants, lieutenants, captains, all had torn all the fine lace off their clothing.  I noticed that at the time and was surprised and hurt. I asked several of them why they had torn off the insignia of their rank, and they always answered, \"Humph, you think that I was going to be a target for the Yankees to shoot at?\"  You see, this was our first battle, and the officers had not found out that minnie as well as cannon balls were blind; that they had no eyes and could not see.  They thought that the balls would hunt for them and not hurt the privates.  I always shot at privates.  It was they that did the shooting and killing, and if I could kill or wound a private, why, my chances were so much the better. I always looked upon officers as harmless personages.  Colonel Field, I suppose, was about the only Colonel of the war that did as much shooting as the private soldier.  If I shot at an officer, it was at long range, but when we got down to close quarters I always tried to kill those that were trying to kill me.   SEWELL MOUNTAIN  From Cheat Mountain we went by forced marches day and night, over hill and everlasting mountains, and through lovely and smiling valleys, sometimes the country rich and productive, sometimes rough and broken, through towns and villages, the names of which I have forgotten, crossing streams and rivers, but continuing our never ceasing, unending march, passing through the Kanawha Valley and by the salt-works, and nearly back to the Ohio river, when we at last reached Sewell Mountain.  Here we found General John B. Floyd strongly entrenched and fortified and facing the advance of the Federal army.  Two days before our arrival he had charged and captured one line of the enemy's works.  I know nothing of the battle.  See the histories for that.  I only write from memory, and that was twenty years ago, but I remember reading in the newspapers at that time of some distinguished man, whether he was captain, colonel or general, I have forgotten, but I know the papers said \"he sought the bauble, reputation, at the cannon's mouth, and went to glory from the death-bed of fame.\"  I remember it sounded gloriously in print.  Now, reader, this is all I know of this grand battle.  I only recollect what the newspapers said about it, and you know that a newspaper always tells the truth.  I also know that beef livers sold for one dollar apiece in gold; and here is where we were first paid off in Confederate money. Remaining here a few days, we commenced our march again.  Sewell Mountain, Harrisonburg, Lewisburg, Kanawha Salt-works, first four, forward and back, seemed to be the programme of that day.  Rosecrans, that wiley old fox, kept Lee and Jackson both busy trying to catch him, but Rosey would not be caught.  March, march, march; tramp, tramp, tramp, back through the valley to Huntersville and Warm Springs, and up through the most beautiful valley--the Shenandoah--in the world, passing towns and elegant farms and beautiful residences, rich pastures and abundant harvests, which a Federal General (Fighting Joe Hooker), later in the war, ordered to be so sacked and destroyed that a \"crow passing over this valley would have to carry his rations.\"  Passing on, we arrived at Winchester.  The first night we arrived at this place, the wind blew a perfect hurricane, and every tent and marquee in Lee's and Jackson's army was blown down.  This is the first sight we had of Stonewall Jackson, riding upon his old sorrel horse, his feet drawn up as if his stirrups were much too short for him, and his old dingy military cap hanging well forward over his head, and his nose erected in the air, his old rusty sabre rattling by his side.  This is the way the grand old hero of a hundred battles looked.  His spirit is yonder with the blessed ones that have gone before, but his history is one that the country will ever be proud of, and his memory will be cherished and loved by the old soldiers who followed him through the war.   ROMNEY  Our march to and from Romney was in midwinter in the month of January, 1862.  It was the coldest winter known to the oldest inhabitant of these regions.  Situated in the most mountainous country in Virginia, and away up near the Maryland and Pennsylvania line, the storm king seemed to rule in all of his majesty and power.  Snow and rain and sleet and tempest seemed to ride and laugh and shriek and howl and moan and groan in all their fury and wrath.  The soldiers on this march got very much discouraged and disheartened.  As they marched along icicles hung from their clothing, guns, and knapsacks; many were badly frost bitten, and I heard of many freezing to death along the road side.  My feet peeled off like a peeled onion on that march, and I have not recovered from its effects to this day.  The snow and ice on the ground being packed by the soldiers tramping, the horses hitched to the artillery wagons were continually slipping and sliding and falling and wounding themselves and sometimes killing their riders.  The wind whistling with a keen and piercing shriek, seemed as if they would freeze the marrow in our bones.  The soldiers in the whole army got rebellious--almost mutinous--and would curse and abuse Stonewall Jackson; in fact, they called him \"Fool Tom Jackson.\"  They blamed him for the cold weather; they blamed him for everything, and when he would ride by a regiment they would take occasion, _sotto voce_, to abuse him, and call him \"Fool Tom Jackson,\" and loud enough for him to hear.  Soldiers from all commands would fall out of ranks and stop by the road side and swear that they would not follow such a leader any longer.  When Jackson got to Romney, and was ready to strike Banks and Meade in a vital point, and which would have changed, perhaps, the destiny of the war and the South, his troops refused to march any further, and he turned, marched back to Winchester and tendered his resignation to the authorities at Richmond.  But the great leader's resignation was not accepted.  It was in store for him to do some of the hardest fighting and greatest generalship that was done during the war.  One night at this place (Romney), I was sent forward with two other soldiers across the wire bridge as picket.  One of them was named Schwartz and the other Pfifer--he called it Fifer, but spelled it with a P--both full-blooded Dutchmen, and belonging to Company E, or the German Yagers, Captain Harsh, or, as he was more generally called, \"God-for-dam.\"  When we had crossed the bridge and taken our station for the night, I saw another snow storm was coming.  The zig-zag lightnings began to flare and flash, and sheet after sheet of wild flames seemed to burst right over our heads and were hissing around us.  The very elements seemed to be one aurora borealis with continued lightning.  Streak after streak of lightning seemed to be piercing each the other, the one from the north and the other from the south.  The white clouds would roll up, looking like huge snow balls, encircled with living fires.  The earth and hills and trees were covered with snow, and the lightnings seemed to be playing \"King, King Canico\" along its crusted surface.  If it thundered at all, it seemed to be between a groaning and a rumbling sound.  The trees and hills seemed white with livid fire.  I can remember that storm now as the grandest picture that has ever made any impression on my memory.  As soon as it quit lightning, the most blinding snow storm fell that I ever saw.  It fell so thick and fast that I got hot.  I felt like pulling off my coat.  I was freezing.  The winds sounded like sweet music.  I felt grand, glorious, peculiar; beautiful things began to play and dance around my head, and I supposed I must have dropped to sleep or something, when I felt Schwartz grab me, and give me a shake, and at the same time raised his gun and fired, and yelled out at the top of his voice, \"Here is your mule.\"  The next instant a volley of minnie balls was scattering the snow all around us.  I tried to walk, but my pants and boots were stiff and frozen, and the blood had ceased to circulate in my lower limbs.  But Schwartz kept on firing, and at every fire he would yell out, \"Yer is yer mool!\"  Pfifer could not speak English, and I reckon he said \"Here is your mule\" in Dutch.  About the same time we were hailed from three Confederate officers, at full gallop right toward us, not to shoot.  And as they galloped up to us and thundered right across the bridge, we discovered it was Stonewall Jackson and two of his staff. At the same time the Yankee cavalry charged us, and we, too, ran back across the bridge.   STANDING PICKET ON THE POTOMAC  Leaving Winchester, we continued up the valley.  The night before the attack on Bath or Berkly Springs, there fell the largest snow I ever saw.  Stonewall Jackson had seventeen thousand soldiers at his command. The Yankees were fortified at Bath.  An attack was ordered, our regiment marched upon top of a mountain overlooking the movements of both armies in the valley below.  About 4 o'clock one grand charge and rush was made, and the Yankees were routed and skedaddled.  By some circumstance or other, Lieutenant J. Lee Bullock came in command of the First Tennessee Regiment.  But Lee was not a graduate of West Point, you see.  The Federals had left some spiked batteries on the hill side,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13202"],["title","\"Co. Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#4)"],["body"," as we were informed by an old citizen, and Lee, anxious to capture a battery, gave the new and peculiar command of, \"Soldiers, you are ordered to go forward and capture a battery; just piroute up that hill; piroute, march. Forward, men; piroute carefully.\"  The boys \"pirouted\" as best they could.  It may have been a new command, and not laid down in Hardee's or Scott's tactics; but Lee was speaking plain English, and we understood his meaning perfectly, and even at this late day I have no doubt that every soldier who heard the command thought it a legal and technical term used by military graduates to go forward and capture a battery.  At this place (Bath), a beautiful young lady ran across the street. I have seen many beautiful and pretty women in my life, but she was the prettiest one I ever saw.  Were you to ask any member of the First Tennessee Regiment who was the prettiest woman he ever saw, he would unhesitatingly answer that he saw her at Berkly Springs during the war, and he would continue the tale, and tell you of Lee Bullock's piroute and Stonewall Jackson's charge.  We rushed down to the big spring bursting out of the mountain side, and it was hot enough to cook an egg.  Never did I see soldiers more surprised.  The water was so hot we could not drink it.  The snow covered the ground and was still falling.  That night I stood picket on the Potomac with a detail of the Third Arkansas Regiment.  I remember how sorry I felt for the poor fellows, because they had enlisted for the war, and we for only twelve months. Before nightfall I took in every object and commenced my weary vigils. I had to stand all night.  I could hear the rumblings of the Federal artillery and wagons, and hear the low shuffling sound made by troops on the march.  The snow came pelting down as large as goose eggs.  About midnight the snow ceased to fall, and became quiet.  Now and then the snow would fall off the bushes and make a terrible noise.  While I was peering through the darkness, my eyes suddenly fell upon the outlines of a man.  The more I looked the more I was convinced that it was a Yankee picket.  I could see his hat and coat--yes, see his gun.  I was sure that it was a Yankee picket.  What was I to do?  The relief was several hundred yards in the rear.  The more I looked the more sure I was. At last a cold sweat broke out all over my body.  Turkey bumps rose. I summoned all the nerves and bravery that I could command, and said: \"Halt! who goes there?\"  There being no response, I became resolute. I did not wish to fire and arouse the camp, but I marched right up to it and stuck my bayonet through and through it.  It was a stump.  I tell the above, because it illustrates a part of many a private's recollections of the war; in fact, a part of the hardships and suffering that they go through.  One secret of Stonewall Jackson's success was that he was such a strict disciplinarian.  He did his duty himself and was ever at his post, and he expected and demanded of everybody to do the same thing.  He would have a man shot at the drop of a hat, and drop it himself.  The first army order that was ever read to us after being attached to his corps, was the shooting to death by musketry of two men who had stopped on the battlefield to carry off a wounded comrade.  It was read to us in line of battle at Winchester.   SCHWARTZ AND PFIFER  At Valley Mountain the finest and fattest beef I ever saw was issued to the soldiers, and it was the custom to use tallow for lard.  Tallow made good shortening if the biscuits were eaten hot, but if allowed to get cold they had a strong taste of tallow in their flavor that did not taste like the flavor of vanilla or lemon in ice cream and strawberries; and biscuits fried in tallow were something upon the principle of 'possum and sweet potatoes.  Well, Pfifer had got the fat from the kidneys of two hind quarters and made a cake of tallow weighing about twenty-five pounds.  He wrapped it up and put it carefully away in his knapsack. When the assembly sounded for the march, Pfifer strapped on his knapsack. It was pretty heavy, but Pfifer was \"well heeled.\"  He knew the good frying he would get out of that twenty-five pounds of nice fat tallow, and he was willing to tug and toil all day over a muddy and sloppy road for his anticipated hot tallow gravy for supper.  We made a long and hard march that day, and about dark went into camp.  Fires were made up and water brought, and the soldiers began to get supper.  Pfifer was in a good humor.  He went to get that twenty-five pounds of good, nice, fat tallow out of his knapsack, and on opening it, lo and behold! it was a rock that weighed about thirty pounds.  Pfifer was struck dumb with amazement.  He looked bewildered, yea, even silly.  I do not think he cursed, because he could not do the subject justice.  He looked at that rock with the death stare of a doomed man.  But he suspected Schwartz. He went to Schwartz's knapsack, and there he found his cake of tallow. He went to Schwartz and would have killed him had not soldiers interfered and pulled him off by main force.  His eyes blazed and looked like those of a tiger when he has just torn his victim limb from limb.  I would not have been in Schwartz's shoes for all the tallow in every beef in Virginia.  Captain Harsh made Schwartz carry that rock for two days to pacify Pfifer.   THE COURT-MARTIAL  One incident came under my observation while in Virginia that made a deep impression on my mind.  One morning, about daybreak, the new guard was relieving the old guard.  It was a bitter cold morning, and on coming to our extreme outpost, I saw a soldier--he was but a mere boy--either dead or asleep at his post.  The sergeant commanding the relief went up to him and shook him.  He immediately woke up and seemed very much frightened. He was fast asleep at his post.  The sergeant had him arrested and carried to the guard-house.  Two days afterwards I received notice to appear before a court-martial at nine.  I was summoned to appear as a witness against him for being asleep at his post in the enemy's country.  An example had to be made of some one.  He had to be tried for his life.  The court-martial was made up of seven or eight officers of a different regiment.  The witnesses all testified against him, charges and specifications were read, and by the rules of war he had to be shot to death by musketry.  The Advocate- General for the prosecution made the opening speech.  He read the law in a plain, straightforward manner, and said that for a soldier to go to sleep at his post of duty, while so much depended upon him, was the most culpable of all crimes, and the most inexcusable.  I trembled in my boots, for on several occasions I knew I had taken a short nap, even on the very outpost.  The Advocate-General went on further to say, that the picket was the sentinel that held the lives of his countrymen and the liberty of his country in his hands, and it mattered not what may have been his record in the past.  At one moment he had forfeited his life to his country.  For discipline's sake, if for nothing else, you gentlemen that make up this court-martial find the prisoner guilty.  It is necessary for you to be firm, gentlemen, for upon your decision depends the safety of our country.  When he had finished, thinks I to myself, \"Gone up the spout, sure; we will have a first-class funeral here before night.\"  Well, as to the lawyer who defended him, I cannot now remember his speeches; but he represented a fair-haired boy leaving his home and family, telling his father and aged mother and darling little sister farewell, and spoke of his proud step, though a mere boy, going to defend his country and his loved ones; but at one weak moment, when nature, tasked and taxed beyond the bounds of human endurance, could stand no longer, and upon the still and silent picket post, when the whole army was hushed in slumber, what wonder is it that he, too, may have fallen asleep while at his post of duty.  Some of you gentlemen of this court-martial may have sons, may have brothers; yes, even fathers, in the army.  Where are they tonight? You love your children, or your brother or father.  This mere youth has a father and mother and sister away back in Tennessee.  They are willing to give him to his country.  But oh! gentlemen, let the word go back to Tennessee that he died upon the battlefield, and not by the hands of his own comrades for being asleep at his post of duty.  I cannot now remember the speeches, but one thing I do know, that he was acquitted, and I was glad of it.   \"THE DEATH WATCH\"  One more scene I can remember.  Kind friends--you that know nothing of a soldier's life--I ask you in all candor not to doubt the following lines in this sketch.  You have no doubt read of the old Roman soldier found amid the ruins of Pompeii, who had stood there for sixteen hundred years, and when he was excavated was found at his post with his gun clasped in his skeleton hands.  You believe this because it is written in history. I have heard politicians tell it.  I have heard it told from the sacred desk.  It is true; no one doubts it.  Now, were I to tell something that happened in this nineteenth century exactly similar, you would hardly believe it.  But whether you believe it or not, it is for you to say.  At a little village called Hampshire Crossing, our regiment was ordered to go to a little stream called St. John's Run, to relieve the 14th Georgia Regiment and the 3rd Arkansas.  I cannot tell the facts as I desire to.  In fact, my hand trembles so, and my feelings are so overcome, that it is hard for me to write at all.  But we went to the place that we were ordered to go to, and when we arrived there we found the guard sure enough.  If I remember correctly, there were just eleven of them.  Some were sitting down and some were lying down; but each and every one was as cold and as hard frozen as the icicles that hung from"]]]
