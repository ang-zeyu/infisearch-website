We could use the ship to follow 'em, and land and fight where we found 'em.\"  \"To be sure,\" Ensign Darrin agreed.  \"But the Mexicans, knowing their own swamps, would have considerable advantage.  They might have part of their force retreat, drawing us further and further into a swamp, and then have another force get between us and our ships.\"  \"Let 'em try it,\" retorted Dan Dalzell, grimly, \"If there is anything new that the Greasers want to know about American methods of fighting, our fleet is full of officers who are willing to be patient instructors.  But take my word for it, Dave, if the Mexicans ever try to draw us into one of those swamps, they'll learn so much about real Yankee fighting that it will be fatal to all the Mexicans who take the instruction from us!\"  \"That's all very good,\" Darrin nodded, thoughtfully.  \"Still, we shall make a greater success of operations in the swamps if we study them as much as possible at present.\"  \"I hope the study will soon be followed by a recitation,\" grinned Dalzell.  \"I feel that I'm going stale with so much study.  Now, if we could only hear a few shots, and then fall in with an advancing firing line!\"  \"You bloodthirsty wretch!\" rebuked Ensign Darrin, but he smiled in sympathy.  \"This waiting and watching grows wearisome,\" groaned Danny Grin.  \"But we're watching behind big guns,\" returned Dave Darrin, grimly. \"Surely, when our ships are down here in such force, and others are being rushed through preparation before coming into these waters, there must be something more in the air than the ordinary kind of watching and waiting.  Cheer up, Dan!  Before long you'll hear some of our big guns speak, and you'll hear the rattle of small arms, too.\"  \"Understand, please,\" begged Dalzell, \"I'm not bloodthirsty, and I abhor the very thought of war, but, since we're doing all the watching and waiting, I wish these Mexicans would hurry up and start something!\"  Trent climbed to the superstructure.  Then, catching sight of his juniors, he came toward them.  \"What are you doing?\" he asked.  \"Watching,\" sighed Dave.  \"And waiting,\" added Danny Grin.  \"Then perhaps you youngsters will be interested in the news of what's going on under this superstructure,\" suggested Lieutenant Trent.  \"What's happening below?\" demanded Dalzell.  \"More watching---and waiting?\"  \"Why, I have an idea that we won't have to wait much longer,\" replied Trent, smiling at the eager faces before him.  \"I've just learned that, for the last twenty minutes, Captain Gales has been standing in the wireless room, and that Commander Bainbridge is with him.  They are, so I hear, having a hot and heavy wireless talk with Admiral Fletcher.\"  \"A little _talk_, as a relief from so much watching and waiting, eh?\" asked Darrin, dryly.  \"Why, I believe that the talk is going to lead to something real,\" replied Lieutenant Trent, trying hard to keep the flash of excitement from showing in his own eyes.  The fact is, something has happened.\"  \"Don't 'string' us like that!\" urged Danny Grin.  \"Why, Trent, the American Navy, and the Army, too, has been waiting for three years or more for something to happen.  But so far it has all happened on the Mexican side.  Don't tell us, at this late day, that the United States is going to start anything to happening on the other side.\"  \"There's something up,\" Trent insisted.  \"I don't know what it is; I haven't an idea of the nature of the happening, but of this I feel rather sure,---that now, at last, the Mexicans have done something that will turn Yankee guns and Yankee men loose.\"  \"I wonder if you're any good as a prophet, Trent?\" pondered Dan, studying his division officer's face keenly.  \"We'll wait and see,\" laughed the lieutenant.  \"If there really is anything in the wind, I think we'll have a suspicion of what it is by mess-hour to-night.  A little more watching and waiting won't hurt us.\"  \"Hear that commotion on the quarter-deck?\" demanded Dave, suddenly. \"I hear a lot of talking there.  Come on.  We'll see if _waiting_ is about to be turned into _doing_.\"  Trent walked slowly aft.  Still chatting with him, Dave and Dan kept by his side.  Then they stood looking down upon the quarter-deck.  Presently two messengers came running out, looking eagerly about them.  One messenger, catching sight of the three officers on the superstructure, came bounding up the steps, halting and saluting.  \"Compliments of the executive officer,\" announced the messenger; \"Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell are directed to report to his office immediately.\"  \"Perhaps you'll hear the news at once,\" murmured Trent, as his juniors left him.  When the two ensigns reported to him, Commander Bainbridge was pacing the passageway outside his office.  \"The captain is awaiting us in his office,\" said the executive. \"We will go there at once.\"  The instant he entered the captain's quarters, Darrin had sudden misgivings of some impending misfortune, for Lieutenant Cantor, very erect, and looking both stern and important, was talking in low tones with Captain Gales.  \"Now, what has the scoundrel found to fasten upon me?\"  Ensign Dave Darrin wondered, with a start.  \"And how has he managed to drag Dan into it?\"     CHAPTER VI  FIRST TO INVADE MEXICO   \"Gentlemen,\" began Captain Gales, seriously, though there was a pleasant smile on his face, \"I imagine I have extremely pleasant news for two of you.  Commander Bainbridge and Lieutenant Trent have already some idea of the news, but I will go over it again for the benefit of all here.\"  \"I may go on breathing again,\" Dave thought grimly.  \"Then this communication can hardly be in reference to any complaint that Cantor may have lodged against me.\"  \"Messrs. Cantor, Darrin and Dalzell will tonight,\" resumed the captain, \"lead the first expeditions by United States forces that have been made in a great many years.\"  Had war been declared?  Both Dave and Dan fairly jumped with eagerness.  \"A letter, coming by some mysterious, round-about route,\" continued Captain Gales, \"has reached the American consul at Vera Cruz. An American party, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. John Carmody and two small sons, and of Mrs. Sarah Deeming and two daughters nineteen and sixteen years of age, came down by muleback from the plateau some three weeks ago.  Carmody is a planter up in that part of the country, and the Deemings were his guests.  Different bands of bandit raiders have visited the Carmody plantation from time to time within the last two years, stealing stock and supplies, and levying money blackmail, until Carmody found himself practically ruined, unless the present crops should turn out well.  \"Three weeks ago Carmody learned that it was high time for isolated Americans to reach the protection of some large town.  Attended by two peons (native laborers), and travelling on mule back, the party started through the mountains for Vera Cruz.  Four hours out from the plantation the party was halted by a score of men led by a brigand named Cosetta, who is reported to be the right hand man of the notorious Zapata himself.  \"Cosetta, it appears, believed that he could force Carmody to pay a large indemnity, in money, for the release of himself and family and their woman friends.  First of all, the Americans were taken to a house near a deserted sugar mill, somewhere on the coast opposite us.  This sugar mill stands on a lagoon, and that is as much of a description as Carmody could furnish in his hastily penned letter.  But we know that there are, along this part of the coast, three such deserted sugar mills, each standing on a lagoon.  \"Plainly, the Carmodys must be in the house near one of these three mills, but which one it is we cannot even guess.  Admiral Fletcher sent me the news two hours ago, by wireless.  Ever since then we have been in earnest communication upon the subject, and now I have my orders in the matter.\"  \"It would be possible, of course, for us to visit each one of these lagoons in turn.  However, if we visited the wrong mill first, these bandits undoubtedly have some means of signaling to comrades.  Our landing party might be observed, and the news of the attempt at rescue would be signaled by fires or otherwise, and the discovery of our designs would undoubtedly result in the Carmody party being butchered at once.  \"Acting under the orders of Cosetta, or, I might say, under his threats, Mr. Carmody has sent appeals in every direction he could think of for the funds to pay the hundred thousand dollar ransom demanded for the party.  These requests have been carried on through agents of Cosetta, but none of the appeals have borne fruit. Wearied, Cosetta has announced that on a certain morning, if the ransom has not arrived, Carmody and all the members of his party, even including the children, shall be shot and buried in hidden graves.  There is little doubt that Cosetta will carry out his threat, and to-morrow morning is the time set for this wholesale murder.\"  Fire flashed in the eyes of the Navy officers who heard this announcement.  \"As you may be certain,\" continued Captain Gales, \"Admiral Fletcher has wired me that this proposed atrocity must be prevented, and the American captives rescued at all hazards.  Now, attend me while I show you the detail chart for this part of the coast.\"  Captain Gales turned to his desk, where the map was spread.  \"Here, as you will see,\" he continued, \"is a sugar mill belonging to the Alvarez plantations.  Ten miles to the eastward of the Alvarez "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12776"],["title","Dave Darrin at Vera Cruz: Fighting with the U.S. Navy in Mexico (#8)"],["body","is the Perdita mill; ten miles to the westward of the Alvarez mill is the Acunda mill.  To-night there will be no moon.  At nine o'clock we shall lie to off the Alvarez mill, and three sixty-foot launches will be lowered to the water.  Lieutenant Cantor will command one of these launches, Ensign Darrin another and Ensign Dalzell the third.  Each launch will carry one automatic gun, and a landing party of a corporal, six marines, a petty officer and twelve seamen.  Each party will be armed, but, gentlemen, I must caution you as to the extreme seriousness of any conflict on shore, or of firing, even though your fire is not directed at human beings.  These are days when our relations with Mexico are of an extremely delicate nature.  If we send an armed party on shore, and its members fight, it will be difficult, indeed, for our government to make the claim that an act of war was not committed on the soil of a nation that is, at present, at peace with us.  The consequences of a fight are likely to be grave indeed. Therefore, the officer in command of each landing party is especially warned that the rescue of the American prisoners must be accomplished by strategy, not by fighting.\"  Captain Gales looked keenly at each of the three young officers concerned, to make sure that they understood the full gravity of the situation.  \"Strategy, remember---not fighting,\" Captain Gales repeated. \"Now, the '_Long Island_' will not go within four miles of the coast.  Yet, despite the darkness to-night, it is likely that a craft as large as this ship would be noted from the shore, and her errand suspected.  That might result in the execution of the American captives before aid could reach them.  So, when we reach a point opposite the Alvarez mill, Lieutenant Cantor's launch will be put over the side first, while the ship continues under slow headway.\"  Lieutenant Cantor will lie to, while the other two launches are being lowered.  Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell will then steam back and report to Lieutenant Cantor.  Under slow speed it will take the launches, commanded by the two ensigns, each about an hour and ten minutes to reach their respective lagoon destinations. It will take the lieutenant just under thirty minutes to reach the Alvarez lagoon.  Ensign Dalzell will go to the Perdita lagoon, and Ensign Darrin to the Acunda lagoon.  Forty minutes after Dalzell and Darrin have steamed away, Lieutenant Cantor will run in to the Alvarez mill.  Our launches are not likely to be observed from shore, where the '_Long Island_,' if she remained in these waters, would be sure to be seen and recognized.  \"Therefore, after dropping the steamers, we shall go ahead at cruising speed and not return opposite the Alvarez mill until called by a rocket, which Lieutenant Cantor will send up as soon as the rescue has been accomplished---or has failed.  But, gentlemen\"---here Captain Gales' voice sank low, yet vibrated with intense earnestness---\"all of you will realize the extreme importance of your mission, and the awful consequences of failure. Therefore, I feel certain that none of you will break the Navy's long list of traditions for zealous, careful, successful performance of duty.  Lieutenant Cantor will be in command of the expedition, as a whole.\"  For some minutes the officers remained in the captain's quarters, discussing further the important work of the coming night.  As no instructions for secrecy had been asked or expected, Commander Bainbridge soon told the news to a few of the \"_Long Island's_\" ranking officers, who, in turn passed it on.  \"Of all the luck that some officers have!\" groaned Lieutenant Trent, as he passed Dave Darrin.  \"How did you work it, Darrin, to secure one of the details for to-night that any subordinate officer on this ship would have been delighted to see come his way?\"  \"I don't know,\" Dave laughingly admitted.  \"Darrin, are you hard up?\" asked Lieutenant Holton, five minutes later.  \"I have a few dollars left,\" Dave smiled.  \"If you can get me shifted to your detail for to-night I'll reward you with a month of my pay,\" promised the lieutenant.  \"Thank you,\" Dave smiled, gravely.  \"Even if the change could be easily arranged, I'm afraid I wouldn't give up my chance for six months' pay.\"  \"No chance for me, then,\" sighed Holton.  \"I can't remember that I ever had six months' of my pay together at one time.\"  \"Darrin,\" exclaimed Lieutenant Commander Denton, still a little later, \"I never realized that you had so much impudence!  The idea of a mere ensign leading such an expedition ashore to-night! I wanted that myself.\"  \"I am not at all sure that my performance will be one of glory,\" smiled Darrin.  \"It won't, if Cantor can manage to queer you in any way,\" murmured Denton to himself, as he moved on.  In the ward-room that evening the \"impertinence\" of two new ensigns in capturing such prized details was commented upon with a great deal of chaffing.  Even Lieutenant Cantor was declared to be much too young to be entrusted with such important work.  At eight o'clock the fortunate lieutenant and ensigns were once more sent for, to go over the map and instructions with Captain Gales.  At nine o'clock, just before the \"_Long Island_\" was abreast of the Alvarez mill, the first launch was cleared away and lowered, falling behind and lying to.  Then Darrin, with his own crew, went down over the side to the launch towing alongside.  It was Coxswain Riley who stood by to catch the young commanding officer's arm.  \"Hullo, Coxswain,\" was Dave's greeting.  \"Are you to handle the launch to-night?\"  \"No, sir,\" Riley answered, saluting.  \"I am the petty officer in charge of the seamen.  Coxswain Schmidt handles the launch, sir.\"  As soon as his party had hurried aboard, Darrin gave the order to cast off.  Under slow speed astern the launch joined Lieutenant Cantor's craft.  \"I'm glad that I'm to have you on shore tonight with me, Coxswain,\" said Dave, heartily.  \"Thank you, sir,\" answered the coxswain, saluting and actually blushing with pleasure.  Soon after Dan's launch ranged up with the other two, and the \"_Long Island_\" was vanishing in the distance ahead, not a light showing, for it is the privilege of the commander of a war vessel to sail without lights, when the interests of the services may be furthered thereby.  Nor did any of the launches display lights.  As each of the boats was to run at slow speed, it was hoped that each landing party would reach shore without detection.  Lieutenant Cantor went over the instructions once more, talking in low tones across the water.  \"And above all, remember that there is to be no fighting,\" Cantor added, impressively, looking straight into Darrin's eyes.  \"Punk orders, when each man is provided with a hundred rounds of rifle ammunition, and when each automatic gun is supplied with two thousand rounds!\" grumbled Coxswain Riley, under his breath.  \"Gentlemen, you will now get under way,\" ordered Lieutenant Cantor. \"You will remember each sentence of your instructions!\"  Silently, two of the launches stole away into the night, bound east and west, while the third launch awaited the time to start shoreward.  On Darrin's launch there was little talking, and that in whispers. Dave had made a most careful study of the map, and felt certain that he could give the course straight into the lagoon on which the Acunda mill stood.  \"Coxswain Schmidt,\" said Ensign Darrin, in a low voice, when still some four miles away from the proposed place of landing, \"when you are close enough to shore to signal the engineer, you will do so by hand signal, not by use of the bell.  Seaman Berne will watch for your signals, and convey them to the engineer.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" replied both coxswain and seaman.  \"Probably it won't be my luck to find the American captives at the Acunda plantation,\" murmured Darrin.  None the less, when he at last sighted the lagoon, his heart began to beat excitedly.  Under reduced speed, now, the launch stole into the lagoon.  Less than a quarter of a mile from shore the sugar mill, deserted since the rebellion first took acute form, stood out dimly against the dark sky.  To within a hundred and fifty yards of the mill the launch ran, then swung in at a nearly ruined old wharf.  Ensign Dave Darrin was first to step ashore, signing to his men to follow him with all stealth.  \"Corporal,\" Darrin whispered, \"unless summoned later, you will stand by the launch with your men, to prevent it being rushed in case the bandits are abroad to-night.  Coxswain Riley, you will form your men loosely and follow me, keeping about a hundred yards to the rear, making no sound as you advance.\"  Officer and men were all in dark uniforms, which in the blackness of the night would not be seen at any distance, whereas the white tropical uniforms would have immediately betrayed the raiders.  About seven hundred feet beyond the sugar mill Darrin had already located the house.  Like the old mill, the residence was in darkness. Not a light shone, nor was there a sound to be heard.  \"This eerie stretch of ground makes one think of a graveyard,\" thought Darrin, with a comical little shiver, as his left hand gripped his sword scabbard tightly to prevent it clanking against his left heel.  He turned to look behind him.  Riley and twelve armed seamen were following him like so many unsubstantial spectres.  Past the mill, and down the road to the house strode Darrin, but his moving feet made hardly a sound.  A little before the house ran a line of flowering tropical hedge. Darrin gained this, and was about to pass in through an opening in the hedge when a figure suddenly appeared in the darkness right ahead of him.  A rifle was leveled at the young ensign's breast, and in a steady voice came the hail that set the young ensign's heart to beating fast:  \"_Quien vive_\"  It was the Spanish challenge---\"Who goes there?\"     CHAPTER VII  DAVE DARRIN TO THE RESCUE   Dave's sword hung at his side.  His revolver "]]]
