And now, a serious problem confronted the two survivors of that misunderstanding. What was to be done with the remains of the unsuccessful disputant?\"  Midshipman Trotter looked at each of the wondering plebes in turn. It looked as though he were asking the question of them.  \"I don't know, sir,\" admitted Dan Dalzell, at the left of the line.  \"I don't know, sir,\" admitted the man next to Dan.  So it went down the line, until Dave Darrin, at the further end, had admitted himself to be as much in the dark as were the others.  \"Then, listen,\" resumed Mr. Trotter impressively.  \"The Chinese, being descended from a very ancient civilization, are not only very ingenious but also very thrifty.  They were burdened with two hundred pounds of evidence on the premises.  In their extremity the two survivors cut up their late partner, cooked him, and disposed of the flesh at meal times.\"  From the gravity of the narrator's expression he appeared to be reciting a wholly true story.  \"Now, then,\" rasped out Midshipman Trotter, \"that being the state of affairs at the laundry--_what was the telephone number_?\"  Trotter's gaze was fixed on Dan Dalzell's face almost accusingly.  \"How the--\" began startled Dan gruffly.  Then, instantly realizing that he was making a mistake, he broke in hastily:  \"Beg your pardon, sir, but I don't understand how to get at the telephone number.\"  \"You try, mister,\" ordered Midshipman Trotter, turning to the plebe next to Dalzell.  \"I can't solve the problem, sir.\"  So it ran, straight down the line, each confessing his ignorance, until finally Mr. Trotter glared at Dave Darrin.  \"Come, come, mister, from the very exact narrative that I have given, can't you deduce the telephone number of that laundry?\"  \"Yes, sir; I think so,\" answered Darrin, with a slight smile.  \"Ah!  Then there's a man in the squad who is more than a mere saphead.  Let us have the telephone number, mister!  \"Two-ate-one-John,\" replied Dave promptly.  This was the correct answer.  Dave had heard that \"gag\" before.  \"Mister,\" beamed Mr. Trotter, \"I congratulate you.  You are no mollycoddle.  Your head is not over-fat, but somewhat stocked with ideas.  As soon as you have soaked in a few more ideas you will be fit to associate with the young gentlemen at this sailor-factory.  You may, therefore, take the washbowl, fill it half full of ideas, and stand on your head in them until they have soaked well in!\"  Poor Dave, his face flushed crimson, could have dropped in his humiliation at having thus fallen into the trap.  But he started manfully for the washbowl, which he half filled with water.  Meanwhile the other five plebes were choking.  They could have screamed in their glee--had they dared!  Placing the bowl where ordered, Dave bent down to his knees, immersing the top of his head in the water.  With hands on opposite sides of the bowl he balanced his feet, preparatory to hoisting them into place against the wall.  \"Up oars!\" commanded Mr. Hayes dryly.  From one of the visiting plebes came an incautious giggle.  Mr. Hayes turned and marked his man with a significant stare that made the unfortunate giggler turn red and white in turn with alarm.  At the order, \"up oars,\" Dave Darrin sent his feet aloft.  By rare good luck he succeeded the first time trying.  There he remained, his head in the bowl of water, his feet resting against the wall.  Just at this moment, though, the sound of trouble was in the air, even if it reached interested ears but faintly.  A step was heard in the corridor outside.  There was a faint knock.  The upper class midshipmen knew on the instant what the knock meant--and so indeed did Dave Darrin.     CHAPTER IV  THE \"YOUNGSTERS\" WHO BECAME \"SPOONS ON\"   It was a most critical moment in the life histories of several young men who had grown to consider themselves as future officers in the United States Navy!  Such a man as Midshipman Bender was certain to report any form of hazing he detected.  Now, the usual punishment meted out to hazers at either Annapolis or West Point is dismissal from the service!  True, this was not brutal hazing, but merely the light form of the sport known as \"running\" the new man.  Nevertheless, \"all hazing looks alike\" to the public, when posted by the newspapers, and the Naval Academy authorities deal severely with even \"running.\"  So, for all of the \"youngsters,\" or third class men, who had been conducting the evening's festivities, all the elements of trouble, and perhaps of dismissal, were at hand.  But Dave Darrin had been the first to hear the soft approach of footsteps, and somehow, he had guessed at the meaning of it all.  Just in the fraction of a second before the knock had sounded at the door Dave had made a fine handspring that brought him from his topsy-turvy attitude to a position of standing on his feet. And, at the same time, he held the washbowl in his hand without having spilled a drop of the water.  Like a flash Dave few across the room, depositing the bowl where it belonged.  With a towel he wiped his hair, then swiftly mopped his face dry.  Hair brush and comb in hand, he turned, saving:  \"Why, I suppose, gentlemen, Dalzell and myself were very fair athletes in the High School sense of the word.  But it's a long jump from that to aspiring to the Navy football team.  Of course we'll turn out for practice, if you wish, but--\"  At this moment, Lieutenant Bender, the \"duty-crazy\" one, thrust the door open.  Here Dave, on his way to the mirror, hairbrush and comb in hand, halted as though for the first time aware of the accusing presence of Bender, midshipman in charge of the floor for the day.  \"Uh-hum!\" choked Midshipman Bender more confused, even, than he had expected the others to be.  \"Looks like rather good material, doesn't he, Bender?\" inquired Mr. Trotter.  \"Green, of course, and yet--\"  \"I didn't come here to discuss Navy athletics,\" replied Midshipman Bender.  \"Oh, an official visit--is that it?\" asked shipman Hayes, favoring the official visitor with a baby-stare.  \"As it is past graduation, and there are no evening study hours, there is no regulation against visiting in the rooms of other members of the brigade.\"  \"No,\" snapped Mr. Bender, \"there is not.\"  Saying this the midshipman in charge turned on his heel and left the room.  An instant after the door had closed the lately scared youngsters expressed themselves by a broad grin, which deepened to a very decided chuckle as Mr. Bender's footsteps died away.  \"Mister,\" cried Midshipman Trotter, favoring Darrin with a glance of frank friendliness, \"do you know that you saved us from frapping the pap hard?\"  \"And that perhaps you've saved us from bilging?\" added Midshipman Hayes.  \"I'm such a greenhorn about the Navy, sir, that I am afraid I don't follow you in the least, sir,\" Darrin replied quietly.  Then they explained to him that the \"pap\" is the conduct report, and that \"to frap\" is to hit.  To \"frap the pap\" means to \"get stuck on\" the conduct report for a breach of discipline.  A \"bilger\" is one who is dropped from the service, or who is turned back to the class below.  \"I judged that there was some trouble coming sir,\" Dave confessed, \"and I did the best that I could.  It was good luck on my part that I was able to be of service to you.\"  \"Good luck, eh?\" retorted Midshipman Trotter.  \"Third class men, fall in!\"  As the \"youngsters\" lined up Mr. Trotter, standing at the right of the line, asked coaxingly:  \"Mister, will you be condescending enough to pass down the line and shake hands with each of us?\"  Flushing modestly, but grinning, Dave did as asked--or directed.  \"Mister,\" continued Midshipman Trotter impressively, \"we find ourselves very close to being 'spoons on' you.\"  For a youngster to be \"spoons on\" a new fourth classman means for the former to treat the latter very nearly as though he were a human being.  \"Now, you green dandelions may go,\" suggested Mr. Trotter, turning to the four \"visiting\" plebes.  As soon as this had come about Trotter turned to Dave Darrin.  \"Mister, we humble representatives of the third class are going to show you the only sign of appreciation within our power.  We are going to invite you to stroll down the deck and visit us in our steerage.  Your roommate is invited to join us.\"  Dave and Dan promptly accepted, with becoming appreciation.  All of the youngsters escorted Dave and Dan down the corridor to Midshipman Trotter's room.  In the course of the next hour the youngsters told these new midshipmen much about the life at the Naval Academy that it would otherwise have taken the two plebes long to have found out for themselves.  They were initiated into much of the slang language that the older midshipmen use when conversing together.  Many somewhat obscure points in the regulations were made clear to them.  Lest the reader may wonder why new fourth class men should tamely submit to hazing or \"running,\" when the regulations of the Naval Academy expressly prohibit these upper class sports, it may be explained that the midshipmen of the brigade have their own internal discipline.  A new man may very easily evade being hazed, if he insists upon it.  His first refusals will be met with challenges to fight.  If he continues to refuse to be \"hazed\" or \"run,\" he will soon find himself ostracized by all of the upper class men.  Then his own classmates will have to \"cut\" him, or they, too, will be \"cut.\" The man who is \"cut\" may usually as well resign from the Naval Academy at once.  His continued stay there will become impossible when no other midshipman will recognize him except in discharge of official duties.  The new man at Annapolis, if he has any sense at all, will quietly and cheerfully submit to being \"run.\"  This fate falls upon every new fourth class man, or nearly so.  The only fourth class man who escapes bring \"run\" is the one who is considered as being beneath notice.  Unhappy, indeed, is the plebe whom none"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],["title","Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#6)"],["body"," the youngsters above him will consent to haze.  And frequent it happens that the most popular man in an upper class is one who, while in the fourth class, was the most unmercifully hazed.  Often a new man at the Naval Academy arrives with a firm resolution to resist all attempts at running or hazing.  He considers himself as good as any of the upper class men, and is going to insist on uniformly good treatment from the upper class men.  If this be the new man's frame of mind he is set down as being \"ratey.\"  But often the new man arrives with a conviction that he will have to submit to a certain amount of good-natured hazing by his class elders.  Yet this man, from having been spoiled more or less at home, is \"fresh.\"  In this case he is called only \"touge.\"  Hence it is a far more hopeful sign to be \"touge\" than to be \"ratey.\"  The new man who honestly tries to be neither \"touge\" nor \"ratey,\" and who has a sensible resolve to submit to tradition, is sometimes termed \"almost sea-going.\"  Dave Darrin was promptly recognized as being \"almost sea-going.\" He would need but little running.  Dan Dalzell, on the other hand, was soon listed as being \"touge,\" though not \"ratey.\"     CHAPTER V  INVITED TO JOIN THE \"FRENCHERS\"   Within the nest few days several things happened that were of importance to the new fourth class men.  Other candidates arrived, passed the surgeons, and were sworn into Naval service.  Many of the young men who had passed the surgeons, and who had gone through the dreary, searching ordeals over in grim old Academic Hall, had now become members of the new fourth class.  As organized, the new fourth class started off with two hundred and twenty-four members--numerically a very respectable battalion.  At the outset, while supplied only with midshipmen's caps, and while awaiting the \"building\" of their uniforms, these new midshipmen were drilled by some of the members of the upper classes.  This state of affairs, however, lasted but very briefly.  Graduation being past, the members of the three upper classes were rather promptly embarked on three of the most modern battleships of the Navy and sent to sea for the summer practice cruise.  The night before embarkation Midshipman Trotter looked in briefly upon Dave Darrin and his roommate.  \"Well, mister,\" announced the youngster, with a paternal smile, \"somehow you'll have to get on through the rest of the summer without us.\"  \"It will be a time of slow learning for us, sir,\" responded Darrin, rising.  \"Your summer will henceforth be restful, if not exactly instructive,\" smiled Trotter.  \"In the absence of personal guidance, mister, strive as far as you can to reach the goal of being sea going.\"  \"I'll try, sir.\"  \"You won't have such hard work as your roommate,\" went on Trotter, favoring Dalzell with a sidelong look.  \"And, now, one parting bit of advice, mister.  Keep it at all times in mind that you must keep away from demoralizing association with the forty per cent.\"  Statistics show that about forty per cent of the men who enter the U.S. Naval Academy fail to get through, and are sent back into civil life.  Hence the joy of keeping with the winning \"sixty.\"  The next morning the members of the three upper classes had embarked aboard the three big battleships that lay at anchor in the Severn. It was not until two days afterwards that the battleships sailed, but the upper class men did not come ashore in the interval.  Soon after the delivery of uniforms to the new fourth class men began and continued rapidly.  Dave and Dan, having been among the first to have their measure taken, were among the earliest to receive their new Naval clothing.  A tremendously proud day it was for each new midshipman when he first surveyed himself, in uniform, in the mirror!  The regular summer course was now on in earnest for the new men.  On Mondays those belonging to the first and second divisions marched down to the seamanship building, there to get their first lessons in seamanship.  This began at eight o'clock, lasting until 9.30. During the same period the men who belonged to the third and fourth divisions received instruction in discipline and ordnance. In the second period, from 10 to 11.30 the members of the first and second division attended instruction in discipline and ordnance while the members of the third and fourth divisions attended seamanship.  In the afternoon, from 3 to 4.45, the halves of the class alternated between seamanship and marine engineering.  All instruction proceeded with a rapidity that made the heads of most of these new midshipmen whirl!  From 5 to 6 on the same afternoon the entire fourth class attended instruction in the art of swimming--and no midshipman hope to graduate unless he is a fairly expert swimmer!  Wednesday and Saturday afternoons were devoted to athletics and recreation.  A midshipman does not have his evenings for leisure.  On the first five evenings of each week, while one half of the class went to the gymnasium, the other half indulged in singing drill in Recreation Hall.  \"What's the idea of making operatic stars out of us?\" grumbled Dan to his roommate on day.  \"You always seem to get the wrong impression about everything, Danny boy,\" retorted Darrin, turning to his roommate with a quizzical smile.  \"The singing drill isn't given with a view to fitting you to sing in opera.\"  \"What, then?\" insisted Dan.  \"You are learning to sing, my dear boy, so that, later on, you will be able to deliver your orders from a battleship's bridge in an agreeable voice.\"  \"If my voice on the bridge is anything like the voice I develop in Recreation Hall,\" grimaced Dalzell, \"it'll start a mutiny right then and there.\"  \"Then you don't expect sailors of the Navy to stand for the kind of voice that is being developed in you in Recreation Hall?\" laughed Darrin.  \"Sailors are only human,\" grumbled Dalzell.  The rowing work, in the big ten-oared cutters proved one of the most interesting features of the busy summer life of the new men.  More than half of these fourth class midshipmen had been accustomed to rowing boats at home.  The work at Annapolis, however, they found to be vastly different.  The cutter is a fearfully heavy boat.  The long Naval oar is surprisingly full of avoirdupois weight.  True, a midshipman has to handle but one oar, but it takes him many, many days to learn how to do that properly.  Yet, as August came and wore along, the midshipmen found themselves becoming decidedly skilful in the work of handling the heavy cutters, and in handling boats under sail.  Competitive work and racing were encouraged by the Navy officers who had charge of this instruction.  Each boat was under the direct command of a midshipman who served as crew captain, with thirteen other midshipmen under him as crew.  When the post of crew captain fell to Dan Dalzell he embarked his crew, gave the order to shove off and let fall oars, and got away in good style.  Then, leaning indolently back Dan grinned luxuriously.  \"This is the post I'm cut out for,\" he murmured, so that stroke-oar heard him and grinned.  Yet, as \"evil communications corrupt good manners,\" Dan's attitude was reflected in his crew of classmates.  The cutter was manned badly at that moment.  \"Mr. Dalzell!\" rasped out the voice of Lieutenant Fenton, the instructor, from a near-by boat.  Dan straightened up as though shot.  But the Navy officer's voice continued sternly:  \"Sit up in a more seamanlike manner.  Pay close attention to the work of your boat crew.  Be alert for the best performance of duty in the boat that you command.  For your inattention, and worse, of a moment ago, Mr. Dalzell, you will put yourself on the conduct report.\"  The next morning, at breakfast formation, Dan's name was read from the \"pap.\"  He had been given five demerits.  This was below the gravity of his offense, but he had been let off lightly the first time.  \"You've got to stick to duty, and keep it always in mind,\" Darrin admonished his chum.  \"I don't intend to turn preachy, Dan; but you'll surely discover that the man who lets his indolence or sense of fun get away with him is much better off out of the Naval Academy.\"  \"Pooh!  A lot of the fellows have frapped the pap,\" retorted Dalzell. \"Demerits don't do any harm, unless you get enough of 'em to cause you to be dropped.\"  \"Well, if there is no higher consideration,\" argued Dave, \"at least you must remember that the number of demerits fixes your conduct grade.  If you want such liberties and privileges as are allowed to new midshipmen, you'll have to keep your name away from the pap.\"  \"Humph!  Setting your course toward the grease mark are you?\" jeered Dan.  \"Think it over!\" urged Dave Darrin patiently.  Before August was over the new fourth class men marched \"like veterans.\"  They had mastered all the work of drill, marching and parade, and felt that they could hold their own in the brigade when the upper class men returned.  On the 28th of August the three big battleships were sighted coming up the bay in squadron formation.  A little more than an hour later they rode at anchor.  It was not, however, until the 30th of August that the upper classmen were disembarked.  August 31 was devoted to manifold duties, including the hurried packing of light baggage, for now the members of the three upper classes were to enjoy a month's leave of absence before the beginning of the academic year on October 1.  Then, like a whirlwind mob, and clad in their \"cit.\" clothes, the upper class men got away on that hurried, frenzied leave.  There was no leave, however, for the new midshipmen.  In lieu of leave, through the month of September, the new fourth class men spent the time, each week-day, from ten o'clock until noon, at the \"Dago Department,\" as the Department of Modern Languages is termed.  Here they made their start in French.  \"When Trotter comes back,\" muttered Dan, \"if he asks me whether I can talk French, I'll tell him that I've tried, and now"]]]
