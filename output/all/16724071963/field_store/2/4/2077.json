Their long walk had given them good appetites, and the meal, homely as it was, was eaten with a relish. After they had rested a few moments, they started off in different directions, to commence the hunt. As Frank walked slowly along, with his gun on his shoulder, he could not help thinking of the many times he had been on such excursions about his native village. What a change a year had made! The \"Boys of Lawrence\" were no longer amateur sportsmen. They were scattered all over the country, engaged in the work of sustaining the integrity of the best government on earth. Would they ever all meet again? It was not at all likely. Perhaps some had already been offered up on the altar of their country; and if he should ever live to return home, there would be some familiar faces missing. In short, Frank was homesick. Finding himself once more in his favorite element had made him think of old times. He wandered slowly along, recalling many a fishing frolic and boat-race he had engaged in, until a loud chatter above his head roused him from his reverie. He looked up just in time to see a large squirrel striving to hide himself among the leaves on a tree that stood close by. Frank's gun was at his shoulder in a moment, and taking a quick aim at the squirrel, he pulled the trigger. But the old Springfield musket was not intended for fine shooting; for, though the shot cut the leaves all around, the squirrel escaped unhurt, and, running up to the topmost branch, again concealed himself. While Frank was reloading, Archie came up, and stood leaning on his gun, with rather a dejected air. \"What's the matter with you?\" inquired Frank.  \"I wish I was down to the river,\" answered Archie.  \"What would you do there? go fishing?\"  \"No, but I'd sink this musket so deep that no one would ever find it again. It don't shoot worth a row of pins. If I was standing twenty feet from the side of a barn, I couldn't hit it, I wish I had my shot-gun here.\"  \"So do I,\" answered Frank; \"I would very soon bring down that squirrel. I'm going to try him again;\" and going around to the side of the tree where the squirrel had taken refuge, he fired again, but with no better success. The squirrel, not in the least injured, appeared amid a shower of leaves, and speedily found a new hiding-place.  \"It's no use, I tell you,\" said Archie; \"you can't hit any thing with that musket.\"  \"It does look a little that way. But I must have that squirrel, if I have to shoot all day. Haven't you got a load in your gun?\"  \"Yes; but I might as well have none. I can kill as many squirrels by throwing the musket at them, as I can by shooting at them.\"  \"Never mind, fire away--the ammunition doesn't cost us any thing.\"  \"I know it; but another thing, this musket kicks like blazes. I had as soon stand before it, as behind it. But I'll try him;\" and Archie raised his gun and blazed away. This time there was no mistake; the squirrel was torn almost to pieces by the ball; and when the smoke cleared away, Frank saw his cousin sitting on the ground, holding both hands to his nose, which was bleeding profusely.  \"You've killed the squirrel,\" he said.  \"Yes,\" answered Archie; \"but I hurt myself as much as I did him.\"  Frank was a good deal amused, and could scarcely refrain from laughing at his cousin's misfortune. He tried to keep on a sober face, but the corners of his mouth would draw themselves out into a smile, in spite of himself. Archie noticed this, and exclaimed:  \"Oh, it's a good joke, no doubt.\"  \"If you would hold your gun firmly against your shoulder,\" said Frank, \"it wouldn't hurt half so bad. But hadn't we better go on?\"  Archie raised himself slowly from the ground, and they moved off through the woods. The squirrels were very plenty; but it required two or three, and, sometimes, as many as half a dozen shots, to bring one down.  At length, after securing four squirrels, their shoulders became so lame that they could scarcely raise their guns; so they concluded to give up shooting, and start in search of Woods and Simpson, who had gone off together. About noon they found them, sitting on the fence that ran between the woods and a road. Simpson had three squirrels in his hand.  \"We are waiting for you,\" he said, as Frank and Archie came up; \"it's about time to start for the boat.\"  \"I'm hungry,\" said Frank; \"why can't we go down to that house and hire some one to cook our squirrels for us?\"  \"That's a good idea,\" said Woods; \"come along;\" and he sprang off the fence, and led the way toward the house spoken of by Frank, which stood about a quarter of a mile down the road, toward the river.  As they opened the gate that led into the yard, they noticed that a man, who sat on the porch in front of the house, regarded them with a savage scowl on his face.  \"How cross that man looks!\" said Archie, who, with his cousin, was a little in advance of the others; \"maybe he's a reb.\"  \"How do you do, sir?\" inquired Frank, as he approached the place where the man was sitting.  \"What do yees want here?\" he growled, in reply.  \"We came here to see if we couldn't hire some one to cook a good dinner for us,\" answered Frank.  \"No, ye can't,\" answered the man, gruffly; \"get out o' here. I never did nothin' for a Yank, an' I never will. I'd like to see yer all drove from the country. Get out o' here, I tell yer,\" he shouted, seeing that the sailors did not move, \"or I'll let my dogs loose on yer!\"  \"Why, I really believe he is a reb,\" said Archie; \"he's the first one I ever saw. He looks just like any body else, don't he, boys?\"  \"If yees don't travel mighty sudden, I'll make a scatterin' among yer,\" said the man, between his clenched teeth; \"I'll be dog-gone if I don't shoot some o' yer;\" and he reached for a long double-barrel shot-gun that stood behind his chair.  \"Avast, there, you old landlubber,\" exclaimed Simpson; \"just drop that shootin' iron, will you. We're four to your one, and you don't suppose that we are going to stand still and be shot down, like turkeys on Thanksgivin' morning, do you? No, sir, that would be like the handle of a jug, all on one side. Shootin' is a game two can play at, you know. Come, put that we'pon down;\" and Simpson held his musket in the hollow of his arm, and handled the lock in a very significant manner.  The man saw that the sailors were not to be intimidated, and not liking the way Simpson eyed him, he leaned his gun up in the corner again, and muttered something about Yankee mudsills and Abolitionists.  \"Just clap a stopper on that jaw of yours, will you,\" said Simpson; \"or, shiver my timbers, if we don't try man-o'-war punishment on you. Now, Frank,\" he continued, \"you just jump up there, and shoot off the old rascal's gun; and then keep an eye on him, and don't let him get out of his chair; and the rest of us will look around and see what we can find in the way of grub.\"  Frank sprang up the steps that led on to the porch, and fired both barrels of the gun into the air, and then, drawing a chair to the other end of the porch, coolly seated himself, and deposited his feet on the railing; while the others went into the house, where they secured a pail of fresh milk and a loaf of bread. From the house they went into the wood-shed, where they found a quantity of sweet potatoes. They then returned to the place where they had left Frank.  \"Come on, now,\" said Woods; \"we'll have a tip-top dinner, in spite of the old secesh.  \"Hold on,\" said Frank; \"where are you going? I move we cook and eat our dinner here. There's a stove in the house, and every thing handy.\"  The man was accordingly invited into his own house by the boys, and requested to take a seat, and make himself perfectly at home, but to be careful and not go out of doors. They deposited their muskets in one corner of the room; and while Archie started a fire in the store, Frank dressed the squirrels, and washed some of the sweet potatoes, and placed them in the oven to bake. Woods drew the table out into the middle of the room; and Simpson, after a diligent search, found the cupboard, and commenced bringing out the dishes Frank superintended the cooking; and, in half an hour, a splendid dinner was smoking on the table. When the meal was finished, they shouldered their muskets, and Simpson said to the man:  \"Now, sir, we're very much obliged to you for your kindness; but, before we go, we want to give you a bit of advice. If you ever see any more Yankee sailors out this way, don't try to bully them by talking treason to them. If you do, just as likely as not you'll get hold of some who won't treat you as well as we have. They might go to work and clean out your shanty. Good day, sir;\" and Simpson led the way toward the boat.     CHAPTER VI.  Frank's First Exploit.   During the three months following that Frank and Archie were attached to the Illinois, they met with no adventure worthy of notice. They passed nearly every day in the woods, and, after considerable practice, had become splendid shots with their muskets; and as game was abundant, their table was kept well supplied.  At length, the new magazine-boat, which had for some time been building at Cairo, was towed alongside the Illinois, and a detachment of men from the receiving-ship were set to work to transfer the ammunition. The crew of the Illinois were not at all pleased with this, for they knew that the easy life they had been leading was soon to be brought to an end.  When the ammunition had all been removed into the new boat, the steamer Champion came alongside, and the Illinois was towed down to Columbus, where she was to undergo repairs, and her crew was transferred to the receiving-ship again.  The day after they arrived on board, while Frank and his cousin were seated on a coil of rope, as usual, talking over old times, and wondering how George and Harry Butler liked the army, and why they had not written, the boatswain's mate came along, and called out,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12808"],["title","Frank on a Gun-Boat (#6)"],["body"," in a loud voice:  \"Archie Winters!\"  \"Here I am,\" said Archie.  \"Well, go up on deck,\" said the mate; \"the captain wants to see you.\"  \"The captain wants to see me!\" repeated Archie, in surprise.  \"Yes; and you had better bear a hand, too, for the captain isn't the man to wait long when he sends after any one.\"  Archie accordingly went on deck, trying all the while to think what he had done that was wrong, and expecting a good blowing up for some unintentional offense. Perhaps the captain had by some means learned who it was that had made the descent on the cook's galley, and had called him up for the purpose of punishing him.  Finding the captain on deck, talking with the executive officer, he very politely remained out of hearing, holding his hat in his hand, and waited for a chance to speak to him. At length the captain inquired:  \"Hasn't Winters come up yet?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Archie, stepping up with his best salute.  \"Is this your writing?\" inquired the captain, holding out to Archie a letter addressed, in a splendid business hand, to James Winters, Esq., Boston.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Archie; \"that's a letter I wrote to my father.\"  \"Well,\" continued the captain, \"I have got a splendid position for you, as second clerk in the fleet paymaster's office. Would you like to take it?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Archie; \"but--but\"--  \"But what?\" inquired the captain.  \"I don't like to be separated from my cousin. We shipped together, and I should like to remain with him as long as possible.\"  \"Oh, as to that,\" said the captain, \"you can't expect to be together long; there is no certainty that you will be ordered to the same ship. You might as well separate one time as another. I think you had better accept this position.\"  \"I should like to speak with my cousin before I decide, sir.\"  \"Very well; look alive, and don't keep me waiting.\"  Archie touched his hat, and hurried below.  \"What did he want with you?\" inquired Frank, who was sitting with Simpson on their mess-chest.  Archie told his story, and ended by saying:  \"I don't believe I'll take it; for I don't want to leave you.\"  \"You're foolish,\" said Simpson; for, as the captain said, you can't expect to remain together a great while. To-morrow one of you may be ordered to a vessel in the Cumberland River, and the other to the lower fleet. Better take it; Frank can take care of himself.\"  \"Yes\" said Frank, \"I should certainly take it, if I were in your place. You'll be an officer then, you know.\"  \"Yes, I shall be an officer,\" said Archie, contemptuously; \"and if I meet one of you anywhere, I mustn't associate with you at all. No sir; I'll go and tell the captain I can't take it.\"  \"But, hold on a minute,\" said Frank, as his cousin was about to move away; \"perhaps you may find that there is another good place, and then you can recommend me.\"  \"That's so,\" said Archie; \"I did not think of that; I believe I'll take it;\" and he hurried on deck again.  \"Well, what conclusion have you come to?\" inquired the captain. \"Will you take it?\"  \"Yes, sir, with many thanks for your kindness.\"  \"What is your cousin's name?\"  Archie told him, and the captain continued:  \"I'll keep an eye open for him. I don't forget that I was young once myself; and I know that a sailor's life is rather tough for one who is not accustomed to it; and when I find a deserving young man, I like to help him along. Mr. Tyler,\" he continued, turning to the officer of the deck; \"please send this young man over to the fleet paymaster's office in the first boat that leaves the ship. You need not take your donnage,\" he said, turning to Archie again; \"if you suit the paymaster, you can come over for it at any time.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" answered Archie; and he went below again.  When the ten o'clock boat was called away, Archie, in obedience to the captain's order, was sent over to the paymaster's office; and Frank was left alone. He watched the boat until it reached the landing, and he saw his cousin spring out. He then walked aft, and seated himself on the mess-chest, and commenced writing a letter to his mother. While he was thus engaged, he heard the order passed, in a loud voice: \"All you men that belonged to the Illinois, muster on the forecastle with your bags and hammocks.\"  As Frank hastened to obey the order, he met Simpson, who exclaimed:  \"We're off again, my hearty; and I'm glad of it. I don't like to lay around here.\"  \"Where are we going?\" inquired Frank.  \"I don't know for certain; but I suspect we are to be the crew of the store-ship Milwaukee, now lying alongside the wharf-boat.\"  Simpson's surmise proved to be correct. The entire crew of the Illinois, with the exception of Archie, was mustered around the capstan; and after answering to their names, they were crowded into a cutter that lay alongside, and, in a few moments, were landed on board the Milwaukee.  She had steam up; her stores were on board, and she was all ready to sail; and the crew had scarcely time to stow away their bags and hammocks, when the order was passed: \"All hands stand by to get ship under way.\"  The gang-planks were quickly hauled in; the line with which she was made fast to the wharf-boat was cast off, and the Milwaukee was soon steaming down the river, and Cairo was rapidly receding from view.  The Milwaukee, which was now dignified by the name of \"store-ship,\" was an old river packet. She was loaded with clothing, provisions, and small stores, with which she was to supply the fleet. It was not, of course, intended that she should go into action; but, in order that she might be able to defend herself against the guerrillas, which infested the river between Cairo and Helena, she mounted a twelve-pound howitzer on her boiler-deck, and was well supplied with muskets. Her destination was Helena.  They reached that place without any adventure, and, after supplying the fleet with stores, started to return to Cairo. One pleasant afternoon, as they were passing through Cypress Bend, the officer of the deck discovered a man standing on the bank, waving a flag of truce. A bale of cotton lay near him; and the man, as soon as he found that he had attracted their attention, pointed to the cotton, and signified, by signs, that he wished it carried up the river.  The Milwaukee was immediately turned toward the shore, and as soon as they arrived within speaking distance, the captain called out:  \"What do you want?\"  \"I would like to have you take this cotton to Cairo for me,\" answered the man.  \"Are you a loyal citizen?\" asked the captain.  \"Yes, sir; and here is a permit from Admiral Porter to ship my cotton;\" and, as the man spoke, he held up a letter to the view of the captain.  \"Bring her into the bank, Mr. Smith,\" said the captain, addressing the pilot; \"and, Mr. O'Brien,\" he continued, in a lower tone, turning to an officer who stood near, \"go down and stand by that howitzer. Perhaps there is no treachery intended, but it is well to be on the safe side.\"  As soon as the Milwaukee touched the bank, Frank and Simpson, with two others, sprang ashore with a line, and, after making it fast to a tree, returned on board, and commenced pushing out a plank, so that the cotton could be easily rolled on, when, suddenly, several men rose from behind the levee, and the quick discharge of their rifles sent the bullets around those standing on the forecastle, like hailstones; and Simpson, who was standing directly in front of Frank, uttered a sharp cry of pain, and sank heavily to the deck. The next moment the guerrillas, with loud yells, sprang down the bank in a body, intending to board the boat and capture her. But they had not taken her so much by surprise as they had imagined, for a shell from the howitzer exploded in their very midst, and one of the rebels was killed, and three disabled. The others turned and hastily retreated behind the levee. Frank took advantage of this, and lifting the insensible form of his friend, retreated under cover, and laid him on a mattress behind a pile of coal, where he would be safe from the bullets of the guerrillas, which now began to come through the sides of the boat in every direction.  This was the first time Frank had ever been under fire, and he was thoroughly frightened; but he knew that it was his duty to resist the rebels, and to do them as much damage as possible; so, instead of looking round for a safe place to hide, his first impulse was to run up on deck after a gun. This he knew was a dangerous undertaking, for the vessel lay close to the bank, the top of which was on a level with the boiler-deck; and behind the levee, scarcely half a dozen rods distant, were the guerrillas, who were ready to shoot the first man that appeared.  Nevertheless, Frank resolved to make the attempt, for he wanted to take revenge on them for shooting Simpson. But, just as he was about to start out, he heard the captain shout down through the trumpet which ran from the pilot-house to the engine-room:  \"Back her, strong! We must get away from the bank or they will pick us all off.\"  In obedience to the order, the engineers let on the steam, and a heavy puffing told Frank that the powerful engines were doing their utmost to break the line which held them to the bank. Here was another thing that Frank knew he ought to do; he knew that he ought to cut that line, for it would be an impossibility to break it. There was an ax handy, and a sudden rush and a couple of lusty strokes would put the vessel out of danger. But, at short intervals, he heard the bullets crashing through the side of the boat, and he knew that the guerrillas were on the watch. If he made the attempt he could scarcely hope to come back alive; and he thought of his mother and Julia, how badly they would feel when they heard of his death. But even where he stood he was in danger of being struck by the bullets that were every moment coming through the vessel; and would not his mother much rather hear that he fell while performing his duty,"]]]
