As for Dalzell, he brought up the rear, grumbling:  \"All right; you fellows go on out and see whether you see him. If you don't, then I'm going to report myself at hospital without delay.  Really, I can't swear that I saw---it.\"  But at that moment the object of Dan's alarm reached one of the doors of the entrance of Bancroft Hall and stepped briskly inside.  This new-comer's glance fell upon the knot of midshipmen, and he glanced at them inquiringly, as though to see whether these young men intended to salute him.  Surely enough, the newcomer was decidedly boyish-looking, yet he wore the fatigue uniform and insignia of a lieutenant of the United States Navy.  If he were masquerading, here was a dangerous place into which to carry his antics.  The five midshipmen brought their right hands hesitatingly to the visors of their uniform caps.  The very youthful lieutenant smartly returned their salutes, half smiled, then turned, in search of the officer in charge.  \"Scoot!  Skip!  Let's escape!\" whispered Dan hoarsely, and all five midshipmen were speedily out in the open.  \"Now, did you fellows really see---it---or did I have a delusion that I saw you all salute when I did?\"  \"I saw it,\" rejoined Farley, \"and I claim it, if no one else wants it.\"  \"The service is going to the dogs,\" growled Page, \"when they give away a lieutenant's uniform with a pound of tea!\"  \"What ails you fellows?\" rebuked Dave Darrin.  \"The man who passed us was a sure-enough lieutenant in the Navy.\"  \"Him?\" demanded Midshipman Dalzell, startled out of his grip on English grammar.  \"A lieutenant?  That---that---kid?\"  \"He's a lieutenant of the Navy, all right,\" Dave insisted.  \"You're wrong,\" challenged Page.  \"Don't you know, Dave, that a man must be at least twenty-one years old in order to hold an officer's commission in the Navy?\"  \"That man who received our salutes is a Naval, officer,\" Dave retorted.  \"I don't know anything about his age.\"  \"Why, that little boy can't be a day over seventeen,\" gasped Dan Dalzell.  \"Anyway, fellows, I'm overjoyed that you all saw him! That takes a load off my mind as to my mental condition.\"  \"Whoever he is, he's a Navy officer, and he has trod the bridge in many a gale,\" contended Dave.  \"Small and young as he looks, that man had otherwise every bit of the proper appearance of a Navy officer.\"  \"What a joke it will be on you,\" grinned Page, \"when you find the watchman dragging the little fellow away to turn over to the doctors from the asylum!\"  The midshipmen were on their way to report for afternoon football work.  As they had started a few minutes early, and had time to spare, they had now halted on the way, and were standing on the sidewalk in front of the big and handsome barracks building.  \"Can you fellows still use your eyes?\" Dave wanted to know.  \"If you can, look toward the steps of Bancroft.\"  The officer in charge was coming out.  At his side was the very youthful looking one in the lieutenant's uniform.  \"The O.C. is decoying the stranger away to turn him over to the watchmen without violence,\" guessed Midshipman Farley.  Three officers were approaching.  These the five midshipmen turned and saluted.  In another moment all of the five save Dave Darrin received a sharp jolt.  For the O.C. had halted and was introducing the three Navy officers to the youthful one.  \"This is Lieutenant Benson, the submarine expert of whom you have heard so much,\" said the O.C., loudly enough for the amazed middies to hear.  \"Sub---sub----say, did you fellows hear that?\" begged Dan hoarsely.  \"Yes,\" assented Dave calmly.  \"And say, you fellows are a fine lot to be serving here.  You all remember Mr. Benson.  He was here last year---he and his two submarine friends.  We didn't see them, because our class didn't go out on the Pollard submarine boat that was here last year.  But you remember them, just the same.  You remember, too, that Mr. Benson and his friends were hazed by some of the men in last year's youngster class.  You heard about that?  A lot of the fellows came near getting ragged, but Benson didn't take offense, and his quick wit pulled that lot of last year's youngsters out of a bad fix.\"  \"Then Benson and his mates are real people?\" demanded Dan, still doubtful, if his voice were an indication.  \"Yes; and Benson is a real submarine expert, too, even if he is a boy,\" Dave went on.  \"Then he is only a boy?\"  \"He's seventeen or eighteen.\"  \"Then how can he be a lieutenant?\" demanded Dalzell, looking more bewildered.  \"He isn't,\" Dave answered simply.  \"But the O.C. introduced him that way.\"  \"And quite properly,\" answered Darrin, whereat his companions stared at him harder than ever.  \"Let's walk along,\" proposed Dave, \"and I'll tell you the little that I know, or think I know, about the matter.  Of course, you fellows all know about the Pollard submarine boats?  The government owns a few of them now, and is going to buy a lot more of the Pollard craft.\"  \"But that kid officer?\" insisted Dan.  \"If you'll wait I'll come to that.  Benson, his name is; Jack Benson he's commonly called.  He and two boy friends got in on the ground floor at the Farnum shipyard.  They were boys of considerable mechanical skill, and they found their forte in the handling of submarine boats.  They've done some clever, really wonderful feats with submarines.  Farnum, the owner of the yard, trusted these boys, after a while, to show off the fine points of the craft to our Navy officers and others.\"  \"But what has that to do with giving Benson a commission in the Navy?\" demanded Farley.  \"I'm coming to that,\" Dave replied.  \"As I've heard the yarn, Benson and his two boy friends attracted attention even from the European governments.  The Germans and some other powers even made them good offers to desert this country and go abroad as submarine experts.  Our Navy folks thought enough of Benson and his chums to want to save them for this country.  So the Secretary of the Navy offered all three the rank and command of officers without the actual commissions.  As soon as these young men, the Submarine Boys as they are called, are twenty-one, the Navy Department will bestir itself to give them actual commissions and make them real staff or line officers.\"  \"So that those kids will rank us in the service?\" grumbled Dan.  \"Well, up to date,\" replied Dave quietly, \"the Submarine Boys have done more for their country than we have.  Of course, in the end, we may be admirals in the Navy, even before they're captains. Who can tell?\"  \"I wonder what Benson is doing here?\" murmured Farley.  \"Lieutenant Benson,\" Dave corrected him, \"is probably here on official business.  If you want exact details, suppose we stop at the superintendent's house and ask him.\"  \"Quit your kidding,\" grinned Farley.  \"So I've got to say 'sir,' if that boy speaks to me?\" asked Dan.  \"I think it would be better,\" smiled Darrin, \"if you're anxious to escape another handful of demerits.\"  By the time that the football squad began to assemble on the football field, Dan and his friends found that some of the midshipmen were full of information about the famous Submarine Boys.  Readers who may not be familiar with the careers of Lieutenant Jack Benson, Ensign Hal Hastings, and Ensign Eph Somers are referred to the volumes of the _Submarine Boys' Series_.  In _\"The Submarine Boys and the Middies\"_ will be found the account of the hazing that Jack, Hal and Eph had received at the hands of midshipmen.  Benson and his two friends, with a crew of four men, were now at the Naval Academy, having arrived at two o'clock that afternoon, for the purpose of giving the first classmen instruction aboard the latest Pollard submarine, the \"Dodger.\"  But play was called, and that stopped, for the time being, all talk about the Submarine Boys.     CHAPTER VIII  THE PRIZE TRIP ON THE \"DODGER\"   The following afternoon, at the hour for instruction in the machine shops, the entire first class was marched down to the basin, where the \"Dodger\" lay.  Squad by squad the midshipmen were taken on board the odd-looking little craft that was more at home beneath the waves than on them.  While the exact place and scale of importance of submarine war craft has not been determined as yet, boats of the Pollard type are certainly destined to play a tremendously important part in the Naval wars of the future.  Hence all of the midshipmen were deeply interested in what they saw and were told.  Some of these first classmen were twenty-four years of age, others from twenty to twenty-two.  Hence, with many of them, there was some slight undercurrent of feeling over the necessity for taking instruction from such very youthful instructors as Jack Benson, Hal Hastings and Eph Somers.  Had any of this latter trio been inclined to put on airs there might have been some disagreeable feeling engendered in the breasts of some of the middies.  But Jack and his associates were wholly modest, pleasant and helpful.  Beginning on the following day, it was announced, the \"Dodger\" would take a squad of six midshipmen down Chesapeake Bay for practical instruction in submarine work, both above and below the surface of the water.  This instruction would continue daily, with squads of six midshipmen on board, until all members of the first class had received thorough drilling.  \"That's going to be a mighty pleasant change from the usual routine here,\" whispered Farley in Dave's ear.  \"It surely will,\" Darrin nodded.  \"It will be even better fun than football.\"  \"With no chance for the Army to beat us out on this game,\" Farley replied slyly.  At last it came the turn of Dave, Dan, Farley, Page, Jetson and Wolgast to go aboard the \"Dodger.\"  \"Gentlemen,\" announced Lieutenant Jack Benson, \"Ensign Somers will show you all that is possible about the deck handling and the steering below the surface, and then Ensign Hastings will explain the mechanical points of this craft.

Conclusion     CHAPTER I  READY FOR FIGHT OR FROLIC   \"Do you care to go out this evening, Danny boy?\" asked Dave Darrin, stepping into his chum's room.  \"I'm too excited and too tired,\" confessed Ensign Dalzell.  \"The first thing I want is a hot bath, the second, pajamas, and the third, a long sleep.\"  \"Too bad,\" sighed Dave.  \"I wanted an hour's stroll along Broadway.\"  \"Don't let my indolence keep you in,\" urged Dalzell.  \"If you're going out, then I can have the first hot bath, and be as long about it as I please.  Then I'll get into pajamas and ready for bed.  By that time you'll be in and we can say `good night' to each other.\"  \"I feel a bit mean about quitting you,\" Dave murmured.  \"And I feel a whole lot meaner not to go out with you,\" Dan promptly assured his chum.  \"So let's compromise; you go out and I'll stay in.\"  \"That sounds like a very odd compromise,\" laughed Darrin.  \"On the whole, Dan, I believe I won't go out.\"  \"If that's the way you feel,\" argued Dalzell, \"then I'm going to change my mind and go out with you.  I won't be the means of keeping you from your stroll.\"  \"But you really don't want to go out,\" Dave objected.  \"Candidly, I don't care much about going out; I want that bath and I'm tired.  Yet in the good old cause of friendship---\"  \"Friendship doesn't enter in, here,\" Dave interposed.  \"Danny boy, you stay here in the hotel and have your bath, I'll go out and pay my very slight respects to Broadway.  Doubtless, by the time you're in pajamas, I'll be back, and with all my longing for wandering satisfied.\"  \"Then, if you really don't mind---\"  \"Not at all, old chap!  So long!  Back in a little while.\"  Through the bathroom that connected their two rooms at the Allsordia Hotel, Dave Darrin stepped into his own apartment.  Having donned coat and top-coat, Darrin picked up his new derby hat and stepped to his room door.  In another half minute he was going down on the elevator.  Then he stepped into the street.  Dave Darrin was young, healthy, happy, reasonably good-looking. His top-coat and gray suit were well tailored.  Yet, save for his erect, military carriage, there was nothing to distinguish him from the thousands of average well-dressed young men who thronged Broadway after dark on this evening in late March.  For perhaps fifteen blocks he strolled uptown.  All that he saw on that gaily lighted main thoroughfare of New York was interesting. It was the same old evening crowd, on pleasure bent.  Then, crossing over to the east side of Broadway, Dave sauntered slowly back.  Laughing girls eyed the young naval officer as he passed.  Drivers of taxicabs looked the young man over speculatively, as though wondering whether he might be inveigled into going on a, to them, profitable round of New York's night sights.  Human harpies, in the form of \"confidence men\"---swindlers on the lookout for prey---glanced but once at the young naval ensign, then looked away. Dave Darrin's erect carriage, his clear steady eyes, his broad shoulders and evident physical mastery of himself made these swindlers hesitate at the thought of tackling him.  Through the occasionally opened doors of the restaurants came the sounds of music and laughter, but Dave felt no desire to enter.  He was several blocks on his homeward way, and was passing the corner of a side street quieter than the others, when he heard a woman's stifled cry of alarm.  Halting, bringing his heels together with a click, and throwing his shoulders back, Darrin stopped on the corner and looked down the street.  Five or six doors away, close to a building, stood a young woman of not more than twenty-two.  Though she was strikingly pretty, Dave did not note that fact in the first glance.  He saw, however, that she was well dressed in the latest spring garments, and that her pose was one of retreat from the man who stood before her.  That the man had the external appearance of the gentleman was the \\ first fact Darrin observed.  Then he heard the young woman's indignant utterance:  \"You coward!\"  \"That is a taunt not often thrown at me,\" the young man laughed, carelessly.  \"Only a coward would attempt to win a woman's love by threats,\" replied the girl, more calmly, though bitterness rang in her tone. \"As for you, I wish to assure you that I am quite through with you!\"  \"Oh, no, you're not!\" rejoined the annoyer, with the air of one who knows himself to be victor.  \"In fact, you will do very much as I wish, or your brother---\"  \"You coward!\" spoke the girl, scornfully again.  \"If your brother suffers, your pride will be in the dust,\" insisted the annoyer, \"and, remember, I, alone, can save your brother from disgrace.\"  \"I am not even going to ask you to do it,\" retorted the young woman.  \"And now our interview is over.  I am going to leave you, and I shall not see you again.  I-----\"  \"Going to leave me, are you?\" leered her tormentor.  He stepped forward, holding out his hand, as though to seize the young woman's wrist, but she alertly eluded him.  \"If you try again to touch me, or if you attempt to follow me,\" warned the young woman, \"I shall appeal for assistance.\"  So absorbed were the disputants in their quarrel that neither had noticed Darrin, standing on the corner.  The tormentor's face flushed, then went white, \"Make your appeal,\" he dared, \"and see what happens!\"  Again he attempted to take the girl by the wrist.  \"Can I be of service, madam?\" inquired Darrin, as he strode toward them.  Like a flash, the annoyer wheeled upon Darrin, his eyes flashing dangerously.  \"Young man,\" he warned, threateningly, \"the best thing you can possibly do will be to make yourself scarce as quickly as possible. As for this young woman-----\"  The tormentor moved a step nearer to the young woman, whose face had turned very pale.  Dave slipped quietly between them.  \"As this young woman does not wish to talk with you,\" Darrin suggested, \"you may address all your remarks to me.\"  While the two young men stood eyeing each other Darrin noted that the young woman's annoyer was somewhat taller than himself, broader of shoulder and deeper of chest.  He had the same confidence of athletic poise that Dave himself displayed.  In a resort to force, it looked as though the stranger would have the better of it.  Yet this stranger seemed suddenly deprived of much of his assurance. Plainly, there was some good reason why he did not wish to fight on this side street so close to Broadway.  \"Madam,\" inquired Darrin, half turning, \"may I have the pleasure of escorting you to your friends?\"  \"If you will call a taxi-----\" she began, eagerly.  At that moment a fareless taxicab turned the corner of Broadway and came slowly down the street.  \"Hold on, chauffeur!\" cried Darrin, in a voice of command.  Then, as the cab stopped at the curb, Dave turned his back upon the tormentor for a moment, while he assisted the young woman into the taxicab.  \"Do you feel satisfied to go without escort,\" asked Darrin, \"or may I offer my services in seeing you safely to your home?\"  \"I shall be all right now,\" replied the young woman, the troubled look in her lustrous brown eyes vanishing as she favored her unknown defender with a smile.  \"If the driver will stop, two blocks from here, I will direct him where to take me.\"  \"Step aside, boy!\" ordered the unknown man, as he tried to brush Dave away and enter the cab.  It was no time for gentle measures.  Ensign Darrin's right fist landed heavily on the face of the stranger, sending him prone to the sidewalk.  At a wave of Dave's hand the chauffeur started away.  Scenting trouble, the chauffeur drove as fast as he could down the side street, making the round of the block, then heading into Broadway and going uptown, for the young woman had called out her destination.  As for the stranger whom Dave had knocked down, the fellow was on his feet like a flash.  Ignoring Darrin, he tried to dash down the side street after the taxicab.  \"Step back!\" ordered Dave, catching hold of the fellow, and swinging him around.  \"You're not going to follow.\"  \"I must have the number of that taxicab,\" cried the stranger, desperately.  \"Too late,\" smiled Dave, as he saw the taxicab turn the next corner. \"You won't learn the number.  I happened to see it, though,\" he added incautiously.  \"Give it to me, then,\" commanded the other.  \"I'll overlook what you've done if you truthfully give me the number of that taxicab. Find that girl I must, and as early as possible.  Though I know her well, and her family, too, I do not know where to look for them in New York.\"  Dave, without a word, turned as though to walk toward Broadway.  \"Give me that taxi's number,\" insisted the stranger.  \"I won't,\" Dave returned, flatly.  \"Give me that number, or-----\"  \"Or what?\" drawled Darrin halting and glancing contemptuously at the furious face before him.  \"Or I'll pound the number out of you!\" came the ugly challenge.  \"Go ahead,\" Dave invited, coolly.  \"I don't mind a fight in the least, though perhaps you would, for I see a policeman coming up the street.  He would be bound to arrest both of us.  Perhaps you have better reasons"]]]
