This book is dedicated to  Gifford Pinchot  sometime forester for the United States of America, and now Commissioner of Forestry for Pennsylvania, whose ceaseless and undiscouraged efforts to save from spoliation the vast timber stands and other natural resources of America have inspired this story     Foreword    Boys and dogs go well together. So do boys and trees. When a boy gets to love the forest and can live in it, that is best of all. For the forest makes real boys and real men.  Not only does the forest do that, but it keeps the Nation alive. No one can eat a meal without the help of the forest, for it takes more than half the wood cut every year in the United States to enable the farmer to grow the food and the fibres to feed and clothe the Nation. No one can live in a house without the help of the forest, for whether we speak of it as a wooden house, a brick house, a stone house, or a concrete house, still there is wood in it, and without wood it could not have been built.  We are apt to think of the city dwellers as people who are not dependent on the forest. As a matter of fact, they are the most dependent of all, for the cities would be deserted, the houses empty, and the streets dead, except for the things which could not be grown nor mined nor manufactured nor transported without the help of wood from the forest.  Pennsylvania--Penn's Woods--is the greatest industrial commonwealth in the world. Without its woods, it could never have been made so. Unless its woods are restored, it cannot continue to be so, and unless forest fires are stopped, there is no way to restore Penn's Woods.  I have read \"The Young Wireless Operator--As a Fire Patrol\" with the keenest interest, not only because it is about the forest, but because it is a thrillingly interesting story of a real boy and the real things he did in the woods. I like it from end to end, and that is why, when Mr. Theiss asked me to write this foreword, I gladly consented.  No one loves the woods more than I, as boy and man, or loves to be in them better. One of the things I want most is to see more and better forests in our great State of Pennsylvania, and in the whole United States. Without our forests we could not have become great, nor can we continue to be so. For the men and boys who love the forest and understand it are of the kind without whom great nations are impossible.  Gifford Pinchot.     Contents         I. Vacation Plans     II.

Victory     The Young Wireless Operator--As a Fire Patrol     Chapter I  Vacation Plans    Charley Russell sat before a table in the workshop in his father's back yard. In front of him were the shining instruments of his wireless outfit--his coupler, his condenser, his helix, his spark-gap, and the other parts, practically all of which he had made with his own hands. Ordinarily he would have looked at them fondly, but now he gave them hardly a thought. He was waiting for his chum, Lew Heinsling, and his mind was busy with the problem of his own future. Charley was a senior in high school and was pondering over the question of what the world had in store for him. While he sat meditating, Lew arrived. In his hand was a copy of the <i>New York Sun and Herald</i>. He held it out to Charley and pointed to the marine news.  \"The <i>Lycoming</i> reaches New York to-day,\" he said. \"Roy will send us a wireless message to-night. Gee! I wish we had a battery strong enough to talk back.\"  But Charley paid slight heed to the suggestion. Instead he said: \"Roy Mercer's a lucky dog. Think of being the wireless man on a big ocean steamer when you're only nineteen. I wish I knew what I am going to do after I graduate from high school.\"  Roy Mercer, like Charley and Lew, was a member of the Camp Brady Wireless Patrol. With his fellows he had taken part in the capture of the German spies who were trying to dynamite the Elk City reservoir and so wreck a great munitions centre during the war; and with three other members of the Wireless Patrol, especially selected for their skill in wireless, he had later gone to New York with their leader, Captain Hardy, to assist the government Secret Service in its search for the secret wireless that was keeping the German Admiralty informed of the movements of American vessels.  His fellows both envied and loved him. Roy warmly returned their affection, and his vessel never came into port that he did not, regularly at nine o'clock in the evening, flash out some message of greeting to his former comrades of the Wireless Patrol. It was always a one-sided conversation, however, because none of the boys in the Wireless Patrol owned a battery powerful enough to carry a message from Central City to New York. Just now each lad was engaged in trying to earn money so that the club could buy a battery or dynamo strong enough for this purpose. So each boy was working at any job he could pick up after school, and saving all he earned. Both Charley and Lew had already earned more than their share of the purchase money.  \"You never can tell what will happen,\" said Lew presently. \"Who ever expected Roy to get the job he has? You may land in another just as good. You stand pretty near the head of your class, and everybody knows you're a corking good wireless operator.\"  \"I can tell well enough what will happen, Lew. The minute I'm out of high school, I'll have to go to work with Dad in Miller's factory. Gee! How I hate the place! Think of working nine hours a day in such a dirty, smoky, noisy old hole, where you can't get a breath of fresh air, or see the sky, or hear the birds. Just to think about it is enough to make a fellow feel blue.\"  \"But maybe you won't have to go into the factory at all,\" argued Lew. \"Maybe you can find some other job you like better.\"  \"No, I shall have to go into the factory,\" repeated Charley sadly. \"Dad says I've got to get to work the minute I've graduated, and earn the most money possible. And there's no other place where I can get as much as they pay at Miller's. Dad says I can get two-fifty a day at the start and maybe three dollars.\"  Charley paused and sighed, then added, \"What's three dollars a day if you have to be penned up like an animal to earn it? I'd rather take half as much if I could work out in the open and do something I like.\"  \"Why don't you tell your father so?\"  \"I have--dozens of times. But he says it isn't a question of what I want to do. It's a question of making the most money possible and helping him. He says he's supported me for more than eighteen years and now I have to help him for a year or two anyway.\"  \"That's a shame!\" cried Lew.  \"No, it isn't, Lew,\" explained Charley. \"It's all right about helping Dad. He's been mighty good to me, and he's in the hole now. You see, Dad and Mother have been married twenty years and Dad's worked hard all this time and saved his money to build a house. And just about the time Dad was ready to begin building, prices began to go up. Dad held off, thinking they would drop. But they got higher instead, and finally Dad told the carpenters to go ahead, lest prices should go higher still. Now the house is going to cost almost double what Dad expected it would, and the awful prices of everything else take every cent Dad can earn. With such a big mortgage on the place, Dad says he's just got to have my help or he may lose the house and all he has saved in those twenty years. It's all right about helping Dad, Lew. I want to do that, but I can't bear to think of going to work in that factory.\"  \"It's too bad, Charley. I had hoped so much that we could go to college together.\"  \"Lew, if I could go to college I'd work my head off to do it. You know that. If only I could go to college and learn about the birds and flowers and rocks and trees and animals, I'd be willing to do anything--even to work in Miller's factory for a time. But Dad will need every cent I can earn until I am twenty-one, and I can't see how I can possibly go to college.\"  \"Never mind, Charley. You never can tell what will happen. Look at Roy. He was worse off than you are, for his father died suddenly and Roy had to care for both himself and his mother. And see what came of it. He isn't much older than we are, yet he's got a fine job. Just keep your eyes open and you may pick up something, too.\"  \"It'll have to come quick, then,\" sighed Charley. \"Here it is almost Easter vacation, and I am to graduate in June. This will probably be the last vacation I shall have in a long time.\"  \"Then let's enjoy this vacation. I've been thinking what we could do, and it occurred to me that it would be lots of fun for the Wireless Patrol to make a trip up the river to that old camp of ours. It won't be too cold to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12839"],["title","The Young Wireless Operator—As a Fire Patrol (#1)"],["body","out if we take out our tents and our little collapsible stoves. Suckers ought to be running good and we can catch a fine mess of fish, take a hike or two, and have a bully trip up the river and back. Let's go tell the rest of the fellows.\"  Lew jumped up and started for the door. Then he stopped suddenly and a look of disappointment came over his face. \"I'll bet none of 'em can go,\" he said. \"They've all got jobs for the vacation. I'm glad we've got our money earned.\"  \"I just thought of another difficulty,\" sighed Charley. \"Not one of us owns a boat.\"  \"We can borrow one,\" said Lew.  \"I hate to borrow things,\" replied Charley. \"You remember how I borrowed old man Packer's bob-sled and broke it and then had to pay to have it remade. No more borrowing for me.\"  \"Why can't we make a boat? There's plenty of time between now and vacation. If we do the work ourselves, it oughtn't to cost more than two or three dollars and then we'd have a boat of our own.\"  \"Bully!\" cried Charley. \"We can make it as good as anybody. We'll do it.\"  \"All right. I'll go down-town and find the price of oars and rowlocks, and you go over to Hank Cooley's and find out how his father made that boat of his. It's a dandy and just what we need.\"  The two boys rushed off in opposite directions, each full of enthusiasm over the plan to build a new boat and make a trip up the river during their Easter vacation.     Chapter II  What Came of Them    A few hours later Charley Russell again sat before the bench in the little wireless house in his father's yard. Before him lay some patterns for a rowboat, and on a piece of paper Charley was trying to figure out how much lumber it would take to build the boat.  \"We'll need two sixteen-foot boards, each a foot wide for the sides,\" he said, looking across the table at his chum, who sat ready, with pencil and paper, to jot down the figures Charley gave him.  \"Thirty-two feet,\" said Lew, setting down the number on his paper.  Charley bent over his patterns, measuring and estimating in silence. \"It'll take three more like 'em for the bottom,\" he said presently.  \"That's forty-eight more,\" replied Lew, jotting down the number.  \"And these cross braces,\" added Charley, after another period of calculation, \"will take ten feet more.\"  Again Lew set down the number.  \"That provides for everything but the decks,\" said Charley. \"They will take seven or eight feet more. Better call it ten. That's all. What does it make?\"  Lew put down ten and added the column of figures. \"One hundred feet exactly,\" he said.  \"Bully good!\" replied Charley. \"A hundred feet oughtn't to cost much of anything. The rub's going to be to get the oars. You say they want five dollars for the cheapest pair at the hardware store, and the sporting goods store wants six-fifty.\"  \"The robbers!\" cried Lew. \"Think of it. Six-fifty for about fifteen cents' worth of wood. Maybe we can get a pair of second-hand oars somewhere. Six-fifty is as much as we can afford to spend on the whole outfit.\"  \"It will be all right to get second-hand oars,\" said Charley, \"for we can get new ones later, when we have the money. Besides, we want to put most of our money into the boat itself. As long as we are going to build it, we want to make it the very best boat possible. We want the best wood in the market and we want our boat light enough so that the two of us can carry it. I reckon it may cost two or three dollars if we buy such good wood as that. But it will be worth while. We can get along with cheap oars for a time. Let's go down to the lumber-yard and get our boards.\"  The two chums left the shop and hurried down the street toward the lumber-yard.  \"If we can get our lumber to-day,\" said Charley, \"I'm certain we can get our boat made before the spring vacation. We ought to be able to put in three hours apiece every afternoon after high school lets out, and we can get in another hour apiece before school, if we get up early enough. That's four hours apiece, or eight hours a day. We certainly ought to get it finished and painted inside of ten days.\"  \"Sure,\" replied Lew. \"We'll have her done all right. And we'll have just about the finest boat in town.\"  \"And I reckon we'll have just about the finest trip ever,\" went on Charley. \"If we start right after school closes for the Easter vacation we can row up-stream that afternoon as far as Hillman's Grove, and camp there for the night. That will give us almost half a day's extra time. Then we can reach our old camping ground the next day and get the tent up and our wood cut and maybe even catch some fish before dark. We'll have everything ready so we can jump right into the boat and pull out the minute school is over.\"  \"Sure,\" assented Lew. Then, after a moment's pause, he added, \"Ain't it a shame none of the other members of the Wireless Patrol can go along? We'll miss 'em, particularly Roy. And now that he's wireless man on the <i>Lycoming</i>, he'll probably never go on another trip with the Camp Brady Patrol.\"  \"It's too bad for us, but mighty nice for Roy,\" said Charley. \"Just think of being the wireless man on a great ocean steamship when you're only nineteen. He's made for life. Gee! I wish I knew what I am going to do.\"  \"I know how you feel, Charley. Maybe something will turn up so that you won't need to go into the factory after all. But here we are at the lumber-yard. Let's get the boards and begin our boat at once. We'll have a good time this vacation, no matter what happens afterward.\"  \"Well, boys, what can I do for you?\" inquired the lumber dealer, as Charley and Lew approached him.  \"We want one hundred feet of the lightest and best boards you have,\" replied Charley. \"We are going to build a boat and we want it to be strong but light, so that the two of us can handle it.\"  \"White pine would be just the thing for you,\" replied the dealer, \"but I haven't a foot of it in the place and can't get any. I have some fine cedar boards that would make a good light boat. Just come over to this pile of lumber.\" And he led the way across the yard.  \"That will suit us all right if it's wide enough,\" said Charley. \"We want foot boards.\"  \"Well, that's what these are. And a good inch thick, too. They're mighty good boards. Hardly a knot in 'em. We don't see much lumber like that nowadays.\"  \"They'll do all right,\" assented Charley, after examining the boards. \"What do they cost a hundred?\"  \"Ten dollars.\"  \"Ten dollars!\" cried Charley in consternation. Then a smile came on his face. \"Quit your kidding,\" he said. \"What <i>do</i> they come at?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the lumber dealer soberly.  The two boys stared at him incredulously.  \"Impossible!\" cried Lew. \"What are they <i>really</i> worth?\"  \"Ten dollars,\" replied the man. His voice was sharp and a frown had gathered on his forehead. \"Ten dollars, and cheap at that.\"  Charley turned to his companion with a look of dismay. \"We can never build our boat with wood at such a price,\" he cried. \"With five dollars to pay for oars, and two dollars for paint, and some more for nails and rowlocks, and lock and chain, the boat would cost eighteen or twenty dollars just for the materials. That's three times as much as we have got.\"  After an instant the look on Charley's face changed to one of intense indignation. He had a quick temper, and now he turned to the lumber dealer in anger.  \"I guess the sugar profiteers are not the only ones who ought to be in the penitentiary,\" he said hotly. \"You can keep your old boards. And I hope they rot for you.\"  Then he turned on his heel and started toward the gate, followed by Lew.  \"Come back here!\"  The words rang out sharp and sudden. The voice was commanding and compelling. Involuntarily the two boys turned back. The lumber dealer stood before them, his face ablaze with indignation. Under his fiery glances the boys were speechless. For a moment the man said nothing. Evidently he was struggling with his temper. When he had gotten control of himself he spoke. His voice was deep and low, but harsh and cutting.  \"Before you make a fool of yourself again, young man,\" he said, speaking directly to Charley, \"you had better know what you are talking about. You called me a profiteer for asking $100 a thousand feet for those cedar boards. Young man, those boards cost me $90 a thousand in the cars at the station. That leaves me a margin of $10 a thousand for handling them. Out of that I have to pay to have the boards hauled from the station, pay for insurance on them, pay their proportionate share of overhead expense, and pay for hauling them to customers. How much of that $10 do you think is left for profit? So little it almost requires a microscope to see it. I have to handle a good many hundred feet of lumber to make as much as the cheapest sort of laborer gets for a day's pay. The fact is, young man, that far from profiteering on that lumber, I am selling it at a smaller profit than I ever sold any lumber before in my life. Some lumber I am handling at a loss. But in these critical days, with factories closing everywhere, and men by the thousands being thrown out of work, the best thing a man can do, either for himself or for his country, is to keep business moving. That's why I am selling lumber without profit.\"  Charley was suddenly abashed. \"I'm awfully sorry I called you a profiteer,\" he said humbly. \"I beg your pardon.\"  \"It's all right, young man,\" said the lumber dealer, a smile once more lighting up his face. \"You are too young to understand how critical the business situation really is. But be careful in future how you call people names.\"  \"I certainly will,\" agreed Charley. \"But I'd like to know this. Who <i>is</i> profiteering in lumber? Who is responsible for such terrible prices?\"  \"Well, there <i>has</i> been profiteering in lumber, as in everything else. But there is a real reason why the price of lumber is so high, and that is the scarcity of timber.\"  \"Scarcity!\" cried Charley incredulously. \"Why, the forests"]]]
