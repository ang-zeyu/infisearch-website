AINSWORTH, WILLIAM HARRISON (1805-1882).--Novelist, _s._ of a solicitor, was _b._ in Manchester. He was destined for the legal profession, which, however, had no attraction for him; and going to London to complete his studies made the acquaintance of Mr. John Ebers, publisher, and at that time manager of the Opera House, by whom he was introduced to literary and dramatic circles, and whose _dau._ he afterwards married. For a short time he tried the publishing business, but soon gave it up and devoted himself to journalism and literature. His first successful novel was _Rookwood_, _pub._ in 1834, of which Dick Turpin is the leading character, and thenceforward he continued to pour forth till 1881 a stream of novels, to the number of 39, of which the best known are _The Tower of London_ (1840), _Old St. Paul's_ (1841), _Lancashire Witches_, and _The Constable of the Tower_. The titles of some of his other novels are _Crichton_ (1837), _Jack Sheppard_ (1839), _Guy Fawkes_, _The Star Chamber_, _The Flitch of Bacon_, _The Miser's Daughter_ (1842), and _Windsor Castle_ (1843). A. depends for his effects on striking situations and powerful descriptions: he has little humour or power of delineating character.   AIRD, THOMAS (1802-1876).--Poet, _b._ at Bowden, Roxburghshire, went to Edinburgh, where he became the friend of Professor Wilson, Carlyle, and other men of letters. He contributed to _Blackwood's Magazine_, and was editor of the _Dumfries Herald_ (1835-63). His chief poem is _The Captive of Fez_ (1830); and in prose he wrote _Religious Characteristics_, and _The Old Bachelor in the Old Scottish Village_ (1848), all of which were received with favour. Carlyle said that in his poetry he found everywhere \"a healthy breath as of mountain breezes.\"   AKENSIDE, MARK (1721-1770).--Poet, _s._ of a butcher at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, gave early indications of talent, and was sent to the University of Edinburgh with the view of becoming a dissenting minister. While there, however, he changed his mind and studied for the medical profession. Thereafter he went to Leyden, where he took his degree of M.D. in 1744. While there he wrote his principal poem, _The Pleasures of the Imagination_, which was well received, and was subsequently translated into more than one foreign language. After trying Northampton, he settled as a physician in London; but was for long largely dependent for his livelihood on a Mr. Dyson. His talents brought him a good deal of consideration in society, but the solemn and pompous manner which he affected laid him open to some ridicule, and he is said to have been satirised by Smollett (_q.v._) in his _Peregrine Pickle_. He endeavoured to reconstruct his poem, but the result was a failure. His collected poems were _pub._ 1772. His works, however, are now little read. Mr. Gosse has described him as \"a sort of frozen Keats.\"   ALCOTT, LOUISA M. (1832-1888).--Writer of juvenile and other tales, _dau._ of Amos Bronson Alcott, an educational and social theorist, lecturer, and author, was _b._ in Pennsylvania. During the American civil war she served as a nurse, and afterwards attained celebrity as a writer of books for young people, of which the best is _Little Women_ (1868). Others are _Little Men_ and _Jo's Boys_. She also wrote novels, including _Moods_ and _Work_.   ALCUIN or EALHWINE (735-804).--Theologian and general writer, was _b._ and _ed._ at York. He wrote in prose and verse, his subjects embracing educational, theological, and historical matters. Returning from Rome, to which he had been sent to procure the _pallium_ for a friend, he met Charlemagne at Parma, and made upon him so favourable an impression that he was asked to enter his service as preceptor in the sciences to himself and his family. His numerous treatises, which include metrical annals, hagiographical and philosophical works, are not distinguished by originality or profundity, but he is the best representative of the culture and mental activity of his age, upon which, as the minister of education of the great emperor, he had a widely-spread influence.   ALDRICH, THOMAS BAILEY (1836-1906).--Poet and novelist, _b._ at Portsmouth, N.H., was for some time in a bank, and then engaged in journalism. His first book was _The Bells, a Collection of Chimes_ (1855), and other poetical works are _The Ballad of Babie Bell_, _Cloth of Gold_, _Flower and Thorn_, etc. In prose he wrote _Daisy's Necklace_, _The Course of True Love_, _Marjorie Daw_, _Prudence Palfrey_, etc.   ALESIUS, ALEXANDER (1500-1565).--Theologian and controversialist. His unlatinised name was Aless or Alane, and he was _b._ at Edinburgh and _ed._ at St. Andrews, where he became a canon. Originally a strong and able defender of the Romish doctrines, he was chosen to argue with Patrick Hamilton, the proto-martyr of the Reformation in Scotland, with the object of inducing him to recant. The result, however, was that he was himself much shaken in his allegiance to the Church, and the change was greatly accelerated by the martyrdom of H. His subsequent protest against the immorality of the clergy led to his imprisonment, and ultimately, in 1532, to his flying for his life to Germany, where he became associated with Luther and Melancthon, and definitely joined the reforming party. Coming to England in 1535, he was well received by Cranmer and other reformers. While in England he studied medicine, and practised as a physician in London. On the fall of T. Cromwell in 1540 he again retired to Germany, where, at Leipzig, he obtained a professorship. During the reign of Edward VI. he re-visited England and was employed by Cranmer in connection with the 1st Liturgy of Edward VI. Returning to Leipsic he passed the remainder of his days in peace and honour, and was twice elected Rector of the University. His writings were both exegetical and controversial, but chiefly the latter. They include _Expositio Libri Psalmorum Davidis_ (1550). His controversial works refer to such subjects as the translation of the Bible into the vernacular, against Servetus, etc.   ALEXANDER, MRS. CECIL F. (HUMPHREYS) (1818-1895).--_dau._ of Maj. H., _b._ in Co. Waterford, _m._ the Rev. W. Alexander, afterwards Bishop of Derry and Archbishop of Armagh. Her _Hymns for Little Children_ had reached its 69th edition before the close of the century. Some of her hymns, _e.g._ \"There is a Green Hill\" and \"The Roseate Hues of Early Dawn,\" are known wherever English is spoken. Her husband has also written several books of poetry, of which the most important is _St. Augustine's Holiday and other Poems_.   ALFORD, HENRY (1810-1871).--Theologian, scholar, poet, and miscellaneous writer, _s._ of a clergyman, was _b._ in London. After passing through various private schools, he proceeded to Cambridge, where he had a distinguished career, and after entering the Church and filling various preferments in the country, became minister of Quebec Chapel, London, whence he was promoted to be Dean of Canterbury. His great work was his _Greek Testament_ in 4 vols., of which the first was _pub._ in 1849 and the last in 1861. In this work he largely followed the German critics, maintaining, however, a moderate liberal position; and it was for long the standard work on the subject in this country. A. was one of the most versatile men, and prolific authors, of his day, his works consisting of nearly 50 vols., including poetry (_School of the Heart_ and _Abbot of Munchelnaye_, and a translation of the _Odyssey_), criticism, sermons, etc. In addition to the works above mentioned he wrote _Chapters on the Greek Poets_ (1841), the _Queen's English_ (1863), and many well-known hymns, and he was the first editor of the _Contemporary Review_. He was also an accomplished artist and musician. His industry was incessant and induced a premature breakdown in health, which terminated in his death in 1871. He was the friend of most of his eminent contemporaries, and was much beloved for his amiable character.   ALISON, ARCHIBALD (1757-1839).--Didactic and philosophical writer, was _b._ in Edinburgh and _ed._ at Glasgow University and Oxford. After being presented to various livings in England, A. came to Edinburgh as incumbent of St. Paul's Episcopal Chapel, where he attained popularity as a preacher of sermons characterised by quiet beauty of thought and grace of composition. His chief contribution to literature is his _Essay on the Nature and Principles of Taste_ (1790), in which the \"association\" theory is supported.   ALISON, SIR ARCHIBALD (1792-1867).--Historian, _s._ of the above, was _b._ at Kenley, Shropshire, and after studying under a private tutor, and at Edinburgh University, was, in 1814, called to the Bar, at which he ultimately attained some distinction, becoming in 1834 Sheriff of Lanarkshire, in which capacity he rendered valuable service in times of considerable difficulty. It was when travelling in France in 1814 that he conceived the idea of his _History of Europe_, which deals with the period from the outbreak of the French Revolution to the restoration of the Bourbons, and extends, in its original form (1833-42), to 10 vols. The work is one of vast industry, and gives a useful account of an important epoch, but is extremely diffuse and one-sided, and often prosy. Disraeli satirises the author in _Coningsby_ as Mr. Wordy, who wrote a history to prove that Providence was on the side of the Tories. It had, however, an enormous sale. A continuation of it (1852-59) brought the story down to the accession of Louis Napoleon. A. was also the author of a life of Marlborough, and of two standard works on the criminal law of Scotland. In his private and official capacities he was highly respected, and was elected Lord Rector successively of Marischal Coll., Aberdeen, and of Glasgow University. He was created a baronet by Lord Derby in 1852.   ALLEN, CHARLES GRANT (1848-1899).--Scientific writer and novelist, _b."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],["title","A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#3)"],["body","in Canada, to which his _f._, a clergyman, had emigrated, and _ed._ at Birmingham and Oxford. For a time he was a professor in a college for negroes in Jamaica, but returning to England in 1876 devoted himself to literature. His first books were on scientific subjects, and include _Physiological Æsthetics_ (1877) and _Flowers and Their Pedigrees_. After assisting Sir W.W. Hunter in his _Gazeteer of India_, he turned his attention to fiction, and between 1884 and 1899 produced about 30 novels, among which _The Woman Who Did_ (1895), promulgating certain startling views on marriage and kindred questions, created some sensation. Another work, _The Evolution of the Idea of God_, propounding a theory of religion on heterodox lines, has the disadvantage of endeavouring to explain everything by one theory. His scientific works also included _Colour Sense_, _Evolutionist at Large_, _Colin Clout's Calendar_, and the _Story of the Plants_, and among his novels may be added _Babylon_, _In all Shades_, _Philistia_ (1884), _The Devil's Die_, and _The British Barbarians_ (1896).   ALLINGHAM, WILLIAM (1824-1889).--Poet, the _s._ of a banker of English descent, was _b._ at Ballyshannon, entered the customs service, and was ultimately settled in London, where he contributed to _Leigh Hunt's Journal_. Hunt introduced him to Carlyle and other men of letters, and in 1850 he _pub._ a book of poems, which was followed by _Day and Night Songs_ (1854), _Laurence Bloomfield in Ireland_ (1864) (his most ambitious, though not his most successful work), and _Collected Poems_ in 6 vols. (1888-93). He also edited _The Ballad Book_ for the _Golden Treasury_ series in 1864. In 1870 he retired from the civil service and became sub-editor of _Fraser's Magazine_ under Froude, whom he succeeded as editor (1874-79). His verse is clear, fresh, and graceful. He married Helen Paterson, the water colourist, whose idylls have made the name of \"Mrs. Allingham\" famous also. He _d._ in 1889. Other works are _Fifty Modern Poems_ (1865), _Songs, Poems, and Ballads_ (1877), _Evil May Day_ (1883), _Blackberries_ (1884), _Irish Songs and Poems_ (1887), and _Varieties in Prose_ (1893). A selection from his diaries and autobiography was _pub._ in 1906.   ALLSTON, WASHINGTON (1779-1843).--Painter and poet, _b._ in S. Carolina, became a distinguished painter, and also wrote a good deal of verse including _The Sylphs of the Seasons_, etc. (1813), and _The Two Painters_, a satire. He also produced a novel, _Monaldi_. He was known as \"the American Titian.\"   AMORY, THOMAS (1691(?)-1788).--Eccentric writer, was of Irish descent. In 1755 he _publ._ _Memoirs containing the lives of several ladies of Great Britain, a History of Antiquities and Observations on the Christian Religion_, which was followed by the _Life of John Buncle_ (1756), practically a continuation. The contents of these works are of the most miscellaneous description--philology, natural science, theology, and, in fact, whatever occurred to the writer, treated without any system, but with occasional originality and felicity of diction. The author, who was probably more or less insane, is described as having a very peculiar aspect, with the manner of a gentleman, scarcely ever stirring abroad except at dusk. He reached the age of 97.   ANDERSON, ALEXANDER (1845-1909).--Poet, _s._ of a quarrier at Kirkconnel, Dumfriesshire, became a surfaceman on the railway. Spending all his leisure in self-culture, he mastered German, French, and Spanish sufficiently to read the chief masterpieces in these languages. His poetic vein, which was true if somewhat limited in range, soon manifested itself, and his first book, _Songs of Labour_, appeared in 1873, and there followed _Two Angels_ (1875), _Songs of the Rail_ (1878), and _Ballads and Sonnets_ (1879). In the following year he was made assistant librarian in the University of Edinburgh, and after an interval as secretary to the Philosophical Institution there, he returned as Chief Librarian to the university. Thereafter he wrote little. Of a simple and gentle character, he made many friends, including the Duke of Argyll, Carlyle, and Lord Houghton. He generally wrote under the name of \"Surfaceman.\"   ANDREWES, LANCELOT (1555-1626).--Churchman and scholar, was _b._ in London, and _ed._ at Merchant Taylor's School and Cambridge, where he took a fellowship and taught divinity. After receiving various other preferments he became Dean of Westminster, and a chaplain-in-ordinary to Queen Elizabeth, who, however, did not advance him further on account of his opposition to the alienation of ecclesiastical revenues. On the accession, however, of James I., to whom his somewhat pedantic learning and style of preaching recommended him, he rose into great favour, and was made successively Bishop of Chichester, of Ely, and, in 1618, of Winchester. He attended the Hampton Court Conference, and took part in the translation of the Bible, known as the _Authorised Version_, his special work being given to the earlier parts of the Old Testament: he acted, however, as a sort of general editor. He was considered as, next to Ussher, the most learned churchman of his day, and enjoyed a great reputation as an eloquent and impassioned preacher, but the stiffness and artificiality of his style render his sermons unsuited to modern taste. His doctrine was High Church, and in his life he was humble, pious, and charitable. Ninety-six of his sermons were published in 1631 by command of Charles I.  There are lives by A.T. Russell (1863), and R.L. Ottley (1894); _Devotions_ were edited by Rev. Dr. Whyte (1900).   ANSTEY, CHRISTOPHER (1724-1805).--Poet, _s._ of Dr. A., a wealthy clergyman, rector of Brinkley, Cambridgeshire, was _ed._ at Eton and Cambridge. He _pub._ in 1766 a satirical poem of considerable sparkle, _The New Bath Guide_, from which Smollett is said to have drawn largely in his _Humphrey Clinker_. He made many other excursions into literature which are hardly remembered, and ended his days as a country squire at the age of eighty.   D'ARBLAY, FRANCES (BURNEY) (1752-1840).--Novelist, _dau._ of Dr. Charles B., a musician of some distinction, was _b._ at Lynn Regis, where her _f._ was organist. Her mother having died while she was very young, and her _f._, who had come to London, being too busy to give her any attention, she was practically self-educated. Her first novel, _Evelina_, _pub._ anonymously in 1778, at once by its narrative and comic power, brought her fame, and, through Mrs. Thrale (_q.v._), she made the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, with whom she became a great favourite. Her next literary venture was a comedy, _The Witlings_; but, by the advice of her _f._, it was not put upon the stage. In 1782, however, she produced _Cecilia_, which, like its predecessor, had an enormous sale, and which, though not perhaps so popular as _Evelina_, added to her fame. She now became the friend of Burke and other distinguished persons, including Mrs. Delaney, through whom she became known to the royal family, and was offered the appointment of Second Keeper of the Robes, which, with some misgivings, she accepted. This situation did not prove a happy one, the duties being menial, the society uncongenial, and the court etiquette oppressive and injurious to her health, and in 1791 she obtained permission to retire on a pension of £100. She had, during her connection with the court, continued her _Diary_, which she had begun in girlhood, and continued during her whole life, and which during this period contains many interesting accounts of persons and affairs of note. She married (1793) Gen. D'Arblay, a French _emigré_, their only income being her slender pension. This she endeavoured to increase by producing a tragedy, _Edwy and Elvira_, which failed. In 1795 she _pub._ by subscription another novel, _Camilla_, which, though it did not add to her reputation, considerably improved her circumstances, as it is said to have brought her £3000. After some years spent in France, where her husband had obtained employment, she returned to England and _pub._ her last novel, _The Wanderer_, which fell flat. Her only remaining work was a life of her father, written in an extraordinarily grandiloquent style. She died in 1840, aged 87.   ARBUTHNOT, JOHN (1667-1735).--Physician and satirist, was _b._ in Kincardineshire, and after studying at Aberdeen and Oxford, took his degree of M.D. at St. Andrews. Settling in London, he taught mathematics. Being by a fortunate accident at Epsom, he was called in to prescribe for Prince George, who was suddenly taken ill there, and was so successful in his treatment that he was appointed his regular physician. This circumstance made his professional fortune, for his ability enabled him to take full advantage of it, and in 1705 he became physician to the Queen. He became the cherished friend of Swift and Pope, and himself gained a high reputation as a wit and man of letters. His principal works are the _Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus_, partly by Pope, but to which he was the chief contributor, the _History of John Bull_ (1712), mainly against the Duke of Marlborough, _A Treatise concerning the Altercation or Scolding of the Ancients_, and the _Art of Political Lying_. He also wrote various medical treatises, and dissertations on ancient coins, weights, and measures. After the death of Queen Anne, A. lost his court appointments, but this, as well as more serious afflictions with which he was visited, he bore with serenity and dignity. He was an honourable and amiable man, one of the very few who seems to have retained the sincere regard of Swift, whose style he made the model of his own, with such success that writings by the one were sometimes attributed to the other: his _Art of Political Lying_ is an example. He has, however, none of the ferocity of S.   ARGYLL, GEORGE JOHN DOUGLAS CAMPBELL, 8TH DUKE OF (1823-1900).--Statesman and writer on science, religion, and"]]]
