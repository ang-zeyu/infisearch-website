I shall tell General French that you will be all right in a day or two.\"  \"Tell him we shall be all right in an hour or two, that will be much better,\" said Hal.  \"Great Scott!\" exclaimed the lieutenant. \"Can't you even keep still for a day?\"  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"there is likely to be some real fighting to-day, and we don't want to miss anything, do we Chester?\"  \"I should say not,\" was Chester's reply.     CHAPTER IX.  TO THE RESCUE.   \"It looks rather awesome, doesn't it?\" said Chester.  \"It certainly does,\" was Hal's reply.  The object of the boys' conversation was a long armored train, which stood on a siding. It was late in the afternoon, and the two lads, after having taken a long rest, and being relieved from active duty by the express command of General French, had strolled up to the temporary siding, where the huge engine now stood puffing and snorting.  It was the first time either of the two boys had ever seen this rapidly moving vehicle of warfare. The open flat cars were protected by thick sheets of steel, behind which were mounted many small guns and rapid-firers.  These armored trains already had given good accounts of themselves in other parts of the long line of battle, particularly in Belgium, in the earlier days of the struggle, and were things of terror to the German troops.  The train beside which the two lads now stood was ready for instant action. The gunners were at their posts, ready to go forward at a moment's notice. The engineer and firemen stood beside the huge engine.  In the distance the sound of firing could be heard, and occasionally a shell burst close to where the boys were standing. But they had been through their baptism of fire, and paid little heed to these messengers of death.  \"They say that these trains have proven immense factors in sudden raids on the enemy,\" said Chester.  \"Yes,\" agreed Hal, \"and it is easy to see that among light armed troops they could do great execution. It would even take very heavy artillery fire to make an impression on those steel sides. Besides----\"  He broke off with a sudden exclamation.  \"Look out,\" he cried, and leaped back, pulling Chester forcibly along.  A second later and there was a terrific explosion. A German shell had burst within a few feet of where the two lads had been standing.  A crowd of troopers, who had been idling about a few yards from the train, disappeared with the deafening report, and when the smoke had cleared away they were nowhere to be seen. They had been blown to atoms.  The boys rushed forward, but, even as they did so, they halted at the sound of a sudden cry, and, turning their faces up the track, they beheld a mounted officer galloping swiftly toward them. An officer dropped off one of the cars of the train, which, fortunately, had not been touched by the explosion, and hurried to meet the newcomer.  \"Who is in charge of this train?\" demanded the horseman, throwing himself from his mount without waiting for the animal to come to a stop.  \"I am,\" was the officer's brief response.  \"You are ordered to proceed forward at once under full speed,\" was the command. \"The Tenth Royal Dragoons are hemmed in by at least 10,000 Germans two miles ahead, and unless you arrive in time they will all be slaughtered.\"  The officer in command of the train looked hurriedly about.  \"Hicks!\" he called loudly. \"Hicks!\"  There was no reply, and the officer shouted again. Then Hal stepped forward.  \"If Hicks was your engineer,\" he said, \"there is no use calling him. He is dead.\"  \"Dead?\" exclaimed the officer.  \"Yes; that shell struck right beside him. The fireman also was killed.\"  \"Great Scott!\" exclaimed the officer. \"Then what am I to do? Hicks was the only engineer with us right now. The others have gone to their quarters, and by the time I could get them here it would be too late.\"  \"Well,\" said Hal quietly, \"if you want a volunteer, I am willing to tackle it for you.\"  \"You?\"  \"Yes; I have made some slight study of a locomotive, and, while I have never run one any great distance, I have ridden many miles in the cab of an engine in lumber camps in the United States.\"  \"And I can fire the engine,\" Chester broke in.  \"Well,\" said the officer, \"something has to be done at once; and, if you are willing to take a chance, so am I. Get aboard.\"  He turned and rushed hurriedly back to his car, while Hal and Chester leaped aboard the locomotive. In response to a signal, Hal released the brakes, gently opened the throttle, and the great engine began to forge slowly ahead.  Gradually the lad opened the throttle wider, and the huge locomotive commenced to gain momentum, until at last it was rushing along like some mad thing. Chester, in the meantime, was busy with a shovel.  A moment, it seemed to the two lads, and the sound of firing rose above the roar of the locomotive, and the spat spat of bullets against the armored sides could be heard. But Hal did not falter. Rather, the engine seemed to leap ahead with even greater speed.  From the rear came the signal to slow down, and, under Hal's firm hand, the terrific speed of the train was checked. Then also from the rear there came the sound of firing. The rapid-firers on the train had been unloosed, and their leaden messengers were spelling death in the ranks of the Germans, of whom the train was now in the middle.  Chester poked his head out the window of the cab, only to withdraw it quickly, as a bullet struck a quarter of an inch from his ear. But in that one brief glance he had taken in the situation.  A short distance ahead he could make out a small knot of British, almost surrounded by Germans. The British had taken their stand directly on the railroad track, the most strategic point for miles. A clump of small trees screened them from the enemy on one side, but from the other three directions the Germans were pouring in their deadly fire.  The British troops stood gallantly to their work, and returned volley for volley. They fought on doggedly. Suddenly the armored train shot up the line which the British were holding, and Hal brought it to an abrupt stop.  Right and left the train poured in broadsides of machine-gun fire, mowing down the Germans at every yard. The Germans fell in heaps, and, as if by a miracle, both sides of the track were suddenly lined with high piles of the dead.  The little troop of British received this unexpected aid with a great cheer, broke from cover and dashed in pursuit of the great mass of Germans, who now were fleeing on all sides.  But the success of the British was destined to be short-lived. Hal and Chester, in the cab of the locomotive, had just raised a loud cheer when there was a terrific explosion, followed by a thundering crash, and both lads were hurled violently to the floor of the cab.  Chester, with blood flowing from a gash in his forehead, was the first to pick himself up. In falling his head had come in contact with a sharp projection of some kind. He was terribly dizzy, but his head was still clear.  He stooped over Hal, and at that moment the latter raised himself on his elbow and then got to his feet unsteadily.  \"Great Scott! What was that?\" he gasped.  Chester did not reply. Instead he swung out from the cab and glanced back over the train--or rather where the train had been. And what a sight met his gaze!  The train of armored cars was gone. Alongside the track lay pieces of wreckage, and many bodies and pieces of what had once been machine guns.  Hal peered over Chester's shoulder.  \"Another shell,\" he said slowly. \"But how does it happen we were not killed also?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Chester, \"but I judge the shell must have struck in the middle of the train. Look, there is nothing left but the engine.\"  It was true. In some unaccountable manner the engine had escaped scot free. At that moment Hal, who had glanced out from the other side of the cab, made a startling discovery.  \"Wow!\" he shouted. \"Here come the Germans again--thousands of 'em. We are goners, now, sure.\"  But, before Chester could reply, Hal jumped forward. With one hand he released the brakes and threw the throttle wide--and the huge locomotive leaped suddenly forward.  \"It's our only chance,\" Hal shouted to Chester. \"The track behind is covered with wreckage, and it is impossible to go that way.\"  That the Germans understood their ruse was soon apparent. There was a shout from the oncoming horde, and the sharp crack of rifles and bullets began to spatter against the side of the engine.  \"Well, we'll give 'em a chase, anyhow,\" said Hal grimly.  He opened the throttle even wider.     CHAPTER X.  A WILD RIDE.   The engine rocked crazily as it dashed along, and the boys hung on to whatever offered for dear life. Around curve after curve they shot with a lurch, the locomotive threatening at every turn to leave the rails.  \"Where is the end of this road?\" asked Chester of Hal, raising his voice to a shout to make himself heard above the roar of the speeding locomotive.  \"I don't know,\" Hal shouted back.  \"Then you had better slow down. The tracks in front may be torn up and we would certainly be killed.\"  \"You are right,\" shouted Hal.  Quickly he closed the throttle and applied the brakes. The huge mogul trembled violently and shook all over, but its speed was soon slackened.  Looking behind, the two lads saw that they had left their pursuers far in the rear, and both breathed more freely.  \"How far are we going on this thing, anyhow?\" Chester demanded. \"Don't you think we had better get off and walk back?\"  \"What! and leave the engine in the hands of the enemy? Not much. Besides, I am certain the British must control this road at the other end or it would have been destroyed by this time. We'll just keep on going and see what happens.\"  \"Well, something will happen, all right,\" said Chester. \"I can feel it in my bones. However, you are the doctor. Forward it is, then.\"  The locomotive was going more slowly now, Hal always keeping a keen eye ahead."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12870"],["title","The Boy Allies on the Firing Line; Or, Twelve Days Battle Along the Marne (#7)"],["body","perhaps five minutes they rode along without incident; then suddenly Hal, without even a word to Chester, \"opened her up\" again.  Once more the huge locomotive jumped forward.  \"What's the matter now?\" cried Chester, springing to Hal's side.  \"Matter!\" shouted Hal. \"Look ahead.\"  Chester peered out, and drew his head back with an exclamation.  \"More Germans, eh!\" he muttered, and then shouted. \"You do the driving and I'll keep her hot.\"  \"Good!\" Hal called back, never taking his eyes from the road ahead.  Apparently the Germans were unconscious of the approach of the locomotive, for they did not even glance in its direction. Troopers stood beside either side of the track, and several groups were standing between the rails.  Closer and closer the engine approached, and still they did not move. A moment later and the great steel monster was upon them. There was a sudden shout, but it was too late--for some, at any rate.  The great locomotive caught them as they attempted to jump from the track, and hurled them in all directions. Hal and Chester ducked low inside the cab, and it was well that they did so; for, as the engine shot past, hundreds of bullets sped through the cab, and hundreds more flattened themselves against the steel-protected sides. It was close work, and no mistake.  \"Whew!\" breathed Chester, after they had safely run the gauntlet of the German fire and Hal had once more reduced the speed of the locomotive. \"That was close.\"  \"Too close for comfort,\" Hal agreed.  \"I wonder how many we killed back there,\" said Chester.  \"I don't know, but I am sure it was enough. It seemed to be their lives or ours.\"  \"It's only a few more gone to the Happy Hunting Ground in a mistaken cause,\" said Chester slowly. \"But, as you say, it was either they or us. There was nothing else we could do.\"  \"No,\" said Hal, \"there wasn't; but, just the same, it gave me a cold chill as they went flying through the air. It was terrible.\"  Both lads were silent for a time, as the locomotive continued on its way. It was getting dusk now, and Hal was forced to reduce the speed of the engine even more. They went slowly along, both lads keeping a wary eye ahead for Germans.  Darkness came on, and still they rode along. Their speed was little better than a walk, and it was well that Hal had decided to discontinue his reckless driving.  From ahead, a sudden red glare went up to the sky, followed almost instantly by a report like that of a thousand cannons. The locomotive came to a stop with a jolt as Hal applied the brakes.  \"What's up now?\" demanded Chester.  \"I don't know; but that explosion sounded to me as if there were something wrong ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans had dynamited the bridge.\"  \"By George! I believe you are right,\" exclaimed Chester. \"I wouldn't have thought of it, and if I had been in your place at the throttle the chances are we would have gone over if such is the case.\"  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"I'll climb down, take a walk ahead and investigate.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" declared Chester.  \"No, you won't. You stay here and watch the engine.\"  \"You are right, as usual,\" said Chester. \"But don't be any longer than you can help.\"  Hal agreed, and a moment later Chester lost sight of him in the darkness.  Slowly and cautiously Hal made his way along the track. As he moved stealthily around a curve in the road the cause of the explosion became apparent. It was even as he had feared. His quick wit had detected the meaning of the explosion and none too soon.  Just ahead, where a short time before had been a bridge spanning a deep chasm, there was now nothing but space. The bridge had been blown up. Had Hal applied the brakes to the engine one minute later, in spite of the fact that it was traveling very slowly, both boys probably would have been carried over the embankment to certain death; for it is doubtful that either, in the darkness, would have noticed the absence of the bridge in time to leap to safety.  And now Hal could make out a number of rapidly moving figures. To his dismay, he saw that they were moving in his direction. He turned quickly and ran back to the locomotive, where Chester was anxiously awaiting his return.  \"Out here, quick!\" he cried, and Chester, in response to his command, leaped to the ground.  Hal once more jumped aboard the locomotive, unheeding Chester's cry of wonder, released the brakes, and threw the throttle wide open. Then he dropped sprawling to the ground, while the engine dashed madly down the track.  Hal was not badly hurt and was quickly on his feet.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Chester in alarm.  \"Matter is that the Germans are coming this way,\" answered Hal. \"Come, let's get away from here while we have a chance. We may be able to escape in the darkness.\"  \"But why did you start that engine down the track like that?\"  \"Well, I couldn't see that it was any use to us any longer, and it may dispose of a few more Germans. They are walking up the track in force.\"  This appealed to Chester.  \"Good!\" he cried, and both stopped in their tracks to listen.  A second and there came to their ears a sudden startled shout, followed by a fearful yell, a moment of silence, and then a crash.  \"Good-by engine,\" said Hal. \"That's a good job done. You perished nobly. Now,\" to Chester, \"let's get away from this spot as fast as we can.\"  They turned their faces in the direction from which they had come, and set out at a brisk pace. They plodded along for an hour through the open country, finally coming to a dense woods.  \"Guess we had better try and lose ourselves in here,\" said Chester.  \"Right you are,\" agreed Hal.  They entered the friendly shelter of the trees. Here they were forced to travel more slowly. They made good progress, however, and at the end of another hour had covered considerable distance.  \"I guess we are safe enough as long as we can stay in the woods,\" said Chester.  \"Don't be too sure,\" declared Hal. \"It's the unexpected that always happens.\"  The words were hardly out of his mouth when the truth of them was proved. As they emerged from where the trees were thickest into a little clearing a sudden, guttural command brought them to an abrupt stop.  \"Halt!\" came a voice. \"Halt, or I fire!\"     CHAPTER XI.  CAPTURED.   Caught thus unexpectedly Hal immediately threw his hands above his head; Chester followed his example. It was plain to both lads that there was not a chance in a thousand to escape, for the German soldier had his rifle pointed squarely at them.  Of course there was a possibility that by a sudden spring one of the lads might have succeeded in knocking the man down; but this probably would have meant the death of the other. Hal and Chester both realized that it was no time to take such a chance.  \"We surrender,\" called Hal in German, and immediately the soldier lowered his weapon and approached them.  He passed his hands around their waists and then felt in the pockets of their coats and relieved them of their weapons. Then he ordered:  \"Right about; forward, march!\"  The lads obeyed this command, and the German stalked after them, keeping his rifle in readiness for a quick shot should his prisoners attempt to escape.  But the lads had no thought of taking to their heels, for they were fully aware that a bullet would stop one of them at least should they make even one false move.  They continued their walk, and presently came in view of what appeared to be a large German camp. Here their captor marched them directly to the tent of the commanding officer.  \"What are you doing within our lines?\" was the latter's first question after the soldier had related how he had made his capture.  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"we were accidentally carried through your lines by a locomotive which we happened to be running when the rest of the train was blown up. We couldn't get back, so we went ahead. We finally lost the engine, so we were making our way back to our own lines.\"  \"Lost the engine? What do you mean?\" asked the officer.  \"Why,\" Chester broke in, \"we sent it over a precipice that it might not fall into the hands of the Germans.\"  \"You did, eh?\" said the German officer. \"Well, I shall attend to your case in the morning. Orderly! See that these prisoners are carefully guarded, and have them brought to me the first thing in the morning. Perhaps they may be induced to give me the information I require.\"  \"You won't get any information out of us,\" said Chester angrily.  \"Won't I?\" replied the officer, with a sneer. \"We shall see. Take them away.\"  The two lads were led to a small field tent and thrust inside, with a guard on the outside.  \"Well, here we are again,\" said Chester, with a faint smile. \"What do you suppose will be done with us if we refuse to divulge what the general wants to know?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" was Hal's reply, \"but I am afraid we are in for it this time. I have never taken much stock in the tales I have heard of the barbarous treatment of the Germans toward their prisoners, but one look at the general's face was enough to convince me that he would stop at nothing to gain his end.\"  \"The same thought struck me, too,\" agreed Chester. \"But, one thing is certain, he'll get no information out of me.\"  \"Nor out of me, either,\" declared Hal.  Chester rose and started to walk around the tent. In the darkness he stumbled over something and fell to the ground. Arising he reached in his pocket and produced a match. A tiny flame lighted up the dark interior of the tent, and the lad stepped back with an ejaculation.  \"Bicycles,\" he muttered.  \"What?\" demanded Hal.  \"Bicycles. I wonder why they are here?\"  \"Probably dumped in here by a couple of men who have returned from a scouting expedition,\" said Hal.  \"By George!\" exclaimed Chester suddenly.  \"What is it now?\" demanded Hal.  Chester did not reply immediately. He appeared to be thinking deeply.  \"Have you a knife?\" he asked at length.  Hal produced one, and, taking it from his friend's hand, Chester stepped"]]]
