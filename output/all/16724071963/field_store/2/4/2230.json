Dalrymple, there is little doubt, never forgave Cook for taking his place, and later on showed his resentment by an unfair statement which will be presently alluded to.  The _Endeavour_ was what was then known as a \"cat-built\" ship, of 368 tons burden, a description of vessel then much used in          [Sidenote: 1768] the Baltic and coal trade, having large carrying capacity, with small draught. A pencil sketch by Buchan (one of the artists who accompanied Cook) of her hull, lying at Deptford, shows the short, stumpy north-country collier, of which even nowadays one may occasionally see specimens afloat. Her great, square stern has a row of four glazed windows, alternated with ornamental panels and surrounded by scroll work, and two square ports underneath them close to the water's edge, probably for loading and unloading Baltic timber. The usual stern-lantern \"tops off\" the structure. There is a framework for a quarterdeck extending to the waist and the frame of a topgallant poop above this, Buchan probably having made the sketch when she was refitting for the voyage and this structure being erected for the accommodation of the officers.  Cook was appointed a first lieutenant in the navy and commander of the _Endeavour_ on May 25th, 1768, and his ship's company, all told, numbered eighty-five persons.  Sir Joseph Banks (then plain Mr.), Green the astronomer, Dr. Solander the naturalist, two draughtsmen, and a staff of servants were also on board. The ship, for defence against savages it is to be presumed, carried ten four-pound carriage guns and twelve swivels. The food supply was for eighteen months, and consisted of beef, pork, peas, oatmeal, butter, cheese, oil, vinegar, beer, and brandy, and included materials for Dr. McBride's method of treating the scurvy. The Admiralty gave Cook a special order on this matter, in which they say:--      \"The malt must be ground under the direction of the surgeon, and     made into wort (fresh every day, especially in hot weather) in the     following manner viz.: Take one quart of ground malt and pour on     it three quarts of boiling water; stir them well, and let the     mixture stand close covered up for three or four hours, after     which strain off the liquor.      \"The wort so prepared is then to be boiled into a panada with     sea-biscuit or dried fruits usually carried to sea. The patient     must make at least two meals a day on the said panada, and should     drink a quart or more of the fresh infusion, as it may agree with     him, every twenty-four hours. The surgeon is to keep an exact     journal of the effects of the wort in scorbutic and other putrid     diseases not attended with pestilential symptoms, carefully and     particularly noting down, previous to its administration, the     cases in which it is given, describing the several symptoms, and     relating the progress and effects from time to time, which journal     is to be transmitted to us at the end of the voyage.\"  We have a curious illustration of the state           [Sidenote: 1748-1768] of the times in the manner of Cook's treatment by the Viceroy of the Brazils, where, on the way out, he touched to refresh. The Viceroy pretended to believe that the ship was a merchantman, and not a king's ship, and therefore wanted her to comply with certain port regulations which Cook was of opinion did not become the dignity of his commission. In evidence of the _Endeavour_ being one of His Majesty's ships, Cook wrote to the Viceroy and, among other things, drew attention to the distinctive uniform of his officers, which is a reminder to us that at this time the dress of naval officers was beginning to assume uniformity. George II. suggested the colours which were adopted by the Admiralty order in 1748, and, from admirals to lieutenants, officers were now dressed in blue coats with white facings, lace collars and cuffs, and gold trimmings. The uniform was continually changing, even up to within the last few years, and nowadays one naval officer has as many different suits of uniform as would have served all the commissioned officers of a line-of-battle ship in his father's time.  When Cook left on this voyage he had, it has been shown, many advantages over Dampier in the matter of nautical instruments, but there is little doubt that he had absolutely no knowledge of the eastern coast of Australia. Dalrymple was the first to suggest that charts, which there is no doubt, did exist in Cook's time, and which do indicate the eastern coast, were known to Cook. Without going into all the evidence rebutting Dalrymple's insinuation, which has been discussed often enough, one fact is worth remembering: Dalrymple, the most learned geographer of the period, published his _Historical Collection of Voyages_ in 1770, and in that work he makes no mention of the charts; but, on the contrary, his chart of the Pacific only indicates the coastline on the north and the west of the continent. Cook, who up to the moment of his appointment had been too busy at the practical work of his profession to find or study rare books or search libraries for documents and maps relating to the Pacific, was scarcely likely in 1768 to know what was not known to Dalrymple two years later; and also, be it remembered, Dalrymple was very indignant at being passed over in favour of Cook. It may be taken for granted that beyond such books as Dampier's _Voyage,_ De Brosses' volumes, and such charts as the library of the _Endeavour_ furnished, old maps afforded no help to Cook in his survey of New Holland. Of the charts Cook says something in his journal. In September, 1770, he writes:--      \"The charts with which I compared such parts of this coast as I     visited are bound up with a French work entitled _Histoire des     Navigations aux Terres Australes_, which was published in 1756,     and I found them tolerably exact.\"  As to what Cook did in the matter of dry geographical details, if the reader wants them he must go to one or other of the hundred or more books on the subject. In a few words, he sailed between the two main islands of New Zealand, discovering for himself the existence of the straits separating them. He first saw the south-east coast of New Holland at Point Hicks, named by him after his first lieutenant, and now called Cape Everard, in the colony of Victoria; from here he ran north to Botany Bay, where he anchored, took in water and wood, and buried a sailor named Forby Sutherland, who died of consumption and whose name was given to the southern headland of the bay. It is worth noting that in every original document relating to this voyage, save one chart, this bay is called Stingray Bay, after, as Cook himself says, the great number of stingrays caught in it. In one chart, in Cook's own writing, the name Botany Bay is given; but all the _Endeavour_ logs call it Stingray Bay, and the name Botany Bay was probably an afterthought.  From here Cook coasted north, marking almost every point and inlet with such accuracy and such minuteness as fully justifies in its particular meaning the statement that Cook discovered and surveyed the whole of the eastern coast of Australia. He then sailed through Torres Straits, proving that New Guinea was a separate island, and thence made his way to Batavia.  Before leaving the coast he landed on August 21st on Possession Island, which lies about a couple of miles off the western shore of the Cape York peninsula, and there formally took possession of the continent, observing the usual ceremony of hoisting the colours and firing a volley. According to Hawkesworth, Cook took possession of the country, and named it New South Wales. There is no evidence whatever of this, and Hawkesworth himself was probably the first person to write the name. In none of the official log-books or other documents does any other name than New Holland occur, and until Flinders suggested the name \"Australia,\" \"New Holland\" was the generally accepted title of the continent.  Another remarkable mis-statement, which is believed by many, relates to the discovery and naming of Port Jackson, the port of Sydney. On Sunday, May 6th, 1770, Cook's official log contains this entry:--      \"Abrest of an open bay; dist. off the nearest shore, two or three     miles. Lat'd. obs., 33 degrees 47.      \"At this time (noon) we were between two or three miles distant     from the land, and abrest of a bay or harbour, in which there     appeared to be a good anchorage, and which I called Port Jackson.\"  It is still often written that the \"open bay\" was so named after a seaman by the name of Jackson on board the ship; but Sir George Jackson, who afterwards changed his name to Duckett, was at this time, with Mr. Philip Stephens, joint secretary to the Admiralty. Cook named Port Jackson and Port Stephens after these two officials, and there was no seaman named Jackson on board the _Endeavour_. Cook did not enter Port Jackson, and the discovery of the finest harbour in the world was left for another less well remembered, but no less efficient and zealous, naval officer.  The simple entries in the _Endeavour's_ logbooks, to the sailor who reads them, tell far better than the fine writing of Dr. Hawkesworth the difficulties which Cook laboured under on this voyage. For example, His Majesty's ship _Endeavour_ was so well found that on April 14th, 1770, Cook has this entry:--      \"The spritsail topsail being wore to rags, it was condemned as     unfit for its proper use, and taken to repair the topgall'ntsails,     they being so bad as not to be worth the expense of new canvas,     but, with the help of this sail, will be made to last some time;     also took out one of the ship's tents (50) yards of canvas to     repair the jibb that was split on the 1st instant, there being     neither new canvas nor twine in the ship to spare for that     purpose.\"  But the most serious trouble was when on the 11th"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12992"],["title","The Naval Pioneers of Australia (#8)"],["body"," June the _Endeavour_ got ashore on the Barrier Reef. Here is Cook's entry:--      \"Shoal'd the water from 20 to 17 faths., and before the man in the     chains could have another cast the ship struck and lay fast on     some rocks, upon which we took in all sail, hoisted out the boats,     and sounded round the ship, and found that we had got upon the     edge of a reef of coral rocks, which lay to the N.W. of us, having     in some places round the ship 3 or 4 fathoms, and in others about     as many feet; but about 100 feet from her starboard side, she     laying with her head to the N.E., were 7, 8, and 10 fathom.     Carried out the stream anchor and two hawsers on the starboard     bow and the coasting anchor and cable upon the starboard quarters,     got down yards and topmasts, and hove taught upon the hawser and     cable; but as we had gone ashore about high water, the ship by     this time was quite fast. Turned all hands to lighten the ship,     and in order to do this we not only started water, but hove     overboard guns, iron and stone ballast, casks, hoops, staves,     oyl-jars, stores, and whatever was of weight or in the way at     coming at heavy articles. All this time the ship made but little     water. Being now high water, as we thought, hove a strain upon the     stern anchor, as I found the ship must go off that way, if at all,     but all we could do was to no purpose, she not being afloat by a     foot or more, notwithstanding we had hove overboard 40 or 50-ton     weight; but as this was not sufficient, we continued to lighten     her by every method we could think of. By that time she begun to     make water as much as two pumps could free. At noon she lay with     three streaks heel to starboard. Lat obs'ed, 15 degrees 45 So.\"  This was off what Cook called Cape Tribulation, and on the two following days these entries appear:--      \"Light airs and fine weather, which gave us an opportunity to     carry out boath the bowers, the one on the starboard quarter and     the other right astern. The spare stream anchor we likewise     carried out, and got purchases upon all the cables, and hove     taught upon all the 5 anchors. At 4 it was low water, so far as we     could judge by the rocks about the ship and part of the shoal     being dry, which we had not seen before. The rise and fall of the     water did not appear to exceed 3 or 4 feet. As the tide began to     rise the leak incresed, which obliged us to set the 3rd pump to     work, which we should have done the 4th also could we have made it     deliver any water. The ship now righted, and the leak gained on     the pumps in such a manner that it became a matter of     consideration whether we should heave her off or no in case she     floated, for fear of her going down with us in the deep water; but     as I thought we should be able to run her ashore, either upon the     same shoal or upon the main, in case we could not keep her, I     resolved at all risks to heave her off if possible, and     accordingly tur'nd as many men to the capstan and windlass as     could be spar'd from the pumps, and at 20 minutes past ten hove     her afloat and into deep water.\" (He did not do this without     losing his anchors, as he tells us, but)      \"The pumps gain'd on the leak these 4 hours. Some hands employ'd     sowing oakem, wool, etc., into a sail to fother the ship. Weigh'd     the coasting anchor and warped out to the S.E., and at 11 got     under sail, with a light breeze at E.S.E., and stood in for the     land, having a small boat laying upon the point of the shoal, the     south point of which at noon bore north, distant one mile. The     pumps gain'd upon the leak this 4 hours. Light airs and clear     weather. Standing off the shore in for the main. Got up the main     topmast and main-yard. Having got the sail ready for fothering the     ship, we put it over under the starboard fore chains, where we     suspected she suffer'd most, and soon after the leak decreas'd so     much as to be kept clear with one pump with ease. This fortunate     circumstance gave new life to everyone on board. Anchor'd in 17     fathom water, 5 leagues from the land, and about 3 miles from the     shore.\"  On the 17th they found a harbour where they hove the ship down and repaired her, when it was found that--      \"One of the holes, which was big enough to have sunk us if we had     had eight pumps instead of four, and had been able to keep them     incessantly going, was in great measure plugged up by a fragment     of the rock, which, after having made the wound, was left sticking     in it; so that the water which had at first gained upon our pumps     was what came in at the interstices between the stone and the     edges of the hole that received it.\"  Endeavour River, Cape Flattery, Providential Channel, and other names on the chart commemorate the accident; yet after all this trouble Cook continued his survey, sailing safely through the cluster of rocks between New Guinea and the mainland. This passage and the Barrier Reef are probably two of the most dangerous places in the world, and more vessels have been wrecked on that bit of coast between the southern end of the Barrier Reef and the Indian Ocean side of Torres Straits than on any similar stretch of coast-line anywhere.  So far the voyage had been without other disaster than this, but on the way back the _Endeavour_ put into Batavia to refresh, and in a letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty, dated the 9th of May, 1771, Cook wrote:--      \"That uninterrupted state of health we have all along enjoyed was,     soon after our arrival at Batavia, succeeded by a general     sickness, which delayed us there so much that it was the 20th of     December before we were able to leave that place. We were     fortunate enough to loose but few men at Batavia, but on our     passage from thence to the Cape of Good Hope we had twenty-four     men died, all, or most of them, of the bloody flux. This fatal     disorder reign'd in the ship with such obstinacy that medicines,     however skilfully administered, had not the least effect. I     arrived at the Cape on the 14th of March, and quitted it again on     the 14th of April, and on the 1st of May arrived at St. Helena,     where I joined His Maj.'s ship _Portland_, which I found ready to     sail with the convoy\";  and on the 12th of July he brought up in the Downs, reporting one more death--that of Lieutenant Hicks.  For his services Cook was promoted a step. His after-life and death need no mention here, and although in both his second and third voyages he touched at New Zealand and Tasmania, his connection with Australia practically ends with the _Endeavour_ voyage. But a word or two about the _Endeavour's_ officers, taken from documents recently obtained by the New South Wales Government, which perhaps contain some things new to many readers.  In the Record Office, London, there are no fewer than ten logs of Cook's voyage; three of these are anonymous, but six of them are signed by the ship's officers, and one, from circumstantial evidence, is no doubt by Green, the astronomer. The signed logs are by Hicks, Cook's first lieutenant; Forwood, the gunner; and Pickersgill, Clerke, Wilkinson, and Bootie, mates. Hicks, as we have seen, died on the passage home; Forwood, after the _Endeavour's_ return, is not heard of again. Pickersgill was promoted to be master on the death of that officer (Robert Molineux) in April, 1771. He had previously served as a midshipman under Wallis in 1766-1788, and he served again under Cook in the _Resolution_ as third lieutenant. On the return of Cook from his second voyage, Pickersgill was appointed commander of the _Lion_, and sent to survey Baffin's Bay, but he was relieved of the command early in 1777, and then we lose sight of him. Wilkinson also had served under Wallis, but he died soon after the return of the _Endeavour_, and Bootie died on the way home.  The best-known of these log-writers is Charles Clerke. Though only a youngster, he had seen much service. When the Seven Years' War in 1756 broke out, he was, at fifteen years of age, serving on a man-of-war. He was on the _Bellona_ in her celebrated engagement with the _Courageux_, off Vigo, in 1761, and he accompanied Byron in the _Dolphin_, afterwards serving in America, where it is probable Cook first met him. Consequent on the many deaths, Clerke was made third lieutenant of the _Endeavour_ after the ship left Batavia, and Cook, referring to his appointment, wrote to the Admiralty that Clerke was a young man well worthy of the step. He again served with Cook as second lieutenant of the _Resolution_, and in Cook's third voyage he was captain of the _Discovery_ and second in command of the expedition. When Cook was killed on February 14th, 1779, he took charge, but only survived his superior until the 22nd of August. He died off the Kamschatka coast, and was buried at the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul. His shipmates erected a board with an inscription upon it over his grave; and La Pérouse, when in 1787 he visited the spot, caused the board to be replaced by a copper plate, on which the inscription was re-engraved.  In a volume of the _New South Wales Records_ is printed for the first time a batch of letters from Clerke to Sir Joseph Banks, and these documents so well depict poor Clerke's cheery disposition, notwithstanding that he was suffering from a fear of the King's Bench, and, what was more serious, the sad disease which ended in his death, that we may be pardoned for reproducing extracts from them. The first was written just before Clerke sailed with Cook on that fatal third voyage as commander of the _Discovery_:--      \"DEAR SIR,--I am very sorry to inform you that I am fairly cast     away. The damnation Bench of Justices fell out among themselves,     upset and fairly frustrated the friendly intentions of Sir     Fletcher Norton, &c.,"]]]
