Presently a number of men came from the bar-room of the hotel and moved in various directions. With one of these was the youth for whom Dick was looking.  Dan Baxter and his companion moved in the direction of the lake shore, and Dick lost no time in following the pair.  The man with Baxter was a stranger to Dick, but he showed by his manner that he was a rough individual, and when he talked he did a great deal of swearing, which, however, will not appear in his conversation in these pages.  Having reached the road running along the lake front, Baxter and his companion, whose name was Lemuel Husty, passed northward past a straggling row of cottages and then on the road leading to the village of Neckport.  \"I wish I had time--I'd follow them,\" said Dick to himself, and turned back, much disappointed over the fact that he had not had a chance to speak to Dan Baxter.  As Dick turned in the direction of the doctor's office once more he was hailed by a lad of the village, named Harry Sharp.  \"Hullo, Dick Rover!\"  \"How are you Harry? How do you like the snow?\"  \"All right enough, only it will spoil some of the skating.\"  \"So I've been thinking,\" answered Dick, as the two came closer.  \"Say, Dick, who do you suppose I met a while ago,\" went on Harry Sharp.  \"I don't know--Dan Baxter?\"  \"That's the chap. How did you guess it?\"  \"I saw him myself.\"  \"I thought he didn't dare to show himself?\"  \"Well, he ought to be arrested, Harry. But perhaps having his father in prison, and losing most of his money, is punishment enough for him.\"  \"I met him in the post office. He was posting several letters.\"  \"Did you see the handwriting on the letters?\"  \"No. As soon as he saw me he slid out of sight.\"  \"I guess he doesn't fancy being recognized. By the way, have you seen Captain Putnam?\"  \"Saw him about an hour ago. I think he was going to the Hall.\"  \"Good enough! I was waiting for him to get back.\"  A few words more followed, and the two boys separated, and Dick hurried to the doctor's office. Dr. Fremley was ready to leave, and soon the pair were on the way to the Stanhope cottage.  Not wishing to give the Hall a bad name Dick deemed it advisable to say nothing about the fact that Sam had been locked in an ice-cold room without his overcoat or hat, and merely stated that his brother had exposed himself.  \"He has a very heavy cold,\" said the doctor, after an examination. \"If let run, it would have become serious, beyond a doubt; but I feel confident I can check it,\" and he left some medicine and some plasters.  As soon as the doctor was gone Dick announced his intention of returning to Putnam Academy. \"The captain has got back, and I want to lay the whole case before him, and do it, too while Sam is still sick.\"  \"Shall I go along?\" asked Tom.  \"No, I'll go alone. They may need you here on Sam's account.\"  Dick was soon on the way, riding another horse, for the Stanhopes now kept two. He had had a fine dinner, and felt in the best of spirits, despite the disagreeable task before him. He did not doubt for a moment but that Captain Putnam would side with him and condemn the actions of Jasper Grinder.  He was still out of sight of the Hall when he saw Peleg Snuggers riding toward him in the captain's cutter.  \"Is that you, Master Rover!\" sang out the man of all work. \"Where are your brothers?\"  \"Safe, Snuggers. Has the captain got back?\"  \"Yes--got in a couple of hours ago.\"  \"Has he said anything about our going away?\"  \"Said anything? Just guess he has. Why, the whole school is so upset nobody knows what he is doing. Do you know what happened after you and your brothers ran away?\"  \"Of course I don't. What did happen?\"  \"Mr. Grinder had a terrible row with more than a dozen of the boys, who sided with what you had done. He got awfully mad at them, and was going to cane the lot, when all of a sudden he fell down in a fit, just like he was going to die, and we had to work over him most an hour before we could bring him around.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  JASPER GRINDER IS DISMISSED.   Dick was greatly surprised over the news which Peleg Snuggers conveyed to him. He knew that Jasper Grinder was an intensely passionate man when aroused, as on the occasion of the attempted caning, but he had not imagined that the man would fall into a fit while in such a condition.  \"Did he come out of the fit all right?\" he questioned soberly.  \"When he came around he was as weak as a rag, and I and one of the big boys had to help him up to his room. He stayed there the rest of the evening, and the other teachers had to take charge.\"  \"What do they say about the matter?\"  \"As soon as the captain got back all of 'em got in the private office and held a long talk. Then the captain had a talk with Mr. Grinder, and after that the captain sent me off to look for you. He said you must be at the Lanings, or at Mrs. Stanhope's, or else somewhere in Cedarville.\"  \"We are stopping with Mrs. Stanhope. Sam is sick with a heavy cold.\"  \"It's not to be wondered at. Master Tubbs has a cold, too, and the captain had Mrs. Green give him some medicine for it.\"  \"Has he punished Tubbs?\"  \"No. He's awfully upset, and I don't think he'll do anything right away,\" concluded the general utility man.  The cutter was turned around, and Dick and Snuggers hurried toward the Hall. Their coming was noticed by a score of boys who were snowballing each other oh the parade ground, and a shout went up.  \"Dick Rover is coming back! Snuggers has brought Dick Rover back!\"  \"Take care of the horse, Snuggers,\" said Dick. \"Do the right thing, and I won't forget to pay you at Christmas-time.\"  \"All right Master Rover; thank you,\" answered the man of all work.  Dick was at once surrounded, but before he could answer any questions he saw Captain Putnam appear at one of the windows and at once went inside to greet him.  \"Well, Rover, what does all this mean?\" demanded the head of the school, but there was not much sternness in his tone.  \"It means Captain Putnam, that Sam, Tom, and I couldn't stand the treatment we received from Mr. Grinder. For a little set-to which Sam and Tubbs had in the gymnasium Mr. Grinder put Sam in the ice-cold storeroom, and was going to keep him there all night, with nothing but stale bread to eat and cold water to drink. If Sam had remained in the storeroom he would have died from the effects of it. As it is, he is now in bed at Mrs. Stanhope's, and we had to call in Dr. Fremley to attend him.\"  \"Is he very ill, Rover? Tell me the exact truth.\"  \"I have never told you anything else, Captain Putnam. No, I don't think he is very ill, but he's got a bad cold. He is very hoarse, and he complained of such a pain in the chest that Mrs. Stanhope put on some plasters, and when the doctor came he left some more.\"  \"Humph!\" Captain Putnam began to walk up and down his private office. \"What did you tell Dr. Fremley?\"  \"Nothing but that Sam had exposed himself. I didn't want to give the school a black name. But one thing is certain, we can't remain here if Mr. Grinder is going to stay. I shall write to my father and tell him the full particulars.\"  \"It will not be necessary to do so, Richard.\" The captain caught Dick by the shoulder. \"I have investigated this affair, and while I find that Sam was to blame, and Tom and you, too, yet I am convinced that Mr. Grinder exceeded his authority here. He had no business to put Sam in the storeroom and Master Tubbs in the stone cell in this freezing weather. More than that, something happened after you left that shows plainly Mr. Grinder is not the proper person to be a teacher here, and from to-day I intend to dispense with his services.\"  Dick knew what the captain referred to, the falling of the teacher into his passionate fit on the floor, but he said nothing on that point, for in a way he felt sorry for one who could control himself so little.  \"I am glad we won't have to put up with him, sir, any longer. In one way, he is worse than Mr. Crabtree was.\"  \"Let us drop the whole subject, Richard. I have not been satisfied with Mr. Grinder for some time past, and had in view a teacher to take his place before this happened. The new teacher will come after the holidays, and I feel certain all the students will like him fully as much as they like Mr. Strong.\"  \"We won't ask for anybody better than Mr. Strong--or yourself,\" answered Dick, with a smile.  A talk lasting quarter of an hour followed, and it was decided that Dick should return to the Stanhope cottage, to tell Tom and Sam what turn affairs had taken. Then Tom was to come to the Hall, leaving Dick to look after Sam.  It was nightfall before Dick got back to the cottage. Of course his brothers and the others listened to his story with interest. Both Sam and Tom felt greatly relieved.  \"If Grinder keeps on he'll kill himself in one of his fits,\" said Sam. \"I hope he leaves before I go back to school.\"  \"If I was you, I wouldn't go back until he does leave,\" said Tom. \"I'm sure Mrs. Stanhope will let you stay here; won't you?\"  \"To be sure, Tom,\" answered the lady of the cottage. \"But now Captain Putnam has made up his mind, you may be sure Mr. Grinder will not remain at the Hall many days.\"  \"Perhaps he'll go to-night,\" said Dora. \"The captain surely wont wish him at the Hall over Sunday.\"  Tom remained with his brothers until evening; then started for the Hall on foot, not caring to bother with a horse. The road was now well broken, so he had no trouble in making the journey.  When he arrived at the Academy he found the boys assembled in the classroom, in charge of one of the under-teachers.  \"You cannot see Captain Putnam at present,\" said the teacher. \"You will have to remain here with the other pupils until he is at leisure.\"  \"Something must be wrong,\" murmured Tom, as he slipped in a seat next to George Granbury.  \"I think the captain is getting rid of old Grinder,\" was the whispered reply. \"He's afraid we'd go out and give"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13455"],["title","The Rover Boys In The Mountains; Or, A Hunt for Fun and Fortune (#7)"],["body","three groans when he left.\"  \"I see. Well, it's best to let him go quietly. Good riddance to him.\"  \"That's what all the boys say, although some are sorry he had the fit.\"  \"So am I sorry; but he brought it on himself.\"  Presently there was loud knocking in the front of the building and the slamming of a door. Then a trunk was dumped into the captain's cutter, and the horse started off, carrying Peleg Snuggers and Jasper Grinder behind him.  When the captain came into the classroom he was pale, and pulled nervously on his mustache Evidently his task of getting rid of the passionate teacher had not been a light one. He said but little, and shortly after the boys were dismissed and sent to bed.  Sunday continued bright and clear, but it was so bitter cold that but few of the students went to church and Sunday school. Tom was anxious to hear how Sam was getting along, and in the afternoon Captain Putnam himself drove him to the Stanhope cottage in the cutter.  It was found that the youngest Rover was feeling much better, although his hoarseness had not left him. He said he was sure he could go back to school the next day.  \"We had a visit from Jasper Grinder,\" said Dick. \"He insisted on stopping here in spite of all Snuggers could do to stop him.\"  \"And what did he say?\" asked the captain anxiously.  \"Oh, he was in a terrible rage, and threatened to sue my father because, as he put it, we had driven him from earning a good living. I could hardly get him out of the house, and when he left he picked up a big chunk of ice and snow and hurled it through the sitting-room window at Sam. I believe the man isn't quite right in his head.\"  \"It certainly looks like it,\" was the captain's grave response.  \"Did Snuggers leave him in Cedarville?\"  \"Yes. But Snuggers didn't know where he went after that, excepting that he called at the post office for some letters.\"  \"I hope I never have anything to do with him again,\" said Sam, with a shiver.  \"I do not believe he will bother you in the future,\" returned the captain. \"When he comes to his sober senses he will realize fully how foolishly he has acted.\"  As Sam was so much better and needed no care that Mrs. Stanhope and Dora were not willing to give him, Tom returned to the Hall with Dick and Captain Putnam, after supper at the widow's cottage. The sleigh ride to the school was delightful, for the road was now in excellent shape, while overhead the stars shone down like so many glittering diamonds.     CHAPTER IX.  A RACE ON THE ICE, AND WHAT FOLLOWED.   After the events just narrated several days passed quietly enough at Putnam Hall. In the meantime the weather continued clear, and the boys took it upon themselves to clear off a part of the lake for skating. Then, one night came a strong wind, and the next morning they found a space of cleared ice nearly half a mile long.  \"Now for some fine skating!\" exclaimed Tom, as he rushed back to the Hall after an inspection of the lake's smooth surface. \"We can have all the racing we wish.\"  \"It's a pity Sam can't go out yet,\" returned Dick. Sam was back to the school, but his cold had not entirely left him.  \"Never mind; here are several new magazines he can read,\" returned Tom, who had been to town with Snuggers on an errand and had purchased them at the stationery store.  \"I would just as soon read now,\" said Sam. \"The magazines look mighty interesting.\"  Just then Fred Garrison came in, accompanied by George Granbury. They had been down to Cedarville to purchase some skates and a new pair of shoes for George.  \"Hullo, what do you think we saw in Cedarville!\" cried Fred, as soon as he caught sight of the Rovers.  \"Lots of snow,\" suggested Tom dryly.  \"Yes--and more.\"  \"A mighty dull town,\" suggested Sam.  \"We saw Dan Baxter.\"  \"What was he doing?\"  \"He was walking down the street. And who do you suppose was with him? Mr. Grinder!\"  \"Grinder!\" came simultaneously from Tom and Dick.  \"Yes, Grinder. And they seemed to be on good terms with each other,\" put in George.  \"I could hardly believe my eyes at first,\" went on Fred. \"But there they were, as plain as day.\"  \"It's very odd,\" mused Dick. \"What should bring them together?\"  Nobody could answer that question.  \"I don't believe they are up to any good,\" said Tom.  \"I hope Grinder doesn't join hands with Baxter in plotting against us,\" came from Dick.  The matter was talked over for some time, but no satisfactory conclusion could be reached, and presently the boys separated, some to go skating and others to attend to their studies for the morrow.  Down at the lake the scene was an animated one. Boys were flying in every direction, and mingled with them were a dozen or more girls and a few grown persons. George Strong, the head teacher, was there, enjoying himself fully as much as the pupils who loved him.  \"I'll race you, Mr. Strong!\" sang out one of the older boys, Tom Mardell.  \"Done, Master Mardell,\" was the teacher's answer. \"To yonder rock and return.\" And in a moment more the pair were off.  \"Hurrah! A race between Mr. Strong and Tom Mardell!\" came in a shout from a number of the students, and soon there was a general \"lining up\" to see how it would terminate.  \"Go in, Tom!\" shouted Tom Rover. \"Don't let him beat you!\"  \"Mr. Strong is behind!\" came presently. \"Tom is going to win out, sure!\"  On and on went the skaters, until the rock was gained. Then Tom Mardell turned so suddenly that he ran full tilt into the teacher with whom he was racing. Both spun around and came down on the ice with a crash.  \"Oh!\" gasped Mardell. \"I didn't mean to do that!\"  \"I--I know you didn't!\" panted Mr. Strong. \"You have finished the race in fine shape, I must declare!\" And then he arose slowly to his feet and Mardell followed. But nobody was seriously hurt, and in a moment more both skated off hand in hand.  Dick was looking for Dora Stanhope, and presently she appeared, in a pretty fur coat and a jaunty fur cap. He put on her skates for her, and they skated off, with many a side wink from some of the boys.  \"Dick's head over heels,\" said one lad, to Tom.  \"Well, I guess you'd be, too, Urner, if you could get such a nice girl to notice you,\" returned Tom dryly. And then he added: \"You must remember we are all old friends.\"  \"Oh, I know that; and I was only joking.\"  A grand race, open to all comers, had been arranged by the students of the Hall and of Pornell Academy, a rival institute of learning, which has already figured in other volumes of this series. The Pornell boys were out in force, and they were sure that one of their number would win the silver napkin ring, which was the first prize, and another the story book, which constituted the second prize.  Of this race a gentleman from Cedarville, named Mr. Richards, was to be the starter and judge. The course was a short mile, down the lake and back again. The Pornell boys to enter were named Gray, Wardham, Gussy, and De Long. The contestants from Putnam Hall were Tom Rover, Fred Garrison, Tubbs, and a lad named Hollbrook.  \"Are you ready?\" asked Mr. Richards, after lining the boys up and telling them of the conditions of the race.  There was a dead silence.  \"Go!\" shouted the starter.  Away went the eight skaters, side by side each striking out bravely. Fred was in the lead, with two Pornell boys a close second, while Tom Rover was fourth.  \"Go in, Tom, you must win!\" sang out Dick excitedly.  \"Hurrah for Tubby!\" came from several others. \"He's crawling up!\"  \"Go in, Gray!\" came in a shout from some Pornell sympathizers. Gray was one of the pair striving for second place. Now he shot ahead, and in a second more was close upon Fred Garrison's heels.  The pace was truly terrific from the very start, and long before the turn was gained De Long and Hollbrook dropped out, satisfied that they could not win.  Gray, the leader of the Pornell contingent, was a tall, lanky, and powerful fellow, and every stroke he took told well in his favor. The turning point was hardly rounded when he began to crawl up to Fred, and then he gradually passed him.  \"Hurrah! Gray is ahead!\" shouted his friends.  \"Here is where Pornell wins the race!\" added one enthusiastic sympathizer.  Fred's pace had been too sharp from the very start, and now he slowly but surely dropped back to second place, and then to third.  But then Tom Rover began to crawl up. He had held himself slightly in reserve. Now he \"let himself out.\" Whiz! whiz! went the polished pair of steels under him, and soon Wardham, the fellow who had held second place, was passed, dropping behind Fred, thus taking fourth place. Then Tom came up on Gray's heels.  \"Hurrah for Tom Rover!\"  \"Go it, Tom, don't let him beat you!\"  \"Go it Gray, Tom Rover is at your heels!\"  Gray did not dare to look back, but at the latter cry he did his best to increase his speed. So did Tom, and while the finishing line was still a hundred yards distant he came up side by side with Gray.  \"It's a tie!\"  \"No, Gray is a little ahead yet!\"  \"Go in, Gray, don't let him beat you!\"  \"Tom Rover to the front! Go it, Tom, for the glory of old Putnam Hall!\"  A wild yelling broke out on every side. On and on went the two boys, with Fred Garrison not two yards behind them. That the finish would be a close one there was no question. The line was but a hundred feet away; now but seventy-five; now but fifty. Still the leaders kept side by side, neither gaining an inch. Surely it would be a tie. The yelling increased until the noise was deafening.  And then of a sudden Tom Rover shot ahead. How it was done nobody knew, and Tom himself couldn't explain it when asked afterward. But ahead he went, like an arrow shot from a bow, and crossed the line six feet in advance of Gray.  \"Hurrah! Tom Rover has won!\"  \"Told you Tom would do it!\"  \"Three cheers for Putnam Hall!\"  \"And Fred Garrison came in only one yard behind Gray, too, and Tubby is a pretty good fourth.\"  \"This is Putnam Hall day, thank you!\"  The cheering increased, and Tom was immediately "]]]
