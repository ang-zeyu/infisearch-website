Queen Hiordis sends thee this,   And she saith that the world shall call it by the name that thou shalt name;   Now the gift to thee is given, and to thee is brought the fame.\"    Then e'en as a man astonied King Elf the Volsung took,   While his feast-hall's ancient timbers with the cry of the earl-folk shook;         *       *       *       *       *    With the love of many peoples was the wise king smitten through,   As he hung o'er the new-born Volsung: but at last he raised his head,   And looked forth kind o'er his people, and spake aloud and said:    \"O Sigmund King of Battle; O man of many days,   Whom I saw mid the shields of the fallen and the dead men's silent praise,   Lo, how hath the dark tide perished and the dawn of day begun!   And now, O mighty Sigmund, wherewith shall we name thy son?\"    But there rose up a man most ancient, and he cried: \"Hail Dawn of the Day!   How many things shalt thou quicken, how many shalt thou slay!   How many things shalt thou waken, how many lull to sleep!   How many things shalt thou scatter, how many gather and keep!   O me, how thy love shall cherish, how thine hate shall wither and burn!   How the hope shall be sped from thy right hand, nor the fear to thy left        return!   O thy deeds that men shall sing of! O thy deeds that the Gods shall see!   O SIGURD, Son of the Volsungs, O Victory yet to be!\"    Men heard the name and they knew it, and they caught it up in the air,   And it went abroad by the windows and the doors of the feast-hall fair,   It went through street and market; o'er meadow and acre it went,   And over the wind-stirred forest and the dearth of the sea-beat bent,   And over the sea-flood's welter, till the folk of the fishers heard,   And the hearts of the isle-abiders on the sun-scorched rocks were stirred.         *       *       *       *       *   _Sigurd getteth to him the horse that is called Greyfell._    Now waxeth the son of Sigmund in might and goodliness,   And soft the days win over, and all men his beauty bless.   But amidst the summer season was the Isle-queen Hiordis wed   To King Elf the son of the Helper, and fair their life-days sped.   Peace lay on the land for ever, and the fields gave good increase,   And there was Sigurd waxing mid the plenty and the peace.   Now hath the child grown greater, and is keen and eager of wit   And full of understanding, and oft hath he joy to sit   Amid talk of weighty matters when the wise men meet for speech;   And joyous he is moreover and blithe and kind with each.   But Regin the wise craftsmaster heedeth the youngling well,   And before the Kings he cometh, and saith such words to tell.    \"I have fostered thy youth, King Elf, and thine O Helper of men,   And ye wot that such a master no king shall see again;   And now would I foster Sigurd; for, though he be none of thy blood,   Mine heart of his days that shall be speaketh abundant good.\"    Then spake the Helper of men-folk: \"Yea, do herein thy will:   For thou art the Master of Masters, and hast learned me all my skill:   But think how bright is this youngling, and thy guile from him withhold;   For this craft of thine hath shown me that thy heart is grim and cold,   Though three men's lives thrice over thy wisdom might not learn;   And I love this son of Sigmund, and mine heart to him doth yearn.\"    Then Regin laughed, and answered: \"I doled out cunning to thee;   But nought with him will I measure: yet no cold-heart shall he be,   Nor grim, nor evil-natured: for whate'er my will might frame,   Gone forth is the word of the Norns, that abideth ever the same.   And now, despite my cunning, how deem ye I shall die?\"    And they said he would live as he listed, and at last in peace should lie   When he listed to live no longer; so mighty and wise he was.    But again he laughed and answered: \"One day it shall come to pass,   That a beardless youth shall slay me: I know the fateful doom;   But nought may I withstand it, as it heaves up dim through the gloom.\"    So is Sigurd now with Regin, and he learns him many things;   Yea, all save the craft of battle, that men learned the sons of kings:   The smithying sword and war-coat; the carving runes aright;   The tongues of many countries, and soft speech for men's delight;   The dealing with the harp-strings, and the winding ways of song.   So wise of heart waxed Sigurd, and of body wondrous strong:   And he chased the deer of the forest, and many a wood-wolf slew,   And many a bull of the mountains: and the desert dales he knew,   And the heaths that the wind sweeps over; and seaward would he fare,   Far out from the outer skerries, and alone the sea-wights dare.  One day did Regin tell Sigurd of deeds done in the past by kings both bold and wise, and the lad longed, too, to do the like, and his bright eyes glowed with desire. And Regin told him that he should follow his Volsung fathers and roam far and wide, leaving the peace-lovers and home-abiders who had cherished his youth.  This roused Sigurd's wrath, for he would have nought said against those who had reared him, but Regin bade him ask for one of the horses of Gripir, and banished his anger by a song of the deeds of the Choosers of the Slain. Before the song was finished Sigurd went to King Elf and asked that he might have authority to seek a horse from King Gripir.    Then smiled King Elf, and answered: \"A long way wilt thou ride,   To where unpeace and troubles and the griefs of the soul abide,   Yea unto the death at the last: yet surely shall thou win   The praise of many a people: so have thy way herein.   Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold   The sun of the early dawning, that turneth it all unto gold.\"    Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them; and through the night he lay   Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way;   Then he shook the sleep from off him, and that dwelling of Kings he left   And wended his ways unto Gripir. On a crag from the mountain reft   Was the house of the old King builded; and a mighty house it was,   Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass:   But the wild ernes cried about it, and the vultures toward it flew,   And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber        through,   And about were meads wide-spreading; and many a beast thereon,   Yea some that are men-folk's terror, their sport and pasture won.    So into the hall went Sigurd; and amidst was Gripir set   In a chair of the sea-beast's tooth; and his sweeping beard nigh met   The floor that was green as the ocean, and his gown was of mountain-gold,   And the kingly staff in his hand was knobbed with the crystal cold.    Now the first of the twain spake Gripir: \"Hail King with the eyen bright!   Nought needest thou show the token, for I know of thy life and thy light.   And no need to tell of thy message; it was wafted here on the wind,   That thou wouldst be coming today a horse in my meadow to find:   And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that shall be.   Now choose thou of all the way-wearers that are running loose in my lea.\"         *       *       *       *       *    Then again gat Sigurd outward, and adown the steep he ran   And unto the horse-fed meadow: but lo, a grey-clad man,   One-eyed and seeming ancient, there met him by the way:   And he spake: \"Thou hastest, Sigurd; yet tarry till I say   A word that shall well bestead thee: for I know of these mountains well   And all the lea of Gripir, and the beasts that thereon dwell.\"    \"Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings? art thou Gripir's horse-herd        then?   Nay sure, for thy face is shining like the battle-eager men   My master Regin tells of: and I love thy cloud-grey gown,   And thy visage gleams above it like a thing my dreams have known.\"    \"Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind,\" then spake that elder of days,   \"And sooth do the sages say, when the beasts of my breeding they praise.   There is one thereof in the meadow, and, wouldst thou cull him out,   Thou shalt follow an elder's counsel, who hath brought strange things about,   Who hath known thy father aforetime, and other kings of thy kin.\"    So Sigurd said, \"I am ready; and what is the deed to win?\"   He said: \"We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side,   That cometh forth from the mountains, and note what next shall betide.\"    Then the twain sped on together, and they drave the horses on   Till they came to a rushing river, a water wide and wan;   And the white mews hovered o'er it; but none might hear their cry   For the rush and the rattle of waters, as the downlong flood swept by.   So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem,   And many a brave steed was there; but the flood o'ermastered them:   And some, it swept them down-ward, and some won back to bank,   Some, caught by the net of the eddies, in the swirling hubbub sank;   But one of all swam over, and they saw his mane of grey   Toss over the flowery meadows, a bright thing far away:   Wide then he wheeled about them, then took the stream again   And with the waves' white horses mingled his cloudy mane.    Then spake the elder of days: \"Hearken now, Sigurd, and hear;   Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear,   And this horse is a gift of my giving:--heed nought where thou mayst ride:   For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide,   And on earth they thought of its threshold, and the gifts I had to give;   Nor prayed for a little longer, and a little longer to live.\"    Then forth he strode to the mountains, and fain was Sigurd now.   To ask him many a matter: but dim did his bright shape grow,   As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night;   And the sun in the high-noon shone, and the world was exceeding bright."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13487"],["title","The Ideal Bartender (#0)"],["body","THE IDEAL BARTENDER  by  TOM BULLOCK  1917        DEDICATED  TO THOSE WHO ENJOY SNUG CLUB ROOMS, THAT THEY MAY LEARN THE ART OF PREPARING FOR THEMSELVES WHAT IS GOOD.  IS IT ANY WONDER THAT MANKIND STANDS OPEN-MOUTHED BEFORE THE BARTENDER, CONSIDERING THE MYSTERIES AND MARVELS OF AN ART THAT BORDERS ON MAGIC? RECIPES FOUND IN THIS BOOK HAVE BEEN COMPOSED AND COLLECTED, TRIED AND TESTED, IN A QUARTER-CENTURY OF EXPERIENCE BY TOM BULLOCK OF THE ST. LOUIS COUNTRY CLUB.     A testimonial from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which appeared in the form of an editorial, Wednesday evening, May 28, 1913, at a time when Col. Roosevelt was vindicating, by a libel suit, his reputation for sobriety and temperance.       Colonel Roosevelt's fatal admission that he drank just a part of one     julep at the St. Louis Country Club will come very near losing his     case.      Who was ever known to drink just a part of one of Tom's? Tom, than     whom there is no greater mixologist of any race, color or condition     of servitude, was taught the art of the julep by no less than Marse     Lilburn G. McNair, the father of the julep. In fact, the very cup     that Col. Roosevelt drank it from belonged to Governor McNair, the     first Governor of Missouri, the great-grandfather of Marse Lilburn     and the great-great-grandfather of the julep.      As is well known, the Country Club mint originally sprang on the     slopes of Parnassus and was transplanted thence to the bosky banks     of Culpeper Creek, Gaines County, Ky., and thence to our own     environs; while the classic distillation with which Tom mingles it     to produce his chief d'oeuvre is the oft-quoted liquefied soul of a     Southern moonbeam falling aslant the dewy slopes of the Cumberland     Mountains.      To believe that a red-blooded man, and a true Colonel at that, ever     stopped with just a part of one of those refreshments which have     made St. Louis hospitality proverbial and become one of our most     distinctive genre institutions, is to strain credulity too far. Are     the Colonel's powers of self restraint altogether transcendent? Have     we found the living superman at last?      When the Colonel says that he consumed just a part of one he     doubtless meant that he did not swallow the Mint itself, munch the     ice and devour the very cup.      INTRODUCTION   I have known the author of \"The Ideal Bartender\" for many years, and it is a genuine privilege to be permitted to testify to his qualifications for such a work.  To his many friends in St. Louis, Louisville, Cincinnati, Chicago and elsewhere, my word will be superfluous, but to those who do not know him, and who are to be the gainers by following his advices, it may prove at the very beginning a stimulus to know something of his record of achievement.  For the past quarter of a century he has refreshed and delighted the members and their friends of the Pendennis Club of Louisville and the St. Louis Country Club of St. Louis. In all that time I doubt if he has erred in even one of his concoctions. Thus if there is \"many a slip twixt the cup and the lip\" it has been none of his doing, but rather the fault of those who have appreciated his art too highly. But why go on! His work is before you. It is the best to be had. Follow on, and as you sip the nectar of his schemings tell your friends, to the end that both they and he may be benefitted.  G. H. WALKER.
