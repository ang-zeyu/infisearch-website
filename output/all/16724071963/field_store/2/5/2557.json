Hymn 1:89. Youth and judgment, Eccles. 11. 9.  1 Ye sons of Adam, vain and young, Indulge your eyes, indulge your tongue, Taste the delight your souls desire, And give a loose to all your fire.  2 Pursue the pleasures ye design, And cheer your hearts with songs and wine, Enjoy the day of mirth; but know There is a day of judgment too.  3 God from on high beholds your thoughts, His book records your secret faults; The works of darkness you have done Must all appear before the sun.  4 The vengeance to your follies due Should strike your hearts with terror thro': How will ye stand before his face, Or answer for his injur'd grace?  5 Almighty God, turn off their eyes From these alluring vanities; And let the thunder of thy word Awake their souls to fear the Lord.   Hymn 1:90. The same.  1 Lo the young tribes of Adam rise, And thro' all nature rove, Fulfil the wishes of their eyes, And taste the joys they love.  2 They give a loose to wild desires, But let the sinners know, The strict account that God requires Of all the works they do.  3 The Judge prepares his throne on high, The frighted earth and seas Avoid the fury of his eye, And flee before his face.  4 How shall I bear that dreadful day, And stand the fiery test? I give all mortal joys away To be for ever blest.   Hymn 1:91. Advice to youth; or, Old age and death in an unconverted state, Eccles. 12. 1 7. Isa. 65. 20.  1 Now in the heat of youthful blood Remember your Creator God, Behold the months come hastening on When you shall say, \"My joys are gone.\"  2 Behold, the aged sinner goes, Laden with guilt and heavy woes Down to the regions of the dead, With endless curses on his head.  3 The dust returns to dust again, The soul in agonies of pain Ascends to God, not there to dwell, But hears her doom, and sinks to hell.  4 Eternal King! I fear thy Name, Teach me to know how frail I am; And when my soul must hence remove, Give me a mansion in thy love.   Hymn 1:92. Christ the wisdom of God, Prov. 8. 1 22-32.  1 Shall wisdom cry aloud And not her speech be heard? The voice of God's eternal word, Deserves it no regard?  2 \"I was his chief delight, \"His everlasting Son, \"Before the first of all his works, \"Creation, was begun.  3 [\"Before the flying clouds, \"Before the solid land, \"Before the fields, before the floods, \"I dwelt at his right hand.  4 \"When he adorn'd the skies, \"And built them I was there \"To order where the sun should rise, \"And marshal every star.  5 \"When he pour'd out the sea, \"And spread the flowing deep, \"I gave the flood a firm decree, \"In its own bounds to keep.]  6 \"Upon the empty air The earth was balanc'd well; \"With joy I saw the mansion where \"The sons of men should dwell.  7 \"My busy thoughts at first \"On their salvation ran, \"Ere sin was born, or Adam's dust \"Was fashioned to a man.  8 \"Then come, receive my grace, \"Ye children, and be wise; \"Happy the man that keeps my ways; \"The man that shuns them dies.\"   Hymn 1:93. Christ, or wisdom, obeyed or resisted, Prov. 8. 31 35 36.  1 Thus saith the wisdom of the Lord, \"Bless'd is the man that hears my word, \"Keeps daily watch before my gates, \"And at my feet for mercy waits.  2 \"The soul that seeks me shall obtain \"Immortal wealth and heavenly gain; \"Immortal life is his reward, \"Life, and the favour of the Lord.  3 \"But the vile wretch that flies from me \"Doth his own soul an injury; Fools that against my grace rebel \"Seek death, and love the road to hell.\"   Hymn 1:94. Justification by faith, not by works; or, The law condemns, grace justifies, Rom. 3. 19-22.  1 Vain are the hopes the sons of men On their own works have built; Their hearts by nature all unclean, And all their actions guilt.  2 Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouths Without a murmuring word, And the whole race of Adam stand Guilty before the Lord.  3 In vain we ask God's righteous law To justify us now, Since to convince and to condemn Is all the law can do.  4 Jesus, how glorious is thy grace, When in thy name we trust, Our faith receives a righteousness That makes the sinner just.   Hymn 1:95. Regeneration, John 1. 13. and 3. 3 &c.  1 Not all the outward forms on earth, Nor rites that God has given, Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth, Can raise a soul to heaven.  2 The sovereign will of God alone Creates us heirs of grace; Born in the image of his Son, A new peculiar race.  3 The Spirit like some heavenly wind Blows on the sons of flesh, New models all the carnal mind, And forms the man afresh.  4 Our quicken'd souls awake, and rise From the long sleep of death; On heavenly things we fix our eyes, And praise employs our breath.   Hymn 1:96. Election excludes boasting, 1 Cor. 1. 26-31.  1 But few among the carnal wise, But few of noble race, Obtain the favour of thine eyes, Almighty King of Grace.  2 He takes the men of meanest name For sons and heirs of God; And thus he pours abundant shame On honourable blood.  3 He calls the fool, and makes him know The mysteries of his grace, To bring aspiring wisdom low, And all its pride abase.  4 Nature has all its glories lost When brought before his throne; No flesh shall in his presence boast But in the Lord alone.   Hymn 1:97. Christ our wisdom, righteousness, &c. 1 Cor. 1. 30.  1 Bury'd in shadows of the night We lie till Christ restores the light: Wisdom descends to heal the blind, And chase the darkness of the mind.  2 Our guilty souls are drown'd in tears Till his atoning blood appears, Then we awake from deep distress, And sing, \"The Lord our Righteousness.\"  3 Our very frame is mix'd with sin, His Spirit makes our natures clean; Such virtues from his sufferings flow, At once to cleanse and pardon too.  4 Jesus beholds where Satan reigns, Binding his slaves in heavy chains; He sets the prisoners free, and breaks The iron bondage from our necks.  5 Poor helpless worms in thee possess Grace, wisdom, power, and righteousness; Thou art our mighty All, and we Give our whole selves, O Lord, to thee.   Hymn 1:98. The same.  1 How heavy is the night That hangs upon our eyes, Till Christ with his reviving light, Over our souls arise!  2 Our guilty spirits dread To meet the wrath of heaven But, in his righteousness array'd, We see our sins forgiven.  3 Unholy and impure Are all our thoughts and ways; His hands infected nature cure With sanctifying grace.  4 The powers of hell agree To hold our souls in vain; He sets the sons of bondage free, And breaks the cursed chain.  5 Lord, we adore thy ways To bring us near to God, Thy sovereign power, thy healing grace, And thine atoning blood.   Hymn 1:99. Stones made children of Abraham; or, Grace not conveyed by religious parents, Matt. 3. 9.  1 Vain are the hopes that rebels place Upon their birth and blood, Descended from a pious race; (Their fathers now with God.)  2 He from the caves of earth and hell Can take the hardest stones, And fill the house of Abra'm well With new-created sons.  3 Such wondrous power doth he possess Who form'd our mortal frame, Who call'd the world from emptiness, The world obey'd and came.   Hymn 1:100. Believe and be saved, John 3. 16 17 18.  1 Not to condemn the sons of men Did Christ, the Son of God, appear; No weapons in his hands are seen, No flaming sword, nor thunder there.  2 Such was the pity of our God, He lov'd the race of man so well, He sent his Son to bear our load Of sins, and save our souls from hell.  3 Sinners, believe the Saviour's word, Trust in his mighty name and live; A thousand joys his lips afford, His hands a thousand blessings give.  4 But vengeance and damnation lies On rebels who refuse the grace; Who God's eternal Son despise The hottest hell shall be their place.   Hymn 1:101. Joy in heaven for a repenting sinner, Luke 15. 7-10.  1 Who can describe the joys that rise Thro' all the courts of Paradise To see a prodigal return, To see an heir of glory born?  2 With joy the Father doth approve The fruit of his eternal love; The Son with joy looks down and sees The purchase of his agonies.  3 The Spirit takes delight to view The holy soul he form'd anew; And saints and angels join to sing The growing empire of their King.   Hymn 1:102. The beatitudes, Matt. 5. 3-12.  1 [Bless'd are the humble souls that see Their emptiness and poverty; Treasures of grace to them are given, And crowns of joy laid up in heaven.]  2 [Bless'd are the men of broken heart, Who mourn for sin with inward smart; The blood of Christ divinely flows, A healing balm for all their woes.]  3 [Bless'd are the meek, who stand afar From rage and passion, noise and war; God will secure their happy state, And plead their cause against the great.]  4 [Bless'd are the souls that thirst for grace, Hunger and long for righteousness, They shall be well supply'd and fed, With living streams and living bread.]  5 [Bless'd are the men whose bowels move And melt with sympathy and love; From Christ the Lord shall they obtain Like sympathy and love again.]  6 [Bless'd are the pure, whose hearts are clean From the defiling powers of sin, With endless pleasure they shall see A God of spotless purity.]  7 [Bless'd are the men of peaceful life Who quench the coals of growing strife, They shall be call'd the heirs of bliss, The sons of God, the God of peace.]  8 [Bless'd are the sufferers who partake Of pain and shame for Jesus' sake; Their souls shall triumph in the Lord, Glory and joy are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13347"],["title","Wildflowers of the Farm (#0)"],["body","Team.

When we were there we went into the farmer's fields in early spring, and saw the men and horses at work with ploughs and harrows. A little later on we saw some of the crops sown, such as barley and turnips. In summer we were in the hay-and corn-fields, and later still we saw the ricks being made.  To-day we are at Willow Farm again, and I want to show you some of the flowers that grow there. I do not mean those which Mrs. Hammond, the farmer's wife, grows in her garden, pretty as they are. We will look rather at the wild flowers in the fields, the hedges, and by the road-side in the lane. No one sows their seed nor takes care of them in any way; yet they grow and blossom year after year, and nearly all of them are beautiful.  Before we begin to look at them we must make sure that we quite understand just what a flower is. Even those of you who live in large towns and have perhaps never been in the country, see flowers of some sort, I feel sure; you see them in shop windows and they are also often sold in the streets. You have seen wallflowers and daffodils in the spring, roses in the summer, violets in winter, as well as other kinds. You do not need to be told that these are flowers.  What about the grass on lawns, and in such places as Battersea Park and Hyde Park in London? \"Oh,\" you say, \"that is not a flower at all--that is just grass.\" Yes, it is grass, but the grass has a flower as well as a rose bush or a violet-plant. It is only because the grass is kept cut short that you do not see its flower on a lawn. If grass is not cut, or eaten by animals, it grows tall in spring; then in May or June you would see the flowers on tall straight stems which stand among the blades of grass. Many of these grass flowers are very beautiful and we will look presently at some of them in one of the farmer's fields.  Perhaps some of you have gardens or grass plots at your own homes. If you see some dandelions in the lawn, or groundsel among the flowers or vegetables in the garden beds, you say, \"Those weeds must be pulled up.\" You call the Dandelion and the Groundsel weeds, but they have flowers all the same; the Dandelion is perhaps one of the most lovely yellow flowers that we have.  They are weeds certainly in your lawn or garden beds, for they ought not to be there. Weeds are plants in the wrong place. By and by, in the farmer's fields, we shall see many pretty flowers which he calls weeds. We speak of the Nettle as a weed, and do not usually admire it; yet the Nettle has a flower, as we shall see.  Then what do you think of a tree having a flower? That is perhaps a new idea to you. Yet if you look at a Horse-chestnut tree in June you will see at once the large spikes of beautiful white flowers with which it is covered. Apple trees have a beautiful pink, or pink and white flower, and the Almond tree bears a lovely pink flower. All other trees have flowers too, but they are often small. The flowers of the Oak and the Beech are small, but, though you may not notice them, they are on the tree each spring.  Almost all plants, including large trees, have flowers--they are flowering plants. Just a few plants have no flower; ferns have none, nor have the mosses and lichens which grow on walls and rocks and on the stems of trees. Fungi, too, such as the mushroom, have no flowers. Nearly all other plants have flowers. It is by the flower or blossom that a plant is reproduced. After the flower has faded comes the fruit and seed; the seed falls into the ground or is sown, and from it springs another plant. Without the flower there would be no seed.  You see that there are rather more flowers than you had thought. Still, while we are strolling in the fields and lanes at Willow Farm, we shall look most at what are generally called flowers; we shall look at comparatively small plants in which the flower or blossom is easily noticed because it is large, or bright-coloured, or sweet-scented. But while we are admiring a Daisy or a Dandelion in the spring, we must not forget that the great Oak-tree above it also has a flower of its own--we must remember that the Oak-tree also is a flowering plant.     CHAPTER II  IN THE COPPICE   Outside the front door of Willow Farm is a broad curving gravel drive, at the far end of which a white gate opens into the lane. On one side of this drive is a narrow strip of ground planted with flowers and shrubs, and close to the front door there is a patch of grass on which stands a large old mulberry tree.  On the other side of the drive is a lawn. Beyond that are more flowers and then the vegetable garden; further on still is a little wood or coppice of nut bushes. On this March morning we shall find some wild flowers in this little wood.  Between the vegetable garden and the wood is a low grassy bank. It is bright to-day with yellow primroses. The Primrose always blossoms early here, for the bank is sunny and is sheltered from cold winds.  [Illustration: PRIMROSE.]  I daresay most of you have seen a Primrose before to-day. Each pale yellow blossom is made up of five petals, which are joined together forming a tube or corolla. The petals are notched or indented on the outer edge. At the centre of the blossom, where the petals meet, each petal is marked with a spot of darker yellow. Each flower grows alone on a long slender stem. At the top of the stem is a kind of green tube out of which the yellow blossom appears. The Primrose blossoms have a scent; not strong, but very sweet and pleasant.  The leaves are called \"radical\" or \"root\" leaves. They are so called because each leaf _appears_ to grow direct from the root. But the leaves really grow from a short stem at the top of the root--a stem so short that it does not appear above the ground at all.  Among the bushes of the coppice itself we will notice the flowers which first catch our eye--the pretty blossoms of the Wood Anemone. The whole coppice is starred with the beautiful white flowers. We pick one and see that it has six--six what? \"Six petals,\" you say. No, these are not petals, for the Anemone has none. They are sepals. The sepals of a plant generally enclose the blossom before it is opened, and they are usually green. In the Anemone the petals are absent; the sepals take their place and are white instead of green. Their under side is often not pure white, but is streaked with pale pink.  Several blossoms which we pick have six of these sepals. That is the usual number, but sometimes there are only five, and sometimes more than six.  The blossoms of the Anemone grow on longer and stronger stalks than those of the Primrose, and on each stalk are three leaves. These leaves grow round the stalk in a ring. Each leaf is \"tri-partite\"--in three parts or divisions; the edges of these divided leaves are deeply serrated. Besides the three leaves on each flower-stalk similar leaves grow from underground stems which creep along not far below the surface of the soil. Such creeping underground stems are usually called \"rhizomes.\"  At the further side of the coppice, where a hedge separates it from the little meadow called Home Close, are Sweet Violets. We catch their fragrant scent before we see them, for the tiny flowers are half hidden among broad green leaves. Each blossom has five petals of a dark purple colour; there are white Sweet Violets too, but none are growing in our little wood to-day.  At the base of the blossom--the part where it joins the stem--one of the petals has a little spur which points back towards the stem. The blossom is therefore said to be spurred; we may presently see other plants with spurred flowers.  There is another violet which grows wild in England--the Dog Violet. It is larger than our Sweet Violets here, but it has no scent.  [Illustration: ANEMONE.]  While we have been examining the flowers on the ground, the nut bushes above our heads are waiting to remind us of what we said just now--that trees also have flowers. The flowers of the nut bush or hazel are easily seen, for they appear before the leaves are open. What we see to-day are often called catkins, but the name which country children give them is lambs'-tails. It is a very good name, too, for they are more like the tail of some tiny lamb than anything else.  These catkins are yellowish-white in colour, and soft and almost woolly to the touch. They hang in clusters from the hazel twigs, and in the strong March wind which blows to-day, they shake and flutter like the tails of lambs at play. Some of them leave a dusty powder on our fingers when we handle them; that is the pollen of the flower.  It is not where these yellow \"catkins\" are dancing on the twigs to-day that the hazel nuts will appear in autumn. The nuts will grow on twigs where there are very small red flowers--something like tiny paint-brushes. These are the female flowers; they will be fertilized by the yellow pollen of the catkins, and will produce the nuts.     CHAPTER III  FLOWERS ON THE WALLS   Behind the narrow strip of ground with flowers and shrubs on the other side of the drive there is a low stone wall. A piece of the lawn on which the mulberry tree stands has been cut away, and a flight of steps leads down to a little gate into the foldyard.  This wall between the garden and the foldyard is very old and rough--not like the smooth brick walls you see in towns. The stones are of different shapes and sizes, the mortar has fallen out of it in "]]]
