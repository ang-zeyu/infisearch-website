THIEF I could only procure you three green raiments, Master. The city is not now well supplied with them; moreover it is a very suspicious city, and without shame for the baseness of its suspicions.  SLAG (to a beggar) This is not thieving.  THIEF I could do no more, Master. I have not practised thieving all my life.  AGMAR You have got something: it may serve our purpose. How long have you been thieving?  THIEF I stole first when I was ten.  SLAG When he was ten!  AGMAR We must tear them up and divide them amongst the seven. (to Thahn) Bring me another beggar.  SLAG When my Master was ten he had already had to slip by night out of two cities.  OOGNO (admiringly) Out of two cities!  SLAG (nodding his head) In his native city they do not now know what became of the golden cup that stood in the Lunar Temple.  AGMAR Yes, into seven pieces.  ULF We will each wear a piece of it over our rags.  OOGNO Yes, yes, we shall look fine.  AGMAR That is not the way that we shall disguise ourselves.  OOGNO Not cover our rags?  AGMAR No, no. The first who looked closely would say 'These are only beggars. They have disguised themselves.'  ULF What shall we do?  AGMAR Each of the seven shall wear a piece of the green raiment underneath his rags. And peradventure here and there a little shall show through; and men shall say 'These seven have disguised themselves as beggars. But we know not what they be.'  SLAG Hear my wise Master.  OOGNO (in admiration) _He_ is a beggar.  ULF He is an _old_ beggar.    ACT II  SCENE: The Metropolitan Hall of the city of Kongros. Citizens, etc. Enter the seven beggars with green silk under their rags.   OORANDER Who are you and whence come you?  AGMAR Who may say what we are or whence we come?  OORANDER What are these beggars and why do they come here?  AGMAR Who said to you that we were beggars?  OORANDER Why do these men come here?  AGMAR Who said to you that we were men?  ILLANAUN Now, by the moon!  AGMAR My sister.  ILLANAUN What?  AGMAR My little sister.  SLAG Our little sister the Moon. She comes to us at evenings away in the mountain of Marma. She trips over the mountains when she is young: when she is young and slender she comes and dances before us: and when she is old and unshapely she hobbles away from the hills.  AGMAR Yet she is young again and forever nimble with youth: yet she comes dancing back. The years are not able to curb her nor to bring grey hairs to her brethren.  OORANDER This is not wonted.  ILLANAUN It is not in accordance with custom.  AKMOS Prophecy hath not thought it.  SLAG She comes to us new and nimble remembering olden loves.  OORANDER It were well that prophets should come and speak to us.  ILLANAUN This hath not been in the past. Let prophets come; let prophets speak to us of future things. (The beggars seat themselves upon the floor in the attitude of the seven gods of Marma.)  CITIZEN I heard men speak to-day in the market-place. They speak of a prophecy read somewhere of old. It says the seven gods shall come from Marma in the guise of men.  ILLANAUN Is this a true prophecy?  OORANDER It is all the prophecy we have. Man without prophecy is like a sailor going by night over uncharted seas. He knows not where are the rocks nor where the havens. To the man on watch all things ahead are black and the stars guide him not, for he knows not what they are.  ILLANAUN Should we not investigate this prophecy?  OORANDER Let us accept it. It is as the small uncertain light of a lantern, carried it may be by a drunkard but along the shore of some haven. Let us be guided.  AKMOS It may be that they are but benevolent gods.  AGMAR There is no benevolence greater than our benevolence.  ILLANAUN _Then_ we need do little: they portend no danger to us.  AGMAR There is no anger greater than our anger.  OORANDER Let us make sacrifice to them, if they be gods.  AKMOS We humbly worship you, if ye be gods.  ILLANAUN (kneeling too) You are mightier than all men and hold high rank among other gods and are lords of this our city, and have the thunder as your plaything and the whirlwind and the eclipse and all the destinies of human tribes, if ye be gods.  AGMAR Let the pestilence not fall at once upon this city, as it had indeed designed to; let not the earthquake swallow it all immediately up amid the howls of the thunder; let not infuriate armies overwhelm those that escape if we be gods.  POPULACE (in horror) If we be gods!  OORANDER Come let us sacrifice.  ILLANAUN Bring lambs.  AKMOS Quick, quick. (Exit some.)  SLAG (with solemn air) This god is a very divine god.  THAHN He is no common god.  MLAN Indeed he has made us.  CITIZEN (A WOMAN) (to Slag) He will not punish us, Master? None of the gods will punish us? We will make a sacrifice, a good sacrifice.  ANOTHER We will sacrifice a lamb that the priests have blessed.  FIRST CITIZEN Master, you are not wroth with us?  SLAG Who may say what cloudy dooms are rolling up in the mind of the eldest of the gods. He is no common god like us. Once a shepherd went by him in the mountains and doubted as he went. He sent a doom after that shepherd.  CITIZEN Master, we have not doubted.  SLAG _And the doom found him on the hills at evening._  SECOND CITIZEN It shall be a good sacrifice, Master. (Re-enter with a dead lamb and fruits. They offer the lamb on an altar where there is fire, and fruits before the altar.)  THAHN (stretching out a hand to a lamb upon an altar.) That leg is not being cooked at all.  ILLANAUN It is strange that gods should be thus anxious about the cooking of a leg of lamb.  OORANDER It is strange certainly.  ILLANAUN Almost I had said that it was a man spoke then.  OORANDER (Stroking his beard and regarding the second beggar.) Strange. Strange certainly.  AGMAR Is it then strange that the gods love roasted flesh? For this purpose they keep the lightning. When the lightning flickers about the limbs of men there comes to the gods in Marma a pleasant smell, even a smell of roasting. Sometimes the gods, being pacific, are pleased to have roasted instead the flesh of lamb. It is all one to the gods: let the roasting stop.  OORANDER No, no, gods of the mountain!  OTHERS No, no.  OORANDER Quick, let us offer the flesh to them. If they eat all is well. (They offer it, the beggars eat, all but Agmar who watches.)  ILLANAUN One who was ignorant, one who did not know, had almost said that they ate like hungry men.  OTHERS Hush.  AKMOS Yet they look as though they had not had a meal like this for a long time.  OORANDER They _have_ a hungry look.  AGMAR (who has not eaten) I have not eaten since the world was very new and the flesh of men was tenderer than now. These younger gods have learned the habit of eating from the lions.  OORANDER O oldest of divinities, partake, partake.  AGMAR It is not fitting that such as I should eat. None eat but beasts and men and the younger gods. The Sun and the Moon and the nimble Lightning and I, we may kill, and we may madden, but we do not eat.  AKMOS If he but eat of our offering he cannot overwhelm us.  ALL O ancient deity, partake, partake.  AGMAR Enough. Let it be enough that these have condescended to this bestial and human habit.  ILLANAUN (to Akmos) And yet he is not unlike a beggar whom I saw not so long since.  OORANDER But beggars eat.  ILLANAUN Now I never knew a beggar yet who would refuse a bowl of Woldery wine.  AKMOS This is no beggar.  ILLANAUN Nevertheless let us offer him a bowl of Woldery wine.  AKMOS You do wrong to doubt him.  ILLANAUN I do but wish to prove his divinity. I will fetch the Woldery wine. (Exit)  AKMOS He will not drink. Yet if he does, then he will not overwhelm us. Let us offer him the wine.  (Re-enter Illanaun with a goblet.)  FIRST BEGGAR It is Woldery wine!  SECOND BEGGAR It is Woldery!  THIRD BEGGAR A goblet of Woldery wine!  FOURTH BEGGAR O blessed day!  MLAN O happy times!  SLAG O my wise Master! (All the Beggars stretch out their hands, including Agmar. Illanaun gives it to Agmar. Agmar takes it solemnly, and very carefully pours it upon the ground.)  FIRST BEGGAR He has spilt it.  SECOND BEGGAR He has spilt it. (Agmar sniffs the fumes.)  AGMAR It is a fitting libation. Our anger is somewhat appeased.  ANOTHER BEGGAR But it was Woldery!  AKMOS (kneeling to Agmar) Master, I am childless, and I....  AGMAR Trouble us not now. It is the hour at which the gods are accustomed to speak to the gods in the language of the gods, and if Man heard us he would guess the futility of his destiny, which were not well for Man. Begone! Begone! (Exeunt all but one who lingers.)  ONE Master....  AGMAR Begone! (exit one) (Agmar takes up a piece of meat and begins to eat it: the beggars rise and stretch themselves: they laugh, but Agmar eats hungrily.)  OOGNO Ah, now we have come into our own.  THAHN Now we have alms.  SLAG Master! My wise Master!  ULF These are the good days, the good days; and yet I have a fear.  SLAG What do you fear? There is nothing to fear. No man is as wise as my Master.  ULF I fear the gods whom we pretend to be.  SLAG The gods?  AGMAR (taking a chunk of meat from his lips) Come hither, Slag.  SLAG (going up to him) Yes, Master.  AGMAR Watch in the doorway while I eat. (Slag goes to the doorway) Sit in the attitude of a god. Warn me if any of the citizens approach. (Slag sits in the doorway in the attitude of a god, back to the audience)  OOGNO (to Agmar) But, Master, shall we not have Woldery wine?  AGMAR We shall have all things if only we are wise at first for a little.  THAHN Master, do any suspect us?  AGMAR We must be _very_ wise.  THAHN But if we are not wise, Master?  AGMAR Why then death may come to us ...  THAHN O Master!  AGMAR ... slowly. (All stir uneasily except Slag motionless in the doorway.)  OOGNO Do they believe us, master?  SLAG (half turning his head) Someone comes. (Slag resumes his position.)  AGMAR (putting away his meat) We shall soon know now. (All take up the attitude. Enter one.)

ONE Master, my child was bitten in the throat by a death-adder at noon. Spare him, Master; he still breathes, but slowly.  AGMAR Is he indeed your child?  ONE He is surely my child, Master.  AGMAR Was it your wont to thwart him in his play, while he was strong and well?  ONE I never thwarted him, Master.  AGMAR Whose child is Death?  ONE Death is the child of the gods.  AGMAR Do you that never thwarted your child in his play ask this of the gods?  ONE (with some horror, perceiving Agmar's meaning) Master!  AGMAR Weep not. For all the houses that men have builded are the play-fields of this child of the gods. (The man goes away in silence not weeping.)  OOGNO (Taking Thahn by the wrist) Is this indeed a man?  AGMAR A man, a man, and until just now a hungry one.    ACT III  Same room. A few days have elapsed. Seven thrones shaped like mountain-crags stand along the back of the stage. On these the beggars are lounging. The Thief is absent.   MLAN Never had beggars such a time.  OOGNO Ah, the fruits and tender lamb!  THAHN The Woldery wine!  SLAG It was better to see my Master's wise devices than to have fruit and lamb and Woldery wine.  MLAN Ah, when they spied on him to see if he would eat when they went away!  OOGNO When they questioned him concerning the gods and Man!  THAHN When they asked him why the gods permitted cancer!  SLAG Ah! My wise Master.  MLAN How well his scheme has succeeded.  OOGNO How far away is hunger!  THAHN It is even like to one of last year's dreams, the trouble of a brief night long ago.  MLAN Ho, ho, ho, to see them pray to us!  AGMAR (sternly) When we were beggars did we not speak as beggars? Did we not whine as they? Was not our mien beggarly?  MLAN We were the pride of our calling.  AGMAR (sternly) Then now that we are gods let us _be_ as gods, and not mock our worshippers.  ULF I think the gods _do_ mock their worshippers.  AGMAR The gods have never mocked _us_. We are above all pinnacles that we have ever gazed at in dreams.  ULF I think that when Man is high then most of all are the gods wont to mock him. (Enter Thief)  THIEF Master, I have been with those that see all and know all, I have been with the thieves, Master. They know me for one of the craft, but they do not know me as being one of us.  AGMAR Well, well ...  THIEF There is danger, Master, there is great danger.  AGMAR You mean that they suspect that we are men?  THIEF That they have long done, Master. I mean that they will know it. Then we are lost.  AGMAR Then they do not know it?  THIEF They do not know it yet, but they will know it, and we are lost.  AGMAR When will they know it?  THIEF Three days ago they suspected us.  AGMAR More than you think suspected us, but have any dared to say so?  THIEF No, Master.  AGMAR Then forget your fears, my thief.  THIEF Two men went on dromedaries three days ago to see if the gods were still at Marma.  AGMAR They went to Marma!  THIEF Yes, three days ago.  OOGNO We are lost.  AGMAR They went three days ago?  THIEF Yes, on dromedaries.  AGMAR They should be back to-day.  OOGNO We are lost.  THAHN We are lost.  THIEF They must have seen the green jade idols sitting against the mountains. They will say, 'The gods are still at Marma.' And we shall be burnt.  SLAG My Master will yet devise a plan.  AGMAR (to the Thief) Slip away to some high place and look towards the desert and see how long we have to devise a plan. (Exit Thief.)  SLAG My Master will devise a plan.  OOGNO He has taken us into a trap.  THAHN His wisdom is our doom.  SLAG He will find a wise plan yet. (Re-enter Thief.)  THIEF It is too late.  AGMAR It is too late?  THIEF The dromedary men are here.  OOGNO We are lost.  AGMAR Be silent! I must think. (They all sit still. Citizens enter and prostrate themselves. Agmar sits deep in thought.)  ILLANAUN (to Agmar) Two holy pilgrims have gone to your sacred shrines, wherein you were wont to sit before you left the mountains. (Agmar says nothing) They return even now.  AGMAR They left us here and went to find the gods. A fish once took a journey into a far country to find the sea.  ILLANAUN Most reverend Deity, their piety is so great that they have gone to worship even your shrines.  AGMAR I know these men that have great piety. Such men have often prayed to me before, but their prayers are not acceptable. They little love the gods, their only care is their piety. I know these pious ones. They will say that the seven gods were still at Marma. So shall they seem more pious to you all, pretending that they alone have seen the gods. Fools shall believe them and share in their damnation.  OORANDER (to Illanaun) Hush. You anger the gods.  ILLANAUN I am not sure whom I anger.  OORANDER It may be they are the gods.  ILLANAUN Where are these men from Marma?  CITIZEN Here are the dromedary men, they are coming now.  ILLANAUN (to Agmar) The holy pilgrims from your shrine are come to worship you.  AGMAR The men are doubters. How the gods hate the word! Doubt ever contaminated virtue. Let them be cast into prison and not besmirch your purity, (rising) Let them not enter here.  ILLANAUN But O most reverened Deity from the mountain, we also doubt, most reverend Deity.  AGMAR You have chosen. You have chosen. And yet it is not too late. Repent and cast these men in prison and it may not be too late. _The gods have never wept_. And yet when they think upon damnation and the dooms that are withering a myriad bones, then almost, were they not divine, they _could_ weep. Be quick. Repent of your doubt.  ILLANAUN Most reverend Deity, it is a mighty doubt.  CITIZENS _Nothing has killed him! They are not the gods_!  SLAG (to Agmar) You have a plan, my Master. You have a plan?  AGMAR Not yet, Slag. (Enter the dromedary men.)  ILLANAUN (to Oorander) These are the men that went to the shrines at Marma.  OORANDER (in a loud, clear voice) Were the gods of the mountain seated still at Marma, or were they not there? (The beggars get up hurriedly from their thrones.)  DROMEDARY MAN They were not there.  ILLANAUN They were not there?  DROMEDARY MAN Their shrines were empty.  OORANDER Behold the gods of the mountain!  AKMOS They have indeed come from Marma.  OORANDER Come. Let us go away to prepare a sacrifice, a mighty sacrifice to atone for our doubting. (Exeunt.)  SLAG My most wise Master!  AGMAR No, no, Slag. I do not know what has befallen. When I went by Marma only two weeks ago the idols of green jade were still seated there.  OOGNO We are saved now.  THAHN Aye, we are saved.  AGMAR We are saved, but I know not how.  OOGNO _Never_ had beggars such a time.  THIEF I will go out and watch. (He creeps out.)  ULF Yet I have a fear.  OOGNO A fear? Why, we are saved.  ULF Last night I dreamed.  OOGNO What was your dream?  ULF It was nothing. I dreamed that I was thirsty and one gave me Woldery wine; yet there was a fear in my dream.  THAHN When I drink Woldery wine I am afraid of nothing. (Re-enter Thief.)  THIEF They are making a pleasant banquet ready for us; they are killing lambs, and girls are there with fruits, and there is to be much Woldery wine.  MLAN Never had beggars such a time.  AGMAR Do any doubt us now?  THIEF I do not know.  MLAN When will the banquet be?  THIEF When the stars come out.  OOGNO Ah. It is sunset already. There will be good eating.  THAHN We shall see the girls come in with baskets upon their heads.  OOGNO There will be fruits in the baskets.  THAHN All the fruits of the valley.  MLAN Ah, how long we have wandered along the ways of the world.  SLAG Ah, how hard they were.  THAHN And how dusty.  OOGNO And how little wine.  MLAN How long we have asked and asked, and for how much!  AGMAR We to whom all things are coming now at last.  THIEF I fear lest my art forsake me now that good things come without stealing.  AGMAR You will need your art no longer.  SLAG The wisdom of my Master shall suffice us all our days. (Enter a frightened man. He kneels before Agmar and abases his forehead.)  MAN Master, we implore you, the people beseech you. (Agmar and the beggars in the attitude of the gods sit silent.)  MAN Master, it is terrible. (The beggars maintain silence) It is terrible when you wander in the evening. It is terrible on the edge of the desert in the evening. Children die when they see you.  AGMAR In the desert? When did you see us?  MAN Last night, Master. You were terrible last night. You were terrible in the gloaming. When your hands were stretched out and groping. You were feeling for the city.  AGMAR Last night do you say?  MAN You were terrible in the gloaming!  AGMAR You yourself saw us?  MAN Yes, Master, you were terrible. Children too saw you and they died.  AGMAR You say you saw us?  MAN Yes, Master. Not as you are now, but otherwise. We implore you, Master, not to wander at evening. You are terrible in the gloaming. You are....  AGMAR You say we appeared not as we are now. How did we appear to you?  MAN Otherwise, Master, otherwise.  AGMAR But how _did_ we appear to you?  MAN You were all green, Master, all green in the gloaming, all of rock again as you used to be in the mountains. Master, we can bear to see you in flesh like men, but when we see rock walking it is terrible, it is terrible.  AGMAR That is how we appeared to you?  MAN Yes, Master. Rock should not walk. When children see it they do not understand. Rock should not walk in the evening.  AGMAR There have been doubters of late. Are they satisfied?  MAN Master, they are terrified. Spare us, Master.  AGMAR It is wrong to doubt. Go, and be faithful. (Exit Man.)  SLAG What have they seen, Master?  AGMAR They have seen their own fears dancing in the desert. They have seen something green after the light was gone, and some child has told them a tale that it was us. I do not know what they have seen. What should they have seen?  ULF Something was coming this way from the desert, he said.  SLAG What should come from the desert?  AGMAR They are a foolish"]]]
