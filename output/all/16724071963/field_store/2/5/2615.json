Song 6. Good resolutions. 7,8,7,8  Though I'm now in younger days, Nor can tell what shall befall me, I'll prepare for every place Where my growing age shall call me.  Should I e'er be rich or great, Others shall partake my goodness: I'll supply the poor with meat, Never showing scorn or rudeness.  Where I see the blind or lame, Deaf or dumb, I'll kindly treat them: I deserve to feel the same, If I mock, or hurt, or cheat them.  If I meet with railing tongues, Why should I return them railing, Since I best revenge my wrongs By my patience never failing?  When I hear them telling lies, Talking foolish, cursing, swearing, First I'll try to make them wise, Or I'll soon go out of hearing.  What though I be low or mean, I'll engage the rich to love me, While I'm modest, neat, and clean, And submit when they reprove me.  If I should be poor and sick, I shall meet, I hope, with pity; Since I love to help the weak, Though they're neither fair nor witty.  I'll not willingly offend, Nor be easily offended: What's amiss I'll strive to mend, And endure what can't be mended.  May I be so watchful still O'er my humours and my passion, As to speak and do no ill, Though it should be all the fashion.  Wicked fashions lead to hell; Ne'er may I be found complying; But in life behave so well, Not to be afraid of dying.   Song 7. Summer's evening. 11,11,11,9  How fine has the day been! how bright was the sun! How lovely and joyful the course that he run; Though he rose in a mist when his race he begun, And there followed some droppings of rain: But now the fair traveller's come to the west, His rays are all gold, and his beauties are best; He paints the skies gay as he sinks to his rest, And foretells a bright rising again.  Just such is the Christian. His course he begins Like the sun in a mist, while he mourns for his sins, And melts into tears! then he breaks out and shines, And travels his heavenly way: But when he comes nearer to finish his race, Like a fine setting sun, he looks richer in grace; And gives a sure hope, at the end of his days, Of rising in brighter array.   Song 8. Cradle hymn. 8,7,8,7  Hush, my dear! Lie still, and slumber! Holy angels guard thy bed! Heavenly blessings, without number, Gently falling on thy head.  Sleep, my babe! thy food and raiment, House and home, thy friends provide; All without thy care or payment, All thy wants are well supplied.  How much better thou'rt attended Than the Son of God could be, When from heaven he descended, And became a child like thee!  Soft and easy is thy cradle: Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay, When his birthplace was a stable, And his softest bed was hay.  Blessed Babe! what glorious features,-- Spotless fair, divinely bright! Must he dwell with brutal creatures? How could angels bear the sight?  Was there nothing but a manger Cursed sinners could afford, To receive the heavenly stranger? Did they thus affront the Lord?  Soft, my child! I did not chide thee, Though my song might sound too hard: 'Tis thy mother sits beside thee, And her arm shall be thy guard.  Yet to read the shameful story. How the Jews received their King, How they served the Lord of Glory, Makes me angry while I sing.  See the kinder shepherds round him, Telling wonders from the sky! Where hey sought him, there they found him, With his Virgin-mother by.  See the lovely Babe a-dressing: Lovely infant, how he smiled! When he wept, his mother's blessing Sooth'd and hush'd the holy Child.  Lo, he slumbers in a manger, Where the horned oxen fed!-- Peace, my darling, here's no danger: There's no ox a-near thy bed.  'Twas so save thee, child, from dying, Save my dear from burning flame, Bitter groans and endless crying, That thy blest Redeemer came.  May'st thou live to know and fear him, Trust and love him all thy days, Then go dwell for ever near him: See his face, and sing his praise!  I could give thee thousand kisses! Hoping what I most desire, Not a mother's fondest wishes Can to greater joys aspire!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],["title","Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#0)"],["body","ON HEALTH  THE SCIENCE OF EUGENICS          *       *       *       *       *    A Guide to Purity and Physical Manhood   Advice to Maiden, Wife and Mother   Love, Courtship, and Marriage          *       *       *       *       *   By  PROF.

[Illustration: \"Search Me. Oh Thou Great Creator.\"]          *       *       *       *       *  KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY.   1. The old maxim, that \"Knowledge is power,\" is a true one, but there is still a greater truth: \"KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY.\" Safety amid physical ills that beset mankind, and safety amid the moral pitfalls that surround so many young people, is the great crying demand of the age.  2. CRITICISM.--This work, though plain and to some extent startling, is chaste, practical and to the point, and will be a boon and a blessing to thousands who consult its pages. The world is full of ignorance, and the ignorant will always criticise, because they live to suffer ills, for they know no better. New light is fast falling upon the dark corners, and the eyes of many are being opened.  3. RESEARCHES OF SCIENCE.--The researches of science in the past few years have thrown light on many facts relating to the physiology of man and woman, and the diseases to which they are subject, and consequently many reformations have taken place in the treatment and prevention of diseases peculiar to the sexes.  4. LOCK AND KEY.--Any information bearing upon the diseases of mankind should not be kept under lock and key. The physician is frequently called upon to speak in plain language to his patients upon some private and startling disease contracted on account of ignorance. The better plan, however, is to so educate and enlighten old and young upon the important subjects of health, so that the necessity to call a physician may occur less frequently.  5. PROGRESSION.--A large, respectable, though diminishing class in every community, maintain that nothing that relates exclusively to either sex should become the subject of popular medical instruction. But such an opinion is radically wrong; ignorance is no more the mother of purity than it is of religion. Enlightenment can never work injustice to him who investigates.  6. AN EXAMPLE.--The men and women who study and practice medicine are not the worse, but the better for such knowledge; so it would be to the community in general if all would be properly instructed on the laws of health which relate to the sexes.  7. CRIME AND DEGRADATION.--Had every "]]]
