He said yer never licked the boys; and he said, when the 'nifty' little girls come to git in, with their white aprons, yer said there warn't no room; but when the dirty chaps with tored close come, yer said yer'd _make_ room. Jim said as how yer'd never show _me_ the door, sure.\" (Bless Jim's heart!) \"P'raps I can't come every day, yer know, 'cos I might have fits.\"  \"Fits! Good gracious, child! What makes you think that?\"  \"Oh, I has 'em\" (composedly). \"I kicks the footboard clean off when I has 'em bad, all along o' my losin' them three year! Why, yer got an orgind, hain't yer? Where's the handle fur to make it go? Couldn't I blow it for yer?\"  \"It's a piano, not an organ; it doesn't need blowing.\"  \"Oh, yes, I see one in a s'loon; I seen such an orful pretty lady play on one. She give her silk dress a _swish_ to one side, so! and then she cocked her head over sideways like a bird, and then her hands, all jinglin' over with rings, went a-whizzin' up and down them black and white teeth just like sixty!\"  \"You know, Patsy, I can't bear to have my little Kindergarten boys stand around the saloon doors; it isn't a good place, and if you want to be good men you must learn to be good little boys first, don't you see?\"  \"Well, I wanted some kind of fun. I seen a cirkis wunst,--that was fun! I seen it through a hole; it takes four bits to git inside the tent, and me and another feller found a big hole and went halveys on it. First he give a peek, and then I give a peek, and he was bigger'n me, and he took orful long peeks, he did, 'nd when it come my turn the ladies had just allers jumped _through_ the hoops, or the horses was gone out; 'nd bimeby he said mebbe we might give the hole a stretch and make it a little mite bigger, it wouldn't do no harm, 'nd I'd better cut it, 'cos his fingers was lame; 'nd I just cutted it a little mite, 'n' a cop come up behind and h'isted us and I never seen no more cirkis; but I went to Sunday-school wunst, and it warn't so much fun as the cirkis!\"  I thought I would not begin moral lectures at once, but seize a more opportune time to compare the relative claims of Sunday-school and circus.  \"You've got things fixed up mighty handy here, haven't yer? It's most as good as Woodward's Gardens,--fishes--'nd c'nary birds--'nd flowers--'nd pictures--is there stories to any of 'em?\"  \"Stories to every single one, Patsy! We've just turned that corner by the little girl feeding chickens, and to-morrow we shall begin on that splendid dog by the window.\"  Patsy's face was absolutely radiant with excitement. \"Jiminy! I'm glad I got in in time for that!--'nd ain't that a bear by the door thar?\"  \"Yes; that's a mother bear with cubs.\"  \"Has he got a story too?\"  \"Everything has a story in this room.\"  \"Jiminy! 'ts lucky I didn't miss that one! There's a splendid bear in a s'loon on Fourth Street,--mebbe the man would leave him go a spell if you told him what a nice place you hed up here. Say, them fishes keep it up lively, don't they?--s'pose they're playin' tag?\"  \"I shouldn't wonder,\" I said smilingly; \"it looks like it. Now, Patsy, I must be going home, but you shall come to-morrow, at nine o'clock surely, remember! and the children will be so glad to have another little friend. You'll dress yourself nice and clean, won't you?\"  \"Well, I should smile! but these is the best I got. I got another part to this hat, though, and another pocket belongs with these britches.\" (He alternated the crown and rim of a hat, but was never extravagant enough to wear them at one time.) \"Ain't I clean? I cleaned myself by the feelin'!\"  \"Here's a glass, dear; how do you think you succeeded?\"  \"Jiminy! I didn't get much of a sweep on that, did I now? But don't you fret, I've got the lay of it now, and I'll just polish her off red-hot to-morrer, 'n don't you forgit it!\"  \"Patsy, here's a warm bun and a glass of milk; let's eat and drink together, because this is the beginning of our friendship; but please don't talk street words to Miss Kate; she doesn't like them. I'll do everything I can to make you have a good time, and you'll try to do a few things to please me, won't you?\"  Patsy looked embarrassed, ate his bit of bun in silence, and after twirling his hat-crown for a few seconds hitched out of the door with a backward glance and muttered remark which must have been intended for farewell.     CHAPTER III.  TWO 'PRENTICE HANDS AT PHILANTHROPY.      \"With aching hands and bleeding feet,      We dig and heap, lay stone on stone;      We bear the burden and the heat      Of the long day and wish 't were done.      Not till the hours of light return      All we have built do we discern.\"   Patsy had scarcely gone when the door opened again the least bit, and a sunny face looked in, that of my friend and helper.  \"Not gone yet, Kate?\"  \"No, but I thought I sent you away long ago.\"  \"Yes, I know, but I've been to see Danny Kern's mother: there is nothing to be done; we must do our best and leave it there. Was that a boy I met on the stairs?\"  \"Yes,--that is, he is a boy in the sense that he is not a girl. Oh, Helen, such a story! We must take him!\"  She sank helplessly on one of the children's tables. \"Now, my dear guide, philosopher, and friend, did you happen to notice my babies this morning? They were legion! Our mothers must have heard that the Flower Mission intended giving us some Thanksgiving dinners, for there were our five inevitable little cat's-paws,--the identical five that applied just before the Christmas tree, disappeared in vacation, turned up the day before we went to the Mechanics' Fair, were lost to sight the day after, presented themselves previous to the Woodward's Garden expedition, and then went into retirement till to-day. Where am I going to 'sit' another child, pray? They were two in a seat and a dozen on the floor this morning. It isn't fair to them, in one sense, for they don't get half enough attention.\"  \"You are right, dear; work half done is worse than wasted; but it isn't fair to this child to leave him where he is.\"  \"Oh, I know. I feel Fridayish, to tell the truth. I shall love humanity again by Monday. Have we money for more chairs or benches?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"You'll have to print an appeal for chairs; and the children may wear out the floor sitting on it before the right people read it!\"  \"Yes; and oh, Helen, a printed appeal is such a dead thing, after all. If I could only fix on a printed page Danny Kern's smile when he conquered his temper yesterday, put into type that hand clasp of Mrs. Finnigan's that sent such a thrill of promise to our hearts, show a subscriber Mrs. Guinee's quivering lips when she thanked us for the change in Joe,--why, we shouldn't need money very long.\"  \"That is true. What a week we have had, Kate,--like a little piece of the millennium!\"  \"You must not be disappointed if next week isn't as good; that could hardly be. Let's see,--Mrs. Daniels began it on Monday morning, didn't she, by giving the caps for the boys?\"  \"Yes,\" groaned Helen dismally, \"a generous but misguided benefactress! Forty-three caps precisely alike save as to size! What scenes of carnage we shall witness when we distribute them three times a day!\"  \"We must remedy that by sewing labels into the crowns, each marked with the child's name in indelible ink.\"  \"Exactly,--what a charming task! I shall have to write my cherubs' names, I suppose,--most of them will take a yard of tape apiece. I already recall Paulina Strozynski, Mercedes McGafferty, and Sigismund Braunschweiger.\"  \"And I, Maria Virginia de Rejas Perkins, Halfdan Christiansen, and Americo Vespucci Garibaldi.\"  \"This is our greatest misfortune since the donation of the thirty-seven little red plaid shawls. Well, good-night. By the way, what's his name?\"  \"Patsy Dennis. I shall take him. I'll tell you more on Monday. Please step into Gilbert's and buy a comfortable little cane-seated armchair, larger than these, and ask one of your good Samaritans to make a soft cushion for it. We'll give him the table that we had made for Johnny Cass. Poor Johnny! I am sorry he has a successor so soon.\"  In five minutes I was taking my homeward walk, mind and heart full of my elfish visitor, with his strange and ancient thoughts, his sharp speeches and queer fancies. Would he ever come back, or would one of those terrible spasms end his life before I was permitted to help and ease his crooked body, or pour a bit of mother-love into his starved little heart?  [Illustration: MISS HELEN.]     CHAPTER IV.  BEHIND THE SCENES.       Some children are like little human scrawl-books, blotted all over      with the sins and mistakes of their ancestors.   Monday morning came as mornings do come, bringing to the overworked body and mind a certain languor difficult to shake off. As I walked down the dirty little street, with its rows of old-clothes shops, saloons, and second-hand-furniture stores, I called several of my laggards, and gave them a friendly warning. \"Quarter of nine, Mrs. Finnigan!\" \"Bless me soul, darlin'! Well, I will hurry up my childern, that I will; but the baby was that bad with whoopin'-cough last night that I never got three winks meself, darlin'!\"  \"All right; never mind the apron; let Jimmy walk on with me, and I will give him one at school.\" Jimmy trots proudly at my side, munching a bit of baker's pie and carrying my basket. I drop into Mrs. Powers' suite of apartments in Rosalie Alley, and find Lafayette Powers still in bed. His twelve-year-old sister and guardian, Hildegarde, has over-slept, as usual, and breakfast is not in sight. Mrs. Powers goes to a dingy office up town at eight o'clock, her present mission in life being the healing of the nations by means of mental science. It is her fourth vocation in two years, the previous ones being tissue-paper flowers, lustre painting, and the agency for a high-class stocking supporter."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13506"],["title","The Story of Patsy (#3)"],["body"," I scold Hildegarde roundly, and she scrambles sleepily about the room to find a note that Mrs. Powers has left for me. I rejoin my court in the street, and open the letter with anticipation.  Miss Kate.  Dear Maddam.--You complane of Lafayette's never getting to school till eleven o'clock. It is not my affare as Hildegarde has _full charge_ of him and I _never_ intefear, but I would sujjest that if you _beleeve_ in him he will do better. Your unbeleef sapps his _will powers_. you have only reprooved him for being late. why not incurrage him say by _paying_ him 5 cents a morning for a wile to get amung his little maits on the stroak of nine? \"declare for good and good will work for you\" is one of our sayings. I have not time to treet Lafayette myself my busness being so engroassing but if you would take a few minites each night and _deny Fear along the 5 avanues_ you could heel him. Say _there is no Time in the infinnit_ over and over before you go to sleep. This will lift fear off of Lafayette, fear of being late and he will get there in time.       Yours for Good,      MRS. POWERS,      _Mental Heeler_.  Oh, what a naughty, ignorant, amusing, hypocritical, pathetic world it is! I tuck the note in my pocket to brighten the day for Helen, and we pass on.  As we progress we gather into our train Levi, Jacob, David, Moses, Elias, and the other prophets and patriarchs who belong to our band. We hasten the steps of the infant Garibaldi, who is devouring refuse fruit from his mother's store, and stop finally to pluck a small Dennis Kearney from the coal-hod, where he has been put for safe-keeping. The day has really begun, and with its first service the hands grow willing and the heart is filled with sunshine.  As the boys at my side prattle together of the \"percession\" and the \"sojers\" they saw yesterday, I wish longingly that I could be transported with my tiny hosts to the sunny, quiet country on this clear, lovely morning.  [Illustration: \"THE BOYS AT MY SIDE PRATTLE TOGETHER.\"]  I think of my own joyous childhood, spent in the sweet companionship of fishes, brooks, and butterflies, birds, crickets, grasshoppers, whispering trees and fragrant wild flowers, and the thousand and one playfellows of Nature which the good God has placed within reach of the happy country children. I think of the shining eyes of my little Lucys and Bridgets and Rachels could I turn them loose in a field of golden buttercups and daisies, with sweet wild strawberries hidden at their roots; of the merry glee of my dear boisterous little prophets and patriots, if I could set them catching tadpoles in a clear wayside pool, or hunting hens' nests in the alder bushes behind the barn, or pulling yellow cow lilies in the pond, or wading for cat-o'-nine-tails, with their ragged little trousers tucked above their knees. And oh! hardest of all to bear, I think of our poor little invalids, so young to struggle with languor and pain! Just to imagine the joy of my poor, lame boys and my weary, pale, and peevish children, so different from the bright-eyed, apple-cheeked darlings of well-to-do parents,--mere babies, who, from morning till night, seldom or never know what it is to cuddle down warmly into the natural rest of a mother's loving bosom!         *       *       *       *       *  Monday morning came and went,--Monday afternoon also; it was now two o'clock, and to my surprise and disappointment Patsy had not appeared. The new chair with its pretty red cushion stood expectant but empty. Helen had put a coat of shellac on poor Johnny Cass's table, freshened up its squared top with new lines of red paint, and placed a little silver vase of flowers on it. Our Lady Bountiful had come in to pay for the chair and see the boy, but alas! there was no boy to see. The children were all ready for him. They knew that he was a sick boy, like Johnny Cass, tired, and not able to run and jump, and that they must be good to him as they had been to Johnny. This was the idea of the majority; but I do not deny that there was a small minority which professed no interest and promised no virtue. Our four walls contained a miniature world,--a world with its best foot forward, too, but it was not heaven.  At quarter past two I went into Helen's little room, where she was drawing exquisite illustrations on a blackboard for next day's \"morning talk.\"  \"Helen, the children say that a family of Kennetts live at 32 Anna Street, and I am going to see why Patsy didn't come. Oh yes, I know that there are boys enough without running after them, but we must have this particular boy, whether he wants to come or not, for he is _sui generis_. He shall sit on that cushion         \"'And sew a fine seam,      And feast upon strawberries,        Sugar and cream!'\"  \"I think a taste for martyrdom is just as difficult to eradicate from the system as a taste for blood,\" Helen remarked whimsically. \"Very well, run on and I'll 'receive' in your absence. I could say with Antony, 'Lend me your ears,' for I shall need them. Have you any commands?\"  \"Just a few. Please tell Paulina Strozynski's big brother that he _must_ call for her earlier, and not leave her sitting on the steps so long. Tell Mrs. Hickok that if she sends us another child whom she knows to be down with the chicken-pox, we won't take in her two youngest when they're old enough. Don't give Mrs. Slamberg any aprons. She returned the little undershirts and drawers that I sent her by Julie, and said 'if it was all the same to me, she'd rather have something that would make a little more show!' And--oh yes, do see if you can find Jacob Shubener's hat; he is crying down in the yard, and doesn't dare go home without it.\"  \"Very well. Four cases. Strozynski--steps--cruelty. Hickok--chicken-pox--ingratitude. Slamberg--aprons--vanity. Shubener--hat--carelessness. Oh that I could fasten Jacob's hat to his ear by a steel chain! Has he looked in the sink?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Ash-barrel?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"Up in the pepper-tree?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"Then some one has 'chucked' it into the next yard, and the janitor will have to climb the fence,--at his age! Oh, if I could eliminate the irregular verb 'to chuck' from the vocabulary of this school, I could 'make out of the broken sounds of life a song, and out of life itself a melody,'\" and she flew down-stairs like a breeze, to find the patient Mr. Bowker. Mr. Bowker was a nice little man, who had not all his wits about him, but whose heart was quite intact, and who swept with energy and washed windows with assiduity. He belonged to the Salvation Army, and the most striking articles of his attire, when sweeping, were a flame-colored flannel shirt and a shiny black hat with \"Prepare to Meet Thy God\" on the front in large silver letters. The combination of color was indescribably pictorial, and as lurid and suggestive as an old-fashioned Orthodox sermon.  As I went through the lower hall, I found Mr. Bowker assisting Helen to search the coal-bin. \"Don't smile,\" she cried. \"Punch says, 'Sometimes the least likeliest place is more likelier than the most likeliest,'--and sure enough, here is the hat! I should have been named Deborah or Miriam,--not Helen!\" and she hurried to dry the tears of the weeping Jacob.  [Illustration: \"HERE IS THE HAT!\"]     CHAPTER V.  I SEEK PATSY, AND MEET THE DUCHESS OF ANNA STREET.       \"'Tis pride, rank pride and haughtiness of soul.\"   I make my way through the streets, drinking in the glorious air, breathing the perfume of the countless fruit stands and the fragrances that floated out from the open doors of the little flower stores in every block, till I left all that was pleasant behind me and turned into Anna Street.  I soon found Number 32, a dirty, tumble-down, one-story hovel, the blinds tied together with selvedges of red flannel, and a rickety bell that gave a certain style to the door, though it had long ceased to ring.  A knock brought a black-haired, beetle-browed person to the window.  \"Does Mrs. Kennett live here?\"  \"No, she don't. I live here.\"  \"Oh! then you are not Mrs. Kennett?\"  \"Wall, I ruther guess _not_!\" This in a tone of such royal superiority and disdain that I saw in an instant I had mistaken blue blood for red.  \"I must have been misinformed, then. This is Number 32?\"  \"Can't yer see it on the door?\"  \"Yes,\" meekly. \"I thought perhaps Anna Street had been numbered over.\"  \"What made yer think Mis' Kennett lived here?\"  \"A little girl brought me her name written on a card,--Mrs. Kennett, 32 Anna Street.\"  \"There!\" triumphantly, \"I might 'a knowed that woman 'd play some common trick like that! Now do you want ter know where Mis' Kennett re'ly doos live? Wall, _she lives in the rear_! Her number's 32-1/2, 'n I vow she gits more credit o' livin' in the front house 'n I do, 'n I pay four dollars more rent! Ever see her? I thought not! I guess 'f you hed you wouldn't think of her livin' in a house like this!\"  \"Excuse me. I didn't expect to make any trouble\"--  \"Oh, I've nothin' agin _you_, but just let me ketch her puttin' on airs 'n pertendin' to live like her betters, that's all! She's done it before, but I couldn't never ketch her at it. The idee of her keepin' up a house like this!\" and with a superb sniff like that of a battle-horse, she disappeared from the front window of her ancestral mansion and sought one at the back which might command a view of my meeting with her rival.  I slid meekly through a side gate, every picket of which was decorated with a small child, stumbled up a dark narrow passage, and found myself in a square sort of court out of which rose the rear houses so objectionable to my Duchess in the front row.  It was not plain sailing, by any means, owing to the collection of tin cans and bottles through which I had to pick my way, but I climbed some frail wooden steps, and stood at length on the landing of Number 32-1/2.  The door was open, and there sat Patsy, \"minding\" the Kennett baby, a dull little lump of humanity, whose brain "]]]
