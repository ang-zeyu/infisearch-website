PÉLLÉAS.  They have opened all the windows of the castle. It will be unusually hot this afternoon.... Look, there is mother with Mélisande at a window of the tower....  GOLAUD.  Yes; they have taken refuge on the shady side.--Speaking of Mélisande, I heard what passed and what was said last night. I am quite aware all that is but child's play; but it need not be repeated. Mélisande is very young and very impressionable; and she must be treated the more circumspectly that she is perhaps with child at this moment.... She is very delicate, hardly woman; and the least emotion might bring on a mishap. It is not the first time I have noticed there might be something between you.... You are older than she; it will suffice to have told you.... Avoid her as much as possible; without affectation moreover; without affectation....--What is it I see yonder on the highway toward the forest?...  PÉLLÉAS.  Some herds they are leading to the city....  GOLAUD.  They cry like lost children; you would say they smelt the butcher already.--It will be time for dinner.--What a fine day! What a capital day for the harvest!...                                                                  [_Exeunt._     SCENE V.--_Before the castle._   _Enter_ GOLAUD _and little_ YNIOLD.  GOLAUD.  Come, we are going to sit down here, Yniold; sit on my knee; we shall see from here what passes in the forest. I do not see you any more at all now. You abandon me too; you are always at little mother's.... Why, we are sitting just under little mother's windows.--Perhaps she is saying her evening prayer at this moment.... But tell me, Yniold, she is often with your uncle Pélléas, isn't she?  YNIOLD.  Yes, yes; always, little father; when you are not there, little father....  GOLAUD.  Ah!--look; some one is going by with a lantern in the garden.--But I have been told they did not like each other.... It seems they often quarrel;... no? Is it true?  YNIOLD.  Yes, yes; it is true.  GOLAUD.  Yes?--Ah! ah!--But what do they quarrel about?  YNIOLD.  About the door.  GOLAUD.  What? about the door?--What are you talking about?--No, come, explain yourself; why do they quarrel about the door?  YNIOLD.  Because it won't stay open.  GOLAUD.  Who wants it to stay open?--Come, why do they quarrel?  YNIOLD.  I don't know, little father; about the light.  GOLAUD.  I am not talking to you about the light; we will talk of that by and by. I am talking to you about the door. Answer what I ask you; you must learn to talk; it is time.... Do not put your hand in your mouth so;... come....  YNIOLD.  Little father! little father!... I won't do it any more.... [_He cries._]  GOLAUD.  Come; what are you crying for now? What has happened?  YNIOLD.  Oh! oh! little father, you hurt me....  GOLAUD.  I hurt you?--Where did I hurt you? I did not mean to....  YNIOLD.  Here, here; on my little arm....  GOLAUD.  I did not mean to; come, don't cry any more, and I will give you something to-morrow.  YNIOLD.  What, little father?  GOLAUD.  A quiver and some arrows; but tell me what you know about the door.  YNIOLD.  Big arrows?  GOLAUD.  Yes, yes; very big arrows.--But why don't they want the door to be open?--Come, answer me sometime!--no, no; do not open your mouth to cry. I am not angry. We are going to have a quiet talk, like Pélléas and little mother when they are together. What do they talk about when they are together?  YNIOLD.  Pélléas and little mother?  GOLAUD.  Yes; what do they talk about?  YNIOLD.  About me; always about me.  GOLAUD.  And what do they say about you?  YNIOLD.  They say I am going to be very big.  GOLAUD.  Oh, plague of my life!... I am here like a blind man searching for his treasure at the bottom of the ocean!... I am here like a new-born child lost in the forest, and you ... Come, come, Yniold, I was wandering; we are going to talk seriously. Do Pélléas and little mother never speak of me when I am not there?...  YNIOLD.  Yes, yes, little father; they are always speaking of you.  GOLAUD.  Ah!... And what do they say of me?  YNIOLD.  They say I shall grow as big as you are.  GOLAUD.  You are always by them?  YNIOLD.  Yes, yes, always, always, little father.  GOLAUD.  They never tell you to go play somewhere else?  YNIOLD.  No, little father; they are afraid when I am not there.  GOLAUD.  They are afraid?... What makes you think they are afraid?  YNIOLD.  Little mother always says, \"Don't go away; don't go away!\"... They are unhappy, but they laugh....  GOLAUD.  But that does not prove they are afraid.  YNIOLD.  Yes, yes, little father; she is afraid....  GOLAUD.  Why do you say she is afraid?  YNIOLD.  They always weep in the dark.  GOLAUD.  Ah! ah!...  YNIOLD.  That makes one weep too.  GOLAUD.  Yes, yes!...  YNIOLD.  She is pale, little father.  GOLAUD.  Ah! ah!... patience, my God, patience!...  YNIOLD.  What, little father?  GOLAUD.  Nothing, nothing, my child.--I saw a wolf go by in the forest.--Then they get on well together?--I am glad to learn they are on good terms.--They kiss each other sometimes--No?...  YNIOLD.  Kiss each other, little father?--No, no,--ah! yes, little father, yes; yes; once ... once when it rained....  GOLAUD.  They kissed?--But how, how did they kiss?  YNIOLD.  So, little father, so!... [_He gives him a kiss on the mouth, laughing._] Ah! ah! your beard, little father!... It pricks! it pricks! it pricks! It is getting all gray, little father, and your hair, too; all gray, all gray, all gray.... [_The window under which they are sitting is lighted up at this moment, and the light falls upon them._] Ah! ah! little mother has lit her lamp. It is light, little father; it is light....  GOLAUD.  Yes; it is beginning to be light....  YNIOLD.  Let us go there too, little father; let us go there too....  GOLAUD.  Where do you want to go?  YNIOLD.  Where it is light, little father.  GOLAUD.  No, no, my child; let us stay in the dark a little longer.... One cannot tell, one cannot tell yet.... Do you see those poor people down there trying to kindle a little fire in the forest?--It has rained. And over there, do you see the old gardener trying to lift that tree the wind has blown down across the road?--He cannot; the tree is too big; the tree is too heavy, and it will lie where it fell. All that cannot be helped.... I think Pélléas is mad....  YNIOLD.  No, little father, he is not mad; he is very good.  GOLAUD.  Do you want to see little mother?  YNIOLD.  Yes, yes; I want to see her!  GOLAUD.  Don't make any noise; I am going to hoist you up to the window. It is too high for me, for all I am so big.... [_He lifts the child._] Do not make the least noise; little mother would be terribly afraid.... Do you see her?--Is she in the room?  YNIOLD.  Yes.... Oh, how light it is!  GOLAUD.  She is alone?  YNIOLD.  Yes;... no, no; Uncle Pélléas Is there, too.  GOLAUD.  He--...!  YNIOLD.  Ah! ah! little father! you have hurt me!...  GOLAUD.  It is nothing; be still; I will not do it any more; look, look, Yniold!... I stumbled; speak lower. What are they doing?--  YNIOLD.  They are not doing anything, little father; they are waiting for something.  GOLAUD.  Are they near each other?  YNIOLD.  No, little father.  GOLAUD.  And ... and the bed? are they near the bed?  YNIOLD.  The bed, little father?--I can't see the bed.  GOLAUD.  Lower, lower; they will hear you. Are they speaking?  YNIOLD.  No, little father; they do not speak.  GOLAUD.  But what are they doing?--They must be doing something....  YNIOLD.  They are looking at the light.  GOLAUD.  Both?  YNIOLD.  Yes, little father.  GOLAUD.  They do not say anything?  YNIOLD.  No, little father; they do not close their eyes.  GOLAUD.  They do not come near each other?  YNIOLD.  No, little father; they do not stir.  GOLAUD.  They are sitting down?  YNIOLD.  No, little father; they are standing upright against the wall.  GOLAUD.  They make no gestures?--They do not look at each other?--They make no signs?...  YNIOLD.  No, little father.--Oh! oh! little father; they never close their eyes.... I am terribly afraid....  GOLAUD.  Be still. They do not stir yet?  YNIOLD.  No, little father.--I am afraid, little father; let me come down!...  GOLAUD.  Why, what are you afraid of?--Look! look!...  YNIOLD.  I dare not look any more, little father!... Let me come down!...  GOLAUD.  Look! look!...  YNIOLD.  Oh! oh! I am going to cry, little father!--Let me come down! let me come down!,..  GOLAUD.  Come; we will go see what has happened.                                                                  [_Exeunt._     ACT FOURTH     SCENE I.--_A corridor in the castle._   _Enter_ PÉLLÉAS _and_ MÉLISANDE, _meeting_.  PÉLLÉAS.  Where goest thou? I must speak to thee to-night. Shall I see thee?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes.  PÉLLÉAS.  I have just left my father's room. He is getting better. The physician has told us he is saved.... And yet this morning I had a presentiment this day would end ill. I have had a rumor of misfortune in my ears for some time.... Then, all at once there was a great change; to-day it is no longer anything but a question of time. All the windows in his room have been thrown open. He speaks; he seems happy. He does not speak yet like an ordinary man, but already his ideas no longer all come from the other world.... He recognized me. He took my hand and said with that strange air he has had since he fell sick: \"Is it thou, Pélléas? Why, why, I had not noticed it before, but thou hast the grave and friendly look of those who will not live long.... You must travel; you must travel....\" It is strange; I shall obey him.... My mother listened to him and wept for joy.--Hast thou not been aware of it?--The whole house seems already to revive, you hear breathing, you hear speaking, you hear walking.... Listen; I hear some one speaking behind that door. Quick, quick! answer quickly! where shall I see thee?  MÉLISANDE.  Where wouldst thou?  PÉLLÉAS.  In the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13329"],["title","Pélléas and Mélisande; Alladine and Palomides; Home (#6)"],["body","rk; near \"Blind Man's Spring.\"--Wilt thou?--Wilt thou come?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes.  PÉLLÉAS.  It will be the last night;--I am going to travel, as my father said. Thou wilt not see me more....  MÉLISANDE.  Do not say that, Pélléas.... I shall see thee always; I shall look upon thee always....  PÉLLÉAS.  Thou wilt look in vain.... I shall be so far away thou couldst no longer see me.... I shall try to go very far away.... I am full of joy, and you would say I had all the weight of heaven and earth on my body to-day....  MÉLISANDE.  What has happened, Pélléas?--I no longer understand what you say....  PÉLLÉAS.  Go, go; let us separate. I hear some one speaking behind that door.... It is the strangers who came to the castle this morning.... They are going out.... Let us go; it is the strangers....       [_Exeunt severally._     SCENE II.--_An apartment in the castle._ ARKËL _and_ MÉLISANDE _discovered._   ARKËL.  Now that Pélléas's father is saved, and sickness, the old handmaid of Death, has left the castle, a little joy and a little sunlight will at last come into the house again.... It was time!--For, since thy coming, we have only lived here whispering about a closed room.... And truly I have pitied thee, Mélisande.... Thou camest here all joyous, like a child seeking a gala-day, and at the moment thou enteredst in the vestibule I saw thy face change, and probably thy soul, as the face changes in spite of us when we enter at noon into a grotto too gloomy and too cold.... And since,--since, on account of all that, I have often no longer understood thee.... I observed thee, thou went there, listless perhaps, but with the strange, astray look of one awaiting ever a great trouble, in the sunlight, in a beautiful garden.... I cannot explain.... But I was sad to see thee so; for thou art too young and too beautiful to live already day and night under the breath of death.... But now all that will change. At my age,--and there perhaps is the surest fruit of my life,--at my age I have gained I know not what faith in the fidelity of events, and I have always seen that every young and beautiful being creates about itself young, beautiful, and happy events.... And it is thou who wilt now open the door for the new era I have glimpses of.... Come here; why dost thou stay there without answering and without lifting thine eyes?--I have kissed thee but once only hitherto,--the day of thy coming; and yet old men need sometimes to touch with their lips a woman's forehead or a child's cheek, to believe still in the freshness of life and avert awhile the menaces.... Art thou afraid of my old lips? How I have pitied thee these months!...  MÉLISANDE.  Grandfather, I have not been unhappy....  ARKËL.  Perhaps you were of those who are unhappy without knowing it,... and they are the most unhappy.... Let me look at thee, so, quite near, a moment;... we have such need of beauty beside Death....  _Enter_ GOLAUD.  GOLAUD.  Pélléas leaves to-night.  ARKËL.  Thou hast blood on thy forehead.--What hast thou done?  GOLAUD.  Nothing, nothing.... I have passed through a hedge of thorns.  MÉLISANDE.  Bend down your head a little, my lord.... I will wipe your forehead....  GOLAUD (_repulsing her_).  I will not that you touch me, do you understand? Go, go!--I am not speaking to you.--Where is my sword?--I came to seek my sword....  MÉLISANDE.  Here; on the praying-stool.  GOLAUD.  Bring it. [_To_ ARKËL.]--They have just found another peasant dead of hunger, along by the sea. You would say they all meant to die under our eyes.--[_To_ MÉLISANDE.] Well, my sword?--Why do you tremble so?--I am not going to kill you. I would simply examine the blade. I do not employ the sword for these uses. Why do you examine me like a beggar?--I do not come to ask alms of you. You hope to see something in my eyes without my seeing anything in yours?--Do you think I may know something?--[_To_ ARKËL.]--Do you see those great eyes?--It is as if they were proud of their richness....  ARKËL.  I see there only a great innocence....  GOLAUD.  A great innocence!... They are greater than innocence!... They are purer than the eyes of a lamb.... They would give God lessons in innocence! A great innocence! Listen: I am so near them I feel the freshness of their lashes when they wink; and yet I am less far away from the great secrets of the other world than from the smallest secret of those eyes!... A great innocence!... More than innocence! You would say the angels of heaven celebrated there an eternal baptism!... I know those eyes! I have seen them at their work! Close them! close them! or I shall close them for a long while!...--Do not put your right hand to your throat so; I am saying a very simple thing.... I have no under-thought.... If I had an under-thought, why should I not say it? Ah! ah!--do not attempt to flee!--Here!--Give me that hand!--Ah! your hands are too hot.... Go away! Your flesh disgusts me!... Here!--There is no more question of fleeing now!--[_He seizes her by the hair._]--You shall follow me on your knees!--On your knees!--On your knees before me!--Ah! ah! your long hair serves some purpose at last!... Right,... left!--Left,... right!--Absalom! Absalom.--Forward! back! To the ground! to the ground!... You see, you see; I laugh already like an old man....  ARKËL (_running up_).  Golaud!...  GOLAUD (_affecting a sudden calm_).  You will do as you may please, look you.--I attach no importance to that.--I am too old; and, besides, I am not a spy. I shall await chance; and then ... Oh! then!... simply because it is the custom; simply because it is the custom....                                [_Exit._  ARKËL.  What ails him?--He is drunk?  MÉLISANDE (_in tears_).  No, no; he does not love me any more.... I am not happy!... I am not happy!...  ARKËL.  If I were God, I would have pity on men's hearts....     SCENE III.--_A terrace of the castle. Little_ YNIOLD _discovered, trying to lift a bowlder._   LITTLE YNIOLD.  Oh, this stone is heavy!... It is heavier than I am.... It is heavier than everybody.... It is heavier than everything that ever happened.... I can see my golden ball between the rock and this naughty stone, and I cannot reach it.... My little arm is not long enough,... and this stone won't be lifted.... I can't lift it,... and nobody could lift it.... It is heavier than the whole house;... you would think it had roots in the earth.... [_The Bleatings of a flock heard far away._]--Oh! oh! I hear the sheep crying.... [_He goes to look, at the edge of the terrace._] Why! there is no more sun.... They are coming ... the little sheep ... they are coming.... There is a lot of them!... There is a lot of them!... They are afraid of the dark.... They crowd together! they crowd together!... They can hardly walk any more.... They are crying! they are crying! and they go quick!... They go quick!... They are already at the great crossroads. Ah! ah! They don't know where they ought to go any more.... They don't cry any more.... They wait.... Some of them want to go to the right.... They all want to go to the right.... They cannot!... The shepherd is throwing earth at them.... Ah! ah! They are going to pass by here.... They obey! They obey! They are going to pass under the terrace.... They are going to pass under the rocks.... I am going to see them near by.... Oh! oh! what a lot of them!... What a lot of them!... The whole road is full of them.... They all keep still now ... Shepherd! shepherd! why don't they speak any more?  THE SHEPHERD (_who is out of sight_).  Because it is no longer the road to the stable....  YNIOLD.  Where are they going?--Shepherd! shepherd!--where are they going?--He doesn't hear me any more. They are too far away already.... They go quick.... They are not making a noise any more.... It is no longer the road to the stable.... Where are they going to sleep to-night?--Oh! oh!--It is too dark.... I am going to tell something to somebody....                                                                    [_Exit._     SCENE IV.--_A fountain in the park._   _Enter_ PÉLLÉAS.  PÉLLÉAS.  It is the last evening ... the last evening. It must all end. I have played like a child about a thing I did not guess.... I have played a-dream about the snares of fate.... Who has awakened me all at once? I shall flee, crying out for joy and woe like a blind man fleeing from his burning house.... I am going to tell her I shall flee.... My father is out of danger; and I have no more reason to lie to myself.... It is late; she does not come.... I should do better to go away without seeing her again.... I must look well at her this time.... There are some things that I no longer recall.... It seems at times as if I had not seen her for a hundred years.... And I have not yet looked upon her look.... There remains nought to me if I go away thus. And all those memories ... it is as if I were to take away a little water in a muslin bag.... I must see her one last time, to the bottom of her heart.... I must tell her all that I have never told her.  _Enter_ MÉLISANDE.  MÉLISANDE.  Pélléas!  Mélisande!--Is it thou, Mélisande?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes.  PÉLLÉAS.  Come hither; do not stay at the edge of the moonlight.--Come hither. We have so many things to tell each other.... Come hither in the shadow of the linden.  MÉLISANDE.  Let me stay in the light....  PÉLLÉAS.  We might be seen from the windows of the tower. Come hither; here, we have nothing to fear.--Take care; we might be seen....  MÉLISANDE.  I wish to be seen....  PÉLLÉAS.  Why, what doth ail thee?--Thou wert able to come out without being seen?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes; your brother slept....  PÉLLÉAS.  It is late.--In an hour they will close the gates. We must be careful. Why art thou come so late?  MÉLISANDE.  Your brother had a bad dream. And then my gown was caught on the nails of the gate. See, it is torn. I lost all this time, and ran....  PÉLLÉAS.  My poor Mélisande!... I should almost be afraid to touch thee...."]]]
