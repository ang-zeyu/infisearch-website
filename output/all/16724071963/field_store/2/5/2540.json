ANOTHER MAIDSERVANT _(within)._  There are going to be great happenings!  THIRD MAIDSERVANT _(within)._  There are going to be great fêtes! Open quickly!...  THE MAIDSERVANTS.  Open! open!  PORTER.  Wait! wait! I do not know whether I shall be able to open it;... it is never opened.... Wait till it is light....  FIRST MAIDSERVANT.  It is light enough without; I see the sunlight through the chinks....  PORTER.  Here are the great keys.... Oh! oh! how the bolts and the locks grate!... Help me! help me!...  MAIDSERVANTS.  We are pulling; we are pulling....  SECOND MAIDSERVANT.  It will not open....  FIRST MAIDSERVANT.  Ah! ah! It is opening! it is opening slowly!  PORTER.  How it shrieks! how it shrieks! it will wake up everybody....  SECOND MAIDSERVANT.  _[Appearing on the threshold.]_ Oh, how light it is already out-of-doors!  FIRST MAIDSERVANT.  The sun is rising on the sea!  PORTER.  It is open.... It is wide open!... [_All the maidservants appear on the threshold and pass over it._]  FIRST MAIDSERVANT.  I am going to wash the sill first....  SECOND MAIDSERVANT.  We shall never be able to clean all this.  OTHER MAIDSERVANTS.  Fetch the water! fetch the water!  PORTER.  Yes, yes; pour on water; pour on water; pour on all the water of the Flood! You will never come to the end of it....     SCENE II.--_A forest._ MÉLISANDE _discovered at the brink of a spring._   _Enter_ GOLAUD.  GOLAUD.  I shall never be able to get out of this forest again.--God knows where that beast has led me. And yet I thought I had wounded him to death; and here are traces of blood. But now I have lost sight of him; I believe I am lost myself--my dogs can no longer find me--I shall retrace my steps....--I hear weeping.... Oh! oh! what is there yonder by the water's edge?... A little girl weeping by the water's edge? [_He coughs._]--She does not hear me. I cannot see her face. [_He approaches and touches_ MÉLISANDE _on the shoulder._] Why weepest thou? [MÉLISANDE _trembles, starts up, and would flee._]--Do not be afraid. You have nothing to fear. Why are you weeping here all alone?  MÉLISANDE.  Do not touch me! do not touch me!  GOLAUD.  Do not be afraid.... I will not do you any.... Oh, you are beautiful!  MÉLISANDE.  Do not touch me! do not touch me! or I throw myself in the water!...  GOLAUD.  I will not touch you.... See, I will stay here, against the tree. Do not be afraid. Has any one hurt you?  MÉLISANDE  Oh! yes! yes! yes!... [_She sobs profoundly._]  GOLAUD.  Who has hurt you?  MÉLISANDE.  Every one! every one!  GOLAUD. What hurt have they done you?  MÉLISANDE.  I will not tell! I cannot tell!...  GOLAUD.  Come; do not weep so. Whence come you?  MÉLISANDE.  I have fled!... fled ... fled....  GOLAUD.  Yes; but whence have you fled?  MÉLISANDE.  I am lost!... lost!... Oh! oh! lost here.... I am not of this place.... I was not born there....  GOLAUD.  Whence are you? Where were you born?  MÉLISANDE.  Oh! oh! far away from here!... far away ... far away....  GOLAUD.  What is it shining so at the bottom of the water?  MÉLISANDE.  Where?--Ah! it is the crown he gave me. It fell as I was weeping....  GOLAUD.  A crown?--Who was it gave you a crown?--I will try to get it....  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; I will have no more of it! I will have no more of it!... I had rather die ... die at once....  GOLAUD.  I could easily pull it out. The water is not very deep.  MÉLISANDE.  I will have no more of it! If you take it out, I throw myself in its place!...  GOLAUD.  No, no; I will leave it there. It could be reached without difficulty, nevertheless. It seems very beautiful.--Is it long since you fled?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, yes!... Who are you?  GOLAUD.  I am Prince Golaud,--grandson of Arkël, the old King of Allemonde....  MÉLISANDE.  Oh, you have gray hairs already....  GOLAUD.  Yes; some, here, by the temples....  MÉLISANDE  And in your beard, too.... Why do you look at me so?  GOLAUD.  I am looking at your eyes.--Do you never shut your eyes?  MÉLISANDE.  Oh, yes; I shut them at night....  GOLAUD.  Why do you look so astonished?  MÉLISANDE.  You are a giant?  GOLAUD.  I am a man like the rest....  MÉLISANDE.  Why have you come here?  GOLAUD.  I do not know, myself. I was hunting in the forest, I was chasing a wild boar. I mistook the road.--You look very young. How old are you?  MÉLISANDE.  I am beginning to be cold....  GOLAUD.  Will you come with me!  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; I will stay here....  GOLAUD.  You cannot stay here all alone. You cannot stay here all night long.... What is your name?  MÉLISANDE.  Mélisande.  GOLAUD.  You cannot stay here, Mélisande. Come with me....  MÉLISANDE.  I will stay here....  GOLAUD.  You will be afraid, all alone. We do not know what there may be here ... all night long ... all alone ... it is impossible. Mélisande, come, give me your hand....  MÉLISANDE.  Oh, do not touch me!...  GOLAUD.  Do not scream.... I will not touch you again. But come with me. The night will be very dark and very cold. Come with me....  MÉLISANDE.  Where are you going?...  GOLAUD.  I do not know.... I am lost too....                                                                  [_Exeunt._     SCENE III.--_A hall in the castle_. ARKËL _and_ GENEVIÈVE _discovered_.   GENEVIÈVE.  Here is what he writes to his brother Pélléas: \"I found her all in tears one evening, beside a spring in the forest where I had lost myself. I do not know her age, nor who she is, nor whence she comes, and I dare not question her, for she must have had a sore fright; and when you ask her what has happened to her, she falls at once a-weeping like a child, and sobs so heavily you are afraid. Just as I found her by the springs, a crown of gold had slipped from her hair and fallen to the bottom of the water. She was clad, besides, like a princess, though her garments had been torn by the briers. It is now six months since I married her and I know no more about it than on the day of our meeting. Meanwhile, dear Pélléas, thou whom I love more than a brother, although we were not born of the same father; meanwhile make ready for my return.... I know my mother will willingly forgive me. But I am afraid of the King, our venerable grandsire, I am afraid of Arkël, in spite of all his kindness, for I have undone by this strange marriage all his plans of state, and I fear the beauty of Mélisande will not excuse my folly to eyes so wise as his. If he consents nevertheless to receive her as he would receive his own daughter, the third night following this letter, light a lamp at the top of the tower that overlooks the sea. I shall perceive it from the bridge of our ship; otherwise I shall go far away again and come back no more....\" What say you of it?  ARKËL.  Nothing. He has done what he probably must have done. I am very old, and nevertheless I have not yet seen clearly for one moment into myself; how would you that I judge what others have done? I am not far from the tomb and do not succeed in judging myself.... One always mistakes when one does not close his eyes. That may seem strange to us; but that is all. He is past the age to marry and he weds like a child, a little girl he finds by a spring.... That may seem strange to us, because we never see but the reverse of destinies ... the reverse even of our own.... He has always followed my counsels hitherto; I had thought to make him happy in sending him to ask the hand of Princess Ursula.... He could not remain alone; since the death of his wife he has been sad to be alone; and that marriage would have put an end to long wars and old hatreds.... He would not have it so. Let it be as he would have it; I have never put myself athwart a destiny; and he knows better than I his future. There happen perhaps no useless events....  GENEVIÈVE.  He has always been so prudent, so grave and so firm.... If it were Pélléas, I should understand.... But he ... at his age.... Who is it he is going to introduce here?--An unknown found along the roads.... Since his wife's death, he has no longer lived for aught but his son, the little Yniold, and if he were about to marry again, it was because you had wished it.... And now ... a little girl in the forest.... He has forgotten everything....--What shall we do?...  _Enter_ PÉLLÉAS.  ARKËL.  Who is coming in there?  GENEVIÈVE.  It is Pélléas. He has been weeping.  ARKËL.  Is it thou, Pélléas?--Come a little nearer, that I may see thee in the light....  PÉLLÉAS.  Grandfather, I received another letter at the same time as my brother's; a letter from my friend Marcellus.... He is about to die and calls for me. He would see me before dying....  ARKËL.  Thou wouldst leave before thy brother's return?--Perhaps thy friend is less ill than he thinks....  PÉLLÉAS  His letter is so sad you can see death between the lines.... He says he knows the very day when death must come.... He tells me I can arrive before it if I will, but that there is no more time to lose. The journey is very long, and if I await Golaud's return, it will be perhaps too late....  ARKËL.  Thou must wait a little while, nevertheless.... We do not know what this return has in store for us. And besides, is not thy father here, above us, more sick perhaps than thy friend.... Couldst thou choose between the father and the friend?...                              [_Exit._  GENEVIÈVE.  Have a care to keep the lamp lit from this evening, Pélléas....  [_Exeunt severally._     SCENE IV.--_Before the castle. Enter_ GENEVIÈVE _and_ MÉLISANDE.   MÉLISANDE.  It is gloomy in the gardens. And what forests, what forests all about the palaces!...  GENEVIÈVE.  Yes; that astonished me too when I came hither; it astonishes everybody. There are places where you never see the sun. But one gets used to it so quickly.... It is long ago, it is long ago.... It is nearly forty years that I have lived here.... Look toward the other side, you will have the light of the sea....  MÉLISANDE.  I hear a noise below us....  GENEVIÈVE.

He seems still tired from having waited so long for you....  MÉLISANDE.  He has not seen us.  GENEVIÈVE.  I think he has seen us but does not know what he should do.... Pélléas, Pélléas, is it thou?...  _Enter_ PÉLLÉAS  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes!... I was coming toward the sea....  GENEVIÈVE.  So were we; we were seeking the light. It is a little lighter here than elsewhere; and yet the sea is gloomy.  PÉLLÉAS  We shall have a storm to-night. There has been one every night for some time, and yet it is so calm now.... One might embark unwittingly and come back no more.  MÉLISANDE.  Something is leaving the port....  PÉLLÉAS.  It must be a big ship.... The lights are very high, we shall see it in a moment, when it enters the band of light....  GENEVIÈVE.  I do not know whether we shall be able to see it ... there is still a fog on the sea....  PÉLLÉAS.  The fog seems to be rising slowly....  MÉLISANDE.  Yes; I see a little light down there, which I had not seen....  PÉLLÉAS.  It is a lighthouse; there are others we cannot see yet.  MÉLISANDE.  The ship is in the light.... It is already very far away....  PÉLLÉAS.  It is a foreign ship. It looks larger than ours....  MÉLISANDE.  It is the ship that brought me here!...  PÉLLÉAS.  It flies away under full sail....  MÉLISANDE.  It is the ship that brought me here. It has great sails.... I recognized it by its sails.  PÉLLÉAS.  There will be a rough sea to-night.  MÉLISANDE.  Why does it go away to-night?... You can hardly see it any longer.... Perhaps it will be wrecked....  PÉLLÉAS.  The sight falls very quickly....                              [_A silence._  GENEVIÈVE.  No one speaks any more?... You have nothing more to say to each other?... It is time to go in. Pélléas, show Mélisande the way. I mast go see little Yniold a moment.                                     [_Exit._  PÉLLÉAS.  Nothing can be seen any longer on the sea....  MÉLISANDE.  I see more lights.  PÉLLÉAS.  It is the other lighthouses.... Do you hear the sea?... It is the wind rising.... Let us go down this way. Will you give me your hand?  MÉLISANDE.  See, see, my hands are full....  PÉLLÉAS.  I will hold you by the arm, the road is steep and it is very gloomy there.... I am going away perhaps to-morrow....  MÉLISANDE.  Oh!... why do you go away?                                       [_Exeunt._     ACT SECOND.     SCENE I.--_A fountain in the park.   Enter_ PÉLLÉAS _and_ MÉLISANDE.  PÉLLÉAS.  You do not know where I have brought you?--I often come to sit here, toward noon, when it is too hot in the gardens. It is stifling to-day, even in the shade of the trees.  MÉLISANDE.  Oh, how clear the water is!...  PÉLLÉAS.  It is as cool as winter. It is an old abandoned spring. It seems to have been a miraculous spring,--it opened the eyes of the blind,--they still call it \"Blind Man's Spring.\"  MÉLISANDE.  It no longer opens the eyes of the blind?  PÉLLÉAS.  Since the King has been nearly blind himself, no one comes any more....  MÉLISANDE.  How alone one is here!... There is no sound.  PÉLLÉAS.  There is always a wonderful silence here.... One could hear the water sleep.... Will you sit down on the edge of the marble basin? There is one linden where the sun never comes....  MÉLISANDE.  I am going to lie down on the marble.--I should like to see the bottom of the water....  PÉLLÉAS.  No one has ever seen it.--It is as deep, perhaps, as the sea.--It is not known whence it comes.--Perhaps it comes from the bottom of the earth....  MÉLISANDE.  If there were anything shining at the bottom, perhaps one could see it....  PÉLLÉAS.  Do not lean over so....  MÉLISANDE.  I would like to touch the water....  PÉLLÉAS.  Have a care of slipping.... I will hold your hand....  MÉLISANDE.  No, no, I would plunge both hands in it.... You would say my hands were sick to-day....  PÉLLÉAS.  Oh! oh! take care! take care! Mélisande!... Mélisande!...--Oh! your hair!...  MÉLISANDE _(starting upright)._ I cannot,... I cannot reach it....  PÉLLÉAS.  Your hair dipped in the water....  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, it is longer than my arms.... It is longer than I....    [_A silence._  PÉLLÉAS.  It was at the brink of a spring, too, that he found you?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes....  PÉLLÉAS.  What did he say to you?  MÉLISANDE.  Nothing;--I no longer remember....  PÉLLÉAS.  Was he quite near you?  MÉLISANDE.  Yes; he would have kissed me.  PÉLLÉAS.  And you would not?  MÉLISANDE.  No.  PÉLLÉAS.  Why would you not?  MÉLISANDE.  Oh! oh! I saw something pass at the bottom of the water....  PÉLLÉAS.  Take care! take care!--You will fall! What are you playing with?  MÉLISANDE.  With the ring he gave me....  PÉLLÉAS.  Take care; you will lose it....  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; I am sure of my hands....  PÉLLÉAS.  Do not play so, over so deep a water....  MÉLISANDE.  My hands do not tremble.  PÉLLÉAS.  How it shines in the sunlight I--Do not throw it so high in the air....  MÉLISANDE.  Oh!...  PÉLLÉAS.  It has fallen?  MÉLISANDE.  It has fallen into the water!...  PÉLLÉAS.  Where is it? where is it?...  MÉLISANDE.  I do not see it sink?...  PÉLLÉAS.  I think I see it shine....  MÉLISANDE.  My ring?  PÉLLÉAS.  Yes, yes; down yonder....  MÉLISANDE.  Oh! oh! It is so far away from us!... no, no, that is not it ... that is not it.... It is lost ... lost.... There is nothing any more but a great circle on the water.... What shall we do? What shall we do now?...  PÉLLÉAS.  You need not be so troubled for a ring. It is nothing.... We shall find it again, perhaps. Or else we will find another....  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; we shall never find it again; we shall never find any others either.... And yet I thought I had it in my hands.... I had already shut my hands, and it is fallen in spite of all.... I threw it too high, toward the sun....  PÉLLÉAS.  Come, come, we will come back another day;... come, it is time. They will come to meet us. It was striking noon at the moment the ring fell.  MÉLISANDE.  What shall we say to Golaud if he ask where it is?  PÉLLÉAS.  The truth, the truth, the truth....                              [_Exeunt._     SCENE II.--_An apartment in the castle._ GOLAUD _discovered, stretched upon his bed;_ MÉLISANDE, _by his bedside_.   GOLAUD.  Ah! ah! all goes well; it will amount to nothing. But I cannot understand how it came to pass. I was hunting quietly in the forest. All at once my horse ran away, without cause. Did he see anything unusual?... I had just heard the twelve strokes of noon. At the twelfth stroke he suddenly took fright and ran like a blind madman against a tree. I heard no more. I do not yet know what happened. I fell, and he must have fallen on me. I thought I had the whole forest on my breast; I thought my heart was crushed. But my heart is sound. It is nothing, apparently....  MÉLISANDE.  Would you like a little water?  GOLAUD.  Thanks, thanks; I am not thirsty.  MÉLISANDE.  Would you like another pillow?... There is a little spot of blood on this.  GOLAUD.  No, no; it is not worth while. I bled at the mouth just now. I shall bleed again perhaps....  MÉLISANDE.  Are you quite sure?... You are not suffering too much?  GOLAUD.  No, no; I have seen a good many more like this. I was made of iron and blood.... These are not the little bones of a child; do not alarm yourself....  MÉLISANDE.  Close your eyes and try to sleep. I shall stay here all night....  GOLAUD.  No, no; I do not wish you to tire yourself so. I do not need anything; I shall sleep like a child.... What is the matter, Mélisande? Why do you weep all at once?...  MÉLISANDE _(bursting into tears)._  I am ... I am ill too....  GOLAUD.  Thou art ill?... What ails thee, then; what ails thee, Mélisande?...  MÉLISANDE.  I do not know.... I am ill here.... I had rather tell you to-day; my lord, my lord, I am not happy here....  GOLAUD.  Why, what has happened, Mélisande? What is it?... And I suspecting nothing.... What has happened?... Some one has done thee harm?... Some one has given thee offence?  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; no one has done me the least harm.... It is not that.... It is not that.... But I can live here no longer. I do not know why.... I would go away, go away!... I shall die if I am left here....  GOLAUD.  But something has happened? You must be hiding something from me?... Tell me the whole truth, Mélisande.... Is it the King?... Is it my mother?... Is it Pélléas?...  MÉLISANDE.  No, no; it is not Pélléas. It is not anybody.... You could not understand me....  GOLAUD.  Why should I not understand?... If you tell me nothing, what will you have me do?... Tell me everything and I shall understand everything.  MÉLISANDE.  I do not know myself what it is.... I do not know just what it is.... If I could tell you, I would tell you.... It is something stronger than I....  GOLAUD.  Come; be reasonable, Mélisande.--What would you have me do?--You are no longer a child.--Is it I whom you would leave?  MÉLISANDE.  Oh! no, no; it is not that.... I would go away with you.... It is here that I can live no longer.... I feel that I shall not live a long while....  GOLAUD.  But there must be a reason nevertheless. You will be thought mad. It will be thought child's dreams.--Come, is it Pélléas, perhaps?--I think he does not often speak to you.  MÉLISANDE.  Yes, yes; he speaks to me sometimes. I think he does not like me; I have seen it in his eyes.... But he speaks to me when he meets me....  GOLAUD.  You must not take it ill of him. He has always been so. He is a little strange. And just now he is sad; he thinks of his friend Marcellus, who is at the point of death, and whom he cannot go to see.... He will change, he will change, you will see; he is young....  MÉLISANDE.  But it is not that ... it is not that....  GOLAUD.  What is it, then?--Can you not get used to the life one leads here? Is it too gloomy here?--It is true the castle is very old and very sombre.... It is very cold, and very deep. And all those who dwell in it, are"]]]
