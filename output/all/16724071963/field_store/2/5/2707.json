His face assumed a look of extreme surprise. Then he glanced up the staircase after Wogan and laughed as though the conjunction of the lady and Mr. Wogan was a rare piece of amusement. Mr. Wogan did not hear the laugh, but the lady did. She raised her head, and at the same moment the courtier came across the hall to meet her. As soon as he had come close, \"Harry,\" said she, and gave him her hand.  He bent over it and kissed it, and there was more than courtesy in the warmth of the kiss.  \"But I'm glad you've come. I did not look for you for another week,\" he said in a low voice. He did not, however, offer to help her to alight.  \"This is your lodging?\" she asked.  \"No,\" said he, \"the King's;\" and the woman shrank suddenly back amongst her cushions. In a moment, however, her face was again at the door.  \"Then who was he,--my postillion?\"  \"Your postillion?\" asked Whittington, glancing at the servant who held the horses.  \"Yes, the tall man who looked as if he should have been a scholar and had twisted himself all awry into a soldier. You must have passed him in the hall.\"  Whittington stared at her. Then he burst again into a laugh.  \"Your postillion, was he? That's the oddest thing,\" and he lowered his voice. \"Your postillion was Mr. Charles Wogan, who comes from Rome post-haste with the Pope's procuration for the marriage. You have helped him on his way, it seems. Here's a good beginning, to be sure.\"  The lady uttered a little cry of anger, and her face hardened out of all its softness. She clenched her fists viciously, and her blue eyes grew cold and dangerous as steel. At this moment she hardly looked the delicate flower she had appeared to Wogan's fancy.  \"But you need not blame yourself,\" said Whittington, and he lowered his head to a level with hers. \"All the procurations in Christendom will not marry James Stuart to Clementina Sobieski.\"  \"She has not come, then?\"  \"No, nor will she come. There is news to-day. Lean back from the window, and I will tell you. She has been arrested at Innspruck.\"  The lady could not repress a crow of delight.  \"Hush,\" said Whittington. Then he withdrew his head and resumed in his ordinary voice, \"I have hired a house for your Ladyship, which I trust will be found convenient. My servant will drive you thither.\"  He summoned his servant from the group of footmen about the entrance, gave him his orders, bowed to the ground, and twisting his cane sauntered idly down the street.     CHAPTER II   Wogan mounted the stairs, not daring to speculate upon the nature of the bad news. But his face was pale beneath its sunburn, and his hand trembled on the balustrade; for he knew--in his heart he knew. There could be only one piece of news which would make his haste or tardiness matters of no account.  Both branches of the stairs ran up to a common landing, and in the wall facing him, midway between the two stairheads, was a great door of tulip wood. An usher stood by the door, and at Wogan's approach opened it. Wogan, however, signed to him to be silent. He wished to hear, not to speak, and so he slipped into the room unannounced. The door was closed silently behind him, and at once he was surprised by the remarkable silence, almost a cessation of life it seemed, in a room which was quite full. Wherever the broad bars of sunshine fell, as they slanted dusty with motes through the open lattices of the shutters, they striped a woman's dress or a man's velvet coat. Yet if anyone shuffled a foot or allowed a petticoat to rustle, that person glanced on each side guiltily. A group of people were gathered in front of the doorway. Their backs were towards Wogan, and they were looking towards the centre of the room. Wogan raised himself on his toes and looked that way too. Having looked he sank down again, aware at once that he had travelled of late a long way in a little time, and that he was intolerably tired. For that one glance was enough to deprive him of his last possibility of doubt. He had seen the Chevalier de St. George, his King, sitting apart in a little open space, and over against him a short squarish man, dusty as Wogan himself, who stood and sullenly waited. It was Sir John Hay, the man who had been sent to fetch the Princess Clementina privately to Bologna, and here he now was back at Bologna and alone.  Wogan had counted much upon this marriage, more indeed than any of his comrades. It was to be the first step of the pedestal in the building up of a throne. It was to establish in Europe a party for James Stuart as strong as the party of Hanover. But so much was known to everyone in that room; to Wogan the marriage meant more. For even while he found himself muttering over and over with dry lips, as white and exhausted he leaned against the door, Clementina's qualifications,--\"Daughter of the King of Poland, cousin to the Emperor and to the King of Portugal, niece to the Electors of Treves, Bavaria, and Palatine,\"--the image of the girl herself rose up before his eyes and struck her titles from his thoughts. She was the chosen woman, chosen by him out of all Europe--and lost by John Hay!  He remembered very clearly at that moment his first meeting with her. He had travelled from court to court in search of the fitting wife, and had come at last to the palace at Ohlau in Silesia. It was in the dusk of the evening, and as he was ushered into the great stone hall, hung about and carpeted with barbaric skins, he had seen standing by the blazing wood fire in the huge chimney a girl in a riding dress. She raised her head, and the firelight struck upwards on her face, adding a warmth to its bright colours and a dancing light to the depths of her dark eyes. Her hair was drawn backwards from her forehead, and the frank, sweet face revealed to him from the broad forehead to the rounded chin told him that here was one who joined to a royal dignity the simple nature of a peasant girl who works in the fields and knows more of animals than of mankind. Wogan was back again in that stone hall when the voice of the Chevalier with its strong French accent broke in upon his vision.  \"Well, we will hear the story. Well, you left Ohlau with the Princess and her mother and a mile-long train of servants in spite of my commands of secrecy.\"  There was more anger and less despondency than was often heard in his voice. Wogan raised himself again on tiptoes and noticed that the Chevalier's face was flushed and his eyes bright with wrath.  \"Sir,\" pleaded Hay, \"the Princess's mother would not abate a man.\"  \"Well, you reached Ratisbon. And there?\"  \"There the English minister came forward from the town to flout us with an address of welcome in which he used not our incognitos but our true names.\"  \"From Ratisbon then no doubt you hurried? Since you were discovered, you shed your retinue and hurried?\"  \"Sir, we hurried--to Augsburg,\" faltered Hay. He stopped, and then in a burst of desperation he said, \"At Augsburg we stayed eight days.\"  \"Eight days?\"  There was a stir throughout the room; a murmur began and ceased. Wogan wiped his forehead and crushed his handkerchief into a hard ball in his palm. It seemed to him that here in this room he could see the Princess Clementina's face flushed with the humiliation of that loitering.  \"And why eight days in Augsburg?\"  \"The Princess's mother would have her jewels reset. Augsburg is famous for its jewellers,\" stammered Hay.  The murmur rose again; it became almost a cry of stupefaction. The Chevalier sprang from his chair. \"Her jewels reset!\" he said. He repeated the words in bewilderment. \"Her jewels reset!\" Then he dropped again into his seat.  \"I lose a wife, gentlemen, and very likely a kingdom too, so that a lady may have her jewels reset at Augsburg, where, to be sure, there are famous jewellers.\"  His glance, wandering in a dazed way about the room, settled again on Hay. He stamped his foot on the ground in a feverish irritation.  \"And those eight days gave just the time for a courier from the Emperor at Vienna to pass you on the road and not press his horse. One should be glad of that. It would have been a pity had the courier killed his horse. Oh, I can fashion the rest of the story for myself. You trailed on to Innspruck, where the Governor marched out with a troop and herded you in. They let _you_ go, however. No doubt they bade you hurry back to me.\"  \"Sir, I did hurry,\" said Hay, who was now in a pitiable confusion. \"I travelled hither without rest.\"  The anger waned in the Chevalier's eyes as he heard the plea, and a great dejection crept over his face.  \"Yes, you would do that,\" said he. \"That would be the time for you to hurry with a pigeon's swiftness so that your King might taste his bitter news not a minute later than need be. And what said she upon her arrest?\"  \"The Princess's mother?\" asked Hay, barely aware of what he said.  \"No. Her Highness, the Princess Clementina. What said she?\"  \"Sir, she covered her face with her hands for perhaps the space of a minute. Then she leaned forward to the Governor, who stood by her carriage, and cried, 'Shut four walls about me quick! I could sink into the earth for shame.'\"  Wogan in those words heard her voice as clearly as he saw her face and the dry lips between which the voice passed. He had it in his heart to cry aloud, to send the words ringing through that hushed room, \"She would have tramped here barefoot had she had one guide with a spirit to match hers.\" For a moment he almost fancied that he had spoken them, and that he heard the echo of his voice vibrating down to silence. But he had not, and as he realised that he had not, a new thought occurred to him. No one had remarked his entrance into the room. The group in front still stood with their backs towards him. Since his entrance no one had remarked his presence. At once he turned and opened the door so gently that there was not so much as a click of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13567"],["title","Clementina (#2)"],["body","latch. He opened it just wide enough for himself to slip through, and he closed it behind him with the same caution. On the landing there was only the usher. Wogan looked over the balustrade; there was no one in the hall below.  \"You can keep a silent tongue,\" he said to the usher. \"There's profit in it;\" and Wogan put his hand into his pocket. \"You have not seen me if any ask.\"  \"Sir,\" said the man, \"any bright object disturbs my vision.\"  \"You can see a crown, though,\" said Wogan.  \"Through a breeches pocket. But if I held it in my hand--\"  \"It would dazzle you.\"  \"So much that I should be blind to the giver.\"  The crown was offered and taken.  Wogan went quietly down the stairs into the hall. There were a few lackeys at the door, but they would not concern themselves at all because Mr. Wogan had returned to Bologna. He looked carefully out into the street, chose a moment when it was empty, and hurried across it. He dived into the first dark alley that he came to, and following the wynds and byways of the town made his way quickly to his lodging. He had the key to his door in his pocket, and he now kept it ready in his hand. From the shelter of a corner he watched again till the road was clear; he even examined the windows of the neighbouring houses lest somewhere a pair of eyes might happen to be alert. Then he made a run for his door, opened it without noise, and crept secretly as a thief up the stairs to his rooms, where he had the good fortune to find his servant. Wogan had no need to sign to him to be silent. The man was a veteran corporal of French Guards who after many seasons of campaigning in Spain and the Low Countries had now for five years served Mr. Wogan. He looked at his master and without a word went off to make his bed.  Wogan sat down and went carefully over in his mind every minute of the time since he had entered Bologna. No one had noticed him when he rode in as the lady's postillion,--no one. He was sure of that. The lady herself did not know him from Adam, and fancied him an Italian into the bargain--of that, too, he had no doubt. The handful of lackeys at the door of the King's house need not be taken into account. They might gossip among themselves, but Wogan's appearances and disappearances were so ordinary a matter, even that was unlikely. The usher's silence he had already secured. There was only one acquaintance who had met and spoken with him, and that by the best of good fortune was Harry Whittington,--the idler who took his banishment and his King's misfortunes with an equally light heart, and gave never a thought at all to anything weightier than a gamecock.  Wogan's spirits revived. He had not yet come to the end of his luck. He sat down and wrote a short letter and sealed it up.  \"Marnier,\" he called out in a low voice, and his servant came from the adjoining room, \"take this to Mr. Edgar, the King's secretary, as soon as it grows dusk. Have a care that no one sees you deliver it. Lock the parlour door when you go, and take the key. I am not yet back from Rome.\" With that Wogan remembered that he had not slept for forty-eight hours. Within two minutes he was between the sheets; within five he was asleep.     CHAPTER III   Wogan waked up in the dark and was seized with a fear that he had slept too long. He jumped out of bed and pushed open the door of his parlour. There was a lighted lamp in the room, and Marnier was quietly laying his master's supper.  \"At what hour?\" asked Wogan.  \"Ten o'clock, monsieur, at the little postern in the garden wall.\"  \"And the time now?\"  \"Nine.\"  Wogan dressed with some ceremony, supped, and at eight minutes to ten slipped down the stairs and out of doors. He had crushed his hat down upon his forehead and he carried his handkerchief at his face. But the streets were dark and few people were abroad. At a little distance to his left he saw above the housetops a glow of light in the air which marked the Opera-House. Wogan avoided it; he kept again to the alleys and emerged before the Chevalier's lodging. This he passed, but a hundred yards farther on he turned down a side street and doubled back upon his steps along a little byway between small houses. The line of houses, however, at one point was broken by a garden wall. Under this wall Wogan waited until a clock struck ten, and while the clock was still striking he heard on the other side of the wall the brushing of footsteps amongst leaves and grass. Wogan tapped gently on a little door in the wall. It was opened no less gently, and Edgar the secretary admitted him, led him across the garden and up a narrow flight of stairs into a small lighted cabinet. Two men were waiting in that room. One of them wore the scarlet robe, an old man with white hair and a broad bucolic face, whom Wogan knew for the Pope's Legate, Cardinal Origo. The slender figure of the other, clad all in black but for the blue ribbon of the Garter across his breast, brought Wogan to his knee.  Wogan held out the Pope's procuration to the Chevalier, who took it and devoutly kissed the signature. Then he gave his hand to Wogan with a smile of friendliness.  \"You have outsped your time by two days, Mr. Wogan. That is unwise, since it may lead us to expect again the impossible of you. But here, alas, your speed for once brings us no profit. You have heard, no doubt. Her Highness the Princess Clementina is held at Innspruck in prison.\"  Wogan rose to his feet.  \"Prisons, sir,\" he said quietly, \"have been broken before to-day. I myself was once put to that necessity.\" The words took the Chevalier completely by surprise. He leaned back in his chair and stared at Wogan.  \"An army could not rescue her,\" he said.  \"No, but one man might.\"  \"You?\" he exclaimed. He pressed down the shade of the lamp to throw the light fully upon Wogan's face. \"It is impossible!\"  \"Then I beg your Majesty to expect the impossible again.\"  The Chevalier drew his hand across his eyes and stared afresh at Wogan. The audacity of the exploit and the imperturbable manner of its proposal caught his breath away. He rose from his chair and took a turn or two across the room.  Wogan watched his every gesture. It would be difficult he knew to wring the permission he needed from his dejected master, and his unruffled demeanour was a calculated means of persuasion. An air of confidence was the first requisite. In reality, however, Wogan was not troubled at this moment by any thought of failure. It was not that he had any plan in his head; but he was fired with a conviction that somehow this chosen woman was not to be wasted, that some day, released by some means in spite of all the pressure English Ministers could bring upon the Emperor, she would come riding into Bologna.  The Chevalier paused in his walk and looked towards the Cardinal.  \"What does your Eminence say?\"  \"That to the old the impulsiveness of youth is eternally charming,\" said the Cardinal, with a foppish delicacy of speaking in an odd contrast to his person.  Mr. Wogan understood that he had a second antagonist.  \"I am not a youth, your Eminence,\" he exclaimed with all the indignation of twenty-seven years. \"I am a man.\"  \"But an Irishman, and that spells youth. You write poetry too, I believe, Mr. Wogan. It is a heady practice.\"  Wogan made no answer, though the words stung. An argument with the Cardinal would be sure to ruin his chance of obtaining the Chevalier's consent. He merely bowed to the Cardinal and waited for the Chevalier to speak.  \"Look you, Mr. Wogan; while the Emperor's at war with Spain, while England's fleet could strip him of Sicily, he's England's henchman. He dare not let the Princess go. We know it. General Heister, the Governor of Innspruck, is under pain of death to hold her safe.\"  \"But, sir, would the world stop if General Heister died?\"  \"A German scaffold if you fail.\"  \"In the matter of scaffolds I have no leaning towards any one nationality.\"  The Cardinal smiled. He liked a man of spirit, though he might think him absurd. The Chevalier resumed his restless pacing to and fro.  \"It is impossible.\"  But he seemed to utter the phrase with less decision this second time. Wogan pressed his advantage at the expense of his modesty.  \"Sir, will you allow me to tell you a story,--a story of an impossible escape from Newgate in the heart of London by a man in fetters? There were nine grenadiers with loaded muskets standing over him. There were two courtyards to cross, two walls to climb, and beyond the walls the unfriendly streets. The man hoodwinked his sentries, climbed his two walls, crossed the unfriendly streets, and took refuge in a cellar, where he was discovered. From the cellar in broad daylight he fought his way to the roofs, and on the roofs he played such a game of hide-and-seek among the chimney-tops--\" Wogan broke off from his story with a clear thrill of laughter; it was a laugh of enjoyment at a pleasing recollection. Then he suddenly flung himself down on his knee at the feet of his sovereign. \"Give me leave, your Majesty,\" he cried passionately. \"Let me go upon this errand. If I fail, if the scaffold's dressed for me, why where's the harm? Your Majesty loses one servant out of his many. Whereas, if I win--\" and he drew a long breath. \"Aye, and I shall win! There's the Princess, too, a prisoner. Sir, she has ventured much. I beg you give me leave.\"  The Chevalier laid his hand gently upon Wogan's shoulder, but he did not assent. He looked again doubtfully to the Cardinal, who said with his pleasant smile, \"I will wager Mr. Wogan a box at the Opera on the first night that he returns, that he will return empty-handed.\"  Wogan rose to his feet and replied good-humouredly, \"It's a wager I take the more readily in that your Eminence cannot win, though you may lose. For if I return empty-handed, upon my honour I'll not return at all.\"  The Cardinal condescended to laugh. Mr. Wogan laughed too. He had good reason, for here was his Eminence in a kindly temper and the "]]]
