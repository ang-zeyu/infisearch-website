For your      Lordship, I do think myself more beholding to you than to any man.      And I say, I reckon myself as a _common_ (not popular but      _common_); and as much as is lawful to be enclosed of a common, so      much your Lordship shall be sure to have.--Your Lordship's to obey      your honourable commands, more settled than ever.\"  It may be that, as Bacon afterwards maintained, the closing sentences of this letter implied a significant reserve of his devotion. But during the brilliant and stormy years of Essex's career which followed, Bacon's relations to him continued unaltered. Essex pressed Bacon's claims whenever a chance offered. He did his best to get Bacon a rich wife--the young widow of Sir Christopher Hatton--but in vain. Instead of Bacon she accepted Coke, and became famous afterwards in the great family quarrel, in which Coke and Bacon again found themselves face to face, and which nearly ruined Bacon before the time. Bacon worked for Essex when he was wanted, and gave the advice which a shrewd and cautious friend would give to a man who, by his success and increasing pride and self-confidence, was running into serious dangers, arming against himself deadly foes, and exposing himself to the chances of fortune. Bacon was nervous about Essex's capacity for war, a capacity which perhaps was not proved, even by the most brilliant exploit of the time, the capture of Cadiz, in which Essex foreshadowed the heroic but well-calculated audacities of Nelson and Cochrane, and showed himself as little able as they to bear the intoxication of success, and to work in concert with envious and unfriendly associates. At the end of the year 1596, the year in which Essex had won such reputation at Cadiz, Bacon wrote him a letter of advice and remonstrance. It is a lively picture of the defects and dangers of Essex's behaviour as the Queen's favourite; and it is a most characteristic and worldly-wise summary of the ways which Bacon would have him take, to cure the one and escape the other. Bacon had, as he says, \"good reason to think that the Earl's fortune comprehended his own.\" And the letter may perhaps be taken as an indirect warning to Essex that Bacon must, at any rate, take care of his own fortune, if the Earl persisted in dangerous courses. Bacon shows how he is to remove the impressions, strong in the Queen's mind, of Essex's defects; how he is, by due submissions and stratagems, to catch her humour--       \"But whether I counsel you the best, or for the best, duty bindeth      me to offer to you my wishes. I said to your Lordship last time,      _Martha, Martha, attendis ad plurima, unum sufficit_; win the      Queen: if this be not the beginning, of any other course I see no      end.\"  Bacon gives a series of minute directions how Essex is to disarm the Queen's suspicions, and to neutralize the advantage which his rivals take of them; how he is to remove \"the opinion of his nature being _opiniastre_ and not rulable;\" how, avoiding the faults of Leicester and Hatton, he is, as far as he can, to \"allege them for authors and patterns.\" Especially, he must give up that show of soldier-like distinction, which the Queen so disliked, and take some quiet post at Court. He must not alarm the Queen by seeking popularity; he must take care of his estate; he must get rid of some of his officers; and he must not be disquieted by other favourites.  Bacon wished, as he said afterwards, to see him \"with a white staff in his hand, as my Lord of Leicester had,\" an honour and ornament to the Court in the eyes of the people and foreign ambassadors. But Essex was not fit for the part which Bacon urged upon him, that of an obsequious and vigilant observer of the Queen's moods and humours. As time went on, things became more and more difficult between him and his strange mistress; and there were never wanting men who, like Cecil and Raleigh, for good and bad reasons, feared and hated Essex, and who had the craft and the skill to make the most of his inexcusable errors. At last he allowed himself, from ambition, from the spirit of contradiction, from the blind passion for doing what he thought would show defiance to his enemies, to be tempted into the Irish campaign of 1599. Bacon at a later time claimed credit for having foreseen and foretold its issue. \"I did as plainly see his overthrow, chained as it were by destiny to that journey, as it is possible for any man to ground a judgment on future contingents.\" He warned Essex, so he thought in after years, of the difficulty of the work; he warned him that he would leave the Queen in the hands of his enemies: \"It would be ill for her, ill for him, ill for the State.\" \"I am sure,\" he adds, \"I never in anything in my life dealt with him in like earnestness by speech, by writing, and by all the means I could devise.\" But Bacon's memory was mistaken. We have his letters. When Essex went to Ireland, Bacon wrote only in the language of sanguine hope--so little did he see \"overthrow chained by destiny to that journey,\" that \"some good spirit led his pen to presage to his Lordship success;\" he saw in the enterprise a great occasion of honour to his friend; he gave prudent counsels, but he looked forward confidently to Essex being as \"fatal a captain to that war, as Africanus was to the war of Carthage.\" Indeed, however anxious he may have been, he could not have foreseen Essex's unaccountable and to this day unintelligible failure. But failure was the end, from whatever cause; failure, disgraceful and complete. Then followed wild and guilty but abortive projects for retrieving his failure, by using his power in Ireland to make himself formidable to his enemies at Court, and even to the Queen herself. He intrigued with Tyrone; he intrigued with James of Scotland; he plunged into a whirl of angry and baseless projects, which came to nothing the moment they were discussed. How empty and idle they were was shown by his return against orders to tell his own story at Nonsuch, and by thus placing himself alone and undeniably in the wrong, in the power of the hostile Council. Of course it was not to be thought of that Cecil should not use his advantage in the game. It was too early, irritated though the Queen was, to strike the final blow. But it is impossible not to see, looking back over the miserable history, that Essex was treated in a way which was certain, sooner or later, to make him, being what he was, plunge into a fatal and irretrievable mistake. He was treated as a cat treats a mouse; he was worried, confined, disgraced, publicly reprimanded, brought just within verge of the charge of treason, but not quite, just enough to discredit and alarm him, but to leave him still a certain amount of play. He was made to see that the Queen's favour was not quite hopeless; but that nothing but the most absolute and unreserved humiliation could recover it. It was plain to any one who knew Essex that this treatment would drive Essex to madness. \"These same gradations of yours\"--so Bacon represents himself expostulating with the Queen on her caprices--\"are fitter to corrupt than to correct any mind of greatness.\" They made Essex desperate; he became frightened for his life, and he had reason to be so, though not in the way which he feared. At length came the stupid and ridiculous outbreak of the 8th of February, 1600/1601, a plot to seize the palace and raise the city against the ministers, by the help of a few gentlemen armed only with their rapiers. As Bacon himself told the Queen, \"if some base and cruel-minded persons had entered into such an action, it might have caused much blow and combustion; but it appeared well that they were such as knew not how to play the malefactors!\" But it was sufficient to bring Essex within the doom of treason.  Essex knew well what the stake was. He lost it, and deserved to lose it, little as his enemies deserved to win it; for they, too, were doing what would have cost them their heads if Elizabeth had known it--corresponding, as Essex was accused of doing, with Scotland about the succession, and possibly with Spain. But they were playing cautiously and craftily; he with bungling passion. He had been so long accustomed to power and place, that he could not endure that rivals should keep him out of it. They were content to have their own way, while affecting to be the humblest of servants; he would be nothing less than a Mayor of the Palace. He was guilty of a great public crime, as every man is who appeals to arms for anything short of the most sacred cause. He was bringing into England, which had settled down into peaceable ways, an imitation of the violent methods of France and the Guises. But the crime as well as the penalty belonged to the age, and crimes legally said to be against the State mean morally very different things, according to the state of society and opinion. It is an unfairness verging on the ridiculous, when the ground is elaborately laid for keeping up the impression that Essex was preparing a real treason against the Queen like that of Norfolk. It was a treason of the same sort and order as that for which Northumberland sent Somerset to the block: the treason of being an unsuccessful rival.  Meanwhile Bacon had been getting gradually into the unofficial employ of the Government. He had become one of the \"Learned Counsel\"--lawyers with subordinate and intermittent work, used when wanted, but without patent or salary, and not ranking with the regular law officers. The Government had found him useful in affairs of the revenue, in framing interrogatories for prisoners in the Tower, in drawing up reports of plots against the Queen. He did not in this way earn enough to support himself; but he had thus come to have some degree of access to the Queen, which he represents as being familiar and confidential, though he still perceived, as he says himself, that she did not like"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],["title","Bacon (#8)"],["body","im. At the first news of Essex's return to England, Bacon greeted him--       \"MY LORD,--Conceiving that your Lordship came now up in the person      of a good servant to see your sovereign mistress, which kind of      compliments are many times _instar magnorum meritorum_, and      therefore it would be hard for me to find you, I have committed to      this poor paper the humble salutations of him _that is more yours      than any man's, and more yours than any man_. To these salutations      I add a due and joyful gratulation, confessing that your Lordship,      in your last conference with me before your journey, spake not in      vain, God making it good, That you trusted we should say _Quis      putasset_! Which as it is found true in a happy sense, so I wish      you do not find another _Quis putasset_ in the manner of taking      this so great a service. But I hope it is, as he said, _Nubecula      est, cito transibit_, and that your Lordship's wisdom and      obsequious circumspection and patience will turn all to the best.      So referring all to some time that I may attend you, I commit you      to God's best preservation.\"  But when Essex's conduct in Ireland had to be dealt with, Bacon's services were called for; and from this time his relations towards Essex were altered. Every one, no one better than the Queen herself, knew all that he owed to Essex. It is strangely illustrative of the time, that especially as Bacon held so subordinate a position, he should have been required, and should have been trusted, to act against his only and most generous benefactor. It is strange, too, that however great his loyalty to the Queen, however much and sincerely he might condemn his friend's conduct, he should think it possible to accept the task. He says that he made some remonstrance; and he says, no doubt truly, that during the first stage of the business he used the ambiguous position in which he was placed to soften Essex's inevitable punishment, and to bring about a reconciliation between him and the Queen. But he was required, as the Queen's lawyer, to set forth in public Essex's offences; and he admits that he did so \"not over tenderly.\" Yet all this, even if we have misgivings about it, is intelligible. If he had declined, he could not, perhaps, have done the service which he assures us that he tried to do for Essex; and it is certain that he would have had to reckon with the terrible lady who in her old age still ruled England from the throne of Henry VIII., and who had certainly no great love for Bacon himself. She had already shown him in a much smaller matter what was the forfeit to be paid for any resistance to her will. All the hopes of his life must perish; all the grudging and suspicious favours which he had won with such unremitting toil and patient waiting would be sacrificed, and he would henceforth live under the wrath of those who never forgave. And whatever he did for himself, he believed that he was serving Essex. His scheming imagination and his indefatigable pen were at work. He tried strange indirect methods; he invented a correspondence between his brother and Essex, which was to fall into the Queen's hands in order to soften her wrath and show her Essex's most secret feelings. When the Queen proposed to dine with him at his lodge in Twickenham Park, \"though I profess not to be a poet,\" he \"prepared a sonnet tending and alluding to draw on her Majesty's reconcilement to my Lord.\" It was an awkward thing for one who had been so intimate with Essex to be so deep in the counsels of those who hated him. He complains that many people thought him ungrateful and disloyal to his friend, and that stories circulated to his disadvantage, as if he were poisoning the Queen's ear against Essex. But he might argue fairly enough that, wilful and wrong-headed as Essex had been, it was the best that he could now do for him; and as long as it was only a question of Essex's disgrace and enforced absence from Court, Bacon could not be bound to give up the prospects of his life--indeed, his public duty as a subordinate servant of government--on account of his friend's inexcusable and dangerous follies. Essex did not see it so, and in the subjoined correspondence had the advantage; but Bacon's position, though a higher one might be imagined, where men had been such friends as these two men had been, is quite a defensible one:       \"MY LORD,--No man can better expound my doings than your Lordship,      which maketh me need to say the less. Only I humbly pray you to      believe that I aspire to the conscience and commendation first of      _bonus civis_, which with us is a good and true servant to the      Queen, and next of _bonus vir_, that is an honest man. I desire      your Lordship also to think that though I confess I love some      things much better than I love your Lordship--as the Queen's      service, her quiet and contentment, her honour, her favour, the      good of my country, and the like--yet I love few persons better      than yourself, both for gratitude's sake and for your own virtues,      which cannot hurt but by accident or abuse. Of which my good      affection I was ever ready and am ready to yield testimony by any      good offices, but with such reservations as yourself cannot but      allow; for as I was ever sorry that your Lordship should fly with      waxen wings, doubting Icarus's fortune, so for the growing up of      your own feathers, specially ostrich's, or any other save of a bird      of prey, no man shall be more glad. And this is the axletree      whereupon I have turned and shall turn, which to signify to you,      though I think you are of yourself persuaded as much, is the cause      of my writing; and so I commend your Lordship to God's goodness.      From Gray's Inn, this 20th day of July, 1600.       \"Your Lordship's most humbly,      \"FR. BACON.\"  To this letter Essex returned an answer of dignified reserve, such as Bacon might himself have dictated--       \"MR. BACON,--I can neither expound nor censure your late actions,      being ignorant of all of them, save one, and having directed my      sight inward only, to examine myself. You do pray me to believe      that you only aspire to the conscience and commendation of _bonus      civis_ and _bonus vir_; and I do faithfully assure you, that while      that is your ambition (though your course be active and mine      contemplative), yet we shall both _convenire in codem tertio_ and      _convenire inter nosipsos_. Your profession of affection and offer      of good offices are welcome to me. For answer to them I will say      but this, that you have believed I have been kind to you, and you      may believe that I cannot be other, either upon humour or my own      election. I am a stranger to all poetical conceits, or else I      should say somewhat of your poetical example. But this I must say,      that I never flew with other wings than desire to merit and      confidence in my Sovereign's favour; and when one of these wings      failed me I would light nowhere but at my Sovereign's feet, though      she suffered me to be bruised with my fall. And till her Majesty,      that knows I was never bird of prey, finds it to agree with her      will and her service that my wings should be imped again, I have      committed myself to the mire. No power but my God's and my      Sovereign's can alter this resolution of       \"Your retired friend,      \"ESSEX.\"  But after Essex's mad attempt in the city a new state of things arose. The inevitable result was a trial for high treason, a trial of which no one could doubt the purpose and end. The examination of accomplices revealed speeches, proposals, projects, not very intelligible to us in the still imperfectly understood game of intrigue that was going on among all parties at the end of Elizabeth's reign, but quite enough to place Essex at the mercy of the Government and the offended Queen. \"The new information,\" says Mr. Spedding, \"had been immediately communicated to Coke and Bacon.\" Coke, as Attorney-General, of course conducted the prosecution; and the next prominent person on the side of the Crown was not the Solicitor, or any other regular law officer, but Bacon, though holding the very subordinate place of one of the \"Learned Counsel.\"  It does not appear that he thought it strange, that he showed any pain or reluctance, that he sought to be excused. He took it as a matter of course. The part assigned to Bacon in the prosecution was as important as that of Coke; and he played it more skilfully and effectively. Trials in those days were confused affairs, often passing into a mere wrangle between the judges, lawyers, and lookers-on, and the prisoner at the bar. It was so in this case. Coke is said to have blundered in his way of presenting the evidence, and to have been led away from the point into an altercation with Essex. Probably it really did not much matter; but the trial was getting out of its course and inclining in favour of the prisoner, till Bacon--Mr. Spedding thinks, out of his regular turn--stepped forward and retrieved matters. This is Mr. Spedding's account of what Bacon said and did:       \"By this time the argument had drifted so far away from the point      that it must have been difficult for a listener to remember what it      was that the prisoners were charged with, or how much of the charge      had been proved. And Coke, who was all this time the sole speaker      on behalf of the Crown, was still following each fresh topic that      rose before him, without the sign of an intention or the intimation      of a wish to return to the main question and reform the broken      ranks of his evidence. Luckily he seems to have been now at a loss      what point to take next, and the pause gave Bacon an opportunity of      rising. It can hardly have been in pursuance of previous      arrangements; for though it was customary in those days to  "]]]
