She eventually powdered it, he     adds, and found it an efficacious medicine for herself and     others. An earlier example, of a lady at the French court who     embalmed and perfumed the genital organs of her dead husband,     always preserving them in a gold casket, is mentioned by     Brantôme. Mantegazza knew a man who kept for many years on his     desk the skull of his dead mistress, making it his dearest     companion. \"Some,\" he remarks, \"have slept for months and years     with a book, a garment, a trifle. I once had a friend who would     spend long hours of joy and emotion kissing a thread of silk     which _she_ had held between her fingers, now the only relic of     love.\" (Mantegazza, _Fisiologia dell' Amore_, cap. X.) In the     same way I knew a lady who in old age still treasured in her     desk, as the one relic of the only man she had ever been     attracted to, a fragment of paper he had casually twisted up in a     conversation with her half a century before.  The tendency to treasure the relics of a beloved person, more especially the garments, is the simplest and commonest foundation of erotic symbolism. It is without doubt absolutely normal. It is inevitable that those objects which have been in close contact with the beloved person's body, and are intimately associated with that person in the lover's mind, should possess a little of the same virtue, the same emotional potency. It is a phenomenon closely analogous to that by which the relics of saints are held to possess a singular virtue. But it becomes somewhat less normal when the garment is regarded as essential even in the presence of the beloved person.[10]  While an extremely large number of objects and acts may be found to possess occasionally the value of erotic symbols, such symbols most frequently fall into certain well-defined groups. A vast number of isolated objects or acts may be exceptionally the focus of erotic contemplation, but the objects and acts which frequently become thus symbolic are comparatively few.  It seems to me that the phenomena of erotic symbolism may be most conveniently grouped in three great classes, on the basis of the objects or acts which arouse them.  I. PARTS OF THE BODY.--_A. Normal:_ Hand, foot, breasts, nates, hair, secretions and excretions, etc.  _B. Abnormal:_ Lameness, squinting, pitting of smallpox, etc. Paidophilia or the love of children, presbyophilia or the love of the aged, and necrophilia or the attraction for corpses, may be included under this head, as well as the excitement caused by various animals.   II. INANIMATE OBJECTS.[11]--_A. Garments:_ Gloves, shoes and stockings and garters, caps, aprons, handkerchiefs, underlinen.  _B. Impersonal Objects:_ Here may be included all the various objects that may accidentally acquire the power of exciting sexual feeling in auto-erotism. Pygmalionism may also be included.   III. ACTS AND ATTITUDES.--_A. Active:_ Whipping, cruelty, exhibitionism. _B. Passive:_ Being whipped, experiencing cruelty. Personal odors and the sound of the voice may be included under this head. _C. Mixoscopic:_ The vision of climbing, swinging, etc. The acts of urination and defecation. The coitus of animals.  Although the three main groups into which the phenomena of erotic symbolism are here divided may seem fairly distinct, they are yet very closely allied, and indeed overlap, so that it is possible, as we shall see, for a single complex symbol to fall into all three groups.  A very complete kind of erotic symbolism is furnished by Pygmalionism or the love of statues.[12] It is exactly analogous to the child's love of a doll, which is also a form of sexual (though not erotic) symbolism. In a somewhat less abnormal form, erotic symbolism probably shows itself in its simplest shape in the tendency to idealize unbeautiful peculiarities in a beloved person, so that such peculiarities are ever afterward almost or quite essential in order to arouse sexual attraction. In this way men have become attracted to limping women. Even the most normal man may idealize a trifling defect in a beloved woman. The attention is inevitably concentrated on any such slight deviation from regular beauty, and the natural result of such concentration is that a complexus of associated thoughts and emotions becomes attached to something that in itself is unbeautiful. A defect becomes an admired focus of attention, the embodied symbol of the lover's emotion.      Thus a mole is not in itself beautiful, but by the tendency to     erotic symbolism it becomes so. Persian poets especially have     lavished the richest imagery on moles (_Anis El-Ochchâq_ in     _Bibliothèque des Hautes Etudes_, fasc, 25, 1875); the Arabs, as     Lane remarks (_Arabian Society in the Middle Ages_, p. 214), are     equally extravagant in their admiration of a mole.      Stendhal long since well described the process by which a defect     becomes a sexual symbol. \"Even little defects in a woman's face,\"     he remarked, \"such as a smallpox pit, may arouse the tenderness     of a man who loves her, and throw him into deep reverie when he     sees them in another woman. It is because he has experienced a     thousand feelings in the presence of that smallpox mark, that     these feelings have been for the most part delicious, all of the     highest interest, and that, whatever they may have been, they are     renewed with incredible vivacity on the sight of this sign, even     when perceived on the face of another woman. If in such a case we     come to prefer and love _ugliness_, it is only because in such a     case ugliness is beauty. A man loved a woman who was very thin     and marked by smallpox; he lost her by death. Three years later,     in Rome, he became acquainted with two women, one very beautiful,     the other thin and marked by smallpox, on that account, if you     will, rather ugly. I saw him in love with this plain one at the     end of a week, which he had employed in effacing her plainness by     his memories.\" (_De l'Amour_, Chapter XVII.)  In the tendency to idealize the unbeautiful features of a beloved person erotic symbolism shows itself in a simple and normal form. In a less simple and more morbid form it appears in persons in whom the normal paths of sexual gratification are for some reasons inhibited, and who are thus led to find the symbols of natural love in unnatural perversions. It is for this reason that so many erotic symbolisms take root in childhood and puberty, before the sexual instincts have reached full development. It is for the same reason also, that, at the other end of life, when the sexual energies are failing, erotic symbols sometimes tend to be substituted for the normal pleasures of sex. It is for this reason, again, that both men and women whose normal energies are inhibited sometimes find the symbols of sexual gratification in the caresses of children.      The case of a schoolmistress recorded by Penta instructively     shows how an erotic symbolism of this last kind may develop by no     means as a refinement of vice, but as the one form in which     sexual gratification becomes possible when normal gratification     has been pathologically inhibited. F.R., aged 48, schoolmistress;     she was some years ago in an asylum with religious mania, but     came out well in a few months. At the age of 12 she had first     experienced sexual excitement in a railway train from the jolting     of the carriage. Soon after she fell in love with a youth who     represented her ideal and who returned her affection. When,     however, she gave herself to him, great was her disillusion and     surprise to find that the sexual act which she had looked forward     to could not be accomplished, for at the first contact there was     great pain and spasmodic resistance of the vagina. There was a     condition of vaginismus. After repeated attempts on subsequent     occasions her lover desisted. Her desire for intercourse     increased, however, rather than diminished, and at last she was     able to tolerate coitus, but the pain was so great that she     acquired a horror of the sexual embrace and no longer sought it.     Having much will power, she restrained all erotic impulses during     many years. It was not until the period of the menopause that the     long repressed desires broke out, and at last found a symbolical     outlet that was no longer normal, but was felt to supply a     complete gratification. She sought the close physical contact of     the young children in her care. She would lie on her bed naked,     with two or three naked children, make them suck her breasts and     press them to every part of her body. Her conduct was discovered     by means of other children who peeped through the keyhole, and     she was placed under Penta for treatment. In this case the loss     of moral and mental inhibition, due probably to troubles of the     climacteric, led to indulgence, under abnormal conditions, in     those primitive contacts which are normally the beginning of     love, and these, supported by the ideal image of the early lover,     constituted a complete and adequate symbol of natural love in a     morbidly perverted individual.

FOOTNOTES:  [1] The term \"erotic symbolism\" has already been employed by Eulenburg (_Sexuale Neuropathie_, 1895, p. 101). It must be borne in mind that this term, implying the specific emotion, is much narrower than the term \"sexual symbolism,\" which may be used to designate a great variety of ritual and social practices which have played a part in the evolution of civilization.

The psychology of the associations of contiguity and resemblance through which erotic symbolism operates its transference is briefly discussed by Ribot in the _Psychology of the Emotions_, Part 1, Chapter XII; the early chapters of the same author's _Logique des Sentiments_ may also be said to deal with the emotional basis on which erotic symbolism arises.  [4] A number of synonyms for the female pudenda are brought together by Schurig--cunnus, hortus, concha, navis, fovea, larva, canis, annulus, focus, cymba, antrum, delta, myrtus, etc.--and he discusses many of them.

[11] Chevalier (_De l'Inversion_, 1885; id., _L'Inversion Sexuelle_, 1892, p. 52), followed by E. Laurent (_L'Amour Morbide_, 1891, Chapter X), separates this group from other fetichistic perversions, under the head of \"azoöphilie.\" I see no adequate ground for this step. The various forms of fetichism are too intimately associated to permit of any group of them being violently separated from the others.  [12] This has already been considered as a perversion founded on vision, in discussing _Sexual Selection in Man_. IV.     II.

Of all forms of erotic symbolism the most frequent is that which idealizes the foot and the shoe. The phenomena we here encounter are sometimes so complex and raise so many interesting questions that it is necessary to discuss them somewhat fully.  It would seem that even for the normal lover the foot is one of the most attractive parts of the body. Stanley Hall found that among the parts specified as most admired in the other sex by young men and women who answered a _questionnaire_ the feet came fourth (after the eyes, hair, stature and size).[13] Casanova, an acute student and lover of women who was in no degree a foot fetichist, remarks that all men who share his interest in women are attracted by their feet; they offer the same interest, he considers, as the question of the particular edition offers to the book-lover.[14]      In a report of the results of a _questionnaire_ concerning     children's sense of self, to which over 500 replies were     received, Stanley Hall thus summarizes the main facts ascertained     with reference to the feet: \"A special period of noticing the     feet comes somewhat later than that in which the hands are     discovered to consciousness. Our records afford nearly twice as     many cases for feet as for hands. The former are more remote from     the primary psychic focus or position, and are also more often     covered, so that the sight of them is a more marked and     exceptional event. Some children become greatly excited whenever     their feet are exposed. Some infants show signs of fear at the     movement of their own knees and feet covered, and still more     often fright is the first sensation which signalizes the child's     discovery of its feet.... Many are described as playing with them     as if fascinated by strange, newly-discovered toys. They pick     them up and try to throw them away, or out of the cradle, or     bring them to the mouth, where all things tend to go.... Children     often handle their feet, pat and stroke them, offer them toys and     the bottle, as if they, too, had an independent hunger to     gratify, an _ego_ of their own.... Children often develop [later]     a special interest in the feet of others, and examine, feel them,     etc., sometimes expressing surprise that the pinch of the     mother's toe hurts her and not the child, or comparing their own     and the feet of others point by point. Curious, too, are the     intensifications of foot-consciousness throughout the early years     of childhood, whenever children have the exceptional privilege of     going barefoot, or have new shoes. The feet are often     apostrophized, punished, beaten sometimes to the point of pain     for breaking things, throwing the child down, etc. Several     children have habits, which reach great intensity, and then     vanish, of touching or tickling the feet, with gales of laughter,     and a few are described as showing an almost morbid reluctance to     wear anything upon the feet, or even to having them touched by     others.... Several almost fall in love with the great toe or the     little one, especially admiring some crease or dimple in it,     dressing it in some rag of silk or bit of ribbon, or cut-off     glove fingers, winding it with string, prolonging it by tying on     bits of wood. Stroking the feet of others, especially if they are     shapely, often becomes almost a passion with young children, and     several adults confess a survival of the same impulse which it is     an exquisite pleasure to gratify. The interest of some mothers in     babies' toes, the expressions of which are ecstatic and almost     incredible, is a factor of great importance.\" (G. Stanley Hall,     \"Some Aspects of the Early Sense of Self,\" _American Journal of     Psychology_, April, 1898.) In childhood, Stanley Hall remarks     elsewhere (_Adolescence_, vol. ii, p. 104), \"a form of courtship     may consist solely in touching feet under the desk.\" It would     seem that even animals have a certain amount of sexual     consciousness in the feet; I have noticed a male donkey, just     before coitus, bite the feet of his partner.  At the same time it is scarcely usual for the normal lover, in most civilized countries to-day, to attach primary importance to the foot, such as he very frequently attaches to the eyes, though the feet play a very conspicuous part in the work of certain novelists.[15]  In a small but not inconsiderable minority of persons, however, the foot or the boot becomes the most attractive part of a woman, and in some morbid cases the woman herself is regarded as a comparatively unimportant appendage to her feet or her boots. The boots under civilized conditions much more frequently constitute the sexual symbol than do the feet themselves; this is not surprising since in ordinary life the feet are not often seen.      It is usually only under exceptionally favoring conditions that     foot-fetichism occurs, as in the case recorded by Marandon de     Montyel of a doctor who had been brought up in the West Indies.     His mother had been insane and he himself was subject to     obsessions, especially of being incapable of urinating; he had     had nocturnal incontinence of urine in childhood. All the women     of the people in the West Indies go about with naked feet, which     are often beautiful. His puberty evolved under this influence,     and foot-fetichism developed. He especially admired large, fat,     arched feet, with delicate skin and large, regular toes. He     masturbated with images of feet. At 15 he had relations with a     colored chambermaid, but feared to mention his fetichism, though     it was the touch of her feet that chiefly excited him. He now     gave up masturbation, and had a succession of mistresses, but was     always ashamed to confess his fancies until, at the age of 33, in     Paris, a very intelligent woman who had become his mistress     discovered his mania and skillfully enabled him to yield to it     without shock to his modesty. He was devoted to this mistress,     who had very beautiful feet (he had been horrified by the feet of     Europeans generally), until she finally left him. (_Archives de     Neurologie_, October, 1904.)      Probably the first case of shoe-fetichism ever recorded in any     detail is that of Restif de la Bretonne (1734-1806), publicist     and novelist, one of the most remarkable literary figures of the     later eighteenth century in France. Restif was a neurotic     subject, though not to an extreme degree, and his shoe-fetichism,     though distinctly pronounced, was not pathological; that is to     say, that the shoe was not itself an adequate gratification of     the sexual impulse, but simply a highly important aid to     tumescence, a prelude to the natural climax of detumescence; only     occasionally, and _faute de mieux_, in the absence of the beloved     person, was the shoe used as an adjunct to masturbation. In     Restif's stories and elsewhere the"]]]
