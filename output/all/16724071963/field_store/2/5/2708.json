And, indeed, while he was still laughing the Chevalier caught him by the arm as a friend might do, and in an outburst of confidence, very rare with him, he said, \"I would that I could laugh so. You and Whittington, I do envy you. An honest laugh, there's the purge for melancholy. But I cannot compass it,\" and he turned away.  \"Sure, sir, you'll put us all to shame when I bring her Royal Highness out of Innspruck.\"  \"Oh, that!\" said the Chevalier, as though for the moment he had forgotten. \"It is impossible,\" and the phrase was spoken now in an accent of hesitation. Moreover, he sat down at a table, and drawing a sheet of paper written over with memoranda, he began to read aloud with a glance towards Wogan at the end of each sentence.  \"The house stands in the _faubourgs_ of Innspruck. There is an avenue of trees in front of the house; on the opposite side of the avenue there is a tavern with the sign of 'The White Chamois.'\"  Wogan committed the words to memory.  \"The Princess and her mother,\" continued the Chevalier, \"are imprisoned in the east side of the house.\"  \"And how guarded, sir?\" asked Wogan.  The Chevalier read again from his paper.  \"A sentry at each door, a third beneath the prisoners' windows. They keep watch night and day. Besides, twice a day the magistrate visits the house.\"  \"At what hours?\"  \"At ten in the morning. The same hour at night.\"  \"And on each visit the magistrate sees the Princess?\"  \"Yes, though she lies abed.\"  Wogan stroked his chin. The Cardinal regarded him quizzically.  \"I trust, Mr. Wogan, that we shall hear Farini. There is talk of his coming to Bologna.\"  Wogan did not answer. He was silent; he saw the three sentinels standing watchfully about the house; he heard them calling \"All's well\" each to the other. Then he asked, \"Has the Princess her own servants to attend her?\"  \"Only M. Chateaudoux, her chamberlain.\"  \"Ah!\"  Wogan leaned forward with a question on his tongue he hardly dared to ask. So much hung upon the answer.  \"And M. Chateaudoux is allowed to come and go?\"  \"In the daylight.\"  Wogan turned to the Cardinal. \"The box will be the best box in the house,\" Wogan suggested.  \"Oh, sir,\" replied the Cardinal, \"on the first tier, to be sure.\"  Wogan turned back to the Chevalier.  \"All that I need now is a letter from your Majesty to the King of Poland and a few rascally guineas. I can leave Bologna before a soul's astir in the morning. No one but Whittington saw me to-day, and a word will keep him silent. There will be secrecy--\" but the Chevalier suddenly cut him short.  \"No,\" said he, bringing the palm of his hand down upon the table. \"Here's a blow that we must bend to! It's a dream, this plan of yours.\"  \"But a dream I'll dream so hard, sir, that I'll dream it true,\" cried Wogan, in despair.  \"No, no,\" said the Chevalier. \"We'll talk no more of it. There's God's will evident in this arrest, and we must bend to it;\" and at once Wogan remembered his one crowning argument. It was so familiar to his thoughts, it had lain so close at his heart, that he had left it unspoken, taking it as it were for granted that others were as familiar with it as he.  \"Sir,\" said he, eagerly, \"I have never told you, but the Princess Clementina when a child amongst her playmates had a favourite game. They called it kings and queens. And in that game the Princess was always chosen Queen of England.\"  The Chevalier started.  \"Is that so?\" and he gazed into Wogan's eyes, making sure that he spoke the truth.  \"In very truth it is,\" and the two men stood looking each at the other and quite silent.  It was the truth, a mere coincidence if you will, but to both these men omens and auguries were the gravest matters.  \"There indeed is God's finger pointing,\" cried Wogan. \"Sir, give me leave to follow it.\"  The Chevalier still stood looking at him in silence. Then he said suddenly, \"Go, then, and God speed you! You are a gallant gentleman.\"  He sat down thereupon and wrote a letter to the King of Poland, asking him to entrust the rescue of his daughter into Wogan's hands. This letter Wogan took and money for his journey.  \"You will have preparations to make,\" said the Chevalier. \"I will not keep you. You have horses?\"  Mr. Wogan had two in a stable at Bologna. \"But,\" he added, \"there is a horse I left this morning six miles this side of Fiesole, a black horse, and I would not lose it.\"  \"Nor shall you,\" said the Chevalier.  Wogan crept back to his lodging as cautiously as he had left it. There was no light in any window but in his own, where his servant, Marnier, awaited him. Wogan opened the door softly and found the porter asleep in his chair. He stole upstairs and made his preparations. These, however, were of the simplest kind, and consisted of half-a-dozen orders to Marnier and the getting into bed. In the morning he woke before daybreak and found Marnier already up. They went silently out of the house as the dawn was breaking. Marnier had the key to the stables, and they saddled the two horses and rode through the blind and silent streets with their faces muffled in their cloaks.  They met no one, however, until they were come to the outskirts of the town. But then as they passed the mouth of an alley a man came suddenly out and as suddenly drew back. The morning was chill, and the man was closely wrapped.  Wogan could not distinguish his face or person, and looking down the alley he saw at the end of it only a garden wall, and over the top of the wall a thicket of trees and the chimney-tops of a low house embosomed amongst them. He rode on, secure in the secrecy of his desperate adventure. But that same morning Mr. Whittington paid a visit to Wogan's lodging and asked to be admitted. He was told that Mr. Wogan had not yet returned to Bologna.  \"So, indeed, I thought,\" said he; and he sauntered carelessly along, not to his own house, but to one smaller, situated at the bottom of a _cul-de-sac_ and secluded amongst trees. At the door he asked whether her Ladyship was yet visible, and was at once shown into a room with long windows which stood open to the garden. Her Ladyship lay upon a sofa sipping her coffee and teasing a spaniel with the toe of her slipper.  \"You are early,\" she said with some surprise.  \"And yet no earlier than your Ladyship,\" said Whittington.  \"I have to make my obeisance to my King,\" said she, stifling a yawn. \"Could one, I ask you, sleep on so important a day?\"  Mr. Whittington laughed genially. Then he opened the door and glanced along the passage. When he turned back into the room her Ladyship had kicked the spaniel from the sofa and was sitting bolt upright with all her languor gone.  \"Well?\" she asked quickly.  Whittington took a seat on the sofa by her side.  \"Charles Wogan left Bologna at daybreak. Moreover, I have had a message from the Chevalier bidding me not to mention that I saw him in Bologna yesterday. One could hazard a guess at the goal of so secret a journey.\"  \"Ohlau!\" exclaimed the lady, in a whisper. Then she nestled back upon the sofa and bit the fragment of lace she called her handkerchief.  \"So there's an end of Mr. Wogan,\" she said pleasantly.  Whittington made no answer.  \"For there's no chance that he'll succeed,\" she continued with a touch of anxiety in her voice.  Whittington neither agreed nor contradicted. He asked a question instead.  \"What is the sharpest spur a man can know? What is it that gives a man audacity to attempt and wit to accomplish the impossible?\"  The lady smiled.  \"The poets tell us love,\" said she, demurely.  Whittington nodded his head.  \"Wogan speaks very warmly of the Princess Clementina.\"  Her Ladyship's red lips lost their curve. Her eyes became thoughtful, apprehensive.  \"I wonder,\" she said slowly.  \"Yes, I too wonder,\" said Whittington.  Outside the branches of the trees rustled in the wind and flung shadows, swift as ripples, across the sunlit grass. But within the little room there was a long silence.     CHAPTER IV   M. Chateaudoux, the chamberlain, was a little portly person with a round, red face like a cherub's. He was a creature of the house, one that walked with delicate steps, a conductor of ceremonies, an expert in the subtleties of etiquette; and once he held his wand of office in his hand, there was nowhere to be found a being so precise and consequential. But out of doors he had the timidity of a cat. He lived, however, by rule and rote, and since it had always been his habit to take the air between three and four of the afternoon, he was to be seen between those hours at Innspruck on any fine day mincing along the avenue of trees before the villa in which his mistress was held prisoner.  On one afternoon during the month of October he passed a hawker, who, tired with his day's tramp, was resting on a bench in the avenue, and who carried upon his arm a half-empty basket of cheap wares. The man was ragged; his toes were thrusting through his shoes; it was evident that he wore no linen, and a week's growth of beard dirtily stubbled his chin,--in a word, he was a man from whom M. Chateaudoux's prim soul positively shrank. M. Chateaudoux went quickly by, fearing to be pestered for alms. The hawker, however, remained seated upon the bench, drawing idle patterns upon the gravel with a hazel stick stolen from a hedgerow.  The next afternoon the hawker was in the avenue again, only this time on a bench at the opposite end; and again he paid no heed to M. Chateaudoux, but sat moodily scraping the gravel with his stick.  On the third afternoon M. Chateaudoux found the hawker seated in the middle of the avenue and over against the door of the guarded villa. M. Chateaudoux, when his timidity slept, was capable of good nature. There was a soldier with a loaded musket in full view. The hawker, besides, had not pestered him. He determined to buy some small thing,--a mirror, perhaps, which was always useful,--and he approached the hawker, who for his part wearily flicked"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13567"],["title","Clementina (#4)"],["body"," gravel with his stick and drew a curve here and a line there until, as M. Chateaudoux stopped before the bench, there lay sketched at his feet the rude semblance of a crown. The stick swept over it the next instant and left the gravel smooth.  But M. Chateaudoux had seen, and his heart fluttered and sank. For here were plots, possibly dangers, most certainly trepidations. He turned his back as though he had seen nothing, and constraining himself to a slow pace walked towards the door of the villa. But the hawker was now at his side, whining in execrable German and a strong French accent the remarkable value of his wares. There were samplers most exquisitely worked, jewels for the most noble gentleman's honoured sweetheart, and purses which emperors would give a deal to buy. Chateaudoux was urged to take notice that emperors would give sums to lay a hand on the hawker's purses.  M. Chateaudoux pretended not to hear.  \"I want nothing,\" he said, \"nothing in the world;\" and he repeated the statement in order to drown the other's voice.  \"A purse, good gentleman,\" persisted the hawker, and he dangled one before Chateaudoux's eyes. Not for anything would Chateaudoux take that purse.  \"Go away,\" he cried; \"I have a sufficiency of purses, and I will not be plagued by you.\"  They were now at the steps of the villa, and the sentry, lifting the butt of his musket, roughly thrust the hawker back.  \"What have you there? Bring your basket here,\" said he; and to Chateaudoux's consternation the hawker immediately offered the purse to the sentinel.  \"It is only the poor who have kind hearts,\" he said; \"here's the proper purse for a soldier. It is so hard to get the money out that a man is saved an ocean of drink.\"  The hawker's readiness destroyed any suspicions the sentinel may have felt.  \"Go away,\" he said, \"quick!\"  \"You will buy the purse?\"  The sentinel raised his musket again.  \"Then the kind gentleman will,\" said the hawker, and he thrust the purse into M. Chateaudoux's reluctant hand. Chateaudoux could feel within the purse a folded paper. He was committed now without a doubt, and in an extreme alarm he flung a coin into the roadway and got him into the house. The sentinel carelessly dropped the butt of his musket on the coin.  \"Go,\" said he, and with a sudden kick he lifted the hawker half across the road. The hawker happened to be Charles Wogan, who took a little matter like that with the necessary philosophy. He picked himself up and limped off.  Now the next day a remarkable thing happened. M. Chateaudoux swerved from the regularity of his habits. He walked along the avenue, it is true; but at the end of it he tripped down a street and turned out of that into another which brought him to the arcades. He did not appear to enjoy his walk; indeed, any hurrying footsteps behind startled him exceedingly and made his face turn white and red, and his body hot and cold. However, he proceeded along the arcades to the cathedral, which he entered; and just as the clock struck half-past three, in a dark corner opposite to the third of the great statues he drew his handkerchief from his pocket.  The handkerchief flipped out a letter which fell onto the ground. In the gloom it was barely visible; and M. Chateaudoux walked on, apparently unconscious of his loss. But a comfortable citizen in a snuff-coloured suit picked it up and walked straight out of the cathedral to the Golden Fleece Inn in the Hochstrasse, where he lodged. He went up into his room and examined the letter. It was superscribed \"To M. Chateaudoux,\" and the seal was broken. Nevertheless, the finder did not scruple to read it. It was a love-letter to the little gentleman from one Friederika.  \"I am heart-broken,\" wrote Friederika, \"but my fidelity to my Chateaudoux has not faltered, nor will not, whatever I may be called upon to endure. I cannot, however, be so undutiful as to accept my Chateaudoux's addresses without my father's consent; and my mother, who is of the same mind with me, insists that even with that consent a runaway marriage is not to be thought of unless my Chateaudoux can provide me with a suitable woman for an attendant.\"  These conditions fulfilled, Friederika was willing to follow her Chateaudoux to the world's end. The comfortable citizen in the snuff-coloured suit sat for some while over that letter with a strange light upon his face and a smile of great happiness. The comfortable citizen was Charles Wogan, and he could dissociate the obstructions of the mother from the willingness of the girl.  The October evening wove its veils from the mountain crests across the valleys; the sun and the daylight had gone from the room before Wogan tore that letter up and wrote another to the Chevalier at Bologna, telling him that the Princess Clementina would venture herself gladly if he could secure the consent of Prince Sobieski, her father. And the next morning he drove out in a carriage towards Ohlau in Silesia.  It was as the Chevalier Warner that he had first journeyed thither to solicit for his King the Princess Clementina's hand. Consequently he used the name again. Winter came upon him as he went; the snow gathered thick upon the hills and crept down into the valleys, encumbering his path. The cold nipped his bones; he drove beneath great clouds and through a stinging air, but of these discomforts he was not sensible. For the mission he was set upon filled his thoughts and ran like a fever in his blood. He lay awake at nights inventing schemes of evasion, and each morning showed a flaw, and the schemes crumbled. Not that his faith faltered. At some one moment he felt sure the perfect plan, swift and secret, would be revealed to him, and he lived to seize the moment. The people with whom he spoke became as shadows; the inns where he rested were confused into a common semblance. He was like a man in a trance, seeing ever before his eyes the guarded villa at Innspruck, and behind the walls, patient and watchful, the face of the chosen woman; so that it was almost with surprise that he looked down one afternoon from the brim of a pass in the hills and saw beneath him, hooded with snow, the roofs and towers of Ohlau.  At Ohlau Wogan came to the end of his luck. From the moment when he presented his letter he was aware of it. The Prince was broken by his humiliation and the sufferings of his wife and daughter. He was even inclined to resent them at the expense of the Chevalier, for in his welcome to Wogan there was a measure of embarrassment. His shoulders, which had before been erect, now stooped, his eyes were veiled, the fire had burnt out in him; he was an old man visibly ageing to his grave. He read the letter and re-read it.  \"No,\" said he, impatiently; \"I must now think of my daughter. Her dignity and her birth forbid that she should run like a criminal in fear of capture, and at the peril very likely of her life, to a king who, after all, is as yet without a crown.\" And then seeing Wogan flush at the words, he softened them. \"I frankly say to you, Mr. Warner, that I know no one to whom I would sooner entrust my daughter than yourself, were I persuaded to this project. But it is doomed to fail. It would make us the laughing-stock of Europe, and I ask you to forget it. Do you fancy the Emperor guards my daughter so ill that you, single-handed, can take her from beneath his hand?\"  \"Your Highness, I shall choose some tried friends to help me.\"  \"There is no single chance of success. I ask you to forget it and to pass your Christmas here as my very good friend. The sight is longer in age, Mr. Warner, than in youth, and I see far enough now to know that the days of Don Quixote are dead. Here is a matter where all Europe is ranged and alert on one side or the other. You cannot practise secrecy. At Ohlau your face is known, your incognito too. Mr. Warner came to Ohlau once before, and the business on which he came is common knowledge. The motive of your visit now, which I tell you openly is very grateful to me, will surely be suspected.\"  Wogan had reason that night to acknowledge the justice of the Prince's argument. He accepted his hospitality, thinking that with time he would persuade him to allow the attempt; and after supper, while making riddles in verse to amuse some of the ladies of the court, one of them, the Countess of Berg, came forward from a corner where she had been busy with pencil and paper and said, \"It is our turn now. Here, Mr. Warner, is an acrostic which I ask you to solve for me.\" And with a smile which held a spice of malice she handed him the paper. Upon it there were ten rhymed couplets. Wogan solved the first four, and found that the initial letters of the words were C, L, E, M. The answer to the acrostic was \"Clementina.\" Wogan gave the paper back.  \"I can make neither head nor tail of it,\" said he. \"The attempt is beyond my powers.\"  \"Ah,\" said she, drily, \"you own as much? I would never have believed you would have owned it.\"  \"But what is the answer?\" asked a voice at which Wogan started.  \"The answer,\" replied the Countess, \"is Mary, Queen of Scots, who was most unjustly imprisoned in Fotheringay,\" and she tore the paper into tiny pieces.  Wogan turned towards the voice which had so startled him and saw the gossamer lady whom he had befriended on the road from Florence. At once he rose and bowed to her.  \"I should have presented you before to my friend, Lady Featherstone,\" said the Countess, \"but it seems you are already acquainted.\"  \"Indeed, Mr. Warner did me a great service at a pinch,\" said Lady Featherstone. \"He was my postillion, though I never paid him, as I do now in thanks.\"  \"Your postillion!\" cried one or two of the ladies, and they gathered about the great stove as Lady Featherstone told the story of Wogan's charioting.  \"I bade him hurry,\" said she, \"and he outsped my bidding. Never was there a postillion so considerately inconsiderate. I was tossed like a tennis ball, I was one black bruise, I bounced"]]]
