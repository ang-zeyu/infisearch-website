The apostle Peter declares, \"The heavens and the earth which now are, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire, against _the day of judgment_, and perdition of ungodly men.\" According to this account of the judgment, it will occur at the same time with the destruction of the world; \"when,\" as the same apostle declares, \"the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth, also, and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.\" Paul gives a similar account of the _time_, as he comforts the church at Thessalonica, under persecution, with the prospect of the judgment, \"when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Indeed, if God is to \"judge the whole world in righteousness,\" what other occasion would seem so proper, as when the last of our race have finished their work on the earth, and the world itself is about to be destroyed? Would it not appear most suitable, that the public and final decision of our destiny, should immediately succeed the winding up of this world's drama?--the termination of all earthly allotments? When, if not at that deeply interesting crisis, will all things be ready for the great trial? _The final judgment, then, will take place after our death, and at the end of the world_. We next inquire,   II. _What are the objects, which the Judgment is designed to accomplish?_  On this point, it becomes creatures of yesterday to speak with profound humility, and especially to beware of contradicting what is revealed. The objects which Jehovah will accomplish by the universal judgment, are unquestionably vast and momentous, beyond all conception. Yet some of them are obvious to reason, or are plainly revealed.  Every person has experienced inconvenience and perplexity from the circumstance, that the real characters of men, in the present life, are but partially disclosed. Much the larger portion of human actions pass unobserved by the world; or the motives which prompt them are concealed. One design of the judgment, then, is to uncover these hidden springs, and lay open every dark retreat of human conduct. We are told, \"there is nothing hid which shall not be revealed;\" that \"God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil;\" that he \"will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels the heart.\"  Another design of the judgment, is publicly to assign to men their proper deserts. This, we have before suggested, is not done on the earth. \"All things here come alike to all.\" \"There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked.\" But the future judgment is characterized, as the day of \"revelation of the righteous judgment of God;\" \"in the which he will judge the world in righteousness;\" and will \"render to every man according to his deeds.\" The mystery involved in the prosperity of the wicked, and in the unequal allotments, which have here marked the dispensations of Providence, will then cease for ever; and it will then be seen and felt, that every one is treated according to the strictest principles of wisdom and justice.  Another special design of the judgment, is to manifest and gloriously exalt the perfections of Jehovah. Revelation has indeed proclaimed his perfections, in language which need not be misunderstood. But his providence has often interposed a cloud between them and the eyes of men. We do not comprehend the wisdom of present occurrences. We see not the end from the beginning. A complete disclosure of both, will show to the universe the deep counsels of God, and the consistent and benevolent character of all his operations. He will then appear in the greatness of his _power_, and _majesty_--as he summons the dead from their graves, and folds up the earth and the heavens, like a decayed garment, to be laid aside. He will then appear in the glory of his _justice_, his _holiness_, and his _truth_,--while he examines, before his dread tribunal, the risen and assembled millions of our race, and renders to every one according to his works. All his perfections will then be illustriously displayed; for, says the apostle, \"He shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.\"  But this glory of the Divinity is specially to shine forth in the person of the Son. He it was, that \"being found in fashion as a man, humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\" Accordingly, \"the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.\" It is the _Son_ who will come \"in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory\"; whom \"every eye shall see;\" and who, \"in his own glory, and in the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels,\" shall \"judge the world in righteousness.\" Then will he who humbled himself, and \"became obedient unto death,\" be publicly recognised as \"the Mighty God,\" \"by whom, and for whose pleasure, all things are, and were created.\" Then will \"every tongue confess that he is Lord.\" The conviction will then be universal, \"that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.\" This leads us to inquire,   III. _What connexion will the Judgment have with our future and eternal condition?_  Here let us not indulge in vain speculations, but examine simply the word of God. According to the Scriptures, the judgment will result in assigning to men _very different allotments_. It will recognise among them two entirely different and opposite classes of character. One of these classes, which the Bible denominates \"the righteous,\" will be graciously acquitted by the Judge, and publicly treated as his friends. The other, comprising all the impenitent, will be as publicly condemned, and driven from his presence. They \"will have judgment without mercy.\" Such is plainly the account which Christ and the sacred writers have given of the final awards to the righteous and the wicked. We have the account in detail. Says the Saviour himself, \"When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" \"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.\" And again; \"The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; _they that have done good_, unto the resurrection of _life_; and _they that have done evil_, unto the resurrection of _damnation_\". Thus broad and fearful is the discrimination which the great day will make between the righteous and the wicked. So entirely different are the awards in reserve for the two different classes of mankind. The difference will be great, as between holiness and sin; between cheerful submission to the will and providence of God, and unyielding rebellion against him; between cordial faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and wilful rejection of the only Saviour; between the splendour and joy of the celestial Paradise, and the gloominess and misery of hell. No wonder, then, that \"as Paul reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled.\" There will, indeed, be fearful reason for \"weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth,\" with those who shall then \"see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and themselves thrust out.\"  We are not to forget, my hearers, that these different awards of the judgment day will be _irreversible_ and literally _endless_. All admit this conclusion, with respect to the _righteous_. But if the righteous are _finally acquitted_ at the judgment, so are the wicked _finally condemned_. If the righteous are said to enter into \"_life eternal_,\" so are the wicked to \"go away into _everlasting punishment_.\" The Scriptures say not one word of any reprieve from this condemnation, or of any other period of merciful visitation. But they close with the most solemn assurance, that, from that awful day, he that is unjust shall be unjust still; and he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; and he that is holy shall be holy still. Other passages, of similar import, might be quoted: but if men will pour contempt on a single declaration of Jehovah--if they will _make God a liar_--they would not be persuaded, though his voice from the heavens were a thousand times repeated. And _because they receive not the love of the truth_, _that they might be saved_, most justly may he _send them strong delusion_, _that they should believe a lie_, and _be damned._  I have thus endeavoured, with much brevity, to give a scriptural view of the final Judgment. On a subject so tremendously awful, I have chosen to present simply God's testimony. A practical inference from the whole is,--that the present life must be regarded as probationary. We are living here as responsible agents, continually adding to the number of actions, for which we must give account to God. How solemnly interesting, then, is this scene of our earthly pilgrimage! How"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13824"],["title","The National Preacher, Vol. 2 No. 7 Dec. 1827 (#5)"],["body","valuable is time! How infinitely precious are the means of grace!--particularly those invitations of mercy, which meet us in the word of God, and address us from the sacred desk.  You, my fellow sinners, are the very individuals who must stand at the judgment-seat of Christ. You must mingle in that vast multitude, which the voice of the archangel and the trump of God shall assemble. And when your characters are all laid open, you must pass off to the right hand, or to the left, accordingly as it shall appear, that you have repented, and believed on the Son of God, or have neglected this great salvation. And are you diligently preparing for that day? Are you working out your salvation with fear and trembling? Are you _agonizing_ to enter in at the strait gate? Are you escaping for your life?  Fellow mortals, your time of preparation may be far more brief than you now think. A few, _very few_ more opportunities for prayer, and reconciliation with God, and your account is sealed up. While you hesitate, the recording angel may be writing your condemnation. In such circumstances, what are worldly honours, or wealth, or all your hopes of enjoyment here? The life, the _eternal life_ of the _soul_, is the _one thing needful_--the _only_ thing really important. You will realize this truth, when the last trumpet is sounding through the universe, and, with increasing agony or ecstasy, millions of ages after the final sentence is pronounced. O, then, consider it _now_. Prepare for that judgment, _now_. To-morrow! where is it? Repent _to-morrow_! You may have far other work to do. God, and conscience, and your immortal interests plead, \"_To-day_, if you will hear his voice, harden not your heart.\" \"Behold, _now_ is the accepted time; behold, _now_ is the day of salvation.\" _Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. For he cometh, for he cometh, to judge the world, in righteousness to judge the earth, and the people with his truth_.     TERMS  OF THE  NATIONAL PREACHER.   I.
