I sincerely hope, dear, that your intended, Ralph Jackson, will be superior to this male idiosyncrasy, to term it mildly, and allow you a stated sum monthly. The home is the woman's kingdom, and she should be allowed to think for it, to buy for it, and not to be cramped by lack of money to do as she thinks best for it.\"  \"But, Aunt Sarah, some housewives are so silly that husbands cannot really be blamed for withholding money from them and preventing them from frittering it away in useless extravagance.\"  \"Mary, wise wives should not suffer for those who are silly and extravagant. I don't like to be sarcastic, but with the majority of the men, silliness appeals to them more than common sense. Men like to feel their superiority to us. However, though inexperienced, Mary, you aren't silly or extravagant, and Ralph could safely trust you with his money. It makes a woman so self-respecting, puts her on her mettle, to have money to do as she pleases with, to be trusted, relied upon as a reasoning, responsible being. A man, especially a young husband, makes a grave mistake when he looks upon his wife as only a toy to amuse him in his leisure moments and not as one to be trusted to aid him in his life work. A trusted young housewife, with a reasonable and regular allowance at her command, be she ever so inexperienced, will soon plan to have wholesome, nutritious food at little cost, instead of not knowing until a half hour before meal time what she will serve. She would save money and the family would be better nourished; nevertheless, I would impress it on the young housewife not to be too saving or practice too close economy, especially when buying milk and eggs, as there is nothing more nutritious or valuable. A palatable macaroni and cheese; eggs or a combination of eggs and milk, are dishes which may be substituted occasionally, at less expense, for meat. A pound of macaroni and cheese equals a pound of steak in food value. Take time and trouble to see that all food be well cooked and served, both in an attractive and appetizing manner. Buy the cheaper cuts of stewing meats, and by long, slow simmering, they will become sweet and tender and of equal nutritive value as higher priced sirloins and tenderloins.  \"But, Mary, I've not yet finished that trunk and its contents. That slightly-faded pink chambray I'll cut up into quilt blocks. Made up with white patches, and quilted nicely, a pretty quilt lined with white, will be evolved. I have such a pretty design of pink and white called the 'Winding Way,' very simple to make. The beauty of the quilt consists altogether in the manner in which the blocks are put together, or it might be made over the pattern called 'The Flying Dutchman.' From that tan linen skirt may be made a laundry bag, shoe pocket, twine bag, a collar bag and a table runner, the only expense being several skeins of green embroidery silk, and a couple yards of green cord to draw the bags up with, and a couple of the same-hued skirt braids for binding edges, and,\" teasingly, \"Mary, you might embroider Ralph Jackson's initials on the collar and laundry bag.\"  [Illustration:  A-12 Pine Tree Quilt A-13 Tree of Life A-14 Pineapple A-15 Enlarged Block of Winding Way Quilt A-16 Lost Rose in the Wilderness A-17 Tree Quilt]  Mary blushed rosily red and exclaimed in an embarrassed manner, most bewitchingly, \"Oh!\"  Aunt Sarah laughed. She thought to have Mary look that way 'twas worth teasing her.  \"Well, Mary, we can in leisure moments, from that coarse, white linen skirt which you have discarded, make bureau scarfs, sideboard cover, or a set of scalloped table mats to place under hot dishes on your dining-room table. I will give you pieces of asbestos to slip between the linen mats when finished. They are a great protection to the table. You could also make several small guest towels with deep, hemstitched ends with your initials on. You embroider so beautifully, and the drawn work you do is done as expertly as that of the Mexican women.\"  \"Oh, Aunt Sarah, how ingenious you are.\"  \"And, Mary, your rag carpet shall not be lacking. We shall tear up those partly-worn muslin skirts into strips one-half inch in width, and use the dyes left over from dyeing Easter eggs. I always save the dye for this purpose, they come in such pretty, bright colors. The rags, when sewed together with some I have in the attic, we'll have woven into a useful carpet for the home you are planning.'  \"Oh! Aunt Sarah,\" exclaimed Mary, \"do you mean a carpet like the one in the spare bedroom?\"  \"Yes, my dear, exactly like that, if you wish.\"  \"Indeed I do, and I think one like that quite good enough to have in a dining-room. I think it so pretty. It does not look at all like a common rag carpet.\"  \"No, my dear, it is nothing very uncommon. It is all in the way it is woven. Instead of having two gay rainbow stripes about three inches wide running through the length of the carpet, I had it woven with the ground work white and brown chain to form checks. Then about an inch apart were placed two threads of two shades of red woolen warp, alternating with two threads of two shades of green, across the whole width, running the length of the carpet. It has been greatly admired, as it is rather different from that usually woven. All the rag carpets I found in the house when we moved here, made by John's mother, possessed very wide stripes of rainbow colors, composed of shaded reds, yellows, blues and greens. You can imagine how very gorgeous they were, and so very heavy. Many of the country weavers use linen chain or warp instead of cotton, and always use wool warp for the stripes.\"  \"Aunt Sarah, I want something so very much for the Colonial bedroom I should like to have when I have a home of my very own.\"  \"What is it, dear? Anything, e'en to the half of my kingdom,\" laughingly replied her Aunt.  \"Why, I'd love to have several rag rugs like those in your bedroom, which you call 'New Colonial' rugs.\"  \"Certainly, my dear. They are easily made from carpet rags. I have already planned in my mind a pretty rag rug for you, to be made from your old, garnet merino shirtwaist, combined with your discarded cravenette stormcoat.  \"And you'll need some pretty quilts, also,\" said her Aunt.  \"I particularly admire the tree quilts,\" said Mary.  \"You may have any one you choose; the one called 'Tree of Paradise,' another called 'Pineapple Design,' which was originally a border to 'Fleur de lis' quilt or 'Pine Tree,' and still another called 'Tree of Life,' and 'The Lost Rose in the Wilderness.'\"  \"They are all so odd,\" said Mary, \"I scarcely know which one I think prettiest.\"  \"All are old-fashioned quilts, which I prize highly,\" continued her Aunt. \"Several I pieced together when a small girl, I think old-time patchwork too pretty and useful an accomplishment to have gone out of fashion.  \"You shall have a small stand cover like the one you admired so greatly, given me by Aunt Cornelia. It is very simple, the materials required being a square of yard-wide unbleached muslin. In the centre of this baste a large, blue-flowered handkerchief with cream-colored ground, to match the muslin. Turn up a deep hem all around outside edge; cut out quarter circles of the handkerchief at each of four corners; baste neatly upon the muslin, leaving a space of muslin the same width as the hem around each quarter circle; briarstitch all turned-in edges with dark-blue embroidery silk, being washable, these do nicely as covers for small tables or stands on the veranda in Summertime.\"  \"Aunt Sarah,\" ecstatically exclaimed Mary, \"you are a wizard to plan so many useful things from a trunk of apparently useless rags. What a treasure Uncle has in you. I was fretting about having so little to make my home attractive, but I feel quite elated at the thought of having a carpet and rugs already planned, besides the numerous other things evolved from your fertile brain.\"  Aunt Sarah loved a joke. She held up an old broadcloth cape. \"Here is a fine patch for Ralph Jackson's breeches, should he ever become sedentary and need one.\"  Mary reddened and looked almost offended and was at a loss for a reply.  [Illustration:  A-18 Fleur DeLys Quilt A-19 Oak Leaf Quilt A-20 One Block of Fleur DeLys Quilt A-21 Winding Way Quilt A-22 Tulip Quilt A-23 Flower Pot Quilt]  Greatly amused, Aunt Sarah quoted ex-President Roosevelt: \"'Tis time for the man with the patch to come forward and the man with the dollar to step back,'\" and added, \"Never mind, Mary, your Ralph is such an industrious, hustling young man that he will never need a patch to step forward, I prophesy that with such a helpmeet and 'Haus Frau' as you, Mary, he'll always be most prosperous and happy. Kiss me, dear.\"  Mary did so, and her radiant smile at such praise from her honored relative was beautiful to behold.  [Illustration: OLD RAG CARPET]     CHAPTER IX.  POETRY AND PIE.   \"Aunt Sarah,\" questioned Mary one day, \"do you mind if I copy some of your recipes?\"  \"Certainly not, my dear,\" replied her Aunt.  \"And I'd like to copy some of the poems, also, I never saw any one else have so much poetry in a book of cooking recipes.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" replied her Aunt, \"but you know, Mary, I believe in combining pleasure with my work, and our lives are made up of poetry and prose, and some lives are so very prosy. Many times when too tired to look up a favorite volume of poems, it has rested me to turn the pages of my recipe book and find some helpful thought, and a good housewife will always keep her book of recipes where it may be readily found for reference. I think, Mary, the poem 'Pennsylvania,' by Lydia M.D. O'Neil, a fine one, and I never tire of reading it over and over again. I have always felt grateful to my old schoolmaster. Professor T----, for teaching me, when a school girl, to love the writing of Longfellow, Whittier,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13545"],["title","Mary at the Farm and Book of Recipes Compiled during Her Visit (#8)"],["body","ryant, Tennyson and other well-known poets. I still, in memory, hear him repeat 'Thanatopsis,' by Bryant and 'The Builders,' by Longfellow. The rhymes of the 'Fireside Poet' are easily understood, and never fail to touch the heart of common folk. I know it appears odd to see so many of my favorite poems sandwiched in between old, valued cooking recipes, but, Mary, the happiness of the home life depends so largely on the food we consume. On the preparation and selection of the food we eat depends our health, and on our health is largely dependent our happiness and prosperity. Who is it has said, 'The discovery of a new dish makes more for the happiness of man than the discovery of a star'? So, dearie, you see there is not such a great difference between the one who writes a poem and the one who makes a pie. I think cooking should be considered one of the fine arts--and the woman who prepares a dainty, appetizing dish of food, which appeals to the sense of taste, should be considered as worthy of praise as the artist who paints a fine picture to gratify our sense of sight. I try to mix all the poetry possible in prosaic every-day life. We country farmers' wives, not having the opportunities of our more fortunate city sisters, such as witnessing plays from Shakespeare, listening to symphony concerts, etc., turn to 'The Friendship of Books,' of which Washington Irving writes: 'Cheer us with the true friendship, which never deceived hope nor deserted sorrow.'\"  \"Yes,\" said Mary, \"but remember, Aunt Sarah, Chautauqua will be held next Summer in a near-by town, and, as Uncle John is one of the guarantors, you will wish to attend regularly and will, I know, enjoy hearing the excellent lectures, music and concerts.\"  \"Yea,\" replied her Aunt, \"Chautauqua meetings will commence the latter part of June, and I will expect you and Ralph to visit us then. I think Chautauqua a godsend to country women, especially farmers' wives; it takes them away from their monotonous daily toil and gives them new thoughts and ideas.\"  \"I can readily understand, Aunt Sarah, why the poem, 'Life's Common Things,' appeals to you; it is because you see beauty in everything. Aunt Sarah, where did you get this very old poem, 'The Deserted City'?\"  \"Why, that was given me by John's Uncle, who thought the poem fine.\"      \"Sad is the sight, the city once so fair!     An hundred palaces lie buried there;       Her lofty towers are fallen, and creepers grow       O'er marbled dome and shattered portico.      \"Once in the gardens, lovely girls at play,     Culled the bright flowers, and gently touched the spray;       But now wild creatures in their savage joy       Tread down the flowers and the plants destroy.      \"By night no torches in the windows gleam;     By day no women in their beauty beam;       The smoke has ceased--the spider there has spread       His snares in safety--and all else is dead.\"  \"Indeed, it is a 'gem,'\" said Mary, after slowly reading aloud parts of several stanzas.  \"Yes,\" replied her Aunt, \"Professor Schmidt tells me the poem was written by Kalidasa (the Shakespeare of Hindu literature), and was written 1800 years before Goldsmith gave us his immortal work, 'The Deserted Village.'\"  \"I like the poem, 'Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel,'\" said Mary, \"and I think this true by Henry Ward Beecher:\"      \"'Do not be troubled because you have not great virtues,     God made a million spears of grass where He made one tree;     The earth is fringed and carpeted not with forests but with grasses,     Only have enough of little virtues and common fidelities,     And you need not mourn because you are neither a hero nor a saint.'  \"This is a favorite little poem of mine, Aunt Sarah. I'll just write it on this blank page in your book.\"      There's a little splash of sunshine and a little spot of shade,     always somewhere near,     The wise bask in the sunshine, but the foolish choose the shade.     The wise are gay and happy, on the foolish, sorrow's laid,     And the fault's their own, I fear.      For the little splash of sunshine and the little spot of shade     Are here for joint consumption, for comparison are made;     We're all meant to be happy, not too foolish or too staid.     And the right dose to be taken is some sunshine mixed with shade.  \"Aunt Sarah, I see there is still space on this page to write another poem, a favorite of mine. It is called, 'Be Strong,' by Maltbie Davenport.\"          Be Strong!         We are not here to play, to dream, to drift;         We have hard word to do, and loads to lift,         Shun not the struggle; face it, 'tis God's gift.          Be Strong!         Say not the days are evil--who's to blame?         And fold the hands and acquiesce--Oh, shame!         Stand up, speak out, and bravely, in God's name.          Be Strong!         It matters not how deep intrenched the wrong,         How hard the battle goes, the day how long;         Faint not, fight on! Tomorrow comes the song,   LIFE'S COMMON THINGS.          How lovely are life's common things.           When health flows in the veins;         The golden sunshine of the days           When Phoebus holds the reins;          The floating clouds against the blue;           The fragrance of the air;         The nodding flowers by the way;           The green grass everywhere;          The feathery beauty of the elm,           With graceful-swaying boughs.         Where nesting songbirds find a home           And the night wind sighs and soughs;          The hazy blue of distant hill,           With wooded slope and crest;         The crimson sky when low at night           The sun sinks in the West;          The thrilling grandeur of the storm,           The lightning's vivid flash,         The mighty rush of wind and rain,           The thunder's awful crash.          And then the calm that follows storm,           And rainbow in the sky;         The rain-washed freshness of the earth--           A singing bird near by.          And oh, the beauty of the night!           Its hush, its thrill, its charm;         The twinkling brilliance of its stars;           Its tranquil peace and calm.          Oh, loving fatherhood of God           To give us every day         The lovely common things of life           To brighten all the way!          (Susan M. Perkins, in the Boston Transcript)   ABOU BEN ADHEM AND THE ANGEL.      Abou Ben Adhem--may his tribe increase--     Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace     And saw, within the moonlight of his room,     Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,     An angel writing in a book of gold.     Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,     And to the presence in the room he said:     \"What writest thou?\" The vision raised his head,     And with a look made of all sweet accord,     Answered: \"The names of those who love the Lord.\"     \"And is mine one?\" said Abou. \"Nay, not so,\"     Replied the angel. Abou spoke low,     But cheerily still, and Said, \"I pray thee, then,     write me as one that loves his fellow-men.\"     The angel wrote and vanished. The next night     It came again, with a great, wakening light,     And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,     And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.      LEIGH HUNT.     CHAPTER X.   SIBYLLA LINSABIGLER.  A very original character was Sibylla Linsabigler, who had been a member of the Landis household several years. She was Aunt Sarah's only maid servant, but she disliked being referred to as a servant, and when she overheard \"Fritz\" Schmidt, as he passed the Landis farm on his way to the creek for a days fishing, call to Mary: \"Miss Midleton, will you please send the butter over with the servant today, as I shall not return home in time for dinner\" Sibylla said, \"I ain't no servant. I'm hired girl What does that make out if I do work here? Pop got mad with me 'cause I wouldn't work at home no more for him and Mom without they paid me. They got three more girls to home yet that can do the work. My Pop owns a big farm and sent our 'Chon' to the college, and it's mean 'fer' him not to give us girls money for dress, so I work out, 'Taint right the way us people what has to work are treated these days,\" said Sibylla to herself, as she applied the broom vigorously to the gay-flowered carpet in the Landis parlor. \"Because us folks got to work ain't no reason why them tony people over to the Perfessor's should call me a 'servant.' I guess I know I milk the cows, wash dishes, scrub floors, and do the washin' and ir'nin' every week, but I'm no 'servant,' I'm just as good any day as that good-fer-nothin' Perfesser's son,\" continued Sibylla, growing red in the face with indignation. \"Didn't I hear that worthless scamp, Fritz Schmidt, a-referrin' to me and a-sayin' to Miss Midleton fer the 'servant' to bring over the butter? Betch yer life this here 'servant' ain't a-goin' to allow eddicated people to make a fool of her. First chance I get I'll give that Perfesser a piece of my mind.\"  Sibylla's opportunity came rather unexpectedly. The gentle, mild-mannered Professor was on good terms with his sturdy, energetic neighbor, John Landis, and frequently visited him for a neighborly chat. On this particular day he called as usual and found Sibvlla in the mood described.  \"Good afternoon, Sibylla,\" said the Professor, good-naturedly. \"How are you today?\"  \"I'd be a whole lot better if some people weren't so smart,\" replied Sibylla, venting her feelings on the broom. \"Should think a Perfesser would feel himself too big to talk to a 'servant'.\"  \"On the contrary, my dear girl, I feel honored. I presume you are not feeling as well as usual. What makes you think it is condescension for me to address you?\" asked the genial old man, kindly.  \"Well, since you ask me, I don't mind a-tellin' you. Yesterday your son insulted me, I won't take no insult from nobody, I am just as good as what you are, even if I hain't got much book larnin'.\"  With this"]]]
