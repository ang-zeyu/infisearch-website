Neither does it matter much when or how a man leaves this life; the vital thing is what he has done and how he has done it up to the point of departure. The Lord will take care of the rest.\"  As the two men went slowly along the narrow passage way to their state rooms that night, the older man said to the other, \"I guess you're right, my brother; yes; you are right. Good night, and pleasant sleep.\"     CHAPTER II.   The next morning the sky was clear and the sea was much smoother. The sun shone bright and warm; more people came on deck, rejoicing that they could live in the vigor of the open rather than in their stuffy state rooms. The two seasick elders thought it wiser to remain quietly in their berths for another day, so Chester and Elder Malby had the day to themselves. As the accident of the night before became known to the passengers, it was the topic of conversation for some time.  That afternoon Chester and his companion found a cosy corner on deck away from the cigar smoke, and had a long heart to heart talk. The fact of the matter was that the young man found comfort in the society of his older brother. For the first time in nearly two years Chester could pour out his heart to sympathetic ears, and he found much joy in doing this.  \"Yes,\" said Chester to a question, \"I should like to tell you about myself. When my story gets tiresome, call my attention to the porpoises, or declare that you can see a whale.\"  \"I promise,\" laughed the other.  \"Well, to begin at the very beginning, I was born in a suburb of Chicago, and lived in and near that city most of my life. My mother's name was Anna Lawrence. I never knew my father, not even his name. Yes, I can talk freely about it to you. The time was when I shunned even the thoughts of my earthly origin and my childhood days, but I have gotten over that. I have learned to face the world and all the truth it has for me.  \"When I was but a child, my mother married Hugh Elston. Shortly after, they both heard the gospel preached by a 'Mormon' elder, and they accepted it. I had been placed in the care of some of my relatives, and when my mother now wished to take me, they would not give me up. They were, of course, fearful that I, too, would become a 'Mormon.' Mr. Elston and my mother went west to Utah. I was sent to school, obtained a fairly good education, and while yet a young man, was conducting a successful business.  \"I had nearly forgotten that I had a parent at all, when one day, my mother, without announcement, came to Chicago. She had left her husband. Mother did not say much to any of us, but I took it for granted that she had been abused among the 'terrible Mormons.' After a time I took a trip out to Utah to see about it, meaning to find this Mr. Elston and compel him to do the right thing for my mother. Well, I went, I saw, and was conquered. Mr. Elston was a widower living in a spot of green called Piney Ridge Cottage amid the sage-brush desert,--living there alone with his daughter Julia. And this Julia--well--Do you see any porpoises, Brother Malby?\"  \"Not yet. Go on.\"  \"Mr. Elston is a fine, good-hearted man,--a gentleman in very deed. He soon found out who I was and invited me to his home. Julia was mistress there. In the midst of the desert, these two had created a beautiful home. I went to their Sunday School and their meetings. I read Mormon books. My eyes were opened to the truth, and I was ready to accept it.\"  \"Thanks to Julia,\" suggested the listener with a sly glance at Chester.  \"Yes; thanks to Julia, Brother Malby; but not in the sense you hint at. I think I would have accepted the gospel, even had there been no Julia mixed up with the finding of it. But Julia helped. She was a living example of what 'Mormonism' can do for a person, and when I looked at her, learned her thoughts through her words, and saw her life by her every-day deeds, I said to myself, 'A system of religion that produces such a soul, cannot be bad.' Yes; she was a wonderful help; but I repeat that had the truth come to me by other means and other ways, I believe I should have accepted it.\"  \"Forgive me for the thoughtless remark,\" said Elder Malby.  \"O, I know how justifiable you are for it, so you are forgiven.\"  \"Did you join the Church in Utah?\"  \"No; I went back to Chicago. Away from Utah, from Piney Ridge Cottage and its influence. I pondered and prayed. I found the elders there and was baptized. Then I went to Salt Lake City, where Julia had gone to attend school while her father was away on a mission to England.\" Chester paused, looking out on the sea. \"You don't blame me for falling in love with Julia, do you?\" asked he.  \"I don't blame you a bit.\"  \"But there was someone else, a young fellow who had grown up as a neighbor to her. He also went on a mission, and then I believe Julia discovered that she thought more of Glen Curtis than of me. I do not now blame Julia for that. She told me plainly her feelings. I persisted for a time, but in vain--then I went away, and have never been to Utah since.\"  \"And that's the end of your story?\"  \"Oh, no; while I was roaming aimlessly about the country trying to mend a broken heart, mother, becoming uneasy about me, and thinking I was yet in Utah, journeyed out west to find me. The team on the stage-coach which took her out to Julia's home, ran away from the drunken driver, and just before they got to Piney Ridge Cottage the wagon upset on a dug-way, and mother was mortally hurt. She died under Julia's care, and now lies in Mr. Elston's private graveyard near Piney Ridge Cottage beside Mr. Elston's other wife. Let us walk a little.\"  The older man linked his arm into Chester's as they paced the long reach of the promenade deck. They walked for a few minutes, then sat down again.  \"I hope you'll not think I'm a bore, to continue my personal history; but there is something in here,\" said Chester, striking his breast, \"that finds relief in expression to one who understands.\"  \"Go on; tell me all.\"  \"Do you know, I was tempted to 'chuck it all' after I had failed with Julia. I even went so far as to play devilishly near to sin, but thank the Lord, I came to my senses before I was overcome, and I escaped that horror. Oh, but I was storm-tossed for a while--I thought of it yesterday when we had the rough sea--but in time I came out into the calm again, just as we are coming today on this voyage. But not until I had said more than once 'not my will, but thine, O Lord, be done,' and said it from my heart, did I get peace. Then I began to see that the girl had come into my life, not to be my wife, but to turn my life into new channels. I, with the rest of the world of which I was a part, had no definite views or high ideals of life, death, 'and that vast forever;' and something was needed to change my easy-going course. When I realized that Julia Elston had been the instrument of the Lord in doing that, I had to put away resentment and acknowledge the hand of God in it. I read in the parables of our Lord that a certain merchantman had to sell all he had in order to get the purchase money to buy the Pearl of Great Price. Why should it be given me without cost?\"  \"We all have to pay for it.\"  \"And I who had made no sacrifice, railed against fate because I had been asked to pay a trifle--no it was not a trifle; but I have paid, and hope to continue to pay to the last call. Now, what do you say, brother? Tell me what you think.\"  \"Well, you have an interesting story, my brother, and I am glad you look on your experiences in the right light. To get the woman one thinks he ought to get, is, after all, not the whole of life. There are other blessings. To have one's life changed from darkness into light; to have one's journey turned from a downward course to one of eternal exaltation; to obtain a knowledge of the plan of salvation,--these are important. If one is on the right way, and keeps on that way to the end, He who rules the world and the destinies of men, will see to it that all is right. Sometime, somewhere, every man and every woman will come to his own, whether in life or death, in this world, or the next.\"  \"Thank you for saying that. Do you know, I am now glad that Julia did not yield to my entreaties, and marry me out of pity. Think how I would have felt when the realization of that had come to me. * * * * I found this expression of Stevenson the other day, purporting to be a test of a man's fortitude and delicacy: 'To renounce where that shall be necessary, and not to be embittered.' Thank the Lord, I am not embittered. Some time ago I chose this declaration of Paul for my motto: 'But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.'\"  The light of a soul of peace shone from the countenance of the young man. The smile on the lips added only beauty to the strength of the face. He arose, shook himself as if to get rid of all past unpleasantness and weakness, and faced the east as though he were meeting the world with new power. Then the smile changed to a merry laugh as he ran to the railing and cried:  \"See, sure enough, there _is_ a school of porpoises!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The ship was in mid-ocean. The rough weather had wholly ceased. The sea lay glinting like a vast jewel under the slant of the afternoon sun. It was a day of unflecked beauty. The decks were gay with people, some walking, some leaning idly on the rail, some sitting with books in their hands. A few were reading, but most sat with finger in closed book. Why bother to read _about_ life when it could be seen so full and interesting all around.  A day on ship-board is longer than one on shore, and provision must be made to pass it pleasantly. If the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13756"],["title","Story of Chester Lawrence (#3)"],["body","is fair, this is quite a problem. Of course, there are the meals in the well-appointed dining saloon. They break pleasantly into the long monotony. Then there are the deck games; the watching for \"whales\" and passing vessels; the looking at the spinning log in the foaming water at the stern; the marking of the chart, which indicates the distance traversed during the twenty-four hours; the visit to the steerage and the \"stoke hole,\" or boiler room in the depths of the ship; and last, but not least, the getting acquainted with one's fellow passengers. \"Steamer friendships\" are easily made, and in most cases, soon forgotten. The little world of people speeding across the deep from shore to shore, is bound together closely for a few days, and then, its inhabitants scatter.  Chester Lawrence was enjoying every hour of the voyage. On that day practically all sea-sickness had gone. The vacant places at the tables were being filled and the company looked around at each other with pleasant contentment. The steamship company no longer saved on the provisions. The chatty old gentleman at Chester's right was back again after a short absence, and the power of speech had come to the demure lady on his left, with the return of her appetite.  Two places opposite Chester were still vacant at the table. That day as the crowd hastily answered the dinner gong, Chester, being a little tardy, encountered an elderly man and what appeared to be his daughter making their way slowly down the companionway towards the dining room. Chester saw at a glance that neither of them was strong, but both tried to appear able and were bound to help each other. He smiled at their well-meaning endeavors, then without asking leave, took the man's free arm and helped him down the steps, saying,  \"You haven't quite got your sea-legs yet--Now then, steady, and we'll soon be there. Get a good dinner, and that will help.\"  The steward showed them to the two seats opposite Chester which had been vacant so long.  \"Thank you very much,\" said the girl to Chester, with a smile, when the elderly man was well seated. Chester bowed without replying, then went around the table to his own seat.  Somehow that gracious little smile had made Chester's heart flutter for an instant. As he realized it, he said to himself, \"What's the matter with me? Am I getting foolish? It was, certainly a sweet smile, and the thanks were gracious, too; but what of it?\" The first courses were being served. She was sitting opposite him, just a few feet away. He might take a good look at the girl to see if there was anything uncommon about her. He looked down the table, glancing just for an instant opposite. No; there was nothing striking, or to be disturbed about. The girl was still solicitous over her companion, meanwhile eating a little herself. \"I musn't be rude, thought Chester, and then looked again across the table. The man was past middle age. His face was clean shaven, and he was dressed in the garb of a minister. He was a preacher, then. The girl had evidently suffered much from sea-sickness, because her face was pale and somewhat pinched, though there was a tinge of red in her cheeks. That's a pretty chin, and a lovely mouth--and, well, now, what _is_ the matter! Chester Lawrence, attend to your chicken.\"  The minister and his daughter did not remain for the dessert. As they arose, he said:  \"Now, that's pretty good for the first time, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, father, it is,\" she replied. \"You're getting on famously. Shall we try the deck for a while?\"  \"Yes; it will do us both good to get into the air. Run along into your room for a wrap.\"  Chester was tempted to leave his dinner to help them again; but he resisted the temptation. They walked quite firmly now, and as they entered the passageway, the girl glancing back into the room, met Chester's eyes and smiled once more. Again Chester's heart fluttered. It would have been a cold, hardened heart indeed not to have responded to such an appeal.     CHAPTER III.   On the morning of the fourth day out, Chester Lawrence stood watching the antics of a young man, who, coatless and hatless, and made brave by too many visits to the bar, was running up the rope ladders of the mast to a dangerous height. He climbed up to where the ladder met the one on the other side, down which he scrambled with the agility of a monkey. The ladies in the group on deck gasped in fright at his reckless daring. The fellow jumped to the deck from the rail, and made a sweeping bow to the spectators:  \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"'tis nothing at all, I assure you. On shore I am a circus performer, an' I was just practicing a little. Have no fear. See--\"  He was about to make a second exhibition when a ship's officer seized him, threatening to lock him up if he did not desist.  \"O, certainly, if its against the rules,\" he replied meekly. His hat and coat were lying on a chair by some ladies. He put these on again, and then sat down and began talking to the one nearest him. Chester, who had followed the fellow's capers with some interest, gave a start when he saw that the lady with whom the man was trying to carry on a conversation was the minister's daughter. She was visibly annoyed, and looked about as if for help. Chester thought her eyes fell on him, and without hesitation he determined to assist her. He went up to them, and without appearing to see the girl, reached out his hand to the man, saying:  \"Halloo Jack! Didn't know you were on board till I saw your capers just now. I want to talk to you a moment. Come along and have a drink first.\"  The fellow stared at Chester and was about to deny any acquaintanceship with him, when the insistent manner of the greeting changed his mind. He excused himself to the lady, arose and followed. Chester took his arm as they walked along.  \"Which is your state-room?\" asked Chester.  \"It's 340; but what you want to know for? Aren't we going to have a drink?\"  \"Not just now, my man. You're going to your room, and to bed. You got up too early. Listen,\"--as the sobering man began to resent the interference,--\"there's an officer looking at us. He will do nothing if you will go along quietly with me, but if you make a scene I'll hand you over to him.\"  They found the man's room and he willingly went in and lay down. \"Now,\" said Chester to him, \"remain below until you're sober. And don't bother that young lady again--do you hear. _Don't you do it_.\"  Chester went on deck again, somewhat in wonder at his own conduct. He was not in the habit of interfering in other people's business, and never mixed with drunken affairs. But this surely was different. No man would have refused _that_ appeal for help. Yes; he was sure she had pleaded with her eyes. Perhaps he ought to go back and receive her thanks, but he resisted that impulse. He walked to the extreme rear of the boat and stood looking at the broad white path which the ship was making in the green sea. He stood gazing for some time, then turned, and there sitting on a coil of rope was the girl who had been in his mind. She saw his confusion and smiled at it.  \"I--I came to thank you,\" she said; \"but I did not like to disturb your meditations, so I sat down to rest.\"  \"The sea has used you up quite badly, hasn't it?\"  \"O no; I was dreadfully ill before I came aboard. This trip is to make me well, so papa says.\"  \"I hope so.\" There was a pause, during which Chester found a seat on a bit of ship furniture. This girl's voice was like an echo from far-away Utah and Piney Ridge Cottage. And there was something about the shapely head now framed in wind-blown hair and the face itself that reminded him of someone else. Just how the resemblance came in he could not tell, but there it was. Perhaps, after all, it was just the look in her eyes and the spirit that accompanied her actions and words that moved him.  \"Is that man a friend of yours?\" she asked.  \"You mean that drunken fool? No; I've never met him before.\"  \"That was just a ruse then--that invitation to drink.\"  \"I had to do something, and that came first to me.\"  \"Then you didn't go and drink with him?\"  \"Why no, of course not. I took him to his berth, and told him to stay there.\"  \"Do you think he will?\"  \"Yes; until he sobers up.\"  \"Well, I don't like drunken men.\"  \"Neither do I.\"  \"We're agreed on one thing then, aren't we?\"  Chester laughed with her. Elder Malby was pacing the deck, awaiting the call for breakfast; but Chester did not join him.  \"The man bothered me yesterday,\" she said, \"and again last night. He wished to get acquainted, he claimed.\"  \"You don't know him, then?\"  \"I've never seen him before. Papa has had to remain very quiet, and I haven't been around much. That fellow made me afraid.\"  \"Well, he'll not bother you again. If he does, let me know.\"  \"Thank you very much--\"  The call for breakfast came to them faintly, then grew louder as the beaten gong came up from below to the deck.  \"I must get papa and take him to breakfast. Let me thank you again, and good morning.\"  He might have accompanied her down, but he just stood there watching her. Elder Malby came up, and the two went down together.  The minister and his daughter got into their places more actively that morning. Chester wished heartily that his seat was not opposite. She was at too close range to allow of any careful observation. He could not very well help looking across the table, neither could she, although she had her father to talk to. Chester was really glad when breakfast was over that morning, and they all filed up to the sun-lit deck again.  Had Chester been a smoker, he would no doubt have taken consolation in a pipe with the majority of the men; but as it was, he withdrew as much as possible from others that he might think matters over and get to a proper footing; for truth to tell, he was in danger of falling in love again, and that, he said to himself, would never do. He avoided even Elder Malby that morning; but to do so he"]]]
