The \"Jersey Lily\" (Mrs. Langtry) with her simple headdress and downcast eye, appeared at the Academy of 1879. \"Miss Rachel Gurney\" is a wonderful portrait of a flaming soul imprisoned in a graceful form and graceless dress. Miss Gurney is shown standing, turning slightly to the right with the head again turned over the right shoulder, while the whole effect of energy seems to be concentrated in the flashing eyes. Watts was able to interpret equally well personalities of a very different character, and perhaps the canvas representing Miss Edith Villiers is one of the most successful of his spiritual portraits. Miss Dorothy Dene, whose complexion Watts was one of the first to transfer to canvas, Miss Mary Anderson, and Miss Dorothy Maccallum, were all triumphantly depicted. He will be known, however, as the citizen portrait-painter of the nineteenth century, who preserved for us not merely the form, but the spirit of some of the greatest men of his day. Lord Tennyson sat three times. In 1859 the poet was shown in the prime of life, his hair and beard ruffled, his look determined. In 1864 we had another canvas--\"the moonlight portrait\"; the face is that of Merlin, meditative, thoughtful. As you look at it the features stand out with great clearness, the distance of the laurels behind his head can be estimated almost precisely, while seen through them is the gleam of the moon upon the distant water. The 1890 portrait, in scholastic robes, with grizzled beard, and hair diminished, is Tennyson the mystic, and reminds us of his \"Ancient Sage\"--          \"... for more than once when I     Sat all alone, revolving in myself     The word that is the symbol of myself,     The Mortal limit of the self was loosed     And passed into the Nameless, as a cloud     Melts into heaven.\"  The portrait of John L. Motley, the American Minister to England in 1869, and author of \"The Rise of the Dutch Republic,\" is one of the most successful paintings of handsome men; Watts here depicts perfectly the \"spiritual body\" of strength, purity, and appeal; the eyes are deepest blue, and the hair the richest brown. In this case the artist has, as he was so prone, fallen into symbolism even in portraiture, for we can trace in the background a faint picture of an old-time fighting ship.  Another classic portrait, so different to that by Whistler, is of Thomas Carlyle. The sage of Chelsea sits ruffled and untidy, with his hands resting on the head of a stick, and his features full of power. He seems protesting against the few hours' idleness, and anxious to get back to the strenuous life. The sitter was good enough to say that the portrait was of \"a mad labourer\"--not an unfair criticism of a very good portrait.  _The Biblical Paintings_ are, as before said, in partial fulfilment of the frustrated scheme of \"Cosmos.\" \"Eve Repentant,\" in an attitude so typical of grief, is perhaps the most beautiful; it is one of a trilogy, the others being \"She shall be called Woman,\" and \"Eve Tempted.\" It is singular that in these three canvases the painter avoids the attempt to draw the face of the mother of the race. In the first the face is upturned, covered in shadow; in the second it is hid from view by the leaves of the forbidden tree, while in the third Eve turns her back and hides her weeping face with her arms. This habit of Watts to obscure the face is observed in \"The Shuddering Angel,\" Judgment in \"Time, Death, and Judgment,\" in \"Love and Death,\" \"Sic Transit,\" \"Great Possessions,\" and some others. Often indeed a picture speaks as much of what is not seen as of what is seen.  Incidents from the Gospels are represented by \"The Prodigal,\" where the outcast is seen crouching on the ground, his face fixed on vacuity, almost in the act of coming to himself. \"For he had Great Possessions,\" is, however, the greatest and simplest of all. There the young man who went away sorrowful with bowed head, scarcely knowing what he has lost, is used by Watts as one of his most powerful criticisms of modern life. Although the incident is a definite isolated one, yet the costume, figure, chain of office, and jewelled fingers, clutching and releasing, are of no time or land in particular.  It is not a little remarkable that Watts, who had breathed so deeply the air of Italy, and had almost lived in company of Titian and Raphael, should never have attempted the figure of Christ or His apostles. This was, however, not without reason. His pictures were not only \"for all time,\" but apart from time altogether. His only specific reference to Christianity is his beautiful canvas, \"The Spirit of Christianity,\" in which he rebuked the Churches for their dissensions. A parental figure floats upon a cloud while four children nestle at her feet. The earth below is shrouded in darkness and gloom, despite the steeple tower raising its head above a distant village. The rebuke was immediately stimulated by the refusal of a certain church to employ Watts when the officials found he was not of their faith. In this picture Watts approached nearest to the Italian Madonnas both in form and colour.  _The Mythical Paintings_ are, in the main, earlier than the Biblical series, but even here the same note of teaching is struck, and our human sympathies are drawn out towards the figure depicted. In one, \"Echo\" comes to find her lover transformed into a flower; in another, \"Psyche,\" through disobedience, has lost her love. She gazes regretfully at a feather fallen from Cupid's wing; it is a pink feather, such as might be taken from the plumage of the little Lord of Love who vainly opposes Death in his approach to the beloved one. In \"Psyche,\" Watts has made the pale body expressive of abject loss; there is no physical effort, except in the well-expanded feet, and no other thought but lost love.  The legend of \"Diana and Endymion\" was painted three times--\"good, better, best.\" A shepherd loved the Moon, who in his sleep descends from heaven to embrace him. The canvas of 1903 must be regarded as the final success--the sleeping figure is more asleep, his vision more dreamlike and diaphanous. \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" (painted three times) is perhaps the greatest of his classical pictures. It is one of the few compositions that were considered by its author as \"finished.\" Here again the lover through disobedience loses his love; the falling figure of Eurydice is one of the most beautiful and realistic of all the series of Watts' nudes, and the agony of loss, the energy of struggle, are magnificently drawn in the figure of Orpheus. Looking at the canvas, one recalls the lines of the old Platonic poet-philosopher BoÃ«thius:      \"At length the shadowy king,     His sorrows pitying,     'He hath prevailed!' cried;     'We give him back his bride!     To him she shall belong,     As guerdon of his song.     One sole condition yet     Upon the boon is set;     Let him not turn his eyes     To view his hard-won prize,     Till they securely pass     The gates of Hell.' Alas!     What law can lovers move?     A higher law is love!     For Orpheus--woe is me!--     On his Eurydice--     Day's threshold all but won--     Looked, lost, and was undone!\"  In \"The Minotaur,\" that terrible creature, half man, half bull, crushing with his hideous claw the body of a bird, stands ever waiting to consume by his cruel lust the convoy of beauteous forms coming unseen and unwilling over the sea to him. It is an old myth, but Watts intended it for a modern message. The picture was painted by him in the heat of indignation in three hours.  A small but very important group of paintings, which I call \"The Pessimistic Series,\" begins with \"Life's Illusions,\" painted in 1849. \"It is,\" says Watts, \"an allegorical design typifying the march of human life.\" Fair visions of Beauty, the abstract embodiments of divers forms of Hope and Ambition, hover high in the air above the gulf which stands as the goal of all men's lives. At their feet lie the shattered symbols of human greatness and power, and upon the narrow space of earth that overhangs the deep abyss are figured the brighter forms of illusions that endure through every changing fashion of the world. A knight in armour pricks on his horse in quick pursuit of the rainbow-tinted bubble of glory; on his right are two lovers; on his left an aged student still pores over his work by the last rays of the dying sun; while in the shadow of the group may be seen the form of a little child chasing a butterfly.  This picture has the merit, along with \"Fata Morgana,\" of combining the teaching element with one of the finest representations of woman's form that came from Watts' brush. He was one of those who vigorously defended the painting of the nude. These are some of his words:       \"One of the great missions of art--the greatest indeed--is to      serve the same grand and noble end as poetry by holding in      check that natural and ever-increasing tendency to hypocrisy      which is consequent upon and constantly nurtured by      civilisation. My aim is now, and will be to the end, not so      much to paint pictures which are delightful to the eye, but      pictures which will go to the intelligence and the      imagination, and kindle there what is good and noble, and      which will appeal to the heart. And in doing this I am forced      to paint the nude.\"  \"Fata Morgana\" is a picture of Fortune or Opportunity pursued and lost by an ardent horseman. It was painted twice, first in the Italian style, and again in what must be called Watts' own style--much the finer effort. This picture shows us what, in the artist's view, man in this mortal life desires, pursues, and mostly loses. Fortune has a lock of hair on her forehead by which alone she may be captured, and as she glides mockingly along, she leads her pursuers across rock, stream, dale, desert, and meadow typical of life. The pursuit of the elusive is a favourite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13477"],["title","Watts (1817-1904) (#5)"],["body","with Watts, and is set forth by the picture \"Mischief.\" Here a fine young man is battling for his liberty against an airy spirit representing Folly or Mischief. Humanity bends his neck beneath the enchanter's yoke--a wreath of flowers thrown round his neck--and is led an unwilling captive; as he follows the roses turn to briars about his muscular limbs, and at every step the tangle becomes denser, while one by one the arrows drop from his hand. The thought of \"Life's Illusions\" and \"Fata Morgana\" is again set forth in \"Sic Transit Gloria Mundi,\" where we see the body of a king whose crown, and all that represents to him the glory of the world, is left at death. It is not, however, in Watts' conception essential glory that passes away, but the _Glory of the World_. Upon the dark curtain that hangs behind the shrouded figure are words that represent his final wisdom, \"What I spent, I had; what I saved, I lost; what I gave, I have.\"  [Illustration: PLATE VII.--THE GOOD SAMARITAN  (At the Manchester Art Gallery)       This is an early picture, painted in the year 1852 and      presented to the city of Manchester by the artist in honour of      the prison philanthropist, a native of that city.]  These I call \"Pessimistic paintings,\" because they represent the true discovery ever waiting to be made by man, that the sum total of all that can be gained in man's external life--wealth, fame, strength, and power--that these inevitably pass from him. To know this, to see it clearly, to accept it, is the happiness of the pessimist, who thenceforward fixes his hope and bends his energies to the realisation of other and higher goods. In this he becomes an optimist, for this is the pursuit, as Watts never ceases to teach, in which man can and does attain his goal. Thus our prophet-painter, having seen and known and felt all this, having tested it in the personal and intimate life, brings to a triumphant close his great series, where positive rather than negative teaching is given.  _The Great Realities_.--We have seen in \"Chaos\" primordial matter; we have now from Watts' brush the origin of things on the metaphysical side. In \"The All-pervading,\" there sits the Spirit of the Universe, holding in her lap the globe of the systems, the representation of the last conclusions of philosophy. This mysterious picture is very low in tone, conforming to Watts' rule to make the colouring suit the subject. Here there is nothing hard or defined; the spirit of the universe is merely suggested or hinted at, his great wings enclose all. The elliptical form of this composition is seen again in \"Death Crowning Innocence\" and \"The Dweller in the Innermost,\" and the same expressive indefiniteness and lowness of the colour tones. In the latter effort we have the figure of Conscience, winged, dumb-faced and pensive, seated within a glow of light. On her forehead is the shining star, and in her lap the arrows which pierce through all disguises, and a trumpet that proclaims peace to the world. Here, therefore, is the greatest reality from the psychological side. We have also cosmical paintings representing \"Evolution,\" \"Progress,\" the \"Slumber of the Ages,\" and \"Destiny,\" all of them asking and answering; not indeed finally and dogmatically, but as Watts desired that his pictures should do, stimulating in the observer both the asking and the answering faculty. In \"Faith\" we have a companion to \"Hope.\" Wearied and saddened by persecutions, she washes her blood-stained feet in a running stream, and recognising the influence of Love in all the beauty of Nature, she feels that the sword is not the best argument, and takes it off. The colouring of this picture is rich and forcible, the maroon robe of the figure being one of Watts' favourite attempts.  A satisfying picture of a little child emerging from the latest wave on the shore of humanity's ocean, asks the question, _Whence and Whither_. I reserve for \"Hope\" the final word (see Plate III.). If, as I said, the optimism which is spiritual and ideal springs from the pessimism which is material and actual, so too does Hope grow from the bosom of Despair. This the picture shows. Crouching on the sphere of the world sits the blindfold figure of a woman, bending her ear to catch the music of one only string preserved on her lyre. When everything has failed, there is Hope; and Hope looks, in Watts' teaching, for that which cannot fail, but which is ever triumphant, namely, Love.  _The Love Series_.--According to Watts, Love steers the boat of humanity, who is seen in one of his canvases tossed about and almost shipwrecked. Love does not do this easily, but he does it. Love, as a winged youth, also guides Life, a fragile maiden, up the rocky steep--Life, that would else fail and fall. Violets spring where Love has trod, and as they ascend to the mountain top the air becomes more golden. This picture, \"Love and Life\" (see Plate V.) was painted four times. \"Love and Death,\" painted three times, represents the irresistible figure of Death tenderly, yet firmly, entering a door where we know lies the beloved one. This is an eternal theme, suggested, I believe, by a temporal incident--the death of a young member of the Prinsep family. Love vainly pushes back the imperious figure; the protecting flowers are trodden down and the dove mourns; and with it all we feel that though Love fears Death, yet Death respects Love. Just as \"Love and Death\" are companion pictures and tell complementary truths, so \"Time, Death, and Judgment\" is related to \"Love Triumphant\" (see Plate VI.). In the one we see Time, represented by a mighty youth half clad in a red cloak, striding along with great vigour. His companion, whom he holds by the hand, is Death, the sad mother with weary, downcast eye and outspread lap ready to receive her load; but with neither of them is the final word, for Judgment, poised in the clouds, wields his fiery sword of eternal law and holds the balance before his hidden face. In \"Love Triumphant\" Love takes the place of, and transcends Judgment. Time and Death having travelled together through the ages, are in the end overthrown, and Love alone rises on immortal wings. Thus the stoical painter reaches his greatest height--tells his best truth.  _The Death Series_.--As may be expected, Death has no terrors for the fundamental Watts. Never once does Death look with hollow eyes and sunken cheeks, or grasp with bony fingers at the living. In \"Death Crowning Innocence,\" as a mother she puts her halo on the infant Innocence, whom she claims. Death holds a Court to which all must go--priest, soldier, king, cripple, beautiful woman, and young child. The lion must die, the civilisation be overthrown, wealth, fame, and pride must be let go--so Watts shows in his \"Court of Death\"; all come to the end of the book marked _Finis_. Death is calm and majestic, with angel wings, and overhead are the figures of Silence and Mystery, guarding, but partially revealing what is beyond the veil--sunrise and the star of hope; while even in the lap of Death nestles a new-born babe--the soul passing into new realms through the gates of Death.  Again, Death is _the Messenger_ who comes, not to terrify, but as an ambassador to call the soul away from this alien land, quietly touching the waiting soul with the finger-tips. In the beautiful \"Paolo and Francesca\" the lovers are seen as Dante told of them; wafted along by the infernal wind; of them he spoke:            \"... Bard! Willingly     I would address these two together coming,     Which seem so light before the wind.\"  Francesca's reply to Dante is of Love and Death:      \"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,     Entangled him by that fair form...;     Love, that denial takes from none beloved,     Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,     That as thou seest, he yet deserts me not.     Love brought us to one death.\"  Watts has admirably caught the sweetness and sorrow of this situation in his beautiful picture, which, again, is one of the very few he considered finally \"finished.\" It is almost a monochrome of blues and greys.  In \"Time and Oblivion,\" one of the earliest of the symbolical paintings, Time is again the stalwart man of imperishable youth, while Oblivion, another form of Death, spreads her mantle of darkness over all, claiming all.  _Landscapes_.--Although Watts will ever be remembered for his allegorical, biblical, and portrait painting, yet he was by no means deficient in landscape art. Indeed, he carried into that branch of work his peculiar personality. Not only do his landscapes depict beautiful scenery in a fitting manner, joining atmosphere, sunshine, and colour, but they convey in an extraordinary degree the mood of Nature and of Man. \"The Sphinx by Night\" has an air of mystery about it that immediately impresses the spectator, and tells him something that cannot be communicated by words. The Italian and the Asiatic canvases by Watts, \"Florence,\" \"Fiesole,\" \"Correna,\" \"Cos,\" and \"Asia Minor,\" all induce the feeling of repose and happiness, and the message that Nature sends to her devotees comes sweetly and calmly in \"The Rainbow,\" where we look over an extensive valley from high ground, while heavy clouds and the rainbow adorn the upper air. In \"The Cumulus\" we \"see skyward great cloud masses rolling, silently swelling and mixing.\" They recall perhaps the memories of the child, to whom the mountains of the air are a perpetual wonder. When in Savoy in 1888, Watts painted the Alps, again with a cloudy sky and a rocky foreground. In this the quietude of the scene penetrates the beholder. English landscape, to which all true hearts return, was successfully depicted, both in form and spirit, by Watts' \"Landscape with Hayricks\" (like the Brighton Downs), a quiet view from the summit of a hillside, on which are seen some hayricks. But perhaps the highest of them all is that very peaceful idyll named \"All the air a solemn stillness holds.\" It was a"]]]
