For instance, Deborah and Richard Green were each put down for five hundred dollars.\"  \"So they suffer as well as I?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Have you any idea, Mr. Ferret, of the value of the estate which falls into Mr. Manning's hands?\"  \"I have some idea, because I have talked with your mother on the subject. This estate is worth fifty thousand dollars at least, and there are fully fifty thousand dollars in money and bonds. The legacies do not altogether exceed one thousand dollars, and therefore it may be said that your stepfather has fallen heir to one hundred thousand dollars.\"  \"I suppose there is nothing I can do, Mr. Ferret?\"  \"Not unless you can show that this will which I have read is not a genuine document. That would be difficult.\"  \"Did you notice my mother's signature?\"  \"Yes. I am not an expert, but I cannot detect any difference greater than maybe existed between two signatures of the same person.\"  \"Then I suppose there is nothing to be done at present. I expect to have a hard time with Mr. Manning, Mr. Ferret.\"  \"How has he treated you in the past, Frank?\" asked the lawyer.  \"I have had nothing to complain of; but then he was not master of the estate. Now it is difficult, and I think his treatment of me will be different.\"  \"You may be right. You remember what I said, Frank?\"  \"That I should regard you as a friend? I won't forget it, Mr. Ferret.\"  One by one the company left the house, and Frank was alone.  Left alone and unsustained by sympathy, he felt more bitterly than before the totally unexpected change in his circumstances.  Up to the last hour he had regarded himself as the heir of the estate. Now he was only a dependent of a man whom he heartily disliked.  Could it be that this misfortune had come to him through the agency of his mother?  \"I will not believe it!\" he exclaimed, energetically.     CHAPTER VI  AN UNSATISFACTORY INTERVIEW   Frank came to a decision the next morning. A long deferred interview with his stepfather was necessary. Having made up his mind, he entered the room in which his stepfather sat. His air was manly and his bearing that of a boy who respects himself, but there was none of the swagger which some boys think it necessary to exhibit when they wish to assert their rights.  Mr. Manning, in a flowered dressing gown, sat at a table, with a sheet of paper before him and a lead pencil in his hand. Short as had been the interval since his accession to the property, he was figuring up the probable income he would derive from the estate.  He looked up as Frank entered the room, and surveyed him with cold and sarcastic eyes. His soft tones were dropped.  \"Mr. Manning,\" said Frank, \"I wish to talk to you.\"  \"You may, of course,\" his stepfather replied mildly. \"It is about the will,\" Frank advised him.  \"So you would complain of your poor mother, would you?\" said his stepfather, in a tone of virtuous indignation.  \"I cannot believe that my mother made that will.\"  Mr. Manning colored. He scented danger. Should Frank drop such hints elsewhere, he might make trouble, and lead to a legal investigation, which Mr. Manning had every reason to dread.  \"This is very foolish,\" he said, more mildly. \"No doubt you are disappointed, but probably your mother has provided wisely. You will want for nothing, and you will be prepared for the responsibilities of manhood under my auspices.\"  Mr. Manning's face assumed a look of self-complacence as he uttered these last words.  \"I have no blame to cast upon my dear mother,\" said Frank. \"If she made that will, she acted under a great mistake.\"  \"What mistake, sir?\"  \"She failed to understand you.\"  \"Do you mean to imply that I shall be false to my trust?\"  \"Not at present, sir. I don't wish to judge of you too hastily.\"  As the boy turned to go, he said. \"I have nothing further to say, sir.\"  \"But I have,\" said Mr. Manning.  \"Very well, sir.\"  \"I demand that you treat my son Mark with suitable respect, and forbear to infringe upon his rights.\"  Frank looked up, and answered, with spirit: \"I shall treat Mark as well as he treats me, sir. Is that satisfactory?\"  \"I apprehend,\" said Mr. Manning, \"that you may make some mistakes upon that point.\"  \"I will try not to do so, sir.\"  Frank left the room, and this time was not called back.  His stepfather looked after him, but his face expressed neither friendliness nor satisfaction.  \"That boy requires taming,\" he said to himself. \"He is going to make trouble. I must consider what I will do with him.\"  As Mr. Manning reviewed Frank's words, there was one thing which especially disturbed him--the doubt expressed by his stepson as to his mother's having actually made the will.  He saw that it would not do for him to go too far in his persecution of Frank as it might drive the latter to consult a lawyer in regard to the validity of the will by which he had been disinherited.  Frank rather gloomily made his way to the stable. As he reached it, Richard Green came out.  \"I'm sorry for you, Mr. Frank. But your mother was a saint. She was too good to suspect the badness of others, Mr. Frank. She thought old Manning was really all that he pretended to be, and that he would be as kind to you as she was herself. When she was alive, he was always as soft as--as silk.\"  \"His manner has changed now,\" said Frank, gravely. \"Excuse me, Richard, for finding fault with you, but don't call him old Manning.\"  \"Why not, Mr. Frank?\"  \"I have no liking for Mr. Manning--in fact, I dislike him--but he was the husband of my mother, and I prefer to speak of him respectfully.\"  \"I dare say you are right, Mr. Frank, but, all the same, he don't deserve it. Is Mr. Mark to ride Ajax then?\"  \"If he asks for it, you are to saddle Ajax for him. I don't want you to get into any trouble with Mr. Manning on my account.\"  \"I don't care for that, Mr. Frank. I can get another place, and I don't much care to serve Mr. Manning.\"  \"I would rather you would stay, if you can, Richard. I don't want to see a new face in the stable.\"  \"I don't think he means to keep me long, Mr. Frank. Deborah and I will have to go, I expect, and he'll get some servants of his own here.\"  \"Has he hinted anything of this, Richard?\" asked Frank, quickly.  \"No; but he will soon, you may depend on it. I won't lose sight of you, though. I've known you since you were four years old, and I won't desert you, if I can do any good--nor Deborah, either.\"  \"I have two friends, then, at any rate,\" said Frank to himself. \"That is something.\"     CHAPTER VII  A SCHOOL FRIEND   Early Monday morning it had been the custom for Frank and Mark to take the train for Bridgeville, to enter upon a new week at the academy.  Frank felt that it would be better for him to go back without any further vacation, as occupation would serve to keep him from brooding over his loss.  \"Are you ready, Mark?\" he asked, as he rose from the breakfast table.  \"Ready for what?\"  \"To go back to school, of course.\"  \"I am not going back this morning,\" answered Mark.  \"Why not?\" asked Frank, in some surprise.  \"I am going to stay at home to help father,\" said Mark, with a glance at Mr. Manning.  \"If I can be of any service to you, sir, I will stay, too,\" said Frank, politely.  \"Thank you, but Mark will do all I require,\" replied his stepfather.  \"Very well, sir.\"  Frank appeared at the academy with a grave face and subdued manner, suggestive of the great loss he had sustained. From his schoolfellows, with whom he was a favorite, he received many words of sympathy--from none more earnest or sincere than from Herbert Grant.  \"I know how you feel, Frank,\" he said, pressing the hand of his friend. \"If I could comfort you I would, but I don't know how to do it.\"  \"I find comfort in your sympathy,\" said Frank. \"I look upon you as my warmest friend here.\"  \"I am glad of that, Frank.\"  To Herbert alone Frank spoke of his mother and her devoted affection; but even to him he did not like to mention the will and his disinheritance. He did not so much lament the loss of the property as that he had lost it by the direction of his mother, or, rather, because it would generally be supposed so.  For himself, he doubted the genuineness of the will, but he felt that it was useless to speak of it, as he was unprepared with any proofs.  So it happened that when, on Wednesday afternoon Mark Manning made his appearance, Frank's change of position, as respected the property, was neither known nor suspected by his schoolfellows. It was soon known, however, and of course, through Mark.  The boys immediately noticed a change in Mark. He assumed an air of consequence, and actually strutted across the campus. Instead of being polite and attentive to Frank, he passed him with a careless nod, such as a superior might bestow on an inferior.  \"What has come over Mark?\" asked Herbert of Frank, as the two were walking together from recitation.  \"How do you mean?\"  \"He holds his head higher than he used to do. He looks as if he had been elected to some important office.\"  \"You will soon learn, Herbert,\" said Frank. \"Make a pretext to join him, and let the news come from him.\"  Herbert looked puzzled.  \"Do you wish me to do this?\" he asked.  \"Yes, I have a reason for it.\"  \"Very well. I am always ready to oblige you, Frank, but I hope Mark won't think I have suddenly formed a liking for his society.\"  \"If he does, you can soon undeceive him.\"  \"That is true.\"  Herbert left the side of his friend, and sauntered toward Mark.  As Herbert was known as Frank's especial friend, Mark was at first surprised, but quickly decided that his improved position had been communicated by Frank, and that Herbert was influenced by it. That is to say, he judged Herbert to be as mean and mercenary as himself.  Herbert's position was too humble to entitle him to much notice from Mark, but the latter was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13803"],["title","Making His Way; Or, Frank Courtney's Struggle Upward (#4)"],["body","with the prospect of detaching from Frank his favorite friend.  \"You came back rather late, Mark,\" said Herbert.  \"Yes,\" answered Mark, with an air of importance. \"I remained at home a short time, to help my father in his accounts. You know the property is large, and there is a good deal to do.\"  \"I should think that was Frank's place, to help about the accounts.\"  \"Why?\"  \"The property is his, of course!\"  \"Did he tell you that?\" asked Mark, sharply.  \"He has not said a word about the property.\"  \"No, I suppose not,\" said Mark, with a sneering laugh.  \"Has anything happened? Didn't his mother leave as much as was expected?\" went on Herbert, quite in the dark.  \"Yes, she left a large estate, but she didn't leave it to him.\"  \"To whom, then?\"  \"To my father!\" replied Mark, with conscious pride. \"Frank has nothing. He is entirely dependent upon father.\"  \"Did his mother leave him nothing, then?\" asked Herbert, in pained surprise.  \"Nothing at all,\" assured Mark, complacently.  \"That is very strange and unjust.\"  \"I don't look upon it in that light,\" said Mark, nettled. \"My father knows what is best for him. He will provide for him just as his mother did before.\"  \"But when Frank is of age, doesn't he come into possession of the estate then?\"  \"No, of course not. Didn't I tell you it belongs to father? Frank is a poor boy--as poor as you,\" said Mark, in a tone of evident satisfaction.  \"Or you,\" added Herbert, pointedly.  \"You are mistaken,\" said Mark, quickly. \"I am father's heir.\"  \"Suppose your father dies--how will the property go?\"  \"I suppose something will be left to Frank, unless my father leaves me the property, with directions to provide for him.\"  \"Would you think that right and just?\" demanded Herbert, indignantly.  \"Of course I would. My stepmother knew what she was about when she made her will. I see you are surprised. You won't be quite to thick with Frank, now, I expect.\"  \"Why shouldn't I be?\"  \"Because he is just as poor as you are. He never can help you.\"  \"Mark Manning, I believe you are about the meanest boy I ever encountered, and you judge me by yourself!\"  \"Do you mean to insult me? Mind what you say!\" blustered Mark, unpleasantly surprised at this outburst from a boy whom he expected would now transfer his allegiance from Frank to himself.  \"I mean that you and your father have robbed Frank of his inheritance, and glory in it, and you think that I am mean enough to desert him because he is no longer rich. It makes no difference to me whether he is rich or poor. I think I like him all the better because he has been so badly treated. As for you, I despise you, and shall continue to, even if you get the whole of Frank's money.\"  \"You forget that you are talking to a gentleman, you low-born mechanic!\" said Mark, angrily.  \"You a gentleman!\" replied Herbert, contemptuously. \"Then I never want to be one!\"  He walked away, leaving Mark very much incensed.  \"He is a fool!\" muttered Mark. \"When I am a rich man, he may repent having insulted me.\"  Herbert went back to Frank.  \"Did he tell you?\" asked Frank, quietly.  \"Yes; and he actually appeared to think I would be ready to desert you because you were poor, and follow him about.\"  \"I am not afraid of that, Herbert.\"  \"I don't think Mark will have that idea any more. I gave him a piece of my mind, and left him very angry. But what does it all mean, Frank?\"  \"I know no more than you do, Herbert. I cannot understand it.\"  \"What could have induced your mother to make such a will?\"  \"I cannot believe my poor mother ever made such a will; but, if she did, I am very sure that she was over-persuaded by my stepfather, who is one of the most plausible of men.\"  \"What shall you do about it?\"  \"What can I do? I am only a boy. I have no proof, you know.\"  \"How are you likely to be treated?\"  \"I have had a little foretaste of that.\"  \"It looks very bad for you, Frank,\" admitted Herbert, in a tone of sympathy.  \"I don't so much care for the loss of the property, Herbert,\" said Frank, \"but I am afraid I shall have sorts of annoyances to endure from Mark and his father. But I won't anticipate trouble. I will do my duty, and trust that things will turn out better than I fear.\"  The next afternoon a letter was placed in Frank's hands. It was in a brown envelope, and directed in a cramped and evidently unpracticed hand, with which Frank was not familiar.  On opening it, a glance at the signature showed that it was from Richard Green, the coachman. It commenced:  \"Dear Mr. Frank: This comes hoping you are well. I have no good news to tell. Mr. Manning has sold your horse, Ajax, and he is to be taken away to-night. I thought you ought to know it, and that is why I take my pen in hand to write.\"  There was more, but this is all that was important.  Frank's face flushed with anger. He immediately went in search of Mark, who, he felt assured, knew of the sale.  It may be said here that Ajax was one of Frank's dearest trophies, a gift from his mother.     CHAPTER VIII  A NEW PLAN   Mark was in his room, where Frank found him trying on a new necktie. Though decidedly plain, Mark fancied himself very good-looking, and spent no little time on personal adornment. In particular, he had a weakness for new neckties, in which he indulged himself freely.  When the boys came to the academy, the principal proposed that they should room together; but both objected, and Mark had a room to himself--no one caring to room with him.  \"Take a seat, Frank,\" said Mark, condescendingly. \"Is there anything I can do for you?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Frank. \"I hear your father has sold Ajax, or is intending to do so. Will you tell me if it is true?\"  \"I believe it is,\" answered Mark, indifferently.  \"And what right has he to sell my horse?\" demanded Frank, indignantly.  \"You'd better ask him,\" said Mark, with provoking coolness.  \"It is an outrage,\" said Frank, indignantly.  \"As to that,\" said his stepbrother, \"you can't expect father to be at the expense of feeding your horse.\"  \"With my money?\"  \"The money is legally his,\" replied Mark.  \"Do you know to whom your father has sold Ajax?\"  \"To Col. Vincent, I believe.\"  \"I am glad, at any rate, that he will have a good master.\"  Frank felt that there would be no advantage in prolonging the interview, or carrying on further a war of words.  He sought out his friend Herbert, and communicated to him this last infraction of his rights.  \"It is too bad, Frank!\" said his sympathizing friend.  \"Yes, it is,\" said Frank, gravely; \"but I fear it is only the beginning of annoyances. I don't believe I can ever live in any place with Mr. Manning or Mark.\"  \"Will it be necessary?\"  \"I suppose so. I have no money, as you know. All has gone to him. Herbert, I tell you frankly, I envy you and your position.\"  \"Though my father is a poor man?\"  \"Yes; for, at any rate, you have a peaceful home, and a father and mother who love you. I have a stepfather, who will do all he can to make me miserable.\"  \"Would you be willing to work for your own support, Frank?\"  \"Yes; far rather than remain a dependent on Mr. Manning.\"  \"Suppose you should run away,\" suggested Herbert.  Frank shook his head.  \"I wouldn't do that except in case of extreme necessity. I know that if my mother knows what goes on here, it would grieve her for me to take such a step.\"  \"Suppose your stepfather should consent to your leaving home?\"  \"Then I would do so gladly. I am willing to work and I think I could make a living in some way.\"  \"Why not ask him?\"  Frank's face brightened.  \"Thank you for the hint, Herbert,\" he said. \"I will think of it, and I may act upon it.\"  Frank was naturally self-reliant and energetic. He was not disposed to shrink from the duties of life, but was ready to go forth to meet them. The idea which Herbert had suggested commended itself to him the more he thought of it.  In spite, therefore, of the news which he had received about Ajax, he resumed his cheerfulness, considerably to the surprise of Mark, whose natural suspicion led him to conjecture that Frank had some plan in view to circumvent his father.  \"If he has, he'd better give it up,\" reflected Mark. \"The old man's as sly as a fox. A raw boy like Frank can't get the better of him.\"  At the close of the week, both the boys went home. They were on board the same train and the same car, but did not sit together. When they reached the house, Mr. Manning was not at home.  Frank went out to the stable at once to see Richard Green, the coachman.  He found him, indeed, but he also found another man, a stranger, who appeared to be employed in the stable.  \"Who is this, Richard?\" asked Frank.  \"My successor,\" answered the coachman.  \"Are you going to leave?\" asked Frank, hastily.  \"Come out with me, Mr. Frank, and I will tell you,\" said Richard. \"I've had notice to leave,\" he said, \"and so has Deborah. It came last evening. Mr. Manning got a letter from Bridgeville--I know that, because I brought it home from the post office--which appeared to make him angry. He called Deborah and me and told us that he should not need our services any longer.\"  \"Did he give you any reason?\"  \"Yes; he said that he could have our places filled for a good deal less money, and he had no doubt we could do as well elsewhere.\"  \"He has filled your place pretty soon.\"  \"Yes. This man came this morning. I think Mr. Manning had sent for him already. I told you the other day we should soon be discharged.\"  \"I know it; but I can tell you what has hastened it.\"  \"What, then?\"  \"Mark wrote his father that I had learned about the sale of Ajax, and that the information came from you or Deborah.\"  \"I think it likely, Mr. Frank, for the old gentleman seemed mighty cool. I hope you won't take it too much to heart that Ajax is sold.\"  \"I am not sure but I am glad of it,\" said Frank.  The coachman looked at him in surprise.  \"I thought you would be very angry,\" he said.  \"So I was at first, but he has been sold to a man who will treat him well, and I shall be glad"]]]
