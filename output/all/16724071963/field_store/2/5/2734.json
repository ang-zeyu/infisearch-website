The term \"sexual instinct\" may be said to cover the whole of the neuropsychic phenomena of reproduction which man shares with the lower animals. It is true that much discussion has taken place concerning the proper use of the term \"instinct,\" and some definitions of instinctive action would appear to exclude the essential mechanism of the process whereby sexual reproduction is assured. Such definitions scarcely seem legitimate, and are certainly unfortunate. Herbert Spencer's definition of instinct as \"compound reflex action\" is sufficiently clear and definite for ordinary use.      A fairly satisfactory definition of instinct is that supplied by     Dr. and Mrs. Peckham in the course of their study _On the     Instincts and Habits of Solitary Wasps_. \"Under the term     'instinct,'\" they say, \"we place all complex acts which are     performed previous to experience and in a similar manner by all     members of the same sex and race, leaving out as non-essential,     at this time, the question of whether they are or are not     accompanied by consciousness.\" This definition is quoted with     approval by Lloyd Morgan, who modifies and further elaborates it     (_Animal Behavior_, 1900, p. 21). \"The distinction between     instinctive and reflex behavior,\" he remarks, \"turns in large     degree on their relative complexity,\" and instinctive behavior,     he concludes, may be said to comprise \"those complex groups of     co-ordinated acts which are, on their first occurrence,     independent of experience; which tend to the well-being of the     individual and the preservation of the race; which are due to the     co-operation of external and internal stimuli; which are     similarly performed by all the members of the same more or less     restricted group of animals; but which are subject to variation,     and to subsequent modification under the guidance of experience.\"     Such a definition clearly justifies us in speaking of a \"sexual     instinct.\" It may be added that the various questions involved in     the definition of the sexual instinct have been fully discussed     by Moll in the early sections of his _Untersuchungen über die     Libido Sexualis_.      Of recent years there has been a tendency to avoid the use of the     term \"instinct,\" or, at all events, to refrain from attaching any     serious scientific sense to it. Loeb's influence has especially     given force to this tendency. Thus, while Piéron, in an     interesting discussion of the question (\"Les Problèmes Actuels de     l'Instinct,\" _Revue Philosophique_, Oct., 1908), thinks it would     still be convenient to retain the term, giving it a philosophical     meaning, Georges Bohn, who devotes a chapter to the notion of     instinct (_La Naissance de l'Intelligence_, 1909), is strongly in     favor of eliminating the word, as being merely a legacy of     medieval theologians and metaphysicians, serving to conceal our     ignorance or our lack of exact analysis.  It may be said that the whole of the task undertaken in these _Studies_ is really an attempt to analyze what is commonly called the sexual instinct. In order to grasp it we have to break it up into its component parts. Lloyd Morgan has pointed out that the components of an instinct may be regarded as four: first, the internal messages giving rise to the impulse; secondly, the external stimuli which co-operate with the impulse to affect the nervous centers; thirdly, the active response due to the co-ordinate outgoing discharges; and, fourthly, the message from the organs concerned in the behavior by which the central nervous system is further affected.[1]  In dealing with the sexual instinct the first two factors are those which we have most fully to discuss. With the external stimuli we shall be concerned in a future volume (IV). We may here confine ourselves mainly to the first factor: the nature of the internal messages which prompt the sexual act. We may, in other words, attempt to analyze the _sexual impulse_.  The first definition of the sexual impulse we meet with is that which regards it as an impulse of evacuation. The psychological element is thus reduced to a minimum. It is true that, especially in early life, the emotions caused by forced repression of the excretions are frequently massive or acute in the highest degree, and the joy of relief correspondingly great. But in adult life, on most occasions, these desires can be largely pushed into the background of consciousness, partly by training, partly by the fact that involuntary muscular activity is less imperative in adult life; so that the ideal element in connection with the ordinary excretions is almost a negligible quantity. The evacuation theory of the sexual instinct is, however, that which has most popular vogue, and the cynic delights to express it in crude language. It is the view that appeals to the criminal mind, and in the slang of French criminals the brothel is _le cloaque_. It was also the view implicitly accepted by medieval ascetic writers, who regarded woman as \"a temple built over a sewer,\" and from a very different standpoint it was concisely set forth by Montaigne, who has doubtless contributed greatly to support this view of the matter: \"I find,\" he said, \"that Venus, after all, is nothing more than the pleasure of discharging our vessels, just as nature renders pleasurable the discharges from other parts.\"[2] Luther, again, always compared the sexual to the excretory impulse, and said that marriage was just as necessary as the emission of urine. Sir Thomas More, also, in the second book of _Utopia_, referring to the pleasure of evacuation, speaks of that felt \"when we do our natural easement, or when we be doing the act of generation.\" This view would, however, scarcely deserve serious consideration if various distinguished investigators, among whom Féré may be specially mentioned, had not accepted it as the best and most accurate definition of the sexual impulse. \"The genesic need may be considered,\" writes Féré, \"as a need of evacuation; the choice is determined by the excitations which render the evacuation more agreeable.\"[3] Certain facts observed in the lower animals tend "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#2)"],["body","support this view; it is, therefore, necessary, in the first place, to set forth the main results of observation on this matter. Spallanzani had shown how the male frog during coitus will undergo the most horrible mutilations, even decapitation, and yet resolutely continue the act of intercourse, which lasts from four to ten days, sitting on the back of the female and firmly clasping her with his forelegs. Goltz confirmed Spallanzani's observations and threw new light on the mechanism of the sexual instinct and the sexual act in the frog. By removing various parts of the female frog Goltz found that every part of the female was attractive to the male at pairing time, and that he was not imposed on when parts of a male were substituted. By removing various of the sense-organs of the male Goltz[4] further found that it was not by any special organ, but by the whole of his sensitive system, that this activity was set in action. If, however, the skin of the arms and of the breast between was removed, no embrace took place; so that the sexual sensations seemed to be exerted through this apparatus. When the testicles were removed the embrace still took place. It could scarcely be said that these observations demonstrated, or in any way indicated, that the sexual impulse is dependent on the need of evacuation. Professor Tarchanoff, of St. Petersburg, however, made an experiment which seemed to be crucial. He took several hundred frogs (_Rana temporaria_), nearly all in the act of coitus, and in the first place repeated Goltz's experiments. He removed the heart; but this led to no direct or indirect stoppage of coitus, nor did removal of the lungs, parts of the liver, the spleen, the intestines, the stomach, or the kidneys. In the same way even careful removal of both testicles had no result. But on removing the seminal receptacles coitus was immediately or very shortly stopped, and not renewed. Thus, Tarchanoff concluded that in frogs, and possibly therefore in mammals, the seminal receptacles are the starting-point of the centripetal impulse which by reflex action sets in motion the complicated apparatus of sexual activity.[5] A few years later the question was again taken up by Steinach, of Prague. Granting that Tarchanoff's experiments are reliable as regards the frog, Steinach points out that we may still ask whether in mammals the integrity of the seminal receptacles is bound up with the preservation of sexual excitability. This cannot be taken for granted, nor can we assume that the seminal receptacles of the frog are homologous with the seminal vesicles of mammals. In order to test the question, Steinach chose the white rat, as possessing large seminal vesicles and a very developed sexual impulse. He found that removal of the seminal sacs led to no decrease in the intensity of the sexual impulse; the sexual act was still repeated with the same frequency and the same vigor. But these receptacles, Steinach proceeded to argue, do not really contain semen, but a special secretion of their own; they are anatomically quite unlike the seminal receptacles of the frog; so that no doubt is thus thrown on Tarchanoff's observations. Steinach remarked, however, that one's faith is rather shaken by the fact that in the _Esculenta_, which in sexual life closely resembles _Rana temporaria_, there are no seminal receptacles. He therefore repeated Tarchanoff's experiments, and found that the seminal receptacles were empty before coitus, only becoming gradually filled during coitus; it could not, therefore, be argued that the sexual impulse started from the receptacles. He then extirpated the seminal receptacles, avoiding hemorrhage as far as possible, and found that, in the majority of cases so operated on, coitus still continued for from five to seven days, and in the minority for a longer time. He therefore concluded, with Goltz, that it is from the swollen testicles, not from the seminal receptacles, that the impulse first starts. Goltz himself pointed out that the fact that the removal of the testicles did not stop coitus by no means proves that it did not begin it, for, when the central nervous mechanism is once set in action, it can continue even when the exciting stimulus is removed. By extirpating the testicles some months before the sexual season he found that no coitus occurred. At the same time, even in these frogs, a certain degree of sexual inclination and a certain excitability of the embracing center still persisted, disappearing when the sexual epoch was over.  According to most recent writers, the seminal vesicles of mammals are receptacles for their own albuminous secretion, the function of which is unknown. Steinach could find no spermatozoa in these \"seminal\" sacs, and therefore he proposed to use Owen's name of _glandulæ vesiculares_. After extirpation of these vesicular glands in the white rat typical coitus occurred. But the capacity for _procreation_ was diminished, and extirpation of both _glandulæ vesiculares_ and _glandulæ prostaticæ_ led to disappearance of the capacity for procreation. Steinach came to the conclusion that this is because the secretions of these glands impart increased vitality to the spermatozoa, and he points out that great fertility and high development of the accessory sexual glands go together.  Steinach found that, when sexually mature white rats were castrated, though at first they remained as potent as ever, their potency gradually declined; sexual excitement, however, and sexual inclination always persisted. He then proceeded to castrate rats before puberty and discovered the highly significant fact that in these also a quite considerable degree of sexual inclination appeared. They followed, sniffed, and licked the females like ordinary males; and that this was not a mere indication of curiosity was shown by the fact that they made attempts at coitus which only differed from those of normal males by the failure of erection and ejaculation, though, occasionally, there was imperfect erection. This lasted for a year, and then their sexual inclinations began to decline, and they showed signs of premature age. These manifestations of sexual sense Steinach compares to those noted in the human species during childhood.[6]  The genesic tendencies are thus, to a certain degree, independent of the generative glands, although the development of these glands serves to increase the genesic ability and to furnish the impulsion necessary to assure procreation, as well as to insure the development of the secondary sexual characters, probably by the influence of secretions elaborated and thrown into the system from the primary sexual glands.[7]      Halban (\"Die Entstehung der Geschlechtscharaktere,\" _Archiv für     Gynäkologie_, 1903, pp. 205-308) argues that the primary sex     glands do not necessarily produce the secondary sex characters,     nor inhibit the development of those characteristic of the     opposite sex. It is indeed the rule, but it is not the inevitable     result. Sexual differences exist from the first. Nussbaum made     experiments on frogs (_Rana fusca_), which go through a yearly     cycle of secondary sexual changes at the period of heat. These     changes cease on castration, but, if the testes of other frogs     are introduced beneath the skin of the castrated frogs, Nussbaum     found that they acted as if the frog had not been castrated. It     is the secretion of the testes which produces the secondary     sexual changes. But Nussbaum found that the testicular secretion     does not work if the nerves of the secondary sexual region are     cut, and that the secretion has no direct action on the organism.     Pflüger, discussing these experiments (_Archiv für die Gesammte     Physiologie_, 1907, vol. cxvi, parts 5 and 6), disputes this     conclusion, and argues that the secretion is not dependent on the     action of the nervous system, and that therefore the secondary     sexual characters are independent of the nervous system.      Steinach has also in later experiments (\"Geschlechtstrieb und     echt Sekundäre Geschlechtsmerkmale als Folge der     innerskretorischen Funktion der Keimdrusen,\" _Zentralblatt für     Physiologie_, Bd. xxiv, Nu. 13, 1910) argued against any local     nervous influence. He found in _Rana fusca_ and _esculenta_ that     after castration in autumn the impulse to grasp the female     persisted in some degrees and then disappeared, reappearing in a     slight degree, however, every winter at the normal period of     sexual activity. But when the testicular substance of actively     sexual frogs was injected into the castrated frogs it exerted an     elective action on the sexual reflex, sometimes in a few hours,     but the action is, Steinach concludes, first central. The     testicular secretion of frogs that were not sexually active had     no stimulating action, but if the frogs were sexually active the     injection of their central nervous substance was as effective as     their testicular substance. In either case, Steinach concludes,     there is the removal of an inhibition which is in operation at     sexually quiescent periods.      Speaking generally, Steinach considers that there is a process of     \"erotisation\" (Erotisieurung) of the nervous center under the     influence of the internal testicular secretions, and that this     persists even when the primary physical stimulus has been     removed.  The experience of veterinary surgeons also shows that the sexual impulse tends to persist in animals after castration. Thus the ox and the gelding make frequent efforts to copulate with females in heat. In some cases, at all events in the case of the horse, castrated animals remain potent, and are even abnormally ardent, although impregnation cannot, of course, result.[8]  The results obtained by scientific experiment and veterinary experience on the lower animals are confirmed by observation of various groups of"]]]
