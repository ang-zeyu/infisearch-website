With true poetic exaggeration he extolled Caroline's virtues, and then, so that there should be no excuse for misunderstanding, said in plain terms that he had desired a post at Court, and made it perfectly clear that he was still prepared to accept such employment, if so be as it was coupled with suitable remuneration:--    Since all my schemes were baulk'd, my last resort,   I left the Muses to frequent the Court;   Pensive each night, from room to room I walk'd,   To one I bow'd, and with another talk'd;   Inquir'd what news, or such a lady's name,   And did the next day, and the next, the same.   Places I found, were daily giv'n away,   And yet no friendly _Gazette_ mention'd Gay.  Gay's protestations of delight at the accession to the throne of the House of Hanover would probably have been regarded as more sincere if, unfortunately, he had not a few months before dedicated \"The Shepherd's Week\" to Bolingbroke. His very outspoken hint in the \"Letter to a Lady\" was ignored; but Caroline, who liked eulogy as much as anyone, received him kindly; and when in February, 1715, he produced \"The What D'ye Call It\" at Drury Lane Theatre, she and her consort attended the first performance. But still, no place was found for him at Court. \"Tell me,\" Swift asked him so much later as 1723, \"are you not under original sin by the dedication of your Eclogue to Lord Bolingbroke?\"   [Footnote 1: _The Guardian_, No. 32; April 17th, 1713.]  [Footnote 2: Dr. Johnson in his \"Lives of the Poets\" attributes the authorship to Steele (_Works_, ed.

In the preface Gay wrote: \"I have not called it a tragedy, comedy, pastoral, or farce, but left the name entirely undetermined in the doubtful appellation of 'The What D'ye Call It' ... but I added to it 'A Tragi-Comi-Pastoral Farce,' as it contained all these several kinds of drama.\" Pope saw the play and wrote about it to Congreve, March 19th, 1715: \"The farce of 'The What D'ye Call It' has occasioned many different speculations in the town, some looking upon it as a mere jest upon the tragic poets, others as a satire upon the late war. Mr. Cromwell, hearing none of the words, and seeing the action to be tragical, was much astonished to find the audience laugh, and says the Prince and Princess [of Wales] must doubtless be under no less amazement on the same account. Several Templars and others of the more vociferous kind of critics went with a resolution to hiss, and confessed they were forced to laugh so much that they forgot the design they came with. The Court in general has come in a very particular manner into the jest, and the three nights, notwithstanding two of them were Court nights, were distinguished by very full audiences of the first quality. The common people of the pit and gallery received it at first with great gravity and sedateness, and some few with tears; but after the third day they also took the hint, and have ever since been very loud in their claps. There are still sober men who cannot be of the general opinion, but the laughers are so much the majority that one or two critics seemed determined to undeceive the town at their proper cost, by writing dissertations against it to encourage them in this laudable design. It is resolved a preface shall be prefixed to the farce, in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing.\"[1] The fact is that, as Johnson put it, \"the images were comic and the action grave,\" and there were many mock-heroic passages which parodied tragedies, including Addison's \"Cato\" and Otway's \"Venice Preserved,\" well-known in that day. Also it contained several ballads, of which perhaps the best is \"'Twas when the seas were roaring\" (Act II., Scene 8).  \"The What D'ye Call It\" was not a piece of much value, but it pleased the audience, and Gay was highly delighted. \"Now my benefit night is over, it should be my first care to return my thanks to those to whom I am mostly obliged, and the civilities I have always received from you, and upon this occasion too, claims this acknowledgment,\" the author wrote to Caryll on March 3rd: \"'The What D'ye Call It' met with more success than could be expected from a thing so out of the common taste of the town. It has been played already five nights, and the galleries, who did not know at first what to make of it, now enter thoroughly into the humour, and it seems to please in general better than at first. The parts in general were not so well played as I could have wished, and in particular the part of Filbert, to speak in the style of the French Gazette. Penkethman did wonders; Mrs. Bicknell performed miraculously, and there was much honour gained by Miss Younger, though she was but a parish child.\"[2] Filbert was played by Johnson, Jonas Dock by Penkethman, Joyce (\"Peascod's daughter, left upon the parish\") by Miss Younger, and Kitty by Mrs. Bicknell, mentioned by the author in \"Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece\":--    And frolic Bicknell, and her sister young.  The welcome given by the public to the play brought in its train some annoyance to the author: \"I find success, even in the most trivial things, raises the indignation of scribblers,\" he wrote to Parnell on March 18th, \"for I, for my 'What D'ye Call It' could neither escape the fury of Mr. Burnet or the German doctor. Then, where will rage end when Homer is to be translated? Let Zoilus hasten to your friend's assistance, and envious criticism shall be no more.\"[3] A more biting attack than that of Thomas Burnet's _Grumbler_ (No. 1, February 14th, 1715) or that of Philip Horneck in \"The High German Doctor\" was the \"Key to 'The What D'ye Call It,'\" written by the actor Griffin in collaboration with Lewis Theobald. About this Gay wrote to Caryll in April: \"There is a sixpenny criticism lately published upon the tragedy of 'The What D'ye Call It,' wherein he with much judgment and learning calls me a blockhead and Mr. Pope a knave. His grand charge is against 'The Pilgrim's Progress' being read, which, he says, is directly levelled at Cato's reading Plato. To back this censure he goes on to tell you that 'The Pilgrim's Progress' being mentioned to be the eighth edition makes the reflection evident, the tragedy of 'Cato' being just eight times printed. He has also endeavoured to show that every particular passage of the play alludes to some fine part of the tragedy, which he says I have injudiciously and profanely abused.\"[4]  Still, Gay could really afford to laugh at those who attacked or parodied him, for the play brought him, if not fame, at least notoriety. It also brought him some much-needed money. Pope told Caryll in March that Gay \"will have made about £100 out of this farce\"; and it is known that for the publishing rights Lintott gave him on February 14th £16 2s. 6d.  Gay, now a popular dramatist as well as an intimate friend of many of the leading men in literary circles, became known to people of high social rank, who, like his brethren of the pen, took him up and made a pet of him. In the summer of 1715 Lord Burlington, the \"generous Burlington\" of \"Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece,\" invited him to accompany him to Devonshire, and Gay repaid the compliment by describing his \"Visit to Exeter\" in a poetical \"Epistle to the Right Honourable the Earl of Burlington,\" the first lines of which are:--    While you, my Lord, bid stately piles ascend,   Or in your Chiswick bowers enjoy your friend;   Where Pope unloads the boughs within his reach,   The purple vine, blue plum, and blushing peach;   I journey far.--You know fat bards might tire.   And, mounted, sent me forth your trusty squire.  During his stay in Devonshire Gay began the composition of \"Trivia, or The Art of Walking the Streets of London.\" It was to this that Pope made allusion when writing to Caryll, January 10th, 1716: \"Gay's poem [is] just on the brink of the press, which we have had the interest to procure him subscription of a guinea a book to a tolerable number. I believe it may be worth £150 to him on the whole.\"[5] In addition to the subscriptions, Gay received from Lintott £43 for the copyright of the book, the copies of which were sold to the public at one shilling and sixpence each; and as, with humorous exaggeration, Arbuthnot wrote to Parnell: \"Gay has got as much money by his 'Art of Walking the Streets' that he is ready to set up his equipage; he is just going to the bank to negotiate some exchange bills.\"[6] The \"Advertisement\" prefaced to the poem runs:--  \"The world, I believe, will take so little notice of me that I need not take much of it. The critics may see by this poem that I walk on foot, which probably may save me from their envy. I should be sorry to raise that passion in men whom I am so much obliged to, since they allowed me an honour hitherto only shown to better writers: that of denying me to be author"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13790"],["title","Life And Letters Of John Gay (1685-1732), Author of \"The Beggar's Opera\" (#8)"],["body"," my own works. I am sensible this must be done in pure generosity; because whoever writ them, provided they did not themselves, they are still in the same condition. Gentlemen, if there be any thing in this poem good enough to displease you, and if it be any advantage to you to ascribe it to some person of greater merit, I shall acquaint you for your comfort, that among many other obligations, I owe several hints of it to Dr. Swift. And if you will so far continue your favour as to write against it, I beg you to oblige me in accepting the following motto:--    --Non tu, in triviis, indocte, solebas   Stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen?\"  Whether Swift gave any direct assistance is doubtful. Mr. Austin Dobson thinks that it is not improbable that \"Trivia\" was actually suggested by the \"Morning\" and \"City Shower\" which Swift had previously contributed to Steele's _Tatler_. Probably these are among the \"several hints\" which Gay had in mind.  \"Trivia\" was published on January 26th, 1716, and was the one outstanding feature in the year in the biography of Gay. In the following March 26th there appeared a volume of \"Court Poems,\" published by J. Roberts, who advertised them as from the pen of Pope, though the preface makes the authorship doubtful between Pope, Gay, and a Lady of quality, who was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. To the volume Lady Mary Wortley Montagu contributed \"The Drawing Room,\" Pope \"The Basset Table,\" and Gay \"The Toilet.\" This last has been attributed to Lady Mary, and it has actually been printed among her poems; but, according to Pope, it is \"almost wholly Gay's,\" there being \"only five or six lines in it by that lady.\"  In 1716 Gay paid a second visit to Devonshire, and during the year he composed the \"sober eclogue,\" \"The Espousal,\" which probably arose out of a suggestion of Swift. \"There is an ingenious Quaker[7] in this town, who writes verses to his mistress, not very correct, but in a strain purely what a poetical Quaker should do, commending her looks and habit, etc.\" Swift wrote to Pope on August 30th, 1716: \"It gave me a hint that a set of Quaker pastorals might succeed if our friend Gay could fancy it, and I think it a fruitful subject. Pray hear what he says. I believe farther, the pastoral ridicule is not exhausted, and that a porter, footman, or chairman's pastoral might do well; or what think you of a Newgate pastoral, among the whores and thieves there?\"[8] This letter is of especial importance in the biography of Gay, as it may well have sown in his mind the seed of \"The Beggar's Opera.\"  About this time Gay was labouring on another play, \"Three Hours After Marriage,\" which he wrote in collaboration with Pope and Arbuthnot. It is a sorry piece of work, and unworthy of any one, much less of the three distinguished men associated in the authorship. In the Epilogue it is written:--    Join then your voices, be the play excused   For once, though no one living is abused;  but as a matter of fact one purpose of the play was, as Dr. Johnson said, \"to bring into contempt Dr. Woodward, the fossilist, a man not really or justly contemptible.\" Woodward was the author of a \"History of Fossils,\" and his name survives in the Woodwardian Professorship of Geology at Cambridge. He was introduced as Dr. Cornelius in \"Martin Scriblerus\":--    Who nature's treasures would explore,      Her mysteries and arcana know.   Must high as lofty Newton soar,      Must stoop as delving Woodward low.  The bridegroom in the play is called Fossile, and there was no mistaking the intention. Dr. Woodward had many friends, and these made known their disgust in the most unmistakable manner when \"Three Hours After Marriage\" was produced on January 16th, 1717, at Drury Lane Theatre. It ran for seven nights. \"It had the fate which such outrages deserved,\" Dr. Johnson has written; \"the scene in which Woodward was directly and apparently ridiculed by the introduction of a mummy and a crocodile, disgusted the audience, and the performance was driven off the stage with general condemnation.\"[9] The farce was not only dull, it was vulgar. And the geologist (played by Johnson) was not the only person introduced for the purpose of ridicule. Dennis was brought in as Sir Tremendous, and it was believed that Phoebe Clinket (played by Mrs. Bicknell) was intended for Anne Finch, Countess of Winchelsea, who, says Mr. Austin Dobson, \"was alleged to have spoken contemptuously of Gay.\" Of this farce, Mr. Dobson writes: \"It is perhaps fairer to say that he bore the blame, than that he is justly charged with its errors of taste\"; and it is very probable that, while Gay generously accepted responsibility, Pope and Arbuthnot were equally culpable. \"Too late I see, and confess myself mistaken in relation to the comedy; yet I do not think had I followed your advice and only introduced the mummy, that the absence of the crocodile had saved it,\" Gay wrote to Pope. \"I cannot help laughing myself (though the vulgar do not consider it was designed to look ridiculous) to think how the poor monster and mummy were dashed at their reception; and when the cry was loudest I thought that if the thing had been written by another I should have deemed the town in some measure mistaken; and, as to your apprehension that this may do us future injury, do not think it; the Doctor [Arbuthnot] has a more valuable name than can be hurt by anything of this nature, and yours is doubly safe. I will, if any shame there be, take it all to myself, as indeed I ought, the notion being first mine, and never heartily approved of by you.... I beg of you not to suffer this, or anything else, to hurt your health. As I have publicly said that I was assisted by two friends, I shall still continue in the same story, professing obstinate silence about Dr. Arbuthnot and yourself.\"[10]  The publication in book form of \"Three Hours After Marriage\" by Lintott, who paid £16 2s. 6d. for the copyright, a few days after the production, did nothing to arrest the torrent of abuse. \"Gay's play, among the rest, has cost much time and long suffering to stem a tide of malice and party, that certain authors have raised against it,\" Pope wrote to Parnell. Amongst those foremost among the attackers was Addison, who perhaps had not forgotten or forgiven the parody of some of the lines in his play \"Cato,\" which was introduced by Gay in \"The What D'ye Call It.\" Gay, the most easy-going of men, was always stirred by criticism, and in this case he, with unusual energy, sat down to reply to his detractors. \"Mr. Addison and his friends had exclaimed so much against Gay's 'Three Hours After Marriage' for obscenities, that it provoked him to write 'A Letter from a Lady in the City to a Lady in the Country' on that subject,\" so runs a passage in Spence's Anecdotes of Pope. \"In it he quoted the passages which had been most exclaimed against, and opposed other passages to them from Addison's and Steele's plays. These were aggravated in the same manner that they served his, and appeared worse. Had it been published it would have made Addison appear ridiculous, which he could bear as little as any man. I therefore prevailed upon Gay not to print it, and have the manuscript now by me.\"[11] In Spence's Anecdotes there is another passage bearing on the same matter: \"A fortnight before Addison's death, [12] Lord Warwick [13] came to Gay and pressed him in a very particular manner 'to go and see Mr. Addison,' which he had not done for a great while. Gay went, and found Addison in a very weak way. He received him in the kindest manner and told him, 'that he had desired this visit to beg his pardon, that he had injured him greatly, but that if he lived he should find that he would make it up to him.' Gay, on his going to Hanover, had great reason to hope for some good preferment; but all his views came to nothing. It is not impossible but that Mr. Addison might prevent them, from his thinking Gay too well with some of the great men of the former Ministry. He did not at all explain himself, in which he had injured him, and Gay could not guess at anything else in which he could have injured him so considerably.\"[14] It seems, however, more probable that Addison really had in mind the part he had taken in connection with \"Three Hours After Marriage.\" Two critical publications, \"A Complete Key to 'Three Hours After Marriage,'\" and \"A Letter to John Gay, Concerning his late Farce, entitled a Comedy,\" annoyed Gay; while Pope, too, and, in a minor degree, Arbuthnot, were attacked for their share in the farce. John Durand Breval, writing over the signature of Joseph Gay, published in 1717 \"The Confederates: A Farce,\" in which he introduced a humorous caricature print of Pope, Gay and Arbuthnot, so that, says Professor Courthope, \"Pope, at the height of his fame, found himself credited, though he seems to have had little to do with it, with the past paternity of a condemned play.\"[15] Another incident, recorded by Professor Courthope, further angered Pope: \"While he was still sore at the mishap, Colley Cibber, playing in 'The Rehearsal,' happened to make an impromptu allusion to the unlucky farce, saying that he had intended to introduce the two kings of Brentford, 'one of them in the shape of a mummy, and t'other in that of a crocodile.' The audience laughed, but Pope, who was in the house, appeared (according to Cibber's account) behind the scenes and abused the actor in unmeasured terms for his impertinence. Cibber's only reply was to assure the enraged poet that, so long as the play was acted, he should never fail to repeat the same words. He kept his promise, thus committing the first of that series of offences which, in the poet's vindictive memory, marked him down for elevation to the throne of Dulness which was rendered vacant by the deposition of King Tibbald.\"[16] There is a rumour that Gay, in revenge for Cibber's banter of \"Three Hours After Marriage,\" personally chastised the actor-dramatist,[17] but"]]]
