Ii. Smell. Iii. Hearing. Iv. Vision.  by  HAVELOCK ELLIS  1927        PREFACE.   As in many other of these _Studies_, and perhaps more than in most, the task attempted in the present volume is mainly of a tentative and preliminary character. There is here little scope yet for the presentation of definite scientific results. However it may be in the physical universe, in the cosmos of science our knowledge must be nebulous before it constellates into definitely measurable shapes, and nothing is gained by attempting to anticipate the evolutionary process. Thus it is that here, for the most part, we have to content ourselves at present with the task of mapping out the field in broad and general outlines, bringing together the facts and considerations which indicate the direction in which more extended and precise results will in the future be probably found.  In his famous _Descent of Man_, wherein he first set forth the doctrine of sexual selection, Darwin injured an essentially sound principle by introducing into it a psychological confusion whereby the physiological sensory stimuli through which sexual selection operates were regarded as equivalent to æsthetic preferences. This confusion misled many, and it is only within recent years (as has been set forth in the \"Analysis of the Sexual Impulse\" in the previous volume of these _Studies_) that the investigations and criticisms of numerous workers have placed the doctrine of sexual selection on a firm basis by eliminating its hazardous æsthetic element. Love springs up as a response to a number of stimuli to tumescence, the object that most adequately arouses tumescence being that which evokes love; the question of æsthetic beauty, although it develops on this basis, is not itself fundamental and need not even be consciously present at all. When we look at these phenomena in their broadest biological aspects, love is only to a limited extent a response to beauty; to a greater extent beauty is simply a name for the complexus of stimuli which most adequately arouses love. If we analyze these stimuli to tumescence as they proceed from a person of the opposite sex we find that they are all appeals which must come through the channels of four senses: touch, smell, hearing, and, above all, vision. When a man or a woman experiences sexual love for one particular person from among the multitude by which he or she is surrounded, this is due to the influences of a group of stimuli coming through the channels of one or more of these senses. There has been a sexual selection conditioned by sensory stimuli. This is true even of the finer and more spiritual influences that proceed from one person to another, although, in order to grasp the phenomena adequately, it is best to insist on the more fundamental and less complex forms which they assume. In this sense sexual selection is no longer a hypothesis concerning the truth of which it is possible to dispute; it is a self-evident fact. The difficulty is not as to its existence, but as to the methods by which it may be most precisely measured. It is fundamentally a psychological process, and should be approached from the psychological side. This is the reason for dealing with it here. Obscure as the psychological aspects of sexual selection still remain, they are full of fascination, for they reveal to us the more intimate sides of human evolution, of the process whereby man is molded into the shapes we know.

Histories of Sexual Development.     SEXUAL SELECTION IN MAN.  The External Sensory Stimuli Affecting Selection in Man--The Four Senses Involved.   Tumescence--the process by which the organism is brought into the physical and psychic state necessary to insure conjugation and detumescence--to some extent comes about through the spontaneous action of internal forces. To that extent it is analogous to the physical and psychic changes which accompany the gradual filling of the bladder and precede its evacuation. But even among animals who are by no means high in the zoölogical scale the process is more complicated than this. External stimuli act at every stage, arousing or heightening the process of tumescence, and in normal human beings it may be said that the process is never completed without the aid of such stimuli, for even in the auto-erotic sphere external stimuli are still active, either actually or in imagination.  The chief stimuli which influence tumescence and thus direct sexual choice come chiefly--indeed, exclusively--through the four senses of touch, smell, hearing, and sight. All the phenomena of sexual selection, so far as they are based externally, act through these four senses.[1] The reality of the influence thus exerted may be demonstrated statistically even in civilized man, and it has been shown that, as regards, for instance, eye-color, conjugal partners differ sensibly from the unmarried persons by whom they are surrounded. When, therefore, we are exploring the nature of the influence which stimuli, acting through the sensory channels, exert on the strength and direction of the sexual impulse, we are intimately concerned with the process by which the actual form and color, not alone of living things generally, but of our own species, have been shaped and are still being shaped. At the same time, it is probable, we are exploring the mystery which underlies all the subtle appreciations, all the emotional undertones, which are woven in the web of the whole world as it appeals to us through those sensory passages by which alone it can reach us. We are here approaching, therefore, a fundamental subject of unsurpassable importance, a subject which has not yet been accurately explored save at a few isolated points and one which it is therefore impossible to deal with fully and adequately. Yet it cannot be passed over, for it enters into the whole psychology of the sexual instinct.  Of the four senses--touch, smell, hearing, and sight--with which we are here concerned, touch is the most primitive, and it may be said to be the most important, though it is usually the last to make its appeal felt. Smell, which occupies the chief place among many animals, is of comparatively less importance, though of considerable interest, in man; it is only less intimate and final than touch. Sight occupies an intermediate position, and on this account, and also on account of the very great part played by vision in life generally as well as in art, it is the most important of all the senses from the human sexual point of view. Hearing, from the same point of view, is the most remote of all the senses in its appeal to the sexual impulse, and on that account it is, when it intervenes, among the first to make its influence felt.   FOOTNOTES:  [1] Taste must, I believe, be excluded, for if we abstract the parts of touch and smell, even in those abnormal sexual acts in which it may seem to be affected, taste could scarcely have any influence. Most of our \"tasting,\" as Waller puts it, is done by the nose, which, in man, is in specially close relationship, posteriorly, with the mouth. There are at most four taste sensations--sweet, bitter, salt, and sour--if even all of these are simple tastes. What commonly pass for taste sensations, as shown by some experiments of G.T.W. Patrick (_Psychological Review_, 1898, p. 160), are the composite results of the mingling of sensations of smell, touch, temperature, sight, and taste.     TOUCH.  I.  The Primitive Character of the Skin--Its Qualities--Touch the Earliest Source of Sensory Pleasure--The Characteristics of Touch--As the Alpha and Omega of Affection--The Sexual Organs a Special Adaptation of Touch--Sexual Attraction as Originated by Touch--Sexual Hyperæsthesia to Touch--The Sexual Associations of Acne.   We are accustomed to regard the skin as mainly owing its existence to the need for the protection of the delicate vessels, nerves, viscera, and muscles underneath. Undoubtedly it performs, and by its tough and elastic texture is well fitted to perform, this extremely important service. But the skin is not merely a method of protection against the external world; it is also a method of bringing us into sensitive contact with the external world. It is thus, as the organ of touch, the seat of the most widely diffused sense we possess, and, moreover, the sense which is the most ancient and fundamental of all--the mother of the other senses.  It is scarcely necessary to insist that the primitive nature of the sensory function of the skin with the derivative nature of the other senses, is a well ascertained and demonstrable fact. The lower we descend in the animal scale, the more varied we find the functions of the skin to be, and if in the higher animals much of the complexity has disappeared, that is only because the specialization of the various skin regions into distinct organs has rendered this complexity unnecessary. Even yet, however, in man himself the skin still retains, in a more or less latent condition, much of its varied and primary power, and the analysis of pathological and even normal phenomena serves to bring these old powers into clear light.      Woods Hutchinson (_Studies in Human and Comparative Pathology_,     1901, Chapters VII and VIII) has admirably set forth the immense     importance of the skin, as in the first place \"a tissue which is     silk to the touch, the most exquisitely beautiful surface in the     universe to the eye, and yet a wall of adamant against hostile     attack. Impervious alike, by virtue of its wonderful responsive     vitality, to moisture and drought, cold and heat, electrical     changes, hostile bacteria, the most virulent of poisons and the     deadliest of gases, it is one of the real Wonders of the World.     More beautiful than velvet, softer and more pliable than silk,     more impervious than rubber, and more durable under exposure than     steel, well-nigh as resistant to electric currents as glass, it     is one of the toughest and most dangerproof substances in the     three kingdoms of nature\" (although, as this author adds, we     \"hardly dare permit it to see the sunlight or breathe the open     air\"). But it is more than this. It is, as Woods Hutchinson     expresses it, the creator of the entire body; its embryonic     infoldings form the alimentary canal, the brain, the spinal cord,     while every sense is but a specialization of its general organic     activity. It is furthermore a kind of \"skin-heart,\" promoting the     circulation by its own energy; it is the great heat-regulating     organ of the body; it is an excretory organ only second to the     kidneys, which descend from it, and finally it still remains the     seat of touch.      It may be added that the extreme beauty of the skin as a surface     is very clearly brought out by the inadequacy of the comparisons     commonly used in order to express its beauty. Snow, marble,     alabaster, ivory, milk, cream, silk, velvet, and all the other     conventional similes furnish surfaces which from any point of     view are incomparably inferior to the skin itself. (Cf. Stratz,     _Die Schönheit des Weiblichen Körpers_, Chapter XII.)      With reference to the extraordinary vitality of the skin,     emphasized by Woods Hutchinson, it may be added that, when     experimenting on the skin with the electric current, Waller found     that healthy skin showed signs of life ten days or more after     excision. It has been found also that fragments of skin which     have been preserved in sterile fluid for even as long as nine     months may still be successfully transplanted on to the body.     (_British Medical Journal_, July 19, 1902.)      Everything indicates, remark Stanley Hall and Donaldson (\"Motor     Sensations in the Skin,\" _Mind_, 1885), that the skin is \"not     only the primeval and most reliable source of our knowledge of     the external world or the archæological field of psychology,\" but     a field in which work may shed light on some of the most     fundamental problems of psychic action. Groos (_Spiele der     Menschen_, pp. 8-16) also deals with the primitive character of     touch sensations.      Touch sensations are without doubt the first of all the sensory"]]]
