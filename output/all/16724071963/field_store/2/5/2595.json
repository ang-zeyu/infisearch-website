Good healthy lung tissue will resist the germs, and the only way to have good healthy lung tissue is to use the lungs properly.  Consumptives are nearly all narrow-chested. What does this mean? Simply that these people were addicted to improper habits of breathing, and consequently their chests failed to develop and expand. The man who practices the Complete Breath will have a full broad chest, end the narrow-chested man may develop his chest to normal proportions if he will but adopt this mode of breathing. Such people must develop their chest cavities if they value their lives. Colds may often be prevented by practicing a little vigorous Complete Breathing whenever you feel that you are being unduly exposed. When chilled, breathe vigorously a few minutes, and you will feel a glow all over your body. Most colds can be cured by Complete Breathing and partial fasting for a day.  The quality of the blood depends largely upon its proper oxygenation in the lungs, and if it is under-oxygenated it becomes poor in quality and laden with all sorts of impurities, and the system suffers from lack of nourishment, and often becomes actually poisoned by the waste products remaining uneliminated in the blood. As the entire body, every organ and every part, is dependent upon the blood for nourishment, impure blood must have a serious effect upon the entire system. The remedy is plain--practice the Yogi Complete Breath.  The stomach and other organs of nutrition suffer much from improper breathing. Not only are they ill nourished by reason of the lack of oxygen, but as the food must absorb oxygen from the blood and become oxygenated before it can be digested and assimilated, it is readily seen how digestion and assimilation is impaired by incorrect breathing. And when assimilation is not normal, the system receives less and less nourishment, the appetite fails, bodily vigor decreases, and energy diminishes, and the man withers and declines. All from the lack of proper breathing.  Even the nervous system suffers from improper breathing, inasmuch as the brain, the spinal cord, the nerve centers, and the nerves themselves, when improperly nourished by means of the blood, become poor and inefficient instruments for generating, storing and transmitting the nerve currents. And improperly nourished they will become if sufficient oxygen is not absorbed through the lungs. There is another aspect of the case whereby the nerve currents themselves, or rather the force from which the nerve currents spring, becomes lessened from want of proper breathing, but this belongs to another phase of the subject which is treated of in other chapters of this book, and our purpose here is to direct your attention to the fact that the mechanism of the nervous system is rendered inefficient as an instrument for conveying nerve force, as the indirect result of a lack of proper breathing.  The effect of the reproductive organs upon the general health is too well known to be discussed at length here, but we may be permitted to say that with the reproductive organs in a weakened condition the entire system feels the reflex action and suffers sympathetically. The Complete Breath produces a rhythm which is Nature's own plan for keeping this important part of the system in normal condition, and, from the first, it will be noticed that the reproductive functions are strengthened and vitalized, thus, by sympathetic reflex action, giving tone to the whole system. By this, we do not mean that the lower sex impulses will be aroused; far from it. The Yogis are advocates of continence and chastity, and have learned to control the animal passions. But sexual control does not mean sexual weakness, and the Yogi teachings are that the man or woman whose reproductive organism is normal and healthy, will have a stronger will with which to control himself or herself. The Yogi believes that much of the perversion of this wonderful part of the system comes from a lack of normal health, and results from a morbid rather than a normal condition of these organs. A little careful consideration of this question will prove that the Yogi teachings are right. This is not the place to discuss the subject fully, but the Yogis know that sex-energy may be conserved and used for the development of the body and mind of the individual, instead of being dissipated in unnatural excesses as is the wont of so many uninformed people. By special request we will give in this book one of the favorite Yogi exercises for this purpose. But whether or not the student wishes to adopt the Yogi theories of continence and clean-living, he or she will find that the Complete Breath will do more to restore health to this part of the system than anything else ever tried. Remember, now, we mean normal health, not undue development. The sensualist will find that normal means a lessening of desire rather than an increase; the weakened man or woman will find a toning up and a relief from the weakness which has heretofore depressed him or her. We do not wish to be misunderstood or misquoted on this subject. The Yogis' ideal is a body strong in all its parts, under the control of a masterful and developed Will, animated by high ideals.  In the practice of the Complete Breath, during inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and exerts a gentle pressure upon the liver, stomach and other organs, which in connection with the rhythm of the lungs acts as a gentle massage of these organs and stimulates their actions, and encourages normal functioning. Each inhalation aids in this internal exercise, and assists in causing a normal circulation to the organs of nutrition and elimination. In High or Mid Breathing the organs lose the benefit accruing from this internal massage.  The Western world is paying much attention to Physical Culture just now, which is a good thing. But in their enthusiasm they must not forget that the exercise of the external muscles is not everything. The internal organs also need exercise, and Nature's plan for this exercise is proper breathing. The diaphragm is Nature's principal instrument for this internal exercise. Its motion vibrates the important organs of nutrition and elimination, and massages and kneads them at each inhalation and exhalation, forcing blood into them, and then squeezing it out, and imparting a general tone to the organs. Any organ or part of the body which is not exercised gradually atrophies and refuses to function properly, and lack of the internal exercise afforded by the diaphragmatic action leads to diseased organs. The Complete Breath gives the proper motion to the diaphragm, as well as exercising the middle and upper chest. It is indeed \"complete\" in its action.  From the standpoint of Western physiology alone, without reference to the Oriental philosophies and science, this Yogi system of Complete Breathing is of vital importance to every man, woman and child who wishes to acquire health and keep it. Its very simplicity keeps thousands from seriously considering it, while they spend fortunes in seeking health through complicated and expensive \"systems.\" Health knocks at their door and they answer not. Verily the stone which the builders reject is the real cornerstone of the Temple of Health.     CHAPTER X.   A FEW BITS OF YOGI LORE.  We give below three forms of breath, quite popular among the Yogis. The first is the well-known Yogi Cleansing Breath, to which is attributed much of the great lung endurance found among the Yogis. They usually finish up a breathing exercise with this Cleansing Breath, and we have followed this plan in this book. We also give the Yogi Nerve Vitalizing Exercise, which has been handed down among them for ages, and which has never been improved on by Western teachers of Physical Culture, although some of them have \"borrowed\" it from teachers of Yoga. We also give the Yogi Vocal Breath, which accounts largely for the melodious, vibrant voices of the better class of the Oriental Yogis. We feel that if this book contained nothing more than these three exercises, it would be invaluable to the Western student. Take these exercises as a gift from your Eastern brothers and put them into practice.  THE YOGI CLEANSING BREATH.  The Yogis have a favorite form of breathing which they practice when they feel the necessity of ventilating and cleansing the lungs. They conclude many of their other breathing exercises with this breath, and we have followed this practice in this book. This Cleansing Breath ventilates and cleanses the lungs, stimulates the cells and gives a general tone to the respiratory organs, and is conducive to their general healthy condition. Besides this effect, it is found to greatly refresh the entire system. Speakers, singers, etc., will find this breath especially restful, after having tired the respiratory organs.       (1) Inhale a complete breath.       (2) Retain the air a few seconds.       (3) Pucker up the lips as if for a whistle (but do not swell      out the cheeks), then exhale a little air through the      opening, with considerable vigor. Then stop for a moment,      retaining the air, and then exhale a little more air. Repeat      until the air is completely exhaled. Remember that      considerable vigor is to be used in exhaling the air through      the opening in the lips.  This breath will be found quite refreshing when one is tired and generally \"used up.\" A trial will convince the student of its merits. This exercise should be practiced until it can be performed naturally and easily, as it is used to finish up a number of other exercises given in this book, and it should be thoroughly understood.   THE YOGI NERVE VITALIZING BREATH.  This is an exercise well known to the Yogis, who consider it one of the strongest nerve stimulants and invigorants"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],["title","The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#7)"],["body","to man. Its purpose is to stimulate the Nervous System, develop nerve force, energy and vitality. This exercise brings a stimulating pressure to bear on important nerve centers, which in turn stimulate and energize the entire nervous system, and send an increased flow of nerve force to all parts of the body.       (1) Stand erect.       (2) Inhale a Complete Breath, and retain same.       (3) Extend the arms straight in front of you, letting them      be somewhat limp and relaxed, with only sufficient nerve      force to hold them out.       (4) Slowly draw the hands back toward the shoulders,      gradually contracting the muscles and putting force into      them, so that when they reach the shoulders the fists will      be so tightly clenched that a tremulous motion is felt.       (5) Then, keeping the muscles tense, push the fists slowly      out, and then draw them back rapidly (still tense) several      times.       (6) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.       (7) Practice the Cleansing Breath.  The efficiency of this exercise depends greatly upon the speed of the drawing back of the fists, and the tension of the muscles, and, of course, upon the full lungs. This exercise must be tried to be appreciated. It is without equal as a \"bracer,\" as our Western friends put it.   THE YOGI VOCAL BREATH.  The Yogis have a form of breathing to develop the voice. They are noted for their wonderful voices, which are strong, smooth and clear, and have a wonderful trumpet-like carrying power. They have practiced this particular form of breathing exercise which has resulted in rendering their voices soft, beautiful and flexible, imparting to it that indescribable, peculiar floating quality, combined with great power. The exercise given below will in time impart the above-mentioned qualities, or the Yogi Voice, to the student who practices it faithfully. It is to be understood, of course, that this form of breath is to be used only as an occasional exercise, and not as a regular form of breathing.       (1) Inhale a Complete Breath very slowly, but steadily,      through the nostrils, taking as much time as possible in the      inhalation.       (2) Retain for a few seconds.       (3) Expel the air vigorously in one great breath, through      the wide opened mouth.       (4) Rest the lungs by the Cleansing Breath.  Without going deeply into the Yogi theories of sound-production in speaking and singing, we wish to say that experience has taught them that the timbre, quality and power of a voice depends not alone upon the vocal organs in the throat, but that the facial muscles, etc., have much to do with the matter. Some men with large chests produce but a poor tone, while others with comparatively small chests produce tones of amazing strength and quality. Here is an interesting experiment worth trying: Stand before a glass and pucker up your mouth and whistle, and note the shape of your mouth and the general expression of your face. Then sing or speak as you do naturally, and see the difference. Then start to whistle again for a few seconds, and then, _without changing the position of your lips or face_, sing a few notes and notice what a vibrant, resonant, clear and beautiful tone is produced.     CHAPTER XI.   THE SEVEN YOGI DEVELOPING EXERCISES.  The following are the seven favorite exercises of the Yogis for developing the lungs, muscles, ligaments, air cells, etc. They are quite simple but marvelously effective. Do not let the simplicity of these exercises make you lose interest, for they are the result of careful experiments and practice on the part of the Yogis, and are the essence of numerous intricate and complicated exercises, the non-essential portions being eliminated and the essential features retained.  (1) THE RETAINED BREATH.  This is a very important exercise which tends to strengthen and develop the respiratory muscles as well as the lungs, and its frequent practice will also tend to expand the chest. The Yogis have found that an occasional holding of the breath, after the lungs have been filled with the Complete Breath, is very beneficial, not only to the respiratory organs but to the organs of nutrition, the nervous system and the blood itself. They have found that an occasional holding of the breath tends to purify the air which has remained in the lungs from former inhalations, and to more fully oxygenate the blood. They also know that the breath so retained gathers up all the waste matter, and when the breath is expelled it carries with it the effete matter of the system, and cleanses the lungs just as a purgative does the bowels. The Yogis recommend this exercise for various disorders of the stomach, liver and blood, and also find that it frequently relieves bad breath, which often arises from poorly ventilated lungs. We recommend students to pay considerable attention to this exercise, as it has great merits. The following directions will give you a clear idea of the exercise:       (1) Stand erect.       (2) Inhale a Complete Breath.       (3) Retain the air as long as you can comfortably.       (4) Exhale vigorously through the open mouth.       (5) Practice the Cleansing Breath.  At first you will be able to retain the breath only a short time, but a little practice will also show a great improvement. Time yourself with a watch if you wish to note your progress.  (2) LUNG CELL STIMULATION.  This exercise is designed to stimulate the air cells in the lungs, but beginners must not overdo it, and in no case should it be indulged in too vigorously. Some may find a slight dizziness resulting from the first few trials, in which case let them walk around a little and discontinue the exercise for a while.       (1) Stand erect, with hands at sides.       (2) Breathe in very slowly and gradually.       (3) While inhaling, gently tap the chest with the finger      tips, constantly changing position.       (4) When the lungs are filled, retain the breath and pat the      chest with the palms of the hands.       (5) Practice the Cleansing Breath.  This exercise is very bracing and stimulating to the whole body, and is a well-known Yogi practice. Many of the air cells of the lungs become inactive by reason of incomplete breathing, and often become almost atrophied. One who has practiced imperfect breathing for years will find it not so easy to stimulate all these ill-used air cells into activity all at once by the Complete Breath, but this exercise will do much toward bringing about the desired result, and is worth study and practice.  (3) RIB STRETCHING.  We have explained that the ribs are fastened by cartilages, which admit of considerable expansion. In proper breathing, the ribs play an important part, and it is well to occasionally give them a little special exercise in order to preserve their elasticity. Standing or sitting in unnatural positions, to which many of the Western people are addicted, is apt to render the ribs more or less stiff and inelastic, and this exercise will do much to overcome same.       (1) Stand erect.       (2) Place the hands one on each side of the body, as high up      under the armpits as convenient, the thumbs reaching toward      the back, the palms on the side of the chest and the fingers      to the front over the breast.       (3) Inhale a Complete Breath.       (4) Retain the air for a short time.       (5) Then gently squeeze the sides, at the same time slowly      exhaling.       (6) Practice the cleansing breath.  Use moderation in this exercise and do not overdo its  (4) CHEST EXPANSION.  The chest is quite apt to be contracted from bending over one's work, etc. This exercise is very good for the purpose of restoring natural conditions and gaining chest expansion.       (1) Stand erect.       (2) Inhale a Complete Breath.       (3) Retain the air.       (4) Extend both arms forward and bring the two clenched      fists together on a level with the shoulder.       (5) Then swing back the fists vigorously until the arms      stand out straight sideways from the shoulders.       (6) Then bring back to Position 4, and swing to Position 5.      Repeat several times.       (7) Exhale vigorously through the opened mouth.       (8) Practice the Cleansing Breath.  Use moderation and do not overdo this exercise.  (5) WALKING EXERCISE.       (1) Walk with head up, chin drawn slightly in, shoulders      back, and with measured tread.       (2) Inhale a Complete Breath, counting (mentally) 1, 2, 3,      4, 5, 6, 7, 8, one count to each step, making the inhalation      extend over the eight counts.       (3) Exhale slowly through the nostrils, counting as      before--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--one count to a step.       (4) Rest between breaths, continuing walking and counting,      I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 8, one count to a step.       (5) Repeat until you begin to feel tired. Then rest for a      while, and resume at pleasure. Repeat several times a day.  Some Yogis vary this exercise by retaining the breath during a 1, 2, 3, 4, count, and then exhale in an eight-step count. Practice whichever plan seems most agreeable to you.  (6) MORNING EXERCISE.       (1) Stand erect in a military attitude, head up, eyes front,      shoulders back, knees stiff, hands at sides.       (2) Raise body slowly on toes, inhaling a Complete Breath,      steadily and slowly.       (3) Retain the breath for a few seconds, maintaining the      same position.       (4) Slowly sink to first position, at the same time slowly      exhaling the air through the nostrils.       (5) Practice Cleansing Breath.       (6) Repeat several times, varying by using right leg alone,      then left leg alone.  (7) STIMULATING CIRCULATION.       (1) Stand erect.       (2) Inhale a Complete Breath and retain.       (3) Bend forward slightly and grasp a stick or cane steadily      and firmly, and gradually exerting your entire strength upon      the grasp.       (4) Relax the grasp, return to first position, and"]]]
