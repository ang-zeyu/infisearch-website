Pink went immediately to his bunk and began pulling off his boots.  \"I'm going to bed,\" he told them. \"You fellows can stay up and entertain her if yuh want to--_I_ won't!\"  They caught the idea and disrobed hastily, though the evening was young. Irish blew out the lamp and dove under the blankets just as voices came faintly from up the hill, so that when Chip rapped a warning with his knuckles on the door, there was no sound within save an artificial snore from the corner where lay Pink. Chip was not in the habit of knocking before he entered, but he repeated the summons with emphasis.  \"Who's there-e?\" drawled sleepily a voice--the voice of Weary.  \"Oh, I do believe they've retired!\" came, in a perturbed feminine tone, to the listening ears of the Happy Family.  \"Gone to bed?\" cried Chip gravely.  \"Hours ago,\" lied Andy fluently. \"We're plumb wore out. What's happened?\"  \"Oh, don't disturb the poor fellows! They're tired and need their rest,\" came the perturbed tone again. After that the voices and the footsteps went up the hill again, and the Happy Family breathed freer. Incidentally, Pink stopped snoring and made a cigarette.  Going to bed at seven-thirty or thereabouts was not the custom of the Happy Family, but they stayed under the covers and smoked and discussed the situation. They dared not have a light, and the night was longer than they had ever known a night to be, for it was late before they slept. It was well that Miss Verbena Martin could not overhear their talk, which was unchivalrous and unfriendly in the extreme. The general opinion seemed to be that old maid improvers would better stay at home where they might possibly be welcome, and that when the Happy Family wanted improving they would let her know. Cal Emmett said that he wouldn't mind, if they had only sent a young, pretty one. Happy Jack prophesied plenty of trouble, and boasted that she couldn't haul _him_ into no s'ciety. Slim declared again that by golly, she wouldn't do no improving on _him_, and the others--Weary and Irish and Pink and Jack Bates and Andy--discussed ways and means and failed always to agree. When each one hoots derision at all plans but his own, it is easy guessing what will be the result. In this particular instance the result was voices raised in argument--voices that reached Chip, grinning and listening on the porch of the White House--and tardy slumber overtaking a disgruntled Happy Family on the brink of violence.  It was not a particularly happy Family that woke to memory and a snowy Sunday; woke late, because of the disturbing evening. When they spoke to one another their voices were but growls, and when they trailed through the snow to their breakfast they went in moody silence.  They had just brightened a bit before Patsy's Sunday breakfast, which included hot-cakes and maple syrup, when the door was pushed quietly open and the Little Doctor came in, followed closely by Miss Martin; an apologetic Little Doctor, who seemed, by her very manner of entering, to implore them not to blame _her_ for the intrusion. Miss Martin was not apologetic. She was disconcertingly eager and glad to meet them, and pathetically anxious to win their favor.  Miss Martin talked, and the Happy Family ate hurriedly and with lowered eyelids. Miss Martin asked questions, and the Happy Family kicked one another's shins under the table by way of urging someone to reply; for this reason there was a quite perceptible pause between question and answer, and the answer was invariably \"the soul of wit\"--according to that famous recipe. Miss Martin told them naively all about her hopes and her plans and herself, and about the distant woman's club that took so great an interest in their welfare, and the Happy Family listened dejectedly and tried to be polite. Also, they did not relish the hot-cakes as usual, and Patsy had half the batter left when the meal was over, instead of being obliged to mix more, as was usually the case.  When they had eaten, the Happy Family filed out decorously and went hastily down to the stables. They did not say much, but they did glance over their shoulders uneasily once or twice.  \"The old girl is sure hot on our trail,\" Pink remarked when they were safely through the big gate. \"She must uh got us mixed up with some Wild West show, in her mind. Josephine!\"  \"Well, by golly, she don't improve _me_,\" Slim repeated for about the tenth time.  The horses were all fed and everything tidy for the day, and several saddles were being hauled down significantly from their pegs, when Irish delivered himself of a speech, short but to the point. Irish had been very quiet and had taken no part in the discussion that had waxed hot all that morning.  \"Now, see here,\" he said in his decided way. \"Maybe it didn't strike you as anything but funny--which it sure is. But yuh want to remember that the old girl has come a dickens of a long ways to do us some good. She's been laying awake nights thinking about how we'll get to calling her something nice: Angel of the Roundup, maybe--you can't tell, she's that romantic. And right here is where I'm going to give the old girl the worth of her money. It won't hurt _us_, letting her talk wild and foolish at us once a week, maybe; and the poor old thing'll just be tickled to death thinking what a lot uh good she's doing. She won't stay long, and--well, I go in. If she'll feel better and more good to the world improving me, she's got my permission. I guess I can stand it a while.\"  The Happy Family looked at him queerly, for if there was a black sheep in the flock, Irish was certainly the man; and to have Irish take the stand he did was, to say the least, unexpected.  Cal Emmett blurted the real cause of their astonishment. \"You'll have to sign the pledge, first pass,\" he said. \"That's going to be the ante in _her_ game. How--\"  \"Well, I don't play nobody's hand, or stake anybody's chips, but my own,\" Irish retorted, the blood showing under the tan on his cheeks.  \"And we won't das't roll a cigarette, even, by golly!\" reminded Slim. For Miss Martin, whether intentionally or not, had made plain to them the platform of the new society.  Irish got some deep creases between his eyebrows, and put back his saddle. \"You can do as yuh like,\" he said, coldly. \"I'm going to stay and go to meeting this afternoon, according to her invite. If it's going to make that poor old freak feel any better thinking she's a real missionary--\" He turned and walked out of the stable without finishing the sentence, and the Happy Family stood quite still and watched him go.  Pink it was who first spoke. \"I ain't the boy to let any long-legged son-of-a-gun like Irish hit a gait I can't follow,\" he dimpled, and took the saddle reluctantly off Toots. \"If he can stand it, I guess I can.\"  Weary loosened his latigo. \"If Cadwolloper is going to learn poetry, I will, too,\" he grinned. \"Mama! it'll be good as a three-ringed circus! I never thought uh that, before. I couldn't miss it.\"  \"Oh, well, if you fellows take a hand, I'll sure have to be there to see,\" Andy decided. \"Two o'clock, did she say?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I hate to be called a quitter,\" Pink remarked dispiritedly to the Happy Family in general; a harassed looking Happy Family, which sat around and said little, and watched the clock. In an hour they would be due to attend the second meeting of the M.I.S.S.--and one would think, from the look of them, that they were about to be hanged. \"I hate to be called a quitter, but right here's where I lay 'em down. The rest of yuh can go on being improved, if yuh want to--darned if I will, though. I'm all in.\"  \"I don't recollect hearing anybody say we wanted to,\" growled Jack Bates. \"Irish, maybe, is still burning with a desire to be nice and chivalrous; but you can count me out. One dose is about all I can stand.\"  \"By golly, I wouldn't go and feel that foolish again, not if yuh paid me for it,\" Slim declared.  Irish grinned and reached for his hat. \"I done my damnettest,\" he said cheerfully. \"I made the old girl happy once; now, one Irish Mallory is due to have a little joy coming his way. I'm going to town.\"      \"'Break, break, break, on thy cold, gray crags, oh sea,     And I would that my tongue could utter the thoughts that come over me.'  \"You will observe, gentlemen, the beautiful sentiment, the euphonious rhythm, the noble--\" Weary went down, still declaiming mincingly, beneath four irate bodies that hurled themselves toward him and upon him.  \"We'll break, break, break every bone in your body if you don't shut up. You will observe the beautiful sentiment of _that_ a while,\" cried Pink viciously. \"I've had the euphonious rhythm of my sleep broke up ever since I set there and listened at her for two hours. Josephine!\"  Irish stopped with his hand on the door knob. \"I was the jay that started it,\" he admitted contritely. \"But, honest, I never had a hunch she was plumb locoed; I thought she was just simply foolish. Come on to town, boys!\"  Such is the power of suggestion that in fifteen minutes the Happy Family had passed out of sight over the top of the grade; all save Andy Green, who told them he would be along after a while, and that they need not wait. He looked at the clock, smoked a meditative cigarette and went up to the White House, to attend the second meeting of the Mutual Improvement and Social Society.  When he faced alone Miss Verbena Martin, and explained that the other members were unavoidably absent because they had a grudge against a man in Dry Lake and had gone in to lynch him and burn the town, Miss Martin was shocked into postponing the meeting. Andy said he was glad, because he wanted to go in and see the fight; undoubtedly, he assured her, there would be a fight, and probably a few of them would get killed off.

CHAPTERS ON JEWISH LITERATURE      BY     ISRAEL ABRAHAMS, M.A.     _Author of \"Jewish Life in the Middle Ages\"_       PHILADELPHIA     THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA      COPYRIGHT, 1899, BY     THE JEWISH PUBLICATION SOCIETY OF AMERICA      The Lord Baltimore Press     BALTIMORE, MD., U.S.A.     PREFACE   These twenty-five short chapters on Jewish Literature open with the fall of Jerusalem in the year 70 of the current era, and end with the death of Moses Mendelssohn in 1786. Thus the period covered extends over more than seventeen centuries. Yet, long as this period is, it is too brief. To do justice to the literature of Judaism even in outline, it is clearly necessary to include the Bible, the Apocrypha, and the writings of Alexandrian Jews, such as Philo. Only by such an inclusion can the genius of the Hebrew people be traced from its early manifestations through its inspired prime to its brilliant after-glow in the centuries with which this little volume deals.  One special reason has induced me to limit this book to the scope indicated above. The Bible has been treated in England and America in a variety of excellent text-books written by and for Jews and Jewesses. It seemed to me very doubtful whether the time is, or ever will be, ripe for dealing with the Scriptures from the purely literary stand-point in teaching young students. But this is the stand-point of this volume. Thus I have refrained from including the Bible, because, on the one hand, I felt that I could not deal with it as I have tried to deal with the rest of Hebrew literature, and because, on the other hand, there was no necessity for me to attempt to add to the books already in use. The sections to which I have restricted myself are only rarely taught to young students in a consecutive manner, except in so far as they fall within the range of lessons on Jewish History. It was strongly urged on me by a friend of great experience and knowledge, that a small text-book on later Jewish Literature was likely to be found useful both for home and school use. Such a book might encourage the elementary study of Jewish literature in a wider circle than has hitherto been reached. Hence this book has been compiled with the definite aim of providing an elementary manual. It will be seen that both in the inclusions and exclusions the author has followed a line of his own, but he lays no claim to originality. The book is simply designed as a manual for those who may wish to master some of the leading characteristics of the subject, without burdening themselves with too many details and dates.  This consideration has in part determined also the method of the book. In presenting an outline of Jewish literature three plans are possible. One can divide the subject according to _Periods_. Starting with the Rabbinic Age and closing with the activity of the earlier Gaonim, or Persian Rabbis, the First Period would carry us to the eighth or the ninth century. A well-marked Second Period is that of the Arabic-Spanish writers, a period which would extend from the ninth to the fifteenth century. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century forms a Third Period with distinct characteristics. Finally, the career of Mendelssohn marks the definite beginning of the Modern Period. Such a grouping of the facts presents many advantages, but it somewhat obscures the varying conditions prevalent at one and the same time in different countries where the Jews were settled. Hence some writers have preferred to arrange the material under the different _untries_. It is quite possible to draw a map of the world's civilization by merely marking the successive places in which Jewish literature has fixed its head-quarters. But, on the other hand, such a method of classification has the disadvantage that it leads to much overlapping. For long intervals together, it is impossible to separate Italy from Spain, France from Germany, Persia from Egypt, Constantinople from Amsterdam. This has induced other writers to propose a third method and to trace _Influences_, to indicate that, whereas Rabbinism may be termed the native product of the Jewish genius, the scientific, poetical, and philosophical tendencies of Jewish writers in the Middle Ages were due to the interaction of external and internal forces. Further, in this arrangement, the Ghetto period would have a place assigned to it as such, for it would again mark the almost complete sway of purely Jewish forces in Jewish literature. Adopting this classification, we should have a wave of Jewish impulse, swollen by the accretion of foreign waters, once more breaking on a Jewish strand, with its contents in something like the same condition in which they left the original spring. All these three methods are true, and this has impelled me to refuse to follow any one of them to the exclusion of the other two. I have tried to trace _influences_, to observe _periods_, to distinguish _countries_. I have also tried to derive color and vividness by selecting prominent personalities round which to group whole cycles of facts. Thus, some of the chapters bear the names of famous men, others are entitled from periods, others from countries, and yet others are named from the general currents of European thought. In all this my aim has been very modest. I have done little in the way of literary criticism, but I felt that a dry collection of names and dates was the very thing I had to avoid. I need not say that I have done my best to ensure accuracy in my statements by referring to the best authorities known to me on each division of the subject. To name the works to which I am indebted would need a list of many of the best-known products of recent Continental and American scholarship. At the end of every chapter I have, however, given references to some English works and essays. Graetz is cited in the English translation published by the Jewish Publication Society of America. The figures in brackets refer to the edition published in London. The American and the English editions of S. Schechter's \"Studies in Judaism\" are similarly referred to.  Of one thing I am confident. No presentation of the facts, however bald and inadequate it be, can obscure the truth that this little book deals with a great and an inspiring literature. It is possible to question whether the books of great Jews always belonged to the great books of the world. There may have been, and there were, greater legalists than Rashi, greater poets than Jehuda Halevi, greater philosophers than Maimonides, greater moralists than Bachya. But there has been no greater literature than that which these and numerous other Jews represent.  Rabbinism was a sequel to the Bible, and if like all sequels it was unequal to its original, it nevertheless shared its greatness. The works of all Jews up to the modern period were the sequel to this sequel. Through them all may be detected the unifying principle that literature in its truest sense includes life itself; that intellect is the handmaid to conscience; and that the best books are those which best teach men how to live. This underlying unity gave more harmony to Jewish literature than is possessed by many literatures more distinctively national. The maxim, \"Righteousness delivers from death,\" applies to books as well as to men. A literature whose consistent theme is Righteousness is immortal. On the very day on which Jerusalem fell, this theory of the interconnection between literature and life became the fixed principle of Jewish thought, and it ceased to hold undisputed sway only in the age of Mendelssohn. It was in the \"Vineyard\" of Jamnia that the theory received its firm foundation. A starting-point for this volume will therefore be sought in the meeting-place in which the Rabbis, exiled from the Holy City, found a new fatherland in the Book of books.
