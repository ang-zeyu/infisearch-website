It is sufficiently clear that there is on the surface a striking analogy between sexual desire and the impulse to evacuate an excretion, and that this analogy is not only seen in the frog, but extends also to the highest vertebrates. It is quite another matter, however, to assert that the sexual impulse can be adequately defined as an impulse to evacuate. To show fully the inadequate nature of this conception would require a detailed consideration of the facts of sexual life. That is, however, unnecessary. It is enough to point out certain considerations which alone suffice to invalidate this view. In the first place, it must be remarked that the trifling amount of fluid emitted in sexual intercourse is altogether out of proportion to the emotions aroused by the act and to its after-effect on the organism; the ancient dictum _omne animal post coitum triste_ may not be exact, but it is certain that the effect of coitus on the organism is far more profound than that produced by the far more extensive evacuation of the bladder or bowels. Again, this definition leaves unexplained all those elaborate preliminaries which, both in man and the lower animals, precede the sexual act, preliminaries which in civilized human beings sometimes themselves constitute a partial satisfaction to the sexual impulse. It must also be observed that, unlike the ordinary excretions, this discharge of the sexual glands is not always, or in every person, necessary at all. Moreover, the theory of evacuation at once becomes hopelessly inadequate when we apply it to women; no one will venture to claim that an adequate psychological explanation of the sexual impulse in a woman is to be found in the desire to expel a little bland mucus from the minute glands of the genital tract. We must undoubtedly reject this view of the sexual impulse. It has a certain element of truth and it permits an instructive and helpful analogy; but that is all. The sexual act presents many characters which are absent in an ordinary act of evacuation, and, on the other hand, it lacks the special characteristic of the evacuation proper, the elimination of waste material; the seminal fluid is not a waste material, and its retention is, to some extent perhaps, rather an advantage than a disadvantage to the organism.  Eduard von Hartmann long since remarked that the satisfaction of what we call the sexual instinct through an act carried out with a person of the opposite sex is a very wonderful phenomenon. It cannot be said, however, that the conception of the sexual act as a simple process of evacuation does anything to explain the wonder. We are, at most, in the same position as regards the stilling of normal sexual desire as we should be as regards the emptying of the bladder, supposing it were very difficult for either sex to effect this satisfactorily without the aid of a portion of the body of a person of the other sex acting as a catheter. In such a case our thoughts and ideals would center around persons of opposite sex, and we should court their attention and help precisely as we do now in the case of our sexual needs. Some such relationship does actually exist in the case of the suckling mother and her infant. The mother is indebted to the child for the pleasurable relief of her distended breasts; and, while in civilization more subtle pleasures and intelligent reflection render this massive physical satisfaction comparatively unessential to the act of suckling, in more primitive conditions and among animals the need of this pleasurable physical satisfaction is a real bond between the mother and her offspring. The analogy is indeed very close: the erectile nipple corresponds to the erectile penis, the eager watery mouth of the infant to the moist and throbbing vagina, the vitally albuminous milk to the vitally albuminous semen.[17] The complete mutual satisfaction, physical and psychic, of mother and child, in the transfer from one to the other of a precious organized fluid, is the one true physiological analogy to the relationship of a man and a woman at the climax of the sexual act. Even this close analogy, however, fails to cover all the facts of the sexual life.  A very different view is presented to us in the definition of the sexual instinct as a reproductive impulse, a desire for offspring. Hegar, Eulenburg, Näcke, and Löwenfeld have accepted this as, at all events, a partial definition.[18] No one, indeed, would argue that it is a complete definition, although a few writers appear to have asserted that it is so sometimes as regards the sexual impulse in women. There is, however, considerable mental confusion in the attempt to set up such a definition. If we define an instinct as an action adapted to an end which is not present to consciousness, then it is quite true that the sexual instinct is an instinct of reproduction. But we do not adequately define the sexual instinct by merely stating its ultimate object. We might as well say that the impulse by which young animals seize food is \"an instinct of nutrition.\" The object of reproduction certainly constitutes no part of the sexual impulse whatever in any animal apart from man, and it reveals a lack of the most elementary sense of biological continuity to assert that in man so fundamental and involuntary a process can suddenly be revolutionized. That the sexual impulse is very often associated with a strong desire for offspring there can be no doubt, and in women the longing for a child--that is to say, the longing to fulfill those functions for which their bodies are constituted--may become so urgent and imperative that we may regard it as scarcely less imperative than the sexual impulse. But it is not the sexual impulse, though intimately associated with it, and though it explains it. A reproductive instinct might be found in parthenogenetic animals, but would be meaningless, because useless, in organisms propagating by sexual union. A woman may not want a lover, but may yet want a child. This merely means that her maternal instincts have been aroused, while her sexual instincts are still latent. A desire for reproduction, as soon as that desire becomes instinctive, necessarily takes on the form of the sexual impulse, for there is no other instinctive mechanism by which it can possibly express itself. A \"reproductive instinct,\" apart from the sexual instinct and apart from the maternal instinct, cannot be admitted; it would be an absurdity. Even in women in whom the maternal instincts are strong, it may generally be observed that, although before a woman is in love, and also during the later stages of her love, the conscious desire for a child may be strong, during the time when sexual passion is at its highest the thought of offspring, under normally happy conditions, tends to recede into the background. Reproduction is the natural end and object of the sexual instinct, but the statement that it is part of the contents of the sexual impulse, or can in any way be used to define that impulse, must be dismissed as altogether inacceptable. Indeed, although the term \"reproductive instinct\" is frequently used, it is seldom used in a sense that we need take seriously; it is vaguely employed as a euphemism by those who wish to veil the facts of the sexual life; it is more precisely employed mainly by those who are unconsciously dominated by a superstitious repugnance to sex.  I now turn to a very much more serious and elaborate attempt to define the constitution of the sexual impulse, that of Moll. He finds that it is made up of two separate components, each of which may be looked upon as an uncontrollable impulse.[19] One of these is that by which the tension of the sexual organs is spasmodically relieved; this he calls the _impulse of detumescence_,[20] and he regards it as primary, resembling the impulse to empty a full bladder. The other impulse is the \"instinct to approach, touch, and kiss another person, usually of the opposite sex\"; this he terms the _impulse of contrectation_, and he includes under this head not only the tendency to general physical contact, but also the psychic inclination to become generally interested in a person of the opposite sex. Each of these primary impulses Moll regards as forming a constituent of the sexual instinct in both men and women. It seems to me undoubtedly true that these two impulses do correspond to the essential phenomena. The awkward and unsatisfactory part of Moll's analysis is the relation of the one to the other. It is true that he traces both impulses back to the sexual glands, that of detumescence directly, that of contrectation indirectly; but evidently he does not regard them as intimately related to each other; he insists on the fact that they may exist apart from each other, that they do not appear synchronously in youth: the contrectation impulse he regards as secondary; it is, he states, an indirect result of the sexual glands, \"only to be understood by the developmental history of these glands and the object which they subserve\"; that is to say, that it is connected with the rise of the sexual method of reproduction and the desirability of the mingling of the two sexes in procreation, while the impulse of detumescence arose before the sexual method of reproduction had appeared; thus the contrectation impulse was propagated by natural selection together with the sexual method of reproduction. The impulse of contrectation is secondary, and Moll even regards it as a secondary sexual character.  While, therefore, this analysis seems to include all the phenomena and to be worthy of very careful study as a serious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#6)"],["body","elaborate attempt to present an adequate psychological definition of the sexual impulse, it scarcely seems to me that we can accept it in precisely the form in which Moll presents it. I believe, however, that by analyzing the process a little more minutely we shall find that these two constituents of the sexual impulse are really much more intimately associated than at the first glance appears, and that we need by no means go back to the time when the sexual method of reproduction arose to explain the significance of the phenomena which Moll includes under the term contrectation.  To discover the true significance of the phenomena in men it is necessary to observe carefully the phenomena of love-making not only among men, but among animals, in which the impulse of contrectation plays a very large part, and involves an enormous expenditure of energy. Darwin was the first to present a comprehensive view of, at all events a certain group of, the phenomena of contrectation in animals; on his interpretation of those phenomena he founded his famous theory of sexual selection. We are not primarily concerned with that theory; but the facts on which Darwin based his theory lie at the very roots of our subject, and we are bound to consider their psychological significance. In the first place, since these phenomena are specially associated with Darwin's name, it may not be out of place to ask what Darwin himself considered to be their psychological significance. It is a somewhat important question, even for those who are mainly concerned with the validity of the theory which Darwin established on those facts, but so far as I know it has not hitherto been asked. I find that a careful perusal of the _Descent of Man_ reveals the presence in Darwin's mind of two quite distinct theories, neither of them fully developed, as to the psychological meaning of the facts he was collecting. The two following groups of extracts will serve to show this very conclusively: \"The lower animals have a sense of beauty,\" he declares, \"powers of discrimination and taste on the part of the female\" (p. 211[21]); \"the females habitually or occasionally prefer the more beautiful males,\" \"there is little improbability in the females of insects appreciating beauty in form or color\" (p. 329); he speaks of birds as the most \"esthetic\" of all animals excepting man, and adds that they have \"nearly the same taste for the beautiful as we have\" (p. 359); he remarks that a change of any kind in the structure or color of the male bird \"appears to have been admired by the female\" (p. 385). He speaks of the female Argus pheasant as possessing \"this almost human degree of taste.\" Birds, again, \"seem to have some taste for the beautiful both in color and sound,\" and \"we ought not to feel too sure that the female does not attend to each detail of beauty\" (p. 421). Novelty, he says, is \"admired by birds for its own sake\" (p. 495). \"Birds have fine powers of discrimination and in some few instances it can be shown that they have a taste for the beautiful\" (p. 496). The \"esthetic capacity\" of female animals has been advanced by exercise just as our own taste has improved (p. 616). On the other hand, we find running throughout the book quite another idea. Of cicadas he tells us that it is probable that, \"like female birds, they are excited or allured by the male with the most attractive voice\" (p. 282); and, coming to _Locustidæ_, he states that \"all observers agree that the sounds serve either to call or excite the mute females\" (p. 283). Of birds he says, \"I am led to believe that the females prefer or are most excited by the more brilliant males\" (p. 316). Among birds also the males \"endeavor to charm or excite their mates by love-notes,\" etc., and \"the females are excited by certain males, and thus unconsciously prefer them\" (p. 367), while ornaments of all kinds \"apparently serve to excite, attract, or fascinate the female\" (p. 394). In a supplemental note, also, written in 1876, five years after the first publication of the _Descent of Man_, and therefore a late statement of his views, Darwin remarks that \"no supporter of the principle of sexual selection believes that the females select particular points of beauty in the males; they are merely excited or attracted in a greater degree by one male than by another, and this seems often to depend, especially with birds, on brilliant coloring\" (p. 623). Thus, on the one hand, Darwin interprets the phenomena as involving a real esthetic element, a taste for the beautiful; on the other hand, he states, without apparently any clear perception that the two views are quite distinct, that the colors and sounds and other characteristics of the male are not an appeal to any esthetic sense of the female, but an appeal to her sexual emotions, a stimulus to sexual excitement, an allurement to sexual contact. According to the first theory, the female admires beauty, consciously or unconsciously, and selects the most beautiful partner[22]; according to the second theory, there is no esthetic question involved, but the female is unconsciously influenced by the most powerful or complex organic stimulus to which she is subjected. There can be no question that it is the second, and not the first, of these two views which we are justified in accepting. Darwin, it must be remembered, was not a psychologist, and he lived before the methods of comparative psychology had begun to be developed; had he written twenty years later we may be sure he would never have used so incautiously some of the vague and hazardous expressions I have quoted. He certainly injured his theory of sexual selection by stating it in too anthropomorphic language, by insisting on \"choice,\" \"preference,\" \"esthetic sense,\" etc. There is no need whatever to burden any statement of the actual facts by such terms borrowed from human psychology. The female responds to the stimulation of the male at the right moment just as the tree responds to the stimulation of the warmest days in spring. We should but obscure this fact by stating that the tree \"chooses\" the most beautiful days on which to put forth its young sprouts. In explaining the correlation between responsive females and accomplished males the supposition of esthetic choice is equally unnecessary. It is, however, interesting to observe that, though Darwin failed to see that the love-combats, pursuits, dances, and parades of the males served as a method of stimulating the impulse of contrectation--or, as it would be better to term it, tumescence--in the male himself,[23] he to some extent realized the part thus played in exciting the equally necessary activity of tumescence in the female.      The justification for using the term \"tumescence,\" which I here     propose, is to be found in the fact that vascular congestion,     more especially of the parts related to generation, is an     essential preliminary to acute sexual desire. This is clearly     brought out in Heape's careful study of the \"sexual season\" in     mammals. Heape distinguishes between the \"pro-estrum,\" or     preliminary period of congestion, in female animals and the     immediately following \"estrus,\" or period of desire. The latter     period is the result of the former, and, among the lower animals     at all events, intercourse only takes place during the estrus,     not during the pro-estrum. Tumescence must thus be obtained     before desire can become acute, and courtship runs _pari passu_     with physiological processes. \"Normal estrus,\" Heape states,     \"occurs in conjunction with certain changes in the uterine     tissue, and this is accompanied by congestion and stimulation or     irritation of the copulatory organs.... Congestion is invariably     present and is an essential condition.... The first sign of     pro-estrum noticed in the lower mammals is a swollen and     congested vulva and a general restlessness, excitement, or     uneasiness. There are other signs familiar to breeders of various     mammals, such as the congested conjunctiva of the rabbit's eye     and the drooping ears of the pig. Many monkeys exhibit congestion     of the face and nipples, as well as of the buttocks, thighs, and     neighboring parts; sometimes they are congested to a very marked     extent, and in some species a swelling, occasionally prodigious,     of the soft tissues round the anal and generative openings, which     is also at the time brilliantly congested, indicates the progress     of the pro-estrum.... The growth of the stroma-tissue [in the     uterus of monkeys during the pro-estrum] is rapidly followed by     an increase in the number and size of the vessels of the stroma;     the whole becomes richly supplied with blood, and the surface is     flushed and highly vascular. This process goes on until the whole     of the internal stroma becomes tense and brilliantly injected     with blood.... In all essential points the menstruation or     pro-estrum of the human female is identical with that of     monkeys.... Estrus is possible only after the changes due to     pro-estrum have taken place in the uterus. A wave of disturbance,     at first evident in the external generative organs, extends to     the uterus, and after the various phases of pro-estrum have been     gone through in that organ, and the excitement there is     subsiding, it would seem as if the external organs gain renewed     stimulus, and it is then that estrus takes place.... In all     animals which have been investigated coition is not allowed by     the female until some time after the swelling and congestion of     the vulva and surrounding tissue are first demonstrated, and in     those animals which suffer from a considerable discharge of blood     the main portion of that discharge, if not the whole of it, will     be evacuated before sexual intercourse is allowed.\" (W. Heape,     \"The 'Sexual Season' of Mammals,\" _Quarterly Journal of     Microscopical"]]]
