A man's sexual nature, like all else that is most essential in him, is rooted in a soil that was formed very long before his birth. In this, as in every other respect, he draws the elements of his life from his ancestors, however new the recombination may be and however greatly it may be modified by subsequent conditions. A man's destiny stands not in the future but in the past. That, rightly considered, is the most vital of all vital facts. Every child thus has a right to choose his own ancestors. Naturally he can only do this vicariously, through his parents. It is the most serious and sacred duty of the future father to choose one half of the ancestral and hereditary character of his future child; it is the most serious and sacred duty of the future mother to make a similar choice.[1] In choosing each other they have between them chosen the whole ancestry of their child. They have determined the stars that will rule his fate.  In the past that fateful determination has usually been made helplessly, ignorantly, almost unconsciously. It has either been guided by an instinct which, on the whole, has worked out fairly well, or controlled by economic interests of the results of which so much cannot be said, or left to the risks of lower than bestial chances which can produce nothing but evil. In the future we cannot but have faith--for all the hope of humanity must rest on that faith--that a new guiding impulse, reinforcing natural instinct and becoming in time an inseparable accompaniment of it, will lead civilized man on his racial course. Just as in the past the race has, on the whole, been moulded by a natural, and in part sexual, selection, that was unconscious of itself and ignorant of the ends it made towards, so in the future the race will be moulded by deliberate selection, the creative energy of Nature becoming self-conscious in the civilized brain of man. This is not a faith which has its source in a vague hope. The problems of the individual life are linked on to the fate of the racial life, and again and again we shall find as we ponder the individual questions we are here concerned with, that at all points they ultimately converge towards this same racial end.  Since we have here, therefore, to follow out the sexual relationships of the individual as they bear on society, it will be convenient at this point to put aside the questions of ancestry and to accept the individual as, with hereditary constitution already determined, he lies in his mother's womb.  It is the mother who is the child's supreme parent. At various points in zoölogical evolution it has seemed possible that the functions that we now know as those of maternity would be largely and even equally shared by the male parent. Nature has tried various experiments in this direction, among the fishes, for instance, and even among birds. But reasonable and excellent as these experiments were, and though they were sufficiently sound to secure their perpetuation unto this day, it remains true that it was not along these lines that Man was destined to emerge. Among all the mammal predecessors of Man, the male is an imposing and important figure in the early days of courtship, but after conception has once been secured the mother plays the chief part in the racial life. The male must be content to forage abroad and stand on guard when at home in the ante-chamber of the family. When she has once been impregnated the female animal angrily rejects the caresses she had welcomed so coquettishly before, and even in Man the place of the father at the birth of his child is not a notably dignified or comfortable one. Nature accords the male but a secondary and comparatively humble place in the home, the breeding-place of the race; he may compensate himself if he will, by seeking adventure and renown in the world outside. The mother is the child's supreme parent, and during the period from conception to birth the hygiene of the future man can only be affected by influences which work through her.  Fundamental and elementary as is the fact of the predominant position of the mother in relation to the life of the race, incontestable as it must seem to all those who have traversed the volumes of these _Studies_ up to the present point, it must be admitted that it has sometimes been forgotten or ignored. In the great ages of humanity it has indeed been accepted as a central and sacred fact. In classic Rome at one period the house of the pregnant woman was adorned with garlands, and in Athens it was an inviolable sanctuary where even the criminal might find shelter. Even amid the mixed influences of the exuberantly vital times which preceded the outburst of the Renaissance, the ideally beautiful woman, as pictures still show, was the pregnant woman. But it has not always been so. At the present time, for instance, there can be no doubt that we are but beginning to emerge from a period during which this fact was often disputed and denied, both in theory and in practice, even by women themselves. This was notably the case both in England and America, and it is probably owing in large part to the unfortunate infatuation which led women in these lands to follow after masculine ideals that at the present moment the inspirations of progress in women's movements come mainly to-day from the women of other lands. Motherhood and the future of the race were systematically belittled. Paternity is but a mere incident, it was argued, in man's life: why should maternity be more than a mere incident in woman's life? In England, by a curiously perverted form of sexual attraction, women were so fascinated by the glamour that surrounded men that they desired to suppress or forget all the facts of organic constitution which made them unlike men, counting their glory as their shame, and sought the same"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13615"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 6 (#3)"],["body","as men, the same occupations as men, even the same sports. As we know, there was at the origin an element of rightness in this impulse.[2] It was absolutely right in so far as it was a claim for freedom from artificial restriction, and a demand for economic independence. But it became mischievous and absurd when it developed into a passion for doing, in all respects, the same things as men do; how mischievous and how absurd we may realize if we imagine men developing a passion to imitate the ways and avocations of women. Freedom is only good when it is a freedom to follow the laws of one's own nature; it ceases to be freedom when it becomes a slavish attempt to imitate others, and would be disastrous if it could be successful.[3]  At the present day this movement on the theoretical side has ceased to possess any representatives who exert serious influence. Yet its practical results are still prominently exhibited in England and the other countries in which it has been felt. Infantile mortality is enormous, and in England at all events is only beginning to show a tendency to diminish; motherhood is without dignity, and the vitality of mothers is speedily crushed, so that often they cannot so much as suckle their infants; ignorant girl-mothers give their infants potatoes and gin; on every hand we are told of the evidence of degeneracy in the race, or if not in the race, at all events, in the young individuals of to-day.      It would be out of place, and would lead us too far, to discuss     here these various practical outcomes of the foolish attempt to     belittle the immense racial importance of motherhood. It is     enough here to touch on the one point of the excess of infantile     mortality.      In England--which is not from the social point of view in a very     much worse condition than most countries, for in Austria and     Russia the infant mortality is higher still, though in Australia     and New Zealand much lower, but still excessive--more than     one-fourth of the total number of deaths every year is of infants     under one year of age. In the opinion of medical officers of     health who are in the best position to form an opinion, about     one-half of this mortality, roughly speaking, is absolutely     preventable. Moreover, it is doubtful whether there is any real     movement of decrease in this mortality; during the past half     century it has sometimes slightly risen and sometimes slightly     fallen, and though during the past few years the general movement     of mortality for children under five in England and Wales has     shown a tendency to decrease, in London (according to J.F.J.     Sykes, although Sir Shirley Murphy has attempted to minimize the     significance of these figures) the infantile mortality rate for     the first three months of life actually rose from 69 per 1,000 in     the period 1888-1892 to 75 per 1,000 in the period 1898-1901.     (This refers, it must be remembered, to the period before the     introduction of the Notification of Births Act.) In any case,     although the general mortality shows a marked tendency to     improvement there is certainly no adequately corresponding     improvement in the infantile mortality. This is scarcely     surprising, when we realize that there has been no change for the     better, but rather for the worse, in the conditions under which     our infants are born and reared. Thus William Hall, who has had     an intimate knowledge extending over fifty-six years of the slums     of Leeds, and has weighed and measured many thousands of slum     children, besides examining over 120,000 boys and girls as to     their fitness for factory labor, states (_British Medical     Journal_, October 14, 1905) that \"fifty years ago the slum mother     was much more sober, cleanly, domestic, and motherly than she is     to-day; she was herself better nourished and she almost always     suckled her children, and after weaning they received more     nutritious bone-making food, and she was able to prepare more     wholesome food at home.\" The system of compulsory education has     had an unfortunate influence in exerting a strain on the parents     and worsening the conditions of the home. For, excellent as     education is in itself, it is not the primary need of life, and     has been made compulsory before the more essential things of life     have been made equally compulsory. How absolutely unnecessary     this great mortality is may be shown, without evoking the good     example of Australia and New Zealand, by merely comparing small     English towns; thus while in Guildford the infantile death rate     is 65 per thousand, in Burslem it is 205 per thousand.      It is sometimes said that infantile mortality is an economic     question, and that with improvement in wages it would cease. This     is only true to a limited extent and under certain conditions. In     Australia there is no grinding poverty, but the deaths of infants     under one year of age are still between 80 and 90 per thousand,     and one-third of this mortality, according to Hooper (_British     Medical Journal_, 1908, vol. ii, p. 289), being due to the     ignorance of mothers and the dislike to suckling, is easily     preventable. The employment of married women greatly diminishes     the poverty of a family, but nothing can be worse for the welfare     of the woman as mother, or for the welfare of her child. Reid,     the medical officer of health for Staffordshire, where there are     two large centres of artisan population with identical health     conditions, has shown that in the northern centre, where a very     large number of women are engaged in factories, still-births are     three times as frequent as in the southern centre, where there     are practically no trade employments for women; the frequency of     abnormalities is also in the same ratio. The superiority of     Jewish over Christian children, again, and their lower infantile     mortality, seem to be entirely due to the fact that Jewesses are     better mothers. \"The Jewish children in the slums,\" says William     Hall (_British Medical Journal_, October 14, 1905), speaking from     wide and accurate knowledge, \"were superior in weight, in teeth,     and in general bodily development, and they seemed less     susceptible to infectious disease. Yet these Jews were     overcrowded, they took little exercise, and their unsanitary     environment was obvious. The fact was, their children were much     better nourished. The pregnant Jewess was more cared for, and no     doubt supplied better nutriment to the foetus. After the children     were born 90 per cent. received breast-milk, and during later     childhood they were abundantly fed on bone-making material; eggs     and oil, fish, fresh vegetables, and fruit entered largely into     their diet.\" G. Newman, in his important and comprehensive book     on _Infant Mortality_, emphasizes the conclusion that \"first of     all we need a higher standard of physical motherhood.\" The     problem of infantile mortality, he declares (page 259), is not     one of sanitation alone, or housing, or indeed of poverty as     such, \"_but is mainly a question of motherhood_.\"  The fundamental need of the pregnant woman is _rest_. Without a large degree of maternal rest there can be no puericulture.[4] The task of creating a man needs the whole of a woman's best energies, more especially during the three months before birth. It cannot be subordinated to the tax on strength involved by manual or mental labor, or even strenuous social duties and amusements. The numerous experiments and observations which have been made during recent years in Maternity Hospitals, more especially in France, have shown conclusively that not only the present and future well-being of the mother and the ease of her confinement, but the fate of the child, are immensely influenced by rest during the last month of pregnancy. \"Every working woman is entitled to rest during the last three months of her pregnancy.\" This formula was adopted by the International Congress of Hygiene in 1900, but it cannot be practically carried out except by the coöperation of the whole community. For it is not enough to say that a woman ought to rest during pregnancy; it is the business of the community to ensure that that rest is duly secured. The woman herself, and her employer, we may be certain, will do their best to cheat the community, but it is the community which suffers, both economically and morally, when a woman casts her inferior children into the world, and in its own interests the community is forced to control both employer and employed. We can no longer allow it to be said, in Bouchacourt's words, that \"to-day the dregs of the human species--the blind, the deaf-mute, the degenerate, the nervous, the vicious, the idiotic, the imbecile, the cretins and epileptics--are better protected than pregnant women.\"[5]      Pinard, who must always be honored as one of the founders of     eugenics, has, together with his pupils, done much to prepare the     way for the acceptance of this simple but important principle by     making clear the grounds on which it is based. From prolonged     observations on the pregnant women of all classes Pinard has     shown conclusively that women who rest during pregnancy have     finer children than women who do not rest. Apart from the more     general evils of work during pregnancy, Pinard found that during     the later months it had a tendency to press the uterus down into     the pelvis, and so cause the premature birth of undeveloped     children, while labor was rendered more difficult and dangerous     (see, e.g., Pinard, _Gazette des Hôpitaux_, Nov. 28, 1895, Id.,     _Annales de Gynécologie_, Aug., 1898).      Letourneux has studied the question whether repose during     pregnancy is necessary for women whose professional work is only     slightly"]]]
