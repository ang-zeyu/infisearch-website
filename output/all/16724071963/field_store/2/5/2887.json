Each outbreak of violent American controversy produced a British comment sympathetic with the North. The turmoil preceding and following the election of Lincoln in 1860, on the platform of \"no extension of slavery,\" was very generally noted by the British press and public, as a sign favourable to the cause of anti-slavery, but with no understanding that Southern threat would at last be realized in definite action. Herbert Spencer, in a letter of May 15, 1862, to his American friend, Yeomans, wrote, \"As far as I had the means of judging, the feeling here was at first _very decidedly_ on the side of the North[34] ...\" The British metropolitan press, in nearly every issue of which for at least two years after December, 1860, there appeared news items and editorial comment on the American crisis, was at first nearly unanimous in condemning the South[35]. The _Times_, with accustomed vigour, led the field. On November 21, 1860, it stated:       \"When we read the speech of Mr. Lincoln on the subject of      Slavery and consider the extreme moderation of the sentiments      it expresses, the allowance that is made for the situation,      for the feelings, for the prejudices, of the South; when we      see how entirely he narrows his opposition to the single      point of the admission of Slavery into the Territories, we      cannot help being forcibly struck by the absurdity of      breaking up a vast and glorious confederacy like that of the      United States from the dread and anger inspired by the      election of such a man to the office of Chief Magistrate....      We rejoice, on higher and surer grounds, that it [the      election] has ended in the return of Mr. Lincoln. We are glad      to think that the march of Slavery, and the domineering tone      which its advocates were beginning to assume over Freedom,      has been at length arrested and silenced. We rejoice that a      vast community of our own race has at length given an      authoritative expression to sentiments which are entertained      by everyone in this country. We trust to see the American      Government employed in tasks more worthy of a State founded      on the doctrines of liberty and equality than the invention      of shifts and devices to perpetuate servitude; and we hear in      this great protest of American freedom the tardy echo of      those humane doctrines to which England has so long become a      convert.\"  Other leading journals, though with less of patronizing self-complacency, struck the same note as the _Times_. The _Economist_ attributed Lincoln's election to a shift in the sympathies of the \"lower orders\" in the electorate who had now deserted their former leaders, the slave-owning aristocracy of the South, and allied themselves with the refined and wise leaders of the North. Lincoln, it argued, was not an extremist in any sense. His plan of action lay within the limits of statesmanlike moderation[36]. The _Saturday Review_ was less sure that England should rejoice with the North. British self-esteem had suffered some hard blows at the hands of the Democratic party in America, but at least England knew where Democrats stood, and could count on no more discourtesy or injustice than that inflicted in the past. The Republican party, however, had no policy, except that of its leader, Seward, and from him might be expected extreme insolence[37]. This was a very early judgment of Seward, and one upon which the _Saturday Review_ preened itself later, as wholly justified. The _Spectator_, the only one of the four journals thus far considered which ultimately remained constant in advocacy of the Northern cause, was at first lukewarm in comment, regarding the 1860 election, while fought on the slavery issue, as in reality a mere contest between parties for political power[38].  Such was the initial attitude of the English press. Each press issue for several weeks harped on the same chord, though sounding varying notes. If the South really means forcible resistance, said the _Times_, it is doomed to quick suppression. \"A few hundred thousand slave-owners, trembling nightly with visions of murder and pillage, backed by a dissolute population of 'poor whites,' are no match for the hardy and resolute populations of the Free States[39],\" and if the South hoped for foreign aid it should be undeceived promptly: \"Can any sane man believe that England and France will consent, as is now suggested, to stultify the policy of half a century for the sake of an extended cotton trade, and to purchase the favours of Charleston and Milledgeville by recognizing what has been called 'the isothermal law, which impels African labour toward the tropics' on the other side of the Atlantic[40]?\" Moreover all Americans ought to understand clearly that British respect for the United States \"was not due to the attitude of the South with its ruffian demonstrations in Congress.... All that is noble and venerable in the United States is associated with its Federal Constitution[41].\"  Did the British public hold these same opinions? There is no direct evidence available in sufficient quantity in autobiography or letters upon which to base a conclusion. Such works are silent on the struggle in America for the first few months and presumably public opinion, less informed even than the press, received its impressions from the journals customarily read. Both at this period and all through the war, also, it should be remembered, clearly, that most newspapers, all the reviews, in fact nearly all vehicles of British expression, were in the early 'sixties \"in the hands of the educated classes, and these educated classes corresponded closely with the privileged classes.\" The more democratic element of British Society lacked any adequate press representation of its opinions. \"This body could express itself by such comparatively crude methods as public meetings and demonstrations, but it was hampered in literary and political expression[42].\" The opinion of the press was then, presumably, the opinion of the majority of the educated British public.  Thus British comment on America took the form, at first of moralizations, now severe toward the South, now indifferent, yet very generally asserting the essential justice of the Northern position. But it was early evident that the newspapers, one and all, were quite unprepared for the determined front soon put up by South Carolina and other Southern States. Surprised by the violence of Southern declarations, the only explanation found by the British press was that political control had been seized by the uneducated and lawless element. The _Times_ characterized this element of the South as in a state of deplorable ignorance comparable with that of the Irish peasantry, a \"poor, proud, lazy, excitable and violent class, ever ready with knife and revolver[43].\" The fate of the Union, according to the _Saturday Review_, was in the hands of the \"most ignorant, most unscrupulous, and most lawless [class] in the world--the poor or mean whites of the Slave States[44].\" Like judgments were expressed by the _Economist_ and, more mildly, by the _Spectator_[45]. Subsequently some of these journals found difficulty in this connection, in swinging round the circle to expressions of admiration for the wise and powerful aristocracy of the South; but all, especially the _Times_, were skilled by long practice in the journalistic art of facing about while claiming perfect consistency. In denial of a Southern right of secession, also, they were nearly a unit[46], though the _Saturday Review_ argued the case for the South, making a pointed parallel between the present situation and that of the American Colonies in seceding from England[47].  The quotations thus far made exhibit for the leading papers an initial confusion and ignorance difficult to harmonize with the theory of an \"enlightened press.\" The Reviews, by the conditions of publication, came into action more slowly and during 1860 there appeared but one article, in the _Edinburgh Review_, giving any adequate idea of what was really taking place in America[48]. The lesser British papers generally followed the tone of the leading journals, but without either great interest or much acumen. In truth the depth of British newspaper ignorance, considering their positiveness of utterance, appears utterly astonishing if regarded from the view-point of modern historical knowledge. But is this, after all, a matter for surprise? Was there not equal confusion at least, possibly equal ignorance, in America itself, certainly among the press and people of the Northern States? They also had come by experience to discount Southern threats, and were slow to understand that the great conflict of ideals and interests was at last begun.  The British press both influenced and reflected educated class opinion, and, in some degree, official opinion as well. Lord John Russell at the Foreign Office and Lord Lyons, British Minister at Washington, were exchanging anxious letters, and the latter was sending home reports remarkable for their clear analysis of the American controversy. Yet even he was slow to appreciate the inevitability of secession.

To GEORGE MAIR     PREFACE   John Gay was a considerable figure in the literary and social circles of his day. He was loved by Pope; Swift cared for him more than for any other man, and the letter in which Pope conveyed to him the sad tidings of Gay's death bears the endorsement: \"On my dear friend Mr. Gay's death. Received December 15th [1732], but not read till the 20th, by an impulse foreboding some misfortune.\" Gay was on intimate terms with Arbuthnot and Lord Burlington, and Henrietta Howard, Lady Suffolk, was devoted to him and consulted him in the matter of her matrimonial troubles. He was the _protégé_ of the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry. His \"Fables\" and \"The Beggar's Opera\" have become classics; his play \"Polly\" made history. Though he persistently regarded himself as neglected by the gods, it is nevertheless a fact that the fates were unusually kind to him. A Cabinet Minister made him a present of South Sea stock; Walpole appointed him a Commissioner of Lotteries; he was granted an apartment in Whitehall; Queen Caroline offered him a sinecure post in her Household. Because he thought Gay ill-used, the greatest man of letters of the century quarrelled with Lady Suffolk; for the same reason a Duchess insulted the King and wiped the dust of the Court from her shoes, and a Duke threw up his employment under the Crown. All his friends placed their purses and their houses at Gay's disposal, and competed for the pleasure of his company. Never was there a man of letters so petted and pampered.  It is somewhat strange that there should be no biography of a man so well-known and so much beloved. It is true that no sooner was the breath out of his body than Curll published a \"Life.\" \"Curll (who is one of the new horrors of death) has been writing letters to everybody for memoirs of his (Gay's) life,\" Arbuthnot wrote to Swift, January 13th, 1733: \"I was for sending him some, which I am sure might have been made entertaining, by which I should have attained two ends at once, published truth and got a rascal whipped for it. I was over-ruled in this.\"[1] Curll obtained no assistance from Gay's friends, and his book, issued in 1733, is at once inadequate and unreliable. Of Curll, at whose hands so many of Gay's friends had suffered, the poet had written in the \"Epistle to the Right Honourable Paul Methuen, Esquire\":--    Were Prior, Congreve, Swift, and Pope unknown,   Poor slander-selling Curll would be undone.  Of some slight biographical value is the \"Account of the Life and Writings of the Author,\" prefixed to the volume of \"Plays Written by Mr. Gay,\" published 1760; but there is little fresh information in the \"Brief Memoir\" by the Rev. William (afterwards Archdeacon) Coxe, which appeared in 1797. More valuable is the biographical sketch by Gay's nephew, the Rev. Joseph Baller, prefixed to \"Gay's Chair\" (1820); but the standard authorities on Gay's life are Mr. Austin Dobson (\"Dictionary of National Biography,\" Vol. XXI., 1890) and Mr. John Underwood (\"Introductory Memoir\" to the \"Poems of John Gay\" in the \"Muses' Library,\" 1893).  Among Gay's correspondents were Pope, Swift, Lady Suffolk, Arbuthnot, the Duchess of Queensberry, Oxford, Congreve, Parnell, Cleland, Caryll and Jacob Tonson, the publisher. Unpublished letters to Caryll and Tonson, and to and from Lady Suffolk, are in the British Museum; letters which have appeared in print are to be found in the correspondence of Pope, Swift, and Lady Suffolk, in Nichols' \"Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century,\" and in the Historical Commission's Report on the MSS. of the Marquis of Bath. Biographical information is also to be found, as well as in the works mentioned above, in Gribble's \"Memorials of Barnstaple,\" Mrs. Delany's \"Autobiography,\" Hervey's \"Memoirs,\" Colley Cibber's \"Apology,\" and Spence's \"Anecdotes\"; in the works and biographies of Pope, Swift, Steele, Addison, and Aaron Hill; in contemporary publications such as \"A Key to 'The What D'ye Call It,'\" \"A Complete Key to the New Farce 'Three Hours After Marriage,'\" Joseph Gay's \"The Confederates\"; and in numerous works dealing with dramatic productions and dramatic literature. A bibliography is printed in the \"Cambridge History of English Literature\" (Vol. IX., pp. 480-481; 1912); and a more detailed bibliography is being compiled by Mr. Ernest L. Gay, Boston, Mass., U.S.A., who has informed the present writer that he \"has collected about five hundred editions of Gay's works, and also over five hundred playbills of his plays, running from the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth century.\" The most valuable criticisms of Gay as a man of letters are by Johnson in the \"Lives of the Poets\" and Thackeray in the \"English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century.\" An interesting article on Gay by Mr. H.M. Paull appeared in the _Fortnightly Review_, June, 1912.  I am much indebted for assistance given to me during the preparation of this work by Sydney Harper, Esq., of Barnstaple, the happy possessor of Gay's chair; Professor J. Douglas Brude, of the University of Tennessee; C.J. Stammers, Esq.; and Ernest L. Gay, Esq., of Boston, Mass., U.S.A. I am especially grateful to W.H. Grattan Flood, Esq., Mus.D., who has generously sent me his notes on the sources of the tunes in \"The Beggar's Opera,\" which are printed in the Appendix to this volume. The extracts from Gay's poetical works in this volume have been taken, by permission of the publishers, Messrs. George Routledge and Sons, Ltd., from the \"Poems of John Gay,\" edited by Mr. John Underwood, in \"The Muses' Library.\" Mr. John Murray has kindly allowed me to quote correspondence to and from Gay printed in the standard edition of Pope's works, edited by the late Rev. Whitwell Elwin and Professor Courthope, and published by him.  LEWIS MELVILLE. LONDON, _April_, 1921.   [Footnote 1: Swift: _Works_ (ed.

This they held until 1630, when it passed out of their hands to the Coffins.[1] Subsequently they were associated with the parish of Frittelstock, near Great Torrington. In the Parish Registers of Barnstaple the name appears from time to time: in 1544 is recorded the death of Richard Gaye, and later of John Gaye, \"gentill man,\" and Johans Gay. From other sources it is known that Richard Gay was Mayor of the town in 1533, and Anthony Gay in 1638.[2] The records of the family have not been preserved, but at some time early in the seventeenth century there was at Frittelstock one John Gay, whose second son, William, was the father of the poet.  William Gay resided at Barnstaple, and since he lived in a large house, called the Red Cross, at the corner of Joy Street, facing Holland Street, it is reasonable to assume that he"]]]
