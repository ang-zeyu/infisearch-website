The impression     thus made was so profound that it persisted throughout life and     served as the point of departure of sexual perversions, while the     contact of a dog's tongue with her mouth alone afterward sufficed     to evoke sexual pleasure. (Féré, _Archives de Neurologie_, 1903,     No. 90.)      I do not purpose to discuss here either _cunnilingus_ (the     apposition of the mouth to the female pudendum) or _fellatio_     (the apposition of the mouth to the male organ), the agent in the     former case being, in normal heterosexual relationships, a man,     in the latter a woman; they are not purely tactile phenomena, but     involve various other physical and psychic elements.     _Cunnilingus_ was a very familiar manifestation in classic times,     as shown by frequent and mostly very contemptuous references in     Aristophanes, Juvenal, and many other Greek and Roman writers;     the Greeks regarded it as a Phoenician practice, just as it is     now commonly considered French; it tends to be especially     prevalent at all periods of high civilization. _Fellatio_ has     also been equally well known, in both ancient and modern times,     especially as practiced by inverted men. It may be accepted that     both _cunnilingus_ and _fellatio_, as practiced by either sex,     are liable to occur among healthy or morbid persons, in     heterosexual or homosexual relationships. They have little     psychological significance, except to the extent that when     practiced to the exclusion of normal sexual relationships they     become perversions, and as such tend to be associated with     various degenerative conditions, although such associations are     not invariable.      The essentially normal character of _cunnilingus_ and _fellatio_,     when occurring as incidents in the process of tumescence, is     shown by the fact that they are practiced by many animals. This     is the case, for instance, among dogs. Moll points out that not     infrequently the bitch, while under the dog, but before     intromission, will change her position to lick the dog's     penis--apparently from an instinctive impulse to heighten her own     and his excitement--and then return to the normal position, while     _cunnilingus_ is of constant occurrence among animals, and on     account of its frequency among dogs was called by the Greeks     skylax (Rosenbaum, _Geschichte der Lustseuche im Altertume_,     fifth edition, pp. 260-278; also notes in Moll, _Untersuchungen     über pie Libido Sexualis_, Bd. I, pp. 134, 369; and Bloch,     _Beiträge zur Ætiologie der Psychopathia Sexualis_, Teil II, pp.     216 et seq.)      The occurrence of _cunnilingus_ as a sexual episode of tumescence     among lower human races is well illustrated by a practice of the     natives of the Caroline Islands (as recorded by Kubary in his     ethnographic study of this people and quoted by Ploss and     Bartels, _Das Weib_, vol. i). It is here customary for a man to     place a piece of fish between the labia, while he stimulates the     latter by his tongue and teeth until under stress of sexual     excitement the woman urinates; this is regarded as an indication     that the proper moment for intercourse has arrived. Such a     practice rests on physiologically sound facts whatever may be     thought of it from an æsthetic standpoint.      The contrast between the normal æsthetic standpoint in this     matter and the lover's is well illustrated by the following     quotations: Dr. A.B. Holder, in the course of his description of     the American Indian _boté_, remarks, concerning _fellatio_: \"Of     all the many varieties of sexual perversion, this, it seems to     me, is the most debased that could be conceived of.\" On the other     hand, in a communication from a writer and scholar of high     intellectual distinction occurs the statement: \"I affirm that, of     all sexual acts, _fellatio_ is most an affair of imagination and     sympathy.\" It must be pointed out that there is no contradiction     in these two statements, and that each is justified, according as     we take the point of view of the ordinary onlooker or of the     impassioned lover eager to give a final proof of his or her     devotion. It must be added that from a scientific point of view     we are not entitled to take either side.  Of the whole of this group of phenomena, the most typical and the most widespread example is certainly the kiss. We have in the lips a highly sensitive frontier region between skin and mucous membrane, in many respects analogous to the vulvo-vaginal orifice, and reinforcible, moreover, by the active movements of the still more highly sensitive tongue. Close and prolonged contact of these regions, therefore, under conditions favorable to tumescence sets up a powerful current of nervous stimulation. After those contacts in which the sexual regions themselves take a direct part, there is certainly no such channel for directing nervous force into the sexual sphere as the kiss. This is nowhere so well recognized as in France, where a young girl's lips are religiously kept for her lover, to such an extent, indeed, that young girls sometimes come to believe that the whole physical side of love is comprehended in a kiss on the mouth; so highly intelligent a woman as Madam Adam has described the agony she felt as a girl when kissed on the lips by a man, owing to the conviction that she had thereby lost her virtue. Although the lips occupy this highly important position as a secondary sexual focus in the sphere of touch, the kiss is--unlike _cunnilingus_ and _fellatio_--confined to man and, indeed, to a large extent, to civilized man. It is the outcome of a compound evolution which had its beginning outside the sphere of touch, and it would therefore be out of place to deal with the interesting question of its development in this place. It will be discussed elsewhere.[18]  There is yet another orificial frontier region which is a highly important tactile sexual focus: the nipple. The breasts raise, indeed, several interesting questions in their intimate connection with the sexual sphere and it may be worth while to consider them at this point.  The breasts have from the present point of view this special significance among the sexual centres that they primarily exist, not for the contact of the lover, but the contact of the child. This is doubtless, indeed, the fundamental fact on which all the touch contacts we are here concerned with have grown up. The sexual sensitivity of the lover's lips to orificial contacts has been developed from the sensitivity of the infant's lips to contact with his mother's nipple. It is on the ground of that evolution that we are bound to consider here the precise position of the breasts as a sexual centre.  As the great secreting organs of milk, the function of the breasts must begin immediately the child is cut off from the nutrition derived from direct contact with his mother's blood. It is therefore essential that the connection between the sexual organs proper, more especially the womb, and the breasts should be exceedingly intimate, so that the breasts may be in a condition to respond adequately to the demand of the child's sucking lips at the earliest moment after birth. As a matter of fact, this connection is very intimate, so intimate that it takes place in two totally distinct ways--by the nervous system and by the blood.      The breasts of young girls sometimes become tender at puberty in     sympathy with the evolution of the sexual organs, although the     swelling of the breasts at this period is not normally a     glandular process. At the recurring periods of menstruation,     again, sensations in the breasts are not uncommon.      It is not, however, until impregnation occurs that really     decisive changes take place in the breasts. \"As soon as the ovum     is impregnated, that is to say within a few days,\" as W.D.A.     Griffith states it (\"The Diagnosis of Pregnancy,\" _British     Medical Journal_, April 11, 1903), \"the changes begin to occur in     the breast, changes which are just as well worked out as are the     changes in the uterus and the vagina, which, from the     commencement of pregnancy, prepare for the labor which ought to     follow nine months afterward. These are changes in the direction     of marked activity of function. An organ which was previously     quite passive, without activity of circulation and the effects of     active circulation, begins to grow and continues to grow in     activity and size as pregnancy progresses.\"      The association between breasts and womb is so obvious that it     has not escaped many savage peoples, who are often, indeed,     excellent observers. Among one primitive people at least the     activity of the breast at impregnation seems to be clearly     recognized. The Sinangolo of British New Guinea, says Seligmann     (_Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, July-December, 1902,     p. 298) believe that conception takes place in the breasts; on     this account they hold that coitus should never take place before     the child is weaned or he might imbibe semen with the milk.      It is natural to assume that this connection between the activity     of the womb and the glandular activity of the breasts is a     nervous connection, by means of the spinal cord, and such a     connection certainly exists and plays a very important part in     the stimulating action of the breasts on the sexual organs. But     that there is a more direct channel of communication even than     the nervous system is shown by the fact that the secretion of     milk will take place at parturition, even when the nervous     connection has been destroyed. Mironoff found that, when the     mammary gland is completely separated from the central nervous     system, secretion,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],["title","Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#7)"],["body","slightly diminished, still continued.     In two goats he cut the nerves shortly before parturition and     after birth the breasts still swelled and functioned normally     (_Archives des Sciences Biologiques_, St. Petersburg, 1895,     summarized in _L'Année Biologique_; 1895, p. 329). Ribbert,     again, cut out the mammary gland of a young rabbit and     transplanted it into the ear; five months after the rabbit bore     young and the gland secreted milk freely. The case has been     reported of a woman whose spinal cord was destroyed by an     accident at the level of the fifth and sixth dorsal vertebræ,     yet lactation was perfectly normal (_British Medical Journal_,     August 5, 1899, p. 374). We are driven to suppose that there is     some chemical change in the blood, some internal secretion from     the uterus or the ovaries, which acts as a direct stimulant to     the breasts. (See a comprehensive discussion of the phenomena of     the connection between the breasts and sexual organs, though the     conclusions are not unassailable, by Temesvary, _Journal of     Obstetrics and Gynæcology of the British Empire_, June, 1903).     That this hypothetical secretion starts from the womb rather than     the ovaries seems to be indicated by the fact that removal of     both ovaries during pregnancy will not suffice to prevent     lactation. In favor of the ovaries, see Beatson, _Lancet_, July,     1896; in favor of the uterus, Armand Routh, \"On the Interaction     between the Ovaries and the Mammary Glands,\" _British Medical     Journal_, September 30, 1899.  While, however, the communications from the sexual organs to the breast are of a complex and at present ill understood character, the communication from the breasts to the sexual organs is without doubt mainly and chiefly nervous. When the child is put to the breast after birth the suction of the nipple causes a reflex contraction of the womb, and it is held by many, though not all, authorities that in a woman who does not suckle her child there is some risk that the womb will not return to its normal involuted size. It has also been asserted that to put a child to the breast during the early months of pregnancy causes so great a degree of uterine contraction that abortion may result.      Freund found in Germany that stimulation of the nipples by an     electrical cupping apparatus brought about contraction of the     pregnant uterus. At an earlier period it was recommended to     irritate the nipple in order to excite the uterus to parturient     action. Simpson, while pointing out that this was scarcely     adequate to produce the effect desired, thought that placing a     child to the breast after labor had begun might increase uterine     action. (J.Y. Simpson, _Obstetric Memoirs_, vol. i, p. 836; also     Féré, _L'Instinct Sexuel_, second edition, p. 132).      The influence of lactation over the womb in preventing the return     of menstruation during its continuance is well known. According     to Remfry's investigation of 900 cases in England, in 57 per     cent. of cases there is no menstruation during lactation. (L.     Remfry, in paper read before Obstetrical Society of London,     summarized in the _British Medical Journal_, January 11, 1896, p.     86). Bendix, in Germany, found among 140 cases that in about 40     per cent. there was no menstruation during lactation (paper read     before Düsseldorf meeting of the Society of German Naturalists     and Physicians, 1899). When the child is not suckled menstruation     tends to reappear about six months after parturition.      It is possible that the divergent opinions of authorities     concerning the necessarily favorable influence of lactation in     promoting the return of the womb to its normal size may be due to     a confusion of two distinct influences: the reflex action of the     nipple on the womb and the effects of prolonged glandular     secretion of the breasts in debilitated persons. The act of     suckling undoubtedly tends to promote uterine contraction, and in     healthy women during lactation the womb may even (according to     Vineberg) be temporarily reduced to a smaller size than before     impregnation, thus producing what is known as \"lactation     atrophy.\" In debilitated women, however, the strain of     milk-production may lead to general lack of muscular tone, and     involution of the womb thus be hindered rather than aided by     lactation.  On the objective side, then, the nipple is to be regarded as an erectile organ, richly supplied with nerves and vessels, which, under the stimulation of the infant's lips--or any similar compression, and even under the influence of emotion or cold,--becomes firm and projects, mainly as a result of muscular contraction; for, unlike the penis and the clitoris, the nipple contains no true erectile tissue and little capacity for vascular engorgement.[19] We must then suppose that an impetus tends to be transmitted through the spinal cord to the sexual organs, setting up a greater or less degree of nervous and muscular excitement with uterine contraction. These being the objective manifestations, what manifestations are to be noted on the subjective side?  It is a remarkable proof of the general indifference with which in Europe even the fairly constant and prominent characteristics of the psychology of women have been treated until recent times that, so far as I am aware,--though I have made no special research to this end,--no one before the end of the eighteenth century had recorded the fact that the act of suckling tends to produce in women voluptuous sexual emotions. Cabanis in 1802, in the memoir on \"Influence des Sexes\" in his _Rapports du Physique et du Moral de l'Homme_, wrote that several suckling women had told him that the child in sucking the breast made them experience a vivid sensation of pleasure, shared in some degree by the sexual organs. There can be no doubt that in healthy suckling women this phenomenon is exceedingly common, though in the absence of any methodical and precise investigation it cannot be affirmed that it is experienced by every woman in some degree, and it is highly probable that this is not the case. One lady, perfectly normal, states that she has had stronger sexual feelings in suckling her children than she has ever experienced with her husband, but that so far as possible she has tried to repress them, as she regards them as brutish under these circumstances. Many other women state generally that suckling is the most delicious physical feeling they have ever experienced. In most cases, however, it does not appear to lead to a desire for intercourse, and some of those who make this statement have no desire for coitus during lactation, though they may have strong sexual needs at other times. It is probable that this corresponds to the normal condition, and that the voluptuous sensations aroused by suckling are adequately gratified by the child. It may be added that there are probably many women who could say, with a lady quoted by Féré,[20] that the only real pleasures of sex they have ever known are those derived from their suckling infants.  It is not difficult to see why this normal association of sexual emotion with suckling should have come about. It is essential for the preservation of the lives of young mammals that the mothers should have an adequate motive in pleasurable sensation for enduring the trouble of suckling. The most obvious method for obtaining the necessary degree of pleasurable sensation lay in utilizing the reservoir of sexual emotion, with which channels of communication might already be said to be open through the action of the sexual organs on the breasts during pregnancy. The voluptuous element in suckling may thus be called a merciful provision of Nature for securing the maintenance of the child.      Cabanis seems to have realized the significance of this     connection as the basis of the sympathy between mother and child,     and more recently Lombroso and Ferrero have remarked (_La Donna     Delinquente_, p. 438) on the fact that maternal love has a sexual     basis in the element of venereal pleasure, though usually     inconsiderable, experienced during suckling. Houzeau has referred     to the fact that in the majority of animals the relation between     mother and offspring is only close during the period of     lactation, and this is certainly connected with the fact that it     is only during lactation that the female animal can derive     physical gratification from her offspring. When living on a farm     I have ascertained that cows sometimes, though not frequently,     exhibit slight signs of sexual excitement, with secretion of     mucus, while being milked; so that, as the dairymaid herself     observed, it is as if they were being \"bulled.\" The sow, like     some other mammals, often eats her own young after birth,     mistaking them, it is thought, for the placenta, which is     normally eaten by most mammals; it is said that the sow never     eats her young when they have once taken the teat.      It occasionally happens that this normal tendency for suckling to     produce voluptuous sexual emotions is present in an extreme     degree, and may lead to sexual perversions. It does not appear     that the sexual sensations aroused by suckling usually culminate     in the orgasm; this however, was noted in a case recorded by     Féré, of a slightly neurotic woman in whom intense sexual     excitement occurred during suckling, especially if prolonged; so     far as possible, she shortened the periods of suckling in order     to prevent, not always successfully, the occurrence of the orgasm     (Féré, _Archives de Neurologie_ No. 30, 1903). Icard refers to     the case of a woman who sought to become pregnant solely for the     sake of the voluptuous sensations she derived from suckling, and     Yellowlees (Art. \"Masturbation,\" _Dictionary"]]]
