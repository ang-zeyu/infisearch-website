Yours truly,  L. V. BEETHOVEN.   241.  TO ZMESKALL.  Sept. 11, 1817.  DEAR Z.,--  The answer from London arrived yesterday [see No. 236], but in English. Do you know any one who could translate it verbally for us? In haste,  Your  BEETHOVEN.   242.  TO ZMESKALL.  Oct. 20, 1817.  DEAR Z.,--  The devil himself cannot persuade your _Famulus_ to take away the wine. Pray forgive my behavior yesterday; I intended to have asked your pardon this very afternoon. _In my present condition_ I require _indulgence_ from every one, for I am a poor unfortunate creature!  In haste, as ever, yours.   243.  TO ZMESKALL.  DEAR Z.,--  I give up the journey; at least I will not pledge myself on this point. The matter must be more maturely considered. In the mean time the work is already sent off to the Prince Regent. _If they want me they can have me_, and I am still at _liberty_ to say _yes_! or _no_! Liberty!!!! what more can any one desire!!!   244.  TO ZMESKALL.  DEAR Z.,--  Don't be angry about my note. Are you not aware of my present condition, which is like that of Hercules with Queen Omphale??? I asked you to buy me a looking-glass like yours, which I now return, but if you do not require it, I wish you would send yours back to me to-day, for mine is broken. Farewell, and do not write in such high-flown terms about me, for never have I felt so strongly as now the strength and the weakness of human nature.  Continue your regard for me.   245.  TO FRAU VON STREICHER.  The Autumn of 1817.  I have had an interview with your husband, whose sympathy did me both good and harm, for Streicher almost upset my resignation. God alone knows the result! but as I have always assisted my fellow-men when I had the power to do so, I also rely on his mercy to me.  Educate your daughter carefully, that she may make a good wife.  To-day happens to be Sunday; so I will quote you something out of the Bible,--\"Love one another.\" I conclude with best regards to your best of daughters, and with the wish that all your wounds may be healed.  When you visit the ancient ruins [Frau Streicher was in Baden], do not forget that Beethoven has often lingered there; when you stray through the silent pine forests, do not forget that Beethoven often wrote poetry there, or, as it is termed, _composed_.   246.  TO FRAU VON STREICHER.  How deeply am I indebted to you, my excellent friend, and I have become such a poor creature that I have no means of repaying you. I am very grateful to Streicher for all the trouble he has taken on my behalf [about a house in the GÃ¤rtner Strasse], and beg he will continue his inquiries. God will, I hope, one day enable me to return benefit for benefit, but this being at present impossible, grieves me most of all....  Now Heaven be praised! [he thus winds up a long letter about a bad servant,] I have contrived to collect all these particulars for you with no little toil and trouble, and God grant that I may never, never more be obliged to speak, or write, or think again on such a subject, for mud and mire are not more pernicious to artistic soil, than such devilry to any man!!!   247.  TO FRAU VON STREICHER.  As to Frau von Stein [stone], I beg she will not allow Herr von Steiner to turn into stone, that he may still be of service to me; nor must Frau von Stein become too stony towards Herr von Steiner, &c.  My good Frau von Streicher, do not play any trick [Streiche] to your worthy little husband, but rather be to all others Frau von Stein [stone]!!!!  Where are the coverlets for the beds?  [Music: Treble clef. Where? where?]   248.  TO FRAU VON STREICHER.  ... It is now very evident from all this that if _you_ do not kindly superintend things for me, I, with my _infirmities_, must meet with the _same fate_ as usual at the hands of these people. Their _ingratitude_ towards you is what chiefly degrades both of them in my eyes. But I don't understand your allusion about gossip? on one occasion alone can I remember having forgotten myself for the moment, but _with very different people_. This is all I can say on the subject. For my part I neither encourage nor listen to the gossip of the lower orders. I have often given you hints on the subject, without telling you a word of what I had heard. Away! away! away! with such things!   249.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  Nussdorf, Sept. 1, 1817.  I hope to be able to join you in Baden; but my invalid condition still continues, and though in some respects improved, my malady is far from being entirely cured. I have had, and still have, recourse to remedies of every kind and shape; I must now give up the long-cherished hope of ever being wholly restored. I hear that Y.R.H. looks wonderfully well, and though many false inferences may be drawn from this as to good health, still every one tells me that Y.R.H. is much better, and in this I feel sincerely interested. I also trust that when Y.R.H. again comes to town, I may assist you in those works dedicated to the Muses. My confidence is placed on Providence, who will vouchsafe to hear my prayer, and one day set me free from all my troubles, for I have served Him faithfully from my childhood, and done good whenever it has been in my power; so my trust is in Him alone, and I feel that the Almighty will not allow me to be utterly crushed by all my manifold trials. I wish Y.R.H. all possible good and prosperity, and shall wait on you the moment you return to town.  [K.]   250.  TO G. DEL RIO  Vienna, Nov. 12, 1817.  My altered circumstances render it possible that I may not be able to leave Carl under your care beyond the end of this quarter; so, as in duty bound, I give you this _warning_ a quarter in advance. Though it is painful to admit it, my straitened circumstances leave me no choice in the matter; had it been otherwise, how gladly would I have presented you with an additional quarter's payment when I removed Carl, as a slight tribute of my gratitude. I do hope you will believe that such are my _genuine and sincere_ wishes on the subject. If on the other hand I leave Carl with you for the ensuing quarter, commencing in February, I will apprise you of it early in January, 1818. I trust you will grant me this _favor_, and that I shall not solicit it in vain. If I ever enjoy better health, so that I can _earn more money_, I shall not fail to evince my gratitude, knowing well how much more you have done for Carl than I had any right to expect; and I can with truth say that to be obliged to confess my inability to requite your services at this moment, distresses me much.  I am, with sincere esteem, your friend,  L. V. BEETHOVEN.   251.  TO G. DEL RIO.  MY DEAR FRIEND,--  I have been hitherto unable to answer your friendly letter, having been much occupied and still far from well.  As to your proposal, it merits both gratitude and consideration. I must say that the same idea formerly occurred to me about Carl; at this moment, however, I am in the most unsettled state. This was why I made the stipulation to which I begged you to agree, namely, to let you know in the last month of the present quarter whether Carl was to continue with you. In this way our plans would neither be hurried nor demolished. I am, besides, well aware that it can be no advantage to you to have Carl either on his present terms, or according to your last proposal, and on that very account I wished to point out to you in my letter how gladly, besides the usual remuneration, I would have testified my gratitude in some additional manner.  When I spoke of my _inability_, I knew that his education would cost me even more elsewhere than with you; but what I intended to convey was that every father has a particular object in the education of his child, and it is thus with me and Carl. No doubt we shall soon discover what is best for him; whether to have a tutor here, or to go on as formerly. I do not wish to tie myself down for the moment, but to remain free to act as his interests may dictate.  Carl daily costs me great sacrifices, but I only allude to them on his own account. I know too well the influence his mother contrives to acquire over him, for she seems resolved to show herself well worthy of the name of \"Queen of the Night.\" Besides, she everywhere spreads a report that I do nothing whatever for Carl, whereas she pays everything!! As we have touched on this point, I must thank you for your most considerate letter, which in any event will be of great use to me. Pray ask Herr L.S. to be so kind as to make my excuses to his brother for not having yet called on him. Partly owing to business and also to indisposition, it has been nearly impossible for me to do so. When I think of this oft-discussed affair, I should prefer going to see him on any other subject. She has not applied to me; so it is not my business to promote a meeting between her and her son.  With regard to the other matter, I am told that in _this_ case we must have recourse to compulsion, which will cost me more money, for which I have chiefly to thank Herr Adlersburg [his advocate]. As Carl's education, however, must be carried on so far as possible independent of his mother, for the future as well as the present we must act as I have arranged.  I am, with esteem, your attached friend,  L. V. BEETHOVEN.   252.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  Last day of December, 1817.  The old year has nearly passed away, and a new one draws near. May it bring Y.R.H. no sorrow, but rather may it bestow on you every imaginable felicity! These are my wishes, all concentrated in the one I have just expressed. If it be allowable to speak of myself, I may say that my health is very variable and uncertain. I am unhappily obliged to live at a great distance from Y.R.H., which shall not, however,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13272"],["title","Beethoven's Letters 1790-1826, Volume 2 (#4)"],["body","my having the extreme gratification of waiting on you at the first opportunity. I commend myself to your gracious consideration, though I may not appear to deserve it. May Heaven, for the benefit of so many whom you befriend, enrich each day of your life with an especial blessing! I am always, &c., &c.  [K.]   253.  TO G. DEL RIO.  Jan. 6, 1818.  To prevent any mistake I take the liberty to inform you that it is finally settled my nephew Carl should leave your excellent institution the end of this month. My hands are also tied with regard to your other proposal, as if I accepted it, my further projects for Carl's benefit would be entirely frustrated; but I sincerely thank you for your kind intentions.  Circumstances may cause me to remove Carl even before the end of the month, and as I may not be here myself, I will appoint some one to fetch him. I mention this to you now, that it may not appear strange when the time comes; and let me add, that my nephew and I shall feel grateful to you through life. I observe that Carl already feels thus, which is to me a proof that although thoughtless, his disposition is not evil; far less has he a bad heart. I am the more disposed to augur well of him from his having been for two years under your admirable guidance.  I am, with esteem, your friend,  L. V. BEETHOVEN.   254.  TO G. DEL RIO.  Vienna, Jan. 24, 1818.  I do not come to you myself, as it would be a kind of leave-taking, and this I have all my life avoided. Pray accept my heartfelt thanks for the zeal, rectitude, and integrity with which you have conducted the education of my nephew. As soon as I am at all settled, we mean to pay you a visit; but on account of the mother, I am anxious that the fact of my nephew being with me should not be too much known.  I send you my very best wishes, and I beg especially to thank Frau A.Z. for her truly maternal care of Carl.  I am, with sincere esteem, yours,  L. V. BEETHOVEN.   255.  TO CZERNY.  MY DEAR GOOD KIND CZERNY,--[1]  I have this moment heard that you are in a position I really never suspected; you might certainly place confidence in me, and point out how matters could be made better for you (without any pretensions to patronage on my part). As soon as I have a moment to myself, I must speak to you. Rest assured that I highly value you, and am prepared to prove this at any moment by deeds.  Yours, with sincere esteem,  L. VAN BEETHOVEN.  [Footnote 1: Zellner, in his _BlÃ¤tter fÃ¼r Musik_, relates what follows on Czerny's own authority:--In 1818 Czerny was requested by Beethoven in a letter (which he presented some years ago to Cocks, the London music publisher) to play at one of his last concerts in the large _Redoutensaal_, his E flat major Concerto, Op. 73. Czerny answered, in accordance with the truth, that having gained his livelihood entirely for many years past by giving lessons on the piano, for more than twelve hours daily, he had so completely laid aside his pianoforte playing, that he could not venture to attempt playing the concerto properly within the course of a few days (which Beethoven desired). On which he received, in the above letter, a touching proof of Beethoven's sympathy. He also learned subsequently that Beethoven had exerted himself to procure him a permanent situation.]   256.  TO F. RIES,--LONDON.  Vienna, March 5, 1818.  MY DEAR RIES,--  In spite of my wishes it was impossible for me to go to London this year [see No. 236]. I beg you will apprise the Philharmonic Society that my feeble health prevented my coming; I trust, however, I shall be entirely restored this spring, so that in the autumn I may avail myself of their offers and fulfil all their conditions.  Pray request Neate, in my name, to make no public use of the various works of mine that he has in his hands, at least not until I come. Whatever he may have to say for himself, I have cause to complain of him.  Potter[1] called on me several times; he seems to be a worthy man, and to have a talent for composition. My wish and hope for you is that your circumstances may daily improve. I cannot, alas! say that such is the case with my own.... I cannot bear to see others want, I must give; you may therefore believe what a loser I am by this affair. I do beg that you will write to me soon. If possible I shall try to get away from this earlier, in the hope of escaping utter ruin, in which case I shall arrive in London by the winter at latest. I know that you will assist an unfortunate friend. If it had only been in my power, and had I not been chained to this place, as I always have been, by circumstances, I certainly would have done far more for you.  Farewell; remember me to Neate, Smart, and Cramer. Although I hear that the latter is a _counter subject_ both to you and to myself, still I rather understand how to manage people of that kind; so notwithstanding all this we shall yet succeed in producing an agreeable harmony in London. I embrace you from my heart. Your friend,  L. VAN BEETHOVEN.  Many handsome compliments to your charming, (and as I hear) handsome wife.  [Footnote 1: Schindler, in his _Biography_ (Vol. II. 254), states that Cipriani Potter came to Vienna in 1817.]   257.  TO THE RECHNUNGSRATH, VINCENZ HAUSCHKA.[1]  1818.  First and foremost member of our society, and grand cross of the violon--cello! You wish for an _heroic_ subject, whereas I have none but a _spiritual_ one! I am contented; still, I think an infusion of the spiritual would be quite appropriate in such a mass. I have no objections to H. v. Bernard, but you must pay him; I do not speak of myself. As you call yourselves \"Friends of Music,\" it is only natural that you should expect a great deal to be done on the score of friendship.  Now farewell, my good Hauschka! As for myself, I wander about here with music paper, among the hills and dales and valleys, and scribble a great deal to get my daily bread; for I have brought things to such a pass in this mighty and ignominious _land of the Goths and Vandals_, that in order to gain time for a great composition, I must always previously _scrawl away_ a good deal for the sake of money, to enable me to complete an important work.  However, my health is much improved, and if the matter is urgent, I can do as you wish now.  In haste, your friend,  BEETHOVEN.  [Footnote 1: Hauschka was at that time on the committee, and agent for the \"Friends to Music\" who commissioned Beethoven to write an Oratorio in 1815. Schindler is of opinion that the repeated performance of the AbbÃ© Stadler's heroic Oratorio, _Die Befreiung von Jerusalem_, was the cause of the Society in 1818 bespeaking, through Hauschka, \"An oratorio of the heroic order.\"]   258.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  1819.  I have the honor to send the masterly variations[1] of Y.R.H. by the copyist Schlemmer, and to-morrow I shall come in person to wait upon Y.R.H., and much rejoice at being able to serve as a companion to my illustrious pupil on the path of fame.  [K.]  [Footnote 1: The letters 258 and 259, allude to the pianoforte variations composed by the Archduke Rudolph and dedicated to his instructor.]   259.  TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.  Jan. 1, 1819.  All that can be comprehended in one wish, or individually named,--health, happiness, and prosperity,--all are included in the prayer I offer up for Y.R.H. on this day. May the wish that I also form for myself be graciously accepted by Y.R.H., namely, that I may continue to enjoy the favor of Y.R.H. A dreadful occurrence[1] has lately taken place in my family, which for a long time stunned my senses, and to this must be ascribed my not having waited on Y.R.H., nor taken any notice of the masterly variations of my much-honored and illustrious pupil, and favorite of the Muses. The gratitude I feel for the surprise and the honor you have done me, I dare not venture to express either verbally or in writing, for I am _too far beneath you_, even if I _could_ or wished ever so ardently _to return like for like_. May Heaven accept and listen with peculiar favor to my prayers for Y.R.H.'s health. In the course of a few days I trust I shall myself hear the masterpiece Y.R.H. has sent to me, and nothing will rejoice me more than to assist Y.R.H. as early as possible, in taking the place already prepared for you on Parnassus.  [K.]  [Footnote 1: The \"dreadful occurrence\" which took place in the end of 1818 in Beethoven's family cannot be discovered.]   260.  TO RIES.  Vienna, April [March?] 30, 1819.  DEAR RIES,--  I am only now able to answer your letter of December 18th. Your sympathy does me good. It is impossible for me to go to London at present, being involved here in various ways; but God will, I trust, aid me, and enable me to visit London next winter, when I shall bring the new symphonies with me.  I every day expect the text for a new _oratorio_, which I am to write for our Musical Society here, and no doubt it will be of use to us in London also. Do what you can on my behalf, for I greatly need it. I should have been glad to receive any commission from the Philharmonic, but Neate's report of the all but failure of the three overtures vexed me much. Each in its own style not only pleased here, but those in E flat major and C major made a profound impression, so that the fate of those works at the Philharmonic is quite incomprehensible to me.  You have no doubt received the arrangement of the Quintet [Op. 104, see No. 238] and the Sonata [Op. 106]. See that both, especially the Quintet, be engraved without loss of time. There is no such hurry about the Sonata, though I should like it to appear within two or three months. Never having received the previous letter to which you allude, I had no scruple in disposing of both works here; but for Germany only. It will be at any rate three months before the Sonata appears here, but you must make haste with the Quintet. As soon as you forward me a check for the money, I will send an authority to the publisher, securing him"]]]
