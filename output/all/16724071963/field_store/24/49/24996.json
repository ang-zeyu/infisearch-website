THE CAUSES OF SECESSION.  In preceding Chapters of this work, it has been briefly shown, that from the very hour in which the Republic of the United States was born, there have not been wanting, among its own citizens, those who hated it, and when they could not rule, were always ready to do what they could, by Conspiracy, Sedition, Mutiny, Nullification, Secession, or otherwise, to weaken and destroy it.  This fact, and the processes by which the Conspirators worked, is very well stated, in his documentary \"History of the Rebellion,\" by Edward McPherson, when he says: \"In the Slaveholding States, a considerable body of men have always been disaffected to the Union.  They resisted the adoption of the National Constitution, then sought to refine away the rights and powers of the General Government, and by artful expedients, in a series of years, using the excitements growing out of passing questions, finally perverted the sentiments of large masses of men, and prepared them for Revolution.\"  Before giving further incontestable proofs establishing this fact, and before endeavoring to sift out the true cause or causes of Secession, let us first examine such evidences as are submitted by him in support of his proposition.  The first piece of testimony, is an extract from an unpublished journal of U. S. Senator Maclay of Pennsylvania, from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1791--the period of the First Congress under the Federal Constitution. It runs thus:  \"1789, June 9.--In relation to the Tariff Bill, the affair of confining the East India Trade to the citizens of America had been negatived, and a committee had been appointed to report on this business.  The report came in with very high duties, amounting to a prohibition.  But a new phenomenon had made its appearance in the House (meaning the Senate) since Friday.  \"Pierce Butler, from South Carolina, had taken his seat, and flamed like a meteor.  He arraigned the whole Impost law, and then charged (indirectly) the whole Congress with a design of oppressing South Carolina.  He cried out for encouraging the Danes and Swedes, and foreigners of every kind, to come and take away our produce.  In fact he was for a Navigation Act reversed.  \"June 11.--Attended at the hall as usual.  \"Mr. Ralph Izard and Mr. Butler opposed the whole of the drawbacks in every shape whatever.  \"Mr. (William) Grayson, of Virginia, warm on this subject, said we were not ripe for such a thing.  We were a new Nation, and had no business for any such regulations--a Nation /sui generis/.  \"Mr. (Richard Henry) Lee (of Virginia) said drawbacks were right, but would be so much abused, he could not think of admitting them.  \"Mr. (Oliver) Ellsworth (of Connecticut) said New England rum would be exported, instead of West India, to obtain the drawback.  \"I thought it best to say a few words in reply to each.  We were a new Nation, it was true, but we were not a new People.  We were composed of individuals of like manners, habits, and customs with the European Nations.  What, therefore, had been found useful among them, came well recommended by experience to us.  Drawbacks stand as an example in this point of view to us.  If the thing was right in itself, there could be no just argument drawn against the use of a thing from the abuse of it. It would be the duty of Government to guard against abuses, by prudent appointments and watchful attention to officers.  That as to changing the kind of rum, I thought the collection Bill would provide for this, by limiting the exportation to the original casks and packages.  I said a great deal more, but really did not feel much interest either way. But the debates were very lengthy.  \"Butler flamed away, and THREATENED A DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION, with regard to his State, as sure as God was in the firmament.  He scattered his remarks over the whole Impost bill, calling it partial, oppressive, etc., and solely calculated to oppress South Carolina, and yet ever and anon declaring how clear of local views and how candid and dispassionate he was.  He degenerates into mere declamation.  His State would live free, or die glorious.\"  The next piece of evidence is General Jackson's letter to Rev. A. J. Crawford, as follows:  [\"Private.\"]  \"WASHINGTON, May 1, 1833.  \"MY DEAR SIR: * * * I have had a laborious task here, but Nullification is dead; and its actors and courtiers will only be remembered by the People to be execrated for their wicked designs to sever and destroy the only good Government on the globe, and that prosperity and happiness we enjoy over every other portion of the World.  Haman's gallows ought to be the fate of all such ambitious men who would involve their Country in Civil War, and all the evils in its train, that they might reign and ride on its whirlwinds and direct the storm.  The Free People of these United States have spoken, and consigned these wicked demagogues to their proper doom.  Take care of your Nullifiers; you have them among you; let them meet with the indignant frowns of every man who loves his Country.  The Tariff, it is now known, was a mere pretext--its burden was on your coarse woolens.  By the law of July, 1832, coarse woolen was reduced to five per cent., for the benefit of the South.  Mr. Clay's Bill takes it up and classes it with woolens at fifty per cent., reduces it gradually down to twenty per cent., and there it is to remain, and Mr. Calhoun and all the Nullifiers agree to the principle.  The cash duties and home valuation will be equal to fifteen per cent. more, and after the year 1842, you pay on coarse woolens thirty-five per cent.  If this is not Protection, I cannot understand; therefore the Tariff was only the pretext, and Disunion and a Southern Confederacy the real object.  The next pretext will be the Negro or Slavery question.  \"My health is not good, but is improving a little.  Present me kindly to your lady and family, and believe me to be your friend.  I will always be happy to hear from you.                          \"ANDREW JACKSON.\"   Another evidence is given in the following extract from Benton's \"Thirty Years in the Senate,\" vol. ii., as follows:  \"The regular inauguration of this Slavery agitation dates from the year 1835; but it had commenced two years before, and in this way: Nullification and Disunion had commenced in 1830, upon complaint against Protective Tariff.  That, being put down in 1833 under President Jackson's proclamation and energetic measures, was immediately substituted by the Slavery agitation.  Mr. Calhoun, when he went home from Congress in the spring of that year, told his friends that 'the South could never be united against the North on the Tariff question --that the sugar interest of Louisiana would keep her out--and that the basis of Southern Union must be shifted to the Slave question.'  Then all the papers in his interest, and especially the one at Washington, published by Mr. Duff Green, dropped Tariff agitation, and commenced upon Slavery, and in two years had the agitation ripe for inauguration, on the Slavery question.  And in tracing this agitation to its present stage, and to comprehend its rationale, it is not to be forgotten that it is a mere continuation of old Tariff Disunion, and preferred because more available.\"  Again, from p. 490 of his private correspondence, Mr. Clay's words to an Alabamian, in 1844, are thus given:  \"From the developments now being made in South Carolina, it is perfectly manifest that a Party exists in that State seeking a Dissolution of the Union, and for that purpose employ the pretext of the rejection of Mr. Tyler's abominable treaty.  South Carolina, being surrounded by Slave States, would, in the event of a Dissolution of the Union, suffer only comparative evils; but it is otherwise with Kentucky.  She has the boundary of the Ohio extending four hundred miles on three Free States. What would our condition be in the event of the greatest calamity that could befall this Nation?\"  Allusion is also made to a letter written by Representative Nathan Appleton, of Boston, December 15, 1860, in which that gentleman said that when he was in Congress--in 1832-33--he had \"made up his mind that Messrs. Calhoun, Hayne, McDuffie, etc., were desirous of a separation of the Slave States into a separate Confederacy, as more favorable to the security of Slave Property.\"  After mentioning that \"About 1835, some South Carolinians attempted a Disunion demonstration,\" our authority says: It is thus described by ex-Governor Francis Thomas of Maryland, in his speech in Baltimore, October 29, 1861:  \"Full twenty years ago, when occupying my seat in the House of Representatives, I was surprised one morning, after the assembling of the House, to observe that all the members from the Slaveholding States were absent.  Whilst reflecting on this strange occurrence, I was asked why I was not in attendance on the Southern Caucus assembled in the room of the Committee on Claims.  I replied that I had received no invitation.  \"I then proposed to go to the Committee-room to see what was being done. When I entered, I found that little cock-sparrow, Governor Pickens, of South Carolina, addressing the meeting, and strutting about like a rooster around a barn-yard coop, discussing the following resolution:  \"' Resolved, That no member of Congress, representing a Southern constituency, shall again take his seat until a resolution is passed satisfactory to the South on the subject of Slavery.'  \"I listened to his language, and when he had finished, I obtained the floor, asking to be permitted to take part in the discussion.  I determined at once to kill the Treasonable plot hatched by John C. Calhoun, the Catiline of America,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7135"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 3 (#1)"],["body"," asking questions.  I said to Mr. Pickens, 'What next do you propose we shall do? are we to tell the People that Republicanism is a failure?  If you are for that, I am not. I came here to sustain and uphold American institutions; to defend the rights of the North as well as the South; to secure harmony and good fellowship between all Sections of our common Country.' They dared not answer these questions.  The Southern temper had not then been gotten up.  As my questions were not answered, I moved an adjournment of the Caucus /sine die/.  Mr. Craig, of Virginia, seconded the motion, and the company was broken up.  We returned to the House, and Mr. Ingersoll, of Pennsylvania, a glorious patriot then as now, introduced a resolution which temporarily calmed the excitement.\"  The remarks upon this statement, made November 4, 1861, by the National Intelligencer, were as follows:  \"However busy Mr. Pickens may have been in the Caucus after it met, the most active man in getting it up and pressing the Southern members to go into it, was Mr. R.  B. Rhett, also a member from South Carolina.  The occasion, or alleged cause of this withdrawal from the House into secret deliberation was an anti-Slavery speech of Mr. Slade, of Vermont, which Mr. Rhett violently denounced, and proposed to the Southern members to leave the House and go into Conclave in one of the Committee-rooms, which they generally did, if not all of them.  We are able to state, however, what may not have been known to Governor Thomas, that at least three besides himself, of those who did attend it, went there with a purpose very different from an intention to consent to any Treasonable measure.  These three men were Henry A.  Wise, Balie Peyton, and William Cost Johnson.  Neither of them opened his lips in the Caucus; they went to observe; and we can assure Governor Thomas, that if Mr. Pickens or Mr. Calhoun, (whom he names) or any one else had presented a distinct proposition looking to Disunion, or Revolt, or Secession, he would have witnessed a scene not soon to be forgotten.  The three whom we have mentioned were as brave as they were determined.  Fortunately, perhaps, the man whom they went particularly to watch, remained silent and passive.\"  Let us, however, pursue the inquiry a little further.  On the 14th of November, 1860, Alexander H. Stephens addressed the Legislature of Georgia, and in a portion of that address--replying to a speech made before the same Body the previous evening by Mr. Toombs, in which the latter had \"recounted the evils of this Government\"--said:  \"The first [of these evils] was the Fishing Bounties, paid mostly to the sailors of New England.  Our friend stated that forty-eight years of our Government was under the administration of Southern Presidents.  Well, these Fishing Bounties began under the rule of a Southern President, I believe.  No one of them, during the whole forty-eight years, ever set his Administration against the principle or policy of them.  * * *  \"The next evil which my friend complained of, was the Tariff.  Well, let us look at that for a moment.  About the time I commenced noticing public matters, this question was agitating the Country almost as fearfully as the Slave question now is.  In 1832, when I was in college, South Carolina was ready to Nullify or Secede from the Union on this account.  And what have we seen?  The Tariff no longer distracts the public counsels.  Reason has triumphed!  The present Tariff was voted for by Massachusetts and South Carolina.  The lion and the lamb lay down together--every man in the Senate and House from Massachusetts and South Carolina, I think, voted for it, as did my honorable friend himself. And if it be true, to use the figure of speech of my honorable friend, that every man in the North that works in iron, and brass and wood, has his muscle strengthened by the protection of the Government, that stimulant was given by his vote and I believe (that of) every other Southern man.  \"Mr. TOOMBS--The Tariff lessened the duties.  \"Mr. STEPHENS--Yes, and Massachusetts with unanimity voted with the South to lessen them, and they were made just as low as Southern men asked them to be, and that is the rate they are now at.  If reason and argument, with experience, produced such changes in the sentiments of Massachusetts from 1832 to 1857, on the subject of the Tariff, may not like changes be effected there by the same means--reason and argument, and appeals to patriotism on the present vexed question?  And who can say that by 1875 or 1890, Massachusetts may not vote with South Carolina and Georgia upon all those questions that now distract the Country and threaten its peace and existence.  \"Another matter of grievance alluded to by my honorable friend was the Navigation Laws.  This policy was also commenced under the Administration of one of these Southern Presidents who ruled so well, and has been continued through all of them since. * * * One of the objects (of these) was to build up a commercial American marine by giving American bottoms the exclusive Carrying Trade between our own ports.  This is a great arm of national power.  This object was accomplished.  We have now an amount of shipping, not only coastwise, but to foreign countries, which puts us in the front rank of the Nations of the World.  England can no longer be styled the Mistress of the Seas. What American is not proud of the result?  Whether those laws should be continued is another question.  But one thing is certain; no President, Northern or Southern, has ever yet recommended their repeal. * * *  \"These then were the true main grievances or grounds of complaint against the general system of our Government and its workings--I mean the administration of the Federal Government.  As to the acts of the federal States I shall speak presently: but these three were the main ones used against the common head.  Now, suppose it be admitted that all of these are evils in the system; do they overbalance and outweigh the advantages and great good which this same Government affords in a thousand innumerable ways that cannot be estimated?  Have we not at the South, as well as the North, grown great, prosperous, and happy under its operations?  Has any part of the World ever shown such rapid progress in the development of wealth, and all the material resources of national power and greatness, as the Southern States have under the General Government, notwithstanding all its defects?  \"Mr. TOOMBS--In spite of it.  \"Mr. STEPHENS--My honorable friend says we have, in spite of the General Government; that without it, I suppose he thinks, we might have done as well, or perhaps better, than we have done in spite of it.  * * * Whether we of the South would have been better off without the Government, is, to say the least, problematical.  On the one side we can only put the fact, against speculation and conjecture on the other.  * * *  The influence of the Government on us is like that of the atmosphere around us.  Its benefits are so silent and unseen that they are seldom thought of or appreciated.  \"We seldom think of the single element of oxygen in the air we breathe, and yet let this simple, unseen and unfelt agent be withdrawn, this life-giving element be taken away from this all-pervading fluid around us, and what instant and appalling changes would take place in all organic creation.  \"It may be that we are all that we are 'in spite of the General Government,' but it may be that without it we should have been far different from what we are now.  It is true that there is no equal part of the Earth with natural resources superior perhaps to ours.  That portion of this Country known as the Southern States, stretching from the Chesapeake to the Rio Grande, is fully equal to the picture drawn by the honorable and eloquent Senator last night, in all natural capacities.  But how many ages and centuries passed before these capacities were developed to reach this advanced age of civilization. There these same hills, rich in ore, same rivers, same valleys and plains, are as they have been since they came from the hand of the Creator; uneducated and uncivilized man roamed over them for how long no history informs us.  \"It was only under our institutions that they could be developed.  Their development is the result of the enterprise of our people, under operations of the Government and institutions under which we have lived. Even our people, without these, never would have done it.  The organization of society has much to do with the development of the natural resources of any Country or any Land.  The institutions of a People, political and moral, are the matrix in which the germ of their organic structure quickens into life--takes root, and develops in form, nature, and character.  Our institutions constitute the basis, the matrix, from which spring all our characteristics of development and greatness.  Look at Greece.  There is the same fertile soil, the same blue sky, the same inlets and harbors, the same AEgean, the same Olympus; there is the same land where Homer sung, where Pericles spoke; it is in nature the same old Greece--but it is living Greece no more.  \"Descendants of the same people inhabit the country; yet what is the reason of this vast difference?  In the midst of present degradation we see the glorious fragments of ancient works of art-temples, with ornaments and inscriptions that excite wonder and admiration--the remains of a once high order of civilization, which have outlived the language they spoke--upon them all, Ichabod is written--their glory has departed.  Why is this so?  I answer, their institutions have been destroyed.  These were but the fruits of their forms of government, the matrix from which their great development sprang; and when once the institutions of a People have been destroyed, there is no earthly power that can bring back the Promethean spark to kindle them here again, any more than in"]]]
