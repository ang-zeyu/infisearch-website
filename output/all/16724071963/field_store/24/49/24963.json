Turning from the first glance at the circuadjacent splendour, it dwindled into nothing as he looked again at the lady. Nothing flashed or glowed or shone about her, and yet it was with a prevision of the truth that he said,  'I was here once before, ma'am.'  'I know that, Curdie,' she replied.  'The place was full of torches, and the walls gleamed, but nothing as they do now, and there is no light in the place.'  'You want to know where the light comes from?' she said, smiling.  'Yes, ma'am.'  'Then see: I will go out of the cavern.  Do not be afraid, but watch.'  She went slowly out.  The moment she turned her back to go, the light began to pale and fade; the moment she was out of their sight the place was black as night, save that now the smoky yellow-red of their lamps, which they thought had gone out long ago, cast a dusky glimmer around them.    CHAPTER 7  What Is in a Name?  For a time that seemed to them long, the two men stood waiting, while still the Mother of Light did not return.  So long was she absent that they began to grow anxious: how were they to find their way from the natural hollows of the mountain crossed by goblin paths, if their lamps should go out?  To spend the night there would mean to sit and wait until an earthquake rent the mountain, or the earth herself fell back into the smelting furnace of the sun whence she had issued--for it was all night and no faintest dawn in the bosom of the world.  So long did they wait unrevisited, that, had there not been two of them, either would at length have concluded the vision a home-born product of his own seething brain.  And their lamps were going out, for they grew redder and smokier!  But they did not lose courage, for there is a kind of capillary attraction in the facing of two souls, that lifts faith quite beyond the level to which either could raise it alone: they knew that they had seen the lady of emeralds, and it was to give them their own desire that she had gone from them, and neither would yield for a moment to the half doubts and half dreads that awoke in his heart.  And still she who with her absence darkened their air did not return. They grew weary, and sat down on the rocky floor, for wait they would--indeed, wait they must.  Each set his lamp by his knee, and watched it die.  Slowly it sank, dulled, looked lazy and stupid.  But ever as it sank and dulled, the image in his mind of the Lady of Light grew stronger and clearer.  Together the two lamps panted and shuddered.  First one, then the other went out, leaving for a moment a great, red, evil-smelling snuff.  Then all was the blackness of darkness up to their very hearts and everywhere around them.  Was it? No.  Far away--it looked miles away--shone one minute faint point of green light--where, who could tell?  They only knew that it shone.  It grew larger, and seemed to draw nearer, until at last, as they watched with speechless delight and expectation, it seemed once more within reach of an outstretched hand.  Then it spread and melted away as before, and there were eyes--and a face--and a lovely form--and lo! the whole cavern blazing with lights innumerable, and gorgeous, yet soft and interfused--so blended, indeed, that the eye had to search and see in order to separate distinct spots of special colour.  The moment they saw the speck in the vast distance they had risen and stood on their feet.  When it came nearer they bowed their heads.  Yet now they looked with fearless eyes, for the woman that was old yet young was a joy to see, and filled their hearts with reverent delight. She turned first to Peter.  'I have known you long,' she said.  'I have met you going to and from the mine, and seen you working in it for the last forty years.'  'How should it be, madam, that a grand lady like you should take notice of a poor man like me?' said Peter, humbly, but more foolishly than he could then have understood.  'I am poor as well as rich,' said she.  'I, too, work for my bread, and I show myself no favour when I pay myself my own wages.  Last night when you sat by the brook, and Curdie told you about my pigeon, and my spinning, and wondered whether he could believe that he had actually seen me, I heard what you said to each other.  I am always about, as the miners said the other night when they talked of me as Old Mother Wotherwop.'  The lovely lady laughed, and her laugh was a lightning of delight in their souls.  'Yes,' she went on, 'you have got to thank me that you are so poor, Peter.  I have seen to that, and it has done well for both you and me, my friend.  Things come to the poor that can't get in at the door of the rich.  Their money somehow blocks it up.  It is a great privilege to be poor, Peter--one that no man ever coveted, and but a very few have sought to retain, but one that yet many have learned to prize. You must not mistake, however, and imagine it a virtue; it is but a privilege, and one also that, like other privileges, may be terribly misused.  Had you been rich, my Peter, you would not have been so good as some rich men I know.  And now I am going to tell you what no one knows but myself: you, Peter, and your wife both have the blood of the royal family in your veins.  I have been trying to cultivate your family tree, every branch of which is known to me, and I expect Curdie to turn out a blossom on it.  Therefore I have been training him for a work that must soon be done.  I was near losing him, and had to send my pigeon.  Had he not shot it, that would have been better; but he repented, and that shall be as good in the end.'  She turned to Curdie and smiled.  'Ma'am,' said Curdie, 'may I ask questions?'  'Why not, Curdie?'  'Because I have been told, ma'am, that nobody must ask the king questions.'  'The king never made that law,' she answered, with some displeasure. 'You may ask me as many as you please--that is, so long as they are sensible.  Only I may take a few thousand years to answer some of them. But that's nothing.  Of all things time is the cheapest.'  'Then would you mind telling me now, ma'am, for I feel very confused about it--are you the Lady of the Silver Moon?'  'Yes, Curdie; you may call me that if you like.  What it means is true.'  'And now I see you dark, and clothed in green, and the mother of all the light that dwells in the stones of the earth!  And up there they call you Old Mother Wotherwop!  And the Princess Irene told me you were her great-great-grandmother!  And you spin the spider threads, and take care of a whole people of pigeons; and you are worn to a pale shadow with old age; and are as young as anybody can be, not to be too young; and as strong, I do believe, as I am.'  The lady stooped toward a large green stone bedded in the rock of the floor, and looking like a well of grassy light in it.  She laid hold of it with her fingers, broke it out, and gave it to Peter. 'There!' cried Curdie.  'I told you so.  Twenty men could not have done that.  And your fingers are white and smooth as any lady's in the land.  I don't know what to make of it.'  'I could give you twenty names more to call me, Curdie, and not one of them would be a false one.  What does it matter how many names if the person is one?'  'Ah!  But it is not names only, ma'am.  Look at what you were like last night, and what I see you now!'  'Shapes are only dresses, Curdie, and dresses are only names.  That which is inside is the same all the time.'  'But then how can all the shapes speak the truth?'  'It would want thousands more to speak the truth, Curdie; and then they could not.  But there is a point I must not let you mistake about.  It is one thing the shape I choose to put on, and quite another the shape that foolish talk and nursery tale may please to put upon me.  Also, it is one thing what you or your father may think about me, and quite another what a foolish or bad man may see in me.  For instance, if a thief were to come in here just now, he would think he saw the demon of the mine, all in green flames, come to protect her treasure, and would run like a hunted wild goat.  I should be all the same, but his evil eyes would see me as I was not.'  'I think I understand,' said Curdie.  'Peter,' said the lady, turning then to him, 'you will have to give up Curdie for a little while.'  'So long as he loves us, ma'am, that will not matter--much.'  'Ah! you are right there, my friend,' said the beautiful princess. And as she said it she put out her hand, and took the hard, horny hand of the miner in it, and held it for a moment lovingly.  'I need say no more,' she added, 'for we understand each other--you and I, Peter.'  The tears came into Peter's eyes.  He bowed his head in thankfulness, and his heart was much too full to speak.  Then the great old, young, beautiful princess turned to Curdie.  'Now, Curdie, are you ready?' she said.  'Yes, ma'am,' answered Curdie.  'You do not know what for.'  'You do, ma'am.  That is enough.'  'You could not have given me a better answer, or done more to prepare yourself, Curdie,' she returned, with one of her radiant smiles.  'Do you think you will know me again?'  'I think so.  But how can I tell what you may look like next?'  'Ah, that indeed!  How can you tell?  Or how could I expect you should? But those who know me well, know me whatever new dress or shape or name I may be in; and by and by you will have learned to do so too.'  'But if you want me to know you again, ma'am, for certain sure,' said Curdie, 'could you not give me some sign, or tell me something about you that never changes--or some other way to know you, or thing to know you by?'  'No, Curdie; that would be to keep you from knowing me.  You must know me in quite another way from that.  It would not be the least use to you or me either if I were to make you know me in that way."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/709"],["title","The Princess and Curdie (#7)"],["body"," would be but to know the sign of Me--not to know me myself.  It would be no better than if I were to take this emerald out of my crown and give it to you to take home with you, and you were to call it me, and talk to it as if it heard and saw and loved you. Much good that would do you, Curdie!  No; you must do what you can to know me, and if you do, you will.  You shall see me again in very different circumstances from these, and, I will tell you so much, it may be in a very different shape.  But come now, I will lead you out of this cavern; my good Joan will be getting too anxious about you.  One word more: you will allow that the men knew little what they were talking about this morning, when they told all those tales of Old Mother Wotherwop; but did it occur to you to think how it was they fell to talking about me at all? It was because I came to them; I was beside them all the time they were talking about me, though they were far enough from knowing it, and had very little besides foolishness to say.'  As she spoke she turned and led the way from the cavern, which, as if a door had been closed, sank into absolute blackness behind them.  And now they saw nothing more of the lady except the green star, which again seemed a good distance in front of them, and to which they came no nearer, although following it at a quick pace through the mountain. Such was their confidence in her guidance, however, and so fearless were they in consequence, that they felt their way neither with hand nor foot, but walked straight on through the pitch-dark galleries. When at length the night of the upper world looked in at the mouth of the mine, the green light seemed to lose its way among the stars, and they saw it no more.  Out they came into the cool, blessed night.  It was very late, and only starlight.  To their surprise, three paces away they saw, seated upon a stone, an old country-woman, in a cloak which they took for black. When they came close up to it, they saw it was red.  'Good evening!' said Peter.  'Good evening!' returned the old woman, in a voice as old as herself.  But Curdie took off his cap and said:  'I am your servant, Princess.'  The old woman replied:  'Come to me in the dove tower tomorrow night, Curdie--alone.'  'I will, ma'am,' said Curdie.  So they parted, and father and son went home to wife and mother--two persons in one rich, happy woman.    CHAPTER 8  Curdie's Mission  The next night Curdie went home from the mine a little earlier than usual, to make himself tidy before going to the dove tower.  The princess had not appointed an exact time for him to be there; he would go as near the time he had gone first as he could.  On his way to the bottom of the hill, he met his father coming up.  The sun was then down, and the warm first of the twilight filled the evening.  He came rather wearily up the hill: the road, he thought, must have grown steeper in parts since he was Curdie's age.  His back was to the light of the sunset, which closed him all round in a beautiful setting, and Curdie thought what a grand-looking man his father was, even when he was tired.  It is greed and laziness and selfishness, not hunger or weariness or cold, that take the dignity out of a man, and make him look mean.  'Ah, Curdie!  There you are!' he said, seeing his son come bounding along as if it were morning with him and not evening.  'You look tired, Father,' said Curdie.  'Yes, my boy.  I'm not so young as you.'  'Nor so old as the princess,' said Curdie.  'Tell me this,' said Peter, 'why do people talk about going downhill when they begin to get old?  It seems to me that then first they begin to go uphill.'  'You looked to me, Father, when I caught sight of you, as if you had been climbing the hill all your life, and were soon to get to the top.'  'Nobody can tell when that will be,' returned Peter.  'We're so ready to think we're just at the top when it lies miles away.  But I must not keep you, my boy, for you are wanted; and we shall be anxious to know what the princess says to you--that is, if she will allow you to tell us.'  'I think she will, for she knows there is nobody more to be trusted than my father and mother,' said Curdie, with pride.  And away he shot, and ran, and jumped, and seemed almost to fly down the long, winding, steep path, until he came to the gate of the king's house.  There he met an unexpected obstruction: in the open door stood the housekeeper, and she seemed to broaden herself out until she almost filled the doorway.  'So!' she said, 'it's you, is it, young man?  You are the person that comes in and goes out when he pleases, and keeps running up and down my stairs without ever saying by your leave, or even wiping his shoes, and always leaves the door open!  Don't you know this is my house?'  'No, I do not,' returned Curdie respectfully.  'You forget, ma'am, that it is the king's house.'  'That is all the same.  The king left it to me to take care of--and that you shall know!'  'Is the king dead, ma'am, that he has left it to you?' asked Curdie, half in doubt from the self-assertion of the woman.  'Insolent fellow!' exclaimed the housekeeper.  'Don't you see by my dress that I am in the king's service?'  'And am I not one of his miners?'  'Ah! that goes for nothing.  I am one of his household.  You are an out-of-doors labourer.  You are a nobody.  You carry a pickaxe.  I carry the keys at my girdle.  See!'  'But you must not call one a nobody to whom the king has spoken,' said Curdie.  'Go along with you!' cried the housekeeper, and would have shut the door in his face, had she not been afraid that when she stepped back he would step in ere she could get it in motion, for it was very heavy and always seemed unwilling to shut.  Curdie came a pace nearer.  She lifted the great house key from her side, and threatened to strike him down with it, calling aloud on Mar and Whelk and Plout, the menservants under her, to come and help her. Ere one of them could answer, however, she gave a great shriek and turned and fled, leaving the door wide open.  Curdie looked behind him, and saw an animal whose gruesome oddity even he, who knew so many of the strange creatures, two of which were never the same, that used to live inside the mountain with their masters the goblins, had never seen equalled.  Its eyes were flaming with anger, but it seemed to be at the housekeeper, for it came cowering and creeping up and laid its head on the ground at Curdie's feet.  Curdie hardly waited to look at it, however, but ran into the house, eager to get up the stairs before any of the men should come to annoy--he had no fear of their preventing him. Without halt or hindrance, though the passages were nearly dark, he reached the door of the princess's workroom, and knocked.  'Come in,' said the voice of the princess.  Curdie opened the door--but, to his astonishment, saw no room there. Could he have opened a wrong door?  There was the great sky, and the stars, and beneath he could see nothing only darkness! But what was that in the sky, straight in front of him?  A great wheel of fire, turning and turning, and flashing out blue lights!  'Come in, Curdie,' said the voice again.  'I would at once, ma'am,' said Curdie, 'if I were sure I was standing at your door.'  'Why should you doubt it, Curdie?'  'Because I see neither walls nor floor, only darkness and the great sky.'  'That is all right, Curdie.  Come in.'  Curdie stepped forward at once.  He was indeed, for the very crumb of a moment, tempted to feel before him with his foot; but he saw that would be to distrust the princess, and a greater rudeness he could not offer her.  So he stepped straight in--I will not say without a little tremble at the thought of finding no floor beneath his foot.  But that which had need of the floor found it, and his foot was satisfied.  No sooner was he in than he saw that the great revolving wheel in the sky was the princess's spinning wheel, near the other end of the room, turning very fast.  He could see no sky or stars any more, but the wheel was flashing out blue--oh, such lovely sky-blue light!--and behind it of course sat the princess, but whether an old woman as thin as a skeleton leaf, or a glorious lady as young as perfection, he could not tell for the turning and flashing of the wheel.  'Listen to the wheel,' said the voice which had already grown dear to Curdie: its very tone was precious like a jewel, not as a jewel, for no jewel could compare with it in preciousness.  And Curdie listened and listened.  'What is it saying?' asked the voice.  'It is singing,' answered Curdie.  'What is it singing?'  Curdie tried to make out, but thought he could not; for no sooner had he got hold of something than it vanished again.  Yet he listened, and listened, entranced with delight.  'Thank you, Curdie, said the voice.  'Ma'am,' said Curdie, 'I did try hard for a while, but I could not make anything of it.'  'Oh yes, you did, and you have been telling it to me!  Shall I tell you again what I told my wheel, and my wheel told you, and you have just told me without knowing it?'  'Please, ma'am.'  Then the lady began to sing, and her wheel spun an accompaniment to her song, and the music of the wheel was like the music of an Aeolian harp blown upon by the wind that bloweth where it listeth. Oh, the sweet sounds of that spinning wheel!  Now they were gold, now silver, now grass, now palm trees, now ancient cities, now rubies, now mountain brooks, now peacock's feathers, now clouds, now snowdrops, and now mid-sea islands.  But for the voice that sang through it all, about that I have no words to tell.  It would make you weep if I were able to tell you what that was like, it was so beautiful and true and lovely. But this is something like the words of its song:     The stars are spinning their threads,   And the clouds are the dust that flies,   And the suns are weaving them up   For the time when the sleepers shall rise.    The ocean in music "]]]
