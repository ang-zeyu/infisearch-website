If you secede, your representatives will go out of Congress and leave us at the mercy of a Black Republican Government.  Mr. Lincoln will have no check.  He can appoint his Cabinet, and have it confirmed.  The Congress will then be Republican, and he will be able to pass such laws as he may suggest. The Supreme Court will be powerless to protect us.  We implore you to stand by us, and by our friends in the Free States; and let us all, the bold, the true, and just men in the Free and Slave States, with a united front, stand by each other, by our principles, by our rights, our equality, our honor, and by the Union under the Constitution.  I believe this is the only way to save it; and we can do it.\"  But this \"still small voice\" of conscience and of reason, heard like a whisper from the mouths of Stephens in Georgia, and Magoffin in Kentucky, was drowned in the clamor and tumult of impassioned harangues and addresses, and the drumming and tramp of the \"minute men\" of South Carolina, and other military organizations, as they excitedly prepared throughout the South for the dread conflict at arms which they recklessly invited, and savagely welcomed.  We have seen how President Andrew Jackson some thirty years before, had stamped out Nullification and Disunion in South Carolina, with an iron heel.  But a weak and feeble old man--still suffering from the effects of the mysterious National Hotel poisoning--was now in the Executive Chair at the White House.  Well-meaning, doubtless, and a Union man at heart, his enfeebled intellect was unable to see, and hold firm to, the only true course.  He lacked clearness of perception, decision of character, and nerve.  He knew Secession was wrong, but allowed himself to be persuaded that he had no Constitutional power to prevent it.  He had surrounded himself in the Cabinet with such unbending adherents and tools of the Slave-Power, as Howell Cobb of Georgia, his Secretary of the Treasury, John B. Floyd of Virginia, as Secretary of War, Jacob Thompson of Mississippi, as Secretary of the Interior, and Isaac Toucy of Connecticut, as Secretary of the Navy, before whose malign influence the councils of Lewis Cass of Michigan, the Secretary of State, and other Union men, in and out of the Cabinet, were quite powerless.  When, therefore, the Congress met (December 3, 1860) and he transmitted to it his last Annual Message, it was found that, instead of treating Secession from the Jacksonian standpoint, President Buchanan feebly wailed over the threatened destruction of the Union, weakly apologized for the contemplated Treason, garrulously scolded the North as being to blame for it, and, while praying to God to \"preserve the Constitution and the Union throughout all generations,\" wrung his nerveless hands in despair over his own powerlessness--as he construed the Constitution--to prevent Secession!  Before writing his pitifully imbecile Message, President Buchanan had secured from his Attorney-General (Jeremiah S. Black of Pennsylvania) an opinion, in which the latter, after touching upon certain cases in which he believed the President would be justified in using force to sustain the Federal Laws, supposed the case of a State where all the Federal Officers had resigned and where there were neither Federal Courts to issue, nor officers to execute judicial process, and continued: \"In that event, troops would certainly be out of place, and their use wholly illegal.  If they are sent to aid the Courts and Marshals there must be Courts and Marshals to be aided.  Without the exercise of these functions, which belong exclusively to the civil service, the laws cannot be executed in any event, no matter what may be the physical strength which the Government has at its command.  Under such circumstances, to send a military force into any State, with orders to act against the people, would be simply making War upon them.\"  Resting upon that opinion of Attorney-General Black, President Buchanan, in his Message, after referring to the solemn oath taken by the Executive \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" and stating that there were now no longer any Federal Officers in South Carolina, through whose agency he could keep that oath, took up the laws of February 28, 1795, and March 3, 1807, as \"the only Acts of Congress on the Statute-book bearing upon the subject,\" which \"authorize the President, after he shall have ascertained that the Marshal, with his posse comitatus, is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case, to call out the Militia and employ the Army and Navy to aid him in performing this service, having first, by Proclamation, commanded the insurgents to 'disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limited time'\"--and thereupon held that \"This duty cannot, by possibility, be performed in a State where no judicial authority exists to issue process, and where there is no Marshal to execute it; and where even if there were such an officer, the entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him.\" And, not satisfied with attempting to show as clearly as he seemed to know how, his own inability under the laws to stamp out Treason, he proceeded to consider what he thought Congress also could not do under the Constitution.  Said he: \"The question fairly stated, is: Has the Constitution delegated to Congress the power to coerce into submission a State which is attempting to withdraw, or has actually withdrawn, from the Confederacy?  If answered in the affirmative, it must be on the principle that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and make War against a State.  After much serious reflection, I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or to any other department of the Federal Government.\"  And further: \"Congress possesses many means of preserving it (the Union) by conciliation; but the sword was not placed in their hands to preserve it by force.\"  Thus, in President Buchanan's judgment, while, in another part of his Message, he had declared that no State had any right, Constitutional or otherwise, to Secede from that Union, which was designed for all time --yet, if any State concluded thus wrongfully to Secede, there existed no power in the Union, by the exercise of force, to preserve itself from instant dissolution!  How imbecile the reasoning, how impotent the conclusion, compared with that of President Jackson, thirty years before, in his Proclamation against Nullification and Secession, wherein that sturdy patriot declared to the South Carolinians.  that \"compared to Disunion, all other evils are light, because that brings with it an accumulation of all;\" that \"Disunion by armed force, is Treason;\" and that he was determined \"to execute the Laws,\" and \"to preserve the Union!\"  President Buchanan's extraordinary Message--or so much of it as related to the perilous condition of the Union--was referred, in the House of Representatives, to a Select Committee of Thirty-three, comprising one member from each State, in which there was a very large preponderance of such as favored Conciliation without dishonor.  But the debates in both Houses, in which the most violent language was indulged by the Southern Fire-eaters, as well as other events, soon proved that there was a settled purpose on the part of the Slave-Power and its adherents to resist and spit upon all attempts at placation.  In the Senate also (December 5), a Select Committee of Thirteen was appointed, to consider the impending dangers to the Union, comprising Senators Powell of Kentucky, Hunter of Virginia, Crittenden of Kentucky, Seward of New York, Toombs of Georgia, Douglas of Illinois, Collamer of Vermont, Davis of Mississippi, Wade of Ohio, Bigler of Pennsylvania, Rice of Minnesota, Doolittle of Wisconsin, and Grimes of Iowa.  Their labors were alike without practical result, owing to the irreconcilable attitude of the Southrons, who would accept nothing less than a total repudiation by the Republicans of the very principles upon which the recent Presidential contest had by them been fought and won.  Nor would they even accept such a repudiation unless carried by vote of the majority of the Republicans.  The dose that they insisted upon the Republican Party swallowing must not only be as noxious as possible, but must absolutely be mixed by that Party itself, and in addition, that Party must also go down on its knees, and beg the privilege of so mixing and swallowing the dose!  That was the impossible attitude into which, by their bullying and threats, the Slave Power hoped to force the Republican Party--either that or \"War.\"  Project after project in both Houses of Congress looking to Conciliation was introduced, referred, reported, discussed, and voted on or not, as the case might be, in vain.  And in the meantime, in New York, in Philadelphia, and elsewhere in the North, the timidity of Capital showed itself in great Conciliation meetings, where speeches were applauded and resolutions adopted of the most abject character, in behalf of \"Peace, at any price,\" regardless of the sacrifice of honor and principles and even decency.  In fact the Commercial North, with supplicating hands and beseeching face, sank on its knees in a vain attempt to propitiate its furious creditor, the South, by asking it not only to pull its nose, but to spit in its face, both of which it humbly and even anxiously offered for the purpose!*       [Thus, in Philadelphia, December 13, 1860, at a great meeting held      at the call of the Mayor, in Independence Square, Mayor Henry led      off the speaking--which was nearly all in the same line-by saying:      \"I tell you that if in any portion of our Confederacy, sentiments      have been entertained and cherished which are inimical to the civil      rights and social institutions of any other portion, those      sentiments should be relinquished.\"  Another"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7134"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 2 (#2)"],["body","r, Judge George      W. Woodward, sneeringly asked: \"Whence came these excessive      sensibilities that cannot bear a few slaves in a remote Territory      until the white people establish a Constitution?\"  Another, Mr.      Charles E. Lex (a Republican), speaking of the Southern People,      said: \"What, then, can we say to them? what more than we have      expressed in the resolutions we have offered?  If they are really      aggrieved by any laws upon our Statute-books opposed to their      rights--if upon examination any such are found to be in conflict      with the Constitution of these United States--nay, further, if they      but serve to irritate our brethren of the South, whether      Constitutional or not, I, for one, have no objection that they      should instantly be repealed.\"  Another said, \"Let us repeal our      obnoxious Personal Liberty bills * * *; let us receive our brother      of the South, if he will come among us for a little time, attended      by his servant, and permit him thus to come.\"  And the resolutions      adopted were even still more abject in tone than the speeches.]  But the South at present was too busy in perfecting its long-cherished plans for the disruption of the Union, to more than grimly smile at this evidence of what it chose to consider \"a divided sentiment\" in the North.  While it weakened the North, it strengthened the South, and instead of mollifying the Conspirators against the Union, it inspired them with fresh energy in their fell purpose to destroy it.  The tone of the Republican press, too, while more dignified, was thoroughly conciliatory.  The Albany Evening Journal,--[November 30, 1860]--the organ of Governor Seward, recognizing that the South, blinded by passion, was in dead earnest, but also recognizing the existence of \"a Union sentiment there, worth cherishing,\" suggested \"a Convention of the People, consisting of delegates appointed by the States, in which it would not be found unprofitable for the North and South, bringing their respective griefs, claims, and proposed reforms, to a common arbitrament, to meet, discuss, and determine upon a future\"--before a final appeal to arms.  So, too, Horace Greeley, in the New York Tribune,--[November 9, 1860.]--after weakly conceding, on his own part, the right of peaceable Secession, said: \"But while we thus uphold the practical liberty, if not the abstract right, of Secession, we must insist that the step be taken, if it ever shall be, with the deliberation and gravity befitting so momentous an issue.  Let ample time be given for reflection; let the subject be fully canvassed before the People; and let a popular vote be taken in every case, before Secession is decreed.\"  Other leading papers of the Northern press, took similar ground for free discussion and conciliatory action.  In the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives--as also was shown by the appointment, heretofore mentioned, of Select Committees to consider the gravity of the situation, and suggest a remedy--the same spirit of Conciliation and Concession, and desire for free and frank discussion, was apparent among most of the Northern and Border-State members of those Bodies.  But these were only met by sneers and threats on the part of the Fire-eating Secession members of the South.  In the Senate, Senator Clingman of North Carolina, sneeringly said: \"They want to get up a free debate, as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from New York expressed it, in one of his speeches.  But a Senator from Texas told me the other day that a great many of these free debaters were hanging from the trees of that country;\" and Senator Iverson, of Georgia, said: \"Gentlemen speak of Concession, of the repeal of the Personal Liberty bills.  Repeal them all to-morrow, and you cannot stop this revolution.\" After declaring his belief that \"Before the 4th of March, five States will have declared their independence\" and that \"three other States will follow as soon as the action of the people can be had;\" he proceeded to allude to the refusal of Governor Houston of Texas to call together the Texas Legislature for action in accord with the Secession sentiment, and declared that \"if he will not yield to that public sentiment, some Texan Brutus will arise to rid his country of this hoary-headed incubus that stands between the people and their sovereign will!\"  Then, sneering at the presumed cowardice of the North, he continued: \"Men talk about their eighteen millions (of Northern population); but we hear a few days afterwards of these same men being switched in the face, and they tremble like sheep-stealing dogs!  There will be no War.  The North, governed by such far-seeing Statesmen as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from New York, will see the futility of this.  In less than twelve months, a Southern Confederacy will be formed; and it will be the most successful Government on Earth.  The Southern States, thus banded together, will be able to resist any force in the World.  We do not expect War; but we will be prepared for it--and we are not a feeble race of Mexicans either.\"  On the other hand, there were Republicans in that Body who sturdily met the bluster of the Southern Fire-eaters with frank and courageous words expressing their full convictions on the situation and their belief that Concessions could not be made and that Compromises were mere waste paper.  Thus, Senator Ben Wade of Ohio, among the bravest and manliest of them all, in a speech in the Senate, December 17, the very day on which the South Carolina Secession Convention was to assemble, said to the Fire-eaters: \"I tell you frankly that we did lay down the principle in our platform, that we would prohibit, if we had the power, Slavery from invading another inch of the Free Soil of this Government.  I stand to that principle to-day.  I have argued it to half a million of people, and they stand by it; they have commissioned me to stand by it; and, so help me God, I will! * * *  On the other hand, our platform repudiates the idea that we have any right, or harbor any ultimate intention to invade or interfere with your institutions in your own States.  * * * It is not, by your own confessions, that Mr. Lincoln is expected to commit any overt act by which you may be injured.  You will not even wait for any, you say; but, by anticipating that the Government may do you an injury, you will put an end to it--which means, simply and squarely, that you intend to rule or ruin this Government.  * * *  As to Compromises, I supposed that we had agreed that the Day of Compromises was at an end.  The most solemn we have made have been violated, and are no more.  * * *  We beat you on the plainest and most palpable issue ever presented to the American people, and one which every man understood; and now, when we come to the Capital, we tell you that our candidates must and shall be inaugurated--must and shall administer this Government precisely as the Constitution prescribes.  * * *  I tell you that, with that verdict of the people in my pocket, and standing on the platform on which these candidates were elected, I would suffer anything before I would Compromise in any way.\"  In the House of Representatives, on December 10, 1860, a number of propositions looking to a peaceful settlement of the threatened danger, were offered and referred to the Select Committee of Thirty-three.  On the following Monday, December 17, by 154 yeas to 14 nays, the House adopted a resolution, offered by Mr. Adrian of New Jersey, in these words:  \"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the Constitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the repeal of all Statutes by the State Legislatures in conflict with, and in violation of, that sacred instrument, and the laws of Congress passed in pursuance thereof.\"  On the same day, the House adopted, by 135 yeas to no nays, a resolution offered by Mr. Lovejoy of Illinois, in these words:  \"Whereas, The Constitution of the United States is the Supreme law of the Land, and ready and faithful obedience to it a duty of all good and law-abiding citizens; Therefore:  \"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the Constitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the repeal of all Nullification laws; and that it is the duty of the President of the United States to protect and defend the property of the United States.\"       [This resolution, before adoption, was modified by declaring it to      be the duty of all citizens, whether \"good and law abiding\" or not,      to yield obedience to the Constitution, as will be seen by      referring to the proceedings in the Globe of that date, where the      following appears:       \"Mr. LOGAN.  I hope there will be no objection on this side of the      House to the introduction of the [Lovejoy] resolution.  I can see      no difference myself, between this resolution and the one      [Adrian's] just passed, except in regard to verbiage.  I can find      but one objection to the resolution, and that is in the use of the      words declaring that all' law abiding' citizens should obey the      Constitution.  I think that all men should do so.       \"Mr. LOVEJOY.  I accept the amendment suggested by my Colleague.       \"Mr. LOGAN.  It certainly should include members of Congress; but      if it is allowed to remain all 'good and law abiding' citizens, I      do not think it will include them.  [Laughter.]       \"The resolution was modified by the omission of those words.\"]  It also adopted, by 115 yeas to 44 nays, a resolution offered by Mr. Morris of Illinois, as follows:  \"Resolved by the House of Representatives: That we properly estimate the immense value of our National Union to our collective and individual happiness; that we cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; that we will speak of it as the palladium of our political safety and prosperity; that we will watch its preservation"]]]
