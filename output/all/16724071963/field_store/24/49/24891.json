But if she forbids me to go out with you again, Bobby?”  Bob pondered.  “Well--you're nineteen,” he said. “And the very first minute I can, I'm going to take you away from her altogether. If you were a kid I wouldn't let you defy her. But, hang it all, Tommy, I'm not going to let her punish you as though you were ten. If she forbids you to meet me--well, you must just take French leave, that's all.”  “Oh, Bob, you are a satisfying person!” said Cecilia, with a sigh.  “Well, I don't know--it's you who will have to stand the racket,” said Bob. “I only wish I could take my share, old girl. But, please goodness, it won't be for long.”  “Bob,” said Cecilia, and paused. “What about that statement of hers--that it would be illegal for you to take me away? Do you think it's true?”  “I've asked our Major, and he's a bit doubtful,” said Bob. “All the other fellows say it's utter nonsense. But I'm going to ask the old lawyer chap who has charge of Aunt Margaret's money--he'll tell me. We won't bother about it, Tommy; if I can't get you politely, I'll steal you. Just forget the she-dragon and all her works.”  “But have you thought about what you are going to do?”  “I don't think of much else, and that's the truth, Tommy,” said her brother ruefully. “You see, there's mighty little in sight. I could get a clerkship, I suppose. I could certainly get work as a day labourer. But I don't see much in either of those possibilities towards a little home with you, which is what I want. I'm going to answer every advertisement I can find for fellows wanted on farms.” He straightened his square shoulders. “Tommy, there must be plenty of work for any chap as strong as an ox, as I am.”  “I'm sure there's work,” said Cecilia. “But the men who want jobs don't generally advertise themselves as 'complete with sister.' I'm what's technically known as an encumbrance, Bob.”  “You!” said Bob. “You're just part of the firm, so don't you forget it. Didn't we always arrange that we should stick together?”  “We did--but it may not be easy to manage,” Cecilia said, doubtfully. “Perhaps we could get some job together; I could do inside work, or teach, or sew.”  “No!” said Bob explosively. “If I can't earn enough for us both, I ought to be shot, Aunt Margaret didn't bring you up to work.”  “But the world has turned upside down since Aunt Margaret died,” said Cecilia. “And I have worked pretty hard for the last two years, Bob; and it hasn't hurt me.”  “It has made you older--and you ought to be only a kid yet,” said Bob wistfully. “You haven't had any of the fun girls naturally ought to have. I don't want you to slave all your time, Tommy.”  “Bless you!” said his sister. “But I wouldn't care a bit, as long as it was near you--and not in Lancaster Gate.”  They had turned across Hyde Park, where a big company of girl guides was drilling, watched by a crowd of curious on-lookers. Across a belt of grass some boy scouts were performing similar evolutions, marching with all the extra polish and swagger they could command, just to show the guides that girls were all very well in their way, but that no one with skirts could really hope to do credit to a uniform. Cecilia paused to watch them.  “Thank goodness, the children can come and drill in the park again!” she said. “I hated to come here before the armistice--soldiers, soldiers, drilling everywhere, and guns and searchlight fixings. Whenever I saw a squad drilling it made me think of you, and of course I felt sure you'd be killed!”  “I do like people who look on the bright side of life!” said Bob laughing. “And whenever you saw an aeroplane I suppose you made sure I was crashing somewhere?”  “Certainly I did,” said his sister with dignity.  “Women are queer things,” Bob remarked. “If you had these unpleasant beliefs, how did you manage to write as cheerfully as you did? Your letters were a scream--I used to read bits of 'em out to the fellows.”  “You had no business to do any such thing,” said Cecilia, blushing.  “Well, I did, anyhow. They used to make 'em yell. How did you manage them?”  “Well, it was no good assuring you you'd be killed,” said Cecilia practically. “I thought it was more sensible to try to make you laugh.”  “You certainly did that,” said Bob. “I fancied from your letters that life with the she-dragon was one huge joke, and that Papa was nice and companionable, and the kids, sweet little darlings who ate from your hand. And all the time you were just the poor old toad under the harrow!”  “I'm not a toad!” rejoined his sister indignantly. “Don't you think you could find pleasanter things to compare me to?”  “Toads aren't bad,” said Bob, laughing. “Ever seen the nice old fellow in the Zoo who shoots out a tongue a yard long and picks up a grub every time? He's quite interesting.”  “I certainly never had any inclination to do any such thing,” Cecilia laughed.  They had turned into Piccadilly and were walking down, watching the crowded motor traffic racing north and south. Suddenly Bob straightened up and saluted smartly, as a tall staff officer, wearing a general's badges, ran down the steps of a big club, and nearly cannoned into Cecilia.  “I beg your pardon!” he said--and then, noticing Bob--“How are you, Rainham?” He dived into a waiting taxi, and was whisked away.  “Did he bump you?” inquired Bob.  “No--though it would be almost a privilege to be bumped by anyone as splendid as that!” Cecilia answered. “He knows you, too!--who is he, Bobby?”  “That's General Harran, the Australian,” said Bob proudly. “He's a great man. I've run into him occasionally since I've been with the Australians in France.”  “He looks nice.”  “He is nice,” replied Bob. “Awful martinet about duty, but he treats every one under him jolly well. Never forgets a face or a name, and he's always got a decent word for everybody. He's had some quite long talks to me, when we were waiting for some 'plane or other to come back.”  “Why wouldn't he?” asked Cecilia, who considered it a privilege for anyone to talk to her brother.  Bob regarded her in amazement.  “Good gracious!” he ejaculated. “Why, he's a major-general; I can tell you, most men of his rank haven't any use for small fry like me--to talk to, that is.”  Cecilia had a flash of memory.  “Isn't he the general who was close by when you brought that German aeroplane down behind our lines? Didn't he say nice things to you about it?”  “Oh, that was only in the way of business,” said Bob somewhat confused. “The whole thing was only a bit of luck--and, of course, it was luck, too, that he was there. But he is just as nice to fellows who haven't had a chance like that.”  Out of the crowd two more figures in Air Force uniform came, charging at Bob with outstretched hands.  “By Jove, old chap! What luck to meet you!”  They shook hands tumultuously, and Bob made them known to Cecilia--comrades he had not seen for months, but with whom he had shared many strange experiences in the years of war. They fell into quick talk, full of the queer jargon of the air. The newcomers, it appeared, had been with the army of occupation in Germany; there seemed a thousand things they urgently desired to tell Bob within the next few minutes. One turned to Cecilia, presently, with a laughing interpretation of some highly technical bit of slang.  “Oh, you needn't bother to translate to Tommy,” Bob said. “She knows all about it.”  The other boys suddenly gave her all their attention.  “Are you Tommy? But we know you awfully well.”  “Me?” Cecilia turned pink.  “Rather. We used to hear your letters.”  The pink deepened to a fine scarlet.  “Bob!” said his sister reproachfully. “You really shouldn't.”  “Oh, don't say that,” said the taller boy, by name Harrison. “They were a godsend--there used to be jolly little to laugh about, pretty often, and your letters made us all yell. Didn't they, Billy?”  “They did,” said Billy, who was small and curly-haired--and incidentally a captain, with a little row of medal ribbons. “Jolliest letters ever. We passed a vote of thanks to you in the mess, Miss Tommy, after old Bob here had gone. Some one was to write and tell him about it, but I don't believe anyone ever did. I say, you must have had a cheery time--all the funny things that ever happened seemed to come your way.”  Cecilia stammered something, her scarlet confusion deepening. A rather grim vision of the war years swept across her mind--of the ceaseless quest in papers and journals, and wherever people talked, for “funny things” to tell Bob; and of how, when fact and rumour gave out, she used to sit by her attic window at night, deliberately inventing merry jests. It had closely resembled a job of hard work at the time; but apparently it had served its purpose well. She had made them laugh; and some one had told her that no greater service could be rendered to the boys who risked death, and worse than death, during every hour of the day and night. But it was extremely difficult to talk about it afterwards.  Bob took pity on her.  “I'll tell you just what sort of a cheery time she had, some time or other,” he remarked. “What are you fellows doing this evening?”  “We were just going to ask you the same thing,” declared Billy. “Can't we all go and play about somewhere? We've just landed, and we want to be looked after. Any theatres in this little town still?”  “Cheer-oh!” ejaculated Billy. “Let's all go and find out.”  So they went, and managed very successfully to forget war and even stepmothers. They were all little more than children in enjoyment of simple pleasures still, since war had fallen upon them at the very threshold of life, cutting them off from all the cheery happenings that are the natural inheritance of all young things. The years that would ordinarily have seen them growing tired of play had been spent in grim tasks; now they were children again, clamouring for the playtime they had lost. They found enormous pleasure in the funny little French restaurant, where Madame, a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7047"],["title","Back to Billabong (#7)"],["body","whose sympathies were as boundless as her waist, welcomed them with wide smiles, delighting in the broken French of Billy and Harrison, and deftly tempting them to fresh excursions in her language. She put a question in infantile French to Bob presently, whereupon that guileless youth, with a childlike smile, answered her with a flood of idiomatic phrases, in an accent purer than her own--collapsing with helpless laughter at her amazed face. After which, Madame neglected her other patrons to hover about their table like a stout, presiding goddess, guiding them gently to the best dishes on the menu, and occasionally putting aside their own selection with a hasty, “Mon-non; you vill not like that one to-day.” She patted Cecilia in a motherly fashion at parting, and their bill was only about half what it should have been.  They found a musical comedy, and laughed their way through it--Billy and Harrison had apparently no cares in the world, and Bob and Cecilia were caught up in the whirl of their high spirits, so that anything became a huge joke. The evening flew by on airy wings, when Billy insisted on taking them to supper after the theatre. Cecilia allowed herself a fleeting vision of Mrs. Rainham, and then, deciding that she might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb, followed gaily. And supper was so cheery a meal that she forgot all about time--until, just at the end, she caught sight of the restaurant clock.  “Half-past eleven! Oh, Bobby!”  “Well, if it is--you poor little old Cinderella,” said Bob.  But he hurried her away, for all that, amid a chorus of farewells and efforts, on the part of Billy and Harrison, to arrange further meetings. They ran to the nearest tube station, and dived into its depths; and, after being whisked underground for a few minutes, emerged into the cool night. Cecilia slipped her arm through her brother's as they hurried along the empty street.  “Now, you keep your nose in the air,” Bobby told her. “You aren't exactly a kid now, and she can't really do anything to you. Oh, by Jove--I was thinking, in the theatre, she might interfere with our letters.”  “She's quite equal to it,” said Cecilia.  “Just what she'd revel in doing. Well, you can easily find out. I'll write to you to-morrow, and again the next day--just ordinary letters, with nothing particular in them except an arrangement to meet next Saturday. If you don't get them you'll know she's getting at the mail first.”  “What shall I do, then?”  “Drop me a line--or, better still, wire to me,” said Bob. “Just say, 'Address elsewhere.' Then I'll write to you at Mr. M'Clinton's; the old solicitor chap in Lincoln's Inn; and you'll have to go there and get the letters. You know his address, don't you?”  “Oh, yes. I have to write to him every quarter when he sends me my allowance. You'll explain to him, then, Bob, or he'll simply redirect your letters here.”  “Oh, of course. I want to go and see the old chap, anyhow, to talk over Aunt Margaret's affairs. I might as well know a little more about them. Tommy, the she-dragon can't actually lock you up, can she?”  “No--it couldn't be done,” said Cecilia. “Modern houses aren't built with dungeons and things. Moreover, if she tried to keep me in the house she would have to take the children out for their walks herself; and she simply hates walking.”  “Then you can certainly post to me, and get my letters, and I'll be up again as soon as ever I can. Buck up, old girl--it can't be for long now.”  They turned in at the Rainhams' front gate, and Cecilia glanced up apprehensively. All the windows were in darkness; the grey front of the house loomed forbiddingly in the faint moonlight.  “You're coming in, aren't you?” she asked, her hand tightening on his arm.  “Rather--we'll take the edge off her tongue together.” Bob rang the bell. “Wonder if they have all gone to bed. The place looks pretty dark.”  “She's probably in the little room at the back--the one she calls her boudoir.”  “Horrible little den, full of bamboo and draperies and pampas grass--I know,” nodded Bob. “Well, either she's asleep or she thinks it's fun to keep us on the mat. I'll try her again.” He pressed the bell, and the sound of its whirring echoed through the silent house.    CHAPTER IV  COMING HOME   The bolt grated, as if grudgingly, and slowly the door opened as far as the limits of its chain would permit, and Mrs. Rainham's face appeared in the aperture. She glared at them for a minute without speaking.  “So you have come home?” she said at last. The chain fell, and the door opened. “I wonder you trouble to come home at all. May I ask where you have been?”  “She has been with me, Mrs. Rainham,” Bob said cheerfully. “May I come in?”  Mrs. Rainham did not move. She held the door half open, blocking the way.  “It is far too late for me to ask you in,” she answered frigidly. “Cecilia can explain her conduct, I presume.”  “Oh, there's really nothing to explain,” Bob answered. “It was so late when she got out this afternoon that I kept her--why, it was after half-past four before she was dressed.”  “I told her to be in for tea.”  “Yes; but I felt sure you couldn't realize how late she was in getting out,” said Bob in a voice of honey.  “That was entirely her own mismanagement--” began the hard tones.  “Oh, no, Mrs. Rainham; really it wasn't,” said Cecilia mildly. “Your accompaniments, you remember--your dress--your music,” she stopped, in amazement at herself. It was rarely indeed that she answered any accusation of her stepmother's. But to be on the mat at midnight, with Bob in support, seemed to give her extraordinary courage.  “You see, Mrs. Rainham, there seems to have been quite a number of little details that Cecilia couldn't mismanage,” said Bob, following up the advantage. It was happily evident that his stepmother's rage was preventing her from speaking, and, as he remarked later, there was no knowing when he would ever get such a chance again. “She really needed rest. I'm sure you'll agree that every one is entitled to some free time. Of course, you couldn't possibly have realized that it was a week since she had been off duty.”  “It's her business to do what I tell her,” said Mrs. Rainham, finding her voice, in an explosive fashion that made a passing policeman glance up curiously. “She knew I had company, and expected her help. I had to see to the children's tea myself. And how do I know where she's been?--gallivanting round to all sorts of places! I tell you, young lady, you needn't think you're going to walk in here at midnight as if nothing was the matter.”  “I never expected to,” said Cecilia cheerfully. “But it was worth it.”  Bob regarded her in solemn admiration.  “I don't think we gallivanted at all reprehensibly,” he said. “Just dinner and a theatre. I haven't made much claim to her time during the last four years, Mrs. Rainham; surely I'm entitled to a little of it now.”  “You!” Mrs. Rainham's tone was vicious. “You don't give her a home, do you? And as long as I do, she'll do what I tell her.”  “No; I don't give her a home--yet,” said Bob very quietly. “But I very soon will, I assure you; and meanwhile, she earns a good deal more than her keep in her father's house. You can't treat her worse than your servants--”  Cecilia suddenly turned to him.  “Ah, don't, Bob darling. It doesn't matter--truly--not a bit.” With the end of the long penance before her, it seemed beyond the power of the angry woman in the doorway to hurt her much. What she could not bear was that their happy evening should be spoiled by hard and cruel words at its close. Bob's face, that had been so merry, was sterner than she had ever seen it, all its boyishness gone. She put up her own face, and kissed him.  “Good night--you mustn't stay any longer. I'll be all right.” She whispered a few quick words of French, begging him to go, and Bob, though unwillingly, gave in.  “All right,” he said. “Go to bed, little 'un. I'll do as I promised about writing.” He saluted Mrs. Rainham stiffly. “You'll remember, Mrs. Rainham, that she stayed out solely at my wish--I take full responsibility, and I'll be ready to tell my father so.” The door closed behind Cecilia, and he strode away down the street, biting his lip. He felt abominably as though he had deserted the little sister--and yet, what else could he do? One could not remain for ever, brawling on a doorstep at midnight--and Tommy had begged him to go. Still--  “Hang it!” he said viciously. “If she were only a decent Hun to fight!”  In the grim house in Lancaster Gate Cecilia was facing the music alone. She listened unmoved, as she had listened many times before, to the catalogue of her sins and misdeeds--only she had never seen her stepmother quite so angry. Finally, a door above opened, and Mark Rainham looked out, his dull, colourless face weakly irritable.  “I wish you'd stop that noise, and let the girl go to bed,” he said. “Come here, Cecilia.”  She went to him hesitating, and he looked at her with a spark of compassion. Then he kissed her.  “Good night,” he said, as though he had called her to him simply to say it, and not to separate her from the furious woman who stood looking at them. “Run off to bed, now--no more talking.” Cecilia ran upstairs obediently. Behind her, as she neared her attic, she heard her stepmother's voice break out anew.  “Just fancy Papa!” she muttered. Any mother sensations were lost in wonder at her father's actually having intervened. The incredible thing had happened. For a moment she felt a wave of pity for him, left alone to face the shrill voice. Then she shrugged her shoulders.  “Ah, well--he married her,” she said. “I suppose he has had it many a time. Perhaps he knows how to stop it--I don't!” She laughed, turning the key in the lock, and sitting down beside the open window. The glamour of her happy evening was still upon her; even the scene with her stepmother had not had power to chase it away. The scene was only to be expected; the"]]]
