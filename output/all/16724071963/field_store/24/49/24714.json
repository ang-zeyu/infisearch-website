(#3)"],["body","the headlong race, And frantic hurry of the chase, To start, pursue, and bring to bay, Rush in, drag down, and rend my prey, Then from the carcass turn away; Mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed, And soothed each wound which pride inflamed;--Yes, God and man might now approve me, If thou hadst lived, and lived to love me!  As he finished reading these lines, Morton could not forbear reflecting with compassion on the fate of this singular and most unhappy being, who, it appeared, while in the lowest state of degradation, and almost of contempt, had his recollections continually fixed on the high station to which his birth seemed to entitle him; and, while plunged in gross licentiousness, was in secret looking back with bitter remorse to the period of his youth, during which he had nourished a virtuous, though unfortunate attachment.  \"Alas! what are we,\" said Morton, \"that our best and most praiseworthy feelings can be thus debased and depraved--that honourable pride can sink into haughty and desperate indifference for general opinion, and the sorrow of blighted affection inhabit the same bosom which license, revenge, and rapine, have chosen for their citadel? But it is the same throughout; the liberal principles of one man sink into cold and unfeeling indifference, the religious zeal of another hurries him into frantic and savage enthusiasm. Our resolutions, our passions, are like the waves of the sea, and, without the aid of Him who formed the human breast, we cannot say to its tides, 'Thus far shall ye come, and no farther.\"'  While he thus moralized, he raised his eyes, and observed that Burley stood before him.  \"Already awake?\" said that leader--\"It is well, and shows zeal to tread the path before you.--What papers are these?\" he continued.  Morton gave him some brief account of Cuddie's successful marauding party, and handed him the pocket-book of Bothwell, with its contents. The Cameronian leader looked with some attention on such of the papers as related to military affairs, or public business; but when he came to the verses, he threw them from him with contempt.  \"I little thought,\" he said, \"when, by the blessing of God, I passed my sword three times through the body of that arch tool of cruelty and persecution, that a character so desperate and so dangerous could have stooped to an art as trifling as it is profane. But I see that Satan can blend the most different qualities in his well-beloved and chosen agents, and that the same hand which can wield a club or a slaughter-weapon against the godly in the valley of destruction, can touch a tinkling lute, or a gittern, to soothe the ears of the dancing daughters of perdition in their Vanity Fair.\"  \"Your ideas of duty, then,\" said Morton, \"exclude love of the fine arts, which have been supposed in general to purify and to elevate the mind?\"  \"To me, young man,\" answered Burley, \"and to those who think as I do, the pleasures of this world, under whatever name disguised, are vanity, as its grandeur and power are a snare. We have but one object on earth, and that is to build up the temple of the Lord.\"  \"I have heard my father observe,\" replied Morton, \"that many who assumed power in the name of Heaven, were as severe in its exercise, and as unwilling to part with it, as if they had been solely moved by the motives of worldly ambition--But of this another time. Have you succeeded in obtaining a committee of the council to be nominated?\"  \"I have,\" answered Burley. \"The number is limited to six, of which you are one, and I come to call you to their deliberations.\"  Morton accompanied him to a sequestered grassplot, where their colleagues awaited them. In this delegation of authority, the two principal factions which divided the tumultuary army had each taken care to send three of their own number. On the part of the Cameronians, were Burley, Macbriar, and Kettledrummle; and on that of the moderate party, Poundtext, Henry Morton, and a small proprietor, called the Laird of Langcale. Thus the two parties were equally balanced by their representatives in the committee of management, although it seemed likely that those of the most violent opinions were, as is usual in such cases, to possess and exert the greater degree of energy. Their debate, however, was conducted more like men of this world than could have been expected from their conduct on the preceding evening. After maturely considering their means and situation, and the probable increase of their numbers, they agreed that they would keep their position for that day, in order to refresh their men, and give time to reinforcements to join them, and that, on the next morning, they would direct their march towards Tillietudlem, and summon that stronghold, as they expressed it, of malignancy. If it was not surrendered to their summons, they resolved to try the effect of a brisk assault; and, should that miscarry, it was settled that they should leave a part of their number to blockade the place, and reduce it, if possible, by famine, while their main body should march forward to drive Claverhouse and Lord Ross from the town of Glasgow. Such was the determination of the council of management; and thus Morton's first enterprise in active life was likely to be the attack of a castle belonging to the parent of his mistress, and defended by her relative, Major Bellenden, to whom he personally owed many obligations! He felt fully the embarrassment of his situation, yet consoled himself with the reflection, that his newly-acquired power in the insurgent army would give him, at all events, the means of extending to the inmates of Tillietudlem a protection which no other circumstance could have afforded them; and he was not without hope that he might be able to mediate such an accommodation betwixt them and the presbyterian army, as should secure them a safe neutrality during the war which was about to ensue.      CHAPTER III.                 There came a knight from the field of slain,                His steed was drench'd in blood and rain.                                              Finlay.  We must now return to the fortress of Tillietudlem and its inhabitants. The morning, being the first after the battle of Loudon-hill, had dawned upon its battlements, and the defenders had already resumed the labours by which they proposed to render the place tenable, when the watchman, who was placed in a high turret, called the Warder's Tower, gave the signal that a horseman was approaching. As he came nearer, his dress indicated an officer of the Life-Guards; and the slowness of his horse's pace, as well as the manner in which the rider stooped on the saddle-bow, plainly showed that he was sick or wounded. The wicket was instantly opened to receive him, and Lord Evandale rode into the court-yard, so reduced by loss of blood, that he was unable to dismount without assistance. As he entered the hall, leaning upon a servant, the ladies shrieked with surprise and terror; for, pale as death, stained with blood, his regimentals soiled and torn, and his hair matted and disordered, he resembled rather a spectre than a human being. But their next exclamation was that of joy at his escape.  \"Thank God!\" exclaimed Lady Margaret, \"that you are here, and have escaped the hands of the bloodthirsty murderers who have cut off so many of the king's loyal servants!\"  \"Thank God!\" added Edith, \"that you are here and in safety! We have dreaded the worst. But you are wounded, and I fear we have little the means of assisting you.\"  \"My wounds are only sword-cuts,\" answered the young nobleman, as he reposed himself on a seat; \"the pain is not worth mentioning, and I should not even feel exhausted but for the loss of blood. But it was not my purpose to bring my weakness to add to your danger and distress, but to relieve them, if possible. What can I do for you?--Permit me,\" he added, addressing Lady Margaret--\"permit me to think and act as your son, my dear madam--as your brother, Edith!\"  He pronounced the last part of the sentence with some emphasis, as if he feared that the apprehension of his pretensions as a suitor might render his proffered services unacceptable to Miss Bellenden. She was not insensible to his delicacy, but there was no time for exchange of sentiments.  \"We are preparing for our defence,\" said the old lady with great dignity; \"my brother has taken charge of our garrison, and, by the grace of God, we will give the rebels such a reception as they deserve.\"  \"How gladly,\" said Evandale, \"would I share in the defence of the Castle! But in my present state, I should be but a burden to you, nay, something worse; for, the knowledge that an officer of the Life-Guards was in the Castle would be sufficient to make these rogues more desperately earnest to possess themselves of it. If they find it defended only by the family, they may possibly march on to Glasgow rather than hazard an assault.\"  \"And can you think so meanly of us, my lord,\" said Edith, with the generous burst of feeling which woman so often evinces, and which becomes her so well, her voice faltering through eagerness, and her brow colouring with the noble warmth which dictated her language--\"Can you think so meanly of your friends, as that they would permit such considerations to interfere with their sheltering and protecting you at a moment when you are unable to defend yourself, and when the whole country is filled with the enemy? Is there a cottage in Scotland whose owners would permit a valued friend to leave it in such circumstances? And can you think we will allow you to go from a castle which we hold to be strong enough for our own defence?\"  \"Lord Evandale need never think of it,\" said Lady Margaret. \"I will dress his wounds myself; it is all an old wife is fit for in war time; but to quit the Castle of Tillietudlem when the sword of the enemy is drawn to slay him,--the meanest trooper that ever wore the king's coat on his back should not do so, much"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6940"],["title","Old Mortality, Volume 2. (#4)"],["body","my young Lord Evandale.--Ours is not a house that ought to brook such dishonour. The tower of Tillietudlem has been too much distinguished by the visit of his most sacred\"--  Here she was interrupted by the entrance of the Major.  \"We have taken a prisoner, my dear uncle,\" said Edith--\"a wounded prisoner, and he wants to escape from us. You must help us to keep him by force.\"  \"Lord Evandale!\" exclaimed the veteran. \"I am as much pleased as when I got my first commission. Claverhouse reported you were killed, or missing at least.\"  \"I should have been slain, but for a friend of yours,\" said Lord Evandale, speaking with some emotion, and bending his eyes on the ground, as if he wished to avoid seeing the impression that what he was about to say would make upon Miss Bellenden. \"I was unhorsed and defenceless, and the sword raised to dispatch me, when young Mr Morton, the prisoner for whom you interested yourself yesterday morning, interposed in the most generous manner, preserved my life, and furnished me with the means of escaping.\"  As he ended the sentence, a painful curiosity overcame his first resolution; he raised his eyes to Edith's face, and imagined he could read in the glow of her cheek and the sparkle of her eye, joy at hearing of her lover's safety and freedom, and triumph at his not having been left last in the race of generosity. Such, indeed, were her feelings; but they were also mingled with admiration of the ready frankness with which Lord Evandale had hastened to bear witness to the merit of a favoured rival, and to acknowledge an obligation which, in all probability, he would rather have owed to any other individual in the world.  Major Bellenden, who would never have observed the emotions of either party, even had they been much more markedly expressed, contented himself with saying, \"Since Henry Morton has influence with these rascals, I am glad he has so exerted it; but I hope he will get clear of them as soon as he can. Indeed, I cannot doubt it. I know his principles, and that he detests their cant and hypocrisy. I have heard him laugh a thousand times at the pedantry of that old presbyterian scoundrel, Poundtext, who, after enjoying the indulgence of the government for so many years, has now, upon the very first ruffle, shown himself in his own proper colours, and set off, with three parts of his cropeared congregation, to join the host of the fanatics.--But how did you escape after leaving the field, my lord?\"  \"I rode for my life, as a recreant knight must,\" answered Lord Evandale, smiling. \"I took the route where I thought I had least chance of meeting with any of the enemy, and I found shelter for several hours--you will hardly guess where.\"  \"At Castle Bracklan, perhaps,\" said Lady Margaret, \"or in the house of some other loyal gentleman?\"  \"No, madam. I was repulsed, under one mean pretext or another, from more than one house of that description, for fear of the enemy following my traces; but I found refuge in the cottage of a poor widow, whose husband had been shot within these three months by a party of our corps, and whose two sons are at this very moment with the insurgents.\"  \"Indeed?\" said Lady Margaret Bellenden; \"and was a fanatic woman capable of such generosity?--but she disapproved, I suppose, of the tenets of her family?\"  \"Far from it, madam,\" continued the young nobleman; \"she was in principle a rigid recusant, but she saw my danger and distress, considered me as a fellow-creature, and forgot that I was a cavalier and a soldier. She bound my wounds, and permitted me to rest upon her bed, concealed me from a party of the insurgents who were seeking for stragglers, supplied me with food, and did not suffer me to leave my place of refuge until she had learned that I had every chance of getting to this tower without danger.\"  \"It was nobly done,\" said Miss Bellenden; \"and I trust you will have an opportunity of rewarding her generosity.\"  \"I am running up an arrear of obligation on all sides, Miss Bellenden, during these unfortunate occurrences,\" replied Lord Evandale; \"but when I can attain the means of showing my gratitude, the will shall not be wanting.\"  All now joined in pressing Lord Evandale to relinquish his intention of leaving the Castle; but the argument of Major Bellenden proved the most effectual.  \"Your presence in the Castle will be most useful, if not absolutely necessary, my lord, in order to maintain, by your authority, proper discipline among the fellows whom Claverhouse has left in garrison here, and who do not prove to be of the most orderly description of inmates; and, indeed, we have the Colonel's authority, for that very purpose, to detain any officer of his regiment who might pass this way.\"  \"That,\" said Lord Evandale, \"is an unanswerable argument, since it shows me that my residence here may be useful, even in my present disabled state.\"  \"For your wounds, my lord,\" said the Major, \"if my sister, Lady Bellenden, will undertake to give battle to any feverish symptom, if such should appear, I will answer that my old campaigner, Gideon Pike, shall dress a flesh-wound with any of the incorporation of Barber-Surgeons. He had enough of practice in Montrose's time, for we had few regularly-bred army chirurgeons, as you may well suppose.--You agree to stay with us, then?\"  \"My reasons for leaving the Castle,\" said Lord Evandale, glancing a look towards Edith, \"though they evidently seemed weighty, must needs give way to those which infer the power of serving you. May I presume, Major, to enquire into the means and plan of defence which you have prepared? or can I attend you to examine the works?\"  It did not escape Miss Bellenden, that Lord Evandale seemed much exhausted both in body and mind. \"I think, sir,\" she said, addressing the Major, \"that since Lord Evandale condescends to become an officer of our garrison, you should begin by rendering him amenable to your authority, and ordering him to his apartment, that he may take some refreshment ere he enters on military discussions.\"  \"Edith is right,\" said the old lady; \"you must go instantly to bed, my lord, and take some febrifuge, which I will prepare with my own hand; and my lady-in-waiting, Mistress Martha Weddell, shall make some friar's chicken, or something very light. I would not advise wine.--John Gudyill, let the housekeeper make ready the chamber of dais. Lord Evandale must lie down instantly. Pike will take off the dressings, and examine the state of the wounds.\"  \"These are melancholy preparations, madam,\" said Lord Evandale, as he returned thanks to Lady Margaret, and was about to leave the hall,--\"but I must submit to your ladyship's directions; and I trust that your skill will soon make me a more able defender of your castle than I am at present. You must render my body serviceable as soon as you can, for you have no use for my head while you have Major Bellenden.\"  With these words he left the apartment.  \"An excellent young man, and a modest,\" said the Major.  \"None of that conceit,\" said Lady Margaret, \"that often makes young folk suppose they know better how their complaints should be treated than people that have had experience.\"  \"And so generous and handsome a young nobleman,\" said Jenny Dennison, who had entered during the latter part of this conversation, and was now left alone with her mistress in the hall, the Major returning to his military cares, and Lady Margaret to her medical preparations.  Edith only answered these encomiums with a sigh; but, although silent, she felt and knew better than any one how much they were merited by the person on whom they were bestowed. Jenny, however, failed not to follow up her blow.  \"After a', it's true that my lady says--there's nae trusting a presbyterian; they are a' faithless man-sworn louns. Whae wad hae thought that young Milnwood and Cuddie Headrigg wad hae taen on wi' thae rebel blackguards?\"  \"What do you mean by such improbable nonsense, Jenny?\" said her young mistress, very much displeased.  \"I ken it's no pleasing for you to hear, madam,\" answered Jenny hardily; \"and it's as little pleasant for me to tell; but as gude ye suld ken a' about it sune as syne, for the haill Castle's ringing wi't.\"  \"Ringing with what, Jenny? Have you a mind to drive me mad?\" answered Edith, impatiently.  \"Just that Henry Morton of Milnwood is out wi' the rebels, and ane o' their chief leaders.\"  \"It is a falsehood!\" said Edith--\"a most base calumny! and you are very bold to dare to repeat it to me. Henry Morton is incapable of such treachery to his king and country--such cruelty to me--to--to all the innocent and defenceless victims, I mean, who must suffer in a civil war--I tell you he is utterly incapable of it, in every sense.\"  \"Dear! dear! Miss Edith,\" replied Jenny, still constant to her text, \"they maun be better acquainted wi' young men than I am, or ever wish to be, that can tell preceesely what they're capable or no capable o'. But there has been Trooper Tam, and another chield, out in bonnets and grey plaids, like countrymen, to recon--reconnoitre--I think John Gudyill ca'd it; and they hae been amang the rebels, and brought back word that they had seen young Milnwood mounted on ane o' the dragoon horses that was taen at Loudon-hill, armed wi' swords and pistols, like wha but him, and hand and glove wi' the foremost o' them, and dreeling and commanding the men; and Cuddie at the heels o' him, in ane o' Sergeant Bothwell's laced waistcoats, and a cockit hat with a bab o' blue ribbands at it for the auld cause o' the Covenant, (but Cuddie aye liked a blue ribband,) and a ruffled sark, like ony lord o' the land--it sets the like o' him, indeed!\"  \"Jenny,\" said her young mistress hastily, \"it is impossible these men's report can be true; my uncle has heard nothing of it at this instant.\"  \"Because Tam Halliday,\" answered the handmaiden, \"came in just five minutes after Lord Evandale; and when he heard his lordship was in the Castle, he"]]]
