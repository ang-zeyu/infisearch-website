The twelve chattering Kroomen who were to go as far as the Bambara country with the expedition were seated two in each canoe.  They were along simply as camp attendants and packers and would by no means go any further than the borders of the Bambara country which they said was the dwelling-place of \"bery bad man sah.\"  Just as the little launch, flying the stars and stripes out of compliment to the boys, was drawing out into the stream with a long blast of her whistle, a tall, black form came racing along the bank and with one bound cleared the five feet or so between the launch and the shore.  It was Sikaso.  \"So you came after all,\" said Frank, turning to him, after a bend in the river had hidden the waving Mr. Desplaines from sight and they were settling down in the launch.  \"Sikaso see in the smoke I come--I come.  If I see in smoke I no come--I no come,\" remarked the Krooman.  \"He's traveling light anyhow,\" remarked Billy.  Indeed the giant negro's only bit of baggage was a huge axe, the handle of which was dented and scarred as if by many combats.  Billy was about to run his thumb along its edge when with a gesture the mighty negro waved him aside.  Instead he took Billy's handkerchief from the young reporter's pocket and drew it gently along the axe blade.  It fell in two pieces on each side of his blade, severed by its razor-like edge.  \"Sikaso is a good fellow to be friends with when he can make little ones out of big ones like that,\" remarked Billy, picking up the two fragments of his handkerchief, \"that's a fine way to cut up a gentleman's wardrobe.\"  Bit by bit as the launch drove steadily up the muddy river--from whose jungle-grown banks arose a warm, moist vapor--Frank drew from the grim-faced old Krooman some of his history.  He had been a mighty warrior in the old days, he said, and the weapon he carried was his war axe with which he had killed uncounted enemies.  A rival tribe, however, had killed his father and mother and driven him to the coast with the few survivors of his village.  Here he had shipped on an American trading brig for New York where he had picked up the knowledge of English he possessed.  He also worshiped America as \"free man's country.\"  But Africa had called to him and some three years before he had returned on another ship and meant to die there, he said.  \"Why did you wish to go with us?\" asked Frank as the native concluded his story.  \"It was written so in the smoke, white boss,\" replied the veteran simply.  \"The ju-ju in the smoke strong ju-ju.  He knows many things.\"  \"Is that the only reason you have for coming?\"  \"No, boss, I tell you truth,\" replied the old warrior, \"some day I find the chief who kill my father and my mother and kill my friends.\"  He glanced significantly at his axe.  \"In the Moon Mountains maybe I find him--maybe not.  But some day I shall and then--\"  He said no more, but as Frank remarked to Harry when the former recounted his conversation to his brother later:  \"I shouldn't much like to be that man when Sikaso meets him.\"  The launch and the small flotilla she towed forged steadily up the stream all that day and at nightfall drew alongside the bank at a spot where a clearing planted with bananas clearly indicated the presence thereabouts of a native village.  As soon as the launch was moored to the bank the adventurers scrambled out--not sorry of a chance to stretch their legs--and looked about them wonderingly. They were really in equatorial Africa at last, and even as they looked there was a sound borne to their ears that brought home to them strongly how very far away they were from old New York.  It was a pulsing, rhythmic beating something like a drum and yet unlike it. They looked questioningly at Sikaso.  \"Tom-tom,\" said he briefly.  \"Is it a friendly village, Sikaso?\" inquired Doctor Wiseman.  \"Friendly to some--not to all,\" replied the Krooman, who for some unaccountable reason had taken a strange dislike to the professor. \"Come,\" he said, intoning to Frank and Harry, \"we go see get chicken, maybe pork.\"  \"Say, can't we come along, Frank?\" asked Billy and Lathrop their faces falling.  Frank consulted Sikaso who merely said:  \"Little fat white boy, with round, glass four-eyes talk too much.\"  \"Well,\" laughed Frank, \"I think I can promise for him that he won't do any talking that will cause any harm this evening.\"  \"Talk too much, indeed,\" grumbled Billy highly offended, \"why at home my folks were thinking of having a doctor treat me for bashfulness I'm so retiring in my disposition.\"  As soon as the laugh that this remark of the disgruntled reporter had caused had subsided--even old Sikaso giving a grim smile as he took in the purport of it--the little party set out down a native trail toward the village.  As the tom-tom beating increased in loudness as the village drew near, the boys' hearts began to beat a little faster.  At last they were about to see a real African village--such as they had read about in Stanley's and Livingstone's books--and other less authentic volumes.  They almost stumbled on the place as they suddenly emerged into a clearing.  It was a strange sight that met their eyes.  Arranged in a circle were fifty huts that resembled nothing so much as a collection of old-fashioned straw covered beehives, enlarged to shelter human bees.  All about them women and children were bustling; setting about getting the evening meal.  Before one hut sat a woman, pounding something in a stone pestle--\"like the drugstore men use at home,\"--whispered Lathrop to Billy.  The arrival of the little band created a stir.  The hideous old man, with a sort of straw-bonnet, who had been beating on the antelope skin drum called by Sikaso a \"tom-tom\" saw them and instantly picked up his instrument and waddled off with as much dignity as his age and a much distended stomach would allow him.  The younger men, however, advanced boldly toward the party.  Some of them carried, spears, others held Birmingham matchlocks of the kind the British and French Governments have in vain tried to keep out of the hands of the West African natives.  These guns are smuggled in by hundreds, by Arab traders who exchange the \"gas-pipe\" weapons worth perhaps two dollars a-piece for priceless ivory, and even human flesh for the slave dhows.  \"Seesanah (peace),\" said Sikaso gravely, advancing in his turn.  \"Seesanah,\" echoed the tribesmen, who evidently recognized Sikaso from their greetings.  The boys stood grouped in the background--Billy Barnes and Lathrop even viewing with some alarm the advance of the savage-looking natives.  \"Well, he seems to have fallen in with several members of his club,\" remarked the irrepressible Billy as old Sikaso and the natives talked away at a great rate.  \"I'm going to get a picture of some of these niggers when they get through,\" he continued aside to Lathrop.  \"What; you brought a camera?\" asked the other boy.  \"Sure thing,\" replied Billy, \"and if their ugly mugs don't break the lens, I mean to get some good snaps.\"  He drew a small flat folding camera from his pocket as he spoke and got it ready for action.  \"Do you think Frank would stand for it?  It might make trouble you know,\" said Lathrop.  \"Pshaw,\" retorted the cocksure Billy, \"what trouble can it make?  I wish I knew bow to say 'Look pleasant, please,' in Hottentot, or whatever language these fellows talk.\"  By this time old Sikaso's 'pow-wow' was over and he motioned Frank and Harry forward.  After they had been introduced to the chiefs and headmen of the village, the \"big chief,\" a villainous-looking old party with only one eye and his legs thrust into a red shirt--into the armholes that is, with the rest of the garment rolled round his waist--announced he was ready to give fresh provisions for calico, red and blue, and several sections of the brass rod that passes for currency on the West Coast.  While Frank, Harry and Sikaso were bargaining behind a hut, over the price to be charged for a razor-backed porker of suspicious appearance the village suddenly became filled with an uproar of angry shouts and tumult.  \"What can be the matter?\" exclaimed Frank, as the boys, followed by the old chief and Sikaso, rushed from behind the hut to ascertain the cause of the disturbance.  Standing in the center of a crowd of excited villagers was Billy Barnes, his helmet knocked off and an arrow sticking through it.  He looked scared to death as well he might, for by his side was a stalwart young African, brandishing a heavy-bladed spear above his head.  At the young reporter's feet lay the ill-fated camera that had caused all the trouble.  What had happened was this.  As soon as Frank and Harry and their companions had left him and Lathrop alone, Billy had started to carry out his determination to take some pictures.  The first subject he selected was a serious-faced little baby, innocent of any clothing, that sat playing with a ragged dog at, the entrance of one of the beehive huts.  He had just clicked the button and exclaimed:  \"This will be a jim-dandy,\" when he felt something whistle through the air and the next minute his hat lay at his feet with an arrow in it.  In an instant the child's father--convinced that Billy was putting Ju-ju medicine on the child--was upon him, armed with his big hunting spear and followed by half the village.  Even Billy--scared as he was--did not realize how very near to death he actually came to being.  Sikaso's shouted words in a native dialect caused the tribesmen to fall back but they still muttered angrily.  Stepping swiftly up to the camera Sikaso with a single blow of his axe smashed it to pieces.  \"Here, that's no way to treat my camera!\" Billy was indignantly beginning, when Frank gripped his shoulder in an iron-clutch and whispered:  \"Shut up; if you don't want to make more trouble.\"  Billy was starting on an angry remonstrance when he caught Frank's eye.  The young leader was really angry and Billy prudently refrained from saying"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6905"],["title","The Boy Aviators in Africa; Or, an Aerial Ivory Trail (#8)"],["body","more.  As for Sikaso--after demolishing Billy's machine, he turned to the tribesmen and addressing them in stately tones said--as he afterward translated it to Frank:  \"Village fools.  You see there is no magic in the little black box. It is nothing but a child's plaything for the fat, spectacled idiot.\"  (This part of the oration Frank did not communicate to Billy.)  \"You see I have smashed it.  Do I fear?  Do I look now like a man in terror of the white man's medicine.  It is nothing.  It is broken and gone like the cloud before the wind, like the shadow on the mountain side.\"  The effect of all this was soothing and the boys left the camp, to order some of their packmen to bring home the provisions, with light hearts.  As for Billy his ears burned by the time Frank got through reading him a lecture.  \"I'm sorry,\" he said bravely, \"and I won't do it again.  Gee! talk about 'press the button and we'll do the rest.'\"  \"They nearly did it--didn't they,\" laughed Frank, his good humor quite restored.     CHAPTER VII  A TRAITOR IN CAMP   It was a week later, and the launch having towed the expedition as far up the river as Frank decided was necessary--before they struck out into the unknown land of the cannibals, winged men, and the ivory hoard--had returned to civilization several days before, carrying with it letters from all the adventurers which they felt might be the last they would write for some time.  The spot selected for the permanent camp was a sort of park-like space covered at its edges with masses of manioc and banana bushes.  Beyond towered huge tropical trees and beyond these again the blue outlines of the distant Moon Mountains in which, according to old Barr's map, lay the ivory cache.  It had been a busy week.  The Golden Eagle II had been re-erected and her own wireless and the field wireless apparatus put in order. As our readers who have followed this series are familiar with the manner of setting up the great Chester aeroplane and her fittings, it would be tedious to repeat the description of the process. Suffice it to say that thanks to the clever simplicity of the \"knock-down\" arrangement, by which the ship could be taken apart and set up again, the operation of equipping her for active work was a comparatively light one.  The extra gasoline and supplies for the camp in general were stored in a separate tent removed from the circle in which the boys' tents and those of Ben Stubbs and Professor Wiseman were pitched.  There was, too, a newcomer in the camp--a Portuguese named Diego de Barros.  He was not a particularly well-favored individual, but he bore the reputation of having great power over the natives and of being very friendly to the white traders who penetrated into the interior.  Once or twice there had been ugly talk about his being in league with the Arab slave and ivory traders, but he had managed to clear his name and along the Ivory Coast enjoyed the reputation of being an honest, reliable man.  He had joined the boys' camp a few days before and his manner of coming was this.  While everybody was busy getting things in shape there had come a loud hail from the quarters of the native helpers, just outside the white man's encampment, announcing that a canoe was coming up the river.  All hands had hastened to the river bank to find de Barros just putting his foot ashore from the canoe in which two natives had paddled him from the coast.  He had with him some bales of cotton goods and a few gewgaws of various kinds and was bound, so he said, on a trading expedition into the back country.  Further down the river he had heard, he explained, that the boys were camped where he found them, and he had determined to pay them a visit.  The brief stay that the boys had interpreted this as meaning, however, had extended itself into three days and still Diego showed no inclination to leave.  \"If he doesn't move on soon I shall be compelled to ask him to go,\" said Frank in an annoyed tone to Harry.  \"I don't want to be inhospitable, but we can't afford to have strangers hanging round the camp, there is too much at stake.\"  Harry agreed with him and the two boys decided to tell the Portuguese that evening as tactfully as possible that they were on a private enterprise and could not accommodate strangers.  This decision arrived at, Frank turned to the steel strong box that was never out of his sight and drew from it the precious map of the Moon Mountains. Seated at the little camp-table--(the conversation just related had taken place in the Boy Aviators' tent)--the two pored over the document for hours.  With dividers, compass and parallel rulers Frank, who was a skilled navigator, laid out an aerial course that would bring them, he calculated, unerringly to the spot marked by a red cross where--so old Luther Barr declared--lay the ivory that was to save Mr. Beasley from financial ruin and disgrace.  Frank laid his finger on the spot and exclaimed enthusiastically:  \"There it is, Harry, and we are not so far from it now.  In a few days we shall know whether we are on a wild-goose chase or not.\"  \"Why, no doubt has ever entered your head that the ivory is there?\" questioned Harry.  \"Well, old fellow, you know there are others interested in this ivory beside ourselves--Muley-Hassan for instance.\"  \"You think he had got ahead of us?\"  \"I did not say I thought so, I only say that it is possible that he may have done so.\"  \"How could he have got wind of our coming?\"  \"In Africa there is a sort of underground wire for news,\" replied Frank.  \"I have no doubt that hundreds of natives far in the interior are by this time apprised of our coming.\"  Harry looked alarmed.  \"That's bad,\" he said.  \"Well, it couldn't be helped: but we may have other enemies nearer at hand.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"That I don't like the looks of that Portuguese fellow.  If he got wind of what we are doing he would be likely to ruin the whole object of our expedition.\"  \"That's so.  We'll have to get rid of him.\"  \"Well, we are going to, and if he won't go for gentle means we'll try rough ones.\"  \"Hullo, what's that?\" exclaimed Harry suddenly.  The flap at the end of the tent toward which both of their backs had been turned had been suddenly drawn aside and in one quick, backward glance Harry made out the smiling figure of de Barros standing in the doorway.  It might have been fancy, but he thought for a minute that the Portuguese had a peculiarly villainous expression on his dark, handsome features.  \"Ah, senors,\" he said, as Frank, with a quick movement swept the map off the table--but not before de Barros's quick eyes had spied it. Fearing to replace the precious chart in the strong box, while the Portuguese lingered, Frank tucked it into his pocket.  \"Ah, senors, good afternoon,\" grinned the unwelcome visitor.  \"I have come to say 'adios.'  I am going up the river to-night and may not see you again for a long time.\"  \"I am sorry to have you leave,\" said Frank with a heartfelt wish that de Barros would hasten his departure.  \"I knew you would be,\" smiled the Portuguese, \"but it is the lot of man to meet and part.  Adios, senors, I go to make ready.\"  He vanished as suddenly as he had come upon the scene.  \"What do you make of that?\" inquired Harry.  \"I don't know what to think.  I have an idea that he was listening to every word of our conversation just now and that he saw the map before I had time to sweep it off the table.\"  Harry looked vexed.  \"That's tough luck,\" he said.  \"If he overheard even a part of our talk he must realize the object of our presence in Africa.  And,\" he went on, \"I don't know a man on the Dark Continent whom I would trust less than Diego de Barros, even the little we've seen of him.\"  \"It can't be helped now,\" said Frank briefly; \"come on, let's go and put the finishing touches on the good old Eagle.\"  They worked the rest of the afternoon putting the big aeroplane in shape for her flight to the Moon Mountains which it had been determined to make the next day.  It was almost dusk when Harry, who was working over the engines, asked Frank for the reserve park-plug box.  \"It's in one of the canoes.  I'll go and get it,\" said Frank, and at once set off toward the river bank for that purpose.  His path led through a thick grove of bamboos which hid him from the view of the camp after he had traversed a short distance.  As he merged on the river bank, whistling softly to himself, the young leader suddenly felt himself pinioned by arms that seemed of enormous strength--though, as the attack had come from behind, he could not see the faces of his assailants.  The next minute he was lying flat on his back, bound and helpless with a bit of greasy cloth shoved in his mouth for a gag.  \"Keep still, senor, and you shall not be hurt;\" said a quiet voice near at hand, and Frank saw bending above him the sallow features of the smiling Portuguese.  \"I just have to trouble you for that map I saw you put in your pocket, that is all,\" went on his captor, while the two huge negroes who had made Frank prisoner stood to one side immovable as carved figures.  \"It is lucky for me that you came down to the river bank,\" grinned the Portuguese as he ran his hand over Frank's clothes, to ascertain the hiding-place of the precious map of the ivory cache, \"otherwise I should have had to delay my departure till to-night, and possibly have cut your throat while you slept.\"  Frank felt as if his heart would burst with rage and mortification as the greasy, smiling Portuguese deliberately drew out the priceless document and gazed at it in triumph.  He laid it on the ground beside him while lie resumed his search for other clues.  \"That ivory belongs to my master--Muley-Hassan--now,\" he sneered; \"did you think for a minute that we would ever let you white fools get it back again.\"  It was well for the Portuguese that Frank's hands were not free then.  Had they been the dark-skinned traitor would have had a fight on his hands in a "]]]
