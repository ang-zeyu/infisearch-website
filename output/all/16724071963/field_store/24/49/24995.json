Sir, if that were so, it would be true that:            'As one by one in dread Medea's train,           Star after Star fades off th' ethereal plain,           Thus at her fell approach and secret might,           Art after art goes out, and all is night.           Philosophy, that leaned on Heaven before,           Sinks to her second cause, and is no more.           Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires,           And, unawares, Morality expires.'  \"Sir, we will not risk these consequences, even for Slavery; we will not risk these consequences even for Union; we will not risk these consequences to avoid that Civil War with which you threaten us; that War which, you announce so deadly, and which you declare to be inevitable.  * * *  I will never yield to the idea that the great Government of this Country shall protect Slavery in any Territory now ours, or hereafter to be acquired.  It is, in my opinion, a great principle of Free Government, not, to be surrendered.  \"It is in my judgment, the object of the great battle which we have fought, and which we have won.  It is, in my poor opinion, the point upon which there is concord and agreement between the great masses of the North, who may agree in no other political opinion whatever.  Be he Republican, or Democrat, or Douglas man, or Lincoln man; be he from the North, or the West, from Oregon, or from Maine, in my judgment nine-tenths of the entire population of the North and West are devoted, in the very depths of their hearts, to the great Constitutional idea that Freedom is the rule, that Slavery is the exception, that it ought not to be extended by virtue of the powers of the Government of the United States; and, come weal, come woe, it never shall be.  \"But, sir, I add one other thing.  When you talk to me about Compromise or Concession, I am not sure that I always understand you.  Do you mean that I am to give up my convictions of right?  Armies cannot compel that in the breast of a Free People.  Do you mean that I am to concede the benefits of the political struggle through which we have passed, considered politically, only?  You are too just and too generous to ask that.  Do you mean that we are to deny the great principle upon which our political action has been based?  You know we cannot.  But if you mean by Compromise and Concession to ask us to see whether we have not been hasty, angry, passionate, excited, and in many respects violated your feelings, your character, your right of property, we will look; and, as I said yesterday, if we have, we will undo it.  Allow me to say again, if there be any lawyer or any Court that will advise us that our laws are unconstitutional, we will repeal them.  \"Now as to territory.  I will not yield one inch to Secession; but there are things that I will yield, and there are things to which I will yield.  It is somewhere told that when Harold of England received a messenger from a brother with whom he was at variance, to inquire on what terms reconciliation and peace could be effected between brothers, he replied in a gallant and generous spirit in a few words, 'the, terms I offer are the affection of a brother; and the Earldom of Northumberland.'  And, said the Envoy, as he marched up the Hall amid the warriors that graced the state of the King, 'if Tosti, thy brother, agree to this, what terms will you allow to his ally and friend, Hadrada, the giant.'  'We will allow,' said Harold, 'to Hadrada, the giant, seven feet of English ground, and if he be, as they say, a giant, some few inches more!' and, as he spake, the Hall rang with acclamation.  \"Sir, in that spirit I speak.  I follow, at a humble distance, the ideas and the words of Clay, illustrious, to be venerated, and honored, and remembered, forever.  * * *  He said--I say: that I will yield no inch, no word, to the threat of Secession, unconstitutional, revolutionary, dangerous, unwise, at variance with the heart and the hope of all mankind save themselves.  To that I yield nothing; but if States loyal to the Constitution, if people magnanimous and just, desiring a return of fraternal feeling, shall come to us and ask for Peace, for permanent, enduring peace and affection, and say, 'What will you grant?  I say to them, 'Ask all that a gentleman ought to propose, and I will yield all that a gentleman ought to offer.'  Nay, more: if you are galled because we claim the right to prohibit Slavery in territory now Free, or in any Territory which acknowledges our jurisdiction, we will evade--I speak but for myself--I will aid in evading that question; I will agree to make it all States, and let the People decide at once.  I will agree to place them in that condition where the prohibition of Slavery will never be necessary to justify ourselves to our consciences or to our constituents.  I will agree to anything which is not to force upon me the necessity of protecting Slavery in the name of Freedom.  To that I never can and never will yield.\"  The speeches of Seward, of Douglas, of Crittenden, of Andrew Johnson, of Baker, and others, in behalf of the Union, and those of Benjamin, Davis, Wigfall, Lane, and others, in behalf of Secession, did much toward fixing the responsibility for the approaching bloody conflict where it belonged.  The speeches of Andrew Johnson of Tennessee--who, if he at a subsequent period of the Nation's history, proved himself not the worthiest son of the Republic, at this critical time, at all events, did grand service in the National Senate--especially had great and good effect on the public mind in the Northern and Border States.  They were, therefore, gall and wormwood to the Secession leaders, who hoped to drag the Border States into the great Southern Confederacy of States already in process of formation.  Their irritation was shown in threats of personal violence to Mr. Johnson, as when Wigfall--replying February 7th, 1861, to the latter's speech, said, \"Now if the Senator wishes to denounce Secession and Nullification eo nomine, let him go back and denounce Jefferson; let him denounce Jackson, if he dare, and go back and look that Tennessee Democracy in the face, and see whether they will content themselves with riddling his effigy!\"  It would seem also, from another part of Wigfall's reply, that the speeches of Union Senators had been so effective that a necessity was felt on the part of the Southern Conspirators to still further attempt to justify Secession by shifting the blame to Northern shoulders, for, while referring to the Presidential canvass of 1860--and the attitude of the Southern Secession leaders during that exciting period--he said: \"We (Breckinridge-Democrats) gave notice, both North and South, that if Abraham Lincoln was elected, this Union was dissolved.  I never made a speech during the canvass without asserting that fact.  * * *  Then, I say, that our purpose was not to dissolve the Union; but the dire necessity has been put upon us.  The question is, whether we shall live longer in a Union in which a Party, hostile to us in every respect, has the power in Congress, in the Executive department, and in the Electoral Colleges--a Party who will have the power even in the Judiciary.  We think it is not safe.  We say that each State has the clear indisputable right to withdraw if she sees fit; and six of the States have already withdrawn, and one other State is upon the eve of withdrawing, if she has not already done so.  How far this will spread no man can tell!\"  As tending to show the peculiar mixture of brag, cajolery, and threats, involved in the attitude of the South, as expressed by the same favorite Southern mouthpiece, toward the Border-States on the one hand, and the Middle and New England States on the other, a further extract from this (February 7th) speech of the Texan Senator may be of interest.  Said he:  \"With exports to the amount of hundreds of millions of dollars, our imports must be the same.  With a lighter Tariff than any people ever undertook to live under, we could have larger revenue.  We would be able to stand Direct Taxation to a greater extent than any people ever could before, since the creation of the World.  We feel perfectly competent to meet all issues that may be presented, either by hostility from abroad or treason at home.  So far as the Border-States are concerned, it is a matter that concerns them alone.  Should they confederate with us, beyond all doubt New England machinery will be worked with the water power of Tennessee, of Kentucky, of Virginia and of Maryland; the Tariff laws that now give New England the monopoly in the thirty-three States, will give to these Border States a monopoly in the Slave-holding States. Should the non-Slave-holding States choose to side against us in organizing their Governments, and cling to their New England brethren, the only result will be, that the meat, the horses, the hemp, and the grain, which we now buy in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in Indiana and Illinois, will be purchased in Kentucky and in Western Virginia and in Missouri.  Should Pennsylvania stand out, the only result will be, that the iron which is now dug in Pennsylvania, will be dug in the mountains of Tennessee and of Virginia and of Kentucky and of North Carolina. These things we know.  \"We feel no anxiety at all, so far as money or men are concerned.  We desire War with nobody; we intend to make no War; but we intend to live under just such a Government as we see fit.  Six States have left this Union, and others are going to leave it simply because they choose to do it; that is all.  We do not ask your consent; we do not wish it.  We have revoked our ratification of the Treaty commonly known as the Constitution of the United States; a treaty for common defense and general welfare; and we shall be perfectly willing to enter into another Treaty with you, of peace and amity.  Reject the olive branch and offer us the sword, and we accept it; we have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7134"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 2 (#8)"],["body"," the slightest objection. Upon that subject we feel as the great William Lowndes felt upon another important subject, the Presidency, which he said was neither to be sought nor declined.  When you invade our soil, look to your own borders.  You say that you have too many people, too many towns, too dense a population, for us to invade you.  I say to you Senators, that there is nothing that ever stops the march of an invading force, except a desert.  The more populous a country, the more easy it is to subsist an army.\"  After declaring that--\"Not only are our non-Slaveholders loyal, but even our Negroes are.  We have no apprehensions whatever of insurrection--not the slightest.  We can arm our negroes, and leave them at home, when we are temporarily absent\"--Mr. Wigfall proceeded to say: \"We may as well talk plainly about this matter.  This is probably the last time I shall have an opportunity of addressing you.  There is another thing that an invading army cannot do.  It cannot burn up plantations.  You can pull down fences, but the Negroes will put them up the next morning.  The worst fuel that ever a man undertook to make fire with, is dirt; it will not burn.  Now I have told you what an invading army cannot do.  Suppose I reverse the picture and tell you what it can do.  An invading army in an enemy's country, where there is a dense population, can subsist itself at a very little cost; it does not always pay for what it gets. An invading army can burn down towns; an invading army can burn down manufactories; and it can starve operatives.  It can do all these things.  But an Invading army, and an army to defend a Country, both require a military chest.  You may bankrupt every man south of North Carolina, so that his credit is reduced to such a point that he could not discount a note for thirty dollars, at thirty days; but the next autumn those Cotton States will have just as much money and as much credit as they had before.  They pick money off the cotton plant.  Every time that a Negro touches a cotton-pod with his hand, he pulls a piece of silver out of it, and he drops it into the basket in which it is carried to the gin-house.  It is carried to the packing screw.  A bale of cotton rolls out-in other words, five ten-dollar pieces roll out --covered with canvas.  We shall never again make less than five million bales of cotton.  * * *  We can produce five million bales of cotton, every bale worth fifty dollars, which is the lowest market price it has been for years past.  We shall import a bale of something else, for every bale of cotton that we export, and that bale will be worth fifty dollars.  We shall find no difficulty under a War-Tariff in raising an abundance of money.  We have been at Peace for a very long time, We are very prosperous.  Our planters use their cotton, not to buy the necessaries of life, but for the superfluities, which they can do without.  The States themselves have a mine of wealth in the loyalty and the wealth of their citizens.  Georgia, Mississippi, any one of those States can issue its six per cent. bonds tomorrow, and receive cotton in payment to the extent almost of the entire crop.  They can first borrow from their own citizens; they can tax them to an almost unlimited extent; and they can raise revenue from a Tariff to an almost unlimited extent.  \"How will it be with New England?  where will their revenue come from? From your Custom-houses?  what do you export?  You have been telling us here for the last quarter of a century, that you cannot manufacture, even for the home market, under the Tariffs which we have given you. When this Tariff ceases to operate in your favor, and you have to pay for coming into our markets, what will you export?  When your machinery ceases to move, and your operatives are turned out, will you tax your broken capitalist or your starving operative?  When the navigation laws cease to operate, what will become of your shipping interest?  You are going to blockade our ports, you say.  That is a very innocent game; and you suppose we shall sit quietly down and submit to a blockade.  I speak not of foreign interference, for we look not for it.  We are just as competent to take Queen Victoria and Louis Napoleon under our protection, as they are to take us; and they are a great deal more interested to-day in receiving cotton from our ports than we are in shipping it.  You may lock up every bale of cotton within the limits of the eight Cotton States, and not allow us to export one for three years, and we shall not feel it further than our military resources are concerned.  Exhaust the supply of cotton in Europe for one week, and all Europe is in revolution.  \"These are facts.  You will blockade us!  Do you suppose we shall do nothing, even upon the sea?  How many letters of marque and reprisal would it take to put the whole of your ships up at your wharves to rot? Will any merchant at Havre, or Liverpool, or any other portion of the habitable globe, ship a cargo upon a New England, or New York, or Philadelphia clipper, or other ship, when he knows that the seas are swarming with letters of marque and reprisal?  Why the mere apprehension of such a thing will cut you out of the Carrying Trade of the civilized World.  * * *  I speak not of the absurdity of the position that you can blockade our ports, admitting at the same time that we are in the Union. Blockade is a remedy, as all writers on International law say, against a Foreign Power with whom you are at War.  You cannot use a blockade against your own people.  An embargo even, you cannot use.  That is a remedy against a Foreign Nation with whom you expect to be at War.  You must treat us as in the Union, or out of it.  We have gone out.  We are willing to live at peace with you; but, as sure as fate, whenever any flag comes into one of our ports, that has thirty-three stars upon it, that flag will be fired at.  Displaying a flag with stars which we have plucked from that bright galaxy, is an insult to the State within whose waters that flag is displayed.  You cannot enforce the laws without Coercion, and you cannot Coerce without War.  \"These matters, then, can be settled.  How?  By withdrawing your troops; admitting our right to Self-government clearly, unqualifiedly.  Do this, and there is no difficulty about it.  You say that you will not do it. Very well; we have no objection--none whatever.  That is Coercion.  When you have attempted it, you will find that you have made War.  These, Senators, are facts.  I come here to plead for Peace; but I have seen so much and felt so much, that I am becoming at last, to tell the plain truth of the matter, rather indifferent as to which way the thing turns. If you want War, you can have it.  If you want Peace, you can get it; but I plead not for Peace.\"  Meanwhile the Seceding States of the South were strengthening their attitude by Confederation.  On February 4, 1861, the Convention of Seceding States, called by the South Carolina Convention at the time of her Secession, met, in pursuance of that call, at Montgomery, Alabama, and on the 9th adopted a Provisional Constitution and organized a Provisional Government by the election of Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, as President, and Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, as Vice-President; to serve until a Presidential election could be held by the people of the Confederacy.       [At a later day, March 11, 1861, a permanent Constitution for the      \"Confederate States\" was adopted, and, in the Fall of the same      year, Messrs.  Davis and Stephens were elected by popular vote, for      the term of six years ensuing, as President and Vice-President,      respectively, of the Confederacy.]  Mr. Davis almost at once left Jackson, Mississippi, for Montgomery, where he arrived and delivered his Inaugural, February 17, having received on his road thither a succession of ovations from the enthusiastic Rebels, to which he had responded with no less than twenty-five speeches, very similar in tone to those made in the United States Senate by Mr. Wigfall and others of that ilk--breathing at once defiance and hopefulness, while admitting the difficulties in the way of the new Confederacy.  \"It may be,\" said he, at Jackson, \"that we will be confronted by War; that the attempt will be made to blockade our ports, to starve us out; but they (the Union men of the North) know little of the Southern heart, of Southern endurance.  No amount of privation could force us to remain in a Union on unequal terms.  England and France would not allow our great staple to be dammed up within our present limits; the starving thousands in their midst would not allow it.  We have nothing to apprehend from Blockade.  But if they attempt invasion by land, we must take the War out of our territory.  If War must come, it must be upon Northern, and not upon Southern soil.  In the meantime, if they were prepared to grant us Peace, to recognize our equality, all is well.\"  And, in his speech at Stevenson, Alabama, said he \"Your Border States will gladly come into the Southern Confederacy within sixty days, as we will be their only friends.  England will recognize us, and a glorious future is before us.  The grass will grow in the Northern cities, where the pavements have been worn off by the tread of Commerce.  We will carry War where it is easy to advance--where food for the sword and torch await our Armies in the densely populated cities; and though they may come and spoil our crops, we can raise them as before; while they cannot rear the cities which took years of industry and millions of money to build.\"  Very different in tone to these, were the kindly and sensible utterances of Mr. Lincoln on his journey from Springfield to Washington, about the same time, for Inauguration as President of the United States.  Leaving Springfield, Illinois, February 11th, he had pathetically said:  \"My friends: No one, not in my position, can realize the sadness"]]]
