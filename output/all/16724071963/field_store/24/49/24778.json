Melville never lost his nerve though.  \"'We'll be all right, Ben,' says he to me, and though I didn't feel near so confident, still I chirped up a little for I had been feeling pretty blue, I tell you.  \"Right after we had had a bite to eat he starts in hammering away at the wireless, sending out calls for help while I just sat around and hoped something would turn up. Some observations we took showed that we had not drifted very much further from land in the night on account of there being no wind. This looked good for it meant that we were, or should be, in the path of ships. The only thing that worried me was that mighty few coasting vessels carry wireless, and I was surprised when we got an answer from what I knew later was the Southern Cross.  \"It was just as Melville was getting your answer that I noticed the bag. The air had grown hot as an oven as the sun rose higher and about noon I looked up just to see if there wasn't a cloud in the sky that might mean a storm, and perhaps a change of wind that maybe would blow us back over land again. What I saw scared me. The bag was blown out as tight as the skin of a sausage, and it didn't look to me as if it could swell much more without busting.  \"I pointed it out to Melville and he went up in the air--worried to death.  \"'The gas is expanding,' he explains, 'it's the sun that's doing it. If we don't let some gas out we'll bust.'  \"And if we do we'll drop into the sea,\" says I.  \"'Yes, that's very likely,' he replied, as cool as a cucumber, 'when the evening comes and the gas condenses, with what we've lost, if we pull the valve open, we won't have enough to keep the ship in the air.'  \"'There's only one thing to do,' he went on, 'we must wait till this ship I've been speaking to by wireless comes in sight. Then we'll take a chance. If the worst comes to worst we can float about till they pick us up.'  \"That seemed a good plan to me and I never gave the sharks a thought. But when you drew near and it seemed as if the bag was going to bust in a second's time and we tried to open the valve--we couldn't. The halliards that work it had got twisted in the gale that blew us out to sea and they wouldn't come untangled.  \"Melville takes a look at the pressure gauge. Then he gave a long whistle.  \"'If we don't do something she'll bust in five seconds,' he says.  \"Then I suddenly made up my mind. Without saying a word to him I kicked off my boots and started to climb into the rigging.  \"'What are you going to do?' asked Melville.  \"Open that valve, says I.  \"We saw you climbing and could not imagine what you were doing,\" put in Billy.  \"Wall,\" continued the old sailor, \"I managed fine at first, although that thar gas sausage was stretched as smooth and tight as a drum. The network around it gave me a foothold though, and once I was half-way round the lower bulge of the bag--where I was clinging on upside down,--I was all right.  \"I had the valve lever in my hand and was just going to open it when I felt everything cave in around me like something had been pulled from under my feet--or as if I had been sitting on a cloud and it had melted.  \"The dirigible had blown up.  \"Luckily I kept my wits about me and deliberately made a dive for the sea. It was a good height but I struck it clean. Down and down I went till I thought I'd never come up again. My ear-drums felt like they'd bust and my head seemed to have been hit with an axe. But come up I did eventually as you know, and found poor George Melville there, too. Of the dirigible there was not so much of as a match-stick left. The rest you know.\"  Ben's voice shook a little as he reached the latter part of his narrative. The rugged sailor's face grew soft and he winked back a tear. The others said nothing for a few seconds and then Captain Hazzard looked up.  \"Since you have become one of us in such a strange way, I presume you would like to know where we are bound for?\"  \"Wall, if it ain't askin' too much I would,\" rejoined the rugged adventurer.  \"We are bound for the South Pole.\"  Ben never flicked an eyelid.  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" was all he said.  \"I have a proposition to make to you,\" continued the captain. \"We need a bos'n, will you sign on? If you do not care to we will put you ashore at the first convenient port or hail a homeward-bound ship and have you transferred.\"  The old sailor looked positively hurt.  \"What; me lose an opportunity to see the South Pole, to shoot Polar bears--\"  \"There aren't any,\" put in Billy.  \"Wall, whatever kind of critters there are there,\" went on the old man, \"no, sir; Ben Stubbs ain't the man to hold back on a venture like this. Sign me on as bos'n, and if I don't help nail Uncle Sam's colors to the South Pole call me a doodle-bug.\"  \"A doodle-bug,\" exclaimed Professor Sandburr, \"What kind of a bug is that? If you know where to find them I hope you will catch one and forward it to me.\"  Ben grinned.  \"I guess doodle-bugs is like South Polar bears,\" he said.  \"How is that, my dear sea-faring friend?\"  \"There ain't any,\" laughed Ben, blotting his big, scrawling signature on the ship's books.  On and on toward the Pole plied the Southern Cross. One night when she was about two hundred miles at sea off the mouth of the Amazon, the boys, as it was one of the soft tropical nights peculiar to those regions, were all grouped forward trying to keep cool and keeping a sharp lookout for the real Southern Cross. This wonderful, heavenly body might be expected to be visible almost any night now, Captain Hazzard had told them. Old Ben shared their watch.  The little group was seated right on the forefoot or \"over-hang\" of the polar ship, their legs dangling over the bow above the water. Beneath their feet they could see the bright phosphorous gleam as the ship ploughed onward. They were rather silent. In fact, except for desultory conversation, the throb of the engines and the regular sounding of the ship's bell as it marked the hours were the only sounds to be heard.  It was past eight bells and everyone on the ship but the helmsman had turned in, leaving the boys and Ben on watch, when there came a terrific shock that caused the vessel to quiver and creak as if she had run bow on into solid land. Captain Hazzard was thrown from his bunk and all over the vessel there was the wildest confusion.  Shouts and cries filled the air as Captain Hazzard, not able to imagine what had happened rushed out on deck in his night clothes. The sky had become overcast and it was terribly black. It was hardly possible for one to see his hand before his face. A heavy sulphurous smell was in the air.  \"What is it? What has happened? Did we hit another ship?\" shouted Captain Barrington, appearing from his cabin.  The helmsman could give no explanation. There had been a sudden shock and he had been knocked off his feet. What had struck the ship or what she had struck he could not make out. Captain Barrington knew there were no rocks so far out at sea and he also knew that he could not be near land. The only explanation was a collision with another ship, but had that been the case surely, he argued, they would have heard shouts and cries on the other vessel.  \"Send forward for the boys and Ben Stubbs, they had the watch,\" he commanded.  A man hurried forward to execute his order but he was soon back with a white scared face.  \"The young lads and Bos'n Stubbs aren't there,\" he exclaimed in a frightened tone.  \"Not there,\" repeated Captain Hazzard.  \"No, sir. Not a trace of them. Beggin' your pardon, sir, I think it's ghosts.\"  \"Don't talk nonsense,\" sharply commanded his superior. \"Have the ship searched for them.\"  \"Very good, sir,\" and the man, with a tug at his forelock, hastened away to spread the word.  But a search of every nook and cranny of the ship only added to the mystery.  Neither the boys nor Ben were to be found.  Had ghosts indeed snatched them into aerial regions, as some of the more superstitious men seemed inclined to believe they could not have vanished more utterly.     CHAPTER VI.  A STRANGE COLLISION.   We must now turn back and ascertain what has become of our young adventurers and their rugged old companion. We left them sitting on the bow--or rather perched there in positions none too secure in case of a sudden lurch of the ship.  \"I smell land,\" had been Ben's sudden exclamation after one of the prolonged silences which, as has been said, possessed them that night.  The boys laughed.  \"Laugh away,\" declared Ben, \"but I do. Any old sailor can tell it.\"  \"But we are two hundred miles at sea,\" objected Frank.  \"Don't make no difference, I smell land,\" stubbornly repeated the old sailor.  \"Maybe the wind is off shore and that's the reason,\" suggested Billy.  \"A sensible suggestion, youngster,\" approved Ben. \"I guess that is the reason for there is no island in this part of the world that I ever heard tell of. But say,\" he broke off suddenly, \"what's come over the weather. It's getting black and the stars are blotted out. There's a storm brewing and a bad one, or I'm mistaken.\"  The boys agreed that there did seem to be every indication of an approaching tropical disturbance of some kind. The air had suddenly grown heavy and sulphurous. There was an oppressive quality in it.  \"I'm going aft to tell the captain that there's a bad blow coming on or I'm a Dutchman,\" exclaimed Ben, starting to scramble to his feet.  \"Better hold onto that stay or you'll topple overboard,\" warned Frank, as Ben, balancing himself, got into a standing posture.  \"What me, an old sailor topple over,\" shouted Ben, \"Not much younker, why I--\"  The sentence was never finished. At that instant the shock that had aroused Captain Hazzard and terrified the whole ship's company hurled him headlong into the night and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6973"],["title","The Boy Aviators' Polar Dash; or, Facing Death in the Antarctic (#6)"],["body","s, balanced as they were on the prow of the trembling ship, were shot after him into the darkness as if they had been hurled out of catapults.  Frank's feelings as he fell through the darkness he could not afterward describe, still less his amazement when, instead of falling into the sea, fully prepared to swim for his life, he found himself instead plunged into a sticky ooze. For several seconds, in fact, he was too amazed to utter a sound or move. It seemed he must be dreaming.  Then he extended his hands and almost gave a cry so great was his amazement.  He had encountered an unmistakable tree trunk!  He was on land--not dry land--for the boy was mired to the knees in sticky mud,--but nevertheless land. Land in midocean.  Hardly had he recovered from his first shock of surprise when he heard a voice exclaim:  \"Can anyone tell me am I awake or dreaming in my bunk?\"  \"What's the matter, Billy?\" hailed Frank, overjoyed to know that one at least of his comrades was safe.  Before Billy could reply Harry's voice hailed through the darkness.  \"I'm up to my neck in mud. Where are we, anyhow?\"  \"We're on dry land in midocean, shiver my timbers if we ain't,\" came a deep throated hail, which proceeded from Ben Stubbs.  \"Thank heaven we are all safe anyhow,\" cried Frank, \"this mud is mighty uncomfortable, though.\"  \"Well, if it hadn't been here we'd have been eaten by sharks by this time,\" Billy assured them; an observation all felt to be true.  \"Where can the ship be?\" exclaimed Harry's voice suddenly.  \"Miles off by this time,\" said Frank. \"I don't suppose they have even missed us and even if they have it's so black they could never find us.\"  \"Let's see where we are,\" suggested Ben, \"anyhow I'm going to try to get out of this mud. It's like a pig-pen.\"  His observation struck the boys as a good suggestion and they all wallowed in a direction they deemed was forward and soon were rewarded for their efforts by finding themselves on real dry land. By stretching out their hands they could feel tree trunks and dense brush all about them.  \"It's no dream,\" declared Frank, \"we are really on land. But where?\"  \"Maybe the ship was way off her course and we are stranded on the coast of Brazil,\" suggested Harry.  \"Not likely,\" corrected Ben, \"and besides if we'd hit land the ship would be ashore.\"  \"Then what can we be on?\" demanded Frank.  \"Give it up,\" said Billy.  \"Anybody got a match?\" asked Frank.  Luckily there were no lack of these and as the boys carried them in the waterproof boxes they had used on their previous expeditions they were dry. Some were soon struck and a bonfire built of the brush and wood they found about them.  It was a strange tropical scene the glare illuminated. All about were palm trees and tropic growth of various kinds; many of the plants bearing fruits unfamiliar to the boys. Some large birds, scared by the light, flapped screaming out of the boughs above them as the bonfire blazed up. They could now see that they had been pitched out of the ship onto a muddy beach, the ooze of which stuck to their clothes like clay. The spot in which they stood was a few feet above the sea level.  \"Well, there's no use trying to do anything till daylight,\" said Frank, \"we had better sleep as well as we can and start out to try and find a house of some sort in the morning.\"  All agreed this was a good plan and soon they were wrapped in slumber. Frank's sleep was restless and broken, however, and once or twice he had an uneasy feeling that something or somebody was prowling about the \"camp.\" Once he could have sworn he saw a pair of eyes, like two flaming points of fire, glare at him out of the blackness; but as it was not repeated, he assured himself that it was only his nervous imagination and composed himself to sleep once more.  A sharp thunder storm raged above them shortly before daybreak and they were compelled to seek what shelter they could under a fallen tree trunk. The storm was the one that had blackened the sky some hours before. Luckily it was as short as it was sharp, and when the sun rose it showed them a scene of glistening tropic beauty.  But the boys had little eye for scenery.  \"What are we going to do for breakfast?\" was Billy's manner of voicing the general question that beset them all after they had washed off some of the mud of the night before.  \"Tighten our belts,\" grinned Harry.  \"Not much; not while them oysters is there waiting to be picked,\" exclaimed Ben pointing to some branches which dipped in the sea and to which bunches of the bivalves were clinging.  \"I've got some biscuits in my pocket,\" said Frank, \"I brought them on deck with me last night in case I got hungry on watch.\"  \"Well, we'll do fine,\" cheerfully said Ben, as having heated some stones he set the oysters to broil on them.  Despite his cheerful tone, however, not one of the little party was there that did not think with longing regrets of the snowy linen and bountiful meals aboard the Southern Cross.  Breakfast over, Ben announced that the first thing to do was to try to find out where they could be. It was agreed for this purpose to advance along the beach for five miles or so in opposite directions, the group being formed into two parties for the purpose. Harry and Frank paired off in one party and Ben Stubbs and Billy formed the other. They were to meet at noon or as soon thereafter as possible and compare notes.  Frank and Harry tramped resolutely along the beach under a baking hot sun till they felt as if they were going to drop, but they held pluckily on, fortunately having found several springs along their line of march.  From time to time they eagerly scanned the expanse of sparkling sea that stretched before them; but it was as empty of life as a desert.  \"Do you suppose the ship will make a search for us?\" asked Frank.  \"How can we tell,\" rejoined his brother, \"they will have found out we are gone by this time and will naturally conclude that we fell overboard and were drowned or eaten by sharks.\"  Both agreed that such was probably likely to be the fact and that if the coast on which they were cast away proved to be uninhabited their situation might be very serious.  \"On the other hand, the ship may have gone down after the collision,\" suggested Harry, \"how she ever came to graze this land and then escape I can't make out.\"  \"I've been puzzling over that, too,\" replied Frank, \"there's a lot that's very mysterious about this whole thing. The Southern Cross is, as you know, equipped with a submarine bell which should give warning when she approaches shallow water. Why didn't it sound last night?\"  \"Because there must be deep water right up to this coast,\" was the only explanation Harry could offer.  \"That's just it,\" argued his brother. \"But what is a coast doing here at all. We are two hundred miles out in the South Atlantic, or rather, we were last night.\"  \"The charts don't show any land out there, do they?\"  \"Not so much as a pin point. Some of the deepest parts of the ocean are encountered there.\"  \"Then the ship must have been off her course.\"  \"It seems impossible. She is in charge of experienced navigators. Her compasses and other instruments are the most perfect of their kind.\"  \"Maybe it is a dream after all, and we'll wake up and find ourselves in our bunks,\" was all Harry could say.  Before Frank could find anything to reply to this extraordinary suggestion he gave a sudden tense cry of:  \"Hark!\"  Both boys stopped and above their quick breathing they could hear the beating of their hearts.  Human voices were coming toward them.  Luckily Frank had his revolver, having been using it the day before in shooting at huge turtles that floated lazily by. He had by a lucky oversight neglected to take it off when he had finished his target practice, merely thrusting it back into its holster. He drew the weapon now, and grasping Harry by the arm pulled him down beside him into a clump of brush.  \"We'll hide here till we see who it is coming,\" he said.     CHAPTER VII.  ADRIFT ON A FLOATING ISLAND.   The voices grew nearer and suddenly to his amazement Frank heard his own name mentioned. The next moment both lads broke into a loud exclamation of surprise.  Those approaching their place of concealment were Billy Barnes and Ben Stubbs.  It would be difficult to say which pair of adventurers were more astonished as they met on the beach.  \"Shiver my timbers!\" exclaimed Ben, \"whar did you boys come from? Did you turn back?\"  \"Turn back?\" echoed Frank, \"no, we've been keeping right on.\"  \"Wall,\" drawled Ben, \"then what I was afeard of at first is true.\"  \"What's that, Ben?\"  \"Why, that we are on an island.\"  \"On an island!\"  \"Yes, a floating island.\"  For a moment they were all dumb with amazement. Then Ben went on:  \"I've heard old sailors tell of such things off of this yer coast. These islands--as they are called--are nothing more or less than huge sections of forest torn from the banks of the Amazon when it is in flood and floated out ter sea on its current.\"  \"But how can they keep afloat?\" asked Harry.  \"Why the tangled roots and tree limbs keep 'em up for a long time,\" rejoined Ben, \"and then they sink.\"  \"I hope our island isn't sinking,\" exclaimed Frank, anxiously looking about him.  \"Not much fear of that; but it's moving, all right,\" replied the old sailor, \"just fix your eyes on that cloud for a minute.\"  The boys did as directed, and, sure enough, the island, as they now knew it, was moving slowly along, doubtless urged by some current of the ocean.  \"Suppose the ship never finds us,\" gasped Billy.  \"Now, just put thoughts like that out of your head, youngster,\" exclaimed Ben sharply. \"I've been in worse fixes than this and got out of them. What we had best do now is to gather up some of those big cocoanuts that's scattered about there and make waterholders out of them.\"  \"But there's plenty of water flowing from the springs. We passed several of them,\" objected Harry.  \"That's just the water that"]]]
