The response was immediate.  \"The loidy says she's gone out, sir, and ain't likely to be back,\" remarked the top-lofty buttons, upon his return.  I was so maddened by this slight, and so thoroughly apprehensive of further trouble from the infernal shade, that I resolved without more ado to sneak out of England and back to America before the deadly blighting thing was aware of my intentions. I immediately left the Savoy, and sought the office of the Green Star Line, secured a room on the steamer sailing the next morning--the _Digestic_--from Liverpool, and was about packing up my belongings, when _it_ turned up again.  \"Going away, eh?\"  \"Yes,\" I replied, shortly, and then I endeavored to deceive him. \"I've been invited down to Leamington to spend a week with my old friend Dr. Liverton.\"  \"Oh, indeed!\" he observed. \"Thanks for the address. I will not neglect you during your stay there. Be prepared for a shove that will turn your hair gray. _Au revoir._\"  And he vanished, muttering the address I had given him--\"Dr. Liverton, Leamington--Dr. Liverton.\" To which he added, \"I won't forget _that,_ not by a jugful.\"  I chuckled softly to myself as he disappeared. \"He's clever, but-- there are others,\" I said, delighted at the ease with which I had rid myself of him; and then eating a hearty luncheon, I took the train to Liverpool, where next morning I embarked on the _Digestic_ for New York.     II--AN UNHAPPY VOYAGE   The sense of relief that swept over me when the great anchor of the _Digestic_ came up from the unstrained quality of the Mersey, and I thought of the fact that shortly a vast ocean would roll between me and that fearful spook, was one of the most delightful emotions that it has ever been my good fortune to experience. Now all seemed serene, and I sought my cabin belowstairs, whistling gayly; but, alas! how fleeting is happiness, even to a whistler!  As I drew near to the room which I had fondly supposed was to be my own exclusively I heard profane remarks issuing therefrom. There was condemnation of the soap; there was perdition for the lighting apparatus; there were maledictions upon the location of the port, and the bedding was excommunicate.  \"This is strange,\" said I to the steward. \"I have engaged this room for the passage. I hear somebody in there.\"  \"Not at all, sir,\" said he, opening the door; \"it is empty.\" And to him it undoubtedly appeared to be so.  \"But,\" I cried, \"didn't you hear anything?\"  \"Yes, I did,\" he said, candidly; \"but I supposed you was a ventriloquist, sir, and was a-puttin' up of a game on me.\"  Here the steward smiled, and I was too angry to retort. And then-- Well, you have guessed it. _He_ turned up--and more vulgar than ever.  \"Hullo!\" he said, nonchalantly, fooling with a suit-case. \"Going over?\"  \"Oh no!\" I replied, sarcastic. \"Just out for a swim. When we get off the Banks I'm going to jump overboard and swim to the Azores on a wager.\"  \"How much?\" he asked.  \"Five bob,\" said I, feeling that he could not grasp a larger amount.  \"Humph!\" he ejaculated. \"I'd rather drive a cab--as I used to.\"  \"Ah?\" said I. \"That's what you were, eh? A cab-driver. Takes a mighty mind to be that, eh? Splendid intellectual effort to drive a cab from the Reform Club to the Bank, eh?\"  I had hoped to wither him.  \"Oh, I don't know,\" he answered, suavely. \"I'll tell you this, though: I'd rather go from the Club to the Bank on my hansom with me holding the reins than try to do it with Mr. Gladstone or the Prince o' Wiles on the box.\"  \"Prince o' Wiles?\" I said, with a withering manner.  \"That's what I said,\" he retorted. \"You would call him Prince of Whales, I suppose--like a Yank, a blooming Yank--because you think Britannia rules the waves.\"  I had to laugh; and then a plan of conciliation suggested itself. I would jolly him, as my political friends have it.  \"Have a drink?\" I asked.  \"No, thanks; I don't indulge,\" he replied. \"Let me offer you a cigar.\"  I accepted, and he extracted a very fair-looking weed from his box, which he handed me. I tried to bite off the end, succeeding only in biting my tongue, whereat the presence roared with laughter.  \"What's the joke now?\" I queried, irritated.  \"You,\" he answered. \"The idea of any one's being fool enough to try to bite off the end of a spook cigar strikes me as funny.\"  From that moment all thought of conciliation vanished, and I resorted to abuse.  \"You are a low-born thing!\" I shouted. \"And if you don't get out of here right away I'll break every bone in your body.\"  \"Very well,\" he answered, coolly, scribbling on a pad close at hand. \"There's the address.\"  \"What address?\" I asked.  \"Of the cemetery where those bones you are going to break are to be found. You go in by the side gate, and ask any of the grave-diggers where--\"  \"You infernal scoundrel!\" I shrieked, \"this is my room. I have bought and paid for it, and I intend to have it. Do you hear?\"  His response was merely the clapping of his hands together, and in a stage-whisper, leaning towards me, he said:  \"Bravo! Bravo! You are great. I think you could do Lear. Say those last words again, will you?\"  His calmness was too much for me, and I lost all control of myself. Picking up the water-bottle, I hurled it at him with all the force at my command. It crashed through him and struck the mirror over the wash-stand, and as the shattered glass fell with a loud noise to the floor the door to my state-room opened, and the captain of the ship, flanked by the room steward and the doctor, stood at the opening.  \"What's all this about?\" said the captain, addressing me.  \"I have engaged this room for myself alone,\" I said, trembling in my rage, \"and I object to that person's presence.\" Here I pointed at the intruder.  \"What person's presence?\" demanded the captain, looking at the spot where the haunting thing sat grinning indecently.  \"What person?\" I roared, forgetting the situation for the moment. \"Why, him--it--whatever you choose to call it. He's settled down here, and has been black-guarding me for twenty minutes, and, damn it, captain, I won't stand it!\"  \"It's a clear case,\" said the captain, with a sigh, turning and addressing the doctor. \"Have you a strait-jacket?\"  \"Thank you, captain,\" said I, calming down. \"It's what he ought to have, but it won't do any good. You see, he's not a material thing. He's buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, and so the strait-jacket won't help us.\"  Here the doctor stepped into the room and took me gently by the arm. \"Take off your clothes,\" he said, \"and lie down. You need quiet.\"  \"I?\" I demanded, not as yet realizing my position. \"Not by a long shot. Fire _him_ out. That's all I ask.\"  \"Take off your clothes and get into that bed,\" repeated the doctor, peremptorily. Then he turned to the captain and asked him to detail two of his sailors to help him. \"He's going to be troublesome,\" he added, in a whisper. \"Mad as a hatter.\"  I hesitate, in fact decline, to go through the agony of what followed again by writing of it in detail. Suffice it to say that the doctor persisted in his order that I should undress and go to bed, and I, conscious of the righteousness of my position, fought this determination, until, with the assistance of the steward and the two able-bodied seamen detailed by the captain at the doctor's request, I was forcibly unclad and thrown into the lower berth and strapped down. My wrath knew no bounds, and I spoke my mind as plainly as I knew how. It is a terrible thing to be sane, healthy, fond of deck-walking, full of life, and withal unjustly strapped to a lower berth below the water-line on a hot day because of a little beast of a cockney ghost, and I fairly howled my sentiments.  [Illustration: \"I WAS FORCIBLY UNCLAD\"]  On the second day from Liverpool two maiden ladies in the room next mine made representations to the captain which resulted in my removal to the steerage. They couldn't consent, they said, to listen to the shrieks of the maniac in the adjoining room.  And then, when I found myself lying on a cot in the steerage, still strapped down, who should appear but my little spectre.  \"Well,\" he said, sitting on the edge of the cot, \"what do you think of it now, eh? Ain't I a shover from Shoverville on the Push?\"  \"It's all right,\" I said, contemptuously. \"But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Spook: when I die and have a ghost of my own, that ghost will seek you out, and, by thunder, if it doesn't thrash the life out of you, I'll disown it!\"  It seemed to me that he paled a bit at this, but I was too tired to gloat over a little thing like that, so I closed my eyes and went to sleep. A few days later I was so calm and rational that the doctor released me, and for the remainder of my voyage I was as free as any other person on board, except that I found myself constantly under surveillance, and was of course much irritated by the notion that my spacious stateroom was not only out of my reach, but probably in the undisputed possession of the cockney ghost.  After seven days of ocean travel New York was reached, and I was allowed to step ashore without molestation. But my infernal friend turned up on the pier, and added injury to insult by declaring in my behalf certain dutiable articles in my trunks, thereby costing me some dollars which I should much rather have saved. Still, after the incidents of the voyage, I thought it well to say nothing, and accepted the hardships of the experience in the hope that in the far distant future my spook would meet his and thrash the very death out of him.  Well, things went on. The cockney spook left me to my own devices until November, when I had occasion to lecture at a certain college in the Northwest. I travelled from my home to the distant platform, went upon it, was introduced by the proper functionary, and began my lecture. In the middle of the talk, who should appear in a vacant chair well down towards the stage but the cockney ghost, with a guffaw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6995"],["title","Ghosts I Have Met and Some Others (#8)"],["body","a strong and not humorous point, which disconcerted me! I broke down and left the platform, and in the small room at the side encountered him.  \"Shove the fourth!\" he cried, and vanished.  It was then that I consulted Peters as to how best to be rid of him.  \"There is no use of talking about it,\" I said to Peters, \"the man is ruining me. Socially with the Travises I am an outcast, and I have no doubt they will tell about it, and my ostracism will extend. On the _Digestic_ my sanity is seriously questioned, and now for the first time in my life, before some two thousand people, I break down in a public lecture which I have delivered dozens of times hitherto without a tremor. The thing cannot go on.\"  \"I should say not,\" Peters answered. \"Maybe I can help you to get rid of him, but I'm not positive about it; my new scheme isn't as yet perfected. Have you tried the fire-extinguisher treatment?\"  I will say here, that Peters upon two occasions has completely annihilated unpleasant spectres by turning upon them the colorless and odorless liquids whose chemical action is such that fire cannot live in their presence.  \"Fire, the vital spark, is the essential element of all these chaps,\" said he, \"and if you can turn the nozzle of your extinguisher on that spook your ghost simply goes out.\"  \"No, I haven't,\" I replied; \"but I will the first chance I get.\" And I left him, hopeful if not confident of a successful exorcism.  On my return home I got out two of the extinguishers which were left in my back hall for use in case of an emergency, and tested one of them on the lawn. I merely wished to ascertain if it would work with spirit, and it did; it went off like a sodawater fountain loaded with dynamite, and I felt truly happy for the first time in many days.  \"The vulgar little beast would better keep away from me now,\" I laughed. But my mirth was short-lived. Whether or not the obnoxious little chap had overheard, or from some hidden coign had watched my test of the fire-extinguisher I don't know, but when he came to my den that night he was amply protected against the annihilating effects of the liquid by a flaring plaid mackintosh, with a toque for his head, and the minute I started the thing squirting he turned his back and received the charge harmless on his shoulders. The only effect of the experiment was the drenching and consequent ruin of a pile of MSS. I had been at work on all day, which gave me another grudge against him. When the extinguisher had exhausted itself, the spectre turned about and fairly raised the ceiling with his guffaws, and when he saw my ruined pages upon the desk his mirth became convulsive.  \"De-lightful!\" he cried. \"For an impromptu shove wherein I turn over the shoving to you in my own behalf, I never saw it equalled. Wouldn't be a bad thing if all writers would wet down their MSS. the same way, now would it?\"  But I was too indignant to reply, and too chagrined over my failure to remain within-doors, so I rushed out and paced the fields for two hours. When I returned, he had gone.  III--THE SPIRIT TRIES TO MAKE REPARATION  Three weeks later he turned up once more. \"Great Heavens!\" I cried; \"you back again?\"  \"Yes,\" he answered; \"and I've come to tell you I'm mighty sorry about those ruined MSS. of yours. It is too bad that your whole day's work had to go for nothing.\"  [Illustration: \"HE WAS AMPLY PROTECTED\"]  \"I think so myself,\" I retorted, coldly. \"It's rather late in the day for you to be sorry, though. If you'll show your sincerity by going away and never crossing my path again, I may believe in you.\"  \"Ah!\" he said, \"I've shown it in another way. Indeed I have. You know I have some conscience, though, to tell the truth, I haven't made much use of it. This time, however, as I considered the situation, a little voice rose up within me and said: 'It's all right, old chap, to be rough on this person; make him mad and shove him every which way; but don't destroy his work. His work is what he lives by--'\"  \"Yes,\" I interrupted, \"and after what I told you on the steamer about what I would do to you when we got on even terms, you are not anxious to have me die. I know just how you feel. No thing likes to contemplate that paralysis that will surely fall upon you when my ghost begins to get in its fine work. I'm putting it in training now.\"  \"You poor droll mortal!\" laughed the cockney. \"You poor droll mortal! As if I could ever be afraid of that! What is the matter with my going into training myself? Two can train, you know--even three. You almost make me feel sorry I tried to remedy the loss of those MSS.\"  Somehow or other a sense of some new misfortune came upon me.  \"What?\" I said, nervously.  \"I say I'm almost sorry I tried to remedy the loss of those manuscripts. Composition, particularly poetry, is devilish hard for me--I admit it--and when I think of how I toiled over my substitutes for your ruined stuff, and see how very ungrateful you are, I grudge the effort.\"  \"I don't understand you,\" I said, anxiously. \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean that I have written and sent out to the editors of the papers you write for a half a dozen poems and short stories.\"  \"What has all that got to do with me?\" I demanded.  \"A great deal,\" he said. \"You'll get the pay. _I signed your name to 'em_.\"  \"Y--you--you--you--did what?\" I cried.  \"Signed your name to 'em. There was a sonnet to 'A Coal Grab'--that was the longest of the lot. I think it will cover at least six magazine pages--\"  \"But,\" I cried, \"a sonnet never contains more than fourteen lines-- you--fool!\"  \"Oh yes, it does,\" he replied, calmly. \"This one of yours had over four hundred. And then I wrote a three-page quatrain on 'Immortality,' which, if I do say it, is the funniest thing I ever read. I sent that to the _Weekly Methodist_.\"  \"Good Lord, good Lord, good Lord!\" I moaned. \"A three-page quatrain!\"  \"Yes,\" he observed, calmly lighting one of his accursed cigars. \"And you'll get all the credit.\"  A ray of hope entered my soul, and it enabled me to laugh hysterically. \"They'll know it isn't mine,\" said I. \"They know my handwriting at the office of the _Weekly Methodist_.\"  \"No doubt,\" said he, dashing all my hopes to the ground. \"But--ah-- to remedy that drawback I took pains to find out what type-writer you used, and I had my quatrain copied on one of the same make.\"  \"But the letter--the note with the manuscript?\" I put in.  \"Oh, I got over that very easily,\" he said. \"I had that written also on the machine, on thin paper, and traced your signature at the bottom. It will be all right, my dear fellow. They'll never suspect.\"  And then, looking at the spirit-watch which he carried in his spectral fob-pocket, he vanished, leaving me immersed in the deepest misery of my life. Not content with ruining me socially, and as a lecturer; not satisfied with destroying me mentally on the seas, he had now attacked me on my most vulnerable point, my literary aspirations. I could not rest until I had read his \"three-page quatrain\" on \"Immortality.\" Vulgar as I knew him to be, I felt confident that over my name something had gone out which even in my least self-respecting moods I could not tolerate. The only comfort that came to me was that his verses and his type-writing and his tracings of my autograph would be as spectral to others as to the eye not attuned to the seeing of ghosts. I was soon to be undeceived, however, for the next morning's mail brought to my home a dozen packages from my best \"consumers,\" containing the maudlin frivolings of this--this--this--well, there is no polite word to describe him in any known tongue. I shall have to study the Aryan language--or Kipling--to find an epithet strong enough to apply to this especial case. Every point, every single detail, about these packages was convincing evidence of their contents having been of my own production. The return envelopes were marked at the upper corner with my name and address. The handwriting upon them was manifestly mine, although I never in my life penned those particular superscriptions. Within these envelopes were, I might say, pounds of MSS., apparently from my own typewriting machine, and signed in an autograph which would have deceived even myself.  And the stuff!  Stuff is not the word--in fact, there is no word in any language, however primitive and impolite, that will describe accurately the substance of those pages. And with each came a letter from the editor of the periodical to which the tale or poem had been sent _advising me to stop work for a while_, and one _suggested the Keeley cure!_  Immediately I sat down and wrote to the various editors to whom these productions had been submitted, explaining all--and every one of them came back to me unopened, with the average statement that until I had rested a year they really hadn't the time to read what I wrote; and my best friend among them, the editor of the _Weekly Methodist_, took the trouble to telegraph to my brother the recommendation that I should be looked after. And out of the mistaken kindness of his heart, he printed a personal in his next issue to the effect that his \"valued contributor, Mr. Me, the public would regret to hear, was confined to his house by a sudden and severe attack of nervous prostration,\" following it up with an estimate of my career, which bore every mark of having been saved up to that time for use as an obituary.  And as I read the latter--the obituary--over, with tears in my eyes, what should I hear but the words, spoken at my back, clearly, but in unmistakable cockney accents,  \"Shove the fifth!\" followed by uproarious laughter. I grabbed up the ink-bottle and threw it with all my strength back of me, and succeeded only in destroying the wall-paper.     IV--THE FAILURE   The destruction of the wall-paper, not to mention the wiping out in a moment of my means of livelihood, made of the fifth shove an intolerable nuisance.
