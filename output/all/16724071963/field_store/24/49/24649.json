This fell within the limits given to Maryland; but Claiborne refused to acknowledge the authority of Baltimore, whereupon a vessel belonging to the Kent Island station was seized by the Marylanders for trading without a license. Claiborne then sent an armed boat with thirty men to capture any vessel belonging to St. Marys. This boat was itself captured, instead; but another fight soon occurred, in which Claiborne's forces beat the Marylanders. The struggle thus begun lasted for years. [13]  THE TOLERATION ACT.--The year 1649 is memorable for the passage of the Maryland Toleration Act, the first of its kind in our history. This provided that \"no person or persons whatsoever within this province, professing to believe in Jesus Christ, shall from henceforth be any ways troubled, molested, or discountenanced for, or in respect to, his or her religion.\"  END OF THE CLAIBORNE TROUBLE.--The nine years that followed formed a stormy period for Maryland. One of the parliamentary commissioners to reduce Virginia to obedience (1652, p. 49) was our old friend Claiborne. He and the new governor of Virginia forced Baltimore's governor to resign, and set up a Protestant government which repealed the Toleration Act and disfranchised Roman Catholics. Baltimore bade his deposed governor resume office. A battle followed, the Protestant forces won, and an attempt was made to destroy the rights of Baltimore; but the English government sustained him, the Virginians were forced to submit, and the quarrel of more than twenty years' standing came to an end. Thenceforth Virginia troubled Maryland no more.  GROWTH OF MARYLAND.--The population of the colony, meantime, grew rapidly. Pamphlets describing the colony and telling how to emigrate and acquire land were circulated in England. Many of the first comers wrote home and brought out more men, and were thus enabled to take up more land. Emigrants who came with ten or twenty settlers were given manors or plantations. Such as came alone received farms.  Most of the work on plantations was done by indented white servants, both convicts and redemptioners. [14] Negro slavery existed in Maryland from the beginning, but slaves were not numerous till after 1700.  [Illustration: HAND LOOM. [15]]  Food was abundant, for the rivers and bay abounded with geese and ducks, oysters and crabs, and the woods were full of deer, turkeys, and wild pigeons. Wheat was not plentiful, but corn was abundant, and from it were made pone, hominy, and hoe-cakes.  NO TOWNS.--As everybody could get land and therefore lived on manors, plantations, or farms, there were practically no towns in Maryland. Even St. Marys, so late as 1678, was not really a town, but a string of some thirty houses straggling for five miles along the shore. The bay with its innumerable creeks, inlets, coves, and river mouths, afforded fine water communication between the farms and plantations; and there were no roads. As in Virginia, there was no need of shipping ports. Vessels came direct to manor or plantation wharf, and exchanged English goods for tobacco or corn. Such farmers or planters as had no water communication packed their tobacco in a hogshead, with an axle through it, and with an ox or a horse in a pair of shafts, or with a party of negro slaves or white servants, rolled it to market.   SUMMARY  1. The struggle of the Jamestown colony for life was a desperate one. For two years it was preserved by Captain John Smith's skillful leadership, and the frequent reinforcements and supplies sent over by the London Company; but in 1610 the settlers started to leave the country.  2. The arrival of Lord Delaware saved the colony. He brought out news of a new charter (1609) which greatly extended the domain of the company.  3. The settlers were now given land of their own, tobacco was grown, more settlements were planted, and prosperity began.  4. In 1619 slavery was introduced; a shipload of young women arrived; and a representative government was established.  5. In 1624 Virginia became a royal colony.  6. During the Civil War in England many Cavaliers came to Virginia.  7. King Charles I cut off a part of Virginia to make (1632) the proprietary colony of Maryland. The new province was given to Lord Baltimore, who founded (1634) a colony at St. Marys.  8. Claiborne, a Virginian, denied the authority of Baltimore, and kept up a struggle against him for many years.  9. In both Maryland and Virginia the people lived on large plantations, and there were few towns. Travel was mostly by water, and there were no good roads.   FOOTNOTES  [1] Read Fiske's _Old Virginia and her Neighbours_, Vol. I, pp. 96-98.  [2] Captain John Smith was born in England in 1580. At an early age he was a soldier in France and in the Netherlands; then after a short stay in England he set off to fight the Turks. In France he was robbed and left for dead, but reached Marseilles and joined a party of pilgrims bound to the Levant. During a violent storm the pilgrims, believing he had caused it, threw him into the sea. But he swam to an island, and after many adventures was made a captain in the Venetian army. The Turks captured him and sold him into slavery, but he killed his master, escaped to a Russian fortress, made his way through Germany, France, Spain, and Morocco, and reached England in time to go out with the London Company's colony. His career in Virginia was as adventurous as in the Old World. While exploring the Chickahominy River he and his companions were taken by the Indians. Lest they should kill him at once Smith showed them a pocket compass with its quivering needle always pointing north. They could see, but could not touch it because of the glass. Supposing him a wizard, they took him to the Powhatan. According to Smith's account two stones were brought and Smith's head laid upon them, while warriors, club in hand, stood near by to beat out his brains. But suddenly the chief's little daughter, Pocahontas, rushed in and laid her head on Smith's to shield him. He was given his life and sent back to Jamestown.  [3] Smith and Newport visited the old chief at his village of Werowocomoco, took off the Powhatan's raccoon-skin coat, and put on the crimson robe. When they told him to kneel, he refused. Two men thereupon seized him by the shoulders and forced him to bend his knees, and the crown was clapped on his head. The Powhatan then took off his old moccasins and sent them, with his raccoon-skin coat, to his royal brother in London.  [4] They were part of a body of some five hundred in nine ships which left England in June. On the way over a storm scattered the fleet; one ship was lost, and another bearing the leaders of the expedition was wrecked on the Bermudas. The shipwrecked colonists spent ten months building two little vessels, in which they reached Jamestown in May, 1610.  [5] Read Fiske's _Old Virginia and her Neighbours_, Vol. I, pp. 152-155.  [6] The governor, the council, and the House of Burgesses constituted the General Assembly. Any act of the Assembly might be vetoed by the governor, and no law was valid till approved by the \"general court\" of the company at London. Neither was any law made by the company for the colony valid till approved by the Assembly. After 1660 the House of Burgesses consisted of two delegates from each county, with one from Jamestown.  [7] For some years to come the slaves increased in numbers very slowly. So late as 1671, when the population of Virginia was 40,000, there were but 2000 slaves, while the bond servants numbered 6000. Some of these indentured servants, as they were called, were persons guilty of crime in England, who were sent over to Virginia and sold for a term of years as a punishment. Others--the \"redemptioners\"--were men who, in order to pay for their passage to Virginia, agreed to serve the owner or the captain of the ship for a certain time. On reaching Virginia the captain could sell them to the planters for the time specified; at the end of the time they became freemen.  [8] That is, the unoccupied land became royal domain again, and the king appointed the governors and controlled the colony through a committee of his privy council. One unhappy result of the downfall of the London Company was the defeat of a plan for establishing schools in Virginia. As early as 1621 some funds were raised for \"a public free school,\" in Charles City. A tract of land was also set apart in the city of Henricus for a college, and a rector, or president, was sent out to start it. But he was killed by the Indians in 1622, and before the company had found a successor the charter was destroyed. Virginia's first college--William and Mary--was established at Williamsburg in 1693.

Cooke's _Virginia_ (American Commonwealths Series), pp. 141-157; or _Stories of the Old Dominion_; or Fiske's _Old Virginia and her Neighbours_, Vol. I, pp. 223- 232.  [10] Jamestown was long the chief town of Virginia; but in its best days the houses did not number more than 75 or 80, and the population was not more than 250. In 1676 the church, the House of Burgesses, and the dwellings were burned during Bacon's Rebellion (p. 95). In 1679 the Burgesses ordered Jamestown \"to be rebuilt and to be the metropolis of Virginia\"; but in 1698 the House of Burgesses was again burned and in 1699 Williamsburg became the seat of government. The ruined church tower (p. 40) is the only structure still standing in Jamestown; but remains of the ancient graveyard, of a mansion built on the foundations of the old House of Burgesses, and some foundations of dwellings may also be seen. The site is cared for by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities.  [11] George Calvert was the son of a Yorkshire farmer, was educated at Oxford, and went to Parliament in 1604.

MEADE       THE CHILDREN'S PILGRIMAGE       FIRST PART.  \"LOOKING FOR THE GUIDE.\"      \"The night is dark, and I am far from home.   Lead Thou me on\"     CHAPTER I.  \"THREE ON A DOORSTEP.\"   In a poor part of London, but not in the very poorest part--two children sat on a certain autumn evening, side by side on a doorstep. The eldest might have been ten, the youngest eight. The eldest was a girl, the youngest a boy. Drawn up in front of these children, looking into their little faces with hungry, loving, pathetic eyes, lay a mongrel dog.  The three were alone, for the street in which they sat was a cul-de-sac--leading nowhere; and at this hour, on this Sunday evening, seemed quite deserted. The boy and girl were no East End waifs; they were clean; they looked respectable; and the doorstep which gave them a temporary resting-place belonged to no far-famed Stepney or Poplar. It stood in a little, old-fashioned, old-world court, back of Bloomsbury. They were a foreign-looking little pair--not in their dress, which was truly English in its clumsiness and want of picturesque coloring--but their faces were foreign. The contour was peculiar, the setting of the two pairs of eyes--un-Saxon. They sat very close together, a grave little couple. Presently the girl threw her arm round the boy's neck, the boy laid his head on her shoulder. In this position those who watched could have traced motherly lines round this little girl's firm mouth. She was a creature to defend and protect. The evening fell and the court grew dark, but the boy had found shelter on her breast, and the dog, coming close, laid his head on her lap.  After a time the boy raised his eyes, looked at her and spoke:  \"Will it be soon, Cecile?\"  \"I think so, Maurice; I think it must be soon now.\"  \"I'm so cold, Cecile, and it's getting so dark.\"  \"Never mind, darling, stepmother will soon wake now, and then you can come indoors and sit by the fire.\"  The boy, with a slight impatient sigh, laid his head once more on her shoulder, and the grave trio sat on as before.  Presently a step was heard approaching inside the house--it came along the passage, the door was opened, and a gentleman in a plain black coat came out. He was a doctor and a young man. His smooth, almost boyish face looked so kind that it could not but be an index to a charitable heart.  He stopped before the children, looking at them with interest and pity.  \"How is our stepmother, Dr. Austin?\" asked Cecile, raising her head and speaking with alacrity.  \"Your stepmother is very ill, my dear--very ill indeed. I stopped with her to write a letter which she wants me to post. Yes, she is very ill, but she is awake now; you may go upstairs; you won't disturb her.\"  \"Oh, come, Cecile,\" said little Maurice, springing to his feet; \"stepmother is awake, and we may get to the fire. I am so bitter cold.\"  There was not a particle of anything but a kind of selfish longing for warmth and comfort on his little face. He ran along the passage holding out his hand to his sister, but Cecile drew back. She came out more into the light and looked straight up into the tall doctor's face:  \"Is my stepmother going to be ill very long, Dr. Austin?\"  \"No, my dear; I don't expect her illness will last much longer.\"  \"Oh, then, she'll be quite well to-morrow.\"  \"Perhaps--in a sense--who knows!\" said the doctor, jerking out his words and speaking queerly. He looked as if he wanted to say more, but finally nodding to the child, turned on his heel and walked away.  Cecile, satisfied with this answer, and reading no double meaning in it, followed her brother and the dog upstairs. She entered a tolerably comfortable sitting-room, where, on a sofa, lay a woman partly dressed. The woman's cheeks were crimson, and her large eyes, which were wide open, were very bright. Little Maurice had already found a seat and a hunch of bread and butter, and was enjoying both drawn up by a good fire, while the dog Toby crouched at his feet and snapped at morsels which he threw him. Cecile, scarcely glancing at the group by the fire, went straight up to the woman on the sofa:  \"Stepmother,\" she said, taking her hand in hers, \"Dr. Austin says you'll be quite well to-morrow.\"  The woman gazed hard and hungrily into the sweet eyes of the child; she held her small hand with almost feverish energy, but she did not speak, and when Maurice called out from the fire, \"Cecile, I want some more bread and butter,\" she motioned to her to go and attend to him.  All his small world did attend to Maurice at once, so Cecile ran to him, and after supplying him with milk and bread and butter, she took his hand to lead him to bed. There were only two years between the children, but Maurice seemed quite a baby, and Cecile a womanly creature.  When they got into the tiny bedroom, which they shared together, Cecile helped her little brother to undress, and tucked him up when he got into bed.  \"Now, Toby,\" she said, addressing the dog, whose watchful eyes had followed her every movement, \"you must lie down by Maurice and keep him company; and good-night, Maurice, dear.\"  \"Won't you come to bed too, Cecile?\"  \"Presently, darling; but first I have to see to stepmother. Our stepmother is very ill, you know, Maurice.\"  \"Very ill, you know,\" repeated Maurice sleepily, and without comprehending; then he shut his eyes, and Cecile went back into the sitting-room.  The sick woman had never stirred during the child's absence, now she turned round eagerly. The little girl went up to the sofa with a confident step. Though her stepmother was so ill now, she would be quite well to-morrow, so the doctor had said, and surely the best way to bring that desirable end about was to get her to have as much sleep as possible.  \"Stepmother,\" said Cecile softly, \"'tis very late; may I bring in your night-dress and air it by the fire, and then may I help you to get into bed, stepmother dear?\"  \"No, Cecile,\" replied the sick woman. \"I'm not going to stir from this yere sofa to-night.\"  \"Oh, but then--but then you won't be quite well to-morrow,\" said the child, tears springing to her eyes.  \"Who said I'd be quite well to-morrow?\" asked Cecile's stepmother.  \"Dr. Austin, mother; I asked him, and he said, 'Yes,'--at least he said 'Perhaps,' but I think he was very sure from his look.\"  \"Aye, child, aye; he was very sure, but he was not meaning what you were meaning. Well, never mind; but what was that you called me just now, Cecile?\"  \"I--I----\" said Cecile, hesitating and coloring.  \"Aye, like enough 'twas a slip of your tongue. But you said, 'Mother'; you said it without the 'step' added on. You don't know--not that it matters now--but you won't never know how that 'stepmother' hardened my heart against you and Maurice, child.\"  \"'Twas our father,\" said Cecile; \"he couldn't forget our own mother, and he asked us not to say 'Mother,' and me and Maurice, we could think of no other way. It wasn't that we--that I--didn't love.\"  \"Aye, child, you're a tender little thing; I'm not blaming you, and maybe I couldn't have borne the word from your lips, for I didn't love you, Cecile--neither you nor Maurice--I had none of the mother about me for either of you little kids. Aye, you were right enough; your father, Maurice D'Albert, never forgot his Rosalie, as he called her. I always thought as Frenchmen were fickle, but he worn't not fickle enough for me. Well, Cecile, I'm no way sleepy, and I've a deal to say, and no one but you to say it to; I'm more strong now than I have been for the day, so I'd better say my say while I have any strength left. You build up the fire, and then come back to me, child. Build it up big, for I'm not going to bed to-night.\"     CHAPTER II.  A SOLEMN PROMISE.   When Cecile had built up the fire, she made a cup of tea and brought it to her stepmother. Mrs. D'Albert drank it off greedily; afterward she seemed refreshed and she made Cecile put another pillow under her head and draw her higher on the sofa.  \"You're a good, tender-hearted child, Cecile,\" she said to the little creature, who was watching her every movement with a kind of trembling eagerness. Cecile's sensitive face flushed at the words of praise, and she came very close to the sofa. \"Yes, you're a good child,\" repeated Mrs. D'Albert; \"you're yer father's own child, and he was very good, though he was a foreigner. For myself I don't much care for good people, but when you're dying, I don't deny as they're something of a comfort. Good people are to be depended on, and you're good, Cecile.\"  But there was only one sentence in these words which Cecile took in.  \"When you're dying,\" she repeated, and every vestige of color forsook her lips.  \"Yes, my dear, when you're dying. I'm dying, Cecile; that was what the doctor meant when he said I'd be quite well; he meant as I'd lie straight and stiff, and have my eyes shut, and be put in a long box and be buried, that was what he meant, Cecile. But look here now, you're not to cry about it--not at present, I mean; you may as much as you like by and by, but not now. I'm not crying, and 'tis a deal worse for me; but there ain't no time for tears, they only weaken and do no good, and I has a deal to say. Don't you dare shed a tear now, Cecile; I can't a-bear the sight of tears; you may cry by and by, but now you has got to listen to me.\"  \"I won't cry,\" said Cecile; she made a great effort set her lips firm, and looked hard at her stepmother.  \"That's a good, brave girl. Now I can talk in comfort. I want to talk all I can to you to-night, my dear, for to-morrow I may have the weakness back again, and besides your Aunt Lydia will be here!\"  \"Who's my Aunt Lydia?\" asked Cecile.  \"She ain't rightly your aunt at all, she's my sister; but she's the person as will have to take care of you and Maurice after I'm dead.\"  \"Oh!\" said Cecile; her little face fell, and "]]]
