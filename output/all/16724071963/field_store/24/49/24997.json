Where is Rome, once the mistress of the World?  There are the same seven hills now, the same soil, the same natural resources; the nature is the same, but what a ruin of human greatness meets the eye of the traveler throughout the length and breadth of that most down-trodden land! why have not the People of that Heaven-favored clime, the spirit that animated their fathers?  Why this sad difference?  \"It is the destruction of their institutions that has caused it; and, my countrymen, if we shall in an evil hour rashly pull down and destroy those institutions which the patriotic hand of our fathers labored so long and so hard to build up, and which have done so much for us and the World, who can venture the prediction that similar results will not ensue?  Let us avoid it if we can.  I trust the spirit is among us that will enable us to do it.  Let us not rashly try the experiment, for, if it fails, as it did in Greece and Italy, and in the South American Republics, and in every other place wherever liberty is once destroyed, it may never be restored to us again.  \"There are defects in our government, errors in administration, and short-comings of many kinds; but in spite of these defects and errors, Georgia has grown to be a great State.  Let us pause here a moment.  \"When I look around and see our prosperity in everything, agriculture, commerce, art, science, and every department of education, physical and mental, as well as moral advancement--and our colleges--I think, in the face of such an exhibition, if we can, without the loss of power, or any essential right or interest, remain in the Union, it is our duty to ourselves and to posterity--let us not too readily yield to this temptation--to do so.  Our first parents, the great progenitors of the human race, were not without a like temptation, when in the Garden of Eden.  They were led to believe that their condition would be bettered --that their eyes would be opened--and that they would become as gods. They in an evil hour yielded--instead of becoming gods they only saw their own nakedness.  \"I look upon this Country, with our institutions, as the Eden of the World, the Paradise of the Universe.  It may be that out of it we may become greater and more prosperous, but I am candid and sincere in telling you that I fear if we rashly evince passion, and without sufficient cause shall take that step, that instead of becoming greater or more peaceful, prosperous, and happy--instead of becoming gods, we will become demons, and at no distant day commence cutting one another's throats.  This is my apprehension.  \"Let us, therefore, whatever we do, meet those difficulties, great as they are, like wise and sensible men, and consider them in the light of all the consequences which may attend our action.  Let us see first clearly where the path of duty leads, and then we may not fear to tread therein.\"   Said Senator Wigfall, of Texas, March 4, 1861, in the United States Senate, only a few hours before Mr. Lincoln's Inauguration:  \"I desire to pour oil on the waters, to produce harmony, peace and quiet here.  It is early in the morning, and I hope I shall not say anything that may be construed as offensive.  I rise merely that we may have an understanding of this question.  \"It is not Slavery in the Territories, it is not expansion, which is the difficulty.  If the resolution which the Senator from Wisconsin introduced here, denying the right of Secession, had been adopted by two-thirds of each branch of this department of the Government, and had been ratified by three-fourths of the States, I have no hesitation in saying that, so far as the State in which I live and to which I owe my allegiance is concerned, if she had no other cause for a disruption of the Union taking place, she would undoubtedly have gone out.       [To insert as an additional article of amendment to the      Constitution, the following: \"Under this Constitution, as      originally adopted, and as it now exists, no State has power to      withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United States: but this      Constitution, and all laws passed in pursuance of its delegated      powers, are the Supreme Law of the Land, anything contained in any      constitution, ordinance, or act of any State, to the contrary      notwithstanding.\"]  \"The moment you deny the right of self-government to the free White men of the South, they will leave the Government.  They believe in the Declaration of Independence.  They believe that:  \"'Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.'  \"That principle of the Declaration of Independence is the one upon which the free White men of the South predicated their devotion to the present Constitution of the United States; and it was the denial of that, as much as anything else, that has created the dissatisfaction in that Section of the Country.  \"There is no instrument of writing that has ever been written that has been more misapprehended and misunderstood and misrepresented than this same unfortunate Declaration of Independence, and no set of gentlemen have ever been so slandered as the fathers who drew and signed that Declaration.  \"If there was a thing on earth that they did not intend to assert, it was that a Negro was a White man.  As I said here, a short time ago, one of the greatest charges they made against the British Government was, that old King George was attempting to establish the fact practically that all men were created Free and Equal.  They charged him in the Declaration of Independence with inciting their Slaves to insurrection. That is one of the grounds upon which they threw off their allegiance to the British Parliament.  \"Another great misapprehension is, that the men who drafted that Declaration of Independence had any peculiar fancy for one form of government rather than another.  They were not fighting to establish a Democracy in this country; they were not fighting to establish a Republican form of government in this Country.  Nothing was further from their intention.  \"Alexander Hamilton, after he had fought for seven years, declared that the British form of government was the best that the ingenuity of man had ever devised; and when John Adams said to him, 'without its corruptions;'  'Why,' said he, 'its corruptions are its greatest excellence; without the corruptions, it would be nothing.'  \"In the Declaration of Independence, they speak of George III., after this fashion.  They say:  \"'A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'  \"Now, I ask any plain common-sense man what was the meaning of that? Was it that they were opposed to a Monarchical form of government?  Was it that they believed a Monarchical form of government was incompatible with civil liberty?  No, sir; they entertained no such absurd idea. None of them entertained it; but they say that George III, was a prince whose character was 'marked by every act which may define a tyrant' and that therefore he was 'unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'  Had his character not been so marked by every quality which would define a tyrant, he might have been the fit ruler of a free People; ergo, a monarchical form of Government was not incompatible with civil liberty.  \"That was clearly the opinion of those men.  I do not advocate it now; for I have said frequently that we are wiser than our fathers, and our children will be wiser than we are.  One hundred years hence, men will understand their own affairs much better than we do.  We understand our affairs better than those who preceded us one hundred years.  But what I assert is, that the men of the Revolution did not believe that a Monarchical form of Government was incompatible with civil liberty.  \"What I assert is, that when they spoke of 'all men being created equal,' they were speaking of the White men who then had unsheathed their swords--for what purpose?  To establish the right of self-government in themselves; and when they had achieved that, they established, not Democracies, but Republican forms of Government in the thirteen sovereign, separate and independent Colonies.  Yet the Declaration of Independence is constantly quoted to prove Negro equality.  It proves no such thing; it was intended to prove no such thing.  \"The 'glittering generalities' which a distinguished former Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Choate) spoke of, as contained in the Declaration of Independence, one of them at least, about all men being created equal --was not original with Mr. Jefferson.  I recollect seeing a pamphlet called the Principles of the Whigs and Jacobites, published about the year 1745, when the last of the Stuarts, called 'the Pretender,' was striking a blow that was fatal to himself, but a blow for his crown, in which pamphlet the very phraseology is used, word for word and letter for letter.  I have not got it here to-night.  I sent the other day to the Library to try and find it, but could not find it; it was burnt, I believe, with the pamphlets that were burnt some time ago.  \"That Mr. Jefferson copied it or plagiarized it, is not true, I suppose, any more than the charge that the distinguished Senator from New York plagiarized from the Federalist in preparing his celebrated compromising speech which was made here a short time ago.  It was the cant phrase of the day in 1745, which was only about thirty years previous to the Declaration of Independence.  This particular pamphlet, which I have read, was published;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7135"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 3 (#3)"],["body"," were published at the same time.  That sort of phraseology was used.  \"There was a war of classes in England; there were men who were contending for legitimacy; who were contending for the right of the Crown being inherent and depending on the will of God, 'the divine right of Kings,' for maintaining an hereditary landed-aristocracy; there was another Party who were contending against this doctrine of legitimacy, and the right of primogeniture.  These were called the Whigs; they established this general phraseology in denouncing the divine right and the doctrine of legitimacy, and it became the common phraseology of the Country; so that in the obscure county of Mecklenburg, in North Carolina, a declaration containing the same assertions was found as in this celebrated Declaration of Independence, written by the immortal Jefferson.  \"Which of us, I ask, is there upon this floor who has not read and re-read whatever was written within the last twenty-five or thirty years by the distinguished men of this country?  But enough of that.  \"As I said before, there ought not have been, and there did not necessarily result from our form of Government, any irrepressible conflict between the Slaveholding and the non-Slaveholding States. Nothing of the sort was necessary.  \"Strike out a single clause in the Constitution of the United States, that which secures to each State a Republican form of Government, and there is no reason why, under precisely such a Constitution as we have, States that are Monarchical and States that are Republican, could not live in peace and quiet.  They confederate together for common defense and general welfare, each State regulating its domestic concerns in its own way; those which preferred a Republican form of Government maintaining it, and those which preferred a Monarchical form of Government maintaining it.  \"But how long could small States, with different forms of Government, live together, confederated for common defense and general welfare, if the people of one Section were to come to the conclusion that their institutions were better than those of the other, and thereupon straightway set about subverting the institutions of the other?\"   In the reply of the Rebel \"Commissioners of the Southern Confederacy\" to Mr. Seward, April 9, 1861, they speak of our Government as being \"persistently wedded to those fatal theories of construction of the Federal Constitution always rejected by the statesmen of the South, and adhered to by those of the Administration school, until they have produced their natural and often-predicted result of the destruction of the Union, under which we might have continued to live happily and gloriously together, had the spirit of the ancestry who framed the common Constitution animated the hearts of all their sons.\"  In the \"Address of the people of South Carolina, assembled in Convention, to the people of the Slaveholding States of the United States,\" by which the attempt was made to justify the passage of the South Carolina Secession Ordinance of 1860, it is declared that:  \"Discontent and contention have moved in the bosom of the Confederacy, for the last thirty-five years.  During this time South Carolina has twice called her people together in solemn Convention, to take into consideration, the aggressions and unconstitutional wrongs, perpetrated by the people of the North on the people of the South.  These wrongs were submitted to by the people of the South, under the hope and expectation that they would be final.  But such hope and expectation have proved to be vain.  Instead of producing forbearance, our acquiescence has only instigated to new forms of aggressions and outrage; and South Carolina, having again assembled her people in Convention, has this day dissolved her connection with the States constituting the United States.  \"The one great evil from which all other evils have flowed, is the overthrow of the Constitution of the United States.  The Government of the United States, is no longer the Government of Confederated Republics, but of a consolidated Democracy.  It is no longer a free Government, but a Despotism.  It is, in fact, such a Government as Great Britain attempted to set over our Fathers; and which was resisted and defeated by a seven years struggle for Independence.  \"The Revolution of 1776, turned upon one great principle, self-government,--and self-taxation, the criterion of self-government.  \"The Southern States now stand exactly in the same position towards the Northern States, that the Colonies did towards Great Britain.  The Northern States, having the majority in Congress, claim the same power of omnipotence in legislation as the British Parliament.  'The General Welfare' is the only limit to the legislation of either; and the majority in Congress, as in the British Parliament, are the sole judges of the expediency of the legislation this 'General Welfare' requires. Thus the Government of the United States has become a consolidated Government; and the people of the Southern States are compelled to meet the very despotism their fathers threw off in the Revolution of 1776.  \"The consolidation of the Government of Great Britain over the Colonies, was attempted to be carried out by the taxes.  The British Parliament undertook to tax the Colonies to promote British interests.  Our fathers resisted this pretension.  They claimed the right of self-taxation through their Colonial Legislatures.  They were not represented in the British Parliament, and, therefore, could not rightly be taxed by its legislation.  The British Government, however, offered them a representation in Parliament; but it was not sufficient to enable them to protect themselves from the majority, and they refused the offer. Between taxation without any representation, and taxation without a representation adequate to protection, there was no difference.  In neither case would the Colonies tax themselves.  Hence, they refused to pay the taxes laid by the British Parliament.  \"And so with the Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the vital matter of taxation.  They are in a minority in Congress.  Their representation in Congress is useless to protect them against unjust taxation; and they are taxed by the people of the North for their benefit, exactly as the people of Great Britain taxed our ancestors in the British Parliament for their benefit.  For the last forty years, the taxes laid by the Congress of the United States have been laid with a view of subserving the interests of the North.  The people of the South have been taxed by duties on imports, not for revenue, but for an object inconsistent with revenue--to promote, by prohibitions, Northern interests in the productions of their mines and manufactures.  \"There is another evil, in the condition of the Southern towards the Northern States, which our ancestors refused to bear towards Great Britain.  Our ancestors not only taxed themselves, but all the taxes collected from them were expended amongst them.  Had they submitted to the pretensions of the British Government, the taxes collected from them, would have been expended in other parts of the British Empire. They were fully aware of the effect of such a policy in impoverishing the people from whom taxes are collected, and in enriching those who receive the benefit of their expenditure.  \"To prevent the evils of such a policy, was one of the motives which drove them on to Revolution, yet this British policy has been fully realized towards the Southern States, by the Northern States.  The people of the Southern States are not only taxed for the benefit of the Northern States, but after the taxes are collected, three fourths of them are expended at the North.  This cause, with others, connected with the operation of the General Government, has made the cities of the South provincial.  Their growth is paralyzed; they are mere suburbs of Northern cities.  The agricultural productions of the South are the basis of the foreign commerce of the United States; yet Southern cities do not carry it on.  Our foreign trade is almost annihilated.  * * *  \"No man can for a moment believe, that our ancestors intended to establish over their posterity, exactly the same sort of Government they had overthrown.  * * *  Yet by gradual and steady encroachments on the part of the people of the North, and acquiescence on the part of the South, the limitations in the Constitution have been swept away; and the Government of the United States has become consolidated, with a claim of limitless powers in its operations.  * * *  \"A majority in Congress, according to their interested and perverted views, is omnipotent.  * * *  Numbers with them, is the great element of free Government.  A majority is infallible and omnipotent.  'The right divine to rule in Kings,' is only transferred to their majority.  The very object of all Constitutions, in free popular Government, is to restrain the majority.  Constitutions, therefore, according to their theory, must be most unrighteous inventions, restricting liberty.  None ought to exist; but the body politic ought simply to have a political organization, to bring out and enforce the will of the majority.  This theory is a remorseless despotism.  In resisting it, as applicable to ourselves, we are vindicating the great cause of free Government, more important, perhaps, to the World, than the existence of all the United States.\"   In his Special Message to the Confederate Congress at Montgomery, April 29, 1861, Mr. Jefferson Davis said:  \"From a period as early as 1798, there had existed in all the States a Party, almost uninterruptedly in the majority, based upon the creed that each State was, in the last resort, the sole judge, as well of its wrongs as of the mode and measure of redress.  * * *  The Democratic Party of the United States repeated, in its successful canvas of 1836, the declaration, made in numerous previous political contests,"]]]
