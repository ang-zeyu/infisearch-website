We are weary, my heart, we are weary, so long we have borne   The heavy loved burden of dreams that are dead, let us rest,   Let us scatter their ashes away, for a while let us mourn;   We will rest, O my heart, till the shadows are gray in the west.    But soon we must rise, O my heart, we must wander again   Into the war of the world and the strife of the throng;   Let us rise, O my heart, let us gather the dreams that remain,   We will conquer the sorrow of life with the  sorrow of song.    PAST AND FUTURE    THE NEW HATH COME AND NOW THE OLD RETIRES:   And so the past becomes a mountain-cell,   Where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell   In consecrated calm, forgotten yet   Of the keen heart that hastens to forget   Old longings in fulfilling new desires.    And now the Soul stands in a vague, intense   Expectancy and anguish of suspense,   On the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees   Like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown,   His timid future shrinking there alone,   Beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries.    LIFE    Children, ye have not lived, to you it seems   Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams,   Or carnival of careless joys that leap   About your hearts like billows on the deep   In flames of amber and of amethyst.    Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist   Till some resistless hour shall rise and move   Your hearts to wake and hunger after love,   And thirst with passionate longing for the things   That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings.    Till ye have battled with great grief and fears,   And borne the conflict of dream-shattering years,   Wounded with fierce desire and worn with strife,   Children, ye have not lived: for this is life.    THE POET'S LOVE-SONG    In noon-tide hours, O Love, secure and strong,      I need thee not; mad dreams are mine to bind      The world to my desire, and hold the wind   A voiceless captive to my conquering song.      I need thee not, I am content with these:      Keep silence in thy soul, beyond the seas!    But in the desolate hour of midnight, when      An ecstasy of starry silence sleeps      On the still mountains and the soundless deeps,   And my soul hungers for thy voice, O then,      Love, like the magic of wild melodies,      Let thy soul answer mine across the seas.    TO THE GOD OF PAIN    Unwilling priestess in thy cruel fane,   Long hast thou held me, pitiless god of Pain,   Bound to thy worship by reluctant vows,   My tired breast girt with suffering, and my brows   Anointed with perpetual weariness.   Long have I borne thy service, through the stress   Of rigorous years, sad days and slumberless nights,   Performing thine inexorable rites.    For thy dark altars, balm nor milk nor rice,   But mine own soul thou'st ta'en for sacrifice:   All the rich honey of my youth's desire,   And all the sweet oils from my crushed life drawn,   And all my flower-like dreams and gem-like  fire   Of hopes up-leaping like the light of dawn.    I have no more to give, all that was mine   Is laid, a wrested tribute, at thy shrine;   Let me depart, for my whole soul is wrung,   And all my cheerless orisons are sung;   Let me depart, with faint limbs let me creep   To some dim shade and sink me down to sleep.    THE SONG OF PRINCESS ZEB-UN-NISSA   IN PRAISE OF HER OWN BEAUTY    (From the Persian)    When from my cheek I lift my veil,   The roses turn with envy pale,        And from their pierced hearts, rich with pain,   Send forth their fragrance like a wail.    Or if perchance one perfumed tress   Be lowered to the wind's caress,        The honeyed hyacinths complain,   And languish in a sweet distress.    And, when I pause, still groves among,   (Such loveliness is mine) a throng        Of nightingales awake and strain   Their souls into a quivering song.    INDIAN DANCERS    Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting,         what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire   Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth         heavens that glimmer around them in         fountains of light;   O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music         that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire,   And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces         bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.    The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter         and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair,   And smiles are entwining like magical serpents         the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet;   Their glittering garments of purple are burning         like tremulous dawns in the quivering air,   And exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle         and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet.    Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging,         like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers,   Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they         falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant         choir;   Their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long         fingers enchant through melodious hours,   Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting,         what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire!    MY DEAD DREAM    Have you found me, at last, O my Dream?        Seven aeons ago   You died and I buried you deep under forests        of snow.   Why have you come hither? Who bade you        awake from your sleep   And track me beyond the cerulean foam of the        deep?    Would you tear from my lintels these sacred        green garlands of leaves?   Would you scare the white, nested, wild        pigeons of joy from my eaves?   Would you touch and defile with dead fingers        the robes of my priest?   Would you weave your dim moan with the        chantings of love at my feast?    Go back to your grave, O my Dream, under        forests of snow,   Where a heart-riven child hid you once, seven        aeons ago.   Who bade you arise from your darkness? I        bid you depart!   Profane not the shrines I have raised in the        clefts of my heart.    DAMAYANTE TO NALA IN THE HOUR OF EXILE    (A fragment)    Shalt thou be conquered of a human fate   My liege, my lover, whose imperial head   Hath never bent in sorrow of defeat?   Shalt thou be vanquished, whose imperial feet   Have shattered armies and stamped empires dead?   Who shall unking thee, husband of a queen?   Wear thou thy majesty inviolate.   Earth's glories flee of human eyes unseen,   Earth's kingdoms fade to a remembered dream,   But thine henceforth shall be a power supreme,   Dazzling command and rich dominion,   The winds thy heralds and thy vassals all   The silver-belted planets and the sun.   Where'er the radiance of thy coming fall,   Shall dawn for thee her saffron footcloths spread,   Sunset her purple canopies and red,   In serried splendour, and the night unfold   Her velvet darkness wrought with starry gold   For kingly raiment, soft as cygnet-down.   My hair shall braid thy temples like a crown   Of sapphires, and my kiss upon thy brows   Like cithar-music lull thee to repose,   Till the sun yield thee homage of his light.    O king, thy kingdom who from thee can wrest?   What fate shall dare uncrown thee from this breast,   O god-born lover, whom my love doth gird   And armour with impregnable delight   Of Hope's triumphant keen flame-carven sword?    THE QUEEN'S RIVAL    QUEEN Gulnaar sat on her ivory bed,   Around her countless treasures were spread;    Her chamber walls were richly inlaid   With agate, porphory, onyx and jade;    The tissues that veiled her delicate breast,   Glowed with the hues of a lapwing's crest;    But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed   \"O King, my heart is unsatisfied.\"    King Feroz bent from his ebony seat:   \"Is thy least desire unfulfilled, O Sweet?    \"Let thy mouth speak and my life be spent   To clear the sky of thy discontent.\"    \"I tire of my beauty, I tire of this   Empty splendour and shadowless bliss;    \"With none to envy and none gainsay,   No savour or salt hath my dream or day.\"    Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose:   \"Give me a rival, O King Feroz.\"     II    King Feroz spoke to his Chief Vizier:   \"Lo! ere to-morrow's dawn be here,    \"Send forth my messengers over the sea,   To seek seven beautiful brides for me;    \"Radiant of feature and regal of mien,   Seven handmaids meet for the Persian Queen.\"           .       .       .       .       .     Seven new moon tides at the Vesper call,   King Feroz led to Queen Gulnaar's hall    A young queen eyed like the morning star:   \"I bring thee a rival, O Queen Gulnaar.\"    But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed:   \"O King, my heart is unsatisfied.\"    Seven queens shone round her ivory bed,   Like seven soft gems on a silken thread,    Like seven fair lamps in a royal tower,   Like seven bright petals of Beauty's flower    Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose   \"Where is my rival, O King Feroz?\"     III    When spring winds wakened the mountain floods,   And kindled the flame of the tulip buds,   When bees grew loud and the days grew long,   And the peach groves thrilled to the oriole's song,    Queen Gulnaar sat on her ivory bed,   Decking with jewels her exquisite head;    And still she gazed in her mirror and sighed:   \"O King, my heart is unsatisfied.\"    Queen Gulnaar's daughter two spring times old,   In blue robes bordered with tassels of gold,    Ran to her knee like a wildwood fay,   And plucked from her hand the mirror away.    Quickly she set on her own light curls   Her mother's fillet with fringes of pearls;    Quickly she turned with a child's caprice   And pressed on the mirror a swift, glad kiss.    Queen Gulnaar laughed like a tremulous rose:   \"Here is my rival, O King Feroz.\"    THE POET TO DEATH    Tarry a while, O Death, I cannot die   While yet my sweet life burgeons with its spring;   Fair is my youth, and rich the echoing boughs "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/680"],["title","The Golden Threshold (#4)"],["body","  Where dhadikulas sing.    Tarry a while, O Death, I cannot die   With all my blossoming hopes unharvested,   My joys ungarnered, all my songs unsung,   And all my tears unshed.    Tarry a while, till I am satisfied   Of love and grief, of earth and altering sky;   Till all my human hungers are fulfilled,   O Death, I cannot die!    THE INDIAN GIPSY    In tattered robes that hoard a glittering trace   Of bygone colours, broidered to the knee,   Behold her, daughter of a wandering race,   Tameless, with the bold falcon's agile grace,   And the lithe tiger's sinuous majesty.    With frugal skill her simple wants she tends,   She folds her tawny heifers and her sheep   On lonely meadows when the daylight ends,   Ere the quick night upon her flock descends   Like a black panther from the caves of sleep.    Time's river winds in foaming centuries   Its changing, swift, irrevocable course   To far off and incalculable seas;   She is twin-born with primal mysteries,   And drinks of life at Time's forgotten source.    TO MY CHILDREN    Jaya Surya, aetat 4    Golden sun of victory, born   In my life's unclouded morn,   In my lambent sky of love,   May your growing glory prove   Sacred to your consecration,   To my heart and to my nation.   Sun of victory, may you be   Sun of song and liberty.     Padmaja, aetat 3    Lotus-maiden, you who claim   All the sweetness of your name,   Lakshmi, fortune's queen, defend you,   Lotus-born like you, and send you   Balmy moons of love to bless you,   Gentle joy-winds to caress you.   Lotus-maiden, may you be   Fragrant of all ecstasy.     Ranadheera, aetat 2    Little lord of battle, hail   In your newly-tempered mail!   Learn to conquer, learn to fight   In the foremost flanks of right,   Like Valmiki's heroes bold,   Rubies girt in epic gold.   Lord of battle, may you be,   Lord of love and chivalry.     Lilamani, aetat 1    Limpid jewel of delight   Severed from the tender night   Of your sheltering mother-mine,   Leap and sparkle, dance and shine,   Blithely and securely set   In love's magic coronet.   Living jewel, may you be   Laughter-bound and sorrow-free.    THE PARDAH NASHIN    Her life is a revolving dream   Of languid and sequestered ease;   Her girdles and her fillets gleam   Like changing fires on sunset seas;   Her raiment is like morning mist,   Shot opal, gold and amethyst.    From thieving light of eyes impure,   From coveting sun or wind's caress,   Her days are guarded and secure   Behind her carven lattices,   Like jewels in a turbaned crest,   Like secrets in a lover's breast.    But though no hand unsanctioned dares   Unveil the mysteries of her grace,   Time lifts the curtain unawares,   And Sorrow looks into her face . . .   Who shall prevent the subtle years,   Or shield a woman's eyes from tears?    TO YOUTH    O Youth, sweet comrade Youth, wouldst thou be gone?   Long have we dwelt together, thou and I;   Together drunk of many an alien dawn,   And plucked the fruit of many an alien sky.    Ah, fickle friend, must I, who yesterday   Dreamed forwards to long, undimmed ecstasy,   Henceforward dream, because thou wilt not stay,   Backward to transient pleasure and to thee?    I give thee back thy false, ephemeral vow;   But, O beloved comrade, ere we part,   Upon my mournful eyelids and my brow   Kiss me who hold thine image in my heart.    NIGHTFALL IN THE CITY OF HYDERABAD    See how the speckled sky burns like a pigeon's throat,   Jewelled with embers of opal and peridote.    See the white river that flashes and scintillates,   Curved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates.    Hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call   Floats like a battle-flag over the city wall.    From trellised balconies, languid and luminous   Faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous.    Leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes,   Swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains.    Round the high Char Minar sounds of gay cavalcades   Blend with the music of cymbals and serenades.    Over the city bridge Night comes majestical,   Borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival.    STREET CRIES    When dawn's first cymbals beat upon the sky,   Rousing the world to labour's various cry,   To tend the flock, to bind the mellowing grain,   From ardent toil to forge a little gain,   And fasting men go forth on hurrying feet,   BUY BREAD, BUY BREAD, rings down the eager street.    When the earth falters and the waters swoon   With the implacable radiance of noon,   And in dim shelters koils hush their notes,   And the faint, thirsting blood in languid throats   Craves liquid succour from the cruel heat,   BUY FRUIT, BUY FRUIT, steals down the panting street.    When twilight twinkling o'er the gay bazaars,   Unfurls a sudden canopy of stars,   When lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit   On white roof-terraces where lovers sit   Drinking together of life's poignant sweet,   BUY FLOWERS, BUY FLOWERS, floats down the singing street.    TO INDIA    O young through all thy immemorial years!   Rise, Mother, rise, regenerate from thy gloom,   And, like a bride high-mated with the spheres,   Beget new glories from thine ageless womb!    The nations that in fettered darkness weep   Crave thee to lead them where great mornings break . . . .   Mother, O Mother, wherefore dost thou sleep?   Arise and answer for thy children's sake!    Thy Future calls thee with a manifold sound   To crescent honours, splendours, victories vast;   Waken, O slumbering Mother and be crowned,   Who once wert empress of the sovereign Past.    THE ROYAL TOMBS OF GOLCONDA    I muse among these silent fanes   Whose spacious darkness guards your dust;   Around me sleep the hoary plains   That hold your ancient wars in trust.   I pause, my dreaming spirit hears,   Across the wind's unquiet tides,   The glimmering music of your spears,   The laughter of your royal brides.    In vain, O Kings, doth time aspire   To make your names oblivion's sport,   While yonder hill wears like a tier   The ruined grandeur of your fort.   Though centuries falter and decline,   Your proven strongholds shall remain   Embodied memories of your line,   Incarnate legends of your reign.    O Queens, in vain old Fate decreed   Your flower-like bodies to the tomb;   Death is in truth the vital seed   Of your imperishable bloom   Each new-born year the bulbuls sing   Their songs of your renascent loves;   Your beauty wakens with the spring   To kindle these pomegranate groves.    TO A BUDDHA SEATED ON A LOTUS    Lord Buddha, on thy Lotus-throne,   With praying eyes and hands elate,   What mystic rapture dost thou own,   Immutable and ultimate?   What peace, unravished of our ken,   Annihilate from the world of men?    The wind of change for ever blows   Across the tumult of our way,   To-morrow's unborn griefs depose   The sorrows of our yesterday.   Dream yields to dream, strife follows strife,    And Death unweaves the webs of Life.    For us the travail and the heat,   The broken secrets of our pride,   The strenuous lessons of defeat,   The flower deferred, the fruit denied;   But not the peace, supremely won,   Lord Buddha, of thy Lotus-throne.    With futile hands we seek to gain   Our inaccessible desire,   Diviner summits to attain,   With faith that sinks and feet that tire;   But nought shall conquer or control   The heavenward hunger of our soul.    The end, elusive and afar,   Still lures us with its beckoning flight,   And all our mortal moments are   A session of the Infinite.   How shall we reach the great, unknown   Nirvana of thy Lotus-throne?    [end]"]]]
