A boundless pity poured out of his heart to cover and transfigure these defects, and he had an impulse to make up to her for them, if he could, by sacrificing himself to her, if she desired. If she felt toward him as he toward Madeline, it were worth his life to save the pity of another such heart-breaking. So should he atone, perhaps, for the suffering Madeline had given him.  After tea he went by himself to nurse these wretched thoughts, and although the sight of Ida had suggested them, he went on to think of himself, and soon became so absorbed in his own misery that he quite forgot about her, and, failing to rejoin the girls that evening, Ida had to go home alone, which was a great disappointment to her. But it was, perhaps, quite as well, on the whole, for both of them that he was not thrown with her again that evening.  It is never fair to take for granted that the greatness of a sorrow or a loss is a just measure of the fault of the one who causes it. Madeline was not willingly cruel. She felt sorry in a way for Henry whenever his set lips and haggard face came under her view, but sorry in a dim and distant way, as one going on a far and joyous journey is sorry for the former associates he leaves behind, associates whose faces already, ere he goes, begin to grow faded and indistinct. At the wooing of Cordis her heart had awaked, and in the high, new joy of loving, she scorned the tame delight of being loved, which, until then, had been her only idea of the passion.  Henry presently discovered that, to stay in the village a looker-on while the love affair of Madeline and Cordis progressed to its consummation, was going to be too much for him. Instead of his getting used to the situation, it seemed to grow daily more insufferable. Every evening the thought that they were together made him feverish and restless till toward midnight, when, with the reflection that Cordis had surely by that time left her, came a possibility of sleep.  And yet, all this time he was not conscious of any special hate toward that young man.. If he had been in his power he would probably have left him unharmed. He could not, indeed, have raised his hand against anything which Madeline cared for. However great his animosity had been, that fact would have made his rival taboo to him. That Madeline had turned away from him was the great matter. Whither she was turned was of subordinate importance. His trouble was that she loved Cordis, not that Cordis loved her. It is only low and narrow natures which can find vent for their love disappointments in rage against their successors. In the strictest, truest sense, indeed, although it is certainly a hard saying, there is no room in a clear mind for such a feeling of jealousy. For the way in which every two hearts approach each other is necessarily a peculiar combination of individualities, never before and never after exactly duplicated in human experience. So that, if we can conceive of a woman truly loving several lovers, whether successively or simultaneously, they would not be rivals, for the manner of her love for each, and the manner of each one's love for her, is peculiar and single, even as if they two were alone in the world. The higher the mental grade of the persons concerned, the wider their sympathies, and the more delicate their perceptions, the more true is this.  Henry had been recently offered a very good position in an arms manufactory in Boston, and, having made up his mind to leave the village, he wrote to accept it, and promptly followed his letter, having first pledged his sole Newville correspondent, Laura, to make no references to Madeline in her letters.  \"If they should be married,\" he was particular to say, \"don't tell me about it till some time afterward.\"  Perhaps he worked the better in his new place because he was unhappy. The foe of good work is too easy self-complacency, too ready self-satisfaction, and the tendency to a pleased and relaxed contemplation of life and one's surroundings, growing out of a well-to-do state. Such a smarting sense of defeat, of endless aching loss as filled his mind at this time, was a most exacting background for his daily achievements in business and money-making to show up against. He had lost that power of enjoying rest which is at once the reward and limitation of human endeavour. Work was his nepenthe, and the difference between poor, superficial work and the best, most absorbing, was simply that between a weaker and a stronger opiate. He prospered in his affairs, was promoted to a position of responsibility with a good salary, and, moreover, was able to dispose of a patent in gun-barrels at a handsome price.  With the hope of distracting his mind from morbid brooding over what was past helping, he went into society, and endeavoured to interest himself in young ladies. But in these efforts his success was indifferent. Whenever he began to flatter himself that he was gaining a philosophical calm, the glimpse of some face on the street that reminded him of Madeline's, an accent of a voice that recalled hers, the sight of her in a dream, brought back in a moment the old thrall and the old bitterness with undiminished strength.  Eight or nine months after he had left home the longing to return and see what had happened became irresistible. Perhaps, after all--  Although this faint glimmer of a doubt was of his own making, and existed only because he had forbidden Laura to tell him to the contrary, he actually took some comfort in it. While he did not dare to put the question to Laura, yet he allowed himself to dream that something might possibly have happened to break off the match. He was far, indeed, from formally consenting to entertain such a hope. He professed to himself that he had no doubt that she was married and lost to him for ever. Had anything happened to break off the match, Laura would certainly have lost no time in telling him such good news. It was childishness to fancy aught else. But no effort of the reason can quite close the windows of the heart against hope, and, like a furtive ray of sunshine finding its way through a closed shutter, the thought that, after all, she might be free surreptitiously illumined the dark place in which he sat.  When the train stopped at Newville he slipped through the crowd at the station with the briefest possible greetings to the acquaintances he saw, and set out to gain his father's house by a back street.  On the way he met Harry Tuttle, and could not avoid stopping to exchange a few words with him.. As they talked, he was in a miserable panic of apprehension lest Harry should blurt out something about Madeline's being married. He felt that he could only bear to hear it from Laura's lips. Whenever the other opened his mouth to speak, a cold dew started out on Henry's forehead for fear he was going to make some allusion to Madeline; and when at last they separated without his having done so, there was such weakness in his limbs as one feels who first walks after a sickness.  He saw his folly now, his madness, in allowing himself to dally with a baseless hope, which, while never daring to own its own existence, had yet so mingled its enervating poison with every vein that he had now no strength left to endure the disappointment so certain and so near. At the very gate of his father's house he paused. A powerful impulse seized him to fly. It was not yet too late. Why had he come? He would go back to Boston, and write Laura by the next mail, and adjure her to tell him nothing. Some time he might bear to hear the truth, but not to-day, not now; no, not now. What had he been thinking of to risk it? He would get away where nobody could reach him to slay with a word this shadow of a hope which had become such a necessity of life to him, as is opium to the victim whose strength it has sapped and alone replaces. It was too late! Laura, as she sat sewing by the window, had looked up and seen him, and now as he came slowly up the walk she appeared at the door, full of exclamations of surprise and pleasure. He went in, and they sat down.  \"I thought I'd run out and see how you all were,\" he said, with a ghastly smile.  \"I'm so glad you did! Father was wondering only this morning if you were never coming to see us again.\"  He wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"I thought I'd just run out and see you.\"  \"Yes, I'm so glad you did!\"  She did not show that she noticed his merely having said the same thing over.  \"Are you pretty well this spring?\" she asked.  \"Yes, I'm pretty well.\"  \"Father was so much pleased about your patent. He's ever so proud of you.\"  After a pause, during which Henry looked nervously from point to point about the room, he said--  \"Is he?\"  \"Yes, very, and so am I.\"  There was a long silence, and Laura took up her work-basket, and bent her face over it, and seemed to have a good deal of trouble in finding some article in it.  Suddenly he said, in a quick, spasmodic way--  \"Is Madeline married?\"  Good God! Would she never speak!  \"No,\" she answered, with a falling inflection.  His heart, which had stopped beating, sent a flood of blood through every artery. But she had spoken as if it were the worst of news, instead of good. Ah! could it be? In all his thoughts, in all his dreams by night or day, he had never thought, he had never dreamed of that.  \"Is she dead?\" he asked, slowly, with difficulty, his will stamping the shuddering thought into words, as the steel die stamps coins from strips of metal.  \"No,\" she replied again, with the same ill-boding tone.  \"In God's name, what is it?\" he cried, springing to his feet. Laura looked out at the window so that she might not meet his eye as she answered, in a barely audible voice--  \"There was a scandal, and he deserted her; and afterward--only last week--she ran away,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],["title","The Amateur Cracksman (#0)"],["body","AMATEUR CRACKSMAN   BY  E.

The scene of my disaster was much as I had left it. The baccarat-counters still strewed the table, with the empty glasses and the loaded ash-trays.  A window had been opened to let the smoke out, and was letting in the fog instead.  Raffles himself had merely discarded his dining jacket for one of his innumerable blazers.  Yet he arched his eyebrows as though I had dragged him from his bed.  \"Forgotten something?\" said he, when he saw me on his mat.  \"No,\" said I, pushing past him without ceremony.  And I led the way into his room with an impudence amazing to myself.  \"Not come back for your revenge, have you?  Because I'm afraid I can't give it to you single-handed.  I was sorry myself that the others--\"  We were face to face by his fireside, and I cut him short.  \"Raffles,\" said I, \"you may well be surprised at my coming back in this way and at this hour.  I hardly know you.  I was never in your rooms before to-night.  But I fagged for you at school, and you said you remembered me.  Of course that's no excuse; but will you listen to me--for two minutes?\"  In my emotion I had at first to struggle for every word; but his face reassured me as I went on, and I was not mistaken in its expression.  \"Certainly, my dear man,\" said he; \"as many minutes as you like.  Have a Sullivan and sit down.\"  And he handed me his silver cigarette-case.  \"No,\" said I, finding a full voice as I shook my head; \"no, I won't smoke, and I won't sit down, thank you.  Nor will you ask me to do either when you've heard what I have to say.\"  \"Really?\" said he, lighting his own cigarette with one clear blue eye upon me.  \"How do you know?\"  \"Because you'll probably show me the door,\" I cried bitterly; \"and you will be justified in doing it!  But it's no use beating about the bush. You know I dropped over two hundred just now?\"  He nodded.  \"I hadn't the money in my pocket.\"  \"I remember.\"  \"But I had my check-book, and I wrote each of you a check at that desk.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Not one of them was worth the paper it was written on, Raffles.  I am overdrawn already at my bank!\"  \"Surely only for the moment?\"  \"No.  I have spent everything.\"  \"But somebody told me you were so well off. I heard you had come in for money?\"  \"So I did.  Three years ago.  It has been my curse; now it's all gone--every penny!  Yes, I've been a fool; there never was nor will be such a fool as I've been....  Isn't this enough for you?  Why don't you turn me out?\"  He was walking up and down with a very long face instead.  \"Couldn't your people do anything?\" he asked at length.  \"Thank God,\" I cried, \"I have no people!  I was an only child.  I came in for everything there was.  My one comfort is that they're gone, and will never know.\"  I cast myself into a chair and hid my face. Raffles continued to pace the rich carpet that was of a piece with everything else in his rooms. There was no variation in his soft and even footfalls.  \"You used to be a literary little cuss,\" he said at length; \"didn't you edit the mag. before you left?  Anyway I recollect fagging you to do my verses; and literature of all sorts is the very thing nowadays; any fool can make a living at it.\"  I shook my head.  \"Any fool couldn't write off my debts,\" said I.  \"Then you have a flat somewhere?\" he went on.  \"Yes, in Mount Street.\"  \"Well, what about the furniture?\"  I laughed aloud in my misery.  \"There's been a bill of sale on every stick for months!\"  And at that Raffles stood still, with raised eyebrows and stern eyes that I could meet the better now that he knew the worst; then, with a shrug, he resumed his walk, and for some minutes neither of us spoke. But in his handsome, unmoved face I read my fate and death-warrant; and with every breath I cursed my folly and my cowardice in coming to him at all.  Because he had been kind to me at school, when he was captain of the eleven, and I his fag, I had dared to look for kindness from him now; because I was ruined, and he rich enough to play cricket all the summer, and do nothing for the rest of the year, I had fatuously counted on his mercy, his sympathy, his help!  Yes, I had relied on him in my heart, for all my outward diffidence and humility; and I was rightly served.  There was as little of mercy as of sympathy in that curling nostril, that rigid jaw, that cold blue eye which never glanced my way.  I caught up my hat.  I blundered to my feet.  I would have gone without a word; but Raffles stood between me and the door.  \"Where are you going?\" said he.  \"That's my business,\" I replied.  \"I won't trouble YOU any more.\"  \"Then how am I to help you?\"  \"I didn't ask your help.\"  \"Then why come to me?\"  \"Why, indeed!\" I echoed.  \"Will you let me pass?\"  \"Not until you tell me where you are going and what you mean to do.\"  \"Can't you guess?\" I cried.  And for many seconds we stood staring in each other's eyes.  \"Have you got the pluck?\" said he, breaking the spell in a tone so cynical that it brought my last drop of blood to the boil.  \"You shall see,\" said I, as I stepped back and whipped the pistol from my overcoat pocket. \"Now, will you let me pass or shall I do it here?\"  The barrel touched my temple, and my thumb the trigger.  Mad with excitement as I was, ruined, dishonored, and now finally determined to make an end of my misspent life, my only surprise to this day is that I did not do so then and there. The despicable satisfaction of involving another in one's destruction added its miserable appeal to my baser egoism; and had fear or horror flown to my companion's face, I shudder to think I might have died diabolically happy with that look for my last impious consolation.  It was the look that came instead which held my hand.  Neither fear nor horror were in it; only wonder, admiration, and such a measure of pleased expectancy as caused me after all to pocket my revolver with an oath.  \"You devil!\" I said.  \"I believe you wanted me to do it!\"  \"Not quite,\" was the reply, made with a little start, and a change of color that came too late. \"To tell you the truth, though, I half thought you meant it, and I was never more fascinated in my life.  I never dreamt you had such stuff in you, Bunny!  No, I'm hanged if I let you go now.  And you'd better not try that game again, for you won't catch me stand and look on a second time.  We must think of some way out of the mess.  I had no idea you were a chap of that sort!  There, let me have the gun.\"  One of his hands fell kindly on my shoulder, while the other slipped into my overcoat pocket, and I suffered him to deprive me of my weapon without a murmur.  Nor was this simply because Raffles had the subtle power of making himself irresistible at will.  He was beyond comparison the most masterful man whom I have ever known; yet my acquiescence was due to more than the mere subjection of the weaker nature to the stronger. The forlorn hope which had brought me to the Albany was turned as by magic into an almost staggering sense of safety.  Raffles would help me after all!  A. J. Raffles would be my friend!  It was as though all the world had come round suddenly to my side; so far therefore from resisting his action, I caught and clasped his hand with a fervor as uncontrollable as the frenzy which had preceded it.  \"God bless you!\" I cried.  \"Forgive me for everything.  I will tell you the truth.  I DID think you might help me in my extremity, though I well knew that I had no claim upon you.  Still--for the old school's sake--the sake of old times--I thought you might give me another chance.  If you wouldn't I meant to blow out my brains--and will still if you change your mind!\"  In truth I feared that it was changing, with his expression, even as I spoke, and in spite of his kindly tone and kindlier use of my old school nickname.  His next words showed me my mistake.  \"What a boy it is for jumping to conclusions! I have my vices, Bunny, but backing and filling is not one of them.  Sit down, my good fellow, and have a cigarette to soothe your nerves.  I insist.  Whiskey?  The worst thing for you; here's some coffee that I was brewing when you came in.  Now listen to me.  You speak of 'another chance.'  What do you mean?  Another chance at baccarat?  Not if I know it!  You think the luck must turn; suppose it didn't?  We should only have made bad worse.  No, my dear chap, you've plunged enough. Do you put yourself in my hands or do you not? Very well, then you plunge no more, and I undertake not to present my check.  Unfortunately there are the other men; and still more unfortunately, Bunny, I'm as hard up at this moment as you are yourself!\"  It was my turn to stare at Raffles.  \"You?\" I vociferated.  \"You hard up?  How am I to sit here and believe that?\"  \"Did I refuse to believe it of you?\" he returned, smiling.  \"And, with your own experience, do you think that because a fellow has rooms in this place, and belongs to a club or two, and plays a little cricket, he must necessarily have a balance at the bank?  I tell you, my dear man, that at this moment I'm as hard up as you ever were.  I have nothing but my wits to live on--absolutely nothing else. It was as necessary for me to win some money this evening as it was for you. We're in the same boat, Bunny; we'd better pull together.\"  \"Together!\"  I jumped at it.  \"I'll do anything in this world for you, Raffles,\" I said, \"if you really mean that you won't give me away. Think of anything you like, and I'll do it!  I was a desperate man when I came here, and I'm just as desperate now.  I don't mind what I do if only I can get out of this without a scandal.\"  Again"]]]
