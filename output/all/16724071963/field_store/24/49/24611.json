Why, they seem to be boys in my house. They are groaning.\"  \"I think they are a little upset at the result of the match, sir,\" said Jimmy Silver suavely. \"Fenn did not arrive, for some reason, till the end of the innings, so Mr Blackburn's won. The wicket was good, but a little fiery.\"  \"Thank you, Silver,\" replied Mr Kay with asperity. \"When I require explanations I will ask for them.\"  He darted out of the shop, and a moment later they heard him pouring out a flood of recriminations on the groaning fags.  \"There was _once_ a man who snubbed me,\" said Jimmy Silver. \"They buried him at Brookwood. Well, what are you going to do, Fenn? Going to play tonight? Harkee, boy. Say but the word, and I will beard this tyrant to his face.\"  Fenn rose.  \"Yes,\" he said briefly, \"I shall play. You'd better turn up. I think you'll enjoy it.\"  Silver said that no human power should keep him away.         *       *       *       *       *  The School concert was always one of the events of the summer term. There was a concert at the end of the winter term, too, but it was not so important. To a great many of those present the summer concert marked, as it were, the last flutter of their school life. On the morrow they would be Old Boys, and it behoved them to extract as much enjoyment from the function as they could. Under Mr Mullholland's rule the concert had become a very flourishing institution. He aimed at a high standard, and reached it. There was more than a touch of the austere about the music. A glance at the programme was enough to show the lover of airs of the trashy, clashy order that this was no place for him. Most of the items were serious. When it was thought necessary to introduce a lighter touch, some staidly rollicking number was inserted, some song that was saved--in spite of a catchy tune--by a halo of antiquity. Anything modern was taboo, unless it were the work of Gotsuchakoff, Thingummyowsky, or some other eminent foreigner. Foreign origin made it just possible.  The school prefects lurked during the performance at the doors and at the foot of the broad stone steps that led to the Great Hall. It was their duty to supply visitors with programmes.  Jimmy Silver had foregathered with Kennedy, Challis, and Williams at the junior door. The hall was full now, and their labours consequently at an end.  \"Pretty good 'gate',\" said Silver, looking in through the open door. \"It must be warm up in the gallery.\"  Across the further end of the hall a dais had been erected. On this the bulk of the school sat, leaving the body of the hall to the crowned heads, nobility, and gentry to whom Silver had referred in his conversation with Fenn.  \"It always is warm in the gallery,\" said Challis. \"I lost about two stone there every concert when I was a kid. We simply used to sit and melt.\"  \"And I tell you what,\" broke in Silver, \"it's going to get warmer before the end of the show. Do you notice that all Kay's house are sitting in a lump at the back. I bet they're simply spoiling for a row. Especially now Kay's running the concert. There's going to be a hot time in the old town tonight--you see if there isn't. Hark at 'em.\"  The choir had just come to the end of a little thing of Handel's. There was no reason to suppose that the gallery appreciated Handel. Nevertheless, they were making a deafening noise. Clouds of dust rose from the rhythmical stamping of many feet. The noise was loudest and the dust thickest by the big window, beneath which sat the men from Kay's. Things were warming up.  The gallery, with one last stamp which nearly caused the dais to collapse, quieted down. The masters in the audience looked serious. One or two of the visitors glanced over their shoulders with a smile. How excited the dear boys were at the prospect of holidays! Young blood! Young blood! Boys _would_ be boys.  The concert continued. Half-way through the programme there was a ten minutes' interval. Fenn's pianoforte solo was the second item of the second half.  He mounted the platform amidst howls of delight from the gallery. Applause at the Eckleton concerts was granted more for services in the playing-fields than merit as a musician. Kubelik or Paderewski would have been welcomed with a few polite handclaps. A man in the eleven or fifteen was certain of two minutes' unceasing cheers.  \"Evidently one of their heroes, my dear,\" said Paterfamilias to Materfamilias. \"I suppose he has won a scholarship at the University.\"  Paterfamilias' mind was accustomed to run somewhat upon scholarships at the University. What the school wanted was a batting average of forty odd or a bowling analysis in single figures.  Fenn played the \"Moonlight Sonata\". A trained musical critic would probably have found much to cavil at in his rendering of the piece, but it was undoubtedly good for a public school player. Of course he was encored. The gallery would have encored him if he had played with one finger, three mistakes to every bar.  \"I told Fenn,\" said Jimmy Silver, \"if he got an encore, that he ought to play the--My aunt! _He is!_\"  Three runs and half-a-dozen crashes, and there was no further room for doubt. Fenn was playing the \"Coon Band Contest\".  \"He's gone mad,\" gasped Kennedy.  Whether he had or not, it is certain that the gallery had. All the evening they had been stewing in an atmosphere like that of the inner room of a Turkish bath, and they were ready for anything. It needed but a trifle to set them off. The lilt of that unspeakable Yankee melody supplied that trifle. Kay's malcontents, huddled in their seats by the window, were the first to break out. Feet began to stamp in time to the music--softly at first, then more loudly. The wooden dais gave out the sound like a drum.  Other rioters joined in from the right. The noise spread through the gallery as a fire spreads through gorse. Soon three hundred pairs of well-shod feet were rising and falling. Somebody began to whistle. Everybody whistled. Mr Kay was on his feet, gesticulating wildly. His words were lost in the uproar.  For five minutes the din prevailed. Then, with a final crash, Fenn finished. He got up from the music-stool, bowed, and walked back to his place by the senior door. The musical efforts of the gallery changed to a storm of cheering and clapping.  The choir rose to begin the next piece.  Still the noise continued.  People began to leave the Hall--in ones and twos first, then in a steady stream which blocked the doorways. It was plain to the dullest intelligence that if there was going to be any more concert, it would have to be performed in dumb show. Mr Kay flung down his baton.  The visitors had left by now, and the gallery was beginning to follow their example, howling as it went.  \"Well,\" said Jimmy Silver cheerfully, as he went with Kennedy down the steps, \"I _think_ we may call that a record. By my halidom, there'll be a row about this later on.\"     V  CAMP   With the best intentions in the world, however, a headmaster cannot make a row about a thing unless he is given a reasonable amount of time to make it in. The concert being on the last evening of term, there was only a single morning before the summer holidays, and that morning was occupied with the prize-giving. The school assembled at ten o'clock with a shadowy hope that this prize-day would be more exciting than the general run of prize-days, but they were disappointed. The function passed off without sensation. The headmaster did not denounce the school in an impassioned speech from the dais. He did not refer to the events of the previous evening. At the same time, his demeanour was far from jovial. It lacked that rollicking bonhomie which we like to see in headmasters on prize-day. It was evident to the most casual observer that the affair was not closed. The school would have to pay the bill sooner or later. But eight weeks would elapse before the day of reckoning, which was a comforting thought.  The last prize was handed over to its rightful owner. The last and dullest vote of thanks had been proposed by the last and dullest member of the board of governors. The Bishop of Rumtifoo (who had been selected this year to distribute the prizes) had worked off his seventy minutes' speech (inaudible, of course, as usual), and was feeling much easier. The term had been formally declared at an end, and those members of the school corps who were going to camp were beginning to assemble in front of the buildings.  \"I wonder why it always takes about three hours to get us off to the station,\" said Jimmy Silver. \"I've been to camp two years now, and there's always been this rotting about in the grounds before we start. Nobody's likely to turn up to inspect us for the next hour or so. If any gent cares to put in a modest ginger-beer at the shop, I'm with him.\"  \"I don't see why we shouldn't,\" said Kennedy. He had seen Fenn go into the shop, and wished to talk to him. He had not seen him after the concert, and he thought it would be interesting to know how Kay had taken it, and what his comments had been on meeting Fenn in the house that night.  Fenn had not much to say.  \"He was rather worried,\" he said, grinning as if the recollection of the interview amused him. \"But he couldn't do anything. Of course, there'll be a row next term, but it can't be helped.\"  \"If I were you,\" said Silver, \"I should point out to them that you'd a perfect right to play what you liked for an encore. How were you to know the gallery would go off like that? You aren't responsible for them. Hullo, there's that bugle. Things seem to be on the move. We must go.\"  \"So long,\" said Fenn.  \"Goodbye. Mind you come off against Middlesex.\"  Kennedy stayed for a moment.  \"Has the Old Man said anything to you yet?\" he asked.  \"Not yet. He'll do that next term. It'll be something to look forward to.\"  Kennedy hurried off to take"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],["title","The Head of Kay's (#5)"],["body","place in the ranks.  Getting to camp at the end of the summer term is always a nuisance. Aldershot seems a long way from everywhere, and the trains take their time over the journey. Then, again, the heat always happens to be particularly oppressive on that day. Snow may have fallen on the day before, but directly one sets out for camp, the thermometer goes up into three figures. The Eckleton contingent marched into the lines damp and very thirsty.  Most of the other schools were already on the spot, and looked as if they had been spending the last few years there. There was nothing particular going on when the Eckleton warriors arrived, and everybody was lounging about in khaki and shirt-sleeves, looking exasperatingly cool. The only consolation which buoyed up the spirits of Eckleton was the reflection that in a short space of time, when the important-looking gentleman in uniform who had come to meet them had said all he wanted to say on the subject of rules and regulations, they would be like that too. Happy thought! If the man bucked up and cut short the peroration, there would be time for a bathe in Cove Reservoir. Those of the corps who had been to camp in previous years felt quite limp with the joy of the thought. Why couldn't he get through with it, and give a fellow a chance of getting cool again?  The gist of the oration was apparently that the Eckleton cadets were to consider themselves not only as soldiers--and as such subject to military discipline, and the rules for the conduct of troops quartered in the Aldershot district--but also as members of a public school. In short, that if they misbehaved themselves they would get cells, and a hundred lines in the same breath, as it were.  The corps knew all this ages ago. The man seemed to think he was telling them something fresh. They began positively to dislike him after a while.  He finished at last. Eckleton marched off wearily, but in style, to its lines.  \"Dis-miss!\"  They did.  \"And about time, too,\" said Jimmy Silver. \"I wish they would tie that man up, or something. He's one of the worst bores I know. He may be full of bright conversation in private life, but in public he will talk about his beastly military regulations. You can't stop him. It's a perfect mania with him. Now, I believe--that's to say, I have a sort of dim idea--that there's a place round about here called a canteen. I seem to remember such a thing vaguely. We might go and look for it.\"  Kennedy made no objection.  This was his first appearance at camp. Jimmy Silver, on the other hand, was a veteran. He had been there twice before, and meant to go again. He had a peculiar and extensive knowledge of the ins and outs of the place. Kennedy was quite willing to take him as his guide. He was full of information. Kennedy was surprised to see what a number of men from the other schools he seemed to know. In the canteen there were, amongst others, a Carthusian, two Tonbridge men, and a Haileyburian. They all greeted Silver with the warmth of old friends.  \"You get to know a lot of fellows in camp,\" explained Jimmy, as they strolled back to the Eckleton lines. \"That's the best of the place. Camp's the best place on earth, if only you have decent weather. See that chap over there? He came here last year. He'd never been before, and one of the things he didn't know was that Cove Reservoir's only about three feet deep round the sides. He took a running dive, and almost buried himself in the mud. It's about two feet deep. He told me afterwards he swallowed pounds of it. Rather bad luck. Somebody ought to have told him. You can't do much diving here.\"  \"Glad you mentioned it,\" said Kennedy. \"I should have dived myself if you hadn't.\"  Many other curious and diverting facts did the expert drag from the bonded warehouse of his knowledge. Nothing changes at camp. Once get to know the ropes, and you know them for all time.  \"The one thing I bar,\" he said, \"is having to get up at half-past five. And one day in the week, when there's a divisional field-day, it's half-past four. It's hardly worth while going to sleep at all. Still, it isn't so bad as it used to be. The first year I came to camp we used to have to do a three hours' field-day before brekker. We used to have coffee before it, and nothing else till it was over. By Jove, you felt you'd had enough of it before you got back. This is Laffan's Plain. The worst of Laffan's Plain is that you get to know it too well. You get jolly sick of always starting on field-days from the same place, and marching across the same bit of ground. Still, I suppose they can't alter the scenery for our benefit. See that man there? He won the sabres at Aldershot last year. That chap with him is in the Clifton footer team.\"  When a school corps goes to camp, it lives in a number of tents, and, as a rule, each house collects in a tent of its own. Blackburn's had a tent, and further down the line Kay's had assembled. The Kay contingent were under Wayburn, a good sort, as far as he himself was concerned, but too weak to handle a mob like Kay's. Wayburn was not coming back after the holidays, a fact which perhaps still further weakened his hold on the Kayites. They had nothing to fear from him next term.  Kay's was represented at camp by a dozen or so of its members, of whom young Billy Silver alone had any pretensions to the esteem of his fellow man. Kay's was the rowdiest house in the school, and the cream of its rowdy members had come to camp. There was Walton, for one, a perfect specimen of the public school man at his worst. There was Mortimer, another of Kay's gems. Perry, again, and Callingham, and the rest. A pleasant gang, fit for anything, if it could be done in safety.  Kennedy observed them, and--the spectacle starting a train of thought--asked Jimmy Silver, as they went into their tent just before lights-out, if there was much ragging in camp.  \"Not very much,\" said the expert. \"Chaps are generally too done up at the end of the day to want to do anything except sleep. Still, I've known cases. You sometimes get one tent mobbing another. They loose the ropes, you know. Low trick, I think. It isn't often done, and it gets dropped on like bricks when it's found out. But why? Do you feel as if you wanted to do it?\"  \"It only occurred to me that we've got a lively gang from Kay's here. I was wondering if they'd get any chances of ragging, or if they'd have to lie low.\"  \"I'd forgotten Kay's for the moment. Now you mention it, they are rather a crew. But I shouldn't think they'd find it worth while to rot about here. It isn't as if they were on their native heath. People have a prejudice against having their tent-ropes loosed, and they'd get beans if they did anything in that line. I remember once there was a tent which made itself objectionable, and it got raided in the night by a sort of vigilance committee from the other schools, and the chaps in it got the dickens of a time. None of them ever came to camp again. I hope Kay's'll try and behave decently. It'll be an effort for them; but I hope they'll make it. It would be an awful nuisance if young Billy made an ass of himself in any way. He loves making an ass of himself. It's a sort of hobby of his.\"  As if to support the statement, a sudden volley of subdued shouts came from the other end of the Eckleton lines.  \"Go it, Wren!\"  \"Stick to it, Silver!\"  \"Wren!\"  \"Silver!\"  \"S-s-h!\"  Silence, followed almost immediately by a gruff voice inquiring with simple directness what the dickens all this noise was about.  \"Hullo!\" said Kennedy. \"Did you hear that? I wonder what's been up? Your brother was in it, whatever it was.\"  \"Of course,\" said Jimmy Silver, \"he would be. We can't find out about it now, though. I'll ask him tomorrow, if I remember. I shan't remember, of course. Good night.\"  \"Good night.\"  Half an hour later, Kennedy, who had been ruminating over the incident in his usual painstaking way, reopened the debate.  \"Who's Wren?\" he asked.  \"Wha'?\" murmured Silver, sleepily.  \"Who's Wren?\" repeated Kennedy.  \"I d'know.... Oh.... Li'l' beast.... Kay's.... Red hair.... G'-ni'.\"  And sleep reigned in Blackburn's tent.     VI  THE RAID ON THE GUARD-TENT   Wren and Billy Silver had fallen out over a question of space. It was Silver's opinion that Wren's nest ought to have been built a foot or two further to the left. He stated baldly that he had not room to breathe, and requested the red-headed one to ease off a point or so in the direction of his next-door neighbour. Wren had refused, and, after a few moments' chatty conversation, smote William earnestly in the wind. Trouble had begun upon the instant. It had ceased almost as rapidly owing to interruptions from without, but the truce had been merely temporary. They continued the argument outside the tent at five-thirty the next morning, after the _reveille_ had sounded, amidst shouts of approval from various shivering mortals who were tubbing preparatory to embarking on the labours of the day.  A brisk first round had just come to a conclusion when Walton lounged out of the tent, yawning.  Walton proceeded to separate the combatants. After which he rebuked Billy Silver with a swagger-stick. Wren's share in the business he overlooked. He was by way of being a patron of Wren's, and he disliked Billy Silver, partly for his own sake and partly because he hated his brother, with whom he had come into contact once or twice during his career at Eckleton, always with unsatisfactory results.  So Walton dropped on to Billy Silver, and Wren continued his toilet rejoicing.  Camp was beginning the strenuous life now. Tent after tent emptied itself of its occupants, who stretched themselves vigorously, and proceeded towards the tubbing-ground, where there were tin baths for those who cared to wait until the same were vacant, and a good, honest pump for those who did not. Then there was that unpopular job, the piling of one's bedding outside the tent, and the rolling up"]]]
