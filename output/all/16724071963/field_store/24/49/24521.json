'Tis early practice only makes the master.  HEDWIG. Ah! Would to heaven they never learnt the art!  TELL. But they shall learn it, wife, in all its points. Whoe'er would carve an independent way Through life must learn to ward or plant a blow.  HEDWIG. Alas, alas! and they will never rest Contentedly at home.  TELL.            No more can I! I was not framed by nature for a shepherd. Restless I must pursue a changing course; I only feel the flush and joy of life In starting some fresh quarry every day.  HEDWIG. Heedless the while of all your wife's alarms As she sits watching through long hours at home. For my soul sinks with terror at the tales The servants tell about your wild adventures. Whene'er we part my trembling heart forebodes That you will ne'er come back to me again. I see you on the frozen mountain steeps, Missing, perchance, your leap from cliff to cliff; I see the chamois, with a wild rebound, Drag you down with him o'er the precipice. I see the avalanche close o'er your head, The treacherous ice give way, and you sink down Entombed alive within its hideous gulf. Ah! in a hundred varying forms does death Pursue the Alpine huntsman on his course. That way of life can surely ne'er be blessed, Where life and limb are perilled every hour.  TELL. The man that bears a quick and steady eye, And trusts to God and his own lusty sinews, Passes, with scarce a scar, through every danger. The mountain cannot awe the mountain child.     [Having finished his work, he lays aside his tools.  And now, methinks, the door will hold awhile. The axe at home oft saves the carpenter.  HEDWIG. Whither away!     [Takes his cap.  TELL. To Altdorf, to your father.  HEDWIG. You have some dangerous enterprise in view? Confess!  TELL. Why think you so?  HEDWIG.           Some scheme's on foot, Against the governors. There was a Diet Held on the Rootli--that I know--and you Are one of the confederacy I'm sure.  TELL. I was not there. Yet will I not hold back Whene'er my country calls me to her aid.  HEDWIG. Wherever danger is, will you be placed. On you, as ever, will the burden fall.  TELL. Each man shall have the post that fits his powers.  HEDWIG. You took--ay, 'mid the thickest of the storm-- The man of Unterwald across the lake. 'Tis a marvel you escaped. Had you no thought Of wife and children then?  TELL.               Dear wife, I had; And therefore saved the father for his children.  HEDWIG. To brave the lake in all its wrath; 'Twas not To put your trust in God! 'Twas tempting him.  TELL. The man that's over-cautious will do little.  HEDWIG. Yes, you've a kind and helping hand for all; But be in straits and who will lend you aid?  TELL. God grant I ne'er may stand in need of it!     [Takes up his crossbow and arrows.  HEDWIG. Why take your crossbow with you? Leave it here.  TELL. I want my right hand when I want my bow.     [The boys return.  WALTER. Where, father, are you going?  TELL.                 To grand-dad, boy-- To Altdorf. Will you go?  WALTER.               Ay, that I will!  HEDWIG. The viceroy's there just now. Go not to Altdorf.  TELL. He leaves to-day.  HEDWIG.           Then let him first be gone, Cross not his path. You know he bears us grudge.  TELL. His ill-will cannot greatly injure me. I do what's right, and care for no man's hate.  HEDWIG. 'Tis those who do what's right whom he most hates.  TELL. Because he cannot reach them. Me, I ween, His knightship will be glad to leave in peace.  HEDWIG. Ay! Are you sure of that?  TELL.               Not long ago, As I was hunting through the wild ravines Of Shechenthal, untrod by mortal foot,-- There, as I took my solitary way Along a shelving ledge of rocks, where 'twas Impossible to step on either side; For high above rose, like a giant wall, The precipice's side, and far below The Shechen thundered o'er its rifted bed;--     [The boys press towards him, looking upon him    with excited curiosity.  There, face to face, I met the viceroy. He Alone with me--and I myself alone-- Mere man to man, and near us the abyss. And when his lordship had perused my face, And knew the man he had severely fined On some most trivial ground not long before; And saw me, with my sturdy bow in hand, Come striding towards him, then his cheek grew pale, His knees refused their office, and I thought He would have sunk against the mountain side. Then, touched with pity for him, I advanced, Respectfully, and said, \"'Tis I, my lord.\" But ne'er a sound could he compel his lips To frame an answer. Only with his hand He beckoned me in silence to proceed. So I passed on, and sent his train to seek him.  HEDWIG. He trembled then before you? Woe the while You saw his weakness; that he'll not forgive.  TELL. I shun him, therefore, and he'll not seek me.  HEDWIG. But stay away to day. Go hunting rather!  TELL. What do you fear?  HEDWIG.           I am uneasy. Stay.  TELL. Why thus distress yourself without a cause?  HEDWIG. Because there is no cause. Tell, Tell! stay here!  TELL. Dear wife, I gave my promise I would go.  HEDWIG. Must you,--then go. But leave the boys with me.  WALTER. No, mother dear, I'm going with my father.  HEDWIG. How, Walter! Will you leave your mother then?  WALTER. I'll bring you pretty things from grandpapa.     [Exit with his father.  WILHELM. Mother, I'll stay with you!  HEDWIG (embracing him).                Yes, yes! thou art My own dear child. Thou'rt all that's left to me.     [She goes to the gate of the court, and looks anxiously    after TELL and her son for a considerable time.    SCENE II.     A retired part of the Forest. Brooks dashing in spray    over the rocks.     Enter BERTHA in a hunting dress. Immediately afterwards RUDENZ.  BERTHA. He follows me. Now to explain myself!  RUDENZ (entering hastily). At length, dear lady, we have met alone In this wild dell, with rocks on every side, No jealous eye can watch our interview. Now let my heart throw off this weary silence.  BERTHA. But are you sure they will not follow us?  RUDENZ. See, yonder goes the chase. Now, then, or never! I must avail me of the precious moment,-- Must hear my doom decided by thy lips, Though it should part me from thy side forever. Oh, do not arm that gentle face of thine With looks so stern and harsh! Who--who am I, That dare aspire so high as unto thee? Fame hath not stamped me yet; nor may I take My place amid the courtly throng of knights, That, crowned with glory's lustre, woo thy smiles. Nothing have I to offer but a heart That overflows with truth and love for thee.  BERTHA (sternly and with severity). And dare you speak to me of love--of truth? You, that are faithless to your nearest ties! You, that are Austria's slave--bartered and sold To her--an alien, and your country's tyrant!  RUDENZ. How! This reproach from thee! Whom do I seek On Austria's side, my own beloved, but thee?  BERTHA. Think you to find me in the traitor's ranks? Now, as I live, I'd rather give my hand To Gessler's self, all despot though he be, Than to the Switzer who forgets his birth, And stoops to be the minion of a tyrant.  RUDENZ. Oh heaven, what must I hear!  BERTHA.                Say! what can lie Nearer the good man's heart than friends and kindred? What dearer duty to a noble soul Than to protect weak, suffering innocence, And vindicate the rights of the oppressed? My very soul bleeds for your countrymen; I suffer with them, for I needs must love them; They are so gentle, yet so full of power; They draw my whole heart to them. Every day I look upon them with increased esteem. But you, whom nature and your knightly vow, Have given them as their natural protector, Yet who desert them and abet their foes, In forging shackles for your native land, You--you it is, that deeply grieve and wound me. I must constrain my heart, or I shall hate you.  RUDENZ. Is not my country's welfare all my wish? What seek I for her but to purchase peace 'Neath Austria's potent sceptre?  BERTHA.                  Bondage, rather! You would drive freedom from the last stronghold That yet remains for her upon the earth. The people know their own true interests better: Their simple natures are not warped by show, But round your head a tangling net is wound.  RUDENZ. Bertha, you hate me--you despise me!  BERTHA. Nay! And if I did, 'twere better for my peace. But to see him despised and despicable,-- The man whom one might love.  RUDENZ.                Oh, Bertha! You Show me the pinnacle of heavenly bliss, Then, in a moment, hurl me to despair!  BERTHA. No, no! the noble is not all extinct Within you. It but slumbers,--I will rouse it. It must have cost you many a fiery struggle To crush the virtues of your race within you. But, heaven be praised, 'tis mightier than yourself, And you are noble in your own despite!  RUDENZ. You trust me, then? Oh, Bertha, with thy love What might I not become?  BERTHA.              Be only that For which your own high nature destined you. Fill the position you were born to fill;-- Stand by your people and your native land. And battle for your sacred rights!  RUDENZ. Alas! How can I hope to win you--to possess you, If I take arms against the emperor? Will not your potent kinsman interpose, To dictate the disposal of your hand?  BERTHA. All my estates lie in the Forest Cantons; And I am free, when Switzerland is free.  RUDENZ. Oh! what a prospect, Bertha, hast thou shown me!  BERTHA. Hope not to win my hand by Austria's favor; Fain would they lay their grasp on my estates, To swell the vast domains which now they hold. The selfsame lust of conquest that would rob You of your liberty endangers mine. Oh, friend, I'm marked for sacrifice;--to be The guerdon of some parasite, perchance! They'll drag me hence to the imperial court That hateful haunt of falsehood and intrigue; There do detested marriage bonds await me. Love, love alone,--your love can rescue me.  RUDENZ.

A TRAGEDY.               By Frederich Schiller    NOTE: The translation of MARY STUART is that by the late Joseph Mellish, who appears to have been on terms of intimate friendship with Schiller. His version was made from the prompter's copy, before the play was published, and, like Coleridge's Wallenstein, contains many passages not found in the printed edition. These are distinguished by brackets. On the other hand, Mr. Mellish omitted many passages which now form part of the printed drama, all of which are now added. The translation, as a whole, stands out from similar works of the time (1800) in almost as marked a degree as Coleridge's Wallenstein, and some passages exhibit powers of a high order; a few, however, especially in the earlier scenes, seemed capable of improvement, and these have been revised, but, in deference to the translator, with a sparing hand.     DRAMATIS PERSONAE.  ELIZABETH, Queen of England. MARY STUART, Queen of Scots, a Prisoner in England. ROBERT DUDLEY, Earl of Leicester. GEORGE TALBOT, Earl of Shrewsbury. WILLIAM CECIL, Lord Burleigh, Lord High Treasurer. EARL OF KENT. SIR WILLIAM DAVISON, Secretary of State. SIR AMIAS PAULET, Keeper of MARY. SIR EDWARD MORTIMER, his Nephew. COUNT L'AUBESPINE, the French Ambassador. O'KELLY, Mortimer's Friend. COUNT BELLIEVRE, Envoy Extraordinary from France. SIR DRUE DRURY, another Keeper of MARY. SIR ANDREW MELVIL, her House Steward. BURGOYNE, her Physician. HANNAH KENNEDY, her Nurse. MARGARET CURL, her Attendant. Sheriff of the County. Officer of the Guard. French and English Lords. Soldiers. Servants of State belonging to ELIZABETH. Servants and Female Attendants of the Queen of Scots.     ACT I.  SCENE I.     A common apartment in the Castle of Fotheringay.     HANNAH KENNEDY, contending violently with PAULET, who is about    to break open a closet; DRURY with an iron crown.  KENNEDY. How now, sir? what fresh outrage have we here? Back from that cabinet!  PAULET.              Whence came the jewel? I know 'twas from an upper chamber thrown; And you would bribe the gardener with your trinkets. A curse on woman's wiles! In spite of all My strict precaution and my active search, Still treasures here, still costly gems concealed! And doubtless there are more where this lay hid.     [Advancing towards the cabinet.  KENNEDY. Intruder, back! here lie my lady's secrets.  PAULET. Exactly what I seek.             [Drawing forth papers.  KENNEDY.            Mere trifling papers; The amusements only of an idle pen, To cheat the dreary tedium of a dungeon.  PAULET. In idle hours the evil mind is busy.  KENNEDY. Those writings are in French.  PAULET.                 So much the worse! That tongue betokens England's enemy.  KENNEDY. Sketches of letters to the Queen of England.  PAULET. I'll be their bearer. Ha! what glitters here?     [He touches a secret spring, and draws out jewels from    a private drawer.  A royal diadem enriched with stones, And studded with the fleur-de-lis of France.     [He hands it to his assistant.  Here, take it, Drury; lay it with the rest.                   [Exit DRURY.  [And ye have found the means to hide from us Such costly things, and screen them, until now, From our inquiring eyes?]  KENNEDY.              Oh, insolent And tyrant power, to which we must submit.  PAULET. She can work ill as long as she hath treasures; For all things turn to weapons in her hands.  KENNEDY (supplicating). Oh, sir! be merciful; deprive us not Of the last jewel that adorns our life! 'Tis my poor lady's only joy to view This symbol of her former majesty; Your hands long since have robbed us of the rest.  PAULET. 'Tis in safe custody; in proper time 'Twill be restored to you with scrupulous care.  KENNEDY. Who that beholds these naked walls could say That majesty dwelt here? Where is the throne? Where the imperial canopy of state? Must she not set her tender foot, still used To softest treading, on the rugged ground? With common pewter, which the lowliest dame Would scorn, they furnish forth her homely table.  PAULET. Thus did she treat her spouse at Stirling once; And pledged, the while, her paramour in gold.  KENNEDY. Even the mirror's trifling aid withheld.  PAULET. The contemplation of her own vain image Incites to hope, and prompts to daring deeds.  KENNEDY. Books are denied her to divert her mind.  PAULET. The Bible still is left to mend her heart.  KENNEDY. Even of her very lute she is deprived!  PAULET. Because she tuned it to her wanton airs.  KENNEDY. Is this a fate for her, the gentle born, Who in her very cradle was a queen? Who, reared in Catherine's luxurious court, Enjoyed the fulness of each earthly pleasure? Was't not enough to rob her of her power, Must ye then envy her its paltry tinsel? A noble heart in time resigns itself To great calamities with fortitude; But yet it cuts one to the soul to part At once with all life's little outward trappings!  PAULET. These are the things that turn the human heart To vanity, which should collect itself In penitence; for a lewd, vicious life, Want and abasement are the only penance.  KENNEDY. If youthful blood has led her into error, With her own heart and God she must account: There is no judge in England over her.  PAULET. She shall have judgment where she hath transgressed.  KENNEDY. Her narrow bonds restrain her from transgression.  PAULET. And yet she found the means to stretch her arm Into the world, from out these narrow bonds, And, with the torch of civil war, inflame This realm against our queen (whom God preserve). And arm assassin bands. Did she not rouse From out these walls the malefactor Parry, And Babington, to the detested crime Of regicide? And did this iron grate Prevent her from decoying to her toils The virtuous heart of Norfolk? Saw we not The first, best head in all this island fall A sacrifice for her upon the block? [The noble house of Howard fell with him.] And did this sad example terrify These mad adventurers, whose rival zeal Plunges for her into this deep abyss? The bloody scaffold bends beneath the weight Of her new daily victims; and we ne'er Shall see an end till she herself, of all The guiltiest, be offered up upon it. Oh! curses on the day when England took This Helen to its hospitable arms.  KENNEDY. Did England then receive her hospitably? Oh, hapless queen! who, since that fatal day When first she set her foot within this realm, And, as a suppliant--a fugitive-- Came to implore protection from her sister, Has been condemned, despite the law of nations, And royal privilege, to weep away The fairest years of youth in prison walls. And now, when she hath suffered everything Which in imprisonment is hard and bitter, Is like a felon summoned to the bar, Foully accused, and though herself a queen, Constrained to plead for honor and for life.  PAULET. She came amongst us as a murderess, Chased by her very subjects from a throne Which she had oft by vilest deeds disgraced. Sworn against England's welfare came she hither, To call the times of bloody Mary back, Betray our church to Romish tyranny, And sell our dear-bought liberties to France. Say, why disdained she to subscribe the treaty Of Edinborough--to resign her claim To England's crown--and with one single word, Traced by her pen, throw wide her prison gates? No:--she had rather live in vile confinement, And see herself ill-treated, than renounce The empty honors of her barren title. Why acts she thus? Because she trusts to wiles, And treacherous arts of base conspiracy; And, hourly plotting schemes of mischief, hopes To conquer, from her prison, all this isle.  KENNEDY. You mock us, sir, and edge your cruelty With words of bitter scorn:--that she should form Such projects; she, who's here immured alive, To whom no sound of comfort, not a voice Of friendship comes from her beloved home; Who hath so long no human face beheld, Save her stern gaoler's unrelenting brows; Till now, of late, in your uncourteous cousin She sees a second keeper, and beholds Fresh bolts and bars against her multiplied.  PAULET. No iron-grate is proof against her wiles. How do I know these bars are not filed through? How that this floor, these walls, that seem so strong Without, may not be hollow from within, And let in felon treachery when I sleep? Accursed office, that's intrusted to me, To guard this cunning mother of all ill! Fear scares me from my sleep; and in the night I, like a troubled spirit, roam and try The strength of every bolt, and put to proof Each guard's fidelity:--I see, with fear, The dawning of each morn, which may confirm My apprehensions:--yet, thank God, there's hope That all my fears will soon be at an end; For rather would I at the gates of hell Stand sentinel, and guard the devilish host Of damned souls, than this deceitful queen.  KENNEDY. Here comes the queen.  PAULET.             Christ's image in her hand. Pride, and all worldly lusts within her heart.    SCENE II.     The same. Enter MARY, veiled, a crucifix in her hand.  KENNEDY (hastening toward her). O gracious queen! they tread us under foot; No end of tyranny and base oppression; Each coming day heaps fresh indignities, New sufferings on thy royal head.  MARY.                   Be calm-- Say, what has happened?  KENNEDY.              See! thy cabinet Is forced--thy papers--and thy only treasure, Which with such pains we had secured, the last Poor remnant of thy bridal ornaments From France, is in his hands--naught now remains Of royal state--thou art indeed bereft!  MARY. Compose yourself, my Hannah! and believe me, 'Tis not these baubles that can make a queen-- Basely indeed they may behave to us, But they cannot debase us. I have learned To use myself to many a change in England; I can support this too. Sir, you have taken By force what I this very day designed To have delivered to you. There's a letter Amongst these papers for my royal sister Of England. Pledge me, sir, your word of honor, To give it to her"]]]
