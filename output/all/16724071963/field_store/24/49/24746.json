He decided to go uptown, select a hotel, and lunch. To the need for lunch he attributed a certain sinking sensation of which he was becoming more and more aware, and which bore much too close a resemblance to dismay to be pleasant. The poet's statement that \"the man who's square, his chances always are best; no circumstance can shoot a scare into the contents of his vest,\" is only true within limits. The squarest men, deposited suddenly in New York and faced with the prospect of earning his living there, is likely to quail for a moment. New York is not like other cities. London greets the stranger with a sleepy grunt. Paris giggles. New York howls. A gladiator, waiting in the center of the arena while the Colosseum officials fumbled with the bolts of the door behind which paced the noisy tiger he was to fight, must have had some of the emotions which John experienced during his first hour as a masterless man in Gotham.  A surface car carried him up Broadway. At Times Square the Astor Hotel loomed up on the left. It looked a pretty good hotel to John. He dismounted.  Half an hour later he decided that he was acclimated. He had secured a base of operations in the shape of a room on the seventh floor, his check was safely deposited in the hotel bank, and he was half-way through a lunch which had caused him already to look on New York not only as the finest city in the world, but also, on the whole, as the one city of all others in which a young man might make a fortune with the maximum of speed and the minimum of effort.  After lunch, having telegraphed his address to his uncle in case of mail, he took the latter's excellent advice and went to the polo grounds. Returning in time to dress, he dined at the hotel, after which he visited a near-by theater, and completed a pleasant and strenuous day at one of those friendly restaurants where the music is continuous and the waiters are apt to burst into song in the intervals of their other duties.  A second attempt to find Smith next morning failed, as the first had done. The staff of the News were out of bed and at work ridiculously early, and when John called up the office between eleven and twelve o'clock--nature's breakfast-hour--Smith was again down East, observing the movements of those who were about to strike or who had already struck.  It hardly seemed worth while starting to lay the bed plates of his fortune till he had consulted the expert. What would Rockefeller have done? He would, John felt certain, have gone to the ball-game.  He imitated the great financier.         *       *       *       *       *  It was while he was smoking a cigar after dinner that night, musing on the fortunes of the day's game and, in particular, on the almost criminal imbecility of the umpire, that he was dreamily aware that he was being \"paged.\" A small boy in uniform was meandering through the room, chanting his name.  \"Gent wants five minutes wit' you,\" announced the boy, intercepted. \"Hasn't got no card. Business, he says.\"  This disposed of the idea that Rupert Smith had discovered his retreat. John was puzzled. He could not think of another person in New York who knew of his presence at the Astor. But it was the unknown that he was in search of, and he decided to see the mysterious stranger.  \"Send him along,\" he said.  The boy disappeared, and presently John observed him threading his way back among the tables, followed by a young man of extraordinary gravity of countenance, who was looking about him with an intent gaze through a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.  John got up to meet him.  \"My name is Maude,\" he said. \"Won't you sit down? Have you had dinner?\"  \"Thank you, yes,\" said the spectacled young man.  \"You'll have a cigar and coffee, then?\"  \"Thank you, yes.\"  The young man remained silent until the waiter had filled his cup.  \"My name is Crump,\" he said. \"I am Mr. Benjamin Scobell's private secretary.\"  \"Yes?\" said John. \"Snug job?\"  The other seemed to miss something in his voice.  \"You have heard of Mr. Scobell?\" he asked.  \"Not to my knowledge,\" said John.  \"Ah! you have lost touch very much with Mervo, of course.\"  John stared.  \"Mervo?\"  It sounded like some patent medicine.  \"I have been instructed,\" said Mr. Crump solemnly, \"to inform Your Highness that the Republic has been dissolved, and that your subjects offer you the throne of your ancestors.\"  John leaned back in his chair, and looked at the speaker in dumb amazement. The thought flashed across him that Mr. Crump had been perfectly correct in saying that he had dined.  His attitude appeared to astound Mr. Crump. He goggled through his spectacles at John, who was reminded of some rare fish.  \"You are John Maude? You said you were.\"  \"I'm John Maude right enough. We're solid on that point.\"  \"And your mother was the only sister of Mr. Andrew Westley?\"  \"You're right there, too.\"  \"Then there is no mistake. I say the Republic--\" He paused, as if struck with an idea. \"Don't you know?\" he said. \"Your father--\"  John became suddenly interested.  \"If you've got anything to tell me about my father, go right ahead. You'll be the only man I've ever met who has said a word about him. Who the deuce was he, anyway?\"  Mr. Crump's face cleared.  \"I understand. I had not expected this. You have been kept in ignorance. Your father, Mr. Maude, was the late Prince Charles of Mervo.\"  It was not easy to astonish John, but this announcement did so. He dropped his cigar in a shower of gray ash on to his trousers, and retrieved it almost mechanically, his wide-open eyes fixed on the other's face.  \"What!\" he cried.  Mr. Crump nodded gravely.  \"You are Prince John of Mervo, and I am here--\" he got into his stride as he reached the familiar phrase--\"to inform Your Highness that the Republic has been dissolved, and that your subjects offer you the throne of your ancestors.\"  A horrid doubt seized John.  \"You're stringing me. One of those Indians at the _News_, Rupert Smith, or someone, has put you up to this.\"  Mr. Crump appeared wounded.  \"If Your Highness would glance at these documents-- This is a copy of the register of the church in which your mother and father were married.\"  John glanced at the document. It was perfectly lucid.  \"Then--then it's true!\" he said.  \"Perfectly true, Your Highness. And I am here to inform--\"  \"But where the deuce is Mervo? I never heard of the place.\"  \"It is an island principality in the Mediterranean, Your High--\"  \"For goodness' sake, old man, don't keep calling me 'Your Highness.' It may be fun to you, but it makes me feel a perfect ass. Let me get into the thing gradually.\"  Mr. Crump felt in his pocket.  \"Mr. Scobell,\" he said, producing a roll of bills, \"entrusted me with money to defray any expenses--\"  More than any words, this spectacle removed any lingering doubt which John might have had as to the possibility of this being some intricate practical joke.  \"Are these for me?\" he said.  Mr. Crump passed them across to him.  \"There are a thousand dollars here,\" he said. \"I am also instructed to say that you are at liberty to draw further against Mr. Scobell's account at the Wall Street office of the European and Asiatic Bank.\"  The name Scobell had been recurring like a _leit-motif_ in Mr. Crump's conversation. This suddenly came home to John.  \"Before we go any further,\" he said, \"let's get one thing clear. Who is this Mr. Scobell? How does he get mixed up in this?\"  \"He is the proprietor of the Casino at Mervo.\"  \"He seems to be one of those generous, open-handed fellows. Nothing of the tight wad about him.\"  \"He is deeply interested in Your High--in your return.\"  John laid the roll of bills beside his coffee cup, and relighted his cigar.  \"That's mighty good of him,\" he said. \"It strikes me, old man, that I am not absolutely up-to-date as regards the internal affairs of this important little kingdom of mine. How would it be if you were to put me next to one or two facts? Start at the beginning and go right on.\"  When Mr. Crump had finished a condensed history of Mervo and Mervian politics, John smoked in silence for some minutes.  \"Life, Crump,\" he said at last, \"is certainly speeding up as far as I am concerned. Up till now nothing in particular has ever happened to me. A couple of days ago I lost my job, was given ten thousand dollars that I didn't know existed, and now you tell me I'm a prince. Well, well! These are stirring times. When do we start for the old homestead?\"  \"Mr. Scobell was exceedingly anxious that we should return by Saturday's boat.\"  \"Saturday? What, to-morrow?\"  \"Perhaps it is too soon. You will not be able to settle your affairs?\"  \"I guess I can settle my affairs all right. I've only got to pack a grip and tip the bell hops. And as Scobell seems to be financing this show, perhaps it's up to me to step lively if he wants it. But it's a pity. I was just beginning to like this place. There is generally something doing along the White Way after twilight, Crump.\"  The gravity of Mr. Scobell's secretary broke up unexpectedly into a slow, wide smile. His eyes behind their glasses gleamed with a wistful light.  \"Gee!\" he murmured.  John looked at him, amazed.  \"Crump,\" he cried. \"Crump, I believe you're a sport!\"  Mr. Crump seemed completely to have forgotten his responsible position as secretary to a millionaire and special messenger to a prince. He smirked.  \"I'd have liked a day or two in the old burg,\" he said softly. \"I haven't been to Rector's since Ponto was a pup.\"  John reached across the table and seized the secretary's hand.  \"Crump,\" he said, \"you _are_ a sport. This is no time for delay. If we are to liven up this great city, we must get busy right away. Grab your hat, and come along. One doesn't become a prince every day. The occasion wants celebrating. Are you with me, Crump, old scout?\"  \"Sure thing,\" said the envoy ecstatically.         *       "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],["title","The Prince and Betty (#5)"],["body","*       *       *       *  At eight o'clock on the following morning, two young men, hatless and a little rumpled, but obviously cheerful, entered the Astor Hotel, demanding breakfast.  A bell boy who met them was addressed by the larger of the two, and asked his name.  \"Desmond Ryan,\" he replied.  The young man patted him on his shoulder.  \"I appoint you, Desmond Ryan,\" he said, \"Grand Hereditary Bell Hop to the Court of Mervo.\"  Thus did Prince John formally enter into his kingdom.     CHAPTER V  MR. SCOBELL HAS ANOTHER IDEA   Owing to collaboration between Fate and Mr. Scobell, John's state entry into Mervo was an interesting blend between a pageant and a vaudeville sketch. The pageant idea was Mr. Scobell's. Fate supplied the vaudeville.  The reception at the quay, when the little steamer that plied between Marseilles and the island principality gave up its precious freight, was not on quite so impressive a scale as might have been given to the monarch of a more powerful kingdom; but John was not disappointed. During the voyage from New York, in the intervals of seasickness--for he was a poor sailor--Mr. Crump had supplied him with certain facts about Mervo, one of which was that its adult population numbered just under thirteen thousand, and this had prepared him for any shortcomings in the way of popular demonstration.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Scobell was exceedingly pleased with the scale of the reception, which to his mind amounted practically to pomp. The Palace Guard, forty strong, lined the quay. Besides these, there were four officers, a band, and sixteen mounted carbineers. The rest of the army was dotted along the streets. In addition to the military, there was a gathering of a hundred and fifty civilians, mainly drawn from fishing circles. The majority of these remained stolidly silent throughout, but three, more emotional, cheered vigorously as a young man was seen to step on to the gangway, carrying a grip, and make for the shore. General Poineau, a white-haired warrior with a fierce mustache, strode forward and saluted. The Palace Guards presented arms. The band struck up the Mervian national anthem. General Poineau, lowering his hand, put on a pair of _pince-nez_ and began to unroll an address of welcome.  It was then seen that the young man was Mr. Crump. General Poineau removed his glasses and gave an impatient twirl to his mustache. Mr. Scobell, who for possibly the first time in his career was not smoking (though, as was afterward made manifest, he had the materials on his person), bustled to the front.  \"Where's his nibs, Crump?\" he enquired.  The secretary's reply was swept away in a flood of melody. To the band Mr. Crump's face was strange. They had no reason to suppose that he was not Prince John, and they acted accordingly. With a rattle of drums they burst once more into their spirited rendering of the national anthem.  Mr. Scobell sawed the air with his arms, but was powerless to dam the flood.  \"His Highness is shaving, sir!\" bawled Mr. Crump, depositing his grip on the quay and making a trumpet of his hands.  \"Shaving!\"  \"Yes, sir. I told him he ought to come along, but His Highness said he wasn't going to land looking like a tramp comedian.\"  By this time General Poineau had explained matters to the band and they checked the national anthem abruptly in the middle of a bar, with the exception of the cornet player, who continued gallantly by himself till a feeling of loneliness brought the truth home to him. An awkward stage wait followed, which lasted until John was seen crossing the deck, when there were more cheers, and General Poineau, resuming his _pince-nez_, brought out the address of welcome again.  At this point Mr. Scobell made his presence felt.  \"Glad to meet you, Prince,\" he said, coming forward. \"Scobell's my name. Shake hands with General Poineau. No, that's wrong. I guess he kisses your hand, don't he?\"  \"I'll swing on him if he does,\" said John, cheerfully.  Mr. Scobell eyed him doubtfully. His Highness did not appear to him to be treating the inaugural ceremony with that reserved dignity which we like to see in princes on these occasions. Mr. Scobell was a business man. He wanted his money's worth. His idea of a Prince of Mervo was something statuesquely aloof, something--he could not express it exactly--on the lines of the illustrations in the Zenda stories in the magazines--about eight feet high and shinily magnificent, something that would give the place a tone. That was what he had had in his mind when he sent for John. He did not want a cheerful young man in a soft hat and a flannel suit who looked as if at any moment he might burst into a college yell.  General Poineau, meanwhile, had embarked on the address of welcome. John regarded him thoughtfully.  \"I can see,\" he said to Mr. Scobell, \"that the gentleman is making a good speech, but what is he saying? That is what gets past me.\"  \"He is welcoming Your Highness,\" said Mr. Crump, the linguist, \"in the name of the people of Mervo.\"  \"Who, I notice, have had the bully good sense to stay in bed. I guess they knew that the Boy Orator would do all that was necessary. He hasn't said anything about a bite of breakfast, has he? Has his address happened to work around to the subject of shredded wheat and shirred eggs yet? That's the part that's going to make a hit with me.\"  \"There'll be breakfast at my villa, Your Highness,\" said Mr. Scobell. \"My automobile is waiting along there.\"  The General reached his peroration, worked his way through it, and finished with a military clash of heels and a salute. The band rattled off the national anthem once more.  \"Now, what?\" said John, turning to Mr. Scobell. \"Breakfast?\"  \"I guess you'd better say a few words to them, Your Highness; they'll expect it.\"  \"But I can't speak the language, and they can't understand English. The thing'll be a stand-off.\"  \"Crump will hand it to 'em. Here, Crump.\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Line up and shoot His Highness's remarks into 'em.\"  \"Yes, sir.  \"It's all very well for you, Crump,\" said John. \"You probably enjoy this sort of thing. I don't. I haven't felt such a fool since I sang 'The Maiden's Prayer' on Tremont Street when I was joining the frat. Are you ready? No, it's no good. I don't know what to say.\"  \"Tell 'em you're tickled to death,\" advised Mr. Scobell anxiously.  John smiled in a friendly manner at the populace. Then he coughed. \"Gentlemen,\" he said--\"and more particularly the sport on my left who has just spoken his piece whose name I can't remember--I thank you for the warm welcome you have given me. If it is any satisfaction to you to know that it has made me feel like thirty cents, you may have that satisfaction. Thirty is a liberal estimate.\"  \"'His Highness is overwhelmed by your loyal welcome. He thanks you warmly,'\" translated Mr. Crump, tactfully.  \"I feel that we shall get along nicely together,\" continued John. \"If you are chumps enough to turn out of your comfortable beds at this time of the morning simply to see me, you can't be very hard to please. We shall hit it off fine.\"  _Mr. Crump:_ \"His Highness hopes and believes that he will always continue to command the affection of his people.\"  \"I--\" John paused. \"That's the lot,\" he said. \"The flow of inspiration has ceased. The magic fire has gone out. Break it to 'em, Crump. For me, breakfast.\"  During the early portion of the ride Mr. Scobell was silent and thoughtful. John's speech had impressed him neither as oratory nor as an index to his frame of mind. He had not interrupted him, because he knew that none of those present could understand what was being said, and that Mr. Crump was to be relied on as an editor. But he had not enjoyed it. He did not take the people of Mervo seriously himself, but in the Prince such an attitude struck him as unbecoming. Then he cheered up. After all, John had given evidence of having a certain amount of what he would have called \"get-up\" in him. For the purposes for which he needed him, a tendency to make light of things was not amiss. It was essentially as a performing prince that he had engaged John. He wanted him to do unusual things, which would make people talk--aeroplaning was one that occurred to him. Perhaps a prince who took a serious view of his position would try to raise the people's minds and start reforms and generally be a nuisance. John could, at any rate, be relied upon not to do that.  His face cleared.  \"Have a good cigar, Prince?\" he said, cordially, inserting two fingers in his vest-pocket.  \"Sure, Mike,\" said His Highness affably.  Breakfast over, Mr. Scobell replaced the remains of his cigar between his lips, and turned to business.  \"Eh, Prince?\" he said.  \"Yes!\"  \"I want you, Prince,\" said Mr. Scobell, \"to help boom this place. That's where you come in.\"  \"Sure,\" said John.  \"As to ruling and all that,\" continued Mr. Scobell, \"there isn't any to do. The place runs itself. Some guy gave it a shove a thousand years ago, and it's been rolling along ever since. What I want you to do is the picturesque stunts. Get a yacht and catch rare fishes. Whoop it up. Entertain swell guys when they come here. Have a Court--see what I mean?--same as over in England. Go around in aeroplanes and that style of thing. Don't worry about money. That'll be all right. You draw your steady hundred thousand a year and a good chunk more besides, when we begin to get a move on, so the dough proposition doesn't need to scare you any.\"  \"Do I, by George!\" said John. \"It seems to me that I've fallen into a pretty soft thing here. There'll be a joker in the deck somewhere, I guess. There always is in these good things. But I don't see it yet. You can count me in all right.\"  \"Good boy,\" said Mr. Scobell. \"And now you'll be wanting to get to the Palace. I'll have them bring the automobile round.\"  The council of state broke up.  Having seen John off in the car, the financier proceeded to his sister's sitting-room. Miss Scobell had breakfasted"]]]
