B. SHAW    FIRST PREFACE  For many years in our work among children, we have felt the need of something similar to this book.  The cuts are made especially for this work. Pictures in this book will suggest thoughts of God and heaven and awaken desires to live pure lives which will sooner or later result in the salvation of many of our young readers. God bless all our readers.  --S. B. Shaw  We are sure these stories will interest you children (and most older people, too). Especially good and true stories like these. In all that we have selected there are precious lessons of kindness and sympathy and obedience, gratitude, courage, and faithfulness: then there are two other very important lessons which I wish you to learn. The first is that children can be and should be true Christians, that is, have their sins forgiven for Jesus' sake and their hearts changed so that they love God and the right and hate everything that is wrong. The second lesson is that we must be Christians to be ready to live or ready to die. You will find in this book several accounts of happy deaths of Christian children, and you will find also much that tells of the good done by happy Christian children that lived.  --Mrs. S. B. Shaw.    DEDICATION  When I was a little girl about nine years old, my mother gave me the book, \"Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers To Prayer,\" for children. This book was published by Brother and Sister Shaw.  I still have that book, which is about fifty-nine years old, and I have enjoyed the stories it contained many times. One time while teaching a Sunday School class I gave them each one of these books. They liked them very much, but there came a time when you could not buy these books, as other modern books took their place. But I feel that books like this one are still needed, and I am sure that if Brother and Sister Shaw were living they would like to see the stories sent out again to the children. We are adding a few more true stories.  So we are praying God's blessings upon this book and dedicating it to the memory of Brother and Sister Shaw who printed the first book in 1895.  Yours in Him,  Laura M. Conkle  (This dedication was written in 1955 for the first reprint edition.)

The heathen go astray, speaking lies as soon as they are born. In China a mother will give her boy a reward for the best falsehood that he can tell. Beginning so early, and regarding it such a fine thing to tell wrong stories, they become skillful in falsehoods. Some parents in Christian America are very careless in this matter. It made my heart ache one day when I saw a lady in a street car trying to keep her little boy awake by telling him that, if he went to sleep, that man who had all those teeth in his window (referring to a dentist's office they had passed) would come into the car and pull every tooth out of his mouth. The little fellow looked up dreadfully scared, and did his best to keep awake: but I thought to myself, when he finds out what a wrong story his mother has told, he will not believe her even when she tells the truth. He will be like a little fellow of whom I heard once, whose mother told him that if he vent to play in a bank from which the men had been drawing sand for a building, a bear would come out and eat him up. One day another boy tried to coax him to go there and play, but he said, no, he was afraid of the bears. The other boy said there were no bears. \"But there be bears cause my mother said there be bears.\" While they were disputing, the minister happened to come along, and they asked him if there were bears in the sand-bank. He told them there were none. \"But,\" said the first little boy, \"My mother said there be bears there.\" \"I am sorry she said so,\" said the minister, \"but the truth is, there are none.\" The child began to cry, and started for home as fast as he could go. \"O Mama!\" he said, \"Did you tell me a wrong story? Did you tell me there be bears down at the sand-bank when there aren't any?\" She saw what a dreadful sin she had committed, and she told him that she was sorry; but she was afraid that if he played there he would get buried in the sand, and she told him that to keep him away. \"But, Mama, it is such an awful thing to tell a wrong story.\" \"I know it Tommy, I know it,\" she said, tears coming into her eyes; \"and we will ask Jesus to forgive me and I will never do it again.\" They knelt down, and she was just about to pray when he said, \"Wait, Mama, let me ask Him; maybe you won't tell Him truly.\" That pierced her heart like a dagger. She saw that her little boy had lost confidence in her truthfulness even when she prayed.  --Jennie F. Willing    THE CHILD HEROINE OF NEW BRUNSWICK  We have read a touching incident about three little children, who, last autumn late in the season, wandered alone in a dreary region of New Brunswick. The sun had already sunk in the west and the gloom of evening was spreading itself over the surrounding country.  The night came on fast; and feeling sure that they could not get home before day break, the eldest (a girl of only six years) quietly placed the two little ones in a sheltered nook on the sea-beach; and fearing the cold chilly night for the younger children, Mary stripped off most of her own clothes to keep them warm.  She then started off to gather dry sea-weed, and whatever else she could find, to cover them with. Having tenderly in this way wrought for some time to make them a nest, she at last fell down exhausted with the cold, and half bare to the cold inclement night.  [Illustration]  That evening the loving father and tender mother sat up wondering at their children's long absence; the hours dragged slowly past with anxious watching and silent listening for the well-known little pattering feet. In vain the fond parents' eyes pierced through the darkness. At length they roused the neighbors with their anxious inquiries after their lost ones. All that night was passed in searching and in tears, till early in the morning, lying fast asleep and somewhat numbed with cold, were found little Johnny and Lizzie. But oh! a touching spectacle lay near them; their young savior was stiff, cold, and dead on the sea-weed which the poor little child-heroine had not strength to drag into the nook, where those she so deeply loved, and died to save, were sleeping. Thus this little New Brunswick girl died in her successful and self-sacrificing endeavor to save her brother and sister.  Does not this recall the love of the Lord Jesus Christ to you who read? Mary went to the full extent of human love in dying for her little brother and sister. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" Yet the Lord Jesus laid down his life for his enemies; for \"scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die; but God commendeth His love toward us,\" etc. He makes no mistakes. Yet how many listen to this story with more emotion and interest than they do to the story of the cross, where the love of Jesus, the Son of God, is told in letters of blood!  --_Dawn of the Morning_    ANNIE AND VANIE'S FIRST REAL PRAYER  Two sisters, one about five years of age, the other one older, were accustomed to go each Saturday morning, some distance from home, to get chips and shavings from a cooper shop.  One morning with basket well filled, they were returning home when the elder one was taken suddenly sick with cramps or cholera. She was in great pain, and unable to proceed, much less to bear the basket home. She sat down on the basket, and the younger one held her from falling.  The street was a lonely one occupied by workshops, factories, etc. Every one was busy within; not a person was seen on the street.  The little girls were at a loss what to do. Too timid to go into any workshop, they sat a while, as silent and quiet as the distressing pains would allow.  Soon the elder girl said: \"You know, Annie, that a good while ago Mother told us that if we ever got into trouble we should pray and, God would help us. Now you help me to get down upon my knees, and hold me up, and we will pray.\"  [Illustration]  There on the side-walk did these two little children ask God to send some one to help them home.  The simple and brief prayer being ended, the sick girl was again helped up, and sat on the basket, waiting for the answers to their prayers.  Presently Annie saw, far down the street on the opposite side, a man come out from a factory, look around him up and down the street and go back into the factory.  \"O sister, he has gone in again,\" said Annie. \"Well,\" said Vanie, \"perh"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7026"],["title","Children's Edition of Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers to Prayer (#1)"],["body","he is not the one God is going to send. If he is he will come back again.\"  \"There he comes again,\" said Annie. \"He walks this way. He seems looking for something. He walks slow, and is without his hat. He puts his hand to his head, as if he did not know what to do. Oh, sister, he has gone in again; what shall we do?\"  \"That may not be the one whom God will send to help us,\" said Vanie. \"If he is, he will come out again.\"  \"Oh yes, there he is; this time with his hat on,\" said Annie. \"He comes this way; he walks slowly, looking around on every side. He does not see us, perhaps the trees hide us. Now he sees us, and is coming quickly.\"  A brawny German in broken accent asks:  \"O children, what is the matter?\"  \"O sir,\" said Annie, Sister here is so sick she cannot walk and we cannot get home.\"  \"Where do you live my dear?\"  \"At the end of this street; you can see the house from here.\"  \"Never mind,\" said the man, \"I takes you home.\"  So the strong man gathered the sick child in his arms, and with her head pillowed upon his shoulder, carried her to the place pointed out by the younger girl. Annie ran around the house to tell her mother that there was a man at the front door wishing to see her. The astonished mother, with a mixture of surprise and joy, took charge of the precious burden and the child was laid upon a bed.  After thanking the man, she expected him to withdraw, but instead, he stood turning his hat in his hands as one who wishes to say something, but knows not how to begin.  The mother observing this, repeated her thanks and finally said: \"Would you like me to pay you for bringing my child home?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said he with tears, \"God pays me! God pays me! I would like to tell you something, but I speak English so poorly that I fear you will not understand.\"  The mother assured him that she was used to the German and could understand him very well.  \"I am the proprietor of an ink factory,\" said he. \"My men work by the piece. I have to keep separate accounts with each. I pay them every Saturday. At twelve o'clock they will be at my desk for their money. This week I have had many hindrances and was behind with my books. I was working hard at them with the sweat on my face, in my great anxiety to be ready in time. Suddenly I could not see the figures; the words in the book all ran together, and I had a plain impression on my mind that some one in the street wished to see me. I went out, looked up and down the street, but seeing no one, went back to my desk and wrote a little. Presently the darkness was greater than before, and the impression stronger than before, that someone in the street needed me.  \"Again I went out, looked up and down the street, walked a little way, puzzled to know what I meant. Was my hard work and were the cares of business driving me out of my wits? Unable to solve the mystery I turned again into my shop and to my desk.  \"This time my fingers refused to grasp the pen. I found myself unable to write a word, or make a figure; but the impression was stronger than ever on my mind, that someone needed my help. A voice seemed to say: 'Why don't you go out as I tell you? There is need of your help.' This time I took my hat on going out, resolved to stay till I found out whether I was losing my senses, or there was a duty for me to do. I walked some distance without seeing anyone, and was more and more puzzled, till I came opposite the children, and found that there was indeed need of my help. I cannot understand it, madam.\"  As the noble German was about leaving the house, the younger girl had the courage to say: \"O mother, we prayed.\"  Thus the mystery was solved, and with tear-stained cheeks, a heaving breast, and a humble, grateful heart, the kind man went back to his accounts.  I have enjoyed many a happy hour in conversation with Annie in her own house since she has a home of her own. The last I knew of Annie and Vanie they were living in the same city, earnest Christian women. Their children were growing up around them, who, I hope, will have like confidence in mother, and faith in God.  --Jeigh Arrh.  Annie was the wife of James A. Clayton of San Jose, California. I have enjoyed their hospitality and esteem both very highly.  --James Rogers.    GOD HEALS A BLIND GIRL  One day we went to visit Ruth's aunt. While there, a very dear friend of Ruth's aunt came to visit her, bringing Annie, her little four-year-old girl who was the same age as Ruth. They had taken Annie to an eye doctor the day before and he had said that she was blind and would always be blind. The two children played together. Ruth would lead her by the hand and this touched her heart very much.  After we went home, she came to me crying, and said, \"Mama, Annie is blind. Mama, Annie can't see anything. Mama, Annie can't even see her mama!\"  I (Ruth's mother) answered, \"No, Annie can't see anything.\"  \"Can't Jesus make Annie see her mama?\" Ruth asked.  \"Yes, Jesus can do anything,\" Mother told her.  \"I'll never quit praying till Jesus makes Annie see her Mama,\" she said. She knelt down and prayed, and for several days she would come in from her play ever so often and kneel down and pray and ask Jesus to make Annie see her mama.  In a few days we received word that Annie said \"Oh, I see my mama!\" From then on she could see.  When the girls were eight years old and Ruth had moved from that state, her aunt (who had also moved) received a letter from Annie's mother, saying, \"Annie seems to be losing her eyesight again.\" She said also that she would like for her to send Annie a new dress while she could still see it, and if she knew where Ruth was to ask her to pray for Annie that Jesus would not let her go blind again. Ruth was at the home of her aunt when she received this letter. She prayed earnestly again and God answered her prayer and gave Annie her eyesight. It was even better than normal.  The last time I saw Annie she was a grown woman around forty, and she showed me how she could see to read a long way from the light, which we could not do. Surely God did a wonderful work in answer to a little girl's prayer.  Children, let's pray; and when we pray, believe that God hears, and receive the good things that he has to give us and others.  --Essie Wilson.    \"DOES THIS RAILROAD LEAD TO HEAVEN?\"  In traveling we often meet with persons of different nationalities and languages; we also meet with incidents of various character, some sorrowful, others, joyful and instructive. One of the latter character I witnessed recently while traveling upon the cars. The train was going west and the time was evening. At a station a little girl about eight years old came aboard, carrying a budget under her arm. She then commenced an eager scrutiny of faces, but all were strange to her. She appeared weary, and placing her budget for a pillow, she prepared to try and secure a little sleep. Soon the conductor came along collecting tickets and fare. Observing him she asked him if she might lie there. The gentlemanly conductor replied that she might, and then kindly asked for her ticket. She informed him that she had none, when the following conversation ensued. Said the conductor:  \"Where are you going?\"  \"I am going to heaven,\" she answered.  \"Who pays your fare?\" he asked again.  She then said, \"Mister, does this railroad lead to heaven, and does Jesus travel on it?\"  \"I think not,\" he answered, \"Why did you think so?\"  [Illustration]  \"Why sir, before my ma died she used to sing to me of a heavenly railroad, and you looked so nice and kind that I thought this was the road. My ma used to sing of Jesus on the heavenly railroad, and that He paid the fare for everybody, and that the train stopped at every station to take people on board; but my ma don't sing to me any more. Nobody sings to me now; and I thought I'd take the cars and go to ma. Mister, do you sing to your little girl about the railroad that goes to heaven? You have a little girl, haven't you?\"  He replied, weeping, \"No my little dear I have no little girl now. I had one once; but she died some time ago, and went to heaven.\"  \"Did she go over this railroad, and are you going to see her now?\" she asked.  By this time every person in the coach was upon their feet, and most of them were weeping. An attempt to describe what I witnessed is almost futile. Some said: \"God bless the little girl.\" Hearing some person say that she was an angel, the little girl earnestly replied: \"Yes, my ma used to say that I would be an angel some time.\"  Addressing herself once more to the conductor, she asked him, \"Do you love Jesus? I do, and if you love Him, He will let you ride to heaven on His railroad. I am going there and I wish you would go with me. I know Jesus will let me into heaven when I get there and He will let you in, too, and everybody that will ride on His railroad--yes, all these people. Wouldn't you like to see heaven and Jesus, and your little girl?\"  These words, so pathetically and innocently uttered, brought a great gush of tears from all eyes, but most profusely from those of the conductor. Some who were traveling on the heavenly railroad shouted aloud for joy.  She asked the conductor: \"Mister, may I lie here until we get to heaven?\"  \"Yes, dear, yes,\" he answered.  \"Will you wake me up then so that I may see my ma and your little girl and Jesus?\" she asked, \"for I do so much want to see them all.\"  The answer came in broken accents but in words very tenderly spoken \"Yes, dear angel, yes. God bless you.\" \"Amen!\" was sobbed by more than a score of voices.  Turning her eyes again upon the conductor, she interrogated him again, \"What shall I tell your little girl when I see her? Shall I tell her that I saw her pa on Jesus' railroad? Shall I?\"  This brought a fresh flood of tears from all present, and the conductor knelt by her side, and, embracing her wept the reply he could not utter. At this juncture the brakeman called out: \"H----.\" The conductor arose and requested him "]]]
