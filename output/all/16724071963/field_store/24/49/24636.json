Dances of Early California Times     Preface   In presenting this modest volume to the public, I wish to call the attention of my readers to the following facts. Firstly, my humble work is a work of love--love simple and unalloyed for the venerable Spanish Missionaries of California and for the noble sons and daughters of Spain who gave such a glorious beginning and impetus to our state. Being a direct descendant of pioneer Spaniards of Monterey, I take a particular interest in California's early history and development and as my family were staunch friends of the Missionary Fathers and in a position to know the state of affairs of those times, and to family tradition I have added authentic knowledge from reading the earliest archives of San Carlos Mission, as well as other historical references, I feel I can fearlessly vouch for the truthfulness of my little work. Secondly--while fully appreciating the sympathy and interest of many charming and intellectual characters who grace California to-day, it must be admitted that there is a sadly ignorant or misinformed number who scarcely seem to know who Spaniards and their descendants are, judging from the promiscuous way the term \"Spanish\" is used, and what is the result of this among many? Prejudice, and absurd misunderstanding of the golden days of Spanish California as well as of the Spanish race and character. It is far from being my wish to offend, but I wish to present correct historical facts. Thirdly--there is no pretense to consider this brief sketch a complete or detailed history, but only a truthful outline of the heroic and chivalrous Mission days.  Maria Antonia Field.

Read at the Crowning of the Serra Statue, Monterey, Nov. 23, 1913.         The fickle world ofttimes applauds the rise      Of men whose laurels are but vainly won,      Whose deeds their names could not immortalize      For their soul-toils were wrought for transient ends;      But heroes of the Cross, they truly great      Shall live, their halo shall no hand of fate       Have power to rob, albeit oblivious years      May veil the radiance of their glorious works,      Or slight their excellence, their light appears      But brighter, statelier in its splendor calm,      Or like the flowers that sleep through winter's snow      To bloom more fair, their lives' pure beams shall glow       With greater brilliance and sweetly gleam      As lodestars in the firmament of worth;      Such is the memory whose holy stream      Of noblest virtue, valor, truth and Faith,      Illumes our path and stirs our souls today,      Immortal Serra by whose tomb we pray!       What peerless aureole wreathes his saintly brow?      What stately monument doth bear his name?      Let this admiring thousands tell us now!      Let youthful lips pronounce his name with love!      Let California proudly sing his praise!      Let scions of fair Spain their voices raise,       And tell of him to whom so much we owe,      Tell of his interceding power with God,      His strong and lofty soul his children know,      His prayers where Carmel's River flows so clear;      O this his aureole, this his monument,      The lasting kind which ne'er will know descent.       Another lesson must the worldly learn,      From him who sought nor praise nor fame;      His birth, ten score agone, and still we turn      To him in reverence, his name is sweet      As vernal bloom, his life shows forth God's might,      Through him this soil received Faith's warm sunlight!       This beauteous land was strange, unknown and wild,      Spite all its treasures, lordly trees and flowers;      For tribes with pagan rites its wastes defiled,      Till came Spain's noble band of godly men,      Explorers true and zealous priests who gave      Their lives' best years, forgotten souls to save!       'Tis just we venerate each hallowed stone      Which rears the wond'rous \"Temples of the West\";      The tears, the toils, the nightly vigils lone;      The pilgrim-journeys of Saint Francis' sons,      The rescued souls by lustral waters cleansed,      The wealth of hospitality dispensed.       All this and more if but their walls could speak,      Would tell this day; and we in whose veins flows      The fervent blood of Spain, to us each streak      Of light which doth reveal a picture true      Of gentle friar and lovely vanished times      Is tender as the Angelus' sweet chimes.       Well may each Mission have a holy spell,      And Serra's name become a household word,      What marvels can each yellowed archive tell      Of him and of his martyr-spirit band.      O faithful, dauntless hearts! What brilliant sons      Of that great galaxy of Spain's brave sons!       We love their saintly lives to ponder o'er,      While childhood's fireside tales come back to us,      And memory unfolds her precious store,      The bygone glories of the Mission towns,      The grand old hymns sung at sweet Mary's shrines      The Spanish color rich as luscious wines       Of Mission vineyards, and the festive hours      So full of life yet innocent and good,      When blessings seemed to fall as welcome showers,      The Indian tribes were ruled with Christian love,      And shared the sons and daughters of Castile      Their loved Franciscan Fathers' patient zeal!       But still we love each altar and each cross      Of these dear fanes; e'en as departing rays      Of sun doth kiss the crags outlined with moss,      We love to linger by their altars' light.      But oh fair Carmel, she of Missions Queen      What guarding spirits hover here unseen!       Sweet Carmel, center of the hero-band,      What holy treasures hold thy sacred vaults?      Junipero and others! Here we stand      In awe of all thou hast been and art still!      Cruel times took glory, splendor, power      From Missions all, but not their priceless dower,       Religion, love and all we hold as dear,      No hand can tarnish and no might destroy,      And from each hallowed altar ruddy, clear,      Still burns the mystic lamp, for God is there!      The cross-crowned towers tell that all is not dead,      E'en though more splendid times have long since sped.

O Saintly Serra we implore thy prayer,      Thy dauntless spirit sowed the \"mustard-seed\"      Which grew as if by miracle of wonder rare,      Upon this now rich land which thou did'st till,      O let they mantle on thy clients fall      Who on thy gracious aid do humbly call.    Chapter I.        Junipero Serra, Leader of the Heroic Band of Spanish      Missionaries of California. His Coming to San Fernando,      Mexico, Thence to California.    Junipero Serra, whose name and labors may be termed a compendium of Christian virtues, was born on November 24, 1713, in Petra, a village of the picturesque Island of Majorca, on the northeastern coast of Spain, and a part of the Province of fair Catalonia, one of the most valuable and beautiful portions of Spain. This child, around whom our story clusters was baptized on the day following his birth, and received the names of Miguel José. His parents were poor people from a material standpoint, but gifted with a rich heritage of the noblest, and sublimest character; qualities which make the Spanish peasant so delightful.  From his tenderest youth, Miguel José evinced an ardent desire to enter the priesthood and displayed a zealous missionary spirit. His pious parents placed no obstacle in the way of their gentle boy's vocation, and being too poor to pay for his education, the Church did it for them. At the age of sixteen, Miguel José left his father's small estate and began his studies in his native village, completing them at the Franciscan College of Palma, the Capital of the Island of Majorca. He made rapid progress, and a brilliant future opened before him, while his virtuous qualities were noted by all with whom he came in contact. A proof of his worth may be seen from the facts that he was ordained before he attained his majority; also taught in different schools as professor of theology and received the degree of doctor soon after his ordination. The fame of his eloquent preaching and persuasive oratorical powers spread not only throughout Spain but reached other European countries. Still Junipero Serra (as he was known by his own choice after an humble disciple of Saint Francis of Assisi, noted for his charity) was not dazzled by his brilliant mental gifts, and his thirsting desire to evangelize the heathen savage of the New World grew apace with his fame. He declined the offer to become the Court preacher and other ecclesiastical dignities, which he would have been entirely justified in accepting, and practiced those virtues which clung to him with even more perfect maturity throughout his life; heroic virtues which enabled him to undertake wonderful things. In him too were noted those sweet simple qualities invariably found in great and holy men and women, such as gentleness, amiability, a tender affection for children and a love for the beautiful in nature; sun, moon, stars, flowers, birds, the woods and ocean, all found responsive chords within him. In a few brief lines we have endeavored to convey an idea of Serra's character, let us now follow his steps in company with the band of heroic workers who accompanied him in his voyage across the dark Atlantic, and his apostolic journeys through Mexico and California to \"break the bread of life\" to the unfortunate heathen. Among the notable band of missionaries was Father Francisco Paloú, life-long friend and co-laborer of Father Junipero Serra.  But why did these heroes choose Mexico and California as the vineyards of their labors? Why did they not go to Africa or other heathen shores? Here is the answer: Spain and all Europe were filled with stories of the New World since the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492, and several other Spanish discoveries in later years, among which must be remembered that in 1521, Hernando Cortes, one of the great Spanish explorers of the sixteenth century, explored the hitherto unknown land of Mexico, and as Spain always accompanied her conquests and explorations with her missionaries to evangelize the heathens, at the time that Father Junipero Serra set sail for the New World, which was in 1759, there were in Mexico an archbishopric and several missions conducted by Spanish priests, among them a well established Franciscan College in San Fernando, a settlement in the northern part of Mexico, which the Spanish explorers and missionaries so decided to name after Saint Ferdinand, a King of Spain, who lived in the thirteenth century. And to this College, Father Junipero Serra and his companions came after a perilous voyage of nearly one year; for the date of their arrival was January 1, 1760; and here they began their labor! Of the nine years which Junipero Serra toiled in Mexico, six were spent in Sierra Gorda, some distance north of San Fernando, and one of the wildest and roughest of those half explored regions. And what marvels attended the labors of Serra and the other self-sacrificing sons of Saint Francis here! With Junipero Serra at the helm, the good priests learned some of the Aztec dialects in order to convert the savages. Then what followed? With the greatest patience the missionaries acquitted themselves to the task of teaching the classic, cultured language of Spain to these poor aborigines, whose languages like those of the still cruder California Indians, did not contain expressions for even the simplest words of scripture or of the liturgy of the Church. And can we wonder at this? But what were the astonishing results of the good priests' labors? They were truly God-wonders! Daily were recorded numerous conversions, and at the close of six years many Indian congregations of those regions could be heard singing the ancient Latin hymns of the Church, and in poor but intelligible Spanish supplying in their prayers and conversations what was wanting in their dialects. It was while at Sierra Gorda that Junipero Serra became afflicted with a painful sore which broke out on his right leg and which never healed in all his eventful and laborious career. Many historians allude to this sore as a \"wound,\" but no record is extant to indicate it as such, the most authentic conclusions being that this sore was due to natural causes greatly augmented and brought on by the hardships and climatic conditions he encountered in this missionary field.  The average person would think Junipero Serra and his companions had surely satiated their thirst for missionary labors during the nine long toilsome years they spent in Mexico, far, far away from loving home, affectionate kindred and the Old World culture to which they bade farewell when the last glistening silhouette of the Spanish Coast vanished from their view in 1759, but not so! Their pilgrimage was but begun! The pilgrimage which was to blossom heavenly and earthly blessings as beautiful and countless as the flowers which jeweled the slopes and valleys they traversed. The monstrous undertaking begun so gloriously, blessed with the benison of prayers, sacrifices, tears; blessed later with superhuman success and crowned with an immortal halo for endless days!  Here we will make a slight digression for the sake of our story. In 1548, just twenty-seven years after Cortes discovered the land of Mexico, Cabrillo's expedition had sailed up the Coast of California, and in 1602 Sebastian Vizcaino had made further discoveries accompanied by two Carmelite priests, and landed on the shores of Monterey. Both of these expeditions, however, were abandoned and California remained the \"mysterious vineyard,\" as it was called. But Vizcaino drew a map of California placing upon it the harbor of Monterey, and wrote glowing accounts of the beauty of the spot. On Point Lobos he planted a Cross, and the Carmelite Fathers named that beautiful Valley, four miles from Monterey, Carmelo, in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary, venerated under the title of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Of these facts we will have occasion to speak of more fully later on in this work.  Years after these expeditions the good Jesuit Fathers established several missions in Lower California, but were recalled to Spain by King Carlos III and by this sovereign's request the Franciscan Fathers of the College of San Fernando were commissioned to take the newly vacated missions and accompany as missionaries the great and glorious enterprise of Don Gaspar de Portolá, with Vizcaino's map as guide, to further explore California and add it to the Crown of Castile and Leon.  The Father Guardian of the College of San Fernando, on receiving the letter from King Carlos, immediately appointed Junipero Serra, whose zeal and sanctity were so well known, as the Father President of the band of missionaries to set out for California. Among the missionaries who volunteered to evangelize California were Fathers Francisco Paloú, Francisco de Lasuén and Juan Crespí.  Here we will introduce a few characters, not of the missionary band, but who may well be termed faithful co-operators of their labors, men of unimpeachable honor, whose names add luster to the pages of Spanish annals. Don Jose Galvez, the Visitador General (general visitator) of the Spanish possessions in Mexico, a man as pious and noble as he was brilliant, managed the expedition of gallant Don Gaspar de Portolá and the missionaries, and gave Junipero Serra and the brave officers and soldiers much encouragement. This wonderfully managed and well equipped expedition, on which hinged the future of California, was wisely divided into two parts, one to go by sea, the other overland. The sea expedition consisted of three ships the San Carlos, the San José, and the San Antonio, the last named was a relief ship and was started after the other two. The San Carlos and San José carried a large portion of the troops, all of"]]]
