But these unpleasant duties came to an end at last, and signs of breakfast began to appear.  Breakfast gave Kennedy his first insight into life in camp. He happened to be tent-orderly that day, and it therefore fell to his lot to join the orderlies from the other tents in their search for the Eckleton rations. He returned with a cargo of bread (obtained from the quartermaster), and, later, with a great tin of meat, which the cook-house had supplied, and felt that this was life. Hitherto breakfast had been to him a thing of white cloths, tables, and food that appeared from nowhere. This was the first time he had ever tracked his food to its source, so to speak, and brought it back with him. After breakfast, when he was informed that, as tent-orderly for the day, it was his business to wash up, he began to feel as if he were on a desert island. He had never quite realised before what washing-up implied, and he was conscious of a feeling of respect for the servants at Blackburn's, who did it every day as a matter of course, without complaint. He had had no idea before this of the intense stickiness of a jammy plate.  One day at camp is much like another. The schools opened the day with parade drill at about eight o'clock, and, after an instruction series of \"changing direction half-left in column of double companies\", and other pleasant movements of a similar nature, adjourned for lunch. Lunch was much like breakfast, except that the supply of jam was cut off. The people who arrange these things--probably the War Office, or Mr Brodrick, or someone--have come to the conclusion that two pots of jam per tent are sufficient for breakfast and lunch. The unwary devour theirs recklessly at the earlier meal, and have to go jamless until tea at six o'clock, when another pot is served out.  The afternoon at camp is perfect or otherwise, according to whether there is a four o'clock field-day or not. If there is, there are more manoeuvrings until tea-time, and the time is spent profitably, but not so pleasantly as it might be. If there is no field-day, you can take your time about your bathe in Cove Reservoir. And a really satisfactory bathe on a hot day should last at least three hours. Kennedy and Jimmy Silver strolled off in the direction of the Reservoir as soon as they felt that they had got over the effects of the beef, potatoes, and ginger-beer which a generous commissariat had doled out to them for lunch. It was a glorious day, and bathing was the only thing to do for the next hour or so. Stump-cricket, that fascinating sport much indulged in in camp, would not be at its best until the sun had cooled off a little.  After a pleasant half hour in the mud and water of the Reservoir, they lay on the bank and watched the rest of the schools take their afternoon dip. Kennedy had laid in a supply of provisions from the stall which stood at the camp end of the water. Neither of them felt inclined to move.  \"This _is_ decent,\" said Kennedy, wriggling into a more comfortable position in the long grass. \"Hullo!\"  \"What's up?\" inquired Jimmy Silver, lazily.  He was almost asleep.  \"Look at those idiots. They're certain to get spotted.\"  Jimmy Silver tilted his hat off his face, and sat up.  \"What's the matter? Which idiot?\"  Kennedy pointed to a bush on their right. Walton and Perry were seated beside it. Both were smoking.  \"Oh, that's all right,\" said Silver. \"Masters never come to Cove Reservoir. It's a sort of unwritten law. They're rotters to smoke, all the same. Certain to get spotted some day.... Not worth it.... Spoils lungs.... Beastly bad ... training.\"  He dozed off. The sun was warm, and the grass very soft and comfortable. Kennedy turned his gaze to the Reservoir again. It was no business of his what Walton and Perry did.  Walton and Perry were discussing ways and means. The conversation changed as they saw Kennedy glance at them. They were the sort of persons who feel a vague sense of injury when anybody looks at them, perhaps because they feel that those whose attention is attracted to them must say something to their discredit when they begin to talk about them.  \"There's that beast Kennedy,\" said Walton. \"I can't stick that man. He's always hanging round the house. What he comes for, I can't make out.\"  \"Pal of Fenn's,\" suggested Perry.  \"He hangs on to Fenn. I bet Fenn bars him really.\"  Perry doubted this in his innermost thoughts, but it was not worth while to say so.  \"Those Blackburn chaps,\" continued Walton, reverting to another grievance, \"will stick on no end of side next term about that cup. They wouldn't have had a look in if Kay hadn't given Fenn that extra. Kay ought to be kicked. I'm hanged if I'm going to care what I do next term. Somebody ought to do something to take it out of Kay for getting his own house licked like that.\"  Walton spoke as if the line of conduct he had mapped out for himself would be a complete reversal of his customary mode of life. As a matter of fact, he had never been in the habit of caring very much what he did.  Walton's last remarks brought the conversation back to where it had been before the mention of Kennedy switched it off on to new lines. Perry had been complaining that he thought camp a fraud, that it was all drilling and getting up at unearthly hours. He reminded Walton that he had only come on the strength of the latter's statement that it would be a rag. Where did the rag come in? That was what Perry wanted to know.  \"When it's not a ghastly sweat,\" he concluded, \"it's slow. Like it is now. Can't we do something for a change?\"  \"As a matter of fact,\" said Walton, \"nearly all the best rags are played out. A chap at a crammer's told me last holidays that when he was at camp he and some other fellows loosed the ropes of the guard-tent. He said it was grand sport.\"  Perry sat up.  \"That's the thing,\" he said, excitedly. \"Let's do that. Why not?\"  \"It's beastly risky,\" objected Walton.  \"What's that matter? They can't do anything, even if they spot us.\"  \"That's all you know. We should get beans.\"  \"Still, it's worth risking. It would be the biggest rag going. Did the chap tell you how they did it?\"  \"Yes,\" said Walton, becoming animated as he recalled the stirring tale, \"they bagged the sentry. Chucked a cloth or something over his head, you know. Then they shoved him into the ditch, and one of them sat on him while the others loosed the ropes. It took the chaps inside no end of a time getting out.\"  \"That's the thing. We'll do it. We only need one other chap. Leveson would come if we asked him. Let's get back to the lines. It's almost tea-time. Tell him after tea.\"  Leveson proved agreeable. Indeed, he jumped at it. His life, his attitude suggested, had been a hollow mockery until he heard the plan, but now he could begin to enjoy himself once more.  The lights-out bugle sounded at ten o'clock; the last post at ten-thirty. At a quarter to twelve the three adventurers, who had been keeping themselves awake by the exercise of great pains, satisfied themselves that the other occupants of the tent were asleep, and stole out.  It was an excellent night for their purpose. There was no moon, and the stars were hidden by clouds.  They crept silently towards the guard-tent. A dim figure loomed out of the blackness. They noted with satisfaction, as it approached, that it was small. Sentries at the public-school camp vary in physique. They felt that it was lucky that the task of sentry-go had not fallen that night to some muscular forward from one of the school fifteens, or worse still, to a boxing expert who had figured in the Aldershot competition at Easter. The present sentry would be an easy victim.  They waited for him to arrive.  A moment later Private Jones, of St Asterisk's--for it was he--turning to resume his beat, found himself tackled from behind. Two moments later he was reclining in the ditch. He would have challenged his adversary, but, unfortunately, that individual happened to be seated on his face.  He struggled, but to no purpose.  He was still struggling when a muffled roar of indignation from the direction of the guard-tent broke the stillness of the summer night. The roar swelled into a crescendo. What seemed like echoes came from other quarters out of the darkness. The camp was waking.  The noise from the guard-tent waxed louder.  The unknown marauder rose from his seat on Private Jones, and vanished.  Private Jones also rose. He climbed out of the ditch, shook himself, looked round for his assailant, and, not finding him, hurried to the guard-tent to see what was happening.     VII  A CLUE   The guard-tent had disappeared.  Private Jones' bewildered eye, rolling in a fine frenzy from heaven to earth, and from earth to heaven, in search of the missing edifice, found it at last in a tangled heap upon the ground. It was too dark to see anything distinctly, but he perceived that the canvas was rising and falling spasmodically like a stage sea, and for a similar reason--because there were human beings imprisoned beneath it.  By this time the whole camp was up and doing. Figures in _deshabille_, dashing the last vestiges of sleep away with their knuckles, trooped on to the scene in twos and threes, full of inquiry and trenchant sarcasm.  \"What are you men playing at? What's all the row about? Can't you finish that game of footer some other time, when we aren't trying to get to sleep? What on earth's up?\"  Then the voice of one having authority.  \"What's the matter? What are you doing?\"  It was perfectly obvious what the guard was doing. It was trying to get out from underneath the fallen tent. Private Jones explained this with some warmth.  \"Somebody jumped at me and sat on my head in the ditch. I couldn't get up. And then some blackguard cut the ropes of the guard-tent. I couldn't see who it was. He cut off directly the tent went down.\"  Private Jones further expressed a wish that he could find the chap. When he did, there would, he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6877"],["title","The Head of Kay's (#7)"],["body","inted, be trouble in the old homestead.  The tent was beginning to disgorge its prisoners.  \"Guard, turn out!\" said a facetious voice from the darkness.  The camp was divided into two schools of thought. Those who were watching the guard struggle out thought the episode funny. The guard did not. It was pathetic to hear them on the subject of their mysterious assailants. Matters quieted down rapidly after the tent had been set up again. The spectators were driven back to their lines by their officers. The guard turned in again to try and restore their shattered nerves with sleep until their time for sentry-go came round. Private Jones picked up his rifle and resumed his beat. The affair was at an end as far as that night was concerned.  Next morning, as might be expected, nothing else was talked about. Conversation at breakfast was confined to the topic. No halfpenny paper, however many times its circulation might exceed that of any penny morning paper, ever propounded so fascinating and puzzling a breakfast-table problem. It was the utter impossibility of detecting the culprits that appealed to the schools. They had swooped down like hawks out of the night, and disappeared like eels into mud, leaving no traces.  Jimmy Silver, of course, had no doubts.  \"It was those Kay's men,\" he said. \"What does it matter about evidence? You've only got to look at 'em. That's all the evidence you want. The only thing that makes it at all puzzling is that they did nothing worse. You'd naturally expect them to slay the sentry, at any rate.\"  But the rest of the camp, lacking that intimate knowledge of the Kayite which he possessed, did not turn the eye of suspicion towards the Eckleton lines. The affair remained a mystery. Kennedy, who never gave up a problem when everybody else did, continued to revolve the mystery in his mind.  \"I shouldn't wonder,\" he said to Silver, two days later, \"if you were right.\"  Silver, who had not made any remark for the last five minutes, with the exception of abusive comments on the toughness of the meat which he was trying to carve with a blunt knife for the tent, asked for an explanation. \"I mean about that row the other night.\"  \"What row?\"  \"That guard-tent business.\"  \"Oh, that! I'd forgotten. Why don't you move with the times? You're always thinking of something that's been dead and buried for years.\"  \"You remember you said you thought it was those Kay's chaps who did it. I've been thinking it over, and I believe you're right. You see, it was probably somebody who'd been to camp before, or he wouldn't have known that dodge of loosing the ropes.\"  \"I don't see why. Seems to me it's the sort of idea that might have occurred to anybody. You don't want to study the thing particularly deeply to know that the best way of making a tent collapse is to loose the ropes. Of course it was Kay's lot who did it. But I don't see how you're going to have them simply because one or two of them have been here before.\"  \"No, I suppose not,\" said Kennedy.  After tea the other occupants of the tent went out of the lines to play stump-cricket. Silver was in the middle of a story in one of the magazines, so did not accompany them. Kennedy cried off on the plea of slackness.  \"I say,\" he said, when they were alone.  \"Hullo,\" said Silver, finishing his story, and putting down the magazine. \"What do you say to going after those chaps? I thought that story was going to be a long one that would take half an hour to get through. But it collapsed. Like that guard-tent.\"  \"About that tent business,\" said Kennedy. \"Of course that was all rot what I was saying just now. I suddenly remembered that I didn't particularly want anybody but you to hear what I was going to say, so I had to invent any rot that I could think of.\"  \"But now,\" said Jimmy Silver, sinking his voice to a melodramatic whisper, \"the villagers have left us to continue their revels on the green, our wicked uncle has gone to London, his sinister retainer, Jasper Murgleshaw, is washing his hands in the scullery sink, and--_we are alone!_\"  \"Don't be an ass,\" pleaded Kennedy.  \"Tell me your dreadful tale. Conceal nothing. Spare me not. In fact, say on.\"  \"I've had a talk with the chap who was sentry that night,\" began Kennedy.  \"Astounding revelations by our special correspondent,\" murmured Silver.  \"You might listen.\"  \"I _am_ listening. Why don't you begin? All this hesitation strikes me as suspicious. Get on with your shady story.\"  \"You remember the sentry was upset--\"  \"Very upset.\"  \"Somebody collared him from behind, and upset him into the ditch. They went in together, and the other man sat on his head.\"  \"A touching picture. Proceed, friend.\"  \"They rolled about a bit, and this sentry chap swears he scratched the man. It was just after that that the man sat on his head. Jones says he was a big chap, strong and heavy.\"  \"He was in a position to judge, anyhow.\"  \"Of course, he didn't mean to scratch him. He was rather keen on having that understood. But his fingers came up against the fellow's cheek as he was falling. So you see we've only got to look for a man with a scratch on his cheek. It was the right cheek, Jones was almost certain. I don't see what you're laughing at.\"  \"I wish you wouldn't spring these good things of yours on me suddenly,\" gurgled Jimmy Silver, rolling about the wooden floor of the tent. \"You ought to give a chap some warning. Look here,\" he added, imperatively, \"swear you'll take me with you when you go on your tour through camp examining everybody's right cheek to see if it's got a scratch on it.\"  Kennedy began to feel the glow and pride of the successful sleuth-hound leaking out of him. This aspect of the case had not occurred to him. The fact that the sentry had scratched his assailant's right cheek, added to the other indubitable fact that Walton, of Kay's, was even now walking abroad with a scratch on his right cheek, had seemed to him conclusive. He had forgotten that there might be others. Still, it was worth while just to question him. He questioned him at Cove Reservoir next day.  \"Hullo, Walton,\" he said, with a friendly carelessness which would not have deceived a prattling infant, \"nasty scratch you've got on your cheek. How did you get it?\"  \"Perry did it when we were ragging a few days ago,\" replied Walton, eyeing him distrustfully.  \"Oh,\" said Kennedy.  \"Silly fool,\" said Walton.  \"Talking about me?\" inquired Kennedy politely.  \"No,\" replied Walton, with the suavity of a Chesterfield, \"Perry.\"  They parted, Kennedy with the idea that Walton was his man still more deeply rooted, Walton with an uncomfortable feeling that Kennedy knew too much, and that, though he had undoubtedly scored off him for the moment, a time (as Jimmy Silver was fond of observing with a satanic laugh) would come, and then--!  He felt that it behoved him to be wary.     VIII  A NIGHT ADVENTURE--THE DETHRONEMENT OF FENN   One of the things which make life on this planet more or less agreeable is the speed with which alarums, excursions, excitement, and rows generally, blow over. A nine-days' wonder has to be a big business to last out its full time nowadays. As a rule the third day sees the end of it, and the public rushes whooping after some other hare that has been started for its benefit. The guard-tent row, as far as the bulk of camp was concerned, lasted exactly two days; at the end of which period it was generally agreed that all that could be said on the subject had been said, and that it was now a back number. Nobody, except possibly the authorities, wanted to find out the authors of the raid, and even Private Jones had ceased to talk about it--this owing to the unsympathetic attitude of his tent.  \"Jones,\" the corporal had observed, as the ex-sentry's narrative of his misfortunes reached a finish for the third time since _reveille_ that morning, \"if you can't manage to switch off that infernal chestnut of yours, I'll make you wash up all day and sit on your head all night.\"  So Jones had withdrawn his yarn from circulation. Kennedy's interest in detective work waned after his interview with Walton. He was quite sure that Walton had been one of the band, but it was not his business to find out; even had he found out, he would have done nothing. It was more for his own private satisfaction than for the furtherance of justice that he wished to track the offenders down. But he did not look on the affair, as Jimmy Silver did, as rather sporting; he had a tender feeling for the good name of the school, and he felt that it was not likely to make Eckleton popular with the other schools that went to camp if they got the reputation of practical jokers. Practical jokers are seldom popular until they have been dead a hundred years or so.  As for Walton and his colleagues, to complete the list of those who were interested in this matter of the midnight raid, they lay remarkably low after their successful foray. They imagined that Kennedy was spying on their every movement. In which they were quite wrong, for Kennedy was doing nothing of the kind. Camp does not allow a great deal of leisure for the minding of other people's businesses. But this reflection did not occur to Walton, and he regarded Kennedy, whenever chance or his duties brought him into the neighbourhood of that worthy's tent, with a suspicion which increased whenever the latter looked at him.  On the night before camp broke up, a second incident of a sensational kind occurred, which, but for the fact that they never heard of it, would have given the schools a good deal to talk about. It happened that Kennedy was on sentry-go that night. The manner of sentry-go is thus. At seven in the evening the guard falls in, and patrols the fringe of the camp in relays till seven in the morning. A guard consists of a sergeant, a corporal, and ten men. They are on duty for two hours at a time, with intervals of four hours between each spell, in which intervals they sleep the sleep of tired"]]]
