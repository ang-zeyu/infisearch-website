(#4)"],["body",", a glass of unlawful aqua vitae in the house of my Landlord; nay, that, on the contrary, we needed not such devices, in respect of a pleasing and somewhat seductive liquor, which was vended and consumed at the Wallace Inn, under the name of mountain dew. If there is a penalty against manufacturing such a liquor, let him show me the statute; and when he does, I'll tell him if I will obey it or no. Concerning those who came to my Landlord for liquor, and went thirsty away, for lack of present coin, or future credit, I cannot but say it has grieved my bowels as if the case had been mine own. Nevertheless, my Landlord considered the necessities of a thirsty soul, and would permit them, in extreme need, and when their soul was impoverished for lack of moisture, to drink to the full value of their watches and wearing apparel, exclusively of their inferior habiliments, which he was uniformly inexorable in obliging them to retain, for the credit of the house. As to mine own part, I may well say, that he never refused me that modicum of refreshment with which I am wont to recruit nature after the fatigues of my school. It is true, I taught his five sons English and Latin, writing, book-keeping, with a tincture of mathematics, and that I instructed his daughter in psalmody. Nor do I remember me of any fee or honorarium received from him on account of these my labours, except the compotations aforesaid. Nevertheless this compensation suited my humour well, since it is a hard sentence to bid a dry throat wait till quarter-day.  But, truly, were I to speak my simple conceit and belief, I think my Landlord was chiefly moved to waive in my behalf the usual requisition of a symbol, or reckoning, from the pleasure he was wont to take in my conversation, which, though solid and edifying in the main, was, like a well-built palace, decorated with facetious narratives and devices, tending much to the enhancement and ornament thereof. And so pleased was my Landlord of the Wallace in his replies during such colloquies, that there was no district in Scotland, yea, and no peculiar, and, as it were, distinctive custom therein practised, but was discussed betwixt us; insomuch, that those who stood by were wont to say, it was worth a bottle of ale to hear us communicate with each other. And not a few travellers, from distant parts, as well as from the remote districts of our kingdom, were wont to mingle in the conversation, and to tell news that had been gathered in foreign lands, or preserved from oblivion in this our own. Now I chanced to have contracted for teaching the lower classes with a young person called Peter, or Patrick, Pattieson, who had been educated for our Holy Kirk, yea, had, by the license of presbytery, his voice opened therein as a preacher, who delighted in the collection of olden tales and legends, and in garnishing them with the flowers of poesy, whereof he was a vain and frivolous professor. For he followed not the example of those strong poets whom I proposed to him as a pattern, but formed versification of a flimsy and modern texture, to the compounding whereof was necessary small pains and less thought. And hence I have chid him as being one of those who bring forward the fatal revolution prophesied by Mr. Robert Carey, in his Vaticination on the Death of the celebrated Dr. John Donne:            Now thou art gone, and thy strict laws will be           Too hard for libertines in poetry;           Till verse (by thee refined) in this last age           Turn ballad rhyme.  I had also disputations with him touching his indulging rather a flowing and redundant than a concise and stately diction in his prose exercitations. But notwithstanding these symptoms of inferior taste, and a humour of contradicting his betters upon passages of dubious construction in Latin authors, I did grievously lament when Peter Pattieson was removed from me by death, even as if he had been the offspring of my own loins. And in respect his papers had been left in my care, (to answer funeral and death-bed expenses,) I conceived myself entitled to dispose of one parcel thereof, entitled, \"Tales of my Landlord,\" to one cunning in the trade (as it is called) of book selling. He was a mirthful man, of small stature, cunning in counterfeiting of voices, and in making facetious tales and responses, and whom I have to laud for the truth of his dealings towards me. Now, therefore, the world may see the injustice that charges me with incapacity to write these narratives, seeing, that though I have proved that I could have written them if I would, yet, not having done so, the censure will deservedly fall, if at all due, upon the memory of Mr. Peter Pattieson; whereas I must be justly entitled to the praise, when any is due, seeing that, as the Dean of St. Patrick's wittily and logically expresseth it,                 That without which a thing is not,                Is Causa sine qua non.  The work, therefore, is unto me as a child is to a parent; in the which child, if it proveth worthy, the parent hath honour and praise; but, if otherwise, the disgrace will deservedly attach to itself alone.  I have only further to intimate, that Mr. Peter Pattieson, in arranging these Tales for the press, hath more consulted his own fancy than the accuracy of the narrative; nay, that he hath sometimes blended two or three stories together for the mere grace of his plots. Of which infidelity, although I disapprove and enter my testimony against it, yet I have not taken upon me to correct the same, in respect it was the will of the deceased, that his manuscript should be submitted to the press without diminution or alteration. A fanciful nicety it was on the part of my deceased friend, who, if thinking wisely, ought rather to have conjured me, by all the tender ties of our friendship and common pursuits, to have carefully revised, altered, and augmented, at my judgment and discretion. But the will of the dead must be scrupulously obeyed, even when we weep over their pertinacity and self-delusion. So, gentle reader, I bid you farewell, recommending you to such fare as the mountains of your own country produce; and I will only farther premise, that each Tale is preceded by a short introduction, mentioning the persons by whom, and the circumstances under which, the materials thereof were collected.                                    JEDEDIAH CLEISHBOTHAM.      INTRODUCTION TO OLD MORTALITY.  The remarkable person, called by the title of Old Mortality, was we'll known in Scotland about the end of the last century. His real name was Robert Paterson. He was a native, it is said, of the parish of Closeburn, in Dumfries-shire, and probably a mason by profession--at least educated to the use of the chisel. Whether family dissensions, or the deep and enthusiastic feeling of supposed duty, drove him to leave his dwelling, and adopt the singular mode of life in which he wandered, like a palmer, through Scotland, is not known. It could not be poverty, however, which prompted his journeys, for he never accepted anything beyond the hospitality which was willingly rendered him, and when that was not proffered, he always had money enough to provide for his own humble wants. His personal appearance, and favourite, or rather sole occupation, are accurately described in the preliminary chapter of the following work.  It is about thirty years since, or more, that the author met this singular person in the churchyard of Dunnottar, when spending a day or two with the late learned and excellent clergyman, Mr. Walker, the minister of that parish, for the purpose of a close examination of the ruins of the Castle of Dunnottar, and other subjects of antiquarian research in that neighbourhood. Old Mortality chanced to be at the same place, on the usual business of his pilgrimage; for the Castle of Dunnottar, though lying in the anti-covenanting district of the Mearns, was, with the parish churchyard, celebrated for the oppressions sustained there by the Cameronians in the time of James II.  It was in 1685, when Argyle was threatening a descent upon Scotland, and Monmouth was preparing to invade the west of England, that the Privy Council of Scotland, with cruel precaution, made a general arrest of more than a hundred persons in the southern and western provinces, supposed, from their religious principles, to be inimical to Government, together with many women and children. These captives were driven northward like a flock of bullocks, but with less precaution to provide for their wants, and finally penned up in a subterranean dungeon in the Castle of Dunnottar, having a window opening to the front of a precipice which overhangs the German Ocean. They had suffered not a little on the journey, and were much hurt both at the scoffs of the northern prelatists, and the mocks, gibes, and contemptuous tunes played by the fiddlers and pipers who had come from every quarter as they passed, to triumph over the revilers of their calling. The repose which the melancholy dungeon afforded them, was anything but undisturbed. The guards made them pay for every indulgence, even that of water; and when some of the prisoners resisted a demand so unreasonable, and insisted on their right to have this necessary of life untaxed, their keepers emptied the water on the prison floor, saying, \"If they were obliged to bring water for the canting whigs, they were not bound to afford them the use of bowls or pitchers gratis.\"  In this prison, which is still termed the Whig's Vault, several died of the diseases incidental to such a situation; and others broke their limbs, and incurred fatal injury, in desperate attempts to escape from their stern prison-house. Over the graves of these unhappy persons, their friends, after the Revolution, erected a monument with a suitable inscription.  This peculiar shrine of the Whig martyrs is very much honoured by their descendants, though residing at a great distance from the land"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6939"],["title","Old Mortality, Volume 1. (#5)"],["body"," their captivity and death. My friend, the Rev. Mr. Walker, told me, that being once upon a tour in the south of Scotland, probably about forty years since, he had the bad luck to involve himself in the labyrinth of passages and tracks which cross, in every direction, the extensive waste called Lochar Moss, near Dumfries, out of which it is scarcely possible for a stranger to extricate himself; and there was no small difficulty in procuring a guide, since such people as he saw were engaged in digging their peats--a work of paramount necessity, which will hardly brook interruption. Mr. Walker could, therefore, only procure unintelligible directions in the southern brogue, which differs widely from that of the Mearns. He was beginning to think himself in a serious dilemma, when he stated his case to a farmer of rather the better class, who was employed, as the others, in digging his winter fuel. The old man at first made the same excuse with those who had already declined acting as the traveller's guide; but perceiving him in great perplexity, and paying the respect due to his profession, \"You are a clergyman, sir?\" he said. Mr. Walker assented. \"And I observe from your speech, that you are from the north?\"--\"You are right, my good friend,\" was the reply. \"And may I ask if you have ever heard of a place called Dunnottar?\"--\"I ought to know something about it, my friend,\" said Mr. Walker, \"since I have been several years the minister of the parish.\"--\"I am glad to hear it,\" said the Dumfriesian, \"for one of my near relations lies buried there, and there is, I believe, a monument over his grave. I would give half of what I am aught, to know if it is still in existence.\"--\"He was one of those who perished in the Whig's Vault at the castle?\" said the minister; \"for there are few southlanders besides lying in our churchyard, and none, I think, having monuments.\"--\"Even sae--even sae,\" said the old Cameronian, for such was the farmer. He then laid down his spade, cast on his coat, and heartily offered to see the minister out of the moss, if he should lose the rest of the _day's dargue_. Mr. Walker was able to requite him amply, in his opinion, by reciting the epitaph, which he remembered by heart. The old man was enchanted with finding the memory of his grandfather or great-grandfather faithfully recorded amongst the names of brother sufferers; and rejecting all other offers of recompense, only requested, after he had guided Mr. Walker to a safe and dry road, that he would let him have a written copy of the inscription.  It was whilst I was listening to this story, and looking at the monument referred to, that I saw Old Mortality engaged in his daily task of cleaning and repairing the ornaments and epitaphs upon the tomb. His appearance and equipment were exactly as described in the Novel. I was very desirous to see something of a person so singular, and expected to have done so, as he took up his quarters with the hospitable and liberal-spirited minister. But though Mr. Walker invited him up after dinner to partake of a glass of spirits and water, to which he was supposed not to be very averse, yet he would not speak frankly upon the subject of his occupation. He was in bad humour, and had, according to his phrase, no freedom for conversation with us.  His spirit had been sorely vexed by hearing, in a certain Aberdonian kirk, the psalmody directed by a pitch-pipe, or some similar instrument, which was to Old Mortality the abomination of abominations. Perhaps, after all, he did not feel himself at ease with his company; he might suspect the questions asked by a north-country minister and a young barrister to savour more of idle curiosity than profit. At any rate, in the phrase of John Bunyan, Old Mortality went on his way, and I saw him no more.  The remarkable figure and occupation of this ancient pilgrim was recalled to my memory by an account transmitted by my friend Mr. Joseph Train, supervisor of excise at Dumfries, to whom I owe many obligations of a similar nature. From this, besides some other circumstances, among which are those of the old man's death, I learned the particulars described in the text. I am also informed, that the old palmer's family, in the third generation, survives, and is highly respected both for talents and worth. While these sheets were passing through the press, I received the following communication from Mr. Train, whose undeviating kindness had, during the intervals of laborious duty, collected its materials from an indubitable source.       \"In the course of my periodical visits to the Glenkens, I have      become intimately acquainted with Robert Paterson, a son of Old      Mortality, who lives in the little village of Balmaclellan; and      although he is now in the 70th year of his age, preserves all the      vivacity of youth--has a most retentive memory, and a mind stored      with information far above what could be expected from a person in      his station of life. To him I am indebted for the following      particulars relative to his father, and his descendants down to the      present time.       \"Robert Paterson, alias Old Mortality, was the son of Walter      Paterson and Margaret Scott, who occupied the farm of Ilaggisha, in      the parish of Hawick, during nearly the first half of the eighteenth      century. Here Robert was born, in the memorable year 1715.       \"Being the youngest son of a numerous family, he, at an early age,      went to serve with an elder brother, named Francis, who rented, from      Sir John Jardine of Applegarth, a small tract in Comcockle Moor,      near Lochmaben. During his residence there, he became acquainted      with Elizabeth Gray, daughter of Robert Gray, gardener to Sir John      Jardine, whom he afterwards married. His wife had been, for a      considerable time, a cook-maid to Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick of      Closeburn, who procured for her husband, from the Duke of      Queensberry, an advantageous lease of the freestone quarry of      Gatelowbrigg, in the parish of Morton. Here he built a house, and      had as much land as kept a horse and cow. My informant cannot say,      with certainty, the year in which his father took up his residence      at Gatelowbrigg, but he is sure it must have been only a short time      prior to the year 1746, as, during the memorable frost in 1740, he      says his mother still resided in the service of Sir Thomas      Kirkpatrick. When the Highlanders were returning from England on      their route to Glasgow, in the year 1745-6, they plundered Mr.      Paterson's house at Gatelowbrigg, and carried him a prisoner as far      as Glenbuck, merely because he said to one of the straggling army,      that their retreat might have been easily foreseen, as the strong      arm of the Lord was evidently raised, not only against the bloody      and wicked house of Stewart, but against all who attempted to      support the abominable heresies of the Church of Rome. From this      circumstance it appears that Old Mortality had, even at that early      period of his life, imbibed the religious enthusiasm by which he      afterwards became so much distinguished.       \"The religious sect called Hill-men, or Cameronians, was at that      time much noted for austerity and devotion, in imitation of Cameron,      their founder, of whose tenets Old Mortality became a most strenuous      supporter. He made frequent journeys into Galloway to attend their      conventicles, and occasionally carried with him gravestones from his      quarry at Gatelowbrigg, to keep in remembrance the righteous whose      dust had been gathered to their fathers. Old Mortality was not one      of those religious devotees, who, although one eye is seemingly      turned towards heaven, keep the other steadfastly fixed on some      sublunary object. As his enthusiasm increased, his journeys into      Galloway became more frequent; and he gradually neglected even the      common prudential duty of providing for his offspring. From about      the year 1758, he neglected wholly to return from Galloway to his      wife and five children at Gatelowbrigg, which induced her to send      her eldest son Walter, then only twelve years of age, to Galloway,      in search of his father. After traversing nearly the whole of that      extensive district, from the Nick of Benncorie to the Fell of      Barullion, he found him at last working on the Cameronian monuments,      in the old kirkyard of Kirkchrist, on the west side of the Dee,      opposite the town of Kirkcudbright. The little wanderer used all the      influence in his power to induce his father to return to his family;      but in vain. Mrs. Paterson sent even some of her female children      into Galloway in search of their father, for the same purpose of      persuading him to return home; but without any success. At last, in      the summer of 1768, she removed to the little upland village of      Balmaclellan, in the Glenkens of Galloway, where, upon the small      pittance derived from keeping a little school, she supported her      numerous family in a respectable manner.       \"There is a small monumental stone in the farm of the Caldon, near      the House of the Hill, in Wigtonshire, which is highly venerated as      being the first erected, by Old Mortality, to the memory of several      persons who fell at that place in defence of their religious tenets      in the civil war, in the reign of Charles Second.       \"From the Caldon, the labours of Old Mortality, in the course of      time, spread over nearly all the Lowlands of Scotland. There are few      churchyards in Ayrshire, Galloway, or Dumfries-shire, where the work      of his chisel is not yet to be seen. It is easily distinguished from      the work of any other artist by the primitive rudeness of the      emblems of death, and of the inscriptions which adorn the ill-formed      blocks of his erection.
