FANNY, THE FLOWER-GIRL   \"Come, buy my flowers; flowers fresh and fair. Come, buy my flowers. Please ma'am, buy a nice bunch of flowers, very pretty ones, ma'am. Please, sir, to have some flowers; nice, fresh ones, miss; only just gathered; please look.\"  Thus spoke, or sometimes sung, a little girl of perhaps eight years old, holding in her hand a neat small basket, on the top of which lay a clean white cloth, to shade from the sun the flowers which she praised so highly, and a little bunch of which she presented to almost every passer-by, in the hope of finding purchasers; while, after one had passed rudely on, another had looked at her young face and smiled, another had said, \"What a nice child!\" but not one had taken the flowers, and left the penny or the half-penny that was to pay for them the little girl, as if accustomed to all this, only arranged again the pretty nosegays that had been disarranged in the vain hope of selling them, and commenced anew in her pretty singing tone, \"Come, buy my flowers; flowers fresh and fair.\"  \"Your flowers are sadly withered, my little maid,\" said a kind, country-looking gentleman, who was buying some vegetables at a stall near her.  \"Oh, sir! I have fresh ones, here, sir; please look;\" and the child lifted up the cover of her basket, and drew from the very bottom a bunch of blossoms on which the dew of morning still rested.  \"Please to see, sir; a pretty rose, sir, and these pinks and mignonette, and a bunch of jessamine, sir, and all for one penny.\"  \"Bless thee! pretty dear!\" said the old lame vegetable-seller, \"thou'lt make a good market-woman one of these days. Your honor would do well to buy her flowers, sir, she has got no mother or father, God help her, and works for a sick grandmother.\"  \"Poor child!\" said the old gentleman. \"Here, then, little one, give me three nice nosegays, and there is sixpence for you.\"  With delight sparkling in every feature of her face, and her color changed to crimson with joy, the little flower-girl received in one hand the unusual piece of money; and setting her basket on the ground, began hastily and tremblingly to pick out nearly half its contents as the price of the sixpence; but the gentleman stooped down, and taking up at random three bunches of the flowers, which were not the freshest, said,  \"Here, these will do; keep the rest for a more difficult customer. Be a good child; pray to God, and serve Him, and you will find He is the Father of the fatherless.\"  And so he went away; and the flower-girl, without waiting to put her basket in order, turned to the old vegetable-seller, and cried, \"Sixpence! a whole sixpence, and all at once. What will grandmother say now? See!\" and opening her hand, she displayed its shining before her neighbor's eyes.  \"Eh!\" exclaimed the old man, as he approached his eyes nearer to it. \"Eh! what is this? why thou hast twenty sixpences there; this is a half-sovereign!\"  \"Twenty sixpences! why the gentleman said, there is sixpence for thee,\" said the child.  \"Because he didn't know his mistake,\" replied the other; \"I saw him take the piece out of his waistcoat-pocket without looking.\"  \"Oh dear! what shall I do?\" cried the little girl.  \"Why, thou must keep it, to be sure,\" replied the old man; \"give it to thy grandmother, she will know what to do with it, I warrant thee.\"  \"But I must first try to find the good gentleman, and tell him of his mistake,\" said the child. \"I know what grandmother would say else; and he cannot be far off, I think, because he was so fat; he will go slow, I am sure, this hot morning. Here, Mr. Williams, take care of my basket, please, till I come back.\"  And without a word more, the flower-girl put down her little basket at the foot of the vegetable-stall, and ran away as fast as she could go.  When she turned out of the market-place, she found, early as it was, that the street before her was pretty full; but as from the passage the gentleman had taken to leave the market-place, she knew he could only have gone in one direction, she had still hopes of finding him; and she ran on and on, until she actually thought she saw the very person before her; he had just taken off his hat, and was wiping his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"That is him,\" said the little flower-girl, \"I am certain;\" but just as she spoke, some persons came between her and the gentleman, and she could not see him. Still she kept running on; now passing off the foot-path into the street, and then seeing the fat gentleman still before her; and then again getting on the foot-path, and losing sight of him, until at last she came up quite close to him, as he was walking slowly, and wiping the drops of heat from his forehead.  The poor child was then quite out of breath; and when she got up to him she could not call out to him to stop, nor say one word; so she caught hold of the skirt of his coat, and gave it a strong pull.  The gentleman started, and clapped one hand on his coat-pocket, and raised up his cane in the other, for he was quite sure it was a pickpocket at his coat. But when he turned, he saw the breathless little flower-girl, and he looked rather sternly at her, and said,  \"Well, what do you want; what are you about? eh!\"  \"Oh, sir!\" said the girl; and then she began to cough, for her breath was quite spent. \"See, sir; you said you gave me sixpence, and Mr. Williams says there are twenty sixpences in this little bit of money.\"  \"Dear me!\" said the gentleman; \"is it possible? could I have done such a thing?\" and he began to fumble in his waistcoat pocket.  \"Well, really it is true enough,\" he added, as he drew out a sixpence. \"See what it is to put gold and silver together.\"  \"I wish he would give it to me,\" thought the little flower-girl; \"how happy it would make poor granny; and perhaps he has got a good many more of these pretty gold pieces.\"  But the old gentleman put out his hand, and took it, and turned it over and over, and seemed to think a little; and then he put his hand into his pocket again, and took out his purse; and he put the half-sovereign into the purse, and took out of it another sixpence.  \"Well,\" he said, \"there is the sixpence I owe you for the flowers; you have done right to bring me back this piece of gold; and there is another sixpence for your race; it is not a reward, mind, for honesty is only our duty, and you only did what is right; but you are tired, and have left your employment, and perhaps lost a customer, so I give you the other sixpence to make you amends.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said the flower-girl, curtseying; and taking the two sixpences into her hand with a delighted smile, was going to run back again, when the old gentleman, pulling out a pocket-book, said, \"Stay a moment; you are an orphan, they tell me; what is your name?\"  \"Fanny, sir.\"  \"Fanny what?\"  \"Please, I don't know, sir; grandmother is Mrs. Newton, sir; but she says she is not my grandmother either, sir.\"  \"Well, tell me where Mrs. Newton lives,\" said the gentleman, after looking at her a minute or so, as if trying to make out what she meant.  So Fanny told him, and he wrote it down in his pocket-book, and then read over what he had written to her, and she said it was right.  \"Now, then, run away back,\" said he, \"and sell all your flowers, if you can, before they wither, for they will not last long this warm day; flowers are like youth and beauty--do you ever think of that? even the rose withereth afore it groweth up.\" And this fat gentleman looked very sad, for he had lost all his children in their youth.  \"O yes! sir; I know a verse which says that,\" replied Fanny. \"All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of grass--but good morning, and thank you, sir,\" and away Fanny ran.  And now, before going on with my story, I must go back to tell who and what Fanny, the flower-girl, was.  Mrs. Newton, whom she called her grandmother, was now a poor old woman, confined to her bed by a long and trying illness, that had nearly deprived her of the use of her limbs. But she had not been always thus afflicted. Some years before, Mrs. Newton lived in a neat cottage near the road-side, two or three miles from one of the great sea-port towns of England. Her husband had good employment, and they were both comfortable and happy.  Just eight years from this time, it happened that one warm summer's day, Mrs. Newton went to look out from her cottage door down the road, and she saw a young woman standing there, leaning against a tree, and looking very faint and weak.  She was touched with pity and asked the poor traveller to walk into her house and rest. The young woman thankfully consented, for she said she was very ill; but she added, that her husband was coming after her, having been obliged to turn back for a parcel that was left behind at the house where they had halted some time before, and therefore she would sit near the door and watch for him.  Before, however, the husband came, the poor woman was taken dreadfully ill; and when he did arrive, good Mrs. Newton could not bear to put the poor creature out of the house in such a state; she became worse and worse. In short, that poor young woman was Fanny's mother, and when little Fanny was born, that poor sick mother died, and Fanny never saw a mother's smile.  The day after the young woman's death, kind Mrs. Newton came into the room where her cold body was laid out on the bed; and there was her husband, a young, strong-looking man, sitting beside it; his elbows were on his knees, and his face was hid in his open hands.  Mrs. Newton had the baby in her arms, and she spoke to its father as she came in; he looked up to her; his own face was as pale as death; and he looked at her without saying a word. She saw he was in too much grief either to speak or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6757"],["title","Fanny, the Flower-Girl; or, Honesty Rewarded. To Which are Added Other Tales (#1)"],["body","p. So she went over silently to him, and put the little baby into his arms, and then said, \"May the Lord look down with pity on you both.\"  As soon as the unhappy young man heard these compassionate words, and saw the face of his pretty, peaceful babe, he burst into tears; they rolled in large drops down on the infant's head.  Then in a short time he was able to speak, and he told Mrs. Newton his sad little history; how he had no one in the whole world to look with pity on him, or his motherless child; and how God alone was his hope in this day of calamity. His father had been displeased with him because he had married that young woman, whom he dearly loved; and he had given him some money that was his portion, and would do nothing else for him. The young man had taken some land and a house, but as the rent was too high, he could not make enough of the land to pay it; so he had been obliged to sell all his goods, and he had only as much money left as would, with great saving, carry him to America, where he had a brother who advised him to go out there.  \"And now,\" said he, looking over at the pale face of his dear wife, \"What shall I do with the little creature she has left me? how shall I carry it over the wide ocean without a mother to care for it, and nurse it?\"  \"You cannot do so,\" said Mrs. Newton, wiping her eyes; \"leave it with me; I have no children of my own, my husband would like to have one; this babe shall lie in my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter. I will nurse it for you until you are settled in America, and send or come for it.\"  The young man wept with gratitude; he wanted to know how he was to repay Mrs. Newton, but she said for the present she did not want payment, that it would be a pleasure to her to have the baby; and it would be time enough to talk about payment when the father was able to claim it, and take it to a home.  So the next day they buried the poor young woman, and soon after the young man went away and sailed off to America, and from that day to this Mrs. Newton had never heard anything of him.  As she had said, that poor little motherless babe lay in her bosom, and was unto her as a daughter; she loved it; she loved it when it was a helpless little thing, weak and sickly; she loved it when it grew a pretty lively baby, and would set its little feet on her knees, and crow and caper before her face; she loved it when it began to play around her as she sat at work, to lisp out the word \"Ganny,\" for she taught it to call her grandmother; she loved it when it would follow her into her nice garden, and pick a flower and carry it to her, as she sat in the little arbor; and she, holding the flower, would talk to it of God who made the flower, and made the bee that drew honey from the flower, and made the sun that caused the flower to grow, and the light that gave the flower its colors, and the rain that watered it, and the earth that nourished it. And she loved that child when it came back from the infant school, and climbed up on her lap, or stood with its hands behind its back, to repeat some pretty verses about flowers, or about the God who made them. That child was Fanny, the flower-girl; and ah! how little did good Mrs. Newton think she would be selling flowers in the streets to help to support her.  But it came to pass, that when Fanny was nearly six years old, Mrs. Newton's husband fell very ill; it was a very bad, and very expensive illness, for poor Mrs. Newton was so uneasy, she would sometimes have two doctors to see him; but all would not do; he died: and Mrs. Newton was left very poorly off.  In a short time she found she could not keep on her pretty cottage; she was obliged to leave it; and the church where she had gone every Sunday for so many years; and the church-yard where her husband was buried, and little Fanny's mother; and the infant school where Fanny learned so much; and the dear little garden, and the flowers that were Fanny's teachers and favorites. Oh! how sorry was poor Mrs. Newton. But even a little child can give comfort; and so little Fanny, perhaps without thinking to do so, did; for when Mrs. Newton for the last time sat out in her garden, and saw the setting sun go down, and told Fanny she was going to leave that pretty garden, where she had from infancy been taught to know God's works, the child looked very sad and thoughtful indeed, for some time; but afterwards coming up to her, said,  \"But, grandmother, we shall not leave God, shall we? for you say God is everywhere, and He will be in London too.\"  And oh! how that thought consoled poor Mrs. Newton; she did not leave God,--God did not leave her.  So she left the abode of her younger years--the scene of her widowhood; and she went away to hire a poor lodging in the outlets of London; but her God was with her, and the child she had nursed in her prosperity was her comfort in adversity.  Matters, however, went no better when she lived with little Fanny in a poor lodging. She had only one friend in London, and she lived at a distance from her. Mrs. Newton fell ill; there was no one to nurse her but Fanny; she could no longer pay for her schooling, and sometimes she was not able to teach her herself.  All this seemed very hard, and very trying; and one would have been tempted to think that God was no longer with poor Mrs. Newton; that when she had left her cottage she had left the God who had been so good to her.  But this would have been a great mistake. God was with Mrs. Newton; He saw fit to try and afflict her; but He gave her strength and patience to bear her trials and afflictions.  One afternoon her friend came to pay her a visit: she was going out a little way into the country to see a relation who had a very fine nursery-garden, and she begged Mrs. Newton to let little Fanny go with her own daughter. Mrs. Newton was very glad to do so for she thought it would be a nice amusement for Fanny.  The nurseryman was very kind to her; and when she was going away gave her a fine bunch of flowers. Fanny was in great delight, for she loved flowers and knew her dear grandmother loved them too. But as she was coming back, and just as she was entering the streets, she met a lady and a little boy of about three years old, who directly held out his hands and began to beg for the flowers. His mamma stopped, and as Fanny was very poorly dressed, she thought it probable that she would sell her nosegay, and so she said,  \"Will you give that bunch of flowers to my little boy, and I will pay you for it?\"  \"Please, ma'am, they are for grandmother,\" said Fanny blushing, and thinking she ought to give the flowers directly, and without money to any one who wished for them.  \"But perhaps your grand-mother would rather have this sixpence?\" said the lady. And Mrs. Newton's friend, who had just come up, said,  \"Well, my dear, take the lady's sixpence, and let her have the flowers if she wishes for them.\"  So Fanny held the flowers to the lady, who took them and put the sixpence in her hand. Fanny wished much to ask for one rose, but she thought it would not be right to do so, when the lady had bought them all: and she looked at them so very longingly that the lady asked if she were sorry to part with them.  \"Oh! no, ma'am,\" cried her friend, \"she is not at all sorry--come now, don't be a fool, child,\" she whispered, and led Fanny on.  \"That is a good bargain for you,\" she added as she went on; \"that spoiled little master has his own way, I think; it would be well for you, and your grandmother too, if you could sell sixpenny worth of flowers every day.\"  \"Do you think I could, ma'am?\" said Fanny, opening her hand and looking at her sixpence, \"this will buy something to do poor granny good; do you think Mr. Simpson would give me a nosegay every day?\"  \"If you were to pay him for it, he would,\" said her friend; \"suppose you were to go every morning about five o'clock, as many others do, and buy some flowers, and then sell them at the market; you might earn something, and that would be better than being idle, when poor Mrs. Newton is not able to do for herself and you.\"  So when Fanny got back, she gave her dear grandmother the sixpence.  \"The Lord be praised!\" said Mrs. Newton, \"for I scarcely knew how I was to get a loaf of bread for thee or myself to-morrow.\"  And then Fanny told her the plan she had formed about the flowers.  Mrs. Newton was very sorry to think her dear child should be obliged to stand in a market place, or in the public streets, to offer anything for sale; but she said, \"Surely it is Providence has opened this means of gaining a little bread, while I am laid here unable to do anything; and shall I not trust that Providence with the care of my darling child?\"  So from this time forth little Fanny set off every morning before five o'clock, to the nursery garden; and the nursery-man was very kind to her, and always gave her the nicest flowers; and instead of sitting down with the great girls, who went there also for flowers or vegetables, and tying them up in bunches, Fanny put them altogether in her little basket, and went away to her grandmother's room, and spread them out on the little table that poor Mrs. Newton might see them, while the sweet dew was yet sparkling on their bright leaves.  Then she would tell how beautiful the garden looked at that sweet early hour; and Mrs. Newton would listen with pleasure, for she loved a garden. She used to say, that God placed man in a garden when he was happy and holy; and when he was sinful and sorrowful, it was in a garden that the blessed Saviour wept and prayed for the sin of the world; and when his death had made atonement for that sin, it was in a garden his blessed body was laid.  Mrs. Newton taught Fanny many things from flowers; she was not a bad teacher, in her own simple way, but Jesus Christ, who was the best teacher the world ever had, instructed his disciples from vines and lilies, corn and fruit, and birds, and all natural things around them."]]]
