If I don't marry that girl, I--I'll go off my balance, that's all, and I'm not going to overlook any advantage whatever. Fresno sings love-songs, and he's got a mint of money. Well, I'm going to work this athletic pose to death. I'm going into training, I'm going to talk, eat, sleep, live athletics for a week, and when I'm unexpectedly crippled on the eve of the race, it is going to break my heart. Understand! I am going to be so desperately disappointed that I'll have to choose between suicide and marriage. The way I feel now, I think I'll choose marriage. But you must help.\"  \"Leave it to me, Bo!\"  \"In the first place, I want some training-quarters.\"  \"That's right, don't be a piker.\"  \"And I want you to boost.\"  \"I'm there! When do we begin?\"  \"Right away. Unpack my running-suit and rub some dirt on it--it's too new. I think I'll limber up, and let her get a look at the clothes.\"  \"It's a bright idea; but don't let these animal-trainers see you run, or the stuff will be cold in a minute.\"  \"Fine! We'll have secret practice! That suits me perfectly.\" Speed laughed with joy.  From inside the house came the strains of _Dearie_, sung in a sympathetic tenor, and upon the conclusion Berkeley Fresno's voice inquiring:  \"Miss Blake, did I ever tell you about the time I sang _Dearie_ to the mayor's daughter in Walla Walla?\"  Miss Blake appeared on the gallery with her musical admirer at her elbow.  \"Yes,\" said she, sweetly. \"You told me all about the mayor's daughter a week ago.\" Then spying Speed and his companion, she exclaimed: \"Mr. Fresno has a fine voice, hasn't he? He sings with the Stanford Glee Club.\"  \"Indeed.\"  \"Sure!\" The Native Son of the Golden West shook up a hammock- cushion for the girl. \"Tenor!\" said he, sententiously.  \"Say no more,\" Speed remarked; \"it's all right with us!\"  Fresno looked up.  \"What's wrong with my singing?\"  \"Oh, I've just told the girls that you're going to run that foot- race,\" Helen interposed, hurriedly, at which Fresno exploded.  \"What's wrong with my running?\" inquired Speed.  \"I can beat you!\"  Larry Glass nudged his employer openly, and seemed on the verge of hysteria. \"Let him go,\" said he. \"Let him go; he's funny.\"  Speed addressed Helen, with a magnanimous smile:  \"Suppose we allow Frez to _sing_ this foot-race? We'll pull it off in the treble cleff.\"  \"Oh, I mean it!\" maintained the tenor, stubbornly. \"I don't want to run Skinner, the cook, but I'll run you to see who does meet him.\"  Speed shrugged his shoulders indulgently.  \"I'm afraid you're a little overweight.\"  \"I'll train down.\"  \"Perhaps if you wait until I beat this cook, I'll take you on.\"  Glass broke out, in husky indignation: \"Sure! Get a rep, Cull, get a rep!\" Then to his employer: \"Come on, Wally, you've got to warm up.\" He mounted the steps heavily with his protege.  When they had gone, Miss Blake clapped her hands.  \"I'm so excited!\" she exclaimed. \"You see, it's all my doings! Oh, how I adore athletes!\"  \"Most young girls do,\" Fresno smiled, sourly. \"My taste runs more to music.\" After a moment's meditation, he observed: \"Speed doesn't look like a sprinter to me. I--I'll wager he can't do a hundred yards in fifteen-two.\"  \"'Fifteen-two' is cribbage,\" said Miss Blake.  \"Fifteen and two-fifths seconds is what I mean.\"  \"Is that fast?\"  Fresno smiled, indulgently this time. \"Jean's friend Covington can go the distance in nine and four-fifths seconds. He's a real sprinter. I think this fellow is a joke.\"  \"Indeed he is _not!_ If Mr. Covington can run as fast as that, Mr. Speed can run faster. He told me so.\"  \"Oh!\" Fresno looked at her curiously. \"The world's record is nine and _three_-fifths; that's the limit of human endurance.\"  \"I hope he doesn't injure himself,\" breathed the girl, and the tenor wandered away, disgusted beyond measure. When he was out of hearing, he remarked, aloud:  \"I'll bet he runs so slow we'll have to wind a stop-watch on him. Anyhow, I think I'll find out something more about this race.\"  Once in his room, Mr. J. Wallingford Speed made a search for writing materials, while Larry Glass overhauled a trunk filled with athletic clothing of various descriptions. There were running-suits, rowing-suits, baseball and football suits, sweaters, jerseys, and bath robes--all of which were new and unstained. At the bottom Glass discovered a box full of bronze and near-gold emblems.  \"Here's your medals,\" said he.  \"Good! I'll wear them.\"  \"Nix! You can't do that. Those gals will get wise.\" He selected one, and read on the reverse side. \"Clerk of the course\"; another was engraved \"Starter.\" All were official badges of some sort or other. \"You always were strong on the 'Reception Committee' stuff. There's six of them,\" said he.  Speed pointed to the bureau. \"Try a nail-file. See if you can't scratch off the lettering. How's this?\" He read what he had written for the wire. \"'Culver Covington, and so forth. Come quick. First train. Native Son making love to Jean.--Wally.' Ten words, and it tells the whole story. I can hardly explain why I want him, can I? He expects to stop off in Omaha for a day or two, but he'll be under way in an hour after he gets this. I hate to spoil his little visit, but he can take that in on his way home. Now I'll ring for somebody, and have this taken over to the station by the first wagon.\"  \"Say, you better scratch this Fresno,\" said Larry.  \"Why?\"  \"He's hep to you.\"  \"Nonsense!\"  Glass looked up at a sound, to discover Mariedetta, the Mexican maid, who had come in answer to Speed's call.  \"In the doorway'\" the trainer said, under his breath. \"Pipe the Cuban Queen!\"  \"You call?\" inquired Mariedetta of the younger man.  \"Yes, I want this telegram to go to the depot as soon as possible.\"  Mariedetta took the message and turned silently, but as she went she flashed a look at Glass which caused that short-waisted gentleman to wink at his companion.  \"Some frill! Eh? I'm for her! She's strong for me, too.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"We talked it over. I gave her a little kiss to keep for me.\"  \"Careful, Larry! She may have a cowboy sweetheart.\"  Glass grunted, disparagingly.  \"Them ginnys is jokes to me.\"  As Speed talked he clad himself in his silken uniform, donned his spiked shoes, and pinned the medals upon his chest.  \"How do I look?\" he queried.  \"Immense! If she likes athletes, it's a walk-away for you.\"  \"Then give me the baby-blue bath robe with the monogram. We'll go out and trot around a little.\"  But his complacency received a shock as he stepped out upon the veranda. Not only Helen Blake awaited him, but the other girls as well, while out in front were a dozen or more cowboys whom Fresno had rallied. \"Goin' to take a little run, eh?\" inquired Stover. \"We allowed we'd lay off a few minutes and watch you.\"  \"Thanks!\"  \"Yes,\" Fresno spoke up. \"I told the boys we'd better hold a stop- watch on you and see what shape you're in.\"  \"A stop-watch?\" said Glass, sharply.  \"Yes. I have one.\"  \"Not to-day,\" said Speed's trainer. \"No!\" he admonished, as his protege turned upon him. \"Some other time, mebbe. You're just off a long trip, and I can't risk gettin' you stove up.\"  \"To-morrow, perhaps,\" urged Fresno.  \"I wouldn't promise.\"  \"Then the next day. I've timed lots of men. The watch is correct.\"  \"Let's see it.\" Glass held out his hand.  \"Oh, it's a good watch. It cost me one hundred and twenty-five dollars.\"  As Glass reached for the timepiece an unfortunate accident occurred. Speed struck his elbow, and the watch fell. Fresno dove for it, then held it to his ear and shook it.  \"You've broken it!\" he cried, accusingly.  \"Oh, I'm sorry! My fault,\" Speed apologized.  \"If it was your fault, maybe you'll fix it,\" suggested the tenor.  \"Gladly!\" Speed turned to his trainer. \"Buy a new alarm-clock for our little friend.\" He stripped off his bath robe, and handed it to his trainer. \"Is she looking at me?\" he whispered.  \"Both eyes, big as saucers.\"  Speed settled his spikes into the dirt as he had seen other sprinters do, set himself for an instant, then loped easily around the house and out of sight.  To the cowboys this athletic panoply was vastly impressive. With huge satisfaction they noticed the sleeveless shirt, the loose running-trunks, and, above all, the generous display of medals. With a wild yell of delight they broke out upon the trail of their champion, only to have Glass thrust his corpulent body in their path. With an upflung arm he stemmed the tide.  \"It's no use, boys,\" he cried, \"he's a mile away!\"     CHAPTER VI  \"This doesn't look much like our storehouse, does it?\" Jean paused in her task, and, seating herself upon the summit of a step-ladder, scrutinized with satisfaction the transformation wrought by a myriad of college flags, sofa cushions, colored shawls, and bunting.  Roberta Keap dropped her hammer with an exclamation of pain.  \"Ouch!\" she cried, \"I've hurt my thumb. I can't hit where I look when people are talking.\"  \"Why don't you pin them up?\" queried Miss Blake, sweetly. \"A hammer is so dangerous.\"  Mrs. Keap mumbled something, but her enunciation was indistinct, owing to the fact that her thumb was in her mouth. Helen finished tying a bow of ribbon upon the leg of a stool, patted it into proper form, then said:  \"It looks cheerful.\"  \"And restful,\" added Jean.  \"I think a gymnasium should be restful, above all things,\" agreed Helen. \"Most of them are so bare and strenuous-looking they give one a headache.\" She spied a Whiteley exerciser fastened against the wall, the one bit of gymnastic apparatus in the room. 'Oh, the puller!' she cried. \"I mustn't forget the puller!\" She selected a pink satin ribbon, and tied a chic bow upon one of the wooden handles. \"There! We can let him in now.\"  \"Oh dear!\" Jean descended from her precarious position and admitted, \"I'm tired out.\"  All that morning the three had labored, busily transforming the store-room into training-quarters for Speed, who had declared that such things were not only customary"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6488"],["title","Going Some (#7)"],["body","necessary. To be sure, it adjoined the bunk-room, where the cowboys slept, and there were no gymnastic appliances to give it character, but it was the only space available, and what it lacked in horizontal bars, dumb-bells, and Indian clubs it more than compensated for by a cosey-corner, a window-seat, and many cushions. Speed had expressed his delight with the idea, and agreed to wait for a glimpse of it.  And the atmosphere at the Flying Heart Ranch was clearing. The gloom of the cowboys had given way to a growing excitement, a part of which communicated itself to the occupants of the house. The lassitude of previous days was gone, the monotony had disappeared, and Miss Chapin had cause to rejoice at the presence of her latest guest, for Speed was like a tonic. He was everywhere, he inspired them all, laughter followed in his wake. Even in the bunk-house the cowboys retailed his extravagant stories with delight. The Flying Heart had come into its own at last; the Centipede, most scorned and hated of rivals, was due for lasting defeat. Even Cloudy, the Indian, relaxed and spoke at rare intervals, while Willie worked about the place gleefully, singing snatches of _Sam Bass_ in a tuneless falsetto. Carara had come back from the Centipede with news that gladdened the hearts of his hearers: not only would that despicable outfit consent to run a foot-race, but they clamored for it. They did not dicker over details nor haggle about terms, but consented to put up the phonograph again, and all the money at their disposal as well. The cook was in training.  Of all the denizens of the Flying Heart but two failed to enter fully into the spirit of the thing. Berkeley Fresno looked on with a cynicism which he was too wise to display before Miss Blake. Seeing the lady of his dreams monopolized by a rival, however, inspired him to sundry activities, and he spent much of his time among the cowboys, whom he found profitable to the point of mystery.  Mrs. Keap, the youthful chaperon, seemed likewise mastered by some private trouble, and puzzled her companions vaguely. Helen reported that she did not sleep, and once Jean found her crying softly. She seemed, moreover, to be apprehensive, in a tremulous, reasonless ways but when with friendly sympathy they brought the subject up, she dismissed it. In spite of secret tears, she had lent willing hands to the decoration of the gymnasium, and now nursed her swollen thumb with surprising good nature.  \"Shall we let them in?\" she inquired. \"We have done all we can.\"  \"Yes; we have finished.\"  In a flutter of anticipation Jean and Helen put the final touches to their task, while Mrs. Keap stepped to the door and called Speed.  He came at once, followed by Larry Glass, who, upon grasping the scheme of decoration, smote his brow and balanced dizzily upon his heels. Speed was lost in admiration.  \"Its wonderful!\" ejaculated the young athlete. \"Those college flags give it just the right touch. And see the cosey-corner!\"  Glass regained his voice sufficiently to murmur, sarcastically, \"Say, ain't this a swell-looking drum?\"  \"We've used every bit of bunting on the ranch,\" said Jean.  \"See the Mexican shawls!\" Mrs. Keap added.  \"And look,\" cried Miss Blake, \"I brought you my prayer-rug!\" She displayed a small Persian rug, worn and faded, evidently a thing of great age, at which Speed uttered an exclamation. \"I always carry it with me, and put it in front of my bed wherever I happen to be.\"  Berkeley Fresno, drawn by the irresistible magnetism of Miss Blake's presence, wandered in and ran his eyes over the room.  Speed took the rug and examined it curiously. \"It's an old-timer, isn't it? Must be one of the first settlers.\"  \"Yes. It's thousands and thousands of years old. Father picked it up somewhere in Asia.\"  \"How does it work?\" queried Glass, feeling of it gingerly.  \"It's a very holy thing,\" Helen explained. \"The Mohammedan stands on it facing the East and cries 'Allah!'\"  \"Alley!\" repeated the trainer. \"No. Allah!\"  \"'Allah' is the Mohammedan divinity,\" explained Speed.  \"I've got you.\" Glass was greatly interested.  \"Then he makes his prayer. It is such a sacred thing that when one's feet are on it no harm can come to one.\"  \"Well, what d'you think of that?\" murmured the trainer.  Fresno laughed pleasantly. \"It's too bad it isn't long enough to run this footrace on.\"  \"Do you believe in the charm?\" inquired Speed of Helen.  \"Of course I do,\" she answered.  He laughed sceptically, whereupon Larry Glass broke in with husky accents:  \"Nix on the comedy! I bet it's a wizard!\"  His employer gazed warmly at the owner of the priceless treasure, and, taking the rug tenderly, pressed his lips to it.  Fresno shook his head in disgust; the brazen methods of this person were unbearable.  \"Why all the colors?\" asked he. \"You can sing best where there is a piano. I can train best under the shadow of college emblems. I am a temperamental athlete.\"  \"You'll be a dead athlete if you don't beat this cook.\" The Californian was angry.  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed his rival, airily.  \"That's what I remarked. Did they tell you what happened to Humpy Joe, your predecessor?\"  \"It must have been an accident, judging from his name.\" At which Miss Blake tittered. She was growing to enjoy these passages at arms; they thrilled her vaguely.  \"The only accident connected with the affair was that Still Bill and Willie didn't have their guns.\"  Glass started nervously. \"Did these rummies want to shoot him?\" he inquired.  \"Certainly,\" said Fresno. \"He lost a foot-race.\"  In spite of his assurance, J. Wallingford Speed felt a tremor of anxiety, but he laughed it off, saying: \"One would think a foot- race in this country was a pearl necklace.\"  \"These cowboys ain't good losers, eh?\" queried Glass.  \"It's win or die out here.\"  During the ensuing pause Mrs. Keap took occasion to call Speed aside. \"I have something to contribute to the training-quarters if you will help me bring it out,\" said she.  The young man bowed. \"Most gladly.\"  \"We'll be back in a little while,\" the chaperon announced to the others, and a moment later, when she and Speed had reached the veranda of the house, she paused.  \"I--I want to speak to you,\" she began, hesitatingly. \"It was just an excuse.\"  Wally looked at her with concern, for it was plain that she was deeply troubled.  \"What is it?\"  \"I have been trying to get a word alone with you ever since I heard about this foot-race.\" The young man chilled with apprehension as Mrs. Keap turned her dark eyes upon him searchingly.  \"Why do you want to run?\"  \"To win back the cowboys' treasure. My heart is touched,\" he declared, boldly. Mrs. Keap smiled.  \"I believe the latter, but are you sure you can win?\"  \"Abso-blooming-lutely.\"  \"I didn't know you were a sprinter.\"  Speed shrugged his shoulders.  \"Have you had experience?\"  \"Oceans of it!\"  Mrs. Keap mused for a moment. \"Tell me,\" said she, finally, \"at what intercollegiate game did you run last?\"  \"I didn't run last; I ran first.\" It was impossible to resent the boy's smile.  \"Then at what game did you last run? I hope I'm not too curious?\"  \"Oh no, not at all!\" Speed stammered.  \"Or, if it is easier, at what college games did you first run?\" Mrs. Keap was laughing openly now.  \"Why the clear, ringing, rippling laughter?\" asked the young man, to cover his confusion.  \"Because I think it is very funny.\"  \"Oh, you do!\" Speed took refuge behind an attitude of unbending dignity, but the young widow would have none of it.  \"I know all about you,\" said she. \"You are a very wonderful person, of course; you are a delightful fellow at a house-party, and a most suitable individual generally, but you are not an athlete, in spite of those beautiful clothes in your trunk.\"  \"Who told you?\"  \"Culver Covington.\"  \"I didn't know you two were acquainted.\"  Mrs. Keap flushed. \"He told me all about you long ago. You wear all the athletic clothes, you know all the talk, you have tried to make the team a dozen times, but you are not even a substitute. You are merely the Varsity cheer-leader. Culver calls you 'the head-yeller.'\"  \"Columbus has discovered our continent!\" said Speed. \"You are a very wise chaperon, and you must have a corking memory for names, but even a head-yeller is better than a glee-club quarter-back.\" He nodded toward the bunk-house, whence they had come. \"You haven't told anybody?\"  \"Not yet.\"  \"'Yet,'\" he quoted. \"The futurity implied in that word disturbs me. Suppose you and I keep it for a little secret? Secrets are very delightful at house-parties.\"  \"Don't you consider your action deceitful?\"  \"Not at all. My motto is 'We strive to please.'\"  \"Think of Helen.\"  \"That's it; I can't think of anything else! She's mad about athletics, and I had to do something to stand off this weight- lifting tenor.\"  \"Is it any wonder a woman distrusts every man she meets?\" mused the chaperon. \"Helen might forgive you, I couldn't.\"  \"Oh, it's not that bad. I know what I'm doing.\"  \"You will cause these cowboys to lose a lot more money.\"  \"Not at all. When Culver arrives--\"  \"Oh, that is what I want to talk over with you,\" Mrs. Keap broke in, nervously.  \"Then it isn't about the foot-race? You are not angry?\" Speed brightened amazingly.  \"I'm not exactly angry; I'm surprised and grieved. Of course, I can't forgive deceit--I dare say I am more particular than most people.\"  \"But you won't tell?\" Mrs. Keap indicated in some subtle manner that she was not above making terms, whereupon her companion declared, warmly: \"I'm yours for life! Ask me for my watch, my right eye, anything! I'll give it to you!\"  \"I assure you I sha'n't ask anything so important as that, but I _shall_ ask a favor.\"  \"Name it and it is yours!\" Speed wrung the hand she offered.  \"And perhaps I can do more than keep silent--although I don't see what good it will do. Perhaps I can help your suit.\"  \"Gracious lady, all I ask is that you thrust out your foot and trip up Berkeley Fresno whenever he"]]]
