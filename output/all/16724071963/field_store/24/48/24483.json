Then there followed so much talk, while no one knew scarcely what was saying; and it was Mr. Walton, chiefly, that told how Fanny's father had had so much to struggle against, and so much hardship to go through, but how he had succeeded at last, and got on very well; now he had tried then to find out Mrs. Newton and his dear little Fanny, but could not, because Mrs. Newton had changed her abode; how, at last, he had met with a good opportunity to sell his land, and had now come over with the money he had earned, to find his child, and repay her kind benefactor.  Oh, what a happy evening was that in the widow's cottage! the widow's heart sang for joy. The widow, and she that had always thought herself an orphan, were ready to sing together--    \"Mortals flee from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow.\"  Mrs. Newton found that Mr. Marsden, that was the name of Fanny's father, was all that she could desire Fanny's father to be:--a Christian in deed and in truth; one thankful to God and to her, for the preservation and care of his child; and who would not willingly separate Fanny from her, or let her leave Fanny.  As he found Mrs. Newton did not wish to leave kind Mr. Walton's neighborhood, and that his daughter was attached to it also, Mr. Marsden took some land and a nice farm-house, not far from the Manor House, where Mr. Walton lived. He had heard all about the half-sovereign, and loved his little flower-girl before he saw her.  So Mrs. Newton had to leave her widow's house; and she shed tears of joy, and regret, and thankfulness, as she did so; she had been happy there, and had had God's blessing upon her and her dear girl.  But Fanny was glad to receive her dear, dear grandmother into her own father's house; her own house too; and she threw her arms round the old lady's neck, when they got there, and kissed her over and over again, and said, \"Ah! grandmother, do you recollect when I was a little girl tying up my flowers while you lay sick in bed, I used to say so often--    \"'Mortals flee from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow.'\"  They had a large garden at the farm-house, and Fanny and Mrs. Newton improved it; and Mrs. Newton would walk out, leaning on Fanny's arm, and look at the lilies and roses, and jessamine, and mignonette, and talk of past times, and of their first garden, and their first flowers, and of their first knowledge of the God who made them; who watches the opening bud, and the infant head; who sends his rain upon the plant, and the dew of his blessing upon the child who is taught to know and love Him. And Fanny's father, when he joined them, talked over his trials and dangers from the day that his poor wife lay dead, and his helpless baby lay in his arms, and then he blessed the God who had led him all his life long, and crowned him with loving-kindness.  Three years passed, and Fanny, the little flower-girl, was a fine young woman. A farmer's son in the neighborhood wished to get her for his wife; but her father was very sorry to think of her leaving him so soon for another home.  He spoke to Fanny about it, and said,--\"My dear girl, I have no right to expect you should wish to stay with me, for I never was able to watch over your childhood or to act a father's part by you.\"  And Fanny answered, with a blush and smile, \"And I, father, was never able to act a daughter's part by you until now, and therefore I think you have every right to expect I should do so for some time longer. I have no objections to be Charles Brierley's wife, and I have told him so; but we are both young, and at all events I will not leave you.\"  \"Now,\" said Mrs. Newton, who was sitting by, \"instead of that young man taking more land, which is very dear about here, would it not be a good plan if he were to come and live with you, Mr. Marsden, and help you with the farm.\"  And Mr. Marsden said, \"That is the very thing; I will go and speak to him about it; and Fanny and her husband can have the house, and farm, and all, as much as they please now, and entirely at my death.\"  So it was all settled; and Fanny was married at the village church, and Mr. and Mrs. Walton were at the wedding. Good Mrs. Newton lived on at the farm-house, and when Fanny's first child was born, it was put into her arms. Then she thought of the time when Fanny herself was laid in the same arms; and she blessed God in her heart, who had enabled her to be of use to one human creature, and to one immortal soul and mind, while she passed through this life to the life everlasting.  Joy and sorrow are always mingled on this earth; so it came to pass that before Fanny's first child could walk alone, good, kind Mrs. Newton died, and was buried. As a shock of corn cometh in, in its season, so she sank to rest, and was gathered into the garner of her Lord. But--    \"The memory of the just   Is blessed, though they sleep in dust;\"  and Fanny's children, and children's children, will learn to love that memory.  Many a day, sitting at work in her garden, with her little ones around her, Fanny let them gather some flowers, and talk to her about them; and then they would beg, as a reward for good conduct, that she would tell them about her dear grandmother and her own childish days; and much as children love to hear stories, never did any more delight in a story, than did these children, in the story of Fanny, the Flower-Girl.     Convenient Food.   Little Frances was crying; her sister Mary hearing her sobs, ran in haste to inquire what had happened; and saw her sitting in a corner of the nursery, looking rather sulky, as if she had recently received some disappointment.  \"What is the matter, dear little Frances? why do you cry so?\"  Frances pouted, and would make no reply.  \"Tell me, dear Frances; perhaps I can do something for you.\"  \"Nothing, Mary,\" she sobbed, \"only\"--  \"Only what, little Frances? It cannot be _nothing_ that makes you cry so bitterly.\"  \"Only mamma would not give--\" she looked a little ashamed, and did not finish her sentence.  \"_What_ would she not give?\"  \"Nothing.\"  \"Nothing!\" Frances shook her elbows, as if troubled by Mary's inquiries, but the tears continued flowing down her cheeks.  Just at that moment their sister Anne came into the room, singing in the joy of her heart, with a piece of plum-cake in her hand, holding it up, and turning it about before her sisters to exhibit her newly-acquired possession, on which Frances fixed her eyes with eager gaze, and the tears flowed still faster, accompanied with a kind of angry sob.  \"Frances! what is the matter that you are crying so? see what I have got! you will spoil all the happiness of our feast.\"   At the word _feast_, Frances' tears seemed arrested, and her mouth looked as if she were going to smile. She left the corner, and immediately prepared to do her part for the feast, setting a little square table, and then, drawing her own little stool, seated herself in readiness as a guest.  \"Stay,\" said Anne, \"we will make some little paper dishes and plates, and divide the cake;\" so saying, she began the operation, and laying down the paper dishes, \"there at the top, see! there shall be two chickens, at the bottom a piece of beef, at one side some potatoes, and at the other some cauliflower;\" breaking her cake into small pieces to correspond to her imagined provision.  Frances looked very impatient at the long preparation, and as Anne seated herself, inviting Mary to partake, Frances stretched out her hand to take the beef for her own portion.  \"No, no, Frances, you must not help yourself, you know; wait until we all begin in order.\"  Frances very reluctantly withdrew her hand, and, whilst she waited, betrayed her impatience by a little jerking motion of the body, that threw her breast against the table, as if she would beat time into quicker motion.  \"O we must not forget William!\" Anne exclaimed; \"where is he? he must taste our feast; stay here, Mary, with Frances, and I will go and find him.\"  Away she ran, and left poor Frances in a fret at this additional delay, but she began to amuse herself by picking up the small crumbs that had been scattered on the stool, and at last proceeded to touch the beef and chickens.  \"Do not do so, Frances,\" Mary said, in a reproving voice.  Frances colored.  \"Do not sit _looking_ on, if you are so impatient; employ yourself, and get a seat ready for William.\"  \"_You_ may get it, Mary.\"  \"Very well; only do not meddle with Anne's feast.\"  Mary had to go into another room for the seat, and whilst she was away, Frances quickly helped herself to half of the pieces which were on the dishes, and, when Mary returned, resumed her position as if nothing had happened. Mary was so busy in arranging the seats, that she did not observe what had been done.  Presently Anne came back, accompanied by her brother William; hastening to her place, and looking on her table, she started with surprise, and seemed to say to herself, as she gazed, How came I to make a mistake, an think my pieces of cake were larger? but the expression of her face called Mary's attention, who at once said,  \"Anne, I am sure you placed larger pieces on your dishes.\"  \"Indeed, I thought so, Mary; who has taken any?\"  \"I do not know.\"  \"O you are only _pretending_, and you have been hiding some.\"  \"No, Anne; I would not have said I do not know, if I had _hid_ it.\"  \"No, no more you would, dear Mary. Never mind,\" she said, glancing a look at Frances, not altogether without suspicion, \"it is only to _play_ with, it does not signify whether it is much or little.  \"William, shall I help you to a little chicken?\"  \"O no, Anne, you have forgot, help the _ladies_ first; and beside, you ought to have placed me at the bottom of the table to carve this dish. What is it?\"  \"Beef, William.\"  \"O beef, very well. Come, Miss Frances, let me sit there, and you come "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6757"],["title","Fanny, the Flower-Girl; or, Honesty Rewarded.

If this is not being greedy, I do not know what greedy means. It is no names, it is only saying what a thing is.\"  \"Now I know another thing,\" said Anne; \"when mamma called me to receive my piece of cake, she said, 'And you shall take a piece also to Mary,' but when she unfolded the paper, there was only _one_ piece; mamma did not say anything, but I think she _thought_ something.\"  At this remark, Frances redoubled her crying, but, for the sake of a share of the present feast, did not attempt to leave the party. No more was said, and the feast was concluded in good humor by all except the conscious greedy girl, and they then all went into the garden together to finish their hour's recreation before they were called again to their lessons.  There was a little plantation of young fir-trees at one corner of the garden, intended to grow there for shelter from the north-west wind: the grass was so high amongst them, that the gardener had orders to go and carefully mow it down. He was engaged in the business when the children ran out to see him work.  \"Hush! hush!\" he exclaimed, as they approached, \"I have just cleared a bough from the grass, and see what's there!\"  All curiosity, they went forward on tip-toe, and were directed to something lodged on the spreading branch of a young larch.  \"A bird's nest!\" said William.  \"A bird's nest!\" they all repeated. \"But what is in it, I cannot tell.\"  \"Look steadily,\" said the gardener, \"and you will find out.\"  It was difficult to trace what it was; something all in a heap, brown naked skin; alive, as might be known by the heaving breathing. William putting his finger to touch them, immediately four wide mouths stretched open, with little tongues raised, and the opening of their throats extended to the utmost.  \"Look at the little things,\" said William; \"they thought their mother was come when I touched the branch, and they have opened their mouths to be ready to receive what she would put in.  \"They are _blind_!\" said William.  \"Yes, they cannot have been hatched more than two days.\"  \"Will they take what the mother gives them?\" asked William.  \"Yes,\" said the man, \"they trust her, and swallow down what she puts into their mouths.\"  \"I wish the mother would come,\" said Anne.  \"But she will not whilst we are here,\" William replied.  \"Touch it again, William,\" said Frances.  William touched the edge of the nest \"See!\" said he, \"they think the mother is come, they stretch, their months still wider.\"  \"Hark!\" said Mary, \"what an impatient noise they make: they look ready to stretch themselves out of their nest, and as if their little mouths would tear.\"  \"Poor little things! do not disappoint them, give them something,\" said Anne.  \"We have not proper food for them,\" said William.  \"I will run and fetch some crumbs,\" said Mary.  Mary soon returned with a piece of bread, and giving it to her brother as the most experienced, he broke it into extremely small crumbs, and, again touching the nest, awakened the expectation of the young birds: they opened their mouths wide, and as he dropped a small crumb into each, they moved their tongues, trying to make it pass down into their throat. \"Poor little things, they cannot swallow well, they want the mother to put it gently down their throat with her beak.\"  \"See! see!\" said all the girls, \"they want more, give them more.\"  William dropped his crumbs again.  \"More, more, William; see! they are not satisfied.\"  \"I dare not give them more for fear of killing them, we cannot feed them like the mother. We will stand still at a little distance, and you will see them go to sleep.\" When all was quiet, the little nestlings shut their mouths, and dropped their heads.  \"I should like to see the mother feed them.\"  \"You would see how much better she would do it than we can; perhaps, if we could conceal ourselves behind that laurel, she would come, but she will be very frightened, because all is so altered now the grass is cut down, and her nest is exposed; but I dare say she is not for off, she will be watching somewhere.\"  They took William's hint, and retreated behind the laurel; they had not waited ten minutes, before the hen bird flitted past, and, darting over the larch, as if to inspect whether her little brood was safe, she disappeared again. In a few minutes more, she returned, skimming round to reconnoitre that all was safe, she perched upon the nest. Instantly the little nestlings were awake to the summons of her touch and chirp, and, opening their mouths wide, were ready for what she would give. She dropt a small fly into the mouth of one of them, and, having no more, flew away to provide for the other hungry mouths as fast as she could. As soon as she was gone, they again shut their mouths, and dropt their heads in silence.  \"What a little bit she gave them,\" said Frances.  \"Yes,\" answered William, \"but she knows it is _plenty_.\"  \"How contented the others seem to wait till she comes again!\"  \"Yes, Mary,\" William again answered, unable to resist the comparison which had come to his mind, \"they did not take the little bit away from the other. Shall we wait till she comes again?\"  \"O do.\"  \"Very well, I want to see whether the one that was fed first will take away the bit the others got.\"  The allusion made a little laugh, but, seeing that Frances understood and felt that it applied to her, Anne said, \"Do not let us tease Frances; it is better to tell her at once what her fault is, than to seem to like to hurt her.\"  \"Indeed, dear Anne, I have not spared to tell her, her fault, as she knows very well, for she has often given me reason, but I cannot make her ashamed of such things; and I know mamma is very uneasy to see it in her.\"  Frances looked grave, but did not cry; turning pale, however, she said, \"O Mary take me out of this laurel--I am so sick!\"  Mary hastened to take her into the freer air, but all in vain. The sisters were alarmed, and took her in to their mamma; who received her gravely, without expressing any concern for her indisposition.  \"What can we do for Frances, mamma? Will you let her have your smelling bottle, or shall I run and get some sal volatile?\"  \"Neither, my dear Mary; it is an indisposition caused by her own selfish appetite, and probably the relief may be obtained by her stomach rejecting what she so improperly forced upon it. We will wait a short time, and if not, I will give her something less palatable, perhaps, than plum-cake, but necessary to remove it.\"  Frances was too ill to make any remark; she became paler still, and then quickly flushed almost a crimson color, her eyes were oppressed, and her eyebrows contracted, and she impatiently complained,  \"O my head! how it beats! What shall I do, mamma?\"  \"Bear the consequences of your own inordinate appetite, Frances, and learn to subject it to the wholesome rules of temperance.\"  \"O the nasty plum-cake! I wish you had not given me any, mamma.\"  \"You _once_ thought the plum-cake _nice_, and you would not be contented with the small portion I knew to be sufficient and safe for you.\"  \"O my head! I think it is very cruel, mamma, that you do not pity me.\"  \"I do pity you, Frances, and will take care of you now that I see you require help, as I perceive that you will not have any relief without medicine.\"  Frances began again to cry, \"O, I am so sick! I cannot take medicine. I am sure I cannot.\"  \"Come to your room, Frances; I shall give you something proper, and you had better lie down after you have taken it; you will, perhaps, drop into a sleep, and be well when you awake again.\" Her mamma took her hand and led her up stairs, and Frances knew very well it was in vain to make any objection, as her mamma always made a point of obedience. The medicine was administered, although for some time Frances refused to look at it. When she laid down, her mamma placed the pillow high under her head, and, drawing the curtain to shade the light, left the room that she might be perfectly quiet. And when she returned to the drawing-room, she inquired of the other children what they had been doing, and received a full account of the feast, and the bird's nest, and all the little circumstances of each.  It was time to resume their studies, and, except that Frances was not in her usual place, all things proceeded as before. When the lessons were finished, they entreated their mamma to go with them, and see the bird's nest.\"  \"It is _so_ pretty, mamma!\" said Anne; \"and they know when the mother comes, and they take what she puts into their mouths.\"  \"We will first inquire after Frances,\" she answered; \"if she is well enough, she can accompany us.\"  \"I will run up, if you will be putting on your bonnet and shawl, mamma.\"  \"Very well, I hope you will find her recovered, we will wait your return.\"  Anne soon returned,--\"She is gone! I do not see her anywhere!\"  \"Gone! In perhaps we shall find her at play in the garden.\"  In this expectation they all went out, and as they drew near"]]]
