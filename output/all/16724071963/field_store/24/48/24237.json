As if the music had been powerless to express her wild delirium, she threw the guitar aside, and half rising from the couch and extending her arms toward the door, she repeated, in an expiring, languishing voice,    \"Oh! come, come, come!\"  To paint the electric look with which she accompanied these words would he impossible.  Jacques Ferrand uttered a terrible cry.  \"O! death--death to him you love so much, to whom you have addressed these words!\" cried he, shaking the door in a transport of jealousy.  Active as a tigress, with one bound Cecily was at the wicket, and, as if she had with difficulty dispelled her feigned transports, she said to Jacques Ferrand, in a low, palpitating voice: \"Well! I avow I did not wish to return to the door. I am here in spite of myself; for I fear your words spoken just now. _If you say strike--I will strike._ You love me well, then?\"  \"Do you wish gold--all my gold?\"  \"No; I have enough.\"  \"Have you an enemy? I'll kill him.\"  \"I have no enemy.\"  \"Will you be my wife? I will espouse you.\"  \"I am married.\"  \"But what do you wish, then! what _do_ you wish?\"  \"Prove to me that your passion for me is blind, furious, that you will sacrifice everything for me!\"  \"All! yes, all! But how?\"  \"I do not know; but there was a moment when the glance of your eye bewildered me. If now you give me some proof of your love, I do not know of what I should be capable! Hasten! I am capricious; to-morrow the impression of this hour will perhaps be effaced.\"  \"But what proof can I give you on the moment?\" cried the wretch. \"It is an atrocious torment! What proof? speak! What proof?\"  \"You are only a fool!\" answered Cecily, retreating from the wicket with an appearance of extreme irritation. \"I am mistaken! I thought you capable of energetic devotion! Good-night. It is a pity--\"  \"Cecily! oh! do not go--return. But what must I do? tell me, at least. Oh! my senses wander. What must I do? what do?\"  \"Guess!\"  \"But, in fine--speak! what do you wish?\" cried the notary, quite beside himself.  \"Guess.\"  \"Explain--command.\"  \"Ah! if you love me as passionately as you say, you will find the means. Good-night.\"  \"Cecily!\"  \"I am going to shut this wicket--instead of opening the door--\"  \"Mercy! listen--remain--I have found it,\" cried Jacques Ferrand, after a moment's pause, with an expression of joy impossible to describe. The wretch was seized with a vertigo. He lost all prudence, all reserve; the instinct of moral preservation abandoned him.  \"Well! this proof of your love?\" said the Creole: who, having approached the chimney, took hold of her knife, and returned slowly toward the wicket.  Then, without being seen by the notary, she assured herself of the action of a small chain, one end of which was fastened to the door, the other to the door-post.  \"Listen,\" said Jacques Ferrand, in a hoarse and broken voice; \"listen. If I place my honor, my fortune, my life, at your mercy--here--on the spot--will you then believe I love you? This proof of an insane passion, will it suffice?\"  \"Your honor, your fortune, your life? I do not comprehend.\"  \"If I confide to you a secret which would place me on the scaffold?\"  \"You a criminal? You jest. And your austerity?\"  \"A lie.\"  \"Your probity?\"  \"A lie.\"  \"Your piety?\"  \"A lie.\"  \"You pass for a saint, and you would be a demon! You are a boaster! No; there is no man quite cunning enough, bold enough, thus to insinuate himself into the confidence and respect of men. It would be a frightful defiance cast in the face of society.\"  \"I am this man! I have thrown this taunt, this defiance, in the teeth of society!\" cried the monster, in an access of frightful pride.  \"Jacques! Jacques! do not speak thus,\" said Cecily. \"You will make me mad!\"  \"My head for your love--do you wish it?\"  \"Oh! this is love, indeed!\" cried Cecily. \"Here--take my poniard; you disarm me.\"  Jacques Ferrand took, through the wicket the dangerous weapon with precaution, and threw it from him into the corridor.  \"Verily--you believe me, then?\" cried he, in transport.  \"I believe you?\" said the Creole, leaning with force her charming hands on those of Jacques Ferrand. \"Yes, I believe you; for I see again your look of just now--that look which fascinated me. Your eyes sparkle with savage ardor; Jacques, I love your eyes!\"  \"Cecily!\"  \"You should speak the truth.\"  \"I speak the truth! Oh! you shall see.\"  \"Your countenance is lowering. Your expression formidable. Hold, you are as fearful and beautiful as a mad tiger. But you speak the truth, do you not?\"  \"I have committed crimes, I tell you.\"  \"So much the better, if by their avowal you prove your love.\"  \"And if I tell you all?\"  \"I grant all; for if you have this blind confidence in me--do you see, Jacques--it will no longer be the ideal lover of the song I call. It is to you, my tiger, you, that I shall say come--come--come.\"  \"Oh, you will be mine. I shall be your tiger,\" cried he; \"and then, if you will, you shall dishonor me--my head shall fall. My honor, my life, all is yours now,\"  \"Your honor?\"  \"My honor! Listen; ten years since an infant was confided to my care, and two hundred thousand francs for its support; I have abandoned this child. I spread the report the child was dead, and I kept the money.\"  \"It was bold and skillful--who would have thought it of you?\"  \"Listen again: I hated my cashier, François Germain. One night he took from me a little gold, which he returned the next day; but to ruin him, I accused him of having robbed me of a considerable sum. I was believed, he was thrown into prison. Now my honor is at your mercy.\"  \"Oh, you love me, Jacques, you love me. To inform me thus of your secrets--what empire I must have over you! I will not be ungrateful; let me kiss this forehead, where so many infernal thoughts were created.\"  \"Oh!\" cried the notary, stammering, \"if the scaffold stood there, ready, I would not draw back. Listen again: this child, Fleur-de-Marie, once abandoned, crosses my path--she inspires me with fears; I have had her killed!\"  \"You? How? where?\"  \"A few days since--near Asnières Bridge, by Ravageurs' Island. One named Martial drowned her in a boat. Are these details sufficient? do you believe me?\"  \"Oh! demon from hell: you alarm, yet attract me. You inspire me. What is, then, your power?\"  \"Listen again: before that a man had confided to me a hundred thousand crowns. I set a trap for him. I blew his brains out. I proved that he committed suicide, and I denied the deposit which his sister the Baroness de Fermont reclaimed. Now my life is at your mercy--open.\"  \"Jacques, I adore you!\" said the Creole, with warmth.  \"Oh! come a thousand deaths, and I'd dare them!\" cried the notary, in an intoxication impossible to describe. \"Yes, you are right; were I young and charming, I should not experience this triumphant joy. The key! throw me the key! draw the bolt!\"  The Creole took the key from the lock, and handed it to the notary through the wicket, saying, \"Jacques, I am mad!\"  \"You are mine, at length!\" cried he, with a savage roar, turning the key in the lock. But the door, fastened with a bolt, did not open.  \"Come, my tiger! come,\" said Cecily, in an expiring voice.  \"The bolt! the bolt!\" cried Jacques Ferrand.  \"But, if you deceive me,\" cried the Creole, suddenly, \"if these secrets are an invention, to cajole me---\"  The notary remained for a moment, struck with stupor; he thought he had succeeded: this last difficulty raised his impatient fury to its climax.  He thrust his hand quickly in his bosom, opened his waistcoat, broke with violence a small chain of steel, to which was suspended a small, thin pocket-book, took it, and showing it through the wicket to Cecily, he said, in an oppressed and breathless tone,  \"Here is what would cause my head to fall! draw the bolt--the book is yours.\"  \"Give it to me, my tiger,\" cried Cecily.  And hastily drawing the bolt with one hand, with the other she seized the book.  But Jacques Ferrand did not abandon it until the moment he felt the door yielding to his efforts.  But though the door yielded, it was only for about six inches, confined, as it was, by the chain above mentioned. At this unforeseen obstacle, Jacques Ferrand threw himself against the door, and shook it with a desperate effort. Cecily, with the rapidity of thought, put the wallet between her teeth, opened the window, threw a cloak into the court, and with great dexterity making use of a cord previously fastened to the balcony, she let herself down into the court, as rapidly and lightly as an arrow falls to the ground.  Then, wrapping herself up in haste in the mantle, she ran to the porter's lodge, opened it, drew the bolt, went out into the street, and jumped into a carriage, which, since her residence at Jacques Ferrand's, was sent every night by order of Baron de Graun, stationed not twenty steps from the notary's mansion.  This carriage was quickly driven off, drawn by two stout horses. It reached the boulevard before Jacques Ferrand had perceived the flight of Cecily. Let us return to this monster.  Through the opening of the door it was impossible for him to see the window by which the Creole escaped. With one mighty effort with his broad shoulders, he burst the chain which confined the door, and rushed into the chamber, and found no one.  The cord waved in the wind, as he leaned from the balcony. Then, from the other side of the court, by the light of the moon, which burst forth at intervals from the driving clouds, he saw the gate open.  In a moment he divined everything. A last ray of hope remained.  Vigorous and determined, he sprang over the balcony, using the cord in his turn, lowered himself into the court, and rushed out of the house. The street was deserted--he was alone.  He heard no other noise than the distant rolling of the carriage which was rapidly carrying off the Creole. The notary thought it was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6448"],["title","Mysteries of Paris — Volume 03 (#8)"],["body"," belated vehicle, and attached no importance to this circumstance.  Thus, for him no chance remained of finding Cecily, who carried off with her the proofs of his crimes!!!  On this frightful certainty, he fell, thunderstruck, on his own threshold.  He remained there a long time, dumb, immovable, petrified. With wan eyes, his teeth compressed, his mouth foaming, tearing mechanically with his nails his breast, he felt his reason totter, and was lost in an abyss of darkness. When he awoke from his stupor, he walked heavily, and with an ill-assured step; objects trembled in his sight; he felt as if recovering from a fit of intoxication.  He shut with violence the street door, and re-entered the court. The rain had ceased, but the wind continued to blow with violence, chasing the heavy laden clouds, which veiled, without concealing, the light of the moon.  Slightly calmed by the brisk and cold air of the night, Ferrand, hoping to combat his internal agitation by the rapidity of his walk, plunged into the obscure walks of his garden, marching with rapid strides, and from time to time striking his forehead with his clinched fists.  Walking thus at hazard, he reached the end of a walk near a greenhouse in ruins. Suddenly he stumbled violently over a mound of earth newly raised. He stooped, and looked mechanically on some linen stained with blood.  He was near the grave where Louise Morel buried her dead child. Her child--also the child of Jacques Ferrand! Notwithstanding his obduracy, notwithstanding the frightful fears which agitated him, Jacques Ferrand shuddered with alarm.  There was something supernatural in this stumbling-block. Pursued by the avenging punishment of his _vice_, chance carried him to the grave of his child--unhappy fruit of his violence. Under any other circumstances, Jacques Ferrand would have trampled on this sepulcher with atrocious indifference; but having exhausted his savage energy in the scene we have related, he was seized with a weakness and sudden alarm. His face was covered with an icy sweat, his trembling knees shook under him, and he fell lifeless across this open grave.     CHAPTER III.  LA FORCE.   The interior of a prison is a frightful pandemonium--a sad _thermometer_ of the state of society, and an instructive study.  In a word, the varied physiognomies of all classes of prisoners, the relations of family or affection which connects them still to the world, from which the prison walls separate them, have appeared to us worthy of regard.  The reader will, then, excuse us for having grouped around several of the prisoners personages to be known in this tale, and other secondary figures, destined to place in active relief certain critical events necessary to complete this initiation into prison life. Let us enter La Force.  There is nothing gloomy, nothing sinister in the aspect of this house of detention.  In the middle of one of the first courts are to be seen some mounds of earth, planted with shrubbery, at the foot of which are already shooting forth some precocious cowslips and snowdrops; a trellised doorway leads to one of the seven or eight exercise-grounds destined for the prisoners.  The vast buildings surrounding this court resemble much a barrack or manufactory, kept with extreme neatness. They are built of limestone, with lofty windows, in order to allow a free circulation of air. The steps and pavement of the yard are of scrupulous cleanliness. On the ground-floor, vast halls, heated during winter, and well aired during summer, serve during the day as a place for conversation, workshops, or refectories. The upper stories are used as immense sleeping apartments, ten or twelve feet in height, with shining floors; they are furnished with two rows of iron bedsteads, excellent beds, composed of a soft thick mattress, a bolster, sheets of white linen, and a warm woolen covering.  At the sight of these accommodations, uniting all the requisites of comfort and salubrity, a stranger is much surprised, accustomed as he is to suppose all prisons as sorrowful, dirty, unhealthy, and gloomy. He is mistaken.  Sad, dirty, and gloomy are the holes where so many poor and honest workmen languish exhausted, forced to abandon their beds to their infirm wives, and to leave with powerless despair their half-starving, naked children, struggling with the cold, in the infectious straw.  There is some contrast between the physiognomies of the inhabitants of these two dwellings. Incessantly occupied with the wants of his family, to whom the day is hardly long enough, seeing a mad perversity reducing his salary, the artisan will be cast down and worn out; the hour of repose will not be sound to him; a kind of sleep like lassitude alone interrupts his daily toil. Then, on awaking from this mournful drowsiness, he will find himself overwhelmed with the same racking thoughts of the present, with the same inquietudes for the morrow.  But if, hardened by vice, indifferent to the past, happy with the present, certain of the future (he can assure himself of it by an offense or crime), regretting his liberty without doubt, but finding large compensation in the personal well-being he enjoys, certain to carry away with him on his release a good sum of money, gained by moderate and easy labor, esteemed, or, may be, feared by his companions, either for his impudence or perversity, the convict, on the contrary, will be almost always careless and gay. Once more; what does he want?  Does he not find in prison good shelter, good bed, good food, good pay, easy labor, and above all and before all, _a society to his taste_, a society, let us repeat, which measures his merit by the magnitude of his offenses?  A hardened criminal, then, knows neither poverty, hunger, nor cold. What matters to him the horror he inspires in honest men? He does not see them--he knows none.  His crimes are his glory, influence, and strength with the bandits among whom he will henceforth pass his life. How can he fear shame?  Instead of grave and charitable remonstrances, which might force him to blush and to repent, he hears savage plaudits, which encourage him to robbery and murder, Scarcely imprisoned, he meditates new misdeeds. What is more logical?  If he is discovered, arrested anew, he will find repose, the personal care of the prison, and his joyous and bold companions in crime and debauchery.  Is his corruption less great than that of the others? does he manifest, on the contrary, the slightest remorse that he is exposed to atrocious railings, infernal shouts, terrible threats?  In fine--a thing so rare that it has become an exception to the rule--should a condemned man come out of this frightful pandemonium with a firm resolution to reform by prodigies of labor, courage, patience, and honesty, and be able to conceal his past offenses, a meeting with one of his old prison companions would be sufficient to overturn his plan of reformation so carefully designed. In this way:  A hardened ticket-of-leave proposes a job to a repentant one; the latter, in spite of dangerous threats, refuses the criminal association; immediately an anonymous communication strips the veil from the past life of this unfortunate, who wishes, at any sacrifice, to conceal and expiate a first fault by honorable conduct.  Then, exposed to the contempt, or, at least, the suspicion of those whose interest he had obtained by force of industry and probity, reduced to distress, soured by injustice, carried away by want, yielding, in fine, to these fatal derelictions, this man, almost restored, falls back again, and forever, to the bottom of the abyss from whence he had with so much difficulty escaped.  In the following scenes we shall endeavor, then, to show the monstrous and inevitable consequences of promiscuous confinement.  After ages of barbarous proofs and pernicious doubts, it begins to be understood how unreasonable it is to plunge into an atmosphere abominably vitiated, people whom a pure and salubrious air might have saved.  How much time shall be required to find out that, to associate gangrened beings is to redouble the intensity of their corruption, which thus becomes incurable?  How long to find out that there is but one remedy to this growing leprosy, which threatens the body social, Solitary confinement?  We should esteem ourselves happy if our feeble voice could be, if not counted, at least heard, among all those which, more imposing, more eloquent than ours, demand, with so just and so impatient an importunity, the complete, absolute adoption of the _solitary system_.  Some day, also, perhaps, society will know that evil is an accidental, not organic malady; that criminals are almost always good in substance, but false and wicked through ignorance, selfishness, or negligence of those governing; and that the health of the soul, like that of the body, is invincibly subordinate to the laws of a \"hygiene\" at once salubrious and preservative.  God gives to all, along with healthy organs, energetic appetites, and the desire of comfort; it is for society to modify and satisfy these wants.  The man who only has as his share strength, good-will, and health, has the _right_, sovereign _right_ to a labor justly remunerated, which will assure him, not the superfluities, but the necessaries of life, the means to be healthy and robust, active and industrious, therefore honest and virtuous, because his condition will be happy.  The dismal regions of misery and ignorance are peopled with beings of sorrowful hearts. Cleanse these sewers, spread there the inclination to labor, equitable salaries, just rewards, and soon these sickly faces, these broken hearts, will be brought back to virtue, which is the life and health of the soul.  We will conduct the reader to the visitors' room of the prison. It is an obscure apartment, separated down its whole length into two equal parts by a narrow, railed passage. One part communicates with the interior, destined for the"]]]
