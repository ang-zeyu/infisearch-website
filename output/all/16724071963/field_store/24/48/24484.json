But what was his grief to see one of the little birds dead on the ground, two others in the nest with pieces of bread sticking in their mouths, gasping, unable to swallow or reject it, and the fourth with its crop gorged, and slowly moving its little unfledged head from side to side, struggling in death.  Full of sympathy with the little sufferer, and indignant with Frances, he exclaimed, \"Provoking girl! she has stuffed the little creatures as she would like to stuff herself; and I believe she has killed them all.\"  The lively interest the other children had in the nest, impelled them to hasten to the spot, and their lamentations, and even tears, soon flowed.  \"William, William, cannot you do anything for them? do try.\"  \"Well, stand still and do not shake my arm--so saying, he began the attempt, and drew the bread carefully out of the distended mouths of the two.  \"Now the other! the other, William!\"  \"That I cannot help,\" he answered: \"see! she has forced it down, and we cannot get it back again; it is dying now.\"  Anne picked up the dead one from off the ground, and stroking it with her forefinger, \"Poor little thing!\" she said, \"was she so cruel to you!\"  It was not long before they heard a rustling in the tree near the place, and then a chirp of fright and distress. \"Ah!\" said their mamma, \"there is the mother! poor things, we will go a little distance to let her come to the nest; perhaps she will be able to save the two.\"  They all withdrew, and the little parent bird was soon on her nest, fluttering and chirping to awaken the dead and dying little ones, till at length she sorrowfully brooded down on her nest, and spread her wings over them, occasionally chirping as if to solicit an answer from her little brood.  \"Oh!\" said Mary, bursting into tears, \"I cannot bear it! cruel Frances, to be so unkind to the little birds!\"  \"Go and find Frances,\" said their mamma, \"and bring her to me.\"  \"I will go,\" William answered, \"I think I know where she will hide herself.\"  It was not long before William returned, leading Frances, who very reluctantly yielded to accompany him.  \"Come here,\" said her mamma, stopping the accusations she saw were ready to overwhelm the offending little girl; \"come here, and let me talk to you about this sad thing you have done to the little birds. Do you see what you have done by your ill-judged kindness?\"  \"Kindness! mamma,\" they all exclaimed.  \"Yes, dear children, she has been very faulty, but I believe she meant to be kind, and through ignorance did this thing which proves the death of the birds. _You_ would not have done it, William, because you have already learnt there is such a thing as a necessary prudence to deal out your morsels with wisdom, and in a measure suited to the age and the capacity of the birds, and also that their food should be of a wholesome kind suitable to their nature. Nothing of this did Frances know, and it seems she had not learnt wisdom from the circumstances she had herself so lately fallen into.  \"It reminds me of the scripture, which teaches us to profit: 'Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.' These little birds first attracted your attention by their _open mouths_, which they had stretched to receive what their poor mother was preparing to put into them. As one lighted on the edge of their nest, they instinctively opened their little yellow-edged beaks; she delighted to see them do so; and they, taking with content what she had provided for them, with the utmost confidence swallowed it down. She had a bit for every one of them in turn and they waited patiently until it was given them. All was well whilst they were nourished with parental tenderness and prudence, and none other meddled with them, or ventured to give them other things, which they, being blind, received and knew not the hand that gave, nor the consequences of eating food not such as their parent would have provided.  \"Here you see Frances, neither prudent nor aware of consequences, has stuffed these little birds with improper food, both in quality and quantity. The consequences are fatal; one is dead, another is dying, and it is very uncertain whether the others also will not die. She fed them without measure, and their crops and throats were gorged so as to stop their breathing. They took it greedily, because they knew not the fatal consequences.  \"Frances, you are a greedy girl. You had been suffering for this offence, and had not the wisdom to leave it to me to apportion your food. You opened your mouth wide, but you must remember it is not written that _you_ are to fill it according to your own desires. 'I will fill it,' saith the Lord. He knows what is good for us, and he will measure his bounty according to his own wisdom.\"  Frances began to look ashamed and sorrowful.  \"I was to you,\" her mamma continued, \"in the affair of the cake, endeavoring to fulfil this my duty, but you rebelled against my discretion, and would covet more than was right. You _helped yourself_, you gorged your stomach. You were cross and peevish, and ill, and when the medicine had relieved you, as it was designed, you, without reflection, sallied forth and suffocated the little birds. You could not feed them as the _mother_ would. You could not find in the air and on the ground the little insects, and small worms and little grains which were their proper food, and you should have left it to their own mother to fill their opened mouths. _She_ would have made no mistake either in the quality or quantity _convenient_ for them.\"  \"O,\" Mary said, \"how that reminds me of the scripture in Proverbs xxx. 8: 'Feed me with food _convenient_ for me.'\"  \"Yes, my dear girl, it's a scripture of great importance and often does it impress my mind in combination with the other I mentioned, Ps. lxxxi. 10: 'Open thy mouth wide, and _I_ will fill it,' in their spiritual application, when I am providing for you, and dividing out your portions, and considering what diet is most suited to your constitution, and limiting the quantity of dainty or rich luxuries not _convenient_ for you. I am also frequently led to apply it to myself, and to offer my petition to the Lord that he will graciously judge for me, both temporally and spiritually to _fill_ my mouth, and feed me with food _convenient_ for me.\"  \"I think too, mamma, that there is some meaning belonging to this in our Lord's teaching us to pray, 'Give us this day our daily bread,' Matt. vi. 11.\"  \"Assuredly, my dear child, and I am rejoiced to find you are led by this subject to compare spiritual things with spiritual.  \"You see how the word of God interprets itself, and we are taught to go direct to the bounteous hand who giveth liberally, but never wastefully Our daily bread is sufficient for the day, and we must wait on him still for the daily bread of the succeeding day; so we are instructed to open our mouths wide to ask the Lord to fulfil his promise and to fill them, and to be contented with convenient food.\"  \"O Mamma, you cannot think how many scriptures seem to come to my mind, and to give me a clearer understanding. You know the manna which was given in the wilderness, was _convenient_ food when it was gathered daily as the Lord commanded, but when they laid it up, you know it was no longer _convenient,_ for it stunk and bred worms.  Does not this teach us to trust God as well as not to _disobey_ him?\"  \"May this ready application of the word of God proceedeth from that grace, my child, which teaches you, like Job, to esteem the word of God more than your necessary food, for you will also remember what our Lord said to the tempter, 'It is written, Man does not live by _bread alone,_ but _by every word_ that proceeded out of the mouth of God.' But we are too apt to forget this, and to imagine that we can provide well for ourselves by fulfilling the desires and lusts of the flesh, and by so doing, we are likely to be brought to _forget_ God, the bountiful and wise Supplier of all our wants.\"  \"I remember the text, mamma, which has in it, 'Feed me with food _convenient_ for me; and in another part, 'lest I be full and deny thee,' Prov. xxx. 9; and this little bird's nest has helped me to understand it better.\"  \"May the Holy Spirit engrave it on your heart, for it will often remind you of the thankful contentedness with which you ought to wait on the Lord.\"  \"Yes, mamma,\" William said, \"but there is no harm, you know, in opening the mouth _wide_.\"  \"No, William, certainly no _harm_, for it is a _duty_. 'Open thy mouth wide,' is an injunction of God, but it is immediately subjoined and strictly said, 'and I will fill it.' Therefore bear in mind the double instruction. Neither take the filling on yourself, nor be ready to swallow every crude and unwholesome morsel which the ignorant or the wicked would present to you. Do you remember a certain day last week when something happened?\"  William looked anxious to recollect what his mamma alluded to, and in less than a minute he shook his head, and said, \"Ah, mamma, that is too bad, you mean when Mrs. Arnot called, and you were out.\"  \"Yes I do, William; you all opened your mouths wide, and _she_ filled them. Her sweet things did not prove _convenient_ food. You see, therefore, we should learn to discriminate between a heavenly Father's provision, and that of a stranger, whose busy interference may cost you your life. I was not many minutes away from my little nest, when a stranger came, and, by mistaken kindness made you all ill.  \"Frances, have you never read that scripture: 'Put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.'\"  Frances cried, and, sobbing, said, \"I do not know what it means?\"  \"What can it mean, my dear Frances, but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6757"],["title","Fanny, the Flower-Girl; or, Honesty Rewarded.

It is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, than, having two hands or two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire,' Matt. xvvi. 29, 30. ii. 8, 9. It means that spirit which will sacrifice the lust of the heart, and deny itself, though it should be a present mortification. The _throat_ of an inordinate or diseased appetite is to be cut, and its carnal desires crucified.\"  \"Was it not something of this kind that Isaac fell into when he sent Esau to hunt venison, and make him savory meat, such as his soul loved? Gen. xxvii. 4.\"  \"Yes, William, and this very thing he desired presented the temptation by which he was deceived. And you might have mentioned, too, how Esau himself yielded to his appetite, and sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, Gen. xxv. 29. When we yield to these propensities of the flesh, we lay a snare for our own souls, and expose our weakness to an adversary, ever ready to take advantage of our infirmity. It is a common fault in children to desire with greedy appetite such food as is pernicious, and to wish for more than even a mouth opened wide requires--till at length they learn to lust after _forbidden_ things. And what does it lead to? Frances, you began to pick and steal, and your own iniquity chastised you:--you were sick and ill.\"  Frances hid her face in her frock.  \"Ah mamma,\" said Anne, \"I shall be afraid of wanting anything, as I used to do; and I hope I shall remember how much better you can feed me, than I can feed myself.\"  \"I wish I may too,\" said William. \"If Eve had but waited for the Lord only to fill her mouth, she would not have eaten that which brought sin and death.\"  \"Tell me, Frances, if you feel the force of all we have learnt from the little birds, and your own mistaken idea of what would be good for them?\"  Frances did not answer.  \"But you know, my child, you were guilty of another fault; when the medicine was offered, which was likely to do you good,--you _refused_ to open your mouth, and was long before you would let me fill it, so you see we must leave it all to the Lord to give us much or little, bitter or sweet, just as he knows to be _convenient_ for us.\"  \"Yes,\" Mary said, \"these poor little birds will long teach us a lesson. We may imitate them to open our mouth wide, but we must be warned by what happened to them, to let the _Lord_ only fill them.\"  \"Let us look again at the nest.\" They approached, and frightened the mother so, that she flew off.  \"See, see! William,\" said Anne, \"the two little things are opening their mouths again. O how beautiful! let us never meddle with them any more. Only remember, 'Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.' Now, Frances, do not cry any more: come, we will bury these little dead birds.\"  Frances wiped her eyes, and Anne giving her a kiss, they went away to do as she proposed. After they had made a little coffin, they put the two little dead birds into it Then William got a spade, and dug a grave just large enough to hold the little coffin: and, as he lowered it into the grave, Mary wiped away the tears which gathered in her eyes. When William had filled up the grave, they all returned to their mamma, who said--  \"My dear children, do not let us dismiss this interesting subject without a closer application. My dear Frances, come near to me, and hear what I have to say.\"  Frances drew near with some timidity. Conscious of her faults, and expecting the word of truth to be directed to her heart, she had at that moment rather have escaped from it. But her mamma, taking her hands into hers, and sitting down on a garden stool that was nigh, she felt that the words would be words of love, aid her heart beginning to soften, the tears were ready to flow, for she knew that her mamma would speak to her of Jesus and of his blood, which was shed for sinners.  \"Do you know quite well, my child, that among the fruits of the Spirit enumerated, Gal. v., there is one called TEMPERANCE?\"  \"Yes, mamma,\" she replied.  \"Are you not also conscious, my dear child, that your desire of indulging your appetite is quite contrary to this holy fruit?\"  \"Yes, mamma.\"  \"Then what are you to do in order to overcome the one, and to obtain the other?\"  \"I must ask the Lord Jesus to give me the Holy Spirit.\"  \"Yes, my child, to him must you come for all help, and he will not send you empty away. Here is a subject on which you must indeed open your mouth wide, in earnest prayer, and wait on the Lord for his gracious answer. 'Ask, and ye shall receive,' he says, and after showing how an _earthly_ father will act towards his child that asks for bread, how does he conclude?\"  \"He says, 'How much _more_ will your _heavenly_ Father give the _Holy Spirit_ to them that ask Him!'\"  \"Will you then, my dear Frances, profit by this gracious instruction, and will _you_ ask for the Holy Spirit?\"  \"Yes, mamma, I will try.\"  \"Do you believe the Lord will give you the Holy Spirit when you ask?\"  \"He _says_ He _will_, mamma.\"  \"That is enough, my child; what the Lord says is yea and amen. It is written, 'Hath he said, and will he not do it?'\"  \"Yes, mamma, I know God is _Truth_, He cannot lie.\"  \"But you know also, my dear Frances, when the Holy Spirit is given, he takes up his abode in the heart, and he _acts_ in the soul, and will not dwell there without producing his holy fruit; and tell me now what is the fruit you particularly want to overcome this sinful desire of appetite which prevails in your heart.\"  \"Is it not _temperance_, mamma?\"  \"Yes, and if He comes into your heart, he will give it you, and moreover teach you to _repent_ of your sins; for consider, my Frances, sin is an offence against him, and needs to be repented of. Do you repent?\"  \"I am very sorry, mamma.\"  \"But repentance is more than sorrow; it will make you ashamed before God, and make you feel yourself vile; and it will also make you carefully watchful against the temptation; it will make you anxious to quit the sin, and clear your soul from its power; it will make you indignant against it, and urge you to seek that strength from the Spirit, which will resist the sin, and overcome it. When, therefore, you ask for the Holy Spirit, be _willing_ that the Lord should _fill_ you. Be ready to _exercise_ the mighty gift for _all_ his offices, to convict you of sin, to lead you to true expectations, and to strengthen you to overcome your sin, giving you that grace which is specially opposed to the leading sin of your heart.\"  \"I wish I had this gift; for my sin makes me very unhappy: I know it is wrong.\"  \"Do not stop in _wishes_, dear child, go and _pray_; '_Ask_, and ye shall receive.' 'Open your mouth wide' in the full utterance of all your distress, and of all you desire; pray for what you _want, name_ it; pray for _repentance_, and for _temperance_. Pray that the _lust of your appetite_ may be _crucified_, and pray that the blood of Jesus, the Lamb of God who taketh away sin, may be sprinkled upon your guilty soul, and cleanse it from all sin. He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not. He is angry only when we neglect his promises and his gifts.  \"It is not long since, dear Mary, that you and I conversed on this text, 'My people would not hearken to my voice, Israel would none of me: _so I gave them up to their own heart's lusts_,' Psa. lxxxi. A dreadful judgment! what would become of _you_, dear Frances, if you were given up to the dominion of your appetite?\"  \"But, my dear mamma,\" Mary said, \"do you not remember the end of that psalm, what a sweet verse there is?\"  \"Repeat it, dear girl, and let little Frances hear it!\"  \"'_Had_ they hearkened and obeyed, then should he have fed them with the finest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied them.'\"  \"O my children,\" said their mamma, \"here is spiritual food for the spiritual appetite! You know who is the Bread of Life, and who is the Rock of our salvation. Turn unto him your whole heart, and though you feel the burden of the body of this death, you shall soon be able to thank God, who, through Jesus Christ our Lord, will deliver you.\"    \"Poor Esau repented too late,      That once he his birth-right despis'd,   And sold for a morsel of meat,     What could not too highly be priz'd.   How great was his anguish when told,     The blessing he sought to obtain   Was gone with the birth-right he sold,      And none could recall it again!    He stands as a warning to all,      Wherever the gospel shall come!   O hasten and yield to the call,      While yet for repentance there's room!   Your season will quickly be past;      Then hear and obey it to-day,   Lest when you seek mercy at last,      The Saviour should frown you away.    What is it the world can propose?     A morsel of meat at the best!   For this are you willing to lose     A share in the joys of the blest?   Its pleasures will speedily end,     Its favor and praise are but breath;   And what can its profits befriend     Your soul in the moments of death?    If Jesus, for these, you despise,     And sin to the Saviour prefer,   In vain your entreaties and cries,     When summon'd to stand at his bar:   How will you his presence abide?     What anguish will torture your heart,   The saints all enthron'd by his side,     And you be compelled to depart.    Too often, dear Saviour, have I     Preferr'd some poor trifle to thee;   How is it thou dost not deny     The blessing and birth-right to me?   No better than Esau I am,     Though pardon and heaven be mine   To me belongs nothing but shame,     The praise and the glory be thine.\"     I.
