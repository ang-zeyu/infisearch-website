A thing unheard-of, stupendous, marvelous! instead of the meager and unattractive stew, brought every morning to these young people by the _departed_ housekeeper, Madame Séraphin, an enormous cold turkey, served up on an old paper box, ornamented the middle of one of the tables of the office, flanked by two loaves of bread, some Dutch cheese, and three bottles of sealed wine; an old leaden inkstand, filled with a mixture of salt and pepper, served as a salt-cellar; such was the bill of fare.  Each clerk, armed with his knife and a formidable appetite, awaited the hour of the feast with hungry impatience; some of them were raging over the absence of the head clerk, without whom they could not commence their breakfast pursuant to etiquette.  This radical change in the ordinary meals of the clerks of Jacques Ferrand announced an excessive domestic revolution.  The following conversation, eminently Boeotian (if we may be allowed to borrow this word from the witty writer who has made it popular), will throw some light upon this important question:  \"Behold a turkey who never expected, when he entered into life, to appear at breakfast on the table of our governor's quill-drivers!\"  \"Just so; when the governor entered on the life of a notary, in like manner he never expected to give his clerks a turkey for breakfast.\"  \"For this turkey is ours,\" cried Stump-in-the-Gutters, the office-boy, with greedy eyes.  \"My friend you forget; this turkey must be a foreigner to you.\"  \"And as a Frenchman, you should hate a foreigner.\"  \"All that can be done is to give you the claws.\"  \"Emblem of the velocity with which you run your errands.\"  \"I think, at least, I have a right to the carcass,\" said the boy, murmuring.  \"It might be granted; but you have no right to it, just as it was with the Charter of 1814, which was only another carcass of liberty,\" said the Mirabeau of the office.  \"Apropos of carcass,\" said one of the party. \"May the soul of Mother Séraphin rest in peace! for, since she was drowned, we are no longer condemned to eat her ever lasting hash!\"  \"And for a week past, the governor, instead of giving us a breakfast--\"  \"Allows us each forty sous a day.\"  \"That is the reason I say: may her soul rest in peace.\"  \"Exactly; for in her time, the old boy would never have given us the forty sous.\"  \"It is enormous!\"  \"It is astonishing!\"  \"There is not an office in Paris--\"  \"In Europe.\"  \"In the universe, where they give forty sous to a famishing clerk for his breakfast.\"  \"Apropos of Madame Séraphin, which of you fellows has seen the new servant that takes her place?\"  \"The Alsatian girl whom Madame Pipelet, the porter's wife of No. 17, Rue du Temple, the house where poor Louise lived, brought one evening?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I have not seen her yet.\"  \"Nor I.\"  \"Of course not; it is altogether impossible to see her, for the governor is more savage than ever to prevent our entering the pavilion in the courtyard.\"  \"And since the porter cleans the office now, how can one get a glimpse at his Mary?\"  \"Pooh! I have seen her.\"  \"You?\"  \"Where was that?\"  \"How does she look?\"  \"Large or small?\"  \"Young or old?\"  \"I am sure, beforehand, that she has not so good-looking a face as poor Louise--that good girl?\"  \"Come, since you have seen her, how does this new servant look?\"  \"When I say I saw her, I have seen her cap--a very funny cap.\"  \"What sort?\"  \"It was cherry color, and of velvet, I believe; something like those worn by the little broom girls.\"  \"Like the Alsatians? it is very natural, since she is an Alsatian.\"  \"You don't say so!\"  \"But I do! what is it that surprises you? The burnt child shuns the fire!\"  \"Chalamel! what relation between your proverb and this cap?\"  \"There is none.\"  \"Why did you say it, then?\"  \"Because a benefit is never lost, and the dog is a friend of man!\"  \"Hold! If Chalamel opens his budget of proverbs, which mean nothing, we are in for it. Come, tell us what you know of this new servant.\"  \"The day before yesterday I was out in the yard: she had her back toward one of the windows of the ground-floor.\"  \"The yard's back?\"  \"What stupidity! No, the servant's. The glasses are so dirty that I could see nothing of her figure; but I could see her cherry-colored cap, and a profusion of curls, as black as jet; for she wears her hair in short curls.\"  \"I am sure that the governor would not have seen through his spectacles as much as you did; for here you have one, as they say, who, if he remained alone with a woman on the earth, the world would soon come to an end.\"  \"That is not astonishing. He laughs best who laughs last, and, moreover, punctuality is the politeness of kings.\"  \"How wearisome Chalamel is when he lays himself out to it!\"  \"Tell me what company you keep, and I'll tell you what you are.\"  \"Oh! how pretty!\"  \"As for me, I have an idea that it is superstition that stupefies the governor more and more.\"  \"It is, perhaps, from penitence, that he gives us forty sous for our breakfast.\"  \"The fact is, he must be crazy.\"  \"Or sick.\"  \"I think for the last two or three days he has been quite wild.\"  \"Not that we see him so much. He who was, for our torment, in his cabinet from morning till night, and always at our backs, now has not, for two days, put his nose into the office.\"  \"That is the reason the head clerk has so much to do.\"  \"And that we are obliged to die with hunger in waiting for him.\"  \"What a change in the office.\"  \"Poor Germain would be much astonished if any one should say to him, 'Only fancy, my boy, the governor gives us forty sous for our breakfast;' 'Pshaw! it is impossible,' he would say. 'It is so possible that he has announced it to me, Chalamel, in my own person.' 'You are jesting.' 'I jest! This is the way it occurred: during two or three days which followed the death of Madame Séraphin, we had no breakfast at all. We liked that well enough, for no breakfast at all was better than that she gave us; but, on the other hand, our luncheon cost us money. However, we were patient, and said: \"The governor has got no servant, no housekeeper, and when he gets one, we shall have to live on hash again.\" It wasn't so, my poor Germain: the old fellow finally employed a servant, and our breakfast was still buried in the river of oblivion. I was appointed a sort of deputy, to present to the governor the complaints of the stomach; he was with the principal clerk.\" I do not want to feed you in the morning,\" said he, in a gruff, surly tone; \"my servant has no time to prepare your breakfast.\" \"But, sir, you are bound to give us our morning meal.\" \"Well, you may send out for your breakfast, and I will pay for it. How much do you want?--forty sous each?\" added he, with some other subject evidently upon his mind, and mentioning, \"forty sous,\" in the same manner that he would have said twenty sous, or a hundred sous. \"Yes, sir,\" I exclaimed, \"forty sous, will do,\" catching the ball \"on the fly.\" \"Let it be so,\" answered the notary; \"the head clerk will take charge of the expense, and I will settle with him.\" Thereupon the governor shut the door in my face.' You must confess, gentleman that Germain would be astonished at the extraordinary liberality of the governor.\"  \"Germain would say: 'The governor is out of his head.'\"  \"And forty sous a-head out of his pocket,\" said Chalamel.  \"Well done! the first chemist was right who said: 'Bitter as _Calomel!_'\"  \"Seriously, I believe that the governor is sick.\"  \"For ten days past, he is scarcely to be recognized. His cheeks are so hollow, that you might thrust in your fist.\"  \"And he is so absent-minded, that it is curious to see him. The other day he took off his glasses to read a deed; his eyes were red as live coals.\"  \"He was right; short reckonings make long friends.\"  \"For heaven's sake, don't cut me with your saws. I tell you, gentlemen, that it is very singular. It was upside down.\"  \"Which was upside down?--the deed or the governor? It is singular, as you say. What the devil was he doing in that position? I should think it would have given him the apoplexy, unless his habits, as you say, have changed very suddenly.\"  \"How wearisome you are, Chalamel! I mean that it was the deed which I presented wrong end foremost.\"  \"How wild he must have been!\"  \"Not at all; he didn't even perceive it. He looked at it for ten minutes, with his bloodshot eyes fixed upon it, and then he gave it back to me, saying: 'Quite correct.'\"  \"Still upside down?\"  \"Still.\"  \"How could he have read the deed?\"  \"He couldn't, unless he can read upside down.\"  \"No man can do that.\"  \"He looked so gloomy and savage, that I dared not open my lips, and I went away as if nothing had happened.\"  \"I have got something to tell you. Four days ago I was in the office of the head clerk, and in come one client, two clients, three clients, with whom the governor had made an appointment. They waited impatiently, and requested me to go and rap at the door of the study. I rapped, and, receiving no answer, I walked in.\"  \"Well, what did you see?\"  \"M. Ferrand lying upon his arms, which were placed upon the table, and his bald head uncovered. He did not stir.\"  \"He was asleep, probably.\"  \"I thought so. I approached him, and said: 'There are some clients outside, who wish to see you.' He did not move. 'M. Ferrand!' No reply. At length I touched his shoulder, and he started up as if the devil had bitten him. His motion was so sudden, that his big glasses fell off from his nose, and I saw--you never can believe it--\"  \"Out with it. What did you see?\"  \"Tears!\"  \"Nonsense!\"  \"Isn't he a queer bird?\"  \"The governor weep! Get out of the way!\"  \"When you see him cry, ladybirds will play on the French horn!\"  \"And monkeys chew tobacco!\"  \"Pshaw! your nonsense won't prevent me from knowing what I saw with my own eyes. I tell you I saw him as I have described.\"  \"What! weeping?\"  \"Yes, weeping. And after that, he was wroth at being caught in such a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6448"],["title","Mysteries of Paris — Volume 03 (#2)"],["body"," condition, and sung out to me: 'Go away--go away!' 'But, sir.--' 'Go away, I tell you!' 'There are some clients in the office, with whom you have made an appointment, sir, and--' 'I haven't the time to see them. Let them go to the devil, and you with them.' Thereupon he arose, as furious as he could be, and looked so much as if he would kick me out at the door, that I didn't wait for the compliment, but hooked it, and told the clients to leave also. They didn't look greatly pleased, I assure you; but for the reputation of the office, I told them that the governor had caught the whooping-cough.\"  This conversation was now interrupted by the entrance of the principal clerk, who came in as if pressed with business. His appearance was hailed by a general acclamation, and all eyes were turned toward the turkey.  \"Without being uncivil, my lord, I must say that you have detained us from breakfast for a long time,\" said Chalamel. \"You must look out, for the next time our appetites won't be under such good control.\"  \"It is not my fault, I assure you; I was more impatient than you are--the governor must be mad!\"  \"That's what I have been saying.\"  \"But the madness of the governor ought not to keep us from eating.\"  \"It should have the opposite effect.\"  \"We can talk just as well with our mouths full.\"  \"A thousand times better,\" said the office-boy.  Chalamel was carving the turkey, and he said to the principal clerk: \"What reason have you for thinking that the governor is crazy?\"  \"We were inclined to think that he had become perfectly stupid, when he agreed to give us forty sous per head for our daily breakfast.\"  \"I confess that I was as much surprised as you are, gentlemen; but it is a trifle, actually a trifle, compared with what has just occurred.\"  \"You don't say so!\" said another.  \"Is the notary crazy enough to invite us to dine every day, at his expense, at the Cadran-Bleu?\"  \"And give us tickets to the play, after dinner?\"  \"And after that, take us to the _café_, to round off with punch?\"  \"And after that a la--\"  \"Gentlemen, just as far as you please; but the scene which I have just observed is more frightful than funny.\"  \"Give us the scene, I beg of you.\"  \"That's right; don't trouble yourself about the breakfast--we are all ears.\"  \"And all jaws! I see through you, my pretties! while I am speaking, your teeth will be in motion, and the turkey would be finished before my story. Be patient; I will reserve it for the dessert.\"  We do not know whether it was the goad of hunger or curiosity that stimulated the mastication of the young limbs of the law, but the breakfast was so rapidly completed, that the moment for the story arrived immediately.  Not to be surprised by the governor, they sent the office-boy, on whom the carcass and claws of the turkey had been most liberally bestowed, as a sentry into the neighboring room.  The head clerk said to his colleagues, \"In the first place, you must know that, for some days past the porter has been alarmed about master's health. As the good man sits up very late, he has seen M. Ferrand go down to the garden in the night in spite of the cold and rain, and walk up and down rapidly. He ventured to leave his nest, and ask his master if he had need of anything. The governor sent him to bed in such a tone that, since then, the porter has kept himself quiet, and he will keep himself so always, as soon as he hears the governor descend to the garden, which happens every night, no matter what weather.\"  \"The old boy is, perhaps, a somnambulist?\"  \"Not probable; but such nocturnal promenades announce great agitation. I arrive at my story: just now, I went in to get some signatures. At the moment I placed my hand on the lock, I thought I heard some one speak. I stopped, and distinguished two or three dull cries, like stifled sobs. After having hesitated to enter for a moment, fearing some misfortune, I opened the door.\"  \"Well?\"  \"What did I see? The governor on his knees, on the floor.\"  \"On his knees?\"  \"On the floor?\"  \"Yes, kneeling on the floor, his face in his hands and Us elbows on the seat of one of his old arm-chairs.\"  \"It is very plain. What fools we are! He is so bigoted, he was making an extra prayer.\"  \"In any case, it would be a funny prayer! Nothing could be heard but stifled groans, only from time to time he murmured, between his teeth, 'Lord, lord!' like a man in a state of despair. Seeing this, I did not know whether I ought to remain or to retire.\"  \"That would have been also my political opinion.\"  \"I remained, therefore, very much embarrassed, when he rose and turned suddenly. He had between his teeth an old pocket-handkerchief; his spectacles remained on the chair. In all my life I have never seen such a face: he had the appearance of a lost soul. I drew back, alarmed--on my word of honor, alarmed! Then he--\"  \"Caught you by the throat?\"  \"You are out there. He looked at me, at first, with a bewildered air; then, letting his handkerchief fall, which he had, doubtless, gnawed and torn in grinding his teeth, he cried, throwing himself into my arms, 'Oh! I am very unhappy!'\"  \"Draw it mild!\"  \"Fact! Well, in spite of his death's-head look, when he pronounced these words his voice was so heart-rending--I would say, almost so soft--\"  \"So soft? Get out. There is not a rattle, nor Tom-cat with a cold, whose sounds would not be music alongside his voice.\"  \"It is possible; that did not prevent it from being so plaintive at that time that I felt myself quite affected; so much the more as M. Ferrand is not habitually communicative. 'Sir,' said I, 'I believe that.' 'Leave me! leave me!' he answered, interrupting me; 'to tell your sufferings to another is a great solace.' Evidently he took me for some one else.\"  \"So familiar? Then you owe us two bottles of Bordeaux:    \"'When one's master is not proud     One must freely treat the crowd.'  It is the proverb that speaks; it is sacred. Proverbs are the wisdom of a nation.\"  \"Come, Chalamel, leave your proverbs alone. You comprehend, that, on hearing that, I at once understood that he was mistaken, or that he was in a high fever. I disengaged myself, saying, 'Calm yourself! it is I.' Then he looked at me with a stupid look.\"  \"Very well! now that sounds like the truth.\"  \"His eyes were wild. 'Eh!' he answered. 'What is it?--who is there? what do you want with me?' At each question he ran his hand over his face, as if to drive away the clouds which obscured his thoughts.\"  \"'Which obscured his thoughts!' Just as if it were written! Bravo, head clerk; we will make a melodrama together:    \"'Who speaks so well, and so polite,     A melodrama ought to write.'\"  \"Do hold your tongue, Chalamel. I know nothing about it; but what is sure is, that, when he recovered his Senses, it was another song. He knit his brows in a terrible manner, and said to me, with quickness, without giving me time to answer, 'What did you come here for?--have you been a long time here?--can I not be alone in my own house without being surrounded by spies?--what have I said?--what have you heard? Answer, answer.' He looked so wicked that I replied, 'I have heard nothing, sir; I just came in.' 'You do not deceive me?' 'No, sir.' 'Well, what do you want?' 'To ask for some signatures, sir.' 'Give me the papers.' And he began to sign--without reading them, a half dozen notarial acts--he, who never put his flourish on an act without spelling it, letter by letter, and twice over, from end to end. I remarked that, from time to time, his hand slackened a little in the middle of his signature, as if he was absorbed by a fixed idea, and then he resumed and signed quickly, in a convulsive manner. When all were signed he told me to retire, and I heard him descend by the little staircase which leads from his cabinet to the court.\"  \"I now come back to this: what can the matter be with him?\"  \"Perhaps he regrets Madame Séraphin.\"  \"Oh, yes! _he_ regrets any one!\"  \"That reminds me of what the porter said: that the curé of Bonne-Nouvelle and his vicar had called several times, and were not received. That is surprising.\"  \"What I want to know is, what the carpenter and locksmith have been doing in the pavilion.\"  \"The fact is, they have worked there for three days consecutively.\"  \"And then one evening they brought some furniture here in a covered cart.\"  \"I give it up! as sung the swan of Cambrai.\"  \"It is perhaps remorse for having imprisoned Germain which torments him.\"  \"Remorse--_he?_ It is too hard, and too tough, as the eagle of Meau said.\"  \"Fie, Chalamel!\"  \"Speaking of Germain, he is going to have famous recruits in his prison, poor fellow.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"I read in the 'Gazette des Tribunaux' that the gang of robbers and assassins who have been arrested by the Champs Elysees in one of those little subterranean taverns--\"  \"They are real caverns.\"  \"That this band of scoundrels has been confined in La Force.\"  \"Poor Germain, good society for him.\"  \"Louise Morel will also have her part of the recruits; for in the band they say there is a whole family, from father to son and mother to daughter.\"  \"Then they will send the women to Saint Lazare, where Louise is.\"  \"It is, perhaps, some of this band who have attempted the life of the countess who lives near the Observatory, one of our clients. Has not master sent me often enough to know how she is? He appears to be very much interested about her health. Only yesterday he sent me again to inquire how Lady M'Gregor had passed the night.\"  \"Well.\"  \"Always uncertain: one day they hope, the next despair--they never know whether she will get through the day; two days ago she was given up; but yesterday there was a ray of hope; what complicates the matter is, she has a brain fever.\"  \"Could you go into the house, and see where the deed was committed?\"  \"Oh! by no means! I could go no further than the gate, and the porter did not seem disposed to walk much, not as ...\"  \"Here comes master,\" cried the boy,"]]]
