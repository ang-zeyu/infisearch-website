Your child's body will remain in the garret, where it shall to-night, as is customary, be attended and watched by a priest. I will go and request M. Pipelet to undertake the management of these sad duties.\"  \"But, sir, it is not necessary to deprive you of your room. Now that we are in peace, and I no longer fear being taken to prison, our humble apartment appears to me a palace, particularly if my dear Louise remains with us, to attend to the family as formerly.\"  \"Your Louise will not again leave you. You said not long ago it would be a luxury to have her always with you; as some recompense for your past sufferings, she shall never leave you again.\"  \"Oh, sir, can it be possible? It surely cannot be a reality! My senses seem lulled in a sweet dream. I have never thought much of religion, but this sudden change from so much misery to so much happiness shows the hand of an overruling Providence.\"  \"And if a father's grief could be assuaged by promises of reward or recompense,\" said Rudolph, \"I should remind you, that although the Almighty hand has removed one of your daughters from you, He has mercifully restored another.\"  \"True, true, sir. Henceforth we shall have our dear Louise to content us for the loss of poor little Adele.\"  \"You will accept my chamber, will you not? If you refuse, how can you manage the mournful duties toward the poor child that is gone? Think also of your wife, whose mind is already so distracted--to leave her for four-and-twenty hours with such an afflicting spectacle before her eyes!\"  \"You think of everything--of all! How kind you are, sir!\"  \"It is your benefactress you must thank, for her goodness inspires me. I say to you as she would say, and I am sure she would approve of all; so it is agreed that you will accept the offer of my room. Now tell me, this Jacques Ferrand--\"  A dark frown passed across Morel's face.  \"This Jacques Ferrand,\" continued Rudolph, \"is the same lawyer who resides in the Rue du Sentier?\"  \"Yes, sir; do you know him?\" Then, his fears newly awakened on the subject of Louise, Morel exclaimed: \"Since you have heard all that passed, sir, say, say--have I not a right to hate this man? And who knows, if my child, my Louise--\"  He could not proceed; he hid his face with his hands. Rudolph understood his fears.  \"The lawyer's proceedings,\" said he to him, \"ought to reassure you, as he doubtless ordered your arrest to be revenged for the scorn of your daughter; I have good reason, too, to believe that he is a dishonest man. If he is so,\" resumed Rudolph, after a moment's silence, \"let us believe that Providence will punish him. If the justice of Heaven often appears to slumber it awakens some time or other.\"  \"He is very rich, and very hypocritical, sir.\"  \"In your deepest despair, a guardian angel came to your assistance, and plucked you from inevitable ruin; so, at a moment when least expected, the Almighty Avenger may call upon the lawyer to atone for his past crimes if he be guilty.\"  At this moment Miss Dimpleton came from the garret, wiping her eyes. Rudolph said to the young girl, \"Will it not, my good neighbor, be better that M. Morel should occupy my room, with his family, until his benefactress, whose agent I am, shall have provided a suitable lodging?\"  Miss Dimpleton regarded Rudolph with a look of unfeigned surprise. \"Oh, sir! are you really in earnest when you make so generous an offer?\"  \"Yes, but on one condition, which will depend on yourself.\"  \"Oh, depend upon all that is in my power!\"  \"I had some accounts required in haste, to arrange for my employers; they will come for them soon. Now, if you will be so neighborly as to permit me to work in your room, on a corner of your table, I should not disturb your work in the least, and the Morel family can, with the assistance of M. and Mrs. Pipelet, immediately be settled in my room.\"  \"Oh, if it be only that, sir, most willingly; neighbors ought to assist each other. You have set so good an example by what you have done for that poor Morel, that I am at your service, sir.\"  \"No, no, call me neighbor. If you use any ceremony toward me, I shall not have courage to intrude on you,\" said Rudolph.  \"Well, then, it shall be so, I will call you 'neighbor,' because you really are so.\"  \"Father, father!\" cried one of Morel's little boys, coming out of the garret, \"mother is calling you; come directly, pray do.\" The lapidary hastily entered the room.  \"Now, neighbor,\" said Rudolph to Miss Dimpleton, \"you must render me a still further service.\"  \"With all my heart, if it be in my power.\"  \"You are, I am sure, an excellent little housewife. It is necessary to purchase immediately all that is wanted for Morel's family to be properly clothed, bedded, and settled in my room, for there is only sufficient for myself as a bachelor, that was brought yesterday. How can we manage to procure instantly all I wish for the Morels?\"  Miss Dimpleton thought for a moment, and answered: \"In a couple of hours you can have all your want; good clothes ready-made, warm and neat, with good clean linen for all the family: two little beds for the children, and one for the grandmother--in short, all that is necessary; but it will cost a great deal of money.\"  \"You don't say so! How much?\"  \"Oh, at least--at the very least--five or six hundred francs.\"  \"For everything?\"  \"Yes, it is a great sum of money, you see,\" said Miss Dimpleton opening her large eyes, and shaking her bead.  \"And we can procure all these things--\"  \"In two hours.\"  \"You must be a fairy, neighbor.\"  \"Oh, no, it is quite easy. The Temple is only two steps from here, where you will find all of which you are in want.\" \"The Temple?\"  \"Yes, the Temple.\"  \"What place is that?\"  \"Don't know the Temple, neighbor?\"  \"No.\"  \"It is, nevertheless, here where people like you and I furnish our rooms, and clothe ourselves, when we would be economical. Things are cheaper there than elsewhere, and quite as good.\"  \"Really?\"  \"I assure you. Come, now, I suppose--But what did you pay for this great-coat?\"  \"I do not know exactly.\"  \"What, neighbor, can't tell how much your great-coat cost you?\"  \"I acknowledge to you in confidence,\" said Rudolph, smiling, \"that I owe for it; now do you understand that I cannot know?\"  \"Oh, neighbor, neighbor, I fear you are a spendthrift!\"  \"Alas! neighbor!\"  \"You must alter in that respect, if you wish us to be good friends; and I already see that we shall be such, you appear so kind! You shall see that you will be glad to have me for a neighbor; for on that account we can assist each other. I will take care of your linen, and you will help me clean my room. I rise very early, and will call you, so that you may not be late at your shop. I'll knock at the wall until you say to me: 'Good-morning, neighbor.'\"  \"It is agreed; you shall wake me, take care of my linen, and I will clean your room.\"  \"And you will be very neat?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"And when you wish to make any purchase, you will go to the Temple, because here is an example; your greatcoat cost, I suppose, eighty francs; very well, you could have had it at the Temple for thirty.\"  \"Why, that is marvelous! Then you think that with five or six hundred francs, these poor Morels--\"  \"Will be stocked with everything, first-class, for a long time to come.\"  \"Neighbor, an idea has just struck me.\"  \"Well, what is it about?\"  \"Do you understand household affairs--are you clever at making purchases?\"  \"Yes--rather so,\" said Miss Dimpleton, with a look of simplicity.  \"Take my arm, and let us go to the Temple and buy wherewith to clothe the Morels; will that suit you?\"  \"Oh, what happiness! Poor creatures!--but where's the money?\"  \"I have sufficient.\"  \"Five hundred francs?\"  \"The benefactress of the Morels has given me _carte blanche;_ nothing is to be spared that these poor people require. Is there even a place where better things are to be had than at the Temple?\"  \"You will find nowhere better; then there is everything, and all ready-made--little frocks for the children, and dresses for their mother.\"  \"Then let us go at once to the Temple, neighbor.\"  \"Oh! but--\"  \"What's wrong?\"  \"Nothing; but you see, my time is everything to me; and I am already a little behindhand, in occasionally nursing the poor woman Morel; and you may imagine that an hour in one way and an hour in another makes in time a day; a day brings thirty sous, and if we earn nothing one must still live all the same. But, pshaw! never mind; I must spare from my nights; and then, again, parties of pleasure are rare, and I will make this a joyful day; it will seem to me that I am rich, and that it is with my own money I am buying such good things for these poor Morels. Very well, as soon as I have put on my shawl and cap, I shall be at your service, neighbor.\"  \"Suppose, during the time, I bring my papers to your room?\"  \"Willingly, and then you will see my apartment,\" said Miss Dimpleton, with pride; \"for it is already put in order, and that will prove to you that I am an early riser, and that if you are sleepy and idle so much the worse for you, for I shall be a troublesome neighbor.\"  So saying, light as a bird, she flew down the stairs, followed by Rudolph, who went to his room to brush off the dust he had carried away from Pipelet's loft. We will hereafter disclose to the reader how Rudolph was not yet informed of the abduction of Fleur-de-Marie from Bouqueval farm, and why he had not visited the Morels the day after the conversation with Lady d'Harville.  Rudolph, for the sake of appearances, furnished himself with a large roll of papers, which he carried into Miss Dimpleton's room.  Miss Dimpleton was nearly of the same age as Goualeuse, her former prison-friend. There was between these girls the same difference that exists between laughter and tears; between joyful carelessness and melancholy reverie; between daring"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6602"],["title","Mysteries of Paris â€” Volume 02 (#5)"],["body"," and serious, incessant anticipation of the future: between a nature exquisitely delicate, elevated, poetic, morbidly sensitive, incurably wounded by remorse, and a disposition gay, lively, happy, unreflective, although good and compassionate; for, far from being selfish, Miss Dimpleton only cared for the griefs of others; with them she sympathized entirely, devoting herself, soul and body, to those who suffered; but, to use a common expression, her _back turned_ on them, she thought no more about them. Often she interrupted a lively laugh to weep passionately, and checked her tears to laugh again. A real child of Paris, Miss Dimpleton preferred tumult to quiet, bustle to repose, the sharp, ringing harmony of the orchestra at the balls of the _Chartreuse_ and the _Colysee_, to the soft murmur of wind, water, and trees; the deafening tumult of the streets of Paris, to the silence of the country; the dazzling of the fireworks, the glittering of the flowers, the crash of the rockets, to the serenity of a lovely night--starlit, clear, and still. Alas! yes, this good girl preferred the black mud of the streets of the capital to the verdure of its flowery meadows; its pavements miry or tortuous, to the fresh and velvet moss of the paths in the woods, perfumed by violets; the suffocating dust at the City gates, or the Boulevards, to the waving of the golden ears of corn, enameled by the scarlet of the wild poppy and the azure of the bluebell.  Miss Dimpleton never left home but on Sundays, and every morning laid in her provisions of chick-weed, bread, hempseed, and milk for her birds and herself, as Mrs. Pipelet observed. But she lived in Paris for the sake of Paris; she would have been miserable elsewhere than in the capital.  After a few words upon the personal appearance of the grisette, we will introduce Rudolph into his neighbor's apartment.  Miss Dimpleton had scarcely attained her eighteenth year; rather below the middle size, her figure was so gracefully formed and voluptuously rounded, harmonizing so well with a sprightly and elastic step, that an inch more in height would have spoiled the graceful symmetry that distinguished her. The movement of her pretty little feet, incased in faultless boots of black cloth, with a rather stout sole, reminded you of the quick, pretty, and cautious tread of the quail or wagtail. She did not seem to walk, but to pass over the pavement as if she were gliding over its surface. This step, so peculiar to _grisettes_, at once nimble, attractive, and as if somewhat alarmed, may be attributed to three causes; their desire to be thought pretty, their fear of a too-plainly expressed admiration, and the desire they always have not to lose a minute in their peregrinations.  Rudolph had never seen Miss Dimpleton but by the somber light in Morel's garret, or on the landing, equally obscure; he was therefore dazzled by the brilliant freshness of the girl, when he entered silently her room, lit by two large windows. He remained for an instant motionless, struck by the charming picture before him. Standing before a glass, placed over the chimney-piece, Miss Dimpleton had just finished tying under her chin the strings of a small cap of bordered tulle, trimmed with cherry-colored ribbons. The cap, which fitted tightly, was placed far back on her head, and thus revealed two large thick braids of glossy hair, shining like jet, and falling very low in front. Her eyebrows, well-defined, seemed as if traced in ink, and were arched above large black eyes, full of vivacity and expression; her firm and downy cheeks were tinted with a lovely bloom, like a ripe peach sprinkled with the dew of morning. Her small, upturned, and saucy nose would have made the fortune of a Lisette or Marton; her mouth, rather large, with rosy lips and small white teeth, was full of laughter and sport; her cheeks were dimpled and also her chin, not far from which was a little speck of beauty, a dark mole, _killingly_ placed at the corner of her mouth. Between a very low worked collar and the border of the little cap, gathered in by a cherry-colored ribbon, was seen beautiful hair, so carefully twisted and turned up, that its roots were as clear and as black as if they had been painted on the ivory of that tempting neck. A plum-colored merino dress, with a plain back and tight sleeves, skillfully made by herself, covered a bust so dainty and supple, that the young girl never wore a corset--for economy's sake. An ease and unusual freedom in the smallest action of the shoulders and body, resembling the facile, undulating motions of a cat, evinced this peculiarity. Imagine a gown fitting tightly to a form rounded and polished as marble, and we must agree that Miss Dimpleton could easily dispense with the accessory to the dress of which we have spoken. The band of a small apron of dark green levantine formed a girdle round a waist which might have been spanned with your two hands.  [Illustration: THE ROTUNDA]  Supposing herself to be quite alone (for Rudolph still remained at the door motionless and unperceived), Miss Dimpleton, after having smoothed the bands of her hair with her small white hand, placed her little foot upon a chair, and stooped down to tighten her boot-lace. This attitude disclosed to Rudolph a snow-white cotton stocking, and half of a beautifully formed leg.  After this detailed account we may conclude that Miss Dimpleton had put on her prettiest cap and apron, to do honor to her neighbor on their visit to the Temple. The person of the pretended merchant's clerk was quite to her taste: his face, benevolent, proud, and noble, pleased her greatly: and then he had shown so much compassion toward the poor Morels, in giving up his room to them, that, thanks to his kindness of heart, and perhaps also to his good looks, Rudolph had made great steps in the confidence of the grisette, who, according to her ideas of the necessity of reciprocal obligations imposed on neighbors, esteemed herself fortunate that Rudolph had succeeded the commission-traveler, Cabrion, and Francois Germain; for she had begun to feel that the next room had been too long empty, and she feared, above all, that it would not be _agreeably_ occupied.  Rudolph took advantage of his being unperceived, to throw a curious look around this room, which he found deserved more praise than Mrs. Pipelet had given to the extreme neatness of Miss Dimpleton's humble home. Nothing could be gayer or better arranged than this little room. A gray paper, with green flowers, covered the walls; the red-waxed floor shone like a mirror; a saucepan of white earthenware was on the hob, where was also arranged a small quantity of wood, cut so fine and small that you could well compare each piece to a large match. Upon the stone mantelpiece, representing gray marble, were placed for ornament two common flower-pots, painted an emerald green; a little wooden stand held a silver watch, which served in lieu of a clock. On one side shone a brass candle-stick, bright as gold, ornamented with an end of wax candle; on the other side, was one of those lamps formed of a cylinder, with a tin reflector, mounted upon a steel stem, with a leaden stand. A tolerably large glass, in a frame of black wood, surmounted the mantel.  Curtains of green and gray chintz, bordered with worsted galloon, cut out and arranged by Miss Dimpleton, and placed on slight rods of black iron, draperied the windows; and the bed was covered with a quilt of the same make and material. Two glass-fronted cupboards, painted white and varnished, were placed each side of the recess; no doubt containing the household utensils--the portable stove, the broom, etc., etc.; for none of these necessaries destroyed the harmonious arrangement of the room.  A walnut chest of drawers, beautifully grained and well polished, four chairs of the same wood, a large table with one of those green cloth covers sometimes seen in country cottages, a straw-bottom armchair, with a footstool--such was the unpretending furniture. There was, too, in the recess in one of the windows, the cage of the two canaries, faithful companions of Miss Dimpleton. By one of those notable inventions which arise only in the minds of poor people, the cage was set in the middle of a large chest, a foot in depth, upon the table: this chest, which Miss Dimpleton called the garden of her birds, was filled with earth, covered with moss during the winter, and in the spring with turf and flowers. Rudolph gazed into this apartment with interest and curiosity; he perfectly comprehended the joyous humor of this young girl; he pictured the silence disturbed by the warbling birds, and the singing of Miss Dimpleton. In the summer, doubtless, she worked near the open window, half hidden by a verdant curtain of sweet pea, nasturtium, and blue and white morning-glories; in the winter, she sat by the side of the stove, enlivened by the soft light of her lamp.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *  Rudolph was thus far in these reflections, when, looking mechanically at the door, he noticed a strong bolt--a bolt that would not have been out of place on the door of a prison. This bolt caused him to reflect. It had two meanings, two distinct uses: to shut the door _upon_ lovers within--to shut the door _against_ lovers without. One of these uses would utterly contradict the assertions of Mrs. Pipelet-- the other would confirm them. Rudolph had just arrived at these conclusions, when Miss Dimpleton, turning her head, perceived him, and, without changing her position, said: \"What, neighbor! there you are then!\" Instantly the pretty leg disappeared under the ample skirt of the currant-colored gown, and Miss Dimpleton added: \"Caught you, Cunning!\"  \"I am here, admiring in silence.\"  \"And what do you admire, neighbor?\"  \"This pretty little room, for you are lodged like a queen.\"  \"Nay, you see, this is my enjoyment. I seldom go out; so at least I may please"]]]
