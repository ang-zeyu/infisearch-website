Some servants who saw what had happened came rushing to the prince, and the poor young man went nearly mad when he heard the result of his own folly, and could only cry out that he would follow the dragon to the ends of the earth, until he got his wife again.  For months and months he wandered about, first in this direction and then in that, without finding any traces of the dragon or his captive. At last he came to a stream, and as he stopped for a moment to look at it he noticed a little fish lying on the bank, beating its tail convulsively, in a vain effort to get back into the water.  ‘Oh, for pity’s sake, my brother,’ shrieked the little creature, ‘help me, and put me back into the river, and I will repay you some day. Take one of my scales, and when you are in danger twist it in your fingers, and I will come!’  The prince picked up the fish and threw it into the water; then he took off one of its scales, as he had been told, and put it in his pocket, carefully wrapped in a cloth. Then he went on his way till, some miles further down the road, he found a fox caught in a trap.  ‘Oh! be a brother to me!’ called the fox, ‘and free me from this trap, and I will help you when you are in need. Pull out one of my hairs, and when you are in danger twist it in your fingers, and I will come.’  So the prince unfastened the trap, pulled out one of the fox’s hairs, and continued his journey. And as he was going over the mountain he passed a wolf entangled in a snare, who begged to be set at liberty.  ‘Only deliver me from death,’ he said, ‘and you will never be sorry for it. Take a lock of my fur, and when you need me twist it in your fingers.’ And the prince undid the snare and let the wolf go.  For a long time he walked on, without having any more adventures, till at length he met a man travelling on the same road.  ‘Oh, brother!’ asked the prince, ‘tell me, if you can, where the dragon-emperor lives?’  The man told him where he would find the palace, and how long it would take him to get there, and the prince thanked him, and followed his directions, till that same evening he reached the town where the dragon-emperor lived. When he entered the palace, to his great joy he found his wife sitting alone in a vast hall, and they began hastily to invent plans for her escape.  There was no time to waste, as the dragon might return directly, so they took two horses out of the stable, and rode away at lightning speed. Hardly were they out of sight of the palace than the dragon came home and found that his prisoner had flown. He sent at once for his talking horse, and said to him:  ‘Give me your advice; what shall I do--have my supper as usual, or set out in pursuit of them?’  ‘Eat your supper with a free mind first,’ answered the horse, ‘and follow them afterwards.’  So the dragon ate till it was past mid-day, and when he could eat no more he mounted his horse and set out after the fugitives. In a short time he had come up with them, and as he snatched the empress out of her saddle he said to the prince:  ‘This time I will forgive you, because you brought me the water when I was in the cask; but beware how you return here, or you will pay for it with your life.’  Half mad with grief, the prince rode sadly on a little further, hardly knowing what he was doing. Then he could bear it no longer and turned back to the palace, in spite of the dragon’s threats. Again the empress was sitting alone, and once more they began to think of a scheme by which they could escape the dragon’s power.  ‘Ask the dragon when he comes home,’ said the prince, ‘where he got that wonderful horse from, and then you can tell me, and I will try to find another like it.’  Then, fearing to meet his enemy, he stole out of the castle.  Soon after the dragon came home, and the empress sat down near him, and began to coax and flatter him into a good humour, and at last she said:  ‘But tell me about that wonderful horse you were riding yesterday. There cannot be another like it in the whole world. Where did you get it from?’  And he answered:  ‘The way I got it is a way which no one else can take. On the top of a high mountain dwells an old woman, who has in her stables twelve horses, each one more beautiful than the other. And in one corner is a thin, wretched-looking animal whom no one would glance at a second time, but he is in reality the best of the lot. He is twin brother to my own horse, and can fly as high as the clouds themselves. But no one can ever get this horse without first serving the old woman for three whole days. And besides the horses she has a foal and its mother, and the man who serves her must look after them for three whole days, and if he does not let them run away he will in the end get the choice of any horse as a present from the old woman. But if he fails to keep the foal and its mother safe on any one of the three nights his head will pay.’  The next day the prince watched till the dragon left the house, and then he crept in to the empress, who told him all she had learnt from her gaoler. The prince at once determined to seek the old woman on the top of the mountain, and lost no time in setting out. It was a long and steep climb, but at last he found her, and with a low bow he began:  ‘Good greeting to you, little mother!’  ‘Good greeting to you, my son! What are you doing here?’  ‘I wish to become your servant,’ answered he.  ‘So you shall,’ said the old woman. ‘If you can take care of my mare for three days I will give you a horse for wages, but if you let her stray you will lose your head’; and as she spoke she led him into a courtyard surrounded with palings, and on every post a man’s head was stuck. One post only was empty, and as they passed it cried out:  ‘Woman, give me the head I am waiting for!’  The old woman made no answer, but turned to the prince and said:  ‘Look! all those men took service with me, on the same conditions as you, but not one was able to guard the mare!’  But the prince did not waver, and declared he would abide by his words.  When evening came he led the mare out of the stable and mounted her, and the colt ran behind. He managed to keep his seat for a long time, in spite of all her efforts to throw him, but at length he grew so weary that he fell fast asleep, and when he woke he found himself sitting on a log, with the halter in his hands. He jumped up in terror, but the mare was nowhere to be seen, and he started with a beating heart in search of her. He had gone some way without a single trace to guide him, when he came to a little river. The sight of the water brought back to his mind the fish whom he had saved from death, and he hastily drew the scale from his pocket. It had hardly touched his fingers when the fish appeared in the stream beside him.  ‘What is it, my brother?’ asked the fish anxiously.  ‘The old woman’s mare strayed last night, and I don’t know where to look for her.’  ‘Oh, I can tell you that: she has changed herself into a big fish, and her foal into a little one. But strike the water with the halter and say, “Come here, O mare of the mountain witch!” and she will come.’  The prince did as he was bid, and the mare and her foal stood before him. Then he put the halter round her neck, and rode her home, the foal always trotting behind them. The old woman was at the door to receive them, and gave the prince some food while she led the mare back to the stable.  ‘You should have gone among the fishes,’ cried the old woman, striking the animal with a stick.  ‘I did go among the fishes,’ replied the mare; ‘but they are no friends of mine, for they betrayed me at once.’  ‘Well, go among the foxes this time,’ said she, and returned to the house, not knowing that the prince had overheard her.  So when it began to grow dark the prince mounted the mare for the second time and rode into the meadows, and the foal trotted behind its mother. Again he managed to stick on till midnight: then a sleep overtook him that he could not battle against, and when he woke up he found himself, as before, sitting on the log, with the halter in his hands. He gave a shriek of dismay, and sprang up in search of the wanderers. As he went he suddenly remembered the words that the old woman had said to the mare, and he drew out the fox hair and twisted it in his fingers.  ‘What is it, my brother?’ asked the fox, who instantly appeared before him.  ‘The old witch’s mare has run away from me, and I do not know where to look for her.’  ‘She is with us,’ replied the fox, ‘and has changed herself into a big fox, and her foal into a little one, but strike the ground with a halter and say, “Come here, O mare of the mountain witch!”’  The prince did so, and in a moment the fox became a mare and stood before him, with the little foal at her heels. He mounted and rode back, and the old woman placed food on the table, and led the mare back to the stable.  ‘You should have gone to the foxes, as I told you,’ said she, striking the mare with a stick.  ‘I did go to the foxes,’ replied the mare, ‘but they are no friends of mine and betrayed me.’  ‘Well, this time you had better go to the wolves,’ said she, not knowing that the prince had heard all she had been saying.  The third night the prince mounted the mare and rode her out to the meadows, with the foal trotting after. He tried hard to keep awake, but it was of no use, and in the morning there he was again on the log, grasping the halter. He started to his feet, and then stopped, for he remembered what the old woman had said, and pulled out the wolf’s grey lock.  ‘What is it, my brother?’ asked the wolf as it stood before him.  ‘The old witch’s mare has run away from me,’ replied the prince, ‘and I don’t know where to find her.’  ‘Oh, she is with us,’ answered the wolf, ‘and she has changed herself into a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6418"],["title","Five Little Peppers and their Friends (#0)"],["body","LITTLE PEPPERS AND THEIR FRIENDS  By MARGARET SIDNEY  AUTHOR OF \"FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS ABROAD,\" \"A LITTLE MAID OF CONCORD TOWN,\" \"SALLY, MRS.

PREFACE.     There were so many interesting friends of the Five Little Peppers,   whose lives were only the faintest of outlines in the series ending   when Phronsie was grown up, that a volume devoted to this outer   circle has been written to meet the persistent demand.    Herein the author records many happenings that long ago Ben and Polly,   Joel and David told her. And even Phronsie whispered some of it   confidentially into the listening ear. \"Tell about Rachel, please,\"   she begged; and Margaret Sidney promised to write it all down some   day.    And that day seems to have arrived in which it all should be recorded   and the promise fulfilled. For the Five Little Peppers loved their   friends very dearly, and were loyal and true to them. And hand in   hand, the circle widening ever, they lived and loved as this history   records.    MARGARET SIDNEY.     CONTENTS   I. A FIVE-O'CLOCK TEA  II. PHRONSIE  III. CLEM FORSYTHE  IV.

Then she plastered her nose up against its support again, and stared at Phronsie with all her might.  \"Oh,\" said Phronsie, with a little laugh that chased away her fright, \"there isn't any big policeman here. This is Grandpapa's garden.\"  \"'Tain't, it's the perliceman's; everything's the perliceman's,\" contradicted the girl, snapping one set of grimy fingers defiantly.  \"Oh, no,\" said Phronsie, softly but very decidedly, \"this is my dear Grandpapa's home, and the big policeman can't get in here, ever.\"  \"Oh, you ninny!\" The girl staring at her through the railings stopped a minute to laugh, covering both hands over her mouth to smother the sound. \"The perlice can go everywheres they want to. I guess some of 'em's in heaven now, spyin' round.\"  Phronsie dropped the doll she was carrying close to her bosom, to concentrate all her gaze up toward the sky, in wide-eyed amazement that allowed her no opportunity to carry on the conversation.  \"An' I couldn't no more get into this 'ere garden than I could into heaven,\" the girl on the outside said at last, to bring back the blue eyes to earth, \"so don't you think it, you. But, oh, my, don't I wish I could, though!\"  There was so much longing in the voice that Phronsie brought her gaze down from the policemen in their heavenly work to the eyes staring at her. And she clasped her hands together tightly, and hurried up to lay her face against the big iron gate and close to that of the girl.  \"He won't hurt you, the big policeman won't,\" she whispered softly. \"I'll take hold of your hand, and tell him how it is, if he gets in. Come.\"  \"Can't,\" the girl was going to say, but her gaze rested upon the doll lying on the grass where it fell from Phronsie's hand. \"Lawks! may I just have one good squint at that?\" she burst out.  \"You may hold it,\" said Phronsie, bobbing her head till her yellow hair fell over her flushed cheeks.  The gate flew open suddenly, nearly overthrowing her; and the girl, mostly all legs and arms, dashed through, picking up the doll to squeeze it to her neck so tightly that Phronsie rushed up, quite alarmed.  \"Oh, don't,\" she cried, \"you'll frighten her. I'll tell her how it is, and then she'll like you.\"  \"I'll make her like me,\" said the girl, with savage thrusts at the doll, and kissing it all over.  \"Oh, my, ain't you sweet!\" and she cuddled it fiercely in her scrawny neck, her tangled black hair falling around its face.  \"Oh, dear!\" wailed Phronsie, standing quite still, \"she's my child, and she's dreadfully frightened. Oh, please, little girl, don't do so.\"  \"She's been your child forever, and I've never had a child.\" The girl raised her black head to look sternly at Phronsie. \"I'll give her back; but she's mine now.\"  \"Haven't you ever had a child?\" asked Phronsie, suddenly, two or three tears trailing off her round cheeks to drop in the grass, and she drew a long breath and winked very fast to keep the others back.  \"Not a smitch of one,\" declared the other girl decidedly, \"an' I'm a-goin' to hold this one, and pretend I'm its mother.\"  Phronsie drew a long breath, and drew slowly near.  \"You may,\" she said at last.  The new mother didn't hear, being hungrily engaged in smoothing her child's cheeks against her own dirty ones, first one side of the face and then the other, and twitching down the dainty pink gown, gone awry during the hugging process, and alternately scolding and patting the little figure. This done, she administered a smart slap, plunged over to the nearest tree, and set the doll with a thud on the grass to rest against its trunk.  \"Sit up like a lady,\" she commanded.  \"Oh, don't!\" cried Phronsie, quite horror-stricken, and running over on distressed feet. \"She's my child,\" she gasped.  \"No, she's mine, an' I'm teachin' her manners. I ain't through pretendin' yet,\" said the girl. She put out a long arm and held Phronsie back.  \"But you struck her.\" Phronsie lifted a pale face, and her blue eyes flashed very much as Polly's brown ones did on occasion.  The new mother whirled around and stared at her.  \"Why, I had to, just the same as you're licked when you're bad,\" she said, in astonishment.  \"What's 'licked'?\" asked Phronsie, overcome with curiosity, yet keeping her eyes on her child, bolt upright against the tree.  \"Why, whipped,\" said the girl, \"just the same as you are when you're bad.\"  Phronsie drew a long breath.  \"I've never been whipped,\" she said slowly.  \"Oh, my Lord!\" The girl tumbled down to the grass and rolled over and over, coming up suddenly to sit straight, wipe her tangled black hair out of her eyes, and stare at Phronsie. \"Well, you are a reg'lar freak, you are,\" was all she could say.  \"What's a 'freak'?\" asked Phronsie, actually turning her back on her child to give all her attention to this absorbing conversation, with its most attractive vocabulary.  \"It's--oh, Jumbo!\" and over she flopped again, to roll and laugh. \"Well, there!\" and she jumped to her feet so quickly she nearly overthrew Phronsie, who had drawn closer, unable to miss a bit of this very strange proceeding. \"Now I'm through pretending an' I haven't got any child, an' you may have her back.\" She wrung her grimy hands together, and turned her back on the object of so much attention. \"Take her, quick; she's yours.\"  Phronsie hurried over to the doll, sitting up in pink loveliness against the tree, knelt down on the grass, and patted her with gentle hand, and smoothed down her curls. A curious sound broke in upon her work, and she looked up and listened. \"I must go back,\" she whispered to her child, and in a minute she was running around the figure of the girl, to stare into her face.  \"Ow--get out!\" cried the girl crossly, and she whirled off, pulling up her ragged dress to her face.  \"I thought I heard you cry,\" said Phronsie in a troubled voice, and following her in distress.  \"Phoo!\" cried the girl, snapping her fingers in derision, and spinning around on the tips of her toes, \"'twas the cat.\"  \"No,\" said Phronsie decidedly, and shaking her head, \"it couldn't be the cat, because she doesn't hardly ever cry, and besides she isn't here\"--and she looked all around--\"don't you see she isn't?\"  \"Well, then, 'twas that bird,\" said the girl, pointing up to a high branch. \"Ain't you green, not to think of him!\"  \"I don't _think_ it was the bird,\" said Phronsie slowly, and peering up anxiously, \"and he doesn't cry again, so I 'most know he couldn't have cried then.\"  \"Well, he will, if you wait long enough,\" said the girl defiantly.  \"Chee, chee, chee,\" sang the bird, with delicious little trills, and shaking them out so fast his small throat seemed about to burst with its efforts.  \"There, you see he couldn't cry,\" began Phronsie, in a burst of delight; \"you see, little girl,\" and she hopped up and down in glee.  \"He's got the 'sterics, an' he'll cry next, like enough,\" said the girl.  \"What's 'the 'sterics'?\" asked Phronsie, coming out of her glee, and drawing"]]]
