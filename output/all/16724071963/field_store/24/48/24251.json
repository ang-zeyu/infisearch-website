What are such fellows made for?”  “Rather for ornament than use,” answered Harry, gravely.  The Yankee burst into a loud guffaw, and regarded Harry’s remark a capital joke.  The voyage was to be a long one, and after a couple of weeks they all had their sea legs on. All had become acquainted, and settled down to a regular routine. But the time dragged, and as there were no morning or evening papers, something seemed necessary to break the monotony.  “Harry,” said the professor, “I have an idea.”  “What is it, professor?”  “Suppose we give an exhibition for the benefit of our fellow passengers and the crew.”  “I am ready to do my part.”  “Then I will speak to the captain.”  The result was that on the first quiet day Professor Hemenway and his assistant gave a matinee performance on the deck of the Nantucket, at which all who could possibly be spared were present. To some of the sailors it was a novelty, and the magician’s tricks actually inspired some with the feeling that he was possessed of supernatural powers.  “Will you lend me your hat, Mr. Clinton?” he asked presently, of the dude.  “Certainly, professor,” drawled the young man.  The professor took it, and tapped it.  “Are you sure there is nothing in it?” he asked.  “I am sure of it. Really, I don’t carry things in my hat, don’t you know.”  “What do you say to this, then?” and Professor Hemenway drew out of the hat half a dozen onions, a couple of potatoes, and a ship biscuit.  “My dear sir, I think you are mistaken,” he said. “I see you carry your lunch in your hat.”  All present laughed at the horrified face of the dude.  “On my honor, I don’t know how those horrid things came in my hat,” he stammered.  “Are you fond of onions, Mr. Clinton?” asked Harry.  “I wouldn’t eat one for--for a new suit of clothes!” protested Clinton, earnestly.  “Allow me to return your hat, Mr. Clinton,” said the professor, politely. “I suppose you want the vegetables too. Here are the onions, and the rest.”  “They are not mine, on my honor,” said Clinton, very much embarrassed. “Here, my good man, can you make use of these?”  The sailor whom he addressed accepted the gift with a grin.  “Thank you kindly, sir,” he said, “If so be as I ain’t a-robbin’ you.”  “I have no use for them, my good man. I never ate an onion in my life.”  “Then I don’t think you know what’s good,” said Mr. Stubbs. “An onion, let me tell you, is mighty good eatin’, and healthy, too.”  At the close of the magical entertainment, Harry sang by request, and no part of the performance was more popular. He received many warm congratulations.  “Really, Mr. Vane, you sing like a nightingale, don’t you know,” was the tribute of Clinton.  “Bless me!” said Mr. Timmins; “I was so absorbed in your song that I have forgotten to take my catarrh medicine.”  “Thank you, sir; that is the best compliment I have received,”  returned Harry, with a smile.  Little has been said thus far of Captain Hill, the chief officer of the Nantucket. He was a stout, red-faced seaman, nearing fifty years of age, and had been in service ever since he was fifteen. He was a thorough sailor, and fitted in every way but one to take charge of a ship bound to any part of the world. His one disqualification may be stated briefly--he had a passion for drink.  It was not immediately that this was found out. He took his meals with the passengers, but it was not then that he indulged his appetite. He kept a private store of liquors in his cabin, and had recourse to them when by himself, under the impression that he could keep it a secret. But intemperance, like murder, will out.  Harry and the professor were standing by the rail looking out at sea, one day, when a thick voice greeted them, “Good-mor’n’, gentlemen,”  this address being followed by a hiccough.  Both turned quickly, and exchanged a significant glance when they recognized the captain.  “Yes,” answered Professor Hemenway, “it is indeed a fine morning.”  “I am sorry to see this, Harry,” said the professor.  “Yes, sir; it is a pity any gentleman should drink too much.”  “Yes, but that isn’t all,” said the professor, earnestly; “it is a pity, of course, that Captain Hill should so sin against his own health, but we must consider furthermore, that he has our lives under his control. Our safety depends on his prudent management.”  “He seems to understand his business,” said Harry.  “Granted; but no man, however good a seaman, is fit to manage a vessel when he allows liquor to rob him of his senses. I wish I had had a knowledge beforehand of the captain’s infirmity.”  “Suppose you had, sir?”  “I wouldn’t have trusted myself on board the Nantucket, you may be sure of that.”  “It may be only an exceptional case.”  “Let us hope so.”  The next occasion on which the captain displayed his infirmity was rather a laughable one. He came up from the cabin about three o’clock in the afternoon so full that he was forced to stagger as he walked. Directly in front of him the young dude, Montgomery Clinton, was pacing the deck, carrying in his hand a rattan cane such as he used on shore. As he overhauled him, Captain Hill, with the instinct of a drunken man, locked arms with the young man, and forced him to promenade in his company, talking rather incoherently meanwhile. Clinton’s look of distress and perplexity, as he submitted to his fate, caused Harry nearly to explode with laughter. They were indeed a singular pair.  Finally there came a disaster. A lurch of the vessel proved too much for the captain, who, in losing his equilibrium, also upset Clinton, and the two rolled down under one of the ship’s boats, which was slung on one side.  Montgomery Clinton picked himself up, and hurriedly betook himself to his cabin, fearing that he might fall again into the clutches of his unwelcome companion. The captain was helped to his feet by the mate, and was persuaded also to go downstairs.  “The captain was pretty well slewed, professor,” said Mr. Stubbs, who chanced to be on deck at the time.  “It looks like it,” answered Professor Hemenway.  “If he does that often it’ll be a bad lookout for us.”  “Just what I am thinking, Mr. Stubbs.”     CHAPTER X  THE YOUNG SAILOR   The crew of the Nantucket consisted of twelve sailors and a boy, not counting the officers. This boy was about Harry’s age, but an inch or two shorter, and with great breadth of shoulders. He had a good-natured face, and was a general favorite on board, as is apt to be the case with a boy, if he possesses any attractive qualities. He came from New Hampshire and he was known as Jack.  It was natural that Harry, as the only other boy on board, though a passenger, should be attracted to Jack. He took an opportunity when Jack was off duty to have a chat with him.  “How long have you been a sailor, Jack?” he asked.  “Three years; I first went to sea when I was thirteen.”  “How did you happen to go in the first place?”  “I may say to begin with, that I always liked the water. I was born in a little village bordering Lake Winnipiseogee, and was out on the lake whenever I could get the chance, either in a rowboat or sailboat. I felt as much at home on the water as on the land. Still, I never should have gone to sea had it not been for my stepfather.”  “Then you have a stepfather?”  “Yes. My father died when I was ten, leaving my mother a little farm and a comfortable house. I was a young boy, and it is hard for a woman to carry on a farm. A man came into town, and started in some small business. He pretended that he had money, but I guess he had precious little. At any rate, he didn’t object to more. Pretty soon he fixed his eyes on our farm, and, finding that mother owned it clear, he got to coming round pretty often. I never liked him, though he pretended to be fond of me, and used to pat me on the head, and bring me candy. I wondered what made him come so often, but I didn’t mistrust anything till one day mother called me and said she had something important to say to me.  “‘Jack,’ she said, ‘what do you think of Mr. Bannock?’  “‘I don’t think much of him,’ I answered.  “‘He is to be your father, Jack. I have promised to marry him.’  “‘You may marry him,’ I answered hotly, ‘but he will be no father of mine. My father lies in the churchyard. I wish he were alive again.’  “‘So do I, Jack’ said mother, wiping her eyes, ‘but we know that can’t be.’”  “How did he treat you, Jack?” asked Harry, interested.  “He never liked me, and I didn’t like him at all He tried to impose upon me, and order me round, but he didn’t make out much. Still, he was always annoying me in mean little ways, and finally I got all I could stand, and the long and short of it is that I ran away to Portsmouth, and went on a coasting voyage. After I got back I shipped from Boston for Liverpool, and ever since I’ve kept sailing in one direction or another. This will be my longest voyage.”  “Haven’t you been to see your mother since you left home three years ago?” Harry inquired.  “Of course I have,” said Jack, promptly. “I always go to see her as soon as I get home from a voyage. Poor mother! She was looking pale and thin when I saw her three weeks ago. I am sure she has repented marrying, but she won’t own up. When I’m a man----”  “Well, Jack; when you’re a man?”  “I’ll see that she has a better time, and if old Bannock don’t like it he can clear out. I think he will anyway.”  “Clear out?”  “Yes; he will have spent all the property by that time, and when that is done, he won’t make much objection to going away. Then I will take care of mother, and see that she does not suffer for anything.”  “You are right, Jack. I sympathize with you. I hope you’ll succeed. I only wish I had a mother to look out for,” and Harry’s fine face wore an expression of sadness. “But there’s one thing I can’t help saying, though I don’t want to discourage you.”  “What is that, Harry?”  “I don’t see how you are going to lay up much "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6462"],["title","An Introduction to the mortuary customs of the North American Indians (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

POWELL DIRECTOR   INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF MORTUARY CUSTOMS AMONG THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS   BY DR. H. C. YARROW ACT ASST SU G USA   WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1880      SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY  _Washington D. C. July 8, 1880_   This little volume is the third of a series designed to promote anthropologic researches among the North American Indians. The first was prepared by myself and entitled \"Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages,\" the second by Col. Garrick Mallery entitled Introduction to the Study of Sign Language among the North American Indians.  The following are in course of preparation and will soon appear.  Introduction to the Study of Medicine Practices among the North American Indians  Introduction to the Study of Mythology among the North American Indians  Introduction to the Study of Sociology among the North American Indians  The mortuary customs of savage or barbaric people have a deep significance from the fact that in them are revealed much of the philosophy of the people by whom they are practiced. Early beliefs concerning the nature of human existence in life and after death and the relations of the living to the dead are recorded in these customs. The mystery concerning the future love for the departed who were loved while here, reverence for the wise and good who may after death be wiser and better, hatred and fear of those who were enemies here and may have added powers of enmity in the hereafter--all these and like considerations have led in every tribe to a body of customs of exceeding interest as revealing the opinions, the philosophy of the people themselves.  In these customs, also are recorded evidences of the social condition of the people, the affection in which friends and kindred are held, the very beginnings of altruism in primitive life.  In like manner these customs constitute a record of the moral condition of the people, as in many ways they exhibit the ethic standards by which conduct in human life is judged. For such reasons the study of mortuary customs is of profound interest to the anthropologist.  It is hoped that by this method of research the observations of many men may be brought together and placed on permanent record, and that the body of material may be sufficient, by a careful comparative study, to warrant some general discussion concerning the philosophy of this department of human conduct.  General conclusions can be reached with safety only after materials from many sources have been obtained. It will not be safe for the collector to speculate much upon that which he observes. His own theory or explanation of customs will be of little worth, but the theory and explanation given by the Indians will be of the greatest value. What do the Indians do, and say, and believe? When these are before us it matters little whether our generalizations be true or false. Wiser men may come and use the facts to a truer purpose. It is proposed to make a purely objective study of the Indians, and, as far as possible, to leave the record unmarred by vain subjective speculations.  The student who is pursuing his researches in this field should carefully note all of the customs, superstitions, and opinions of the Indians relating to--  1. The care of the lifeless body prior to burial, much of which he will find elaborated into sacred ceremonies.  2. The method of burial, including the site of burial, the attitude in which the body is placed, and the manner in which it is investured. Here, also, he will find interesting and curious ceremonial observances. The superstitions and opinions of the people relating to these subjects are of importance.  3. The gifts offered to the dead; not only those placed with the body at the time of burial, but those offered at a subsequent time for the benefaction of the departed on his way to the other world, and for his use on arrival. Here, too, it is as important for us to know the ceremonies with which the gifts are made as to know the character of the gifts themselves.  4. An interesting branch of this research relates to the customs of mourning, embracing the time of mourning, the habiliments, the self- mutilations, and other penances, and the ceremonies with which these are accompanied. In all of these cases the reason assigned by the Indians for their doings, their superstitions, and explanations are of prime importance.  5. It is desirable to obtain from the Indians their explanation of human life, their theory of spirits and of the life to come.  A complete account of these customs in any tribe will necessitate the witnessing of many funeral rites, as the custom will differ at the death of different persons, depending upon age, sex, and social standing. To obtain their explanations and superstitions, it will be necessary to interrogate the Indians themselves. This is not an easy task, for the Indians do not talk with freedom about their dead. The awe with which they are inspired, their reverence and love for the departed, and their fear that knowledge which may be communicated may be used to the injury of those whom they have loved, or of themselves, lead them to excessive reticence on these subjects. Their feelings should not be rudely wounded. The better and more thoughtful members of the tribe will at last converse freely on these subjects with those in whom they have learned to place confidence. The stories of ignorant white men and camp attaches should be wholly discarded, and all accounts should be composed of things actually observed, and of relations made by Indians of probity.  This preliminary volume by Dr. H. C Yarrow has been the subject of careful research and of much observation, and will serve in many ways as a hint to the student. The literature of the subject is vast, but to a large extent worthless, from the fact that writers have been hasty travelers or subjective speculators on the matter. It is strange how much of accepted history must be rejected when the statements are carefully criticised and compared with known facts. It has frequently been stated of this or that tribe that mutilations, as the cutting off of fingers and toes, of ears and nose, the pulling out of teeth, &c., are extensively practiced as a mode of mourning find wild scenes of maiming and bloodshed are depicted as following upon the death of a beloved chief or great man yet among these tribes maimed persons are rarely found It is probable that there is some basis of fact for the statement that mutilations are in rare instances practiced among some tribes. But even this qualified statement needs absolute proof.  I am pleased to assure those who will take part in this work by earnest and faithful research that Dr Yarrow will treat them generously by giving them full credit for their work in his final publication.  I must not fail to present my thanks to the Surgeon General of the United States Army and his corps of officers for the interest and assistance they have rendered.  J W POWELL     WASHINGTON, D C, _April_ 5, 1880   DEAR SIR: I have the honor to offer for your consideration the following paper upon the Mortuary Customs of the North American Indians, and trust it may meet with your approval as an introduction to the study of a subject which, while it has been alluded to by most authors, has received little or no systematic treatment. For this and other reasons I was induced some three years since to commence an examination and collection of data relative to the matter, and the present paper is the outcome of that effort. From the vast amount of material in the Bureau of Ethnology, even at the present time, a large volume might be prepared, but it was thought wiser to endeavor to obtain a still greater array of facts, especially from living observers. If the desired end is attained I shall not count as lost the labor which has been bestowed.  Very respectfully, your obedient servant,  H C. YARROW.  Maj. J. W. POWELL,  _In charge of Bureau of Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution_     _The wisest of beings tells us that it is better to go to the House of Mourning than to that of laughter. And those who have well consider d the grounds he bad for thus his judgment will not by the title of this book (as melancholy as it appears) be affrighted from the perusing it.  What we read to have been and still to be the custom of some nations to make sepulchres the repositories of their greatest riches is (I am sure) universally true in a moral sense however it may be thought in the literal there being never a grave but what conceals a treasure though all have not the art to discover it I do not here invite the covetous miser to disturb the dead who can frame no idea of treasure distinct from gold and silver but him who knows that wisdom and virtue are the true and sole riches of man. Is not truth a treasure think you? Which yet Democritus assures us is buried in a deep pit or grave and he bad reason for whereas we meet elsewhere with nothing but pain and deceit we no sooner look down into a grave but truth faceth us and tells us our own._--MURET     INQUIRIES AND SUGGESTIONS  upon the  MORTUARY CUSTOMS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.  BY H. C. YARROW.     INTRODUCTORY.   The primitive manners and customs of the North American Indians are rapidly passing away under influences of civilization and other disturbing elements. In view of this fact, it becomes the duty of all interested in preserving a record of these customs to labor assiduously, while there is still time, to collect such data as may be obtainable. This seems the more important now, as within the last ten years an almost universal interest has been awakened in ethnologic research, and the desire for more knowledge in this regard"]]]
