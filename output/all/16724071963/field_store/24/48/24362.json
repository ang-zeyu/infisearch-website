There is a pool of clear water under a tree in the garden--go there daily and look for my shadow in the water. If you see it not, know that I am unaltered; and if you see it, know that I no longer love thee.\"  Then they embraced and kissed each other, and Horn parted from her, and rode down to the coast, and took passage on a ship bound for Ireland. When he landed there, two of its King's sons met him, and took him to their father, good King Thurstan, before whom Horn bowed low, and the King bade him welcome, and praised his beauty, and asked his name.  \"My name is Good Courage,\" said Horn boldly, and the King was well pleased.  Now, at Christmas, King Thurstan made a great feast, and in the midst of it one rushed in crying, \"Guests, O King! We are besieged by five heathen chiefs, and one of them proclaims himself ready to fight any three of our knights single handed to-morrow at sunrise.\"  \"That would be but a sorry Christmas service,\" said King Thurstan; \"who can advise me how best to answer them?\" Then Horn spoke up from his seat at the table, \"If these pagans are ready to fight, one against three, what may not a Christian dare? I will adventure myself against them all, and one after another they shall go down before my good sword.\"  Heavy of heart was King Thurstan that night, and little did he sleep. But \"Sir Good Courage\" rose early and buckled on his armour. Then he went to the King and said, \"Now, Sir King, come with me to the field, and I will show you in what coin to pay the demands of these heathen.\" So they rode on together in the twilight, till they came to the green meadow, where a giant was waiting for them. Horn greeted him with a blow that brought him to the ground at once, and ran another giant through the heart with his sword; and when their followers saw that their leaders were slain, they turned and fled back to the shore, but Horn tried to cut them off from their ships, and in the scrimmage the King's two sons fell. At this Horn was sore grieved, and he fell upon the pagans in fury, and slew them right and left, to avenge the King and himself.  Bitterly wept King Thurstan when his sons were brought home to him on their biers; there was great mourning for the young princes, who were buried with high honours in the vault under the church. Afterwards the King called his knights together and said to Horn, \"Good Courage, but for you we were all dead men. I will make you my heir; you shall wed my daughter Swanhild, who is bright and beautiful as the sunshine, and shall reign here after me.\"  So Horn lived there for six years, always under the name of Good Courage, but he sent no messenger to Riminild, not wishing any man to know his secret, and consequently Riminild was in great sorrow on his account, not knowing whether he was true to her or not. Moreover, the King of a neighbouring country sought her hand in marriage, and her father now fixed a day for the wedding.  One morning, as Horn was riding to the forest, he saw a stranger standing in the wayside, who, on being questioned said, \"I come from Westland, and I seek the Knight Sir Horn. Riminild the maiden is in sore heaviness of spirit, bewailing herself day and night, for on Sunday next she is to be married to a King.\"  Then was Horn's grief as great as that of Riminild. His eyes overflowed with tears. He looked at his ring with its colored stones; the one had not turned red, but it seemed to him that the other was turning pale. \"Well knew my heart that you would keep your troth with me, Riminild,\" said he to himself, \"and that never would that stone grow red; but this paling one bodes ill. And you doubtless have often looked in the garden pool for my shadow, and have seen naught there but your own lovely image. _That_ shadow shall never come, O sweet love, Riminild, to prove to you that your love is false, but he himself shall come and drive all shadows away.  \"And you, my trusty messenger,\" he said aloud, \"go back to maid Riminild and tell her that she shall indeed wed a King next Sunday, for before the church bells ring for service I will be with her.\"  The Princess Riminild stood on the beach and looked out to sea, hoping to see Horn coming in his helmet and shield to deliver her; but none came, save her own messenger, who was washed up on the shore--drowned! And she wrung her hands in her anguish.  Horn had gone immediately to King Thurstan, and, after saluting him, told him his real name and his present trouble. \"And now, O King,\" said he, \"I pray you to reward me for all my services by helping me to get possession of Riminild. Your daughter, Swanhild, will I give to a man the best and faithfullest ever called to the ranks of knighthood.\"  Then said the King, \"Horn, follow your own counsel\"; then he sent for his knights, and many of them followed Horn, so that he had a thousand or more at his command. The wind favoured their course, and in a few hours the ships cast anchor on the shore of Westland. Horn left his forces in a wood while he went on to learn what was doing. Well did he know the way, and lightly did he leap over the stones. As he went he met a pilgrim, and asked him the latest news, who answered, \"I come from a wedding feast--but the bride's true love is far away, and she only weeps. I could not stay to see her grief.\"  \"May God help me!\" said Horn: \"but this is sorrowful news. Let us change garments, good pilgrim. I must go to the feast, and once there I vow. I will give them something by which to remember Horn!\" He blackened his eyebrows, and took the pilgrim's hat and staff, and when he reached the gate of the palace, the porter was for turning him back, but Horn took him up and flung him over the bridge, and then went on to the hall where the feast was being held. He sat down among the lowest, on the beggar's bench, and glowered round from under his blackened eyebrows. At a distance he saw Riminild sitting like one in a dream; then she rose to pour out mead and wine for the knights and squires, and Horn cried out, \"Fair Queen, if ye would have God's blessing, let the beggar's turn come next.\"  She set down the flagon of wine, and poured him out brown beer in a jug, saying: \"There, drink that off at a draught, thou boldest of beggar men!\" But he gave it to the beggars, his companions, saying \"I am not come to drink jugs of beer, but goblets of wine. Fair Queen,\" he cried, \"thou deemest me a beggar, but I am rather a fisherman, come to haul in my net, which I left seven years ago hanging from a fair hand here in Westland.\" Then was Riminild much troubled within herself, and she looked hard at Horn. She reached him the goblet and said, \"Drink wine then, fisherman, and tell me who thou art.\"  He drank from the goblet, and then dropped into it the gold ring, and said, \"Look, O Queen, at what thou findest in the goblet, and ask no more who I am.\" The Queen withdrew into her bower with her four maidens, and when she saw the gold ring that she had given to Horn, she was sore distressed, and cried out, \"Childe Horn must be dead, for this is his ring.\"  She then sent one of her waiting-maids to command the stranger to her presence, and Horn, all unrecognised, appeared before her. \"Tell me, honest pilgrim, where thou gottest this ring?\" she asked him.  \"I took it,\" said he, \"from the finger of a man whom I found lying sick unto death in a wood. Loudly he was bewailing himself and the lady of his heart, one Riminild, who should at this time have wedded him.\" As he spoke he drew his cap down over his eyes, which were full of tears.  Then Riminild cried, \"Break, heart, in my bosom! Horn is no more--he who hath already caused thee so many tender pangs.\" She threw herself on her couch and called for a knife, to kill the bridegroom and herself.  Her maidens shrieked with fear, but Horn flung his arms around her and pressed her to his heart. Then he cast away hat and staff, and wiped the brown stain from his face, and stood up before his love in his own fair countenance, asking, \"Dear love, Riminild, know thou me not now? Away with your grief and kiss me--I am Horn!--Horn, your true lover and born slave.\"  She gazed into his eyes. At first she could not believe that it was he, but at last she could doubt no longer; she fell upon his neck, and in the sweet greetings that followed were two sick hearts made whole.  \"Horn, you miscreant! how could you play me such a trick?\"  \"Have patience, sweet love, maid Riminild, and I will tell you all. Now let me go and finish my work, and when it is done I will come and rest at your side.\"  So he left her, and went back to the forest, and Riminild sent for Athulf, who met her with a doleful countenance. \"Athulf!\" she cried, \"rejoice with me! Horn has come--I tell you Horn is here!\"  \"Alas!\" said Athulf, \"that cannot be. Who hath brought thee such an idle tale? Day and night have I stood here watching for him, but he came not, and much I fear me the noble Horn is dead.\"  \"I tell you he is living,\" she said--\"aye, and more alive than ever. Go to the forest and find him--he is there with all his faithful followers.\"  Athulf made haste to the forest, still unbelieving, but soon his heart bounded for joy, for there rode Horn in his shining armour at the head of his troops. Athulf rode to his side, and they returned together to the city, where Riminild was watching them from her turret. And Horn pointed to her and cried to his company, \"Knights, yonder is my bride--help me to win her!\"  Then was there a fierce storming of the gate--the shock of it shook Riminild's tower--and Horn and his heroes burst, all unheralded, into the King's hall. Fierce and furious was the bridal dance that followed; the tumult of it rose up to Riminild, and she prayed, \"God preserve my lover in this wild confusion!\"  Right"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6622"],["title","Legends That Every Child Should Know; a Selection of the Great Legends of All (#6)"],["body","danced her dancer, and all unscathed he flashed through the hall, thanks to his true love and God's care. King Aylmer and the bridegroom confronted him and the younger, the bridegroom King, asked him what he sought there. \"I seek my bride,\" said he, \"and if you do not give her up to me I will have your life.\"  \"Better thou should have the bride than that,\" said the other; \"though I would sooner be torn in pieces than give thee either.\" And he defended himself bravely, but it availed him naught. Horn struck off his head from his shoulders, so that it bounded across the hall. Then cried Horn to the other guests, \"The dance is over!\" after which he proclaimed a truce, and, throwing himself down on a couch, spake thus to King Aylmer: \"I was born in Southland, of a royal race. The pagan Vikings slew King Altof, my father, and put me out to sea with my twelve companions. You did train me for the order of knighthood, and I have dishonoured it by no unworthy deeds, though you did drive me from your kingdom, thinking I meant to disgrace you through your daughter. But that which you credited me with I never contemplated. Accept me then, O King, for your son-in-law. Yet will I not claim my bride till I have won back my kingdom of Southland. That will I accomplish quickly, with the help of my brave knights and such others as I pray you to lend me, leaving in pledge therefor the fairest jewel in my crown, until King Horn shall be able to place Queen Riminild beside him on his father's throne.\"  As he spoke Riminild entered, and Horn took her hand and led her to her father, and the young couple stood before the old King--a right royal pair. Then King Aylmer spoke jestingly, \"Truly I once did chide a young knight in my wrath, but never King Horn, whom I now behold for the first time. Never would I have spoken roughly to King Horn, much less forbidden him to woo a Princess.\"  Then all the knights and lords came offering their good wishes to the happy pair; and the old house-steward, Athelbrus, would have bent the knee to his former pupil, but Horn took the old man in his arms and embraced him, thanking him for all the pains he had taken with his breeding.  Horn's twelve companions came also, and did him homage as their sovereign, and he rejoiced to see them all, but especially Athulf the brave and true. \"Athulf,\" he told him, \"thou hast helped me to win my bride here, now come with me to Southland and help me to make a home for her. And you, too, shall win a lady--I have already chosen her; her name is Swanhild, and she will look fair even beside Riminild.\" Then did Athulf rejoice, but Figold, the traitor, was ready to sink into the ground with shame and envy.  Then Horn returned to his ship, taking Athulf with him, but Figold he left behind. Truly it is ill knowing what to do with a traitor, whether you take him to the field or leave him at home.  On went the ship before a favouring wind; the voyage lasted but four days. Horn landed at midnight, and he and Athulf went inland together. On the way they came upon a noble looking knight asleep under his shield, upon which a cross was painted, and Horn cried to him, \"Awake, and tell us what they are doing here. Thou seemest to be a Christian, I trow, else would I have hewn thee in pieces with my sword!\"  The good knight sprang up aghast, and said, \"Against my will I am serving the heathen who rule here. I am keeping a place ready for Horn, the best loved of all heroes. Long I have wondered why he does not bestir himself to return and fight for his own. God give him power so to do till he slay every one of these miscreants. They put him out to sea, a tender boy, with his twelve playmates, one of whom was my only son, Athulf. Dearly he loved Horn, and was beloved by him. Could I but see them both once more, I should feel that I could die in peace.\"  \"Then rejoice,\" they told him, \"for Horn and Athulf are here!\"  Joyfully did the old man greet the youths; he embraced his son and bent the knee to Horn, and all three rejoiced together.  \"Where is your company?\" asked the old knight. \"I suppose you two have come to explore the land. Well, your mother still lives, and if she knew you to be living would be beside herself with joy.\"  \"Blessed be the day that I and my men landed here,\" said Horn. \"We will catch these heathen dogs, or else tame them. We will speak to them in our own language.\"  Then Horn blew his horn, so that all on board the ship heard it and came on shore. As the young birds long for the dawn, so Horn longed for the fight that should free his country from her enemies. From morning to night the battle raged, till all the heathen, young and old, were slain, and young King Horn himself slew the pirate King. Then he went to church, with all his people, and an anthem was sung to the glory of God, and Horn gave thanks aloud for the restoration of his kingdom, after which he sought the place where his mother dwelt. How his heart wept for joy when he saw her! He placed a crown on her head, and arrayed her in rich robes, and brought her up to the palace. \"Thou art glad to have thy child again,\" he said to her in the joy of his heart, \"but I will make thee gladder still by bringing thee home a daughter, one who will please thee well.\" And he thought of his love, Riminild, with whom, however, things were just then going very much amiss.  For as son as Horn had departed, the treacherous Figold had collected a great army of workmen and made them build him a tower in the sea, which could only be reached when the tide was out. Now about this time Horn had a dream, in which he saw Riminild on board a ship at sea, which presently went to pieces, and she tried to swim ashore, steering with her lily-white hand, while Figold, the traitor, sought to stop her with the point of his sword. Then he awoke and cried, \"Athulf, true friend, we must away across the sea. Unless we make all speed some evil will befall us.\" And in the midst of a storm they set sail.  In the meantime Figold had left his tower and appeared in the presence of King Aylmer. Cunningly, out of his false heart spoke the traitor, \"King Aylmer, Horn has sent me word that he would have his bride handed over to my care. He has regained his crown and realm and would fain have her there to be his Queen.\"  \"Very well,\" said the King, \"let her go with thee.\"  But Riminild was much displeased at the thought of being put into the hands of Figold, whom in her soul she would not trust.  \"Why comes not Horn for me himself?\" she asked. \"I know not the way to his kingdom either by land or by sea.\"  \"But I know it,\" said Figold, \"and I will soon bring thee thither, most beauteous queen.\" But his wicked smile made her uneasy at heart.  \"If Horn could not come himself,\" she said, \"why did he not send Athulf, his faithful friend?\" But this question pleased the traitor so little that he gave her no answer.  Her father blessed her, and she set forth, wringing her white hands.  Meanwhile, Horn, sailing from the south, was driven in shore by a storm, and he beheld Figold's high tower, and asked who had built such an ugly thing. He thought he heard a low murmuring as his ship flew past it before the wind, but knew not what it might be. Soon he saw the battlements of King Aylmer's palace rising in the distance; there Riminild should be, looking out for him, but all was bare and empty. It seemed to him as though a star were missing from heaven; and as he crossed the threshold the ill news was told him how Figold had carried off Riminild. Horn had no mind to linger with the King. \"Come, Athulf, true friend,\" said he, \"and help me to search for her.\" So they searched far and near, in vain, till at last Horn remembered that strange tower in the sea, and set sail for the lonely fortress where Figold had the fair princess in his evil keeping. \"Now, my eleven companions, and you, too, Athulf,\" said he, \"abide here while I go up alone with my horn. God hath shown me how to order this attempt.\"  He left his sword on the ship, and took only a fishing line with a long hook. Then round and round the tower he walked, and he blew a loud blast out into the raging storm, until a head appeared out of a hole in the wall of the tower--it was that wicked knave Figold's; and Horn cast his line, and hauled the writhing traitor clean out of the tower. He whirled round the sea wolf at the end of the line, and swung him over the water by the sheer force of his arm, so that he was cast over to Athulf in the ship; and sore afraid was the traitor when the true men on board seized him.  Then Horn took up his bugle once more and sounded it so loudly that at the first blast the door was uncovered; at the second he could enter the tower; the third was heard as he led Riminild forth. Lightly did he clasp her round the waist and swing her into his boat, and then pulled for the ship.  He brought Riminild on board his ship, and called to his band, \"Ho there, my trusty eleven! Our voyage is ended, and we will now go merrily home. And you, Athulf, my chosen and tried friend, shall now have your guerdon; I will bring you to your bride Swanhild, and Riminild and I will be wedded at the same time--the same wedding feast shall serve us both.  \"And Riminild, my sweet pearl, whom I have rescued from the deep, not all that I have suffered on your account grieves me like the perfidy this false one wrought on you, my loving heart. Through him the goodly tale of my twelve followers is broken; now when they gather round the table, one seat will ever be empty. Must it ever be that no dozen of men can be got together but one will prove a traitor?\"  Then he bade them \"Set the traitor in the boat and let it drift out to sea, as we poor children were made to do aforetime. Let the waves bear away treachery as once they bore innocence--our ship will make better speed; and as for him, let him drift till he find a land where no traitors are.\"     CHAPTER IV  SIR GALAHAD     My good blade carves the"]]]
