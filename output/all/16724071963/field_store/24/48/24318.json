Doggedly still he laboured; point by point, Crept on, with aching heart and burning brain, Until his table of the stars had reached The thousand that he hoped, to crown his toil. But Christine heard him murmuring in the night, \"The work, the work! Not to have lived in vain! Into whose hands can I entrust it all? I thought to find him standing by the way, Waiting to seize the splendour from my hand, The swift, young-eyed runner with the torch. Let me not live in vain, let me not fall Before I yield it to the appointed soul.\" And yet the Power that made and broke him heard: For, on a certain day, to Tycho came Another exile, guided through the dark Of Europe by the starlight in his eyes, Or that invisible hand which guides the world. He asked him, as the runner with the torch Alone could ask, asked as a natural right For Tycho's hard-won life-work, those results, His tables of the stars. He gave his name Almost as one who told him, _It is I;_ And yet unconscious that he told; a name Not famous yet, though truth had marked him out Already, by his exile, as her own,-- The name of Johann Kepler.                            \"It was strange,\" Wrote Kepler, not long after, \"for I asked Unheard-of things, and yet he gave them to me As if I were his son. When first I saw him, We seemed to have known each other years ago In some forgotten world. I could not guess That Tycho Brahe was dying. He was quick Of temper, and we quarrelled now and then, Only to find ourselves more closely bound Than ever. I believe that Tycho died Simply of heartache for his native land. For though he always met me with a smile, Or jest upon his lips, he could not sleep Or work, and often unawares I caught Odd little whispered phrases on his lips As if he talked to himself, in a kind of dream. Yet I believe the clouds dispersed a little Around his death-bed, and with that strange joy Which comes in death, he saw the unchanging stars. Christine was there. She held him in her arms. I think, too, that he knew his work was safe. An hour before he died, he smiled at me, And whispered,--what he meant I hardly know-- Perhaps a broken echo from the past, A fragment of some old familiar thought, And yet I seemed to know. It haunts me still: _'Come then, swift-footed, let me see you stand, Waiting before me, crowned with youth and joy; This is the turning. Take it from my hand. For I am ready, ready now, to fall.'\"_     III  KEPLER   John Kepler, from the chimney corner, watched His wife Susannah, with her sleeves rolled back Making a salad in a big blue bowl. The thick tufts of his black rebellious hair Brushed into sleek submission; his trim beard Snug as the soft round body of a thrush Between the white wings of his fan-shaped ruff (His best, with the fine lace border) spoke of guests Expected; and his quick grey humorous eyes, His firm red whimsical pleasure-loving mouth, And all those elvish twinklings of his face, Were lit with eagerness. Only between his brows, Perplexed beneath that subtle load of dreams, Two delicate shadows brooded.                               \"What does it mean? Sir Henry Wotton's letter breathed a hint That Italy is prohibiting my book,\" He muttered. \"Then, if Austria damns it too, Susannah mine, we may be forced to choose Between the truth and exile. When he comes, He'll tell me more. Ambassadors, I suppose, Can only write in cipher, while our world Is steered to heaven by murderers and thieves; But, if he'd wrapped his friendly warnings up In a verse or two, I might have done more work These last three days, eh, Sue?\"                                  \"Look, John,\" said she, \"What beautiful hearts of lettuce! Tell me now How shall I mix it? Will your English guest Turn up his nose at dandelion leaves As crisp and young as these? They've just the tang Of bitterness in their milk that gives a relish And makes all sweet; and that's philosophy, John. Now--these spring onions! Would his Excellency Like sugared rose-leaves better?\"                                   \"He's a poet, Not an ambassador only, so I think He'll like a cottage salad.\"                              \"A poet, John! I hate their arrogant little insect ways! I'll put a toadstool in.\"                           \"Poets, dear heart, Can be divided into two clear kinds,-- One that, by virtue of a half-grown brain, Lives in a silly world of his own making, A bubble, blown by himself, in which he flits And dizzily bombinates, chanting 'I, I, I,' For there is nothing in the heavens above Or the earth, or hell beneath, but goes to swell His personal pronoun. Bring him some dreadful news His dearest friend is burned to death,--You'll see The monstrous insect strike an attitude And shape himself into one capital I, A rubric, with red eyes. You'll see him use The coffin for his pedestal, hear him mouth His 'I, I, I' instructing haggard grief Concerning his odd ego. Does he chirp Of love, it's 'I, I, I' Narcissus, love, Myself, Narcissus, imaged in those eyes; For all the love-notes that he sounds are made After the fashion of passionate grasshoppers, By grating one hind-leg across another. Nor does he learn to sound that mellower 'You,' Until his bubble bursts and leaves him drowned, An insect in a soap-sud. But there's another kind, whose mind still moves In vital concord with the soul of things; So that it thinks in music, and its thoughts Pulse into natural song. A separate voice, And yet caught up by the surrounding choirs, There, in the harmonies of the Universe, Losing himself, he saves his soul alive.\" \"John, I'm afraid!\"--                       \"Afraid of what, Susannah?\"-- \"Afraid to put those Ducklings on to roast. Your friend may miss his road; and, if he's late, My little part of the music will be spoiled.\"-- \"He won't, Susannah. Bad poets are always late. Good poets, at times, delay a note or two; But all the great are punctual as the sun. What's that? He's early! That's his knock, I think!\"-- \"The Lord have mercy, John, there's nothing ready! Take him into your study and talk to him, Talk hard. He's come an hour before his time; And I've to change my dress. I'll into the kitchen!\"  Then, in a moment, all the cottage rang With greetings; hand grasped hand; his Excellency Forgot the careful prologue he'd prepared, And made an end of mystery. He had brought A message from his wisdom-loving king Who, hearing of new menaces to the light In Europe, urged the illustrious Kepler now To make his home in England. There, his thought And speech would both be free.                                \"My friend,\" said Wotton, \"I have moved in those old strongholds of the night, And heard strange mutterings. It is not many years Since Bruno burned. There's trouble brewing too, For one you know, I think,--the Florentine Who made that curious optic tube.\"--                                      \"You mean The man at Padua, Galileo?\"--                               \"Yes.\" \"They will not dare or need. Proof or disproof Rests with their eyes.\"--                           \"Kepler, have you not heard Of those who, fifteen hundred years ago, Had eyes and would not see? Eyes quickly close When souls prefer the dark.\"-- \"So be it. Other and younger eyes will see. Perhaps that's why God gave the young a spice Of devilry. They'll go look, while elders gasp; And, when the Devil and Truth go hand in hand, God help their enemies. You will send my thanks, My grateful thanks, Sir Henry, to your king. To-day I cannot answer you. I must think. It would be very difficult My wife Would find it hard to leave her native land. Say nothing yet before her.\"                              Then, to hide Their secret from Susannah, Kepler poured His mind out, and the world's dead branches bloomed. For, when he talked, another spring began To which our May was winter; and, in the boughs Of his delicious thoughts, like feathered choirs, Bits of old rhyme, scraps from the Sabine farm, Celestial phrases from the Shepherd King, And fluttering morsels from Catullus sang. Much was fantastic. All was touched with light That only genius knows to steal from heaven. He spoke of poetry, as the \"flowering time Of knowledge,\" called it \"thought in passionate tune With those great rhythms that steer the moon and sun; Thought in such concord with the soul of things That it can only move, like tides and stars, And man's own beating heart, and the wings of birds, In law, whose service only sets them free.\" Therefore it often leaps to the truth we seek, Clasping it, as a lover clasps his bride In darkness, ere the sage can light his lamp. And so, in music, men might find the road To truth, at many a point, where sages grope. One day, a greater Plato would arise To write a new philosophy, he said, Showing how music is the golden clue To all the windings of the world's dark maze. Himself had used it, partly proved it, too, In his own book,--_the Harmonies of the World._ 'All that the years discover points one way To this great ordered harmony,\" he said, \"Revealed on earth by music. Planets move In subtle accord like notes of one great song Audible only to the Artificer, The Eternal Artist. There's no grief, no pain, But music--follow it simply as a clue, A microcosmic pattern of the whole-- Can show you, somewhere in its golden scheme, The use of all such discords; and, at last, Their exquisite solution. Then darkness breaks Into diviner light, love's agony climbs Through death to life, and evil builds up heaven. Have you not heard, in some great symphony, Those golden mathematics making clear The victory of the soul? Have you not heard The very heavens opening?                           Do those fools Who thought me an infidel then, still smile at me For trying to read the stars in terms of song, Discern their orbits, measure their distances, By musical proportions? Let them smile, My folly at least revealed those three"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6574"],["title","Watchers of the Sky (#8)"],["body","laws; Gave me the golden vases of the Egyptians, To set in the great new temple of my God Beyond the bounds of Egypt.                             They will forget My methods, doubtless, as the years go by, And the world's wisdom shuts its music out. The dust will gather on all my harmonies; Or scholars turn my pages listlessly, Glance at the musical phrases, and pass on, Not troubling even to read one Latin page. Yet they'll accept those great results as mine. I call them mine. How can I help exulting, Who climbed my ladder of music to the skies And found, by accident, let them call it so, Or by the inspiration of that Power Which built His world of music, those three laws:-- First, how the speed of planets round the sun Bears a proportion, beautifully precise As music, to their silver distances; Next, that although they seem to swerve aside From those plain circles of old Copernicus Their paths were not less rhythmical and exact, But followed always that most exquisite curve In its most perfect form, the pure ellipse; Third, that although their speed from point to point Appeared to change, their radii always moved Through equal fields of space in equal times. Was this my infidelity, was this Less full of beauty, less divine in truth, Than their dull chaos? You, the poet will know How, as those dark perplexities grew clear, And old anomalous discords changed to song, My whole soul bowed and cried, _Almighty God These are Thy thoughts, I am thinking after Thee!_ I hope that Tycho knows. I owed so much To Tycho Brahe; for it was he who built The towers from which I hailed those three great laws. How strange and far away it all seems now. The thistles grow upon that little isle Where Tycho's great Uraniborg once was. Yet, for a few sad years, before it fell Into decay and ruin, there was one Who crept about its crumbling corridors, And lit the fire of memory on its hearth.\"-- Wotton looked quickly up, \"I think I have heard Something of that. You mean poor Jeppe, his dwarf. Fynes Moryson, at the Mermaid Inn one night Showed a most curious manuscript, a scrawl On yellow parchment, crusted here and there With sea-salt, or the salt of those thick tears Creatures like Jeppe, the crooked dwarf, could weep. It had been found, clasped in a crooked hand, Under the cliffs of Wheen, a crooked hand That many a time had beckoned to passing ships, Hoping to find some voyager who would take A letter to its master.                         The sailors laughed And jeered at him, till Jeppe threw stones at them. And now Jeppe, too, was dead, and one who knew Fynes Moryson, had found him, and brought home That curious crooked scrawl. Fynes Englished it Out of its barbarous Danish. Thus it ran: 'Master, have you forgotten Jeppe, your dwarf, Who used to lie beside the big log-fire And feed from your own hand? The hall is dark, There are no voices now,--only the wind And the sea-gulls crying round Uraniborg. I too am crying, Master, even I, Because there is no fire upon the hearth, No light in any window. It is night, And all the faces that I knew are gone.  Master, I watched you leaving us. I saw The white sails dwindling into sea-gull's wings, Then melting into foam, and all was dark. I lay among the wild flowers on the cliff And dug my nails into the stiff white chalk And called you, Tycho Brahe. You did not hear; But gulls and jackdaws, wheeling round my head, Mocked me with _Tycho Brahe_, and _Tycho Brahe_!  You were a great magician, Tycho Brahe; And, now that they have driven you away, I, that am only Jeppe,--the crooked dwarf, You used to laugh at for his matted hair, And head too big and heavy--take your pen Here in your study. I will write it down And send it by a sailor to the King Of Scotland, and who knows, the mouse that gnawed The lion free, may save you, Tycho Brahe.'\" \"He is free now,\" said Kepler, \"had he lived He would have sent for Jeppe to join him there At Prague. But death forestalled him, and your King. The years in which he watched that planet Mars, His patient notes and records, all were mine; And, mark you, had he clipped or trimmed one fact By even a hair's-breadth, so that his results Made a pure circle of that planet's path It might have baffled us for an age and drowned All our new light in darkness. But he held To what he saw. He might so easily, So comfortably have said, 'My instruments Are crude and fallible. In so fine a point Eyes may have erred, too. Why not acquiesce? Why mar the tune, why dislocate a world, For one slight clash of seeming fact with faith?' But no, though stars might swerve, he held his course, Recording only what his eyes could see Until death closed them.                          Then, to his results, I added mine and saw, in one wild gleam, Strange as the light of day to one born blind, A subtler concord ruling them and heard Profounder tones of harmony resolve Those broken melodies into song again.\"-- \"Faintly and far away, I, too, have seen In music, and in verse, that golden clue Whereof you speak,\" said Wotton. \"In all true song, There is a hidden logic. Even the rhyme That, in bad poets, wrings the neck of thought, Is like a subtle calculus to the true, An instrument of discovery. It reveals New harmonies, new analogies. It links Far things and near, not in unnatural chains, But in those true accords which still escape The plodding reason, yet unify the world. I caught some glimpses of this mystic power In verses of your own, that elegy On Tycho, and that great quatrain of yours-- I cannot quite recall the Latin words, But made it roughly mine in words like these:  _'I know that I am dust, and daily die;   Yet, as I trace those rhythmic spheres at night, I stand before the Thunderer's throne on high   And feast on nectar in the halls of light.'_  My version lacks the glory of your lines But...\"         \"Mine too was a version,\"   Kepler laughed, \"Turned into Latin from old Ptolemy's Greek; For, even in verse, half of the joy, I think, Is just to pass the torch from hand to hand An undimmed splendour. But, last night, I tried Some music all my own. I had a dream That I was wandering in some distant world. I have often dreamed it Once it was the moon. I wrote that down in prose. When I am dead, It may be printed. This was a fairer dream: For I was walking in a far-off spring Upon the planet, Venus. Only verse Could spread true wings for that delicious world; And so I wrote it--for no eyes but mine, Or 'twould be seized on, doubtless, as fresh proof Of poor old Kepler's madness.\"--                                  \"Let me hear, Madman to madman; for I, too, write verse.\" Then Kepler, in a rhythmic murmur, breathed His rich enchanted memories of that dream:  \"Beauty burned before me    Swinging a lanthorn through that fragrant night.  I followed a distant singing,    And a dreaming light  How she led me, I cannot tell    To that strange world afar,  Nor how I walked, in that wild glen    Upon the sunset star.   Winged creatures floated    Under those rose-red boughs of violet bloom,  With delicate forms unknown on Earth    'Twixt irised plume and plume;  Human-hearted, angel-eyed,    And crowned with unknown flowers;  For nothing in that enchanted world    Followed the way of ours.   Only I saw that Beauty,    On Hesper, as on earth, still held command;  And though, as one in slumber,    I roamed that radiant land,  With all these earth-born senses sealed    To what the Hesperians knew,  The faithful lanthorn of her law    Was mine on Hesper too.   Then, half at home with wonder,    I saw strange flocks of flowers like birds take flight;  Great trees that burned like opals    To lure their loves at night;  Dark beings that could move in realms    No dream of ours has known.  Till these became as common things    As men account their own.   Yet, when that lanthorn led me    Back to the world where once I thought me wise;  I saw, on this my planet,    What souls, with awful eyes.  Hardly I dared to walk her fields    As in that strange re-birth  I looked on those wild miracles    The birds and flowers of earth.\"  Silence a moment held them, loth to break The spell of that strange dream,                                  \"One proof the more\" Said Wotton at last, \"that songs can mount and fly To truth; for this fantastic vision of yours Of life in other spheres, awakes in me, Either that slumbering knowledge of Socrates, Or some strange premonition that the years Will prove it true. This music leads us far From all our creeds, except that faith in law. Your quest for knowledge--how it rests on that! How sure the soul is that if truth destroy The temple, in three days the truth will build A nobler temple; and that order reigns In all things. Even your atheist builds his doubt On that strange faith; destroys his heaven and God In absolute faith that his own thought is true To law, God's lanthorn to our stumbling feet; And so, despite himself, he worships God, For where true souls are, there are God and heaven.\"--  \"It is an ancient wisdom. Long ago,\" Said Kepler, \"under the glittering Eastern sky, The shepherd king looked up at those great stars, Those ordered hosts, and cried _Caeli narrant Gloriam Dei!_                  Though there be some to-day Who'd ape Lucretius, and believe themselves Epicureans, little they know of him Who, even in utter darkness, bowed his head, To something nobler than the gods of Rome Reigning beyond the darkness.                               They accept The law, the music of these ordered worlds; And straight deny the law's first postulate, That out of nothingness nothing can be born, Nor greater things from less. Can music rise By chance from chaos, as they said that star In Serpentarius rose? I told them, then, That when I was a boy, with time to spare, I played at anagrams. Out of my Latin name _Johannes Keplerus_ came that sinister phrase _Serpens in akuleo_. Struck by this, I tried again, but trusted it to chance. I took some playing cards, and "]]]
