Of course, that's all right if you're willing to work for the whole village. But I say, let others do the work! As for me, I've never put a single stick nor a single armful of mud on that dam; and what's more, I never intend to, either.  \"My tunnel in the bank suits me very well. Of course, it may not be so airy in summer as a house such as you're making for yourself. But I don't live in my house in summer. So what's the difference to me? In summer I go up the stream, or down--just as it suits me--and I see something of the world and have a fine time. There's nothing like travel, you know, to broaden one,\" said Tired Tim.  Brownie Beaver stopped just a moment and looked at the lazy fellow. He was certainly broad enough, Brownie thought. He was so fat that his sides stuck far out. But it was no wonder--for he never did any work.  \"You'd better take my advice,\" Tired Tim told Brownie.  But Brownie Beaver had returned to his wood-cutting. He didn't even stop to answer. To him, working was just fun. And building a fine house was as good as any game.     IV  THE FRESHET   The rain had fallen steadily for two days and two nights-not just a gentle drizzle, but a heavy downpour.  For some time it did not in the least disturb Brownie Beaver and his neighbors--that is to say, all but one of them. For there was a very old gentleman in the village known as Grandaddy Beaver who began to worry almost as soon as it began to rain.  \"We're a-going to have a freshet,\" he said to everybody he met. \"I've seen 'em start many a time and I can always tell a freshet almost as soon as I see it coming.\"  Grandaddy Beaver's friends paid no heed to his warning. And some of them were so unkind as to laugh when the old gentleman crawled on top of his house and began to mend it.  \"You young folks can poke fun at me if you want to,\" said Grandaddy Beaver, \"but I'm a-going right ahead and make my house as strong as I can. For when the freshet gets here I don't want my home washed away.\"  All day long people would stop to watch the old fellow at work upon his roof. And everybody thought it was a great joke--until the second day came and everybody noticed that it was raining just as hard as ever.  But no one except Grandaddy Beaver had ever heard of a freshet at that time of year. So even then nobody else went to work on his house, though some people _did_ stop smiling. A freshet, you know, is a serious thing.  As the second day passed, the rain seemed to fall harder. And still Grandaddy Beaver kept putting new sticks on the roof of his house and plastering mud over them. And at last Brownie Beaver began to think that perhaps the old gentleman was right, after all, and that maybe everybody else was wrong.  So Brownie went home and set to work. And all his neighbors at once began to smile at him.  But Brownie Beaver didn't mind that.  \"My roof needed mending, anyhow,\" he said. \"And if we _should_ have a freshet. I'll be ready for it. And if we don't have one, there'll be no harm done.\"  [Illustration: Mr. Crow Called Down the Chimney]  Now, all this time the water had been rising slowly. But that was no more than everyone expected, since it was raining so hard. But when the second night came, the water began to rise very fast. It rose so quickly that several families found their bedroom floors under water almost before they knew it.  Then old Grandaddy Beaver went through the village and stopped at every door.  \"What do you think about it now?\" he asked. \"Is it a freshet or isn't it?\"  In the houses where the water had climbed above the bedroom floors the people all agreed that it was a freshet and that Grandaddy Beaver had been right all the time. But there were still plenty of people who thought the old gentleman was mistaken.  \"The water won't come any higher,\" they said. \"It never has, at this time of year.\" But they looked a bit worried, in spite of what they said.  \"It's a-going to be the worst freshet that's happened since you were born,\" their caller croaked. \"You mark my words!\"  When he came to Brownie Beaver's house Grandaddy found that there was one person, at least, that had taken his advice.  \"I see you're all ready for the freshet!\" the old gentleman remarked. \"They laughed at me; but I was right,\" he said.  \"They laughed at me, too,\" Brownie Beaver told him.  \"There's nobody in this village that'll laugh again tonight,\" Grandaddy said very solemnly, \"for there's a-going to be a flood before morning.\"     V  BROWNIE SAVES THE DAM   Brownie Beaver was always glad that he had taken Grandaddy's advice about the freshet. And Brownie's neighbors were glad that he had, too. For that was really the only thing that saved the village from being carried away by the flood of water that swept down upon the pond, after it had rained for two days and two nights.  The pond rose so quickly and the water rushed past so fast that people had to scramble out of their houses and begin working on them, to keep them from being washed away.  That rush of water meant only one thing. The pond was full and running over! And just as likely as not the dam would be carried away--the dam on which Grandaddy Beaver had worked when he was a youngster, and on which his own grandaddy had worked before him. It would take years and years to build another such dam as that.  Now, with almost everybody working on his own house, there was almost no one left to work upon the dam. But people never stopped to think about that. They never once remembered that out of the whole village old Grandaddy and Brownie Beaver were the only persons whose houses had been made ready for the freshet and that those two were the only people with nothing to do at home.  \"There'll be plenty to help save the dam,\" everybody said to himself. \"I'll just work on my house.\"  Now, Brownie Beaver knew that there was nothing more he could do to make his house safe, so he swam over to the dam, expecting to find a good many of his neighbors there. But old Grandaddy Beaver was the only other person he found. And he seemed worried.  \"It's a great pity!\" he said to Brownie. \"Here's this fine dam, which has taken so many years to build, and it's a-going to be washed away--you mark my words!\"  \"What makes you think that?\" asked Brownie.  \"There's nobody here to do anything,\" said Grandaddy Beaver. \"The spillways of this dam ought to be made as big as possible, to let the freshet pass through. But I can't do it, for I can't swim as well as I could once.\"  Brownie Beaver looked at the rushing water which poured over the top of the dam in a hundred places and was already carrying off mud and sticks, eating the dam away before his very eyes.  \"I'll save the dam!\" he cried. \"You?\" Grandaddy Beaver exclaimed. \"Why, what do you think you can do?\" Being so old, he couldn't help believing that other people were too young to do difficult things.  \"Watch me and I'll show you!\" Brownie Beaver told him. And without saying another word he swam to the nearest spillway and began making it bigger.  Sometimes he had to fight the freshet madly, to keep from being swept over the dam himself. Sometimes, too, as he stood on the dam it crumbled beneath him and he found himself swimming again.  How many narrow escapes he had that day Brownie Beaver could never remember. When they happened, he didn't have time to count them, he was working so busily. And if old Grandaddy Beaver hadn't told everyone afterward, how Brownie saved the great dam from being swept away, and how hard he had worked, and how he had swum fearlessly into the torrent, people wouldn't have known anything about it.  To be sure, they had noticed that the water went down almost as suddenly as it rose. But they hadn't stopped to think that there must have been some reason for that. And when they learned that Brownie Beaver was the reason, the whole village gave him a vote of thanks.  They wanted to give him a gold-headed cane, too. But they were unable to find one anywhere.  When Brownie Beaver heard of that he said it was just as well, because he seldom walked far on land and there wasn't much use in a person's carrying a cane when he swam, anyhow. Although it was sometimes done, he had always considered it a silly practice--and one that he would not care to follow.     VI  A HAPPY THOUGHT   Brownie Beaver liked to know what was going on in the world. But living far from Pleasant Valley as he did, he seldom heard any news before it was quite old.  \"I wish--\" he said to Mr. Crow one day, when that old gentleman was making him a visit--\"I wish someone would start a newspaper in this neighborhood.\"  Mr. Crow told Brownie that he would be glad to bring him an old newspaper whenever he happened to find one. \"Thank you!\" Brownie Beaver said. \"You're very kind. But an old newspaper would be of no use to me.\"  \"Why not?\" Mr. Crow inquired. \"They make very good beds, I've been told. And I suppose that is what you want one for.\"  \"Not at all!\" Brownie replied. \"I'd like to know what's happening over in Pleasant Valley. It takes so long for news to reach us here in our pond that it's often hardly worth listening to when we hear it--it's so old. Now, what I'd really prefer is a newspaper that would tell me everything that's going to happen a week later.\"  Mr. Crow said he never heard of a newspaper like that.  \"Well, somebody ought to start one,\" Brownie Beaver answered.  Mr. Crow thought deeply for some minutes without saying a word. And at last He cried suddenly:  \"I have an idea!\"  \"Have you?\" Brownie Beaver exclaimed. \"What is it, Mr. Crow?\"  \"I'll be your newspaper!\" Mr. Crow told him.  At that Brownie Beaver looked somewhat doubtful.  \"That's very kind of you,\" he said. \"But I'm afraid it wouldn't do me much good. You're so black that the ink wouldn't show on you at all---unless,\" he added, \"they use _white_ ink to print on you.\"  \"You don't understand,\" old Mr. Crow said. \"What I mean is this: I'll fly over here once a week and tell you everything "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6754"],["title","The Tale of Brownie Beaver (#2)"],["body","that's happened. Of course,\" he continued, \"I can't very well tell you everything that is going to take place the following week. But I'll do my best.\"  Brownie Beaver was delighted. And when Mr. Crow asked him what day he wanted his newspaper Brownie said that Saturday afternoon would be a good time.  \"That's the last day of the week,\" Brownie Beaver remarked, \"so you ought to have plenty of news for me. You know, if you came the first day of the week there would be very little to tell.\"  \"That's so!\" said Mr. Crow. \"Well say 'Saturday,' then. And you shall have your newspaper without fail--unless,\" he explained--\"unless there should be a bad storm, or unless I should be ill. And, of course, if Farmer Green should want me to help him in his cornfield, I wouldn't be able to come. There might be other things, too, to keep me at home, which I can't think of just now,\" said Mr. Crow.  Again Brownie Beaver looked a bit doubtful.  \"I hope you'll try to be regular,\" he told Mr. Crow. \"When a person takes a newspaper he doesn't like to be disappointed, you know.\"  Old Mr. Crow said that he hoped nothing would prevent his coming to Brownie's house every Saturday afternoon.  \"There's only one more thing I can think of,\" he croaked, \"that would make it impossible for me to be here. And that is if I should lose count of the days of the week or have to see a baseball game or fly south for the winter.\"  \"But that's _three_ things, instead of only _one_,\" Brownie Beaver objected.  \"Well--maybe it is,\" Mr. Crow replied--\"the way you count. But I call it only one because I said it all in one breath, without a single pause.\"  \"I hope you won't tell me the news as fast as that,\" said Brownie Beaver, \"for if you did I should never be able to remember one-half of it.\"  But Mr. Crow promised that he would talk very slowly.  \"You'll be perfectly satisfied,\" he told Brownie. \"And now I must go home at once, to begin gathering news.\"     VII  A NEWFANGLED NEWSPAPER   After Mr. Crow flew back to Pleasant Valley to gather news for him, Brownie Beaver carefully counted each day that passed. Since Mr. Crow had agreed to be his newspaper, and come each Saturday afternoon to tell him everything that had happened during the week, Brownie was in a great hurry for Saturday to arrive.  In order to make no mistake, he put aside a stick in which he gnawed a notch each day. And in that way he knew exactly when Saturday came.  That was probably the longest day in Brownie Beaver's life. At least, it seemed so to him. Whenever he saw a bird soaring above the tree-tops he couldn't help hoping it was Mr. Crow. And whenever he heard a _caw_--_caw_ far off in the distance Brownie Beaver dropped whatever he happened to be doing, expecting that Mr. Crow would flap into sight at any moment.  Brownie had many disappointments. But Mr. Crow really came at last. He lighted right on top of Brownie Beaver's house and called \"Paper!\" down the chimney--just like that!  Brownie happened to be inside his house. And in a wonderfully short time his head appeared above the water and he soon crawled up beside Mr. Crow.  \"Well, I _am_ glad to see you!\" he told Mr. Crow.  \"Peter Mink caught a monstrous eel in the duck pond on Monday,\" Mr. Crow said. Being a newspaper, he thought he ought to say nothing except what was news--not even \"Good afternoon!\"  \"Mr. Rabbit, of Pine Ridge, with his wife and fourteen children, is visiting his brother, Mr. Jeremiah Rabbit. Mrs. Jeremiah Rabbit says she does not know when her husband's relations are going home,\" Mr. Crow continued to relate in a singsong voice.  \"Goodness gracious!\" Brownie Beaver exclaimed.  \"Fatty Coon--\" Mr. Crow said--\"Fatty Coon was confined to his house by illness Tuesday night. He ate too many dried apples.\"  \"Well, well!\" Brownie Beaver murmured. And he started to ask Mr. Crow a question. But Mr. Crow interrupted him with more news.  \"Mrs. Bear had a birthday on Wednesday. An enjoyable time was had by all--except the pig.\"  \"Pig?\" Brownie Beaver asked. \"What pig?\"  \"The pig they ate,\" said Mr. Crow. And he went right on talking. \"On Thursday Mr. Woodchuck went to visit his cousins in the West. Mrs. Woodchuck is worried.\"  \"What's she worried about?\" Brownie inquired.  \"She's afraid he's coming back again,\" Mr. Crow explained.  \"I _have_ heard he was lazy,\" Brownie said. \"What happened on Friday?\"  \"Tommy Fox made a visit. But he didn't have a good time at all,\" Mr. Crow reported, \"and he left faster than he came.\"  Brownie Beaver wanted to know where Tommy Fox made his visit.  \"At Farmer Green's hen-house,\" Mr. Crow explained.  \"Why did he hurry away?\" Brownie asked.  \"Old dog Spot chased him,\" Mr. Crow replied. \"But you mustn't ask questions,\" he complained. \"You can't ask questions of a newspaper, you know.\"  \"Well--what happened on Saturday?\"  \"There you go again!\" cried Mr. Crow. \"Another question! I declare, I don't believe you ever took a newspaper before--did you?\"  Brownie Beaver admitted that he never had.  \"Then--\" said Mr. Crow--\"then don't interrupt me again, please! I'll tell you all the news I've brought. And when I've finished I'll stop being a newspaper and be myself for a while. And then we can talk. But not before!\" he insisted.  Brownie Beaver nodded his head. He was afraid that if he said another word Mr. Crow would grow angry and fly away without telling him any more news.  \"On Saturday--this morning, to be exact\"--said Mr. Crow, \"there came near being a bad accident. Jimmy Rabbit almost cut off Frisky Squirrel's tail.\"  Mr. Crow paused and looked at Brownie Beaver out of the corner of his eye. He knew that Brownie would want to know what prevented the accident. But he was in no hurry to tell him.  For a few moments Brownie waited to hear the rest. But a few moments was more than he could endure.  \"Why didn't Jimmy cut off his tail?\" Brownie asked eagerly.  \"There!\" said Mr. Crow. \"You've done just as I told you not to. So I shall not tell you the rest until next Saturday.... You see, you have a few things to learn about taking a newspaper.\" And 'he would give Brownie no more news that day. To be sure, he was willing to talk--but only about things that had happened where Brownie Beaver lived.     VIII  MR. CROW IS UPSET   Brownie Beaver couldn't help feeling that Mr. Crow had not treated him very well, because Mr. Crow hadn't told him all the news about Frisky Squirrel's tail. He thought that maybe there were things about a newspaper that even Mr. Crow didn't know.  Another week had passed. Brownie knew that it had, because since Mr. Crow's last call he had cut a notch in a stick each day. And there were now seven of them.  Late Saturday afternoon Mr. Crow came back again. He lighted on top of Brownie's house and called \"Paper!\" down the chimney, just as he had a week before.  Brownie Beaver came swimming up once more.  \"Look here!\" he said to Mr. Crow. \"I don't believe yon know much about being a newspaper, do you?\"  That surprised Mr. Crow.  \"What do you mean?\" he asked.  \"A newspaper--\" said Brownie Beaver--\"a newspaper is always left on, a person's doorstep. I've talked with a good many people and not one of them ever heard of a paper being left on the roof.\"  Mr. Crow's face seemed to grow blacker than ever, he was so angry.  \"How can anybody leave a newspaper on your doorstep, when the step's under water?\" he growled.  Brownie Beaver did not answer that question, for he had something else to say to Mr. Crow.  \"I've talked with a good many people,\" he said once more, \"and not one of them ever heard of such rudeness as _shouting down a person's chimney_. If there was anybody asleep in the house, it would certainly wake him; and if a person had a fire in his house, shouting down the chimney might put it out.\"  Mr. Crow looked rather foolish.  \"I'll try to think of some way of leaving your newspaper that will suit us both,\" he said. Then he _hemmed_ and began to tell Brownie the week's news.  \"On Sunday,\" said Mr. Crow, \"there was a freshet.\"  \"I knew that before you did,\" said Brownie Beaver.  Mr. Crow looked disappointed.  \"How?\" he asked.  \"Why, I live further up the river than you,\" said Brownie Beaver. \"And since freshets always come _down_ a river, this one didn't reach you till after it had passed me.\"  Something made Mr. Crow peevish.  \"I don't believe you'd care to hear any more of my news,\" he said. \"You appear to know it already. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to tell me the sort of news you prefer to hear.\"  \"Certainly!\" Brownie Beaver replied. \"Now, there's the weather! I've talked with a good many people and they all say that a good newspaper ought to tell the weather for the next day.\"  Mr. Crow cocked an eye up at the sky.  \"To-morrow will be fair,\" he said.  \"I'm told that a good newspaper ought to tell a few jokes,\" Brownie Beaver continued.  But Mr. Crow sneered openly at that. \"I'm a _newspaper_--not a _jest-book_,\" he announced.  \"Then you refuse to tell any jokes, do you?\" Brownie Beaver asked him.  \"I certainly do!\" Mr. Crow cried indignantly.  \"Very well!\" Brownie said. \"I see I'll have to take some other newspaper, though I must say I hate to change--after taking this one so long.\"  \"I hope you'll find one to suit you,\" Mr. Crow said in a cross voice. And he flew away without another word. He was terribly upset. You see, he had enjoyed being a newspaper, because it gave him an excuse for asking people the most inquisitive questions. He had intended all that week to ask Aunt Polly Woodchuck whether she wore a wig. But he hadn't been able to find her at home. And now it was too late--for Mr. Crow was a newspaper no longer.  As for Brownie Beaver, he succeeded in getting Jasper Jay to be his newspaper. Though Jasper told him many jokes, Brownie found that he could not depend upon Jasper's news. And as a matter of fact, Jasper made up most of it himself. He claimed that the _newest news_ was the best.  \"That's why I invent it myself, right on the spot,\" he explained. "]]]
