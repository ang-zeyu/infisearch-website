CLARIN.      News? Yes, sir, since your great compassion Is disposed Rosaura's outrage To revenge, she has changed her habit, And resumed her proper dress.  CLOTALDO.  'Tis quite right, lest possible scandal Might arise.  CLARIN.      More news:  her name Having changed and wisely bartered For your niece's name, she now So in honour has advanced her, That among Estrella's ladies She here with her in the palace Lives.  CLOTALDO.      'Tis right that I once more Should her honour re-establish.  CLARIN.  News; that anxiously she waiteth For that very thing to happen, When you may have time to try it.  CLOTALDO.  Most discreetly has she acted; Soon the time will come, believe me, Happily to end this matter.  CLARIN.  News, too; that she's well regaled, Feasted like a queen, and flattered On the strength of being your niece. And the last news, and the saddest, Is that I who here came with her Am with hunger almost famished. None remember me, or think I am Clarin, clarion rather, And that if that clarion sounded, All the Court would know what passes. For there are two things, to wit, A brass clarion and a lackey, That are bad at keeping secrets; And it so may chance, if haply I am forced to break my silence, They of me may sing this passage: \"Never, when the day is near, Does clarion sound more clear.\"*   *[footnote] *\"Clarin, que rompe el albor, No suena mejor.\"-- This is a quotation by Calderon from his own drama, \"En esta vida todo es verdad y todo mentira.\" -- Act 2, sc. x.   CLOTALDO.  Your complaint is too well-founded; I will get you satisfaction, Meanwhile you may wait on me.  CLARIN.  See, sir, Sigismund advances.          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE III.  [Music and song.]  SIGISMUND enters, lost in amazement.  Servants minister to him, presenting costly robes. --CLOTALDO, and CLARIN.  SIGISMUND.  Help me, Heaven, what's this I see! Help me, Heaven, what's this I view! Things I scarce believe are true, But, if true, which fright not me. I in palaces of state? I 'neath silks and cloth of gold? I, around me, to behold Rich-robed servants watch and wait? I so soft a bed to press While sweet sleep my senses bowed? I to wake in such a crowd, Who assist me even to dress? 'Twere deceit to say I dream, Waking I recall my lot, I am Sigismund, am I not? Heaven make plain what dark doth seem! Tell me, what has phantasy -- Wild, misleading, dream-adept -- So effected while I slept, That I still the phantoms see? But let that be as it may, Why perplex myself and brood? Better taste the present good, Come what will some other day.  FIRST SERVANT [aside to the' Second Servant, and to CLARIN].  What a sadness doth oppress him!  SECOND SERVANT.  Who in such-like case would be Less surprised and sad than he?  CLARIN.  I for one.  SECOND SERVANT [to the First].  You had best address him.  FIRST SERVANT [to SIGISMUND].      May they sing again?  SIGISMUND.            No, no; I don't care to hear them sing.  SECOND SERVANT.  I conceived the song might bring To your thought some ease.  SIGISMUND.      Not so; Voiced that but charm the ear Cannot soothe my sorrow's pain; 'Tis the soldier's martial strain That alone I love to hear.  CLOTALDO.  May your Highness, mighty Prince, Deign to let me kiss your hand, I would first of all this land My profound respect evince.  SIGISMUND [aside].  'Tis my gaoler! how can he Change his harshness and neglect To this language of respect? What can have occurred to me?  CLOTALDO.  The new state in which I find you Must create a vague surprise, Doubts unnumbered must arise To bewilder and to blind you; I would make your prospect fair, Through the maze a path would show, Thus, my lord, 'tis right you know That you are the prince and heir Of this Polish realm:  if late You lay hidden and concealed 'Twas that we were forced to yield To the stern decrees of fate, Which strange ills, I know not how, Threatened on this land to bring Should the laurel of a king Ever crown thy princely brow. Still relying on the power Of your will the stars to bind, For a man of resolute mind Can them bind how dark they lower; To this palace from your cell In your life-long turret keep They have borne you while dull sleep Held your spirit in its spell. Soon to see you and embrace Comes the King, your father, here -- He will make the rest all clear.  SIGISMUND.  Why, thou traitor vile and base, What need I to know the rest, Since it is enough to know Who I am my power to show, And the pride that fills my breast? Why this treason brought to light Has thou to thy country done, As to hide from the King's son, 'Gainst all reason and all right, This his rank?  CLOTALDO.  Oh, destiny!  SIGISMUND.  Thou the traitor's part has played 'Gainst the law; the King betrayed, And done cruel wrong to me; Thus for each distinct offence Have the law, the King, and I Thee condemned this day to die By my hands.  SECOND SERVANT.  Prince . . . .  SIGISMUND      No pretence Shall undo the debt I owe you. Catiff, hence!  By Heaven!  I say, If you dare to stop my way From the window I will throw you.  SECOND SERVANT.  Fly, Clotaldo!  CLOTALDO.      Woe to thee, In thy pride so powerful seeming, Without knowing thou art dreaming! [Exit.  SECOND SERVANT.      Think . . . .  SIGISMUND.      Away!  don't trouble me.  SECOND SERVANT.  He could not the King deny.  SIGISMUND.  Bade to do a wrongful thing He should have refused the King; And, besides, his prince was I.  SECOND SERVANT.  'Twas not his affair to try If the act was wrong or right.  SIGISMUND.  You're indifferent, black or white, Since so pertly you reply.  CLARIN.  What the Prince says is quite true, What you do is wrong, I say.  SECOND SERVANT.  Who gave you this licence, pray?  CLARIN.  No one gave; I took it.  SIGISMUND.      Who Art thou, speak?  CLARIN.  A meddling fellow, Prating, prying, fond of scrapes, General of all jackanapes, And most merry when most mellow.  SIGISMUND.  You alone in this new sphere Have amused me.  CLARIN.  That's quite true, sir, For I am the great amuser Of all Sigismunds who are here.          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE IV.  ASTOLFO, SIGISMUND, CLARIN, Servants, and Musicians.  ASTOLFO.  Thousand tunes be blest the day, Prince, that gives thee to our sight, Sun of Poland, whose glad light Makes this whole horizon gay, As when from the rosy fountains Of the dawn the stream-rays run, Since thou issuest like the sun From the bosom of the mountains! And though late do not defer With thy sovran light to shine; Round thy brow the laurel twine -- Deathless crown.  SIGISMUND.  God guard thee, sir.  ASTOLFO.  In not knowing me I o'erlook, But alone for this defect, This response that lacks respect, And due honour.  Muscovy's Duke Am I, and your cousin born, Thus my equal I regard thee.  SIGISMUND.  Did there, when I said \"God guard thee,\" Lie concealed some latent scorn? -- Then if so, now having got Thy big name, and seeing thee vexed, When thou com'st to see me next I will say God guard thee not.  SECOND SERVANT [to ASTOLFO].  Think, your Highness, if he errs Thus, his mountain birth's at fault, Every word is an assault. [To SIGISMUND.] Duke Astolfo, sir, prefers . . . .  SIGISMUND.  Tut!  his talk became a bore, Nay his act was worse than that, He presumed to wear his hat.  SECOND SERVANT.  As grandee.  SIGISMUND.  But I am more.  SECOND SERVANT.  Nevertheless respect should be Much more marked betwixt ye two Than 'twixt others.  SIGISMUND.  And pray who Asked your meddling thus with me?          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE V.  ESTRELLA. -- THE SAME.  ESTRELLA.  Welcome may your Highness be, Welcomed oft to this thy throne, Which long longing for its own Finds at length its joy in thee; Where, in spite of bygone fears, May your reign be great and bright, And your life in its long flight Count by ages, not by years.  SIGISMUND (to CLARIN).  Tell me, thou, say, who can be This supreme of loveliness -- Goddess in a woman's dress -- At whose feet divine we see Heaven its choicest gifts doth lay?-- This sweet maid?  Her name declare.  CLARIN.  'Tis your star-named* cousin fair.   [footnote] *'Estrella', which means star in Spanish.   SIGISMUND.  Nay, the sun, 'twere best to say.-- [To ESTRELLA.] Though thy sweet felicitation Adds new splendour to my throne, 'Tis for seeing thee alone That I merit gratulation; Therefore I a prize have drawn That I scarce deserved to win, And am doubly blessed therein:-- Star, that in the rosy dawn Dimmest with transcendent ray Orbs that brightest gem the blue, What is left the sun to do, When thou risest with the day?-- Give me then thy hand to kiss, In whose cup of snowy whiteness Drinks the day delicious brightness.  ESTRELLA.  What a courtly speech is this?  ASTOLFO [aside].  If he takes her hand I feel I am lost.  SECOND SERVANT [aside].  Astolfo's grief I perceive, and bring relief:-- Think, my lord, excuse my zeal, That perhaps this is too free, Since Astolfo . . . .  SIGISMUND.  Did I say Woe to him that stops my way?--  SECOND SERVANT.  What I said was just.  SIGISMUND.  To me This is tiresome and absurd. Nought is just, or good or ill, In my sight that balks my will.  SECOND SERVANT.  Why, my lord, yourself I heard Say in any righteous thing It was proper to obey.  SIGISMUND.  You must, too, have heard me say Him I would from window throw Who should tease me or defy?  SECOND SERVANT.  Men like me perhaps might show That could not be done, sir.  SIGISMUND.  No? Then, by Heaven, at least, I'll try! [He seizes him in his arms and rushes to the side.  All follow, and return immediately.]  ASTOLFO.  What is this I see?  Oh, woe!  ESTRELLA.  Oh, prevent him!  Follow me! [Exit.]  SIGISMUND.  [returning].  From the window into the sea He has fallen; I told him so.  ASTOLFO.  These strange bursts of savage malice You should regulate, if you can; Wild beasts are to civilised man As rude mountains to a palace.  SIGISMUND."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6363"],["title","Life Is a Dream (#7)"],["body","a bit of advice for that: Pause ere such bold words are said, Lest you may not have a head Upon which to hang your hat.  [Exit ASTOLFO.]          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE VI.  BASILIUS, SIGISMUND, and CLARIN.  BASILIUS.  What's all this?  SIGISMUND.  A trifling thing: One who teased and thwarted me I have just thrown into the sea.  CLARIN [to SIGISMUND].  Know, my lord, it is the King.  BASILIUS.  Ere the first day's sun hath set, Has thy coming cost a life?  SIGISMUND  Why he dared me to the strife, And I only won the bet.  BASILIUS.  Prince, my grief, indeed is great, Coming here when I had thought That admonished thou wert taught To o'ercome the stars and fate, Still to see such rage abide In the heart I hoped was free, That thy first sad act should be A most fearful homicide. How could I, by love conducted, Trust me to thine arms' embracing, When their haughty interlacing, Has already been instructed How to kill?  For who could see, Say, some dagger bare and bloody, By some wretch's heart made ruddy, But would fear it?  Who is he, Who may happen to behold On the ground the gory stain Where another man was slain But must shudder?  The most bold Yields at once to Nature's laws; Thus I, seeing in your arms The dread weapon that alarms, And the stain, must fain withdraw; And though in embraces dear I would press you to my heart, I without them must depart, For, alas! your arms I fear.  SIGISMUND.  Well, without them I must stay, As I've staid for many a year, For a father so severe, Who could treat me in this way, Whose unfeeling heart could tear me From his side even when a child, Who, a denizen of the wild, As a monster there could rear me, Any by many an artful plan Sought my death, it cannot grieve me Much his arms will not receive me Who has scarcely left me man.  BASILIUS.  Would to God it had not been Act of mine that name conferred, Then thy voice I ne'er had heard, Then thy boldness ne'er had seen.  SIGISMUND.  Did you manhood's right retain, I would then have nought to say, But to give and take away Gives me reason to complain; For although to give with grace Is the noblest act 'mongst men, To take back the gift again Is the basest of the base.  BASILIUS.  This then is thy grateful mood For my changing thy sad lot To a prince's!  SIGISMUND.  And for what Should I show my gratitude! Tyrant of my will o'erthrown, If thou hoary art and gray, Dying, what do'st give me?  Say, Do'st thou give what's not mine own? Thou'rt my father and my King, Then the pomp these walls present Comes to me by due descent As a simple, natural thing. Yes, this sunshine pleaseth me, But 'tis not through thee I bask; Nay, a reckoning I might ask For the life, love, liberty That through thee I've lost so long: Thine 'tis rather to thank me, That I do not claim from thee Compensation for my wrong.  BASILIUS.  Still untamed and uncontrolled;-- Heaven fulfils its word I feel, I to that same court appeal 'Gainst thy taunts, thou vain and bold, But although the truth thou'st heard, And now know'st thy name and race, And do'st see thee in this place, Where to all thou art preferred, Yet be warned, and on thee take Ways more mild and more beseeming, For perhaps thou art but dreaming, When it seems that thou'rt awake. [Exit.]  SIGISMUND.  Is this, then, a phantom scene? -- Do I wake in seeming show?-- No, I dream not, since I know What I am and what I've been. And although thou should'st repent thee, Remedy is now too late. Who I am I know, and fate, Howsoe'er thou should'st lament thee, Cannot take from me my right Of being born this kingdom's heir. If I saw myself erewhile Prisoned, bound, kept out of sight, 'Twas that never on my mind Dawned the truth; but now I know Who I am -- a mingled show Of the man and beast combined.          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE VII.  ROSAURA, in female attire; SIGISMUND, CLARIN, and Servants.  ROSAURA [aside.]  To wait upon Estrella I come here, And lest I meet Astolfo tremble with much fear; Clotaldo's wishes are The Duke should know me not, and from afar See me, if see he must. My honour is at stake, he says; my trust Is in Clotaldo's truth. He will protect my honour and my youth.  CLARIN [to SIGISMUND].  Of all this palace here can boast, All that you yet have seen, say which has pleased you most?  SIGISMUND.  Nothing surprised me, nothing scared, Because for everything I was prepared; But if I felt for aught, or more or less Of admiration, 'twas the loveliness Of woman; I have read Somewhere in books on which my spirit fed, That which caused God the greatest care to plan, Because in him a little world he formed, was man; But this were truer said, unless I err, Of woman, for a little heaven he made in her; She who in beauty from her birth Surpasses man as heaven surpasseth earth; Nay, more, the one I see.  ROSAURA [aside].  The Prince is here; I must this instant flee.  SIGISMUND.  Hear, woman! stay; Nor wed the western with the orient ray, Flying with rapid tread; For joined the orient rose and western red, The light and the cold gloom, The day will sink untimely to its tomb. But who is this I see?  ROSAURA [aside].  I doubt and yet believe that it is he.  SIGISMUND [aside].  This beauty I have seen Some other time.  ROSAURA [aside].  This proud, majestic mien, This form I once saw bound Within a narrow cell.  SIGISMUND [aside].  My life I have found.-- Woman, the sweetest name That man can breathe, or flattering language frame, Who art thou?  for before I see thee, I believe and I adore; Faith makes my love sublime, Persuading me we've met some other time. Fair woman, speak; my will must be obeyed.  ROSAURA.  In bright Estrella's train a hapless maid.-- [Aside.]   He must not know my name.  SIGISMUND.  The sun, say rather, of that star whose flame, However bright its blaze Is but the pale reflection of thy rays. In the fair land of flowers, The realm of sweets that lies in odorous bowers, The goddess rose I have seen By right divine of beauty reign as queen. I have seen where brightest shine Gems, the assembled glories of the mine, The brilliant throng elect the diamond king For the superior splendour it doth fling. Amid the halls of light, Where the unresting star-crowds meet at night, I have seen fair Hesper rise And take the foremost place of all the skies. And in that higher zone Where the sun calls the planets round his throne, I have seen, with sovereign sway, That he presides the oracle of the day. How, then, 'mid flowers of earth or stars of air, 'Mid stones or suns, if that which is most fair The preference gains, canst thou Before a lesser beauty bend and bow, When thine own charms compose Something more bright than sun, stone, star, or rose?          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE VIII.  CLOTALDO, who remains at the side-scene; SIGISMUND, CLARIN, and Servants.  CLOTALDO [aside].  To calm Prince Sigismund devolves on me, Because 'twas I who reared him: -- What do I see?  ROSAURA.  Thy favour, sir, I prize; To thee the silence of my speech replies; For when the reason's dull, the mind depressed, He best doth speak who keeps his silence best.  SIGISMUND.  You must not leave me.  Stay: What!  would you rob my senses of the ray Your beauteous presence gave?  ROSAURA.  That licence, from your Highness, I must crave.  SIGISMUND.  The violent efforts that you make Show that you do not ask the leave you take.  ROSAURA.  I hope to take it, if it is not given.  SIGISMUND.  You rouse my courtesy to rage, by heaven!-- In me resistance, as it were, distils A cruel poison that my patience kills.  ROSAURA.  Then though that poison may be strong, The source of fury, violence, and wrong, Potent thy patience to subdue, It dare not the respect to me that's due.  SIGISMUND.  As if to show I may, You take the terror of your charms away. For I am but too prone To attempt the impossible; I to-day have thrown Out of this window one who said, like you, I dare not do the thing I said I would do. Now just to show I can, I may throw out your honour, as the man.  CLOTALDO [aside].  More obstinate doth he grow; What course to take, O heavens!  I do not know, When wild desire, nay, crime, Perils my honour for the second time.  ROSAURA.  Not vainly, as I see, This hapless land was warned thy tyranny In fearful scandals would eventuate, In wrath and wrong, in treachery, rage and hate. But who in truth could claim Aught from a man who is but a man in name, Audacious, cruel, cold, Inhuman, proud, tyrannical and bold, 'Mong beasts a wild beast born?--  SIGISMUND.  It was to save me from such words of scorn So courteously I spoke, Thinking to bind you by a gentler yoke; But if I am in aught what you have said, Then, as God lives, I will be all you dread. Ho, there!  here leave us.  See to it at your cost, The door be locked; let no one in.  [Exeunt CLARIN and the attendants.]  ROSAURA.  I'm lost! Consider . . . .  SIGISMUND.  I'm a despot, and 'tis vain You strive to move me, or my will restrain.  CLOTALDO [aside].  Oh, what a moment! what an agony! I will go forth and stop him though I die. [He advances.]  My lord, consider, stay . . . .  SIGISMUND.  A second time you dare to cross my way. Old dotard:  do you hold My rage in such slight awe you are so bold? What brought you hither?  Speak!  CLOTALDO.  The accents of this voice, however weak, To tell you to restrain Your passions, if as King you wish to reign,-- Not to be cruel, though you deem Yourself the lord of all, for all may be a dream.  SIGISMUND.  You but provoke my rage By these old saws, the unwelcome light of age, In killing you, at least I'll see If 'tis a dream or truth.  [As he is about to draw his dagger CLOTALDO detains it, and throws himself on his knees.]  CLOTALDO.  Sole hope for me To save my life is thus to humbly kneel.  SIGISMUND.  Take your audacious hand from off my steel.  CLOTALDO.  Till some kind aid be sent, Till some one come who may your rage prevent, I will not loose my hold.  ROSAURA.  Oh, Heaven!  SIGISMUND.  I say,"]]]
