Hurriedly he took out his watch and looked at it.  \"Nine o'clock,\" he said, thoughtfully; \"they must have started back.\"  He rose, all the disgust gone from his face, and slapped Tom on the shoulder.  \"Ain't he a rich guy?\" explained Tom.  \"Never mind that,\" said Roy. \"I'm glad you told me--I'm going to show you something as sure as you're a foot high! You and I are going to have the time of our lives to-night, and _don't you forget it!_\"     CHAPTER V  CONNOVER'S PARTY    \"Quick, now, hand me the light and look out you don't trip on the wires. If they once get past Westy's house--g-o-o-d-_night!_ Just inside the garage door there you'll see a switch-turn it on. Here, take the lantern. If Westy don't get this right, we'll kill him.\"  Tom, with but the haziest idea of what was to be done, followed directions. It evidently had something to do with the mysterious \"dot flares\" and with his own mean act. These excited nocturnal activities had a certain charm, and if it wasn't mischief Roy was up to it had at least all the attractive qualities of mischief.  \"You'll see a book just inside the tent--paper covered--hand me that too, and come up yourself. Look out for the wires,\" cautioned Roy.  He opened the Scout Handbook to about the middle and laid it flat on the tower rail.  \"That's the Morse Code,\" said he, \"easy as eating ice cream when you once get the hang of it. I know it by heart but I'm going to let you read them to me so as to be sure. Better be sure than be sorry--hey? I hope they don't speed that auto till we get through with them.\"  \"Can he answer?\" ventured Tom.  \"No, they haven't got a car at Westy's and no searchlight. He brings me the message all writ, wrot, wrote out, in the morning. They've got a dandy team there, though. Cracky, I'd rather have a pair of horses than an auto any day, wouldn't you. Now be patient, Conny dear, and we'll see what we can do for you.\"  \"It's a long, long way to Tip--Hillside. Do you s'pose Westy's home yet? Oh yes, sure, he must be. Well, here we go--take the lantern and read off the ones I ask for and get them right or I'll-make you eat another plate of plum-duff! Feeding with intent to kill, hey?\"  Tom couldn't help laughing; Roy's phrases had a way of popping out like a Jack-in-the-Box.  He had a small makeshift wooden bracket which stood on a grocery box on the tower platform, and in this the auto searchlight swung.  \"Wait a second now till I give him 'Attention' and then we're off. Guess you must have seen this light from downtown, hey?\"  \"Ye-re, I wondered what'twas.\"  \"Well, here's where you find out.\"  There was a little click as he turned the switch, and then a long straight column of misty light shot up into the darkness, bisecting the heavens. Far over to the west it swung, then far to the east, while Tom watched it, fascinated. Then he heard the click of the switch again and darkness reigned, save for the myriad stars.  It wac the first time in his life that Tom had ever been charged with a real responsibility, and he waited nervously.  \"That meant, 'Get ready,'\" said Roy. \"We'll give him time to sharpen his pencil. Do you pull much of a stroke with Machelsa, the Indian spirit? She smiles a smile at me once in a while, and if you want her to see you through any kind of a stunt you just rub your cheek with one hand while you pat your forehead with the other; try it.\"  \"Can't do it, eh?\" he laughed. \"That's one of Mr. Ellsworth's stunts; he got us all started on that. You'd think the whole troop was crazy.\"  \"I know him,\" said Tom.  \"He's the worst of the lot,\" said Roy. \"Well, off we go, let's have S-call them dots and lines; some say 'dashes' but lines is quicker if you're working fast.\"  \"Tree dots,\" said Tom.  Three sudden flashes shot up into the sky, quickly, one after another.  \"Now T.\"  \"Line,\" said Tom.  The switch clicked, and the long misty column rose again, remaining for several seconds.  \"Now O.\"  \"T'ree lines,\" said Tom, getting excited.  \"Now P--and be careful--it's a big one.\"  \"I'm on de job,\" said Tom, becoming more enthusiastic as he became more sure of himself. \"Dot--line--line--dot.\"  The letter was printed on the open page of the heavens and down in Barrel Alley two of the O'Connor boys sitting on the rickety railing watched the lights and wondered what they meant.  So, across the intervening valley to Westy's home, the message was sent. The khaki-clad boy, with rolled-up sleeves, whose brown hand held the little porcelain switch, was master of the night and of the distance, and the other watched him admiringly.  Down at the Western Union office in Bridgeboro, the operator sauntered out in his shirtsleeves and smilingly watched the distant writing, which he understood.  Stop all autos send car with young folks back to Bennett's sure not practice serious.  \"Good-night,\" said Roy, and two fanlike swings of the misty column told that it was over. \"If they haven't passed Westy's yet, we win. Shake, Tom,\" he added, gayly, \"You did fine--you're a fiend at it! Wouldn't you rather be here than at Conny's party--honest?\"  \"_Would I?_\"  \"Now we'll rustle down the hill and see the bunch co'me back--if they do. Oh, cracky, don't you hope they do?\"  \"_Do I?_\" said Tom.  \"Like the Duke of Yorkshire, hey? Ever hear of him? Up the hill and down again. We'll bring the sign up for a souvenir, what do you say?\"  \"Mebbe it oughter go back where it come from,\" said Tom, slowly.  \"Guess you're right.\"  \"Ever go scout's pace?\" said Roy.  \"What's that?\"  \"Fifty running-fifty walking. Try it and you'll use no other. Come on! The kind of pace you've always wanted,\" said Roy, jogging along. \"Beware of substitutes.\"  It was just about the time when Roy was showing Tom his camp that a big touring car rolled silently up to the outer gate of the Bennett place. (The house stood well back from the road.) The car was crowded with young people of both sexes, and it was evident from their expressions of surprise and disappointment that they saw the yellow sign on the gate.  There were a few moments of debate; some one suggested tooting the horn, but another thought that might disturb the patient; one proposed going to the house door and inquiring, while still another thought it would be wiser not to. Some one said something about 'phoning in the morning; a girl remarked that the last time she saw Connover he had a headache and looked pale, and indeed Connover's general weakness, together with the epidemic which prevailed in Bridgeboro, made the appearance of the sign perfectly plausible.  The upshot was that the auto rolled away and turned into the Hillside Turnpike. Scarcely had it gone out of sight when a patch of light flickered across the lawn, the shade was drawn from a window and the figure of Mrs. Bennett appeared peering out anxiously.  Ten minutes out of Bridgeboro, as the big car silently rolled upon the Hillside Turnpike, one of its disappointed occupants (a girl) called,  \"Oh, see the searchlight!\"  \"Oh, look,\" said another.  The long, misty column was swinging across the heavens.  \"Now you see it, now you don't,\" laughed one of the fellows, as Tom's utterance of \"Dot,\" sent a sudden shaft of light into the sky and out again as quickly.  \"Where is it, do you suppose?\" asked one of the girls.  \"Does it mean anything?\" asked another.  It meant nothing to them, for there was not a scout in the car. And yet a mile or two farther along the dark road there hung a lantern on an upright stick, directly in their path, and scrawled upon a board below it was the word, \"Stop.\"  Out of the darkness stepped a figure in a white sweater (for the night was growing cold) and a large-brimmed brown felt hat. One of his arms was braced akimbo on his hip, the other hand he laid on the wind shield of the throbbing auto.  \"Excuse me, did you come from Bennett's in Bridgeboro?\"  \"Yes, we did,\" said a musical voice.  \"Then you'd better turn and go back; there's a message here which says so.\"  \"Back to Bennett's? Really?\"  \"I'll read it to you,\" said the boy in the white sweater.  He held a slip of yellow paper down in front of one of the acetylene headlights, and read,  \"Stop all autos, send car with young folks back to Bennett's, sure.\" (He did not read the last three words on the paper.)  \"Did you _ever_ in _all_ your _life_ know anything so perfectly extraordinary?\" said a girl.  \"You can turn better right up there,\" said Westy. He was a quiet, uncommunicative lad.  The sign was gone from the Bennetts' gate when the car returned, and the two boys standing in the shadow across the way, saw the party go up the drive and disappear into the house; there was still plenty of time for the festive program.  They never knew what was said on the subject of the sign and the mysterious telegram.  They kept it up at Bennetts' till long after midnight. They played \"Think of a Number,\" and \"Button, button, who's got the button?\" and wore tissue-paper caps which came out of tinselled snappers, and had ice cream and lady-fingers and macaroons and chicken salad.  When Connover went to bed, exhausted but happy, Mrs. Bennett tripped softly in to say good-night to him and to see that he had plenty of fresh air by \"opening the window a little at the top.\"  \"Isn't it much better, dearie,\" she said, seating herself for a moment on the edge of the bed, \"to find your pleasure right here than to be tramping over the country and building bonfires, and getting your clothing all filled with smoke from smudge signals, or whatever they call them, and catching your death of cold playing with searchlights, like that Blakeley boy up on the hill? It's just a foolish, senseless piece of business, taking a boy's thoughts away from home, and no good can ever come of it.\"     CHAPTER VI  HITTING THE BULL'S EYE    What did Tom Slade do after the best night's sleep he ever had? He went to Mrs. O'Connor's, where he knew he was welcome, and washed his face and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6655"],["title","Tom Slade : Boy Scout of the Moving Pictures (#5)"],["body","ds. More than that, he attended to his lessons in school that day, to the teacher's astonishment. And why? Because he knew it was right? Not much! But because he was anxious not to be kept in that afternoon for he wanted to go down and peek through the fence of Temple's lot, to see if there were any more wonders performed; to try to get a squint at Mr. Ellsworth and Westy.  In short, Tom Slade had the Scout bug; he could not escape it now. He had thrown it off once before, but that was a milder dose. As luck would have it, that very afternoon he had an amusing sidelight on the scouting business which gave him his first knowledge of the \"good turn\" idea, and a fresh glimpse of the character of Roy Blakeley.  Inside Temple's lot the full troop was holding forth in archery practice and Tom peered through a knothole and later ventured to a better view-point on top of the fence.  When any sort of game or contest is going on it is absolutely necessary to the boy beholder that he pick some favorite whom he hopes to see win, and Tom lost no time in singling Roy out as the object of his preference.  It was not a bad choice. As Roy stood sideways to the target, his feet firmly planted, one bared brown arm extended horizontally and holding the gracefully curving bow, and the other, bent but still horizontal, holding the arrow in the straining cord, he made an attractive picture.  \"Here's where I take the pupil out of the Bull's-eye,\" he said, and the arrow flew entirely free of the target.  \"No sooner said than stung!\" shouted Pee-wee Harris.  \"Oh, look who's going to try,--mother, mother, pin a rose on me!\" shouted another boy.  \"Mother, mother, turn the hose on me,\" called another.  \"Stand from behind in case the arrow goes backwards!\"  \"I bet he hits that fellow on the fence!\"  Tom could not help laughing as Mr. Ellsworth, with unruffled confidence, stepped in place.  \"Oi--oi--oi--here's where Hiawatha turns over in his grave!\"  It surprised Tom quite a little that they did not seem to stand at all in awe of the scoutmaster. One boy began ostentatiously passing his hat around.  \"For the benefit of Sitting Bull Ellsworth,\" said he, \"highest salaried artist in Temple's lot--positively last appearance this side of the Rockies!\"  But \"Sitting Bull\" Ellsworth had the laugh on them all. Straight inside the first ring went his arrow, and he stepped aside and gave an exceedingly funny wink at Tom on the fence.  Tom changed his favorite.  Presently Roy sauntered over to the fence and spoke to him. \"Regular shark at it, isn't he?\"  \"Which one is Westy?\" Tom asked.  \"Westy? That fellow right over there with the freckles. If you get up close you can see the Big Dipper on his left cheek. He's got Orion under his ear too.\"  \"O'Brien?\"  \"No, Orion--it's a bunch of stars. Oh, he's a regular walking firmament.\"  Tom stared at Westy. It seemed odd that the invisible being who had caught that message out of the darkness and turned the car back, should be right here, hobnobbing with other mortals.  \"Come over here, Westy,\" shouted Roy, \"I want Tom Slade to see your freck--well, I'll be--if this one hasn't shifted way over to the other side. Westy's our chart of the heavens. This is the fellow that helped send you the message last night, Westy. He ate two plates of plum-duff and he lives to tell the tale.\"  \"I understand Roy kidnapped you,\" said Westy.  \"It was fun all right,\" said Tom.  \"Too bad his parents put him out, wasn't it?\" said Westy.  \"Did you ever taste any of his biscuits?\" asked another fellow, who sauntered over. They formed a little group just below Tom.  \"We've got two of them in the Troop Room we use for bullets,\" he continued.  \"What do you think of Camp Solitaire?\" Westy asked.  Tom knew well enough that they were making fun of each other, but he did not exactly know how to participate in this sort of \"guying.\"  \"'Sall right,\" said he, rather weakly.  \"What do you think of the Eifel Tower?\"  \"'Sall right.\"  \"Did he show you the Indian moccasins Julia made for him?\"  This precipitated a wrestling match and Tom Slade witnessed the slow but sure triumph of science, as one after another the last speaker's arms, legs, back, neck and finally his head, yielded to the invincible process of Roy's patient efforts until the victim lay prone upon the grass.  \"Is Camp Solitaire all right?\" Roy demanded, laughing.  \"Sure,\" said the victim and sprang up, liberated.  Tom's interest in these pleasantries was interrupted by the voice of Mr. Ellsworth.  \"Come over here and try your hand, my boy.\"  \"Sure, go ahead,\" encouraged Westy, as the group separated for him to jump down.  \"_I_ couldn' hit it,\" hesitated Tom, abashed.  \"Neither could he,\" retorted Roy, promptly.  \"If you let him get away with the championship,\" said another boy, indicating the scoutmaster, \"he'll have such a swelled head he won't speak to us for a month. Come ahead down and make a stab at it, just for a stunt. You couldn't do worse than Blakeley.\"  Everything was a \"stunt\" with the scouts.  Reluctantly, and smiling, half pleased and half ashamed, Tom let himself down into the field and went over to where the scoutmaster waited, bow and arrow in hand.  \"A little more sideways, my boy,\" said Mr. Ellsworth; \"turn this foot out a little; bend your fingers like this, see? Ah, that's it. Now pull it right back to your shoulder--one--two--three--\" The arrow shot past the target, a full three yards shy of it, past the Ravens' patrol flag planted near by, and just grazed the portly form of Mr. John Temple, who came cat-a-cornered across the field from the gate.  A dead silence prevailed.  \"I presume you have permission to use this property,\" demanded Mr. Temple in thundering tones.  \"Good afternoon, Mr. Temple,\" said the scoutmaster.  \"Good afternoon, sir. Will you be good enough to let me see your authority for the use of these grounds?\" he demanded frigidly. \"If I gave any such permission I cannot seem to recall it.\"  \"I am afraid, Mr. Temple,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, \"that we can show no written word on--\"  \"Ah, yes,\" said the bank president, conclusively, \"and is it a part of your program to teach young boys to take and use what does not belong to them?\"  The scoutmaster flushed slightly. \"No, that is quite foreign to our program, Mr. Temple. Some weeks ago, happening to meet your secretary I asked him whether we might use this field for practice since it is in a central and convenient part of town, and he told me he believed there would be no objection. Perhaps I should have--\"  \"And you are under the impression that this field belongs to my secretary?\" asked Mr. Temple, hotly. \"If you have nothing better to do with yourself than to play leader to a crew of--\"  Here Mr. Ellsworth interrupted him.  \"We will leave the field at once, sir.\"  \"When _I_ was a young man,\" said Mr. Temple, with frosty condescension, \"I had something more important to do with myself than to play Wild West with a pack of boys.\"  \"There were more open fields in those days,\" said the scoutmaster, pleasantly.  \"And perhaps that is why my wealth grows now.\"  \"Very likely; and the movement which these boys represent,\" Mr. Ellsworth added with a suggestion of pride in his voice, \"is growing quite as fast as any man's wealth.\"  \"Indeed, sir! Do you know that this boy's father owes me money?\" said Mr. Temple, coldly indicating Tom.  \"Very likely.\"  \"And that the boy is a hoodlum?\"  Mr. Ellsworth bit his lip, hesitatingly. \"Yes, I know that, Mr. Temple,\" he said.  \"And a thief and a liar?\"  \"Don't run, Tom,\" whispered Roy.  \"No, I _don't_ know that. Suppose we talk apart, Mr. Temple.\"  \"We will talk right here, and there'll be very little talking indeed. If you think I am a public target, sir, you are quite mistaken! You clear out of this lot and keep out of it, or you'll go to jail--the whole pack of you! A man is known by the company he keeps. If you choose to cast your lot with children--and hoodlums and rowdies--I could send that boy to jail if I wanted to,\" he broke off. \"_You know_ he's a vicious character and yet you--\"  [Illustration: \"NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER MAN CAN BREAK UP THIS MOVEMENT.\"]  The Scoutmaster looked straight into the eyes of the enraged Temple, and there was a little prophetic ring in his voice as he answered.  \"I'm afraid it would be hard to say at present just what he is, Mr. Temple. I was thinking just a few minutes ago, as I saw him dangling his legs up there, that he was on the fence in more ways than one. I suppose we can push him down on either side we choose.\"  \"There's a right and wrong side to every fence, young man.\"  \"There is indeed.\"  \"As every good citizen should know; a public side and a private side.\"  \"He has always been on the wrong side of the fence hitherto, Mr. Temple.\" Mr. Ellsworth held out his hand and instinctively Tom shuffled toward him and allowed the scoutmaster's arm to encircle his shoulder. Roy Blakeley elbowed his way among the others as if it were appropriate that he should be at Tom's side.  \"I have no wish to interfere with this 'movement' or whatever you call it,\" said John Temple, sarcastically, \"provided you keep off my property. If you don't do that I'll put the thumb-screws on and see what the law can do, and break up your 'movement' into the bargain!\"  \"The law is helpless, Mr. Temple,\" said Mr. Ellsworth. \"Oh, it has failed utterly. I wish I could make you see that. As for breaking up the movement,\" he continued in quite a different tone, \"that is all sheer bluster, if you'll allow me to say so.\"  \"What!\" roared John Temple.  \"Neither you nor any other man can break up this movement.\"  \"As long as there are jails--\"  \"As long as there are woods and fields. But I see there is no room for discussion. We will not trespass again, sir; Mr. Blakeley's hill is ours for the asking. But you might as well try to bully the sun as to talk about breaking up this movement, Mr. John Temple. It is like a dog barking at a train of cars.\"  \"Do you know,\""]]]
