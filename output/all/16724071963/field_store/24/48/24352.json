So long as the non-Weismannians deal with matters outside this discussion, their existence and their work is rated at its just value; but any work of theirs on this point so affects the orthodox Weismannite (whether he accept this label or reject it does not matter), that for the time being their existence and the good work they have done are alike non-existent. {0e}  Butler founded no school, and wished to found none.  He desired that what was true in his work should prevail, and he looked forward calmly to the time when the recognition of that truth and of his share in advancing it should give him in the lives of others that immortality for which alone he craved.  Lamarckian views have never lacked defenders here and in America.  Of the English, Herbert Spencer, who however, was averse to the vitalistic attitude, Vines and Henslow among botanists, Cunningham among zoologists, have always resisted Weismannism; but, I think, none of these was distinctly influenced by Hering and Butler.  In America the majority of the great school of palæontologists have been strong Lamarckians, notably Cope, who has pointed out, moreover, that the transformations of energy in living beings are peculiar to them.  We have already adverted to Haeckel’s acceptance and development of Hering’s ideas in his “Perigenese der Plastidule.”  Oscar Hertwig has been a consistent Lamarckian, like Yves Delage of the Sorbonne, and these occupy pre-eminent positions not only as observers, but as discriminating theorists and historians of the recent progress of biology.  We may also cite as a Lamarckian—of a sort—Felix Le Dantec, the leader of the chemico-physical school of the present day.  But we must seek elsewhere for special attention to the points which Butler regarded as the essentials of “Life and Habit.”  In 1893 Henry P. Orr, Professor of Biology in the University of Louisiana, published a little book entitled “A Theory of Heredity.”  Herein he insists on the nervous control of the whole body, and on the transmission to the reproductive cells of such stimuli, received by the body, as will guide them on their path until they shall have acquired adequate experience of their own in the new body they have formed.  I have found the name of neither Butler nor Hering, but the treatment is essentially on their lines, and is both clear and interesting.  In 1896 I wrote an essay on “The Fundamental Principles of Heredity,” primarily directed to the man in the street.  This, after being held over for more than a year by one leading review, was “declined with regret,” and again after some weeks met the same fate from another editor.  It appeared in the pages of “Natural Science” for October, 1897, and in the “Biologisches Centralblatt” for the same year.  I reproduce its closing paragraph:—      “This theory [Hering-Butler’s] has, indeed, a tentative character,     and lacks symmetrical completeness, but is the more welcome as not     aiming at the impossible.  A whole series of phenomena in organic     beings are correlated under the term of _memory_, _conscious and     unconscious_, _patent and latent_. . . .  Of the order of unconscious     memory, latent till the arrival of the appropriate stimulus, is all     the co-operative growth and work of the organism, including its     development from the reproductive cells.  Concerning the _modus     operandi_ we know nothing: the phenomena may be due, as Hering     suggests, to molecular vibrations, which must be at least as distinct     from ordinary physical disturbances as Röntgen’s rays are from     ordinary light; or it may be correlated, as we ourselves are inclined     to think, with complex chemical changes in an intricate but orderly     succession.  For the present, at least, the problem of heredity can     only be elucidated by the light of mental, and not material     processes.”  It will be seen that I express doubts as to the validity of Hering’s invocation of molecular vibrations as the mechanism of memory, and suggest as an alternative rhythmic chemical changes.  This view has recently been put forth in detail by J. J. Cunningham in his essay on the “Hormone {0f} Theory of Heredity,” in the _Archiv für Entwicklungsmechanik_ (1909), but I have failed to note any direct effect of my essay on the trend of biological thought.  Among post-Darwinian controversies the one that has latterly assumed the greatest prominence is that of the relative importance of small variations in the way of more or less “fluctuations,” and of “discontinuous variations,” or “mutations,” as De Vries has called them. Darwin, in the first four editions of the “Origin of Species,” attached more importance to the latter than in subsequent editions; he was swayed in his attitude, as is well known, by an article of the physicist, Fleeming Jenkin, which appeared in the _North British Review_.  The mathematics of this article were unimpeachable, but they were founded on the assumption that exceptional variations would only occur in single individuals, which is, indeed, often the case among those domesticated races on which Darwin especially studied the phenomena of variation. Darwin was no mathematician or physicist, and we are told in his biography that he regarded every tool-shop rule or optician’s thermometer as an instrument of precision: so he appears to have regarded Fleeming Jenkin’s demonstration as a mathematical deduction which he was bound to accept without criticism.  Mr. William Bateson, late Professor of Biology in the University of Cambridge, as early as 1894 laid great stress on the importance of discontinuous variations, collecting and collating the known facts in his “Materials for the Study of Variations”; but this important work, now become rare and valuable, at the time excited so little interest as to be ‘remaindered’ within a very few years after publication.  In 1901 Hugo De Vries, Professor of Botany in the University of Amsterdam, published “Die Mutationstheorie,” wherein he showed that mutations or discontinuous variations in various directions may appear simultaneously in many individuals, and in various directions.  In the gardener’s phrase, the species may take to sporting in various directions at the same time, and each sport may be represented by numerous specimens.  De Vries shows the probability that species go on for long periods showing only fluctuations, and then suddenly take to sporting in the way described, short periods of mutation alternating with long intervals of relative constancy.  It is to mutations that De Vries and his school, as well as Luther Burbank, the great former of new fruit- and flower-plants, look for those variations which form the material of Natural Selection. In “God the Known and God the Unknown,” which appeared in the _Examiner_ (May, June, and July), 1879, but though then revised was only published posthumously in 1909, Butler anticipates this distinction:—      “Under these circumstances organism must act in one or other of these     two ways: it must either change slowly and continuously with the     surroundings, paying cash for everything, meeting the smallest change     with a corresponding modification, so far as is found convenient, or     it must put off change as long as possible, and then make larger and     more sweeping changes.      “Both these courses are the same in principle, the difference being     one of scale, and the one being a miniature of the other, as a ripple     is an Atlantic wave in little; both have their advantages and     disadvantages, so that most organisms will take the one course for     one set of things and the other for another.  They will deal promptly     with things which they can get at easily, and which lie more upon the     surface; _those_, _however_, _which are more troublesome to reach_,     _and lie deeper_, _will be handled upon more cataclysmic principles_,     _being allowed longer periods of repose followed by short periods of     greater activity_ . . . it may be questioned whether what is called a     sport is not the organic expression of discontent which has been long     felt, but which has not been attended to, nor been met step by step     by as much small remedial modification as was found practicable: so     that when a change does come it comes by way of revolution.  Or,     again (only that it comes to much the same thing), it may be compared     to one of those happy thoughts which sometimes come to us unbidden     after we have been thinking for a long time what to do, or how to     arrange our ideas, and have yet been unable to come to any     conclusion” (pp. 14, 15). {0g}  We come to another order of mind in Hans Driesch.  At the time he began his work biologists were largely busy in a region indicated by Darwin, and roughly mapped out by Haeckel—that of phylogeny.  From the facts of development of the individual, from the comparison of fossils in successive strata, they set to work at the construction of pedigrees, and strove to bring into line the principles of classification with the more or less hypothetical “stemtrees.”  Driesch considered this futile, since we never could reconstruct from such evidence anything certain in the history of the past.  He therefore asserted that a more complete knowledge of the physics and chemistry of the organic world might give a scientific explanation of the phenomena, and maintained that the proper work of the biologist was to deepen our knowledge in these respects.  He embodied his views, seeking the explanation on this track, filling up gaps and tracing projected roads along lines of probable truth in his “Analytische Theorie der organische Entwicklung.”  But his own work convinced him of the hopelessness of the task he had undertaken, and he has become as strenuous a vitalist as Butler.  The most complete statement of his present views"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6605"],["title","Unconscious Memory (#4)"],["body"," to be found in “The Philosophy of Life” (1908–9), being the Giffold Lectures for 1907–8.  Herein he postulates a quality (“psychoid”) in all living beings, directing energy and matter for the purpose of the organism, and to this he applies the Aristotelian designation “Entelechy.”  The question of the transmission of acquired characters is regarded as doubtful, and he does not emphasise—if he accepts—the doctrine of continuous personality.  His early youthful impatience with descent theories and hypotheses has, however, disappeared.                                  * * * * *  In the next work the influence of Hering and Butler is definitely present and recognised.  In 1906 Signor Eugenio Rignano, an engineer keenly interested in all branches of science, and a little later the founder of the international review, _Rivistà di Scienza_ (now simply called _Scientia_), published in French a volume entitled “Sur la transmissibilité des Caractères acquis—Hypothèse d’un Centro-épigenèse.” Into the details of the author’s work we will not enter fully.  Suffice it to know that he accepts the Hering-Butler theory, and makes a distinct advance on Hering’s rather crude hypothesis of persistent vibrations by suggesting that the remembering centres store slightly different forms of energy, to give out energy of the same kind as they have received, like electrical accumulators.  The last chapter, “Le Phénomène mnémonique et le Phénomène vital,” is frankly based on Hering.  In “The Lesson of Evolution” (1907, posthumous, and only published for private circulation) Frederick Wollaston Hutton, F.R.S., late Professor of Biology and Geology, first at Dunedin and after at Christchurch, New Zealand, puts forward a strongly vitalistic view, and adopts Hering’s teaching.  After stating this he adds, “The same idea of heredity being due to unconscious memory was advocated by Mr. Samuel Butler in his “Life and Habit.”  Dr. James Mark Baldwin, Stuart Professor of Psychology in Princeton University, U.S.A., called attention early in the 90’s to a reaction characteristic of all living beings, which he terms the “Circular Reaction.”  We take his most recent account of this from his “Development and Evolution” (1902):—{0h}      “The general fact is that the organism reacts by concentration upon     the locality stimulated for the _continuance_ of the conditions,     movements, stimulations, _which are vitally beneficial_, and for the     cessation of the conditions, movements, stimulations _which are     vitally depressing_.”  This amounts to saying in the terminology of Jenning (see below) that the living organism alters its “physiological states” either for its direct benefit, or for its indirect benefit in the reduction of harmful conditions.  Again:—      “This form of concentration of energy on stimulated localities, with     the resulting renewal through movement of conditions that are     pleasure-giving and beneficial, and the consequent repetition of the     movements is called ‘circular reaction.’”  Of course, the inhibition of such movements as would be painful on repetition is merely the negative case of the circular reaction.  We must not put too much of our own ideas into the author’s mind; he nowhere says explicitly that the animal or plant shows its sense and does this because it likes the one thing and wants it repeated, or dislikes the other and stops its repetition, as Butler would have said.  Baldwin is very strong in insisting that no full explanation can be given of living processes, any more than of history, on purely chemico-physical grounds.  The same view is put differently and independently by H. S. Jennings, {0i} who started his investigations of living Protista, the simplest of living beings, with the idea that only accurate and ample observation was needed to enable us to explain all their activities on a mechanical basis, and devised ingenious models of protoplastic movements.  He was led, like Driesch, to renounce such efforts as illusory, and has come to the conviction that in the behaviour of these lowly beings there is a purposive and a tentative character—a method of “trial and error”—that can only be interpreted by the invocation of psychology.  He points out that after stimulation the “state” of the organism may be altered, so that the response to the same stimulus on repetition is other.  Or, as he puts it, the first stimulus has caused the organism to pass into a new “physiological state.”  As the change of state from what we may call the “primary indifferent state” is advantageous to the organism, we may regard this as equivalent to the doctrine of the “circular reaction,” and also as containing the essence of Semon’s doctrine of “engrams” or imprints which we are about to consider.  We cite one passage which for audacity of thought (underlying, it is true, most guarded expression) may well compare with many of the boldest flights in “Life and Habit”:—      “It may be noted that regulation in the manner we have set forth is     what, in the behaviour of higher organisms, at least, is called     intelligence [the examples have been taken from Protista, Corals, and     the Lowest Worms].  If the same method of regulation is found in     other fields, there is no reason for refusing to compare the action     to intelligence.  Comparison of the regulatory processes that are     shown in internal physiological changes and in regeneration to     intelligence seems to be looked upon sometimes as heretical and     unscientific.  Yet intelligence is a name applied to processes that     actually exist in the regulation of movements, and there is, _a     priori_, no reason why similar processes should not occur in     regulation in other fields.  When we analyse regulation objectively     there seems indeed reason to think that the processes are of the same     character in behaviour as elsewhere.  If the term intelligence be     reserved for the subjective accompaniments of such regulation, then     of course we have no direct knowledge of its existence in any of the     fields of regulation outside of the self, and in the self perhaps     only in behaviour.  But in a purely objective consideration there     seems no reason to suppose that regulation in behaviour     (intelligence) is of a fundamentally different character from     regulation elsewhere.”  (“Method of Regulation,” p. 492.)  Jennings makes no mention of questions of the theory of heredity.  He has made some experiments on the transmission of an acquired character in Protozoa; but it was a mutilation-character, which is, as has been often shown, {0j} not to the point.                                  * * * * *  One of the most obvious criticisms of Hering’s exposition is based upon the extended use he makes of the word “Memory”: this he had foreseen and deprecated.      “We have a perfect right,” he says, “to extend our conception of     memory so as to make it embrace involuntary [and also unconscious]     reproductions of sensations, ideas, perceptions, and efforts; but we     find, on having done so, that we have so far enlarged her boundaries     that she proves to be an ultimate and original power, the source and,     at the same time, the unifying bond, of our whole conscious life.”     (“Unconscious Memory,” p. 68.)  This sentence, coupled with Hering’s omission to give to the concept of memory so enlarged a new name, clear alike of the limitations and of the stains of habitual use, may well have been the inspiration of the next work on our list.  Richard Semon is a professional zoologist and anthropologist of such high status for his original observations and researches in the mere technical sense, that in these countries he would assuredly have been acclaimed as one of the Fellows of the Royal Society who were Samuel Butler’s special aversion.  The full title of his book is “DIE MNEME als erhaltende Prinzip im Wechsel des organischen Geschehens” (Munich, Ed.  1, 1904; Ed. 2, 1908).  We may translate it “MNEME, a Principle of Conservation in the Transformations of Organic Existence.”  From this I quote in free translation the opening passage of Chapter II:—      “We have shown that in very many cases, whether in Protist, Plant, or     Animal, when an organism has passed into an indifferent state after     the reaction to a stimulus has ceased, its irritable substance has     suffered a lasting change: I call this after-action of the stimulus     its ‘imprint’ or ‘engraphic’ action, since it penetrates and imprints     itself in the organic substance; and I term the change so effected an     ‘imprint’ or ‘engram’ of the stimulus; and the sum of all the     imprints possessed by the organism may be called its ‘store of     imprints,’ wherein we must distinguish between those which it has     inherited from its forbears and those which it has acquired itself.     Any phenomenon displayed by an organism as the result either of a     single imprint or of a sum of them, I term a ‘mnemic phenomenon’; and     the mnemic possibilities of an organism may be termed, collectively,     its ‘MNEME.’      “I have selected my own terms for the concepts that I have just     defined.  On many grounds I refrain from making any use of the good     German terms ‘Gedächtniss, Erinnerungsbild.’  The first and chiefest     ground is that for my purpose I should have to employ the German     words in a much wider sense than what they usually convey, and thus     leave the door open to countless misunderstandings and idle     controversies.  It would, indeed, even amount to an error of fact to     give to the wider concept the name already current in the narrower     sense—nay, actually limited, like ‘Erinnerungsbild,’ to phenomena of     consciousness. . . .  In Animals, during the course of history, one     set of organs has, so to speak, specialised itself for the reception     and transmission of stimuli—the Nervous System.  But from this     specialisation"]]]
