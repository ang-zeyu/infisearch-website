He was completely dumfounded.  \"You!\" he said slowly, hardly knowing how to speak after he had caught his breath.  \"Yes, you rascal. Where is Dick.\"  \"Dick?\"  \"Yes, Dick.\"  \"I know nothing of your brother. This is a--a complete surprise. I didn't know you were in Cleveland.\"  \"Perhaps not. But let me tell you that we know your game, and we are going to hand you over to the law.\"  \"Never!\" Arnold Baxter fairly hissed out the words. \"Let go of that horse\"--the latter words to Sam.  \"Don't you do it!\" cried Tom, and then he caught Arnold Baxter by the leg. \"Come out of the carriage.\"  A fierce struggle ensued, and, afraid that Tom would get the worst of it, Sam set up a loud shout for help.  \"You whelp! I'll fix you!\" ejaculated Arnold Baxter, and catching up the whip, he struck at Tom with the butt end. He caught the youth directly over the head, and Tom went down as if shot.  \"Let Tom alone,\" screamed Sam. \"Help! help!\"  \"Who is it?\" came from a distance, and Luke Peterson hove into sight. \"Hullo! the man we are after.\"  He made a dive for Arnold Baxter, but the latter was too quick for him, and leaped from the opposite side of the carriage to the ground. The horse now became frightened and set off on a run, directly for a lane behind Dr. Karley's institution.  \"Tom, are you badly hurt?\" questioned Sam, but, even as he spoke, Tom tried to stagger to his feet. Seeing this, Sam began a chase after Baxter, with the lumberman beside him.  Arnold Baxter was fleet of foot, and realizing what capture meant--a return to prison with his sentence to be served once more from the beginning--he ran as never before, straight for the dock where the _Peacock_ lay.  [Illustration: THE HORSE NOW BECAME FRIGHTENED AND SET OFF ON A RUN.]  His first thought was to board the schooner and set sail out into the lake, but a second thought convinced him that this would be unwise.  \"They will follow me on a tug or steamer, and the jig will be up in no time,\" he said to himself \"I must find some hiding place.\"  Many of the docks were inclosed by high board fences, and coming to one of these, he leaped over and made his way to a huge pile of merchandise. Here he crouched down and kept as quiet as a mouse.  Sam and Peterson, followed by Tom, traced him to the fence, but once on the opposite side, lost all track of the rascal.  \"He's gone,\" said Tom, after running hither and thither on the dock. \"He has given us the slip nicely.\"  \"He can't be far off,\" returned Sam. \"I believe he was bound for that doctor's sanitarium when we spotted him.\"  \"So do I, and I wouldn't wonder if poor Dick is at the place, a prisoner.\"  The matter was talked over for several minutes, and the two brothers decided to return to Dr. Karley's sanitarium. The lumberman said he would remain around the docks on the lookout for Arnold Baxter.  \"If you catch him I'll give you fifty dollars,\" said Tom. \"My father, I know, will pay the amount willingly.\"  \"I'll do my best,\" answered Peterson. He was by no means rich and glad enough of a chance to make such a sum. Besides this, the ways of the Rover boys appeared to please him.  When Sam and Tom returned to the doctor's place they found the coach driver still at hand, he having caught Arnold Baxter's horse at the entrance to the lane.  \"Take him to the stable and ask the doctor if the rig is his,\" said Tom, and the coach driver agreed. He was gone the best part of quarter of an hour.  \"The doctor says it is his horse and carriage, but he also says he didn't know the turnout was out,\" he announced, with a grin. \"He's an oily one, he is!\"  \"Right you are, but he can't stuff us with his fairy tales,\" replied Tom. \"Do you suppose there is a policeman handy?\"  \"There is probably one somewhere around.\"  \"I wish you would hunt him up and bring him here.\"  \"What are you going to do?\"  \"Dare the lion in his den; eh, Sam?\"  \"Right, Tom! That doctor must know a good deal more than he is wiling to tell.\"  The coach driver went off, and walking around to the front of the sanitarium the boys rang the bell sharply.  There was no answer to the summons, and then Tom gave the bell knob a jerk which nearly broke it off. A second-story window was thrown open with a bang.  \"I want you boys to go away!\" came in angry tones.  \"And I want you to come down and let us in,\" retorted Tom.  \"I won't let you in. I've told you all I know, and that is the end of it.\"  \"It's not the end of it, Dr. Karley. We want to know how you came to let Arnold Baxter have your horse and carriage.\"  \"I didn't know the horse and carriage were out of the stable. The man must have taken them on the sly.\"  \"It's not likely. Open the door and let us in--it will be best for you.\"  \"Ha, you threaten me!\"  \"I've done more than that-I've sent for a policeman.\"  At this announcement the old doctor grated his teeth savagely. He was much disturbed and knew not how to proceed.  \"I was a fool to go into this thing,\" he muttered. \"It may lead to all sorts of trouble. I must get myself clear somehow.\"  \"Are you going to let us in?\" went on Tom.  \"Yes, I will let you in. But allow me to state that you are acting very foolishly,\" answered the doctor, and dropped the window. A few minutes later he appeared at the door, which he opened very gingerly.  \"You can come into the parlor,\" he said stiffly.  \"We'll remain right here,\" answered Tom, afraid of some sort of a trap.  \"Well, what do you want?\"  \"I want to know where that young man, my brother, is.\"  \"The man who was with him said he was his nephew.\"  \"It was a falsehood. Now where is my brother?\"  \"Honestly, I have not the slightest idea.\"  \"What was that man doing with your carriage?\"  \"I repeat, young man, I did not know he had the carriage.\" The old doctor drew a long breath, wondering how soon an officer of the law would appear. \"Of course if anything is wrong I am perfectly willing to do all I can to set it right. My institution is above reproach, and I wish to keep it so.\"  \"Are you willing to let me look through your place?\"  \"So you think your brother is here?\"  \"I do.\"  \"You are very forward. Still, to convince you that you are mistaken, you are at liberty to go through my place from top to bottom. But you must not disturb any of the patients.\"  \"All right; let us go through. Sam, you remain here, on the watch for that policeman.\"  With bad grace Dr. Karley led the way and took Tom through the sanitarium from top to bottom, even allowing him to peep into the rooms occupied by the \"boarders,\" as the medical man called them. Of course there was no trace of Dick.  \"Now I trust you are satisfied,\" said the doctor, when they were again at the front door.  \"I am not satisfied about that carriage affair,\" returned Tom, as bluntly as ever.  \"Well, I have told you the truth.\"  At this moment the coach driver came in sight, accompanied by a policeman.  \"What's the trouble?\" demanded the officer of the law.  Tom and Sam told their tale, and then the doctor had his say, and the driver related what he knew.  \"Certainly a queer mix-up,\" remarked the policeman. He turned to the Rovers. \"What do you want to do?\"  \"I want to find my brother, who has disappeared,\" said Tom.  \"You say you have searched through here?\"  \"I have--after a fashion.\"  \"You can go through, if you wish,\" said the doctor to the officer.  \"I reckon my brother is gone,\" went on Tom. \"But this doctor helped the rascals who spirited him away.\"  \"I did absolutely nothing,\" cried Dr. Karley. \"I am willing to aid you all I can. But I am innocent. I received no pay for giving the unfortunate young man some medicine to strengthen him, and my horse and carriage were taken without my knowledge.\"  A long and bitter war of words followed, but in the end the doctor was left to himself.  \"We'll make no charge against him yet,\" said Tom to the policeman. \"But I wish you would keep an eye on the institution--in case that rascal puts in an appearance again.\"  \"I will,\" returned the officer.  A little while later Sam and Tom set out to rejoin Luke Peterson. When they gained the dock they saw nobody.  \"He ought to be somewhere about,\" said the younger Rover.  They tramped about from place to place for fully an hour.  Presently they came close to where the _Swallow_ lay. Had they but known it, the _Peacock_, with poor Dick on board, lay but three blocks further away.  \"My gracious!\" cried Sam suddenly.  He had seen a form stretched motionless across some lumber lying near.  The form was that of Luke Peterson, and his cheek and temple were covered with blood.     CHAPTER VIII.  ON THE LAKE AGAIN.   \"Peterson!\" cried Tom, in dismay.  \"Can he be dead?\" came from Sam. Then he bent over the lumberman. \"No, he still lives. But he has been treated most shamefully.\"  \"This must be some more of Arnold Baxter's work.\"  \"Or else the work of some footpad.\"  Both boys knelt over the prostrate form of the lumberman and did what they could to restore him to his senses.  In this they were partly successful.  \"Don't hit me again! Please don't hit me!\" the man moaned, over and over again.  \"You're safe,\" said Tom. But Peterson paid no attention, and only begged them not to hit him.  \"Let us carry him to the _Swallow_,\" suggested Sam, and between them they did so.  \"Wot's dis?\" asked Aleck Pop, in astonishment.  \"He is our friend, and has been struck down,\" answered Tom. \"Get some water in a basin, and a little liquor.\"  When the colored man returned with the articles mentioned both boys washed the wounded man's head and bound it up with a towel. Then Tom administered a few spoonfuls of liquor. This seemed to give Peterson some strength, but he did not fully recover for some hours.  \"Follow the _Peacock_,\" were his first rational words. \"Follow the schooner _Peacock_.\"  \"The _Peacock_?\" repeated Tom. \"Why should we follow her?\"  \"Your brother is on board.\" And having spoken thus, the lumberman sank again into semi-unconsciousness.  \"Can he be telling the truth, or is he out of his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6451"],["title","The Rover Boys on the Great Lakes; Or, The Secret of the Island Cave (#7)"],["body","head?\" questioned Sam.  \"I'm sure I don't know, Sam.\"  \"Perhaps we had better look around for the schooner he mentioned.\"  \"All right, I'll do so. You stay here with Aleck.\"  \"Hadn't I better go with you?\"  \"No, I'll keep my eyes open,\" concluded Tom, and hurried away.  It was now dawn, and the early workers were just getting to their employment. Soon Tom met a couple of watchmen and hailed them.  \"I am looking for the schooner _Peacock_,\" said he. \"Do you know anything of the craft?\"  \"Sure, an' that's Gus Langless' boat,\" said one of the watchmen. \"She's lying at the end of Bassoon's wharf, over yonder.\"  \"Thank you,\" and Tom started away.  The wharf mentioned was a long one, and it took some time for the youth to reach the outer end. As he ran he saw a boat in the distance, moving away with all sails set. Of course he could not make out her name, but he saw that she was schooner-rigged, and felt certain she must be the craft for which he was searching.  At the end of the pier he met a dock hand, who had been resting in a nearby shed.  \"Is that boat the _Peacock_?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Do you know anything of the people on board?\"  \"I do not.\"  \"Has she a cargo?\"  \"I believe not.\"  \"You didn't see anybody going on her?\"  \"Hold up! Yes, I did; a young fellow and a man.\"  \"Was the young man in a feeble state?\"  \"He seemed to be.\"  \"Thank you.\"  Tom turned away with something of a groan. \"Dick must be on board of that craft, along with the Baxters. Oh, what luck we are having! Now what ought I to do next?\"  His wisest move would have been to have informed the authorities, but Tom was too much upset mentally to think of that. With all speed he returned to the _Swallow_.  \"The _Peacock_ has sailed!\" he cried. \"We must follow her!\"  \"You are certain?\" queried Sam.  \"Yes, I saw her in the distance. Come, let us get after her before it is too late.\"  As Luke Peterson was now doing fairly well, all of the others ran on deck, and soon the _Swallow_ was in pursuit of the schooner. At first but little could be seen of the _Peacock_, but when the sun came up they saw her plainly, heading toward the northwest.  \"We must keep her in sight,\" said Tom.  \"Yes, but supposing the Baxters are on board, how can we capture them?\" came from Sam. \"We are but three, or four at the most, counting Peterson, while that craft must carry a crew of five or six.\"  \"We can hail some other boat to help us. The main thing is not to lose track of the rascals.\"  The breeze was all that could be desired, and once the shore was left behind they kept the _Peacock_ in sight with ease. But, try their best, they gained but little on the larger boat.  As there was now nothing to do but to let the yacht do her best, Tom left Sam at the wheel and turned his attention to Peterson. The lumberman was now able to sit up, although very weak.  \"I discovered Arnold Baxter and tracked him to the schooner's dock,\" he said. \"His son came to the dock, and from what they said I am sure your brother is on the craft. Then they discovered me, and the father struck me down with the butt of a pistol he carried. After that all was a blank until I found myself here.\"  \"You can be thankful you weren't killed.\"  \"I suppose so. I shall not rest until that villain is brought to justice. But what are ye up to now, lad?\"  \"We are in pursuit of the _Peacock_.\"  \"On the lake or up the river?\"  \"On the lake.\"  \"Can you keep her in sight?\"  \"So far we seem to be holding our own.\"  \"Good! I'd go on deck and help ye, but I feel kind o' strange-like in the legs.\"  \"Better keep quiet for the present. We may need you later on.\"  \"Got any firearms on board?\"  \"Yes, a gun and two pistols.\"  \"Ye may want 'em afore ye git through with that crowd. They are bad ones.\"  \"We know them thoroughly, Mr. Peterson. We have been acquainted with them for years.\" And then Tom told of how Dan Baxter had been the bully at Putnam Hall, and how he had run away to join his rascally father, and of how Arnold Baxter had been Mr. Rover's enemy since the days of early mining in the West.  \"O' course they are carrying off your brother fer a purpose,\" said the lumberman. \"Like as not they'll try to hit your father through him.\"  \"I presume that is the game.\"  The morning wore away slowly, but as the sun mounted higher the breeze gradually died down.  The _Peacock_ was the first to feel the going down of the wind, and slowly, but surely, the _Swallow_ crept closer to the schooner.  But at last both vessels came to a standstill, about quarter of a mile apart.  \"Now what's to do?\" questioned Sam dismally.  \"I reckon we can whistle for a breeze,\" returned his brother.  \"Whistling won't do us any good. I've been wondering if we could not do some rowing in the small boat.\"  \"Hurrah! just the thing!\"  There was a small rowboat stored away on board the _Swallow_, and this was now brought forth, along with two pairs of oars.  \"Gwine ter row ober, eh?\" observed Aleck Pop. \"Racken you dun bettah been careful wot youse do.\"  \"We shall go armed,\" answered Tom.  The boys soon had the rowboat floating on the lake, and they leaped in, each with a pair of oars, and with a pistol stowed away in his pocket.  From the start those on board of the _Peacock_ had been afraid that the yacht was following them, and now they were certain of it.  \"Two boys putting off in a rowboat,\" announced Captain Langless.  \"They are Tom and Sam Rover,\" answered Arnold Baxter, after a brief survey through a marine glass.  \"How did they get to know enough to follow this craft?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know. But those Rover boys are slick, and always were.\"  \"What will you do when they come up?\"  \"Warn them off.\"  \"I've got an idea, dad,\" came from Dan.  \"Well?\"  \"Why not get out of sight and let Captain Langless invite them on board, to look for Dick. Then we can bag them and put them with Dick.\"  \"By Jove, that is a scheme!\" exclaimed the rascally parent. \"Langless, will you do it? Of course, we'll have to get out of sight until the proper moment arrives.\"  \"But if you bag 'em, what of those left on the _Swallow_?\" questioned the captain.  \"There is only one man, a negro. He doesn't amount to anything.\"  \"There may be more--one or two officers of the law.\"  Arnold Baxter used his glass again. \"I see nobody but the darky. If there were officers at hand, I am sure they would have come along in that rowboat.\"  \"I guess you are right about that.\"  \"If we capture the boys the darky won't dare to follow us alone, and it may be that we can capture him, too,\" went on Arnold Baxter.  By this time the rowboat was drawing closer, and Arnold Baxter and Dan stepped out of sight behind the forecastle of the schooner.  A few additional words passed between Captain Langless and the Baxters, and then the owner of the _Peacock_ awaited the coming of our friends, who were now almost alongside, never suspecting the trap which was set for them.     CHAPTER IX.  CAUGHT IN A TRAP.   \"Do you see anything of the Baxters?\" asked Sam, when the rowboat was within a hundred feet of the schooner.  \"I thought I did before, but I don't see them now,\" answered Tom.  \"Rowboat, ahoy!\" shouted Captain Langless. \"What brings you?\"  \"I reckon you know well enough,\" Tom shouted back. \"We are after Dick Rover.\"  \"Dick Rover? Who is he?\"  \"Your prisoner.\"  \"Our prisoner?\" The owner of the _Peacock_ put on a look of surprise. \"Really, you are talking in riddles.\"  \"I don't think so. Where are Arnold Baxter and his son Dan?\"  \"Don't know anybody by that name.\"  \"They went on board of your boat,\" put in Sam.  \"You must be mistaken.\" Captain Langless turned to his mate. \"Find any stowaways on board?\"  \"Nary a one,\" was the mate's answer. \"And just came up from the hold, too.\"  This talk perplexed Tom and Sam not a little.  Was it possible Luke Peterson had made some mistake?  \"We have it on pretty good authority that the Baxters are on board of your boat, and that Dick Rover is aboard, too,\" said Sam.  \"It's all a riddle to me,\" answered Captain Langless. \"We are not in the business of carrying prisoners. We are bound for Sandusky for a cargo of flour.\"  This talk completely nonplused the boys, and they held a whispered consultation.  \"I don't believe him,\" said Sam.  \"No more do I. But what shall we do about it?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know.\"  \"You can come on board and look around, if you wish,\" called out the owner of the schooner. \"I want you to satisfy yourself that you are mistaken.\"  \"Shall we go?\" whispered Tom. \"It may be a trap?\"  \"He seems honest enough.\"  \"Supposing I go and you stay in the rowboat? Then, if anything happens, you can call on Aleck and Peterson for help.\"  So it was arranged, and in a minute more Tom was climbing up the ladder which had been thrown over the _Peacock's_ side.  \"Is the other young fellow coming?\" asked the captain, who did not fancy this move.  \"No.\"  The captain scowled, but said no more.  Once on deck Tom looked around him curiously, and then moved toward the companion way leading to the cabin. He felt instinctively that he was in a dangerous position. As he crossed the deck several ill-appearing sailors gazed at him curiously, but said nothing--being under strict orders from the captain to remain silent in the presence of the stranger.  The cabin of the _Peacock_ was a small affair, considering the general size of the schooner, and contained but little in the shape of furniture.  Dick had been removed long before, so the apartment was empty of human occupants when Tom entered.  \"Nobody here,\" he murmured, as he gazed around. \"What foolishness to come, anyway! The Baxters could easily hide on me, if they wanted to.\"  He was about to leave the cabin when a form darkened the companion way, and Arnold Baxter appeared.  \"Silence!\" commanded the man, and pointed a pistol at Tom's head.  The sight of the rascal startled the youth and the look on Baxter's face caused him to shiver.  \"So you are here, after all,\" he managed to  say.  \"Silence!\" repeated Arnold"]]]
