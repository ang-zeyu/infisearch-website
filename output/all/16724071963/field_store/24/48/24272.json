These two pairs of feet are more closely approximated than the rest; the opposed surfaces of their basal joints (therefore the hinder surface on the third, and the anterior surface on the fourth feet) are smooth and polished, and their margins bear a dense border of long, silky, and peculiarly formed hairs (Fig. 13). Milne-Edwards who rightly compares these surfaces, as to their appearance, with articular surfaces, thinks that they serve to diminish the friction between the two feet. In considering this interpretation, the question could not but arise why such an arrangement for the diminution of friction should be necessary in these particular Crabs and between these two feet, leaving out of consideration the fact that the remarkable brushes of hair, which on the other hand must increase friction, also remain unexplained. But as I was bending the feet of a large Sand-Crab to and fro in various directions, in order to see in what movements of the animal friction occurred at the place indicated, and whether these might, perhaps, be movements of particular importance to it and such as would frequently recur, I noticed, when I had stretched the feet widely apart, in the hollow between them a round orifice of considerable size, through which air could easily be blown into the branchial cavity, and a fine rod might even be introduced into it. The orifice opens into the branchial cavity behind a conical lobe, which stands above the third foot in place of a branchia which is wanting in _ Ocypoda._ It is bounded laterally by ridges, which rise above the articulation of the foot, and to which the lower margin of the carapace is applied. Exteriorly, also, it is overarched by these ridges with the exception of a narrow fissure. This fissure is overlaid by the carapace, which exactly at this part projects further downwards than elsewhere, and in this way a complete tube is formed. Whilst in _Grapsus_ the water is allowed to reach the branchiæ only from the front, I saw it in _Ocypoda_ flow in also through the orifice just described.  In the position of posterior entrant orifice and the accompanying peculiarities of the third and fourth pairs of feet, two other non-aquatic species of the same family, which I have had the opportunity of examining, agree with _Ocypoda._ One of these, perhaps _Gelasimus vocans,_ which lives in the mangrove swamps, and likes to furnish the mouth of its burrow with a thick, cylindrical chimney of several inches in height, has the brushes on the basal joints of the feet in question composed of ordinary hairs. The other, a smaller _Gelasimus,_ not described in Milne-Edwards’ ‘Natural History of Crustacea,’ which prefers drier places and is not afraid to run about on the burning sand under the vertical rays of the noonday sun in December, but can also endure being in water at least for several weeks, resembles _Ocypoda_ in having these brushes composed of non-setiform, delicate hairs, indeed even more delicate and more regularly constructed than in _Ocypoda._[2] What may be the significance of these peculiar hairs,—whether they only keep foreign bodies from the branchial cavity,—whether they furnish moisture to the air flowing past them,—or whether, as their aspect, especially in the small _Gelasimus,_ reminds one of the olfactory filaments of the Crabs, they may also perform similar functions,—are questions the due discussion of which would lead us too far from our subject. Nevertheless it may be remarked that in both species, especially in _Ocypoda,_ the olfactory filaments in their ordinary situation are very much reduced, and when they are in the water their flagella never perform the peculiar beating movements which may be observed in other Crabs, and even in the larger _Gelasimus_; moreover, the organ of smell must probably be sought in these air-breathing Crabs, as in the air-breathing Vertebrata, at the entrance to the respiratory cavity.  So much for the facts with regard to the aerial respiration of the Crabs. It has already been indicated why Darwin’s theory requires that when any peculiar arrangements exist for aerial respiration, these will be differently constructed in different families. That experience is in perfect accordance with this requirement is the more in favour of Darwin, because the schoolmen far from being able to foresee or explain such profound differences, must rather regard them as extremely surprising. If, in the nearly allied families of the Ocypodidæ and Grapsoidæ, the closest agreement prevails in all the essential conditions of their structure; if the same plan of structure is slavishly followed in everything else, in the organs of sense, in the articulation of the limbs, in every trabecula and tuft of hairs in the complicated framework of the stomach, and in all the arrangements subserving aquatic respiration, even to the hairs of the flagella employed in cleaning the branchiæ,—why have we suddenly this exception, this complete difference, in connection with aerial respiration?  The schoolmen will scarcely have an answer for this question, except by placing themselves on the theologico-teleological stand-point which has justly fallen into disfavour amongst us, and from which the mode of production of an arrangement is supposed to be explained, if its “adaptation” to the animal can be demonstrated. From this point of view we might certainly say that a widely gaping fissure which had nothing prejudicial in it to _ Aratus Pisonii_ among the foliage of the mangrove bushes, was not suitable to the _Ocypoda_ living in sand; that in the latter, in order to prevent the penetration of the sand, the orifice of the branchial cavity must be placed at its lowest part, directed downwards, and concealed between broad surfaces fringed with protective brushes of hair. It is far from the intention of these pages to enter upon a general refutation of this theory of adaptation. Indeed there is scarcely anything essential to be added to the many admirable remarks that have been made upon this subject since the time of Spinoza. But this may be remarked, that I regard it as one of the most important services of the Darwinian theory that it has deprived those considerations of usefulness which are still undeniable in the domain of life, of their mystical supremacy. In the case before us it is sufficient to refer to the Gelasimus of the mangrove swamps, which shares the same conditions of life with various Grapsoidæ and yet does not agree with them, but with the arenicolous _Ocypoda._   [1] As this was not observed in the sea, but in glass vessels  containing sea-water, it might be supposed that the animals become  exhausted and die, not because they are under water but because they  have consumed all the oxygen which it contained. I therefore put into  the same water from which I had just taken an unconscious _Ocypoda,_  with its legs hanging loosely down, a specimen of _Lupea diacantha_  which had been reduced to the same state by being kept in the air, and  this recovered in the water just as the _Ocypoda_ did in the air.    [2] This smaller _Gelasimus_ is also remarkable because the  chameleon-like change of colour exhibited by many Crabs occurs very  strikingly in it. The carapace of a male which I have now before me  shone with a dazzling white in its hinder parts five minutes since  when I captured it, at present it shows a dull gray tint at the same  place.     CHAPTER VI. STRUCTURE OF THE HEART IN THE EDRIOPHTHALMA.   Scarcely less striking than the example of the air-breathing Crabs, is the behaviour of the heart in the great section Edriophthalma, which may advantageously be divided, after the example of Dana and Spence Bate, only into two orders, the Amphipoda and the Isopoda.  In the Amphipoda, to which the above-mentioned naturalists correctly refer the Caprellidæ and Cyamidæ (Latreille’s _Læmodipoda_), the heart has always the same position; it extends in the form of a long tube through the six segments following the head, and has three pairs of fissures, furnished with valves, for the entrance of the blood, situated in the second, third, and fourth of these segments. It was found to be of this structure by La Valette in _Niphargus_ (_Gammarus puteanus_), and by Claus in _Phronima_; and I have found it to be the same in a considerable number of species belonging to the most different families.[1]  The sole unimportant exception which I have hitherto met with is presented by the genus _Brachyscelus,_[2] in which the heart possesses only two pairs of fissures, as it extends forward only into the second body-segment, and is destitute of the pair of fissures situated in this segment in other forms.[3]  Considering this uniformity presented by the heart in the entire order of the Amphipoda, it cannot but seem very remarkable, that in the very next order of the Isopoda, we find it to be one of the most changeable organs.  In the cheliferous Isopods (_Tanais_) the heart resembles that of the Amphipoda in its elongated tubular form, as well as in the number and position of the fissures, but with this difference, that the two fissures of each pair do not lie directly opposite each other.

Heart of a young _Anilocra._ Fig. 16. Abdomen of the male of _Entoniscus Cancrorum. h._ Heart. _l._ Liver.   In all other Isopoda the heart is removed towards the abdomen. In the wonderfully deformed parasitic Isopods of the _Porcellanæ_ (_Entoniscus porcellanæ_), the spherical heart of the female is confined to a short space of the elongated first abdominal segment, and seems to possess only a single pair of fissures. In the male of _Entoniscus Cancrorum_ (n. sp.), the heart (F"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6475"],["title","Facts and Arguments for Darwin (#6)"],["body","ig. 16) is situated in the third abdominal segment. In the _Cassidinæ,_ the heart (Fig. 14) is likewise short and furnished with two pairs of fissures, situated in the last segment of the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen. Lastly, in a young _Anilocra,_ I find the heart (Fig. 15) extending through the whole length of the abdomen and furnished with four (or five?) fissures, which are not placed in pairs but alternately to the right and left in successive segments. In other animals of this order, which I have as yet only cursorily examined, further differences will no doubt occur. But why, in two orders so nearly allied to each other, should we find in the one such a constancy, in the other such a variability, of the same highly important organ? From the schoolmen we need expect no explanation, they will either decline the discussion of the “wherefore” as foreign to their province, as lying beyond the boundaries of Natural History, or seek to put down the importunate question by means of a sounding paraphrase of the facts, abundantly sprinkled with Greek words. As I have unfortunately forgotten my Greek, the second way out of the difficulty is closed to me; but as I luckily reckon myself not amongst the incorporated masters, but, to use Baron von Liebig’s expression, amongst the “promenaders on the outskirts of Natural History,” this affected hesitation of the schoolmen cannot dissuade me from seeking an answer, which indeed presents itself most naturally from Darwin’s point of view.  As not only the _Tanaides_ (which reasons elsewhere stated (_vide suprà_) justify us in regarding as particularly nearly related to the primitive Isopod) and the Amphipoda, but also the Decapod Crustacea, possess a heart with three pairs of fissures essentially in the same position; and as the same position of the heart recurs (_vide infrà_) even in the embryos of the Mantis-Shrimps (_Squilla_), in which the heart of the adult animal, and even, as I have elsewhere shown, that of the larvæ when still far from maturity, extends in the form of a long tube with numerous openings far into the abdomen, we must unhesitatingly regard the heart of the Amphipoda as the primitive form of that organ in the Edriophthalma. As, moreover, in these animals the blood flows from the respiratory organs to the heart without vessels, it is very easy to see how advantageous it must be to them to have these organs as much approximated as possible. We have reason to regard as the primitive mode of respiration, that occurring in _Tanais_ (_vide suprà_). Now, where, as in the majority of the Isopoda, branchiæ were developed upon the abdomen, the position and structure of the heart underwent a change, as it approached them more nearly, but without the reproduction of a common plan for these earlier modes of structure, either because this transformation of the heart took place only after the division of the primary form into subordinate groups, or because, at least at the time of this division, the varying heart had not yet become fixed in any new form. Where, on the contrary, respiration remained with the anterior part of the body,—whether in the primitive fashion of Zoëa, as in the _Tanaides,_ or by the development of branchiæ on the thorax, as in the Amphipoda,—the primitive form of the heart was inherited unchanged, because any variations which might make their appearance were rather injurious than advantageous, and disappeared again immediately.  I close this series of isolated examples with an observation which indeed only half belongs to the province of the Crustacea to which these pages ought to be confined, and which also has no further connexion with the preceding circumstances than that of being an “intelligible and intelligence-bringing fact” only from the point of view of Darwin’s theory. To-day as I was opening a specimen of _Lepas anatifera_ in order to compare the animal with the description in Darwin’s ‘Monograph on the Subclass Cirripedia,’ I found in the shell of this Cirripede, a blood-red Annelide, with a short, flat body, about half an inch long and two lines in breadth, with twenty-five body-segments, and without projecting setigerous tubercles or jointed cirri. The small cephalic lobe bore four eyes and five tentacles; each body-segment had on each side at the margin a tuft of simple setæ directed obliquely upwards, and at some distance from this, upon the ventral surface, a group of thicker setæ with a strongly uncinate bidentate apex. There was above _each_ of the lateral tufts of bristles a branchia, simple on a few of the foremost segments, and then strongly arborescent to the end of the body. The animal, a female filled with ova, evidently, from these characters, belongs to the family of the Amphinomidæ; the only family the members of which, being excellent swimmers, live in the open sea.  That this animal had not strayed accidentally into the _Lepas,_ but appertained to it as a regular and permanent guest, is evidenced by its considerable size in proportion to the narrow entrance of the test of the _Lepas,_ by the complete absence of the iridescence which usually distinguishes the skin of free Annelides and especially of the Amphinomidæ, by the formation and position of the inferior setæ, etc. But that a worm belonging to this particular family Amphinomidæ living in the high sea, occurs as a guest in the _Lepas,_ which also floats in the sea attached to wood, etc., is at once intelligible from the stand-point of the Darwinian theory, whilst the relationship of this parasite to the free-living worms of the open sea remains perfectly unintelligible under the supposition that it was independently created for dwelling in the _Lepas._  But however favourable the examples hitherto referred to may be for Darwin, the objection may be raised against them, and that with perfect justice, that they are only isolated facts, which, when the considerations founded upon them are carried far beyond what is immediately given, may only too easily lead us from the right path, with the deceptive glimmer of an _ignis fatuus._ The higher the structure to be raised, the wider must be the assuring base of well-sifted facts.  Let us turn then to a wider field, that of the developmental history of the Crustacea, upon which science has already brought together a varied abundance of remarkable facts, which, however, have remained a barren accumulation of unmanageable raw-material, and let us see how, under Darwin’s hand, these scattered stones unite to form a well-jointed structure, in which everything, bearing and being borne, finds its significant place. Under Darwin’s hand! for I shall have nothing to do except just to place the building stones in the position which his theory indicates for them. “When kings build, the carters have to work.”   [1] The young animals in the egg, a little before their exclusion, are  usually particularly convenient for the observation of the fissures in  the heart; they are generally sufficiently transparent, the movements  of the heart are less violent than at a later period, and they lie  still even without the pressure of a glass cover. Considering the  common opinion as to the distribution of the Amphipoda, namely, that  they increase in multiplicity towards the poles, and diminish towards  the equator, it may seem strange that I speak of a considerable number  of species on a subtropical coast. I therefore remark that in a few  months and without examining any depths inaccessible from the shore, I  obtained 38 different species, of which 34 are new, which, with the  previously known species (principally described by Dana) gives 60  Brazilian Amphipoda, whilst Kröyer in his ‘Grönlands Amfipoder’ was  acquainted with only 28 species, including 2 Læmodipoda, from the  Arctic Seas, although these had been investigated by a far greater  number of Naturalists.    [2] According to Milne-Edwards’ arrangement the females of this genus  would belong to the “Hypérines ordinaires” and the previously unknown  males to the “Hypérines anormales,” the distinguishing character of  which, namely the curiously zigzagged inferior antennæ, is only a  sexual peculiarity of the male animals. In systematising from single  dead specimens, as to the sex, age, etc. of which nothing is known,  similar errors are unavoidable. Thus, in order to give another example  of very recent date, a celebrated Ichthyologist, Bleeker, has lately  distinguished two groups of the Cyprinodontes as follows: some, the  Cyprinodontini, have a “pinna analis non elongata,” and the others,  the Aplocheilini, a “pinna analis elongata”: according to this the  female of a little fish which is very abundant here would belong to  the first, and the male to the second group. Such mistakes, as already  stated, are unavoidable by the “dry-skin” philosopher, and therefore  excusable; but they nevertheless prove in how random a fashion the  present systematic zoology frequently goes on, without principles or  sure foundations, and how much it is in want of the infallible  touchstone for the value of the different characters, which Darwin’s  theory promises to furnish.    [3] I find, in Milne-Edwards’ ‘Leçons sur la Physiol. et l’Anat.  comp.’ 3 page 197, the statement that, according to Frey and Leuckart,  the heart of _Caprella linearis_ possesses _five_ pairs of fissures. I  have examined perfectly transparent young Caprellæ (probably the young  of Caprella attenuata, Dana, with which they occurred), but can only  find the usual three pairs.     CHAPTER VII. STRUCTURE OF THE HEART IN THE EDRIOPHTHALMA.   Let us first glance over the extant facts.  Among the Stalk-eyed Crustacea (_Podophthalma_) we know only a very few species which quit the egg in the form of their parents, with the full number of well-jointed appendages to the body. This is the case according to Rathke[1] in the European fresh-water Crayfish, and according to Westwood in a West Indian Land Crab (_Gec"]]]
