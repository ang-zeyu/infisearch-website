CHRISTMAS EVE    ROBERT BROWNING      I    Out of the little chapel I burst     Into the fresh night-air again.   Five minutes full, I waited first     In the doorway, to escape the rain   That drove in gusts down the common's centre     At the edge of which the chapel stands,   Before I plucked up heart to enter.     Heaven knows how many sorts of hands   Reached past me, groping for the latch   Of the inner door that hung on catch   More obstinate the more they fumbled,     Till, giving way at last with a scold   Of the crazy hinge, in squeezed or tumbled     One sheep more to the rest in fold,   And left me irresolute, standing sentry   In the sheepfold's lath-and-plaster entry,   Six feet long by three feet wide,   Partitioned off from the vast inside--     I blocked up half of it at least.   No remedy; the rain kept driving.     They eyed me much as some wild beast,   That congregation, still arriving,   Some of them by the main road, white   A long way past me into the night,   Skirting the common, then diverging;   Not a few suddenly emerging   From the common's self thro' the paling-gaps   --They house in the gravel-pits perhaps,   Where the road stops short with its safeguard border   Of lamps, as tired of such disorder;--   But the most turned in yet more abruptly     From a certain squalid knot of alleys,   Where the town's bad blood once slept corruptly,     Which now the little chapel rallies   And leads into day again,--its priestliness   Lending itself to hide their beastliness   So cleverly (thanks in part to the mason),   And putting so cheery a whitewashed face on   Those neophytes too much in lack of it,     That, where you cross the common as I did,     And meet the party thus presided,   \"Mount Zion\" with Love-lane at the back of it,   They front you as little disconcerted   As, bound for the hills, her fate averted,   And her wicked people made to mind him,   Lot might have marched with Gomorrah   behind him.     II    Well, from the road, the lanes or the common,   In came the flock: the fat weary woman,   Panting and bewildered, down-clapping     Her umbrella with a mighty report,   Grounded it by me, wry and flapping,     A wreck of whalebones; then, with snort,   Like a startled horse, at the interloper   (Who humbly knew himself improper,   But could not shrink up small enough)   --Round to the door, and in,--the gruff   Hinge's invariable scold   Making my very blood run cold.   Prompt in the wake of her, up-pattered   On broken clogs, the many-tattered   Little old-faced peaking sister-turned-mother   Of the sickly babe she tried to smother   Somehow up, with its spotted face,   From the cold, on her breast, the one warm place;   She too must stop, wring the poor ends dry   Of a draggled shawl, and add thereby   Her tribute to the door-mat, sopping   Already from my own clothes' dropping,   Which yet she seemed to grudge I should stand on:     Then, stooping down to take off her pattens,     She bore them defiantly, in each hand one,   Planted together before her breast   And its babe, as good as a lance in rest.     Close on her heels, the dingy satins   Of a female something, past me flitted,     With lips as much too white, as a streak     Lay far too red on each hollow cheek;   And it seemed the very door-hinge pitied   All that was left of a woman once,   Holding at least its tongue for the nonce.   Then a tall yellow man, like the Penitent Thief,   With his jaw bound up in a handkerchief,   And eyelids screwed together tight,   Led himself in by some inner light.   And, except from him, from each that entered,     I got the same interrogation--   \"What, you the alien, you have ventured     \"To take with us, the elect, your station?   \"A carer for none of it, a Gallio!\"--     Thus, plain as print, I read the glance   At a common prey, in each countenance     As of huntsman giving his hounds the tallyho.   And, when the door's cry drowned their wonder,     The draught, it always sent in shutting,   Made the flame of the single tallow candle   In the cracked square lantern I stood under,     Shoot its blue lip at me, rebutting   As it were, the luckless cause of scandal:   I verily fancied the zealous light   (In the chapel's secret, too!) for spite   Would shudder itself clean off the wick,   With the airs of a Saint John's Candlestick.    [Footnote: See Rev. i. 20.]   There was no standing it much longer.   \"Good folks,\" thought I, as resolve grew stronger,   \"This way you perform the Grand-Inquisitor   \"When the weather sends you a chance visitor?   \"You are the men, and wisdom shall die with you,   \"And none of the old Seven Churches vie with you!   \"But still, despite the pretty perfection     \"To which you carry your trick of exclusiveness,   \"And, taking God's word under wise protection,     \"Correct its tendency to diffusiveness,   \"And bid one reach it over hot ploughshares,--     \"Still, as I say, though you've found salvation,   \"If I should choose to cry, as now, 'Shares!'--     \"See if the best of you bars me my ration!   \"I prefer, if you please, for my expounder   \"Of the laws of the feast, the feast's own Founder;   \"Mine's the same right with your poorest and sickliest     \"Supposing I don the marriage vestiment:     \"So shut your mouth and open your Testament,   \"And carve me my portion at your quickliest!\"   Accordingly, as a shoemaker's lad     With wizened face in want of soap,     And wet apron wound round his waist like a rope,   (After stopping outside, for his cough was bad,   To get the fit over, poor gentle creature,   And so avoid disturbing the preacher)   --Passed in, I sent my elbow spikewise   At the shutting door, and entered likewise,   Received the hinge's accustomed greeting,     And crossed the threshold's magic pentacle,     And found myself in full conventicle,   --To wit, in Zion Chapel Meeting,   On the Christmas-Eve of 'Forty-nine,     Which, calling its flock to their special clover,     Found all assembled and one sheep over,   Whose lot, as the weather pleased, was mine.     III    I very soon had enough of it.     The hot smell and the human noises,   And my neighbour's coat, the greasy cuff of it,     Were a pebble-stone that a child's hand poises,   Compared with the pig-of-lead-like pressure     Of the preaching man's immense stupidity,   As he poured his doctrine forth, full measure,     To meet his audience's avidity.   You needed not the wit of the Sibyl     To guess the cause of it all, in a twinkling:     No sooner our friend had got an inkling   Of treasure hid in the Holy Bible,   (Whene'er 'twas the thought first struck him,   How death, at unawares, might duck him   Deeper than the grave, and quench   The gin-shop's light in hell's grim drench)   Than he handled it so, in fine irreverence,     As to hug the book of books to pieces:   And, a patchwork of chapters and texts in severance,     Not improved by the private dog's-ears and creases,   Having clothed his own soul with, he'd fain see equipt yours,--   So tossed you again your Holy Scriptures.   And you picked them up, in a sense, no doubt:     Nay, had but a single face of my neighbours     Appeared to suspect that the preacher's labours   Were help which the world could be saved without,   'Tis odds but I might have borne in quiet   A qualm or two at my spiritual diet,   Or (who can tell?) perchance even mustered     Somewhat to urge in behalf of the sermon:   But the flock sat on, divinely flustered,     Sniffing, methought, its dew of Hermon   With such content in every snuffle,   As the devil inside us loves to ruffle.   My old fat woman purred with pleasure,     And thumb round thumb went twirling faster,   While she, to his periods keeping measure,     Maternally devoured the pastor.   The man with the handkerchief untied it,   Showed us a horrible wen inside it,   Gave his eyelids yet another screwing,   And rocked himself as the woman was doing.   The shoemaker's lad, discreetly choking,   Kept down his cough. 'Twas too provoking!   My gorge rose at the nonsense and stuff of it;     So, saying like Eve when she plucked the apple,     \"I wanted a taste, and now there's enough of it,\"   I flung out of the little chapel.     IV    There was a lull in the rain, a lull     In the wind too; the moon was risen,   And would have shone out pure and full,     But for the ramparted cloud-prison,   Block on block built up in the West,   For what purpose the wind knows best,   Who changes his mind continually.   And the empty other half of the sky   Seemed in its silence as if it knew   What, any moment, might look through   A chance gap in that fortress massy:--     Through its fissures you got hints     Of the flying moon, by the shifting tints,   Now, a dull lion-colour, now, brassy   Burning to yellow, and whitest yellow,   Like furnace-smoke just ere flames bellow,   All a-simmer with intense strain   To let her through,--then blank again,   At the hope of her appearance failing.   Just by the chapel, a break in the railing   Shows a narrow path directly across;   'Tis ever dry walking there, on the moss--   Besides, you go gently all the way uphill.     I stooped under and soon felt better;   My head grew lighter, my limbs more supple,     As I walked on, glad to have slipt the fetter.   My mind was full of the scene I had left,     That placid flock, that pastor vociferant,     --How this outside was pure and different!   The sermon, now--what a mingled weft   Of good and ill! Were either less,     Its fellow had coloured the whole distinctly;   But alas for the excellent earnestness,     And the truths, quite true if stated succinctly,   But as surely false, in their quaint presentment,   However to pastor and flock's contentment!   Say rather, such truths looked false to your eyes,     With his provings and parallels twisted and twined,   Till how could you know them, grown double"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6670"],["title","Christmas Eve (#1)"],["body","size     In the natural fog of the good man's mind,   Like yonder spots of our roadside lamps,   Haloed about with the common's damps?   Truth remains true, the fault's in the prover;     The zeal was good, and the aspiration;   And yet, and yet, yet, fifty times over,     Pharaoh received no demonstration,   By his Baker's dream of Basket Three,   Of the doctrine of the Trinity,--   Although, as our preacher thus embellished it,   Apparently his hearers relished it   With so unfeigned a gust--who knows if   They did not prefer our friend to Joseph?   But so it is everywhere, one way with all of them!     These people have really felt, no doubt,   A something, the motion they style the Call of them;     And this is their method of bringing about,   By a mechanism of words and tones,    (So many texts in so many groans)   A sort of reviving and reproducing,     More or less perfectly, (who can tell?)   The mood itself, which strengthens by using;     And how that happens, I understand well.   A tune was born in my head last week,   Out of the thump-thump and shriek-shriek     Of the train, as I came by it, up from Manchester;   And when, next week, I take it back again,   My head will sing to the engine's clack again,     While it only makes my neighbour's haunches stir,   --Finding no dormant musical sprout   In him, as in me, to be jolted out.   'Tis the taught already that profits by teaching;   He gets no more from the railway's preaching     Than, from this preacher who does the rail's office, I:   Whom therefore the flock cast a jealous eye on.   Still, why paint over their door \"Mount Zion,\"   To which all flesh shall come, saith the prophecy?     V    But wherefore be harsh on a single case?     After how many modes, this Christmas Eve,   Does the self-same weary thing take place?     The same endeavour to make you believe,   And with much the same effect, no more:     Each method abundantly convincing,   As I say, to those convinced before,     But scarce to be swallowed without wincing   By the not-as-yet-convinced. For me,   I have my own church equally:   And in this church my faith sprang first!     (I said, as I reached the rising ground,   And the wind began again, with a burst     Of rain in my face, and a glad rebound   From the heart beneath, as if, God speeding me,   I entered his church-door, nature leading me)   --In youth I look to these very skies,   And probing their immensities,   I found God there, his visible power;     Yet felt in my heart, amid all its sense     Of the power, an equal evidence   That his love, there too, was the nobler dower.   For the loving worm within its clod,   Were diviner than a loveless god   Amid his worlds, I will dare to say.     You know what I mean: God's all, man's nought:     But also, God, whose pleasure brought   Man into being, stands away     As it were a handbreadth off, to give   Room for the newly-made to live,   And look at him from a place apart,   And use his gifts of brain and heart,   Given, indeed, but to keep for ever.   Who speaks of man, then, must not sever   Man's very elements from man,   Saying, \"But all is God's\"--whose plan   Was to create man and then leave him   Able, his own word saith, to grieve him   But able to glorify him too,   As a mere machine could never do,   That prayed or praised, all unaware   Of its fitness for aught but praise and prayer,   Made perfect as a thing of course.   Man, therefore, stands on his own stock   Of love and power as a pin-point rock:   And, looking to God who ordained divorce   Of the rock from his boundless continent,   Sees, in his power made evident,   Only excess by a million-fold   O'er the power God gave man in the mould.   For, note: man's hand, first formed to carry   A few pounds' weight, when taught to marry   Its strength with an engine's, lifts a mountain,     --Advancing in power by one degree;     And why count steps through eternity?   But love is the ever-springing fountain:   Man may enlarge or narrow his bed   For the water's play, but the water-head--   How can he multiply or reduce it?     As easy create it, as cause it to cease;   He may profit by it, or abuse it,     But 'tis not a thing to bear increase   As power does: be love less or more     In the heart of man, he keeps it shut     Or opes it wide, as he pleases, but   Love's sum remains what it was before.   So, gazing up, in my youth, at love   As seen through power, ever above   All modes which make it manifest,   My soul brought all to a single test--   That he, the Eternal First and Last,   Who, in his power, had so surpassed   All man conceives of what is might,--   Whose wisdom, too, showed infinite,   --Would prove as infinitely good;   Would never, (my soul understood,)   With power to work all love desires,   Bestow e'en less than man requires;   That he who endlessly was teaching,   Above my spirit's utmost reaching,   What love can do in the leaf or stone,   (So that to master this alone,   This done in the stone or leaf for me,   I must go on learning endlessly)   Would never need that I, in turn,     Should point him out defect unheeded,   And show that God had yet to learn     What the meanest human creature needed,   --Not life, to wit, for a few short years,   Tracking his way through doubts and fears,   While the stupid earth on which I stay     Suffers no change, but passive adds     Its myriad years to myriads,   Though I, he gave it to, decay,   Seeing death come and choose about me,   And my dearest ones depart without me.   No: love which, on earth, amid all the shows of it,     Has ever been seen the sole good of life in it,   The love, ever growing there, spite of the strife in it.     Shall arise, made perfect, from death's repose of it,   And I shall behold thee, face to face,   O God, and in thy light retrace   How in all I loved here, still wast thou!   Whom pressing to, then, as I fain would now,   I shall find as able to satiate     The love, thy gift, as my spirit's wonder   Thou art able to quicken and sublimate,     With this sky of thine, that I now walk under,   And glory in thee for, as I gaze   Thus, thus! Oh, let men keep their ways   Of seeking thee in a narrow shrine--   Be this my way! And this is mine!     VI    For lo, what think you? suddenly   The rain and the wind ceased, and the sky   Received at once the full fruition   Of the moon's consummate apparition.   The black cloud-barricade was riven,   Ruined beneath her feet, and driven   Deep in the West; while, bare and breathless,     North and South and East lay ready   For a glorious thing that, dauntless, deathless,     Sprang across them and stood steady.   'Twas a moon-rainbow, vast and perfect,   From heaven to heaven extending, perfect   As the mother-moon's self, full in face.   It rose, distinctly at the base     With its seven proper colours chorded,   Which still, in the rising, were compressed,   Until at last they coalesced,     And supreme the spectral creature lorded   In a triumph of whitest white,--   Above which intervened the night.   But above night too, like only the next,     The second of a wondrous sequence,     Reaching in rare and rarer frequence,   Till the heaven of heavens were circumflexed,   Another rainbow rose, a mightier,   Fainter, flushier and flightier,--   Rapture dying along its verge.   Oh, whose foot shall I see emerge,   Whose, from the straining topmost dark,   On to the keystone of that arc?     VII    This sight was shown me, there and then,--   Me, out of a world of men,   Singled forth, as the chance might hap   To another if, in a thunderclap   Where I heard noise and you saw flame,   Some one man knew God called his name.   For me, I think I said, \"Appear!   \"Good were it to be ever here.   \"If thou wilt, let me build to thee   \"Service-tabernacles three,   \"Where, forever in thy presence,   \"In ecstatic acquiescence,   \"Far alike from thriftless learning   \"And ignorance's undiscerning,   \"I may worship and remain!\"     Thus at the show above me, gazing   With upturned eyes, I felt my brain     Glutted with the glory, blazing   Throughout its whole mass, over and under   Until at length it burst asunder   And out of it bodily there streamed,   The too-much glory, as it seemed,   Passing from out me to the ground,   Then palely serpentining round   Into the dark with mazy error.     VIII    All at once I looked up with terror.   He was there.   He himself with his human air.   On the narrow pathway, just before.   I saw the back of him, no more--   He had left the chapel, then, as I.   I forgot all about the sky.   No face: only the sight   Of a sweepy garment, vast and white,   With a hem that I could recognize.   I felt terror, no surprise;   My mind filled with the cataract,   At one bound of the mighty fact.   \"I remember, he did say     \"Doubtless that, to this world's end,   \"Where two or three should meet and pray,     \"He would be in their midst, their friend;   \"Certainly he was there with them!\"     And my pulses leaped for joy     Of the golden thought without alloy,   Then I saw his very vesture's hem.   Then rushed the blood back, cold and clear,   With a fresh enhancing shiver of fear;   And I hastened, cried out while I pressed   To the salvation of the vest,   \"But not so, Lord! It cannot be   \"That thou, indeed, art leaving me--   \"Me, that have despised thy friends!   \"Did my heart make no amends?   \"Thou art the love of God--above   \"His power, didst hear me place his love,   \"And that was leaving the world for thee.   \"Therefore thou must not turn from me   \"As I had chosen the other part!   \"Folly and pride o'ercame my heart.   \"Our best is bad, nor bears thy test;   \"Still, it should be our very best.   \"I thought it best that thou, the spirit,     \"Be worshipped in spirit and in truth,   \"And in beauty, as even we require it--     \"Not in the forms burlesque, uncouth,   \"I left but now, as scarcely fitted   \"For thee: I knew not what I pitied.
