Well. _I am not married yet, though with a man who, I am convinced, adores me_.--Yes, yes, I dare say Isaac is very fond of her. _But I shall anxiously expect your answer, in which, should I be so fortunate as to receive your consent, you will make completely happy your ever affectionate daughter,_ LOUISA.  My consent! to be sure she shall have it! Egad, I was never better pleased--I have fulfilled my resolution--I knew I should. Oh, there's nothing like obstinacy! Lewis! [_Calls_.]   _Re-enter_ SERVANT.  Let the man who brought the last letter, wait; and get me a pen and ink below.--[_Exit_ SERVANT.] I am impatient to set poor Louisa's heart at rest. [_Calls_.]Holloa! Lewis! Sancho!   _Enter_ SERVANTS.  See that there be a noble supper provided in the saloon to-night; serve up my best wines, and let me have music, d'ye hear?  _Ser_. Yes, sir.  _Don Jer_. And order all my doors to be thrown open; admit all guests, with masks or without masks.--[_Exeunt_ SERVANTS.] I'faith, we'll have a night of it! and I'll let them see how merry an old man can be.  SONG.    Oh, the days when I was young.   When I laugh'd in fortune's spite;   Talk'd of love the whole day long,   And with nectar crown'd the night!   Then it was, old Father Care,   Little reck'd I of thy frown;   Half thy malice youth could bear,   And the rest a bumper drown.    Truth, they say, lies in a well,   Why, I vow I ne'er could see;   Let the water-drinkers tell,   There it always lay for me.   For when sparkling wine went round,   Never saw I falsehood's mask;   But still honest truth I found   In the bottom of each flask.    True, at length my vigour's flown,   I have years to bring decay;   Few the locks that now I own,   And the few I have are grey.   Yet, old Jerome, thou mayst boast,   While thy spirits do not tire;   Still beneath thy age's frost   Glows a spark of youthful fire. [_Exit_.]     SCENE II.--_The New Piazza_.  _Enter_ DON FERDINAND _and_ LOPEZ.   _Don Ferd_. What, could you gather no tidings of her? nor guess where she was gone? O Clara! Clara!  _Lop_. In truth, sir, I could not. That she was run away from her father, was in everybody's mouth; and that Don Guzman was in pursuit of her, was also a very common report. Where she was gone, or what was become of her, no one could take upon them to say.  _Don Ferd_. 'Sdeath and fury, you blockhead! she can't be out of Seville.  _Lop_. So I said to myself, sir. 'Sdeath and fury, you blockhead, says I, she can't be out of Seville. Then some said, she had hanged herself for love; and others have it, Don Antonio had carried her off.  _Don Ferd_. 'Tis false, scoundrel! no one said that.  _Lop_. Then I misunderstood them, sir.  _Don Ferd_. Go, fool, get home! and never let me see you again till you bring me news of her.--[_Exit_ LOPEZ.] Oh, how my fondness for this ungrateful girl has hurt my disposition.   _Enter_ ISAAC.  _Isaac_. So, I have her safe, and have only to find a priest to marry us. Antonio now may marry Clara, or not, if he pleases.  _Don Ferd_. What! what was that you said of Clara?  _Isaac_. Oh, Ferdinand! my brother-in-law that shall be, who thought of meeting you?  _Don Ferd_. But what of Clara?  _Isaac_. I'faith, you shall hear. This morning, as I was coming down, I met a pretty damsel, who told me her name was Clara d'Almanza, and begged my protection.  _Don Ferd_. How!  _Isaac_. She said she had eloped from her father, Don Guzman, but that love for a young gentleman in Seville was the cause.  _Don Ferd_. Oh, Heavens! did she confess it?  _Isaac_. Oh, yes, she confessed at once. But then, says she, my lover is not informed of my flight, nor suspects my intention.  _Don Ferd_. [_Aside_.] Dear creature! no more I did indeed! Oh, I am the happiest fellow!--[_Aloud_.] Well, Isaac?  _Isaac_. Why then she entreated me to find him out for her, and bring him to her.  _Don Ferd_. Good Heavens, how lucky! Well, come along, let's lose no time. [_Pulling him_.]  _Isaac_. Zooks! where are we to go?  _Don Ferd_. Why, did anything more pass?  _Isaac_. Anything more! yes; the end on't was, that I was moved with her speeches, and complied with her desires.  _Don Ferd_. Well and where is she?  _Isaac_. Where is she? why, don't I tell you? I complied with her request, and left her safe in the arms of her lover.  _Don Ferd_. 'Sdeath, you trifle with me!--I have never seen her.  _Isaac_. You! O Lud no! how the devil should you? 'Twas Antonio she wanted; and with Antonio I left her.  _Don Ferd_. [_Aside_.] Hell and madness!--[_Aloud_.] What, Antonio d'Ercilla?  _Isaac_. Ay, ay, the very man; and the best part of it was, he was shy of taking her at first. He talked a good deal about honour, and conscience, and deceiving some dear friend; but, Lord, we soon overruled that!  _Don Ferd_. You did!  _Isaac_. Oh, yes, presently.--Such deceit! says he.--Pish! says the lady, tricking is all fair in love. But then, my friend, says he.-- Psha! damn your friend, says I. So, poor wretch, he has no chance.-- No, no; he may hang himself as soon as he pleases.  _Don Ferd_. [_Aside_.] I must go, or I shall betray myself.  _Isaac_. But stay, Ferdinand, you han't heard the best of the joke.  _Don Ferd_. Curse on your joke!  _Isaac_. Good lack! what's the matter now? I thought to have diverted you.  _Don Ferd_. Be racked! tortured! damned!  _Isaac_. Why, sure you are not the poor devil of a lover, are you?-- I'faith, as sure as can be, he is! This is a better joke than t'other. Ha! ha! ha!  _Don Ferd_. What! do you laugh? you vile, mischievous varlet!-- [_Collars him_.] But that you're beneath my anger, I'd tear your heart out! [_Throws him from him_.]  _Isaac_. O mercy! here's usage for a brother-in-law!  _Don Ferd_. But, hark ye, rascal! tell me directly where these false friends are gone, or, by my soul----[_Draws_.]  _Isaac_. For Heaven's sake, now, my dear brother-in-law, don't be in a rage! I'll recollect as well as I can.  _Don Ferd_. Be quick, then!  _Isaac_. I will, I will!--but people's memories differ; some have a treacherous memory: now mine is a cowardly memory--it takes to its heels at sight of a drawn sword--it does i'faith; and I could as soon fight as recollect.  _Don Ferd_. Zounds! tell me the truth, and I won't hurt you.  _Isaac_. No, no, I know you won't, my dear brother-in-law; but that ill-looking thing there----  _Don Ferd_. What, then, you won't tell me?  _Isaac_. Yes, yes, I will; I'll tell you all, upon my soul!--but why need you listen, sword in hand?  _Don Ferd_. Why, there.--[_Puts up_.] Now.  _Isaac_. Why, then, I believe they are gone to--that is, my friend Carlos told me he had left Donna Clara--dear Ferdinand, keep your hands off--at the convent of St. Catherine.  _Don Ferd_. St. Catherine!  _Isaac_. Yes; and that Antonio was to come to her there.  _Don Ferd_. Is this the truth?  _Isaac_. It is indeed; and all I know, as I hope for life!  _Don Ferd_. Well, coward, take your life; 'tis that false, dishonourable Antonio, who shall feel my vengeance.  _Isaac_. Ay, ay, kill him; cut his throat, and welcome.  _Don Ferd_. But, for Clara! infamy on her! she is not worth my resentment.  _Isaac_. No more she is, my dear brother-in-law. I'faith I would not be angry about her; she is not worth it, indeed.  _Don Ferd_. 'Tis false! she is worth the enmity of princes!  _Isaac_. True, true, so she is; and I pity you exceedingly for having lost her.  _Don Ferd_. 'Sdeath, you rascal! how durst you talk of pitying me?  _Isaac_. Oh, dear brother-in-law, I beg pardon! I don't pity you in the least, upon my soul!  _Don Ferd_. Get hence, fool, and provoke me no further; nothing but your insignificance saves you!  _Isaac. [Aside_.] I'faith, then, my insignificance is the best friend I have.--[_Aloud_.] I'm going, dear Ferdinand.--[_Aside_.] What a curst hot hot-headed bully it is! [_Exeunt severally_.]     SCENE III.--_The Garden of the Convent_.  _Enter_ DONNA LOUISA _and_ DONNA CLARA.   _Don. Louisa_. And you really wish my brother may not find you out?  _Don. Clara_. Why else have I concealed myself under this disguise?  _Don. Louisa_. Why, perhaps because the dress becomes you: for you certainly don't intend to be a nun for life.  _Don. Clara_. If, indeed, Ferdinand had not offended me so last night--  _Don. Louisa_. Come, come, it was his fear of losing you made him so rash.  _Don. Clara_. Well, you may think me cruel, but I swear, if he were here this instant, I believe I should forgive him.  SONG.    By him we love offended,   How soon our anger flies!   One day apart, 'tis ended;   Behold him, and it dies.    Last night, your roving brother,   Enraged, I bade depart;   And sure his rude presumption   Deserved to lose my heart.    Yet, were he now before met   In spite of injured pride,   I fear my eyes would pardon   Before my tongue could chide.  _Don. Louisa_. I protest, Clara, I shall begin to think you are seriously resolved to enter on your probation.  _Don. Clara_. And, seriously, I very much doubt whether the character of a nun would not become me best.  _Don. Louisa_. Why, to be sure, the character of a nun is a very becoming one at a masquerade: but no pretty woman, in her senses, ever thought of taking the veil for above a night.  _Don. Clara_. Yonder I see your Antonio is returned--I shall only interrupt you; ah, Louisa, with what happy eagerness you turn to look for him! [_Exit_.]   _Enter_ DON ANTONIO.  _Don Ant_. Well, my Louisa, any news since I left you?  _Don. Louisa_. None. The messenger is not yet returned from my father.  _Don Ant_. Well, I confess, I do not perceive what we are to expect from him.  _Don. Louisa_. I shall be easier, however, in having made the trial: I do not doubt your sincerity, Antonio; but there is a chilling air around poverty, that often kills affection, that was not nursed in it. If we would make love our household god, we had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6731"],["title","The Duenna: A Comic Opera (#7)"],["body","secure him a comfortable roof.  SONG.--_Don Antonio_.    How oft, Louisa, hast thou told,   (Nor wilt thou the fond boast disown,)   Thou wouldst not lose Antonio's love   To reign the partner of a throne!   And by those lips that spoke so kind,   And by that hand I've press'd to mine,   To be the lord of wealth and power,   By heavens, I would not part with thine!    Then how, my soul, can we be poor,   Who own what kingdoms could not buy?   Of this true heart thou shalt be queen,   In serving thee, a monarch I.   Thus uncontroll'd, in mutual bliss,   I rich in love's exhaustless mine,   Do thou snatch treasures from my lips,   And I'll take kingdoms back from thine!   _Enter_ MAID _with a letter_.  _Don. Louisa_. My father's answer, I suppose.  _Don Ant_. My dearest Louisa, you may be assured that it contains nothing but threats and reproaches.  _Don. Louisa_. Let us see, however.--[Reads.] _Dearest daughter, make your lover happy: you have my full consent to marry as your whim has chosen, but be sure come home and sup with your affectionate father_.  _Don Ant_. You jest, Louisa!  _Don. Louisa_. [_Gives him the letter_..] Read! read!  _Don Ant_. 'Tis so, by heavens! Sure there must be some mistake; but that's none of our business.--Now, Louisa, you have no excuse for delay.  _Don. Louisa_. Shall we not then return and thank my father?  _Don Ant_. But first let the priest put it out of his power to recall his word.--I'll fly to procure one.  _Don. Louisa_. Nay, if you part with me again, perhaps you may lose me.  _Don Ant_. Come, then--there is a friar of a neighbouring convent is my friend; you have already been diverted by the manners of a nunnery; let us see whether there is less hypocrisy among the holy fathers.  _Don. Louisa_. I'm afraid not, Antonio--for in religion, as in friendship, they who profess most are the least sincere. [_Exeunt_.]   _Re-enter_ DONNA CLARA.  _Don. Clara_, So, yonder they go, as happy as a mutual and confessed affection can make them, while I am left in solitude. Heigho! love may perhaps excuse the rashness of an elopement from one's friend, but I am sure nothing but the presence of the man we love can support it. Ha! what do I see! Ferdinand, as I live! How could he gain admission? By potent gold, I suppose, as Antonio did. How eager and disturbed he seems! He shall not know me as yet. [_Lets down her veil_.]   _Enter_ DON FERDINAND.  _Don Ferd_. Yes, those were certainly they--my information was right. [_Going_.]  _Don. Clara_. [_Stops him_.] Pray, signor, what is your business here?  _Don Ferd_. No matter--no matter! Oh! they stop.--[_Looks out_.] Yes, that is the perfidious Clara indeed!  _Don. Clara_. So, a jealous error--I'm glad to see him so moved. [_Aside_.]  _Don Ferd_. Her disguise can't conceal her--no, no, I know her too well.  _Don. Clara_. [_Aside_.] Wonderful discernment!--[_Aloud_.] But, signor----  _Don Ferd_. Be quiet, good nun; don't tease me!--By heavens, she leans upon his arm, hangs fondly on it! O woman, woman!  _Don. Clar_. But, signor, who is it you want?  _Don Ferd_. Not you, not you, so prythee don't tease me. Yet pray stay--gentle nun, was it not Donna Clara d'Almanza just parted from you?  _Don. Clara_. Clara d'Almanza, signor, is not yet out of the garden.  _Don Ferd_. Ay, ay, I knew I was right! And pray is not that gentleman, now at the porch with her, Antonio d'Ercilla?  _Don. Clara_. It is indeed, signor.  _Don Ferd_. So, so; but now one question more--can you inform me for what purpose they have gone away?  _Don. Clara_. They are gone to be married, I believe.  _Don Ferd_. Very well--enough. Now if I don't mar their wedding! [_Exit_.]  _Don. Clara_. [_Unveils_.] I thought jealousy had made lovers quick- sighted, but it has made mine blind. Louisa's story accounts to me for this error, and I am glad to find I have power enough over him to make him so unhappy. But why should not I be present at his surprise when undeceived? When he's through the porch, I'll follow him; and, perhaps, Louisa shall not singly be a bride.  SONG.    Adieu, thou dreary pile, where never dies   The sullen echo of repentant sighs!   Ye sister mourners of each lonely cell   Inured to hymns and sorrow, fare ye well!   For happier scenes I fly this darksome grove,   To saints a prison, but a tomb to love! [_Exit_.]     SCENE IV.--_A Court before the Priory_.  _Enter_ ISAAC, _crossing the stage_, DON ANTONIO _following_.   _Don Ant_. What, my friend Isaac!  _Isaac_. What, Antonio! wish me joy! I have Louisa safe.  _Don Ant_. Have you? I wish you joy with all my soul.  _Isaac_. Yes, I come here to procure a priest to marry us.  _Don Ant_. So, then, we are both on the same errand; I am come to look for Father Paul.  _Isaac_. Ha! I'm glad on't--but, i'faith, he must tack me first; my love is waiting.  _Don Ant_. So is mine--I left her in the porch.  _Isaac_. Ay, but I'm in haste to go back to Don Jerome.  _Don Ant_. And so am I too.  _Isaac_. Well, perhaps he'll save time, and marry us both together--or I'll be your father, and you shall be mine. Come along--but you are obliged to me for all this.  _Don Ant_. Yes, yes. [_Exeunt_.]     SCENE V.--_A Room in the Priory_.  FATHER PAUL, FATHER FRANCIS, FATHER AUGUSTINE, _and other_ FRIARS, _discovered at a table drinking_.   GLEE AND CHORUS.    This bottle's the sun of our table,   His beams are rosy wine   We, planets, that are not able   Without his help to shine.   Let mirth and glee abound!   You'll soon grow bright   With borrow'd light,   And shine as he goes round.  _Paul_. Brother Francis, toss the bottle about, and give me your toast.  _Fran_. Have we drunk the Abbess of St. Ursuline?  _Paul_. Yes, yes; she was the last.  _Fran_. Then I'll give you the blue-eyed nun of St. Catherine's.  _Paul_. With all my heart.--[_Drinks_.] Pray, brother Augustine, were there any benefactions left in my absence?  _Aug_. Don Juan Corduba has left a hundred ducats, to remember him in our masses.  _Paul_. Has he? let them be paid to our wine-merchant, and we'll remember him in our cups, which will do just as well. Anything more?  _Aug_. Yes; Baptista, the rich miser, who died last week, has bequeathed us a thousand pistoles, and the silver lamp he used in his own chamber, to burn before the image of St. Anthony.  _Paul_. 'Twas well meant, but we'll employ his money better-- Baptista's bounty shall light the living, not the dead. St. Anthony is not afraid to be left in the dark, though he was.--[_Knocking_.] See who's there.  [FATHER FRANCIS _goes to the door and opens it_.]   _Enter_ PORTER.  _Port_. Here's one without, in pressing haste to speak with Father Paul.  _Fran_. Brother Paul!  [FATHER PAUL _comes from behind a curtain with a glass of wine, and in his hand a piece of cake_.]  _Paul_. Here! how durst you, fellow, thus abruptly break in upon our devotions?  _Port_. I thought they were finished.  _Paul_. No, they were not--were they, brother Francis?  _Fran_. Not by a bottle each.  _Paul_. But neither you nor your fellows mark how the hours go; no, you mind nothing but the gratifying of your appetites; ye eat, and swill, and sleep, and gourmandise, and thrive, while we are wasting in mortification.  _Port_. We ask no more than nature craves.  _Paul_. 'Tis false, ye have more appetites than hairs! and your flushed, sleek, and pampered appearance is the disgrace of our order-- out on't! If you are hungry, can't you be content with the wholesome roots of the earth? and if you are dry, isn't there the crystal spring?--[_Drinks_.] Put this away,--[_Gives the glass_] and show me where I am wanted.--[PORTER _drains the glass_.--PAUL, _going, turns_.] So you would have drunk it if there had been any left! Ah, glutton! glutton! [_Exeunt_.]     SCENE VI.--_The Court before the Priory_.  _Enter_ ISAAC _and_ DON ANTONIO.   _Isaac_. A plaguey while coming, this same father Paul.--He's detained at vespers, I suppose, poor fellow.  _Don Ant_. No, here he comes.   _Enter_ FATHER PAUL.  Good father Paul, I crave your blessing.  _Isaac_. Yes, good father Paul, we are come to beg a favour.  _Paul_. What is it, pray?  _Isaac_. To marry us, good father Paul; and in truth thou dost look like the priest of Hymen.  _Paul_. In short, I may be called so; for I deal in repentance and mortification.  _Isaac_. No, no, thou seemest an officer of Hymen, because thy presence speaks content and good humour.  _Paul_. Alas, my appearance is deceitful. Bloated I am, indeed! for fasting is a windy recreation, and it hath swollen me like a bladder.  _Don Ant_. But thou hast a good fresh colour in thy face, father; rosy, i'faith!  _Paul_. Yes, I have blushed for mankind, till the hue of my shame is as fixed as their vices.  _Isaac_. Good man!  _Paul_. And I have laboured, too, but to what purpose? they continue to sin under my very nose.  _Isaac_. Efecks, father, I should have guessed as much, for your nose seems to be put to the blush more than any other part of your face.  _Paul_. Go, you're a wag.  _Don Ant_. But to the purpose, father--will you officiate for us?  _Paul_. To join young people thus clandestinely is not safe: and, indeed, I have in my heart many weighty reasons against it.  _Don Ant_. And I have in my hand many weighty reasons for it. Isaac, haven't you an argument or two in our favour about you?  _Isaac_. Yes, yes; here is a most unanswerable purse.  _Paul_. For shame! you make me angry: you forget who I am, and when importunate people have forced their trash--ay, into this pocket here-- or into this--why, then the sin was theirs.--[_They put money into his pockets_.] Fie, now how you distress me! I would return it, but that I must touch it that way, and so wrong my oath.  _Don Ant_. Now then, come with us.  _Isaac_. Ay, now give us our title to joy and rapture.  _Paul_. Well, when your hour of repentance comes, don't blame me.  _Don Ant_. [_Aside_.] No bad caution to my friend Isaac.--[_Aloud_.] Well, well, father, do you do your part, and I'll"]]]
