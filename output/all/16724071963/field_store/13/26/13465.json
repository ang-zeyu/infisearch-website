The Squire, left alone, sank on his knees, his face in his hands; his great shoulders shook with the intensity of his grief.  An hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps.  He sprang to the door:  'Well?'  'You had better come now.'  'Is she better?'  'Alas! no.  I fear her minutes are numbered.  School yourself, my dear old friend!  God will help you in this bitter hour.  All you can do now is to make her last moments happy.'  'I know!  I know!' he answered in a voice so calm that his companion wondered.  When they came into the room Margaret was dozing.  When her eyes opened and she found her husband beside her bed there spread over her face a glad look; which, alas! soon changed to one of pain.  She motioned to him to bend down.  He knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow; his arms went tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength he would shield her from all harm.  Her voice came very low and in broken gasps; she was summoning all her strength that she might speak:  'My dear, dear husband, I am so sad at leaving you!  You have made me so happy, and I love you so!  Forgive me, dear, for the pain I know you will suffer when I am gone!  And oh, Stephen, I know you will cherish our little one--yours and mine--when I am gone.  She will have no mother; you will have to be father and mother too.'  'I will hold her in my very heart's core, my darling, as I hold you!'  He could hardly speak from emotion.  She went on:  'And oh, my dear, you will not grieve that she is not a son to carry on your name?'  And then a sudden light came into her eyes; and there was exultation in her weak voice as she said:  'She is to be our only one; let her be indeed our son!  Call her the name we both love!'  For answer he rose and laid his hand very, very tenderly on the babe as he said:  'This dear one, my sweet wife, who will carry your soul in her breast, will be my son; the only son I shall ever have.  All my life long I shall, please Almighty God, so love her--our little Stephen--as you and I love each other!'  She laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her husband and her child.  Then she raised the other weak arm, and placed it round his neck, and their lips met.  Her soul went out in this last kiss.     CHAPTER II--THE HEART OF A CHILD   For some weeks after his wife's death Squire Norman was overwhelmed with grief.  He made a brave effort, however, to go through the routine of his life; and succeeded so far that he preserved an external appearance of bearing his loss with resignation.  But within, all was desolation.  Little Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her father's heart.  The little bundle of nerves which the father took into his arms must have realised with all its senses that, in all that it saw and heard and touched, there was nothing but love and help and protection. Gradually the trust was followed by expectation.  If by some chance the father was late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient and cast persistent, longing glances at the door.  When he came all was joy.  Time went quickly by, and Norman was only recalled to its passing by the growth of his child.  Seedtime and harvest, the many comings of nature's growth were such commonplaces to him, and had been for so many years, that they made on him no impressions of comparison.  But his baby was one and one only.  Any change in it was not only in itself a new experience, but brought into juxtaposition what is with what was.  The changes that began to mark the divergence of sex were positive shocks to him, for they were unexpected.  In the very dawn of babyhood dress had no special import; to his masculine eyes sex was lost in youth.  But, little by little, came the tiny changes which convention has established.  And with each change came to Squire Norman the growing realisation that his child was a woman.  A tiny woman, it is true, and requiring more care and protection and devotion than a bigger one; but still a woman.  The pretty little ways, the eager caresses, the graspings and holdings of the childish hands, the little roguish smiles and pantings and flirtings were all but repetitions in little of the dalliance of long ago.  The father, after all, reads in the same book in which the lover found his knowledge.  At first there was through all his love for his child a certain resentment of her sex.  His old hope of a son had been rooted too deeply to give way easily.  But when the conviction came, and with it the habit of its acknowledgment, there came also a certain resignation, which is the halting-place for satisfaction.  But he never, not then nor afterwards, quite lost the old belief that Stephen was indeed a son. Could there ever have been a doubt, the remembrance of his wife's eyes and of her faint voice, of her hope and her faith, as she placed her baby in his arms would have refused it a resting-place.  This belief tinged all his after-life and moulded his policy with regard to his girl's upbringing.  If she was to be indeed his son as well as his daughter, she must from the first be accustomed to boyish as well as to girlish ways. This, in that she was an only child, was not a difficult matter to accomplish.  Had she had brothers and sisters, matters of her sex would soon have found their own level.  There was one person who objected strongly to any deviation from the conventional rule of a girl's education.  This was Miss Laetitia Rowly, who took after a time, in so far as such a place could be taken, that of the child's mother.  Laetitia Rowly was a young aunt of Squire Rowly of Norwood; the younger sister of his father and some sixteen years his own senior.  When the old Squire's second wife had died, Laetitia, then a conceded spinster of thirty-six, had taken possession of the young Margaret.  When Margaret had married Squire Norman, Miss Rowly was well satisfied; for she had known Stephen Norman all her life.  Though she could have wished a younger bridegroom for her darling, she knew it would be hard to get a better man or one of more suitable station in life.  Also she knew that Margaret loved him, and the woman who had never found the happiness of mutual love in her own life found a pleasure in the romance of true love, even when the wooer was middle-aged.  She had been travelling in the Far East when the belated news of Margaret's death came to her.  When she had arrived home she announced her intention of taking care of Margaret's child, just as she had taken care of Margaret.  For several reasons this could not be done in the same way.  She was not old enough to go and live at Normanstand without exciting comment; and the Squire absolutely refused to allow that his daughter should live anywhere except in his own house.  Educational supervision, exercised at such distance and so intermittently, could neither be complete nor exact.  Though Stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one, and very early in life manifested a dominant nature.  This was a secret pleasure to her father, who, never losing sight of his old idea that she was both son and daughter, took pleasure as well as pride out of each manifestation of her imperial will.  The keen instinct of childhood, which reasons in feminine fashion, and is therefore doubly effective in a woman-child, early grasped the possibilities of her own will.  She learned the measure of her nurse's foot and then of her father's; and so, knowing where lay the bounds of possibility of the achievement of her wishes, she at once avoided trouble and learned how to make the most of the space within the limit of her tether.  It is not those who 'cry for the Moon' who go furthest or get most in this limited world of ours.  Stephen's pretty ways and unfailing good temper were a perpetual joy to her father; and when he found that as a rule her desires were reasonable, his wish to yield to them became a habit.  Miss Rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove of.  She it was who selected the governesses and who interviewed them from time to time as to the child's progress.  Not often was there any complaint, for the little thing had such a pretty way of showing affection, and such a manifest sense of justified trust in all whom she encountered, that it would have been hard to name a specific fault.  But though all went in tears of affectionate regret, and with eminently satisfactory emoluments and references, there came an irregularly timed succession of governesses.  Stephen's affection for her 'Auntie' was never affected by any of the changes.  Others might come and go, but there no change came.  The child's little hand would steal into one of the old lady's strong ones, or would clasp a finger and hold it tight.  And then the woman who had never had a child of her own would feel, afresh each time, as though the child's hand was gripping her heart.  With her father she was sweetest of all.  And as he seemed to be pleased when she did anything like a little boy, the habit of being like one insensibly grew on her.  An only child has certain educational difficulties.  The true learning is not that which we are taught, but that which we take in for ourselves from experience and observation, and children's experiences and observation, especially of things other than repressive, are mainly of children.  The little ones teach each other.  Brothers and sisters are more with each other than are ordinary playmates, and in the familiarity of their constant intercourse some of the great lessons, so useful in after-life, are learned.  Little Stephen had no means of learning the wisdom of give-and-take.  To her everything was given, given bountifully and gracefully.  Graceful acceptance of good things came to her naturally, as it does to one who is born to be a great lady.  The children of the farmers in the neighbourhood, with whom at times she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],["title","The Man (#3)"],["body","ayed, were in such habitual awe of the great house, that they were seldom sufficiently at ease to play naturally.  Children cannot be on equal terms on special occasions with a person to whom they have been taught to bow or courtesy as a public habit.  The children of neighbouring landowners, who were few and far between, and of the professional people in Norcester, were at such times as Stephen met them, generally so much on their good behaviour, that the spontaneity of play, through which it is that sharp corners of individuality are knocked off or worn down, did not exist.  And so Stephen learned to read in the Book of Life; though only on one side of it.  At the age of six she had, though surrounded with loving care and instructed by skilled teachers, learned only the accepting side of life.  Giving of course there was in plenty, for the traditions of Normanstand were royally benevolent; many a blessing followed the little maid's footsteps as she accompanied some timely aid to the sick and needy sent from the Squire's house.  Moreover, her Aunt tried to inculcate certain maxims founded on that noble one that it is more blessed to give than to receive.  But of giving in its true sense: the giving that which we want for ourselves, the giving that is as a temple built on the rock of self-sacrifice, she knew nothing.  Her sweet and spontaneous nature, which gave its love and sympathy so readily, was almost a bar to education: it blinded the eyes that would have otherwise seen any defect that wanted altering, any evil trait that needed repression, any lagging virtue that required encouragement--or the spur.     CHAPTER III--HAROLD   Squire Norman had a clerical friend whose rectory of Carstone lay some thirty miles from Normanstand.  Thirty miles is not a great distance for railway travel; but it is a long drive.  The days had not come, nor were they ever likely to come, for the making of a railway between the two places.  For a good many years the two men had met in renewal of their old University days.  Squire Norman and Dr. An Wolf had been chums at Trinity, Cambridge, and the boyish friendship had ripened and lasted. When Harold An Wolf had put in his novitiate in a teeming Midland manufacturing town, it was Norman's influence which obtained the rectorship for his friend.  It was not often that they could meet, for An Wolf's work, which, though not very exacting, had to be done single-handed, kept him to his post.  Besides, he was a good scholar and eked out a small income by preparing a few pupils for public school.  An occasional mid-week visit to Normanstand in the slack time of school work on the Doctor's part, and now and again a drive by Norman over to the rectory, returning the next day, had been for a good many years the measure of their meeting.  Then An Wolf's marriage and the birth of a son had kept him closer to home.  Mrs. An Wolf had been killed in a railway accident a couple of years after her only child had been born; and at the time Norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power to the afflicted man, and to give him what was under the circumstances his best gift, sympathy.  After an interval of a few years the Squire's courtship and marriage, at which his old friend had assisted, had confined his activities to a narrower circle.  The last time they had met was when An Wolf had come over to Norcester to aid in the burial of his friend's wife.  In the process of years, however, the shadow over Norman's life had begun to soften; when his baby had grown to be something of a companion, they met again.  Norman, 'who had never since his wife's death been able to tear himself, even for a night, away from Normanstand and Stephen, wrote to his old friend asking him to come to him.  An Wolf gladly promised, and for a week of growing expectation the Squire looked forward to their meeting.  Each found the other somewhat changed, in all but their old affection.  An Wolf was delighted with the little Stephen.  Her dainty beauty seemed to charm him; and the child, seeming to realise what pleasure she was giving, exercised all her little winning ways.  The rector, who knew more of children than did his, friend, told her as she sat on his knee of a very interesting person: his own son.  The child listened, interested at first, then enraptured.  She asked all kinds of questions; and the father's eyes brightened as he gladly answered the pretty sympathetic child, already deep in his heart for her father's sake.  He told her about the boy who was so big and strong, and who could run and leap and swim and play cricket and football better than any other boy with whom he played.  When, warmed himself by the keen interest of the little girl, and seeing her beautiful black eyes beginning to glow, he too woke to the glory of the time; and all the treasured moments of the father's lonely heart gave out their store.  And the other father, thrilled with delight because of his baby's joy with, underlying all, an added pleasure that the little Stephen's interest was in sports that were for boys, looked on approvingly, now and again asking questions himself in furtherance of the child's wishes.  All the afternoon they sat in the garden, close to the stream that came out of the rock, and An Wolf told father's tales of his only son.  Of the great cricket match with Castra Puerorum when he had made a hundred not out.  Of the school races when he had won so many prizes.  Of the swimming match in the Islam River when, after he had won the race and had dressed himself, he went into the water in his clothes to help some children who had upset a boat.  How when Widow Norton's only son could not be found, he dived into the deep hole of the intake of the milldam of the great Carstone mills where Wingate the farrier had been drowned.  And how, after diving twice without success, he had insisted on going down the third time though people had tried to hold him back; and how he had brought up in his arms the child all white and so near death that they had to put him in the ashes of the baker's oven before he could be brought back to life.  When her nurse came to take her to bed, she slid down from her father's knee and coming over to Dr. An Wolf, gravely held out her hand and said: 'Good-bye!'  Then she kissed him and said:  'Thank you so much, Mr. Harold's daddy.  Won't you come soon again, and tell us more?'  Then she jumped again upon her father's knee and hugged him round the neck and kissed him, and whispered in his ear:  'Daddy, please make Mr. Harold's daddy when he comes again, bring Harold with him!'  After all it is natural for women to put the essence of the letter in the postscript!  Two weeks afterwards Dr. An Wolf came again and brought Harold with him. The time had gone heavily with little Stephen when she knew that Harold was coming with his father.  Stephen had been all afire to see the big boy whose feats had so much interested her, and for a whole week had flooded Mrs. Jarrold with questions which she was unable to answer.  At last the time came and she went out to the hall door with her father to welcome the guests.  At the top of the great granite steps, down which in time of bad weather the white awning ran, she stood holding her father's hand and waving a welcome.  'Good morning, Harold!  Good morning, Mr. Harold's daddy!'  The meeting was a great pleasure to both the children, and resulted in an immediate friendship.  The small girl at once conceived a great admiration for the big, strong boy nearly twice her age and more than twice her size.  At her time of life the convenances are not, and love is a thing to be spoken out at once and in the open.  Mrs. Jarrold, from the moment she set eyes on him, liked the big kindly-faced boy who treated her like a lady, and who stood awkwardly blushing and silent in the middle of the nursery listening to the tiny child's proffers of affection.  For whatever kind of love it is that boys are capable of, Harold had fallen into it.  'Calf-love' is a thing habitually treated with contempt.  It may be ridiculous; but all the same it is a serious reality--to the calf.  Harold's new-found affection was as deep as his nature.  An only child who had in his memory nothing of a mother's love, his naturally affectionate nature had in his childish days found no means of expression.  A man child can hardly pour out his full heart to a man, even a father or a comrade; and this child had not, in a way, the consolations of other children.  His father's secondary occupation of teaching brought other boys to the house and necessitated a domestic routine which had to be exact.  There was no place for little girls in a boys' school; and though many of Dr. An Wolf's friends who were mothers made much of the pretty, quiet boy, and took him to play with their children, he never seemed to get really intimate with them.  The equality of companionship was wanting.  Boys he knew, and with them he could hold his own and yet be on affectionate terms.  But girls were strange to him, and in their presence he was shy.  With this lack of understanding of the other sex, grew up a sort of awe of it.  His opportunities of this kind of study were so few that the view never could become rectified.  And so it was that from his boyhood up to his twelfth year, Harold's knowledge of girlhood never increased nor did his awe diminish.  When his father had told him all about his visit to Normanstand and of the invitation which had been extended to him there came first awe, then doubt, then expectation.  Between Harold and his father there was love and trust and sympathy.   The father's married love so soon cut short found expression towards his child; and between them there had never been even the shadow of a cloud.  When his father told him how pretty the little Stephen was, how dainty, how sweet, he began to picture her in his mind's eye and to be bashfully excited over meeting her.  His first glimpse of"]]]
