They have both got their wives and families to look after. Eustace will be an efficient man of the house and companion to his mummie--won't you, son?\"  \"I'll do my best,\" Eustace said soberly.  To be quite honest, he was as startled as his mother at his father's announcement; he did not like the idea at all. He had caught that curious look in his mother's eyes, and it troubled him.  But Nesta was too much taken up with the thought of the parcel to notice anything except the delay in opening it.  \"Couldn't we go on?\" she pleaded.  \"Poor Nesta,\" said Mr. Orban, beginning to cut the sewing, \"is it getting beyond your patience altogether? Well, here goes then!\"  Inside the American cloth was yet another wrapper, this time of linen sewn up most carefully, and within that paper after paper. The excitement grew more and more tense, till at last, when they came to a series of neat packages, each with a label to say from whom and to whom the gift was, every one except Becky was beyond speaking point.  The joys that parcel contained were indescribable, because no child born and bred in England could be made to understand how wonderful, how undreamed of, how surprising were the most ordinary things to those four Bush children. They lived right out of the world, and had spent most of their lives on a sugar plantation in North Queensland; the common things of our everyday existence were marvels to them.  A clockwork train sent out to Peter with a hope that \"he was not too old for it\" fascinated Eustace, despite his four years' seniority; the exquisite little doll's dinner service for Becky set Nesta longing to play with it and cook pretence dinners for it.  There was something for every one, and the children's eyes shone with pleasure; but Mrs. Orban's were dim as, the unpacking over, she turned quietly away and disappeared into the house.  In the midst of turning the pages of his new book to look for pictures, Eustace missed her, and shortly after Mr. Orban went away too.  \"Oh!\" Eustace exclaimed, slamming his book together with a big sigh, \"I do wish parcels from England didn't always make mother sad.\"  \"I guess she wants to see grannie and Aunt Dorothy badly,\" Nesta suggested.  \"Oh, it is more than that,\" Eustace said, getting up and moving restlessly about. \"I sometimes think she simply hates this place and everything to do with it.\"  \"Do you, Eustace?\" asked Peter, his eyes round with wonder.  \"Well, it is fearfully dull, isn't it?\" Nesta said. \"England must be quite different. English stories always make me ache to go there. It must be so awfully interesting, mustn't it?\"  \"Wouldn't it be splendid if father said suddenly one day we could all go to England!\" Peter cried excitedly.  \"I don't think there is the least chance of that,\" Eustace said. \"You heard what he said about its being too expensive to take us even to Brisbane. It would cost ten times as much to go to England.\"  \"I say,\" Nesta said quickly, \"I wonder why father has to go to Brisbane in such a hurry? Don't you, Eustace?\"  \"I haven't thought about it,\" Eustace answered. \"But, anyhow, mother doesn't like his going--that's very clear.\"  \"Doesn't she?\" Nesta asked in a surprised voice. \"How _do_ you know?\"  \"Didn't you see her face when father said he must go?\" Eustace asked with a touch of impatience.  Nesta shook her head.  \"Oh!\" was all Eustace exclaimed; then he turned, and resting his elbows on the railings, stared straight ahead with unseeing eyes.  The Orbans' house was built on the top of an isolated hill three hundred feet above a valley which, except where the scrub had been cleared for the growing of sugar-cane, was thickly wooded. On three sides of the valley, stretching round like a great horse-shoe, lay range upon range of hills, now softest purple. The fourth side, on which the boy gazed, was bounded by the sea--a shimmering patch of blue. No scene could have been grander, none more infinitely lonely. But Eustace was not thinking about it either admiringly or otherwise.  Nesta joined her brother, and stared curiously at his unusually serious face.  \"What do you mean, Eustace?\" she demanded.  He did not speak, so she put her hand on his shoulder and gave him a little shake.  \"What are you thinking about?\" she asked.  \"Mother,\" Eustace said quite shortly.  \"Yes, I know,\" Nesta said; \"but what about her?\"  \"Father's going away,\" Eustace said.  \"Of course,\" Nesta said, rather scornfully; \"you told me that before. And I know mother will be dreadfully dull without him.\"  \"Dull!\" exclaimed Eustace, knocking the tips of his toes impatiently against the woodwork.  \"Yes, dull,\" said the girl.  \"Worse than dull,\" Eustace responded soberly.  \"But we can do our best to cheer her up till he comes back.\"  Eustace turned slowly round until he was staring right into Nesta's eyes, and his look was so queer that she was startled.  \"Do you mean to say you don't understand?\" he said solemnly.  \"No, I certainly don't,\" Nesta replied.  Eustace wheeled quickly back to the railing, gazing seaward again.  \"Then I'm not going to tell you,\" he said decidedly.  Nesta stood blankly wondering for a moment.  \"Well, it's hateful of you,\" she began; then suddenly her expression changed. \"Eustace,\" she exclaimed, grabbing his arm with both hands, \"do you mean mother will be frightened?\"  \"I'm not going to tell you,\" repeated the boy with seeming obstinacy.  But Nesta's face was full of certainty.  \"It _is_ that!\" she said with conviction. \"You think she will be scared at being left.\"  Now Eustace had suddenly begun to repent of having said so much. He had not the least desire to frighten Nesta; he had honestly believed that she must have noticed what he did in their mother's tone and look, but now he realized Nesta had not understood. He stood silent, regretting his carelessness.  \"O Eustace,\" Nesta cried, \"of course it is that. How dreadful! I remember now what father said--he knew mother might be frightened, and that is why he offered to have Farley or Robertson up.\"  There was terror in Nesta's voice now, and Eustace rounded sharply upon her.  \"I say, shut up!\" he said, with a glance towards Peter, who was too engrossed with his train at the other side of the veranda to be listening. \"You don't want to frighten the kids, do you? Besides, father said we should be all right, and he knows.\"  \"But mother was frightened,\" Nesta said, looking unconvinced.  \"She didn't say so,\" Eustace argued. \"She refused to have either of the men up, you see. That doesn't look much like funking it.\"  \"Then what did you mean?\" demanded Nesta.  \"Oh, never mind,\" Eustace said, throwing himself into a chair and reopening his book. \"Don't let's talk about it.\"  \"That is nonsense,\" Nesta said. \"How can I help minding about a thing like that?\"  \"Well, but what's the good of talking?\" Eustace exclaimed. \"Dad has to go; we can't prevent that if we talk for ever.\"  \"Yes; but if it is dangerous--\" Nesta began in a low, awe-struck voice.  \"Dangerous!\" Eustace repeated. \"What could there be dangerous about it?\"  \"You know as well as I do,\" Nesta replied. \"Supposing the blacks were to come down on us in the night when we were here all alone!\"  \"Oh, do shut up!\" Eustace said sharply. \"Why should the blacks happen to come just because father is away? They may not even be in the neighbourhood.\"  \"Yes; but you remember that horrid story Kate told us,\" Nesta said, almost whispering. \"The father was away--there were nothing but women and children in the house--\"  \"Oh, stop, Nesta!\" Eustace said. \"Of course I remember all about it. I don't want to hear the beastly thing all over again. What is the good of frightening ourselves all for nothing? Don't you know that father wouldn't go if he could possibly help it? And if he must go, we've got to make the best of it, that's all. Now I'm going to read, so do shut up.\"  Nesta stood silently staring at him a moment, but he seemed already to have forgotten her very existence.  \"Well, you are a queer boy,\" she said, in what the boys always called her \"huffy\" voice.  Still Eustace took no notice.  \"Perhaps you will be sorry some day,\" Nesta said with a little gulp, and turned away to Becky, who was calling her.  Eustace was apparently engrossed in his book, but not a word did he see on the page he stared at so intently. He had done a stupid thing, and he regretted it, for the mischief was past remedy now. Quite unintentionally he had made Nesta as nervous as he was himself, and he knew that nothing he might say would reassure her. He was quite right that there was no use in talking about it; he felt sure that his father would say he ought not to have said so much, and he was vexed with himself for his carelessness. Silence seemed the only course open to him--silence on the subject for the present, and for the future a great, whole-hearted resolve to play the man come what might.     CHAPTER II.  BOB.   Eustace was right: their father would not have gone to Brisbane had it not been necessary; but this was not because Mr. Orban was troubled by any fears for the safety of his family. He had lived so long in North Queensland that he was used to the solitude, and thought nothing of the dangers surrounding them. It distressed him to have to go away simply because he knew that his wife would be terribly nervous without him. Fifteen years in the colony had not accustomed her to the loneliness of their position.  Besides the two engineers, and the field manager, Mr. Ashton, who all lived at the foot of the hill, the Orbans had no white neighbours nearer than five miles off. The field hands were coloured men of some five or six different races, chiefly Chinese or Malays--the good-for-nothing riff-raff of their own countries come to seek a living elsewhere.  There was no society, no constant dropping in of friends, nothing to relieve the monotony of daily life. But none of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25079"],["title","Queensland Cousins (#2)"],["body","did Mrs. Orban mind; she was always busy and content by day. It was only of the night-time she was afraid, when strange-voiced creatures were never silent an hour, weird cries from the scrub pierced the air, and there arose from the plantation below wild sounds, sometimes of revelry over a feast, the beating of tom-toms, and wailing of voices as the natives conducted their heathen worship, or indulged in noisy quarrels likely to end in bloodshed between antagonistic tribes.  But though for some reasons the coolies were not pleasant neighbours, the house on the hill had nothing to fear from them. Their worst feature was their utter uselessness in any real danger, coming from quite another quarter. Though they might serve him solely for their own benefit, and were for the most part thieves and rogues, the coolies had no desire to harm the white man personally.  But wandering stealthily through the woods, homeless and lawless, is a race that hates the white man--the aborigines of Australia. Civilization has driven them farther and farther north, for the Australian black-fellows cannot be tamed and trained--their nature is too wild and fierce to be kept within bounds except by fear and crushing. They are treacherous and savage, and most repulsive in appearance. Though spoken of as black, they are really chocolate-brown, but so covered with hair as to be very dusky.  Being very cunning in their movements, it is always difficult to know where they are, and there are often such long lapses between the times they are heard of, that most people forget their existence as a matter of any importance. But Mr. Orban knew that his wife was haunted by a very constant horror of them--a dread lest one night the blacks should make a raid upon their plantation, as they had been known to do upon other white men's dwellings.  What neither Mr. nor Mrs. Orban realized was how much Eustace and Nesta knew of certain terrible events happening from time to time in just such isolated homes as their own. It was from the two young white maidservants the children heard tales they listened to with a kind of awful enjoyment by day, but which were remembered at night with a shudder. The creaking of the wooden house in which they lived as the boards contracted after the tropical heat of day, and the weird sounds rising from the plantation below, held a hundred terrors to be ashamed of in the morning.  Eustace and Nesta never spoke of these night panics to any one, least of all to each other--they seemed so silly when broad daylight proved there had been absolutely nothing to be cowardly about.  By some unspoken rule Peter was never allowed to hear these stories. He was always considered so very much younger than Eustace and Nesta that even the servants had the sense not to frighten him. So Peter's spirits were not damped by the thought of their father's departure, and he knew nothing of the queer little tiff that had taken place between Eustace and Nesta.  It is very odd how people can quarrel over a matter upon which they are perfectly agreed; but they frequently do, especially when it has anything to do with fear.  Nesta went to bed that night still in the sulks, with an air of \"You'll be sorry some day\" about her every attitude. Eustace seemed inseparable from his book, and disinclined to talk. He went heavily to bed, more troubled than ever because, though his mother was unusually merry, making much of all the presents from England, and showing great interest in them, he saw she was very white, and there was still a strange look about her eyes. He suspected her gaiety to be only put on for their amusement, and he felt sorrier and sorrier for her.  But a good night's rest did wonders for both children, and they came in to breakfast in better humours. Nesta forgot to be tragic when she heard her father and mother discussing what material should be brought from Brisbane for the girls' new dresses. New clothes were a rare event for the Orban children, and always caused a good deal of excitement.  Eustace had been up early, and everything looked so calm, peaceful, and ordinary about the place that he was inclined to be more than half ashamed of his outburst the day before. \"After all,\" he argued, \"nothing ever has happened to us--why should it now? The black-fellows have never come this way. Why should they, just because father is away? How could they get to know of his going? Besides, the plantation isn't so awfully far off.\"  He had stood on the veranda and stared down at the sugar mill lying at the foot of the hill, where Robertson and Farley lived; at Mr. Ashton's house, and all the familiar, odd-shaped huts in which the coolies lived. It was all just as he had seen it every day of his life, and nothing had ever happened--why, indeed, should it now?  Mrs. Orban's interest in the new dresses was certainly not feigned.  \"Now, Jack,\" she was saying as Eustace entered the room, \"don't--don't go and ask for dusters. It is that pretty pink and blue check zephyr I want--pink for Becky, and blue for Nesta.\"  \"Well, dear, you must confess it is just like duster stuff--now, isn't it?\" demanded Mr. Orban with a laugh.  \"O daddy, not a bit!\" Nesta exclaimed. \"What a horrid thought!\"  \"Some of mother's dusters are very pretty, young woman,\" said her father. \"I wouldn't mind having shirts made of them myself.\"  \"I should object very much,\" Mrs. Orban said with a laugh; \"you would look like a coolie. But let us talk sense again.\"  Talking sense meant talking business, which on this occasion was the making out of a list of really rather dull things wanted in the house.  Daily life begins early on a sugar plantation. It was now only half-past six, and the house had been astir since half-past four; the children playing, Mrs. Orban working about the house, and Mr. Orban away down on the plantation. The comparative cool of the morning was the best time for any sort of activity. Later, as the fierce December sun rose higher, even the children became listless and disinclined to race about.  After breakfast, when Mr. Orban went back to work, Mrs. Orban gave the children lessons--the only teaching they had ever had. At eleven Mr. Orban returned for early dinner.  To our English ideas the routine seems strange; but the Orban children were used to it, and had no realization of how different was life in their parents' old home. It did not seem at all funny even to the twins to have tea at five, and go to bed at half-past six or seven. They were generally very ready for sleep by then, after their long, exhausting day.  \"I say, father,\" Eustace said suddenly, after a long meditation while business was being discussed, \"I can stay up to dinner with mother when you are away--can't I? It will be awfully dull for her if I don't.\"  \"And me too,\" said Nesta, who never allowed it to be forgotten that, being the same age as Eustace, she claimed the same privileges.  \"Rot,\" said Eustace; \"you're only a girl.\"  \"And me too,\" chimed in Peter.  \"Oh, you silly baby,\" said Eustace impatiently, \"what good would you do?\"  Peter's delicate face became scarlet.  \"I could play games with mother quite as well as you,\" he said with an angry frown.  \"Mother doesn't want amusing like that to keep her from being dull,\" Eustace declared. \"She wants somebody who can talk sensibly like father, and be grown up.\"  Nesta gave a little derisive laugh.  \"Like father!\" she repeated; \"that is funny. I suppose you think you could be just like him. Why don't you ask him to let you smoke one of his pipes at once?\"  \"Don't be silly, Nesta,\" Eustace retorted.  \"It's you who are silly,\" Nesta said, \"thinking only boys can be grown up or of any use.\"  \"When you have quite done snapping each other's heads off,\" interposed their father in his deep, quiet voice, \"perhaps you will allow me to speak. As a matter of fact, the mother thinks of going to bed with the cocks and hens herself.\"  \"To bed with the cocks and hens!\" repeated Peter, with an expression of blank surprise in his blue eyes.  Now the cocks and hens many of them roosted under the house, which was built on pillars, and set some distance above the ground. It was not an attractive spot at any time, for here there also lived many strange creatures, snakes amongst them.  \"Well, not exactly in the henhouse, Peter,\" said his father, with a twinkle in his eyes. \"I dare say she will sleep as usual in her own bedroom. I was referring more to the hour at which she says she means to go to bed--not very long after you.\"  \"Still you will have dinner--won't you, mummie?\" Eustace said.  \"Certainly,\" Mrs. Orban answered with a smile; \"and I don't think it would be a bad plan for you and Nesta to stay up for it, if you will promise not to get up quite so early in the morning. We will have dinner directly after Peter and Becky are in bed; but we won't sit up late ourselves, any of us.\"  Mrs. Orban certainly showed no signs of nervousness to-day; the strained expression had left her eyes; she was laughing and talking quite naturally.  \"I suppose,\" thought Eustace, \"she was partly upset by the parcel from England.\"  \"Father,\" Nesta exclaimed, \"I'm certain I hear a horse coming up the hill. Who can it be at this time of day?\"  \"Don't know, I'm sure,\" said her father; \"it might be one of a dozen people. You had better go and sing out 'friend or foe' over the veranda; but I dare say it isn't a horse at all. More probably it is old Hadji with the mail bag that ought to have come with the parcel yesterday.\"  But the three elder children had disappeared out on to the veranda and were leaning over, straining their eyes down the road that wound up the hill from the plain.  It was a very rough road, with ruts in it sometimes two or three feet deep. During the rains little better than a bog, it was now burnt hard as flint.  There was nothing to be seen though a mile of road was visible, lost now and then among bends; but the children listened breathlessly, and at last Eustace "]]]
