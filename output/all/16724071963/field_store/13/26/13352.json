I smiled at Pop and said, \"Any other reasons?\"  \"Yep,\" he said. \"Got to shave and I might as well do it in style. A new blade every day in the fortnight is twice as good as the old ads. You know, it makes you keep a knife in fine shape if you shave with it. What you got there, Ray?\"  \"You were wrong, Pop,\" I said. \"He did have some metal on him that didn't melt.\"  I held up for them to see the object I'd extracted from his left fist: a bright steel cube measuring about an inch across each side, but it felt lighter than if it were solid metal. Five of the faces looked absolutely bare. The sixth had a round button recessed in it.  From the way they looked at it neither Pop nor the girl had the faintest idea of what it was. I certainly hadn't.  \"Had he pushed the button?\" the girl asked. Her voice was throaty but unexpectedly refined, as if she'd done no talking at all, not even to herself, since coming to the Deathlands and so retained the cultured intonations she'd had earlier, whenever and wherever that had been. It gave me a funny feeling, of course, because they were the first words I'd heard her speak.  \"Not from the way he was holding it,\" I told her. \"The button was pointed up toward his thumb but the thumb was on the outside of his fingers.\" I felt an unexpected satisfaction at having expressed myself so clearly and I told myself not to get childish.  The girl slitted her eyes. \"Don't you push it, Ray,\" she said.  \"Think I'm nuts?\" I told her, meanwhile sliding the cube into the smaller pocket of my pants, where it fit tight and wouldn't turn sideways and the button maybe get pressed by accident. The tingling in my right arm was almost unbearable now, but I was getting control over the muscles again.  \"Pushing that button,\" I added, \"might melt what's left of the plane, or blow us all up.\" It never hurts to emphasize that you may have another weapon in your possession, even if it's just a suicide bomb.  \"There was a man pushed another button once,\" Pop said softly and reflectively. His gaze went far out over the Deathlands and took in a good half of the horizon and he slowly shook his head. Then his face brightened. \"Did you know, Ray,\" he said, \"that I actually met that man? Long afterwards. You don't believe me, I know, but I actually did. Tell you about it some other time.\"  I almost said, \"Thanks, Pop, for sparing me at least for a while,\" but I was afraid that would set him off again. Besides, it wouldn't have been quite true. I've heard other buggers tell the yarn of how they met (and invariably rubbed out) the actual guy who pushed the button or buttons that set the fusion missiles blasting toward their targets, but I felt a sudden curiosity as to what Pop's version of the yarn would be. Oh well, I could ask him some other time, if we both lived that long. I started to check the Pilot's pockets. My right hand could help a little now.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Those look like mean burns you got there, lady,\" I heard Pop tell the girl. He was right. There were blisters easy to see on three of the fingertips. \"I've got some salve that's pretty good,\" he went on, \"and some clean cloth. I could put on a bandage for you if you wanted. If your hand started to feel poisoned you could always tell Ray here to slip a knife in me.\"  Pop was a cute gasser, you had to admit. I reminded myself that it was Pop's business to play up to the both of us, charm being the secret weapon of all scroungers.  The girl gave a harsh little laugh. \"Very well,\" she said, \"but we will use my salve, I know it works for me.\" And she started to lead Pop to where we'd hidden our things.  \"I'll go with you,\" I told them, standing up.  It didn't look like we were going to have any more murders today--Pop had got through the preliminary ingratiations pretty well and the girl and me had had our catharsis--but that would be no excuse for any such stupidity as letting the two of them get near my .38.  Strolling to the cave and back I eased the situation a bit more by saying, \"That scream you let off, Pop, really helped. I don't know what gave you the idea, but thanks.\"  \"Oh that,\" he said. \"Forget about it.\"  \"I won't,\" I told him. \"You may say you've quit killing, but helped on a do-in today.\"  \"Ray,\" he said a little solemnly, \"if it'll make you feel any happier, I'll take a bit of the responsibility for every murder that's been done since the beginning of time.\"  I looked at him for a while. Then, \"Pop, you're not by any chance the religious type?\" I asked suddenly.  \"Lord, no,\" he told us.  That struck me as a satisfactory answer. God preserve me from the religious type! We have quite a few of those in the Deathlands. It generally means that they try to convert you to something before they kill you. Or sometimes afterwards.  We completed our errands. I felt a lot more secure with Old Financier's Friend strapped to my middle. Mother is wonderful but she is not enough.  I dawdled over inspecting the Pilot's pockets, partly to give my right hand time to come back all the way. And to tell the truth I didn't much enjoy the job--a corpse, especially such a handsome cadaver as this, just didn't go with Pop's brand of light patter.         *       *       *       *       *  Pop did up the girl's hand in high style, bandaging each finger separately and then persuading her to put on a big left-hand work glove he took out of his small pack.  \"Lost the right,\" he explained, \"which was the only one I ever used anyway. Never knew until now why I kept this. How does it feel, Alice?\"  I might have known he'd worm her name out of her. It occurred to me that Pop's ideas of scrounging might extend to Alice's favors. The urge doesn't die out when you get old, they tell me. Not completely.  He'd also helped her replace the knife on her stump with the hook.  By that time I'd poked into all the Pilot's pockets I could get at without stripping him and found nothing but three irregularly shaped blobs of metal, still hot to the touch. Under the charred spots, of course.  I didn't want the job of stripping him. Somebody else could do a little work, I told myself. I've been bothered by bodies before (as who hasn't, I suppose?) but this one was really beginning to make me sick. Maybe I was cracking up, it occurred to me. Murder is a very wearing business, as all Deathlanders know, and although some crack earlier than others, all crack in the end.  I must have been showing how I was feeling because, \"Cheer up, Ray,\" Pop said. \"You and Alice have done a big murder--I'd say the subject was six foot ten--so you ought to be happy. You've drawn a blank on his pockets but there's still the plane.\"  \"Yeah, that's right,\" I said, brightening a little. \"There's still the stuff in the plane.\" I knew there were some items I couldn't hope for, like .38 shells, but there'd be food and other things.  \"Nuh-uh,\" Pop corrected me. \"I said _the plane_. You may have thought it's wrecked, but I don't. Have you taken a real gander at it? It's worth doing, believe me.\"  I jumped up. My heart was suddenly pounding. I was glad of an excuse to get away from the body, but there was a lot more in my feelings than that. I was filled with an excitement to which I didn't want to give a name because it would make the let-down too great.  One of the wide stubby wings of the plane, raking downward so that its tip almost touched the concrete, had hidden the undercarriage of the fuselage from our view. Now, coming around the wing, I saw that _there was no undercarriage_.  I had to drop to my hands and knees and scan around with my cheek next to the concrete before I'd believe it. _The \"wrecked\" plane was at all points at least six inches off the ground._         *       *       *       *       *  I got to my feet again. I was shaking. I wanted to talk but I couldn't. I grabbed the leading edge of the wing to stop from falling. The whole body of the plane gave a fraction of an inch and then resisted my leaning weight with lazy power, just like a gyroscope.  \"Antigravity,\" I croaked, though you couldn't have heard me two feet. Then my voice came back. \"Pop, Alice! They got antigravity! Antigravity--and it's working!\"  Alice had just come around the wing and was facing me. She was shaking too and her face was white like I knew mine was. Pop was politely standing off a little to one side, watching us curiously. \"Told you you'd won a real prize,\" he said in his matter-of-fact way.  Alice wet her lips. \"Ray,\" she said, \"we can get away.\"  Just those four words, but they did it. Something in me unlocked--no, exploded describes it better.  \"We can go places!\" I almost shouted.  \"Beyond the dust,\" she said. \"Mexico City. South America!\" She was forgetting the Deathlander's cynical article of belief that the dust never ends, but then so was I. It makes a difference whether or not you've got a means of doing something.  \"Rio!\" I topped her with. \"The Indies. Hong Kong. Bombay. Egypt. Bermuda. The French Riviera!\"  \"Bullfights and clean beds,\" she burst out with. \"Restaurants. Swimming pools. Bathrooms!\"  \"Skindiving,\" I took it up with, as hysterical as she was. \"Road races and roulette tables.\"  \"Bentleys and Porsches!\"  \"Aircoups and DC4s and Comets!\"  \"Martinis and hashish and ice cream sodas!\"  \"Hot food! Fresh coffee! Gambling, smoking, dancing, music, drinks!\" I was going to add _women_, but then I thought of how hard-bitten little Alice would look beside the dream creatures I had in mind. I tactfully suppressed the word but I filed the idea away.  I don't think either of us knew exactly what we were saying. Alice in particular I don't believe was old enough to have experienced almost any of the things the words referred to. They were mysterious symbols of long-interdicted delights spewing out of us.  \"Ray,\" Alice said, hurrying to me, \"let's get aboard.\"  \"Yes,\" I said eagerly and then I saw a little problem. The door to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25024"],["title","The Night of the Long Knives (#7)"],["body","was a couple of feet above our heads. Whoever hoisted himself up first--or got hoisted up, as would have to be the case with Alice on account of her hand--would be momentarily at the other's mercy. I guess it occurred to Alice too because she stopped and looked at me. It was a little like the old teaser about the fox, the goose, and the corn.  Maybe, too, we were both a little scared the plane was booby-trapped.         *       *       *       *       *  Pop solved the problem in the direct way I might have expected of him by stepping quietly between us, giving a light leap, catching hold of the curving sill, chinning himself on it, and scrambling up into the plane so quickly that we'd hardly have had time to do anything about it if we'd wanted to. Pop couldn't be much more than a bantamweight, even with all his knives. The plane sagged an inch and then swung up again.  As Pop disappeared from view I backed off, reaching for my .38, but a moment later he stuck out his head and grinned down at us, resting his elbows on the sill.  \"Come on up,\" he said. \"It's quite a place. I promise not to push any buttons 'til you get here, though there's whole regiments of them.\"  I grinned back at Pop and gave Alice a boost up. She didn't like it, but she could see it had to be her next. She hooked onto the sill and Pop caught hold of her left wrist below the big glove and heaved.  Then it was my turn. I didn't like it. I didn't like the idea of those two buggers poised above me while my hands were helpless on the sill. But I thought _Pop's a nut. You can trust a nut, at least a little ways, though you can't trust nobody else._ I heaved myself up. It was strange to feel the plane giving and then bracing itself like something alive. It seemed to have no trouble accepting our combined weight, which after all was hardly more than half again the Pilot's.         *       *       *       *       *  Inside the cabin was pretty small but as Pop had implied, oh my! Everything looked soft and smoothly curved, like you imagine your insides being, and almost everything was a restfully dull silver. The general shape of it was something like the inside of an egg. Forward, which was the larger end, were a couple of screens and a wide viewport and some small dials and the button brigades Pop had mentioned, lined up like blank typewriter keys but enough for writing Chinese.  Just aft of the instrument panel were two very comfortable-looking strange low seats. They seemed to be facing backwards until I realized they were meant to be knelt into. The occupant, I could see, would sort of sprawl forward, his hands free for button-pushing and such. There were spongy chinrests.  Aft was a tiny instrument panel and a kind of sideways seat, not nearly so fancy. The door by which we'd entered was to the side, a little aft.  I didn't see any indications of cabinets or fixed storage spaces of any kinds, but somehow stuck to the walls here and there were quite a few smooth blobby packages, mostly dull silver too, some large, some small--valises and handbags, you might say.  All in all, it was a lovely cabin and, more than that, it seemed lived in. It looked as if it had been shaped for, and maybe by one man. It had a personality you could feel, a strong but warm personality of its own.  Then I realized whose personality it was. I almost got sick--so close to it I started telling myself it must be something antigravity did to your stomach.  But it was all too interesting to let you get sick right away. Pop was poking into two of the large mound-shaped cases that were sitting loose and open on the right-hand seat, as if ready for emergency use. One had a folded something with straps on it that was probably a parachute. The second had I judged a thousand or more of the inch cubes such as I'd pried out of the Pilot's hand, all neatly stacked in a cubical box inside the soft outer bag. You could see the one-cube gap where he'd taken the one.  I decided to take the rest of the bags off the walls and open them, if I could figure out how. The others had the same idea, but Alice had to take off her hook and put on her pliers, before she could make progress. Pop helped her. There was room enough for us to do these things without crowding each other too closely.  By the time Alice was set to go I'd discovered the trick of getting the bags off. You couldn't pull them away from the wall no matter what force you used, at least I couldn't, and you couldn't even slide them straight along the walls, but if you just gave them a gentle counterclockwise twist they came off like nothing. Twisting them clockwise glued them back on. It was very strange, but I told myself that if these boys could generate antigravity fields they could create screwy fields of other sorts.  It also occurred to me to wonder if \"these boys\" came from Earth. The Pilot had looked human enough, but these accomplishments didn't--not by my standards for human achievement in the Age of the Deaders. At any rate I had to admit to myself that my pet term \"cultural queer\" did not describe to my own satisfaction members of a culture which could create things like this cabin. Not that I liked making the admission. It's hard to admit an exception to a pet gripe against things.  The excitement of getting down and opening the Christmas packages saved me from speculating too much along these or any other lines.  I hit a minor jackpot right away. In the same bag were a compass, a catalytic pocket lighter, a knife with a saw-tooth back edge that made my affection for Mother waver, a dust mask, what looked like a compact water-filtration unit, and several other items adding up to a deluxe Deathlands Survival Kit.  There were some goggles in the kit I didn't savvy until I put them on and surveyed the landscape out the viewport. A nearby dust drift I knew to be hot glowed green as death in the slightly smoky lenses. Wow! Those specs had Geiger counters beat a mile and I privately bet myself they worked at night. I stuck them in my pocket quick.         *       *       *       *       *  We found bunches of tiny electronics parts--I think they were; spools of magnetic tape, but nothing to play it on; reels of very narrow film with frames much too small to see anything at all unmagnified; about three thousand cigarettes in unlabeled transparent packs of twenty--we lit up quick, using my new lighter; a picture book that didn't make much sense because the views might have been of tissue sections or starfields, we couldn't quite decide, and there were no captions to help; a thin book with ricepaper pages covered with Chinese characters--_that_ was a puzzler; a thick book with nothing but columns of figures, all zeros and ones and nothing else; some tiny chisels; and a mouth organ. Pop, who'd make a point of just helping in the hunt, appropriated that last item--I might have known he would, I told myself. Now we could expect \"Turkey in the Straw\" at odd moments.  Alice found a whole bag of what were women's things judging from the frilliness of the garments included. She set aside some squeeze-packs and little gadgets and elastic items right away, but she didn't take any of the clothes. I caught her measuring some kind of transparent chemise against herself when she thought we weren't looking; it was for a girl maybe six sizes bigger.         *       *       *       *       *  And we found food. Cans of food that was heated up inside by the time you got the top rolled off, though the outside could still be cool to the touch. Cans of boneless steak, boneless chops, cream soup, peas, carrots, and fried potatoes--they weren't labeled at all but you could generally guess the contents from the shape of the can. Eggs that heated when you touched them and were soft-boiled evenly and barely firm by the time you had the shell broke. And small plastic bottles of strong coffee that heated up hospitably too--in this case the tops did a five-second hesitation in the middle of your unscrewing them.  At that point as you can imagine we let the rest of the packages go and had ourselves a feast. The food ate even better than it smelled. It was real hard for me not to gorge.  Then as I was slurping down my second bottle of coffee I happened to look out the viewport and see the Pilot's body and the darkening puddle around it and the coffee began to taste, well, not bad, but sickening. I don't think it was guilty conscience. Deathlanders outgrow those if they ever have them to start with; loners don't keep consciences--it takes cultures to give you those and make them work. Artistic inappropriateness is the closest I can come to describing what bothered me. Whatever it was, it made me feel lousy for a minute.  About the same time Alice did an odd thing with the last of _her_ coffee. She slopped it on a rag and used it to wash her face. I guess she'd caught a reflection of herself with the blood smears. She didn't eat any more after that either. Pop kept on chomping away, a slow feeder and appreciative.  To be doing something I started to inspect the instrument panel and right away I was all excited again. The two screens were what got me. They showed shadowy maps, one of North America, the other of the World. The first one was a whole lot like the map I'd been imagining earlier--faint colors marked the small \"civilized\" areas including one in Eastern Canada and another in Upper Michigan that must be \"countries\" I didn't know about, and the Deathlands were real dark just as I'd always maintained they should be!  South of Lake Michigan was a brightly luminous green point that must be where we were, I decided. And for some reason the colored areas representing Los Alamos and Atlantic Highlands were glowing brighter than the others--they had an active luminosity. Los Alamos was blue, Atla-Hi violet. Los Alamos was shown having more territory than I expected. Savannah Fortress for that matter was a whole _lot_ bigger than I'd have made it,"]]]
