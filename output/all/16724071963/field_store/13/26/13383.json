Ind., 27 (1908), 544-547.]  [Footnote 2: Riley, in his report to the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists for the year 1913, showed that a large proportion of the phosphoric acid was ordinarily lost when the beer was directly ashed (J. Assoc. Off. Agr. Chemists, 1 (1915), 138-143). For this reason, in comparing the amount of phosphoric acid given in the literature on beers, it is very essential to know the method used for determining the phosphoric acid.]   The same fact observed by Race, namely, that foreign beers are of low protein content, is shown very clearly in the published literature on European beers in general. Kig[3] gives the following results of analyses made by himself and H. Weigmann of two all-malt beers, calculated to the basis of a wort containing 15 per cont of solids:  +-----------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+ |Beer and percentage of wort. |  Protein. |    Ash.   |Phosphoric | |                             |           |           |   acid.   | +-----------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+ |                             | Per cent. | Per cent. | Per cent. | |Pure malt beer:              |           |           |           | |   12 percent wort           |   0.548   |   0.259   |   0.098   | |   14 percent wort           |    .457   |    .214   |    .076   | +-----------------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+   From these results of Kig it will be seen that the protein content of these beers is considerably less than that of the beers examined by the writers. As the phosphoric acid and ash results, however, are practically the same as in American beers, it might be expected that the use of substitutes in place of the low-protein malt would not show so sharp a reduction of the protein as was found by the authors, although one would expect a reduction in phosphoric acid and ash similar to that found in American beers. This is confirmed by the results obtained by Race.  Robert Wahl[4] made parallel brewings of a high-protein barley and a low-protein barley, and from these obtained two beers which, when calculated to a uniform wort with 15 per cent of solids, showed a total protein in the beer made from the low-protein malt of 0.734 per cent, and in the beer made from the high-protein malt 1.041 per cent. This clearly indicates that where a beer is made from high-protein barley, as is the case with practically all of the beers made in this country,[5] the reduction in protein by the use of substitutes will be a valuable index to the true nature of the product. This, when taken in connection with the reduction of phosphoric acid brought about by the use of substitutes, gives two factors of value in judging American beers, to determine whether or not substitutes have been used; while in the case of beers made from low-protein barley there is practically only one factor, namely, the reduction of phosphoric acid.

Brewers' Rev., 18 (1904), 339.]  [Footnote 5: Wahl, Robert. _In_ Am. Brewers' Rev., 29 (1915), 316-317.]   After this rather extensive study had been made at the three breweries, the investigation was extended to include breweries in various sections of the country where different types of raw materials were used. A special effort was made to obtain authentic samples of practically all of the malt beers made in this country and also a large series of malt-and-rice and malt-and-corn beers. In Table IX have been tabulated the results obtained on all-malt beers. All of these results show practically the same condition noted in the other samples of malt beer; that is, a comparatively high protein and phosphoric acid content as compared with beers made in part from rice or corn. These malt beers show figures considerably higher in protein than those given in the literature for all-malt beers made from the low-protein malt of Europe.

This representation subsequently proved to be false, although exact information as to the amount or kind of substitute used is not available. These results are of value, however, in showing the general composition of American beers made from the ordinary commercial mixtures and clearly indicate that by taking into consideration the ash, protein, and phosphoric acid content it is practicable to distinguish commercial beers made in this country from malt and malt substitutes from beers made from malt alone.
