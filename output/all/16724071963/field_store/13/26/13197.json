In the jungle the space should be all covered with grass and bushes, or at least with small shrubs of different sizes, just as you have seen in fields which are allowed to grow wild. So somebody must have _made_ the place level and flat, and cleared away the bushes! That is what the wise old elephant thought!  Then, also, he had seen that there was just _one_ banana tree, with no other anywhere near it. That also seemed strange! Why? Because banana trees always grow in groups of many dozens, whether they are in the jungle or in a plantation.  \"Halt!\" the old elephant cried, just in time. Salar was not more than five or six yards from the tree when he heard his father's voice. I have told you before that, when an elephant child is told to do anything by his Mamma or Papa, he obeys _at once_, or else he might fall into some awful danger--just as a child in a town might get run over by an auto or a street car.  So as soon as Salar heard his father's voice, he halted just where he was. And that saved him, as you will see.   _The Elephant Taps Suspicious Ground with his Trunk_  His father came up to him, and looked around carefully. Then he _tapped on the ground with the end of his trunk_.  \"An elephant must always tap with his trunk when he is coming to suspicious ground, before he puts his foot on it,\" he said to Salar.  \"What does suspicious ground mean?\" Salar asked.  \"Ground where there might be danger, though you do not _see_ the danger,\" his father answered.  He went on a couple of yards, tapping the ground before him all the time. Then he suddenly stopped.  \"Gr-r-r-rump!\" he cried, \"it sounds strange and hollow!\"  Most carefully he put his foot forward and _felt_ the ground with it, as an elephant always does when he thinks there is danger. Now the ground _bent down_ a little just where he pressed it with his foot!  \"I thought so!\" he muttered.  Then he felt most carefully all along the _front_ edge of the open space, first tapping it with his trunk, then pressing on it with his foot--of course with the toe end of the foot. And all along that front edge of the open space the ground bent down a little wherever he pressed it with his foot.  Then he came to the _right side_ of the open space where the banana tree grew, and tried the ground there also along the edge. And this ground too bent down a little wherever he pressed it with his foot.  He came to the _back_ of the open space, and tried it in the same way. And there also the ground bent down a little along the edge, wherever he pressed it with his foot.  He came around at last to the _left side_, and tried that also. And there again the ground bent down in the same way.  \"All four sides are suspicious!\" he cried. \"My son, this is _a most tricky trap_!\"  And though he did not see them, a dozen men were hiding in the tops of trees all around. They were the hunters kept by a great Prince, who had ordered them to catch the big elephant and also the young one.  The hunters had first dug a huge pit. It was ten feet deep and twenty-five feet wide on each side; so it was as big as a large room. Then they had covered the top of the pit by laying many long bamboos right across from side to side and very close to each other; so it was just like the roof of a large room. And on the top of the bamboos they had spread a layer of earth--just like what you have seen in flower beds in a garden; and on that they had planted grass, to make it look quite natural--only, they forgot that it might look natural for a garden, but not for a wild jungle. Or perhaps they thought that an elephant would not know any better!  And then they had gone to a plantation and fetched from there a banana tree, with a huge bunch of ripe bananas on it. They had set up the tree in the middle of that space; and as it would not keep straight, they had first driven a long bamboo rod right through into the ground, and then tied the banana tree to the top of the rod.  After doing all that, the hunters were hiding in the trees around. They were watching to see the big elephant and the little elephant come right up to the banana tree to eat the bananas, and get caught! For if any elephant stepped upon that place, the top would give way under his full weight, and he would fall right through into the pit.  But Salar's father grabbed him with his trunk, and pulled him away.  \"Come away!\" he said. \"This is a most hideous trap!\"  But Salar, who loved bananas quite as much as you love ice cream, began to cry.  \"I want the bananas; I want them; I do, I do!\" he kept saying over and over again.  Now his Papa was very fond of Salar, but he did not know how to reach the bananas and not fall into the pit. He and Salar walked home slowly.  \"I must think it over a bit,\" he said, scratching his head with a bough.  He came there the next day with Salar, and looked all around the place; but he could think of no safe way to get the bananas. The hunters also came there the next day, for by this time they were quite excited to see what the wily old elephant would do. In fact, it was from the chief hunter of that Prince that I heard afterwards what the elephant did do.  I must tell you here that these hunters had been watching the big elephant for many years, and trying to catch him by different kinds of traps; and that is how we know all about him and Salar. For when an elephant is very big and has fine tusks, people sometimes try for ten years to catch him, so that he may be used as the leading elephant of a grand palace.  _Almost all the elephants you see in the zoo or in a circus were once quite wild in the jungle_, and have been caught by some kind of trap. They are then tamed, and finally trained to do tricks that men want them to do. I shall tell you all about that in another book, when you are a little older.  But now about Salar and his father. On the third day the big elephant came there again, with Salar; and again the hunters came and hid in the trees around. This time the big elephant looked farther into the jungle. Then he saw the long bamboos growing in a clump--the very clump from which the hunters had got the bamboos to make the trap. As the elephant looked at the clump of bamboos, a thought came slowly into his head.  He pulled out a long bamboo, and returned to the place where the trap was. He stood just outside the trap, and thought again for some time. Then he held one end of the bamboo in his trunk, pointed the other end to the banana tree just where the stalk of the bunch began, and gave a jab.  But he did not aim right, and the bamboo slipped off from the stalk. So he tried again, and gave another jab at the stalk. In this way, after trying many times, he managed at last to hit the stalk and break it. Down fell the bunch of bananas to the ground.  Meanwhile Salar was jumping around his father for joy. But his father told him to keep still. He had not succeeded in getting those bananas yet! How could he get them out of the place of danger?  It puzzled him a long time. He poked at the bunch with the bamboo, but that only broke off one or two of the bananas. Then he poked at the stalk of the bunch, but the end of the bamboo slipped off it, as there was nothing on the bamboo to grip the stalk with.  So he drew back the bamboo and looked at that end of it, to see why it did not grip the stalk. Of course the end of the bamboo was all smooth, and could not grip anything at all.   _Elephant Tricks the Tricky Trappers_  Then at last another thought seemed to come into the wise old elephant's head. He put that end of the bamboo into his mouth and began to _chew_ it; for an elephant has very strong teeth at the back of his mouth. As his mouth was very big, that clever elephant chewed as much of the end of the bamboo as his mouth would hold--and that was as long as your arm. So the end of the bamboo became like fibers, that is, like a bunch of hair, only very thick and rough.  [Illustration: Elephant Pulling Bananas out of a Tricky Trap]  Then that cunning elephant sat down on the ground and pushed the bamboo along the ground straight before him toward the bananas. When the hairy end of the bamboo reached the stalk of the bananas, he began to _twist_ the other end of the bamboo with the tips of his trunk; for _an elephant can use the tips of his trunk in the same way that you use your fingers_.  He twisted and twisted many times, taking care to keep the hairy end of the bamboo pressed against the stalk of the bananas.  In this way the hairy end of the bamboo got knotted around the stalk. That was just what the wise old elephant wanted.  Then he pulled the bamboo slowly along the ground, as you see in the picture, taking care to give one or two more twists in case the knots came undone. He pulled the bamboo lap by lap; that is, he pulled the bamboo for about a yard, then he let go and took hold of the bamboo farther up; he pulled again for another yard, and so on. In this way he at last pulled the bunch of bananas quite out of the trap.  I need not tell you how he and Salar enjoyed that feast!  And the hunters, who were hiding in the trees around, laughed and laughed at the trick the wily old elephant had played on them! For, as you see, he got the bananas and yet escaped from that trap! He beat the men at their own game!  But now I must tell you about other animals,--first about buffaloes. They are the brave knights who helped that timid little lady, the blue deer. They are just as wonderful as the elephants, in their own way.     CHAPTER VI  Buffaloes: The Knights of the Jungle   There are three or four kinds of buffaloes that live in different countries. The kind that lives in America you may have already heard about. I am sorry to say that hunters have killed so many of them, that there are very few buffaloes left in the United States now; and these few are kept in parks.  So in this book I shall tell you about another kind of buffalo, that lives in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],["title","The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#6)"],["body","of India. These are the buffaloes that have to live in herds just because they have to guard themselves from the tiger. Yet they are much bigger than all other kinds of buffaloes in the world. Many of them are more than ten feet long, and a span taller than a tall man.  They have two huge horns which stand outward, one from each side of the head. Each horn is at least a yard long; and there are some buffaloes that have horns two yards long! (See the picture facing the next page.)  So you can understand that this kind of buffalo is a strong and mighty animal. But still, if just one buffalo tried to fight a tiger, the tiger could kill him every time. Why?  Because the tiger is much _quicker_ than the buffalo. The tiger could jump to the side to escape the buffalo's horns. Then the tiger could turn quickly, and strike the buffalo on the neck from behind. And though the buffalo's neck is very thick, the tiger himself is so strong that he could break the buffalo's neck at one blow.  So, to guard against the tiger, the buffaloes have to live together like a band of soldiers, so that the tiger never gets the chance of catching just one buffalo alone.  Now I shall tell you how these buffaloes live. They live in a part of the country where there is plenty of water, and lots of trees and grass. There is sure to be a stream or two in the jungles there, like the one where we saw the buffaloes drinking at midnight.  When the buffaloes are feeding in the jungle, and wandering here and there to find good grass to eat, they always try to remain somewhere near one of these streams.  Why do they do that? To drink, of course.  [Illustration: The Buffalo that lives in India]  And as the country is hot, they may want to drink more than once in the day.  Still, there is another reason why they like to be near water. Can you tell what it is?  \"To bathe in the water, when it is hot,\" you may say.  That is quite true; the buffaloes do enjoy a good bath. In fact, they like to remain in the water for a long time, when the sun is very hot. Then they lie down in the shallow part, and remain neck deep in the water. And every now and again they dip their heads in the water to keep them cool.  But even when the sun is not at all hot, when the sky is cloudy, the buffaloes like to go into a stream or a pond. Why?  \"Of course to wash themselves, and make themselves clean,\" you may say.   _Buffaloes Cover Body with Mud against Flies_  No, my dear, you are wrong this time! Like some little boys, buffaloes do not _want_ to make themselves clean! In fact, the buffaloes go into the stream or the pond to _cover themselves with mud_! To _wallow_, as it is called. They do that by rolling in the mud where the water is shallow.  And why do they want to cover themselves with mud? Because of the tormenting flies! Buffaloes of this kind do not have long hair on their necks, like the American buffaloes. In fact, they do not have much hair anywhere on their bodies--just like the ordinary cows which you have seen near your home. So they are very much tormented by the flies.  I have told you that an elephant can \"swat\" the flies with a bough which he holds in his trunk. But the buffalo has no trunk, and his tail can whisk off the flies for only a yard around. So, what can the buffalo do to guard other parts of his body from the flies?  The only thing he can do is to go down into the mud, roll about, and cover himself with the mud. Then he does not feel the flies at all, even if they swarm all over him. And he need not trouble to work his tail at all, as he is protected all over by the mud.  And when he comes out to feed again, if the sun happens to be very hot at that time, he does not mind it. Why? Because the mud on his body keeps off the sun. So, you see, the mud is useful to the buffalo in two ways.  But now come with me into the jungle while I show you all that the buffaloes do.  You must _imagine_ that I am taking you quietly through the jungle, where the buffalo herd is grazing right ahead of us. We are following them from behind. You must be careful not to make a sound. If you should tread on a rotten twig, the buffaloes would hear the sound as far away as a quarter of a mile.  In another book I shall tell you why all animals that keep their _ears close to the ground_ while they are feeding can _hear a sound a long way off_.  But now let us hide behind this bush for a minute, and watch the herd. They are eating the grass as they walk along. But do you see the wonderful way in which they are arranged? It is just like the shape of the moon when it is new, that is, something like the letter C, and which we call a crescent.  You saw at the midnight pool that, when the buffaloes drink or march, they are in rows close together, like soldiers. But when they are eating grass, they could not be in rows; because then they would be too close together to pick out the best bits of grass. So, how could they have enough to eat, and yet guard themselves from danger? To do this they thought of arranging themselves in the form of a crescent.   _How Buffaloes Guard against Tiger while Feeding_  It is a big crescent, as there are so many buffaloes that make it up. The ends of the crescent bend in toward each other, just as if the two tips of the letter C were to close up a little, leaving only a small opening between the tips.  The buffaloes have their faces toward the _outside_ of the crescent. So, as we are following the buffaloes from behind, we are looking at them through the gap between the tips.  There are only bulls in the line making up the crescent; the cows and the calves come behind them, so that they are _inside_ the crescent. So you see, while the buffaloes are grazing and moving along, if they meet any danger, the Papa buffaloes will face the danger. And as the Mammas and the children are inside the crescent, they are quite safe.  This is the way the buffaloes feed and move along:  The Papas on the outside of the crescent tear off a mouthful of grass, with one or two bites, and walk on a step or two while they are munching the mouthful. Then, with another bite or two, they take a fresh mouthful and walk on a step or two while they are munching that. In this way they leave enough grass for the Mammas and the young buffaloes that are following them.  But now let us come out of this thicket, and go after the herd very quietly from behind. We shall see some wonderful things.  You notice at once that the Mammas and the children do not show any fear at all, as they graze along; they are quite sure that the Papas are taking good care of them all the time. The little ones even play about here and there.  See that very young calf! He is playing about near the middle of the space. He is only a few weeks old, and not much bigger than the calf of the ordinary cow. Watch and see how playful he is! He is just like any other calf. His Mamma is grazing along quietly, and he is now standing still for a minute, looking at nothing. A calf and a baby can do that quite well--just stare, and yet look at nothing.  But now this buffalo calf rushes to his Mamma very suddenly, and has a mouthful of milk. He does not seem to want more than a mouthful at a time. So he looks up suddenly, and stares. Then just as suddenly he plunges into a frantic race over the ground, all by himself.  The race also ends suddenly--after going only ten yards. Then he stops there for a minute, stares, and trots back to his Mamma for another mouthful of milk. After that he looks up again for a minute, stares at nothing, and plunges into another mad gallop all by himself.  So you see that he spends his time doing two things--having a mouthful of milk, and then a mad gallop. And he does both very suddenly. He likes to have his joys suddenly.  A kitten or a puppy dog is different, and is nearly always doing something. It tumbles head over heels, or chases its own tail, or keeps frisking about in some way or other most of the time. But the buffalo calf is not like this; and when you see him standing quite still, staring at nothing, you can never tell whether he is going to be hungry for a mouthful of milk the next minute, or whether he is going to break into a frantic race.  But, you may ask, while he and all the other calves are playing about like that, is there no danger?  No, there is no danger, for the Papas are taking good care of the Mammas and the children, as I have told you before.  But, you may say, the Papas do not seem to be doing anything; they are just feeding and moving along. Then how are they taking care of the Mammas and the children?  Yes, but look carefully! See how close the horn of one Papa is to the horn of the next one! Why, there is not more than a couple of yards between the two! If there were any sudden danger, it would not take more than two or three steps for them to close up, and stand horn to horn.   _How Buffaloes Know Danger is Coming--Three Ways_  \"But how could they _know_ if any danger were coming?\" you may still ask.  They could know it in three ways: they could _smell_ the danger, or _hear_ it, or _see_ it. I shall tell you how they do all that.  First, if the danger came from the direction in which the wind was blowing, they would sniff the air, and so _smell_ the danger. If the danger were a tiger, the buffaloes could smell him half a mile off; that is about as far as ten blocks in a city. And if the wind were not blowing that way, the buffaloes could still smell the tiger five blocks away. They could smell the tiger, or any other danger, even if it came from behind.  The second way of finding out the danger is to _hear_ it. As I said a little while ago, if you should put your foot on a rotten twig, the buffaloes could hear the sound of it as far off as five blocks. And even if the danger came from behind, or from the side, or from anywhere, they could still hear it coming, if it made the least bit of sound that you and I could not hear.
