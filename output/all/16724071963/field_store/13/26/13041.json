By the way, it's too bad you couldn't get a story out of that Sam Skinner character.\"  \"Yeah. But there's nothing to it. After all, even the FBI tried to find out if there was anyone at all besides Porter who might know anything about it. No luck. Not even the technicians who worked with him knew anything useful. Skinner didn't know anything at all.\" He told the lie with a perfectly straight face. He didn't like lying to Winstein, but there was no other way. He hoped he wouldn't have to lie to the Congressional Committee; perjury was not something he liked doing. The trouble was, if he told the truth, he'd be worse off than if he lied.  He took the plane that night for Washington, and spent the next three days answering questions while he tried to keep his nerves under control. Not once did they even approach the area he wanted them to avoid.  On the plane back, he relaxed, closed his eyes, and, for the first time in days, allowed himself to think about Mr. Samuel Skinner.         *       *       *       *       *  The reports from the two detective agencies on the East and West Coasts hadn't made much sense separately, but together they added up to enough to have made it worth Elshawe's time to go to Los Angeles and tackle Samuel Skinner personally. He had called Skinner and made an appointment; Skinner had invited him out to his home.  It was a fairly big house, not too new, and it sat in the middle of a lot that was bigger than normal for land-hungry Los Angeles.  Elshawe ran through the scene mentally. He could see Skinner's mild face and hear his voice saying: \"Come in, Mr. Elshawe.\"  They went into the living room, and Skinner waved him toward a chair. \"Sit down. Want some coffee?\"  \"Thanks; I'd appreciate it.\" While Skinner made coffee, the reporter looked around the room. It wasn't overly showy, but it showed a sort of subdued wealth. It was obvious that Mr. Skinner wasn't lacking in comforts.  Skinner brought in the coffee and then sat down, facing Elshawe, in another chair. \"Now,\" he said bluntly, \"what was that remark you made on the phone about showing up Malcom Porter as a phony? I understood that you actually went to Mars on his ship. Don't you believe the evidence of your own senses?\"  \"I don't mean that kind of phony,\" Elshawe said. \"And you know it. I'll come to the point. I know that Malcom Porter didn't invent the Gravito-Inertial Differential Polarizer. _You_ did.\"  Skinner's eyes widened. \"Where did you get that information?\"  \"I can't tell you my sources, Mr. Skinner. Not yet, anyhow. But I have enough information to tell me that you're the man. It wouldn't hold up in court, but, with the additional information you can give me, I think it will.\"  Skinner looked baffled, as if not knowing what to say next.  \"Mr. Skinner,\" Elshawe went on, \"a research reporter has to have a little of the crusader in him, and maybe I've got more than most. You've discovered one of the greatest things in history--or invented it, whatever you want to call it. You deserve to go down in history along with Newton, Watt, Roentgen, Edison, Einstein, Fermi, and all the rest.  \"But somehow Malcom Porter stole your invention and he intends to take full credit for it. Oh, I know he's paid you plenty of money not to make any fuss, and he probably thinks you couldn't prove anything, anyway. But you don't have to be satisfied with his conscience money any more. With the backing of Magnum Telenews, you can blow Mister Glory-hound Porter's phony setup wide open and take the credit you deserve.\"  Skinner didn't look at all the way Elshawe had expected. Instead, he frowned a little and said: \"I'm glad you came, Mr. Elshawe. I didn't realize that there was enough evidence to connect me with his project.\" But he didn't look exactly overjoyed.  \"Well,\" Elshawe said tentatively, \"if you'll just answer a few questions--\"  \"Just a minute, Mr. Elshawe. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions first?\"  \"Go ahead.\"  Skinner leaned forward earnestly. \"Mr. Elshawe, who deserves credit for an invention? Who deserves the money?\"  \"Why ... why, the inventor, of course.\"  \"The inventor? Or the man who gives it to humanity?\"  \"I ... don't quite follow you.\"  He leaned back in his chair again. \"Mr. Elshawe, when I invented the Polarizer, I hadn't the remotest idea of what I'd invented. I taught general science in the high school Malcom Porter went to, and I had a lab in my basement. Porter was a pretty bright boy, and he liked to come around to my lab and watch me putter around. I had made this gadget--it was a toy for children as far as I was concerned. I didn't have any idea of its worth. It was just a little gadget that hopped up into the air and floated down again. Cute, but worthless, except as a novelty. And it was too expensive to build it as a novelty. So I forgot about it.  \"Years later, Porter came around to me and offered to buy it. I dug it out of the junk that was in my little workshop and sold it to him.  \"A couple of years after that, he came back. He said that he'd invented something. After beating all around the bush, he finally admitted that his invention was a development of my little toy. He offered me a million dollars if I'd keep my mouth shut and forget all about the thing.\"  \"And you accepted?\" Elshawe asked incredulously.  \"Certainly! I made him buy me a tax-paid annuity that pays me more than enough to get by on. I don't want wealth, Mr. Elshawe--just comfort. And that's why I gave it to him.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't follow you.\"  \"Let me tell you about Malcom Porter. He is one of that vast horde of people who want to be _someone_. They want to be respected and looked up to. But they either can't, or won't, take the time to learn the basics of the field they want to excel in. The beautiful girl who wants to be an actress without bothering to learn to act; the young man who wants to be a judge without going through law school, or be a general without studying military tactics; and Malcom Porter, the boy who wanted to be a great scientist--but didn't want to take the trouble to learn science.\"  Elshawe nodded. He was thinking of the \"artists\" who splatter up clean canvas and call it \"artistic self-expression.\" And the clodheads who write disconnected, meaningless prose and claim that it's free verse. The muddleminds who forget that Picasso learned to paint within the strict limits of classical art before he tried new methods, and that James Joyce learned to handle the English language well before he wrote \"Finnegan's Wake.\"  \"On the other hand,\" Skinner continued, \"I am ... well, rather a shy man. As soon as Malcom told me what the device would do when it was properly powered, I knew that there would be trouble. I am not a fighter, Mr. Elshawe. I have no desire to spend time in prison or be vilified in the news or called a crackpot by orthodox scientists.  \"I don't want to fight Malcom's claim, Mr. Elshawe. Don't you see, he _deserves_ the credit! In the first place, he recognized it for what it was. If he hadn't, Heaven only knows how long it would have been before someone rediscovered it. In the second place, he has fought and fought hard to give it to humanity. He has suffered in prison and spent millions of dollars to get the Polarizer into the hands of the United States Government. He has, in fact, worked harder and suffered more than if he'd taken the time and trouble to get a proper education. And it got him what he wanted; I doubt that he would have made a very good scientist, anyway.  \"Porter deserves every bit of credit for the Polarizer. I am perfectly happy with the way things are working out.\"  Elshawe said: \"But what if the FBI gets hold of the evidence I have?\"  \"That's why I have told you the truth, Mr. Elshawe,\" Skinner said earnestly. \"I want you to destroy that evidence. I would deny flatly that I had anything to do with the Polarizer, in any case. And that would put an end to any inquiry because no one would believe that I would deny inventing something like that. But I would just as soon that the question never came up. I would rather that there be no whisper whatever of anything like that.\"  He paused for a moment, then, very carefully, he said: \"Mr. Elshawe, you have intimated that the inventor of the Polarizer deserves some kind of reward. I assure you that the greatest reward you could give me would be to help me destroy all traces of any connection with the device. Will you do that, Mr. Elshawe?\"  Elshawe just sat silently in the chair for long minutes, thinking. Skinner didn't interrupt; he simply waited patiently.  After about ten minutes, Elshawe put his pipe carefully on a nearby table and reached down to pick up his briefcase. He handed it to Skinner.  \"Here. It contains all the evidence I have. Including, I might say, the recording of our conversation here. Just take the tape out of the minirecorder. A man like you deserves whatever reward he wants. Take it, Mr. Skinner.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Skinner softly, taking the briefcase.         *       *       *       *       *  And, on the plane winging back to New York from the Congressional investigation, Mr. Terrence Elshawe sighed softly. He was glad none of the senators had asked anything about Skinner, because he knew he would certainly have had to tell the truth.  And he knew, just as certainly, that he would have been in a great deal more hot water than Porter had been. Because Malcom Porter was going to become American Hero Number One, and Terry Elshawe would have ended up as the lying little sneak who had tried to destroy the reputation of the great Malcom Porter.  Which, all things considered, would have been a hell of a note.   THE END     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ September     1960.
