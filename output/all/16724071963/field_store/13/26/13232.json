All mild methods of punishment having failed, the teacher had called to talk it over with Mrs. Grant, with the happy result that Teddy's behaviour had improved--in the matter of crickets at least.  But it was about time for another outbreak. Teddy had been unnaturally good for too long a time. Poor Mrs. Grant feared that it was the calm before a storm, and it was with nervous haste that she went to the door and greeted the young teacher.  He was a slight, pale, boyish-looking fellow, with an abstracted, musing look in his large dark eyes. Mrs. Grant noticed with amusement that he wore a white straw hat in spite of the season. His eyes were directed to her face with his usual unseeing gaze.  \"Just as though he was looking through me at something a thousand miles away,\" said Mrs. Grant afterwards. \"I believe he was, too. His body was right there on the step before me, but where his soul was is more than you or I or anybody can tell.\"  \"Good morning,\" he said absently. \"I have just called on my way to school with a message from Miss Millar. She wants you all to come up and have Christmas dinner with her tomorrow.\"  \"For the land's sake!\" said Mrs. Grant blankly. \"I don't understand.\" To herself she thought, \"I wish I dared take him and shake him to find if he's walking in his sleep or not.\"  \"You and all the children--every one,\" went on the teacher dreamily, as if he were reciting a lesson learned beforehand. \"She told me to tell you to be sure and come. Shall I say that you will?\"  \"Oh, yes, that is--I suppose--I don't know,\" said Mrs. Grant incoherently. \"I never expected--yes, you may tell her we'll come,\" she concluded abruptly.  \"Thank you,\" said the abstracted messenger, gravely lifting his hat and looking squarely through Mrs. Grant into unknown regions. When he had gone Mrs. Grant went in and sat down, laughing in a sort of hysterical way.  \"I wonder if it is all right. Could Cornelia really have told him? She must, I suppose, but it is enough to take one's breath.\"  Mrs. Grant and Cornelia Millar were cousins, and had once been the closest of friends, but that was years ago, before some spiteful reports and ill-natured gossip had come between them, making only a little rift at first that soon widened into a chasm of coldness and alienation. Therefore this invitation surprised Mrs. Grant greatly.  Miss Cornelia was a maiden lady of certain years, with a comfortable bank account and a handsome, old-fashioned house on the hill behind the village. She always boarded the schoolteachers and looked after them maternally; she was an active church worker and a tower of strength to struggling ministers and their families.  \"If Cornelia has seen fit at last to hold out the hand of reconciliation I'm glad enough to take it. Dear knows, I've wanted to make up often enough, but I didn't think she ever would. We've both of us got too much pride and stubbornness. It's the Turner blood in us that does it. The Turners were all so set. But I mean to do my part now she has done hers.\"  And Mrs. Grant made a final attack on the dishes with a beaming face.  When the little Grants came home and heard the news, Teddy stood on his head to express his delight, the twins kissed each other, and Mary Alice and Gordon danced around the kitchen.  Keith thought himself too big to betray any joy over a Christmas dinner, but he whistled while doing the chores until the bare welkin in the yard rang, and Teddy, in spite of unheard of misdemeanours, was not collared off into the porch once.  When the young teacher got home from school that evening he found the yellow house full of all sorts of delectable odours. Miss Cornelia herself was concocting mince pies after the famous family recipe, while her ancient and faithful handmaiden, Hannah, was straining into moulds the cranberry jelly. The open pantry door revealed a tempting array of Christmas delicacies.  \"Did you call and invite the Smithsons up to dinner as I told you?\" asked Miss Cornelia anxiously.  \"Yes,\" was the dreamy response as he glided through the kitchen and vanished into the hall.  Miss Cornelia crimped the edges of her pies delicately with a relieved air. \"I made certain he'd forget it,\" she said. \"You just have to watch him as if he were a mere child. Didn't I catch him yesterday starting off to school in his carpet slippers? And in spite of me he got away today in that ridiculous summer hat. You'd better set that jelly in the out-pantry to cool, Hannah; it looks good. We'll give those poor little Smithsons a feast for once in their lives if they never get another.\"  At this juncture the hall door flew open and Mr. Palmer appeared on the threshold. He seemed considerably agitated and for once his eyes had lost their look of space-searching.  \"Miss Millar, I am afraid I did make a mistake this morning--it has just dawned on me. I am almost sure that I called at Mrs. Grant's and invited her and her family instead of the Smithsons. And she said they would come.\"  Miss Cornelia's face was a study.  \"Mr. Palmer,\" she said, flourishing her crimping fork tragically, \"do you mean to say you went and invited Linda Grant here tomorrow? Linda Grant, of all women in this world!\"  \"I did,\" said the teacher with penitent wretchedness. \"It was very careless of me--I am very sorry. What can I do? I'll go down and tell them I made a mistake if you like.\"  \"You can't do that,\" groaned Miss Cornelia, sitting down and wrinkling up her forehead in dire perplexity. \"It would never do in the world. For pity's sake, let me think for a minute.\"  Miss Cornelia did think--to good purpose evidently, for her forehead smoothed out as her meditations proceeded and her face brightened. Then she got up briskly. \"Well, you've done it and no mistake. I don't know that I'm sorry, either. Anyhow, we'll leave it as it is. But you must go straight down now and invite the Smithsons too. And for pity's sake, don't make any more mistakes.\"  When he had gone Miss Cornelia opened her heart to Hannah. \"I never could have done it myself--never; the Turner is too strong in me. But I'm glad it is done. I've been wanting for years to make up with Linda. And now the chance has come, thanks to that blessed blundering boy, I mean to make the most of it. Mind, Hannah, you never whisper a word about its being a mistake. Linda must never know. Poor Linda! She's had a hard time. Hannah, we must make some more pies, and I must go straight down to the store and get some more Santa Claus stuff; I've only got enough to go around the Smithsons.\"  When Mrs. Grant and her family arrived at the yellow house next morning Miss Cornelia herself ran out bareheaded to meet them. The two women shook hands a little stiffly and then a rill of long-repressed affection trickled out from some secret spring in Miss Cornelia's heart and she kissed her new-found old friend tenderly. Linda returned the kiss warmly, and both felt that the old-time friendship was theirs again.  The little Smithsons all came and they and the little Grants sat down on the long bright dining room to a dinner that made history in their small lives, and was eaten over again in happy dreams for months.  How those children did eat! And how beaming Miss Cornelia and grim-faced, soft-hearted Hannah and even the absent-minded teacher himself enjoyed watching them!  After dinner Miss Cornelia distributed among the delighted little souls the presents she had bought for them, and then turned them loose in the big shining kitchen to have a taffy pull--and they had it to their hearts' content! And as for the shocking, taffyfied state into which they got their own rosy faces and that once immaculate domain--well, as Miss Cornelia and Hannah never said one word about it, neither will I.  The four women enjoyed the afternoon in their own way, and the schoolteacher buried himself in algebra to his own great satisfaction.  When her guests went home in the starlit December dusk, Miss Cornelia walked part of the way with them and had a long confidential talk with Mrs. Grant. When she returned it was to find Hannah groaning in and over the kitchen and the schoolteacher dreamily trying to clean some molasses off his boots with the kitchen hairbrush. Long-suffering Miss Cornelia rescued her property and despatched Mr. Palmer into the woodshed to find the shoe-brush. Then she sat down and laughed.  \"Hannah, what will become of that boy yet? There's no counting on what he'll do next. I don't know how he'll ever get through the world, I'm sure, but I'll look after him while he's here at least. I owe him a huge debt of gratitude for this Christmas blunder. What an awful mess this place is in! But, Hannah, did you ever in the world see anything so delightful as that little Tommy Smithson stuffing himself with plum cake, not to mention Teddy Grant? It did me good just to see them.\"     A Strayed Allegiance   \"Will you go to the Cove with me this afternoon?\"  It was Marian Lesley who asked the question.  Esterbrook Elliott unpinned with a masterful touch the delicate cluster of Noisette rosebuds she wore at her throat and transferred them to his buttonhole as he answered courteously: \"Certainly. My time, as you know, is entirely at your disposal.\"  They were standing in the garden under the creamy bloom of drooping acacia trees. One long plume of blossoms touched lightly the soft, golden-brown coils of the girl's hair and cast a wavering shadow over the beautiful, flower-like face beneath it.  Esterbrook Elliott, standing before her, thought proudly that he had never seen a woman who might compare with her. In every detail she satisfied his critical, fastidious taste. There was not a discordant touch about her.  Esterbrook Elliott had always loved Marian Lesley--or thought he had. They had grown up together from childhood. He was an only son and she an only daughter. It had always been an understood thing between the two families"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24873"],["title","Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 (#5)"],["body","the boy and girl should marry. But Marian's father had decreed that no positive pledge should pass between them until Marian was twenty-one.  Esterbrook accepted his mapped-out destiny and selected bride with the conviction that he was an exceptionally lucky fellow. Out of all the women in the world Marian was the very one whom he would have chosen as mistress of his fine, old home. She had been his boyhood's ideal. He believed that he loved her sincerely, but he was not too much in love to be blind to the worldly advantages of his marriage with his cousin.  His father had died two years previously, leaving him wealthy and independent. Marian had lost her mother in childhood; her father died when she was eighteen. Since then she had lived alone with her aunt. Her life was quiet and lonely. Esterbrook's companionship was all that brightened it, but it was enough. Marian lavished on him all the rich, womanly love of her heart. On her twenty-first birthday they were formally betrothed. They were to be married in the following autumn.  No shadow had drifted across the heaven of her happiness. She believed herself secure in her lover's unfaltering devotion. True, at times she thought his manner lacked a lover's passionate ardour. He was always attentive and courteous. She had only to utter a wish to find that it had been anticipated; he spent every spare minute at her side.  Yet sometimes she half wished he would betray more lover-like impatience and intensity. Were all lovers as calm and undemonstrative?  She reproached herself for this incipient disloyalty as often as it vexingly intruded its unwelcome presence across her inner consciousness. Surely Esterbrook was fond and devoted enough to satisfy the most exacting demands of affection. Marian herself was somewhat undemonstrative and reserved. Passing acquaintances called her cold and proud. Only the privileged few knew the rich depths of womanly tenderness in her nature.  Esterbrook thought that he fully appreciated her. As he had walked homeward the night of their betrothal, he had reviewed with unconscious criticism his mental catalogue of Marian's graces and good qualities, admitting, with supreme satisfaction, that there was not one thing about her that he could wish changed.  This afternoon, under the acacias, they had been planning about their wedding. There was no one to consult but themselves.  They were to be married early in September and then go abroad. Esterbrook mapped out the details of their bridal tour with careful thoughtfulness. They would visit all the old-world places that Marian wished to see. Afterwards they would come back home. He discussed certain changes he wished to make in the old Elliott mansion to fit it for a young and beautiful mistress.  He did most of the planning. Marian was content to listen in happy silence. Afterwards she had proposed this walk to the Cove.  \"What particular object of charity have you found at the Cove now?\" asked Esterbrook, with lazy interest, as they walked along.  \"Mrs. Barrett's little Bessie is very ill with fever,\" answered Marian. Then, catching his anxious look, she hastened to add, \"It is nothing infectious--some kind of a slow, sapping variety. There is no danger, Esterbrook.\"  \"I was not afraid for myself,\" he replied quietly. \"My alarm was for you. You are too precious to me, Marian, for me to permit you to risk health and life, if it were dangerous. What a Lady Bountiful you are to those people at the Cove. When we are married you must take me in hand and teach me your creed of charity. I'm afraid I've lived a rather selfish life. You will change all that, dear. You will make a good man of me.\"  \"You are that now, Esterbrook,\" she said softly. \"If you were not, I could not love you.\"  \"It is a negative sort of goodness, I fear. I have never been tried or tempted severely. Perhaps I should fail under the test.\"  \"I am sure you would not,\" answered Marian proudly.  Esterbrook laughed; her faith in him was pleasant. He had no thought but that he would prove worthy of it.  The Cove, so-called, was a little fishing hamlet situated on the low, sandy shore of a small bay. The houses, clustered in one spot, seemed like nothing so much as larger shells washed up by the sea, so grey and bleached were they from long exposure to sea winds and spray.  Dozens of ragged children were playing about them, mingled with several disreputable yellow curs that yapped noisily at the strangers.  Down on the sandy strip of beach below the houses groups of men were lounging about. The mackerel, season had not yet set in; the spring herring netting was past. It was holiday time among the sea folks. They were enjoying it to the full, a happy, ragged colony, careless of what the morrows might bring forth.  Out beyond, the boats were at anchor, floating as gracefully on the twinkling water as sea birds, their tall masts bowing landward on the swell. A lazy, dreamful calm had fallen over the distant seas; the horizon blues were pale and dim; faint purple hazes blurred the outlines of far-off headlands and cliffs; the yellow sands sparkled in the sunshine as if powdered with jewels.  A murmurous babble of life buzzed about the hamlet, pierced through by the shrill undertones of the wrangling children, most of whom had paused in their play to scan the visitors with covert curiosity.  Marian led the way to a house apart from the others at the very edge of the shelving rock. The dooryard was scrupulously clean and unlittered; the little footpath through it was neatly bordered by white clam shells; several thrifty geraniums in bloom looked out from the muslin-curtained windows.  A weary-faced woman came forward to meet them.  \"Bessie's much the same, Miss Lesley,\" she said, in answer to Marian's inquiry. \"The doctor you sent was here today and did all he could for her. He seemed quite hopeful. She don't complain or nothing--just lies there and moans. Sometimes she gets restless. It's very kind of you to come so often, Miss Lesley. Here, Magdalen, will you put this basket the lady's brought up there on the shelf?\"  A girl, who had been sitting unnoticed with her back to the visitors, at the head of the child's cot in one corner of the room, stood up and slowly turned around. Marian and Esterbrook Elliott both started with involuntary surprise. Esterbrook caught his breath like a man suddenly awakened from sleep. In the name of all that was wonderful, who or what could this girl be, so little in harmony with her surroundings?  Standing in the crepuscular light of the corner, her marvellous beauty shone out with the vivid richness of some rare painting. She was tall, and the magnificent proportions of her figure were enhanced rather than marred by the severely plain dress of dark print that she wore. The heavy masses of her hair, a shining auburn dashed with golden foam, were coiled in a rich, glossy knot at the back of the classically modelled head and rippled back from a low brow whose waxen fairness even the breezes of the ocean had spared.  The girl's face was a full, perfect oval, with features of faultless regularity, and the large, full eyes were of tawny hazel, darkened into inscrutable gloom in the dimness of the corner.  Not even Marian Lesley's face was more delicately tinted, but not a trace of colour appeared in the smooth, marble-like cheeks; yet the waxen pallor bore no trace of disease or weakness, and the large, curving mouth was of an intense crimson.  She stood quite motionless. There was no trace of embarrassment or self-consciousness in her pose. When Mrs. Barrett said, \"This is my niece, Magdalen Crawford,\" she merely inclined her head in grave, silent acknowledgement. As she moved forward to take Marian's basket, she seemed oddly out of place in the low, crowded room. Her presence seemed to throw a strange restraint over the group.  Marian rose and went over to the cot, laying her slender hand on the hot forehead of the little sufferer. The child opened its brown eyes questioningly.  \"How are you today, Bessie?\"  \"Mad'len--I want Mad'len,\" moaned the little plaintive voice.  Magdalen came over and stood beside Marian Lesley.  \"She wants me,\" she said in a low, thrilling voice; free from all harsh accent or intonation. \"I am the only one she seems to know always. Yes, darling, Mad'len is here--right beside you. She will not leave you.\"  She knelt by the little cot and passed her arm under the child's neck, drawing the curly head close to her throat with a tender, soothing motion.  Esterbrook Elliott watched the two women intently--the one standing by the cot, arrayed in simple yet costly apparel, with her beautiful, high-bred face, and the other, kneeling on the bare, sanded floor in her print dress, with her splendid head bent low over the child and the long fringe of burnished lashes sweeping the cold pallor of the oval cheek.  From the moment that Magdalen Crawford's haunting eyes had looked straight into his for one fleeting second, an unnamable thrill of pain and pleasure stirred his heart, a thrill so strong and sudden and passionate that his face paled with emotion; the room seemed to swim before his eyes in a mist out of which gleamed that wonderful face with its mesmeric, darkly radiant eyes, burning their way into deeps and abysses of his soul hitherto unknown to him.  When the mist cleared away and his head grew steadier, he wondered at himself. Yet he trembled in every limb and the only clear idea that struggled out of his confused thoughts was an overmastering desire to take that cold face between his hands and kiss it until its passionless marble glowed into warm and throbbing life.  \"Who is that girl?\" he said abruptly, when they had left the cottage. \"She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen--present company always excepted,\" he concluded, with a depreciatory laugh.  The delicate bloom on Marian's face deepened slightly.  \"You had much better to have omitted that last sentence,\""]]]
