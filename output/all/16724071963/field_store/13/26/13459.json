CHAPTER I.  THE BOY THAT WAS NOT LOADED.   In the course of his travels in Europe, Rollo went with his uncle George one summer to spend a fortnight in Scotland.  There are several ways of going into Scotland from England. One way is to take a steamer from Liverpool, and go up the Clyde to Glasgow. This was the route that Mr. George and Rollo took.  On the way from Liverpool to Glasgow, Rollo became acquainted with a boy named Waldron Kennedy. Waldron was travelling with his father and mother and two sisters. His sisters were mild and gentle girls, and always kept near their mother; but Waldron seemed to be always getting into difficulty, or mischief. He was just about Rollo's age, but was a little taller. He was a very strong boy, and full of life and spirits. He was very venturesome, too, and he was continually frightening his mother by getting himself into what seemed to her dangerous situations. One morning, when she came up on deck, just after the steamer entered the mouth of the Clyde, she almost fainted away at seeing Waldron half way up the shrouds. He was poising himself there on one of the ratlines, resting upon one foot, and holding on with only one hand.  To prevent his doing such things, Waldron's mother kept him under the closest possible restraint, and would hardly let him go away from her side. She watched him, too, very closely all the time, and worried him with perpetual cautions. It was always, \"Waldron, don't do this,\" or, \"Waldron, you must not do that,\" or, \"Waldron, don't go there.\" This confinement made Waldron very restless and uneasy; so that, on the whole, both he himself and his mother, too, had a very uncomfortable time of it.  \"He worries my life out of me,\" she used to say, \"and spoils all the pleasure of my tour. O, if he were only a girl!\"  Mr. George had been acquainted with Mr. Kennedy and his family in New York, and they were all very glad to meet him on board the steamer.  On the morning after the steamer entered the mouth of the Clyde, Mrs. Kennedy and her daughters were sitting on a settee upon the deck, with books in their hands. From time to time they read in these books, and in the intervals they looked at the scenery. Waldron stood near them, leaning in a listless manner on the railing. Rollo came up to the place, and accosted Waldron, saying,--  \"Come, Waldron, come with me.\"  \"Hush!\" said Waldron, in a whisper. \"You go out there by the paddle box and wait a moment, till my mother begins to look on her book again, and then I'll steal away and come.\"  But Rollo never liked to obtain any thing by tricks and treachery, and so he turned to Mrs. Kennedy, and, in a frank and manly manner, said,--  \"Mrs. Kennedy, may Waldron go away with me a little while?\"  \"Why, I am afraid, Rollo,\" said Mrs. Kennedy. \"He always gets into some mischief or other the moment he is out of my sight.\"  \"O, we shall be under my uncle George's care,\" said Rollo. \"I am going out there where he is sitting.\"  \"Well,\" said Mrs. Kennedy, hesitating, and looking very timid,--\"well, Waldron may go a little while. But, Waldron, you must be sure and stay by Mr. George, or, at least, not go any where without his leave.\"  \"Yes,\" said Waldron, \"I will.\"  So he and Rollo went away, and walked leisurely towards the place where Mr. George was sitting.  \"I am glad we are coming up this river, to Greenock and Glasgow,\" said Waldron.  \"Why?\" asked Rollo.  \"Because of the steamboats,\" said Waldron.  \"Do they build a great many steamboats in Greenock and Glasgow?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Waldron; \"this is the greatest place for building steamboats in the world.\"  \"Except New York,\" said Rollo.  \"O, of course, except New York,\" replied Waldron. \"But they build all the big English steamers in this river. All the Cunarders were built here, and they have got some of the best machine shops and founderies here that there are in the world. I should like to go all about and see them, if I could only get away from my mother.\"  \"Why, won't she let you go?\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" replied Waldron, \"not if she knows it. She thinks I am a little boy, and is so afraid that I shall get _hurt_!\"  Waldron pronounced the word _hurt_ in a drawling and contemptuous tone, which was so comical that Rollo could not help laughing outright.  \"I go to all the ship yards and founderies in New York whenever I please,\" continued Waldron. \"I go when she does not know it. Sometimes the men let me help them carry out the melted iron, and pour it into the moulds.\"  By this time the two boys had reached the place where Mr. George was. He was sitting on what is called a camp stool, and was engaged in reading his guide book, and studying the map, with a view of finding out what route it would be best to take in the tour they were about making in Scotland. Mr. George drew the boys into conversation with him on the subject. His object was to become acquainted with Waldron, and find out what sort of a boy he was.  \"Where do you wish to go, Waldron?\" said Mr. George.  \"Why, I want to stay here a good many days,\" said Waldron, \"to see the steamers and the dockyards. They are building a monstrous iron ship, somewhere here. She is going to be five hundred tons bigger than the Baltic.\"  \"I should like to see her,\" said Mr. George.  As he said this he kept his eye upon his map, following his finger, as he moved it about from place to place, as if he was studying out a good way to go.  \"There is Edinburgh,\" said Mr. George; \"we must certainly go to Edinburgh.\"  \"Yes,\" said Waldron, \"I suppose that is a pretty great place. Besides, I want to see the houses twelve stories high.\"  \"And there is Linlithgow,\" continued Mr. George, still looking upon his map. \"That is the place where Mary, Queen of Scots, was born. Waldron, would you like to go there?\"  \"Why, no,\" said Waldron, doubtfully, \"not much. I don't care much about that.\"  \"It is a famous old ruin,\" said Mr. George.  \"But I don't care much about the old ruins,\" said Waldron. \"If the lords and noblemen are as rich as people say they are, I should think they would mend them up.\"  \"And here, off in the western part of Scotland,\" continued Mr. George, \"are a great many mountains. Would you like to go and see the mountains?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Waldron, \"not particularly.\" Then in a moment he added, \"Can we go up to the top of them, Mr. George?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"we can go to the top of some of them.\"  \"The highest?\" asked Waldron.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"Ben Nevis, I believe, is the highest. We can go to the top of that.\"  \"Then I should like to go,\" said Waldron, eagerly.  \"Unless,\" continued Mr. George, \"it should rain _too_ hard.\"  \"O, I should not care for the rain,\" said Waldron. \"It's good fun to go in the rain.\"  While this conversation had been going on, Waldron had been looking this way and that, at the"]]]
