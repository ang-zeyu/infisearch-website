Some of her younger women wore no linen on their heads and had their white arms bare, with bracelets shining on them. They, too, were tall and strong.  All the time men were calling across the fire to one another asking news or telling jokes and laughing.  An old man, Harald's uncle, sat in the high seat on the north side. That was the place of honor. But the high seat on the south side was empty; for that was the king's seat. Harald sat on the steps before it.  The feast went merrily until long after midnight. Then the thralls took some of the guests to the guest house to sleep, and some to the beds around the sides of the feast hall. But some men lay down on the benches and drew their cloaks over themselves.  On the next night there was another feast. Still Harald sat on the step before the high seat. But when the tables were gone and the horns were going around, he stood up and raised high a horn of ale and said loudly:  \"This horn of memory I drink in honor of my father, Halfdan, son of Gudrod, who sits now in Valhalla. And I vow that I will grind my father's foes under my heel.\"  Then he drank the ale and sat down in the king's high seat, while all the men stood up and raised their horns and shouted:  \"King Harald!\"  And some cried:  \"That was a brave vow.\"  [Illustration: \"_I vow that I will grind my father's foes under my heel_\"]  And Harald's uncle called out:  \"A health to King Harald!\"  And they all drank it.  Then a man stood up and said:  \"Hear my song of King Halfdan!\" for this man was a skald.  \"Yes, the song!\" shouted the men, and Harald nodded his head.  So the skald took down his great harp from the wall behind him and went and stood before Harald. The bottom of the harp rested on the floor, but the top reached as high as the skald's shoulders. The brass frame shone in the light. The strings were some of gold and some of silver. The man struck them with his hand and sang of King Halfdan, of his battles, of his strong arm and good sword, of his death, and of how men loved him.  When he had finished, King Harald took a bracelet from his arm and gave it to him, saying:  \"Take this as thanks for your good song.\"  The guests stayed the next day and at night there was another feast. When the mead horns were going around, King Harald stood up and spoke:  \"I said that no man should go away empty-handed from drinking my father's funeral ale.\"  He beckoned the thralls, and they brought in a great treasure-chest and set it down by the high seat. King Harald opened it and took out rich gifts--capes and sword-belts and beautiful cloth and bracelets and gold cloak-pins. These he sent about the hall and gave something to every man. The guests wondered at the richness of his gifts.  \"This young king has an open hand,\" they said, \"and deep treasure-chests.\"  After breakfast the next morning the guests went out and stood by their horses ready to go, but before they mounted, thralls brought a horn of mead to each man. That was called the stirrup-horn, because after they drank it the men put their feet to the stirrups and sprang upon their horses and started. King Harald and his people rode a little way with them.  All men said that that was the richest funeral feast that ever was held.   FOOTNOTES:  [6] See note about feast hall on page 196.  [7] See note about tables on page 196.     [Illustration]  Harald's Battle   Now King Halfdan had many foes. When he was alive they were afraid to make war upon him, for he was a mighty warrior. But when Harald became king, they said:  \"He is but a lad. We will fight with him and take his land.\"  So they began to make ready. King Harald heard of this and he laughed and said:  \"Good! 'Foes'-fear' is thirsty, and my legs are stiff with much sitting.\"  He called three men to him. To one he gave an arrow, saying:  \"Run and carry this arrow north. Give it into the hands of the master of the next farm, and say that all men are to meet here within two weeks from this day. They must come ready for war and mounted on horses. Say also that if a man does not obey this call, or if he receives this arrow and does not carry it on to his next neighbor, he shall be outlawed from this country, and his land shall be taken from him.\"  He gave arrows to the other two men and told them to run south and east with the same message.  So all through King Harald's country men were soon busy mending helmets and polishing swords and making shields. There was blazing of forges and clanging of anvils all through the land.  On the day set, the fields about King Harald's house were full of men and horses. After breakfast a horn blew. Every man snatched his weapons and jumped upon his horse. Men of the same neighborhood stood together, and their chief led them. They waited for the starting horn. This did not look like our army. There were no uniforms. Some men wore helmets, some did not. Some wore coats of mail, but others wore only their jackets and tights of bright-colored wool. But at each man's left side hung a great shield. Over his right shoulder went his sword-belt and held his long sword under his left hand. Above most men's heads shone the points of their tall spears. Some men carried axes in their belts. Some carried bows and arrows. Many had ram's horns hanging from their necks.  King Harald rode at the front of his army with his standard-bearer beside him. Chain-armor covered the king's body. A red cloak was thrown over his shoulders. On his head was a gold helmet with a dragon standing up from it. He carried a round shield on his left arm. The king had made that shield himself. It was of brass. The rivets were of silver, with strangely shaped heads. On the back of Harald's horse was a red cloth trimmed with the fur of ermine.  King Harald looked up at his standard and laughed aloud.  \"Oh, War-lover,\" he cried, \"you and I ride out on a gay journey.\"  A horn blew again and the army started. The men shouted as they went, and blew their ram's horns.  \"Now we shall taste something better than even King Harald's ale,\" shouted one.  Another rose in his stirrups and sniffed the air.  \"Ah! I smell a battle,\" he cried. \"It is sweeter than those strange waters of Arabia.\"  So the army went merrily through the land. They carried no tents, they had no provision wagons.  \"The sky is a good enough tent for a soldier,\" said the Norsemen. \"Why carry provisions when they lie in the farms beside you?\"  After two days King Harald saw another army on the hills.  \"Thorstein,\" he shouted, \"up with the white shield and go tell King Haki to choose his battle-field. We will wait but an hour. I am eager for the frolic.\"  So Thorstein raised a white shield on his spear as a sign that he came on an errand of peace. He rode near King Haki, but he could not wait until he came close before he shouted out his message and then turned and rode back.  \"Tell your boy king that we will not hang back,\" Haki called after Thorstein.  King Harald's men waited on the hillside and watched the other army across the valley. They saw King Haki point and saw twenty men ride off as he pointed. They stopped in a patch of hazel and hewed with their axes.  \"They are getting the hazels,\" said Thorstein.  \"Audun,\" said King Harald to a man near him, \"stay close to my standard all day. You must see the best of the fight. I want to hear a song about it after it is over.\"  This Audun was the skald who sang at the drinking of King Halfdan's funeral ale.  King Haki's men rode down into the valley. They drove down stakes all about a great field. They tied the hazel twigs to the stakes in a string. But they left an open space toward King Harald's army and one toward King Haki's. Then a man raised a white shield and galloped toward King Harald.  \"We are ready!\" he shouted.  At the same time King Haki raised a red shield. King Harald's men put their shields before their mouths and shouted into them. It made a great roaring war-cry.  \"Up with the war shield!\" shouted King Harald. \"Horns blow!\"  There was a blowing of horns on both sides. The two armies galloped down into the field and ran together. The fight had begun.  All that day long swords were flashing, spears flying, men shouting, men falling from their horses, swords clashing against shields.  \"Victory flashes from that dragon,\" Harald's men said, pointing to the king's helmet. \"No one stands before it.\"  And, surely, before night came, King Haki fell dead under \"Foes'-fear.\" When he fell, a great shout went up from his warriors, and they turned and fled. King Harald's men chased them far, but during the night came back to camp. Many brought swords and helmets and bracelets or silver-trimmed saddles and bridles with them.  \"Here is what we got from the foe,\" they said.  The next morning King Harald spoke to his men:  \"Let us go about and find our dead.\"  [Illustration: \"_King Haki fell dead under 'Foes'-fear'_\"]  So they went over all the battle-field. They put every man on his shield and carried him and laid him on a hill-top. They hung his sword over his shoulder and laid his spear by his side. So they laid all the dead together there on the hill-top. Then King Harald said, looking about:  \"This is a good place to lie. It looks far over the country. The sound of the sea reaches it. The wind sweeps here. It is a good grave for Norsemen and Vikings. But it is a long road and a rough road to Valhalla that these men must travel. Let the nearest kinsman of each man come and tie on his hell-shoes. Tie them fast, for they will need them much on that hard road.\"  So friends tied shoes on the dead men's feet. Then King Harald said:  \"Now let us make the mound.\"  Every man set to work with what tools he had and heaped earth over the dead until a great mound stood up. They piled stones on the top. On one of these stones King Harald made runes telling how these men had died.  After that was done King Harald said:  \"Now set up the pole, Thorstein. Let every man"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24811"],["title","Viking Tales (#5)"],["body","to that pole all that he took from the foe.\"  So they did, and there was a great hill of things around it. Harald divided it into piles.  \"This pile we will give to Thor in thanks for the victory,\" he said. \"This pile is mine because I am king. Here are the piles for the chiefs, and these things go to the other men of the army.\"  So every man went away from that battle richer than he was before, and Thor looked down from Valhalla upon his full temple and was pleased.  The next morning King Harald led his army back. But on the way he met other foes and had many battles and did not lose one. The kings either died in battle or ran away, and Harald had their lands.  \"He has kept his vow,\" men said, \"and ground his father's foes under his heel.\"  So King Harald sat in peace for a while.     [Illustration]  Gyda's Saucy Message   Now Harald heard men talk of Gyda, the daughter of King Eric.  \"She is very beautiful,\" they said, \"but she is very proud, too. She can both read and make runes. No other woman in the world knows so much about herbs as she does. She can cure any sickness. And she is proud of all this!\"  Now when King Harald heard that, he thought to himself:  \"Fair and proud. I like them both. I will have her for my wife.\"  So he called his uncle, Guthorm, and said:  \"Take rich gifts and go to Gyda's foster-father[8] and tell him that I will marry Gyda.\"  So Guthorm and his men came to that house and they told the king's message to the foster-father. Gyda was standing near, weaving a rich cloak. She heard the speech. She came up and said, holding her head high and curling her lip:  \"I will not waste myself on a king of so few people. Norway is a strange country. There is a little king here and a little king there--hundreds of them scattered about. Now in Denmark there is but one great king over the whole land. And it is so in Sweden. Is no one brave enough to make all of Norway his own?\"  She laughed a scornful laugh and walked away. The men stood with open mouths and stared after her. Could it be that she had sent that saucy message to King Harald? They looked at her foster-father. He was chuckling in his beard and said nothing to them. They started out of the house in anger. When they were at the door, Gyda came up to them again and said:  \"Give this message to your King Harald for me: I will not be his wife unless he puts all of Norway under him for my sake.\"  [Illustration: \"_I will not be his wife unless he puts all of Norway under him for my sake_\"]  So Guthorm and his men rode homeward across the country. They did not talk. They were all thinking. At last one said:  \"How shall we give this message to the king?\"  \"I have been thinking of that,\" Guthorm said; \"his anger is no little thing.\"  It was late when they rode into the king's yard; for they had ridden slowly, trying to make some plan for softening the message, but they had thought of none.  \"I see light through the wind's-eyes of the feast hall,\" one said.  \"Yes, the king keeps feast,\" Guthorm said. \"We must give our message before all his guests.\"  So they went in with very heavy hearts. There sat King Harald in the high seat. The benches on both sides were full of men. The tables had been taken out, and the mead-horns were going round.  \"Oh, ho!\" cried King Harald. \"Our messengers! What news?\"  Then Guthorm said:  \"This Gyda is a bold and saucy girl, King Harald. My tongue refuses to give her message.\"  The king stamped his foot.  \"Out with it!\" he cried. \"What does she say?\"  \"She says that she will not marry so little a king,\" Guthorm answered.  Harald jumped to his feet. His face flushed red. Guthorm stretched out his hand.  \"They are not my words, O King; they are the words of a silly girl.\"  \"Is there any more?\" the king shouted. \"Go on!\"  \"She said: 'There is one king in Denmark and one king in Sweden. Is there no man brave enough to make himself king of all Norway? Tell King Harald that I will not marry him unless he puts all of Norway under him for my sake.'\"  The guests sat speechless, staring at Guthorm. All at once the king broke into a roar of laughter.  \"By the hammer of Thor!\" he cried, \"that is a good message. I thank you, Gyda. Did you hear it, friends? King of all Norway! Why, we are all stupids. Why did we not think of that?\"  Then he raised his horn high.  \"Now hear my vow. I say that I will not cut my hair or comb it until I am king of all Norway. That I will be or I will die.\"  Then he drank off the horn of mead, and while he drank it, all the men in the hall stood up and waved their swords and shouted and shouted. That old hall in all its two hundred years of feasts had not heard such a noise before.  \"Ah, Harald!\" Guthorm cried, \"surely Thor in Valhalla smiled when he heard that vow.\"  The men sat all night talking of that wonderful vow.  On the very next day King Harald sent out his war-arrows. Soon a great army was gathered. They marched through the country north and south and east and west, burning houses and fighting battles as they went. People fled before them, some to their own kings, some inland to the deep woods and hid there. But some went to King Harald and said:  \"We will be your men.\"  \"Then take the oath, and I will be friends with you,\" he said.  The men took off their swords and laid them down and came one by one and knelt before the king. They put their heads between his knees and said:  \"From this day, Harald Halfdanson, I am your man. I will serve you in war. For my land I will pay you taxes. I will be faithful to you as my king.\"  Then Harald said:  \"I am your king, and I will be faithful to you.\"  Many kings took that oath and thousands of common men. Of all the battles that Harald fought, he did not lose one.  Now for a long time the king's hair and beard had not been combed or cut. They stood out around his head in a great bushy mat of yellow. At a feast one day when the jokes were going round, Harald's uncle said:  \"Harald, I will give you a new name. After this you shall be called Harald Shockhead. As my naming gift I give you this drinking-horn.\"  \"It is a good name,\" laughed all the men.  After that all people called him Harald Shockhead.  During these wars, whenever King Harald got a country for his own, this is what he did. He said:  \"All the marshland and the woodland where no people live is mine. For his farm every man shall pay me taxes.\"  Over every country he put some brave, wise man and called him Earl. He said to the earls:  \"You shall collect the taxes and pay them to me. But some you shall keep for yourselves. You shall punish any man who steals or murders or does any wicked thing. When your people are in trouble they shall come to you, and you shall set the thing right. You must keep peace in the land. I will not have my people troubled with robber vikings.\"  The earls did all these things as best they could; for they were good strong men. The farmers were happy. They said:  \"We can work on our farms with peace now. Before King Harald came, something was always wrong. The vikings would come and steal our gold and our grain and burn our houses, or the king would call us to war. Those little kings are always fighting. It is better under King Harald.\"  But the chiefs, who liked to fight and go a-viking, hated King Harald and his new ways. One of these chiefs was Solfi. He was a king's son. Harald had killed his father in battle. Solfi had been in that battle. At the end of it he fled away with two hundred men and got into ships.  \"We will make that Shockhead smart,\" he said.  So they harried the coast of King Harald's country. They filled their ships with gold. They ate other men's meals. They burned farmhouses behind them. The people cried out to the earls for help. So the earls had out their ships all the time trying to catch Solfi, but he was too clever for them.  In the spring he went to a certain king, Audbiorn, and said to him:  \"Now, there are two things that we can do. We can become this Shockhead Harald's thralls, we can kneel before him and put our heads between his knees. Or else we can fight. My father thought it better to die in battle than to be any man's thrall. How is it? Will you join with my cousin Arnvid and me against this young Shockhead?\"  \"Yes, I will do it,\" said the king.  [Decoration]   FOOTNOTES:  [8] See note about foster-father on page 197.     [Illustration]  The Sea Fight   Many men felt as Solfi did. So when King Audbiorn and King Arnvid sent out their war arrows, a great host gathered. All men came by sea. Two hundred ships lay at anchor in the fiord, looking like strange swimming animals because of their high carved prows and bright paint. There were red and gold dragons with long necks and curved tails. Sea-horses reared out of the water. Green and gold snakes coiled up. Sea-hawks sat with spread wings ready to fly. And among all these curved necks stood up the tall, straight masts with the long yardarms swinging across them holding the looped-up sails.  When the starting horn blew, and their sails were let down, it was like the spreading of hundreds of curious flags. Some were striped black and yellow or blue and gold. Some were white with a black raven or a brown bear embroidered on them, or blue with a white sea-hawk, or black with a gold sun. Some were edged with fur. As the wind filled the gaudy sails, and the ships moved off, the men waved their hands to the women on shore and sang:      \"To the sea! To the sea!     The wind in our sail,     The sea in our face,     And the smell of the fight.     After ship meets ship,     In the quarrel of swords     King Harald shall lie     In the caves under sea     And Norsemen shall laugh.\"  In the prow stood men leaning forward and sniffing the salt air with joy. Some were talking of King Harald.  \"Yesterday he had a hard fight,\" they said. \"To-day he will be lying still, dressing his wounds and mending his ships. We shall take him by surprise.\"  They sailed near the coast. Solfi in his \"Sea-hawk\""]]]
