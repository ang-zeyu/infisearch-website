He is very easy to get on with. Really, it seems like a dream when I think that we breakfast and walk out with _this_ greatest of all earthly Potentates as quietly as if we walked, etc., with Charles or any one. We took him, with the dear good King of Saxony,[14] who is a great contrast to the _Czar_ (and with whom I am _quite_ at my ease), to Adelaide Cottage after breakfast. The grass here is just as if it had been burned with fire. _How_ many different Princes have we not gone the same round with!! The children are much admired by the _Sovereigns_--(how _grand_ this sounds!)--and Alice allowed the Emperor to take her in his arms, and kissed him _de son propre accord_. We are always so thankful that they are _not_ shy. Both the Emperor and the King are _quite_ enchanted with Windsor. The Emperor said very _poliment_: \"C'est digne de vous, Madame.\" I must say the Waterloo Room lit up with that entire service of gold looks splendid; and the Reception Room, beautiful to sit in afterwards. The Emperor praised _my_ Angel very much, saying: \"C'est impossible de voir un plus joli garçon; il a l'air si noble et si bon\"; which I must say _is very_ true. The Emperor amused the King and me by saying he was so _embarrassé_ when people were presented to him, and that he felt so \"_gauche_\" _en frac_, which certainly he is quite _unaccustomed_ to wear. If we can do anything to get him to do what is right by you, we shall be most happy, and Peel and Aberdeen are very anxious for it. I believe he leaves on Sunday again. To-morrow there is to be a great review, and on Thursday _I_ shall probably go with them to the races; _they_ are gone there with Albert to-day, but I have remained at home.  I think it is time to conclude my long letter.  If the French are angry at this visit, let their dear King and their Princes come; _they_ will be sure of a _truly affectionate_ reception on our part. The one which Emperor Nicholas has received is cordial and civil, _mais ne vient pas du c[oe]ur_.  I humbly beg that any remarks which may _not_ be favourable to our great visitor may _not_ go _beyond_ you and Louise, and _not_ to _Paris_. Ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 13: The Emperor Nicholas of Russia had just arrived     on a visit to England.]      [Footnote 14: Frederick Augustus II.]     [Pageheading: THE REVIEW]  [Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S IMPRESSIONS]  [Pageheading: THE CZAR NICHOLAS]   _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._  Buckingham Palace, _11th June 1844._  MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your very kind and long letter of the 7th on Sunday, and thank you very much for it. I am delighted that my accounts interested you, and I shall try and give you some more to-day, which you will see come from an unbiassed and impartial mind, and which I trust therefore _will_ be relied upon. The excitement has ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and I am still confused about it. I will go back to where I last left you. The _Revue_[15] on the 5th was really very interesting, and our reception as well as that of the Emperor _most_ enthusiastic. Louise tells me you had a review the same day, and that it also was so hot. Our children were there, and charmed. On the 6th we went with the Emperor and King to the races,[16] and I never saw such a crowd; again _here_ the reception was _most brilliant_. Every evening a large dinner in the Waterloo Room, and the two last evenings in uniforms, as the Emperor disliked so being _en frac_, and was quite embarrassed in it. On the 7th we took him and the King back here, and in the evening had a party of 260 about. On Saturday (8th) my Angel took the Emperor and King to a very elegant breakfast[17] at Chiswick, which I for prudence' sake did _not_ go to, but was very sorry for it. In the evening we went to the Opera (_not_ in State), but they recognised us, and we were most brilliantly received. I had to force the Emperor forward, as he never would come forward when I was there, and I was obliged to take him by the hand and make him appear; it was impossible to be better bred or more respectful than he was towards me. Well, on Sunday afternoon at five, he left us (my Angel accompanied him to Woolwich), and he was much affected at going, and really unaffectedly touched at his reception and stay, the simplicity and quietness of which told upon his love of domestic life, which is very great. I will now (having told _all_ that has passed) give you _my_ opinion and feelings on the subject, which I may say are Albert's also. I was extremely against the visit, fearing the _gêne_, and bustle, and even at first, I did not feel at _all_ to like it, but by living in the same house together quietly and unrestrainedly (and this Albert, and with great truth, says is the great advantage of these visits, that I not only _see_ these great people but _know_ them), I got to know the Emperor and he to know me. There is much about him which I cannot help liking, and I think his character is _one_ which should be understood, and looked upon for _once_ as it is. He is stern and severe--with fixed principles of _duty_ which _nothing_ on earth will make him change; very _clever_ I do _not_ think him, and his mind is an uncivilised one; his education has been neglected; politics and military concerns are the only things he takes great interest in; the arts and all softer occupations he is insensible to, but he is sincere, I am certain, _sincere_ even in his most despotic acts, from a sense that that _is_ the _only_ way to govern; he is not, I am sure, aware of the dreadful cases of individual misery which he so often causes, for I can see by various instances that he is kept in utter ignorance of _many_ things, which his people carry out in most corrupt ways, while he thinks that he is extremely just. He thinks of general measures, but does not look into detail. And I am sure _much_ never reaches his ears, and (as you observed), how can it? He asked for _nothing_ whatever, has merely expressed his great anxiety to be upon the best terms with us, but _not_ to the _exclusion of others_, only let things remain as they are.... He is I should say, too frank, for he talks so openly before people, which he should not do, and with difficulty restrains himself. His anxiety _to be believed_ is _very_ great, and I must say his personal promises I _am inclined_ to believe; then his feelings are very strong; he _feels_ kindness deeply--and his love for his wife and children, and for all children, is _very_ great. He has a strong feeling for domestic life, saying to me, when our children were in the room: \"Voilà les doux moments de notre vie.\" He was not only civil, but extremely kind _to us both_, and spoke in the highest praise of dearest Albert to Sir Robert Peel, saying he wished any Prince in Germany had that ability and sense; he showed Albert great confidence, and I _think_ it will do great good, as if _he_ praises him abroad it will have great weight. He is _not_ happy, and that melancholy which is visible in the countenance made me sad at times; the sternness of the eyes goes very much off when you know him, and changes according to his being put out (and he _can_ be much embarrassed) or not, and also from his being heated, as he suffers with congestions to the head. My Angel thinks that he is a man inclined too much to give way to impulse and feeling, which makes him act wrongly often. His admiration for beauty is very great, and put me much in mind of you, when he drove out with us, looking out for pretty people. But he remains very faithful to those he admired _twenty-eight_ years ago; for instance, Lady Peel, who has hardly any remains left. Respecting Belgium he did not speak to _me_, but to Albert and the Ministers. As for unkindly feeling towards _you_, he disclaims positively any, saying he knew you well, and that you had served in the Russian Army, etc., but he says those _unfortunate_ Poles are the _only_ obstacle, and that he positively cannot enter into direct communication _with Belgium_ as long as they are _employed_. If you could only somehow or other get rid of them, I am sure the thing would be done at once. We all think he _need_ not mind this, but I fear he has pledged himself. He admired Charlotte's picture. _Pour finir_, I must say one more word or two about his personal appearance. He puts us much in mind of his and our cousins the Würtembergs, and has altogether much of the Würtemberg family about him. He is bald now, but in his Chevalier Garde Uniform he is _magnificent_ still, and very _striking_. I cannot deny that we were in great anxiety when we took him out lest some Pole might make an attempt, and I always felt thankful when we got him safe home again. His poor daughter is very ill, I fear. The good King of Saxony[18] remains another week with us, and we like him much. He is so unassuming. He is out sight-seeing _all_ day, and enchanted with everything. I hope that you will persuade the King to come all the same in September. Our _motives_ and politics are _not_ to be exclusive, but to be on good terms with _all_, and why should we not? We make no secret of it.  Now I must end this very long letter. Ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.  You will kindly not _speak_ of these details, but only in _allgemein_ say the visit went off very satisfactorily on _both sides_, and that it was _highly pacific_.

I can write to you with a light heart, thank goodness, to-day, for the Government obtained a majority, which _up_ to the _last_ moment last night we feared they would not have, and we have been in sad trouble for the last four or five days about it.[19] It is the more marvellous, as, if the Government asked for a _Vote_ of Confidence, they would have a _Majority_ of 100; but this very strength makes the supporters of the Government act in a _most_ unjustifiable manner by continually acting and voting against them, _not_ listening to the debates, but coming down and voting against the Government. So that we were really in the greatest _possible_ danger of having a resignation of the Government _without knowing to whom to turn_, and this from the recklessness of a handful of foolish _half_ \"Puseyite\" half \"Young England\"[20] people! I am sure you will agree with me that Peel's resignation would not only be for us (for _we cannot_ have a better and a _safer_ Minister), but for the whole country, and for the peace of Europe--a _great calamity_. Our present people are all _safe_, and not led away by impulses and reckless passions. We must, however, take care and not get into another crisis; for I assure you we have been quite miserable and _quite_ alarmed ever since Saturday.  Since I last wrote to you, I spoke to Aberdeen (whom I should be equally sorry to lose, as he is so _very fair_, and has served _us personally_, so kindly and truly), and he told me that the Emperor has _positively pledged_ himself to send a Minister to Brussels the moment those Poles are no longer employed;[21] that he is quite aware of the importance of the measure, and would be disposed to make the arrangement easy, and that he spoke very kindly of _you_ personally. Aberdeen says it is not necessary to disgrace them in any way, but only for the present _de les éloigner_. The Emperor has evidently some time ago made some strong declaration on the subject which he feels he cannot get over, and, as I said before, he will not give up what he has once pledged his word to. _Then, no one_ on earth _can_ move him. _Au fond_, it is a fine _trait_, but he carries it too far. He wrote me a _very_ kind and affectionate letter from the Hague. The Emperor has given Bertie the Grand Cross of St Andrew, which the boy was quite proud of.  Our kind and good King of Saxony leaves us to-morrow, after having seen more than anybody has done almost, and having enjoyed it of all things. He is quite at home with us and the children, whom he plays with much. Alice walks quite alone, and looks too funny, as she is so _very_ fat. Now, ever your devoted Niece,  VICTORIA R.      [Footnote 19: The Ministry had been defeated on Mr P. Miles's     motion in favour of giving an increased preference to colonial     sugar, but on the 17th this vote was rescinded by a majority     of twenty-two, Mr Disraeli taunting the Premier with expecting     that \"upon every division and at every crisis, his gang should     appear, and the whip should sound.\"]      [Footnote 20: The name given to the group comprising Disraeli,     George Smythe, Lord John Manners, etc. See _Coningsby_, which     was published about this time.]      [Footnote 21: See _ante_, p. 15.]     _Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria._  SOUTH STREET, _19th June 1844._  Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks your Majesty much for the letter of the 14th inst. Lord Melbourne was very glad to have the opportunity of seeing the Emperor of Russia at Chiswick. Lord Melbourne humbly believes that the opinion, which your Majesty has formed and expresses of the Emperor's character is just, and he considers it extremely fortunate that a sovereign of such weight and influence in Europe, and with whom it is probable that Great Britain will have such near and intimate relations, should also be a man upon whose honour and veracity strong reliance may be safely and securely placed.  Lord Melbourne is very glad to believe that the late political movements, with which the public mind has been agitated, have subsided, and are entirely terminated by the last vote of the House of Commons, and by the determination evinced to support the Administration.[22]  This finishes for the present a business which at one moment seemed likely to be troublesome, and out of which there did not appear to present itself any hope or practicable escape.  Lord Melbourne will not make any observation upon what is known and understood to have passed, further than to say that, as far as he is acquainted with the history of public affairs in this country, it is an entire novelty, quite new and unprecedented.[23] Many a Minister has said to the Crown, \"My advice must be taken, and my measures must be adopted,\" but no Minister has ever yet held this language or advanced this pretension to either House of Parliament. However, it seems to be successful at present, and success will justify much. Whether it will tend to permanent strength or a steady conduct of public affairs, remains to be seen.  Lord Melbourne begs to be respectfully remembered to His Royal Highness.

By Lord Ellenborough's advice, letters were immediately despatched by express to every important native Court to assure the native Princes that this change in the person at the head of the Government would effect no change in its policy, and Lord Ellenborough himself wrote in similar terms to the British Representatives at the several Courts.... Lord Ellenborough has written a letter to the Earl of Ripon with reference to the reasons alleged by the Court of Directors for his removal from office, to which letter he most humbly solicits your Majesty's favourable and attentive consideration. It treats of matters deeply affecting the good government of India.  Amidst all the difficulties with which he has had to contend in India, aggravated as they have been by the constant hostility of the Court of Directors, Lord Ellenborough has ever been sustained by the knowledge that he was serving a most gracious Mistress, who would place the most favourable construction upon his conduct, and he now humbly tenders to your Majesty the expression of his gratitude, not only for those marks of Royal favour with which it has been intimated to him that it is your Majesty's intention to reward his services, but yet more for that constant support which has animated all his exertions, and has mainly enabled him to place India in the hands of his successor in a state of universal peace, the result of two years of victories, and in a condition of prosperity heretofore unknown.     [Pageheading: ENGLAND, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA]   _The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria._  LAEKEN, _28th June 1844._  MY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I have again to offer my warmest and best thanks for a very long and kind letter. I am truly and sincerely happy that a Ministerial crisis has been spared you; it is in all constitutional concerns an _awful_ business; but in such a colossal machinery as the British Empire, it shakes the whole globe. For your sake, for the good of England, and for the quiet of the whole earth, we must most devoutly pray that _Sir Robert may remain for many, many years your trusty and faithful Minister._ Parliaments and Chambers are extremely fond of governing, particularly as long as it does not bore themselves. We have had an instance of it recently. I was anxious to keep the Chamber longer, as there are still many important things which it ought to have finished; but they were hot, they got tired, voted twelve _projets de loi_ in one day, and disappeared afterwards, leaving one the trouble of managing the affairs of the State as best one may....  As a general political event, the Emperor's visit in England can only be useful; it is probable that he would _not_ have made the visit if another had not been talked of. His policy is naturally to _separate_ as much as possible the two great Western Powers; he is too weak to resist single-handed their dictates in the Oriental question; _but if they act not in concert_, it is evident that _he is the master_; in all this he acts wisely and in conformity with the great interests of his Empire. England has greater interests at stake at the mercy of Russia than at that of France. With France the questions are sometimes questions of jealousy, but, on the other hand, a tolerable understanding keeps France quiet and secures the peace of Europe, much more in the sense of the European policy of England than of that of France. The only consolation the French can find in it is that they are aware that _together_ with England they have a great position, but they always lament that they can _get nothing by it_. A bad understanding with France opens not only the door to a European war, but also to revolution; and that is perhaps the most serious and most awfully dangerous part of the business. England wants nothing from the Emperor than that he should leave the _status quo_ of Europe and great part of Asia alone. At Paris they are not so much moved at the Emperor's visit as perhaps they ought to be, but they have put the flattering notion into their heads that he had made _fiasco_, which is _not true_; as, in fact, he has so far been rather _successful_, and has convinced people in England that he is a mild and good-natured man, himself and his Empire, without any ambition. Now it is high time I should finish my"]]]
