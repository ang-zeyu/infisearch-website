I never knew half-grown pigs to have such loud voices. Their grunts certainly are full-sized.\"  Jolly Robin, who had perched himself beside his wife, looked down at their new neighbors.  \"They're having a good time,\" he observed cheerfully. \"We ought not to complain. We may be thankful that they don't climb trees and try to sing.\"  Jolly Robin had a way of looking on the bright side of things. It was seldom that he couldn't act cheerful. Even when he felt quite downhearted, _inside_, he managed usually to appear happy, _outside_. And now his remark put his wife in a pleasanter frame of mind.  \"Imagine a pig up a tree!\" Mrs. Robin tittered.  \"Umph! Umph! Are you talking about me?\" a voice inquired right beneath them. It gave Mrs. Robin such a start that she almost tumbled off the limb.  \"No! No! We're not talking about you--not exactly!\" Jolly Robin answered.  It was Grunty Pig that had spoken.  \"Pardon me!\" he said. \"I thought I heard you mention the name, 'Pig'.\"  \"Er--yes! We did speak of your family, in a general way,\" Jolly Robin admitted.  \"Ah!\" said Grunty Pig. \"And what was it you said about us? Weren't you and your wife laughing about our climbing trees?\"  Somehow Jolly Robin thought that Grunty's little eyes had a spiteful gleam as he looked upward into the tree top. And Mrs. Robin couldn't help moving to a higher limb. Grunty's glare sent a most uncomfortable shiver over her.  Jolly Robin tried his best to act at his ease.  \"It was just an odd thought that popped into my head,\" he assured Grunty Pig. \"It made Mrs. Robin giggle when I mentioned it.\" He laughed merrily enough. And his wife managed to smile faintly. But Grunty Pig frowned.  \"I thought so!\" he cried. \"You Robins were poking fun at me and my brothers and sisters. Yes! And no doubt at my mother, too!\"  \"Oh, no!\" Jolly Robin assured him. \"We weren't thinking of any one in particular.\"  \"Aha!\" Grunty snorted. \"You were laughing at all of us, then.\" And Jolly Robin could say nothing to change his opinion. \"You can't fool me,\" Grunty declared. \"You have insulted my whole family. And it's time that you learned better manners. I see that I shall have to teach you a lesson.\"  Well, when they heard that speech Jolly Robin and his wife had to laugh. The idea of a lesson in manners from Grunty Pig was the funniest thing on the farm.  [Illustration: \"Always Mind Your Mother,\" Said Mrs. Pig.  (_Page 57_)]     XV  GRUNTY MEANS MISCHIEF   Jolly Robin and his wife told all their friends that Grunty Pig was going to teach them a lesson. The birds had many a laugh over the matter. Not till old Mr. Crow visited the orchard one day did the Robin family cease chuckling over what they called \"the joke of the season.\"  \"Don't laugh too soon!\" Mr. Crow croaked. \"This Grunty Pig means mischief. He isn't going to teach you the sort of lesson you've been snickering about. What he intends to do is to harm you in some way.\"  Now, nobody in Pleasant Valley could look gloomier than old Mr. Crow. And when he hinted darkly, in his hoarse way, that there was trouble ahead for the Robin family, he threw Jolly Robin's wife into a flutter.  \"Oh, what does Grunty Pig mean to do to us?\" Mrs. Robin quavered.  \"I'd rather not tell you,\" said old Mr. Crow. \"I don't want you to worry.\"  Mr. Crow left them then. Of course he couldn't have chosen a better way to upset Mrs. Robin. Even Jolly himself had to admit after a while that he could think of nothing that seemed to cheer his wife in the least. \"I'll speak to Mr. Crow again,\" he told his wife. \"I'll ask him just what he meant.\"  Alas! Mr. Crow couldn't tell him. The truth was that Mr. Crow had already told all he knew.  \"I'll ask Grunty Pig himself what he means to do to us,\" Jolly then declared to his wife. \"I've noticed that he digs every day at the foot of our apple tree. The next time he comes here I'll have a talk with him.\" So that very day Jolly put his question to Grunty Pig.  \"What is it,\" he asked, \"that you intend to do to us?\"  \"You'll find out later,\" said Grunty Pig. \"I expect to be in the top of your apple tree before fall. And then--\"  Jolly Robin couldn't wait for him to finish. He had to laugh right out, on the spot. And his wife, who had been listening eagerly, burst into the first giggle that had passed her bill for days and days.  So Grunty Pig expected to climb a tree! Mr. and Mrs. Robin gave each other a merry look. It was all too funny for words.  \"Umph!\" said Grunty Pig. \"You won't laugh when I'm in your tree top.\"  \"How are you going to get up here?\" Jolly Robin asked him, with a wink at Mrs. Robin. \"Are you going to _fly_?\"  \"No!\" Grunty Pig said. \"No!\"  \"Then you're going to _climb_,\" cried Mrs. Robin. And both she and her husband choked, as they pictured fat Grunty Pig scrambling up the trunk of the old apple tree.  \"No!\" Grunty Pig said. \"No!\"  \"Well, well!\" Jolly Robin exclaimed. \"Don't be so short with your answers! Explain how you expect to get up into the top of our apple tree.\"  \"I never said I expected to get up there,\" Grunty Pig corrected him.  \"What?\" cried Jolly Robin. \"What?\" cried his wife.  \"No!\" said Grunty Pig. \"I said I'd be in the tree top before fall. If I work here every day around the foot of the tree I'll have it uprooted at last. And when it topples over and falls on the ground I'll have no trouble getting into the top of it.\"  When they heard that, Jolly Robin and his wife stopped laughing.     XVI  DANGER AHEAD   Jolly Robin and his wife were terribly worried. Grunty Pig meant to uproot the apple tree where they had their nest. Every day he came and dug at the foot of the tree. Every day, just before he went away, he looked up at them and said, \"I hope you'll sleep well to-night. You'd better enjoy your home while you have it, for the tree will be flat on the ground before fall.\"  Sleep! Mrs. Robin complained that she never had a good night's rest any more. She said that she had bad dreams. She dreamed that the tree was falling. And then she was sure to wake up with a start. And her husband wasn't there to calm her, because he was roosting in a thicket over in the pasture with their first brood of the season.  They both agreed--Jolly and his wife--that they must get their second brood of children out of the nest as soon as they could.  \"The moment they're old enough, we must teach them to fly,\" Mrs. Robin told her husband.  \"Yes!\" he said. \"And we'll have to be careful of them, too, with all these seven young porkers in the orchard.\"  \"Suppose--\" said Mrs. Robin--\"suppose Grunty Pig should bring our tree toppling to the ground before the children leave the nest!\"  \"Oh! There's no danger of that,\" Jolly assured her. She was always looking on the dark side of things. But he didn't tell her so.  \"I don't know how we're going to be sure the children are safe,\" Mrs. Robin continued. \"How long do you think it will take Grunty Pig to uproot our tree?\"  Jolly Robin had to confess that he couldn't answer his wife's question.  \"Then ask somebody who knows something about such matters!\" Mrs. Robin cried. And there was a tart note in her voice that made Jolly Robin say hastily, \"Yes! Yes, my dear! I'll go right now and find an answer to your question.\"  Off he flew. And not knowing where else to go, he sat down on a bush in Farmer Green's garden, to ponder. Who could tell him how long it would take Grunty Pig to uproot the old apple tree? Although Jolly Robin thought and thought, he could think of no one whom he might ask. To be sure, there was Tommy Fox, who was known to be an able digger. But Jolly Robin didn't trust him. Tommy Fox was tricky. And there was Billy Woodchuck, who came from a famous family of burrowers. But everybody knew that old dog Spot had chased him into his hole that very afternoon, and was watching Billy's front door.  While Jolly Robin sat there in the garden he happened to look down at the ground. And right before his eyes a long snout suddenly rose out of the dirt, followed by the squat form of Grandfather Mole.  Jolly Robin gave a cheerful chirp. Everybody knew that Grandfather Mole was the champion digger of Pleasant Valley. And if he couldn't answer Mrs. Robin's question, then no one could.     XVII  A PUZZLE SOLVED   \"Good morning, Grandfather Mole!\" Jolly Robin called.  \"What!\" cried Grandfather Mole. \"Have I made the mistake again of coming up on top of Farmer Green's garden?\"  \"You certainly have,\" Jolly told him.  \"I must be getting old,\" said Grandfather Mole. \"I'm growing more careless every day. I didn't mean to dig my way above ground.\" And then, thrusting his long nose right into the dirt, he began to burrow out of sight.  \"Stop! Please stop!\" Jolly Robin besought him. \"I want to ask you a question about digging.\"  Grandfather Mole pulled his nose out of the ground.  \"What's your question?\" he inquired.  \"It's about Grunty Pig,\" Jolly Robin began.  \"I thought you said it was about digging,\" Grandfather Mole grumbled. And he started to burrow once more.  \"So it is!\" Jolly exclaimed. \"I want to know how long it will take Grunty Pig to dig up the apple tree where I live.\"  Again Grandfather Mole paused.  \"It all depends,\" he muttered. \"It all depends on how much of his time he spends at digging.\"  \"He works every day,\" said Jolly Robin. \"A good, long while every day!\"  Grandfather Mole appeared to be thinking deeply.  \"He boasts--\" Jolly Robin explained--\"he boasts that he will have the tree uprooted before fall.\"  \"Nonsense!\" Grandfather Mole snorted. \"If Grunty Pig says that, he doesn't know much about apple trees. He may be a fair digger; but he must be stupid.\"  \"That's what I've always thought!\" Jolly Robin exclaimed.  \"He can't go very deep into things, or he'd never have made such a boast,\" Grandfather Mole declared. \"When Grunty Pig digs, does he dig right down out of sight?\"  \"Oh, no! Never!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24731"],["title","The Tale of Grunty Pig (#5)"],["body"," Jolly Robin.  \"Ah! He merely scratches the surface!\" Grandfather Mole remarked with a wise nod of his head. \"Well, it's no wonder that he made such a mistake.\"  \"Mistake!\" Jolly Robin echoed. \"Do you mean that Grunty Pig won't have our apple tree down by fall?\"  \"I do,\" Grandfather Mole answered. \"The roots of a big, old apple tree spread out a good rod in every direction. And it would take a hundred Grunty Pigs a whole summer to dig them free.\"  A broad smile spread over Jolly Robin's face.  \"Then--\" he ventured--\"then wouldn't it take Grunty Pig a hundred summers to dig up our tree, if he worked alone?\"  \"No doubt!\" Grandfather replied. \"Or, to be on the safe side, I'll say he could uproot your tree in ninety-nine summers.\"  \"Hurrah!\" Jolly Robin shouted. \"Hurrah--and thank you, Grandfather Mole!\" And leaving the old gentleman to dig himself out of sight, Jolly Robin hurried home to his wife.  Mrs. Robin was glad to see him. She knew, as soon as she caught a glimpse of his face, that he had good news for her. And she needed cheering, poor soul! For Grunty Pig was beneath the tree again, digging away in a most businesslike fashion.  \"Let him dig!\" Jolly Robin whispered to his wife. \"Grandfather Mole says it will take him ninety-nine summers to topple our tree over. And you know that Grandfather Mole is the greatest burrower in Pleasant Valley.\"  Mrs. Robin felt better at once. Looking down at Grunty Pig, she said to her husband, \"How stupid this son of Mrs. Pig's is! He has turned up at least a dozen angleworms while you've been gone. And he has let every one of them get away from him!\"     XVIII  THE LUCKIEST OF ALL   Grunty Pig found that being the smallest of the family wasn't all fun. Not only could his brothers and sisters crowd him at the feeding trough. Even when they were playing in the pen they often knocked him down and walked right over him. And if he objected--as he usually did--they were sure to laugh and call him \"Runt.\"  Try as she would, Mrs. Pig couldn't rid her children of these boorish ways. But she shouldn't be blamed for that. It must be remembered that she had seven youngsters, all of the same age.  At least, Mrs. Pig did what she could to make Grunty's lot easier.  \"Don't feel unhappy!\" she said to him one day as he picked himself up, whimpering, after a hard knock. \"Don't feel unhappy because you are the littlest of the family. In one way you are the luckiest of all my children.\"  Grunty Pig didn't stop weeping. He saw no reason--yet--to feel more cheerful.  \"Did you know--\" his mother asked him--\"did you know that in one respect you are the handsomest one of the whole litter? You have the curliest tail of them all!\"  Grunty Pig gazed, open-mouthed, at his mother. He stopped snivelling. Up to that time he had scarcely given his tail a thought. So long as it followed him wherever he went he had been satisfied with it.  [Illustration: Grunty Pig Stuck Fast in the Fence.  (_Page 86_)]  From that moment Grunty began to think a great deal about his tail. He was always turning his head to look at it, to make sure it hadn't lost any of its kink. Now and then he was even late for a meal, because he was feasting his eyes on his tail when Farmer Green came to the pen with food for Mrs. Pig's family.  It must be confessed that Grunty sometimes boasted before his brothers and sisters about his beautiful curly tail. And just before meal time his brother Blackie was known, upon occasion, to mention the subject of tails. He did that in the hope that Grunty would be late at the feeding trough.  Sad to say, Grunty Pig was fast becoming vain. He even talked about tails with the neighbors, taking pains to explain that his own was the handsomest one on the farm.  Old dog Spot sniffed when Grunty boasted about his tail one day.  \"Why, your tail is of no use whatsoever,\" Spot told him. \"You can't use it to switch a fly off your back. The Muley Cow can do that. And so can the old horse, Ebenezer.\"  \"Ah! But my tail is so pretty to look at!\" Grunty Pig exclaimed.  \"You can't puff it up to show you're angry, as Miss Kitty Cat does,\" said Spot.  \"Ah! But my tail has a beautiful curl!\" said Grunty Pig.  \"You can't wag it, to let folks know you're friendly, as I can,\" said Spot.  \"Ah! But my tail is _so_ handsome!\" Grunty Pig exclaimed.     XIX  DOG SPOT'S PLAN   When Grunty Pig insisted that his own tightly curled tail was the most beautiful one in the neighborhood, old dog Spot yawned.  \"If that's the case,\" he remarked, \"I should think you'd want your tail where you could see it more easily. Don't you find it a nuisance to have to turn your head around every time you want to look at your tail?\"  Grunty Pig admitted that his tail wasn't in the most convenient place in the world.  \"If Farmer Green should cut off your tail and nail it up on the outside of the barn,\" old Spot suggested, \"you could look at it easily enough. And it would give others a better chance to see it, too. Even the people that drive along the road could enjoy it. Everybody spoke about the tall corn that we nailed to the barn last fall. And I'm sure that folks would admire your tail.\"  When Spot spoke of Farmer Green's cutting off his tail, Grunty Pig winced. But as the old dog talked on and on Grunty forgot the painful part of the plan.  \"There's no doubt,\" he agreed, \"that my tail would be a fine sight, fastened up on the barn where everybody could gaze at it. But don't you think, Mr. Spot, that I'd look very queer without any tail?\"  \"N--no!\" Spot told him. \"N--no! I've seen plenty of pigs without tails. They didn't look queer at all. Really, they looked better without tails than they would have looked with them.\"  Grunty Pig had listened carefully to what Spot said. Yet somehow he couldn't quite make up his mind to part with his beautiful tail, even if it would delight many more people when nailed to the outside of the barn.  \"I'd like to see one of those pigs,\" he said to Spot. \"I'd like to see how they look.\"  \"That's easily arranged,\" old Spot told him. \"I can show you a dozen of them--all as pink and white and happy as they can be. And not a single one of them with a tail!\"  \"I'd certainly like to see them,\" Grunty Pig murmured.  \"They're a pretty sight,\" Spot assured him. \"Don't you think you'd feel uncomfortable if you appeared before them with a tail? Don't you want to have yours cut off _before_ you go to see these tailless little fellows? It seems to me you'd be more at your ease. It would certainly be _polite_ of you.\"  Grunty Pig, however, cared little for politeness. He said that nobody was polite to him. His brothers--and even his sisters--were always knocking him down and trampling on him.  \"Very well!\" said Spot. \"Squirm through that fence and follow me.\"  It was a tight squeeze. When Grunty Pig was half through the hole in the fence he found himself stuck fast. He could move neither forward nor back. \"Oh, dear!\" he wailed. \"What shall I do?\"  \"Keep perfectly still!\" old dog Spot cautioned him--as if Grunty Pig could do anything else. \"I'll jump the fence and help you.\"  Now, Grunty Pig thought that old Spot intended to give him a push. Instead, Spot nipped him smartly.  It was exactly the sort of help that Grunty needed. He gave a frantic plunge forward and fell, sprawling, on the ground outside the yard, where Spot soon joined him.  \"It takes old Spot to hurry 'em along,\" said the old dog gleefully.  Grunty Pig said \"Umph! Umph!\"  Old dog Spot was not quite sure what he meant.     XX  A NEW KIND OF PIG   \"Stop grunting and squealing and follow me!\" old dog Spot growled. And Grunty Pig, who had just tumbled through a hole in the fence, scrambled to his feet and trotted after his guide.  Old Spot had promised to show Grunty a dozen pink and white pigs, all without tails. He wanted Grunty to see how handsome they looked.  \"You'll like them,\" Spot told Grunty over his shoulder as they jogged across the farmyard. \"You'll ask Farmer Green this very day to cut off your tail and nail it up on the barn. I tell you, these pigs look _neat_. There's _style_ about them.\"  \"Umph! Umph!\" said Grunty Pig as he shuffled along behind.  \"Now, I wonder what he meant by that!\" Spot mused. It was sometimes hard to tell whether Grunty's _umphs_ stood for _yes_ or _no_.  Around the corner of the farmhouse, near the woodshed door, old dog Spot came to a halt before a two-storied cage, the front of which was covered with fine-meshed wire netting.  Stopping beside Spot, Grunty Pig peered inside the cage. He saw a number of odd little creatures running about upon the sawdust-strewn floor of the tiny house, one or another of them giving a faint squeak now and then as if ordering the two unasked callers to move on.  Whoever they were, they were a bright-eyed little family. But Grunty Pig thought, as he stared at them, that they had a most peculiar look. There seemed to be something missing about them. Yet he couldn't tell just what it was.  Together Grunty and Spot stood there, silent, for a time; until at last Grunty said, \"Come along! Let's not stay here any longer. I want to see those twelve pigs without tails.\"  Old dog Spot snorted.  \"You _want_ to see them!\" he cried. \"Well, nobody's stopping you. They're right here in front of you!\"  Grunty Pig's mouth fell open--he was so astonished. He knew, now, what made the little, pudgy, white strangers look so queer. There wasn't one of them that had even a hint of a tail!  Then all at once Grunty turned angrily upon old dog Spot.  \"These aren't pigs!\" he squealed. \"You needn't think you can fool me. They're not pigs at all.\"  \"Oh, yes--they are!\" Spot insisted. \"You didn't suppose that all the pigs in the world were exactly like your family--did you?\"  Grunty didn't know what to say. He looked at the odd little creatures again. And then he looked at Spot once more.  \"If these really are pigs,\" he faltered, \"they must be very, very young. They're certainly smaller than any day-old pigs I ever saw...."]]]
