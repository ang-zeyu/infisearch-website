When they were all seated, he commenced as follows:--  \"I told you yesterday, that air may be compressed by force, while water cannot be. It has another property, which is in some respects the reverse of this. It springs back into its original bulk, when the pressure is removed.\"  \"How?\" said Nathan; \"I don't exactly understand you.\"  \"Why, you remember what I said about the experiment with the iron cylinder and a piston to fit it.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo.  \"What was the experiment?\" said his father.  \"Why, if a man were to press the piston down hard, he could crowd the air all into the lower half of the cylinder.\"  \"Yes,\" replied his father. \"Now, the property I am going to tell you about this evening is this--that, if the man lets go of the piston rod, the air that is condensed into the bottom of the cylinder, will spring up, and force the piston up again. This property is called _elasticity_. It is sometimes called the _expansive force_ of the air. For it is a force tending to expand the air, that is, to swell it out into its original dimensions. This is another great difference between air and water.  \"Now, as all the air around us,\" continued Rollo's father, \"is pressed down very heavily, and is condensed a great deal, it is all the time endeavoring to expand; and it would expand, were it not that the great burden of the air above it keeps it condensed. But water is not compressed, and has no tendency to expand. The water of Rollo's dam, for instance, had all the weight of the atmosphere resting upon it, but it did not compress it at all, and so it did not tend to expand.  \"And now,\" said his father, \"I cannot perform any experiment, to show you that air tends strongly to expand or swell out into a great space, while water does not; but I can make a supposition, which will illustrate it. Suppose we had a large, but very thin, glass bottle, filled with water, and put down upon the floor in the middle of this room. Suppose, also, that we had another bottle, of the same size and shape, filled with air, and we put that down upon the floor by the side of the other; both bottles being stopped very tight. Now, if we could by any means suddenly take away all the air from the room, so that there should be nothing around the bottles, then the bottle of water would remain just as it is, for the glass would have nothing to support but the weight of the water, and it would be strong enough for that. But the bottle of air would fly all to pieces; for that would not rest quietly, like the water, satisfied with the space which it already has, and only pressing with its own weight upon the sides of the glass; but it would immediately expand with so much force as to break the thin glass all to pieces.\"  \"Would it!\" exclaimed Rollo and Nathan together. \"And would it make a loud noise?\"  \"Yes,\" replied their father, \"I presume it would make a loud explosion; that is, if the air in the room around it could by any means be all at once and suddenly removed.  \"And so you must remember,\" he continued, \"that there are two very remarkable differences between air and water. Air may be condensed by pressure, and, as it exists all around us, is greatly condensed by the pressure of the air above, and it may be compressed more. And air is expansive, while water is not. Whenever the pressure upon it is removed, it suddenly expands, or spreads out in all directions.\"  \"O dear me!\" said Nathan, with a sigh.  \"What is the matter?\" said his father.  \"Why, I can't understand it very well.\"  \"Can't you?\" said his father. \"Well, I must admit that you are rather too young to study pneumatics.\"  \"Pneumatics?\" repeated Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said his father; \"that is the name of this science.\"  [Illustration: \"Then it sailed slowly away.\"--Page 85.]  \"What, the science of air?\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said his father, \"the science which treats of air, and of all other compressible and expansive fluids. But let me think. I must try to tell you something which Nathan can understand and be interested in. If I had a very light feather, I could let him perform an experiment.\"  \"Would a little down do?\" said Rollo's mother.  \"Yes,\" replied his father, \"that would be better than a feather.\"  Mrs. Holiday then went and brought a little down, and handed it to Rollo's father. Now, there was a lamp upon the table, of a peculiar kind, called a study lamp. It had a glass tube, called a chimney, around the wick, and consequently around the flame itself, being round, like a ring.  Rollo's father told Nathan to hold the down over the top of this glass chimney, and then to let it go.  Nathan did so. The little tuft of down was wafted up into the air, quite high above the lamp, and then it sailed slowly away, and fell down upon the table.  \"I know what makes it rise,\" said Rollo. \"It is the heat. The heat makes it rise.\"  \"Do you think so?\" said his father. \"Then take the down, and lay it gently upon the hearth, before the fire, as near as you can.\"  Rollo did so. He had to take his hand away very quick, for it was quite hot there. The little tuft remained quietly upon the hearth where he placed it.  \"There,\" said his father, \"is not that a hotter place than it was over the lamp?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo.  \"Then, if it was heat that made it rise, why does not it rise now?\"  Rollo could not tell.  \"I will tell you how it was,\" said his father. \"Heat makes air more expansive. When air is heated, it swells; when it is cool, it shrinks again. Now, if it swells, it becomes lighter, and so it is buoyed up by the heavier air around it; just as wood at the bottom of the sea would be buoyed up, and would rise to the surface of the water. Now, the heat of the lamp heats the air that is in the glass chimney, and swells it. This makes it lighter; and so the air around it, which is heavier, buoys it up, and it carries up the feather with it.\"  \"No, the down, father,\" said Nathan.  \"Yes, the down,\" said his father.  \"Then it seems to me, after all,\" said Rollo, \"that it is the heat which makes it rise.\"  \"Yes,\" said his father, \"it does, indirectly. It expands the air; that makes it lighter; then the heavy air around it buoys it up, and, when it goes up, it carries up the down. So that it is not strictly correct to say, that the heat carries it up. The heat sets in operation a train of causes and effects, the last of which results in carrying up the feather.  \"Now,\" continued his father, \"there is always a stream of air going up, wherever there is a lamp, or a fire, or heat, which heats the air in any way. The expanded air from a fire goes up chimney. The cool and heavy air in the room and out of doors crowds it up.\"  \"The air out of doors?\" said Rollo. \"How can that crowd it up?\"  \"Why, it presses in through all the crevices and openings all around the room, and crowds the light air up the chimney. All the smoke is carried up too with it, and it comes pouring out at the top of the chimney all the time.\"  \"You can see that the air presses in at all these crevices,\" continued Rollo's father, \"by experiment.\"  \"What experiment is it?\" said Rollo; \"let us try it.\"  \"I will let Nathan try it,\" said his father, \"and you may go with him and see the effect. First,\" he continued, \"you see by the smoke, that the air really goes up the chimney; and I will show you that other air really crowds into the space, from other parts of the room.\"  So he took a lamp from the table,--not the study lamp; it was a common lamp,--and held it at various places in the opening of the fireplace, by the jambs and near the upper part; and Rollo and Nathan saw that the flame, in all cases, was turned in towards the chimney.  \"Yes,\" said Rollo, \"I see it is drawn in.\"  \"No,\" said his father; \"strictly speaking, it is not _drawn_ in; it is pressed in, by the cool and heavy air of the room.\"  \"I thought,\" said Rollo's mother, \"that the chimney _drew_ the air from the room into it.\"  \"That is what is generally said,\" replied Mr. Holiday, \"but it is not strictly true. The common idea is, that the hot air rises in the chimney, and so draws the air from the room to supply its place; but this is not so. In the first place, nothing can rise unless it is forced up. The lightest things have some weight, and would, if left to themselves, fall. The hottest and lightest air in a chimney would fall to the earth, if there was no cooler and heavier air around it, to force it to rise;--just as the lightest cork, which would rise very quick from the bottom of the sea, would fall back again very quick, if the water was not there.  \"Remember, then, Nathan and Rollo, that, when a fire is built in a fireplace, so as to warm the air in the chimney, it makes this air not so heavy; and then the cool air all around it in the room and out of doors, presses in, and crowds under the light air, and makes it ascend.\"  \"But, father,\" said Nathan, \"you said I might perform an experiment.\"  \"Very well, I am ready now. Take the lamp, and carry it around the room, and hold it opposite any little opening you can find.\"  \"I can't find any little openings,\" said Nathan.  \"O yes,\" said his father; \"the key-hole of the door is a little opening, and there is a narrow crevice all around the door; and you will find little crevices around the windows. Now, hold the lamp opposite any of these, and you will see that the air presses in.\"  So Nathan went with the lamp, Rollo following him, and held the lamp opposite to the key-hole, and the crevices around the door and windows; only, when he came to the window, his father told him to be very careful not to set the curtain on fire.  Rollo wanted Nathan to let him try it once; and so Nathan gave him the lamp. He said he meant to make a crevice; and so he pushed up the window a very little way, and held the lamp opposite to the opening. The air pressed the flame in towards the room, in all cases.  \"People commonly say, that it is _drawn_ in,\" said his father, \"but that is not strictly correct; it is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25206"],["title","Rollo's Philosophy. [Air] (#8)"],["body","_pressed_ in. There is no power of attraction, in the air that is in the room, to draw in the air that is out of doors, through the crevices; but the air that is out of doors, is so heavy, that it presses in, and crowds the warm and light air up the chimney.  \"And now,\" said his father, \"I cannot tell you anything more this evening; but, if you remember this, I will give you some further instruction another time.\"  \"Well, sir,\" said Nathan, \"only I wish you would tell me a little story, as you did last evening. Have not I been still?\"  His father had noticed, that he had been very still and attentive, but did not think before, that it was in expectation of being rewarded with a story.  \"Well,\" said his father, \"I will tell you a story, or give you a little advice. How should you like a little advice?\"  \"Well, father, a little advice; just which you please.\"  \"I advise you, then,--let me see,--what shall I advise you?--No, on the whole, I will tell you a story. Once there was a man, and he was a philosopher. He understood all that I have been explaining to you about the air being light when it was hot. So he got some very thin paper, and made a large paper bag. He cut the paper very curiously, and pasted it together at the edges in such a way, that the bag, when it was done, was round, like a ball; and it had a round opening at the bottom of it. In fact, it was a large paper ball.\"  \"How large was it?\" said Nathan.  \"It was so large, that, when it was swelled out full, it would have been higher than your head.\"  \"O, what a large ball!\" said Nathan. \"But what was it for?\"  \"Why, the man thought, as hot air is lighter than cool air, and floats up, that perhaps, if he could fill his paper ball with hot air, it would go up too.\"  \"And did it?\" said Nathan.  \"Yes,\" said his father. \"He filled it with hot air; and the hot air was so light, that it rose up and carried the paper ball with it.\"  \"How did he get the hot air into it?\" said Rollo.  \"Why, he held it over a little fire, with the mouth down. Then the hot air from the fire went up into the ball, and swelled it out full.\"  \"How high did it go?\" said Nathan.  \"O, it soared away,\" said his father, \"away up into the air, very high; until at length it got cool, and then it came down.\"  \"I should like to see such a ball as that,\" said Nathan.  \"Such a ball as that is called a _balloon_,\" said his father.  \"I wish I could see a balloon,\" said Nathan.       QUESTIONS.      What is the important difference between air and water, which     was explained in the last chapter, and mentioned in this? Does     the air tend to expand again after it is compressed? What is     this property of the air called? Is the air around us already     condensed, or is it in its natural state? What causes it to be     condensed? Suppose a thin glass vessel were to be filled with     air, and another with water, and the air suddenly removed from     the room around them; what would be the effects? What effect     does heat have upon the expansibility of air? How may this     effect be made to appear over a lamp? In a chimney? What was the     story which Rollo's father told Nathan?     CHAPTER VII.  PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION.   Some time after this, Rollo, and Nathan, and James, were playing in the shed, one pleasant morning in the spring. They were building with sticks of wood, which they piled in various ways, so as to make houses. They took care not to pile the wood, in any case, higher than their shoulders, for Jonas had told them that, if they piled the wood higher than that, there would be danger of its falling down upon them.  After some time, Rollo went into the house a few minutes, and James and Nathan went to the open part of the shed, and began to look out of doors. The sun was shining pleasantly, but the ground was wet, being covered with streams and pools of water, and melting snow-banks.  \"What a pleasant day!\" said James. \"I wish it was dry, so that we could go out better.\"  \"I wish we could fly,\" said Nathan, \"for it is very pleasant up in the air.\"  \"I wish we had a balloon,\" said James. \"If we had a balloon, we could go up in the air, easier than to fly.\"  \"O James,\" said Nathan, \"you could not get into a balloon if you had one.\"  \"Why not?\" said James.  \"Because,\" said Nathan, \"it would not be big enough.\"  \"Why, Nathan,\" said James, \"a balloon is bigger than this house.\"  \"O James, it is not higher than my head.\"  \"It is,\" said James, \"I know it is. I have read about balloons bigger than a house.\"  \"And my father,\" said Nathan, putting down his foot in a very positive air, \"my father told me himself, that a balloon was about as high as my head.\"  The boys disputed some time longer upon the subject, and finally, when Rollo came out of the house, they both appealed to him very eagerly to settle the dispute.  \"Isn't a balloon higher than Nathan's head?\" said James.  \"Is it as high as a house?\" said Nathan.  \"Why, I know,\" said Rollo, \"that a man made a balloon once about as high as Nathan's head, because my father said so; but perhaps it was a little one.\"  \"Yes,\" said James, \"I know it must be a little one; for balloons are big enough for men to go up in them.\"  \"O James,\" said Nathan, \"I don't believe it. Besides, the fire would burn 'em.\"  \"What fire?\" said James.  \"The fire they burn under the balloons, to make the air hot,\" said Nathan.  \"I don't believe they have any fire,\" said James.  Just then Nathan, happening to look around, saw Jonas standing behind them; he had just come out of the house, and was going out to his work. Hearing the boys engaged in this dispute, he stopped to listen. The boys both appealed to Jonas.  Jonas heard all that they had to say, and then replied,--  \"I cannot tell you much about going up in a balloon, but I can tell you something about getting along pleasantly down here upon the earth, which I think may be of service to you.\"  \"What is it?\" said James.  \"Why, that you will neither of you get along very pleasantly until you can bear to have any body else mistaken, without contradicting them. James, you think Nathan is mistaken about the size of a balloon, do you?\"  \"Yes, I know he is,\" said James.  \"Well,\" said Jonas, \"now why not let him remain mistaken?\"  \"Why,--I don't know,\" said James.  \"He isn't willing to be convinced, is he, that a balloon is as big as a house?\"  \"No,\" said James, \"he is not.\"  \"Then why don't you let him remain unconvinced? Why should you insist on setting him right, when he don't want to be set right?\"  \"And you, Nathan, suppose that James is mistaken, in thinking that the balloon is so big.\"  \"Yes,\" said Nathan, \"and that men can get into it, and go up in the air.\"  \"Well, now, if he wants to believe that balloons are so big, why are you not willing that he should? Why should you insist upon it that he should know that they are smaller?\"  \"Because I _know_,\" said Nathan, very positively, \"that they are small; and, besides, the paper would not be strong enough to bear a man.\"  \"I did not ask you,\" said Jonas, \"why _you_ believed that men could not go up in balloons, but why you were so anxious to make James believe so. Why not let him be mistaken?\"  \"Why--because,\" said Nathan.  \"You see, Nathan,\" continued Jonas, \"the world is full of people that are continually mistaken; and if you go about trying to set them all right by disputing them, you'll have a hard row to hoe.\"  \"A hard what?\" said Nathan.  \"A hard row to hoe,\" repeated Jonas. \"It's never of any service to attempt to convince people that don't want to be convinced; especially if they are wrong.\"  \"Especially if they are wrong!\" repeated Rollo, in astonishment.  \"Yes,\" replied Jonas. \"The very worst time to argue with a boy, is when he is wrong, and does not want to be set right. It is a great deal harder to get along in argument with one who is right, than with one who is wrong; for the one who is wrong, disputes; the one who is right, reasons.\"  \"Well, Jonas,\" said James, \"which of us was disputing?\"  \"Both of you,\" said Jonas.  \"Both of us,\" said James; \"but you said that only the one who was wrong, disputed.\"  \"Well,\" replied Jonas, \"you were both wrong.\"  \"Both wrong! O Jonas!\" said James.  \"Yes, both wrong,\" replied Jonas; and so saying, he was going away to his work.  \"But stop a minute longer,\" said James, \"and tell us how it is about the balloon; we want to know.\"  \"O no,\" said Jonas, \"you don't want to know; you want to _conquer_.\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" said Nathan.  \"Why, you don't really wish to learn any thing; but you want to have me decide the case, because each of you hopes that I shall decide in his favor. You want the pleasure of a victory, not the pleasure of acquiring knowledge.\"  \"No, Jonas,\" said Nathan, \"we do really want to know.\"  \"Well,\" said Jonas, \"I can't stop now to tell you; perhaps I will this evening; but I advise you always, after this, not to contradict people, and dispute with them, when they say things that you don't believe. Do as the gentleman did, when the man said the moon was a fire.\"  \"What did he do?\" said Rollo.  \"Why, he let him say it as much as he wanted to.\"  \"Tell us all about it,\" said James.  \"Well, then,\" said Jonas, \"once there was a man, and he saw the moon coming up behind the trees, and thought it was a large house burning up. He went along a little way, and he met a vulgar fellow, riding in a carriage.\"  \"Riding in a carriage!\" repeated Rollo, astonished.  \"Yes,\" said Jonas, \"handsomely dressed. 'Sir,' said the man, 'see that great fire!'  \"'It isn't a fire, you fool,' said the vulgar fellow; 'it's nothing but the moon.'  \"'The moon! no it isn't,' said the man; 'it is a monstrous great fire. Don't you see how it blazes up?'  \"'It is not a fire, I tell you,' said the vulgar fellow.  \"'I tell you 'tis,' said the man.  \"'You don't know any thing about it,' said the vulgar fellow.  \"'And you don't know the moon from a house on fire,' said the man, and so passed on.  \"A minute or two after"]]]
