She achieved international fame in her lifetime, putting Prince Edward Island and Canada on the world literary map. Best known for her \"Anne of Green Gables\" books, she was also a prolific writer of short stories and poetry. She published some 500 short stories and poems and twenty novels before her death in 1942. The Project Gutenberg collection of her short stories was gathered from numerous sources and is presented in chronological publishing order:  Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1896 to 1901 Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1902 to 1903 Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922          *       *       *       *       *     Short Stories 1905 to 1906      A Correspondence and a Climax                            1905     An Adventure on Island Rock                              1906     At Five O'Clock in the Morning                           1905     Aunt Susanna's Birthday Celebration                      1905     Bertie's New Year                                        1905     Between the Hill and the Valley                          1905     Clorinda's Gifts                                         1906     Cyrilla's Inspiration                                    1905     Dorinda's Desperate Deed                                 1906     Her Own People                                           1905     Ida's New Year Cake                                      1905     In the Old Valley                                        1906     Jane Lavinia                                             1906     Mackereling Out in the Gulf                              1905     Millicent's Double                                       1905     The Blue North Room                                      1906     The Christmas Surprise At Enderly Road                   1905     The Dissipation of Miss Ponsonby                         1906     The Falsoms' Christmas Dinner                            1906     The Fraser Scholarship                                   1905     The Girl at the Gate                                     1906     The Light on the Big Dipper                              1906     The Prodigal Brother                                     1906     The Redemption of John Churchill                         1906     The Schoolmaster's Letter                                1905     The Story of Uncle Dick                                  1906     The Understanding of Sister Sara                         1905     The Unforgotten One                                      1906     The Wooing of Bessy                                      1906     Their Girl Josie                                         1906     When Jack and Jill Took a Hand                           1905     A Correspondence and A Climax   At sunset Sidney hurried to her room to take off the soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking. She had milked eight cows and pumped water for the milk-cans afterward in the fag-end of a hot summer day. She did that every night, but tonight she had hurried more than usual because she wanted to get her letter written before the early farm bedtime. She had been thinking it out while she milked the cows in the stuffy little pen behind the barn. This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life. Existence would have been, so Sidney thought, a dreary, unbearable blank without it. She cast aside her milking-dress with a thrill of distaste that tingled to her rosy fingertips. As she slipped into her blue-print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below. Sidney ran out to the dark little entry and leaned over the stair railing. Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing, crying, quarrelling children, and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl's disgusted nostrils.  Aunt Jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year-old baby clinging to the other. She was a big shapeless woman with a round good-natured face--cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was Aunt Jane at all times and occasions.  \"I want to run over and see how Mrs. Brixby is this evening, Siddy, and you must take care of the baby till I get back.\"  Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby. It never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it. She had all her aunt's sweetness of disposition, if she resembled her in nothing else. She had not grumbled because she had to rise at four that morning, get breakfast, milk the cows, bake bread, prepare seven children for school, get dinner, preserve twenty quarts of strawberries, get tea, and milk the cows again. All her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went, but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly. But she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter.  She carried the baby to her room, spread a quilt on the floor for him to sit on, and gave him a box of empty spools to play with. Fortunately he was a phlegmatic infant, fond of staying in one place, and not given to roaming about in search of adventures; but Sidney knew she would have to keep an eye on him, and it would be distracting to literary effort.  She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow. The room was small--a mere box above the kitchen which Sidney shared with two small cousins. Her bed and the cot where the little girls slept filled up almost all the available space. The furniture was poor, but everything was neat--it was the only neat room in the house, indeed, for tidiness was no besetting virtue of Aunt Jane's.  Opposite Sidney was a small muslined and befrilled toilet-table, above which hung an eight-by-six-inch mirror, in which Sidney saw herself reflected as she devoutly hoped other people did not see her. Just at that particular angle one eye appeared to be as large as an orange, while the other was the size of a pea, and the mouth zigzagged from ear to ear. Sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate anything. It seemed to her to typify all that was unlovely in her life. The mirror of existence into which her fresh young soul had looked for twenty years gave back to her wistful gaze just such distortions of fair hopes and ideals.  Half of the little table by which she sat was piled high with books--old books, evidently well read and well-bred books, classics of fiction and verse every one of them, and all bearing on the flyleaf the name of Sidney Richmond, thereby meaning not the girl at the table, but her college-bred young father who had died the day before she was born. Her mother had died the day after, and Sidney thereupon had come into the hands of good Aunt Jane, with those books for her dowry, since nothing else was left after the expenses of the double funeral had been paid.  One of the books had Sidney Richmond's name printed on the title-page instead of written on the flyleaf. It was a thick little volume of poems, published in his college days--musical, unsubstantial, pretty little poems, every one of which the girl Sidney loved and knew by heart.  Sidney dropped her pointed chin in her hands and looked dreamily out into the moonlit night, while she thought her letter out a little more fully before beginning to write. Her big brown eyes were full of wistfulness and romance; for Sidney was romantic, albeit a faithful and understanding acquaintance with her father's books had given to her romance refinement and reason, and the delicacy of her own nature had imparted to it a self-respecting bias.  Presently she began to write, with a flush of real excitement on her face. In the middle of things the baby choked on a small twist spool and Sidney had to catch him up by the heels and hold him head downward until the trouble was ejected. Then she had to soothe him, and finally write the rest of her letter holding him on one arm and protecting the epistle from the grabs of his sticky little fingers. It was certainly letter-writing under difficulties, but Sidney seemed to deal with them mechanically. Her soul and understanding were elsewhere.  Four years before, when Sidney was sixteen, still calling herself a schoolgirl by reason of the fact that she could be spared to attend school four months in the winter when work was slack, she had been much interested in the \"Maple Leaf\" department of the Montreal weekly her uncle took. It was a page given over to youthful Canadians and filled with their contributions in the way of letters, verses, and prize essays. Noms de plume were signed to these, badges were sent to those who joined the Maple Leaf Club, and a general delightful sense of mystery pervaded the department.  Often a letter concluded with a request to the club members to correspond with the writer. One such request went from Sidney under the pen-name of \"Ellen Douglas.\" The girl was lonely in Plainfield; she had no companions or associates such as she cared for; the Maple Leaf Club represented all that her life held of outward interest, and she longed for something more.  Only one answer came to \"Ellen Douglas,\" and that was forwarded to her by the long-suffering editor of \"The Maple Leaf.\" It was from John Lincoln of the Bar N Ranch, Alberta. He wrote that, although his age debarred him from membership in the club (he was twenty, and the limit was eighteen), he read the letters of the department with much interest, and often had thought of answering some of the requests for correspondents. He never had done so, but \"Ellen Douglas's\" letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her. Would she be kind enough to correspond with him? Life on the Bar N, ten miles from the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],["title","Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#1)"],["body","of civilization, was lonely. He was two years out from the east, and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times.  Sidney liked the letter and answered it. Since then they had written to each other regularly. There was nothing sentimental, hinted at or implied, in the correspondence. Whatever the faults of Sidney's romantic visions were, they did not tend to precocious flirtation. The Plainfield boys, attracted by her beauty and repelled by her indifference and aloofness, could have told that. She never expected to meet John Lincoln, nor did she wish to do so. In the correspondence itself she found her pleasure.  John Lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains, so alien and remote from snug, humdrum Plainfield life that Sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the Bar N. As for Sidney's own letter, this is the way it read as she wrote it:                                  \"The Evergreens,\" Plainfield.      Dear Mr. Lincoln:      The very best letter I can write in the half-hour before the     carriage will be at the door to take me to Mrs. Braddon's     dance shall be yours tonight. I am sitting here in the library     arrayed in my smartest, newest, whitest, silkiest gown, with a     string of pearls which Uncle James gave me today about my     throat--the dear, glistening, sheeny things! And I am looking     forward to the \"dances and delight\" of the evening with keen     anticipation.      You asked me in your last letter if I did not sometimes grow     weary of my endless round of dances and dinners and social     functions. No, no, never! I enjoy every one of them, every     minute of them. I love life and its bloom and brilliancy; I     love meeting new people; I love the ripple of music, the hum     of laughter and conversation. Every morning when I awaken the     new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some     beautiful gift of joy.      The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey     mare Lady. The thrill of it is in my veins yet. I distanced     the others who rode with me and led the homeward canter alone,     rocking along a dark, gleaming road, shadowy with tall firs     and pines, whose balsam made all the air resinous around me.     Before me was a long valley filled with purple dusk, and     beyond it meadows of sunset and great lakes of saffron and     rose where a soul might lose itself in colour. On my right was     the harbour, silvered over with a rising moon. Oh, it was all     glorious--the clear air with its salt-sea tang, the aroma of     the pines, the laughter of my friends behind me, the spring     and rhythm of Lady's grey satin body beneath me! I wanted to     ride on so forever, straight into the heart of the sunset.      Then home and to dinner. We have a houseful of guests at     present--one of them an old statesman with a massive silver     head, and eyes that have looked into people's thoughts so long     that you have an uncanny feeling that they can see right     through your soul and read motives you dare not avow even to     yourself. I was terribly in awe of him at first, but when I     got acquainted with him I found him charming. He is not above     talking delightful nonsense even to a girl. I sat by him at     dinner, and he talked to me--not nonsense, either, this time.     He told me of his political contests and diplomatic battles;     he was wise and witty and whimsical. I felt as if I were     drinking some rare, stimulating mental wine. What a privilege     it is to meet such men and take a peep through their wise eyes     at the fascinating game of empire-building!      I met another clever man a few evenings ago. A lot of us went     for a sail on the harbour. Mrs. Braddon's house party came     too. We had three big white boats that skimmed down the     moonlit channel like great white sea birds. There was another     boat far across the harbour, and the people in it were     singing. The music drifted over the water to us, so sad and     sweet and beguiling that I could have cried for very pleasure.     One of Mrs. Braddon's guests said to me:      \"That is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness     refined away.\"      I hadn't thought about him before--I hadn't even caught his     name in the general introduction. He was a tall, slight man,     with a worn, sensitive face and iron-grey hair--a quiet man     who hadn't laughed or talked. But he began to talk to me then,     and I forgot all about the others. I never had listened to     anybody in the least like him. He talked of books and music,     of art and travel. He had been all over the world, and had     seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they     hadn't too, I think. I seemed to be looking into an enchanted     mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back     to me, but made, oh, so much more beautiful!      On my way home after the Braddon people had left us somebody     asked me how I liked Paul Moore! The man I had been talking     with was Paul Moore, the great novelist! I was almost glad I     hadn't known it while he was talking to me--I should have been     too awed and reverential to have really enjoyed his     conversation. As it was, I had contradicted him twice, and he     had laughed and liked it. But his books will always have a new     meaning to me henceforth, through the insight he himself has     given me.      It is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for     me. But much of its abiding sweetness comes from my friendship     with Margaret Raleigh. You will be weary of my rhapsodies over     her. But she is such a rare and wonderful woman; much older     then I am, but so young in heart and soul and freshness of     feeling! She is to me mother and sister and wise,     clear-sighted friend. To her I go with all my perplexities and     hopes and triumphs. She has sympathy and understanding for my     every mood. I love life so much for giving me such a     friendship!      This morning I wakened at dawn and stole away to the shore     before anyone else was up. I had a delightful run-away. The     long, low-lying meadows between \"The Evergreens\" and the shore     were dewy and fresh in that first light, that was as fine and     purely tinted as the heart of one of my white roses. On the     beach the water was purring in little blue ripples, and, oh,     the sunrise out there beyond the harbour! All the eastern     Heaven was abloom with it. And there was a wind that came     dancing and whistling up the channel to replace the beautiful     silence with a music more beautiful still.      The rest of the folks were just coming downstairs when I got     back to breakfast. They were all yawny, and some were grumpy,     but I had washed my being in the sunrise and felt as     blithesome as the day. Oh, life is so good to live!      Tomorrow Uncle James's new vessel, the _White Lady_, is to be     launched. We are going to make a festive occasion of it, and I     am to christen her with a bottle of cobwebby old wine.      But I hear the carriage, and Aunt Jane is calling me. I had a     great deal more to say--about your letter, your big \"round-up\"     and your tribulations with your Chinese cook--but I've only     time now to say goodbye. You wish me a lovely time at the     dance and a full programme, don't you?                                           Yours sincerely,                                             Sidney Richmond.  Aunt Jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby. Sidney said her prayers, went to bed, and slept soundly and serenely.  She mailed her letter the next day, and a month later an answer came. Sidney read it as soon as she left the post office, and walked the rest of the way home as in a nightmare, staring straight ahead of her with wide-open, unseeing brown eyes.  John Lincoln's letter was short, but the pertinent paragraph of it burned itself into Sidney's brain. He wrote:      I am going east for a visit. It is six years since I was home,     and it seems like three times six. I shall go by the C.P.R.,     which passes through Plainfield, and I mean to stop off for a     day. You will let me call and see you, won't you? I shall have     to take your permission for granted, as I shall be gone before     a letter from you can reach the Bar N. I leave for the east in     five days, and shall look forward to our meeting with all     possible interest and pleasure.  Sidney did not sleep that night, but tossed restlessly about or cried in her pillow. She was so pallid and hollow-eyed the next morning that Aunt Jane noticed it, and asked her what the matter was.  \"Nothing,\" said Sidney sharply. Sidney had never spoken sharply to her aunt before. The good woman shook her head. She was afraid the child was \"taking something.\"  \"Don't do much today, Siddy,\" she said kindly. \"Just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up. I'll fix you a dose of quinine.\"  Sidney refused to lie around and take it easy. She swallowed the quinine meekly enough, but she worked fiercely all day, hunting out superfluous tasks to do. That night she slept the sleep of exhaustion, but her dreams were unenviable and the awakening was terrible.  Any day, any hour, might bring John Lincoln to Plainfield. What should she do? Hide from him? Refuse to see him? But he would find out the truth just the same; she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely. Sidney trod the way of the transgressor, and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow. Everything had come to an end--nothing was left to her! In the untried recklessness of twenty untempered years she wished she could die before John Lincoln came to Plainfield. The eyes of youth could not see how she could possibly live afterward.         *       *       *       *       *  Some days later a young man stepped from the"]]]
