In the case of brewery No. 2, a beer made entirely from malt and a beer made from 80 per cent of malt and 20 per cent of rice are given, in both of which the same quality of malt was used.  Under brewery No. 3 are given determinations for ales prepared from 80 per cent of malt and 20 per cent of cerealin; 78 per cent of malt and 22 per cent of cerealin; 75 per cent of malt and 25 per cent of cerealin; and 65 per cent of malt, 28 per cent of cerealin, and 7 per cent of brewer's sugar. The same quality of malt was used in all of these brews, but the brews were of different strengths.  Table VII is given practically in two parts, the first part showing the actual results obtained by the analysis of the finished beer or ale and the second part showing protein, ash, and phosphoric acid calculated to the basis of a uniform wort containing 15 per cent of solids.  Taking into consideration the actual results obtained upon the beers and ales, it will be seen in the case of brewery No. 1 that the three beers vary in composition to a considerable degree. Especially is this variation marked in regard to the protein, ash, and phosphoric acid contents, which exhibit a marked decrease approximately in direct proportion to the amount of cerealin or corn substituted for malt. The same condition is apparent in the case of the products made in brewery No. 2, the beer made from 80 per cent of malt and 20 per cent of rice showing a material reduction in protein, ash, and phosphoric acid. In brewery No. 3, however, a somewhat different condition is noted. Unfortunately, there is no all-malt product of this brewery to compare with the brews made from a portion of cerealin or from cerealin and brewer's sugar. It will be noted, however, that when the actual results obtained on the finished products of this brewery are compared with those of the all-malt brews of breweries Nos. 1 and 2, they do not clearly show a reduction of protein and ash as might be expected. For example, in the case of one of the samples of the ale made with 25 per cent of cerealin and 75 per cent of malt (sample No. 29512-B), the percentage of protein is 0.65 and of the ash 0.266. The percentages of protein and ash for the three samples of this ale represented by Nos. 29512-B, 29514-B, and 29519-B are higher than were found in any of the all-malt products of the first two breweries under consideration. This, however, can be readily explained when it is considered that in the case of brewery No. 2 in the all-malt beers (sample No. 22017-D) only 58 pounds of malt were used in the preparation of a barrel of beer containing 31 gallons; while in the case of sample No. 29512-B there were used, in preparing a barrel of similar capacity, 68 pounds of malt and 23 pounds of cerealin. That is, in the second product there is, in the same volume of liquid, the extractive material from 68 pounds of malt and 23 pounds of cerealin, while in the first product there is present the extractive material from only 58 pounds of malt. Since the analysis is made upon the finished liquid it is evident that the percentage composition of any particular ingredient should be very much larger in the second product because of the very much larger amount of material used in its preparation. It is apparent, therefore, that no direct comparison can be made between the percentage composition of these different brews in order to determine the effects of the raw materials upon their composition.  The most satisfactory way to have tested this question of the effect of raw materials on the finished product would have been to make a series of worts with exactly the same percentage of solids, some of pure malt and others of mixtures of pure malt and corn, rice, and cerealin; then a direct comparison between the results would have shown the effects of these various materials. This method was impracticable because it was necessary to take the brews as actually made under varying commercial conditions. The object sought can be accomplished, however, by calculating the results of these analyses either to the basis of dry material in the original wort or by calculating them to the basis of a wort with constant water content. It was decided to calculate all of the results to the basis of a wort containing 15 per cent of solids, as this would give a uniform basis for comparison and would be approximately an average wort. The method employed in calculating the various beers and ales to this uniform basis was as follows:  The percentage of solids in the original wort was calculated by multiplying the percentage by weight of alcohol by 2 and adding the percentage by weight of extract. The result for an ordinary beer would be about 12 per cent, while in the case of a very heavy ale it might be as high as 18 or 20 per cent. The actual percentages of protein, ash, and phosphoric acid found by analysis were then calculated to the basis of a uniform wort containing 15 per cent of solids. This was the method used for preparing the second part of this table. A study of this portion of the table shows the actual effects of the various substitutes used for malt on the composition of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25050"],["title","A Study of American Beers and Ales (#5)"],["body","product. For instance, the first of the all-malt beers from brewery No. 2 (22017-D) showed in the analysis of the original product a protein percentage of 0.603, an ash percentage of 0.206, and a phosphoric acid percentage of 0.079. When calculated to the basis of a wort containing 15 per cent of solids instead of 12.72 per cent (the actual percentage of solids in the wort from which it was made), it gave the following percentages: Protein, 0.712; ash, 0.243; and phosphoric acid, 0.093. In the case of brewery No. 3, sample No. 29512-B, where the original analysis of the product showed 0.650 per cent of protein, 0.266 of ash, and 0.057 of phosphoric acid, it will be found that when this product is calculated to the basis of a wort of 15 per cent of solids instead of a wort of 19.52 (the actual percentage of solids in the wort in this case) the percentage of ash is 0.204, of protein 0.499, and of phosphoric acid 0.044. A comparison of these results shows that in the protein, ash, and phosphoric acid there has been a material reduction below the figures found upon the all-malt beer, due to the presence of the 25 per cent of cerealin. A study of these results, calculated to the basis of 15 per cent of solids in the wort, shows very clearly that the general effect of the substitution of cerealin, brewer's sugar, rice, and corn is to reduce the content of ash, protein, and phosphoric acid.  It is evident from the results here given that the most important things to be considered in judging the nature of the raw materials used in the preparation of a beer are the quantities of protein, phosphoric acid, and ash; as the other constituents present in the finished beer are more or less variable, the quantities present depending upon the methods of mashing and fermentation.  Table VIII contains a summary of results giving the ash, protein, and phosphoric acid in all of the finished products of known composition which were examined, calculated to the basis of a uniform wort of 15 per cent of solids.

+-----------------------------+----------+-----+-----------+------------+   A study of the results given in Table VIII shows that in the case of American beers the all-malt beers are higher in ash, protein, and phosphoric acid than are any of the beers made from a mixed mash of malt and other cereals. The difference is sufficiently marked to make it possible to draw a rather sharp line between the all-malt beers and the beers made from the present commercial mixtures. Take, for instance, the beers made from mixtures of malt and rice in which the proportion of rice varies from 20 to 50 per cent. It will be seen that in none of these samples is the ash, phosphoric acid, or protein so high as the minimum found in the all-malt beers. The same will be seen in the case of the malt-and-corn beers. In none of the malt-and-corn beers is the ash, protein, or phosphoric acid so high as the minimum found in the all-malt beers, and the same is true of the mixtures of malt and cerealin and of malt, brewer's sugar, and cerealin. This shows clearly that the commercial beers made in this country from malt and malt substitutes can be distinguished readily from all-malt beers.  When the average composition of the 21 all-malt beers examined is taken into consideration it will be seen that there is a very sharp line of demarcation between the all-malt and the malt, rice, and corn products. From the figures which were obtained upon American beers it would seem that protein as a rule is more sharply reduced by the addition of malt substitutes than is the ash or the phosphoric acid, although where corn or cerealin is used there is a very marked reduction in the amount of phosphoric acid. It would appear, therefore, from the results of this investigation that in the consideration of American beers it will be comparatively easy to draw a line between beers made solely from malt and those made from mixtures of malt with rice, corn, and other substitutes.  This conclusion is not entirely in agreement with the results which have been obtained by others upon foreign beers, in the preparation of which low protein barleys have been used. Joseph Race[1] has reported some interesting results of an investigation carried on for the same purpose as that for which this particular investigation was undertaken; that is, to distinguish between all-malt beers and those made from substitutes. His results do not show as sharp a reduction of the protein, but he found in his all-malt beers a very much lower percentage of total protein than was found in the malt beers of this country. He did observe, however, a material reduction of the phosphoric acid due to the use of substitutes. Unfortunately, he made his determination of phosphoric acid in the ash, and while he reports a marked difference between the phosphoric acid content of the malt beers and those made from substitutes, his total figures for phosphoric acid are much lower than those reported in this bulletin. For this reason the figures for total phosphoric acid given by him are not at all comparable with those determined by the moist combustion method, by the uranium acetate method, or by the method of ashing with calcium acetate.[2]  [Footnote 1: J.
