He counted twenty-two horses, secured to a fence and in other places where it could be done. This he concluded was the force of the enemy. He could hear very loud noises and shouts within the mansion, and the sounds appeared to come from the upper story of the building. It was evident that the marauders had searched the lower part of the house, and were now engaged in going through the upper portion.  \"Was it known that Mr. Halliburn had a large sum of money in his house?\" asked Deck in a whisper of the guide.  \"Probably it was; he kept it in several banks till recently. When he withdrew the money from the banks, the officers of these institutions were incensed against him; for his example would be followed by other influential people, and the banks would be ruined,\" Win explained in the same low tone.  \"Stufton, go to the rear of the house, and send the first six men you come to around to me. Tell them to make no noise,\" continued the lieutenant, addressing the bugler.  He was not absent more than three minutes, and the men crept around the house as though they had been engaged in a burglarious enterprise, securing their sabres so that they did not rattle. Milton wondered what the cavalryman in command intended to do, but he waited patiently for the outcome. Ordering the men in a whisper to follow him, Deck stole silently to the portico of the mansion on the east side, which was precisely like one on the west.  The front door of the mansion was wide open. Deck stationed his six men on the piazza, close to the building, and then passed into the hall through the open passage. A door on each side opened into as many large apartments. The one on the right was plainly the parlor. On a broad sofa reclined a man with white hair and beard. He lay there, and did not move any more than if the breath had left his body. In the room on the left lay an elderly woman on another sofa, as motionless as the other.  Heavy footsteps could be heard on the floors of the upper story, with the sound of rough voices, from which proceeded a constant flow of profanity. Deck stepped out of the hall to the piazza, and called the men to him one at a time, and then stationed them in the hall surrounding the staircase leading to the second story.  \"If any one attempts to descend the stairs, warn him not to do so, and shoot him if he disobeys,\" said Deck to each of the troopers, who had his carbine in readiness for use.  \"Are there any back stairs in the house, Win?\" asked Deck in the usual whisper.  \"There are, by the dining-room in the rear,\" replied the guide, who began to understand the method by which the lieutenant meant to operate, but he said nothing.  Deck went to the west door of the mansion, opened it, and called three more men, whom he instructed as he had the others, and stationed them at the foot of the back stairs. Calling a corporal and a private, he sent them to Life and Tilford, with an order to secure all horses, and load their carbines, putting their revolvers in their belts. Then they were to wait for the signal from the bugle.  \"Now we will look into the two rooms, and see if the man and woman on the sofas are dead,\" said Deck to the guide. \"Come with me, Win, if you please.\"  Milton had not entered the house before, and had not seen the persons on the sofas. He followed the lieutenant into the room where the man lay. Going nearer to him than before, he discovered that the gentleman was strapped to the sofa so that he could not move.  \"It is Mr. Halliburn!\" was the whispered exclamation of Win.  \"Hush! Don't speak, sir,\" said Deck, as he proceeded to remove the straps which bound him, aided by the guide.  \"Not a sound, sir!\" continued the young officer. \"You are safe, and so is Miss Morgan, and also the treasure-chest. Not a word!\"  Win assisted him to sit up on the sofa, and then went into the other front room with Deck. The latter warned her as he had the man not to speak, and then asked the guide who she was, while both of them began at once to remove her bonds.  \"Mrs. Halliburn,\" replied Win, who assisted her to rise as soon as she was liberated.  \"Now, Win, if you wish to go and find your horse, I can spare you, though I should like very well to have you remain longer.\"  \"I want to see this thing through,\" answered Milton. \"I have seen you pile up all the incidents of this affair, like those in a novel; and now I want to see you pull out the pin in the last chapter, and let everything down in a heap. I suppose Grace is safe with your men to guard her.\"  \"I will vouch for her safety. I am going to pull out the pin now,\" added Deck, as he beckoned the bugler to follow him to the front or east piazza.  He ordered him to sound the \"Advance,\" and the command was promptly obeyed. The ringing notes of the startling call sounded clearly in the silence of the retired locality, and it could have been heard at least half a mile. Life Knox's force came first, and Deck directed the sergeant to surround the house, and shoot down any guerilla that attempted to escape. The bugle sounded the second call, and Corporal Tilford and his dozen men appeared in front of the mansion. The sergeant continued to station the men till all of them were in position.  The marauders flocked to the windows, and found half a dozen carbines pointed at each opening. It checked their enthusiasm at once. At the staircase those who proposed to descend found as many pieces aimed at them. It looked just then as though Lieutenant Lyon had bagged the twenty-two guerillas in the upper story of the mansion.     CHAPTER IV  A REFRACTORY GUERILLA CHIEF   The situation did not look hopeful to the ruffians who had taken possession of the mansion. They saw at least forty carbines pointed at them, and the staircase looked like a barred gate to them. Their heavy footsteps could be heard in the lower story as they walked about from one window to another, searching for some avenue of escape. Life Knox was passing around the house, assisted by Corporal Tilford, in readiness to meet the first attempt to resist the fate that was in store for them.  The lieutenant stood at the front door, and occasionally stepped out-doors to assure himself that the house was well covered by his troopers. He was disposed to wait for some movement on the part of the enemy, or to allow them to get accustomed to the situation. He had fought guerillas before; and it was not wise, in his judgment, to force them suddenly into desperation, for they became reckless when pressed too hard.  \"You have got them into a tight place,\" said Win Milton, who was watching the young officer with the most intense interest.  \"The circumstances have just fitted the situation for me,\" replied Deck, who kept his eyes wandering in every direction in search of any demonstration on the part of the ruffians. \"Do you know any of the men you have seen about the place, Win?\"  \"I recognize one of them, and I have seen some of the others,\" replied the guide. \"A fellow who is called Captain Coonly seems to be in command of the gang. He has been the most active Secessionist in Adair County, and the most desperate one. He has an intense hatred of the Union men of the vicinity, and has advocated hanging every one of them. He is a fire-eater of the most pronounced stamp; but the rascal is a coward, I believe, though he has the reputation of being a brave man; yet he is nothing but a bully. You would think, to hear him talk, that he was going to burn up the Cumberland River.\"  \"Is he the long-haired fellow I saw at the head of the stairs, dressed better than the rest of the gang?\" asked Deck.  \"That is the man. He is well educated, and is a lawyer in Columbia; but the influential and conservative men, who are nearly all Unionists, will have nothing to do with him, and have always looked upon him as a scallawag. He raised a company of Home Guards, but he could enlist only the ruffians of the vicinity,\" replied Milton, as he drew the picture of the leader of the guerillas; and Deck thought the lawyer was not unlike some of the Secessionists of Butler and Edmonson Counties.  \"As you say, we have the ruffians in a tight place, and I want to give them a chance to think over the situation, and take it in,\" added Deck. \"If they want to fight, we can accommodate them at any moment they are ready to open the ball. I suppose they are all armed.\"  \"With old shot-guns, horse-pistols, and antique rifles,\" replied Win contemptuously.  \"But even such weapons will kill; and I don't want to lose my men unless it is absolutely necessary, for they can be put to a better use than in grinding up such blackguards as we have here.\"  \"Don't you think they comprehend the situation by this time?\" asked Milton, who seemed to be impatient to see the end of the affair.  \"I might as well wait here as at Millersville; for Captain Gordon has gone over to Breedings to settle up a case of this kind, and he may not arrive for several hours yet. I will go into the house and talk with Mr. Halliburn,\" said Deck, as he suited the action to the word.  \"I doubt if he can give you any information you have not already obtained,\" answered Milton, following the lieutenant into the mansion.  The planter and his wife were found on the sofas where they had been confined; and they seemed to be still paralyzed with terror, for not a few Union men had been hung or shot in the State within the preceding year. Mr. Halliburn was a man of sixty or more. He had been a clergyman during a considerable portion of his life, and he was not at all belligerent in his nature.  \"Mr. Halliburn, this is Lieutenant Lyon, of the Riverlawn Cavalry, serving the United States Government,\" said Win, presenting the young officer.  \"I am very glad to see you, Lieutenant Lyon; I may say that I am rejoiced to see you at this time, for I am beset by the children of Satan, who would hang me to the highest walnut in my park,\" said the venerable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24866"],["title","A Lieutenant at Eighteen (#5)"],["body","man, with a sweetly religious smile on his thin lips, while his eyes lighted up with an expression in keeping with the smile, which excited the reverence of the youthful soldier.  \"I am very glad to see you, Mr. Halliburn, for I hope I shall soon be able to relieve you of your troublesome visitors,\" replied Deck, taking the hand the planter extended to him.  \"I am not a man of war or blood, and I have submitted with what resignation I could command to the outrages of these myrmidons of sin,\" continued the ex-clergyman. \"They learned in some manner that I had money in the house, which belongs mostly to my ward, Miss Morgan.\"  \"I have met her, and sent two of my men to conduct her to the house of your brother,\" added Deck.  \"God bless you for your kindness to the child!\" exclaimed Mr. Halliburn, grasping the officer's hand again. \"When I saw these foes of God and man coming towards the mansion, I understood their mission; and I sent Grace to my brother's with all the money in the house. I hoped to save it for her use, for nearly all of it belongs to her. But where is my poor wife?\"  \"She is all right, in the sitting-room,\" replied Win. \"I will bring her in,\" and he hastened to the other front room for her.  Mr. Halliburn told the lieutenant that the marauders had threatened to hang him if he did not tell where his money was concealed. He had told them the truth, that there was no money in the house; but they refused to believe him, and had been searching the house for the last hour. They had opened every drawer and closet, explored the cellar, examined the chimneys at each end of the house, and then gone up-stairs to continue the hunt.  Mrs. Halliburn came into the room, leaning on the arm of Win Milton, who presented her to the lieutenant. She looked like the twin-sister, rather than the wife, of the planter, and the same pious expression was settled upon her face. But Deck had learned all he cared to know at present, and he thought by this time that the guerillas had come to a realizing sense of their situation. He thought it was time for him to attend to them. As he passed out of the parlor, a soldier saluted him.  \"One on 'em wants to speak to the commanding officer,\" said he, pointing to the head of the stairs, where the marauders were huddled together. \"This is the lieutenant in command,\" added the cavalryman, calling to the man who wished to see him.  \"What! that boy?\" demanded the ruffian.  \"Boy or man, I am in command of this detachment of United States cavalry,\" replied Deck, elevating his head as high as he could get it; and he was quite as tall as half of his platoon. \"If you have anything to say to me, say it with a civil tongue in your head.\"  \"That is Captain Coonly,\" said Win in a low tone.  \"I have come to the conclusion that I had better make terms with you,\" replied the leader of the ruffians.  \"I make no terms with thieves and robbers,\" answered Deck, with dignity enough for a major-general. \"I find you engaged in plundering a citizen of the United States, threatening him, and ransacking his mansion. Soldiers do not engage in such work.\"  \"I am in the service of the Southern Confederacy,\" replied Captain Coonly, evidently somewhat crestfallen.  \"Have you a commission about you?\"  \"Not yet; but I shall have one.\"  \"I look upon you and your gang as guerillas, and I shall treat you as such. Will you surrender to an officer of the United States?\"  \"No, I won't surrender! I am willing to make terms with you, and will do the fair thing,\" blustered the captain without a commission.  \"I do not make terms with such as you are. We have talked enough on that subject, and you need not say another word about terms; there is no such word in my book.\"  \"My men are all armed in good shape, and they are fighting characters. All I ask is fair play.\"  \"You shall have it; and according to the civil law of Kentucky, that means the inside of a prison-cell for such fellows as you are!\" answered the lieutenant coolly and calmly, with no display of anger; for he was trying with all his might to follow the excellent advice his father had given him for his guidance as an officer.  \"No civil law about it!\" exclaimed Captain Coonly, his wrath stirred up by the mention of a prison. \"I am a soldier, and so are my men. I demand terms such as one military officer should give to another.\"  \"I do not recognize you as a soldier in the service of the Confederacy, which would entitle you to military consideration,\" Lieutenant Lyon declared with as much solemnity as though he had been presiding over a court-martial.  Win Milton could hardly control his risible muscles; for he was inclined to laugh outright as he heard a young fellow of eighteen talk as though he understood military law as well as he did cavalry tactics. But Deck had studied the needed subjects for his conduct as an officer while others slept, and he had improved every opportunity to converse with Captain Gordon upon the laws and customs of the service.  \"I thought you said we should have fair play?\" growled Captain Coonly.  \"I did; and I explained what fair play was in a case like this. But we have talked enough about terms; and now we will proceed to business, or to fight out this thing, if you so elect,\" said Deck very calmly but very decidedly.  \"But I only ask\"--  \"You need not ask anything!\" interposed the lieutenant. \"We have talked enough; now will you oblige me by coming down the stairs?\"  \"What if I decline to come down the stairs?\" demanded Captain Coonly.  \"Then I shall interpret your reply to mean that you prefer to fight out this matter.\"  \"But you have us\"--  \"I have you, and I propose to keep you. No more talk! Come down-stairs, Captain Coonly, or I will order my men to fire!\"  The leader of the marauders hesitated, and then took a single step in the descent; he halted there.  \"I only want to say\"--  \"Say nothing more! Come down, or you are a dead man in another second!\" added Deck, still calm and resolute.  [Illustration: \"COME DOWN, OR YOU ARE A DEAD MAN.\" _Page 64._]  \"Go down, Cap!\" said several of his followers as they retired from the dangerous locality at the head of the stairs.  The captain did not hesitate any longer, but descended the steps very slowly, as though he was marching at his own funeral.  \"Win, bring all the cords and straps you can find. We shall want a lot of them,\" said Deck in a low tone to the guide. \"Bugler, go with him and help him bring them.\"  \"This is not fair play,\" said the captain as he landed in the hall.  \"No more talk!\"  \"What are you going to do with me?\" demanded Coonly.  \"You are my prisoner, and I intend to secure you properly. Give me your sword and pistols.\"  \"I'll see you in\"--  \"Life!\" called Deck, as he saw the stalwart sergeant near the front door.  \"Here, Leftenant!\" replied Life as he strode into the hall and made the military salute to his officer.  \"Disarm this man!\" said Deck, pointing to the ruffian leader.  The tall sergeant seized Coonly by the collar of his coat with his left hand, held him out as though he had been a small boy, unbuckled his sword-belt, and took two revolvers from his pockets with his right. The captain was a middling-sized man, and he struggled in the gripe of the powerful Kentuckian; but he might as well have attempted to resist Hercules himself.  \"Now bind his arms behind him,\" continued Deck.  \"I protest, Lieutenant, against this brutal treatment!\" stormed the prisoner in a loud voice.  \"All right; protest as much as you please, but don't make too much noise about it, or I shall be obliged to have you gagged.\"  This hint quieted him; and with the aid of the bugler he was secured as the officer had ordered.     CHAPTER V  LIEUTENANT LYON ENCOUNTERS ANOTHER ENEMY   Surrounded by double their own number of soldiers, armed with the best weapons, the marauders imprisoned in the upper story of the mansion could not help realizing that their situation was hopeless. They had not offered to come to the assistance of Captain Coonly when he was in the gripe of the stalwart sergeant; for the carbines of the cavalrymen still covered them, and they saw that they would be shot down if they attempted to descend the stairs without orders, or fired upon their assailants in the hall.  The captain was conducted into the sitting-room, and a man was placed at the door to keep watch of him. But he was harmless by this time; as Win expressed it, \"the fun had all gone out of him.\" Deck began to think he had spent time enough over the affair; and he was in a hurry to return to the Millersville Road.  \"Up-stairs there!\" he called to the ruffians, who remained there because they could not escape without the certainty of being shot whether they attempted to leave by the windows or the stairs. \"Is there any officer among you?\"  \"Lieutenant Billock is here,\" replied one of them.  \"Let him show himself.\"  \"That is my name,\" responded a fellow nearly as big as Life Knox at the head of the stairs.  \"Your commander is a prisoner, and you rank next to him. What do you propose to do, fight or surrender?\" Deck inquired of him.  \"What can I do?\" asked the big fellow; and he had not the air of a fighting-man, in spite of his ample proportions.  \"That is for you to decide,\" answered Deck.  \"We are surrounded by double our own number, and caged here like a lot of mules. Give me five minutes to talk to the boys,\" returned the guerilla lieutenant.  \"All right; but not a minute more than five,\" added the officer of cavalry, as he looked at his watch.  \"What are you gwine to do with 'em when you get 'em?\" asked Life in a low tone.  \"Turn them over to Captain Gordon when I have done my share of the job,\" answered Deck.  \"We have concluded to surrender,\" said Lieutenant Billock at the head of the stairs. \"I don't see 's we kin help ourselves under the sucumstances.\"  \"Very well; I shall hold you as prisoners, and treat you as I did your captain. Call in six more men, Life.\"  This additional force, carbine in hand, was "]]]
