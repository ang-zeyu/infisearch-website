At this moment Mr. Milton arrived at the spot, and had apparently recognized the two gentlemen as they rode across the field. He saluted them both, calling them by name.  \"I've told these doctors what we want of them,\" added the sergeant.  \"But what about this battle, Mr. Milton?\" inquired Dr. McNairy, the elder one, who appeared to be about sixty years old.  Milton gave a very brief account of the action, and mentioned that Mr. Halliburn's mansion had been ransacked by the prisoners whom he pointed out in the field.  \"Why didn't you hang them?\" demanded Dr. Barlow, the young doctor.  \"The military officer in command of the detachment here managed the business, and I had nothing to do with the matter; though I would have strung up Coonly if I had had my way, for hanging would do him good. But the lieutenant said that one outrage did not mend another,\" replied Milton impatiently; for he was anxious to have the wounded cared for.  \"The lieutenant is a sensible man,\" added Dr. McNairy.  \"Now, Dr. Barlow, your coming is most opportune; and I hope you will attend to the wounded of the Union force, and that Dr. McNairy will do the same for the Confederates,\" added Milton.  \"It is a mere accident that we happen to be here, for we have been over to perform an operation on the wife of General Macklin; but I am glad to be able to serve the Union wounded, and I am quite willing to do the same for the Confederates.\"  \"I will take care of the Confederates,\" added Dr. McNairy.  \"Now, Sergeant Knox, if you will conduct Dr. McNairy to the Confederates, I will take Dr. Barlow to the Union wounded.\"  \"I'll do that; but tell the leftenant there is a cavalry force comin' down the road, and I reckon it's the first platoon of our company.\"  Both of them departed on their missions, accompanied by the doctors.     CHAPTER VII  THE BATTLE AT THE BREEDINGS FORT   Dr. McNairy was introduced to Lieutenant Logan, and the surgeon began his work at once. Both of the professional gentlemen had their instruments with them, for they had performed an operation that forenoon. Life remained but a moment after he had done his errand, and hastened to a point where he could obtain a better view of the approaching cavalry force. His supposition that it was the first platoon of the first company proved to be correct, and he awaited its arrival.  The column was moving leisurely, for there was no occasion for haste; and it appeared later that the men had not been idle during the forenoon. Captain Gordon and Lieutenant Belthorpe were riding at the head of the platoon, and as they came to a turn in the road the scene of the late action came into view; and both of the officers were greatly surprised, for neither of them had supposed that Deck would have anything to do but guard and hurry on the baggage-wagons.  \"What does all that mean?\" asked the captain, as he opened his eyes very wide to take in the gathering in the road and the fields beside it of men and horses.  \"It looks as though Lieutenant Lyon had been doing something there; but I will warrant that Deck has done his duty like a man, whatever he has been at,\" replied Tom Belthorpe, who had an abundant admiration for the young officer.  \"I hope he has not been reckless, as I am afraid he is inclined to be when things get warm around him,\" returned the captain.  \"There comes Sergeant Knox; and things must be quiet in the camp, or he would not have left Deck for a moment,\" added the lieutenant.  Life had ridden forward to inform the captain what had transpired in the road and at the mansion of Mr. Halliburn; for he believed the officers would be anxious to solve what was now a mystery to them.  \"What's going on here, Sergeant?\" demanded the captain as soon as Life came within speaking-distance of him.  \"We uns have had a bit of a scrimmage here with Confed'rit cavalry,\" replied the sergeant as he reined in his steed, and saluted the captain.  \"A skirmish?\" said the captain.  \"Well, yes; and it was a rayther lively bout till the enemy surrendered.\"  \"Did they surrender?\" asked the commander of the company; for it was not the habit of the Southern troopers to yield, and he had been fighting with a portion of the same company that forenoon.  \"They couldn't help theirselves; we outnumbered 'em, and they had to give in or be cut to pieces.\"  \"How is Lieutenant Lyon?\" inquired the captain with no little anxiety in his tones and his expression.  \"I reckon he's got a sword-cut on the arm; but he's right side up, and don't say nothin' about it.\"  \"What were the losses?\"  \"We had two killed and four wounded.\"  \"Who were the killed?\"  \"Orly Lyon and Barron.\"  \"Both new recruits, and one of them is the nephew of Major Lyon.\"  \"The enemy lost six killed, and nine wounded; and the captain in command was in the fust lot, brought down by Leftenant Lyon in a hand-to-hand squabble at the side of the road. Deck fit like a mad rooster. His hoss stood up straight, and gin his rider a chance to git in the cut that finished the officer.\"  \"Lieutenant Lyon was reckless, wasn't he, Sergeant?\" asked the captain.  \"Not a bit on't! He was as cool as a frozen cowcumber; but he hit hard when his hoss stood up endways,\" replied Life. \"We cleaned out a gang of gorillas afore we had this scrimmage in the road.\"  \"Another affair? Did you have a hard fight with them?\"  \"No fight at all,\" answered the tall Kentuckian, with a slight chuckle. \"Deck bagged 'em like a flock of wild turkeys in a trap-pen.\"  \"We will hear about that another time,\" said Captain Gordon as the head of the column arrived at the scene of the fight. \"Who are those over on our right?\"  \"The fust ones is the Confed'rits burin' their dead. The next lot is the doctor fixin' up the enemy's wounded. The surgeon is a Secesh, and we picked up two on 'em as they come across lots from an operation on some woman. T'other is over with our men, and he's a Union man.\"  \"Where is Lieutenant Lyon?\"  \"I left him over by the baggage-wagons, lookin' out for the wounded. We shall git there in a minute or two.\"  \"What are those men on our left, in the field?\" asked the captain as they came to a point where the prisoners could be seen, still in charge of Corporal Tilford.  \"Them's the prisoners tooken over at the mansion of Mr. Halliburn, half a mile from here,\" replied Life, as they approached the location of the wounded Union soldiers.  Dr. Barlow had informed Deck of the coming of the first platoon, and he had mounted his horse to go out and meet them. He was ready to come into the presence of the captain of the company; for he felt that he had done his duty faithfully, and also that he had conducted himself with prudence and discretion.  \"What in the world have you been doing over here, Lieutenant Lyon?\" asked Captain Gordon, as he rode forward, and grasped the hand of the young officer. \"You seem to have been busy here from what Sergeant Knox has told me.\"  \"We haven't had any time to spare, Captain; for in half an hour after we parted events began to thicken upon us, and we have been kept busy ever since,\" replied Deck.  \"I will hear your report later, for my men are tired, and need their dinner. It seems to be all quiet about here now, and we must take a rest here.\"  \"I have ordered our cooks to make coffee, and it will be ready to serve out very soon,\" replied Deck, as he pointed to the fires in the field behind the temporary hospital; and near them the horses of the troopers and the mules that drew the wagons were eating their oats off the grass. \"We shall feed our men on herring and hardtack with the coffee.\"  Lieutenant Belthorpe ordered his men to picket their horses and feed them; and in another hour the soldiers and their beasts had all been fed. Seated on the grass with his two lieutenants, the captain listened to the report of Deck on the events of the forenoon. When he came to his encounter with Captain Letcher, both of his auditors were intensely interested, though he told his story very modestly.  \"I suppose you caused Ceph to stand up on end when you found yourself in a tight place?\" suggested Tom Belthorpe.  \"I did not,\" answered Deck very emphatically. \"Ceph knows more than some men; but he became restive and uneasy after the captain and I had pegged away at each other for some time, and he stood up of his own accord. I had to hold on with all my might with my left hand; but my horse did not try to leap over the other animal, for he was even taller than Ceph. When I saw the captain's head below mine, I used the opportunity, and made the cut that finished the affair. I was not reckless, as I was once accused of being, but wrongly, Captain Gordon. I have made it a business of mine to-day to keep cool, and not let my impulses run away with me; and I think I succeeded very well.\"  \"Life thinks so too,\" added the captain.  \"I have not said a word to him about it. I have kept my affairs closely in my own head.\"  \"You managed the guerillas admirably, and bagged them very skilfully,\" said his superior approvingly.  \"I think it was largely a matter of luck and chance that I gathered them in without losing a man, or even having a fight,\" added Deck. \"The ruffians were all busy ransacking the mansion in search of the money; and if they had found it, I learned from Mr. Milton that it would have given them over two hundred dollars apiece. I got in without disturbing them, and they did not suspect the presence of my platoon till the bugler sounded the call for my men. Then they were surrounded, and the carbines were pointed at every window, with half a dozen aimed up the staircase. It was easy enough then to bring the affair to a conclusion.\"  \"What are you going to do with your prisoners, Lieutenant?\" asked Captain Gordon.  \"I turn them over to my superior officer, of course; for I have ceased to be in command now. Mr. Milton informed me that there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24870"],["title","The Stars, My Brothers (#0)"],["body","STARS,  MY BROTHERS   By  EDMOND  HAMILTON   Illustrated by FINLAY    _He was afraid--not of the present or the future,  but of the past. He was afraid of the thing  tagged Reed Kieran, that stiff blind voiceless  thing wheeling its slow orbit around the Moon,  companion to dead worlds and silent space._   [Illustration]   1.  Something tiny went wrong, but no one ever knew whether it was in an electric relay or in the brain of the pilot.  The pilot was Lieutenant Charles Wandek, UNRC, home address: 1677 Anstey Avenue, Detroit. He did not survive the crash of his ferry into Wheel Five. Neither did his three passengers, a young French astrophysicist, an East Indian expert on magnetic fields, and a forty-year-old man from Philadelphia who was coming out to replace a pump technician.  Someone else who did not survive was Reed Kieran, the only man in Wheel Five itself to lose his life. Kieran, who was thirty-six years old, was an accredited scientist-employee of UNRC. Home address: 815 Elm Street, Midland Springs, Ohio.  Kieran, despite the fact that he was a confirmed bachelor, was in Wheel Five because of a woman. But the woman who had sent him there was no beautiful lost love. Her name was Gertrude Lemmiken; she was nineteen years old and overweight, with a fat, stupid face. She suffered from head-colds, and sniffed constantly in the Ohio college classroom where Kieran taught Physics Two.  One March morning, Kieran could bear it no longer. He told himself, \"If she sniffs this morning, I'm through. I'll resign and join the UNRC.\"  Gertrude sniffed. Six months later, having finished his training for the United Nations Reconnaissance Corps, Kieran shipped out for a term of duty in UNRC Space Laboratory Number 5, known more familiarly as Wheel Five.  Wheel Five circled the Moon. There was an elaborate base on the surface of the Moon in this year 1981. There were laboratories and observatories there, too. But it had been found that the alternating fortnights of boiling heat and near-absolute-zero cold on the lunar surface could play havoc with the delicate instruments used in certain researches. Hence Wheel Five had been built and was staffed by research men who were rotated at regular eight-month intervals.         *       *       *       *       *  Kieran loved it, from the first. He thought that that was because of the sheer beauty of it, the gaunt, silver deaths-head of the Moon forever turning beneath, the still and solemn glory of the undimmed stars, the filamentaries stretched across the distant star-clusters like shining veils, the quietness, the peace.  But Kieran had a certain intellectual honesty, and after a while he admitted to himself that neither the beauty nor the romance of it was what made this life so attractive to him. It was the fact that he was far away from Earth. He did not even have to look at Earth, for nearly all geophysical research was taken care of by Wheels Two and Three that circled the mother planet. He was almost completely divorced from all Earth's problems and people.  Kieran liked people, but had never felt that he understood them. What seemed important to them, all the drives of ordinary day-to-day existence, had never seemed very important to him. He had felt that there must be something wrong with him, something lacking, for it seemed to him that people everywhere committed the most outlandish follies, believed in the most incredible things, were swayed by pure herd-instinct into the most harmful courses of behavior. They could not all be wrong, he thought, so he must be wrong--and it had worried him. He had taken partial refuge in pure science, but the study and then the teaching of astrophysics had not been the refuge that Wheel Five was. He would be sorry to leave the Wheel when his time was up.  And he was sorry, when the day came. The others of the staff were already out in the docking lock in the rim, waiting to greet the replacements from the ferry. Kieran, hating to leave, lagged behind. Then, realizing it would be churlish not to meet this young Frenchman who was replacing him, he hurried along the corridor in the big spoke when he saw the ferry coming in.  He was two-thirds of the way along the spoke to the rim when it happened. There was a tremendous crash that flung him violently from his feet. He felt a coldness, instant and terrible.  He was dying.  He was dead.  The ferry had been coming in on a perfectly normal approach when the tiny something went wrong, in the ship or in the judgment of the pilot. Its drive-rockets suddenly blasted on full, it heeled over sharply, it smashed through the big starboard spoke like a knife through butter.  Wheel Five staggered, rocked, and floundered. The automatic safety bulkheads had all closed, and the big spoke--Section T2--was the only section to blow its air, and Kieran was the only man caught in it. The alarms went off, and while the wreckage of the ferry, with three dead men in it, was still drifting close by, everyone in the Wheel was in his pressure-suit and emergency measures were in full force.         *       *       *       *       *  Within thirty minutes it became evident that the Wheel was going to survive this accident. It was edging slowly out of orbit from the impetus of the blow, and in the present weakened state of the construction its small corrective rockets could not be used to stop the drift. But Meloni, the UNRC captain commanding, had got first reports from his damage-control teams, and it did not look too bad. He fired off peremptory demands for the repair materials he would need, and was assured by UNRC headquarters at Mexico City that the ferries would be loaded and on their way as soon as possible.  Meloni was just beginning to relax a little when a young officer brought up a minor but vexing problem. Lieutenant Vinson had headed the small party sent out to recover the bodies of the four dead men. In their pressure-suits they had been pawing through the tangled wreckage for some time, and young Vinson was tired when he made his report.  \"We have all four alongside, sir. The three men in the ferry were pretty badly mangled in the crash. Kieran wasn't physically wounded, but died from space-asphyxiation.\"  The captain stared at him. \"Alongside? Why didn't you bring them in? They'll go back in one of the ferries to Earth for burial.\"  \"But--\" Vinson started to protest.  Meloni interrupted sharply. \"You need to learn a few things about morale, Lieutenant. You think it's going to do morale here any good to have four dead men floating alongside where everyone can see them? Fetch them in and store them in one of the holds.\"  Vinson, sweating and unhappy now, had visions of a black mark on his record, and determined to make his point.  \"But about Kieran, sir--he was only frozen. Suppose there was a chance to bring him back?\"  \"Bring him back? What the devil are you talking about?\"  Vinson said, \"I read they're trying to find some way of restoring a man that gets space-frozen. Some scientists down at Delhi University. If they succeeded, and if we had Kieran still intact in space--\"  \"Oh, hell, that's just a scientific pipe-dream, they'll never find a way to do that,\" Meloni said. \"It's all just theory.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Vinson, hanging his head.  \"We've got trouble enough here without you bringing up ideas like this,\" the captain continued angrily. \"Get out of here.\"  Vinson was now completely crushed. \"Yes, sir. I'll bring the bodies in.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He went out. Meloni stared at the door, and began to think. A commanding officer had to be careful, or he could get skinned alive. If, by some remote chance, this Delhi idea ever succeeded, he, Meloni, would be in for it for having Kieran buried. He strode to the door and flung it open, mentally cursing the young snotty who had had to bring this up.  \"Vinson!\" he shouted.  The lieutenant turned back, startled. \"Yes, sir?\"  \"Hold Kieran's body outside. I'll check on this with Mexico City.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Still angry, Meloni shot a message to Personnel at Mexico City. That done, he forgot about it. The buck had been passed, let the boys sitting on their backsides down on Earth handle it.  Colonel Hausman, second in command of Personnel Division of UNRC, was the man to whom Meloni's message went. He snorted loudly when he read it. And later, when he went in to report to Garces, the brigadier commanding the Division, he took the message with him.  \"Meloni must be pretty badly rattled by the crash,\" he said. \"Look at this.\"  Garces read the message, then looked up. \"Anything to this? The Delhi experiments, I mean?\"  Hausman had taken care to brief himself on that point and was able to answer emphatically.  \"Damned little. Those chaps in Delhi have been playing around freezing insects and thawing them out, and they think the process might be developed someday to where it could revive frozen spacemen. It's an iffy idea. I'll burn Meloni's backside off for bringing it up at a time like this.\"  Garces, after a moment, shook his head. \"No, wait. Let me think about this.\"  He looked speculatively out of the window for a few moments. Then he said,  \"Message Meloni that this one chap's body--what's his name, Kieran?--is to be preserved in space against a chance of future revival.\"  Hausman nearly blotted his copybook by exclaiming, \"For God's sake--\" He choked that down in time and said, \"But it could be centuries before a revival process is perfected, if it ever is.\"  Garces nodded. \"I know. But you're missing a psychological point that could be valuable to UNRC. This Kieran has relatives, doesn't he?\"  Hausman nodded. \"A widowed mother and a sister. His father's been dead a long time. No wife or children.\"  Garces said, \"If we tell them he's dead, frozen in space and then buried, it's all over with. Won't those people feel a lot better if we tell them that he's _apparently_ dead, but might be brought back when a revival-technique is"]]]
