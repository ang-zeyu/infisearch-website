Four revolutions were completed within five minutes of the same average rate of 1 hr. 51 m.; so that this species moves more quickly than the others of the genus.  The shoots, when placed near a vertical stick, either twine round it, or clasp it with the basal portions of their petioles.  The leaves whilst young are nearly of the same shape as those of _C. viticella_, and act in the same manner like a hook, as will be described under that species.  But the leaflets are more divided, and each segment whilst young terminates in a hardish point, which is much curved downwards and inwards; so that the whole leaf readily catches hold of any neighbouring object.  The petioles of the young terminal leaflets are acted on by loops of thread weighing ⅛th and even 0.0625th of a grain.  The basal portion of the main petiole is much less sensitive, but will clasp a stick against which it presses.  The leaves, whilst young, are continually and spontaneously moving slowly.  A bell-glass was placed over a shoot secured to a stick, and the movements of the leaves were traced on it during several days.  A very irregular line was generally formed; but one day, in the course of eight hours and three quarters, the figure clearly represented three and a half irregular ellipses, the most perfect one of which was completed in 2 hrs. 35 m.  The two opposite leaves moved independently of each other.  This movement of the leaves would aid that of the internodes in bringing the petioles into contact with surrounding objects.  I discovered this movement too late to be enabled to observe it in the other species; but from analogy I can hardly doubt that the leaves of at least _C. viticella_, _C. flammula_, and _C. vitalba_ move spontaneously; and, judging from _C. Sieboldi_, this probably is the case with _C. montana_ and _C. calycina_.  I ascertained that the simple leaves of _C. glandulosa_ exhibited no spontaneous revolving movement.  _Clematis viticella_, var. _venosa_.—In this and the two following species the power of spirally twining is completely lost, and this seems due to the lessened flexibility of the internodes and to the interference caused by the large size of the leaves.  But the revolving movement, though restricted, is not lost.  In our present species a young internode, placed in front of a window, made three narrow ellipses, transversely to the direction of the light, at an average rate of 2 hrs. 40 m.  When placed so that the movements were to and from the light, the rate was greatly accelerated in one half of the course, and retarded in the other, as with twining plants.  The ellipses were small; the longer diameter, described by the apex of a shoot bearing a pair of not expanded leaves, was only 4⅝ inches, and that by the apex of the penultimate internode only 1⅛ inch.  At the most favourable period of growth each leaf would hardly be carried to and fro by the movement of the internodes more than two or three inches, but, as above stated, it is probable that the leaves themselves move spontaneously.  The movement of the whole shoot by the wind and by its rapid growth, would probably be almost equally efficient as these spontaneous movements, in bringing the petioles into contact with surrounding objects.  The leaves are of large size.  Each bears three pairs of lateral leaflets and a terminal one, all supported on rather long sub-petioles.  The main petiole bends a little angularly downwards at each point where a pair of leaflets arises (see fig. 2), and the petiole of the terminal leaflet is bent downwards at right angles; hence the whole petiole, with its rectangularly bent extremity, acts as a hook.  This hook, the lateral petioles being directed a little upwards; forms an excellent grappling apparatus, by which the leaves readily become entangled with surrounding objects.  If they catch nothing, the whole petiole ultimately grows straight.  The main petiole, the sub-petioles, and the three branches into which each basi-lateral sub-petiole is generally subdivided, are all sensitive.  The basal portion of the main petiole, between the stem and the first pair of leaflets, is less sensitive than the remainder; it will, however, clasp a stick with which it is left in contact.  The inferior surface of the rectangularly bent terminal portion (carrying the terminal leaflet), which forms the inner side of the end of the hook, is the most sensitive part; and this portion is manifestly best adapted to catch a distant support.  To show the difference in sensibility, I gently placed loops of string of the same weight (in one instance weighing only 0.82 of a grain or 53.14 mg.) on the several lateral sub-petioles and on the terminal one; in a few hours the latter was bent, but after 24 hrs. no effect was produced on the other sub-petioles.  Again, a terminal sub-petiole placed in contact with a thin stick became sensibly curved in 45 m., and in 1 hr. 10 m. moved through ninety degrees; whilst a lateral sub-petiole did not become sensibly curved until 3 hrs. 30 m. had elapsed.  In all cases, if the sticks are taken away, the petioles continue to move during many hours afterwards; so they do after a slight rubbing; but they become straight again, after about a day’s interval, that is if the flexure has not been very great or long continued.            [Picture: Fig. 2.  A young leaf of Clematis viticeela]  The graduated difference in the extension of the sensitiveness in the petioles of the above-described species deserves notice.  In _C. montana_ it is confined to the main petiole, and has not spread to the sub-petioles of the three leaflets; so it is with young plants of _C. calycina_, but in older plants it spreads to the three sub-petioles.  In _C. viticella_ the sensitiveness has spread to the petioles of the seven leaflets, and to the subdivisions of the basi-lateral sub-petioles.  But in this latter species it has diminished in the basal part of the main petiole, in which alone it resided in _C. montana_; whilst it has increased in the abruptly bent terminal portion.  _Clematis flammula_.—The rather thick, straight, and stiff shoots, whilst growing vigorously in the spring, make small oval revolutions, following the sun in their course.  Four were made at an average rate of 3 hrs. 45 m.  The longer axis of the oval, described by the extreme tip, was directed at right angles to the line joining the opposite leaves; its length was in one case only 1⅜, and in another case 1¾ inch; so that the young leaves were moved a very short distance.  The shoots of the same plant observed in midsummer, when growing not so quickly, did not revolve at all.  I cut down another plant in the early summer, so that by August 1st it had formed new and moderately vigorous shoots; these, when observed under a bell-glass, were on some days quite stationary, and on other days moved to and fro only about the eighth of an inch. Consequently the revolving power is much enfeebled in this species, and under unfavourable circumstances is completely lost.  The shoot must depend for coming into contact with surrounding objects on the probable, though not ascertained spontaneous movement of the leaves, on rapid growth, and on movement from the wind.  Hence, perhaps, it is that the petioles have acquired a high degree of sensitiveness as a compensation for the little power of movement in the shoots.  The petioles are bowed downwards, and have the same general hook-like form as in _C. viticella_.  The medial petiole and the lateral sub-petioles are sensitive, especially the much bent terminal portion. As the sensitiveness is here greater than in any other species of the genus observed by me, and is in itself remarkable, I will give fuller details.  The petioles, when so young that they have not separated from one another, are not sensitive; when the lamina of a leaflet has grown to a quarter of an inch in length (that is, about one-sixth of its full size), the sensitiveness is highest; but at this period the petioles are relatively much more fully developed than are the blades of the leaves. Full-grown petioles are not in the least sensitive.  A thin stick placed so as to press lightly against a petiole, having a leaflet a quarter of an inch in length, caused the petiole to bend in 3 hrs. 15 m.  In another case a petiole curled completely round a stick in 12 hrs. These petioles were left curled for 24 hrs., and the sticks were then removed; but they never straightened themselves.  I took a twig, thinner than the petiole itself, and with it lightly rubbed several petioles four times up and down; these in 1 hr. 45 m. became slightly curled; the curvature increased during some hours and then began to decrease, but after 25 hrs. from the time of rubbing a vestige of the curvature remained.  Some other petioles similarly rubbed twice, that is, once up and once down, became perceptibly curved in about 2 hrs. 30 m., the terminal sub-petiole moving more than the lateral sub-petioles; they all became straight again in between 12 hrs. and 14 hrs.  Lastly, a length of about one-eighth of an inch of a sub-petiole, was lightly rubbed with the same twig only once; it became slightly curved in 3 hrs., remaining so during 11 hrs., but by the next morning was quite straight.  The following observations are more precise.  After trying heavier pieces of string and thread, I placed a loop of fine string, weighing 1.04 gr. (67.4 mg.) on a terminal sub-petiole: in 6 hrs. 40 m. a curvature could be seen; in 24 hrs. the petiole formed an open ring round the string; in 48 hrs. the ring had almost closed on the string, and in 72 hrs. seized it so firmly, that some force was necessary for its withdrawal.  A loop weighing 0.52 of a grain (33.7 mg.) caused in 14 hrs. a lateral sub-petiole just perceptibly to curve, and in 24 hrs. it moved through ninety degrees.  These observations were made during the summer: the following were made in the spring, when the petioles apparently are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],["title","The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Midnight Pool: Animals Drinking]                        HEATH SUPPLEMENTARY READERS                                THE WONDERS OF                                THE JUNGLE                             PRINCE SARATH GHOSH                                  BOOK ONE                              D.

C. HEATH & CO.         *       *       *       *       *     PREFACE   One of the great thinkers of the world has said that all the sciences are embodied in natural history. Hence natural history should be taught to a child from an early age.  Perhaps the best method of teaching it is to set forth the characteristics of animals in the form of a narrative. Then the child reads the narrative with pleasure and almost as a story, not as a tedious \"lesson.\"  I have followed that method in the Wonders of the Jungle. The present work (Book One) is intended to be a supplementary reader for the earlier grades in grammar schools. If it be found useful, I shall write one or two more books in progressive order for the use of higher grades.  In Book One I have depicted only such wild animals as appeal to the interest of young children, and even to their sympathy and love. In subsequent books I shall describe the animals that prey upon others. As those animals are not lovable, it would be better for the child to read about them a year or two later. But even to those animals I shall be just, and shall depict their good qualities as well as their preying habits. How many people know that the very worst animal, the tiger, is a better husband and father than many men? Or that the ferocity of the tigress is prompted entirely by her maternal instinct--and that in every case of unusual ferocity yet recorded it was afterward found that there was a helpless cub somewhere near? Hence in subsequent books I shall enter more fully into the causes of animal instincts and characteristics--their loves and their hates and their fears.  Regarding the scheme of Book One, the animals are described in their daily life, and the main scientific facts and principles concerning each animal are woven into the narrative as a part of that daily life. But while teaching science to the child in that pleasant form, a few other purposes have also been kept in view:--  1. To cultivate the child's imagination. True imagination is the ability to visualize mentally the realities of life, not what is unreal--for which it is so often mistaken. Hence in this book the child is helped to visualize the animals in their actual haunts, and to see each incident as it actually happens.  2. To cultivate the child's reasoning faculty. The child is encouraged at every step to think and to reason why the animal does certain things; _e.g._ why the elephant does not drink directly with its mouth, but has to squirt the water into it with the trunk.  3. To teach a moral from the study of animals. The whole of Creation is one immense and beautiful pattern: so the child may well be trained to see the pattern in this also. And as a practical benefit from the study of animals, the child may learn thereby the value of certain qualities, such as obedience, discipline, and good citizenship--_e.g._ as in the remarkable case of the elephant, the buffalo, and the flamingo, as described in the text. In this regard I have kept in mind the very useful suggestions formulated a few years ago by the Moral Education League of Great Britain, under the patronage of Queen Mary, five of whose children at that time ranged in age from seven to fifteen. One of the functions of education is to present to the child the noblest and the most elevated of ideals. I have sought to do that in almost every chapter.  I have to acknowledge my obligation to the New York Kindergarten Association for its valuable cooperation in putting this book through a practical test. The Kindergarten Association on more than one occasion provided me with a large audience of children, ranging in age from six to nine, ex-pupils of the Association, who are now in the public schools.

You have seen many animals in the zoo or in a circus--elephants, bears, lions, tigers, leopards, and many others. But the jungle is the place where these animals live before they are brought to the zoo or the circus.  In fact, _jungle_ really means a _wild place_; that is, a place where trees and bushes grow quite wild, so that men never cut down the trees or clear away the bushes. That is the natural home for all sorts of animals.  Now I am going to tell you about the wonderful way in which they live there with their families, as we do in our homes; for the Papas and Mammas among the animals are just as fond of their children as ours are. So you must _imagine_ that you are going into the jungle with me, so that I can show you everything. You see, it is just like a game of _pretending_, that we are going to play.  There is actually a place in the jungle where you can see all the animals at once. In fact, that place is so wonderful that King George and Queen Mary of England went to see it; that was a few years ago, when they went to India, which is a far-away country. For in India there is a huge jungle where many thousands of animals live.  So you must _pretend_ that I am taking you to the Royal party, and that you are sitting with the King and Queen and all the fine men and lovely ladies; and we are watching the animals, while I tell you all about them.  First, I must tell you that it is midnight, and all the animals are coming to a stream of water to drink. This stream is a river about twice as wide as a large street in your home town. We are sitting on the bank, on one side of the stream; and the animals are coming to drink on the bank on the other side.  \"But,\" you may say, \"will not the animals see us across the stream, and get frightened and run away?\"  That is quite true. But the King and Queen had thought of that. So they ordered a lot of men to put a large net on their side of the stream, just in front of them, and then to cover the net with twigs and leaves so cleverly that the animals thought the leaves were a part of the jungle, and did not see the people on the other side of the net.  So the King and Queen, and you and I, can peep quietly through the leaves and watch the animals. Almost all wild animals drink at midnight; so we shall see them now.  Where will the animals come from? You see the stream before us; well, on the other side of it is the jungle, where the animals live. Right in front of us we see a gap in the jungle close to the bank. That gap was made by _elephants_ by beating down the bushes with their feet. They made it long ago to come to the water, and now they use it every night. In fact, it is known among the jungle folks as the _Elephant Path_; for no other animal would dare to use it before the elephants did.  The elephants, being the biggest of all animals, are the _lords of the jungle_; so they have the right to come first to drink. They are also the wisest of all animals. You have seen many kinds of animals--elephants, horses, dogs, monkeys, and others--do funny"]]]
