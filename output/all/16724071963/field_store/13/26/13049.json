Now she had a great many presents that summer, but none that pleased her half so well as the little pet pig.     CHAPTER VIII  PRUDY FISHING   One morning, after Prudy was quite well, aunt Madge told her she might go into the garden and get some currants. While she was picking with all her might, and breathing very fast, she saw Horace close by, on the other side of the fence, with a pole in his hand.  \"I thought you was to school!\" cried Prudy.  \"Well, I ain't,\" said Horace, pulling his hat over his eyes, and looking ashamed. \"The teacher don't keep no order, and I won't go to such a school, so there!\"  \"They don't want _me_ to go,\" said Prudy, \"'cause I should know too much. I can say all my letters now, right down straight, 'thout looking on, either.\"  \"O, ho!\" cried Horace, trailing his long pole, \"you can't say 'em skipping about, and I shouldn't care, if I was you. But you ought to know how to fish, Miss. Don't you wish you could drop in your line, and catch 'em the way I do?\"  \"Do they like to have you catch 'em?\" said Prudy, dropping her little dipper, and going to the fence; \"don't it hurt?\"  \"Hurt? Not as I know of. They needn't bite if they don't want to.\"  \"No,\" returned Prudy, looking very wise, \"I s'pose they want to get out, and that's why they bite. Of course when fishes stay in the water much it makes 'em drown.\"  \"O, my stars!\" cried Horace, laughing, \"you ought to live 'out west,' you're such a cunning little spud. Come, now, here's another fish-pole for you. I'll show you how to catch one, and I bet 'twill be a pollywog--you're just big enough.\"  \"But grandma didn't say I might go down to the river. Wait till I go ask her.\"  \"Poh!\" said Horace, \"no you needn't; I have to hurry. Grandma _always_ likes it when you go with me, Prudy, because you see I'm a boy, and she knows I can take care of you twice as well as Grace and Susy can.\"  \"O,\" cried Prudy, clapping her little hands, \"they won't any of 'em know I can fish, and how they'll laugh. But there, now, they don't let me climb the fence--I forgot.\"  \"Well, give us your bonnet, and then you 'scooch' down, and I'll pull you through.\"  \"There,\" said the naughty boy, when they had got down to the river, \"now I've been and put a bait on the end of your hook, and I plump it in the water--so. You just hold on to the pole.\"  \"But it jiggles--it tips me!\" cried Prudy; and as she spoke she fell face downwards on the bank.  \"Well, that's smart!\" said Horace, picking her up. \"There, you sit down next time, and I'll prop up the pole with a rock--this way. There, now, you hold it a little easy, and when you feel a nibble you let me know.\"  \"What's a nibble?\" asked Prudy, shaking the line.  \"A nibble? Why, it's a bite.\"  They sat quite still for some minutes, the hot sun glaring on Prudy's bare head with its rings of soft golden hair.  \"Now, now!\" cried she suddenly, \"I've got a nibble!\"  Horace sprang to draw up her line.  \"I feel it right here on my neck,\" said the child; \"I s'pose it's a fly.\"  \"Now, look here,\" said Horace, rather vexed, \"you're a little too bad. You made me drop my line just when I was going to have a nibble. Wait till you feel the string wiggle, and then speak, but don't scream.\"  The children sat still for a few minutes longer, and no sound was heard but now and then a wagon going over the bridge. But they might as well have dropped their lines in the sand for all the fish they caught. Horace began to wish he had gone to school.  \"O dear!\" groaned Prudy, getting tired, \"I never did see such fishes. I guess they don't want to be catched.\"  \"There, now you've spoke again, and scared one away,\" said Horace. \"If it hadn't been for you I should have got, I don't know how many, by this time.\"  Prudy's lip began to tremble, and two big round tears rose to her eyes.  \"Poh! crying about that?\" said Horace; \"you're a nice little girl if you do talk too much, so don't you cry.\"  Horace rather enjoyed seeing Grace and Susy in tears, but could never bear to have Prudy cry.  \"I'll tell you what it is,\" said Horace, when Prudy's eyes were clear again, \"I don't think I make much playing hookey.\"  \"I don't like playing 'hookey' neither,\" returned Prudy, \"'cause the hooks won't catch 'em.\"  \"O, you don't know what I mean,\" laughed Horace. \"When we boys 'out west' stay out of school, we call _that_ playing hookey.\"  \"O, do you? But I want to go home now, if we can't catch any nibbles.\"  \"No, I'll tell you what we'll do--we'll walk out on that log, and try it there.\"  The river was quite high, and this was one of the logs that had drifted down from the \"Rips.\" Prudy was really afraid to walk on it, because it was \"so round,\" but not liking to be laughed at, she crept on her hands and knees to the very end of the log, trembling all the way.  Horace took the two poles and followed; but the moment he stepped on the log it rolled quite over, carrying Prudy under.  I do not know what Horace thought then, but he had to think fast. If he had been older he might have plunged in after Prudy, but he was only a little boy, seven years old, so he ran for the house. O, how he ran!  Aunt Madge was ironing in the back kitchen. She heard heavy breathing, and the quick pattering of feet, and the words gasped out, \"Prudy's in the river!\"  \"Prudy!\" screamed aunt Madge, looking wildly at the boy's face, which was as white as death.  \"Run, tell grandpa!\" cried she, and flew down the steps, and out across the field towards the river, as if she had wings on her slippers, though it seemed to her they were clogged with lead.  \"Has she just been saved from death only to be drowned?\" was one of the quick thoughts that rushed across aunt Madge's dizzy brain. \"I shall be too late! too late! And her mother gone! God forgive me! It is I who should have watched her!\"  Poor aunt Madge! as if any one was to blame but Horace.  There was a child crying down by the river.  \"Not Prudy,\" thought aunt Madge. \"It sounds like her voice, but it can't be. She has sunk by this time!\"  \"Don't be afraid, Prudy!\" cried Mr. Allen, who was just behind aunt Madge, \"we are running to you.\"  The cry came up louder: it was Prudy's voice.  Mr. Allen leaped the fence at a bound, and ran down the bank. The child was out of the water, struggling to climb the bank, but slipping back at every step. She was dripping wet, and covered with sand.  Mr. Allen lifted her in his arms, and there she lay, sobbing as if her heart would break, but not speaking a word.  When she was lying, clean and warm, in soft blankets, and had had a nap, she told them how she got out.  \"The log kept jiggling,\" said she, \"and I couldn't hold on, but I did. I thought my father would say I was a nice little girl not to get drowned, and let the fishes eat me up, and so I kept a-holdin' on.\"  \"Only think,\" said grandma, shuddering, and looking at Horace, \"if Prudy hadn't held on!\"  Horace seemed very sad and humble, and was still quite pale.  \"It makes you feel mortified, don't it, 'Race?\" said Prudy, smiling; \"don't you feel as if you could cry?\"  At these first words little Prudy had spoken to him since she fell into the water, the boy ran out of the room, and hid in the green chamber, for he never would let any one see him cry.  \"O, won't you forgive him?\" said Prudy, looking up into Mrs. Clifford's face; \"won't you forgive him, aunt 'Ria? he feels so bad; and he didn't catch a fish, and he didn't mean to,--and--'twas the log that jiggled.\"  So Horace was forgiven for Prudy's sake.     CHAPTER IX  THE HATCHET STORY   One night the children clustered about their aunt Madge, begging for a story.  \"Fairy, you know,\" said Susy.  \"A fairy story?\" repeated aunt Madge. \"I don't know about that. I told a little boy a fairy story once, and he went right off and whispered to his mother that I was a very wicked lady, for that story wasn't true, not a bit; and if a baby six months old should hear it, he wouldn't believe a word of it!\"  \"Poh! he was a smart boy,\" cried Horace.  \"So I am afraid to tell fairy stories since that, for I don't like to be called a wicked lady, you know.\"  \"There, now, auntie,\" said Susy, \"don't you s'pose we know they're only play-stories? Just as if we hadn't a speck of sense!\"  \"Well, let me see,\" said aunt Madge, covering her eyes with her fingers. \"Once upon a time when the moon was full----\"  \"Full of what?\" said Prudy, who was leaning on the arm of her auntie's chair, and peeping up into her face, \"full of fairies?\"  \"When the moon was round, my child,\" said auntie, stroking the little one's hair. \"But wait. I'll tell a story Prudy can understand--wouldn't you, my dears? When I was a little girl----\"  [Illustration: AUNT MADGE TELLING A STORY.]  \"That's right,\" cried the children. \"O, tell about that.\"  \"Was you about as big as me?\" said Prudy, \"and was your name _little Madge_?\"  \"Yes, they called me little Madge sometimes, and sometimes Maggie. When I was about as old as our Susy, I happened to go into the back-room one day, and saw uncle Edward's hatchet lying on the meat-block. I knew I had no right to touch it, but it came into my head that I would try to break open the clams. The hatchet, instead of cracking the shells, came down with full force on my foot! I had on thick boots, but it cut through my right boot deep into the bone. O, how I screamed!\"  \"I should have thought you would, auntie,\" cried Grace, fairly turning pale. \"Did it bring the blood?\"  \"Yes, indeed! Why, when I went into the kitchen, my footsteps were tracked with little pools of blood, oozing out of my boot. Sister Maria screamed out,--'O, look at Maggie! She's cut her foot with that hatchet!'\"  \"'No, no, I haven't,' said I, for I was frightened almost to death, and afraid of being punished for disobedience. You see father had forbidden us little ones ever to touch the hatchet.\"  \"Why, you told a right up and down----fib,\" said Susy, looking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24711"],["title","Little Prudy (#6)"],["body","cked.  \"A real whopper,\" said Horace, shaking his head.  \"So I did, children, and before my story is done you shall see what misery my sin caused me.\"  \"Did Mr. 'Gustus Allen know about it?\" asked little Prudy.  \"I guess not,\" replied aunt Madge, blushing. \"He lived ever so far off then.\"  \"O dear,\" sighed Prudy, \"I wish he hadn't gone to the wars. How it made you cry!\"  \"Hush up, please, can't you, Prudy?\" said Susy. \"Aunt Madge is telling a story.\"  \"Well, they sent for the doctor in great haste, and then tried to pull off my boot; but my foot was so badly swollen, and bleeding so fast, that it took a great while. I can't tell how long, for I fainted. When the doctor saw the wound they said he looked very sober.\"  \"'So, so, little girl,' said he (that was after I came to myself), 'you thought you'd make me a good job while you were about it. There's no half-way work about you. You are the child that had the tip of a finger clipped off in the corn-sheller, hey?'\"  \"I was always afraid of Dr. Foster, so I only buried my face in my apron, and cried.\"  \"'She must have brought the hatchet down with a great deal of force,' said the doctor. 'See, Mrs. Parlin, how deep it went into the bone.'\"  \"'I fell and hit my foot,' I sobbed out. 'I never _touched_ the hatchet!'\"  \"I knew well enough that the doctor didn't believe me.\"  \"'So, so,' said he. 'Very well, never mind how 'twas done, but keep your foot still, little one, and we'll talk about the hatchet another time. Mrs. Parlin, if it goes to bleeding again, be sure to send for me.'\"  \"It was ever so long before I could walk a step. Every time any body spoke of my hurt, I said, 'Why, I was just coming into the house with those clams, and my foot slipped, and I fell and hit me on something. I don't know whether it was a hatchet or a stick of wood; but I never touched the hatchet!'\"  \"There, I shouldn't have thought that of _you_, auntie,\" said Grace.  \"Poh!\" cried Horace, \"they must have known you was a-foolin'; of course they did!\"  \"Well, every time the doctor came to see me, he laughed and asked me how I cut my foot.\"  \"'Just the same as I did in the first place, you know,' said I. 'I don't know nothing about it, only I never touched the hatchet!'\"  \"'Well,' he would answer, 'you remember the old saying, A lie well stuck to, is better than the truth wavering.'\"  \"I didn't know what that meant, but he laughed so that I knew he was making sport of me. I knew nobody believed me. The hatchet had been found red with blood, and mother looked, O, so sad! but I had told that falsehood so many times that it did seem as if I hadn't any courage left to tell the truth. It had grown to be very easy to keep saying, I never _touched_ the hatchet.'\"  \"Makes me think of that play, 'My father's lost his hatchet,'\" whispered Susy to Grace.  \"Every one tried to amuse me while I was sick, but there was always a thorn in my pillow.\"  \"A thorn?\" said Prudy.  \"Not a real thorn, dear. I mean I had told a wrong story, and I couldn't feel happy.\"  Here Susy turned away her head and looked out of the window, though she saw nothing there but grandpa coming in from the garden with a watering-pot.  \"Whenever father looked at me, I felt just as if he was thinking, 'Margaret doesn't tell the truth;' and when mother spoke my name quick, I was afraid she was going to say something about the hatchet.\"  \"I got well, only I limped a little. Then it was almost time to think of making presents for the Christmas tree. I didn't like to have Christmas come while I was feeling so. People are so good that day, I thought. That is the time when every body loves you, and spends money for you. I wanted to confess, and feel _clean_; but then I had told that lie over so many times that I thought I _couldn't_ take it back.\"  \"I talked it over with myself a great while though, and at last said I, 'I _will_; I'll do it!' First, I asked God to forgive me and help me, and when I had got as far as that, the thing was half done, children.\"  \"I went into the parlor where your grandfather was--he wasn't deaf then. I thought I should choke; but I caught hold of one of the buttons on his coat, and spoke as fast as I could.\"  \"'O father,' said I, 'I've told more than a hundred thousand lies. I _did_ take that hatchet! Will you forgive me?'\"  \"Did he?\" asked Susy.  \"Forgive! I guess he did! My dear child, it was just what he had been waiting to do! And, O, I can tell you he talked to me in such a way about the awful sin of lying, that I never, never forgot it, and shan't, if I live to be a hundred years old.\"  \"My father had forgiven me: I was sure God had forgiven me too; and after that, I felt as if I could look people in the face once more, and I had a splendid time Christmas.--I believe that's about all the _story_ there is to it, children.\"  \"Well,\" said Grace, \"I'm much obliged to you, auntie; I think it's just as nice as a fairy story--don't you, Susy?\"  \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" replied Susy, looking confused. \"See here, auntie, I've lost your gold ring!\"  \"My ring?\" said aunt Madge. \"I forgot that I let you take it.\"  \"Don't you know I asked you for it when you stood by the table making bread? and it slipped off my finger this afternoon into the water barrel!\"  \"Why, Susy!\"  \"And I was a coward, and didn't dare tell you, auntie. I thought maybe you'd forget I had it, and some time when you asked for it, I was going to say, 'Hadn't you better take a pair of tongs and see if it isn't in the water barrel?'\"  \"O, Susy!\" said aunt Madge.  \"She isn't any worse than me, auntie,\" said Grace. \"Ma asked me how the mud came on my handkerchief, and I said Prudy wiped my boots with it. And so she did, auntie, but I told her to; and wasn't I such a coward for laying it off on little Prudy? I am ashamed--you may believe I am.\"  \"I am glad you have told me the whole truth now,\" replied aunt Madge, \"though it does make me feel sad, too, for it's too much like my hatchet story. O, do remember from this time, children, and never, never, _dare_ be _cowards_ again!\"  Just then grandpa Parlin came to the door with a sad face, saying,--  \"Margaret, please come up stairs, and see if you can soothe poor little Harry by singing. He is so restless that neither Maria nor I can do any thing with him.\"  This baby, Horace's brother, was sick all the time now, and once in a while Margaret's sweet voice would charm him to sleep when every thing else failed.     CHAPTER X  MORE STORIES   \"I move we have some more stories,\" said Horace the next evening, as they were sitting in the twilight. \"It's your turn, Gracie.\"  \"Well, I don't know but I'd as soon tell a story as not,\" replied Grace, pushing back her curls; \"I reckon Pincher wants to hear one, he begins to wag his tail. I can't make up any thing as I go along, but I can tell a sober, true story.\"  \"Certain true, black and blue?\" asked Prudy, who always _would_ have something to say, whether she knew what she was talking about or not.  \"Didn't I ever tell you about our school-dog out West, aunt Madge? You see it was so queer. I don't know where in the world he came from. He had one of his eyes put out, and was 'most blind out of the other, and only a stump of a tail, and didn't know how to get his living like other dogs.\"  \"O dear, it was so funny he should take it into his head to come to school, now wasn't it, auntie? He knew Miss All'n just as well as could be, and used to go with the rest of the scholars to meet her every morning; and when she patted him on the head, and said 'Good old doggie,' it did seem like he'd fly out of his wits.\"  \"Then when she rang the bell he trotted in just as proud, hanging down his head as meek as could be. He thought she rang the bell for him as much as any of the rest of the scholars. His seat was right by the stove on the floor--it _wasn't_ a seat, I mean; and he just lay there the whole living time, and slept and snored--you see he was so old, auntie! But then we all loved him, we just loved him so! O dear me, it's as much as I can do to keep from crying, and I don't know how _any body_ could help it!\"  \"What was I talking about--O, he used to walk round under the seats just as sly sometimes, and put his nose into the dinner baskets. I tell you he liked cake, that dog did, and he liked meat and mince pie. You see he could _smell_, for his nose was as good as ever it was, and the girls used to cry sometimes when he picked out the nice things.\"  \"But then we just loved him so, you know, auntie! Why, we thought he was just as good as any body. He never bit nor growled, that dog didn't, not a mite. There wasn't one of us but he loved,--'specially Miss All'n.\"  \"Now wasn't it too bad Mrs. Snell made such a fuss? She didn't love that dog one speck,--I don't know as she ever saw him,--and she didn't care whether he was dead or alive. I just know she didn't.\"  \"I'll tell you how it was. Sometimes he got locked up all night. He'd be asleep, you know, by the stove, or else under the seats, and Miss All'n would forget, and suppose he was gone with the rest of the scholars.\"  \"Well, he was a darling old dog, if he _did_ chew up the books! I just about know he got hungry in the night, or he never would have thought of it. How did _he_ know it was wrong? he didn't know one letter from another. He spoiled Jenny Snell's spelling-book, I know, and lots of readers and things; but what if he did, auntie, now what of it?\"  \"I ain't crying any thing about that, I wouldn't have you to think! But you see Mrs. Snell made a great fuss, and went to her husband and told him he ought to be shot.\"  \"That Mr. Snell ought to be shot?\"  \"Now, Susy, I shouldn't think you'd feel like laughing or making fun.--The dog, of _course_; and they sent for the city marshal. You know Mr. Garvin, Horace?\"  \"Yes, the man that scowls so, with the scar on his nose, and a horse-whip in his hand.\"  \"Miss All'n cried. She lifted up the lid of her desk, and hid her head, but we all knew she was crying. You"]]]
