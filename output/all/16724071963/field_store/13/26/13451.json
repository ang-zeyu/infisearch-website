It seemed as though the cloud which at first was no bigger than a man's hand was covering the whole Eastern sky.  Disturbing news flashed across the Channel, even while it was generally felt that the tragedy of Sarajevo could never lead to open hostilities.  About the middle of July, as all the world knows, it was believed that Austria had accepted Servia's assurance that her attitude towards the greater Power was altogether pacific, and that full justice should be meted out to all who had participated in the ghastly murders.  On July 24, even in the quiet neighbourhood of St. Ia, much apprehension was felt by many who took an interest in foreign affairs at the announcement of the presentation of the Austro-Hungarian Note to the Servian Government, especially when we read the terms of the Note. They were so brutal, so arrogant, that we could not see how any self-respecting people could accept them.  Still, we reflected that Servia who had only lately been much weakened and impoverished by her war with Turkey, might be humble.  On the morning of July 25, Admiral Tresize received a letter from a friend who lived in Vienna, which caused him to be greatly perturbed.  \"Things look very black here,\" ran the letter.  \"Many of us, until a day or so ago, believed that the Austro-Servian difficulty would be amicably settled.  As a matter of fact, I know that Austria was prepared to let Servia down rather lightly, but since then new forces have been at work.  I am in a position to state that Germany, and by Germany I mean the Kaiser and the War Party generally, whose word is, of course, law in Germany, has instructed the Emperor Franz-Josef to send Servia practically impossible demands.  What is in the Kaiser's mind it is impossible to say, but, as is very well known, he has been using almost superhuman efforts in perfecting his army and navy, until Germany has become the greatest fighting machine in the world.  It is well known, too, that the Kaiser believes that Russia is so impoverished and enfeebled by her war with Japan that she is no longer dangerous, and he considers France altogether unprepared for war.  This being so, it is the general opinion in diplomatic circles that the Kaiser's purpose in sending Servia impossible conditions is intended to arouse hostilities.  Only to-day I had a chat with a man who moves in the inner circle of things, and he told me, that if Russia defends Servia, as he hopes she will, and that if France prepares to help Russia, as she is sure to do, Austria can keep Servia and Russia busy, while Germany fulfils her long-held determination to bring France to her knees, and to make her practically her vassal.  No one believes that England would interfere.  My own belief is that Germany is using the present occasion as the first step towards carrying out her long-cherished ambitions.  When once she has conquered France, and commands her sea-board and her navy, she will then be able to crush England, which is her ultimate aim.\"  When the Admiral showed me this letter, I suppose I smiled incredulously, for the old man broke out into violent language.  \"I believe it's true,\" he cried.  \"The Kaiser, for all his pious hypocrisies, is a war devil.  He hates the thought that England should be such a World Power, while Germany is only an European Power.\"  \"But the Kaiser isn't such a fool,\" I replied.  \"He knows England and her strength.\"  \"Yes, but he's drunk with pride and arrogance.  He thinks Germany is destined to rule the world.\"  A day or so later news came that Servia had consented to all Austria's demands with the exception of two points, and suggested that these should be submitted to the mediation of the Great Powers.  \"Ah, that clears the air!\" I thought; \"nothing can be more reasonable.\"  Much to the surprise of every one, news came on July 26 that Austria regarded Servia's answer as unsatisfactory, and that the Austro-Hungarian Minister, with the Legation Staff, had left Belgrade on the previous day.  On July 28 I called at Mrs. Nancarrow's house, where I saw Bob reading the newspaper with a smile on his face.  \"This is fine,\" he cried--\"just fine.  What a splendid fellow Sir Edward Grey is!  It was he who proposed a Conference in the Turco-Balkan difficulty, and now it is he again who is going to settle this.\"  \"I am afraid the Turco-Balkan Conference didn't help much,\" I replied.  \"Ah, but this will.  After all, what's the heart of the quarrel?  The murder of the heir to the Austrian throne.  A ghastly affair, I'll admit, but everything can be settled.\"  \"Has Admiral Tresize mentioned a letter which he received from Vienna a day or two ago?\" I asked.  \"Yes,\" replied Bob, \"but of course it was pure imagination.  Do you know, I admire the Kaiser.  He's a good man, a religious man.\"  I coughed.  \"Of course it is easy to imagine a case against him,\" he went on lightly; \"but it has no foundation in fact.  I told the Admiral so.  We had quite an argument about it, and I maintained that whatever the circumstances, England had no occasion to be dragged in, and that it would be criminal on the part of our statesmen if they allowed it. Evidently Sir Edward Grey thinks the same.  Of course you've seen that he has proposed a Conference.  He has suggested that Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain, who are not directly connected with the quarrel, should meet, and settle it.\"  \"Will Germany accept?\"  \"Of course she will,\" replied Bob confidently, \"we shall soon hear that the trouble is at an end.\"  \"I hope you are right, but if the Kaiser holds the views expressed by the Admiral's friend, I very much doubt it,\" was my rejoinder.  When we read that a Russian Cabinet Council was held, and regarded the Austrian demands as an indirect challenge to Russia, and when we also read that Austria, without giving Servia any chance for further consideration, had declared war upon her, and seized certain of her vessels which happened to be on the Danube, we began to fear trouble, although even then we in St. Ia never seriously believed that England would be directly implicated in it.  I am stating these things here, not that they are not known to every one, but because they will help to make the story I am writing clearer to the reader, especially when it reaches the later stages.  Later the news came to us that there was partial Russian mobilisation along the Austrian frontier, and that as a consequence a Council was held in Berlin.  Of course we knew nothing of what was said in that Council, but when we heard that Russia's partial mobilisation had become general, we began to shudder at the gradual darkening of the European sky.  As all the world knows now, Germany declared war on Russia on August 1, and I remember meeting Bob outside the St. Ia post office that day.  \"You see you were not right about Germany,\" I said.  \"Both France and Italy accepted Sir Edward Grey's suggestion, and consented to join in a Conference; but Germany refused.  Nothing can be plainer than that.  If Germany had wanted peace, she could easily have secured it.  Austria would not have opposed her in any case, but she would not even join in a Conference in order to secure peace.\"  Bob shook his head.  \"You know the reason Germany gave for refusing,\" he said.  \"About the most arrogant, but the most characteristic possible.  Fancy saying that Austria as a Great Power could not think of allowing mediation as though she were a small Balkan state.\"  \"Yes, it's terrible enough,\" replied Bob.  \"But, thank heaven, we are not likely to be dragged into it.\"  \"I hope and pray not,\" I replied.  \"Why?  Do you think it possible?\" he cried.  \"Anything is possible.  You've seen that Germany has invaded Luxemburg. As you know, Luxemburg is a small neutral state, and has been promised the protection of the Powers.  Germany was a party to this promise, and yet she has violated everything.\"  \"That's only hearsay,\" was his reply.  \"It is more than hearsay,\" I answered; but Bob did not appear to be convinced.  \"I am almost glad dear old father is dead,\" he went on presently.  \"The Boer War nearly broke his heart, while this business threatens to be so ghastly, that it would have driven him mad.  It is simply hellish.\"  After this we almost feared to open our newspapers, and events followed so rapidly that we were unable to keep count of them.  Never shall I forget the look on Admiral Tresize's face when he read Sir Edward Grey's momentous speech.  His ruddy face became almost pale, and his hands trembled.  \"Sir Edward has done all mortal man can do,\" he declared.  \"Whose ever hands are clean of this bloody business, his are.  He has simply laboured night and day for peace.\"  \"Seemingly all in vain,\" was my reply.  \"I have been informed on unimpeachable authority that the Kaiser, in spite of his pious harangues, has been preparing for this, planning for this, for years.\"  \"Still there is no necessity for us to be dragged in,\" I urged.  \"Of course there is the _Entente_ between ourselves and France,\" he replied.  \"France will be bound to help Russia on account of their alliance, and the question will naturally arise as to whether we can stand aside while the German fleet bombards France's shores and while German armies cross her frontier.\"  \"But think of war, Admiral.\"  \"Yes, God knows I think of it.  I didn't sleep last night for thinking of it.  I know what war is, know of its bloody horrors.  War is hell, I know that; but I would rather that my country should go through hell, than allow a Power like Germany to crush her.\"  \"But Germany couldn't crush us.  She has no desire to crush us.\"  The Admiral looked at me angrily, but did not speak for some seconds.  \"I cannot say all I know,\" he said presently, \"but, mark my words, in a few days you will know by the most incontestable proofs that all this is a part of Germany's plans; that she has used these Sarajevo murders as a pretext for causing European war, that she thinks we shall do nothing, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2516"],["title","Redgauntlet: A Tale of the Eighteenth Century (#0)"],["body","by Sir Walter Scott   CONTENTS.

INTRODUCTION  The Jacobite enthusiasm of the eighteenth century, particularly during the rebellion of 1745, afforded a theme, perhaps the finest that could be selected for fictitious composition, founded upon real or probable incident. This civil war and its remarkable events were remembered by the existing generation without any degree of the bitterness of spirit which seldom fails to attend internal dissension. The Highlanders, who formed the principal strength of Charles Edward’s army, were an ancient and high-spirited race, peculiar in their habits of war and of peace, brave to romance, and exhibiting a character turning upon points more adapted to poetry than to the prose of real life. Their prince, young, valiant, patient of fatigue, and despising danger, heading his army on foot in the most toilsome marches, and defeating a regular force in three battles--all these were circumstances fascinating to the imagination, and might well be supposed to seduce young and enthusiastic minds to the cause in which they were found united, although wisdom and reason frowned upon the enterprise.  The adventurous prince, as is well known, proved to be one of those personages who distinguish themselves during some single and extraordinarily brilliant period of their lives, like the course of a shooting-star, at which men wonder, as well on account of the briefness, as the brilliancy of its splendour. A long tract of darkness overshadowed the subsequent life of a man who, in his youth, showed himself so capable of great undertakings; and, without the painful task of tracing his course farther, we may say the latter pursuits and habits of this unhappy prince are those painfully evincing a broken heart, which seeks refuge from its own thoughts in sordid enjoyments.  Still, however, it was long ere Charles Edward appeared to be, perhaps it was long ere he altogether became, so much degraded from his original self; as he enjoyed for a time the lustre attending the progress and termination of his enterprise. Those who thought they discerned in his subsequent conduct an insensibility to the distresses of his followers, coupled with that egotistical attention to his own interests which has been often attributed to the Stuart family, and which is the natural effect of the principles of divine right in which they were brought up, were now generally considered as dissatisfied and splenetic persons, who, displeased with the issue of their adventure and finding themselves involved in the ruins of a falling cause, indulged themselves in undeserved reproaches against their leader. Indeed, such censures were by no means frequent among those of his followers who, if what was alleged had been just, had the best right to complain. Far the greater number of those unfortunate gentlemen suffered with the most dignified patience, and were either too proud to take notice of ill-treatment an the part of their prince, or so prudent as to be aware their complaints would meet with little sympathy from the world. It may be added, that the greater part of the banished Jacobites, and those of high rank and consequence, were not much within reach of the influence of the prince’s character and conduct, whether well regulated or otherwise.  In the meantime that great Jacobite conspiracy, of which the insurrection of 1745-6 was but a small part precipitated into action on the failure of a far more general scheme, was resumed and again put into motion by the Jacobites of England, whose force had never been broken, as they had prudently avoided bringing it into the field. The surprising effect which had been produced by small means, in 1745-6, animated their hopes for more important successes, when the whole nonjuring interest of Britain, identified as it then was with great part of the landed gentlemen, should come forward to finish what had been gallantly attempted by a few Highland chiefs.  It is probable, indeed, that the Jacobites of the day were incapable of considering that the very small scale on which the effort was made, was in one great measure the cause of its unexpected success. The remarkable speed with which the insurgents marched, the singularly good discipline which they preserved, the union and unanimity which for some time animated their councils, were all in a considerable degree produced by the smallness of their numbers. Notwithstanding the discomfiture of Charles Edward, the nonjurors of the period long continued to nurse unlawful schemes, and to drink treasonable toasts, until age stole upon them. Another generation arose, who did not share the sentiments which they cherished; and at length the sparkles of disaffection, which had long smouldered, but had never been heated enough to burst into actual flame, became entirely extinguished. But in proportion as the political enthusiasm died gradually away among men of ordinary temperament, it influenced those of warm imaginations and weak understandings, and hence wild schemes were formed, as desperate as they were adventurous.  Thus a young Scottishman of rank is said to have stooped so low as to plot the surprisal of St. James’s Palace, and the assassination of the royal family. While these ill-digested and desperate conspiracies were agitated among the few Jacobites who still adhered with more obstinacy to their purpose, there is no question but that other plots might have been brought to an open explosion, had it not suited the policy of Sir Robert Walpole rather to prevent or disable the conspirators in their projects, than to promulgate the tale of danger, which might thus have been believed to be more widely diffused than was really the case.  In one instance alone this very prudential and humane line of conduct was departed from, and the event seemed to confirm the policy of the general course. Doctor Archibald Cameron, brother of the celebrated Donald Cameron of Lochiel, attainted for the rebellion of 1745, was found by a party of soldiers lurking with a comrade in the wilds of Loch Katrine five or six years after the battle of Culloden, and was there seized. There were circumstances in his case, so far as was made known to the public, which attracted much compassion, and gave to the judicial proceedings against him an appearance of cold-blooded revenge on the part of government; and the following argument of a zealous Jacobite in his favour, was received as conclusive by Dr. Johnson and other persons who might pretend to impartiality. Dr. Cameron had never borne arms, although engaged in the Rebellion, but used his medical skill for the service, indifferently, of the wounded of both parties. His return to Scotland was ascribed exclusively to family affairs. His behaviour at the bar was decent, firm, and respectful. His wife threw herself, on three different occasions, before George II and the members of his family, was rudely repulsed from their presence, and at length placed, it was said, in the same prison with her husband, and confined with unmanly severity.  Dr. Cameron was finally executed with all the severities of the law of treason; and his death remains in popular estimation a dark blot upon the memory of George II, being almost publicly imputed to a mean and personal hatred of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, the sufferer’s heroic brother.  Yet the fact was that whether the execution of Archibald Cameron was political or otherwise, it might certainly have been justified, had the king’s ministers so pleased, upon reasons of a public nature. The unfortunate sufferer had not come to the Highlands solely upon his private affairs, as was the general belief; but it was not judged prudent by the English ministry to let it be generally known that he came to inquire about a considerable sum of money which had been remitted from France to the friends of the exiled family. He had also a commission to hold intercourse with the well-known M’Pherson of Cluny, chief of the clan Vourich, whom the Chevalier had left behind at his departure from Scotland in 1746, and who remained during ten years of proscription and danger, skulking from place to place in the Highlands, and maintaining an uninterrupted correspondence between Charles and his friends. That Dr. Cameron should have held a commission to assist this chief in raking together the dispersed embers of disaffection, is in itself sufficiently natural, and, considering his political principles, in no respect dishonourable to his memory. But neither ought it to be imputed to George II that he suffered the laws to be enforced against a person taken in the act of breaking them. When he lost his hazardous game, Dr. Cameron only paid the forfeit which he must have calculated upon. The ministers, however, thought it proper to leave Dr. Cameron’s new schemes in concealment, lest, by divulging them, they had indicated the channel of communication which, it is now well known, they possessed to all the plots of Charles Edward. But it was equally ill advised and ungenerous to sacrifice the character of the king to the policy of the administration. Both points might have been gained by sparing the life of Dr. Cameron after conviction, and limiting his punishment to perpetual exile.  These repeated and successive Jacobite plots rose and burst like bubbles on a fountain; and one of them, at least, the Chevalier judged of importance enough to induce him to risk himself within"]]]
