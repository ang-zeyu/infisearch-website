Apropos of nothing, Arthmore said: \"Reminds me of the time I was workin' for a printer, see? We 'ad to print up a bunch of 'andbills advertisin' a church charity bazaar. Down at the bottom was supposed to be printed 'Under the auspices of St. Bede's-on-Thames.' So I--\"  He went on with a long, rambling tale about making a mistake in printing the handbill. Houston paid little attention. He smoked in silence, keeping his eyes on the red glow of the taillight ahead of them.  Neither man mentioned the approaching climax of the chase. Even hardened veterans of the Psychodeviant Police don't look forward to the possibility of having their minds taken over, controlled by some outside force.  It had never happened to Houston, but he knew that Arthmore had been through the experience once. It evidently wasn't pleasant.  \"--and the boss was 'oppin' mad,\" Arthmore was saying, \"but, crikey, 'ow was I to know that _auspice_ was spelled A-U-S-P-I-C-E?\"  Houston grinned. \"Yeah, sure. How're we doing with Sir Lewis?\"  \"Seems to be headed in the right direction,\" Arthmore said, suddenly dropping the Cockney accent. \"This is the route I'd take if I were headed for Upper Berkeley Mews. He probably hasn't told the driver to change addresses--maybe he won't.\"  \"The victims never do,\" Houston said. \"He probably is actually headed toward Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews.\"  \"Yeah. Nobody's perfect,\" said Arthmore.         *       *       *       *       *  Forty-five minutes of steady progress through the streets of Greater London brought Sir Lewis Huntley to Upper Berkeley and to the short dead-end street which constituted the Mews. By the time the dapper baronet stepped out of the machine and paid his driver, the whole area was surrounded by and filled with the well-armed, silent, and careful agents of the Psychodeviant Police.  Number 37 was an old concrete-and-steel structure of the George VI period, faced with a veneer of red brick. It had obviously been remodeled at least once to make the fa√ßade more modern and more fashionable; the red-violet anodized aluminum was relatively fresh and unstained. It wouldn't have taken vast wealth to rent a flat in the building, but neither would an average income have been quite enough.  Houston looked out of the window of Arthmore's cab and glanced at the tiers of windows in the building. Presumably, the man they were looking for was up there--somewhere.  _So you occupy a station in the upper middle-class_, thought Houston. It checked. Every bit of evidence that came his way seemed to check perfectly and fit neatly into the hypothesis which he had formed. Soon it would be time to test that theory--but the time had not yet come.  \"Stand by and wait for orders, Houston,\" said the speaker in Houston's ear. \"We've got men inside the building.\"  Sir Lewis Huntley opened the sparkling, translucent door of Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews and went inside.  Arthmore pulled the cab over to the curb a few yards from the entrance and the two men waited in silence. All around them were other men, some in private cars, some walking slowly along the street. All of them were part of the net that had gathered to catch one man.  _Poor fish_, Houston thought wryly.  There was no noise, no excitement. Five minutes after Sir Lewis had entered the front door, it opened again. A man whom Houston had never seen before stepped out and gestured with one hand. At the same time, Houston's speaker said: \"They've got him. Hit him with a stun gun when he tried to get out through the fire exit.\"  An ambulance which had been waiting at the entrance of the Mews pulled up in front of Number 37, and a minute or so later a little clot of men came out bearing a stretcher, which was loaded into the ambulance. Immediately after them came another man who had a firm, but polite grip on the arm of Sir Lewis Huntley.  Houston sighed and leaned back in his seat. That was that. It was all over. Simple. Nothing to it.  Another Controller had been apprehended by the Psychodeviant Police. Another deviant, already tried and found guilty, was ready to be exiled from Earth and imprisoned on one of the Penal Asteroids. All in the day's work.  _There's just one thing I'd like to know_, Houston thought blackly. _What in the hell's going on?_         *       *       *       *       *  In his hotel room near Piccadilly Circus, several hours later, David Houston sat alone, drink in hand, and put that same question to himself again.  \"What's going on?\"  On the face of it, it was simple. On the face of it, the answer was right in front of him, printed in black and white on the front page of the evening _Times_.  Houston lifted the paper off the bed and looked at it. The banner line said: _Controller Captured in Lambeth!_  Beneath that, in smaller type, the headline added: Robert Harris Accused of Taking Control of Barrister Sir Lewis Huntley.  The column itself told the whole story. Mr. Robert Harris, of No. 37 Upper Berkeley Mews, had, by means of mental control, taken over the mind of Sir Lewis and compelled him to draw one thousand pounds out of his bank. While Sir Lewis was returning to Harris with the money, the United Nations Psychodeviant Police had laid a trap. Sir Lewis, upon recovering his senses when Harris was rendered unconscious by a stun gun, had given evidence to the PD Police and to officials at New Scotland Yard.  Houston looked at the full-color photo of Harris that was printed alongside the column. Nice-looking chap; late twenties or early thirties, Houston guessed. Blond-red hair, blue eyes. All-in-all, a very pleasant, but ordinary sort of man.  There had been evidence that a Controller had been at work in London for some weeks now. Twelve days before, several men, following an impulse, had mailed twenty pounds to a \"Richard Hempstead,\" General Delivery, Waterloo Station. By the time the matter had come to the authorities' attention, the envelopes had been called for and the Controller had escaped.  Robert Harris was not the first Controller to be captured, nor, Houston knew, would he be the last. The first one had shown up more than sixteen years before, in Dallas, Texas, USA.  Houston grinned as he thought of it. Projective telepathy had only been a crackpot's idea back then. In spite of the work of many intelligent, sane men, who had shown that mental powers above and beyond the ordinary did exist, the average man simply laughed off such nonsense. It was mysticism; it was magic; it was foolish superstition. It was anything but true.  But ever since \"Blackjack\" Donnely had practically taken control of the whole city of Dallas, the average man had changed his mind. It was still mysterious; it was still magic; but now the weird machinations of the supernormal mind were something to be feared.  In the sixteen years that had ensued since the discovery of the abnormal mental powers of \"Blackjack\" Donnely, rumors had spread all over the world. There were supposed to be men who could levitate--fly through the air at will. Others could walk through walls, and still others could make themselves invisible. The horrible monsters that were supposed to be walking the Earth were legion.         *       *       *       *       *  Actually, only one type of supernormal psychodeviant had been found--the telepath, the mindreader who could probe into the mental processes of others. Worse than that, the telepath could project his own thoughts into the mind of another, so that the victim supposed that the thoughts were his own. Actually, it was a high-powered form of hypnotism; the victim could be made to do anything the projective telepath wanted him to.  \"Blackjack\" Donnely had made that clear in his trial in Texas.  Donnely had been a big man--big physically, and important in city politics. He had also been as arrogant as the Devil himself.  It was the arrogance that had finally tripped up Donnely. He had thought himself impregnable. Haled into court on charges of misappropriation of public funds, he had just sat and smirked while several witnesses for the State admitted that they had aided Donnely, but they claimed he had \"hypnotized\" them. Donnely didn't try to interfere with the evidence--that's where he made his mistake. And that's where his arrogance tripped him up.         *       *       *       *       *  If he'd used telepathic projection to influence the State Attorney or the witnesses or the judge or the Grand Jury _before_ the trial, he might never have been discovered as the first of the Controllers. But that wasn't Donnely's style.  \"None of this namby-pamby stuff,\" he had once been quoted as saying; \"if you got enemies, don't tease 'em--show 'em who's running things. Blackjack 'em, if you have to.\"  And that's exactly what \"Blackjack\" Donnely had done. The trial was a farce from beginning to end; each witness gave his evidence from the stand, and then Donnely took control of their minds and made them refute every bit of it, publicly and tearfully apologizing to the \"wonderful Mr. Donnely\" for saying such unkind things about him.  The judge and the jury knew something funny was going on, but they had no evidence, one way or another. The case, even at that point, might have ended with an acquittal or a hung jury, but Donnely wasn't through using his blackjack.  He took over the mind of the foreman of the jury. The foreman claimed later that the jury had decided that they could reach no decision. Other jurors claimed that they had decided Donnely was guilty, but that was probably an _ex post facto_ switch. It didn't matter, anyway; when the foreman came out, he pronounced Donnely innocent. That should have ended it.  The other jurors began"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25061"],["title","The Penal Cluster (#2)"],["body","protest, but by that time, Donnely had gained control of the judge's mind. Rapidly, the judge silenced the jurors, declared Donnely to be free, and then publicly apologized for ever daring to doubt Mr. Donnely.  The State's Attorney was equally verbose in his apology; he was almost in tears because of his \"deep contrition at having cast aspersions on the spotless character of so great a man.\"  Donnely was released.  The next evening, \"Blackjack\" Donnely was shot down at the front door of his own home. There were fifteen bullets in his body; three from a .32, five from a .38, and seven from a .45.  The police investigation was far from thorough; any evidence that may have turned up somehow got lost. It was labelled as \"homicide committed by person or persons unknown,\" and it stayed that way.         *       *       *       *       *  Donnely was only the first. In the next two years, four more showed up. Everyone of them, in one way or another, had attempted to gain power or money by mental projection. Everyone of them was a twisted megalomaniac.  Houston looked again at Harris's picture on the front page of the _Times_. Here was one Controller who neither looked nor acted like a megalomaniac. That wouldn't make much difference to the PD Police; as far as the officials were concerned, the ability to project telepathically and the taint of delusions of grandeur went hand in hand. Controllers were power-mad and criminal by definition.  Fear still ruled the emotional reactions against Controllers, in spite of the protection of the Psychodeviant Police.  But David Houston knew damned good and well that all telepaths were not necessarily insane.  He should know. He was a Controller, himself.         *       *       *       *       *  _Brrrring!_  David Houston tossed the paper on the bed and walked over to the phone. He cut in the circuit, and waited for the phone's TV screen to show the face of his caller. But the screen remained blank.  \"Who is it?\" Houston asked.  \"Is this CHAring Cross 7-8161?\" It was a woman's voice, soft and well-modulated.  \"No, this is CHElsea 7-8161,\" Houston said. \"You must have dialed C-H-E instead of C-H-A.\"  \"Oh. I'm very sorry. Excuse me.\" There was a click, and she hung up.  Houston walked back over to the bed and picked up his paper. He looked at it, but he didn't read it. It no longer interested him.  So Dorrine was finally in London, eh? He'd recognized her voice instantly; even years of training couldn't smother the midwestern American of Chicago completely beneath the precise British of the well-educated English girl.  The signal had been agreed upon, just in case his phone was tapped. Even the Psychodeviant Police could be suspected of harboring a Controller--although Houston didn't think it too likely. Nevertheless, he wasn't one to take too many chances.  He glanced at his watch. He had an hour yet. He'd wait five minutes before he phoned headquarters.         *       *       *       *       *  He sat down in his chair again and forced himself to relax, smoke a cigarette, and read the paper--the sports section. Perusing the records of the season's cricket matches kept his mind off that picture on the front page. At least, he hoped they would. Let's see, now--Benton was being rated as the finest googly bowler on the Staffordshire Club ...  Everything went fine until he came across a reference to a John Harris, a top-flight batsman for Hambledon; that reminded him of Robert Harris. Houston threw down the paper in disgust and walked over to the phone.  The number was TROwbridge 5-4321, but no one ever bothered to remember it. Simply dial 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1, and every time a voice at the other end would answer--  \"Hamilton speaking.\"  \"Houston here; will I be needed in the next hour or so?\"  \"Mmmm. Just a second; I'll check the roster. No; your evidence won't be needed personally. You've filed an affidavit. No, I don't think--wait a minute! Yes, there's a return here for you; reservation on the six A.M. jet to New York. Your job here is done, Houston, so you can take the rest of the evening off and relax. Going anywhere in particular?\"  \"I thought I'd get a bite to eat and take in a movie, maybe, but if I'm due out at six, I'll forego the cinematic diversion. When's the trial?\"  \"It's scheduled for eleven-thirty this evening. Going to come?\"  Houston shook his head. \"Not if I'm not needed to give evidence. Those Controllers always give me the creeps.\"  \"They do everybody,\" said Hamilton. \"Well, you caught him; there's no need for you to stick around for the windup. Have a good time.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Houston shortly, and hung up.  _The windup_, Houston thought. _Sure. That's all it will be. A Controller's trial is a farce. Knock him out with a stun gun and then pump him full of comatol. How can he defend himself if he's unconscious all through the trial?_  Houston knew what the average man's answer to that would be: \"If a Controller were allowed to remain conscious, he'd take over the judge's mind and get himself freed.\"  Houston said an obscene word under his breath, jammed his hat on his head, put on his coat, and left his apartment.         *       *       *       *       *  With the coming of darkness, the heavy fog had become still denser. The yellow beams of the sodium vapor lamps were simply golden spots hanging in an all-enveloping blackness. Walking the street was a process of moving from one little golden island of light to another, crossing seas of blankness between. The monochromatic yellow shone on the human faces that passed beneath the lamps, robbing them of all color, giving them a dead, grayish appearance beneath the yellow itself.  David Houston walked purposefully along the pavement, his hand jammed deep in his overcoat pockets. One hand held the control box for the little earpiece he wore. He kept moving the band selector, listening for any sign that the Psychodeviant Police were suspicious of a Controller in their midst.  If they were following him, of course, they would use a different scrambler circuit than the one which was plugged into his own unit, but he would be able to hear the gabble of voices, even if he couldn't understand what they were saying.  So far, there hadn't been a sound; if he was being followed, his tailers weren't using the personal intercom units.  He didn't try to elude anyone who might be following. That, in itself, would be a giveaway. Let them watch, if they _were_ watching. They wouldn't see anything but a man going to get himself a bit of dinner.  The _Charles II Inn_, on Regent Street, near Piccadilly Circus, was a haven of brightness in an otherwise Stygian London. It was one of those \"old-fashioned\" places--Restoration style of decoration, carried out in modern plastics. The oak panelling looked authentic enough, but it was just a little too glossy to be real.  Houston pushed open the door, stepped inside, removed his hat and coat and shook the dampness from them. As he handed them to the checker, he looked casually around. Dorrine was nowhere in sight, but he hadn't expected her to be. There would be no point in their meeting physically; it might even be downright dangerous.  The headwaiter, clad in the long waistcoat and full trunk-hose of the late Seventeenth Century, bowed punctiliously.  \"You're alone, sir?\"  \"Alone, yes,\" Houston said. \"I'll just be wanting a light supper and a drink or two.\"  \"This way, sir.\"  Houston followed the man to a small table in the rear of the huge dining room. It was set for two, but the other place was quickly cleared away. Houston ordered an Irish-and-soda from a waiter who was only slightly less elaborately dressed than the headwaiter, and then settled himself down to wait. If he knew Dorrine, she would be on time to the minute.  She came while the waiter was setting the drink on Houston's table. She stepped in through the door, her unmistakable hair glowing a rich red in the illumination of the pseudo-candlelight.  She didn't bother to look around; she knew he would be there.  After a single glance, Houston averted his eyes from her and looked back at his drink.  And in that same instant, their minds touched.  _Dave, darling! I knew you'd be early!_  _Dorrine!_  And then their minds meshed for an instant.  _I_--_(we)_--_you_--LOVE--_you_--(each other)--me!--us!         *       *       *       *       *  Houston looked complacently at his drink while the headwaiter led Dorrine to a table on the far side of the room. She sat down gracefully, smiled at the waiter, and ordered a cocktail. Then she took a magazine from her handbag and began--presumably--to read.  Her thought came: _Who is this Richard Harris? He's not one of our Group._  Houston sipped at his drink. _No. An unknown, like the others. I wonder if he's even a telepath._  _What?_ Her thought carried astonishment. _Why, Dave--he'd_ have _to be! How else could he have controlled this Sir Lewis--whatsisname--Huntley?_  _Well--I've got a funny idea_, Houston replied. _Look at it this way: So far as we know, there are two Groups of telepaths. There's our own Group. All we want is to be left alone. We don't read a Normal's mind unless we have to, and we don't try to control one unless our lives are threatened. We stay under cover, out of everyone's way._  _Then there are the megalomaniacs. They try, presumably, to gain wealth and power by controlling Normals. And they get caught with monotonous regularity. Right?_  The girl caught an odd note in that thought. _What do you mean, \"monotonous regularity\"?_ she asked.  _I mean_, Houston thought savagely, _why is it they're all so bloody stupid? Look at this Harris guy; he is supposed to have taken over Sir Lewis's mind in order to get a thousand pounds. So what did he have Sir Lewis do? Parade all around the city to pick up a PD Police net, and then give his address to a cabman in a loud voice and lead the whole net right to Harris! How stupid can a man get?_  _It does look pretty silly_,"]]]
