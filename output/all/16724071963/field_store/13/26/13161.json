My men came in and lay down by the fire and warmed themselves, but I set two of them as guards at the door.  \"'Well, friend farmer,' laughed one, 'why such a long face? Do you not think we shall be merry company?'  \"'We came only to cheer you,' said another. 'What man wants to spend the winter with no guests?'  \"'Ah!' another then cried out, sitting up. 'Here comes something that will be a welcome guest to my stomach.'  \"The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat. They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked. At last the supper began. The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat, and you cannot wonder; for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket-loads of bread into our big mouths. When the tables were taken out and the mead-horns came round, I stood up and raised my horn and said to the farmer:  \"'You would not eat with us. You cannot say no to half of my ale. I drink this to your health.'  \"Then I drank half of the hornful and sent the rest across the fire to the farmer. He took it and smiled, saying:  \"'Since it is to my health, I will drink it. I thought that all this night's work would be my death.'  \"'Oh, do not fear that!' I laughed, 'for a dead man sets no tables.'  \"So we drank and all grew merrier. At last I stood up and said:  \"'I like this little taste of your hospitality, friend farmer. I have decided to accept more of it.'  \"My men roared with laughter.  \"'Come,' they cried, 'thank him for that, farmer. Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?'  \"I went on:  \"'Now there is no fun in having guests unless they keep you company and make you merry. So I will give out this law: that my men shall never leave you alone. Hakon there shall be your constant companion, friend farmer. He shall not leave you day or night, whether you are working or playing or sleeping. Leif and Grim shall be the same kind of friends to your two sons.'  \"I named nine others and said:  \"'And these shall follow your thralls in the same way. Now, am I not careful to make your time go merrily?'  \"So I set guards over every one in that house. Not once all that winter did they stir out of sight of some of us. So no tales got out to the neighbors. Besides, it was a lonely place, and by good luck no one came that way. Oh! that was fat and easy living.  \"Well, after we had been there for a long time, Hakon came in to the feast one night and said:  \"'I heard a cuckoo to-day!'  \"'It is the call to go a-viking,' I said.  \"All my men put their hands to their mouths and shouted. Their eyes danced. Big Thorleif stood up and stretched himself.  \"'I am stiff with long sitting,' he said. 'I itch for a fight.'  \"I turned to the farmer.  \"'This is our last feast with you,' I said.  \"'Well,' he laughed, 'this has been the busiest winter I ever spent, and the merriest. May good luck go with you!'  \"'By the beard of Odin!' I cried; 'you have taken our joke like a man.'  \"My men pounded the table with their fists.  \"'By the hammer of Thor!' shouted Grim. 'Here is no stingy coward. He is a man fit to carry my drinking-horn, the horn of a sea-rover and a sword-swinger. Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the farmer's hand. 'May you drink heart's-ease from it for many years. And with it I leave you a name, Sif the Friendly. I shall hope to drink with you sometime in Valhalla.'  \"Then all my men poured around that farmer and clapped him on the shoulder and piled things upon him, saying:  \"'Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly.'  \"'And here is a bracelet.'  \"'A sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side.'  \"I took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him.  \"The old man's eyes opened wide at all these things, and at the same time he laughed.  \"'May Odin send me such guests every winter!' he said.  \"Early next morning we shook hands with our host and boarded the 'Waverunner' and sailed off.  \"'Where shall we go?' my men asked.  \"'Let the gods decide,' I said, and tossed up my spear.  \"When it fell on the deck it pointed up-shore, so I steered in that direction. That is the best way to decide, for the spear will always point somewhere, and one thing is as good as another. That time it pointed us into your father's ships. They closed in battle with us and killed my men and sunk my ship and dragged me off a prisoner. They were three against one, or they might have tasted something more bitter at our hands. They took me before King Halfdan.  \"'Here,' they said, 'is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts. We sunk his ship and men, but him we brought to you.'  \"'A robber viking?' said the king, and scowled at me.  \"I threw back my head and laughed.  \"'Yes. And with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me.'  \"The king frowned more angrily.  \"'Saucy, too?' he said. 'Well, thieves must die. Take him out, Thorkel, and let him taste your sword.'  \"Your mother, the queen, was standing by. Now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said:  \"'He is only a lad. Let him live. And would he not be a good gift for our baby?'  \"Your father thought a moment, then looked at your mother and smiled.  \"'Soft heart!' he said gently to her; then to Thorkel, 'Well, let him go, Thorkel!'  \"Then he turned to me again, frowning.  \"'But, young sharp-tongue, now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of. Weld an iron collar on his neck.'  \"So I lived and now am your tooth thrall. Well, it is the luck of war. But by the chair of Odin, I kept my vow!\"  \"Yes!\" cried Harald, jumping to his feet. \"And had a joke into the bargain. Ah! sometime I will make a brave vow like that.\"  [Decoration]   FOOTNOTES:  [3] See note about drinking-horns on page 195.  [4] See note about feast hall on page 196.     [Illustration]  Olaf's Fight With Havard   At another time Harald said:  \"Tell me of a fight, Olaf. I want to hear about the music of swords.\"  Olaf's eyes blazed.  \"I will tell you of our fight with King Havard,\" he said.  \"One dark night we had landed at a farm. We left our 'Waverunner' in the water with three men to guard her. The rest of us went into the house. The farmer met us at the door, but he died by Thorkel's sword. The others we shut into their beds.[5] The door at each end of the hall we had barred on the inside so that nobody could surprise us. We were busy going through the cupboards and shouting at our good luck. But suddenly we heard a shout outside:  \"'Thor and Havard!'  \"Then there was a great beating at the doors.  \"'He has two hundred fighters with him,' said Grim; 'for we saw his ships last night. Thirty against two hundred! We shall all drink in Valhalla to-night.'  \"'Well,' I cried, 'Odin shall have no unwilling guest in me.'  \"'Nor in me,' cried Hakon.  \"'Nor in me,' shouted Thorkel.  \"And that shout went all around, and we drew out our swords and caught up our shields.  \"'Hot work is ahead of us,' said Hakon. 'Besides, we must leave none of this mead for Havard. Lend a hand, some one.'  \"Then he and another pulled out a great tub that sat on the floor of the cupboard.  \"'I drink to Valhalla to-night,' cried Thorkel the Thirsty, and he plunged his horn deep into the tub.  \"When he brought it up, his sleeve was dripping and the sweet mead was running over from the horn.  \"'Sloven!' cried Hakon, and he struck Thorkel with his fist and knocked him over into the cupboard.  \"He fell against the wooden wall at the back, and a carved panel swung open behind him. He dropped down head first. In a minute he put his head out of the hole again. We all stood staring.  \"'I think it is a secret passage,' he said.  \"'We will try it,' I answered in a whisper. 'Throw dirt on the fire. It must be dark.'  \"So we dug up dirt from the earth floor and smothered the fire. All this time there was a terrible shouting and hammering at the doors, but they were of heavy logs and stood.  \"'I with four more will guard this door,' I said, pointing to the east end.  \"Immediately four men stepped to my side.  \"'And I will guard the other,' Hakon said, and four went with him.  \"'The rest of you, down the hole!' I said. 'Close the door after you. If luck is with us we will meet at the ships. Now Thor and our good swords help us! Quick! The doors are giving way.'  \"So we ten men stood at the doors and held back the king's soldiers. It was dark in the room, and the people out of doors could not tell how many were inside. Few were eager to be the first in.  \"'Thirty swords are waiting in there to eat up the first man,' we heard some one say.  \"We chuckled at that.  \"But the king stood in the very doorway and fought. Our five swords held him back for a long time, but at last he pushed in, and his men poured after him. We ran back and hid behind some tubs in a dark corner. The king's men went groping about and calling, but they did not find us. The room was full of shouting and running and sword-clashing; for in the dark and the noise the men could not tell their own soldiers. More than one fell by his friend's sword. When it was less crowded about the doorway, I whispered:  \"'Follow me in double line. We will make for the ships. Keep close together.'  \"So that double line of men, with swords swinging from both sides, ran out through the dark. Swords struck out at us, and we struck back. Men ran after us shouting, but our legs were as good as theirs. But I and Hakon and one other were all that reached the ship. There we saw our 'Waverunner' with sail up and bow pointing to open sea. We swam out to her and climbed aboard. Then the men swung the sail to the wind, and we moved off. Even as we went, a spear whizzed through the air, and Hakon fell dead; for the king and all his men were running to the shore.  \"'After them!' they were shouting.  \"Then we heard the king call to the men in his boats lying out in the water:  \"'Row to shore and take us in.'  \"Thorkel was standing by my side. At that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24811"],["title","Viking Tales (#3)"],["body","laughed and said:  \"'They do not answer. He left but a handful to guard his ships. They tasted our swords. And we went aboard and broke the oars and threw the sails into the water. It will be slow going for Havard to-night.'  [Illustration: \"_Then he turned to the shore and sang out loudly_\"]  \"Then he turned to the shore and sang out loudly:      \"'King Havard's ships are dead:     Olaf's dragon flies.     King Havard stamps the shore:     Olaf skims the waves.     King Havard shakes his fist.     Olaf turns and laughs.'  \"That was the end of our meeting with King Havard.\"  [Decoration]   FOOTNOTES:  [5] See note about beds on page 196.     [Illustration]  Foes'-fear   Every day the boy Harald heard some such story of war or of the gods, until he could see Thor riding among the storm-clouds and throwing his hammer, until he knew that a brave man has many wounds, but never a one on his back. Many nights he dreamed that he himself walked into Valhalla, and that all the heroes stood up and shouted:  \"Welcome! Harald Halfdanson!\"  \"Ah! the bite of the sword is sweeter than the kiss of your mother,\" he said to Olaf one day. \"When shall I stand in the prow of a dragon and feast on the fight? I am hungry to see the world. Ivar the Far-goer tells me of the strange countries he has seen. Ah! we vikings are great folk. There is no water that has not licked our boats' sides. This cape of mine came in a viking boat from France. These cloak-pins came from a far country called Greece. In my father's house are golden cups from Rome, away on the southern sea. Every land pours rich things into our treasure-chest. Ivar has been to a strange country where it is all sand and is very hot. The people call their country Arabia. They have never heard of Thor or Odin. Ivar brought beautiful striped cloth from there, and wonderful, sweet-smelling waters. Oh! when shall the white horses of the sea lead me out to strange lands and glorious battles?\"  But Harald did something besides listen to stories. Every morning he was up at sunrise and went with a thrall to feed the hunting dogs. Thorstein taught him to swim in the rough waters of the fiord. Often he went with the men a-hunting in the woods and learned to ride a horse and pull a bow and throw a lance. Ivar taught him to play the harp and to make up songs. He went much to the smithy, where the warriors mended their helmets and made their spears and swords of iron and bronze. At first he only watched the men or worked the bellows, but soon he could handle the tongs and hold the red-hot iron, and after a long time he learned to use the hammer and to shape metal. One day he made himself a spear-head. It was two feet long and sharp on both edges. While the iron was hot he beat into it some runes. When the men in the smithy saw the runes they opened their eyes wide and looked at the boy, for few Norsemen could read.  \"What does it say?\" they asked.  \"It is the name of my spear-point, and it says, 'Foes'-fear,'\" Harald said. \"But now for a handle.\"  It was winter and the snow was very deep. So Harald put on his skees and started for a wood that was back from shore. Down the mountains he went, twenty, thirty feet at a slide, leaping over chasms a hundred feet across. In his scarlet cloak he looked like a flash of fire. The wind shot past him howling. His eyes danced at the fun.  \"It is like flying,\" he thought and laughed. \"I am an eagle. Now I soar,\" as he leaped over a frozen river.  He saw a slender ash growing on top of a high rock.  \"That is the handle for 'Foes'-fear,'\" he said.  The rock stood up like a ragged tower, but he did not stop because of the steep climb. He threw off his skees and thrust his hands and feet into holes of the rock and drew himself up. He tore his jacket and cut his leather leggings and scratched his face and bruised his hands, but at last he was on the top. Soon he had chopped down the tree and had cut a straight pole ten feet long and as big around as his arm. He went down, sliding and jumping and tearing himself on the sharp stones. With a last leap he landed near his skees. As he did so a lean wolf jumped and snapped at him, snarling. Harald shouted and swung his pole. The wolf dodged, but quickly jumped again and caught the boy's arm between his sharp teeth. Harald thought of the spear-point in his belt. In a wink he had it out and was striking with it. He drove it into the wolf's neck and threw him back on the snow, dead.  \"You are the first to feel the tooth of 'Foes'-fear,'\" he said, \"but I think you will not be the last.\"  [Illustration: \"_He drove it into the wolf's neck_\"]  Then without thinking of his torn arm he put on his skees and went leaping home. He went straight to the smithy and smoothed his pole and drove it into the haft of the spear-point. He hammered out a gold band and put it around the joining place. He made nails with beautiful heads and drove them into the pole in different places.  \"If it is heavy it will strike hard,\" he said.  Then he weighed the spear in his hand and found the balancing point and put another gold band there to mark it.  Thorstein came in while he was working.  \"A good spear,\" he said.  Then he saw the torn sleeve and the red wound beneath.  \"Hello!\" he cried. \"Your first wound?\"  \"Oh, it is only a wolf-scratch,\" Harald answered.  \"By Thor!\" cried Thorstein, \"I see that you are ready for better wounds. You bear this like a warrior.\"  \"I think it will not be my last,\" Harald said.     [Illustration]  Harald is King   Now when Harald was ten years old his father, King Halfdan, died. An old book that tells about Harald says that then \"he was the biggest of all men, the strongest, and the fairest to look upon.\" That about a boy ten years old! But boys grew fast in those days for they were out of doors all the time, running, swimming, leaping on skees, and hunting in the forest. All that makes big, manly boys.  So now King Halfdan was dead and buried, and Harald was to be king. But first he must drink his father's funeral ale.  \"Take down the gay tapestries that hang in the feast hall,\" he said to the thralls. \"Put up black and gray ones. Strew the floor with pine branches. Brew twenty tubs of fresh ale and mead. Scour every dish until it shines.\"  Then Harald sent messengers all over that country to his kinsmen and friends.  \"Bid them come in three months' time to drink my father's funeral ale,\" he said. \"Tell them that no one shall go away empty-handed.\"  So in three months men came riding up at every hour. Some came in boats. But many had ridden far through mountains, swimming rivers; for there were few roads or bridges in Norway. On account of that hard ride no women came to the feast.  At nine o'clock in the night the feast began. The men came walking in at the west end of the hall.[6] The great bonfires down the middle of the room were flashing light on everything. The clean smell of this wood-smoke and of the pine branches on the floor was pleasant to the guests. Down each side of the hall stretched long, backless benches, with room for three hundred men. In the middle of each side rose the high seat, a great carved chair on a platform. All along behind the benches were the black and gray draperies. Here hung the shields of the guests; for every man, when he was given his place, turned and hung his shield behind him and set his tall spear by it. So on each wall there was a long row of gay shields, red and green and yellow, and all shining with gold or bronze trimmings. And higher up there was another row of gleaming spear-points. Above the hall the rafters were carved and gaily painted, so that dragons seemed to be crawling across, or eagles seemed to be swooping down.  The guests walked in laughing and talking with their big voices so that the rafters rang. They made the hall look all the brighter with their clothes of scarlet and blue and green, with their flashing golden bracelets and head-bands and sword-scabbards, with their flying hair of red or yellow.  Across the east end of the hall was a bench. When the men were all in, the queen, Harald's mother, and the women who lived with her, walked in through the east door and sat upon this bench.  Then thralls came running in and set up the long tables[7] before the benches. Other thralls ran in with large steaming kettles of meat. They put big pieces of this meat into platters of wood and set it before the men. They had a few dishes of silver. These they put before the guests at the middle of the tables; for the great people sat here near the high seats.  When the meat came, the talking stopped; for Norsemen ate only twice a day, and these men had had long rides and were hungry. Three or four persons ate from one platter and drank from the same big bowl of milk. They had no forks, so they ate from their fingers and threw the bones under the table among the pine branches. Sometimes they took knives from their belts to cut the meat.  When the guests sat back satisfied, Harald called to the thralls:  \"Carry out the tables.\"  So they did and brought in two great tubs of mead and set one at each end of the hall. Then the queen stood up and called some of her women. They went to the mead tubs. They took the horns, when the thralls had filled them, and carried them to the men with some merry word. Perhaps one woman said as she handed a man his horn:  \"This horn has no feet to be set down upon. You must drink it at one draught.\"  Perhaps another said:  \"Mead loves a merry face.\"  The women were beautiful, moving about the hall. The queen wore a trailing dress of blue velvet with long flowing sleeves. She had a short apron of striped Arabian silk with gold fringe along the bottom. From her shoulders hung a long train of scarlet wool embroidered in gold. White linen covered her head. Her long yellow hair was pulled around at the sides and over her breast and was fastened under the belt of her apron. As she walked, her train made a pleasant rustle among the pine"]]]
