It might end in Austria practically administering Servian affairs.\"  \"That would be the best way, wouldn't it?  Austria is a civilised country, while the Servians are savages.  One of the girls I went to school with, spent a winter in Vienna, and she had a lovely time.  She says that Vienna is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and the Austrians are such charming people.\"  \"That would be easier said than done,\" replied Bob, smiling at her school-girl fashion of settling European difficulties.  \"You see, directly Austria tried to do this, Russia would step in.  Russia is practically under a contract to protect the Servians, and to help them in need.  Russia, which is a great Slav Empire, wouldn't stand by and see Austria swallow up Slav Servia.\"  \"And then there might be a war between Russia and Austria?  And Russia, with her countless hordes of men, would crush Austria?\"  \"That wouldn't suit Germany's book,\" was Bob's reply.  \"You see, there is a close alliance between Austria and Germany, and Germany wouldn't allow Austria to be put under.\"  \"Oh, it would be horrible!\" gasped the girl.  \"But there, we won't talk about it any more.  It can't affect us, can it?  England has nothing to do with Servians murdering an Austrian Archduke.  I'm awfully sorry for the poor old Austrian Emperor, but--but----\"  \"It can't affect us, or our happiness,\" cried Bob, taking her outstretched hand.  \"No, thank God! but I say, Nancy, this is an awful commentary on what we were saying just now, isn't it?  It makes me more than ever determined to throw myself into a movement that shall make war impossible.  But oh, my dear girl, I do wish you'd let me speak to your father to-night!  I want my happiness assured.  I want everybody to know that I've won you--that you've promised to be my wife.\"  A thoughtful look came into her eyes.  It might seem as though she were fighting a battle between inclination and judgment.  \"No, Bob,\" she said at length, \"it won't do.  I'm sure dad wouldn't consent.  The truth is----\" she hesitated.  \"What?\" asked Bob eagerly.  \"Dad's awfully fond of Captain Trevanion.  I--I believe he's set his mind on it.\"  \"On what?  On your marrying him!\"  \"Now, don't be jealous.\"  \"I'm not jealous.  How could I be when\"--he held her to him, and kissed her passionately--\"when you've told me you love me.\"  \"He'll be terribly mad when he knows at first.  You see, he's always looked on you as a--well, to put it mildly, a useless bookworm.  And he likes Hector Trevanion because, although he's a fool in many things, he's a good soldier.  He says he's very young for a captain, and with his name and prospects--he'll be sure to be a major and afterwards a colonel in a very short time, especially if a war breaks out.  And--and he's very ambitious for me.  That's why I shall have to break it to him by degrees.  I shall begin by talking about your successes at Oxford, and then I shall tell him that you are going to study for the Bar, as a preliminary to going into Parliament.  You are so clever, that you won't be long before you are called to the Bar, will you?\"  \"I'll do it in record time,\" cried Bob.  \"There are a number of dinners to eat, and certain examinations to pass; but I can manage them all right.  Don't think I'm conceited, Nancy; lots of the Professors told me that the Bar exams. would be comparatively easy to me.\"  \"Of course they will be,\" said Nancy confidently, \"and meanwhile you could be on the look out for a constituency, couldn't you?\"  \"Ye-es,\" replied Bob doubtfully.  \"Of course, I'd rather get called first, but it could be managed.  As it happens, I'm comfortably off, and so I need not be dependent on my profession.\"  \"Anyhow, we must say nothing about our--our----\"  \"Engagement,\" suggested Bob, as Nancy hesitated.  \"Call it what you like, but we must keep it quiet for the present, and be very circumspect and all that.  So, as we've been here for quite a long while, we had better be getting home.\"  Bob crumpled up the newspaper and threw it over the cliff.  \"It's horrible, isn't it?\" she said, as they watched it falling from rock to rock until it fell into the sea; \"but it can't affect us, can it, Bob?\"  \"No,\" replied Bob, \"it can't affect us.  Nothing shall affect us, Nancy, and nothing shall come between us.  I feel as though I could do anything now, and there's nothing I won't do to win a position worthy of you.  I'll work like a slave.  I'll map out my programme to the minutest detail, and I'll win all along the line.  Edward VII was called a peacemaker, and everybody admired him for it.  But I'll do more than he ever did.  Just think of it!  To be known throughout the country, and throughout the world, as the man who made war on war, and made it impossible.  I'll give my life to it, Nancy--my whole life!\"  \"And where do I come in?\" she asked, with mock sorrow.  \"You!  You come in everywhere.  You are everything.  You are my love, my inspiration; but for you everything would be impossible.  One more kiss, Nancy, while no one can see us.\"  When Bob Nancarrow returned home that night he was the happiest man in Cornwall.  More than he had ever hoped for had come to pass.  Nancy had promised to wait for him because she loved him.  She had preferred him to all others, and sacrificed brilliant prospects because of her love for him.  The sky of his life seemed cloudless.  Nothing, as far as he could see, stood in the way of his attaining his highest hopes.  The plan which had so suddenly been born in his mind and heart grew in attractiveness.  He had the most glorious objective in the world.  He saw an outlet for his energies, while the cause for which he would stand appealed to all that was noblest within him.  War against war!  The thing had become a passion with him.  Here was the great work which, unknown to himself, he had all along wanted.  Even when he had dreamed of becoming an Oxford Don, and of spending his life in a kind of cultured seclusion, there had always been something wanting.  He had fighting blood in his veins; the old fire for which the Trelawneys had been famous had constantly made its appeal.  And now Nancy had shown him how his life could be a positive one.  Now he could be true to the principles which he had inherited from his father, and to which he held with strong tenacity, and at the same time satisfy his desires to participate in the struggles and battles of the great world.  \"A noble cause demands your zeal!\"  He found himself humming the words as he turned on the lights.  And he had a noble cause, the noblest, the most Christlike on earth.  Warfare! Yes, in spite of his peace principles he loved warfare.  Man was a fighting animal, and he was a man, every inch of him.  And he was called on to fight--to fight the War-god which had lifted its head so arrogantly and brutally.  But his warfare was to be for peace--the peace of the world.  It was to be for man's salvation, and not for his destruction.  Not for pillage, carnage, cruelty, mad hatred, overwhelming ambition, lust for blood; but brotherhood, kindliness, love, mercy.  This was the battle of the Lord; this was the cause of Christ.  In this way he could be true to his father's teaching, true to the Christianity in which he believed; but more, he could by this means make himself worthy of Nancy, and make a place in the world, in which even her father would rejoice.  His heart beat with wild joy.  Even now Nancy's kisses were warm on his lips, her words of love rang in his ears.  Yes, his plan of life was plain, his work arose before him, alluring, ennobling, inspiring.  And Nancy loved him!  What more could he desire?  He looked around the room with a long tremulous sigh of contentment. Life was indeed beautiful, glorious.  Around him were thousands of books.  His father had been an omnivorous reader, and had amassed a large library.  Nearly every inch of wall-space was covered with book-shelves.  Only one space, above the mantelpiece, was uncovered, and there hung what was even dearer than the books.  It was an oil painting of his father.  Robert Nancarrow looked at it long and steadily, and as he did so his eyes became moist.  \"Dear old father!\" he murmured; \"the noblest man that ever breathed.\"  It was a fine face he saw.  Rather serious on the whole, but still with a smile lurking around the lips and shining in the eyes.  The face of a good--almost a great man.  No one could associate it with meanness or impurity.  An intellectual face too, with a broad forehead and large, speaking eyes.  A face which suggested conscientiousness, which proclaimed the fact that its owner must do whatever conscience told him to do, no matter what it might cost.  It seemed to Bob as he looked that his father smiled on him.  \"Yes, it is what he would most desire,\" reflected the young fellow. \"It was the passion of his life, and it shall be mine.\"  He went to a bookcase, and took therefrom a small volume.  It was entitled _Thoughts on the Boer War_, by Robert Nancarrow, M.D.  The young man opened it, and began to read; but his mind was too full of his plans to concentrate his attention.  \"Father would love Nancy,\" he reflected, and then he arose from his chair and went close to the picture.  \"He does love her,\" he reflected. \"He is alive, he knows, and he is pleased.  I feel as though he were here now, and giving me his blessing on my love, and on my work.\"  The house was very silent.  Every one had long since gone to bed, and not a sound was to be heard.  The night was almost windless too, and not even the murmur of the waves in the Bay of St. Ia, which could be faintly heard outside, reached him.  He felt himself alone with his father.  \"Good night, father,\" he said aloud, still looking the picture.  \"I love her as my life, and I am very happy.  I have your blessing, haven't I?\"  Again it seemed to him that his father"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25152"],["title","All for a Scrap of Paper: A Romance of the Present War (#5)"],["body","on him.  He was sure he saw the quiet humour in his eyes which he remembered so well.  Bob was in a strange humour that night.  The day had been eventful beyond all the days of his life.  He had entered into a happiness of which he had never dreamed before; he had seen visions of the future of which hitherto he had been blind.  He had been carried away by his love and his enthusiasm; his nature had been moved to its depths.  Now the memory of it all, the quietness of the house, caused thoughts to come to his mind, and moved him to feelings to which he had been a stranger.  \"It's what you would wish me to do, father, isn't it?\" he still continued aloud.  \"To go into Parliament, and then work and fight for the peace of the world?  To destroy the ghastly nightmare of war, to fight against the War-god, to put an end to this eternal making of implements of death.  I have your consent, and your blessing, haven't I?\"  Yes, he was sure his father was smiling on him, and giving him his blessing.  There was something sacred, holy, in the thought.  He turned out the lights, but the beams of the moon streamed through the window, and rested on the picture.  \"Good night, father,\" he said.  \"I'll try to be a true man,\" and then he left the room, feeling as if indeed he had been talking to his father.  \"Is that you, Bob?\"  He was passing his mother's bedroom door, as the words reached his ears.  \"Yes, mother.  I thought you would have been asleep hours ago.\"  \"No, I couldn't sleep till I heard you come in.  Come in, and kiss me good night.\"  Bob entered his mother's room, and went towards the bed.  Mrs. Nancarrow was still a young woman, and looked almost like a girl as she lay on the snowy pillows.  \"Whom was that you were talking to?\"  \"I--I was thinking, mother.\"  \"Thinking?  Thinking aloud?\"  \"I suppose so.\"  \"What about?\"  \"About father.\"  There was a silence for a few seconds.  Both felt they were on sacred ground.  \"Mother,\" said Bob, remembering what Nancy had said to him, \"I want to tell you something.  But you won't breathe a word, will you?  It's a profound secret.  I mean that you must not mention it to _any one_, must not speak about it to any one, under any circumstances.\"  \"Of course I won't, if you don't wish it.  What is it?\"  \"I'm engaged to Nancy Tresize.\"  \"What!\"  Bob repeated the news.  \"Aren't you pleased, mother?\"  She lifted herself up in the bed and threw her arms around his neck.  \"You don't mean it really, Bob?  Why, I never dreamed that such a thing was possible.\"  \"Neither did I until to-day.  I--I--mother, what are you crying about? Aren't you pleased?\"  \"Of course I am; but oh, my dear boy!  Oh, if only your father had lived!\"  \"He knows.  I've been telling him,\" said Bob, who had a strain of the mystic in his nature.  \"I'm sure I have his blessing.\"  \"Nancy is the finest, sweetest girl in Cornwall,\" she cried; \"I couldn't have wished for anything better.  I've always loved her.  But I never thought that----\"  \"Neither did I,\" interrupted Bob.  \"It seems too good to be true, but it is true.  I motored Nancy over to Gurnard's Head this afternoon, and--and it is all settled.  She's the dearest girl in the world, mother.\"  \"Of course she is,\" sobbed Mrs. Nancarrow.  \"There, wait a minute until I dry my eyes.  I never expected such a thing, and--and oh, Bob, my dear, dear boy!\"  \"You mustn't imagine that you aren't still dear to me, mother, or that I love you one whit the less.  I don't, you know, and Nancy loves you too.\"  \"Yes, yes, I know that.  It isn't that, my boy!  But--but--you'll never know what a woman feels when she first learns that her only boy loves another woman better than he loves his mother.  It isn't sorrow.  Bob, oh no!  I'm as glad as glad, and I couldn't wish for anything better. But what about the Admiral?  Will he consent?  I know he wants Nancy to marry Captain Trevanion.\"     CHAPTER IV  For the next few days Bob lived in happy dreamland.  It is true he did not see Nancy much alone, and no suggestion of their betrothal was made known.  But he found an excuse for going to Penwennack every day, and Admiral Tresize, never imagining what was in his mind, always gave him a hearty welcome.  Nancy had two brothers nearly of Bob's age, one of whom had been to Clifton with him; and although he was on the military side of the college, they saw much of each other.  Dick Tresize was fond of Bob, in spite of the dissimilarity in their tastes, and as Bob evinced a sudden love and efficiency for tennis, he became in great demand.  He also raised himself in the Admiral's estimation by challenging Captain Trevanion, who was a scratch man at golf, to a match on the Leiant Links.  \"How many strokes do you expect me to give you?\" rather scornfully demanded Trevanion, who had not been at all pleased at Nancy's constant disinclination for his society and her sudden preference for Bob's.  \"Oh, we'll play level!\" was Bob's reply.  \"I like a game when I play,\" said the Captain who joined heartily in the laugh at Bob's expense.  \"I'll try to give you a game,\" was Bob's reply.  \"Good old Bob,\" cried Dick Tresize, \"and the loser shall stand tea at the Club House for the whole bally lot of us.  And it must be a good tea too.  We'll have a dish of cream and all sorts of cakes.  We can easily arrange it, for Thursday is a quiet day, and the crowds of visitors haven't made their appearance yet.  Have you plenty of money with you, Bob.\"  \"Oceans,\" replied Bob, pulling out a handful of change.  \"I'm only thinking about the state of Trevanion's finances.\"  \"They are all right,\" replied Trevanion.  \"And I propose that we play for a box of balls into the bargain.\"  \"How many of you are going?\" asked Bob quietly.  Several hands went up, including that of the Admiral, who had become enthusiastic about forming what he called \"a gallery.\"  \"Good, Admiral.  I'm glad you are going.  That'll make twelve altogether.  No, Trevanion, we won't play for the balls.  The tea will be enough for you to pay for.  I am told that the Army pays junior officers very badly.\"  \"That's why I want to play for a box of balls.  My stock is running low, and I want to get some on the cheap.\"  \"Come, let's be off!\" cried Dick.  \"I'll tell the men to bring out the cars, and we'll start right away.  Where are your clubs, Bob?\"  \"They are in my locker at the Club.  I haven't seen them since the Easter Vac.\"  \"But you've played at Oxford?\"  \"No; been too busy.\"  Dick held up his hands in mock horror, at which several of the party laughed.  \"Trevanion will wipe the floor with you,\" he said woefully.  \"He's on the links at least three days a week, and he plays a good scratch game.\"  \"Aren't you in practice, Bob?\" asked Nancy, when they had a few seconds alone together.  \"Scarcely played for a year.\"  \"Then why did you challenge Captain Trevanion?\"  \"Because I was mad,\" replied Bob.  \"He's been trying to raise a laugh against me all the morning and so--well, there it is.\"  \"But he'll be sure to beat you?\"  \"No, he won't,\" and there was a confident ring in his voice.  Half an hour later they had reached the Club House, and much laughter and many pleasantries were exchanged as they teed their balls.  Captain Trevanion's clubs were shining, while Bob's were rusty through disuse.  \"They 'a'an't a bin clained for months,\" said the caddy, who was vigorously rubbing them with emery paper.  Captain Trevanion won the toss, and took the honour.  He was a tall, athletic fellow, and showed by his practice swing that he was master of his tools.  He hit his ball straight and clean, and it fell a few yards behind the great grass mound which guards the first green.  Bob, on the other hand, felt nervous and awkward.  He was out of practice, and knew his disadvantage.  He played the ball badly, and while it cleared the rough, he had an awkward stance for his second.  In playing the odd, too, he miscalculated the distance, and found himself in the rough, on the offside of the green.  Captain Trevanion holed out in four and although Bob got a five, he lost the hole.  \"One up to the Army,\" laughed the Admiral.  The second hole, which can easily be reached by a good iron shot, Captain Trevanion played perfectly.  His ball soared over a high mountain of sand, and plumped down comfortably a few yards from the hole.  Bob topped his ball, and it landed half way up the sand-hill in a bad place.  Again it took him five to hole out, while Trevanion was down in three.  At the third the Captain drove a perfect ball, while Bob, who though he got just as far, landed in the churchyard, out of bounds.  The result was that he lost this hole also.  \"This is what I call a grand procession,\" remarked some one.  \"Come, Bob,\" laughed the Admiral, \"this looks as though you will have to pay for the tea.\"  \"I hope it'll be a good one anyhow,\" replied Bob quietly.  \"I'm working up a fine appetite.\"  At the next hole Captain Trevanion drove short, and landed in the bunker guarding the green.  Bob, on the other hand, sent his ball straight and true over the guiding-post.  \"Fine shot,\" was the general remark.  \"Too far,\" said Dick Tresize.  \"That ball's over the green and gone down the cliff.  I'd rather be where Trevanion is.\"  He proved to be right.  Bob had got into a well-nigh impossible place and lost another hole.  \"Beastly luck,\" remarked Dick.  \"That's not a fair hole.\"  \"Rub of the green,\" was all Bob said.  \"Yes, but it makes you four down,\" said the Admiral.  \"Trevanion has done every hole in bogey so far, and he's not likely to make mistakes.\"  It seemed as though Bob were destined to bad luck, for although he seemed to play the next hole perfectly, he made too much allowance for the wind, and his second shot went over a high bank which guarded the green, and fell among the shingle, near which some old boats were lying.  \"Five up to the Military,\" shouted the Admiral.  \"The same grand procession,\" giggled a girl who was a great admirer of Trevanion.  \"I say, Bob, I thought"]]]
