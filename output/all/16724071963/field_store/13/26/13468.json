The fragments of common-room gossip, which it had been her fortune to hear accidentally now and again.  The half confidences of scandals, borne on whispered breaths.  The whole confidences of dormitory and study which she had been privileged to share.  All were parts of the new and strange world, the great world which had swum into her ken.  As she sat now in the train, with some formulation of memory already accomplished in the two hours of solitude, her first comment, spoken half audibly, would have surprised her teachers as much as it would have surprised herself, if she had been conscious of it; for as yet her thinking was not self-conscious:  'Surely, I am not like that!'  It was of the women she had been thinking, not of the men.  The glimpse which she had had of her own sex had been an awakening to her; and the awakening had not been to a pleasant world.  All at once she seemed to realise that her sex had defects--littlenesses, meannesses, cowardices, falsenesses.  That their occupations were apt to be trivial or narrow or selfish; that their desires were earthly, and their tastes coarse; that what she held to be goodness was apt to be realised only as fear.  That innocence was but ignorance, or at least baffled curiosity.  That . . .  A flood of shame swept over her, and instinctively she put her hands before her burning face.  As usual, she was running all at once into extremes.  And above all these was borne upon her, and for the first time in her life, that she was herself a woman!  For a long time she sat quite still.  The train thrilled and roared on its way.  Crowded stations took and gave their quantum of living freight; but the young girl sat abstracted, unmoved, seemingly unconscious.  All the dominance and energy of her nature were at work.  If, indeed, she was a woman, and had to abide by the exigencies of her own sex, she would at least not be ruled and limited by woman's weakness. She would plan and act and manage things for herself, in her own way.  Whatever her thoughts might be, she could at least control her acts.  And those acts should be based not on woman's weakness, but on man's strength!     CHAPTER VII--THE NEED OF KNOWING   When Stephen announced her intention of going with her father to the Petty Sessions Court, there was consternation amongst the female population of Normanstand and Norwood.  Such a thing had not been heard of in the experiences of any of them.  Courts of Justice were places for men; and the lower courts dealt with a class of cases . . . It was quite impossible to imagine where any young lady could get such an idea . . .  Miss Laetitia Rowly recognised that she had a difficult task before her, for she was by now accustomed to Stephen's quiet method of having her own way.  She made a careful toilet before driving over to Normanstand.  Her wearing her best bonnet was a circumstance not unattended with dread for some one.  Behold her then, sailing into the great drawing-room at Normanstand with her mind so firmly fixed on the task before her as to be oblivious of minor considerations.  She was so fond of Stephen, and admired so truly her many beauties and fine qualities, that she was secure and without flaw in her purpose.  Stephen was in danger, and though she doubted if she would be able to effect any change, she was determined that at least she should not go into danger with her eyes unopened.  Stephen entered hastily and ran to her.  She loved her great-aunt; really and truly loved her.  And indeed it would have been strange if she had not, for from the earliest hour which she could recollect she had received from her nothing but the truest, fondest affection.  Moreover she deeply respected the old lady, her truth, her resolution, her kindliness, her genuine common-sense ability.  Stephen always felt safe with her aunt.  In the presence of others she might now and again have a qualm or a doubt; but not with her.  There was an abiding calm in her love, answering love realised and respected.  Her long and intimate knowledge of Laetitia made her aware of her moods.  She could read the signs of them.  She knew well the meaning of the bonnet which actually seemed to quiver as though it had a sentience of its own.  She knew well the cause of her aunt's perturbation; the pain which must be caused to her was perhaps the point of most resistance in herself--she having made up her mind to her new experience.  All she could do would be to try to reconcile her by the assurance of good intention; by reason, and by sweetness of manner.  When she had kissed her and sat beside her, holding her hand after her pretty way, she, seeing the elder woman somewhat at a loss, opened the subject herself:  'You look troubled, auntie!  I hope it is nothing serious?'  'It is, my dear!  Very serious!  Everything is serious to me which touches you.'  'Me, Auntie!'  Hypocrisy is a fine art.  'Yes! yes, Stephen.  Oh! my dear child, what is this I hear about your going to Petty Sessions with your father?'  'Oh, that!  Why, Auntie dear, you must not let that trouble you.  It is all right.  That is necessary!'  'Necessary!' the old lady's figure grew rigid and her voice was loud and high.  'Necessary for a young lady to go to a court house.  To hear low people speaking of low crimes.  To listen to cases of the most shocking kind; cases of low immorality; cases of a kind, of a nature of a--a--class that you are not supposed to know anything about.  Really, Stephen! . . . '  She was drawing away her hand in indignation.  But Stephen held it tight, as she said very sweetly:  'That is just it, Auntie.  I am so ignorant that I feel I should know more of the lives of those very people!'  Miss Laetitia interrupted:  'Ignorant!  Of course you are ignorant.  That is what you ought to be. Isn't it what we have all been devoting ourselves to effect ever since you were born?  Read your third chapter of Genesis and remember what came of eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.'  'I think the Tree of Knowledge must have been an orange tree.'  The old lady looked up, her interest aroused:  'Why?'  'Because ever since Eden other brides have worn its blossom!'  Her tone was demure.  Miss Rowly looked sharply at her, but her sharpness softened off into a smile.  'H'm!' she said, and was silent.  Stephen seized the opportunity to put her own case:  'Auntie dear, you must forgive me!  You really must, for my heart is set on this.  I assure you I am not doing it merely to please myself.  I have thought over the whole matter.  Father has always wished me to be in a position--a position of knowledge and experience--to manage Normanstand if I should ever succeed him.  From the earliest time I can remember he has always kept this before me, and though of course I did not at first understand what it meant, I have seemed in the last few years to know better.  Accordingly I learned all sorts of things under his care, and sometimes even without his help.  I have studied the estate map, and I have been over the estate books and read some of the leases and all such matters which they deal with in the estate office.  This only told me the bones of the thing.  I wanted to know more of our people; and so I made a point of going now and again to each house that we own.  Of seeing the people and talking with them familiarly; as familiarly as they would let me, and indeed so far as was possible considering my position.  For, Auntie dear, I soon began to learn--to learn in a way there was no mistaking--what my position is.  And so I want to get to know more of their ordinary lives; the darker as well as the lighter side.  I would like to do them good.  I can see how my dear daddy has always been a sort of power to help them, and I would like to carry on his work; to carry it further if I may.  But I must know.'  Her aunt had been listening with growing interest, and with growing respect too, for she realised the intense earnestness which lay behind the girl's words and her immediate purpose.  Her voice and manner were both softened:  'But, my dear, surely it is not necessary to go into the Court to know these things.  The results of each case become known.'  'That is just it, Auntie,' she answered quickly.  'The magistrates have to hear the two sides of the case before even they can make up their minds.  I want to hear both sides, too!  If people are guilty, I want to know the cause of their guilt.  If they are innocent, I want to know what the circumstances can be which make innocence look like guilt.  In my own daily life I may be in the way of just such judgments; and surely it is only right that judgment should be just!'  Again she paused; there rose before her mind that conversation in the churchyard when Harold had said that it was difficult for women to be just.  Miss Rowly reflected too.  She was becoming convinced that in principle the girl was right.  But the details were repugnant as ever to her; concentrating her mind on the point where she felt the ground firm under her, she made her objection:  'But, Stephen dear, there are so many cases that are sordid and painful!'  'The more need to know of sordid things; if sordidness plays so important a part in the tragedy of their lives!'  'But there are cases which are not within a woman's province.  Cases that touch sin . . . '  'What kind of sin do you mean?  Surely all wrong-doing is sin!'  The old lady was embarrassed.  Not by the fact, for she had been for too many years the mistress of a great household not to know something of the subject on which she spoke, but that she had to speak of such a matter to the young girl whom she so loved.  'The sin, my dear, of . . . of woman's wrong-doing . . . as woman . . . of motherhood, without marriage!'  All Stephen's nature seemed to rise in revolt.  'Why, Auntie,' she spoke out at once, 'you yourself show the want of the very experience I look for!'  'How? what?' asked the old lady amazed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25206"],["title","Rollo's Philosophy. [Air] (#0)"],["body","ROLLO'S  PHILOSOPHY.

BOSTON: PHILLIPS, SAMPSON, AND COMPANY   Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the Year 1855, by PHILLIPS, SAMPSON, & CO., In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts.     PREFACE.   The main design in view, in the discussions which are offered to the juvenile world, under the title of THE ROLLO PHILOSOPHY, relates rather to their effect upon the little reader's habits of thinking, reasoning, and observation, than to the additions they may make to his stock of knowledge. The benefit which the author intends that the reader shall derive from them, is an influence on the cast of his intellectual character, which is receiving its permanent form during the years to which these writings are adapted.  The acquisition of knowledge, however, though in this case a secondary, is by no means an unimportant object; and the discussion of the several topics proceeds accordingly, with regularity, upon a certain system of classification. This classification is based upon the more obvious external properties and relations of matter, and less upon those which, though they are more extensive and general in their nature, and, therefore, more suitable, in a strictly-scientific point of view, for the foundations of a system, are less apparent, and require higher powers of generalization and abstraction; and are, therefore, less in accordance with the genius and spirit of the _Rollo_ philosophy.  As teachers have, in some cases, done the author the honor to introduce some of the preceding works of this class into their schools, as reading books, &c., considerable reference has been had to this, in the form and manner of the discussion, and questions have been added to facilitate the use of the books in cases where parents or teachers may make the reading of them a regular exercise of instruction.

One pleasant morning, very early in the spring, Rollo's cousin Lucy came to call for Rollo to go on an expedition, which they had planned the day before. It was near the end of March, and the snow had become so consolidated by the warm sun in the days, and the hard frosts at night, that it would bear the children to walk upon it. The children called it the crust; but it was not, strictly speaking, a crust, for the snow was compact and solid, not merely upon the top, but nearly throughout the whole mass, down to the ground.  Rollo and Lucy were going to have an expedition upon the crust. Rollo had a sled, and they were going to put upon the sled such things as they should need, and Rollo was to draw it, while Lucy and Nathan, Rollo's little brother, were to walk along by his side.  Rollo's sled was ready at the back door, when Lucy came. Lucy brought with her some provisions for a luncheon, in a basket. This was her part of the preparation. Rollo got his axe, and one or two boards a little longer than the sled, which he said were to make seats. He also had a tinder-box, and some matches, to enable him to make a fire. When all things were ready, the three children set out together.  Rollo drew the sled, with the boards, the basket, and some other things upon it, all bound together securely with a cord. The load appeared to be considerable in bulk, but it was not heavy, and Rollo drew it along very easily. They were not obliged to confine themselves to the roads and paths, for the snow was hard in every direction, and they could go over the fields wherever they pleased. In one place, where the snow was very deep on the side of a hill, they went right over the top of a stone wall.  It was a cloudy day, but calm. This was favorable. The sky being overcast, kept the sun from thawing the snow; but yet their father told them that probably it would begin to grow soft before they came home, and, if so, they would have to come home in a certain sled road, which Jonas had made that winter by hauling wood. He advised them not to encamp at any great distance from the sled road.  They came at last to a pleasant spot on the margin of a wood, near where there was a spring. The rocks around the spring were all covered with snow, and the little stream, which in summer flowed from the spring, was frozen and buried up entirely out of sight. But the spring itself was open, which Rollo said was very fortunate, as they might want some water to drink.  Here they encamped. Rollo cut some stakes, which he drove down into the snow, and contrived to make a rude sort of table with his boards. He also cut a large number of hemlock branches, which Lucy and Nathan dragged out and spread around the table for them to sit upon. Then Rollo built a fire of sticks, which he gathered in the wood. The ground was covered with snow, so that it would have been very difficult for him to have found any sticks, were it not that some kinds of trees, in the woods, have a great many small branches near the bottom, which are dead and dry. These Rollo cut off, and Lucy and Nathan dragged them out, and put them on the fire when he had kindled it. The fire was a little way from the table, with the carpet of hemlock boughs between.  There was a high hill covered with snow at a little distance, and, after they had eaten their luncheon, Rollo said,--  \"O Lucy, we will play go up the mountains. There is a hill for us. That shall be Chimborazo.\"  \"Well,\" said Lucy, \"if you will cut us some long staves.\"  Accordingly Rollo went into the wood, and selected some tall and slender young trees, about an inch in diameter, and cut two for Lucy, two for Nathan, and two for himself. These he trimmed up smoothly, and each of the children took one in each hand. They played that Rollo was the guide, and Lucy was the philosopher. Nathan was the philosopher's servant. Rollo conducted them safely to the summit; but just after they got there, it began to snow.  The snow descended in large flakes, and Rollo was delighted to see it; but Lucy seemed a little anxious. She said that, if there should be much snow, it would make it hard for Nathan to get home, and she thought that they had better go down the mountain immediately, and set out for home. Rollo was rather unwilling to go, but he allowed himself to be persuaded, and so they all came down the mountain together.  They packed up their things as quick as they could, leaving the fire to burn itself out, only Rollo first piled on all the hemlock branches,--which made a great crackling. The snow began to fall faster. The air was full of the large flakes, which floated slowly down, and lodged gently upon the old snow.  The children went along very successfully for some time, but at length Rollo lost his way. The air was so full of snow-flakes, that he could see only a very little way before him; and the old snow covered the ground, so as to hide all the old marks, and to alter the general aspect of the fields so much, that Rollo was completely lost. He, however, did not say anything about it, but wandered on, Lucy and Nathan wondering all the while why they did not get home; until at length they came across a track in the snow.  \"O! see this track,\" said Rollo. \"Here is a track, where somebody else has been along with a sled.\"  \"Yes,\" said Lucy, \"some boys, who have gone out to slide, perhaps.\"  The track was partly obliterated by the snow which had fallen upon it since the boys that made it had gone along. Rollo wondered whose track it could be. He said that he thought it very probable it was Henry's. Lucy thought that it might be the track of some children, that had gone out to find them.  \"At any rate,\" said Rollo, \"we will follow the track a little way, and see what it leads to. Perhaps we shall overtake the boys.\"  Accordingly Rollo turned along in the track, but Lucy stopped.  \"No, Rollo,\" said she, \"we must go the other way if we want to find the boys;--the track is going the other way. But never mind,\" she added, \"I don't want to find the boys; I want to go home; so we will go this way.\"  Rollo went on, secretly pleased to find the track, for he supposed that by retracing it, as he was doing, it would lead him back home. He had, however, a great curiosity to know who could have made it; and in fact the mystery was soon unraveled.  For, after following the track a short distance, they saw before them a large, dark spot upon the snow, and, on drawing near to it, to see what it was, they found it was the place of their own encampment; and the track which they were following was their own track, leading them back to the mouldering remains of their own fire. They had gone round in a great circle, and come back upon their own course. Rollo looked exceedingly blank and confused at this unexpected termination of the clew, which he had hoped was to have led him out of his difficulty. What he was to do now,"]]]
