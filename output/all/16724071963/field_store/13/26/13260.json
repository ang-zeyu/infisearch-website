At last the strange party drew up in front of the barn and stopped. Farmer Green led Ebenezer into his stall. And then he took the jug, with Grumpy Weasel still inside in, and in spite of Spot's protests set it high up on a shelf in the barn.  It was easy for Grumpy, after that, to crawl out of the jug. He scurried along the shelf, climbed up the wall, and glided through a crack in the ceiling, to hide himself in the haymow above.  \"Old Spot didn't get me this time!\" he said gleefully. \"Not by a jugful, he didn't!\"     XXI  A NEW SUIT   Throughout Pleasant Valley the very name of Grumpy Weasel was a bugaboo. Those of his size, and many a good deal bigger than he, learned early to avoid him.  One of the first things Sandy Chipmunk's mother did was to teach him to beware of Grumpy. And twice during his first summer Sandy caught a glimpse of Grumpy as he flashed past like a brown streak, with a gleam of white showing underneath.  It was lucky for Sandy that on both occasions Grumpy was intent on chasing somebody or other. And each time that Sandy told his mother what he had seen, Mrs. Chipmunk said that she hoped it would never happen again.  \"I'm glad that you know what he looks like, anyhow,\" she added.  \"Oh, I'll know him if I see him!\" Sandy cried.  \"Don't stop for a second look!\" his mother warned him.  \"I won't!\" he promised. \"I won't even stop to say, 'How do you do!'\"  \"I should hope not!\" Mrs. Chipmunk said severely.  So Sandy Chipmunk went through his first summer on the watch for a long, slender, brownish shape. But he never saw Grumpy Weasel again. And winter found the Chipmunk family all unharmed, and very comfortable in their cozy house below frost line.  On mild days Sandy liked to visit the world above and find a rock bare of snow, where he could enjoy the sunshine.  It was on one of those outings that he caught sight of a stranger headed for the stone wall near-by. At first Sandy missed seeing him, against the snow. But when he reached the wind-swept wall Sandy couldn't help noticing him. He was a slim gentleman and--except for his black-tipped tail--was dressed all in white.  After spending the winter underground Sandy Chipmunk was glad to talk with the first person he saw. So he called to the stranger that it was a fine day, wasn't it?  The other wheeled about so quickly that Sandy couldn't help laughing.  \"Don't be nervous!\" Sandy cried. \"I won't hurt you!\"  But the stranger didn't answer. Once he opened his mouth. And Sandy Chipmunk had a queer feeling then that he had met the fellow before. That mouth had plenty of white, needle-like teeth. It had a cruel look, too.  Then the stranger jumped straight toward Sandy Chipmunk. And in that instant Sandy knew who he was. No one could leap like that except Grumpy Weasel!  Sandy turned and ran madly for shelter. Luckily he had the advantage of Grumpy in one way. He had a bare ledge to run on, while Grumpy Weasel had to flounder for some distance through a snow-choked hollow.  So Sandy escaped. And it was lucky that Grumpy didn't find the door to the Chipmunk family's burrow. If he had he would have gone right in himself.  Mrs. Chipmunk blamed herself for Sandy's adventure. She had never remembered to tell her son that every fall Grumpy Weasel changed his summer dress for the one in which Sandy had just seen him.     XXII  GRUMPY'S THREAT   Meeting Grumpy Weasel in the woods one day, Tommy Fox stopped to have a chat with him. He always liked to chat with Grumpy, it was so easy to get him angry, and such fun to see him fly into a passion.  \"You're looking very elegant in your winter suit,\" Tommy Fox remarked. \"White is becoming to you--there's no doubt of that. And that black tip on the end of your tail is just what's needed to complete your costume. It matches your eyes nicely.... You must have a good tailor.\"  [Illustration: Sandy Chipmunk Runs From Grumpy Weasel. (_Page 96_)]  People were apt to be wary of Tommy Fox when fine words dripped from his mouth like that. It usually meant that he was bent on some mischief. And now Grumpy Weasel looked at him suspiciously.  \"If you admire my clothes so much why don't you get some like them?\" he demanded.  Tommy Fox shook his head mournfully.  \"I'd like to,\" he said, \"but I'm too humble a person to dress like a king, in ermine. My family have always worn red. The neighbors wouldn't know me in anything else. Or if they did they'd say I was putting on airs.\"  \"If you want to know what I think, I'll tell you that red's entirely too good for you,\" Grumpy Weasel sneered.  Tommy Fox smiled somewhat sourly. Grumpy Weasel's remark did not please him. But he managed to say nothing disagreeable.  \"I suppose,\" he went on, \"you've met the newcomer in our valley who dresses as you do, in white and black?\"  \"What's that you say?\" Grumpy Weasel barked. \"Who's gone and copied my cold-weather clothes? If I meet him I'll make it hot for him.\"  \"Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned the matter,\" Tommy Fox said softly. \"I don't like to displease you. And I don't want to get a stranger into trouble either, just as he has come to spend the winter amongst us.  \"And besides,\" Tommy added, \"it would be a shame for you to quarrel with the stranger because he happens to choose your favorite colors. That only goes to show that your tastes are alike.\"  \"That's exactly what I object to!\" Grumpy Weasel complained, getting much excited. \"If his tastes are the same as mine he'll want to come and hunt along my stone wall. And there'll be trouble if he does that! The fur will fly!\"  Tommy Fox turned his head away, for he simply had to enjoy a grin and he didn't want Grumpy Weasel to see it.  \"I'm sorry I spoke about the stranger,\" he said glibly, as soon as he could keep his face straight. \"But I thought the news would please you.\"  \"It would certainly please me to meet him,\" Grumpy Weasel declared fiercely. \"And it would please me much more than it would him, I can tell you.\"  \"It wouldn't be treating a newcomer well to let him wander through the woods when you feel as you do about him. I ought to warn him to leave Pleasant Valley before it's too late,\" Tommy said.  \"It would be treating him better to give him a good lesson before he goes,\" Grumpy Weasel said. \"You needn't say a word to him about my wanting to meet him. Let the fur fly first! And then he'll flee.  \"That's my way of getting rid of strangers!\"     XXIII  A BOLD STRANGER   Tommy Fox had carefully kept from Grumpy Weasel the name of the stranger who was dressed like Grumpy, in white and black. It happened that he wore feathers--this newcomer. And that was one reason why Tommy Fox had had to grin when Grumpy threatened to \"make the fur fly\" when he met the unknown.  Another reason why Tommy had laughed at Grumpy's blustering was that the stranger was quite able to take care of himself in a fight. He belonged to the Snowy Owl family, being bigger, even, than Solomon Owl. And what with his hooked beak and his strong talons he was a dangerous fellow to meet. Although Grumpy Weasel could easily handle a rabbit or a wild duck a dozen times his own size, because they were unarmed, he would have had no chance at all with Mr. Snowy Owl.  All this made Tommy Fox chuckle and grin, as he left Grumpy and loped off towards Cedar Swamp, where Mr. Snowy Owl was spending the winter. Unlike Solomon Owl, and his cousin Simon Screecher, Mr. Snowy Owl did not turn night into day. So Tommy Fox found him wide awake and ready for a fight or a frolic, whichever might come his way.  He was a handsome bird--this newcomer--in his showy white suit, spotted with black. And he gave Tommy Fox a bold, hard look, acting for all the world as if he had spent his whole life in Pleasant Valley, instead of merely two short weeks.  Now, Mr. Snowy Owl knew a good deal about such rascals as Tommy Fox. So he said at once, \"What's on your mind, young man? You've come here on mischief and you needn't deny it.\"  Well, Tommy Fox saw that he couldn't deceive Mr. Owl very much. So he grinned at him and told him about the talk he had just had with Grumpy Weasel.  \"He's so eager to meet you it would be too bad to disappoint him,\" Tommy observed. \"He wants the fur to fly, you know.\"  Although he had no ears (at least, so far as could be seen) Mr. Snowy Owl had listened closely to Tommy Fox's story. And he must have heard plainly enough, for he said quickly that he would call on Grumpy Weasel that very day. \"I'll start right now,\" he said, \"and I'll reach Grumpy Weasel's hunting ground before you're out of the swamp.\"  \"I wish you'd wait a bit, till I can get there myself,\" Tommy Fox told him.  Mr. Snowy Owl agreed to that. And after lingering until he thought Tommy must have had time to run and find Grumpy Weasel he rose above the tops of the cedars and sailed off to join them himself.  \"I'm glad I came here to spend the winter,\" he muttered. \"Everybody's been very pleasant so far. And after people hear how I've settled with this Weasel person the folks in Pleasant Valley will be pretty polite to me, or I'll know the reason why.\"     XXIV  FUR AND FEATHERS   To find Grumpy Weasel, Tommy Fox went straight back to the place where he had left him. It was easy, then, to follow his queer tracks. Grumpy's legs were so short that they did not lift his lean body clear of the deep snow, except when he jumped very high; so his trail looked somewhat like that of a snake with legs.  As soon as Tommy overtook him he asked Grumpy if he had seen the stranger yet, who was dressed all in white and black, like him.  \"No, I haven't. But I'm on the lookout for him all the time,\" said Grumpy.  \"Where are you looking?\" Tommy inquired.  \"Oh! Everywhere!\" Grumpy replied. \"Behind the trees and in the bushes and back of the stone wall!\"  \"Have you seen any new tracks?\" Tommy persisted.  \"Not one!\" Grumpy admitted. And then he thought he caught the flicker of a smile on Tommy Fox's narrow face. \"If there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24881"],["title","The Tale of Grumpy Weasel (#7)"],["body"," no such person--if you've been deceiving me----\" he began angrily.  \"I promise you that there _is_ such a stranger in the neighborhood!\" Tommy cried. \"And if you don't meet him to-day I'll be as disappointed as you.\"  \"It seems to me,\" Grumpy Weasel snapped, \"you're altogether too anxious over this business. Everybody knows you're tricky. And I begin to think you're trying to get me into trouble.\"  It was wonderful, the way Tommy Fox could keep his temper. No matter what people said to him he could still smile if it would help him to have his way. And now he kept up a never-ending chatter, without saying anything in particular.  The snow was deep enough to have covered such hiding places as Grumpy Weasel liked. The stone wall, indeed, offered about the only crannies; and that was some distance away. Tommy Fox had noticed that. And that was why he was trying to keep Grumpy Weasel where he was. For Tommy expected Mr. Snowy Owl at any moment.  \"You are talking foolishness,\" Grumpy told Tommy Fox at last. \"I don't care to waste my time listening to you.\" And he turned away.  \"One moment, please!\" Tommy begged, for the sly rascal had just caught a glimpse of Mr. Snowy Owl hovering above the trees.  \"What do you want now?\" Grumpy Weasel scolded, as he paused close by the old hemlock where Solomon Owl sometimes sat and abused him.  \"I want to see the fur fly,\" Tommy Fox answered wickedly.  For a moment Grumpy Weasel couldn't think what he meant. But suddenly he saw a large whitish shape dropping upon him out of the sky. He knew then, in a flash, that Tommy Fox had deceived him.  A moment more and it was all over. At least, it seemed so to Tommy Fox. Whatever had happened had taken place so quickly that he couldn't see it clearly. But there was Mr. Snowy Owl, sitting on a limb of the hemlock, where he had perched after staying half a second's time on the ground.  And Grumpy Weasel was no longer to be seen, anywhere.  \"Did--did you swallow him?\" Tommy Fox stammered.  Mr. Snowy Owl looked puzzled.  \"I don't know,\" he replied. \"Perhaps I did! If I didn't I don't know where he is.\"  Tommy Fox couldn't help looking disappointed. \"I'm sorry about one thing,\" he said. \"It was all done so quickly I didn't see the fur fly!\"  Then there was a faint sound above them. And looking up, Tommy and Mr. Owl saw Grumpy Weasel's head sticking out of a small hole high up in the tree-trunk.  As they watched him Grumpy Weasel seemed to be saying something to them. They couldn't hear what it was. But no doubt it was nothing pleasant.     XXV  PETER MINK'S PROMISE   It happened, on a bleak winter's day, that Grumpy Weasel was strolling along the bank of Broad Brook when all at once he heard a squall. Instantly he whirled around. There was something about the cry that sounded familiar. And while he searched the stream up and down with his sharp eyes he grew angrier every moment.  \"Unless I'm mistaken that's my good-for-nothing cousin, Peter Mink,\" Grumpy muttered. \"I'll teach him not to squall at me--the rascal!\"  He did not have to look long before he caught sight of his cousin. Peter Mink was crouched under the overhanging bank, not far from the edge of the frozen surface of the brook. And he squalled again when he saw that Grumpy had discovered him.  \"Stop that!\" Grumpy Weasel bellowed. He was not greatly afraid of Peter Mink, though his cousin was much bigger than he. \"I'll have you know that I don't allow people to bawl at me, even if we are distantly related.\"  \"I wasn't bawling at you,\" Peter Mink answered. And he was strangely polite, for him. \"I was calling for help. Can't you see that my foot is caught in a trap?\"  At that Grumpy jumped down upon the ice and took a good look at Peter Mink. He saw, then, that Peter spoke the truth. \"This trap hurts my foot, I can tell you,\" Peter Mink whined.  \"Maybe it will teach you not to screech at people,\" Grumpy told him.  \"You're going to help me, aren't you?\" Peter Mink asked his cousin anxiously.  \"That trap belongs to Farmer Green's hired man,\" Grumpy informed Peter Mink. \"I saw him when he set it there. Perhaps you would like to have me send word to him that you're using it.\"  \"Oh! Don't do that!\" Peter begged piteously.  \"Well, then--suppose I get old dog Spot to come and see what he can do! He'd have you out of that trap in no time!\"  But that suggestion didn't suit Peter Mink any better.  \"For goodness' sake, can't you think of something else?\" he wailed.  His voice rose higher and higher as he spoke. And Grumpy Weasel showed his sharp teeth as he warned Peter Mink again not to squall at him, for he wouldn't stand it.  At last Peter saw that Grumpy did not intend to help him at all. So it occurred to him that perhaps he could hire his cousin to free him from the trap. \"I'd do anything for you if you could help me out of this fix,\" he said finally.  \"Will you drive Mr. Snowy Owl away from Pleasant Valley?\" Grumpy cried.  \"Certainly!\" said Peter Mink with great promptness, as if that were the easiest matter in the world.  That answer surprised Grumpy Weasel. He had no idea that Peter Mink could do any such thing. And he said as much, too.  \"You understand,\" Peter explained, \"it may take me some time to get rid of him. It's mid-winter now. But I can promise you that I'll have him out of the valley by April Fool's Day!\"     XXVI  HOW GRUMPY HELPED   Grumpy Weasel wondered how Peter Mink was going to get Mr. Snowy Owl out of Pleasant Valley. He had never dreamed that Peter could do it. But as he thought the matter over he remembered that Peter was a good deal bigger than himself.  \"If I were Peter Mink's size I would give Mr. Snowy Owl the worst punishing he ever had!\" Grumpy exclaimed under his breath. \"So maybe Peter can do as he claims, after all.\"  \"Very well!\" Grumpy Weasel told Peter Mink. \"This is a bargain. I'll help you out of the trap. And you'll rid Pleasant Valley of Mr. Snowy Owl by April Fool's Day.\"  \"Agreed!\" Peter Mink cried. \"And now, how are you going to set me free?\"  \"I'm going to bite your leg off,\" Grumpy Weasel said cheerfully.  \"Oh, no! You're not going to do that!\" Peter Mink howled. \"I don't want you to do that!\"  \"I made a bargain with you,\" Grumpy Weasel reminded him, \"and I intend to carry out my part of it.\"  \"Stop a moment,\" Peter Mink cried. For Grumpy Weasel, with his back arched like a cat's, and his white whiskers twitching, had already taken a step towards him. \"If you bite off my leg I'd never be able to get rid of Mr. Snowy Owl.\"  That brought Grumpy Weasel up short. He thought deeply for a moment; and then he exclaimed: \"I have it! You must bite off your own leg!\"  But Peter Mink proved a hard one to please.  \"You don't understand!\" he said. \"If I lose a leg I know I never could get Mr. Snowy Owl out of the valley.\"  At that Grumpy Weasel lost his temper completely. With a cry of rage he sprang at his cousin, Peter Mink, prisoner though he was. And Grumpy would have buried his white teeth in him except for just one thing. As he leaped forward Peter Mink leaped backward. And in that moment Peter freed himself. He had been caught only by the merest tip of a toe, anyhow. And now he crouched with his back against the bank of the brook, facing Grumpy Weasel with mouth wide open. His meekness had dropped off him like an old coat. And Grumpy Weasel knew better than to get within his reach. In fact he turned polite himself, all at once.  \"There!\" he said. \"I got you out of the trap, as I had planned to all the time. I knew that if I could make you jump you'd pull your foot loose.\"  Well, Peter Mink hardly believed that. But he thought there was no use of saying so.  He was glad enough to escape Farmer Green's hired man's trap without having a dispute over the way it happened.  \"I hope you'll keep your promise,\" Grumpy told Peter Mink. \"If Mr. Snowy Owl doesn't leave these parts by April Fool's Day I won't like it very well. You know you agreed to get him away from here by that time.\"  \"Oh! He'll be gone by then,\" said Peter Mink lightly. \"He always leaves at the end of the winter, because he spends his summers in the Far North.\"  When he heard that, Grumpy Weasel was angry as anything.  \"Then Mr. Owl is likely to be back here next fall,\" he said quickly.  \"I dare say,\" Peter Mink admitted carelessly.  Grumpy Weasel backed cautiously away before he said another word. But when he had whisked into a great willow that leaned over Broad Brook he told his cousin what he thought about him.  As for Peter Mink--he was nursing his injured paw (in his mouth!) and he said never a word.
