These data also are of considerable interest when we compare them with data relating to American beers published by the department in 1887.[1] A comparison of these two sets of figures shows that beers made at the present time have a much lower percentage of alcohol and are made from a wort containing a much lower percentage of solids than beers made a generation ago. The average of 28 samples examined and reported in 1887 in the publication cited[1] showed an average alcohol content of 4.63 per cent by weight and solids in the original wort of 14.79 per cent, while the average of 72 beers representing the products now on the market showed an average of 3.52 per cent by weight of alcohol and solids in the original wort of 12.50 per cent. This is a reduction of 1.11 per cent by weight of alcohol and 2.23 per cent of solids in the original wort.  [Footnote 1: U. S. Dept. Agr., Div. Chem., Bul. 13, 1887, pt. 3, p. 282.]   CONCLUSIONS.  The all-malt beers made in this country contain higher percentages of protein than the all-malt beers made in Europe, owing to the use in this country of a barley high in protein.  The use of rice, corn or corn products, and brewer's sugar as substitutes for malt reduces the content of protein, ash, and phosphoric acid in the finished beer.  This difference, as regards the protein, ash, and phosphoric acid, is a sufficient basis for distinguishing the all-malt beers made in this country from those containing the commercial mixtures of rice, corn, cerealin, and brewer's sugar.  It is necessary to calculate analytical results to the basis of a common wort in order to interpret them properly.                     *       *       *       *       *                               ADDITIONAL COPIES                  OF THIS PUBLICATION MAY BE PROCURED FROM                      THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS                         GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE                              WASHINGTON, D.

Now scientists agree that space-flight may very soon become a reality.  _Space Platform_ tells of man's first step into outer space ... of the difficulties and dangers of reaching for the stars. It is also an exciting adventure. When young Joe Kenmore came to Bootstrap to install pilot gyros in the Platform he hadn't bargained for sabotage or murder or love. But Joe learned that ruthless agents were determined to wreck the project. He found that the beautiful girl he loved, and men like The Chief, a rugged Indian steelworker, and Mike, a midget who made up for his size by brains, would have to fight with their bare hands to make man's age old dream of space travel come true!         *       *       *       *       *  _This science-fiction novel was originally published by Shasta Publishers._   _Of other books by Murray Leinster, the following are science-fiction:_  SIDEWISE IN TIME  MURDER MADNESS  THE LAST SPACE SHIP  THE LAWS OF CHANCE (Anthology)  GREAT STORIES OF SCIENCE FICTION (editor)   This Pocket Book includes every word contained in the original, higher-priced edition.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   This acknowledgment is necessary if I am to say thanks to some experts to whom I am indebted. There is Captain Charles Benjamin, who read over the aviation parts of this book with pursed lips and a belligerent attitude toward questionable statements of fact or observation. There is Dr. John Drury Clark, whose authoritative knowledge of rocket fuels was the basis for admitted but not extravagant extrapolation on my part. There is the crew of a four-engined transport ship, who argued over my manuscript and settled the argument by a zestful, full-scale crash-landing drill--repeat, \"drill\"--expressly to make sure I had described all the procedure just right. There is Willy Ley, whom I would like to exempt from responsibility for any statement in the book, while I acknowledge the value of personal talks with him and the pleasure anybody who has ever read his books will recognize. And there is Dr. Hugh S. Rice of the Hayden Planetarium, who will probably be surprised to find that I feel I owe him gratitude. They are in great part responsible for the factual matter in this book.  I think I may add, though, that I worked on it too.                                           MURRAY LEINSTER \"Ardudwy\" Gloucester, Va.     _Space Platform_     1   There wasn't anything underneath but clouds, and there wasn't anything overhead but sky. Joe Kenmore looked out the plane window past the co-pilot's shoulder. He stared ahead to where the sky and cloud bank joined--it was many miles away--and tried to picture the job before him. Back in the cargo space of the plane there were four big crates. They contained the pilot gyros for the most important object then being built on Earth, and it wouldn't work properly without them. It was Joe's job to take that highly specialized, magnificently precise machinery to its destination, help to install it, and see to its checking after it was installed.  He felt uneasy. Of course the pilot and co-pilot--the only two other people on the transport plane--knew their stuff. Every imaginable precaution would be taken to make sure that a critically essential device like the pilot gyro assembly would get safely where it belonged. It would be--it was being--treated as if it were a crate of eggs instead of massive metal, smoothed and polished and lapped to a precision practically unheard of. But just the same Joe was worried. He'd seen the pilot gyro assembly made. He'd helped on it. He knew how many times a thousandth of an inch had been split in machining its bearings, and the breath-weight balance of its moving parts. He'd have liked to be back in the cargo compartment with it, but only the pilot's cabin was pressurized, and the ship was at eighteen thousand feet, flying west by south.  He tried to get his mind off that impulse by remembering that at eighteen thousand feet a good half of the air on Earth was underneath him, and by hoping that the other half would be as easy to rise above when the gyros were finally in place and starting out for space. The gyros, of course, were now on their way to be installed in the artificial satellite to be blasted up and set in an orbit around the Earth as the initial stage of that figurative stepladder by which men would make their first attempt to reach the stars. Until that Space Platform left the ground, the gyros were Joe's responsibility.  The plane's co-pilot leaned back in his chair and stretched luxuriously. He loosened his safety belt and got up. He stepped carefully past the column between the right- and left-hand pilot seats. That column contained a fraction of the innumerable dials and controls the pilots of a modern multi-engine plane have to watch and handle. The co-pilot went to the coffeepot and flipped a switch. Joe fidgeted again on his improvised seat. Again he wished that he could be riding in back with the crates. But it would be silly to insist on perching somewhere in the freight compartment.  There was a steady roaring in the cabin--the motors. One's ears got accustomed to it, and by now the noise sounded as if it were heard through cushions. Presently the coffeepot bubbled, unheard. The co-pilot lighted a cigarette. Then he drew a paper cup of coffee and handed it to the pilot. The pilot seemed negligently to contemplate some dozens of dials, all of which were duly duplicated on the right-hand, co-pilot's side. The co-pilot glanced at Joe.  \"Coffee?\"  \"Thanks,\" said Joe. He took the paper cup.  The co-pilot said: \"Everything okay with you?\"  \"I'm all right,\" said Joe. He realized that the co-pilot felt talkative. He explained: \"Those crates I'm traveling with----. The family firm's been working on that machinery for months. It was finished with the final grinding done practically with feather dusters. I can't help worrying about it. There was four months' work in just lapping the shafts and balancing rotors. We made a telescope mounting once, for an observatory in South Africa, but compared to this gadget we worked on that one blindfolded!\"  \"Pilot gyros, eh?\" said the co-pilot. \"That's what the waybill said. But if they were all right when they left the plant, they'll be all right when they are delivered.\"  Joe said ruefully: \"Still I'd feel better riding back there with them.\"  \"Sabotage bad at the plant?\" asked the co-pilot. \"Tough!\"  \"Sabotage? No. Why should there be sabotage?\" demanded Joe.  The co-pilot said mildly: \"Not quite everybody is anxious to see the Space Platform take off. Not everybody! What on earth do you think is the biggest problem out where they're building it?\"  \"I wouldn't know,\" admitted Joe. \"Keeping the weight down? But there is a new rocket fuel that's supposed to be all right for sending the Platform up. Wasn't that the worst problem? Getting a rocket fuel with enough power per pound?\"  The co-pilot sipped his coffee and made a face. It was too hot.  \"Fella,\" he said drily, \"that stuff was easy! The slide-rule boys did that. The big job in making a new moon for the Earth is keeping it from being blown up before it can get out to space! There are a few gentlemen who thrive on power politics. They know that once the Platform's floating serenely around the Earth, with a nice stock of atom-headed guided missiles on board, power politics is finished. So they're doing what they can to keep the world as it's always been--equipped with just one moon and many armies. And they're doing plenty, if you ask me!\"  \"I've heard----\" began Joe.  \"You haven't heard the half of it,\" said the co-pilot. \"The Air Transport has lost nearly as many planes and more men on this particular airlift than it did in Korea while that was the big job. I don't know how many other men have been killed. But there's a strictly local hot war going on out where we're headed. No holds barred! Hadn't you heard?\"  It sounded exaggerated. Joe said politely: \"I heard there was cloak-and-dagger stuff going on.\"  The pilot drained his cup and handed it to the co-pilot. He said: \"He thinks you're kidding him.\" He turned back to the contemplation of the instruments before him and the view out the transparent plastic of the cabin windows.  \"He does?\" The co-pilot said to Joe, \"You've got security checks around your plant. They weren't put there for fun. It's a hundred times worse where the whole Platform's being built.\"  \"Security?\" said Joe. He shrugged. \"We know everybody who"]]]
