He could have gotten the master key from Colonel Fennister, but he hadn't the time.  The box door dilated open, and Dr. Smathers looked inside.  When he came across the bottles, he swore under his breath, then flung the spaceman's arm down and ran from the room.         *       *       *       *       *  \"That's where he was getting his vitamins, then,\" said Dr. Pilar as he looked over the assortment of bottles that he and Smathers had taken from the locker box. \"Look at 'em. He's got almost as many pills as you have.\" He looked up at the physician. \"Do you suppose it was just vitamins that kept him going?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Smathers. \"I've given him massive doses of every one of the vitamins--from my own supplies, naturally. He may rally round, if that's what it was. But why would he suddenly be affected by the stuff _now_?\"  \"Maybe he quit taking them?\" Pilar made it half a question.  \"It's possible,\" agreed Smathers. \"A hypochondriac will sometimes leave off dosing himself if there's a doctor around to do it for him. As long as the subconscious need is filled, he's happy.\" But he was shaking his head.  \"What's the matter?\" Pilar asked.  Smathers pointed at the bottles. \"Some of those are mislabeled. They all say vitamins of one kind or another on the label, but the tablets inside aren't all vitamins. MacNeil's been giving himself all kinds of things.\"  Pilar's eyes widened a trifle. \"Do you suppose--\"  \"That one of them is an antidote?\" Smathers snorted. \"Hell, anything's possible at this stage of the game. The best thing we can do, I think, is give him a dose of everything there, and see what happens.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Yeah, Doc, yeah,\" said MacNeil smiling weakly, \"I feel a little better. Not real good, you understand, but better.\"  Under iron control, Dr. Smathers put on his best bedside manner, while Pilar and Petrelli hovered in the background.  \"Now, look, son,\" said Smathers in a kindly voice, \"we found the medicines in your locker box.\"  MacNeil's face fell, making him look worse. He'd dropped down close to death before the conglomerate mixture which had been pumped into his stomach had taken effect, and Smathers had no desire to put too much pressure on the man.  \"Now, don't worry about it, son,\" he said hurriedly; \"We'll see to it that you aren't punished for it. It's all right. We just want to ask you a few questions.\"  \"Sure, Doc; anything,\" said MacNeil. But he still looked apprehensive.  \"Have you been dosing yourself pretty regularly with these things?\"  \"Well ... uh ... well, yeah. Sometimes.\" He smiled feebly. \"Sometimes I didn't feel so good, and I didn't want to bother the medics. You know how it is.\"  \"Very considerate, I'm sure,\" said Smathers with just the barest trace of sarcasm, which, fortunately, fell unheeded on MacNeil's ears. \"But which ones did you take every day?\"  \"Just the vitamins.\" He paused. \"And ... uh ... maybe an aspirin. The only things I took real regular were the vitamins, though. That's all right ain't it? Ain't vitamins food?\"  \"Sure, son, sure. What did you take yesterday morning, before you got so sick?\"  \"Just the vitamins,\" MacNeil said stoutly. \"I figured that since you docs was takin' care of me, I didn't need no medicine.\"  Dr. Smathers glanced up hopelessly at the other two men. \"That eliminates the vitamins,\" he said, _sotto voce_. He looked back at the patient. \"No aspirin? No APC's? You didn't have a headache at all?\"  MacNeil shook his head firmly. \"I don't get headaches much.\" Again he essayed a feeble smile. \"I ain't like you guys, I don't overwork my brains.\"  \"I'm sure you don't,\" said Smathers. Then his eyes gleamed. \"You have quite a bit of stomach trouble, eh? Your digestion bad?\"  \"Yeah. You know; I told you about it. I get heartburn and acid stomach pretty often. And constipation.\"  \"What do you take for that?\"  \"Oh, different things. Sometimes a soda pill, sometimes milk of magnesia, different things.\"  Smathers looked disappointed, but before he could say anything, Dr. Petrelli's awed but excited voice came from behind him. \"Do you take Epsom salts?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"I wonder--\" said Petrelli softly.  And then he left for the lab at a dead run.         *       *       *       *       *  Colonel Fennister and Major Grodski sat at the table in the lab, munching on banana-pears, blissfully enjoying the sweet flavor and the feeling of fullness they were imparting to their stomachs.  \"MacNeil can't stay in the service, of course,\" said Fennister. \"That is, not in any space-going outfit. We'll find an Earthside job for him, though. Maybe even give him a medal. You sure these things won't hurt us?\"  Dr. Pilar started to speak, but Petrelli cut him off.  \"Positive,\" said the chemist. \"After we worked it out, it was pretty simple. The 'poison' was a chelating agent, that's all. You saw the test run I did for you.\"  The colonel nodded. He'd watched the little chemist add an iron salt to some of the fruit juice and seen it turn red. Then he'd seen it turn pale yellow when a magnesium salt was added. \"But what's a chelating agent?\" he asked.  \"There are certain organic compounds,\" Dr. Petrelli explained, \"that are ... well, to put it simply, they're attracted by certain ions. Some are attracted by one ion, some by another. The chelating molecules cluster around the ion and take it out of circulation, so to speak; they neutralize it, in a way.  \"Look, suppose you had a dangerous criminal on the loose, and didn't have any way to kill him. If you kept him surrounded by policemen all the time, he couldn't do anything. See?\"  The Space Service Officers nodded their understanding.  \"We call that 'sequestering' the ion,\" the chemist continued. \"It's used quite frequently in medicine, as Dr. Smathers will tell you. For instance, beryllium ions in the body can be deadly; beryllium poisoning is nasty stuff. But if the patient is treated with the proper chelating agent, the ions are surrounded and don't do any more damage. They're still there, but now they're harmless, you see.\"  \"Well, then,\" said the colonel, \"just what did this stuff in the fruit do?\"  \"It sequestered the iron ions in the body. They couldn't do their job. The body had to quit making hemoglobin, because hemoglobin needs iron. So, since there was no hemoglobin in the bloodstream, the patient developed sudden pernicious anemia and died of oxygen starvation.\"  Colonel Fennister looked suddenly at Dr. Smathers. \"I thought you said the blood looked normal.\"  \"It did,\" said the physician. \"The colorimeter showed extra hemoglobin, in fact. But the chelating agent in the fruit turns red when it's connected up with iron--in fact, it's even redder than blood hemoglobin. And the molecules containing the sequestered iron tend to stick to the outside of the red blood cells, which threw the whole test off.\"  \"As I understand it, then,\" said Major Grodski, \"the antidote for the ... uh ... chelating agent is magnesium?\"  \"That's right,\" said Dr. Petrelli, nodding. \"The stuff prefers magnesium ions to ferrous ions. They fit better within the chelating ring. Any source of magnesium will do, so long as there's plenty of it. MacNeil was using milk of magnesia, which is the hydroxide, for 'gastric acidity'. It's changed to chloride in the stomach. And he was using Epsom salts--the sulfate, and magnesium citrate as laxatives. He was well protected with magnesium ions.\"  \"We tried it ourselves first, naturally,\" said Dr. Pilar. \"We haven't had any ill effects for two days, so I think we'll be able to make it until the ship comes.\"  Major Grodski sighed. \"Well, if not, I'll at least die with a full stomach.\" He reached for another banana-pear, then looked over at Petrelli. \"Pass the salt, please.\"  Silently and solemnly, the chemist handed him the Epsom salts.

New methods have been evolved and adopted with the progress of science, but no discovery, save perhaps that of gunpowder, has done so much in so short a time to revolutionize the conduct of war as aviation, the youngest, yet destined perhaps to be the most effective fighting-arm. Yet to-day we are only on the threshold of our knowledge, and, striking as was the impetus given to every branch of aeronautics during the four years of war, its future power can only dimly be seen.  We may indeed feel anxious about this great addition of aviation to the destructive power of modern scientific warfare. Bearing its terrors in mind, we may even impotently seek to check its advance, but the appeal of flying is too deep, its elimination is now impossible, and granted that war is inevitable, it must be accepted for good or ill. Fortunately, although with the other great scientific additions, chemical warfare and the submarine, its potentialities for destruction are very great, yet aircraft, unlike the submarine, can be utilized not only in the conduct of war but in the interests of peace, and it is here that we can guide and strengthen it for good. Just as the naval supremacy of Britain was won because commercially we were the greatest seafaring people in the world, so will air supremacy be achieved by that country which, making aviation a part of its everyday life, becomes an airfaring community.  Our nation as a whole has been educated, owing to its geographical situation and by tradition, to interest itself in the broader aspects of marine policy and development. It requires to take the same interest in aviation, a comparatively new subject, unhampered to a great extent by preconceived notions and therefore offering greater scope for individual thought.  The following sketch[1] has been written in the hope that some of those who read it may be inspired to study aviation in one or other of its branches, whether from the historical, technical, strategical, or commercial point of view. Any opinions expressed are, of course, my own and not official.  [1] First written and delivered as the Lees-Knowles Lectures at Cambridge University in February and March, 1921.  I propose first briefly to trace the history of aviation from its beginnings to the outbreak of war; next to describe the evolution of aircraft and of air strategy during the war; and last to estimate the present position and to look into the future.     CHAPTER I  PRE-WAR   EARLY THOUGHTS ON FLIGHT.  The story of the growth of aviation may be likened to that of the discovery and opening up of a new continent. A myth arises, whence no one can tell, of the existence of a new land across the seas. Eventually this land is found without any realization of the importance of the discovery. Then comes the period of colonization and increasing knowledge. But the interior remains unexplored. So, in the case of aviation, man was long convinced, for no scientific reason, that flight was possible. With the first ascent by balloon came the imagined mastery of the air; later, the invention of flight that can be controlled at will. To-day we are still in the stage of colonization. The future resources of the air remain hidden from our view.  The Daedalean myth and the ancient conception of the winged angelic host show how the human mind has long been fascinated by the idea of flight, but the first design of an apparatus to lift man into the air, a parachute-like contrivance, was only reached at the end of the fifteenth century in one of Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts. About the same time lived the first of the long line of daring practical aviators, without whom success would never have been achieved, one John Damian, a physician of the Court of James IV of Scotland, who \"took in hand to fly with wings, and to that effect caused make a pair of wings of feathers, which being fastened upon him, he flew off the castle wall of Stirling, but shortly he fell to the ground and brake his thigh-bone.\"  Nearly 250 years later the aeronaut had not made much progress, for we read of the Marquis de Bacqueville in 1742 attaching to his arms and legs planes of his own design and launching himself from his house in the attempt to fly across the Seine, into which, regrettably, he fell.  Meanwhile the seventeenth-century philosophers had been theorizing. In 1638 John Wilkins, the founder of the Royal Society, published a book entitled _Daedalus, or Mechanical Motions_. A few years later John Glanville wrote in _Scepsis Scientifica_ \"to them that come after us it may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly into remotest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey,\" the sceptic proving a truer prophet than the enthusiast. By 1680 Giovanni Borelli had reached the conclusion, in his book _De Volatu_, that it was impossible that man should ever achieve flight by his own strength. Nor was he more likely to do so in the first aerial ship, designed in 1670 by Francesco Lana, which was to be buoyed up in the air by being suspended from four globes, made of thin copper sheeting, each of them about 25 feet in diameter. From these globes the air was to be exhausted, so that each, being lighter than the atmosphere, would support the weight of two or three men. A hundred years elapsed before Dr. Joseph Black of the University of Edinburgh made the first practical suggestion, that a balloon inflated with hydrogen would rise.   THE INVENTION OF THE BALLOON.  It was in 1783 that Montgolfier conceived the idea of utilizing the lifting power of hot air and invited the Assembly of Vivarais to watch an exhibition of his invention, when a balloon, 10 feet in circumference, rose to a height of 6,000 feet in under ten minutes. This was followed by a demonstration before Louis XVI at Versailles, when a balloon carrying a sheep, a cock, and a duck, rose 1,500 feet and descended safely. And on November 21st of the same year Pilatre de Rozier, accompanied by the Marquis d'Arlande, made the first human ascent, in the \"Reveillon,\" travelling 5 miles over Paris in twenty minutes.  England, it is not surprising to learn, was behind with the invention, but on November 25th, 1783, Count Francesco Zambeccari sent up from Moorfields a small oilskin hydrogen balloon which fell at Petworth; and in August of 1784 James Tytler ascended at Edinburgh in a fire balloon, thus achieving the first ascent in Great Britain. In the same year Lunardi came to London and ballooning became the rage. It was an Englishman, Dr. Jefferies, who accompanied Blanchard in the first cross-Channel flight on January 7th, 1785. Fashionable society soon turned to pursuits other than watching balloon ascents, however, and the joys of the air were confined to a few adventurous spirits, such as Green and Holland, who first substituted coal gas for hydrogen and in 1836 made a voyage of 500 miles from Vauxhall Gardens to Weilburg in Nassau, and James Glaisher, who in the middle of the century began to make meteorological observations from balloons, claiming on one occasion, in 1862, to have reached the great height of 7 miles.   FIRST EXPERIMENTS IN GLIDERS AND AEROPLANES.  The world seemed content to have achieved the balloon, but there were a few men who realized that the air had not been conquered, and who believed that success could only be attained by the scientific study and practice of gliding. Prominent among these, Sir George Cayley, in 1809, published a paper on the Navigation of the Air, and forecasted the modern aeroplane, and the action of the air on wings. In 1848 Henson and Stringfellow, the latter being the inventive genius, designed and produced a small model "]]]
