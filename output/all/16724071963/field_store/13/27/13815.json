As usual on all occasions demanding words, Bill's tongue was loosened:  \"Look here, fellows, we want to give you the right dope on this thing: You see we are here to study--to try and go through if our money holds out. Our people are not rich and, like Tom Edison when he was a boy, we've got to hustle on short allowance. And we really can't afford to be hazed, as you did that new chap yesterday. If we had to buy new clothes and watches and caps, we'd have to quit school--see? And we knew you never missed anybody much, so we naturally, asking your pardon, got up this nice little reception for you. Now to get right down to brass tacks, you see our position and respect it--everyone of you--and, putting yourselves in our position, you don't blame us, nor hold any grudges; isn't that so?\"  Siebold, spokesman, made reply, after thinking a little.  \"Oh, well, I suppose all is fair in war. You've had your innings now, of course, but we'll have ours later.\" And then he added: \"We'll get you.\"  From what Doctor Field said, Bill and Gus knew better. Hazing would be broken up on pain of expulsion, as it should be in all schools where the attendance is for business purposes, the getting of a technical education as a means of livelihood. The boys felt that perhaps in a college art course, where education becomes much play on the part of well-to-do lads, class fracases, bowl fights, initiations and the like may not be amiss, but they did not intend to let open brutality rob them of their chance to study. And, however sure they felt that Siebold's threat was idle, there would be a satisfaction in winning their own fight.  \"Now, that's just what we want to talk to you fellows about,\" Bill declared. \"You don't want to think about 'getting' us. We want you to call this all off and for good; we want you to give your word on it; see?\"  \"No; we can't--\" began Siebold.  \"Won't, eh?\" Bill's words came sharp and clear. \"Well, then, take a little more treatment for your blamed foolishness.\" And Bill touched another button.  The contortions, the writhings, the shrieks and cries that followed quite surpassed the former exhibitions. The well-worn woolen rug that fitted from wall to wall across the end of the room where stood the seven seemed to be charged with red hot needles. Suddenly these ceased to leap and jump and burn; the old rug and the hidden wires under it were again quiescent. But the strident voices of the afflicted prisoners were not silenced, though the late lamentings were given over to a medley of condemnations, appeals and pleadings.  \"Say, go a little slow on this!\"  \"Call it off, confound you!\"  \"Are you trying to electrocute us?\"  \"Say, Brown, please----\"  \"Let's call it quits, fellows!\"  \"We'll call it quits if you want. I suppose we've got to hand it to you two.\" This last from Siebold.  \"Going to call it all off, then? Give us your word! We can't believe that any fellows in Marshallton Tech would go back on their word.\" Bill was smiling genially.  \"That can't be called in question. All off. You're exempt.\" There was a general acquiescence to this. The door slowly and to the seven quite mysteriously swung open; the seven started to file out.  \"Good-by, fellows, and no hard feelings. We were only having a little fun with you as you were going to have with us. You can't----\"  \"Well, but you two have still got to remember,\" said Siebold, shaking his finger at Bill and Gus, \"that you are freshies and must keep in your places. You've got a little the better of us this time, but----\"  \"Golly, Dan,\" spoke up a fellow hazer, \"a _little_ the better? Strikes me we've all been good and licked and these chaps ought to get the credit for----\"  The voice died away along the hall and Bill turned to his chum.  \"We don't want any credit, do we, Gus? But we will get it just the same when this gets out. I sort o' think our little stock has gone up about one thousand percentum, even though we _are_ freshies.\"  This proved quite correct. In a few minutes a lot of freshmen had crowded into the room and there was a sprinkling of sophs also. Questioned eagerly, Bill explained quite freely the purpose of the encounter and its result. Whereupon a big, fat soph declared quite vehemently:  \"Huh! They were easily licked. No pluck. You're lucky to have run into a bunch of quitters.\"  \"You wouldn't have quit, eh, Jumbo?\" ventured another, grinning.  \"Huh! Nothing like this contraption--\" began the husky fellow, advancing and laying his hand on the top cross wire.  \"Not even for a little thing like this?\" queried Bill, reaching the wall button.  \"Ow! Blazes! Quit! Don't! Oh, darn! Stop! Turn--it--off! E-e-e-e-e-! Help!\" And the instant the stabbing current ceased, Fatty fell back from it and glared at Bill.  \"You really can't blame them for quitting, can you?\" asked Bill, and for answer the husky soph turned and fled from the room, followed by the jeering laughter of the crowd.  And that ended it. After Bill had asked the crowd if any or all of them wanted to test the \"convincer,\" as he called the electrical rigging, he bade the onlookers who filled the hallway a pleasant _au revoir_, and Gus again pulled the strings that closed the door.                                     CHAPTER V                              FAME AND FINANCES   Nothing could have taken place to put the lads from Freeport on the pedestal of fame more noticeably than this experiment. They had easily and modestly staged a complete breakdown of the hazing habit at Marshallton Tech. Strangely perhaps there was no blame nor suspicion put upon Bill and Gus for the subsequent edict from the faculty forbidding it. That seemed to be considered a natural aftermath to the news of the electrical reception of the hazers.  The stunt did more than earn the boys a large share of fame. It made them so deservedly popular, even with most of the upper classmen, that they soon counted a good many friends and a considerable number of patrons for radio construction. It is a rather odd fact that methods already mastered by those of their own age appeal to boys more than the teachings of their elders. So, although the students were getting, or had got, the theory of radio activity and the practice of wireless fully stuffed into them, they turned often to Bill and Gus for help. There were a number of the well-to-do, even among the seniors, who wanted radio receivers made, or coaching in making their own, and to this Bill and Gus responded out of school hours, with the consent of the president, thus earning a good many dollars.  So as not to interfere in any way with the school-shop program, and not to crowd those lads who were finding the room in the shop and the tools to their advantage, Bill and Gus rented an unused storeroom in the basement of the dormitory. They cleared it out, sent for their own tools at Freeport, purchased others--a foot-power lathe, a jigsaw and a hand wall-drill--and put up some benches. Besides working therein themselves, they charged also the modest price of twenty-five cents an hour to others mechanically inclined.  The liberal-minded school faculty found no fault with an arrangement which could only mean a more thorough learning and a finer comradeship among the students. The professors, who often visited and even worked in the little shop--some of them paying their quota also--came to refer familiarly to the place as the \"commercial and sales department.\"  Professor Grant, the very able teacher of physics, who possessed far more theoretical knowledge than practice, gave the boys many valuable ideas out of class, and got some himself, being also a deadhead. And Search, the manual-training teacher, who knew the use of tools as a bee knows honey, got a few ideas while imparting many, as he also was made welcome to tinker around the boys' shop.  These were truly strenuous days and weeks for Bill and Gus. They had little studying to do, for Bill grasped problems as a trout takes in minnows, and he needed but to coach Gus briefly. The latter spent only a quarter-hour each day in the gym, never indulging in contests, but content to work hard at the things that best kept him fit. He had elected not to put himself under the instructor, grudging the time. But one day when he went over and, with his bare, work-hardened fists, punched a lively rubber bag for several minutes, Professor LeRoy, who had been watching, came to Gus with almost a demand that he join the boxing class in view of the Marshallton Tech entering contests with other schools during the coming winter. But Gus declined.  \"No; I haven't the speed and I am weak with my left, as you may have noticed. Hurt it once on a lathe in my father's shop; never will be any good for quick work.\"  \"We will overcome that,\" said the instructor, \"develop it.\"  \"Also,\" declared the boy, \"I have neither the time nor the inclination. Must work and nothing much else. But I thank you, Professor.\"  \"Sorry, my boy; you've certainly got a wicked right and you can use the other.\"  \"I'd want to use both,\" asserted Gus, laughing.  As for Bill, the hours each day and all of Saturday spent in the shop sufficed for exercise; the rest was spent in study, brief eating and no more sleep than he needed. And nearly every moment that could be spared found both boys in their shop.  They had under way the construction of five radio receivers of the finer type, for each of which they would get sixty dollars, the materials costing about fifteen dollars. These receivers were equal to more than a thousand miles, with strong, durable batteries and very wide amplification. As with their first radio and the one for their good old friend, Mr. Hooper, they made nearly all the parts themselves, even to the switch arms, contacts, buzzer and binding posts, cutting all threads with a fine set of standard taps and dies.  They also had two crystal sets to make, for which they charged twenty dollars each, and made a profit of seventeen dollars over the cost of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25753"],["title","Radio Boys Loyalty; Or, Bill Brown Listens In (#3)"],["body","rials.  The most interesting was the making of four portable sets, with vacuum tube detectors and loop aërials not over six inches in diameter, each packed in small, neatly made wooden cases about the size of an ordinary paper shoe box, the lids when opened forming the upright panels and the loop aërials hinged to open out and upright. Being rather unique in design, and satisfying fads for unusual construction, the boys felt they should get at least fifty dollars for each of these sets, the materials costing about twelve dollars.  Earning enough in this way to help them along very nicely with their schooling, and being more deeply interested in their work than in anything else, it was not surprising that Bill and Gus found little time for play.  When they had finished one of the larger and two cheaper sets, that upon installation at fraternity and boarding houses were found to work most satisfactorily, the cash was quickly paid over. Bill divided it equally and handed half to Gus.  \"No, you don't, old fellow!\" Gus demurred. \"You get this and you can pay me a sort of wages if you want to, or you needn't. You did all of the planning, the--\" He got no further for Bill started in with this indignant tirade:  \"You're a fatheaded, heterogeneous, quadrangular parallelepipedon! What are you trying to get through your topknot, anyway? Don't we always work together? Isn't it a partnership?\"  \"But--er--Bill----\"  \"'Butter bill'? Sure. This will pay our bread bill, too, and our entire board bill for some time. And what we'll get out of these other sets will see us through all of next year nicely, without worrying. Then something will turn up for the third year. Now, then, will you write to Cotton & Staples for that additional wire, or shall I?\"  \"I will, of course, but this money----\"  \"Oh, shut up! If you say another word about it, I'll lam a battery coil at you--'b'gorry'--as Mr. Hooper says. Well, now, reckon I'd better turn up and thread some more binding posts.\"                                    CHAPTER VI                               ANOTHER FELLOW   It was in and over the work of the boys' shop that Bill and Gus first met the Italian student. Among the upper classmen they had noticed a small, olive-skinned, black-eyed chap, with a rather solemn face, who appeared to be very reticent. It was said that he was a close and a bright student who, though not lacking for money, took little interest in sports, belonging only to the \"bruisers,\" as the boxing class was called. One afternoon, with Gandy, who was getting a radio set made, the stranger appeared and stood in the doorway, gazing at the busy workers. At first neither of the radio experts saw him. Then he advanced.  \"I have the desire very much to make for myself complete a radio getter--ah--what you call? Yes, a receiver.\" He addressed Gus, who was laying out the hook-up for a crystal set.  \"There's nothing very hard about it,\" Gus replied, looking up with his ready smile and scrutinizing the Italian boy.  \"You pay the right here, the privilege; is that not so?\"  \"Yes, we rent the room,\" said Gus.  \"Ah, so; but I mean--\" The newcomer turned partly toward Bill who drew near at the moment and had overheard the question.  \"You mean we charge those who work here? Yes, for the use of our tools and machines, but not for any hints and advice we can give. The school shop is at your mercy, too, without charge, as you know.\"  Bill also sized up his questioner with a certain curiosity and was pleasantly impressed.  \"I do not like the school shop. There are so very many con--con--what you call it? Yes, conflicting. I should like--prefer--choose to come here, if I may do so.\"  \"Come along. You keep account of your own time here, and you can pay us when you like. You can get your own materials, or we can get them for you at the prices we pay. We bought up some old pieces of furniture cheap to cut up for bases and cabinets--enough walnut to make a hundred. No charge for it. Help yourself.\"  \"You are, I wish to say it, veree liber--kind--generous. It is too little that you pay--charge, I mean it. I will ask for your materials and I will commence--begin--start, eh? on to-morrow. Will that be satisfy?\"  \"Any old time. If we are not here, walk in and go to it. Check your hours up on this pad, see? What is your name?\"  \"Anthony Sabaste it is. I am called Tony by most. My country it is Italy, but American I now am. My father is of the city--living there. Here, now, I will pay you five dollars on acc----\"  \"No, you won't,\" said Bill. \"We'd rather have you pay after a while and you can see that the work goes all right. Here, I'll show you the ropes.\"  \"Ropes? But I care not to make--build a ship. It is a radio----\"  \"Oh, sure, I get you; but that's only slang. You have been here long enough, I should guess from your talk, to get on to our American guff. Well, we're glad to know you, Mr.----\"  \"Sabaste, but I best like--I prefer calling me Tony. It means in your language, I get on to it, as fine, grand, fat--no--but swell out--somebody much, eh?\"  \"It does, sure! I'll introduce my partner, Augustus Grier; Gus for short, or he'll get mad. They call me Bill Brown, generally forgetting the Brown, even here at school, where 'most everyone gets his last name. First names are more friendly.\"  \"I like it, too. In my native it is more mostly Signor, even to young--what you call it? Kids, as us, eh?\" Tony smiled genially, his face lighting up most agreeably. \"Some they call me 'Wop,' or 'Sphagetti'.\"  The boys learned that the intelligent young foreigner was in the graduating class which had escaped a lot of practical radio work; that he kept much to himself, either because of a real or fancied notion that social lines might be drawn against him, or because he was naturally unsocial. But after he began the making of a radio set and came in daily contact with Bill and Gus, the young Italian seemed to grow a little out of himself, becoming less reticent and secluded. The good fellowship of two lads a little younger than he, both giving him friendship and confidence, laughing at his errors of speech in perfect good nature and without ridicule, and at their own foibles as well, compelled the Italian boy to like the country of his adoption much better than he had before. This he expressed to Gus:  \"You like me--no, I mean I you like. Yes, that is making to laugh, eh? Funny, very. Well, I mean to say it, you and Bill very much also. Why not? You love the live. You love the study. You make the happiness. You have the great--the large, eh? the big heart. All to you is nice and fine and it is equal to the doing, but you say it, it is worth the while. This makes good-will and kind thoughts to others, also by others--no; from others. You are like one _dolce_ picture in my home. It is by two little birds fabricating their nest and all the time thus they are of song, singing, gay with living and working, helping so much always also to make all the country, this old world happy and satisfy--content. So, to my--to me, you are really it, eh? You are the real thing.\"  \"If Bill had heard you say all this, Tony, he'd declare you're both an orator and a poet,\" said Gus, laughing.  \"And neither am I. But of my country there are many of such, and of learning also, science, the great learning. Many large men of the yesterday and many of the to-day also. In this work, too, the first, for is not Marconi----\"  \"Say that name to Bill and hear him shout some praises.\"  \"So? And will Bill speak good--noble--high of Signor Marconi? Then I, too, can speak noble of Signor Edison, the American. But what say now if I can tell it to you that my father, he is one sure and big friend of Signor Marconi. Our home, in Italia, what you call--the estate of us, it is not much a great distance from Signor Marconi of his estate. Often I have seen him. And so you understand?\"  \"By cracky! Radio must have been in the air over there and you caught it!\" declared Gus. \"Nobody could have it down any more pat than you have. Bill and I have got some dandy ideas from you.\"  \"That we have,\" agreed Bill, thumping in. \"What is it now, Gus, that our friend----\"  \"Why, Bill, Tony knows Marconi! Just telling me about it.\" And Gus went on briefly to repeat that which the Italian had related. Bill, to use a terse but slangy term, proceeded to go up in the air.  \"Why, holy cats, Tony, you are from henceforth the cheese! This school has gone wireless mad,--you know that,--and the country is pretty much in the same fix, and for the reason that radio is about the biggest thing in the world. And, fellows, this just fits. We are doing things--everybody is--in radio and now we are going--this school is going--to honor the situation if we can start it that way. For, fellows, Marconi's yacht, the _Elettra_, is in New York Harbor, with Marconi on board most of the time. And Tony, we'll get Doctor Field to let us have a whack at the transmitter and you can talk to your friend, or telegraph your dad and have him come up and radiophone Marconi. And then we'll listen in for his reply, for I've read he's awfully fine and good-natured. Isn't that so?\"  \"It is so, sure and indeed!\" declared the Italian youth. \"I am overenjoyed; you say so, eh? that we shall do this. Let us now go, upon this moment, and talk to the good doctor. There will be no lecturing at this time over the casting abroad----\"  \"The broadcasting transmitter? No, we can surely get a whack at it.\"                                    CHAPTER VII                                  MESSAGES   Doctor Field, much interested, accompanied the boys to the school broadcasting room, and after determining from some data at hand the wave lengths that would be receivable on the Marconi yacht, Tony began talking earnestly, almost too rapidly, into the horn, the crack and buzzing of the battery charges making a sound like that of a rifle gallery. The president, Bill and Gus also had receiving 'phones clamped to their ears. "]]]
