She lay on her back, rolling about, and stretching out her legs and head and tail in the bright sunshine; and the cubs jumped over her, and ran round her, and nibbled her paws, and lugged her about by the tail; and she seemed to enjoy it mightily. But one selfish little fellow stole away from the rest to a dead crow close by, and dragged it off to hide it, though it was nearly as big as he was. Whereat all his little brothers set off after him in full cry, and saw Tom; and then all ran back, and up jumped Mrs. Vixen, and caught one up in her mouth, and the rest toddled after her, and into a dark crack in the rocks; and there was an end of the show.  And next he had a fright; for, as he scrambled up a sandy brow--whirr-poof-poof-cock-cock-kick--something went off in his face, with a most horrid noise. He thought the ground had blown up, and the end of the world come.  And when he opened his eyes (for he shut them very tight) it was only an old cock-grouse, who had been washing himself in sand, like an Arab, for want of water; and who, when Tom had all but trodden on him, jumped up with a noise like the express train, leaving his wife and children to shift for themselves, like an old coward, and went off, screaming \"Cur-ru-u-uck, cur-ru-u-uck--murder, thieves, fire--cur-u-uck-cock-kick--the end of the world is come--kick-kick-cock-kick.\" He was always fancying that the end of the world was come, when anything happened which was farther off than the end of his own nose. But the end of the world was not come, any more than the twelfth of August was; though the old grouse-cock was quite certain of it.  So the old grouse came back to his wife and family an hour afterwards, and said solemnly, \"Cock-cock-kick; my dears, the end of the world is not quite come; but I assure you it is coming the day after to-morrow--cock.\" But his wife had heard that so often that she knew all about it, and a little more. And, besides, she was the mother of a family, and had seven little poults to wash and feed every day; and that made her very practical, and a little sharp-tempered; so all she answered was: \"Kick-kick-kick--go and catch spiders, go and catch spiders--kick.\"  So Tom went on and on, he hardly knew why; but he liked the great wide strange place, and the cool fresh bracing air. But he went more and more slowly as he got higher up the hill; for now the ground grew very bad indeed. Instead of soft turf and springy heather, he met great patches of flat limestone rock, just like ill-made pavements, with deep cracks between the stones and ledges, filled with ferns; so he had to hop from stone to stone, and now and then he slipped in between, and hurt his little bare toes, though they were tolerably tough ones; but still he would go on and up, he could not tell why.  What would Tom have said if he had seen, walking over the moor behind him, the very same Irishwoman who had taken his part upon the road? But whether it was that he looked too little behind him, or whether it was that she kept out of sight behind the rocks and knolls, he never saw her, though she saw him.  And now he began to get a little hungry, and very thirsty; for he had run a long way, and the sun had risen high in heaven, and the rock was as hot as an oven, and the air danced reels over it, as it does over a limekiln, till everything round seemed quivering and melting in the glare.  But he could see nothing to eat anywhere, and still less to drink.  The heath was full of bilberries and whimberries; but they were only in flower yet, for it was June. And as for water, who can find that on the top of a limestone rock? Now and then he passed by a deep dark swallow-hole, going down into the earth, as if it was the chimney of some dwarf's house underground; and more than once, as he passed, he could hear water falling, trickling, tinkling, many many feet below. How he longed to get down to it, and cool his poor baked lips! But, brave little chimney-sweep as he was, he dared not climb down such chimneys as those.  So he went on and on, till his head spun round with the heat, and he thought he heard church-bells ringing, a long way off.  \"Ah!\" he thought, \"where there is a church there will be houses and people; and, perhaps, some one will give me a bit and a sup.\" So he set off again, to look for the church; for he was sure that he heard the bells quite plain.  And in a minute more, when he looked round, he stopped again, and said, \"Why, what a big place the world is!\"  And so it was; for, from the top of the mountain he could see--what could he not see?  Behind him, far below, was Harthover, and the dark woods, and the shining salmon river; and on his left, far below, was the town, and the smoking chimneys of the collieries; and far, far away, the river widened to the shining sea; and little white specks, which were ships, lay on its bosom. Before him lay, spread out like a map, great plains, and farms, and villages, amid dark knots of trees. They all seemed at his very feet; but he had sense to see that they were long miles away.  And to his right rose moor after moor, hill after hill, till they faded away, blue into blue sky. But between him and those moors, and really at his very feet, lay something, to which, as soon as Tom saw it, he determined to go, for that was the place for him.  A deep, deep green and rocky valley, very narrow, and filled with wood; but through the wood, hundreds of feet below him, he could see a clear stream glance. Oh, if he could but get down to that stream! Then, by the stream, he saw the roof of a little cottage, and a little garden set out in squares and beds. And there was a tiny little red thing moving in the garden, no bigger than a fly. As Tom looked down, he saw that it was a woman in a red petticoat. Ah! perhaps she would give him something to eat. And there were the church-bells ringing again. Surely there must be a village down there. Well, nobody would know him, or what had happened at the Place. The news could not have got there yet, even if Sir John had set all the policemen in the county after him; and he could get down there in five minutes.  Tom was quite right about the hue-and-cry not having got thither; for he had come without knowing it, the best part of ten miles from Harthover; but he was wrong about getting down in five minutes, for the cottage was more than a mile off, and a good thousand feet below.  [Illustration: \"Play by me, bathe in me, mother and child.\"--_P. 32._]  However, down he went, like a brave little man as he was, though he was very footsore, and tired, and hungry, and thirsty; while the church-bells rang so loud, he began to think that they must be inside his own head, and the river chimed and tinkled far below; and this was the song which it sang:--                _Clear and cool, clear and cool,             By laughing shallow, and dreaming pool;               Cool and clear, cool and clear,             By shining shingle, and foaming wear;           Under the crag where the ouzel sings,           And the ivied wall where the church-bell rings,                 Undefiled, for the undefiled;               Play by me, bathe in me, mother and child._                _Dank and foul, dank and foul,             By the smoky town in its murky cowl;               Foul and dank, foul and dank,             By wharf and sewer and slimy bank;           Darker and darker the farther I go,           Baser and baser the richer I grow;                 Who dare sport with the sin-defiled?               Shrink from me, turn from me, mother and child._                _Strong and free, strong and free,             The floodgates are open, away to the sea,               Free and strong, free and strong,             Cleansing my streams as I hurry along,           To the golden sands, and the leaping bar,           And the taintless tide that awaits me afar.           As I lose myself in the infinite main,           Like a soul that has sinned and is pardoned again.                 Undefiled, for the undefiled;               Play by me, bathe in me, mother and child._  So Tom went down; and all the while he never saw the Irishwoman going down behind him.            \"And is there care in heaven? and is there love            In heavenly spirits to these creatures base            That may compassion of their evils move?            There is:--else much more wretched were the case            Of men than beasts: But oh! the exceeding grace            Of Highest God that loves His creatures so,            And all His works with mercy doth embrace,            That blessed Angels He sends to and fro,            To serve to wicked man, to serve His wicked foe!\"                                               SPENSER.      CHAPTER II   [Illustration: \"A quiet, silent, rich, happy place.\"--_P. 35._]  A MILE off, and a thousand feet down.  So Tom found it; though it seemed as if he could have chucked a pebble on to the back of the woman in the red petticoat who was weeding in the garden, or even across the dale to the rocks beyond. For the bottom of the valley was just one field broad, and on the other side ran the stream; and above it, grey crag, grey down, grey stair, grey moor walled up to heaven.  A quiet, silent, rich, happy place; a narrow crack cut deep into the earth; so deep, and so out of the way, that the bad bogies can hardly find it out. The name of the place is Vendale; and if you want to see it for yourself, you must go up into the High Craven, and search from Bolland Forest north by Ingleborough, to the Nine Standards and Cross Fell; and if you have not found it, you must turn south, and search the Lake Mountains, down to Scaw Fell and the sea; and then, if you have not found it, you must go northward again by merry Carlisle, and search the Cheviots all across, from Annan Water to Berwick Law; and then, whether you have found Vendale or not, you will have found such a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25564"],["title","The Water-Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land-Baby (#5)"],["body","ntry, and such a people, as ought to make you proud of being a British boy.  So Tom went to go down; and first he went down three hundred feet of steep heather, mixed up with loose brown gritstone, as rough as a file; which was not pleasant to his poor little heels, as he came bump, stump, jump, down the steep. And still he thought he could throw a stone into the garden.  Then he went down three hundred feet of limestone terraces, one below the other, as straight as if a carpenter had ruled them with his ruler and then cut them out with his chisel. There was no heath there, but--  First, a little grass slope, covered with the prettiest flowers, rockrose and saxifrage, and thyme and basil, and all sorts of sweet herbs.  Then bump down a two-foot step of limestone.  Then another bit of grass and flowers.  Then bump down a one-foot step.  Then another bit of grass and flowers for fifty yards, as steep as the house-roof, where he had to slide down on his dear little tail.  Then another step of stone, ten feet high; and there he had to stop himself, and crawl along the edge to find a crack; for if he had rolled over, he would have rolled right into the old woman's garden, and frightened her out of her wits.  Then, when he had found a dark narrow crack, full of green-stalked fern, such as hangs in the basket in the drawing-room, and had crawled down through it, with knees and elbows, as he would down a chimney, there was another grass slope, and another step, and so on, till--oh, dear me! I wish it was all over; and so did he. And yet he thought he could throw a stone into the old woman's garden.  At last he came to a bank of beautiful shrubs; white-beam with its great silver-backed leaves, and mountain-ash, and oak; and below them cliff and crag, cliff and crag, with great beds of crown-ferns and wood-sedge; while through the shrubs he could see the stream sparkling, and hear it murmur on the white pebbles. He did not know that it was three hundred feet below.  You would have been giddy, perhaps, at looking down: but Tom was not. He was a brave little chimney-sweep; and when he found himself on the top of a high cliff, instead of sitting down and crying for his baba (though he never had had any baba to cry for), he said, \"Ah, this will just suit me!\" though he was very tired; and down he went, by stock and stone, sedge and ledge, bush and rush, as if he had been born a jolly little black ape, with four hands instead of two.  And all the while he never saw the Irishwoman coming down behind him.  But he was getting terribly tired now. The burning sun on the fells had sucked him up; but the damp heat of the woody crag sucked him up still more; and the perspiration ran out of the ends of his fingers and toes, and washed him cleaner than he had been for a whole year. But, of course, he dirtied everything terribly as he went. There has been a great black smudge all down the crag ever since. And there have been more black beetles in Vendale since than ever were known before; all, of course, owing to Tom's having blacked the original papa of them all, just as he was setting off to be married, with a sky-blue coat and scarlet leggings, as smart as a gardener's dog with a polyanthus in his mouth.  At last he got to the bottom. But, behold, it was not the bottom--as people usually find when they are coming down a mountain. For at the foot of the crag were heaps and heaps of fallen limestone of every size from that of your head to that of a stage-waggon, with holes between them full of sweet heath-fern; and before Tom got through them, he was out in the bright sunshine again; and then he felt, once for all and suddenly, as people generally do, that he was b-e-a-t, beat.  You must expect to be beat a few times in your life, little man, if you live such a life as a man ought to live, let you be as strong and healthy as you may: and when you are, you will find it a very ugly feeling. I hope that that day you may have a stout staunch friend by you who is not beat; for, if you have not, you had best lie where you are, and wait for better times, as poor Tom did.  He could not get on. The sun was burning, and yet he felt chill all over. He was quite empty, and yet he felt quite sick. There was but two hundred yards of smooth pasture between him and the cottage, and yet he could not walk down it. He could hear the stream murmuring only one field beyond it, and yet it seemed to him as if it was a hundred miles off.  He lay down on the grass till the beetles ran over him, and the flies settled on his nose. I don't know when he would have got up again, if the gnats and the midges had not taken compassion on him. But the gnats blew their trumpets so loud in his ear, and the midges nibbled so at his hands and face wherever they could find a place free from soot, that at last he woke up, and stumbled away, down over a low wall, and into a narrow road, and up to the cottage door.  And a neat pretty cottage it was, with clipped yew hedges all round the garden, and yews inside too, cut into peacocks and trumpets and teapots and all kinds of queer shapes. And out of the open door came a noise like that of the frogs on the Great-A, when they know that it is going to be scorching hot to-morrow--and how they know that I don't know, and you don't know, and nobody knows.  He came slowly up to the open door, which was all hung round with clematis and roses; and then peeped in, half afraid.  And there sat by the empty fireplace, which was filled with a pot of sweet herbs, the nicest old woman that ever was seen, in her red petticoat, and short dimity bedgown, and clean white cap, with a black silk handkerchief over it, tied under her chin. At her feet sat the grandfather of all the cats; and opposite her sat, on two benches, twelve or fourteen neat, rosy, chubby little children, learning their Chris-cross-row; and gabble enough they made about it.  Such a pleasant cottage it was, with a shiny clean stone floor, and curious old prints on the walls, and an old black oak sideboard full of bright pewter and brass dishes, and a cuckoo clock in the corner, which began shouting as soon as Tom appeared: not that it was frightened at Tom, but that it was just eleven o'clock.  All the children started at Tom's dirty black figure,--the girls began to cry, and the boys began to laugh, and all pointed at him rudely enough; but Tom was too tired to care for that.  \"What art thou, and what dost want?\" cried the old dame. \"A chimney-sweep! Away with thee! I'll have no sweeps here.\"  \"Water,\" said poor little Tom, quite faint.  \"Water? There's plenty i' the beck,\" she said, quite sharply.  \"But I can't get there; I'm most clemmed with hunger and drought.\" And Tom sank down upon the door-step, and laid his head against the post.  And the old dame looked at him through her spectacles one minute, and two, and three; and then she said, \"He's sick; and a bairn's a bairn, sweep or none.\"  \"Water,\" said Tom.  \"God forgive me!\" and she put by her spectacles, and rose, and came to Tom. \"Water's bad for thee; I'll give thee milk.\" And she toddled off into the next room, and brought a cup of milk and a bit of bread.  Tom drank the milk off at one draught, and then looked up, revived.  \"Where didst come from?\" said the dame.  \"Over Fell, there,\" said Tom, and pointed up into the sky.  \"Over Harthover? and down Lewthwaite Crag? Art sure thou art not lying?\"  \"Why should I?\" said Tom, and leant his head against the post.  \"And how got ye up there?\"  \"I came over from the Place\"; and Tom was so tired and desperate he had no heart or time to think of a story, so he told all the truth in a few words.  \"Bless thy little heart! And thou hast not been stealing, then?\"  \"No.\"  \"Bless thy little heart! and I'll warrant not. Why, God's guided the bairn, because he was innocent! Away from the Place, and over Harthover Fell, and down Lewthwaite Crag! Who ever heard the like, if God hadn't led him? Why dost not eat thy bread?\"  \"I can't.\"  \"It's good enough, for I made it myself.\"  \"I can't,\" said Tom, and he laid his head on his knees, and then asked--  \"Is it Sunday?\"  \"No, then; why should it be?\"  \"Because I hear the church-bells ringing so.\"  \"Bless thy pretty heart! The bairn's sick. Come wi' me, and I'll hap thee up somewhere. If thou wert a bit cleaner I'd put thee in my own bed, for the Lord's sake. But come along here.\"  But when Tom tried to get up, he was so tired and giddy that she had to help him and lead him.  She put him in an outhouse upon soft sweet hay and an old rug, and bade him sleep off his walk, and she would come to him when school was over, in an hour's time.  And so she went in again, expecting Tom to fall fast asleep at once.  But Tom did not fall asleep.  Instead of it he turned and tossed and kicked about in the strangest way, and felt so hot all over that he longed to get into the river and cool himself; and then he fell half asleep, and dreamt that he heard the little white lady crying to him, \"Oh, you're so dirty; go and be washed\"; and then that he heard the Irishwoman saying, \"Those that wish to be clean, clean they will be.\" And then he heard the church-bells ring so loud, close to him too, that he was sure it must be Sunday, in spite of what the old dame had said; and he would go to church, and see what a church was like inside, for he had never been in one, poor little fellow, in all his life. But the people would never let him come in, all over soot and dirt like that. He must go to the river and wash first. And he said out loud again and again, though being half asleep he did not know it, \"I must be clean, I must be clean.\"  And all of a sudden he found himself, not in the outhouse on the hay, but in the middle of a meadow, over the road, with the stream just before him, saying continually, \"I must be clean, I must be clean.\" He had got there on his own legs, between sleep and awake, as children will often get out of bed, and go about the room, when"]]]
