Why is it better to breathe through the nose                than through the mouth?            12. Why is alcohol not good for the lungs?     CHAPTER XVI.  THE SKIN.   [Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste matter all the time--it is the skin.  The body is covered with skin. It is also lined with a more delicate kind of skin. You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin meet at your lips.  There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so. Because under the outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it will feel the least touch as pain. When the outer skin, which protects it, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm.  In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the face, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of water. We call these drops perspiration (pẽr spĭ rā´shŭn).  [Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._]  Where does it come from? It comes through many tiny holes in the skin, called pores (pōrz). Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is carrying off waste matter and water from your body. If you could piece together all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one person, they would make a line more than three miles long.  Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough of it to form drops. But it is always coming out through your skin, both in winter and summer. Your body is kept healthy by having its worn-out matter carried off in this way, as well as in other ways.   THE NAILS.  The nails grow from the skin.  The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers from getting hurt. These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would be badly off without such shields. No one likes to see nails that have been bitten.   CARE OF THE SKIN.  Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes in the skin. This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little openings of the tubes. It should be washed off with soap and water.  When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty hands and faces. Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed. But even if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched any thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter that comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or dust of the street. You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out very little at a time. Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and healthy, and able to do its work. If the skin could not do its work, you would die.  Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time. Rubber will not let the perspiration pass off, so the little pores get clogged and your feet begin to feel uncomfortable, or your head may ache. No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the rest of the body. But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when the ground is wet. Certainly, they are very useful then.  When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a little shutting up. But as soon as you come into the house, take the rubbers off.  Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration. When these clothes are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will air well before morning. Never wear any of the clothes through the night, that you have worn during the day.  Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your pillow. Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where the air can reach it all day. By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep at night.  You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before leaving your rooms in the morning. In this way, the bed and bed-clothes may have a good airing. Be sure to give them time enough for this.   WORK OF THE BODY.  You have now learned about four important kinds of work:--  1st. The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take.  2d. The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of the body, and to take away worn-out matter.  3d. The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and pure again.  4th. The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration tubes.  All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.

Of what use are the nails?             8. How should they be kept?             9. What care should be taken of the skin?            10. Why should you not wear rubber boots or                overshoes in the house?            11. Why should you change under-clothing night and                morning?            12. Where should the night-dress be placed in the                morning?            13. What should be done with the bed-clothes? Why?            14. Name the four kinds of work about which you                have learned.            15. How are the organs of the body kept at work?     CHAPTER XVII.  THE SENSES.   [Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around us. We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them. Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.  You already know something about them, for you are using them all the time.  In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.   THE EYES.  In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil. This pupil is only a hole with a muscle around it. When you are in the light, the muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all the light you need through a small opening. When you are in the dark, the muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.  The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large in the dark. They want all the light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.  [Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]  The pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of sight is. This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not bear too much light. It carries to the brain an account of every thing we see.  We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that the nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.   CARE OF THE EYES.  The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.  Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying. While writing, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side; then the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.  One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good care of your eyes.  The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light. It asks to have the pupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light is too strong.  Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: \"Let us see which of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time.\"  Then they foolishly began to look at the sun. The delicate nerves of sight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as possible and the eyelid curtains put down.  But the foolish boys said \"No.\" They were trying to see which would bear it the longest. Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of both these boys. The one who looked longest at the sun died in consequence of his foolish act.  The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to imitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed. He turned them; but he could not turn them back again. Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty years old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors have never been able to set them quite right.  You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your eyes too much light. But you must also be sure to give them light enough.  When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says: \"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark.\"  If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in place of them, and you would never be able to see again.   THE EARS.  What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to catch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears. These are deeper in the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account of each sound to the brain.   CARE OF THE EARS.  The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye. Careless children sometimes put pins into their ears and so break the \"drum.\" That is a very bad thing to do. Use only a soft towel in washing your ears. You should never put any thing hard or sharp into them.  I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small boy.  One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the door, to feel the wind blow into it. He was so young that he did not know it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely. Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache. He thought it began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that door.   ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.

CHAPTER I: OF THOSE THREE WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE RAVEN   It has been told that there was once a young man of free kindred and whose name was Hallblithe: he was fair, strong, and not untried in battle; he was of the House of the Raven of old time.  This man loved an exceeding fair damsel called the Hostage, who was of the House of the Rose, wherein it was right and due that the men of the Raven should wed.  She loved him no less, and no man of the kindred gainsaid their love, and they were to be wedded on Midsummer Night.  But one day of early spring, when the days were yet short and the nights long, Hallblithe sat before the porch of the house smoothing an ash stave for his spear, and he heard the sound of horse-hoofs drawing nigh, and he looked up and saw folk riding toward the house, and so presently they rode through the garth gate; and there was no man but he about the house, so he rose up and went to meet them, and he saw that they were but three in company: they had weapons with them, and their horses were of the best; but they were no fellowship for a man to be afraid of; for two of them were old and feeble, and the third was dark and sad, and drooping of aspect: it seemed as if they had ridden far and fast, for their spurs were bloody and their horses all a-sweat.  Hallblithe hailed them kindly and said: \"Ye are way-worn, and maybe ye have to ride further; so light down and come into the house, and take bite and sup, and hay and corn also for your horses; and then if ye needs must ride on your way, depart when ye are rested; or else if ye may, then abide here night-long, and go your ways to-morrow, and meantime that which is ours shall be yours, and all shall be free to you.\"  Then spake the oldest of the elders in a high piping voice and said: \"Young man, we thank thee; but though the days of the springtide are waxing, the hours of our lives are waning; nor may we abide unless thou canst truly tell us that this is the Land of the Glittering Plain: and if that be so, then delay not, lead us to thy lord, and perhaps he will make us content.\"  Spake he who was somewhat less stricken in years than the first: \"Thanks have thou! but we need something more than meat and drink, to wit the Land of Living Men.  And Oh! but the time presses.\"  Spake the sad and sorry carle: \"We seek the Land where the days are many: so many that he who hath forgotten how to laugh, may learn the craft again, and forget the days of Sorrow.\"  Then they all three cried aloud and said:  \"Is this the Land?  Is this the Land?\"  But Hallblithe wondered, and he laughed and said: \"Wayfarers, look under the sun down the plain which lieth betwixt the mountains and the sea, and ye shall behold the meadows all gleaming with the spring lilies; yet do we not call this the Glittering Plain, but Cleveland by the Sea.  Here men die when their hour comes, nor know I if the days of their life be long enough for the forgetting of sorrow; for I am young and not yet a yokefellow of sorrow; but this I know, that they are long enough for the doing of deeds that shall not die.  And as for Lord, I know not this word, for here dwell we, the sons of the Raven, in good fellowship, with our wives that we have wedded, and our mothers who have borne us, and our sisters who serve us.  Again I bid you light down off your horses, and eat and drink, and be merry; and depart when ye will, to seek what land ye will.\"  They scarce looked on him, but cried out together mournfully:  \"This is not the Land!  This is not the Land!\"  No more than that they said, but turned about their horses and rode out through the garth gate, and went clattering up the road that led to the pass of the mountains.  But Hallblithe hearkened wondering, till the sound of their horse-hoofs died away, and then turned back to his work: and it was then two hours after high-noon.     CHAPTER II: EVIL TIDINGS COME TO HAND AT CLEVELAND   Not long had he worked ere he heard the sound of horsehoofs once more, and he looked not up, but said to himself, \"It is but the lads bringing back the teams from the acres, and riding fast and driving hard for joy of heart and in wantonness of youth.\"  But the sound grew nearer and he looked up and saw over the turf wall of the garth the flutter of white raiment; and he said:  \"Nay, it is the maidens coming back from the sea-shore and the gathering of wrack.\"  So he set himself the harder to his work, and laughed, all alone as he was, and said: \"She is with them: now I will not look up again till they have ridden into the garth, and she has come from among them, and leapt off her horse, and cast her arms about my neck as her wont is; and it will rejoice her then to mock me with hard words and kind voice and longing heart; and I shall long for her and kiss her, and sweet shall the coming days seem to us: and the daughters of our folk shall look on and be kind and blithe with us.\"  Therewith rode the maidens into the garth, but he heard no sound of laughter or merriment amongst them, which was contrary to their wont; and his heart fell, and it was as if instead of the maidens' laughter the voices of those wayfarers came back upon the wind crying out, \"Is this the Land?  Is this the Land?\"  Then he looked up hastily, and saw the maidens drawing near, ten of the House of the Raven, and three of the House of the Rose; and he beheld them that their faces were pale and woe-begone, and their raiment rent, and there was no joy in them.  Hallblithe stood aghast while one who had gotten off her horse (and she was the daughter of his own mother) ran past him into the hall, looking not at him, as if she durst not: and another rode off swiftly to the horse-stalls.  But the others, leaving their horses, drew round about him, and for a while none durst utter a word; and he stood gazing at them, with the spoke-shave in his hand, he also silent; for he saw that the Hostage was not with them, and he knew that now he was the yokefellow of sorrow.  At last he spoke gently and in a kind voice, and said: \"Tell me, sisters, what evil hath befallen us, even if it be the death of a dear friend, and the thing that may not be amended.\"  Then spoke a fair woman of the Rose, whose name was Brightling, and said: \"Hallblithe, it is not of death that we have to tell, but of sundering, which may yet be amended.  We were on the sand of the sea nigh the Ship- stead and the Rollers of the Raven, and we were gathering the wrack and playing together; and we saw a round-ship nigh to shore lying with her sheet slack, and her sail beating the mast; but we deemed it to be none other than some bark of the Fish-biters, and thought no harm thereof, but went on running and playing amidst the little waves that fell on the sand, and the ripples that curled around our feet.  At last there came a small boat from the side of the round-ship, and rowed in toward shore, and still we feared not, though we drew a little aback from the surf and let fall our gown-hems.  But the crew of that boat beached her close to where we stood, and came hastily wading the surf towards us; and we saw that they were twelve weaponed men, great, and grim, and all clad in black raiment.  Then indeed were we afraid, and we turned about and fled up the beach; but now it was too late, for the tide was at more than half ebb and long was the way over the sand to the place where we had left our horses tied among the tamarisk-bushes.  Nevertheless we ran, and had gotten up to the pebble-beach before they ran in amongst us: and they caught us, and cast us down on to the hard stones.  \"Then they made us sit in a row on a ridge of the pebbles; and we were sore afraid, yet more for defilement at their hands than for death; for they were evil-looking men exceeding foul of favour.  Then said one of them: 'Which of all you maidens is the Hostage of the House of the Rose?'  \"Then all we kept silence, for we would not betray her.  But the evil man spake again: 'Choose ye then whether we shall take one, or all of you across the waters in our black ship.'  Yet still we others spake not, till arose thy beloved, O Hallblithe, and said:  \"'Let it be one then, and not all; for I am the Hostage.'  \"'How shalt thou make us sure thereof?' said the evil carle.  \"She looked on him proudly and said: 'Because I say it.'  \"'Wilt thou swear it?' said he.  \"'Yea,' said she, 'I swear it by the token of the House wherein I shall wed; by the wings of the Fowl that seeketh the Field of Slaying.'  \"'It is enough,' said the man, 'come thou with us.  And ye maidens sit ye there, and move not till we have made way on our ship, unless ye would feel the point of the arrow.  For ye are within bowshot of the ship, and we have shot weapons aboard.'  \"So the Hostage departed with them, and she unweeping, but we wept sorely.  And we saw the small boat come up to the side of the round-ship, and the Hostage going over the gunwale along with those evil men, and we heard the "]]]
