The scenes shift constantly and by watching them, Ozma, the girl Ruler, is able to discover events taking place in any part of her kingdom.  One day she saw in her Magic Picture that a little girl and a little boy had wandered together into a great, gloomy forest at the far west of Oz and had become hopelessly lost. Their friends were seeking them in the wrong direction and unless Ozma came to their rescue the little ones would never be found in time to save them from starving.  So the Princess sent a message to Jack Pumpkinhead and asked him to come to the palace. This personage, one of the queerest of the queer inhabitants of Oz, was an old friend and companion of Ozma. His form was made of rough sticks fitted together and dressed in ordinary clothes. His head was a pumpkin with a face carved upon it, and was set on top a sharp stake which formed his neck.  Jack was active, good-natured and a general favorite; but his pumpkin head was likely to spoil with age, so in order to secure a good supply of heads he grew a big field of pumpkins and lived in the middle of it, his house being a huge pumpkin hollowed out. Whenever he needed a new head he picked a pumpkin, carved a face on it and stuck it upon the stake of his neck, throwing away the old head as of no further use.  The day Ozma sent for him Jack was in prime condition and was glad to be of service in rescuing the lost children. Ozma made him a map, showing just where the forest was and how to get to it and the paths he must take to reach the little ones. Then she said:  [Illustration]  \"You'd better ride the Sawhorse, for he is swift and intelligent and will help you accomplish your task.\"  \"All right,\" answered Jack, and went to the royal stable to tell the Sawhorse to be ready for the trip.  This remarkable animal was not unlike Jack Pumpkinhead in form, although so different in shape. Its body was a log, with four sticks stuck into it for legs. A branch at one end of the log served as a tail, while in the other end was chopped a gash that formed a mouth. Above this were two small knots that did nicely for eyes. The Sawhorse was the favorite steed of Ozma and to prevent its wooden legs from wearing out she had them shod with plates of gold.  Jack said \"Good morning\" to the Sawhorse and placed upon the creature's back a saddle of purple leather, studded with jewels.  \"Where now?\" asked the horse, blinking its knot eyes at Jack.  \"We're going to rescue two babes in the wood,\" was the reply. Then he climbed into the saddle and the wooden animal pranced out of the stable, through the streets of the Emerald City and out upon the highway leading to the western forest where the children were lost.  Small though he was, the Sawhorse was swift and untiring. By nightfall they were in the far west and quite close to the forest they sought. They passed the night standing quietly by the roadside. They needed no food, for their wooden bodies never became hungry; nor did they sleep, because they never tired. At daybreak they continued their journey and soon reached the forest.  Jack now examined the map Ozma had given him and found the right path to take, which the Sawhorse obediently followed. Underneath the trees all was silent and gloomy and Jack beguiled the way by whistling gayly as the Sawhorse trotted along.  [Illustration]  The paths branched so many times and in so many different ways that the Pumpkinhead was often obliged to consult Ozma's map, and finally the Sawhorse became suspicious.  \"Are you sure you are right?\" it asked.  \"Of course,\" answered Jack. \"Even a Pumpkinhead whose brains are seeds can follow so clear a map as this. Every path is plainly marked, and here is a cross where the children are.\"  Finally they reached a place, in the very heart of the forest, where they came upon the lost boy and girl. But they found the two children bound fast to the trunk of a big tree, at the foot of which they were sitting.  When the rescuers arrived, the little girl was sobbing bitterly and the boy was trying to comfort her, though he was probably frightened as much as she.  \"Cheer up, my dears,\" said Jack, getting out of the saddle. \"I have come to take you back to your parents. But why are you bound to that tree?\"  \"Because,\" cried a small, sharp voice, \"they are thieves and robbers. That's why!\"  \"Dear me!\" said Jack, looking around to see who had spoken. The voice seemed to come from above.  A big grey squirrel was sitting upon a low branch of the tree. Upon the squirrel's head was a circle of gold, with a diamond set in the center of it. He was running up and down the limbs and chattering excitedly.  [Illustration]  \"These children,\" continued the squirrel, angrily, \"robbed our storehouse of all the nuts we had saved up for winter. Therefore, being King of all the Squirrels in this forest, I ordered them arrested and put in prison, as you now see them. They had no right to steal our provisions and we are going to punish them.\"  \"We were hungry,\" said the boy, pleadingly, \"and we found a hollow tree full of nuts, and ate them to keep alive. We didn't want to starve when there was food right in front of us.\"  \"Quite right,\" remarked Jack, nodding his pumpkin head. \"I don't blame you one bit, under the circumstances. Not a bit.\"  Then he began to untie the ropes that bound the children to the tree.  \"Stop that!\" cried the King Squirrel, chattering and whisking about. \"You mustn't release our prisoners. You have no right to.\"  But Jack paid no attention to the protest. His wooden fingers were awkward and it took him some time to untie the ropes. When at last he succeeded, the tree was full of squirrels, called together by their King, and they were furious at losing their prisoners. From the tree they began to hurl nuts at the Pumpkinhead, who laughed at them as he helped the two children to their feet.  [Illustration]  Now, at the top of this tree was a big dead limb, and so many squirrels gathered upon it that suddenly it broke away and fell to the ground. Poor Jack was standing directly under it and when the limb struck him it smashed his pumpkin head into a pulpy mass and sent Jack's wooden form tumbling, to stop with a bump against a tree a dozen feet away.  He sat up, a moment afterward, but when he felt for his head it was gone. He could not see; neither could he speak. It was perhaps the greatest misfortune that could have happened to Jack Pumpkinhead, and the squirrels were delighted. They danced around in the tree in great glee as they saw Jack's plight.  [Illustration]  The boy and girl were indeed free, but their protector was ruined. The Sawhorse was there, however, and in his way he was wise. He had seen the accident and knew that the smashed pumpkin would never again serve Jack as a head. So he said to the children, who were frightened at this accident to their new found friend:  \"Pick up the Pumpkinhead's body and set it on my saddle. Then mount behind it and hold on. We must get out of this forest as soon as we can, or the squirrels may capture you again. I must guess at the right path, for Jack's map is no longer of any use to him since that limb destroyed his head.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  The two children lifted Jack's body, which was not at all heavy, and placed it upon the saddle. Then they climbed up behind it and the Sawhorse immediately turned and trotted back along the path he had come, bearing all three with ease. However, when the path began to branch into many paths, all following different directions, the wooden animal became puzzled and soon was wandering aimlessly about, without any hope of finding the right way. Toward evening they came upon a fine fruit tree, which furnished the children a supper, and at night the little ones lay upon a bed of leaves while the Sawhorse stood watch, with the limp, headless form of poor Jack Pumpkinhead lying helpless across the saddle.  Now, Ozma had seen in her Magic Picture all that had happened in the forest, so she sent the little Wizard, mounted upon the Cowardly Lion, to save the unfortunates. The Lion knew the forest well and when he reached it he bounded straight through the tangled paths to where the Sawhorse was wandering, with Jack and the two children on his back.  The Wizard was grieved at the sight of the headless Jack, but believed he could save him. He first led the Sawhorse out of the forest and restored the boy and girl to the arms of their anxious friends, and then he sent the Lion back to Ozma to tell her what had happened.  [Illustration]  The Wizard now mounted the Sawhorse and supported Jack's form on the long ride to the pumpkin field. When they arrived at Jack's house the Wizard selected a fine pumpkin--not too ripe--and very neatly carved a face on it. Then he stuck the pumpkin solidly on Jack's neck and asked him:  \"Well, old friend, how do you feel?\"  \"Fine!\" replied Jack, and shook the hand of the little Wizard gratefully. \"You have really saved my life, for without your assistance I could not have found my way home to get a new head. But I'm all right, now, and I shall be very careful not to get this beautiful head smashed.\" And he shook the Wizard's hand again.  \"Are the brains in the new head any better than the old ones?\" inquired the Sawhorse, who had watched Jack's restoration.  \"Why, these seeds are quite tender,\" replied the Wizard, \"so they will give our friend tender thoughts. But, to speak truly, my dear Sawhorse, Jack Pumpkinhead, with all his good qualities, will never be noted for his wisdom.\"  [Illustration]     THE SCARECROW AND THE TIN WOODMAN   There lived in the Land of Oz two queerly made men who were the best"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25519"],["title","Little Wizard Stories of Oz (#5)"],["body"," friends. They were so much happier when together that they were seldom apart; yet they liked to separate, once in a while, that they might enjoy the pleasure of meeting again.  One was a Scarecrow. That means he was a suit of blue Munchkin clothes, stuffed with straw, on top of which was fastened a round cloth head, filled with bran to hold it in shape. On the head were painted two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth. The Scarecrow had never been much of a success in scaring crows, but he prided himself on being a superior man, because he could feel no pain, was never tired and did not have to eat or drink. His brains were sharp, for the Wizard of Oz had put pins and needles in the Scarecrow's brains.  The other man was made all of tin, his arms and legs and head being cleverly jointed so that he could move them freely. He was known as the Tin Woodman, having at one time been a woodchopper, and everyone loved him because the Wizard had given him an excellent heart of red plush.  The Tin Woodman lived in a magnificent tin castle, built on his country estate in the Winkie Land, not far from the Emerald City of Oz. It had pretty tin furniture and was surrounded by lovely gardens in which were many tin trees and beds of tin flowers. The palace of the Scarecrow was not far distant, on the banks of a river, and this palace was in the shape of an immense ear of corn.  One morning the Tin Woodman went to visit his friend the Scarecrow, and as they had nothing better to do they decided to take a boat ride on the river. So they got into the Scarecrow's boat, which was formed from a big corncob, hollowed out and pointed at both ends and decorated around the edges with brilliant jewels. The sail was of purple silk and glittered gayly in the sunshine.  There was a good breeze that day, so the boat glided swiftly over the water. By and by they came to a smaller river that flowed from out a deep forest, and the Tin Woodman proposed they sail up this stream, as it would be cool and shady beneath the trees of the forest. So the Scarecrow, who was steering, turned the boat up the stream and the friends continued talking together of old times and the wonderful adventures they had met with while traveling with Dorothy, the little Kansas girl. They became so much interested in this talk that they forgot to notice that the boat was now sailing through the forest, or that the stream was growing more narrow and crooked.  Suddenly the Scarecrow glanced up and saw a big rock just ahead of them.  \"Look out!\" he cried; but the warning came too late.  The Tin Woodman sprang to his feet just as the boat bumped into the rock, and the jar made him lose his balance. He toppled and fell overboard and being made of tin he sank to the bottom of the water in an instant and lay there at full length, face up.  Immediately the Scarecrow threw out the anchor, so as to hold the boat in that place, and then he leaned over the side and through the clear water looked at his friend sorrowfully.  [Illustration]  \"Dear me!\" he exclaimed; \"what a _misfortune_!\"  \"It is, indeed,\" replied the Tin Woodman, speaking in muffled tones because so much water covered him. \"I cannot drown, of course, but I must lie here until you find a way to get me out. Meantime, the water is soaking into all my joints and I shall become badly rusted before I am rescued.\"  \"Very true,\" agreed the Scarecrow; \"but be patient, my friend, and I'll dive down and get you. My straw will not rust, and is easily replaced, if damaged, so I'm not afraid of the water.\"  The Scarecrow now took off his hat and made a dive from the boat into the water; but he was so light in weight that he barely dented the surface of the stream, nor could he reach the Tin Woodman with his outstretched straw arms. So he floated to the boat and climbed into it, saying the while:  \"Do not despair, my friend. We have an extra anchor aboard, and I will tie it around my waist, to make me sink, and dive again.\"  \"Don't do that!\" called the tin man. \"That would anchor you also to the bottom, where I am, and we'd both be helpless.\"  \"True enough,\" sighed the Scarecrow, wiping his wet face with a handkerchief; and then he gave a cry of astonishment, for he found he had wiped off one painted eye and now had but one eye to see with.  [Illustration]  \"How dreadful!\" said the poor Scarecrow. \"That eye must have been painted in water-color, instead of oil. I must be careful not to wipe off the other eye, for then I could not see to help you at all.\"  A shriek of elfish laughter greeted this speech and looking up the Scarecrow found the trees full of black crows, who seemed much amused by the straw man's one-eyed countenance. He knew the crows well, however, and they had usually been friendly to him because he had never deceived them into thinking he was a meat man--the sort of man they really feared.  \"Don't laugh,\" said he; \"you may lose an eye yourselves some day.\"  [Illustration]  \"We couldn't look as funny as you, if we did,\" replied one old crow, the king of them. \"But what has gone wrong with you?\"  \"The Tin Woodman, my dear friend and companion, has fallen overboard and is now on the bottom of the river,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I'm trying to get him out again, but I fear I shall not succeed.\"  \"Why, it's easy enough,\" declared the old crow. \"Tie a string to him and all of my crows will fly down, take hold of the string, and pull him up out of the water. There are hundreds of us here, so our united strength could lift much more than that.\"  \"But I can't tie a string to him,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My straw is so light that I am unable to dive through the water. I've tried it, and knocked one eye out.\"  \"Can't you fish for him?\"  \"Ah, that is a good idea,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I'll make the attempt.\"  He found a fishline in the boat, with a stout hook at the end of it. No bait was needed, so the Scarecrow dropped the hook into the water till it touched the Woodman.  \"Hook it into a joint,\" advised the crow, who was now perched upon a branch that stuck far out and bent down over the water.  The Scarecrow tried to do this, but having only one eye he could not see the joints very clearly.  \"Hurry up, please,\" begged the Tin Woodman; \"you've no idea how damp it is down here.\"  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"Can't you help?\" asked the crow.  \"How?\" inquired the tin man.  \"Catch the line and hook it around your neck.\"  The Tin Woodman made the attempt and after several trials wound the line around his neck and hooked it securely.  \"Good!\" cried the King Crow, a mischievous old fellow. \"Now, then, we'll all grab the line and pull you out.\"  At once the air was filled with black crows, each of whom seized the cord with beak or talons. The Scarecrow watched them with much interest and forgot that he had tied the other end of the line around his own waist, so he would not lose it while fishing for his friend.  \"All together for the good caws!\" shrieked the King Crow, and with a great flapping of wings the birds rose into the air.  The Scarecrow clapped his stuffed hands in glee as he saw his friend drawn from the water into the air; but the next moment the straw man was himself in the air, his stuffed legs kicking wildly; for the crows had flown straight up through the trees. On one end of the line dangled the Tin Woodman, hung by the neck, and on the other dangled the Scarecrow, hung by the waist and clinging fast to the spare anchor of the boat, which he had seized hoping to save himself.  \"Hi, there--be careful!\" shouted the Scarecrow to the crows. \"Don't take us so high. Land us on the river bank.\"  [Illustration]  But the crows were bent on mischief. They thought it a good joke to bother the two, now that they held them captive.  \"Here's where the crows scare the Scarecrow!\" chuckled the naughty King Crow, and at his command the birds flew over the forest to where a tall dead tree stood higher than all the other trees. At the very top was a crotch, formed by two dead limbs, and into the crotch the crows dropped the center of the line. Then, letting go their hold, they flew away, chattering with laughter, and left the two friends suspended high in the air--one on each side of the tree.  Now the Tin Woodman was much heavier than the Scarecrow, but the reason they balanced so nicely was because the straw man still clung fast to the iron anchor. There they hung, not ten feet apart, yet unable to reach the bare tree-trunk.  \"For goodness sake don't drop that anchor,\" said the Tin Woodman anxiously.  \"Why not?\" inquired the Scarecrow.  \"If you did I'd tumble to the ground, where my tin would be badly dented by the fall. Also you would shoot into the air and alight somewhere among the tree-tops.\"  \"Then,\" said the Scarecrow, earnestly, \"I shall hold fast to the anchor.\"  For a time they both dangled in silence, the breeze swaying them gently to and fro. Finally the tin man said: \"Here is an emergency, friend, where only brains can help us. We must think of some way to escape.\"  \"I'll do the thinking,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My brains are the sharpest.\"  He thought so long that the tin man grew tired and tried to change his position, but found his joints had already rusted so badly that he could not move them. And his oil-can was back in the boat.  \"Do you suppose your brains are rusted, friend Scarecrow?\" he asked in a weak voice, for his jaws would scarcely move.  \"No, indeed. Ah, here's an idea at last!\"  And with this the Scarecrow clapped his hands to his head, forgetting the anchor, which tumbled to the ground. The result was astonishing; for, just as the tin man had said, the light Scarecrow flew into the air, sailed over the top of the tree and landed in a bramble-bush, while the tin man fell plump to the ground, and landing on a bed of dry leaves was not dented at all. The Tin Woodman's joints were so rusted, however, that he was unable to move, while the thorns held the Scarecrow a fast prisoner.  While they were in this"]]]
