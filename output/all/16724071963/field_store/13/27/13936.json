Galileo continued his observations on these bodies every clear night till the 22d of March, and studied their motions in reference to fixed stars that were at the same time within the field of his telescope. Having thus clearly established that the four new stars were satellites or moons, which revolved round Jupiter in the same manner as the moon revolves round our own globe, he drew up an account of his discovery, in which he gave to the four new bodies the names of the _Medicean Stars_, in honour of his patron, Cosmo de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. This work, under the title of \"Nuncius Sidereus,\" or the \"Sidereal Messenger,\" was dedicated to the same prince; and the dedication bears the date of the 24th of March, only two days after he concluded his observations.  The importance of this great discovery was instantly felt by the enemies as well as by the friends of the Copernican system. The planets had hitherto been distinguished from the fixed stars only by their relative change of place, but the telescope proved them to be bodies so near to our own globe as to exhibit well-defined discs, while the fixed stars retained, even when magnified, the minuteness of remote and lucid points. The system of Jupiter, illuminated by four moons performing their revolutions in different and regular periods, exhibited to the proud reason of man the comparative insignificance of the globe he inhabits, and proclaimed in impressive language that that globe was not the centre of the universe.  The reception which these discoveries met with from Kepler is highly interesting, and characteristic of the genius of that great man. He was one day sitting idle, and thinking of Galileo, when his friend Wachenfels stopped his carriage at his door, to communicate to him the intelligence. \"Such a fit of wonder,\" says he, \"seized me at a report which seemed to be so very absurd, and I was thrown into such agitation at seeing an old dispute between us decided in this way, that between his joy, my colouring, and the laughter of both, confounded as we were by such a novelty, we were hardly capable, he of speaking, or I of listening. On our parting, I immediately began to think how there could be any addition to the number of the planets without overturning my 'Cosmographic Mystery,' according to which Euclid's five regular solids do not allow more than six planets round the sun.... I am so far from disbelieving the existence of the four circumjovial planets, that I long for a telescope, to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering _two_ round Mars, as the proportion seems to require, _six_ or _eight_ round Saturn, and perhaps _one_ each round Mercury and Venus.\"  In a very different spirit did the Aristotelians receive the \"Sidereal Messenger\" of Galileo. The principal professor of philosophy at Padua resisted Galileo's repeated and urgent entreaties to look at the moon and planets through his telescope; and he even laboured to convince the Grand Duke that the satellites of Jupiter could not possibly exist. Sizzi, an astronomer of Florence, maintained that as there were only _seven_ apertures in the head--_two_ eyes, _two_ ears, _two_ nostrils, and _one_ mouth--and as there were only _seven_ metals, and _seven_ days in the week, so there could be only _seven_ planets. He seems, however, to have admitted the visibility of the four satellites through the telescope; but he argues, that as they are invisible to the naked eye, they can exercise no influence on the earth; and being useless, they do not therefore exist.  A _protegé_ of Kepler's, of the name of Horky, wrote a volume against Galileo's discovery, after having declared, \"that he would never concede his four new planets to that Italian from Padua, even if he should die for it.\" This resolute Aristotelian was at no loss for arguments. He asserted that he had examined the heavens _through Galileo's own glass_, and that no such thing as a satellite existed round Jupiter. He affirmed, that he did not more surely know that he had a soul in his body, than that reflected rays are the sole cause of Galileo's erroneous observations; and that the only use of the new planets was to gratify Galileo's thirst for gold, and afford to himself a subject of discussion.  When Horky first presented himself to Kepler, after the publication of this work, the opinion of his patron was announced to him by a burst of indignation which overwhelmed the astonished author. Horky supplicated mercy for his offence; and, as Kepler himself informed Galileo, he took him again into favour, on the condition that Kepler was to show him Jupiter's satellites, and that Horky was not only to see them, but to admit their existence.  When the spirit of philosophy had thus left the individuals who bore so unworthily her sacred name, it was fortunate for science that it found a refuge among princes. Notwithstanding the reiterated logic of his philosophical professor at Padua, Cosmo de Medici preferred the testimony of his senses to the syllogisms of his instructor. He observed the new planets several times, along with Galileo, at Pisa; and when he parted with him, he gave him a present worth more than 1000 florins, and concluded that liberal arrangement to which we have already referred.  As philosopher and principal mathematician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Galileo now took up his residence at Florence, with a salary of 1000 florins. No official duties, excepting that of lecturing occasionally to sovereign princes, were attached to this appointment; and it was expressly stipulated that he should enjoy the most perfect leisure to complete his treatises on the constitution of the universe, on mechanics, and on local motion. The resignation of his professorship in the university of Padua, which was the necessary consequence of his new appointment, created much dissatisfaction: but though many of his former friends refused at first to hold any communication with him, this excitement gradually subsided; and the Venetian senate at last appreciated the feelings, as well as the motives, which induced a stranger to accept of promotion in his native land.  While Galileo was enjoying the reward and the fame of his great discovery, a new species of enmity was roused against him. Simon Mayer, an astronomer of no character, pretended that he had discovered the satellites of Jupiter before Galileo, and that his first observation was made on the 29th of December, 1609. Other astronomers announced the discovery of new satellites: Scheiner reckoned five, Rheita nine, and others found even so many as twelve: these satellites, however, were found to be only fixed stars. The names of _Vladislavian_, _Agrippine_, _Uranodavian_, and _Ferdinandotertian_, which were hastily given to these common telescopic stars, soon disappeared from the page of science, and even the splendid telescopes of modern times have not been able to add another gem to the diadem of Jupiter.  A modern astronomer of no mean celebrity has, even in the present day, endeavoured to rob Galileo of this staple article of his reputation. From a careless examination of the papers of our celebrated countryman, Thomas Harriot, which Baron Zach had made in 1784, at Petworth, the seat of Lord Egremont, this astronomer has asserted[13] that Harriot first observed the satellites of Jupiter on the 16th of January, 1610; and continued his observations till the 25th of February, 1612. Baron Zach adds the following extraordinary conclusion:--\"Galileo pretends to have discovered them on the 7th of January, 1610; so that it is not improbable that Harriot was likewise the first discoverer of these attendants of Jupiter.\" In a communication which I received from Dr Robertson, of Oxford, in 1822,[14] he informed me that he had examined a portion of Harriot's papers, entitled, \"De Jovialibus Planetis;\" and that it appears, from two pages of these papers, _that Harriot first observed Jupiter's satellites on the 17th of October, 1610_. These observations are accompanied with rough drawings of the positions of the satellites, and rough calculations of their periodical revolutions. My friend, Professor Rigaud,[15] who has very recently examined the Harriot MSS., has confirmed the accuracy of Dr Robertson's observations, and has thus restored to Galileo the honour of being the first and the sole discoverer of these secondary planets.

CHAPTER III.       _Galileo announces his discoveries in Enigmas--Discovers the      Crescent of Venus--the Ring of Saturn--the Spots on the      Sun--Similar Observations made in England by Harriot--Claims of      Fabricius and Scheiner to the discovery of the Solar      Spots--Galileo's Letters to Velser on the claims of Scheiner--His      residence at the Villa of Salviati--Composes his work on Floating      Bodies, which involves him in new controversies._   The great success which attended the first telescopic observations of Galileo, induced him to apply his best instruments to the other planets of our system. The attempts which had been made to deprive him of the honour of some of his discoveries, combined, probably, with a desire to repeat his observations with better telescopes, led him to announce his discoveries under the veil of an enigma, and to invite astronomers to declare, within a given time, if they had observed any new phenomena in the heavens.  Before the close of 1610, Galileo excited the curiosity of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25992"],["title","The Martyrs of Science, or, The lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (#6)"],["body","by the publication of his first enigma. Kepler and others tried in vain to decipher it; but in consequence of the Emperor Rodolph requesting a solution of the puzzle, Galileo sent him the following clue:--       \"Altissimam planetam tergeminam observavi.\"       I have observed that the most remote planet is triple.  In explaining more fully the nature of his observation, Galileo remarked that Saturn was not a single star, but three together, nearly touching one another. He described them as having no relative motion, and as having the form of three o's, namely, oOo, the central one being larger than those on each side of it.  Although Galileo had announced that nothing new appeared in the other planets, yet he soon communicated to the world another discovery of no slight interest. The enigmatical letters in which it was concealed formed the following sentence:--       \"Cynthiæ figuras æmulatur mater Amorum.\"       Venus rivals the phases of the moon.  Hitherto, Galileo had observed Venus when her disc was largely illuminated; but having directed his telescope to her when she was not far removed from the sun, he saw her in the form of a crescent, resembling exactly the moon at the same elongation. He continued to observe her night after night, during the whole time that she could be seen in the course of her revolution round the sun, and he found that she exhibited the very same phases which resulted from her motion round that luminary.  Galileo had long contemplated a visit to the metropolis of Italy, and he accordingly carried his intentions into effect in the early part of the year 1611. Here he was received with that distinction which was due to his great talents and his extended reputation. Princes, Cardinals, and Prelates hastened to do him honour; and even those who discredited his discoveries, and dreaded their results, vied with the true friends of science in their anxiety to see the intellectual wonder of the age.  In order to show the new celestial phenomena to his friends at Rome, Galileo took with him his best telescope; and as he had discovered the spots on the sun's surface in October or November 1610, or even earlier,[16] he had the gratification of exhibiting them to his admiring disciples. He accordingly erected his telescope in the Quirinal garden, belonging to Cardinal Bandini; and in April 1611 he shewed them to his friends in many of their most interesting variations. From their change of position on the sun's disc, Galileo at first inferred, either that the sun revolved about an axis, or that other planets, like Venus and Mercury, revolved so near the sun as to appear like black spots when they were opposite to his disc. Upon continuing his observations, however, he saw reason to abandon this hasty opinion. He found that the spots must be in contact with the surface of the sun,--that their figures were irregular,--that they had different degrees of darkness,--that one spot would often divide itself into three or four,--that three or four spots would often unite themselves into one,--and that all the spots revolved regularly with the sun, which appeared to complete its revolution in about twenty-eight days.       [16] Professor Rigaud is of opinion that Galileo had discovered the      solar spots at an earlier period than eighteen months before May      1612.  Previous to the invention of the telescope, spots had been more than once seen on the sun's disc with the unassisted eye. But even if these were of the same character as those which Galileo and others observed, we cannot consider them as anticipations of their discovery by the telescope. As the telescope was now in the possession of several astronomers, Galileo began to have many rivals in discovery; but notwithstanding the claims of Harriot, Fabricius, and Scheiner, it is now placed beyond the reach of doubt that he was the first discoverer of the solar spots. From the communication which I received in 1822 from the late Dr Robertson, of Oxford,[17] it appeared that Thomas Harriot had observed the solar spots on the 8th of December 1610; but his manuscripts, in Lord Egremont's possession,[18] incontestably prove that his regular observations on the spots did not commence till December 1, 1611, although he had seen the spots at the date above mentioned, and that they were continued till the 18th of January 1613. The observations which he has recorded are 199 in number, and the accounts of them are accompanied with rough drawings representing the number, position, and magnitude of the spots.[19] In the observation of Harriot, made on the 8th December 1610, before he knew of Galileo's discovery, he saw three spots on the sun, which he has represented in a diagram. The sun was then 7° or 8° high, and there was a frost and a mist, which no doubt acted as a darkening glass. Harriot does not apply the name of spots to what he noticed in this observation, and he does not enumerate it among the 199 observations above mentioned. Professor Rigaud[20] considers it \"a misapplication of terms to call such an observation a discovery;\" but, with all the respect which we feel for the candour of this remark, we are disposed to confer on Harriot the merit of an original discoverer of the spots on the sun.       [17] See page 40.       [18] These interesting MSS. I have had the good fortune of seeing      in the possession of my much valued friend, the late Professor      Rigaud of Oxford.       [19] Edin. Phil. Journ. 1822, vol. vi. p. 317. See Rigaud's Life of      Bradley, Supplement, p. 31.       [20] Id. It., p. 37, 38.  Another candidate for the honour of discovering the spots of the sun, was John Fabricius, who undoubtedly saw them previous to June 1611. The dedication of the work[21] in which he has recorded his observation, bears the date of the 13th of June 1611; and it is obvious, from the work itself, that he had seen the spots about the end of the year 1610; but as there is no proof that he saw them before October, we are compelled to assign the priority of the discovery to the Italian astronomer.       [21] Joh. Fabricii Phrysii de Maculis in Sole observatis, et      apparente earum cum Sole conversione, Narratio. Wittemb. 1611.  The claim of Scheiner, professor of mathematics at Ingolstadt, is more intimately connected with the history of Galileo. This learned astronomer having, early in 1611, turned his telescope to the sun, necessarily discovered the spots which at that time covered his disc. Light flying clouds happened, at the time, to weaken the intensity of his light, so that he was able to show the spots to his pupils. These observations were not published till January 1612; and they appeared in the form of three letters, addressed to Mark Velser, one of the magistrates of Augsburg, under the signature of _Appelles post Tabulam_. Scheiner, who, many years afterwards, published an elaborate work on the subject, adopted the same idea which had at first occurred to Galileo--that the spots were the dark sides of planets revolving round and near the sun.[22]       [22] It does not appear from the history of solar observations at      what time, and by whom, coloured glasses were first introduced for      permitting the eye to look at the sun with impunity. Fabricius was      obviously quite ignorant of the use of coloured glasses. He      observed the sun when he was in the horizon, and when his      brilliancy was impaired by the interposition of thin clouds and      floating vapours; and he advises those who may repeat his      observations to admit at first to the eye a small portion of the      sun's light, till it is gradually accustomed to its full splendour.      When the sun's altitude became considerable, Fabricius gave up his      observations, which he often continued so long that he was scarcely      able, for two days together, to see objects with their usual      distinctness. Fabricius speaks of observing the sun by admitting      his rays through a small _hole_ into a dark room, and receiving his      image on paper; but he says nothing about a lens or a telescope      being applied to the hole; and he does not say that he saw the      spots of the sun in this way. Harriot also viewed the solar spots      when the sun was near the horizon, or was visible through \"thick      layer and thin cloudes,\" or through thin mist. On December 21,      1611, at a quarter past 2 P.M., he observed the spots when the sky      was perfectly clear, but his \"sight was after dim for an houre.\"       Scheiner, in his \"Appelles post Tabulam,\" describes four different      ways of viewing the spots; one of which is by the _interposition of      blue or green glasses_. His first method was to observe the sun      near the horizon; the second was to view him through a transparent      cloud; the third was to look at him through his telescope with a      blue or a green glass of a proper thickness, and plane on both      sides, or to use a thin blue glass when the sun was covered with a      thin vapour or cloud; and the fourth method was to begin and      observe the sun at his margin, till the eye gradually reached the      middle of his disc.  On the publication of Scheiner's letters, Velser transmitted a copy of them to his friend Galileo, with the request that he would favour him with his opinion of the new phenomena. After some delay, Galileo addressed three letters to Velser, in which he combated the opinions of Scheiner on the cause of the spots. The first of these letters was dated the 4th of May 1612;[23] but though the controversy was carried on in the language of mutual respect and esteem, it put an end to the friendship which had existed between the two astronomers. In these letters Galileo showed that the spots often dispersed like vapours or clouds; that they sometimes had a duration of only one or two days, and at other times of thirty or forty days; that they contracted in their breadth when they approached the sun's limb,"]]]
