Shoot it into the ground in front of them, deep enough to be below their canopy ray, see, and detonate under them as they go over it!\"  I heard Handan's roar of exultation as I switched off again to order a barrage from my Wyoming girls. Then I threw my rocket motor to full speed and shot off a mile to one side, and higher, for I knew that soon there would be a boiling eruption below.  No smoke interfered with my view of it, for our atomic explosive was smokeless in its action. A line of blinding, flashing fire appeared in front of the groundship wedge. The ships ploughed with calm determination toward it, but it withdrew before them, not steadily, but jerkily intermittent, so that the ground became a series of gigantic humps, ridges and shell holes. Into these the Han ships wallowed, plunging ponderously yet not daring to stop while their protective canopy rays played, not daring to shut off these active rays.  One overturned. Our observers reported it. The result was a hail of rocket shells directly on the squadron. These could not penetrate the canopies of the other ships, but the one which had turned turtle was blown to fragments.  The squadron attempted to change its course and dodge the barrier in front of it. But a new barrier of blazing detonations and churned earth appeared on its flanks. In a matter of minutes it was ringed around, thanks to the skill of our fire control.  One by one the wallowing ships plunged into holes from which they could not extricate themselves. One by one their canopy rays were shut off, or the ships somersaulted off the knolls on which they perched, as their canopies melted the ground away from around them. So one by one they were destroyed.  Thus the second ground sortie of the Hans was annihilated.     CHAPTER IV  Han Electrono-Ray Science   At this period the Hans of Nu-Yok had only one airship equipped with their new armored repeller ray, their latest defense against our tactics of shooting rockets into the repeller rays and letting the latter hurl them up against the ships. They had developed a new steel alloy of tremendous strength, which passed their _rep_ ray with ease, but was virtually impervious to our most powerful explosives. Their supplies of this alloy were limited, for it could be produced only in the Lo-Tan shops, for it was only there that they could develop the degree of electronic power necessary for its manufacture.  This ship shot out toward our lines just as the last of the groundships turned turtle and was blown to pieces. As it approached, the rockets of our invisible and widely scattered gunners in the forest below began to explode beneath its _rep_ ray plates. The explosions caused the great ship to plunge and roll mightily, but otherwise did it no serious harm that I could see, for it was very heavily armored.  Occasionally rockets fired directly at the ship would find their mark and tear gashes in its side and bottom plates, but these hits were few. The ship was high in the air, and a far more difficult target than were its _rep_ ray columns. To hit the latter, our gunners had only to gauge their aim vertically. Range could be practically ignored, since the _rep_ ray at any point above two-thirds the distance from the earth to the ship would automatically hurl the rocket upward against the _rep_ ray plate.  As the ship sped toward us, rocking, plunging and recovering, it began to beam the forest below. It was equipped with a superbeam too, which cut a swathe nearly a hundred feet wide wherever it played.  With visions of many a life snuffed out below me, I surrendered to the impulse to stage a single-handed attack on this ship, feeling quite secure in my floating shell of inertron. I nosed up vertically, and rocketed for a position above the ship. Then as I climbed upward, as yet unobserved in my tiny craft that was scarcely larger than myself, I trained my telultroscope on the Han ship, focussing through to a view of its interior.  Much as I had imbibed of this generation's hatred for the Hans, I was forced to admire them for the completeness and efficiency of this marvelous craft of theirs.  Constantly twirling the controls of my scope to hold the focus, I examined its interior from nose to stern.         *       *       *       *       *  It may be of interest at this point to give the reader a layman's explanation of the electronic or ionic machinery of these ships, and of their general construction, for today the general public knows little of the particular application of the electronic laws which the Hans used, although the practical application of ultronics are well understood.  Back in the Twentieth Century I had, like literally millions of others, dabbled a bit in \"radio\" as we called it then; the science of the Hans was simply the superdevelopment of \"electricity,\" \"radio,\" and \"broadcasting.\"  It must be understood that this explanation of mine is not technically accurate, but only what might be termed an illustrative approximation.  The Hans' power-stations used to broadcast three distinct \"_powers_\" simultaneously. Our engineers called them the \"_starter_,\" the \"_pullee_\" and the \"_sub-disintegrator_.\" The last named had nothing to do with the operation of the ships, but was exclusively the powerizer of the disintegrator generators.  The \"_starter_\" was not unlike the \"radio\" broadcasts of the Twentieth Century. It went out at a frequency of about 1,000 kilocycles, had an amperage of approximately zero, but a voltage of two billion. Properly amplified by the use of _inductostatic_ batteries (a development of the principle underlying the earth induction compass applied to the control of static) this current energized the _\"A\" ionomagnetic_ coils on the airships, large and sturdy affairs, which operated the _Attractoreflex Receivers_, which in turn \"pulled in\" the second broadcast power known as the \"_pullee_,\" absorbing it from every direction, literally exhausting it from surrounding space. The \"_pullee_\" came in at about a half-billion volts, but in very heavy amperage, proportional to the capacity of the receiver, and on a long wave--at audio frequency in fact. About half of this power reception ultimately actuated the _repeller ray_ generators. The other half was used to energize the _\"B\" ionomagnetic_ coils, peculiarly wound affairs, whose magnetic fields constituted the only means of insulating and controlling the circuits of the three \"powers.\"  The repeller ray generators, operating on this current, and in conjunction with \"twin synchronizers\" in the power broadcast plant, developed two rhythmically variable ether-ground circuits of opposite polarity. In the \"X\" circuit, the negative was grounded along an ultraviolet beam from the ship's repeller-ray generator. The positive connection was through the ether to the \"X synchronizer\" in the power plant, whose opposite pole was grounded. The \"Y\" circuit travelled the same course, but in the opposite direction.  The rhythmic variables of these two opposing circuits, as nearly as I can understand it, in heterodyning, created a powerful material \"push\" from the earth, up along the violet ray beam against the _rep_ ray generator and against the two synchronizers at the power plant.  This push developed molecularly from the earth-mass-resultant to the generator; and at the same fractional distance from the _rep_ ray generator to the power plant.         *       *       *       *       *  The force exerted upward against the ship was, of course, highly concentrated, being confined to the path of the ultraviolet beam. Air or any material substance, coming within the indicated section of the beam, was thrown violently upward. The ships actually rode on columns of air thus forcefully up-thrown. Their \"home berths\" and \"stations\" were constructed with air pits beneath. When they rose from ordinary ground in open country, there was a vast upheaval of earth beneath their generators at the instant of take-off; this ceased as they got well above ground level.  Equal pressure to the lifting power of the generator was exerted against the synchronizers at the power plant, but this force, not being concentrated directionally along an ultraviolet beam, involved a practical problem only at points relatively close to the synchronizers.  Of course the synchronizers were automatically controlled by the operation of the generators, and only the two were needed for any number of ships drawing power from the station, providing their protection was rugged enough to stand the strain.  Actually, they were isolated in vast spherical steel chambers with thick walls, so that nothing but air pressure would be hurled against them, and this, of course, would be self-neutralizing, coming as it did from all directions.  The \"sub-disintegrator power\" reached the ships as an ordinary broadcast reception at a negligible amperage, but from one to 500 \"quints\" (quintillions) voltage, controllable only by the fields of the _\"B\" ionomagnetic_ coils. It had a wave-length of about ten meters. In the _dis_ ray generator, this wave-length was broken up into an almost unbelievably high frequency, and became a directionally controlled wave of an infinitesimal fraction of an inch. This wave-length, actually identical with the diameter of an electron, that is to say, being accurately \"tuned\" to an electron, disrupted the orbital paths and balanced pulsations of the electrons within the atom, so desynchronizing them as to destroy polarity balance of the atom and causing it to cease to exist as an atom. It was in this way that the ray reduced matter to \"nothingness.\"  This destruction of the atom, and a limited power for its reconstruction under certain conditions, marked the utmost progress of the Han science.     CHAPTER V  American Ultronic Science   Our own engineers, working in shielded laboratories far underground, had established such control"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25438"],["title","The Airlords of Han (#4)"],["body","the \"de-atomized\" electrons as to dissect them in their turn into _sub-electrons_. Moreover, they had carried through the study of this \"order\" to the point where they finally \"dissected\" the _sub-electron_ into its component _ultrons_, for the fundamental laws underlying these successive orders are not radically dissimilar. And as they progressed, they developed constructive as well as destructive practice. Hence the great triumphs of ultron and inertron, our two wonderful synthetic elements, built up from super-balanced and sub-balanced ultronic whorls, through the _sub-electronic_ order into the _atomic_ and _molecular_.  Hence also, come our relatively simple and beautifully efficient ultrophones and ultroscopes, which in their phonic and visual operation penetrate obstacles of material, electronic and sub-electronic nature without let or hindrance, and with the consumption of but infinitesimal power.  Static disturbance, I should explain, is negligible in the sub-electronic order, and non-existent in the ultronic.  The pioneer expeditions of our engineers into the ultronic order, I am told, necessitated the use of most elaborate, complicated and delicate apparatus, as well as the expenditure of most costly power, but once established there, all necessary power is developed very simply from tiny batteries composed of thin plates of _metultron_ and _katultron_. These two substances, developed synthetically in much the same manner as ordinary ultron, exhibit dual phenomena which for sake of illustration I may compare with certain of the phenomena of radioactivity. As radium is constantly giving off electronic emanations and changing its atomic structure thereby, so _katultron_ is constantly giving off _ultronic_ emanations, and so changing its _sub-electronic_ form, while _metultron_, its complement, is constantly attracting and absorbing _ultronic_ values, and so changing its sub-electronic nature in the opposite direction. Thin plates of these two substances, when placed properly in juxtaposition, with insulating plates of inertron between, constitute a battery which generates an ultronic current.         *       *       *       *       *  And it is a curious parallel that just as there were many mysteries connected with the nature of electricity in the Twentieth Century (mysteries which, I might mention, never _have_ been solved, notwithstanding our penetration into the \"sub-\" orders) so there are certain mysteries about the ultronic current. It will flow, for instance, through an ultron wire, from the _katultron_ to the _metultron_ plate, as electricity will flow through a copper wire. It will short circuit between the two plates if the inertron insulation is imperfect. When the insulation is perfect, however, and no ultron metallic circuit is complete, the \"current\" (apparently the same that would flow through the metallic circuit) is projected into space in an absolutely straight line from the _katultron_ plate, and received from space by the _metultron_ plate on the same line. This line is the theoretical straight line passing through the mass-center of each plate. The shapes and angles of the plates have nothing to do with it, except that the perpendicular distance of the plate edges from the mass-center line determines thickness of the beam of parallel current-rays.  Thus a simple battery may be used either as a sender or receiver of current. Two batteries adjusted to the same center line become connected in series just as if they were connected by ultron wires.  In actual practice, however, two types of batteries are used; both the _foco_ batteries and _broadcast_ batteries.  _Foco_ batteries are twin batteries, arranged to shoot a positive and a negative beam in the same direction. When these beams are made intermittent at light frequencies (though they are not light waves, nor of the same order as light waves) and are brought together, or focussed, at a given spot, the space in which they cross radiates alternating ultronic current in every direction. This radiated _ultralight_ acts like true light so long as the crossing beams vibrate at light frequencies, except in three respects: first, it is not visible to the eye; second, its \"color\" is exclusively dependent on the frequency of the _foco_ beams, which determine the frequency of the alternating radiation. Material surfaces, it would appear, reflect them all in equal value, and the color of the resultant picture depends on the color of the _foco_ frequencies. By altering these, a reddish, yellowish or bluish picture may be seen. In actual practice an orthochromatic mixture of frequencies is used to give a black, gray and white picture. The third difference is this: rays pulsating in line toward any ultron object connected with the rear plates of the twin batteries through rectifiers cannot be reflected by material objects, for it appears they are subject to a kind of \"pull\" which draws them straight through material objects, which in a sense are \"magnetized\" and while in this state offer no resistance.  Ultron, when so connected with battery terminals, glows with true light under the impact of _ultralight_, and if in the form of a lens or set of lenses, may be made to deliver a picture in any telescopic degree desired.         *       *       *       *       *  The essential parts of an ultroscope, then, are twin batteries with focal control and frequency control; an ultron shield, battery connected and adjustable, to intercept the direct rays from the \"_glow-spot_,\" with an ordinary light-shield between it and the lens; and the lens itself, battery connected and with more or less telescopic elaboration.  To look through a substance at an object, one has only to focus the _glow-spot_ beyond the substance but on the near side of the object and slightly above it.  A complete apparatus may be \"set\" for \"penetrative,\" \"distance\" and \"normal vision.\"  In the first, which one would use to look through the forest screen from the air, or in examining the interior of a Han ship or any opaque structure, the _glow-spot_ is brought low, at only a tiny angle above the vision line, and the shield, of course, must be very carefully adjusted.  \"Distance\" setting would be used, for instance, in surveying a valley beyond a hill or mountain; the _glow-spot_ is thrown high to illuminate the entire scene.  In the \"normal\" setting the _foco_ rays are brought together close overhead, and illuminate the scene just as a lamp of super brilliancy would in the same position.  For phonic communication a spherical sending battery is a ball of metultron, surrounded by an insulating shell of inertron, and this in turn by a spherical shell of katultron, from which the current radiates in every direction, tuning being accomplished by frequency of intermissions, with audio-frequency modulation. The receiving battery has a core pole of katultron and an outer shell of metultron. The receiving battery, of course, picks up all frequencies, the undesired ones being tuned out in detection.  Tuning, however, is only a convenience for privacy and elimination of interference in ultrophonic communication. It is not involved as a necessity, for untuned currents may be broadcast at voice-controlled frequencies, directly and without any carrier wave.  To use plate batteries or single center-line batteries for phonic communication would require absolutely accurate directional aligning of sender and receiver, a very great practical difficulty, except when sender and receiver are relatively close and mutually visible.         *       *       *       *       *  This, however, is the regular system used in the Inter-Gang network for official communication. The senders and receivers used in this system are set only with the greatest difficulty, and by the aid of the finest laboratory apparatus, but once set, they are permanently locked in position at the stations, and barring earthquakes or insecure foundations, need no subsequent adjustment. Accuracy of alignment permits beam paths no thicker than the old lead pencils I used to use in the Twentieth Century.  The non-interference of such communication lines, and the difficulty of cutting in on them from any point except immediately adjacent to the sender or receiver, is strikingly apparent when it is realized that every square inch of an imaginary plane bisecting the unlocated beam would have to be explored with a receiving battery in order to locate the beam itself.  A practical compromise between the spherical or universal broadcast senders and receivers on the one hand, and the single line batteries on the other, is the _multi-facet battery_. Another, and more practical device particularly for distance work, is the _window-spherical_. It is merely an ordinary spherical battery with a shielding shell with an opening of any desired size, from which a directionally controlled beam may be emitted in different forms, usually that simply of an expanding cone, with an angle of expansion sufficient to cover the desired territory at the desired point of reception.     CHAPTER VI  An Unequal Duel   But to return to my narrative, and my _swooper_, from which I was gazing at the interior of the Han ship.  This ship was not unlike the great dirigibles of the Twentieth Century in shape, except that it had no suspended control car nor gondolas, no propellers, and no rudders, aside from a permanently fixed double-fishtail stabilizer at the rear, and a number of \"keels\" so arranged as to make the most of the repeller ray airlift columns.  Its width was probably twice as great as its depth, and its length about twice its width. That is to say, it was about 100 feet from the main keel to the top-deck at their maximum distance from each other, about 200 feet wide amidship, and between 400 and 500 feet long. It had in addition to the top-deck, three interior decks. In its general curvature the ship was a compromise between a true streamline design and a"]]]
