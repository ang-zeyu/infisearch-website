What _are_ you doing with all these dolls?\"  \"Dressing them. How did you like Paris? Was it very gay? And was London smoky,--foggy, I mean?\"  \"Yes; everything was gay or smoky or lovely by moonlight, or just what it ought to be. Now tell me _why_ you dress four hundred million dolls all at once.\"  \"Oh, they're for the Sunshine Babies. Was Naples very dirty? How did you like----\"  \"Clementine, you leave the map of Europe alone. I'm talking now! What are Sunshine Babies?\"  \"Why, the babies that the Sunshine Society gives a Christmas to. And there's oceans of babies, and they all want dolls,--I guess the boys must like dolls, too, they want so many. And, oh, Patty, they're the dearest little things,--the babies, I mean,--and I just _love_ to dress dolls for them. I'd rather do it than to make presents for my rich friends.\"  Suddenly Patty felt a great wave of self-compunction. She had planned and prepared gifts for all her friends, and for most of her relatives, but for the poor she had done nothing! To charity she had given no thought! And at Christmas, when all the world should feel the spirit of good will to men, she had utterly neglected to remember those less fortunate than herself.  \"What's the matter?\" said Clementine, dismayed by Patty's expression of remorse.  \"I'm a pig!\" said Patty; \"there's no other word for such a horrid thing as I am! Why, Clementine, I've made presents for nearly everybody I know, and I haven't done a thing for charity! Did you ever know such an ungrateful wretch?\"  \"Oh, it isn't too late, yet,\" said Clementine, not quite understanding why Patty was so serious about it; \"here, help me sew these.\"  She tossed her some tiny satin sleeves, already cut and basted, and offered a furnished work-basket.  \"'Deed I will!\" said Patty, and in a few moments she too was sewing, as deftly, if not quite so rapidly, as Clementine.  \"You see, Clem,\" she went on, \"I've been so busy ever since I came home, that I simply forgot the poor people. And now it's too late.\"  \"It's too late to make things,\" agreed Clementine, \"but not too late to buy them.\"  \"But I've spent all my Christmas money,\" said Patty, contritely. \"Father gives me a liberal allowance, and then extra, for Christmas money. And it's just about all gone, and I hate to ask him for more.\"  \"Well, never mind, Patsy, you can make up for it next year. And if you help me dress these dolls, that will square up your conscience.\"  \"No, it won't. But I'll find a way to do something, somehow. Are these Sunshine people all babies?\"  \"Oh, no; the society helps all sorts of poor people, children and grown-ups too. Mother is one of the directors, and we do a lot of this doll-dressing every year.\"  \"Well, I'll help you a while this afternoon, but I won't have another chance. You see just about every moment is taken up from now till Christmas.\"  \"You're going to the Farringtons', aren't you?\"  \"Yes, for three or four days, while Nan and father are in Philadelphia at Nan's mother's. You're coming to the Christmas Eve dance, of course?\"  \"Yes, indeed. It's to be a lovely party. The Farringtons always have such beautiful entertainments. Now, Patty, do tell me about your trip.\"  So Patty told many tales of her stay in Paris and in England, and of her pleasure trip through Italy, and as she talked, her fingers flew, and she had soon completed three doll dresses, that were quite as pretty and well-made as Clementine's.  \"Now, I must go,\" she said, at last. \"I'm glad to have been of a little help, and next year I'll help you a lot. Though, I suppose your Sunshine Babies _could_ have dolls when it isn't Christmas.\"  \"Oh, yes; these are for their Tree, you know.\"  \"Well, Clem, if I should have some money left me unexpectedly, is it too late to buy some toys for the Tree?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Clementine, \"but we can ask mother. She'll know.\"  They found Mrs. Morse in her sitting-room, tying up parcels and addressing them.  Patty soon discovered that these were all charitable gifts, and not presents to Mrs. Morse's own friends.  \"I'm so glad I came here to-day,\" she said, after the welcoming greetings were over, \"for it has roused my charitable instincts. I am quite sure, Mrs. Morse, I can send some toys for your society's tree, if you want them.\"  \"Want them? Indeed we do! Why, Patty, there are forty little boys who want drums or trumpets and we can only give them candy and an orange. It's harder than you'd think to get subscriptions to our funds at Christmas time, and though we've dolls enough, we do so want toys for the boys.\"  \"Well, I'll send you some, Mrs. Morse. I'll send them to-morrow. Do you care what they are?\"  \"No, indeed. Drums, or balls, or tin carts,--anything that a boy-child can play with.\"  \"Well, you may depend on me for the forty,\" said Patty, smiling, for she had formed a sudden, secret resolve.  \"Why, Patty, dear, how kind of you! I am so glad, for those children were on my mind, and I've already asked every one I know to give to our fund. You are a generous little girl, and I know it will gladden your own heart as well as the children's.\"  Patty ran away, and all the way home her heart was full of her project.  \"If he will only consent,\" she thought. \"If not, I don't know how I shall keep my promise. Oh, well, I know I can coax him to say yes.\"  After dinner that evening, Patty put her plan into action.  \"Father Fairfield,\" she said, \"what are you going to give me for a Christmas gift?\"  \"Well, Pattykins, that's not considered a correct question in polite society.\"  \"Then let's be impolite, just for this once. Do tell me, daddy.\"  \"You embarrass me exceedingly, young lady,\" said Mr. Fairfield, smiling at her, \"for, to tell you the truth, I haven't bought you anything.\"  \"Oh, I'm so glad!\" exclaimed Patty, \"for, father, I want to ask you a great favour. Won't you give me the money instead, and let me spend it as I like?\"  \"That would be a funny Christmas gift. I thought you liked some pretty trinket, tied up in holly paper and red ribbons and Santa Claus seals, and served to you on a silver salver.\"  \"Well, I do, from other people. But from you, I just want the money that my present would cost, and--I want it now!\"  \"Bless my soul! She wants it now! Why, Patsy, what are you going to do? Buy stock?\"  \"No, but I do want it, father. Won't you give it to me, and I'll tell you afterward what I'm going to do with it.\"  \"I'll tell you now,\" said Nan, smiling at the pair. \"She's going to put it in the bank, because she's afraid she'll be poor some day.\"  \"I don't wonder you think that, stepmothery,\" said Patty, her eyes twinkling at Nan, \"for I did tell you so. But since then I've changed my mind, and though I want my present from father in cash, I'm going to spend it before Christmas, and not put it in the bank at all.\"  \"Well, you are a weathercock, Patty. But before morning you will have changed your mind again!\"  \"No, indeedy! It's made up to stay this time. So give me the money like a duck of a daddy, won't you?\"  Patty was very wheedlesome, as she caressed her father's cheek, and smiled into his eyes.  \"Well, as you don't often make a serious request, and as you seem to be in dead earnest this time, I rather think I shall have to say yes.\"  \"Oh, you dear, good, lovely father!\" cried Patty, embracing him. \"Will you give it to me now, and how much will it be?\"  \"Patty,\" said Nan, laughing, \"you're positively sordid! I never saw you so greedy for money before.\"  Patty laughed outright. Now that she had gained her point she felt in gay spirits.  \"Friends,\" she said, \"you see before you a pauper,--a penniless pauper! Therefore, and because of which, and by reason of the fact that I am in immediate need of money, I stoop to this means of obtaining it, and, as aforesaid, I'd like it now!\"  She held out her rosy palm to her father, and stood waiting expectantly.  \"Only one hand!\" exclaimed Mr. Fairfield, in surprise. \"I thought such a grasping young woman would expect both hands filled.\"  \"All right,\" said Patty, and she promptly extended her other palm, too.  Putting both his hands in his pockets, Mr. Fairfield drew them out again, and then laid a ten-dollar goldpiece on each of Patty's outstretched palms.  \"Oh, you dear daddy!\" she cried, as she clasped the gold in her fingers; \"you lovely parent! This is the nicest Christmas gift I ever had, and now I'll tell you all about it.\"  So she told them, quite seriously, how she had really forgotten to give the poor and the suffering any share of her own Christmas cheer, and how this was the only way she could think of to remedy her neglect.  \"And it's so lovely,\" she concluded; \"for there are forty little boy-children. And with this money I can get them each a fifty-cent present.\"  \"So you can,\" said Nan. \"I'll go with you to-morrow to select them. And if we can get some cheaper than fifty cents, and I think we can, you'll have a little left for extras.\"  \"That's so,\" agreed Patty. \"They often have lovely toys for about thirty-nine cents, and I could get some marbles or something to fill up.\"  \"To fill up what?\" asked her father.  \"Oh, to fill up the tree. Or I'll get some ornaments, or some tinsel to decorate it. Oh, father, you are so good to me! This is a lovely Christmas present.\"     CHAPTER III  THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS   Mr. Fairfield's gift to his wife was a beautiful motor-car, and as they were going away for the holiday, he presented it to her the day before Christmas.  It was practically a gift to Patty as well, for the whole family could enjoy it.  \"It's perfectly lovely,\" said Nan, as they all started out for a little spin, to try it. \"I've had so much trouble of late with taxicabs, that it's a genuine comfort to have my own car at my beck and call. It's a lovely car, Fred, and Patty and I shall just about live in it.\"  \"I want you to enjoy it,\" returned Mr. Fairfield, \"and you may have every confidence in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25869"],["title","Patty's Success (#3)"],["body","chauffeur. He's most highly recommended by a man I know well, and he's both careful and skilful.\"  \"A nice-mannered man, too,\" observed Patty. \"I like his looks, and his mode of address. But if this car is partly my present, then I ought not to have had that gold money to buy drums with.\"  \"Oh, yes, you ought,\" said her father. \"That was your individual gift. In this car you and Nan are partners. By the way, Puss, did you ever get your forty drums? I didn't hear about them.\"  \"You're lucky that you didn't hear them,\" laughed Patty. \"Yes, I did get them,--not all drums, some other toys,--and I took them down to the Sunshine place yesterday. I went with Mrs. Morse and Clementine. You know the kiddywids had their Christmas tree, the little poor children, and such a noise you never heard! They yelled and shouted for glee, and they banged drums and tooted horns, and then they sang songs, and I think I never knew such a noisy celebration, even on the fourth of July.\"  \"And were they glad to get your gifts?\"  \"Oh, yes, indeed! Why, just think, father, the little girls all had dolls, but if I hadn't taken the gifts for the boys, they would only have had candy or an orange. Next Christmas I'm going to do more for them.\"  \"I'm glad to see your charitable spirit waking up, Patty-girl. I don't want you to be a mere social butterfly. But, you know, you needn't wait for Christmas to make the poor babies happy.\"  \"No; I know it, daddy, dear; and after Christmas is over, I'm going to try to do some good in the world.\"  \"Now, Patty,\" said Nan, \"don't you go in for settlement work, and that sort of thing. I won't let you. You're not strong enough for it.\"  \"I don't know exactly what settlement work is,\" said Patty, \"but I do know I'm not going to be a mere butterfly. I'm going to accomplish something worth while.\"  \"Well, wait till the holiday season is over,\" advised Mr. Fairfield. \"You've made forty boys happy, now turn your attention to making your family and friends happy. What are you going to give your poor old father for a Christmas gift, I should like to know.\"  \"I haven't any such relative as you describe,\" returned Patty, smiling at him affectionately. \"I have a young and handsome father, and I think he seems to be rather a rich gentleman. Also I have a gift awaiting him at home, and I think we'd better be going there.\"  \"I do, too,\" said Nan. \"We've none too much time to get our luncheon and go to the train. Oh! what a comfort it will be to go to the train in our own motor-car.\"  \"Yes,\" said Patty, \"and then Miller can come back and take me over to Elise's.\"  So home they went, and had their own little Christmas celebration, before they went their separate ways.  \"This is a make-believe Christmas feast,\" said Patty, as they sat at their own luncheon table.  She had placed a sprig of holly at each plate, and a vase of poinsettia blossoms graced the centre of the table.  \"This ox-tail soup is in place of the boar's head,\" she went on, gaily; \"and I know we are going to have chicken croquettes, which we will pretend are the roast turkey. And then we'll have our presents, as I know you two will fly for your train as soon as you leave the table.\"  So Patty gave Nan her present, which was a lovely white couch pillow of lace and embroidery. And Nan gave Patty a picture to hang in her own room. It was a beautiful water-colour, a Venetian scene, and Patty was delighted with it.  Then Patty gave her father a gold penholder, which she had had made expressly for him, and engraved with his name.  \"Why, that's fine, Pattykins!\" he exclaimed. \"I can only write poems with a pen like that. It's not made for business letters, I'm sure.\"  \"Of course it isn't,\" said Patty, gaily; \"it's to keep on your desk in the library here at home. And you must use it just for social correspondence or----\"  \"Or to sign checks for us,\" suggested Nan, smiling.  \"That's just what I'll do with it,\" declared Mr. Fairfield. \"It's a gem of a pen; Patty, you know my weakness for fine desk appointments, don't you?\"  Nan gave her husband a watch fob, on which hung a locket containing a miniature of her own sweet face. Neither Patty nor her father had seen this before, as Nan had been careful to keep the matter secret in order to surprise them.  It was a real work of art, and so winsome was the pictured face that Patty cried out in admiration: \"What a stunner you are, Nan! I didn't realise you were so good-looking,--but it's exactly like you.\"  \"That's a mixed-up compliment, Patty,\" laughed Nan, \"but I'll surmise that you mean well.\"  \"I do so! I think it's a lovely picture of a lovely lady! There, how's that?\"  \"Much better,\" said Nan, as Patty caught her round the shoulders and kissed her affectionately.  \"Give me the lady,\" said Mr. Fairfield, taking Nan into his own arms. \"As the portrait is a gift to me, I will kiss her for it, myself.\"  \"Do,\" said Patty, \"but if you give her more than three kisses, you'll lose your train; it's getting pretty late.\"  \"Is it?\" cried Mr. Fairfield. \"Then, Jane, bring in those two boxes I left in your charge, will you?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" cried the waitress, and, leaving the room, she returned in a moment with two large white boxes.  \"These are Christmas gifts to the two loveliest ladies I know,\" said Mr. Fairfield, gallantly tendering a box to each.  \"But I've had my Christmas gift from you!\" exclaimed Patty, and \"So have I!\" cried Nan.  \"Nevertheless these are laid at your feet,\" said Mr. Fairfield, calmly depositing the boxes on the floor in front of them.  \"Oh, well, we may as well see what they are,\" said Patty, untying the white ribbons that fastened her box.  Nan did likewise, and in a moment they were both rapturously exclaiming over two sets of white furs that nestled in billows of white tissue paper.  Nan's furs were ermine, and Patty's were soft, fluffy, white fox, and so beautiful were they that the two recipients donned them at once, and posed side by side before the mirror, admiring themselves and each other. Then, with a simultaneous impulse they turned to thank the donor, and Mr. Fairfield found himself suddenly entangled in four arms and two boas, while two immense muffs met at the back of his neck and enveloped his head and ears.  \"Have mercy!\" he cried; \"come one at a time, can't you? Yes, yes, I'm glad you're pleased, but do get this fur out of my mouth! I feel as if I were attacked by polar bears!\"  \"Oh, Fathery Fairfield,\" Patty cried, \"you are the dearest thing in the world! How _did_ you know I wanted furs? And white fox, of all things! And ermine for Nan! Oh, but you _are_ a good gentleman! Isn't he, stepmother?\"  \"He'll do,\" said Nan, smiling roguishly at her husband, who, somehow, seemed satisfied with this faint praise.  \"Now, scamper, Nan-girl,\" he cried, \"if you would see your mother to-day, you must leave here in less than an hour. Can you be ready?\"  \"I can't, but I will,\" replied Nan, gaily, as she ran away to prepare for her journey.  Patty, too, went to her room to get ready for her visit at the Farringtons'. She was to stay three days, and as there were several parties planned for her entertainment, she packed a small trunk with several of her prettiest gowns. Also, she had a suitcase full of gifts for the Christmas tree, which was to be part of the festivities.  She bade her parents good-by when they started, and watched the new motor-car disappear round the corner, then returned to her own preparations.  \"I do have lovely things,\" she thought to herself, as she folded her dainty garments and laid them in their places.  Then she glanced again at her new furs.  \"I have too much,\" she thought; \"it isn't fair for one girl to have so much, when so many poor people have nothing. I wonder what I ought to do about it.\"  Poor Patty was confronting the problem that has troubled and baffled so many honest hearts, but the more she thought about it, the more it seemed insoluble.  \"At any rate, it would be absurd to give my white furs, or my chiffon frocks to poor people,\" she concluded, \"for they couldn't use them. Well, after the holidays, I'm going to see what I can do. But now, I must hurry, or I'll be late.\"  An hour or two later, she found herself in the Farringtons' home.  \"What lovely furs, Patty,\" exclaimed Mrs. Farrington, \"and how well they suit you!\"  They were extremely becoming, and Patty's pretty face, with its soft colour and smiling eyes, rose like a flower from the white fur at her throat.  \"Yes, aren't they beautiful?\" Patty responded. \"Father just gave them to me, and I'm so pleased with them.\"  \"And well you may be. Now, you girls run away and play, for I've a thousand things to do.\"  Indeed, Mrs. Farrington was in a whirlpool of presents that she was both sending and receiving. Maids and footmen were running hither and thither, bringing messages or carrying out orders, and as the whole house was full of warmth and light, and the spicy fragrance of Christmas greens, Patty fairly revelled in the pleasant atmosphere.  She was of a nature very susceptible to surroundings. Like a cat, she loved to bask in warm sunshine, or in a luxurious, softly-furnished place. Moreover, she was fond of Elise, and so looked forward to her three days' visit with glad anticipation.  After Patty had laid aside her things, the two girls sat down to chat in the big hall on the second floor of the mansion. A wood-fire was blazing, and soft, red-shaded lights cast a delightful glow.  \"Elise,\" said Patty, somewhat suddenly, \"don't you think we have too much riches and things?\"  Elise stared at her.  \"What do you mean?\" she asked.  Patty laughed at her friend's blank expression, but she went on.  \"I mean just what I say. Of course, you have lots more riches and things than I have; but I think we all have too much when we think of the poor people who haven't any.\"  \"Oh, you mean Socialism,\" exclaimed Elise, suddenly enlightened.  \"No, I don't mean Socialism. I mean plain, every-day charity. Don't you think we ought "]]]
