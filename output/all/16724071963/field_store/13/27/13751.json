There I'll come when I'm a man     With a camel caravan;     Light a fire in the gloom     Of some dusty dining room;     See the pictures on the walls,     Heroes, fights and festivals;     And in a corner find the toys     Of the old Egyptian boys.  [Illustration]  [Illustration: _\"Boats of mine a-boating.\"_]     WHERE GO THE BOATS?       Dark brown is the river,       Golden is the sand.     It flows along for ever,       With trees on either hand.      Green leaves a-floating,       Castles of the foam,     Boats of mine a-boating--       Where will all come home?      On goes the river       And out past the mill,     Away down the valley,       Away down the hill,      Away down the river,       A hundred miles or more,     Other little children       Shall bring my boats ashore.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     ESCAPE AT BEDTIME      The lights from the parlor and kitchen shone out     Through the blinds and the windows and bars;     And high overhead and all moving about,     There were thousands of millions of stars.     There ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree,     Nor of people in church or the Park,     As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me,     And that glistened and winked in the dark.      The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all,       And the star of the sailor, and Mars,     These shown in the sky, and the pail by the wall       Would be half full of water and stars.     They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries,       And they soon had me packed into bed;     But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes,       And the stars going round in my head.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     From A RAILWAY CARRIAGE       Faster than fairies, faster than witches,     Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches,     And charging along like troops in a battle,     All through the meadows the horses and cattle:     All of the sights of the hill and the plain     Fly as thick as driving rain;     And ever again, in the wink of an eye,     Painted stations whistle by.      Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,--     All by himself and gathering brambles;     Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;     And there is the green for stringing the daisies!     Here is a cart run away in the road     Lumping along with man and load;     And here is a mill and there is a river:     Each a glimpse and gone for ever!  [Illustration]     THE WIND       I saw you toss the kites on high     And blow the birds about the sky;     And all around I heard you pass,     Like ladies' skirts across the grass--       O wind, a-blowing all day long!       O wind, that sings so loud a song!      I saw the different things you did,     But always you yourself you hid.     I felt you push, I heard you call,     I could not see yourself at all--       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!      O you that are so strong and cold,     O blower, are you young or old?     Are you a beast of field and tree,     Or just a stronger child than me?       O wind, a-blowing all day long,       O wind, that sings so loud a song!  [Illustration: _\"I felt you push, I heard you call.\"_]  [Illustration]     Auntie's Skirts         Whenever Auntie moves around     Her dresses make a curious sound.       They trail behind her up the floor,     And trundle after through the door.  [Illustration]     HAPPY THOUGHT       The world is so full         of a number of things,       I'm sure we should all         be as happy as kings.     THE COW       The friendly cow all red and white,       I love with all my heart;     She gives me cream with all her might,       To eat with apple-tart.      She wanders lowing here and there,       And yet she cannot stray,     All in the pleasant open air,       The pleasant light of day;      And blown by all the winds that pass       And wet with all the showers,     She walks among the meadow grass       And eats the meadow flowers.  [Illustration: _\"She walks among the meadow grass.\"_]  [Illustration]     MY BED IS A BOAT       My bed is like a little boat;       Nurse helps me in when I embark;     She girds me in my sailor's coat       And starts me in the dark.      At night, I go on board and say       Good-night to all my friends on shore;     I shut my eyes and sail away       And see and hear no more.      And sometimes things to bed I take,       As prudent sailors have to do;     Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,       Perhaps a toy or two.      All night across the dark we steer;       But when the day returns at last,     Safe in my room, beside the pier,       I find my vessel fast.  [Illustration]     THE LAND OF NOD       From breakfast on through all the day     At home among my friends I stay,     But every night I go abroad     Afar into the Land of Nod.      All by myself I have to go,     With none to tell me what to do--     All alone beside the streams     And up the mountain-side of dreams.      The strangest things are there for me,     Both things to eat and things to see,     And many frightening sights abroad     Till morning in the Land of Nod.      Try as I like to find the way,     I never can get back by day,     Nor can remember plain and clear     The curious music that I hear.  [Illustration]     FAIRY BREAD       Come up here, O dusty feet!       Here is fairy bread to eat     Here in my retiring room,       Children, you may dine     On the golden smell of broom        And the shade of pine;     And when you have eaten well,           Fairy stories hear and tell.  [Illustration]     KEEPSAKE MILL       Over the borders, a sin without pardon,       Breaking the branches and crawling below,     Out through the breach in the wall of the garden,       Down by the banks of the river, we go.      Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,       Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,     Here is the sluice with the race running under--       Marvelous places, though handy to home!      Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,       Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;     Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,       Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.      Years may go by, and the wheel in the river       Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day,     Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever--       Long after all the boys are away.      Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,       Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;     Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,       Turning and churning that river to foam.      You with the bean that I gave when we quarreled,       I with your marble of Saturday last,     Honored and old and all gaily appareled,       Here we shall meet and remember the past.     WINTER-TIME       Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,     A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;     Blinks but an hour or two; and then,     A blood-red orange, sets again.      Before the stars have left the skies,     At morning in the dark I rise;     And shivering in my nakedness,     By the cold candle, bathe and dress.      Close by the jolly fire I sit     To warm my frozen bones a bit;     Or with a reindeer-sled, explore     The colder countries round the door.      When to go out, my nurse doth wrap     Me in my comforter and cap;     The cold wind burns my face, and blows     Its frosty pepper up my nose.      Black are my steps on silvery sod;     Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;     And tree and house, and hill and lake,     Are frosted like a wedding-cake.  [Illustration: _\"The cold wind burns my face.\"_]     LOOKING-GLASS RIVER       Smooth it slides upon its travel,       Here a wimple, there a gleam--         O the clean gravel!         O the smooth stream!      Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,       Paven pools as clear as air--         How a child wishes         To live down there!      We can see our colored faces       Floating on the shaken pool         Down in cool places,         Dim and very cool;      Till a wind or water wrinkle,       Dipping marten, plumping trout,         Spreads in a twinkle         And blots all out.  [Illustration: _\"We can see our colored faces.\"_]      See the rings pursue each other;       All below grows black as night,         Just as if mother         Had blown out the light!      Patience, children, just a minute--       See the spreading circles die;         The stream and all in it         Will clear by-and-by.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     The SUN'S TRAVELS       The sun is not a-bed, when I     At night upon my pillow lie;     Still round the earth his way he takes,     And morning after morning makes.      While here at home, in shining day,     We round the sunny garden play,     Each little Indian sleepy-head     Is being"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25617"],["title","A Child's Garden of Verses (#3)"],["body","and put to bed.      And when at eve I rise from tea,     Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;     And all the children in the West     Are getting up and being dressed.  [Illustration]     THE LAMPLIGHTER       My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;     It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;     For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,     With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.      Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,     And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;     But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,     O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!      For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,     And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;     And O, before you hurry by with ladder and with light,     O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!  [Illustration]  [Illustration: _\"Don't you wish that you were me?\"_]     FOREIGN CHILDREN       Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,     Little frosty Eskimo,     Little Turk or Japanee,     O! don't you wish that you were me?      You have seen the scarlet trees     And the lions over seas;     You have eaten ostrich eggs,     And turned the turtles off their legs.      Such a life is very fine,     But it's not so nice as mine:     You must often, as you trod,     Have wearied _not_ to be abroad.      You have curious things to eat,     I am fed on proper meat;     You must dwell beyond the foam,     But I am safe and live at home.      Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,     Little frosty Eskimo,     Little Turk or Japanee,     O! don't you wish that you were me?     THE MOON       The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;     She shines on thieves on the garden wall,     On streets and fields and harbor quays,     And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.      The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,     The howling dog by the door of the house,     The bat that lies in bed at noon,     All love to be out by the light of the moon.      But all of the things that belong to the day     Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;     And flowers and children close their eyes     Till up in the morning the sun shall arise.  [Illustration: _\"She shines on thieves on the garden wall.\"_]  [Illustration: _\"O what a place for play.\"_]     THE HAYLOFT       Through all the pleasant meadow-side       The grass grew shoulder-high,     Till the shining scythes went far and wide       And cut it down to dry.      These green and sweetly smelling crops       They led in wagons home;     And they piled them here in mountain-tops       For mountaineers to roam.      Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail,       Mount Eagle and Mount High;--     The mice that in these mountains dwell,       No happier are than I!      O what a joy to clamber there,       O what a place for play,     With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,       The happy hills of hay!  [Illustration: _\"Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!\"_]     FAREWELL TO THE FARM       The coach is at the door at last;     The eager children, mounting fast     And kissing hands, in chorus sing:     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      To house and garden, field and lawn,     The meadow-gates we swang upon,     To pump and stable, tree and swing,     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      And fare you well for evermore,     O ladder at the hayloft door,     O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!      Crack goes the whip, and off we go;     The trees and houses smaller grow;     Last, round the woody turn we swing:     Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!  [Illustration]  [Illustration]     A THOUGHT.         It is very nice to think     The world is full of meat and drink,         With little children saying grace       In every Christian kind of place.  [Illustration]     SINGING        Of speckled eggs the birdie sings     And nests among the trees;             The sailor sings of ropes and things     In ships upon the seas.          The children sing in far Japan,     The children sing in Spain;       The organ with the organ man           Is singing in the rain.  [Illustration]     NORTH-WEST PASSAGE     GOOD NIGHT       When the bright lamp is carried in,     The sunless hours again begin;     O'er all without, in field and lane,     The haunted night returns again.      Now we behold the embers flee     About the firelit hearth; and see     Our faces painted as we pass,     Like pictures, on the window-glass.      Must we to bed indeed? Well then,     Let us arise and go like men,     And face with an undaunted tread     The long black passage up to bed.      Farewell, O brother, sister, sire!     O pleasant party round the fire!     The songs you sing, the tales you tell,     Till far to-morrow, fare ye well!  [Illustration]  [Illustration: _\"The wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp.\"_]     II. SHADOW MARCH       All round the house is the jet-black night;       It stares through the window-pane;     It crawls in the corners, hiding from the light,       And it moves with the moving flame.      Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum,       With the breath of Bogie in my hair,     And all round the candle the crooked shadows come,       And go marching along up the stair.      The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp,       The shadow of the child that goes to bed--     All the wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp,       With the black night overhead.  [Illustration]     III. IN PORT       Last, to the chamber where I lie     My fearful footsteps patter nigh,     And come from out the cold and gloom     Into my warm and cheerful room.      There, safe arrived, we turn about     To keep the coming shadows out,     And close the happy door at last     On all the perils that we past.      Then, when mamma goes by to bed,     She shall come in with tip-toe tread,     And see me lying warm and fast     And in the Land of Nod at last.  [Illustration: _\"In the Land of Nod at last.\"_]     TO MY MOTHER      You, too, my mother, read my rhymes     For love of unforgotten times,     And you may chance to hear once more     The little feet along the floor.
