She jumped up and ran to the door to greet him, and Mrs. Hall went out of the room by the kitchen-door.  Tom was unable to speak a word when he finally came into Polly's presence. She caught hold of his hands and shook them gladly, as she cried: \"Oh, Tom! What do I not owe you after last night!\"  Tom wanted to demand payment, but he knew that would ruin his chances forever, so he held a tight leash on his feelings and smiled wanly. Then he said in an unnatural tone: \"Lucky for us both that I knew how to swim, eh, Polly?\"  Polly was relieved to hear him speak in such a way, but her next act was the outgrowth of spontaneous gratitude. She flung both arms about his neck and being too short to reach his cheek, kissed him on the chin as she would have done had he been John. Tom trembled, but realized at the same time, that Polly's kiss meant nothing. Still he was humbly grateful for even that token of gratitude from the reserved girl.  \"Now tell me, Tom dear, what did the folks say about our sudden elopement?\" Polly laughed as she used the term.  \"Oh, Polly! I'd swim from here to China for you if only it could be an elopement!\"  The girl instantly took alarm, and looked about for Mrs. Hall. But Tom forced a laugh and tried to make her believe he was joking. \"Do you think that any man would do _that_ for a girl?\" he added.  Then he hurried on to say that no one on the yacht had been injured by the collision, but they were hours in reaching their dock. He said that they (Polly and Tom) were not missed at first, and not until conditions had calmed down somewhat, did Eleanor call for Polly. Then it was found that neither Tom nor Polly were to be found.  \"It was Eleanor who remembered seeing us promenade along the side where the rail was detachable, and it was Eleanor who said we must have been thrown out where the steps came up. So the captain was taken to task for having such a careless man on board, and both the man and the captain were discharged.\"  \"Poor man--it wasn't his fault!\" sighed Polly.  \"Well, if you hadn't recovered, I'd have sent him to jail for life, because it was criminal negligence to leave that rail open as it was!\" was Tom's threatening reply.  \"I'm glad there is no cause for such harsh treatment,\" responded Polly.  Tom gazed, with his soul in his eyes, as he breathed fervently: \"You're not half as glad as I am, darling!\"  Polly sprang away at that, and ran to the window, saying: \"Don't you think we might start for the City? Mrs. Hall went to fetch a hat and wrap for me and she ought to be back by this time.\"     CHAPTER IV  A REUNION AND A VISITOR   Never was maiden welcomed so enthusiastically and so fervently, as Polly Brewster, that morning when she stepped from the launch to the sea-wall at Battery Park. Her father and mother vied with each other in embracing and kissing her, while the tears of happiness streamed from their eyes; John and Anne hovered beside them, watching every dear feature of Polly's face. Eleanor stood holding fast to her best friend's skirt, as if that could keep her forever near her.  The members in the \"Delegation of Welcome,\" acted as if they had been imbibing some intoxicating stimulant. Such happy laughter, and vehement demonstrations of joy and love because Polly was with them again, spoke louder than words that they had all thought she was drowned. Tom found that little fuss was made over him in the first exuberant greetings, but he came in for his share after the doctor had concluded his story about the valiant young rescuer.  \"Now, Mr. Brewster, you pay attention to me,\" remarked the physician, when he was ready to depart on the launch: \"You take your daughter home, at once, and put her to bed for the rest of the day, to spare her any nervous reaction. Then, if she is all right tomorrow, you may allow her to receive a caller, or two--no more for the time being, or you will have her break down.\"  Mr. Brewster promised to obey the orders faithfully, and soon afterwards, Polly's friends followed her and her parents to the automobiles which were waiting near the curb of the Park. Tom was surrounded, on both sides and fore and aft, by his family and John and Mr. Dalken, all of whom wished to hear the thrilling story of the rescue again.  \"I'd rather hear how you folks kept afloat after that boat rammed the yacht,\" said he, shunning a subject that still made him shudder.  Mr. Dalken insisted that Tom with his father and mother get into his luxurious limousine and let him drive them home. On the way uptown, Mr. Dalken told the story of their narrow escape from being lost in the Bay after the collision.  \"Immediately after the yacht was rammed and we could collect our senses to comprehend what had happened, and what to do, the old tub of a ferry-boat kept on her course. But there were some worried citizens on board, for they shouted and, finally, the captain stopped his engines and blew the whistles to see if we needed help.  \"Fortunately for us, a river tug was quite close at hand when the accident occurred, and its captain called through a megaphone to say that he would assist us in any way we commanded.  \"Our Captain then ascertained that part of our gear had been shaken out of place, and it would be dangerous for him to try to run the vessel under her own power, and trust our steering gear. So the good old man on the tug took us in tow and landed us, towards dawn, at our dock.  \"The moment we were on land, I rushed to the telephone at the Yacht Club house, and notified Police Headquarters. Ken Evans was an eye-witness to the dive that we feared had cost Polly and you your lives; so we told the Sergeant at the Station just about where you went down.  \"The Bureau at Battery Park was 'phoned but they said the tide was running out at that time, so you both would be carried past Bedloe's Island; if you both were good swimmers there was a slight hope of your being rescued.  \"I tell you, Tom, we were almost frantic with joy and relief when word came from Liberty Island that you both were safe in bed, there, without injury or other hurt, excepting the shock. Polly's mother swooned and we thought she was gone because it was so long before we could revive her.\"  Tom's mother sat holding her boy's hand within her own, and his father smiled at him so often that Tom began to feel fussed. But Mr. Dalken laughed at his apparent self-consciousness.  \"Tom, my boy, grin and bear this ordeal for the time, as you may never in your life, have another experience like it. It shows you what we all think of you, to sit and idolize you in this fashion.\"  They laughed at the banter, but Tom felt more at ease after Mr. Dalken's little speech.  Having arrived at his home, Tom rebelled against being kept quiet that day. \"Goodness' sakes, mother! any one would think I was an invalid. Why, I feel better than I have in months!\" and his happy gayety attested to his spirits. But no one knew that he was joyous because Polly had kissed him that morning. And he was sure that that _something_ he had detected in her eyes, was the awakening of love, instead of the fervent gratitude it really was.  Tom could not settle down to do anything that day, but he called John up on the 'phone several times to ask about Polly. John patiently replied each time, that Polly was fast asleep and would probably remain so, for several hours more, because she required it. When Tom asked if he had better come down that evening and call, John was most emphatic in his refusal.  But the following day, Tom kept telephoning the Brewsters every little while and Anne finally capitulated and invited him to call that evening.  Polly was fully recovered again, with no signs of the shock or soaking she had received; so, when Tom was announced by the telephone girl in the hotel office, she felt no undue nervousness.  \"Anne, you are going to help entertain Tom, aren't you?\" said she, casually patting her hair down neatly.  Anne looked at her sister-in-law with an amused smile. \"If you think you will need a chaperone when such an old friend calls. Tom always seems more like a brother than a young man who might turn out to be a beau, some day.\"  Polly pondered this sentence for a time, then said: \"Well, there's no telling what he may think after that ducking, you know, so it will be more comfortable to have you about.\"  Tom fully expected a warm welcome from Polly, and perhaps, another flash of something akin to love that he thought he had detected in her deep blue eyes, when he met her in the hospital. So he was more than chagrined to find Polly smile friendily upon him as she took his hand in the same manner that she would have taken Mr. Dalken's.  \"I just thought I would bring in a little glow with me, Polly,\" remarked Tom, when he recovered self-possession again. \"A few roses, such as I know you like.\"  He handed a long box to Polly and watched eagerly as she cut the string and opened the lid of the box.  \"Oh, Tom! American Beauties again! How lovely!\" and she buried her face in the fragrant red petals that filled the one end of the box.  Anne held out her hand for the box when Polly went to place it on a chair. \"I'll hand them to mother, Polly, for her to arrange in a jar. The others that came yesterday, can be placed in another glass.\"  \"Oh, did Polly receive other roses?\" asked Tom, trying to appear unconcerned, but flushing as he spoke.  \"Why, didn't you send them to me? There was no card in the box, but you always send American Beauties, Tom,\" exclaimed Polly, in surprise.  Tom laughed sheepishly. \"Well, I did send them, Polly, but I thought I would make you guess who it could have been. I never dreamed you would give me credit for the roses.\"  \"Why shouldn't I? It would have seemed queer if you hadn't sent flowers, when everyone within a thousand miles, sent boxes and bouquets to me, all yesterday and all day today.\"  \"They did! What for?\" asked Tom, wonderingly.  \"What for? Why, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25778"],["title","Polly's Business Venture (#6)"],["body","me! Don't you suppose my friends were _glad_ that I wasn't drowned,\" retorted Polly, in amazement. \"Everyone that ever knew me, sent love and flowers, so I never thought it strange that you sent me some, too.\"  This was a hard slap for Tom, and he winced under the words which denoted that Polly considered him only as one of many friends. Even the roses presented that night, with a little heart-shaped card tied in the center of the group of stems, now seemed useless in his eyes.  But Polly had not removed the roses from the box so she failed to find the heart-shaped card that Tom had spent the whole afternoon in inditing. Anne gave the box to Mrs. Brewster, and when that sensible mother took the roses out, one by one, and found the card, she put it away with the cards that had come with other flowers. She also forgot to mention the card to Polly, so the girl never knew that Tom had written her of his undying love. As Anne replied, for Polly, to all the cards, Tom received the same sort of polite little note as others did, with Polly's name and a \"per A.B.\" signed to it.  Finding Polly so self-possessed that evening, Tom pulled himself together with an effort, and tried to converse on various topics of general interest. Anne eagerly assisted in the conversation, so Polly listened without having much to say.  Tom tried to make Polly talk, too, but without success, so he became silent and left most of the entertaining for Anne to do. But even she found the task of finding subjects to interest two dumb people rather irksome, and she decided on a _coup_.  \"Excuse me for a moment, please, while I see if John has returned with his father.\" So saying, Anne ran from the room.  Polly sat up and watched her go as if her protector had turned traitor. She glanced at Tom in a half doubtful manner as if to ask what he would do now with the chaperone out of the way?  But Anne's absence gave Tom's morbid senses an inspiration that he acted upon without second thought. It was the best thing he could have done with Polly in this baffling mood.  \"I'm returning to Pebbly Pit, in a few days, Polly. I am actually homesick for a sight of the dear old mountains.\"  Polly gasped. \"Oh, no one told me you were leaving us. Jim told me that he thought you might remain here for several months.\"  \"Jim? What does that kid know about my affairs?\" said Tom, impatiently. \"Besides, when did you see Jim?\"  \"Oh, Jim just dropped in for a minute this afternoon.\"  Tom felt the pangs of jealousy because his younger brother had been able to see Polly before she would allow him to call. Then he remembered his rôle to act the part of a platonic brother and friend.  Polly continued: \"I think Jim is a dear boy. He is so fond and proud of you, too. Why, when he was here he sat and talked of nothing else but you and your loyalty to family, friends, and your work.\"  As Polly spoke, Tom felt ashamed of his momentary jealousy of his brother. When she had finished speaking, he laughed and said: \"What a pity Jim sees me through such fine magnifying glasses. The undesirable qualities in my character he never detects.\"  \"I think it is great to have your family think you are all that is wonderful! I think my family regard me as a saint, and I like it, too,\" declared Polly.  \"That's because you are one, Polly dear,\" retorted Tom, and the fervor he expressed in his eyes and voice, caused his companion to gasp.  Before Tom could follow up his sudden declaration and make Polly understand his sentiments for her, she broached another subject of conversation.  \"Tom, what has been accomplished at the mine and at Rainbow Cliffs while I was in Europe?\"  Tom frowned, but he realized that Polly was more sensible than he. He remembered, once more, what Anne had advised, so he choked the despondent sigh and replied instead, with seeming interest:  \"Oh, John and I had another queer bout with some thieves. They were not after the land this time, but they planned to get at the ore and carry off as much of the gold as they could lay hands on. Our old friend, Rattlesnake Mike, caught them red-handed, and now they are serving a term in prison at hard labor.\"  \"Oh, Tom! I never heard a word of this!\" cried Polly, eagerly. \"Do tell me about it.\"     CHAPTER V  THE RAID ON CHOKO'S FIND MINE   \"You remember when we all came East last June to attend John's wedding and see you off for Europe?\" asked Tom.  Polly nodded eagerly but said nothing to interrupt him.  \"Well, we remained longer than we had planned when we left Pebbly Pit. The friends in New York were so eager to entertain us before we went back home, that the days passed swiftly before we realized we had stayed on ten days longer than we should have done at that time.  \"Now to go back to the time when those two rascals tried to jump your claim, the time your father and Mike guided the party when you-all climbed the Indian Trail to Grizzly Slide.  \"It seems that crafty clerk who had copied the rough map of the claim you staked on Flat Top and filed in Oak Creek, never gave up hope of some day getting his hands on enough of that gold to help him get away and live comfortably, ever after, on the proceeds.  \"When he learned that everyone of the family at Pebbly Pit, would be East for a few weeks, and the mine would be left in charge of Mike and the other employees, he immediately called a few cut-throats together and laid his plans accordingly.  \"After the discovery of his perfidy in copying the claim papers and then trying to jump the staked claim, he had been discharged from the office in Oak Creek and, thereafter, no one respectable would employ him. So he hung about the saloon and spent his time in gambling with the miners from Up-Crest, back of Oak Creek station. He found willing confederates in this group of Slavs who hailed the invitation to steal enough gold to enable them to go back to Europe and pose as rich men.  \"The whole plot had been kept unusually secret for that species of foreigner, so no one at Oak Creek knew of the proposed raid. But Mike rode into Oak Creek the morning before the night these rascals planned to act, and with his unusual gift of intuition, he felt that something was working quietly in the minds of the evil-looking men he found whispering over a small table in one corner of the saloon.  \"Mike hung around for several hours to try and learn if any plot was hatching against Rainbow Cliffs while the owners were absent; or perhaps these men planned a rush on the mine while he and but few men were on guard. But nothing could be discovered. Feeling assured because of the sly and malicious expressions of the men at the table when they glanced at Mike, as he sat in another corner and pretended to doze, that Hank had some move under way to trouble him and his assistants, made the Indian use splendid judgment and action that day.  \"He borrowed the Sheriff's thoroughbred bloodhound, and asked for a few extra men to accompany him to the cave and stay there until the owners returned, promising them better wages than they could earn at any work in Oak Creek, or on the ranches nearby. To allay suspicion he rode out of town, alone, but he had agreed to wait at Pine Tree Blaze for the extra men.  \"The men rode away from town each at a different time, to avoid talk or notice by the loungers at the saloon, and all met at the rendezvous that afternoon. Mike then led the way up the steep trail, and by dark they were in camp.  \"This was the second day after we left Pebbly Pit. Mike had warned Jeb of his suspicions, too, and that wary little man had instantly taken steps to protect the Cliffs, by ordering all hands working there to keep away from Oak Creek until the Boss got home. He said that unusual care must be used for a time, to watch during the nights, and keep trespassers out during the day, for fear of raiders.  \"The first night in camp on the mountains, Mike never rested a minute, but moved silently from one place to another, with senses keyed for some sign of the rascals. However, that first night passed quietly away. His extra men spent the evening in smoking and playing cards, then they rolled up in their blankets and snored peacefully the night through.  \"The next day Mike smiled to himself when the men laughed at his suspicions. They were so far from any settlement and the mountains were so great and silent, that it gave them confidence in the peace and good will with all men.  \"The second night the men were again playing cards near the camp-fire. Mike sat on the ledge in front of the cave with the hound stretched out on a slab of rock at his feet. The giant wooden flume could be faintly discerned, through the smoke of the fire and from the pipes of the men, not twenty feet away from the engines that worked it.  \"Suddenly the hound lifted his head and pointed his ears. Mike leaned forward with face turned towards the flume, listening. Then he laid his pipe down on the rock and crawled away upon his hands and knees, followed closely by the hound.  \"Do you remember the giant flume we planned to carry off the water of the river that flowed underground; the one into which Nolla and you dropped the torch the day you found the cave?\"  Polly silently signified that she remembered, and Tom continued: \"Well, we used that flume during the work of mining and washing trash from the ore, but at night, when there was no need for the water to pour through it, we turned the current down the other way on the opposite side of the mountain.  \"Mike crept silently across the ledge and peered far down into the black chasm below, to ascertain if the suspicious sounds came from that pit. But the dog crawled noiselessly across the ledge to the flume and there he stood with tense nerves. His ears were erect and his tail was standing out straight behind him, as he stood and glared at the wooden flume.  \"As the dog was so well-trained, Mike did not doubt his instinct, but crept over to his side and there waited and listened.  \"Had "]]]
