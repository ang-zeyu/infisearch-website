They were soon seated about the little table, where they found great slabs of cheese set out on a plate. Loaves of hard, black bread were placed upon the table by the steward, who withdrew to presently reappear bearing a great pot of steaming coffee. Von Kluck refreshed himself with a glass of his beloved \"schnapps,\" then fell to heartily upon the bread and cheese, motioning to the boys to do likewise.  With considerable relish the lads made a good lunch off the bread and cheese and coffee. Hard and dark, but possessing considerable nutriment, the bread was not at all unpleasant to the taste. It had been plentifully seasoned with small seeds, which lent an appetizing flavor.  Shortly after finishing their lunch the boys again gained the deck, to find the mate actively driving the men in their various duties. The wind still came out of the northwest with a stinging snap. Ned declared that he could feel rain approaching.  \"Feels to me more like snow!\" stated Jimmie, sniffing to windward. \"We'll be getting outside the Friesian Islands soon and then we'll find out what's coming. We're somewhat protected here.\"  \"How long will it be before we pass into the North Sea, Captain von Kluck?\" asked Ned of the captain, who approached.  \"Vhe might make id by morning,\" stated the captain. \"I vish I make a swift voyage dis time. If Mackinter gets news to England ahead of me, maybe he makes droubles by das Lena Knobloch.\"  \"So you're carrying all the canvas you dare?\" asked Harry.  \"Chust now, yes! Maybe vhen vhe come about und head up into der vindt vhe get oop der tops'ls und put oop uuder vun chib. I reach off a goot vays und leaf Amsterdam und der vest coast of der Zuider Zee, den I make vun straight reach und run ouid by Eijerlandsche Gut.\"  \"Then I'm going below to try for a little sleep!\" declared Jimmie. \"I'm not needed on deck and this wind is too cold for comfort!\"  \"I'll go with you and keep you company,\" volunteered Jack.  \"We'll all go,\" added Harry. \"Come on, Ned.\"  Clinging to hand rails the lads scrambled below. The deck leaned at an angle that made walking almost impossible. Every plunge sent shivers through the little vessel. Tons of water broke over the bows and dashed along the planks to rush hissing through the scuppers.  In the cabin a lamp swung wildly from a beam overhead, throwing weird, dancing shadows on the bulkheads. Here the noises of the wind were hushed. Only a moaning from the taut rigging reached the ears of the four lads. But the cabin was full of eerie sounds of creaking timbers and straining planks. For some time the boys lay on lockers listening to the confusion of noises. Presently they fell asleep.  They were wakened by the sound of tramping feet on deck, and knew that some maneuver was about to be executed. Coils of rigging were flung on deck. The stentorian voice of the mate bawled out orders.  \"Stand by to come about!\" roared you Kluck over their heads.     CHAPTER VII  A WARNING FROM THE SEA   Springing from their resting places the four boys staggered up the unsteady companionway. As they gained the deck they were assailed by terrific gusts of wind carrying sleet and snow. During their stay below the weather had turned colder, bringing fitful dashes of sleet out of the north. The schooner presently rode easier.  A hoarse order from forward was followed by a clanking of the cable through the hawse pipes. The sails rattled with great slapping noises as the Lena Knobloch rode to her anchor.  Men were instantly aloft securing the lighter topsails. With a run the foresail and mainsail were lowered and furled. The staysail and jib had but a moment before been lowered as the schooner was headed into the wind. Under bare poles they rode on gentler swells.  \"Where are we?\" asked Harry, throwing up an arm to protect his face. \"Have we reached England yet? Where is the captain?\"  \"Vhell, how do you like id now?\" roared the voice of von Kluck almost at Harry's elbow. \"Vhat you tink of dis for some shtorm?\"  \"This is fierce!\" replied the lad, bracing himself against the wind. \"Where are we now, Captain von Kluck?\"  \"Under der lee of one of der Friesian Islands,\" replied the captain. \"I see some rocks aheadt und dere is a big shteamer in drouble oop to vindvard. I hope she makes id into safety, bud I don'd know!\"  Shaking his head doubtfully the captain went away forward. Presently he returned, still shaking his head. The crew except the captain and the mate were gathered forward round the capstan.  \"Dere's rocks dere--lots of dem!\" announced von Kluck. \"Dot wessel looks like she's lost her rutter, und if she gets off dem rocks dot captain needs a medal. I tink he's a goner, sure!\"  It did, indeed, appear as if von Kluck was right. A big cargo steamer, now dimly discernible to the boys, was rolling in the trough of a heavy sea, urged on by a vicious wind from the northwest. Her range lights showed clearly at the mast heads. A gleam of red indicated that the vessel was showing her port side. With every roll great masses of water boarded the weather rail, sweeping the decks of every movable object.  \"Look!\" cried the mate, excitedly pointing toward the steamer.  There was no need of explanation. A great mass of rock directly in the path upon which the steamer was drifting sent gigantic columns of water into the air with every wave. Although the eastern sky showed a tinge of gray the blackness upon the water was intense. It was lightened momentarily by the white smother of spray and foam cast upward as wave after wave broke upon the black and threatening menace lying immediately before the apparently doomed vessel.  \"Py golly, he's all right!\" yelled von Kluck in a moment. \"He's lost dot rutter und he's backing on his enchines! He'll make id!\"  Surely enough the steamer's captain was executing the very maneuver at which von Kluck had guessed. By backing on his engines he succeeded in drawing the vessel so far to one side of the dangerous rock that it was passed. Only a margin extremely narrow intervened.  But the danger had not passed. Another rock threatened to tear to pieces the all but helpless vessel. With straining eyes and beating hearts the lads watched anxiously as this danger was also cleared.  They clung to the weather shrouds in spite of the whip-like sting of sleet and spray, watching the struggle against wind, wave and rock.  At length the vessel won through the dangerous places. It was now so close that the boys could make out the details of the rigging. Ned procured a pair of binoculars and spelled out the name.  \"That steamer is the Anne of Melbourne,\" he announced. \"I wonder if it isn't an Australian vessel. They have had a hard time of it.\"  \"She's close to us now,\" cried Harry. \"I wonder what they'll do.\"  \"If they're wise they'll let go an anchor and ride it out,\" answered Jimmie. \"If I had sense enough to bring a vessel through a tight place like that I'd get a hook overboard as soon as I could.\"  \"That's just what they are doing!\" announced Ned. \"There's a group of men at the forward end preparing to get the anchor over.\"  Directly the boys heard the rattle of the cable in the steamer's hawse pipes, followed instantly by a great splash at the bow that told as plainly as words that the ground tackle was out.  Still feeling the heave of waves surging around the head of the island the steamer slowly swung to her cable. The range lights shifted their position. The red side light disappeared.  \"She's safe now!\" cried Ned, in a tone of relief. \"I'm glad they made it all right. I wonder how they got crippled.\"  \"Let me take the glasses a minute, Ned,\" requested Harry.  \"Can you see what's the matter with her?\" queried Jimmie.  \"Yes,\" replied the boy, with the glasses to his eye. \"Von Kluck was right. It looks as if the rudder stock is twisted and bent badly out of shape. As the stern lifts I can see the blades of the propeller all right, but the rudder seems to be missing.\"  \"The Anne of Melbourne,\" mused Ned. \"I wonder now what that vessel is doing away off up here. If they had a cargo destined for an English port they should have been much farther south.\"  \"You don't suppose the captain lost his reckoning and got this far out of his course, do you?\" suggested Jimmie.  \"I don't know,\" replied Ned. Then turning to Captain von Kluck the lad continued: \"Captain, what do you think about it?\"  \"Mit der var doing so many tings, I don'd know what to tink!\"  \"I can see men moving about on deck now, apparently clearing up the recent damage,\" stated Harry. \"And I see a Boy Scout, too!\"  \"No!\" objected Jimmie. \"Don't say that! I don't want any more Boy Scouts mixed up in this! It isn't fair!\"  \"Just the same, he's there!\" laughed Harry.  \"Well, then,\" stated Jimmie, with a sigh of resignation, \"we are in for another siege of it. I never knew it to fail! Just as quickly as we get going somewhere and a Boy Scout shows up there's trouble ahead and lots of it! Why can't they stay home?\"  \"Now, Jimmie,\" cautioned Ned, \"you know we've never in all our adventures found a Boy Scout that really brought us ill luck. Sometimes they've caused us a lot of trouble, but usually they help!\"  \"That's true, too, but I wish we could get home to the little old U. S. A. without mixing up in this 'U-13' business with the Boy Scouts!\"  \"Maybe it'll come out all right after all,\" soothed Ned.  \"Maybe,\" reluctantly agreed Jimmie. \"I say, Harry,\" he continued, \"let me take those glasses. I want to see what that fellow's like.\"  Long and eagerly the lad peered through the binoculars.  \"I see him!\" he cried, presently. \"He's going up the foreshrouds! I'll bet he's working his passage on that steamer!\"  \"What's he doing on the foreshrouds?\" asked Ned.  \"It looks as if something had fouled at the fore top,\" replied Jimmie. \"He's going up to clear it, I guess. Oh, look!\" the boy"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25798"],["title","Boy Scouts in the North Sea; Or, The Mystery of a Sub (#8)"],["body","houted. \"He's falling! He's broken one of the ratlines and is falling!\"  \"I see him!\" cried Ned. \"I can see him!\"  \"Oh, good!\" exclaimed Jimmie, the next moment. \"He hit the shrouds and the steamer rolled at the right minute, throwing him clear of the deck. See that splash in the water?\"  \"I see it!\" answered the others, together.  \"Are they trying to help him?\" asked Harry.  \"Yes, they are,\" stated Jimmie. \"They've thrown him a ring buoy!\"  \"Can you see him now?\" asked Ned.  \"Yes, and he's swimming. There must be a current in here that's dragging him away from the steamer. The buoy fell short and he's swimming directly away from the steamer. He's coming towards us!\"  Intently the lad watched the one in the water. He swam a good stroke resting easily, even though somewhat impeded by his clothing.  Now and again as the crest of a wave approached the swimmer his head was submerged, only to reappear again in the yeasty froth following the racing monster. Eagerly his progress was noted by all on board the schooner. They were at a loss to understand why he had left his own vessel to swim toward a strange craft.  Presently, however, as he approached the Lena Knobloch the lad's strokes became more feeble. He was evidently tiring rapidly.  \"Captain, what do you say to getting a boat over?\" asked Ned.  \"Vhait!\" grunted von Kluck. \"Id's lots of vork to do id!\"  \"But the lad may need help!\" urged Ned, eagerly.  \"Vhell, if he needs id, I put him ofer. Nod before!\"  Jimmie ran forward into the very eyes of the schooner. In his hands he grasped a ring buoy, to which was attached a goodly length of line. This he coiled ready to heave the buoy to the one in the water as soon as he should come within reach.  Just as Jimmie was measuring with his eye the distance separating the swimmer from his goal and preparing for a mighty throw of the buoy he noted that the other's stroke was fast weakening.  With a jerk the Wolf unfastened and kicked loose a shoe. In an instant the other followed. A rapid movement loosened his jacket. A backward twist of his shoulders helped him slip from the garment.  One look over the rail showed that the swimmer was losing control of his muscles. Both hands went up into the air only to disappear beneath the crest of an oncoming wave. The boy stayed under.  \"Stand by to get me, boys!\" shouted Jimmie.  A splash told that he had gone overboard. His companions crowded eagerly to the rail, watching for his reappearance. In a moment they were relieved to see his red head come up close to the spot where the other had sunk. Emptying his lungs of the pent up air with a loud \"Whoosh!\" the boy instantly refilled them to plunge again under water.  To the intense satisfaction of those on board the schooner he again came quickly to the surface, this time dragging by the hair the boy to whose rescue he had gone. Swimming on his back, using but one hand, Jimmie slowly brought the other lad to a position where he could reach the buoy flung to him by Ned's strong arm.  Harry had already made a bowline in a bight at the end of a line. This he passed over the side to Jimmie, who succeeded without difficulty in getting the loop over the shoulders of the rescued lad.  Soon both were on deck, where they received the attentions of all hands. Captain von Kluck insisted upon giving the newcomer a draught of \"schnapps\" to assist in the reviving process. As the fiery liquor burned its way down his throat the lad coughed violently.  Choking and spitting the lad clawed at his burning mouth and throat. Evidently he thought the cure worse than the disease.  \"Let's get into the cabin,\" suggested Jimmie. \"I'm freezing!\"  \"Sure enough!\" cried Ned. \"How thoughtless of us! Captain,\" he added, \"can you have the steward bring us some coffee?\"  Roaring for the steward to perform this service, the captain picked up the nearly drowned lad in his strong arms. He deposited the boy on a locker in the cabin, then stood aside to permit his passengers to administer such assistance as they might.  Ned stepped forward to begin operations. With a cry he bent over the boy. Wonderingly the others crowded forward.  \"Frank!\" cried Ned, seizing the lad by the shoulders. \"Frank! Speak to me! Frank, how did you get here?\"  \"Who is it?\" asked Jimmie, elbowing his way into the group to a position where he could see the recumbent figure. \"Why,\" continued the boy in a tone of amazement, \"if it ain't old Frank Shaw of New York!\"  A cup of steaming coffee at this moment brought by the steward was offered to the newcomer, who drank eagerly. He glanced about the group with a faint smile in answer to their puzzled looks.  \"Look out for the 'U-13', boys!\" he said.     CHAPTER VIII  MORE ABOUT THE \"U-13\"   \"Frank Shaw!\" cried Jimmie, crowding close to the lad lying on the locker. \"What's that you're saying about the 'U-13'?\"  \"I say 'Look out for it,' that's all!\"  \"No, it isn't all!\" protested the boy. \"Take another drink of this coffee and then brace up and tell us what you know! How did you get here and what and who and where and why is this 'U-13'?\"  Frank smiled as he struggled to a sitting posture.  \"If you'll rub the cramp out of that leg, boys, I'll 'fess up' everything,\" he began. \"That leg feels as if some one were trying to pull some teeth out of it by the roots. A cramp is fierce.\"  Two lads began massaging the offending member.  \"If I'd known it was you swimming to us, I'd have lowered a boat myself and come to your assistance!\" declared Jimmie.  \"And if I'd known you were on board this schooner,\" replied Frank, \"I'd have left that ship long before I did!\"  \"Why, what's the matter on that ship, Frank?\" asked Ned.  \"Oh, nothing, only it's one of these 'work-houses' just exactly like we have read of. The captain is a hard nut and the mates are both of the 'bucko' type. There isn't a man aboard who hasn't got a mark from one or the other of the mates. They're a tough crowd!\"  \"I'll bet you didn't just fall overboard, then!\" shrewdly guessed Jimmie. \"You missed your footing purposely! You know you did!\"  \"How do you know?\" grinned Frank, nursing his cramped leg.  \"I was watching through the binoculars,\" answered Jimmie. \"But go ahead and tell us something. We're dying from curiosity!\"  \"Well,\" began Frank, \"you know I wasn't quite satisfied to be left behind when you four lads left in chase of the fellow who had stolen the Panama plans. I wanted to go along in the Grey Eagle.\"  \"We know that, and we're sorry we didn't take you!\" cried Ned.  \"I went to see Mr. Bosworth about following you,\" continued young Shaw. \"He was opposed to that plan, but you know I usually get my own way somehow. I put together a kit and started out. I had little difficulty in securing passage on a ship loaded with miscellaneous cargo for England. The vessel was a British tramp--a 'bucko' ship.  \"We got close to Land's End after a rather uneventful voyage across the Atlantic. I was dreaming of getting ashore in a short time and then hiking across the channel into France to hunt you up.  \"One fine morning we were all startled to hear a hail from the lookout informing the deck that a submarine was approaching. We hove to at the command of the submarine people. They commanded our captain to get his crew into the boats as quickly as possible, for in five minutes they intended torpedoing the ship. They wouldn't take 'No' for an answer.\"  \"That was going some, I must say!\" put in Jimmie.  \"You needn't be told, of course,\" went on Frank, \"that we lost little time making preparations. One of the sailors disputed my right to take my kit into the small boat. I objected and he cracked me on the jaw. When I recovered I was alone on the vessel. The boats were at some little distance away, with the crew pulling like racers.  \"For a moment I was quite desperate, not knowing how to escape. I thought of trying to signal the submarine, but could see the vessel just launching a torpedo. Seemingly the whole after end of the ship was shattered by the explosion. As soon as I could I tried to signal the enemy, but they were just turning about to leave the spot.  \"Maybe I didn't hustle about some. The ship was already filling rapidly. The stern was settling fast. All the boats were gone. I could see nothing to serve as a float. Desperately I seized a capstan bar and knocked the wedges and battens off a hatch cover. Then I got a small piece of line. I passed it through a ring bolt and made fast. I figured that when the ship went down the cover would float free for a raft on which I could keep up. Before I was fully ready the compressed air blew the cover off with a 'boom'. It landed close to the rail.  \"Just as the hull took a last slant I jumped overboard. After swimming quite a distance away I saw the ship go down. I turned back. There was my hatch cover floating just as I expected.\"  Here Frank paused to extend his hand for another cup of coffee.  \"You're the wise little Scout!\" declared Jimmie, admiringly.  \"Sure!\" agreed Frank. \"Then,\" he continued, \"I floated around for the rest of the day on that hatch cover. Toward evening I saw a smoke off to the southwest. It was just out of the glare of the sun. When it got nearer I knew it was a steamer bound for England or some nearby place. It was the Anne of Melbourne. So here I am!\"  \"But what about this 'U-13'?\" inquired Harry, eagerly.  \"Oh, yes, I nearly forgot,\" said Frank. \"The submarine that torpedoed the ship was marked 'U-13' on the side!\"  \"They've been doing a lot of that, according to the newspapers!\" stated Ned. \"But why do you warn us to look out for her?\" he asked.  \"When I told the captain of the Anne of my experience,\" went on Frank, \"he decided to head north, intending to go to the westward of Ireland, around between Scotland and the Shetland Island into the North Sea, in the hopes of dodging the submarine, which seemed to be working the waters of the English Channel. Yesterday morning we were hailed by a submarine. I could see that it was the"]]]
