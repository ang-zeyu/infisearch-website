Her voice sounded oddly distorted coming over the speaker in the helmet. \"You're supposed to have blown your wig or something. Did you?\"  \"No. Of course not.\"  \"I didn't think so.\" She unscrewed her helmet quickly. \"Listen, Peter, there's something funny going on aboard this ship.\"  \"I've known that a long time,\" he said.  \"I think Boggs and those other two are trying to frame you,\" she said, her voice low. \"Do you know of anyone aboard named Masters?\"  \"Masters?\" Wayne repeated. \"Not that I know of--why?\"  \"Well, I overheard Boggs talking to one of the other men. I didn't hear very clearly, but it sounded as though he said: 'We've got to get Moore out and turn him over to Masters.' Bill Moore is one of my computermen--tall, skinny fellow.\"  Wayne nodded, frowning. \"Yeah, but who is Masters? This is the queerest thing I ever heard of.\"  Footsteps sounded in the corridor outside.  \"Better put your helmet on,\" Wayne advised. \"Whoever's coming might not like to see you this way.\"  Quickly, she slipped the helmet back on. \"I don't know what's going on,\" she said. \"But I intend to find out.\"         *       *       *       *       *  One of the medics entered the cell without knocking and came up to Sherri. \"You'll have to go now, Lieutenant,\" he said. \"We're going to perform some tests on the captain now.\"  Sherri bristled. \"Tests? What kind of tests?\"  \"Nothing very serious,\" the medic said. \"Just a routine checkup to clarify some points we're interested in.\"  \"All right,\" Sherri said. \"You won't find anything the matter with him.\" She left.  \"Come with me, Captain,\" said the medic politely. He unlocked the cell door and, equally politely, drew a needle-beam pistol. \"Don't try anything, please, sir. I have my orders.\"  Silently, Wayne followed the medic into the lab. Several other medics were standing around watching him, with Stevelman, the head man, in the back.  \"Over this way, Captain,\" Stevelman called.  There was a box sitting on a table in the middle of the room. It was full of sand.  \"Give me your hand, please, Captain,\" the medic said tonelessly.  In a sudden flash of insight, Wayne realized what was in the box. He thought fast but moved slowly. He held out his hand, but just as the medic took it, he twisted suddenly away.  His hand flashed out and grasped the other's wrist in a steely grip. The medic's fingers tightened on the needle-beam, and managed to pull the trigger. A bright beam flared briefly against the lab's plastalloy floor, doing nothing but scorching it slightly. Wayne's other hand balled into a fist and came up hard against the medic's jaw.  He grabbed the needle-beam pistol from the collapsing man's limp hand and had the other three men covered before the slugged medic had finished sagging to the floor.  \"All of you! Raise your hands!\"  They paid no attention to him. Instead of standing where they were, they began to move toward him. Wayne swore and, with a quick flip of his thumb, turned the beam down to low power and pulled the trigger three times in quick succession.  The three men fell as though they'd been pole-axed, knocked out by the low-power beam.  \"The whole ship's gone crazy,\" he murmured softly, looking at the three men slumped together on the lab floor. \"Stark, staring, raving nuts.\"  He took one step and someone jumped him from behind. The needle-beam pistol spun from his hand and slithered across the floor as Wayne fell under the impact of the heavy body. Apparently the whole Medical Corps was out to knock him down today.  He twisted rapidly as an arm encircled his neck, and rammed an elbow into the newcomer's midsection. Then he jerked his head back, smashing the back of his skull into his opponent's nose.  The hold around his neck weakened, and Wayne tore himself loose from the other's grasp. He jumped to his feet, but the other man was a long way from being unconscious. A stinging right smashed into Wayne's mouth, and he felt the taste of blood. Hastily he wiped the trickle away with the back of his hand.  With his nose pouring blood, Wayne's antagonist charged in. His eyes burned with the strange flame that had been gleaming in Boggs's face out on the desert in the valley. He ploughed into Wayne's stomach with a savage blow that rocked Wayne back.  He grunted and drove back with a flurry of blows. The other aimed a wild blow at Wayne's head; Wayne seized the wrist as the arm flew past his ear, and twisted, hard. The medic flipped through the air and came to rest against the wall with a brief crunching impact. He moaned and then lapsed into silence.         *       *       *       *       *  Quickly, Wayne grabbed the gun off the floor and planted his back to the wall, looking around for new antagonists. But there was evidently no one left who cared to tangle with him, and the four medics strewn out on the floor didn't seem to have much fight left in them.  Wayne crossed the room in a couple of strides and bolted the door. Then he walked over to the box of sand. If it contained what he suspected--  He stepped over to the lab bench and picked out a long steel support rod from the equipment drawer. He placed the rod gently against the sand, and pushed downward, hard. There was a tinny scream, and a six-inch needle shot up instantly through the surface.  \"Just what I thought,\" Wayne murmured. \"Can you talk, you nasty little brute?\" He prodded into the sand--more viciously this time. There was a flurry of sand, and the football-shaped thing came to the surface, clashing its teeth and screaming shrilly.  Wayne cursed. Then he turned the needle gun back up to full power and calmly burned the thing to a crisp. An odor of singed flesh drifted up from the ashes on the sand.         *       *       *       *       *  He stooped and fumbled in Stevelman's pocket, pulling out a ring of keys.  \"They better be the right ones,\" he told the unconscious medic. Holstering the needle gun, he walked over to the medical stores cabinet, hoping that the things he needed would be inside. He knew exactly what he was facing now, and what he would have to do.  He checked over the labels, peering through the neatly-arranged racks for the substance he was searching for.  Finally he picked a large plastine container filled with a white, crystalline powder. Then he selected a couple of bottles filled with a clear, faintly yellow liquid, and took a hypodermic gun from the rack. He relocked the cabinet.  Suddenly a knock sounded. He stiffened, sucked in his breath, and turned to face the door.  \"Who's there?\" he asked cautiously, trying to counterfeit Stevelman's voice.  \"Harrenburg,\" said a rumbling voice. \"I'm on guard duty. Heard some noise coming from in there a while back, and thought I'd look in. Everything all right, Dr. Stevelman? I mean--\"  \"Everything's fine, Harrenburg,\" Wayne said, imitating the medic's thin, dry voice. \"We're running some tests on Captain Wayne. They're pretty complicated affairs, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't interrupt again.\"  \"Sure, sir,\" the guard said. \"Just a routine check, sir. Colonel Petersen's orders. Sorry if I've caused any trouble, sir.\"  \"That's all right,\" Wayne said. \"Just go away and let us continue, will you?\"  There was the sound of the guard's footsteps retreating down the corridor. Wayne counted to ten and turned back to the things he had taken from the cabinet.  The bottles of liquid and the hypo gun went into his belt pouch. He tucked the big bottle of white powder under his left arm and cautiously unbolted and opened the door. There was no sign of anyone in the corridor. _Good_, he thought. It was a lucky thing Harrenburg had blundered along just then, and not two minutes later.  He stepped outside the Medic Section and locked the door behind him with the key he'd taken from Stevelman. After turning the needle gun back to low power again in order to keep from killing anyone, he started on tiptoe toward the stairway that led into the bowels of the ship.  After about ten paces, he saw a shadow on the stairway, and cowered in a dark recess while two crewmen passed, talking volubly. Once they were gone, he came out and continued on his way.  It took quite a while to get where he was going, since it involved hiding and ducking two or three more times along the way, but he finally reached the big compartment where the water repurifiers were. He climbed up the ladder to the top of the reserve tank, opened the hatch, and emptied the contents of the jar into the ship's water supply.  \"That ought to do it,\" he said to himself. Smiling, he carefully smashed the jar and dropped the fragments down the waste chute. He surveyed his handiwork for a moment, then turned and headed back.  He hadn't been seen going down, and he didn't want to be seen going out. If anyone even suspected that he had tampered with the water supply, all they would have to do would be to run the water through the purifiers. That would undo everything Wayne had been carefully preparing.         *       *       *       *       *  He made his way safely back up to the main deck and headed through the quiet ship toward the airlock. He wasn't so lucky this time; a guard saw him.  \"Where you goin', Captain?\" the guard demanded, starting to lift his gun. \"Seems to me you ought to be in the brig, and--\"  Wayne made no reply. He brought his gun up in a rapid motion and beamed the man down. The guard toppled, a hurt expression on his face.  Wayne raced to the airlock. He didn't bother with a spacesuit--not _now_, when he knew that the air was perfectly harmless outside. He opened the inner door, closed it, and opened the outer door.  Then, grinning gleefully, he pressed the button that would start the pumping cycle. The outer door started to close automatically, and Wayne just barely managed to get outside and onto the ladder before it clanged shut. As soon as the great hatch had sealed itself,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25713"],["title","The Judas Valley (#5)"],["body"," the pumps started exhausting the air from the airlock. No one could open the doors until the pumping cycle was over.  He climbed down the ladder and began walking over toward the western wall. He would have to keep away from the ship for a while, and the rocks were as good a place as any to hide out.         *       *       *       *       *  It was dark. Fomalhaut had set, leaving the moonless planet in utter blackness, broken only by the cold gleam of the stars. The lights streaming from the portholes of the _Lord Nelson_ gave a small degree of illumination to the valley.  The valley. It was spread out before him, calm and peaceful, rippling dunes of sand curling out toward the mountains. The valley, he knew, was a betrayer--calm and quiet above, alive with an army of hideous vermin a few feet below its surface.  He started to walk, and moistened his lips. He knew he was going to get awfully thirsty in the next few hours, but there was not the slightest help for it. There hadn't been any way to carry water from the ship.  \"I can wait,\" he told himself. He stared back at the circular bulk of the _Lord Nelson_ behind him, and his fingers trembled a little. He had known, when he joined the Corps, that space was full of traps like this one--but this was the first time he had actually experienced anything like this. It was foul.  Something slammed into his boot sole, and this time Wayne knew what it was.  \"Persistent, aren't you!\" He jerked his foot up. This monster hadn't stuck as the other one had, but he saw the tip of the needle-beak thrashing around wildly in the loose sand. Wayne thumbed the gun up to full power, and there was a piercing shriek as the gun burned into the sand. There was a sharp shrill sound, and the odor of something burning. He spat.  The little beasts must be all over the floor of the valley! Scurrying frantically, like blood-red giant crabs, sidling up and down beneath the valley, searching upward for things to strike at. How they must hate his metamagnetic boots, he thought!  He kept on walking, expecting to feel the impact of another thrust momentarily, but he was not molested again. _They must be getting wise_, he thought. _They know they can't get through my boots, and so they're leaving me alone. That way they don't call attention to themselves._  A new, more chilling question struck him:  _Just how smart are they?_  He had made it to the wall and was climbing up the treacherous slope when the airlock door opened, and someone stood outlined in the bright circle of light that cut into the inky blackness. An amplified voice filled the valley and ricocheted back off the walls of the mountains, casting eerie echoes down on the lone man on the desert.  \"CAPTAIN WAYNE! THIS IS COLONEL PETERSEN SPEAKING. DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE A SICK MAN? YOU MAY DIE OUT THERE. COME BACK. THAT'S AN ORDER, CAPTAIN. REPEAT: COME BACK. THAT'S AN ORDER!\"  \"I'm afraid an order from you just doesn't hold much weight for me right now, Colonel,\" Wayne said quietly, to himself. Silently he went on climbing the escarpment, digging into the rough rock.  He kept on climbing until he found the niche for which he had been heading. He dragged himself in and sat down, as comfortably as possible. He began to wait.         *       *       *       *       *  Dawn came in less than three hours, as Fomalhaut burst up over the horizon and exploded in radiance over the valley. With dawn came a patrol of men, slinking surreptitiously across the valley, probably with orders to bring him in. Wayne was ensconced comfortably in his little rock niche, hidden from the men in the valley below, but with a perfect view of everything that went on. The wind whistled around the cliffs, ceaselessly moaning a tuneless song. He felt like standing up and shouting wildly, \"Here I am! Here I am!\" but he repressed the perverse urge.  The patrol group stood in a small clump in the valley below, seemingly waiting for something. Moments passed, and then it became apparent what that something was. Hollingwood, the metallurgist, appeared, dragging with him the detector. They were going to look for Captain Wayne with it, just as they had searched out the double-nucleus beryllium.  Wayne frowned. It was a possibility he hadn't thought about. They could easily detect the metal in his boots! And he didn't dare take them off; he'd never make it back across that hellish stretch of sand without them. He glanced uneasily at his watch. _How much longer do I have to keep evading them?_ he wondered. It was a wearing task.  It looked as though it would be much too long.  The muzzle of the detector began to swing back and forth slowly and precisely, covering the valley inch by inch. He heard their whispered consultations drifting up from below, though he couldn't make out what they were saying.         *       *       *       *       *  They finished with the valley, evidently concluding he wasn't there, and started searching the walls. Wayne decided it was time to get out while the getting was good. He crawled slowly out of the niche and wriggled along the escarpment, heading south, keeping low so the men in the valley wouldn't see him.  Unfortunately, he couldn't see them either. He kept moving, hoping they wouldn't spot him with the detector. He wished he had the metamagnetic hand grapples with him. For one thing, the sharp rock outcroppings sliced his hands like so much meat. For another, he could have dropped the grapples somewhere as a decoy.  _Oh, well, you can't think of everything_, Wayne told himself. He glanced at his watch. How long was it going to take?  He heard the scrape of boot leather on a rock somewhere ahead of him. He glanced up sharply, seeing nothing, and scowled. They had spotted him.  They were laying a trap.  Cautiously, he climbed over a huge boulder, making no sound. There was one man standing behind it, waiting, apparently, for Wayne to step around into view. He peered down, trying to see who it was. It seemed to be Hollingwood, the dignified, austere metallurgist.  Wayne smiled grimly, picked up a heavy rock, and dropped it straight down, square on the man's helmet. The plexalloy rang like a bell through the clear early-morning air, and the man dropped to his knees, dazed by the shock.         *       *       *       *       *  Knowing he had just a moment to finish the job, Wayne pushed off against the side of the rock and plummeted down, landing neatly on the metallurgist's shoulders. The man reeled and fell flat. Wayne spun him over and delivered a hard punch to the solar plexus. \"Sorry, Dave,\" he said softly. The metallurgist gasped and curled up in a tight ball. Wayne stood up. It was brutal, but it was the only place you could hit a man wearing a space helmet.  _One down_, Wayne thought. _Fifty-eight to go._ He was alone against the crew--and, for all he knew, against all fifty-nine of them.  Hollingwood groaned and stretched. Wayne bent and, for good measure, took off the man's helmet and tapped him none too gently on the skull.  There was the sound of footsteps, the harsh _chitch-chitch_ of feet against the rock. \"He's up that way,\" he heard a deep voice boom.  That meant the others had heard the rock hitting Hollingwood's plexalloy helmet. They were coming toward him.  Wayne sprang back defensively and glanced around. He hoped there were only five of them, that the rule of six was still being maintained. Otherwise things could become really complicated, as they hunted him relentlessly through the twisted gulleys.  He hated to have to knock out too many of the men; it just meant more trouble later. Still, there was no help for it, if he wanted there to be any later. He thought of the bleached bones of the crew of the _Mavis_, and shuddered.  It was something of an advantage not to be wearing a helmet. Even with the best of acoustical systems, hearing inside a helmet tended to be distorted and dimmed. The men couldn't hear him as well as he could hear them. And since they couldn't hear themselves too well, they made a little more noise than he did.  A space boot came into view around a big rock, and Wayne aimed his needle-beam at the spot where the man's head would appear.  When the head came around the rock, Wayne fired. The man dropped instantly. _Sorry, friend_, Wayne apologized mentally. _Two down. Fifty-seven to go._ The odds were still pretty heavy.  He knew he had to move quickly now; the others had seen the man drop, and by now they should have a pretty good idea exactly where Wayne was.  He picked up a rock and lobbed it over a nearby boulder, then started moving cat-like in the other direction. He climbed up onto another boulder and watched two men move away from him. They were stepping warily, their beam guns in their hands. Wayne wiped away a bead of perspiration, aimed carefully, and squeezed the firing stud twice.  _Four down. Fifty-five to go._         *       *       *       *       *  A moment later, something hissed near his ear. Without waiting, he spun and rolled off the boulder, landing cat-like on his feet. Another crewman was standing on top of a nearby boulder. Wayne began to sweat; this pursuit seemed to be indefinitely prolonged, and it was beginning to look unlikely that he could avoid them forever.  He had dropped his pistol during the fall; it was wedged between a couple of rocks several feet away.  He heard someone call: \"I got him. He fell off the rock. We'll take him back down below.\"  Then another voice--ominously. \"He won't mind. He'll be glad we did it for him--afterwards.\"  \"I'll go get him,\" said the first voice. The man stepped around the side of the boulder--just in time to have a hard-pitched rock come thunking into his midsection.  \"Oof!\" he grunted, took a couple of steps backwards, and collapsed.  _Five down. Fifty-four to go._ It could go on forever this way.  \"What's the matter?\" asked the man who had replied to the first one with those chilling words.  \"Nothing,\" said Wayne, "]]]
