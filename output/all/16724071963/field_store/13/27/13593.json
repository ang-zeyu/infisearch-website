Then came the turn of the head, and the horizontal and down right cuts were, after further instruction, received so that they, too, glanced off.  Roy gaining more and more confidence at every stroke.  But that helmet was an utter nuisance, and half buried the wearer.  \"I'm beginning to think you're right, Ben, about the armour,\" said the lad, at last.  \"Yes, 'tis a bit awkward, sir; but you'll get used to it.  If you can defend yourself well with that on, why, of course, you can without. Now, then, suppose, for a change, you have a cut at me.\"  \"Why, what tomfoolery is this?\" said a highly-pitched voice; and Roy tried to snatch off his helmet as he caught sight of the secretary standing in the door-way looking on.  But the helmet would not come off easily, and, after a tug or two, Roy was fain to turn to the old soldier.  \"Here,\" he said, hastily, \"unfasten this, Ben, quick!\"  \"Yes, sir; but I don't see as you've any call to be in such a hurry. You've a right to learn to use a sword if you like.  Only the strap fastened over this stud, and there you are.\"  Red-faced and annoyed, Roy faced the secretary, who had walked slowly into the armoury, to stand looking about him with a sneer of contempt upon his lip.  \"Only practising a little sword-play, sir,\" said the boy, as soon as his head was relieved.  \"Sword-play!  Is there no other kind of play a boy like you can take to? What do you want with sword-play?\"  \"My father's a soldier,\" said Roy.  \"Yes; but you are not going to be a fighting man, sir; and, behindhand as you are with your studies, I think you might try a little more to do your instructor credit, and not waste time with one of the servants in such a barbaric pursuit as this.  Lady Royland is waiting breakfast. You had better come at once.\"  Feeling humbled and abashed before the old soldier, Roy followed the secretary without a word, and they entered the breakfast-room together, Lady Royland looking up pale and disturbed, and, upon seeing her son's face, exclaiming--  \"Why, Roy, how hot and tired you look!  Have you been running?\"  The secretary laughed contemptuously.  \"No, mother; practising fencing with Ben.\"  \"Oh, Roy!\" cried his mother, reproachfully; \"what can you want with fencing?  My dear boy, pray think more of your books.\"  Master Pawson gave the lad a peculiar look, and Roy felt as if he should like to kick out under the table so viciously that the sneering smile might give place to a contraction expressing pain.  But Roy did not speak, and the breakfast went on.    CHAPTER SIX.  BEN MARTLET FEELS RUSTY.  \"Come to me in half an hour, Roy,\" said Master Pawson, as they rose from the table, the boy hurrying away to the armoury to find Ben busy as ever, and engaged now in seeing to the straps and fittings of the Italian suit of bronzed steel.  \"Thought I'd do it, sir,\" he said, \"in case you ever asked for it; but I s'pose it's all over with your learning to be a man now.\"  \"Indeed it is not,\" said Roy, sharply.  \"I'm sure my father would not object to my learning fencing.\"  \"Sword-play, sir.\"  \"Very well--sword-play,\" said Roy, pettishly; \"so long as I do not neglect any studies I have to go through with Master Pawson.\"  \"And I s'pose you've been a-neglecting of 'em, sir, eh?\" said the old man, drily.  \"That I've not.  Perhaps I have not got on so well as I ought, but that's because I'm stupid, I suppose.\"  \"Nay, nay, nay!  That won't do, Master Roy.  There's lots o' things I can do as you can't; but that's because you've never learnt.\"  \"Master Pawson's cross because I don't do what he wants.\"  \"Why, what does he want you to do, sir?\"  \"Learn to play the big fiddle.\"  \"What!\" cried the man, indignantly.  \"Then don't you do it, my lad.\"  \"I don't mean to,\" said Roy; \"and I don't want to hurt my mother's feelings; and so I won't make a lot of show over learning sword-play with you, but I shall go on with it, Ben, and you shall take the swords or sticks down in the hollow in the wood, and I'll meet you there every morning at six.\"  \"Mean it, sir?\"  \"Yes, of course; and now I must be off.  I was to be with Master Pawson in half an hour.\"  \"Off you go, then, my lad.  Always keep to your time.\"  Roy ran off, and was going straight to Master Pawson's room in the corner tower, but on the way he met Lady Royland, who took his arm and walked with him out into the square garden.  \"Why, mother, you've been crying,\" said the boy, tenderly.  \"Can you see that, my dear?\"  \"Yes; what is the matter?  I know, though.  You're fretting about not hearing from father.\"  \"Well, is it not enough to make me fret, my boy?\" she said, reproachfully.  \"Of course!  And I'm so thoughtless.\"  \"Yes, Roy,\" said Lady Royland, with a sad smile; \"I am afraid you are.\"  \"I try not to be, mother; I do indeed,\" cried Roy; \"but tell me--is there anything fresh?  Yes; you've had some bad news!  Then you've heard from father.\"  \"No, my boy, no; the bad news comes through Master Pawson.  He has heard again from his friends in London.\"  \"Look here, mother,\" cried the boy, hotly, \"I want to know why he should get letters easily, and we get none.\"  Lady Royland sighed.  \"Father must be too busy to write.\"  \"I am afraid so, my dear.\"  \"But what is the bad news he has told you this morning?\"  They were close up to the foot of the corner tower as Roy asked this question; and, as Lady Royland replied, a few notes of some air being played upon the violoncello high up came floating down to their ears.  \"He tells me that there is no doubt about a terrible revolution having broken out, my boy; that the Parliament is raising an army to fight against the king, and that his friends feel sure that his majesty's cause is lost.\"  \"Then he doesn't know anything about it, mother,\" cried the boy, indignantly.  \"The king has too many brave officers like father who will fight for him, and take care that his cause is not lost.  Oh, I say, hark to that!\"  \"That\" was another strain floating down to them.  \"Yes,\" said Lady Royland, sadly; \"it is Master Pawson playing.  He is waiting for you, Roy.\"  \"Yes, playing,\" said the boy, hotly.  \"It makes me think of what I read with him one day about that Roman emperor--what was his name?--playing while Rome was burning.  But don't you fret, mother; London won't be burnt while father's there.\"  \"You do not realise what it may mean, my boy.\"  \"Oh, yes, I think I do, mother; but you don't think fairly.  You are too anxious.  But there!  I must go up to him now.\"  \"Yes, go, my boy; and you will not cause me any more anxiety than you can help?\"  \"Why, of course I won't, mother.  But if it is going to be a war, don't you think I ought to learn all I can about being a soldier?\"  \"Roy!  No, no!\" cried Lady Royland, wildly.  \"Do I not suffer enough on your father's account?\"  \"There, I won't say any more, mother dear,\" said Roy, clinging to her arm; \"and now I'll confess something.\"  \"You have something to confess?\" said Lady Royland, excitedly, as she stopped where they were, just beneath the corner tower, and quite unconscious of the fact that a head was cautiously thrust out of one of the upper windows and then drawn back, so that only the tip of an ear and a few curls were left visible.  \"Then, tell me quickly, Roy; you have been keeping back some news.\"  \"No, no, mother, not a bit; just as if I would when I know how anxious you are!  It was only this.  Old Ben is always grumbling about the place going to ruin, as he calls it, and I told him, to please him, that he might clean up some of the big guns.\"  \"But you should not have done this, my dear.\"  \"No; I'll tell him not to, mother.  And I'd made an arrangement with him to meet him every morning out in the primrose dell to practise sword-cutting.  I was going to-morrow morning, but I won't go now.\"  Lady Royland pressed her lips to the boy's forehead, and smiled in his face.  \"Thank you, my dear,\" she said, softly.  \"Recollect you are everything to me now!  And I want your help and comfort now I am so terribly alone. Master Pawson is profuse in his offers of assistance to relieve me of the management here, but I want that assistance to come from my son.\"  \"Of course!\" said Roy, haughtily.  \"He's only the secretary, and if any one is to take father's place, it ought to be me.\"  \"Yes; and you shall, Roy, my dear.  You are very young, but now this trouble has come upon us, you must try to be a man and my counsellor so that when your father returns--\"  She ceased speaking, and Roy pressed her hands encouragingly as he saw her lips trembling and that she had turned ghastly white.  \"When your father returns,\" she said, now firmly, \"we must let him see that we have managed everything well.\"  \"Then why not, as it's war time, let Ben do what he wanted, and we'll put the place in a regular state of defence?\"  \"No, no, no, my dear,\" said Lady Royland, with a shudder.  \"Why should you give our peaceful happy home even the faintest semblance of war, when it can by no possibility come into this calm, quiet, retired nook. No, my boy, not that, please.\"  \"Very well, mother.  Then I'll go riding round to see the tenants, and look after the things at home just as you wish me to.  Will that do?\"  Lady Royland smiled, and then pressed her son's arm.  \"Go up now, then, to Master Pawson's room,\" she said; \"and recollect that one of the things I wish you to do is to be more studious than you would be if your father were at home.\"  Roy nodded and hurried up into the corridor, thinking to himself that Master Pawson would not like his being so much in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25454"],["title","Introduction of the Locomotive Safety Truck (#0)"],["body","Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net          INTRODUCTION OF THE LOCOMOTIVE SAFETY TRUCK  _by John H.

With increased speed and density     of traffic came an increase in catastrophic wrecks that forced     operators to take heed for the safety of their passengers and     freight. This safety was painfully achieved through the slow process     of improving equipment part by part._      _Antedating such spectacular post-Civil War advances as the steel     rail, automatic coupler, and airbrake, was the invention of the     safety truck for locomotives. Intended to lead the bobbing, weaving     locomotive around curves on the rough track of the early roads, it     did much to reduce the all too numerous derailments that were a     major cause of accidents._      The Author: _John H. White, is associate curator, in charge of land     transportation, in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History     and Technology, United States National Museum._     American railroads of the early 19th century were cheaply and hastily built. They were characterized by inferior roadbeds, steep grades, sharp curves, and rough track. In spring, poor drainage and lack of ballast might cause the track to sink into the soggy roadbed and produced an unstable path. In winter this same roadbed could freeze into a hard and unyielding pavement on which the rolling stock was pounded to pieces.  In those pioneering times the demand for new roads left little capital to improve or expand existing lines; therefore equipment was needed that could accommodate itself to the existing operating conditions.  The first locomotives used in this country had been imported from England. Designed for well-ballasted track with large-radius curves and gentle gradients, they all too frequently left the rails, and the unsuitability of the essentially rigid British design soon became apparent.  The challenge posed by the American roadbed was met by American mechanics. By the mid-1830's a distinctive American locomotive had evolved that might best be described by the word \"flexible.\" The basic features of its running gear were a bar frame and equalizing levers to provide vertical relief and a leading truck to provide lateral relief. Of these devices the truck was probably the most important, and more readily than any one component distinguished the American running gear from that used by the British before 1860.  [Illustration: FIGURE 1.--Design drawing showing the 4-wheel leading truck, developed in 1831 by John B. Jervis, applied to the _Brother Jonathan_. This locomotive, one of the earliest to use a leading truck, was built in June 1832 by the West Point Foundry Association for the Mohawk and Hudson Rail Road. The truck is attached to the locomotive frame by a center pin, but the forward weight of the locomotive is carried by a roller which bears on the frame of the truck. (_Smithsonian photo 36716-a_)]  It was John B. Jervis who is generally credited with first applying the truck to the locomotive. His design, shown in figure 1, was developed in 1831-32. Its merits quickly became apparent, and by 1835 it had been universally recognized in this country. The truck successfully led the locomotive around sharp curves, the resultant 3-point suspension enabled the machine to traverse even the roughest of tracks, and, altogether, the design did far less damage to the lightly built U.S. lines than did the rigid, imported engines.[1]  The truck frame, fabricated from iron straps and castings, was attached to the locomotive by a pin around which it might rotate. At first the weight was received by rollers or chafing pads mounted on the side beams of the truck. However, the friction of these bearing surfaces and their location at a considerable distance from the center pin combined to restrict the free movement of the truck. By the early 1850's the point of bearing was transferred to the center plate, producing a truck that turned more freely.[2]  [Illustration: FIGURE 2.--The 4-wheel Bissell truck as shown in the drawing for British patent 1273, issued May 5, 1857.]  [Illustration:    A--Truck frame   B--Equalizing lever   C--Locomotive frame   D--Double incline plane      (_Centering device_)   E--Truck bolster   F--Swivel pin      (_Pivot point_)           _Drawn by J. H. White. June, 1960_  FIGURE 3.--Typical 4-wheel Bissell Safety truck of 1860. This drawing is based on plate 69 of Alexander L. Holley's, _American and European Railway Practice in the Economical Generation of Steam_, New York, 1861. (_Smithsonian photo 46946_)]  For single axle engines this simple form of truck was entirely satisfactory, but it proved less satisfactory for 4- and 6-coupled machines. Also, as train speeds increased, so did the number of derailments. Many of these could be traced to the inability of the engine to negotiate curves at speed. Levi Bissell, a New York inventor who investigated this problem in the 1850's, correctly analyzed the difficulty. He observed that when the engine was proceeding on straight tracks the leading truck tended to oscillate and chatter about the center pin, and he noted that it was this action that imparted a fearful pitching motion to the locomotive at speed. The derailments were traced to the action of the truck as the engine entered a curve.  This action can be more easily understood from reference to Bissell's patent drawing in figure 2. For example, let us say that an 8-wheel engine, fitted with a center-swing truck, enters a right-hand curve. The left truck wheels bear hard against the left rail. The drivers jam obliquely across the track, with the right front and left rear wheels grinding into the rails. As a result, the locomotive tends to leave the track in the direction of the arrow shown on the figure (bottom drawing). It will be noted that the truck center pintle is in fact the fulcrum for this leverage. Under such strain the truck wheels are particularly likely to leave the rails when they encounter an obstruction. Once derailed, the truck would then spin around on the deadly center pin, throwing the locomotive over.  In effect, then, the center pin of the conventional truck extended the rigid wheelbase of the engine, and caused the truck to act much as would a single set of leading wheels fitted rigidly to the engine frame far ahead of the front driving wheels. Bissell proposed to correct the faults of the conventional truck by fitting the locomotives with his invention, the first practical safety truck to be patented. Since the primary requirements were to keep the leading wheel axles at right angles to the rails whether on a straight or curved track, and to allow the driving axles to remain parallel, or nearly so, to the radial line of the curve, he moved the center pin to a point behind the truck and just in front of the forward driving axle. This shortened the wheelbase of the engine and removed the danger of the pintle serving as a fulcrum between the truck and the driving wheels, thus allowing them to assume a comfortable position on a curve.  [Illustration: FIGURE 4.--A 4-wheel safety truck fitted with A. F. Smith's swing-bolster centering device. Built by the Hinkley Locomotive Works. From Gustavus Weissenborn, _American Locomotive Engineering and Railway Mechanism_, New York, 1871, pl. 88.]  Since the truck could assume the correct angle when entering curves, it was claimed in the patent specification that, unless all four wheels were simultaneously lifted off the track, the truck could pass over \"quite a considerable obstruction.\"[3] Bissell further claimed:      In running on either a straight or curved track one of the truck     wheels often breaks off, and the truck swivels around on its center     pin in consequence, and throws the engine off the track, but with my     device one wheel, or even the two wheels on the opposite sides     diagonally of the truck might break off and still the truck would     not run off, because its position is set and it has no axis of     motion around which it could swing....  The other problem Bissell wished to correct was the oscillation and chatter of the leading truck. This was accomplished by a simple centering device in the form of a pair of V-shaped double incline planes (D on fig. 3) situated at the center of the truck frame (A). The lower planes of the pair were fastened to the truck frame and the upper, cast in the form of a bridge, were attached to the locomotive frame (C) by a center plate. But while the portion of the locomotive's weight assigned to the leading wheels was borne at the center of the truck, as in the conventional design, the center plate was no longer the point of rotation. On a straight track the V's would be at their bottom position and thus prevent the truck from vibrating.[4] When the locomotive entered a curve the planes allowed its forward weight to bear continuously on all four wheels, and at the same time controlled any exaggerated swing caused by centrifugal force.  The centering device is thus explained in the patent specification (figure numbers are omitted):      I therefore obviate this difficulty [the oscillation of the truck]     by providing two inclined planes ... formed double as shown and of     an angle proportioned to the weight of the forward part of the     locomotive and the velocity of the same.... The position of the     inclines is such that the blocks [V's] rest in the lowest part of     the double inclines when the engine is on a straight track, and on     coming onto a curve the"]]]
