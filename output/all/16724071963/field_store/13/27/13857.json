At camp Dorothy insisted that two long plaits were always in one's way. Her eyes were a clear blue with a slight hint of gray, her skin healthy and freshly colored. A fine, frank line formed her lips. Altogether she was the type of American girlhood who represents many of our highest ideals.  At the present moment a frown appeared between her brows.  \"I did want to ask your opinion about something, Louise. Yet nothing is more important to me than to see how happy you are this summer and how the life in the forest is changing you. What I wanted to ask is your view concerning the apology the Boy Scouts have made us for their rudeness. Shall we or shall we not bury the hatchet and agree to forgive them? The situation is particularly uncomfortable for me. I don't like to take any special position in the matter, because Lance and Don are my brothers. Lance has confessed he was principally responsible for their effort to frighten or tease us soon after our arrival at camp. So far as I have been able to find out we seem about evenly divided on the subject. Tory Drew wishes to forget all about it. She is so grateful to Don and Lance for rescuing Kara that she refuses to consider anything else. Edith Linder agrees with Tory besides Evan Phillips and several other girls.  \"Strangely the persons most opposed to forgiving the boys and making friends again are Margaret Hale and Joan Peters.  \"We are to vote on the question to-night.  \"But here comes Teresa. Perhaps she will tell us how she feels on the subject. I wonder what is the matter? She looks worried, and she has been so happy at camp.\"  At the tent opening Teresa appeared.  \"Do come on down to the lake and let us sit there a half hour and talk if you have finished your work?\" she asked.  Teresa's olive coloring had deepened in the weeks in the sunshine and fresh air, her cheeks were more rose colored, her wide eyes with their half mature, half childish expression were slightly plaintive at this instant.  The shores of the lake, not a great distance from the camping ground, were a favorite resting place for the Girl Scout Troop.  Not only did they rest here and hold long conversations, of necessity here a good deal of the camp work took place. Clothes and dishes were washed, water was had for cleaning. Farther up on the left-hand side, where a shore of bright pebbles ran down into the lake, was the bathing beach for the campers. The water for drinking was obtained at a pure spring up the hill of the Three Pines which rose not far off from the camp.  At present, as the greater number of the girls were still busy in their tents, the vicinity of the lake was agreeably solitary.  As the three girls sat down Louise Miller said suddenly:  \"There is a legend of a lake where every night at midnight a maiden arises bearing in her hands a silver bowl. One may make a wish and cast it into the silver bowl. Then the maiden disappears. On another night, one can never know exactly when, the maiden returns and on this night grants your wish.\"  \"I wish she would appear at once,\" Teresa grumbled. \"I have a wish she might be persuaded to grant. I want something more exciting to happen at camp. Oh, I am enjoying it of course, but of late the days have been a good deal alike.\"  \"What is it you want, Teresa?\" Louise Miller demanded a little scornfully. Two girls could not have been more unlike. Because Louise was intellectual she could not altogether refrain from regarding the other girl with a mixture of pity and amused contempt, as well as occasional envy.  Teresa was so pretty, so gentle and confiding and pleasure loving. When she failed to live up to the Scout rules, as all of the girls, being human, did now and then, no one ever blamed Teresa. Nor did Louise Miller understand that Teresa represented the type of girl who oftentimes has a stronger will than any other, hidden beneath her apparent gentleness. Teresa was not conscious of possessing a strong will. In fact, she would have denied the fact, believing she was telling the exact truth.  She only knew that in a quiet fashion she wanted what she wanted very intensely and that it was almost impossible to give up any wish. She might try her best, she might even pretend to herself that she had given up. The desire was inclined to be only asleep and to wake again. One must remember this characteristic in hearing of Teresa Peterson's after career.  Teresa shrugged her shoulders.  \"I am not anxious to talk to you, Louise, only it is so impossible to see Dorothy without you.\"  Teresa flushed prettily.  \"There, I don't mean to be rude. One is now and then without intending it. I suppose you are such a profoundly intellectual individual you cannot bear with my frivolous character.  \"I only want to say to Dorothy that I am specially anxious to have our camp of Girl Scouts make friends with the Boy Scouts. I have a special reason and promised to do my best with the girls. But of course I know I have not a great deal of influence, like you have Dorothy, or Margaret Hale, or Tory Drew.\"  Teresa's voice and manner became vaguely plaintive.  \"Then we could have occasional dances, or supper parties, something to vary the outdoor monotony. Oh, of course I love the camp better than being at home. I only thought we were going to have some other associates beside just our own Troop. Most of the boys are our old friends and Don and Lance are your brothers, Dorothy. I don't see any point in our always avoiding each other.\"  \"I see, Teresa, feminine society is not enough for you. I wonder if it ever will be,\" Louise remarked with such profound disgust and annoyance that Dorothy shook her head reproachfully.  \"Don't be so cross, Ouida, I am sure Teresa does not mean any great harm. I like boys, I am obliged to like them with six brothers of my own. Besides, I feel as Teresa does that it is stupid and self righteous of us to continue to refuse to have anything to do with the Boy Scouts simply because they once offended us. Certainly I miss the opportunity to see Lance and Don now and then.\"  Anxious to be out of the conversation, Louise Miller picked up a book of nature studies on the New England country, by John Burroughs, and began reading.  Teresa Peterson's nature was not a straightforward one. Without actual proof Louise Miller felt this instinctively. Of course there was no great harm in her. But then all the more reason why she might make mischief without intending it.  A few moments later the three girls moved back toward camp. Tent inspection was over and they were going for an all-day hike through the woods.     CHAPTER VIII  LIGHT AND SHADE   Victoria Drew sat on the lowest step leading into the evergreen cabin. This was the name she preferred to call it. Inside Kara lay asleep.  There was no one else at the camp in Beechwood Forest at this moment.  The other girls and the Troop Captain had departed for a day's hike, not to return until late afternoon.  Nevertheless Tory and Kara had not been alone. This never occurred; Edith Linder had remained to be useful and to relieve Tory. As a matter of fact, the Troop Captain, Miss Mason, and half a dozen girls had insisted that Tory go forth for the long hike. The day was a perfect midsummer day and each and every one of them would gladly remain with Kara.  Tory had declined. In face of the argument that it was her duty to give the other Girl Scouts the opportunity to be useful to Kara, who was their friend as well as her own, Tory insisted that to-day she was too tired for a long tramp. In any case she would stay on at camp. Some other day she would be glad to change places.  At present Edith Linder had gone the half mile or more away to the little House in the Woods on an errand. She had promised to help prepare supper before the camping party could return. Finding herself in need of supplies she had explained to Tory and slipped away. Kara would not be apt to awaken soon and there appeared no immediate need for her.  In truth Tory was glad to be alone for an hour.  In a short time the sun would set.  Weary Tory believed she wanted an hour for quiet thinking.  Earlier in the day Teresa had confessed that she was feeling a degree of disappointment in the summer camp.  Tory Drew was disappointed, but for different reasons.  The past winter had been the most difficult she could remember. After a wandering existence abroad with her artist father, it had not been simple to find her place and to make friends in Westhaven. Yet she had accomplished both. Her aunt, Miss Victoria Fenton, did not regard her with great affection, nevertheless at least she had agreed that the younger Victoria had become slightly less trying. And she and her uncle, Mr. Richard Fenton, at first not liking each other, had become devoted comrades.  Save for his interest and aid the summer camp, now surrounding her like a quiet guard, would never have been a possibility.  Growing a little restless, Tory changed her position.  Would it not have been better had she gone on the errand to Miss Frean and asked Edith to watch beside Kara. Of late Kara frequently showed that she was weary of so much of her society.  Moreover, without confessing the fact, Tory appreciated that she was suffering from the strain. She was tired and nervous oftener than she was accustomed to feeling.  A quiet talk with Memory Frean and a walk to the House in the Woods would have done her good.  Her uncle had said that he hoped this summer would give them an opportunity for a closer intimacy. He believed that her influence would be of benefit to Tory. If their friendship of long ago had ended, he had not for that reason ceased to admire Miss Frean.  At this moment a breeze swept through Beechwood Forest, setting the leaves shimmering with a fairylike enchantment.  An instant Tory was aroused from her reflections.  She was alone with no one to disturb her. Why not slip into her tent and find her sketch book?

M. C. W.)     THE KEEPERS OF THE KING'S PEACE     CHAPTER I  BONES, SANDERS AND ANOTHER   To Isongo, which stands upon the tributary of that name, came a woman of the Isisi who had lost her husband through a providential tree falling upon him. I say \"providential,\" for it was notorious that he was an evil man, a drinker of beer and a favourite of many bad persons. Also he made magic in the forest, and was reputedly the familiar of Bashunbi the devil brother of M'shimba-M'shamba. He beat his wives, and once had set fire to his house from sheer wickedness. So that when he was borne back to the village on a grass bier and the women of his house decked themselves with green leaves and arm in arm staggered and stamped through the village street in their death dance, there was a suspicion of hilarity in their song, and a more cheery step in their dance than the occasion called for.  An old man named D'wiri, who knew every step of every dance, saw this and said in his stern way that it was shameless. But he was old and was, moreover, in fear for the decorum of his own obsequies if these outrageous departures from custom were approved or allowed to pass without reprimand.  When M'lama, the wife of G'mami, had seen her lord depart in the canoe for burial in the middle island and had wailed her conventional grief, she washed the dust from her body at the river's edge and went back to her hut. And all that was grief for the dead man was washed away with the dust of mourning.  Many moons came out of the sky, were wasted and died before the woman M'lama showed signs of her gifts. It is said that they appeared one night after a great storm wherein lightning played such strange tricks upon the river that even the old man D'wiri could not remember parallel instances.  In the night the wife of a hunter named E'sani-Osoni brought a dying child into the hut of the widow. He had been choked by a fish-bone and was _in extremis_ when M'lama put her hand upon his head and straightway the bone flew from his mouth, \"and there was a cry terrible to hear--such a cry as a leopard makes when he is pursued by ghosts.\"  A week later a baby girl fell into a terrible fit and M'lama had laid her hand upon it and behold! it slept from that moment.  Ahmet, chief of the Government spies, heard of these happenings and came a three days' journey by river to Isongo.  \"What are these stories of miracles?\" he asked.  \"_Capita_,\" said the chief, using the term of regard which is employed in the Belgian Congo, \"this woman M'lama is a true witch and has great gifts, for she raises the dead by the touch of her hand. This I have seen. Also it is said that when U'gomi, the woodcutter, made a fault, cutting his foot in two, this woman healed him marvellously.\"  \"I will see this M'lama,\" said Ahmet importantly.  He found her in her hut tossing four bones idly. These were the shanks of goats, and each time they fell differently.  \"O Ahmet,\" she said, when he entered, \"you have a wife who is sick, also a first-born boy who does not speak though he is more than six seasons old.\"  Ahmet squatted down by her side.  \"Woman,\" said he, \"tell me something that is not the talk of river and I will believe your magic.\"  \"To-morrow your master, the lord Sandi, will send you a book which will give you happiness,\" she said.  \"Every day my lord sends me a book,\" retorted the sceptical Ahmet, \"and each brings me happiness. Also it is common talk that at this time there come messengers carrying bags of silver and salt to pay men according to their services.\"  Undismayed she tried her last shot.  \"You have a crooked finger which none can straighten--behold!\"  She took his hand in hers and pressed the injured phlange. A sharp pain shot up his arm and he winced, pulling back his hand--but the year-old dislocation which had defied the effort of the coast doctor was straightened out, and though the movement was exquisitely painful he could bend it.  \"I see you are a true witch,\" he said, greatly impressed, for a native has a horror of deformity of any kind, and he sent back word of the phenomenon to Sanders.  Sanders at the same time was in receipt of other news which alternately pleased him and filled him with panic. The mail had come in by fast launch and had brought Captain Hamilton of the Houssas a very bulky letter written in a feminine hand. He had broken the glad news to Commissioner Sanders, but that gentleman was not certain in his mind whether the startling intelligence conveyed by the letter was good or bad.  \"I'm sure the country will suit her,\" he said, \"this part of the country at any rate--but what will Bones say?\"  \"Bones!\" repeated Captain Hamilton scornfully. \"What the dickens does it matter what Bones says?\"  Nevertheless, he went to the sea-end of the verandah, and his roar rivalled the thunder of the surf.  \"Bones!\"  There was no answer and for an excellent reason.  Sanders came out of the bungalow, his helmet on the back of his head, a cheroot tilted dizzily.  \"Where is he?\" he asked.  Hamilton turned.  \"I asked him to--at least I didn't ask him, he volunteered--to peg out a trench line.\"  \"Expect an invasion?\" asked Sanders.  Hamilton grinned.  \"Bones does,\" he said. \"He's full of the idea, and offered to give me tips on the way a trench should be dug--he's feeling rotten about things ... you know what I mean. His regiment was at Mons.\"  Sanders nodded.  \"I understand,\" he said quietly. \"And you ... you're a jolly good soldier, Hamilton--how do you feel about it all?\"  Hamilton shrugged his shoulders.  \"They would have taken me for the Cameroons, but somebody had to stay,\" he said quietly. \"After all, it is one's business to ... to do one's job in the station of life to which it has pleased God to call him. This is my work ... here.\"  Sanders laid his hand on the other's shoulder.  \"That's the game as it should be played,\" he said, and his blue eyes were as soft and as tender as a woman's. \"There is no war here--we are the keepers of the King's peace, Hamilton.\"  \"It's rotten....\"  \"I know--I feel that way myself. We're out of it--the glory of it--the chance of it--the tragedy of it. And there are others. Think of the men in India eating their hearts out ... praying for the order that will carry them from the comfort of their lives to the misery and the death--and the splendour, I grant you--of war.\"  He sighed and looked wistfully to the blue sea.  Hamilton beckoned a Houssa corporal who was crossing the garden of the Residency.  \"Ho, Mustaf,\" he said, in his queer coast Arabic, \"where shall I look for my lord Tibbetti?\"  The corporal turned and pointed to the woods which begin at the back of the Residency and carry without a break for three hundred miles.  \"Lord, he went there carrying many strange things--also there went with him Ali Abid, his servant.\"  Hamilton reached through an open window of the bungalow and fished out his helmet with his walking-stick.  \"We'll find Bones,\" he said grimly; \"he's been gone three hours and he's had time to re-plan Verdun.\"  It took some time to discover the working party, but when it was found the trouble was well repaid.  Bones was stretched on a canvas chair under the shade of a big Isisi palm. His helmet was tipped forward so that the brim rested on the bridge of his nose, his thin red arms were folded on his breast, and their gentle rise and fall testified to his shame. Two pegs had been driven in, and between them a string sagged half-heartedly.  Curled up under a near-by bush was, presumably, Ali Abid--presumably, because all that was visible was a very broad stretch of brown satin skin which showed between the waistline of a pair of white cotton trousers and a duck jacket.  They looked down at the unconscious Bones for a long time in silence.  \"What will he say when I kick him?\" asked Hamilton. \"You can have the first guess.\"  Sanders frowned thoughtfully.  \"He'll say that he was thinking out a new system of communicating trenches,\" he said. \"He's been boring me to tears over saps and things.\"  Hamilton shook his head.  \"Wrong, sir,\" he said; \"that isn't the lie he'll tell. He will say that I kept him up so late last night working at the men's pay-sheets that he couldn't keep awake.\"  Bones slept on.  \"He may say that it was coffee after tiffin,\" suggested Sanders after a while; \"he said the other day that coffee always made him sleep.\"  \"'Swoon' was the word he used, sir,\" corrected Hamilton. \"I don't think he'll offer that suggestion now--the only other excuse I can think of is that he was repeating the Bomongo irregular verbs. Bones!\"  He stooped and broke off a long grass and inserted it in the right ear of Lieutenant Tibbetts, twiddling the end delicately. Bones made a feeble clutch at his ear, but did not open his eyes.  \"Bones!\" said Hamilton, and kicked him less gently. \"Get up, you lazy devil--there's an invasion.\"  Bones leapt to his feet and staggered a"]]]
