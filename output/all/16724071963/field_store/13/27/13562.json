Howsomever, you-all won't find it so easy to git rid of curious folks when that miner-gang gits ha'r. Ah happen to know who and how many are plannin' to come.\"  With that farewell, Hank turned his horse's head and led the way down the trail, slowly followed by the unwilling miner.  \"Oh, Mr. Brewster! hadn't we better ride after Mike and the girls before the miners' gang gets here?\" cried Barbara, fearfully.  Mr. Brewster laughed. \"That was only a bluff of Hank's to make me ride along so he and his pal might follow us. I haven't the least doubt but that both of those cowardly rascals are hiding just out of sight where they can watch my every movement. Should we start to ride along towards the cave, they would follow and shoot us from the rear as sure as anything.\"  In spite of his making light of Hank, however, Mr. Brewster kept a wary eye open for an ambuscade. Nothing of moment happened, however, and Jeb was just saying: \"Maybe we-all had best ride for the cave,\" when a shot rang out.  \"Well!\" gasped he, while the two girls trembled with fear.  \"That sounded from Top Notch. It's either Simms and his party, or those rascals. In either case, it won't be cowardly in us to hide behind a clump of pines and await developments,\" suggested the rancher.  Mr. Brewster stationed Eleanor behind a close growth of young pine and handed her a small rifle. Barbara was hidden deeper in the forest, and then he and Jeb took their places behind a bowlder whence they could watch the up-trail. With a revolver ready in each hand, they waited anxiously.  But his wise precautions were unnecessary this time, for Bill soon rode up, calling loudly as he came. Sam Brewster sighed with relief to find a group of Oak Creek's leading citizens with the Sheriff.  \"Bill, did you-all shoot, a time back?\" queried Mr. Brewster the moment the possé came up.  Bill laughed. \"Ah'll explain in a minute. You-all see it wa'r this way: After you-all left for home, yesterday, it wa'r found how some low-down sneaks got wind of this claim and planned to ride up at once. It looked a lot like claim-jumpin', so we-all got together mighty quick and rode after them to spare the Lord any trouble in judgin' 'em. Also, we-all reckoned to save your party any nonsense over the gold, 'specially as thar wa'r four gals in it.\"  \"But three rascals got a lead on you,\" interrupted Sam.  \"Yeh, three are at large somewhere, Ah reckon; but two of the worst ones out of that five are back yonder. Hank Johnson and his jail-bird pal are down on Four Mile Blaze. When we get the other three, we'll rid Oak Crick of five of its worst citizens.\"  \"Rattle-Snake Mike came up with us, Bill. We rode up the Indian Trail--that's how we got here so soon. But Mike went on to the cave with Polly and her friend. They'll guard their claim, all right, unless those three interfere,\" said Mr. Brewster, with an anxious note in his voice.  \"Ah reckon we'd better make for that cave, then! Thar may be some work cut out fer us thar,\" whispered Bill, seeing the two city girls now ride out from cover and come over to join the group.  \"Where's Mrs. Brewster?\" asked Eleanor, anxiously.  \"This is Bill's party--they left Oak Creek last night,\" explained Mr. Brewster.  \"Then where is Simms and your wife?\" asked Barbara.  \"You see it will take the others much longer to ride up from Lone Pine than it took us to climb the trappers' trail, so they can't possibly arrive for some time yet. We-all just got here, and we left Oak Creek at midnight,\" explained one of the men, encouraging the two girls.  \"But we-all stopped on the way and cooked breakfast and fed our hosses. Simms and his party will ride right up and ought to be ha'r pritty soon, now,\" said Bill.  \"How about leavin' some one here at Four Mile Blaze to direct the Simms' party, while we-all ride on with Sam to hunt those three claim-jumpers,\" suggested one of the possé.  \"Barbara and I will wait here with Jeb if you leave us each with a gun,\" offered Eleanor, eagerly.  Barbara gasped at the very idea, but Eleanor added:  \"We don't want to be mixed up in a fight with rascals, and we are safer here than up there.\"  \"The gal's right, Sam. They'd onny be in the road if we-all have to chase them men,\" said Bill.  \"But they can't shoot! Why give them any guns?\" asked Mr. Brewster, anxiously.  \"I just bet I could kill you at forty paces, if you were a claim-jumper and looked at me the way Hank looked at you!\" declared Eleanor, emphatically.  The men laughed, and Bill wagged his head approvingly. \"Ah say, Sam, let the gals take a crack at the Four Mile tree--and see.\"  \"Well, even the sight of guns will make the villains respect us, even if we can't shoot!\" added Barbara, who felt that the lesser of the two dangers would be to remain with Eleanor and Jeb where they now were.  After many instructions and warnings had been given to Jeb and the two city girls, Mr. Brewster spurred his horse on to ride after his companions who were already up the trail. But he had not far to go.  At the bend of the trail, where there was a small clearing, he saw the men standing up in their stirrups, intent on something ahead. He urged his horse up to join them, and just before reaching the group, he called out: \"What's wrong?\"  The horses were tossing their heads, pawing the ground, and acting restive. Bill turned half-way around in the saddle and replied: \"D'you-all smell anything, Sam?\"  Mr. Brewster noticed then, that the men held faces up and were sniffing in different directions. He then sniffed carefully himself and exclaimed: \"Smells like smoke.\"  But even as he spoke, the thought reached him: \"A forest fire!\" His face went white and he murmured a prayer to himself for Polly and Anne.  \"Yeh, Sam. Comin' down from the Slide,\" was all Bill said.  \"My Gawd, men! what shall we do?\" cried one of the possé.  \"We-all must ship them two gals an' Jeb down trail, right away, and then the rest of us'll ride up to see if anything kin be done to stop it. Mebbe it hain't got a headway yet,\" replied Bill.  But the two girls were now seen riding up the trail as fast as their horses could travel. Barbara rode first and Eleanor after her, shouting aloud in a frantic voice. The men waited fearfully to hear what new trouble assailed them.  Barbara almost ran down Mr. Brewster's horse in her blind fear, and when questioned, could not speak. Eleanor then rode up and looked so angry that she could scarcely explain.  \"Bob declared she heard noises behind us and on one side, and then, without giving me or Jeb any warning, she started her horse at a run, to come and meet you men. She cried that it would be safer with a crowd than alone with only Jeb and me and the rifles we knew nothing about. I had to ride after her to see that she reached you safely. Now I'll go back and keep guard again.\"  \"Stop, Nolla! Although you are a brave little girl, it will be of no use to keep guard now. Jeb and you will have to ride down Top Notch Trail as fast as you can, and meet Simms who is coming up with Mrs. Brewster. Send Simms and the men on to help us, but you three women take Jeb and go right on down. There's a forest fire.\" Mr. Brewster added the last portentous words in an awed voice.  \"Oh, my goodness! Will we be hurt?\" cried Barbara.  But Eleanor thought not of herself. She immediately cried: \"Are Polly and Anne safe?\"  \"Polly--whar's she?\" demanded Bill, suddenly realizing that the girl was not one of the party.  \"She went to the cave with Mike to watch there, in case any claim-jumpers tried to stake their ground,\" groaned Sam Brewster.  \"Is the cave far from here?\" added Bill, quickly.  \"Not as far as Top Notch Trail,\" replied Eleanor, seeing a possible way for her to get to Polly and Anne.  \"But some one ought to send Simms on to us and then ride on down trail to signal the forest-rangers' lookout so's they could come and help fight the fire,\" said another man.  \"Can't Bob and I join Polly and Anne in the cave where we will be safe from any fire, and you send Jeb down to signal Simms and the forest-rangers?\" asked Eleanor excitedly, seeing how urgent was the need for instant action.  \"All right; take this young man for protection, and get to the cave as quick as you can. You gals wait in the cave till you-all hear from us again. Send Mike down trail to Jeb to hurry Simms and then escort Mrs. Brewster home. We're ridin' up yander to work,\" ordered Bill, authoritatively.  Eleanor turned her horse's head to a faint trail that she was sure would bring them to the cave. Barbara and the cow-boy followed, while Bill and his men urged the horses to their utmost up the steep Slide.  \"Thar's one good thing about this fire--it seems to be comin' down, and it don't travel near so quick that way, like-as-how it do when it goes upward. Mebbe we-all kin choke it in its first stages,\" explained Bill.  Eleanor and her two followers now reached the end of the little erosion made by a storm. Then the city girl found it really was no trail at all. They sat their horses looking helplessly about while Barbara began to whimper with fear.  Even courageous Eleanor began to quail at what would befall them if they were lost, when Mike suddenly appeared in the distance, climbing the steep slope before them. His broncho came on recklessly through the bushes and wild undergrowth until he was within speaking distance then he shouted:  \"Mike hear shoots! Gals in cabe alle-right. Mike smell fire. He go see who burn. Fin' tree bad miner--One gone happy hunting-groun',--two sleep f'm much fire-water. Tree hosses hobble on down trail.\" As he spoke he acted his words so that it was plain that he had found the three claim-jumpers who were dead drunk, and their mounts which were trying to break away in sheer fear of the fire.  \"Mike, Bill and Mr. Brewster said you were to leave us in the cave, if it is safe there, and then ride down trail to meet Jeb"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25419"],["title","Polly and Eleanor (#4)"],["body","go on to stop Simms' party. Warn the lookout on the forest-ranger's post and then come back to us, but Jeb is to ride home with the Missus!\" exclaimed Eleanor, excitedly.  Mike frowned. \"Indian no like squaw job!\"  \"That's just what I was going to say, Mike. Now if you will put us on the right trail, we three can find the way to the cave. We will stay there with the other girls, and let you do as you think best, _after_ you send Jeb away to meet Simms,\" said Eleanor.  \"Mike mus' tell Boss and Bill 'bout fire. Him eat down-hill, udder side Slide. No burn dis side.\"  Meantime, the Indian was leading the way to the trail that would bring the girls out at the ravine where the cave was. Once on the right trail, the youth whom Bill had sent with the girls, said he could keep to it without going astray.  Mike waited but a moment to assure himself that they would be safe along the trail, then he started his horse up the steep side. His keen Indian scout habits now stood him in good stead. He soon had the Sheriff's party tracked and was riding after them. His young broncho galloped along until the group of men bound for the Slide, were hailed by a war-whoop.  Bill turned and saw the Indian close behind. He called a halt, and when the party stopped, the messenger was already in their midst.  \"Fire up lodge-pole pine side. Eatin' down--dat way!\" cried Mike, waving a hand at the side of the mountain away from them and the cave.  \"Mike go see an' fin' tree miner. Dey hab big fight--two shoot one. Him dead. Udders drunk--gone 'sleep. Hosses tie up.\"  \"Mike, you lead! Men fall in--we-all fight the fire first, then find the drunken miners and arrest them for manslaughter,\" ordered Bill, and thus the possé rode away.     CHAPTER III  AT CHOKO'S FIND   After losing the trail many times only to stumble into it again and again, and then slipping, sliding, or jolting down the steep side of the mountain where the timber-line ended near the cliff, Eleanor finally recognized the ravine where the cave was located.  \"Oh, thank heavens! We're almost there,\" she cried, trying to find the easiest way down to the ledge.  Polly and Anne were sitting before the entrance to the cave, when they heard shouts and saw three weary riders coming along the rocky ledge that led to their refuge.  \"Why--it's Nolla and Bob and a man!\" exclaimed Polly, jumping up to run and meet the girls.  \"What's wrong--any one hurt?\" cried Anne, the moment she saw the faces of the girls.  Eleanor then told about the forest-fire, and where the men were. The more recent excitement had quite driven the story of Hank and his claim-jumpers from her mind. But Polly anxiously asked for her mother.  \"Oh, yes--Simms and the party hadn't arrived when we left Four Mile Blaze. But they will be all right, as Mike is gone to meet them. Then your mother and Jeb will ride back to warn the forest-rangers about the fire,\" explained Barbara.  \"Why, no, Bob. Don't you remember, Mike said he would have to tell Polly's father about the drunken men and the fire, first,\" Eleanor corrected her sister.  \"Well, I'm not worrying about mother because she knows too much to run into unnecessary danger; but father always wants to save everybody and everything from disaster, and so takes his life in his hands, over and over again,\" Polly worried.  \"Mr. Brewster'll be all right with Bill around, Miss Polly,\" said the young man who had accompanied the city girls. \"No one is allowed to run any risks for nuthin', when the Sheriff is there to stop 'em.\"  \"I just hope Bill _will_ keep father in bounds!\" declared Polly.  Very little smoke reached the ravine, which was on the opposite side of the mountain from that where the fire raged, so the girls knew not how matters fared until late in the afternoon. Then, to their great relief, Mr. Brewster shouted a signal from the lodge-pole pine forest.  Polly gave an answering call, and then ran along the dangerous ledge until she reached the place where the pine trees had been blown down the day of the blizzard. Here she could see the dim outlines of several riders as they waited for some evidence that they were on the right trail.  Before Polly could climb the slope to wave her hat, she saw Mike riding up behind the party and then go on before them down the trail leading to the cave.  Polly was kept busy with answering the girls who stood at the cave entrance, and in calling to her parents and friends who were approaching as fast as the down-trail would permit. When they rode near enough for Polly to see their faces, she recognized her mother and Jeb in the party; she thought they expressed great concern over something that must have happened to the party--or perhaps something that might happen.  \"Well, Polly, you've had all day to dig the gold out of your mine; got it tied in bags for us to lug home?\" called Mr. Simms, jocularly.  \"Mr. Simms, you needn't worry over that gold as long as there is something worse to trouble you. What is it?\" answered Polly.  \"Ha, ha, ha! Poll must be feeling lonesome; when she talks like this, it's a sure sign she needs jolly company,\" replied the lawyer.  \"Maybe she thought we were chewed up by the grizzlies,\" added Mr. Brewster, forcing a gayety similar to that of Mr. Simms.  \"What's the matter with you men? Is there any danger from the fire?\" demanded Polly.  \"No, the fire's burning over the down-slope on the other side. You know it won't come this way,\" returned Mrs. Brewster.  \"Well, then--where are the other men? Did those drunken miners shoot any one?\" persisted the girl.  \"Don't bother with questions, Polly. Let us get some supper before we think of anything else,\" advised her mother.  Mike was soon busy unpacking the outfit for cooking, and Mrs. Brewster joined him to give any assistance he might need. Polly went over to her father to try and get more satisfactory information from him, regarding that day's experiences.  \"Did you say the miners who came up ahead of us to-day were in Bill's custody, Daddy?\"  \"Ah didn't say anything; but now Ah'll _tell_ you-all that they are shipped safely to a place where they can do no harm.\"  \"Oh! Did Bill go down the Trail with them?\" continued Polly.  \"No, Bill's man went down-trail to watch in case of any new trouble.\"  \"See here, father! Out with your secret! What are you-all keeping from me?\" asked Polly, anxiously.  \"Good gracious, Poll! Can't a man feel riled after such a wearing day and with nothing to eat, without his women-folks asking plaguey questions?\" cried Mr. Brewster, testily.  Polly was silenced for the moment, but she went out to the ledge where her mother was helping Mike, and there she began again.  \"Mother, I know something unusual concerns you-all, so you may as well confide in me.\"  \"I reckon the men are vexed because we lost all this day hunting up those wretched miners who must have accidentally set the fire going on the other side,\" was all the reply Polly received.  Mike glanced up to look covertly at Mrs. Brewster and the inquisitive girl caught his expression.  \"Even Mike is laughing at the poor way in which you are fencing with me. Now treat me as if I were sensible--not like a baby, or like Bob!\" demanded Polly.  \"Well, to tell the truth, Polly, I'm afraid to tell you everything. If those girls know they will go clean daffy,\" sighed Mrs. Brewster, passing her hand over a troubled brow.  \"Mother! Did I go daffy when that blizzard carried Choko over the ledge--and what did I do up on Grizzly when the snow and ice covered the trail? Did I lose my nerve?\"  At that moment Mr. Simms called out to Mike: \"'Most done cookin', Mike? Ah want you-all to go with me to ketch a grizzly afore it is too dark to see him. Ah promised mah wife she should have a bear-skin rug this trip.\"  Mike looked at Mrs. Brewster who nodded for him to go. She calmly took the ladle and continued stirring the soup that the Indian had been attending to, then Mike hurried after Simms.  \"There now--I know it is something serious and it is much better for me to _know_ what may happen than to have it come upon me like a thunder-bolt,\" said Polly.  \"Well, then, keep on stirring this broth while I busy myself over the rest of the supper, and I'll tell you. Don't exclaim, or show any shock. It is important for us to keep cool,\" advised Mrs. Brewster, as she toasted some dry bread over the embers.  \"I wasn't present when this occurred but father told me. The men found the miner who had been shot, and down the slope further on, they saw the forms of the other two. But the panic-stricken horses that had been hobbled and left to graze, were so frightened at the clouds of smoke and crackling fire, that a few of the men had to lead them back to a clear place. There they were tied securely to some trees.  \"Your father, Bill, and one of his men, jumped down the steep sides where the fire was raging, and began to beat out the flames. They could see the two drunken miners just beyond the fire-line down the trail, but they seemed so overcome with whisky and smoke that they failed to respond to any shouts from the men, or to the fear of the on-driving fire.  \"Our men had beaten out the ground-fire half-way to the miners, when a terrific rumbling sounded, as from a distance behind them. Bill's man was far in advance of the other two rescuers, and perhaps, the crackling on the ground and the raging fire in the trees overhead, deafened him to this other portentous sound.  \"Father, however, felt that it meant something more terrible than a fire, so he shouted to Bill and tried to warn the man. But a fit of coughing from inhaling the smoke, cut his call short. Bill then cried, 'Go on back, Sam--I'll get my man!'  \"So your father managed to force his way back towards the Top Trail. There he saw a great white cloud swooping down from the peak of Grizzly Slide. He turned, screamed at Bill and waved his arms to warn them out of the track of the avalanche, if possible. Bill and his man saw this new danger and turned"]]]
