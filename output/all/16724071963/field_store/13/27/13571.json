This last poor drop of comfort may not be?       PAUL.      The cup is poisoned both for me and thee!       SEV.      The flower is gone--I cherish but the root!       PAUL.      Untimely blossom bears a fated fruit!       SEV.      My grief be mine! Let memory remain!       PAUL.      That grief might hope beget, so leave a stain!       SEV.      Not mine to stain what Heaven hath made so pure!      For me one offering left: 'tis this: Endure!      Thy glory shall be mine, my load I bear,      So, spotless, thou thy peerless crown shalt wear!      Farewell, my love, farewell; I go to prove my faith,      To bless, to save thy life, so will I mate with death!      If prostrate from the blow, there yet remains of life      Enough to summon death, and end the piteous strife!       PAUL.      My grief, too deep for voice, shall silent be,      There, in my chamber, will I pray for thee!      When thou art gone, great Heaven shall hear my cry;      Grief's fruit for thee be hope--death--immortality!       SEV.      Now with my loss alone let Fate contented be.      May Heaven shower bliss and peace on Polyeucte and thee!       PAUL.      Stern Fate obeyed, end, Death, his agony,      And Jove receive my hero--to the sky!       SEV.      _Thou wast_ my heaven!       PAUL.      My father I obeyed--       SEV.      O victim pure, obedient, undismayed!      Pauline--too fair--too dear--I can no more!       PAUL.      So must I say--depart--where I adore!       (Exit Severus.)       STRAT.      Yes, it is hard--most sad--behold my tears!      But now, at least, there is no cause for fears:      Thy dream is but a dream--is naught, is vain;      Severus pardons. Gone that cause for pain!       PAUL.      Oh, if from pity start thy easy tear,      Add not that other woe--forgotten fear!      Ah! let me breathe, some respite give from trouble,      Those fears, half-dead, thou dost revive, redouble!       STRAT.      What dost thou dread?       PAUL.      Heaven--hell--earth--empty air!      All, all is food for dread to my despair,      As thou unveil'st, begirt in lurid light,      The pallid ghost that slew me in the night!       STRAT.      Severus he by name, yet noble in his heart!       PAUL.      Ah, Polyeucte bathed in blood! Depart! depart!       STRAT.      For Polyeucte's welfare did Severus pray!       PAUL.      Yes, yes, his heart is great; be that my stay!      Yet, tho' his truth, his faith, well-proved be,      Most baleful is his presence here to me;      Yea, tho' he would all ill for me undo      Yet he hath power, he loves--he came to woo.       (Enter Polyeucte and Nearchus.)       POLY.      The source of tears is dry, oh, weep no more,      Thy grief lay down, thy fearful heart restore!      Let night's dark dream with superstition die,      The dream is past, for here in life am I!       PAUL.      The day is young, and oh, the day is long,--      And half the dream is true, and Fate is strong;      Severus have I seen, who thought him dead!       POLY.      I know it! Let no tear for this be shed!      Secure with thee am I! Tho' great the knight,      Thy father will command to do me right;      The general is a man of honour,--he      Would ne'er that honour dim by treachery!      He comes in amity, our friend, our guest;      To greet his worth and valour now my quest.       PAUL.      Radiant he came, who left me hopeless, sad,      But he will come no more,--this grace I had.       POLY.      What? Thinkest thou that I can jealous be?       PAUL.      An outrage this on him, on thee, on me!      He came in peace, who all my peace hath marred.      Who would run safely, every step must guard;      The wife who danger courts but courts her fall      My husband, aid me!--I would tell thee all!      His worth, his charm, do my weak hearth enflame      A traitor here! And he is aye the same!      If I should gaze, and long--'gainst virtue, honour, sense,      The citadel I yield, and mine my own defence!      I know my virtues sure, and fair my fame,      But struggle is defeat,--and combat shame!       POLY.      Oh, true thy shield, thy victory is won,      He only who has lost thee is undone;      His noble grief the cost of all my bliss,      Ah, Cleopatra's pearl was naught to this!      The more my faults I see, the more thy truth I learn,      The more do I admire----       (Enter Cleon.)       CLEON.      My lord, the altars burn      With holy fire. The victim they prepare;      On thee alone they wait, our rites to share.       POLY.      Go, we do follow thee!       PAUL.      I cannot go;      Severus flies my sight; to him I owe      My absence--not, alas! to him alone!      Go thou, and oh, remember he is great;      In his sole hands Severus holds thy fate!       POLY.      A foe so great, so noble, is a friend,      Oh, not from him the lance that Heaven will send!       Exeunt Pauline, Stratonice and Cleon.       NEAR.      Where go'st thou?       POLY.      To the temple is the call.       NEAR.      What! Wouldst thou mingle in their heathen brawl?      Thou art a Christian, and canst thou forget?       POLY.      Canst _thou_, who fore mine eyes the cross didst set?       NEAR.      Not mine their gods!       POLY.      He calls me! I must go!       NEAR.      I fly their altars!       POLY.      I would overthrow!      Not mine to fly a worship I disown,      By me Jehovah, King of kings, be known!      Not mine to tremble as I kiss the rod!      I conquer by the Cross, I fight for God!      Thou wouldst abstain! For me another course      From Heaven the call, and Heaven will give the force!      What! Yield to evil! His Cross on my brow!      His freemen we! O fight, Nearchus, now!      For us our Lord was scourged, pierced, tortured, slain!      For us He bled! Say, has He died in vain?       NEAR.      Let timely moderation temper zeal!       POLY.      His--His alone am I! His woe my weal!       NEAR.      In love with death?       POLY.      For Him I love I die!      He died for me! So death is victory!       NEAR.      Thy flesh is weak!       POLY.      Yet He will make me bold!       NEAR.      And if thou waver?       POLY.      He will me uphold!       NEAR.      To tempt the Lord thy God were an offence.       POLY.      He is my shield--hence! cursed tempter, hence!       NEAR.      In time of need the faith must be confessed.       POLY.      The offering grudged is sacrifice unblessed.       NEAR.      Seek thou the death thine own self-will prepares!       POLY.      A crown I seek, which every martyr shares!       NEAR.      A life of duty well that crown can win.       POLY.      The purest life on earth is stained with sin.      Why yield to time and chance what death assures?      Death but the gate of life that aye endures.      If I be His--let me be His alone!      The faith that soars shall full fruition own;      Who trusts, yet fears and doubts, his faith is dead!       NEAR.      Not death the Christian's prayer, but daily bread.      Live to protect the flock, so sore oppressed.       POLY.      Example be their friend, most sure, most blessed!       NEAR.      Thou woo'st thy death!       POLY.      Is this poor life so dear?       NEAR.      Ah, I must own my heart is slave to fear.      The rack! The cross! I might my Lord disown!       POLY.      From Him our help, our strength, from Him alone!      Who fears denial does at heart deny;      Who doubts the power of faith makes faith a lie!       NEAR.      Who leans upon a reed shall find distress.       POLY.      His staff will guide, support my feebleness.      Thou wert my staff, to show the Truth, the Way,      Must I now urge thee to the realms of day?      Thou fearest death?       NEAR.      The Christ once feared to die!       POLY.      Yet drained the bitter cup of agony!      The way that thou hast shown--that way He trod;      His way be ours to lead man's soul to God--      For heathen shrine--to rear His altar fair,--      The deathless hope alone can kill despair!      Thou said'st: 'If Him thou wilt for pattern take,      Then leave wife, wealth, home, all for His dear sake!'      Alas, that love of thine, now weak and poor,      Glows yet within my breast--and shall endure;      Ah, must the dawn of this my perfect day      Find thy full light beclouded, dimmed, astray?       NEAR.      Baptismal waters yet bedew thy brow;      The grace that once was mine, that grace hast thou.      No worldly thought has checked the flow, no guilty act has stained;      Thy wings are strong, while mine are weak; thy love is fresh,           ungeigned,--      To these, thy heights, I cannot soar, held down by sense and sin,      How can I storm the citadel?--the traitor lurks within!      Forsake me not, my God! Thy spirit pour!      Oh, make me true to Him whom I adore!      With Thee I rise,--the flesh, the world, defy,      Thou, who hast died for me, for Thee I die!      Yes, I will go! With heaven-born zeal I burn,      I will be free,--all Satan's lures I spurn;      Death, torture, outrage, these will I embrace,      To nerve my heart and arm, Heaven grant me grace!       POLY.      On eagle wings of faith and hope ascend!      I hail my master--recognise my friend;      The old faith wanes,--we light her funeral pyre,      Her ashes fall before our holy fire;      Come, trample under foot the gods that men have wrought;      The rotten, helpless staff is broke, is gone--is naught.      Their darkness felt they own, but let them see the light!      Their gods of stone, of clay, but vampires of the night!      Their dust shall turn to dust,--shall moulder with the sod,      Ours for His name to fight:--the issue is with God.       NEAR.      The cause is just, is true--O coward heart, be still!      I lived to doubt His word--I die to do His Will!     ACT III--PAULINE       PAUL.    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2543"],["title","Polyeucte (#4)"],["body","  Cares--clouded and confused--oppress, obscure      In changeful forms, my eye, my heart, my mind:      My soul finds room for every guest save one;      Fair hope has flown,--no star can pierce my night:      Each tyrant rages 'gainst opposing foe      In deadly fight--yet brings to light no friend:      In travail sore hope comes not to the birth--      Fear hydra-headed terror still begets;--      All fancies grim I see, and straight embrace,      At hope I clutch, who still eludes my grasp;      Her rainbow hues adored are but a frame      That serve by contrast to make fear more dark.      Severus haunts me--oh, I know his love,      Yet hopeless love must mate with jealousy,--      While Polyeucte, who has won what he has lost,      Can meet no rival with an equal eye.      The fruit of rivalry is ever hate      And envy; both must still engender strife:      One sees that rival hand has grasped his prize,      The other yearns for prize himself has missed.      Weak reason naught, when headlong passion reigns,      For valour seeks a sword, and love--revenge.      One fears to see the prize he gained impaired,      The other would that wrested prize regain;      While patience, duty, conscience, vail their heads      'Fore obstinate defence and fierce attack.      Such steeds no charioteer controls--for they      Mistake both curb and reign for maddening whip.      Ah! what a base, unworthy fear is mine!      How ill I read these fair, these noble souls,      Whose virtue must all common snares o'erleap!      Their gold unstained by dross or mean alloy!      As generous foes so will they--must they meet!      Yet are they rivals--this the thought that kills!      Not even here--at home--is Polyeucte safe,      The eagle wings of Rome reach over all.      Oh, if my father bow to Roman might,      If he repent the choice that he hath made,--      At this one thought hope's flame leaps up to die!      Or--if new-born--dies ere she see the light.      Hope but deceived,--my fear alone I trust,      Heaven grant such confidence be false--be vain!       (Enter Stratonice.)       Nay, let me know the worst! What, girl!--no word?      The rites are o'er? What hast thou seen--what heard?      They met in amity?--In peace they part?       STRAT.      Alas! Alas!       PAUL.      Nay, soothe my aching heart!      I would have comfort,--but this face of woe--      A quarrel?       STRAT.      Polyeucte--Nearchus--go--      The Christians--       PAUL.      What of them?       STRAT.      Ah, how to speak--       PAUL.      They on my father would their vengeance wreak?       STRAT.      Oh, fear whate'er thou wilt--that fear too small!       PAUL.      The Christians rise?       STRAT.      Oh, would that this were all!      Thy dream, Pauline, is true; Polyeucte is----       PAUL.      Dead?       STRAT.      Ah, no, he lives--yet every hope is fled;      That courage once so high, that noble name      Sunk in the mire of everlasting shame!      He lives,--who once was lovely in thy sight--      As monster foul--his every breath a blight;      The foe of Heaven, of Jove, of all our race,      His kisses poison, and his love--disgrace!      Wretch, coward, miscreant, steeped in infamy,      O worse than every name!--a Christian he!       PAUL.      Nay, that one word's enough! There needed not abuse.       STRAT.      My words fit well their guilt;--with evil make no truce.       PAUL.      If _he_ be _Nazarene_--he must an outcast be!      But insult to my lord is insult unto me!       STRAT.      Think only that he hails the Cross, the badge of shame.       PAUL.      My plighted faith, my troth, my duty still the same!       STRAT.      When twined about thy breast, the hideous serpent slay!      Who mocks the Gods on high will his own wife betray!       PAUL.      If he be false, yet I will still be true,      The ties that bind me I will ne'er undo:      Let fate--Severus--passion--all combine      Against him!--I am his, and he is mine.      Yes, mine to guide, lead, win, forgive, and save!      I seek his honour tho' he court the grave.      Let Polyeucte be Christ's slave!--For woe, for weal,      He is my lord; the bond I owe I seal;      I fear my father,--all his vengeance, dread.       STRAT.      Fierce burns his rage o'er that devoted head;      Yet embers of old love still faintly glow,      And through his wrath some weak compassion show;      'Gainst Polyeucte biting words alone he speaks      But on Nearchus fullest vengeance wreaks!       PAUL.      Nearchus lured him on?       STRAT.      The tempter he;      Such friendship leads to death, or infamy.      Oh, cursed friend, who, in dear love's despite,      Has torn him from thine arms--his neophyte!      He dragged him to the front;--baptized, annealed--      He fights for Christ!--The secret is revealed.       PAUL.      Which I would know--and straightway had thy blame!       STRAT.      Ah! I foresaw not this--their deed of shame!       PAUL.      Ere dull despair o'ermaster all my fears,      Oh, let me gauge the worth of woman's tears!      For, if the daughter lose, the wife may gain,--      Or Felix may relent, if Polyeucte mock my pain;      If both are adamant unto my prayer,      Then--then alone--take counsel from despair!      How passed the temple sacrifice? Hide naught, my friend, tell all!       STRAT.      The horror and the sacrilege must I, perforce, recall?      To say the words, to think the thoughts, seems blasphemy and shame;      Yet will I tell their infamy,--their deed without a name.      To silence hushed, the people knelt, and turned them to the East;      Then impious Polyeucte and his friend mock sacrifice and priest.      They every holy name invoked jeer with unbridled tongue,      To laughter vile the incense rose--'tis thus our hymn was sung;      Both loud and deep the murmurs rang, and Felix' face grew pale,      Then Polyeucte mad defiance hurls, while all the people quail.      'Vain are your gods of wood and stone!' his voice was stern           and high--      'Vain every rite, prayer, sacrifice' so ran his blasphemy.      'Your Jupiter is parricide, adulterer, demon, knave,      'He cannot listen to your cry, not his to bless or save.      'One God--Jehovah--rules alone, supreme o'er earth and heaven,      'And ye are His--yes, only His--to Him your prayers be given!      'He is our source, our life, our end,--no other god adore,      'To Him alone all prayer is due, then serve Him evermore!      'Who kneels before a meaner shrine, by devil's power enticed,      'Denies his Maker and his King, denies the Saviour Christ.      'He is our source, our guide, our end, our prophet, priest and           king;      'Twas He that nerved Severus' arm,--His praise let Decius sing.      'Jehovah rules the battle-field ye call the field of Mars,      'He only grants a glorious peace, 'tis He guides all our wars.      'He casts the mighty from his seat, He doth the proud abase,--      'They only peace and blessing know who love and seek His face.      'His sword alone is strong to strike, His shield our only guard.      'He will His bleeding saints avenge, He is their sure reward.      'In vain to Jove and feeble Mars your full libations pour--      'Oh, kneel before the might ye spurn, the God ye mock--adore!'      Then Polyeucte the shrine o'erthrows, the holy vessels breaks,      Nor wrath of Jove, nor Felix' ire, his fatal purpose shakes.      Foredoomed by Fate, the Furies' prey--they rush, they rend,           they tear,      The vessels all to fragments fly--all prone the offerings fair;      And on the front of awful Jove they set their impious feet,      And order fair to chaos turn, and thus their work complete.      Our hallowed mysteries disturbed, our temple dear profaned,      Mad flight and tumult dire let loose, proclaim a God disdained.      Thus pallid fear broods over all, presaging wrath to come,      While Felix--but I mark his step!--'tis he shall speak the doom.       PAUL.      How threatening, how dark his mien! How lightning-fraught his eye!      Where wrath and grief, revenge and pain, do strive for mastery!       (Enter Felix.)       FELIX.      O insolence undreamed!--Before my very eyes!--      Before the people's gaze! It is too much!--he dies!       PAUL.      O father!--on my knees!      (Kneels.)      Unsay that word!       FELIX.      Nearchus' doom I speak,--not his, thy lord.      Though all unworthy he to be my son,      Yet still he bears the name that he hath won;      Nor crime of his nor wrath of mine shall ever move      Thy father's heart to hate the man thou crown'st with love!       PAUL.      Ne'er vainly have I sued for pity from my sire!       FELIX.      And yet meet food were he for righteous ire!      To recount an act so fell my feeble words too weak,      But thou has heard the tale my lips refuse to speak      From her, thy maiden; she hath told thee all.       PAUL.      Nearchus goaded--planned--and he shall fall!       FELIX.      So taught by torture of his vilest friend,      Shall Polyeucte mark of guilt the certain end,      When of the frenzied race he sees the goal,      The dread of torture shall subdue his soul!      Who mocked the thought of death, when death he views,      Will choose an easier mate--and rightly choose.      That shadowy guest, that doth his soul entice,      Once master, glues all ardour into ice,      And that proud heart, which never meekness knew,      When face to face with Death--will learn to sue!       PAUL.      What! Thinkest thou his soul can ever blench?       FELIX.      Death's mighty flood must every furnace quench!       PAUL.      It might! It may!--I know such things can be!      A Polyeucte changed--debased--forsworn I see!      O, changeful Fortune! changeless Polyeucte move,      And grant a boon denied by father's love!       FELIX.      My love too plain--myself too weakly kind,      Let him repent and he"]]]
