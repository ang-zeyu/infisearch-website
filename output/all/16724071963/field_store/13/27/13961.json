Make a note of improvement number one--the sacking of Luella Granville Waterman.\"  \"I guess it'll be followed pretty quick by improvement number two--the sacking of William Windsor. I can't go monkeying about with the paper that way.\"  Psmith reflected for a moment.  \"Has this job of yours any special attractions for you, Comrade Windsor?\"  \"I guess not.\"  \"As I suspected. You yearn for scope. What exactly are your ambitions?\"  \"I want to get a job on one of the big dailies. I don't see how I'm going to fix it, though, at the present rate.\"  Psmith rose, and tapped him earnestly on the chest.  \"Comrade Windsor, you have touched the spot. You are wasting the golden hours of your youth. You must move. You must hustle. You must make Windsor of _Cosy Moments_ a name to conjure with. You must boost this sheet up till New York rings with your exploits. On the present lines that is impossible. You must strike out a line for yourself. You must show the world that even _Cosy Moments_ cannot keep a good man down.\"  He resumed his seat.  \"How do you mean?\" said Billy Windsor.  Psmith turned to Mike.  \"Comrade Jackson, if you were editing this paper, is there a single feature you would willingly retain?\"  \"I don't think there is,\" said Mike. \"It's all pretty bad rot.\"  \"My opinion in a nutshell,\" said Psmith, approvingly. \"Comrade Jackson,\" he explained, turning to Billy, \"has a secure reputation on the other side for the keenness and lucidity of his views upon literature. You may safely build upon him. In England when Comrade Jackson says 'Turn' we all turn. Now, my views on the matter are as follows. _Cosy Moments_, in my opinion (worthless, were it not backed by such a virtuoso as Comrade Jackson), needs more snap, more go. All these putrid pages must disappear. Letters must be despatched to-morrow morning, informing Luella Granville Waterman and the others (and in particular B. Henderson Asher, who from a cursory glance strikes me as an ideal candidate for a lethal chamber) that, unless they cease their contributions instantly, you will be compelled to place yourself under police protection. After that we can begin to move.\"  Billy Windsor sat and rocked himself in his chair without replying. He was trying to assimilate this idea. So far the grandeur of it had dazed him. It was too spacious, too revolutionary. Could it be done? It would undoubtedly mean the sack when Mr. J. Fillken Wilberfloss returned and found the apple of his eye torn asunder and, so to speak, deprived of its choicest pips. On the other hand . . . His brow suddenly cleared. After all, what was the sack? One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name, and he would have no name as long as he clung to his present position. The editor would be away ten weeks. He would have ten weeks in which to try himself out. Hope leaped within him. In ten weeks he could change _Cosy Moments_ into a real live paper. He wondered that the idea had not occurred to him before. The trifling fact that the despised journal was the property of Mr. Benjamin White, and that he had no right whatever to tinker with it without that gentleman's approval, may have occurred to him, but, if it did, it occurred so momentarily that he did not notice it. In these crises one cannot think of everything.  \"I'm on,\" he said, briefly.  Psmith smiled approvingly.  \"That,\" he said, \"is the right spirit. You will, I fancy, have little cause to regret your decision. Fortunately, if I may say so, I happen to have a certain amount of leisure just now. It is at your disposal. I have had little experience of journalistic work, but I foresee that I shall be a quick learner. I will become your sub-editor, without salary.\"  \"Bully for you,\" said Billy Windsor.  \"Comrade Jackson,\" continued Psmith, \"is unhappily more fettered. The exigencies of his cricket tour will compel him constantly to be gadding about, now to Philadelphia, now to Saskatchewan, anon to Onehorseville, Ga. His services, therefore, cannot be relied upon continuously. From him, accordingly, we shall expect little but moral support. An occasional congratulatory telegram. Now and then a bright smile of approval. The bulk of the work will devolve upon our two selves.\"  \"Let it devolve,\" said Billy Windsor, enthusiastically.  \"Assuredly,\" said Psmith. \"And now to decide upon our main scheme. You, of course, are the editor, and my suggestions are merely suggestions, subject to your approval. But, briefly, my idea is that _Cosy Moments_ should become red-hot stuff. I could wish its tone to be such that the public will wonder why we do not print it on asbestos. We must chronicle all the live events of the day, murders, fires, and the like in a manner which will make our readers' spines thrill. Above all, we must be the guardians of the People's rights. We must be a search-light, showing up the dark spot in the souls of those who would endeavour in any way to do the PEOPLE in the eye. We must detect the wrong-doer, and deliver him such a series of resentful buffs that he will abandon his little games and become a model citizen. The details of the campaign we must think out after, but I fancy that, if we follow those main lines, we shall produce a bright, readable little sheet which will in a measure make this city sit up and take notice. Are you with me, Comrade Windsor?\"  \"Surest thing you know,\" said Billy with fervour.    CHAPTER VI  THE TENEMENTS  To alter the scheme of a weekly from cover to cover is not a task that is completed without work. The dismissal of _Cosy Moments_' entire staff of contributors left a gap in the paper which had to be filled, and owing to the nearness of press day there was no time to fill it before the issue of the next number. The editorial staff had to be satisfied with heading every page with the words \"Look out! Look out!! Look out!!! See foot of page!!!!\" printing in the space at the bottom the legend, \"Next Week! See Editorial!\" and compiling in conjunction a snappy editorial, setting forth the proposed changes. This was largely the work of Psmith.  \"Comrade Jackson,\" he said to Mike, as they set forth one evening in search of their new flat, \"I fancy I have found my metier. Commerce, many considered, was the line I should take; and doubtless, had I stuck to that walk in life, I should soon have become a financial magnate. But something seemed to whisper to me, even in the midst of my triumphs in the New Asiatic Bank, that there were other fields. For the moment it seems to me that I have found the job for which nature specially designed me. At last I have Scope. And without Scope, where are we? Wedged tightly in among the ribstons. There are some very fine passages in that editorial. The last paragraph, beginning '_Cosy Moments_ cannot be muzzled,' in particular. I like it. It strikes the right note. It should stir the blood of a free and independent people till they sit in platoons on the doorstep of our office, waiting for the next number to appear.\"  \"How about that next number?\" asked Mike. \"Are you and Windsor going to fill the whole paper yourselves?\"  \"By no means. It seems that Comrade Windsor knows certain stout fellows, reporters on other papers, who will be delighted to weigh in with stuff for a moderate fee.\"  \"How about Luella What's-her-name and the others? How have they taken it?\"  \"Up to the present we have no means of ascertaining. The letters giving them the miss-in-baulk in no uncertain voice were only despatched yesterday. But it cannot affect us how they writhe beneath the blow. There is no reprieve.\"  Mike roared with laughter.  \"It's the rummiest business I ever struck,\" he said. \"I'm jolly glad it's not my paper. It's pretty lucky for you two lunatics that the proprietor's in Europe.\"  Psmith regarded him with pained surprise.  \"I do not understand you, Comrade Jackson. Do you insinuate that we are not acting in the proprietor's best interests? When he sees the receipts, after we have handled the paper for a while, he will go singing about his hotel. His beaming smile will be a by-word in Carlsbad. Visitors will be shown it as one of the sights. His only doubt will be whether to send his money to the bank or keep it in tubs and roll in it. We are on to a big thing, Comrade Jackson. Wait till you see our first number.\"  \"And how about the editor? I should think that first number would bring him back foaming at the mouth.\"  \"I have ascertained from Comrade Windsor that there is nothing to fear from that quarter. By a singular stroke of good fortune Comrade Wilberfloss--his name is Wilberfloss--has been ordered complete rest during his holiday. The kindly medico, realising the fearful strain inflicted by reading _Cosy Moments_ in its old form, specifically mentioned that the paper was to be withheld from him until he returned.\"  \"And when he does return, what are you going to do?\"  \"By that time, doubtless, the paper will be in so flourishing a state that he will confess how wrong his own methods were and adopt ours without a murmur. In the meantime, Comrade Jackson, I would call your attention to the fact that we seem to have lost our way. In the exhilaration of this little chat, our footsteps have wandered. Where we are, goodness only knows. I can only say that I shouldn't care to have to live here.\"  \"There's a name up on the other side of that lamp-post.\"  \"Let us wend in that direction. Ah, Pleasant Street? I fancy that the master-mind who chose that name must have had the rudiments of a sense of humour.\"  It was indeed a repellent neighbourhood in which they had arrived. The New York slum stands in a class of its own. It is unique. The height of the houses and the narrowness of the streets seem to condense its unpleasantness. All the smells and noises, which are many and varied, are penned up in a sort of canyon, and gain in vehemence from the fact. The masses of dirty clothes hanging from the fire-e"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],["title","Psmith, Journalist (#5)"],["body","increase the depression. Nowhere in the city does one realise so fully the disadvantages of a lack of space. New York, being an island, has had no room to spread. It is a town of human sardines. In the poorer quarters the congestion is unbelievable.  Psmith and Mike picked their way through the groups of ragged children who covered the roadway. There seemed to be thousands of them.  \"Poor kids!\" said Mike. \"It must be awful living in a hole like this.\"  Psmith said nothing. He was looking thoughtful. He glanced up at the grimy buildings on each side. On the lower floors one could see into dark, bare rooms. These were the star apartments of the tenement-houses, for they opened on to the street, and so got a little light and air. The imagination jibbed at the thought of the back rooms.  \"I wonder who owns these places,\" said Psmith. \"It seems to me that there's what you might call room for improvement. It wouldn't be a scaly idea to turn that _Cosy Moments_ search-light we were talking about on to them.\"  They walked on a few steps.  \"Look here,\" said Psmith, stopping. \"This place makes me sick. I'm going in to have a look round. I expect some muscular householder will resent the intrusion and boot us out, but we'll risk it.\"  Followed by Mike, he turned in at one of the doors. A group of men leaning against the opposite wall looked at them without curiosity. Probably they took them for reporters hunting for a story. Reporters were the only tolerably well-dressed visitors Pleasant Street ever entertained.  It was almost pitch dark on the stairs. They had to feel their way up. Most of the doors were shut but one on the second floor was ajar. Through the opening they had a glimpse of a number of women sitting round on boxes. The floor was covered with little heaps of linen. All the women were sewing. Mike, stumbling in the darkness, almost fell against the door. None of the women looked up at the noise. Time was evidently money in Pleasant Street.  On the fourth floor there was an open door. The room was empty. It was a good representative Pleasant Street back room. The architect in this case had given rein to a passion for originality. He had constructed the room without a window of any sort whatsoever. There was a square opening in the door. Through this, it was to be presumed, the entire stock of air used by the occupants was supposed to come.  They stumbled downstairs again and out into the street. By contrast with the conditions indoors the street seemed spacious and breezy.  \"This,\" said Psmith, as they walked on, \"is where _Cosy Moments_ gets busy at a singularly early date.\"  \"What are you going to do?\" asked Mike.  \"I propose, Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith, \"if Comrade Windsor is agreeable, to make things as warm for the owner of this place as I jolly well know how. What he wants, of course,\" he proceeded in the tone of a family doctor prescribing for a patient, \"is disembowelling. I fancy, however, that a mawkishly sentimental legislature will prevent our performing that national service. We must endeavour to do what we can by means of kindly criticism in the paper. And now, having settled that important point, let us try and get out of this place of wrath, and find Fourth Avenue.\"    CHAPTER VII  VISITORS AT THE OFFICE  On the following morning Mike had to leave with the team for Philadelphia. Psmith came down to the ferry to see him off, and hung about moodily until the time of departure.  \"It is saddening me to a great extent, Comrade Jackson,\" he said, \"this perpetual parting of the ways. When I think of the happy moments we have spent hand-in-hand across the seas, it fills me with a certain melancholy to have you flitting off in this manner without me. Yet there is another side to the picture. To me there is something singularly impressive in our unhesitating reply to the calls of Duty. Your Duty summons you to Philadelphia, to knock the cover off the local bowling. Mine retains me here, to play my part in the great work of making New York sit up. By the time you return, with a century or two, I trust, in your bag, the good work should, I fancy, be getting something of a move on. I will complete the arrangements with regard to the flat.\"  After leaving Pleasant Street they had found Fourth Avenue by a devious route, and had opened negotiations for a large flat near Thirtieth Street. It was immediately above a saloon, which was something of a drawback, but the landlord had assured them that the voices of the revellers did not penetrate to it.              *    *    *  When the ferry-boat had borne Mike off across the river, Psmith turned to stroll to the office of _Cosy Moments_. The day was fine, and on the whole, despite Mike's desertion, he felt pleased with life. Psmith's was a nature which required a certain amount of stimulus in the way of gentle excitement; and it seemed to him that the conduct of the remodelled _Cosy Moments_ might supply this. He liked Billy Windsor, and looked forward to a not unenjoyable time till Mike should return.  The offices of _Cosy Moments_ were in a large building in the street off Madison Avenue. They consisted of a sort of outer lair, where Pugsy Maloney spent his time reading tales of life in the prairies and heading off undesirable visitors; a small room, which would have belonged to the stenographer if _Cosy Moments_ had possessed one; and a larger room beyond, which was the editorial sanctum.  As Psmith passed through the front door, Pugsy Maloney rose.  \"Say!\" said Master Maloney.  \"Say on, Comrade Maloney,\" said Psmith.  \"Dey're in dere.\"  \"Who, precisely?\"  \"A whole bunch of dem.\"  Psmith inspected Master Maloney through his eye-glass. \"Can you give me any particulars?\" he asked patiently. \"You are well-meaning, but vague, Comrade Maloney. Who are in there?\"  \"De whole bunch of dem. Dere's Mr. Asher and the Rev. Philpotts and a gazebo what calls himself Waterman and about 'steen more of dem.\"  A faint smile appeared upon Psmith's face.  \"And is Comrade Windsor in there, too, in the middle of them?\"  \"Nope. Mr. Windsor's out to lunch.\"  \"Comrade Windsor knows his business. Why did you let them in?\"  \"Sure, dey just butted in,\" said Master Maloney complainingly. \"I was sittin' here, readin' me book, when de foist of de guys blew in. 'Boy,' says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,' I says. 'I'll go in an' wait,' says he. 'Nuttin' doin',' says I. 'Nix on de goin' in act.' I might as well have saved me breat'. In he butts, and he's in der now. Well, in about t'ree minutes along comes another gazebo. 'Boy,' says he, 'is de editor in?' 'Nope,' I says. 'I'll wait,' says he lightin' out for de door. Wit dat I sees de proposition's too fierce for muh. I can't keep dese big husky guys out if dey's for buttin' in. So when de rest of de bunch comes along, I don't try to give dem de t'run down. I says, 'Well, gents,' I says, 'it's up to youse. De editor ain't in, but if youse wants to join de giddy t'rong, push t'roo inter de inner room. I can't be boddered.'\"  \"And what more _could_ you have said?\" agreed Psmith approvingly. \"Tell me, Comrade Maloney, what was the general average aspect of these determined spirits?\"  \"Huh?\"  \"Did they seem to you to be gay, lighthearted? Did they carol snatches of song as they went? Or did they appear to be looking for some one with a hatchet?\"  \"Dey was hoppin'-mad, de whole bunch of dem.\"  \"As I suspected. But we must not repine, Comrade Maloney. These trifling contretemps are the penalties we pay for our high journalistic aims. I will interview these merchants. I fancy that with the aid of the Diplomatic Smile and the Honeyed Word I may manage to pull through. It is as well, perhaps, that Comrade Windsor is out. The situation calls for the handling of a man of delicate culture and nice tact. Comrade Windsor would probably have endeavoured to clear the room with a chair. If he should arrive during the seance, Comrade Maloney, be so good as to inform him of the state of affairs, and tell him not to come in. Give him my compliments, and tell him to go out and watch the snowdrops growing in Madison Square Garden.\"  \"Sure,\" said Master Maloney.  Then Psmith, having smoothed the nap of his hat and flicked a speck of dust from his coat-sleeve, walked to the door of the inner room and went in.    CHAPTER VIII  THE HONEYED WORD  Master Maloney's statement that \"about 'steen visitors\" had arrived in addition to Messrs. Asher, Waterman, and the Rev. Philpotts proved to have been due to a great extent to a somewhat feverish imagination. There were only five men in the room.  As Psmith entered, every eye was turned upon him. To an outside spectator he would have seemed rather like a very well-dressed Daniel introduced into a den of singularly irritable lions. Five pairs of eyes were smouldering with a long-nursed resentment. Five brows were corrugated with wrathful lines. Such, however, was the simple majesty of Psmith's demeanour that for a moment there was dead silence. Not a word was spoken as he paced, wrapped in thought, to the editorial chair. Stillness brooded over the room as he carefully dusted that piece of furniture, and, having done so to his satisfaction, hitched up the knees of his trousers and sank gracefully into a sitting position.  This accomplished, he looked up and started. He gazed round the room.  \"Ha! I am observed!\" he murmured.  The words broke the spell. Instantly, the five visitors burst simultaneously into speech.  \"Are you the acting editor of this paper?\"  \"I wish to have a word with you, sir.\"  \"Mr. Windsor, I presume?\"  \"Pardon me!\"  \"I should like a few moments' conversation.\"  The start was good and even; but the gentleman who said \"Pardon me!\" necessarily finished first with the rest nowhere.  Psmith turned to him, bowed, and fixed him with a benevolent gaze through his eye-glass.  \"Are you Mr. Windsor, sir, may I ask?\" inquired the favoured one.  The others paused for the reply.  \"Alas! no,\" said Psmith"]]]
