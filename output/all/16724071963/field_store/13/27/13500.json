[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25274"],["title","Rollo at Work (#4)"],["body"," having sorted a few, it would become tedious and tiresome work, doing it there all alone in the barn,--picking out old nails, with nobody to help him, and nobody to talk to, and nothing to see, but those little heaps of rusty iron on the floor.  This, I say, was the real trouble; and Rollo’s father knew, when he set his little boy about it, that he would soon get very tired of it, and, not being accustomed to any thing but play, would not persevere.  And so it was. Rollo sorted out a few, and then he began to think that it was rather tiresome to be there all alone; and he thought it would be a good plan for him to go and ask his father to let him go and get his cousin James to come and help him.  He accordingly laid down the nails he had in his hand, and went into the house, and found his father writing at a table.  “What is the matter now?” said his father.  “Why, father,” said Rollo, “I thought I should like to have James come and help me, if you are willing;--we can get them done so much quicker if there are two.”  “But my great object is, not to get the nails sorted very quick, but to teach you patient industry. I know it is tiresome for you to be alone, but that is the very reason why I wish you to be alone. I want you to learn to persevere patiently in doing any thing, even if it is tiresome. What I want to teach you is, to _work_, not to _play_.”  Rollo felt disappointed, but he saw that his father was right, and he went slowly back to his task. He sorted out two or three handfuls more, but he found there was no pleasure in it, and he began to be very sorry his father had set him at it.  Having no heart for his work, he did not go on with alacrity, and of course made very slow progress. He ought to have gone rapidly forward, and not thought any thing about the pleasantness or unpleasantness of it, but only been anxious to finish the work, and please his father. Instead of that, he only lounged over it--looked at the heap of nails, and sighed to think how large it was. He could not sort all those, possibly, he said. He knew he could not. It would take him forever.  Still he could not think of any excuse for leaving his work again, until, after a little while, he came upon a couple of screws. “And now what shall I do with these?” said he.  He took the screws, and laid them side by side, to measure them, so as to see which was the largest. Then he rolled them about a little, and after playing with them for a little time, during which, of course, his work was entirely neglected, he concluded he would go and ask his father what he was to do with screws.  He accordingly walked slowly along to the house, stopping to look at the grasshoppers and butterflies by the way. After wasting some time in this manner, he appeared again at his father’s table, and wanted to know what he should do with the _screws_ that he found among the nails.  “You ought not to have left your work to come and ask that question,” said his father. “I am afraid you are not doing very well. I gave you all the necessary instructions. Go back to your work.”  “But, father,” said Rollo, “as he went out, I do not know what I am to do with the screws. You did not say any thing about screws.”  “Then why do you leave your work to ask me any thing about them?”  “Why,--because,--” said Rollo, hesitating. He did not know what to say.  “Your work is to sort out the _nails_, and I expect, by your coming to me for such frivolous reasons, that you are not going on with it very well.”  Rollo went slowly out of the room, and sauntered along back to his work. He put the screws aside, and went on with the nails, but he did very little. When the heart is not in the work, it always goes on very slowly.  Thus an hour or two of the forenoon passed away, and Rollo made very little progress. At last his father came out to see what he had done; and it was very plain that he had been idling away his time, and had accomplished very little indeed.  His father then said that he might leave his work and come in. Rollo walked along by the side of his father, and he said to him--  “I see, Rollo, that I shall not succeed in teaching you to work industriously, without something more than kind words.”  Rollo knew not what to say, and so he was silent. He felt guilty and ashamed.  “I gave you work to do which was very easy and plain, but you have been leaving it repeatedly for frivolous reasons; and even while you were over your work, you have not been industrious. Thus you have wasted your morning entirely; you have neither done work nor enjoyed play.  “I was afraid it would be so,” he continued. “Very few boys can be taught to work industriously, without being compelled; though I hoped that my little Rollo could have been. But as it is, as I find that persuasion will not do, I must do something more decided. I should do very wrong to let you grow up an idle boy; and it is time for you to begin to learn to do something besides play.”  He said this in a kind, but very serious tone, and it was plain he was much displeased. He told Rollo, a minute or two after, that he might go, then, where he pleased, and that he would consider what he should do, and tell him some other time.     A Conversation.   That evening, when Rollo was just going to bed, his father took him up in his lap, and told him he had concluded what to do.  “You see it is very necessary,” said he, “that you should have the power of confining yourself steadily and patiently to a single employment, even if it does not amuse you. _I_ have to do that, and all people have to do it, and you must learn to do it, or you will grow up indolent and useless. You cannot do it now, it is very plain. If I set you to doing any thing, you go on as long as the novelty and the amusement last, and then your patience is gone, and you contrive every possible excuse for getting away from your task. Now, I am going to give you one hour’s work to do, every forenoon and afternoon. I shall give you such things to do, as are perfectly plain and easy, so that you will have no excuse for neglecting your work or leaving it. But yet I shall choose such things as will afford you no amusement; for I want you to learn to _work_, not play.”  “But, father,” said Rollo, “you told me there was pleasure in work, the other day. But how can there be any pleasure in it, if you choose such things as have no amusement in them, at all?”  “The pleasure of working,” said his father, “is not the fun of doing amusing things, but the satisfaction and solid happiness of being faithful in duty, and accomplishing some useful purpose. For example, if I were to lose my pocket-book on the road, and should tell you to walk back a mile, and look carefully all the way until you found it, and if you did it faithfully and carefully, you would find a kind of satisfaction in doing it; and when you found the pocket-book, and brought it back to me, you would enjoy a high degree of happiness. Should not you?”  “Why, yes, sir, I should,” said Rollo.  “And yet there would be no _amusement_ in it. You might, perhaps, the next day, go over the same road, catching butterflies: that would be amusement. Now, the pleasure you would enjoy in looking for the pocket-book, would be the solid satisfaction of useful work. The pleasure of catching butterflies would be the amusement of play. Now, the difficulty is, with you, that you have scarcely any idea, yet, of the first. You are all the time looking for the other, that is, the amusement. You begin to work when I give you any thing to do, but if you do not find _amusement_ in it, you soon give it up. But if you would only persevere, you would find, at length, a solid satisfaction, that would be worth a great deal more.”  Rollo sat still, and listened, but his father saw, from his looks, that he was not much interested in what he was saying; and he perceived that it was not at all probable that so small a boy could be _reasoned_ into liking work. In fact, it was rather hard for Rollo to understand all that his father said,--and still harder for him to feel the force of it. He began to grow sleepy, and so his father let him go to bed.     Rollo Learns to Work at Last.   The next day his father gave him his work. He was to begin at ten o’clock, and work till eleven, gathering beans in the garden. His father went out with him, and waited to see how long it took him to gather half a pint, and then calculated how many he could gather in an hour, if he was industrious. Rollo knew that if he failed now, he should be punished in some way, although his father did not say any thing about punishment. When he was set at work the day before, about the nails, he was making an experiment, as it were, and he did not expect to be actually punished if he failed; but now he knew that he was under orders, and must obey.  So he worked very diligently, and when his father came out at the end of the hour, he found that Rollo had got rather more beans than he had expected. Rollo was much gratified to see his father pleased; and he carried in his large basket full of beans to show his mother, with great pleasure. Then he went to play, and enjoyed himself very highly.  The next morning, his father said to him,  “Well, Rollo, you did very well yesterday; but doing right once is a very different thing from forming a habit of doing right. I can hardly expect you will succeed as well to-day; or, if you should to-day, that you will to-morrow.”  Rollo thought he should. His work was to pick up all the loose stones in the road, and carry them, in a basket, to a great heap of stones behind the barn. But he was not quite faithful. His father observed him playing several times. He did not speak to him, however, until the hour was over, and then he called him in.  “Rollo,” said he, “you have failed to-day. You have not been very idle, but have not been industrious; and the punishment which I have concluded to try first, is, to give you only bread and water for dinner.”  So,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25274"],["title","Rollo at Work (#5)"],["body","dinner time came, and the family sat down to the good beefsteak and apple-pie which was upon the table, Rollo knew that he was not to come. He felt very unhappy, but he did not cry. His father called him, and cut off a good slice of bread, and put into his hands, and told him he might go and eat it on the steps of the back door. “If you should be thirsty,” he added, “you may ask Mary to give you some water.”  Rollo took the bread, and went out, and took his solitary seat on the stone step leading into the back yard, and, in spite of all his efforts to prevent it, the tears would come into his eyes. He thought of his guilt in disobeying his father, and he felt unhappy to think that his father and mother were seated together at their pleasant table, and that he could not come because he had been an undutiful son. He determined that he would never be unfaithful in his work again.  He went on, after this, several days, very well. His father gave him various kinds of work to do, and he began at last to find a considerable degree of satisfaction in doing it. He found, particularly, that he enjoyed himself a great deal more after his work than before, and whenever he saw what he had done, it gave him pleasure. After he had picked up the loose stones before the house, for instance, he drove his hoop about there, with unusual satisfaction; enjoying the neat and tidy appearance of the road much more than he would have done if Jonas had cleared it. In fact, in the course of a month, Rollo became quite a faithful and efficient little workman.     The Corporal’s Again.   “Now,” said his father to him one day, after he had been doing a fine job of wood-piling,--“now we will go and talk with the corporal about a wheelbarrow. Or do you think you could find the way yourself?”  Rollo said he thought he could.  “Very well, you may go; I believe I shall let you have a wheelbarrow now, and you can ask him how soon he can have it done.”  Rollo clapped his hands, and capered about, and asked his father how long he thought it would be before he could have it.  “O, you will learn,” said he, “when you come to talk with the corporal.”  “Do you think it will be a week?”  “I think it probable that he could make one in less than a week,” said his father, smiling.  “Well, how soon?” said Rollo.  “O, I cannot tell you: wait till you get to his shop, and then you will see.”  Rollo saw that, for some reason or other, his father was not inclined to talk about the time when he should have his wheelbarrow, but he could not think why; however, he determined to get the corporal to make it as quick as he could, at any rate.  It was about the middle of the afternoon that Rollo set off to go for his wheelbarrow. His mother told him he might go and get his cousin James to go with him if he chose. So he walked along towards the bridge, and, instead of turning at once off there to go towards the mill, he went on over the bridge towards the house where James lived. James came with him, and they walked back very pleasantly together.  When they got back across the bridge again, they turned off towards the mill, talking about the wheelbarrow. Rollo told James about his learning to work, and about his having seen the wheelbarrow at the corporal’s, and how he trundled it about, and liked it very much.  “I should like to see it very much,” said James. “I suppose I can, when we get to the corporal’s shop.”  “No,” said Rollo, “he said that that wheelbarrow was engaged; and I suppose it has been taken away before this time.”  Just then the corner of the corporal’s shop began to corner into view, and presently the door came in sight, and James called out,  “Yes, yes, there it is. I see it standing up by the side of the door.”  “No,” said Rollo, “that is not it. That is a green one.”  “What color was the wheelbarrow that you saw?” asked James.  “It was not any color; it was not painted,” said Rollo. “I wonder whose that wheelbarrow can be?”  The boys walked along, and presently came to the door of the shop. They opened the door, and went in. There was nobody there.  Various articles were around the room. There was a bench at one side, near a window; and there were a great many tools upon it, and upon shelves over it. On another side of the shop was a lathe, a curious sort of a machine, that the corporal used a great deal, in some of his nicest work. Then there were a good many things there, which were sent in to be mended, such as chairs, a spinning-wheel, boys’ sleds, and one or two large wheelbarrows.  The boys walked around the room a few minutes, looking at the various things; and at last Rollo spied another little wheelbarrow, on a shelf. It was very much like the one at the door, only it was painted green.  Rollo said that that one looked exactly like the one he trundled when he was there before, only it was green.  “Perhaps he has painted it since,” said James; “let us go to the door, and look at the other one, and see which is the biggest.”  So they went to the door, and found that the blue one was a little the biggest.  Just then they saw the corporal coming across the road, with a hatchet in his hand. He had been to grind it at the mill, where there was a grindstone, that went round by water.  “Ah, boys,” said he, “how do you do? Have you come for your wheelbarrow, Rollo.”  “Yes, sir,” said Rollo; “how soon can you get it done?”  “Done? it is done now,” said he; “there it is.” And he took the blue wheelbarrow, which was at the door, and set it down in the path.  “That is not mine,” said Rollo, “is it?”  “Yes,” said the corporal; “your father spoke for it a week ago.”  Rollo took hold of his wheelbarrow, and began to wheel it along. He liked it very much.  [Illustration: Rollo Took Hold of His Wheelbarrow.]  James said he wished he could have one too, and while Rollo was talking with the corporal, he could not help looking at the green one on the shelf, which he thought was just about as big as he should like.  The corporal asked him if he wanted to see that one, and he took it down for him. James took hold of the handles, and tried it a little, back and forth on the floor, and then he said it was just about big enough for him.  “Who is this for?” said he to the corporal.  “I do not know,” said the corporal; “a gentleman bespoke it some time ago. I do not know what his name is.”  Just then he seemed to see somebody out of the window.  “Ah! here he comes now!” he exclaimed suddenly.  Just then the door opened, and whom should the boys see coming in, but their uncle George!  “Why, James,” said he, “have you got hold of your wheelbarrow already?”  “_My_ wheelbarrow!” said James. “Is this mine?”  “Yes,” said his uncle, “I got it made to give to you. But when I found that Rollo was having one made, I waited for his to be done, so that you might have them both together. So trundle them home.”  So the boys set off on the run down the road, in fine style, with their wheelbarrows trundling beautifully before them.      CAUSEY-BUILDING.     Sand-Men.   Next to little wooden blocks, I think that good, clean sand is an excellent thing for children to play with. When it is a little damp, it will remain in any shape you put it in, and you can build houses and cities, and make roads and canals in it. At any rate, Rollo and his cousin James used to be very fond of going down to a certain place in the brook, where there was plenty of sand, and playing in it. It was of a gray color, and somewhat mixed with pebble-stones; but then they used to like the pebble-stones very much to make walls with, and to stone up the little wells which they made in the sand.  One Wednesday afternoon, they were there playing very pleasantly with the sand. They had been building a famous city, and, after amusing themselves with it some time, they had knocked down the houses, and trampled the sand all about again. James then said he meant to go to the barn and get his horse-cart, and haul a load of sand to market.  Now there was a place around behind a large rock near there, which the boys called their barn; and Rollo and James went to it, and pulled out their two little wheelbarrows, which they called their horse-carts. They wheeled them down to the edge of the water, and began to take up the sand by double handfuls, and put it in.  When they had got their carts loaded, they began to wheel them around to the trees, and stones, and bushes, saying,  “Who’ll buy my sand?”  “Who’ll buy my white sand?”  “Who’ll buy my gray sand?”  “Who’ll buy my black sand?”  But they did not seem to find any purchaser; and at last Rollo said, suddenly,  “O, I know who will buy our sand.”  “Who?” said James.  “Mother.”  “So she will,” said James. “We will wheel it up to the house.”  So they set off, and began wheeling their loads of sand up the pathway among the trees. They went on a little way, and presently stopped, and sat down on a bank to rest. Here they found a number of flowers, which they gathered and stuck up in the sand, so that their loads soon made a very gay appearance.  Just as they were going to set out again, Rollo said,  “But, James, how are we going to get through the quagmire?”  “O,” said James, “we can step along on the bank by the side of the path.”  “No,” said Rollo; “for we cannot get our wheelbarrows along there.”  “Why, yes,--we got them along there when we came down.”  “But they were empty and light then; now they are loaded and heavy.”  “So they are; but I think we can get along; it is not very muddy there now.”  The place which the boys called the quagmire, was a low place in the pathway, where it was almost always muddy. This pathway was made by the cows, going up and down to drink; and it was a good, dry, and hard path in all places but one. This, in the spring of the year, was very wet and miry; and, during the whole summer, it was seldom perfectly dry. The boys called it the quagmire, and they used to get by on one side, in among the bushes.  They found that it was not very muddy at "]]]
