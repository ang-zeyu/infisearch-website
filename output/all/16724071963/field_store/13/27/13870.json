But I couldn't possibly go to Mr. Coddington with the men--I couldn't, really, Carmachel,\" reiterated Peter miserably.  \"Nonsense! The only question is this--is your sympathy with us or isn't it?\"  \"Of course it is!\" There was no doubting the fervor of the avowal.  \"Then that settles it. Although you have come here but recently, Strong, we all consider you a friend and count you as one of ourselves. You'll stand by the bunch, won't you?\" Carmachel scrutinized Peter sharply.  \"Yes, I will. But you don't understand the circumstances or you would never urge me to----\"  Carmachel interrupted him.  \"I guess I understand the circumstances better than you think,\" returned he, dryly. \"Mr. Coddington got you your place, I've heard. Naturally you feel under obligations to him for his kindness. That's all very well. But has he ever been near you since he put you into the tannery? No! He sits in his office and opens his mail and you are just a boy in the works. Isn't that so? What's to hinder you from going respectfully to him with the rest of us and calling to his attention something which seems to us an injustice? You said yourself it was the best plan. You pleaded with us to do it.\"  \"I know.\"  \"Then why won't you go yourself? You're not a coward, Strong, nor, unless I greatly mistake, are you the sort of chap who would point out to others a path he wouldn't dare follow himself.\"  \"I'll go!\" cried Peter suddenly. \"I'll go, but I will not do any speaking.\"  \"Nobody wants you to speak,\" growled an Italian who had been standing near and who had overheard the conversation. \"Bryant, Carmachel, and the older men will do the speaking. It's their place.\"  So it was agreed.  Events shaped themselves rapidly. Within an hour Mr. Coddington, seated in his perfectly appointed office, received word that a deputation of his men respectfully requested an interview with him that afternoon.  He was thunderstruck.  What did the demand foreshadow? Was a strike brewing? The men had appeared perfectly satisfied with the working conditions at the tanneries. Wages were fairly high and the factories conformed to every requirement of the Health and Labor Laws.  He touched a bell.  \"Ask Tyler to step here,\" said he, frowning.  Mr. Tyler entered hastily.  \"What's all this, Tyler?\" demanded his chief. \"I hear the men want to see me.\"  \"I know nothing about it, sir. They've kept their own council. If they have a grievance they have not told me.\"  \"No labor agitators have been in town recently?\"  \"Not to my knowledge, Mr. Coddington.\"  \"That will do.\"  Tyler went out.  Again Mr. Coddington rang.  \"I will see the men at three o'clock,\" he said to a messenger.  Left alone the president paced the floor. Business was good. The books showed a quantity of unfilled orders. It would be an awkward time for a strike.  \"Undoubtedly I could get strike-breakers from Chicago,\" he murmured aloud, \"but it would take time. Besides, I do not want my men to walk out. Think of the years many of them have worked here! The town will be full of idle persons and suffering families. I have never had a strike in all the history of my business. I've always tried to do what was fair toward those who were in my employ. That is what cuts--to be square with your men and then have them meet you with ingratitude. Why, I would have staked my oath that they would have stood by me. I'm disappointed--disappointed!\"  With such unpleasant reflections as companions three o'clock came none too speedily for Mr. Coddington. The men were ushered promptly into the office and the door closed. Then an awkward silence ensued. Nobody knew exactly whose place it was to speak first.  But if the tanners had expected the president of the company to break the ice and open the interview they had missed their calculations, for he did no such thing. He met their gaze firmly, courteously, but silently.  Peter, who stood at the back of the room behind the older workmen, saw in his father's face an unaccustomed sternness and felt instinctively that their mission was destined to failure.  It was Bryant who at last summoned courage to begin the conference.  \"Mr. Coddington,\" he said, \"we men have come to you because we wish to hear the truth concerning a rumor that has reached us. We come respectfully. You are our chief--the one who, in the past, has always been fair and square with us. It is because of your justice that we address you now. Is it true that you propose to take the vacant field opposite Factory 1 for the site of a new building?\"  As Mr. Coddington drew a sigh of relief he inclined his head.  \"You have been correctly informed,\" he assented. \"We need more room. The land is lying idle with a tax to be paid yearly upon it. It seems to me an economic plan to utilize the space for a new factory in which the patent leather department may be housed.\"  \"Did you realize, in deciding, that the field you intend to take is the recreation ground of the men in your mills?\" asked Bryant.  \"I know that some of the men play ball there,\" replied Mr. Coddington, smiling.  \"And yet you have decided to take it in spite of that fact?\"  The president stiffened.  \"The land,\" said he, \"is mine, and the taxes I annually pay on it render it rather a costly spot for a ball field. For years the lot has been nothing but an expense to me. If the case were yours and you could derive an income from property where previously all had been outgo wouldn't you do it?\"  \"But do you need that income, Mr. Coddington?\" cut in one of the men. \"Isn't the Coddington Company rich? Must rich men go on getting more and more, and never think of those who coin their money for them?\"  It was an unwise speech, and its effect was electrical.  \"I will try and believe that you men came here with the intention of being courteous,\" observed Mr. Coddington with frigid politeness. \"My affairs, however, are mine and not yours. I must deal with them in the way that I consider wisest. You hardly realize, I think, that you are over-stepping the bounds of propriety when you attempt to dictate to me what I shall do with my land, or how I shall manage my tanneries.\"  The sternness of the answer blocked any possible reply.  Amid the silence of the room one could almost hear the heart-beats of the waiting throng.  Then some one in the crowd made his way to the front of the room and faced the president.  It was Peter Strong.  As Mr. Coddington's gaze fell on his son he started.  The boy stood erect and looked his father squarely in the eye.  \"May I speak, sir?\"  Mr. Coddington bowed.  Peter began gently, respectfully, and his words were without defiance.  [Illustration: \"MAY I SPEAK, SIR?\"]  \"I hardly think you know what the field you are going to take from the men--from us all--means, sir. Not only do we play ball and go there to eat our luncheon but each noon time we have a chance to get a breath of fresh air and go back to work better in consequence. The field, moreover, is the only open lot in this part of the town. At night hundreds of men who have worked hard all day congregate there to get sight of the green grass and enjoy a little interval of quiet. They bring their families from the huddled districts where there is neither sky, tree, nor breathing space. Suppose you lived as they do? Suppose when you went home at night it was to a tenement in a crowded part of the city? You return to a big house on the top of a hill where the trees catch every breeze that passes; where there are shrubs, gardens, flowers. Who needs this space more--you or your employees?\"  When he began to speak, Peter had had no clear idea of what he should say; but as he went on words came to him. Was not he himself one of these working men who knew what the heat, the odor, the noise of the tanneries meant? As he went on his voice vibrated with earnestness. There was no doubting his sincerity. It was in truth Peter Strong and not Peter Coddington who made the appeal.  As Mr. Coddington listened without comment to the speech his wordlessness was an enigma to the men. It seemed as if it was a silence of suppressed anger and in consternation Carmachel plucked Peter's sleeve.  \"Say no more, lad,\" he whispered. \"You've gone too far. You forget that it is the president himself you're talking to. You shouldn't have said what you did, even though it's true.\"  But Peter scarcely heard.  He was watching his father--watching his face for the gleam that did not come.  \"I will consider what you have said, Strong,\" replied Mr. Coddington after a pause. \"I will acknowledge that I was ignorant of the fact that the spot meant anything to the people of the community. If the conditions are as you say we may be able to find a solution for the problem. May we consider this interview at an end?\"  Although the remark was in the form of a question the committee felt itself dismissed and uncomfortably the men filed into the corridor.  \"We've gained nothing!\" was Bryant's first word when they found themselves alone. \"We've only succeeded in antagonizing Mr. Coddington and solidified his intention of taking the field. We might have got somewhere if Strong had not put his foot in it. What possessed you to pitch into the president like that, young fellow?\"  \"What made you speak at all?\" put in Carmachel. \"Don't you know your place better than to think a rich man like Mr. Coddington is going to stand for having a kid like you lay down the law to him? How ever did you dare? Your job is gone--that's certain. I'm sorry, too, for we all like you here at the works.\"  \"Oh, Peter! Peter! Why did you say it?\" wailed Nat Jackson. \"I know you had the best of intentions, but don't you see that you've upset the whole thing?\"  There was something very like a sob in Nat's tone.  Poor Peter! From every hand came reproaches. If only he had not spoken! His impulse, good at heart, had been one of mistaken zeal. It was not that he himself had lost his cause--he had lost it for hundreds "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],["title","The Story of Leather (#8)"],["body","men in whom he had become interested, and whom he had struggled to serve.  Very wretched the boy was for the remainder of the day; when night came he dreaded to go home. What would his father say to him?  Peter might have saved himself this worry, for when he entered the dining-room and sat down to dinner he found the good-humor of his father quite undisturbed and no allusion was made to the day's occurrence. Surely this was carrying out to the letter the agreement they had made. Peter Coddington was his son and he treated him as such; but to Peter Strong, the boy of the tannery, he had nothing to say. Miserably Peter waited for the opportunity to offer explanation or apology. It did not come and all chance for securing it vanished when, directly after the coffee was served, Mr. Coddington rose, announced that he had an engagement, and was whirled off in the motor-car. He did not return until long after his son was asleep.  Had Peter known what this mysterious engagement was his slumbers would have been happier, for the president of the company had gone on no idle errand. Screened from view in the far corner of the big touring-car he had ridden past the tanneries and with his own eyes had seen the benches in the ball field thronged with sweltering humanity. Twice, three times he passed. He saw the boys at their games; the tired mothers resting in the twilight; the babies that toddled at their feet; and the men--his men--lying full-length on the grass drinking in the cool air. This was what he had come out to see.  The result of it was that the next morning, in the doorway of every factory of the Coddington Company, the following notice was posted:       After careful investigation Mr. Coddington has decided that it is      for the interest of his men that the plan to erect a building on      the ball field be abandoned. Instead the land will be laid out as a      recreation ground to be known as Strong Park, and to be reserved      for the Coddington employees, their families, and their friends.      Negotiations have been opened for a site on Central Street, where      the new patent leather factory will shortly be erected.                                     Signed: H. M. CODDINGTON, President.  What an ovation the men gave Peter that day! And how grateful Peter was to his father! So grateful that before going to bed he felt compelled to break their compact of silence and exclaim:  \"Father, it's splendid of you to keep the field for the men! I can't thank you half enough, sir. But you ought not to name it after me.\"  \"I'm not naming it after you,\" was his father's laconic reply. \"I'm naming it after Peter Strong.\"     [Illustration]  CHAPTER V  A CATASTROPHE   In an incredibly short space of time Strong Park began to be a reality. Men commenced grading its uneven turf; laying out walks and flower-beds; erecting benches and a band stand, and setting out trees and shrubs. An ample area at one end of the grounds was reserved for a ball field; and adjoining it parallel bars, traveling rings, and the apparatus necessary to an out-of-door gymnasium was put in place.  All these arrangements Peter witnessed with delight. He longed to tell his father so, but unfortunately was granted no opportunity. Once, and once only, did Mr. Coddington refer to the project and that was to inquire whimsically of Peter if his friend Strong was satisfied with the preparations, and whether he had any suggestions to make. Young Strong had no suggestions, Peter declared. He thought the park perfect. And indeed it was! Neither thought nor money had been spared to make it so.  Peter was very proud of his father those days when, on every hand, he heard the men extolling the president's generosity. More than once the great secret of his relation to the Coddingtons trembled on his lips and almost slipped from him, but he succeeded in holding it resolutely in check. Despite his intimacy with Nat and his frequent visits to the Jackson home not a hint of his real identity escaped him. His assumed rôle was made easier, perhaps, by the fact that he had entered so heartily into it. He was really living the career of Peter Strong, and the Peter Coddington who had idled away so many months in purposeless, irresponsible dallying was rapidly becoming but a hazy memory. There was no denying that Peter Strong's life was the far more interesting one--every day it became more absorbing.  \"You see we're really doing something!\" exclaimed Peter enthusiastically to Nat Jackson one Saturday afternoon when they were taking one of their long tramps together. \"Washing and carting skins isn't much in itself, and it would not be any fun at all if it wasn't part of the chain. But when you think how necessary a step in the process it is, and consider that there could be no leather unless somebody did just what I am doing, it seems well worth while. I never did anything before that was actually necessary. It is rather good sport.\"  And, in truth, Peter was doing something. Had he doubted it the ever increasing fund toward his motorcycle would have been a tangible proof. Already it was quite a little nest-egg and the boy, who had never before earned a penny, felt justifiably proud of the crisp bills that he was able to tuck at intervals into the bank. Once more, as a recognition of his faithful work, his pay had been raised--this time to seven dollars.  It was toward the middle of August that Mr. Tyler, the superintendent, who evidently was keeping closer watch of Peter's progress than he had suspected, notified him that on the fifteenth he was to leave the beamhouse and report in the finishing department. Peter was not only astonished but a good deal distressed. He had worked not a whit harder or more faithfully than had Nat Jackson, and deserved the promotion no more--in fact not as much as his chum. It seemed grossly unfair. Peter turned the matter over and over in his mind. He would have rejoiced in the good fortune had he considered it came to him justly; but to take what belonged to somebody else--that robbed it of all its charm. He thought and thought what he should do and at last he gained courage to go to Mr. Tyler with his dilemma. An appeal for his friend could do no harm and it might do good.  When he had made his errand known the superintendent tilted back in his chair and regarded him in silence.  \"Jackson is far better informed as to the processes than I am, Mr. Tyler,\" Peter pleaded. \"Besides, he has a mother to support and needs to get on. If there is only one vacancy in the finishing department can't you give him the chance? He has been a year in the beamhouse already, and if there is a promotion it belongs by right to him.\"  Mr. Tyler fingered his watch-chain. He had never had precisely this experience before--to try to push a man and have him beg that you give his good luck to somebody else. Surely this Peter Strong was an extraordinary person! Mr. Tyler could now understand how even the president of the company, under the spell of his simple eloquence, had not only surrendered a valuable building lot for a park but had actually named it after the youthful enthusiast. The superintendent couldn't but admire the lad's earnestness. At the same time, however, he did not at all fancy having his plans questioned or interfered with; therefore when he spoke it was to dash Peter's demands to earth with a rebuff.  \"Most men would hail with gratitude an opening that took them out of the beamhouse, Strong,\" replied he stiffly. \"It is generous of you, no doubt, to make this plea for your friend, but you see you are the person recommended for the promotion. In this world we must take our chances as they come. Unfortunately the opportunities of life are not transferable, my boy. I will, however, bear Jackson in mind and see if anything can be done for him. Good-morning.\"  The nod of Mr. Tyler's head was final.  Peter turned away, heart-sick at his failure. He had done all he could unless, indeed, he broke his bond and appealed to his father, and any such breach of their contract he considered out of the question. Yet how he dreaded to tell the Jacksons of his success. Nat would be so hurt! Still, they must, of course, know it in time and how much better to hear the news from Peter himself than in cowardly fashion to leave the spread of the tidings to rumor. Accordingly he told his tale as bravely as he could.  \"It isn't as if I deserved it one bit more than you, Nat,\" he concluded. \"It has just happened to come to me--I've no idea why.\"  \"Of course you deserve it, Peter,\" cried Nat. \"Haven't you worked like a tiger in the beamhouse ever since you came here? You know you have. Everybody says so. There isn't a man in the works but likes you and will be glad at your good luck--I most of all. Some day I'll be making a start up the ladder myself; wait and see if I don't!\"  Although he spoke with a generous heartiness and made every attempt to conceal his chagrin, Peter knew that in reality Nat honestly felt that he had failed to receive the prize that he had rightfully won. Had not the friendship of the boys been of tough fibre it would have been shattered then and there. As it was their affection for each other bridged the chasm and it would have been hard to tell which of them suffered the more--the lad who through no fault of his own had taken the award that belonged to his chum, or the lad who had won the prize only to see it handed to some one else. Peter, who was the victim of success, seemed of the two the more overwhelmed with regrets and therefore it was Nat who, despite his bitter disappointment, turned comforter.  \"You mustn't be so cut up over it, Peter, old boy! Of course I know you didn't have anything to do with it. The men in a factory are like so many checkers--they are moved about just any way that those higher up choose to play the game. It is all right and I want you to know I think so. Don't start in at your new job feeling that I'm sorry you "]]]
