Patty, I'm ashamed of you! or I would be, if I thought you meant a word of it, but I know you don't. What are you doing this afternoon?\"  \"Oh, I forgot to tell you. We're going to have a club, just a little club,--only four of us girls. And, Nan, you know there are so many clubs that make an awful fuss and yet don't really _do_ anything. Well, this is going to be a _Doing_ Club. We're going to be real _doers_.\"  \"It sounds lovely, Patty. What are you going to do?\"  \"We don't know yet, that's what the meeting's for this afternoon. But we're going to do good, you know--some kind of good. You know, Nan, I always said I didn't want to be just a social butterfly and nothing else. I want to accomplish something that will give some joy or comfort to somebody.\"  Patty's blue eyes looked very earnest and sincere as she said this, and Nan kissed her, saying, \"I know you do, Patty, dearest, and I know you'll succeed in your doing. If I can help you in any way, be sure to ask me; and now I'll run away and let you dress.\"  Patty made a leisurely toilette; and then, in a trailing blue silk négligée, she went into her boudoir and began to write her notes.  It was not a difficult task, and she did not really mind it, though it was a long list. But Patty had a knack at writing graceful little notes, and although she jested about it, she was really grateful to the kind friends who had sent the flowers.  \"I don't know _why_ I have so many friends,\" she said to herself, as she scanned the rows of names. \"To be sure, a great many are really friends of father's and Nan's, but there's a lot of our crowd, too, and lots of out of town people. Perhaps it would be a good idea to do the farthest away first, and so work back to New York.\"  Patty picked up Mr. Farnsworth's card, and read again the message on it. \"H'm,\" she said to herself, \"it sounds to me a trifle formal and conventional--considering all things. Now, Little Billee is a Western man,--but how different he is from that Lansing person! I wonder what makes the difference. Little Billee isn't formal or conventional a bit, and yet his manners are as far removed from Horace Lansing's as white is from black. Oh, well, I know the reason well enough. It's because Little Billee is a thorough gentleman at heart; and the other one is,--well, I guess he's what Roger called him. Now, what shall I say to Mr. William Farnsworth by way of thanks for his truly beautiful pink roses? I'd like to write a nice, every-day letter, and tell him all about the party and everything; but, as he just sent his visiting card, with a mere line on it, I suppose I must reply very formally.\"  Patty began her formal note, but tore up half a dozen beginnings before she completed one to her satisfaction. This one read, \"Miss Patricia Fairfield thanks Mr. William Farnsworth sincerely for his exquisite gift of roses, and for his kind congratulations.\"  Patty gave a little sigh as she sealed this missive and addressed it to her friend in Arizona.  With the exception of the roses, Patty had never heard a word from Big Bill since they were at Spring Beach together. She had told her father and Nan of what Mr. Farnsworth had said to her down there, and as they had agreed that Patty was altogether too young even to think of such a thing as being engaged to anybody, it was wiser to hold no correspondence with him at all.  Apparently, this in no way disappointed the young man, for he had made no effort on his part to recall himself to Patty's remembrance, until the occasion of sending the flowers.  Patty had liked Bill extremely, but as Arizona was far away, and she had no reason to think she would ever see him again, she gave him few thoughts. However, the thoughts, when she did allow them to come, were pleasant ones. Although she had sealed the note she intended to send, she began another one, and the opening words were \"Little Billee.\" This note she wrote in the first person, and thanked him simply and naturally for the flowers. Then, for a signature, she made a carefully and daintily drawn pen-and-ink sketch of an apple blossom. She was clever at flower-sketching, and she sat a moment admiring her own handiwork. Then a flush spread over her pretty face, and she spoke sternly to herself, as was her habit when she disapproved of her own actions.  \"Patty Fairfield,\" she said, reprovingly, \"you ought to be ashamed to think of sending a personal, lettery sort of a note like that, to a man who sent you the formalest kind of a message! He only sent the flowers, because convention demanded it! He never gave you one single thought after that last time he saw you,--and that's all there is about _that_!\"  And then, to her great surprise, luncheon was announced, and she found that her whole morning was gone and only one name on her list crossed off!                    *       *       *       *       *  The club that met that afternoon in Mona's pretty sitting-room in the Plaza Hotel, consisted of only four girls--Patty, Mona, Elise, and Clementine Morse.  It was thought wiser to start with a few earnest members and then enlarge the number later if it seemed advisable.  \"What a beautiful room!\" said Clementine, as she tossed off her furs. \"Don't you like it, Mona, to live in a big hotel like this, and yet have your own rooms, like a home all to yourself?\"  \"Yes, I like it in some ways; but I'm alone a great deal. However, I would be that, if father and I lived in a house or an apartment.\"  \"You ought to have a companion of some sort, Mona,\" said Patty, who thought this a good opportunity to urge Mr. Galbraith's wishes.  \"No, thank you,\" and Mona tossed her head, disdainfully; \"I know what companions are! Snoopy old maids who won't let you do anything, or careless, easy-going old ladies who pay no attention to you. If I could have a companion of my own age and tastes, I'd like that,--but I suppose that wouldn't do.\"  \"Hardly,\" said Elise, laughing; \"that would only mean your father would have two troublesome girls to look after instead of one. And I daresay, Mona, you are quite as much as he can handle.\"  \"I suppose I am. But he's so good to me I'm afraid he spoils me. But come on, girls, let's organise our club.\"  \"Don't let's have too much organisation,\" said Clementine. \"Do you know, I think lots of clubs, especially charity clubs, have so much organisation that they haven't anything else. One club I joined fell to pieces before it was fairly started, because the two vice-presidents squabbled so.\"  \"If there's anything I hate,\" declared Patty, \"it's a squabble. Whatever else we girls do, let's try not to have any friction. Now, I know perfectly well that none of us four is _very_ meek or mild.\"  \"I am,\" declared Elise, assuming an angelic expression, which made them all laugh, for Elise was really the one most likely to take offence at trifles, or to flare up impulsively if any one disagreed with her.  Patty knew this only too well, and was trying to forestall it by a preliminary treaty of peace.  \"Well, then, let's be an organisation that doesn't organise,\" said Mona, \"but let's be it _now_.\"  \"I think,\" said Patty, \"that our end and aim ought to be to do good to somebody who doesn't expect it. Now, that isn't quite what I mean,--I mean to people who wouldn't accept it if it seemed like charity, but to whom we could give a pleasure that they would really like.\"  \"Patty, my child,\" said Clementine, \"I think your ideas are all right, but I must say you don't express them very clearly. Let's get down to something definite. Do you mean to give material things,--like presents or money?\"  \"That's just exactly what I _don't_ mean, Clem! Don't you remember that little club we used to have at school,--the Merry Grigs?\"  \"Indeed I do! All we had to do was to be merry and gay.\"  \"Well, that's what I mean,--in a way,--if you know what I mean.\"  \"Oh, Patty,\" cried Mona, \"I never knew you to be so hopelessly vague. Now, for instance, how would it be if we gave a lovely motor ride to some poor shop girl, or somebody that never gets into a motor?\"  \"That's it!\" cried Clementine, approvingly; \"I was thinking of sending flowers to hospitals, but that's so general. Now, your suggestion, Mona, is definite, and just the right sort of thing.\"  \"But aren't we going to have a president and treasurer, and things like that?\" asked Elise.  \"No,\" said Patty; \"my mind is clearing now, and I begin to see our club. Instead of a president, we'll all four be presidents, and instead of a treasurer, we'll all four be treasurers. We'll give money when it's necessary, or we'll use our motor cars, or buy flowers, or whatever we like; but we won't have dues and officers and things.\"  \"But the shop girls are always busy; how can we take them motoring?\" asked Elise.  \"That was only a suggestion,\" said Mona; \"it needn't be exactly a shop girl; but anybody we know of, who would enjoy a little unexpected pleasure.\"  \"The principle is exactly right,\" said Clementine; \"now, let's get it down to practicability. As Mona says, we needn't necessarily choose a shop girl,--but suppose we do, many of them are free Saturday afternoon.\"  \"Only in the summer time,\" objected Elise.  \"Yes, perhaps, in the big shops; but there are lots of them, in offices,--or even school teachers,--who would be free Saturday afternoons. Well, anyway, here's what I'm thinking of, and you can all say what you think of it. Suppose we try, every week, to give a happy Saturday afternoon to somebody who wouldn't have it otherwise.\"  \"The Happy Saturday Afternoon Club!\" cried Patty; \"that's a lovely name! let's do it!\"  \"But,\" said Elise, \"that would mean giving up our Saturday afternoons. Do we want to do that? What about matinées?\"  \"I think we ought to be willing to sacrifice something,\" said Patty, thoughtfully; \"but I do love Saturday matinées.\"  \"Oh, if there's anything especial, we needn't consider ourselves bound to give up the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25857"],["title","Patty's Social Season (#5)"],["body","ernoon,\" said Clementine. \"For that matter, we could send a couple of girls for a motor ride without going ourselves.\"  \"But that's more like charity,\" objected Patty: \"I meant to go with them, and be real nice and pleasant with them, and make a bright spot in their lives that they would always remember.\"  \"They'd always remember you, Patty, if you were the bright spot,\" declared Mona, who idolised her friend. \"But I must confess I do like to be definite about this thing. Now, how's this for a plan? To-day's Thursday. Suppose we begin on Saturday and make a start at something. Suppose we each of us pick out a girl,--or a boy, for that matter,--or a child or anybody, and think what we can do to make them happy on Saturday afternoon.\"  \"Now we're getting somewhere,\" said Elise, approvingly. \"I've picked mine already. She's a girl who comes to our house quite often to sew for the children. She's a sweet little thing, but she looks as if she never had a real good time in all her life. Now, can the rest of you think of anybody like that?\"  \"Yes, I have one,\" said Mona. \"Your suggestion made me think of her. She's my manicure girl. She comes here, and sometimes she's so tired she's ready to drop! She works awfully hard, and never takes a day off, because she has to support two little sisters. But I'll make her take a holiday Saturday afternoon, somehow.\"  \"There's a girl I'd like to have,\" said Clementine, thoughtfully; \"she's at the ribbon counter in Walker's. She always waits on me there; and she has such a wistful air, I'd like to do her a kindness. I don't suppose she could get off,--but I could go and ask the head of the department, and perhaps he'd let her.\"  \"I can't think of anybody,\" said Patty, \"except one person, that I would simply _love_ to have. And that's a very tired and cross-looking lady who gives out embroidery patterns in a dreadful place, way down town. I believe it would sweeten her up for a year to have a little spree with us.\"  \"All right,\" said Mona. \"Now we have selected our guests, what shall we do with them? Say, a motor ride and a cup of tea afterward in some pretty tea room?\"  \"I think,\" said Elise, \"that we'd better give them luncheon first. They can't enjoy a motor ride if they're hungry, and they probably will be.\"  \"Luncheon where?\" said Patty, looking puzzled; \"at one of our houses?\"  \"I could have them here, easily enough,\" said Mona. \"Our dining-room here, would really be better than any of the homes of you girls. Because you all have people, and I haven't. Father would just as lieve lunch downstairs, in the main dining-room.\"  \"That's lovely of you, Mona,\" said Patty. \"I was going to suggest some small, quiet restaurant, but a luncheon here in your pretty dining-room would indeed be a bright spot for them to remember. But suppose they won't come?\"  \"Then we must ask someone instead,\" said Clementine; \"let's promise each to bring someone with us on Saturday, and if the first one we ask declines, keep on asking till we get somebody. Of course, Mona, we'll share the expense of the luncheon equally.\"  \"Nonsense,\" returned Mona; \"I'll be glad to give that.\"  \"No,\" said Patty, firmly; \"we'll each pay a quarter of whatever the luncheon costs. And let's have it good and substantial, and yet have some pretty, fancy things too. For, you know, this isn't a charity or a soup kitchen,--it's to give those girls a bright and beautiful scene to look back on.\"  \"Oh, it will be lovely!\" cried Mona. \"I'll have pretty place cards, and favours, and everything.\"  \"But we mustn't overdo it,\" said Clementine.  \"You know, to the unaccustomed, an elaborate table may prove embarrassing.\"  \"That will be all right,\" said Patty, smiling. \"Mona can fix her table, and I'll come over before the luncheon, and if she has too many or too grand flumadiddles, I'll take some of them off. I don't want our guests struck dumb by too much grandeur, but I do want things pretty and nice. Suppose we each bring a favor for our own guest.\"  \"Something useful?\" said Elise.  \"No; _not_ a suit of flannel underwear or a pair of shoes! But a pretty necktie or handkerchief, if you like, or even a little gold pin, or a silver one.\"  \"Or a picture or cast,\" said Clementine.  \"Yes,\" and Patty nodded approval; \"but it ought to be a little thing that would look like a luncheon souvenir and not like a Christmas present. I think they ought to be all alike.\"  \"So do I,\" said Mona, \"and I think a little pin in a jeweler's box will be the prettiest; and then a lovely bunch of flowers at each plate, and an awfully pretty place-card.\"  \"Oh, it will be beautiful!\" cried Patty, jumping up and dancing about the room; \"but I must flit, girls,--I have an engagement at five. Wait, what about motors? I'm sure we can use our big car.\"  \"And ours,\" said all the rest together.  \"Well, we'll need two,\" said Clementine, \"and two of us girls and two guests can go in each. We'll see which cars can be used most conveniently; perhaps our fathers may have something to say on that subject. But we can arrange all such things by telephone to-morrow. The main thing is to get our guests.\"  \"Oh, we'll do that,\" said Patty, \"if we have to go out into the highways and hedges after them.\"     CHAPTER IV  AN INVITATION   The next morning Patty started off in her own little electric runabout with Miller, the chauffeur.  She let him drive, and gave the address, as she stepped in, \"The Monongahela Art Embroidery Company,\" adding a number in lower Broadway.  The correct Miller could not suppress a slight smile as he said, \"Where I took you once before, Miss Patty?\" And Patty smiled, as she said, \"Yes, Miller.\"  But it was with a different feeling that she entered the big building this time, and she went straight to department B. On her way she met the red-headed boy who had so amused her when she was there a year ago.  He greeted her with the same lack of formality that had previously characterised him.  \"Is youse up against it again?\" he inquired, grinning broadly. \"I t'ought youse didn't get no cinch, and had to can de whole projick.\"  \"I'm not on the same 'projick' now,\" said Patty, smiling at him. \"Is department B in the same place?\"  \"Sure it is,\" and for some reason the boy added, \"miss,\" after a momentary pause, which made Patty realise his different attitude toward her, now that she wore a more elaborate costume, than when he had seen her in a purposely plain little suit.  \"And is the same lady still in charge of it?\"  \"Yep; dey ain't nuttin' lessen dynnimite goin' to boost Mis' Greene outen o' here!\"  \"Then Mrs. Greene is the lady I want to see,\" and Patty threaded her way through the narrow passages between the piled up boxes.  \"No pass needed; she's a free show,\" the boy called after her, and in a moment Patty found herself again in the presence of the sharp-faced, tired-looking woman whom she had once interviewed regarding her embroidery work.  \"This is Mrs. Greene, isn't it?\" said Patty, pleasantly.  \"Yes, I am,\" snapped the woman. \"You don't want work again, do you?\"  \"No,\" said Patty, smiling, \"I come this time on quite a different errand.\"  \"Then you don't want to see _me_. I'm here only to give out work. Did Mr. Myers send you?\"  \"No, I came of my own accord. Now, Mrs. Greene, forget the work for a moment, and let me tell you what I want.\"  \"If it's subscribin' to any fund, or belongin' to any working woman's club run by you swell ladies, you can count me out. I ain't got time for foolishness.\"  \"It isn't anything like that,\" and Patty laughed so merrily that Mrs. Greene's hard face softened in spite of herself. \"Well, what is it?\" she asked, in a less belligerent tone.  \"It's only this,\" and though Patty's errand had seemed to her simple enough before she came in, she now began to wonder how Mrs. Greene would take it. \"Some friends of mine and I are asking three or four people to lunch with us and take a little motor ride on Saturday, and I want you to come as my guest?\"  \"What!\" and Mrs. Greene's face was blank with amazement, but her manner betokened an impending burst of wrath.  Patty realised that the woman's pride was up in arms at the idea of patronage, and she was at her wit's end how to make the real spirit of her invitation understood.  As it chanced, she unwittingly took the right tack. So earnest was she that her lips quivered a little, and her eyes showed a pleading, pathetic expression, as she said, \"_Please_ don't misunderstand me, Mrs. Greene. If you would enjoy it, I want you to come to our party on Saturday as our welcome guest. If you wouldn't enjoy it,--just say so,--but--but _don't_ scold me!\"  Mrs. Greene looked puzzled, and then the hard, stern mouth broke into an actual smile.  \"Well, I declare,\" she said, \"I do believe you've got a real heart!\"  \"And I do believe that _you_ have!\" exclaimed Patty. \"And, now that we know the truth about each other, you'll come, won't you?\"  \"Tell me about it,\" and the speaker seemed still uncertain, though wavering.  So Patty told her, honestly and straightforwardly, the circumstances of the party, and wound up by saying, \"I truly want you, Mrs. Greene, for the simple reason that I want you to enjoy the afternoon,--and for no other reason.\"  \"And I'll come, and be awful glad of the chance! Why, I've never had a ride in a motor car in my life, and I've never eaten in one of those fandangle hotels; and the way you put it, I'm just crazy to go!\"  \"Do you have holiday Saturday afternoon?\"  \"Yes, all these downtown places do.\"  \"Very well, then, I shall expect you at the Plaza at one o'clock. Ask for Miss Galbraith, and they will show you right up to her rooms.\"  \"Land! it does seem too good to be true! Say, Miss Fairfield, I've only got a black mohair to wear,--will that do?\"  \"Of course it will. Maybe you've a pretty bit of embroidery or something to lighten it up a little.\"  \"Yes, I've got a linjerry collar and cuffs that I've just been achin' to wear ever since my sister gave them to me last"]]]
