Let me tell you of a girl I met down South, who, if she only had Patty's determination and force of character, might achieve success, and even renown.\"  \"Do tell us about her,\" said Nan, for Mr. Hepworth was always an interesting talker.  \"She lives in Virginia, and her name is Christine Farley. A friend of mine, down there, asked me to look at some of her drawings, and I saw at once that the girl has real talent, if not genius.\"  \"Of course you would know,\" said Nan, for Mr. Hepworth himself was a portrait painter of high repute.  \"Yes, she really has done some remarkable work. But she is poor and lives in a small country town. She has already learned all the local teachers can give her, and needs the technical training of a good art school. With a year of such training she could easily become, I am sure, a successful illustrator. At least, after a year's study, I know she could get good work to do, and then she would rapidly become known.\"  \"Can't she manage to do this, in some way?\" asked Mr. Fairfield.  \"No; she is ambitious in her work, but in no other way. She is shy and timid; a country girl, inexperienced in the ways of the world, ignorant of city life, and desperately afraid of New York, which to her is a name for all unknown terrors.\"  \"Goose!\" said Patty. \"Oh, I'm sorry for her, of course; but as an American girl, she ought to have more spunk.\"  \"Southern girls don't have spunk, Patty,\" said her father, with a merry twinkle in his eye.  \"Don't they! Well, I guess I ought to know! I'm a Southern girl, myself. At least, I was until I was fourteen.\"  \"Perhaps you've achieved your spunk since you came North, then,\" said Hepworth; \"for I agree with your father, Southern girls do not have much energy of character. At least, Miss Farley hasn't. She's about nineteen or twenty, but she's as childish as a girl of fourteen,--except in her work; there she excels any one of her age I've ever known.\"  \"Can nothing be done in the matter?\" asked Nan.  \"I don't know. I'm told they're very proud people, and would not accept charity. Of course she never can earn anything by her work if she stays at home; and as she can't get away, it seems to be a deadlock.\"  \"I'd like to help her,\" said Patty, slowly. \"I do think she ought to have ingenuity enough to help herself, but if she hasn't, I'd like to help her.\"  \"How can you?\" asked Nan.  \"I don't know. But the way to find out how to do things is to do them.\"  \"Oh, dear,\" moaned Mr. Hepworth, in mock despair. \"I said I feared you were clever. Don't say those things, Patty, you'll ruin your reputation as a beauty.\"  \"Pooh!\" said Patty, who sometimes didn't know whether Mr. Hepworth was teasing her or not, \"that isn't a clever thing to say.\"  \"Well, if you don't mean it for an epigram, I'll forgive you,--but don't let it happen again. Now, as to Christine Farley. I'll let you be clever for once, if you'll turn your cleverness to devising some way to aid her to an art education. Can you think of any way?\"  \"I can think of dozens,\" returned Patty, \"but the only thing to do is for her to come to New York, get a scholarship at the Art School, and then board in a hall bedroom,--art students always do that,--and they have jolly good times with chafing dishes and palette knives, and such things. I've read about 'em.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Hepworth, \"but how is she to pay the board for the hall bedroom? They are really quite poor, I'm told.\"  \"Well!\" said Patty, scornfully, \"anybody,--the merest infant,--could earn enough money outside class hours to pay a small sum like that, I should hope! Why, how much would such board cost?\"  \"Patty, child,\" said her father, \"you don't know much of social economics, do you? I fancy the young woman could board properly for about twelve or fifteen dollars a week; eh, Hepworth?\"  \"Yes; I daresay fifteen dollars a week would cover her expenses, including her art materials. Of course this would mean literally the 'hall bedroom' in a very modest boarding-house.\"  \"Well!\" went on Patty, \"and do you mean to say that this girl couldn't earn fifteen dollars a week, and attend her classes, too?\"  \"I mean to say just that,\" said Mr. Hepworth, seriously.  \"I agree with you,\" said Nan. \"Why, I couldn't earn fifteen dollars a week, and stay at home from the classes.\"  \"Oh, Nan!\" cried Patty, \"you could! I'm sure you could! Why, I'll bet I could earn fifteen dollars a week, and have plenty of time left for my practising, my club meetings, motoring, skating, and all the things I want to do beside. Fifteen dollars a week is _nothing_!\"  \"Gently, gently, my girl,\" said her father, for Patty's cheeks were pink with the earnestness of her argument. \"Fifteen dollars a week seems nothing to you, because you have all the money you want. But where is your sense of proportion? Your idea of relative values? The value of fifteen dollars handed out to you willingly by a loving father, or the value of fifteen dollars earned from a grudging employer, are totally different matters.\"  \"I don't care,\" said Patty. \"I know I could earn that much a week, and I believe this other girl could do so, if she had somebody to make her think she could.\"  \"There's a good deal in that,\" said Hepworth, thoughtfully. \"Miss Farley does need somebody to make her think she can do things. But the life of an art student is a busy one, and I'm sure she couldn't earn much money while she's studying.\"  \"But fifteen dollars a week isn't much,\" persisted Patty. \"Anybody could earn that.\"  \"Look here, Puss,\" said her father: \"sometimes you show a bravery of assertion that ought to be put to the test. Now I'll make a proposition to you in the presence of these two witnesses. If you'll earn fifteen dollars in one week,--any week,--I'll agree to pay the board of this Miss Farley in New York, for a year, while she pursues her art studies.\"  \"Oh, father, will you?\" cried Patty. \"What a duck you are! Of course I can earn the money, easily.\"  \"Wait a moment; there are conditions, or rather stipulations. You must not do anything unbecoming a quiet, refined girl,--but I know you wouldn't do that, anyway. You must not engage in any pursuit that keeps you away from your home after five o'clock in the afternoon----\"  \"Oh,\" interrupted Patty, \"I don't propose to go out washing! I shall do light work of some sort at home. But never you mind what I do,--of course it will be nothing you could possibly object to,--I'll earn fifteen dollars in less than a week.\"  \"A week, though, is the proposition. When you bring me fifteen dollars, earned by yourself, unassisted, in the space of seven days, I'll carry out my part of the bargain.\"  \"But the girl won't accept it,\" said Patty, regretfully.  \"I'm trusting to your tact, and Nan's, to offer the opportunity to her in such a way that she will accept it. Couldn't that be done, Hepworth?\"  \"Why, yes; I daresay it could be managed. And you are very generous, Mr. Fairfield, but I can't say I have much hope of Patty's success.\"  \"'Patty's success' is always a foregone conclusion,\" said that young woman, saucily; \"and now, at last, I have an aim in life! I shall begin to-morrow,--and we'll see!\"  The others laughed, for no one could take pretty Patty very seriously, except herself.  \"But don't tell anybody,\" she added, as the doorbell rang.  They all promised they wouldn't, and then Elise and Roger came in to bring New Year's greetings, and the conversation took a lighter and merrier turn.     CHAPTER VII  DEPARTMENT G   Alone in her own room that same night, Patty thought out her great project. She was not at all doubtful of her success, she was only choosing among the various methods of earning money that occurred to her.  All were easy, and some of them even seemed delightful occupations.  \"Father is an angel,\" she thought to herself; \"a big, splendid angel. He knew I could do my part easily enough, and he only made it a stipulation because he didn't want to shoulder the whole affair outright. He wanted me to feel I had a hand in it. He's so tactful and dear. Well, I'll do my part so well, he'll have nothing to complain of. Then I'll get Nan to write to the girl, and invite her here for a few days or a week. Then I rather guess we can gently persuade her to accept the goods the gods provide.\"  Considering the matter as settled, Patty went to sleep and dreamed happily of her coming triumphs as a wage-earner.  \"Do you go to business to-day, Miss Fairfield?\" asked her father, at the breakfast table.  \"Yes, Mr. Fairfield. That is, I shall occupy myself with my--with my occupation.\"  \"Indeed! that is logical, at any rate. Would it be indiscreet to inquire the nature of said occupation?\"  \"It would be not only indiscreet, but useless, for I decline to tell. But it is work I shall do at home. I've no desire to enter an office. And, you don't need a stenographer, anyway, do you?\"  \"No, and if I did, I shouldn't take you. You're too young and too self-assured,--not desirable traits in office work.\"  \"I may get over them both,\" said Patty, smiling at him.  \"You probably will,\" said Nan, \"before you've succeeded in this ridiculous scheme you've undertaken.\"  \"Now, Nannikins, don't desert Mr. Micawber in that cruel fashion,\" Patty flung back, gaily; \"the game's never out till it's played out, you know; and this game isn't even yet begun.\"  \"You'll be played out before the game is,\" said her father.  \"Oh, daddy, I'm 'fraid that's slang! I am truly 'fraid so!\"  \"Well, mind now, Puss; you're not to tire yourself too much. Remember when you 'most worked yourself to death, at your Commencement celebration.\"  \"Yes, but I've had a lot of experience since that. And I'm much weller and stronger.\"  \"Yes, you're well; but you're not of a very strong constitution, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2587"],["title","Life Is a Dream (#0)"],["body","IS A DREAM  By Pedro Calderon De La Barca    Translated by Edward Fitzgerald     INTRODUCTORY NOTE  Pedro Calderon de la Barca was born in Madrid, January 17, 1600, of good family. He was educated at the Jesuit College in Madrid and at the University of Salamanca; and a doubtful tradition says that he began to write plays at the age of thirteen. His literary activity was interrupted for ten years, 1625-1635, by military service in Italy and the Low Countries, and again for a year or more in Catalonia. In 1637 he became a Knight of the Order of Santiago, and in 1651 he entered the priesthood, rising to the dignity of Superior of the Brotherhood of San Pedro in Madrid. He held various offices in the court of Philip IV, who rewarded his services with pensions, and had his plays produced with great splendor. He died May 5, 1681.  At the time when Calderon began to compose for the stage, the Spanish drama was at its height. Lope de Vega, the most prolific and, with Calderon, the greatest, of Spanish dramatists, was still alive; and by his applause gave encouragement to the beginner whose fame was to rival his own. The national type of drama which Lope had established was maintained in its essential characteristics by Calderon, and he produced abundant specimens of all its varieties. Of regular plays he has left a hundred and twenty; of \"Autos Sacramentales,\" the peculiar Spanish allegorical development of the medieval mystery, we have seventy-three; besides a considerable number of farces.  The dominant motives in Calderon's dramas are characteristically national: fervid loyalty to Church and King, and a sense of honor heightened almost to the point of the fantastic. Though his plays are laid in a great variety of scenes and ages, the sentiment and the characters remain essentially Spanish; and this intensely local quality has probably lessened the vogue of Calderon in other countries. In the construction and conduct of his plots he showed great skill, yet the ingenuity expended in the management of the story did not restrain the fiery emotion and opulent imagination which mark his finest speeches and give them a lyric quality which some critics regard as his greatest distinction.  Of all Calderon's works, \"Life is a Dream\" may be regarded as the most universal in its theme. It seeks to teach a lesson that may be learned from the philosophers and religious thinkers of many ages--that the world of our senses is a mere shadow, and that the only reality is to be found in the invisible and eternal. The story which forms its basis is Oriental in origin, and in the form of the legend of \"Barlaam and Josaphat\" was familiar in all the literatures of the Middle Ages. Combined with this in the plot is the tale of Abou Hassan from the \"Arabian Nights,\" the main situations in which are turned to farcical purposes in the Induction to the Shakespearean \"Taming of the Shrew.\" But with Calderon the theme is lifted altogether out of the atmosphere of comedy, and is worked up with poetic sentiment and a touch of mysticism into a symbolic drama of profound and universal philosophical significance.      LIFE IS A DREAM    DRAMATIS PERSONAE       Basilio           King of Poland.      Segismund         his Son.      Astolfo           his Nephew.      Estrella          his Niece.      Clotaldo          a General in Basilio's Service.      Rosaura           a Muscovite Lady.      Fife              her Attendant.       Chamberlain, Lords in Waiting, Officers,      Soldiers, etc., in Basilio's Service.   The Scene of the first and third Acts lies on the Polish frontier: of the second Act, in Warsaw.  As this version of Calderon's drama is not for acting, a higher and wider mountain-scene than practicable may be imagined for Rosaura's descent in the first Act and the soldiers' ascent in the last. The bad watch kept by the sentinels who guarded their state-prisoner, together with much else (not all!) that defies sober sense in this wild drama, I must leave Calderon to answer for; whose audience were not critical of detail and probability, so long as a good story, with strong, rapid, and picturesque action and situation, was set before them.     ACT I     SCENE I--A pass of rocks, over which a storm is rolling away,  and the sun setting: in the foreground, half-way down, a fortress.   (Enter first from the topmost rock Rosaura, as from horseback, in man's attire; and, after her, Fife.)       ROSAURA.      There, four-footed Fury, blast      Engender'd brute, without the wit      Of brute, or mouth to match the bit      Of man--art satisfied at last?      Who, when thunder roll'd aloof,      Tow'rd the spheres of fire your ears      Pricking, and the granite kicking      Into lightning with your hoof,      Among the tempest-shatter'd crags      Shattering your luckless rider      Back into the tempest pass'd?      There then lie to starve and die,      Or find another Phaeton      Mad-mettled as yourself; for I,      Wearied, worried, and for-done,      Alone will down the mountain try,      That knits his brows against the sun.       FIFE (as to his mule).      There, thou mis-begotten thing,      Long-ear'd lightning, tail'd tornado,      Griffin-hoof-in hurricano,      (I might swear till I were almost      Hoarse with roaring Asonante)      Who forsooth because our betters      Would begin to kick and fling      You forthwith your noble mind      Must prove, and kick me off behind,      Tow'rd the very centre whither      Gravity was most inclined.      There where you have made your bed      In it lie; for, wet or dry,      Let what will for me betide you,      Burning, blowing, freezing, hailing;      Famine waste you: devil ride you:      Tempest baste you black and blue:      (To Rosaura.)      There! I think in downright railing      I can hold my own with you.       ROS.      Ah, my good Fife, whose merry loyal pipe,      Come weal, come woe, is never out of tune      What, you in the same plight too?       FIFE.      Ay; And madam--sir--hereby desire,      When you your own adventures sing      Another time in lofty rhyme,      You don't forget the trusty squire      Who went with you Don-quixoting.       ROS.      Well, my good fellow--to leave Pegasus      Who scarce can serve us than our horses worse--      They say no one should rob another of      The single satisfaction he has left      Of singing his own sorrows; one so great,      So says some great philosopher, that trouble      Were worth encount'ring only for the sake      Of weeping over--what perhaps you know      Some poet calls the 'luxury of woe.'       FIFE.      Had I the poet or philosopher      In the place of her that kick'd me off to ride,      I'd test his theory upon his hide.      But no bones broken, madam--sir, I mean?--       ROS.      A scratch here that a handkerchief will heal--      And you?--       FIFE.      A scratch in _quiddity_, or kind:      But not in '_quo_'--my wounds are all behind.      But, as you say, to stop this strain,      Which, somehow, once one's in the vein,      Comes clattering after--there again!--      What are we twain--deuce take't!--we two,      I mean, to do--drench'd through and through--      Oh, I shall choke of rhymes, which I believe      Are all that we shall have to live on here.       ROS.      What, is our victual gone too?--       FIFE.      Ay, that brute      Has carried all we had away with her,      Clothing, and cate, and all.       ROS.      And now the sun,      Our only friend and guide, about to sink      Under the stage of earth.       FIFE.      And enter Night,      With Capa y Espada--and--pray heaven!      With but her lanthorn also.       ROS.      Ah, I doubt      To-night, if any, with a dark one--or      Almost burnt out after a month's consumption.      Well! well or ill, on horseback or afoot,      This is the gate that lets me into Poland;      And, sorry welcome as she gives a guest      Who writes his own arrival on her rocks      In his own blood--      Yet better on her stony threshold die,      Than live on unrevenged in Muscovy.       FIFE.      Oh, what a soul some women have--I mean      Some men--       ROS.      Oh, Fife, Fife, as you love me, Fife,      Make yourself perfect in that little part,      Or all will go to ruin!       FIFE.      Oh, I will,      Please God we find some one to try it on.      But, truly, would not any one believe      Some fairy had exchanged us as we lay      Two tiny foster-children in one cradle?       ROS.      Well, be that as it may, Fife, it reminds me      Of what perhaps I should have thought before,      But better late than never--You know I love you,      As you, I know, love me, and loyally      Have follow'd me thus far in my wild venture.      Well! now then--having seen me safe thus far      Safe if not wholly sound--over the rocks      Into the country where my business lies      Why should not you return the way we came,      The storm all clear'd away, and, leaving me      (Who now shall want you, though not thank you, less,      Now that our horses gone) this side the ridge,      Find your way back to dear old home again;      While I--Come, come!--      What, weeping my poor fellow?       FIFE.      Leave you here      Alone--my Lady--Lord! I mean my Lord--      In a strange country--among savages--      Oh, now I know--you would be rid of me      For fear my stumbling speech--       ROS.      Oh, no, no, no!--      I want you with me for a thousand sakes      To which that is as nothing--I myself      More apt to let the secret out myself      Without your help at all--Come, come, cheer up!      And if you sing again, 'Come weal, come woe,'      Let it be that; for we will never part      Until you give the signal.       FIFE.      'Tis a bargain.       ROS.      Now to begin, then. 'Follow, follow me,      'You fairy elves that be.'       FIFE.      Ay, and go on--      Something of 'following darkness like a dream,'"]]]
