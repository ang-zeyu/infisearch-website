They say that he shortly afterwards went to Peru, and that many, in     imitation of the habit and shoes which that man used, introduced     among themselves the fashion of wearing shoes, and the loose mantle     over the shoulders, either fastened with a clasp at the breast, or     knotted at the corners, whence it may be inferred that this man was     some apostle whose name they do not know.\" [14]  The points of comparison between the character referred to in the foregoing quotation and the Messiah in his ministry among the Nephites, are:  First: In personal appearance, if due allowance be made for the imperfect description in the legend.  Second: In the character of the work performed, especially in the matter of healing of the sick. While in their midst Jesus is represented as saying to the Nephites:      Have ye any that are sick among you, bring them hither. Have ye     any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or     that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in     any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have     compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy; for I     perceive that ye desire that I shew unto you what I have done unto     your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient     that I should heal you. And it came to pass that when he had thus     spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their     sick, and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind,     and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any     manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth     unto him. [15]  Third: In relation to the graciousness of his language, the third Nephi represents the Savior as praying for the Nephites in this manner:      And the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude     did bear record who heard him. And after this manner did they     bear record: \"The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard     before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus     speak unto the Father, and no tongue can speak, neither can there     be written by any man, neither can the heart of man conceive so     great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak;     and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the     time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.\" [16]  Fourth: Relative to teaching the people, that many men and women were resplendent in their glory and were already dwelling with God, the Book of Mormon mentions the circumstance of Jesus taking very great pains to have recorded in the Nephite annals the fact that many of the ancient Saints arose from the dead and appeared unto many and ministered unto them; [17] and from the whole tenor of his instructions to the Nephites, as found in III. Nephi, it is clear that there was ever present in his thought the fact of redeemed and glorified immortals dwelling with God in his kingdom.  Fifth: The reference in the quotation to the departure of the man-God for another land is paralleled in the Book of Mormon account of Jesus, where he is represented as declaring the existence of the lost tribes of the house of Israel, and the declaration of his intention to visit them. \"Now,\" said he, \"I go unto the Father, and also to show myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither he hath taken them.\" [18]  IV.  _Topilitzen Quetzalcohuatl._  This personage appears under different names in the native traditions of various countries of America. In the Popol Vuh of the Quiches he is known under the title of Gucumatz; [19] in Yucatan he appears under the name of Cukulcan; [20] in Oajaca (despite some difficulties and contradictions) as Huemac; and in Mexico, par excellence, as Toplitzin Quetzalcohuatl. Respecting this character, various opinions are held. By some he is regarded as the Apostle St. Thomas, whom they credit with coming to America and preaching the Christian religion. \"In support of their opinion,\" says Bancroft, \"that he [Quetzalcohuatl] was no other than the apostle, they allege that the hero-god's proper name, Topilitzen Quetzalcohuatl, closely resembles in sound and signification that of 'Thomas, surnamed Didymus;' for 'to' in the Mexican name, is an abbreviation of Thomas, to which 'pilcin,' meaning 'son' or 'disciple,' is added; while the meaning of Quetzalcohuatl (in the Aztec language) is exactly the same as that of the Greek name 'Didymus,' 'a twin,' being compounded of 'quetzalli,' a 'plume of green feathers,' metaphorically signifying anything precious, and 'coatl,' a serpent, metaphorically meaning one of two twins.\" [21]  Lord Kingsborough, it is well known, is the foremost among those who have identified this traditionary personage (Quetzalcohuatl) with the Hebrew Messiah--Jesus of Nazareth; and to this subject he devoted an incredible amount of labor and research. [22] As Kingsborough's interpretation of the name, Topilitzin Quetzalcohuatl, as also the substance of his argument will appear in quotations from his works, it is not necessary to make a statement of them here. Let it suffice, at this point, to say that native American traditions assign too many of the qualities of Deity to Quetzalcohuatl to regard him merely as a man; and while many things are ascribed to him that are not in harmony with the character and mission of Messiah as set forth in the Book of Mormon, still one may trace the outlines of Messiah's advent and labors among the Nephites in the career of Quetzalcohuatl, as also the qualities of his divinity in what tradition ascribes to the Aztec deity. As for those adventures and human qualities found in Quetzalcohuatl not properly ascribable to Messiah, they arise, doubtless, out of the fact that the native traditions have confounded some of the exploits and characteristics of other great personages who have figured in their history with those of Messiah.  In order that the reader may have a fairly full account of what is said of this American man-divinity, I shall quote what several reliable authorities have said of him, beginning with Prescott:      A far more interesting personage in their [i. e. the Mexicans]     mythology was Quetzalcohuatl, god of the air, a divinity, during     his residence on earth, instructed the natives in the use of     metals, in agriculture, and in the arts of government. He was one     of those benefactors of their species, doubtless, who have been     deified by gratitude of posterity. Under him, the earth teemed     with fruits and flowers, without the pains of culture. An ear of     Indian corn was as much as a single man could carry. The cotton,     as it grew took of its own accord, the rich dyes of human art. The     air was filled with intoxicating perfumes and the sweet melody of     birds. In short, these were the halcyon days, which find a place     in the mythic systems of so many nations in the Old World. It     was the golden age of Anahuac. From some cause, not explained,     Quetzalcohuatl, incurred the wrath of one of the principal gods,     and was compelled to abandon the country. On his way, he stopped at     the city of Cholula, where a temple was dedicated to his worship,     the massy ruins of which still form one of the most interesting     relics of antiquity in Mexico. When he reached the shores of the     Mexican Gulf, he took leave of his followers, promising that he and     his descendants would visit them hereafter, and then, entering his     wizard skiff, made of serpents' skins, embarked on the great ocean     for the fabled land of Tlapallan. He was said to have been tall in     stature, with a white skin, long, dark hair, and a flowing beard.     The Mexicans looked confidently to the return of the benevolent     deity; and this remarkable tradition, deeply cherished in their     hearts, prepared the way. * * * * * * for the future success of the     Spaniards. [23]  After referring to the numerous, lengthy, intricate and even contradictory legendary statements of the American aborigines which in full may only be learned from the elaborate works of Brasseur de Bourbourg, Lord Kingsborough, and H. H. Bancroft--P. De Roo remarks:      It is the universal opinion of the learned that Quetzalcohuatl is     identically the same personage with the contemporary religious and     civil reformer whom various nations have deified under different     names; that he is the same with Huemac or Vemac, as the Mexicans     also called him; with Topilitzin, as he was more anciently known     in Tulla by the Toltecs; with Wixipecocha, under whose name he was     venerated by the Zapotecs; with Zamna, Cozas, or Cukulcan, the     theocratic ruler of Yucatan; nay, with Bochica, the civilizer of     Cundinamarca of New Granada, and with Viracocha of Peru.  In the remainder of the quotation from our author, he speaks of this one person under his various names and titles:      Quetzalcohuatl arrived at Tulla, the Toltec capital, from Panuco,     a small place on the Gulf of Mexico, where he had first landed.     Duran likewise relates that Topilitzin was a foreigner, but could     not learn from what parts he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],["title","New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#6)"],["body"," come. His name, given him by the     natives, signified \"Beautiful feathered serpent.\" Culkulcan, his     Maya or Yucatec appellation, had exactly the same meaning. It was     the name of princes and Toltec kings, and probably designates     some honorable title, which, if we should make a few learned     considerations, might be found to be the Great or the Glorious     man of the country. * * * * * * The Indians remembered well that     their god Quetzalcohuatl had not been like one of themselves. They     described him as a white or pale faced man, of portly person, with     broad forehead, great eyes, long black hair, and a heavy rounded     beard. The Zapotecan Wixipecocha was also a white-skinned apostle,     and the Toltecan Topilitzin is described as having all the same     features, to which Duran adds that his beard was of a fair color     and his nose rather large. He was very reserved in his manners,     plain and meek with those who approached him, passing most of his     time in meditation and prayer in his cell, and showing himself but     seldom to the people. * * * * * * * * Very abstemious at all times,     Topilitzen often observed long and rigorous fasts, practicing     severe penances and even bloody self-chastisements, as is likewise     stated of the homologous Quetzalcohuatl.      De las Casas testifies that Quetzalcohuatl lived a most honest and     chaste life; Sahagun, that he never married nor ever was in the     company of a woman, except in the act of auricular confession.     While, according to traditional report, he was born of a virgin     mother. Herrea states that he remained a virgin himself. The     Yucatec legends also notice the celibacy of Cukulcan and his     general purity of morals. * * * Quetzalcohuatl is described as     having worn during life, for the sake of modesty, a garment that     reached down to his feet. * * * * * For shoes, Cukulcan wore     sandals, walked along bare-headed; nor is it said that his mantle     was, like that of his equivalent Wexipecocha, provided with a     monk's cowl for head-gear. From the Mexican traditions we learn     that Quetzalcohuatl, also, wore a cloak, which Bancroft calls a     blanket over all, in one place, and a long white robe, in another;     adding that, according to Gormara, it was decorated with crosses.     [24]  It would be impossible within the proposed limits of this work to quote at length what has been written of this mysterious personage of the western world; whose character and career in so many respects are like that of the Hebrew Messiah, as he appeared in the western world. From this point I can only summarize and quote briefly respecting him, leaving the reader interested in the subject to make larger research in the works cited in the margins. [25]  And now first as to the personal appearance of Quetzalcohuatl:      He was a white man, of portly person, broad brow, great eyes, long     black hair, and large round head, or exceedingly chaste, and quiet     life, and of great moderation in all things. [26] * * * * * * * *     Quetzalcohuatl is said to be a white man (some gave him a bright,     red face), with a strong formation of body, broad forehead, large     eyes, black hair, and a heavy beard. He always wore a long white     robe; which, according to Gomara, was decorated with crosses. (J.     G. Muller quoted by Bancroft, Native Races, Vol. III., pp. 273,     274.)  In the Book of Mormon account of the advent of Messiah among the Nephites there is no description given of his features or person. This, upon first thought, may seem singular; and yet it is in strictest harmony with human conduct in the presence of such an event. Over-awed by the fact of the presence of a heavenly personage men are liable to take no note of features or color of the eyes or hair or any details of personal appearance. It is not until men are removed from the awe-inspiring circumstance itself that they begin to think of details connected with a heavenly apparition. I think it probable, therefore, that not until after the Nephite accounts were written of the personal ministrations of Jesus did those who beheld him begin to think out the details of his personal appearance; hence we have no description of him in their written annals, but we find it preserved--but perhaps with more or less of error in it--in the traditions of the people.  As to his general character while on earth the following is of importance:      This Quetzalcohuatl was god of the air, and as such had his temple,     of a round shape and very magnificent. He was made god of the air     for the mildness and gentleness of all his ways, not liking the     sharp and harsh measures to which the other gods were so strongly     inclined. It is to be said further that his life on earth was     marked by intensely religious characteristics; not only was he     devoted to the careful observance of all the old customary forms     of worship, but he himself ordained and appointed many new rites,     ceremonies, and festivals [27] for the adoration of the gods;     [28] and it is held for certain that he made the calendar. [29]     He had priests who were called Quequetzalcohua, that is to say     \"priests of the order of Quetzalcohuatl.\" [30] The memory of him     was engraved deeply upon the minds of the people, and it is said     that when barren women prayed and made sacrifices to him, children     were given them. [31] He was, as we have said, god of the winds,     and the power of causing them to blow was attributed to him as well     as the power of calming or causing their fury to cease. It was said     further that he swept the road, so that the gods called Tlaloques     could rain; this the people imagined because ordinarily a month     or more before the rains began there blew strong winds throughout     all New Spain. Quetzalcohuatl is described as having worn during     life, for the sake of modesty, garments that reached down to the     feet, with a blanket over all, sown with red crosses. The Cholulans     preserved certain green stones that had belonged to him, regarding     them with great veneration and esteeming them as relics. * * * *     * * He also arranged the calendar, and taught his subjects fit     religious ceremonies; preaching specially against human sacrifices,     and ordering offerings of fruits and flowers only. He would have     nothing to do with the wars, even covering his ears when the     subject was mentioned. His was a veritable golden age, as in the     time of Saturn; animals and even men lived in peace, the soil     produced the richest harvests without cultivation, and the grain     grew so large that a man found it trouble enough to carry one ear;     no cotton was dyed, as it grew of all colors, and fruits of all     kinds abounded. Everybody was rich and Quetzalcohuatl owned whole     palaces of gold, silver and precious stones. The air was filled     with the most pleasant aromas, and a host of finely feathered birds     filled the world with melody. [32]  So, too, the following:      Only Quetzalcohuatl among all the gods was pre-eminently called     Lord; in such sort, that when any one swore, saying, By our Lord,     he meant Quetzalcohuatl and no other; though there were many other     highly esteemed gods. For indeed the service of this god was     gentle, neither did he demand hard things, but light; and he taught     only virtue, abhorring all evil and hurt. Twenty years this good     deity remained in Cholula, then he passed away by the road he had     come, carrying with him four of the principal and most virtuous     youths of that city. He journeyed for a hundred and fifty leagues,     till he came to the sea, in a distant province called Goatzacoalco.     Here he took leave of his companions and sent them back to their     city, instructing them to tell their fellow citizens that a day     should come in which the white men would land upon their coasts,     by the way of the sea in which the sun rises; brethren of his and     having beards like his; and that they should rule that land. [33]     The Mexicans always waited for the accomplishment of this prophecy,     and when the Spaniards came they took them for the descendants of     their meek and gentle prophet, although, as Mendieta remarks with     some sarcasm, when they came to know them and to experience their     works, they thought otherwise. [34]  Relative to Quetzalcohuatl in his capacity of Deity I shall quote the following passage from Lord Kingsborough's great work as representing the sum of his extensive research upon the subject and its elaborate presentation:      How truly surprising it is to find the Mexicans, who seem to     have been quite unacquainted with the doctrines of the migration     of the soul and the metempsychosis, should have believed in the     incarnation of the only son of their supreme god Tonacatecutle.     For Mexican mythology speaking of no other son of that God except     Quetzalcohuatl, who was born of Chimalman, the virgin of Tula,     without connection with man, and by his breath alone, (by which     may be signified his word or his will, announced to Chimalman by     word of mouth of the celestial messenger, whom he dispatched to     inform her that she should conceive a son), it must be presumed     that Quetzalcohuatl was his only son. [35] Other arguments might     be adduced to show, that the Mexicans believed that Quetzalcohuatl     was both god and man, that he had previously to his incarnation,     existed from all eternity, [36] that he had created both the world     and man, [37] that he descended from heaven to reform the world by     penance, that he was born with the perfect use of reason, that he     preached a new law, and, being king of Tula, was crucified for the     sins of mankind, as is obscurely insinuated by the interpreter of     the Vatican Codex, plainly declared in the traditions of"]]]
