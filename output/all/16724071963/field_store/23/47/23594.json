Have you any friends in New York, any of you?\"  \"I have a few,\" said Dotty, as the inquiring glance turned in her direction.  \"Invite them to the house when you choose,\" said Mr. Forbes, hospitably, if curtly.  \"Oh, no, sir,\" said Dotty, quickly. \"They wouldn't fit in.\"  Mr. Forbes chuckled. \"You have a sense of the fitness of things, Miss Rosy. Why wouldn't they fit in?\"  \"Why, they're plain people. Not grand and elegant like you.\"  \"Oho! So I'm grand and elegant, am I? And are you grand and elegant, too?\"  Dotty considered. \"Yes,\" she said, finally, \"I am, while I'm here. I'm very adaptable, and while I'm in New York, I mean to be just as grand and elegant as the house itself.\"  Mr. Forbes burst into hearty laughter. \"Good for you!\" he cried. \"When you're in Rome do as the Romans do. And you, Fairy of the golden curls. Are you going to be grand, also?\"  \"I can't,\" returned Dolly, simply. \"I can only be myself, wherever I am. But I shall enjoy all the beautiful things as much as Dotty.\"  Again Mr. Forbes laughed. \"You're a great pair,\" he said. \"I'm glad I discovered you. And now, Bernice and Alicia, haven't you any young friends in town you'd like to invite to see you here? Remember the house is yours.\"  \"Oh, Uncle Jeff,\" cried Alicia, \"you are too good! Do you mean it? Can we do just as we like? Invite parties, and all that?\"  \"Yes, indeed. Why not? Have the best time possible, and see to it that those two little friends of yours have a good time, too.\"  \"But won't you go with us anywhere?\" asked Bernice; \"I thought you'd take us to see places where we can't go alone.\"  \"Bless my soul! Take a lot of chattering magpies sightseeing! No, not if I know it! Mrs. Berry will take you; and on a pinch, I might let my secretary accompany you, say to see the downtown big buildings or the bright lights at night.\"  \"Oh, do you have a secretary?\" asked Alicia. \"What's he like?\"  \"Fenn? Oh, he's a good sort. Very dependable and really accommodating. He'll be of great help to you, I'm sure.\"  \"What is your business, Mr. Forbes?\" asked Dolly, who was much interested in this strange type of man. She had never seen any one like him, and he seemed to her a sort of fairy godfather, who waved his wand and gave them all sorts of wonderful gifts.  \"I haven't any business, my dear. My occupation and amusement is collecting specimens for my collection. I am an entomologist and ornithologist, if you know what those big words mean.\"  \"Yes, sir, I do.\" And Dolly smiled back at him. \"Mayn't we see your collection?\"  \"I'm not sure about that, I don't show it to everybody. It is up on the fourth floor of this house, and no one is allowed up there unless accompanied by myself or Mr. Fenn. By the way, remember that, all of you. On no account go up to the fourth floor. Not that you'd be likely to, for you have no call above the second floor, where your rooms are. But this is a special command. The house is yours, as I said, but that means only this first floor and the one above it.\"  \"Goodness me, Uncle Jeff!\" said Alicia, \"you needn't lay down the law so hard! We're not absolute babes, to be so strictly cautioned and forbidden! If you desire us not to go up the second flight of stairs, of course we won't.\"  \"That's right, my dear, don't. But I do lay it down as a law, and it is the only law I shall impose on you. Except for that you can follow out your own sweet wills.\"  \"But,\" said Dotty, her dark eyes brilliant with the excitement of the occasion, \"I'm not always sure as to what is proper. I want to do just what is right. Is it correct for us to go about alone, in your big motor, with your chauffeur? Can we go to the art galleries and the shops alone?\"  \"Bless my soul! I don't know.\" The big man looked absolutely helpless. \"Surely you must know such things yourselves. What do your mothers let you do at home? Oh, well, if you're uncertain, ask Mrs. Berry, she'll know. She's an all-round capable person, and she'll know all the unwritten laws about chaperonage and such things. Do as she bids you.\"  This was satisfactory, and Dotty began at once to make plans for the next day.  \"Let's go to the Metropolitan Museum first,\" she said.  \"All right,\" chimed in Alicia, \"we'll go there in the morning, then. But to-morrow is Wednesday, and I want to go to a matinee in the afternoon. Can't we, Uncle Jeff?\"  \"Of course you can. Tell Fenn, he'll see about tickets for you. Just tell Mrs. Berry to see Fenn about it.\"  \"Oh,\" sighed the outspoken Dotty, \"it is just like Fairyland! Tell Fenn! Just as if Fenn were a magician!\"  \"He is,\" said Mr. Forbes, smiling at her enthusiasm. \"I couldn't keep house without Fenn. He's my right hand man for everything. You girls mustn't claim too much of his time and attention, for I keep him on the jump most of the time myself.\"  \"Does your collection keep you so busy?\" asked Dolly, whose secret longing was to see that same collection, which greatly interested her.  \"Yes, indeed. There's always work to be done in connection with it. I've a lot of new specimens just arrived to-day, awaiting classification and tabulation.\"  After dinner they all returned to the drawing-room. Mr. Forbes seemed desirous of keeping up a general conversation, but it was hard to find a subject to interest him. He would talk a few moments, and then lapse into absent-mindedness and almost forget the girls' presence.  At times, he would get up from his chair, and stalk up and down the room, perhaps suddenly pausing in front of one of them, and asking a direct question.  \"How old are you?\" he asked abruptly of Alicia.  \"Sixteen,\" she replied. \"I was sixteen last October.\"  \"You look like your mother at that age. She was my only sister. She has now been dead--\"  \"Ten years,\" prompted Alicia. \"I was a little child when she died.\"  \"And who looks after you now? Your father's sister, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, Uncle Jeff. My Aunt Nellie. But I'm at school, you know. I shall be there the next four years, I suppose.\"  \"Yes, yes, to be sure. Yes, yes, of course. And you, Bernice? You have no mother, either. But who looks after you?\"  \"I look after myself, Uncle. Father thinks there's no necessity for me to have a chaperon in our little home town.\"  \"Not a chaperon, child, but you ought to have some one to guide and teach you.\"  \"Dad doesn't think so. He says an American girl can take care of herself.\"  \"Maybe so, maybe so. It might be a good thing for you to go to school with Alicia.\"  \"It might be. But I like our High School at home, and we learn a lot there.\"  \"But not the same kind of learning. Do they teach you manners and general society instruction?\"  \"No,\" said Bernice, smiling at thought of such things in connection with the Berwick school. \"But my father thinks those things come naturally to girls of good families.\"  \"Maybe so, maybe so.\" And then Mr. Forbes again walked up and down the long room, seemingly lost in his own thoughts.  Dolly and Dotty felt a little uncomfortable. They wanted to make themselves agreeable and entertaining, but their host seemed interested exclusively in his young relatives, and they hesitated lest they intrude.  As it neared ten o'clock, Mr. Forbes paused in his pacing of the room, bowed to each of the four in turn, and then saying, courteously, \"I bid you goodnight,\" he vanished into the hall.  Immediately Mrs. Berry entered. It seemed a relief to see her kind, smiling face after the uncertain phases of their eccentric host.  \"Now you young people must go to bed,\" the housekeeper said; \"you're tired,--or ought to be. Come along.\"  Not at all unwillingly they followed her upstairs, and she looked after their comfort in most solicitous fashion.  After she had shown them how to ring the various bells to call the maids or to call her, in emergency, and had drawn their attention to the ice water in thermos bottles, and told them how to adjust the ventilators, she bade them good-night and went away.  The rooms had a communicating door, and this Alicia promptly threw open and came through into the two D's room.  \"Oh, isn't it all the greatest fun! And did you EVER see anything so crazy as Uncle Jeff? What he wants us here for, _I_ don't know! But it's something,--and something especial. He never asked us here to amuse him! Of that I'm certain.\"  \"Not much he didn't!\" and Bernice followed Alicia, and perched on the edge of Dolly's bed. \"Isn't he queer? I didn't know he was so funny as he is. Did you, Alicia?\"  \"No; I haven't seen him since I was a tiny mite. But he's all right. He knows what he's about and I don't wonder he doesn't want us bothering around if he's busy.\"  \"I'd love to see his collection,\" said Dolly. \"I'm awfully interested in such things.\"  \"Oh, well, you'll probably have a chance to see it while we're here,\" and Alicia began taking down her hair. \"Now, girls, let's get to bed, for I'm jolly well tired out. But I foresee these poky evenings right along, don't you? We'll have to cram a lot of fun into our days, if the evenings are to be spent watching an elderly gentleman stalking around thus.\" And then Alicia gave a very good imitation of the way Mr. Forbes walked around. She didn't ridicule him; she merely burlesqued his manner as he paused to speak to them in his funny, abrupt way.  \"What are you, my dear?\" she said, looking at Dolly. \"Are you a specimen I can use in my collection? No? Are you a fashionable butterfly? I say, Bernice,\" she suddenly broke off, \"why was he so curious about the way we live at home, and who brings us up?\"  \"I don't know; and anyway, he knew how long our mothers have been dead and who takes care of us. Why did he ask those things over and over?\"  \"I think he's a bit absent-minded. Half the time he was thinking of matters far removed from this charming quartette of bewitching beauties. Well, it's up to us to make our own good time. I move we corral the big limousine for to-morrow morning and go in search of adventure.\"  \"To the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5893"],["title","Two Little Women on a Holiday (#6)"],["body","etropolitan?\" suggested Dolly.  \"Yes, if you like, though I'd rather go to the shops,\" and Alicia gathered up her hairpins to depart. Her long light hair hung round her shoulders, and she pushed it back as she affectionately kissed Dolly and Dotty good-night. \"You are sure two darlings!\" she said emphatically.     CHAPTER V  GOING ABOUT   Four smiling, eager girls trooped down to breakfast the next morning, and found Mrs. Berry awaiting them. She presided at the table, and they learned that she would always do so at breakfast and luncheon, though she did not dine with them.  \"Uncle Jeff says we may go to a matinee to-day,\" said Alicia, delightedly. \"Will you see about the tickets, Mrs. Berry? Uncle said Mr. Fenn would get them if you asked him to.\"  \"Yes, my dear. And what are your plans for the morning? Do you want the car?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Bernice. \"We're going to the Museum and I don't know where else.\"  \"To the Library, if we have time,\" suggested Dolly. \"I want to see all the places of interest.\"  \"Places of interest never interest me,\" declared Alicia. \"I think they're poky.\"  \"All right,\" returned Dolly, good-naturedly, \"I'll go wherever you like.\"  \"Now, don't be so ready to give in, Doll,\" cautioned Bernice. \"You have as much right to your way as Alicia has to hers.\"  \"No, I haven't,\" and Dolly smiled brightly; \"this is the house of Alicia's uncle, and not mine.\"  \"Well, he's my uncle, too, and what I say goes, as much as Alicia's commands.\"  \"There, there, girls, don't quarrel,\" said Mrs. Berry, in her amiable way. \"Surely you can all be suited. There are two cars, you know, and if you each want to go in a different direction, I'll call taxi-cabs for you.\"  Dolly and Dotty stared at this new lavishness, and Dotty said, quickly, \"Oh, no, don't do that! We all want to be together, wherever we go. And I think, as Dolly does, that Bernice and Alicia must choose, for they belong here and we're guests.\"  \"You're two mighty well-behaved little guests,\" and Mrs. Berry beamed at them. \"Well, settle it among yourselves. Now, what matinee do you want to go to? I'll order tickets for you.\"  \"Will you go with us, Mrs. Berry?\" asked Dolly.  \"No, child. I hope you'll let me off. You girls are old enough to go alone in the daytime, and Kirke will take you and come to fetch you home. Now, what play?\"  \"I want to see 'The Lass and the Lascar'; that's a jolly thing, I hear,\" said Alicia, as no one else suggested anything.  \"Musical?\" asked Bernice.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Berry, \"it's a comic opera, and a very good one. I've seen it, and I'm sure you girls will enjoy it. I'll order seats for that. Be sure to be home for luncheon promptly at one, so you can get ready for the theatre.\"  \"I can't believe it all,\" whispered Dotty, pinching Dolly's arm, as they ran upstairs to prepare for their morning's trip. \"Think of our going to all these places in one day!\"  \"And six days more to come!\" added Dolly. \"Oh, it is too gorgeous!\"  Arrayed in warm coats and furs, the laughing quartette got into the big car, and George, the polite footman, adjusted the robes, and asked their destination.  \"To the Metropolitan Museum, first,\" said Alicia, unselfishly.  \"Oh,\" cried Dolly, with sparkling eyes, \"are we really going there first! How good of you, Alicia!\"  And from the moment they entered the vestibule of the great museum, Dolly was enthralled with what she saw. Like one in a trance, she walked from room to room, drinking in the beauty or strangeness of the exhibits. She ignored the catalogues, merely gazing at the pictures or curios with an absorbed attention that made her oblivious to all else.  \"Watch her,\" said Alicia, nudging Dotty. \"She doesn't even know where she is! Just now, she's back in Assyria with the people that wore that old jewellery!\"  Sure enough Dolly was staring into a case of antique bracelets and earrings of gold and jewels. She moved along the length of the case, noting each piece, and fairly sighing with admiration and wonder.  \"My gracious! isn't she the antiquarian!\" exclaimed Alicia. \"Look here, old Professor Wiseacre, what dynasty does this junk belong to?\"  Dolly looked up with a vacant stare.  \"Come back to earth!\" cried Alicia, shaking with laughter. \"Come back to the twentieth century! We mourn our loss!\"  \"Yes, come back, Dollums,\" said Dotty. \"There are other rooms full of stuff awaiting your approval.\"  Dolly laughed. \"Oh, you girls don't appreciate What you're seeing. Just think! Women wore these very things! Real, live women!\"  \"Well, they're not alive now,\" said Bernice, \"and we are. So give us the pleasure of your company. Say, Dolly, some day you come up here all alone by yourself, and prowl around--\"  \"Oh, I'd love to! I'll do just that. And then I won't feel that I'm delaying you girls. Where do you want to go now?\"  \"Anywhere out of this old museum,\" said Alicia, a little pettishly. \"You've had your way, Dotty, now it's only fair I should have mine. We've about an hour left; let's go to the shops.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" and Dolly spoke emphatically. \"I didn't realise that I was being a selfish old piggy-wig!\"  \"And you're not,\" defended Bernice. \"We all wanted to come here, but, well, you see, Dolly, you do dawdle.\"  \"But it's such a wonder-place!\" and Dolly gazed longingly backward as they left the antiquities. \"And there are rooms we haven't even looked into yet.\"  \"Dozens of 'em,\" assented Alicia. \"But not this morning, my chickabiddy! I must flee to the busy marts and see what's doing in the way of tempting bargains.\"  \"All right,\" and Dolly put her arm through Alicia's. \"What are you going to buy?\"  \"Dunno, till I see something that strikes my fancy. But in the paper this morning, I noticed a special sale of 'Pastime Toggery' at Follansbee's. Let's go there.\"  \"Never heard of the place,\" said Dolly. \"But let's go.\"  \"Never heard of Follansbee's! Why, it's the smartest shop in New York for sport clothes.\"  \"Is it? We never get sport clothes. Unless you mean middies and sweaters. My mother buys those at the department stores.\"  \"Oh, you can't get exclusive models there!\" and Alicia's face wore a reproving expression.  \"No,\" said outspoken Dolly, \"but we don't wear exclusive models. We're rather inclusive, I expect.\"  \"You're a duck!\" cried Alicia, who, though ultra-fashionable herself, liked the honesty and frankness of the two D's.  They reached the shop in question, and the four girls went in.  The Berwick girls were a little awed at the atmosphere of the place, but Alicia was entirely mistress of the situation. She had many costumes and accessories shown to her, and soon became as deeply absorbed in their contemplation as Dolly had been in the Museum exhibits.  \"Why, for goodness' sake!\" cried Bernice, at last. \"Are you going to buy out the whole shop, Alicia?\"  \"Why, I'm not going to buy any,\" returned Alicia, looking surprised; \"I'm just shopping, you know.\"  \"Oh, is that it? Well, let me tell you it isn't any particular fun for us to look on while you 'shop'! And, anyway, it's time to be going home, or we'll be late for the luncheon and for the matinee.\"  \"All right, I'll go now. But wait. I want to buy some little thing for you girls,--sort of a souvenir, you know.\"  \"Good for you!\" said Bernice, but Dolly demurred.  \"I don't think you ought to, Alicia,\" she said. \"I don't believe my mother would like me to take it.\"  \"Nonsense, Towhead! I'm just going to get trifles. Nobody could object to my giving you a tiny token of my regard and esteem. Let me see,--how about silk sweaters? They're always handy to have in the house.\"  Unheeding the girls' protestations, Alicia selected four lovely colours, and asked the saleswoman to get the right sizes.  Dolly's was robin's egg blue; Dotty's salmon pink; Bernice's, a deep orange, and Alicia's own was white, as she declared she already had every colour of the rainbow.  Then she selected an old rose one for Mrs. Berry, getting permission to exchange it if it should be a misfit.  Alicia ordered the sweaters sent to her uncle's house, and the bill sent to her father. This arrangement seemed perfectly satisfactory to the shop people, and the girls set off for home.  \"I feel uncomfortable about that sweater,\" announced Dolly, as they were on their way.  \"That doesn't matter,\" laughed Alicia, \"so long as you don't feel uncomfortable in it! Remove that anxious scowl, my little Towhead; I love to give things to my friends, and you must learn to accept trifles gracefully.\"  \"But it isn't a trifle, Alicia. I know mother won't like it.\"  \"Won't like that blue sweater! Why, it's a beauty!\"  \"I don't mean that. I mean she won't like for me to take it,--to accept it from you.\"  \"All right; tell her you bought it yourself.\"  \"Tell a story about it! No, thank you.\" Dolly's blue eyes fairly flashed at the thought.  \"Well, my stars! Dolly, don't make such a fuss about it! Throw it away, or give it to the scullery maid! You don't have to keep it!\"  Clearly, Alicia was annoyed. Dolly was far from ungrateful, and she didn't know quite what to do.  \"Of course, she'll keep it,\" Dotty broke in, anxious to straighten matters out. \"She adores it, Alicia; but we girls aren't accustomed to making each other gifts,--at least, not expensive ones.\"  \"Well, you needn't make a habit of it. One sweater doesn't make a summer! I hope Mrs. Berry won't be so squeamish! If I thought she would, I'd throw hers in the ash barrel before I'd give it to her!\"  \"I s'pose I was horrid about it, Alicia,\" said Dolly, contritely; \"I do love it, really, you know I do; but, as Dotty says, we never give such gifts. Why, I can't give you anything to make up for it--\"  \"And I don't want you to! You little goose! But like as not, you can sometime do something for me worth more than a dozen sweaters.\"  \"I hope so, I'm sure. Will you tell me if I can?\"  \"Yes, baby-face! I declare, Dolly, it's hard to realise you're fifteen years old! You act about twelve,--and look ten!\"  \"Oh, not so bad as that!\" and"]]]
