He said that his \"government,\" when it came in possession of all its territory, would hold him personally responsible for the claims he had surrendered to the provost-marshal.  His impudence was so sublime that I was rather amused than indignant.  I told him, however, that if he would remain in Memphis I did not believe the Confederate government would ever molest him.  He left, no doubt, as much amazed at my assurance as I was at the brazenness of his request.  On the 11th of July General Halleck received telegraphic orders appointing him to the command of all the armies, with headquarters in Washington.  His instructions pressed him to proceed to his new field of duty with as little delay as was consistent with the safety and interests of his previous command.  I was next in rank, and he telegraphed me the same day to report at department headquarters at Corinth.  I was not informed by the dispatch that my chief had been ordered to a different field and did not know whether to move my headquarters or not.  I telegraphed asking if I was to take my staff with me, and received word in reply:  \"This place will be your headquarters.  You can judge for yourself.\"  I left Memphis for my new field without delay, and reached Corinth on the 15th of the month. General Halleck remained until the 17th of July; but he was very uncommunicative, and gave me no information as to what I had been called to Corinth for.  When General Halleck left to assume the duties of general-in-chief I remained in command of the district of West Tennessee.  Practically I became a department commander, because no one was assigned to that position over me and I made my reports direct to the general-in-chief; but I was not assigned to the position of department commander until the 25th of October.  General Halleck while commanding the Department of the Mississippi had had control as far east as a line drawn from Chattanooga north.  My district only embraced West Tennessee and Kentucky west of the Cumberland River.  Buell, with the Army of the Ohio, had, as previously stated, been ordered east towards Chattanooga, with instructions to repair the Memphis and Charleston railroad as he advanced.  Troops had been sent north by Halleck along the line of the Mobile and Ohio railroad to put it in repair as far as Columbus.  Other troops were stationed on the railroad from Jackson, Tennessee, to Grand Junction, and still others on the road west to Memphis.  The remainder of the magnificent army of 120,000 men which entered Corinth on the 30th of May had now become so scattered that I was put entirely on the defensive in a territory whose population was hostile to the Union.  One of the first things I had to do was to construct fortifications at Corinth better suited to the garrison that could be spared to man them.  The structures that had been built during the months of May and June were left as monuments to the skill of the engineer, and others were constructed in a few days, plainer in design but suited to the command available to defend them.  I disposed the troops belonging to the district in conformity with the situation as rapidly as possible.  The forces at Donelson, Clarksville and Nashville, with those at Corinth and along the railroad eastward, I regarded as sufficient for protection against any attack from the west. The Mobile and Ohio railroad was guarded from Rienzi, south of Corinth, to Columbus; and the Mississippi Central railroad from Jackson, Tennessee, to Bolivar.  Grand Junction and La Grange on the Memphis railroad were abandoned.  South of the Army of the Tennessee, and confronting it, was Van Dorn, with a sufficient force to organize a movable army of thirty-five to forty thousand men, after being reinforced by Price from Missouri.  This movable force could be thrown against either Corinth, Bolivar or Memphis; and the best that could be done in such event would be to weaken the points not threatened in order to reinforce the one that was. Nothing could be gained on the National side by attacking elsewhere, because the territory already occupied was as much as the force present could guard.  The most anxious period of the war, to me, was during the time the Army of the Tennessee was guarding the territory acquired by the fall of Corinth and Memphis and before I was sufficiently reinforced to take the offensive.  The enemy also had cavalry operating in our rear, making it necessary to guard every point of the railroad back to Columbus, on the security of which we were dependent for all our supplies. Headquarters were connected by telegraph with all points of the command except Memphis and the Mississippi below Columbus.  With these points communication was had by the railroad to Columbus, then down the river by boat.  To reinforce Memphis would take three or four days, and to get an order there for troops to move elsewhere would have taken at least two days.  Memphis therefore was practically isolated from the balance of the command.  But it was in Sherman's hands.  Then too the troops were well intrenched and the gunboats made a valuable auxiliary.  During the two months after the departure of General Halleck there was much fighting between small bodies of the contending armies, but these encounters were dwarfed by the magnitude of the main battles so as to be now almost forgotten except by those engaged in them.  Some of them, however, estimated by the losses on both sides in killed and wounded, were equal in hard fighting to most of the battles of the Mexican war which attracted so much of the attention of the public when they occurred.  About the 23d of July Colonel Ross, commanding at Bolivar, was threatened by a large force of the enemy so that he had to be reinforced from Jackson and Corinth.  On the 27th there was skirmishing on the Hatchie River, eight miles from Bolivar. On the 30th I learned from Colonel P. H. Sheridan, who had been far to the south, that Bragg in person was at Rome, Georgia, with his troops moving by rail (by way of Mobile) to Chattanooga and his wagon train marching overland to join him at Rome.  Price was at this time at Holly Springs, Mississippi, with a large force, and occupied Grand Junction as an outpost.  I proposed to the general-in-chief to be permitted to drive him away, but was informed that, while I had to judge for myself, the best use to make of my troops WAS NOT TO SCATTER THEM, but hold them ready to reinforce Buell.  The movement of Bragg himself with his wagon trains to Chattanooga across country, while his troops were transported over a long round-about road to the same destination, without need of guards except when in my immediate front, demonstrates the advantage which troops enjoy while acting in a country where the people are friendly.  Buell was marching through a hostile region and had to have his communications thoroughly guarded back to a base of supplies.  More men were required the farther the National troops penetrated into the enemy's country.  I, with an army sufficiently powerful to have destroyed Bragg, was purely on the defensive and accomplishing no more than to hold a force far inferior to my own.  On the 2d of August I was ordered from Washington to live upon the country, on the resources of citizens hostile to the government, so far as practicable.  I was also directed to \"handle rebels within our lines without gloves,\" to imprison them, or to expel them from their homes and from our lines.  I do not recollect having arrested and confined a citizen (not a soldier) during the entire rebellion.  I am aware that a great many were sent to northern prisons, particularly to Joliet, Illinois, by some of my subordinates with the statement that it was my order.  I had all such released the moment I learned of their arrest; and finally sent a staff officer north to release every prisoner who was said to be confined by my order.  There were many citizens at home who deserved punishment because they were soldiers when an opportunity was afforded to inflict an injury to the National cause.  This class was not of the kind that were apt to get arrested, and I deemed it better that a few guilty men should escape than that a great many innocent ones should suffer.  On the 14th of August I was ordered to send two more divisions to Buell. They were sent the same day by way of Decatur.  On the 22d Colonel Rodney Mason surrendered Clarksville with six companies of his regiment.  Colonel Mason was one of the officers who had led their regiments off the field at almost the first fire of the rebels at Shiloh.  He was by nature and education a gentleman, and was terribly mortified at his action when the battle was over.  He came to me with tears in his eyes and begged to be allowed to have another trial.  I felt great sympathy for him and sent him, with his regiment, to garrison Clarksville and Donelson.  He selected Clarksville for his headquarters, no doubt because he regarded it as the post of danger, it being nearer the enemy. But when he was summoned to surrender by a band of guerillas, his constitutional weakness overcame him.  He inquired the number of men the enemy had, and receiving a response indicating a force greater than his own he said if he could be satisfied of that fact he would surrender. Arrangements were made for him to count the guerillas, and having satisfied himself that the enemy had the greater force he surrendered and informed his subordinate at Donelson of the fact, advising him to do the same.  The guerillas paroled their prisoners and moved upon Donelson, but the officer in command at that point marched out to meet them and drove them away.  Among other embarrassments, at the time of which I now"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5862"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 3. (#2)"],["body","e, was the fact that the government wanted to get out all the cotton possible from the South and directed me to give every facility toward that end.  Pay in gold was authorized, and stations on the Mississippi River and on the railroad in our possession had to be designated where cotton would be received.  This opened to the enemy not only the means of converting cotton into money, which had a value all over the world and which they so much needed, but it afforded them means of obtaining accurate and intelligent information in regard to our position and strength.  It was also demoralizing to the troops.  Citizens obtaining permits from the treasury department had to be protected within our lines and given facilities to get out cotton by which they realized enormous profits. Men who had enlisted to fight the battles of their country did not like to be engaged in protecting a traffic which went to the support of an enemy they had to fight, and the profits of which went to men who shared none of their dangers.  On the 30th of August Colonel M. D. Leggett, near Bolivar, with the 20th and 29th Ohio volunteer infantry, was attacked by a force supposed to be about 4,000 strong.  The enemy was driven away with a loss of more than one hundred men.  On the 1st of September the bridge guard at Medon was attacked by guerillas. The guard held the position until reinforced, when the enemy were routed leaving about fifty of their number on the field dead or wounded, our loss being only two killed and fifteen wounded.  On the same day Colonel Dennis, with a force of less than 500 infantry and two pieces of artillery, met the cavalry of the enemy in strong force, a few miles west of Medon, and drove them away with great loss.  Our troops buried 179 of the enemy's dead, left upon the field. Afterwards it was found that all the houses in the vicinity of the battlefield were turned into hospitals for the wounded.  Our loss, as reported at the time, was forty-five killed and wounded.  On the 2d of September I was ordered to send more reinforcements to Buell.  Jackson and Bolivar were yet threatened, but I sent the reinforcements.  On the 4th I received direct orders to send Granger's division also to Louisville, Kentucky.  General Buell had left Corinth about the 10th of June to march upon Chattanooga; Bragg, who had superseded Beauregard in command, sent one division from Tupelo on the 27th of June for the same place.  This gave Buell about seventeen days' start. If he had not been required to repair the railroad as he advanced, the march could have been made in eighteen days at the outside, and Chattanooga must have been reached by the National forces before the rebels could have possibly got there.  The road between Nashville and Chattanooga could easily have been put in repair by other troops, so that communication with the North would have been opened in a short time after the occupation of the place by the National troops.  If Buell had been permitted to move in the first instance, with the whole of the Army of the Ohio and that portion of the Army of the Mississippi afterwards sent to him, he could have thrown four divisions from his own command along the line of road to repair and guard it.  Granger's division was promptly sent on the 4th of September.  I was at the station at Corinth when the troops reached that point, and found General P. H. Sheridan with them.  I expressed surprise at seeing him and said that I had not expected him to go.  He showed decided disappointment at the prospect of being detained.  I felt a little nettled at his desire to get away and did not detain him.  Sheridan was a first lieutenant in the regiment in which I had served eleven years, the 4th infantry, and stationed on the Pacific coast when the war broke out.  He was promoted to a captaincy in May, 1861, and before the close of the year managed in some way, I do not know how, to get East.  He went to Missouri.  Halleck had known him as a very successful young officer in managing campaigns against the Indians on the Pacific coast, and appointed him acting-quartermaster in south-west Missouri.  There was no difficulty in getting supplies forward while Sheridan served in that capacity; but he got into difficulty with his immediate superiors because of his stringent rules for preventing the use of public transportation for private purposes.  He asked to be relieved from further duty in the capacity in which he was engaged and his request was granted. When General Halleck took the field in April, 1862, Sheridan was assigned to duty on his staff.  During the advance on Corinth a vacancy occurred in the colonelcy of the 2d Michigan cavalry. Governor Blair, of Michigan, telegraphed General Halleck asking him to suggest the name of a professional soldier for the vacancy, saying he would appoint a good man without reference to his State.  Sheridan was named; and was so conspicuously efficient that when Corinth was reached he was assigned to command a cavalry brigade in the Army of the Mississippi.  He was in command at Booneville on the 1st of July with two small regiments, when he was attacked by a force full three times as numerous as his own.  By very skilful manoeuvres and boldness of attack he completely routed the enemy.  For this he was made a brigadier-general and became a conspicuous figure in the army about Corinth.  On this account I was sorry to see him leaving me.  His departure was probably fortunate, for he rendered distinguished services in his new field.  Granger and Sheridan reached Louisville before Buell got there, and on the night of their arrival Sheridan with his command threw up works around the railroad station for the defence of troops as they came from the front.    CHAPTER XXVIII.  ADVANCE OF VAN DORN AND PRICE--PRICE ENTERS IUKA--BATTLE OF IUKA.  At this time, September 4th, I had two divisions of the Army of the Mississippi stationed at Corinth, Rienzi, Jacinto and Danville.  There were at Corinth also Davies' division and two brigades of McArthur's, besides cavalry and artillery.  This force constituted my left wing, of which Rosecrans was in command.  General Ord commanded the centre, from Bethel to Humboldt on the Mobile and Ohio railroad and from Jackson to Bolivar where the Mississippi Central is crossed by the Hatchie River. General Sherman commanded on the right at Memphis with two of his brigades back at Brownsville, at the crossing of the Hatchie River by the Memphis and Ohio railroad.  This made the most convenient arrangement I could devise for concentrating all my spare forces upon any threatened point.  All the troops of the command were within telegraphic communication of each other, except those under Sherman.  By bringing a portion of his command to Brownsville, from which point there was a railroad and telegraph back to Memphis, communication could be had with that part of my command within a few hours by the use of couriers. In case it became necessary to reinforce Corinth, by this arrangement all the troops at Bolivar, except a small guard, could be sent by rail by the way of Jackson in less than twenty-four hours; while the troops from Brownsville could march up to Bolivar to take their place.  On the 7th of September I learned of the advance of Van Dorn and Price, apparently upon Corinth.  One division was brought from Memphis to Bolivar to meet any emergency that might arise from this move of the enemy.  I was much concerned because my first duty, after holding the territory acquired within my command, was to prevent further reinforcing of Bragg in Middle Tennessee.  Already the Army of Northern Virginia had defeated the army under General Pope and was invading Maryland.  In the Centre General Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg marching parallel to him with a large Confederate force for the Ohio River.  I had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell until at this time my entire force numbered less than 50,000 men, of all arms.  This included everything from Cairo south within my jurisdiction.  If I too should be driven back, the Ohio River would become the line dividing the belligerents west of the Alleghanies, while at the East the line was already farther north than when hostilities commenced at the opening of the war.  It is true Nashville was never given up after its first capture, but it would have been isolated and the garrison there would have been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the troops in West Tennessee had been compelled to fall back.  To say at the end of the second year of the war the line dividing the contestants at the East was pushed north of Maryland, a State that had not seceded, and at the West beyond Kentucky, another State which had been always loyal, would have been discouraging indeed.  As it was, many loyal people despaired in the fall of 1862 of ever saving the Union.  The administration at Washington was much concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear. But I believe there was never a day when the President did not think that, in some way or other, a cause so just as ours would come out triumphant.  Up to the 11th of September Rosecrans still had troops on the railroad east of Corinth, but they had all been ordered in.  By the 12th all were in except a small force under Colonel Murphy of the 8th Wisconsin.  He had been detained to guard the remainder of the stores which had not yet been brought in to Corinth.  On the 13th of September General Sterling Price entered Iuka, a town about twenty miles east of Corinth on the Memphis and Charleston railroad.  Colonel Murphy with a few men was guarding the place.  He made no resistance, but evacuated the town on the approach of the enemy. I was apprehensive lest the object of the rebels might be to get troops into Tennessee to reinforce Bragg, as it was afterwards ascertained to be.  The authorities at Washington, including the general-in-chief of the army, were very anxious, as I have said, about"]]]
