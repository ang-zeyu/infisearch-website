H. ROBERTS  Of the First Council of the Seventy  \"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\"--Jesus.  Salt Lake City  1911    Introduction  POINTS OF DIFFERENCE.  The Seventy's Year Book No. IV, differs from the other numbers in two particulars:  First, in that there are no special lessons suggested as in the three previous numbers; nor are there any suggestions as to the manner of treating a subject. In the three preceding numbers of the Year Book suggestions on \"discourse building\" were made; for gathering the materials, arranging a plan, beginning the discourse, conducting it, and completing it, (see Year Book No. III Lesson XXXI), together with such side suggestions on \"clearness\" and \"strength\"--the two great essentials in the expression of thought--as were considered necessary. It is now concluded that the manner of thought expression, so far as our Year Books for the present are concerned, might be allowed to rest there; leaving it to the student to refer to those suggestions--to which the class teachers at need should direct his attention--and to the consultation of such special works as treat exclusively upon the manner of expression to be found in the current _text books_ on composition and rhetoric, used in our high schools, and academies. I would also suggest in this line Pittenger's little work on \"Extempore Speech, How to acquire and practice it;\" and also the admirable work of Professor Nelson of the Brigham Young University, Provo, on \"Preaching and Public Speaking,\" a new and revised edition of which has been recently issued by the Deseret News Publishing Company.  Second. Instead of giving an Analysis of each lesson followed by unconnected _Notes_ bearing upon the subjects compiled from a wide range of authorities--a method largely followed in the Year Book No. III--the author has written a connected treatise upon the Atonement, and for that reason has substituted the word _\"Discussion\"_ for the word _\"Notes\"_ as being more appropriate to the method of treatment. Other than this the general plan of the work is the same as that followed in the previous Year Books.  A PRELIMINARY READING SUGGESTED.  It is suggested to all the classes that the first step in dealing with the present Year Book, should be to require every member to read the entire treatise through. This should be done rapidly, not with the thought that such reading will yield a complete and thorough understanding of, or mastery of the subject, but just to get acquainted somewhat with the spirit of the treatise, the scope of the inquiry, the largeness of it, the majesty and glory of the subject. All which will enable the student to be somewhat conscious, as he seeks to master the separate lessons, of the conclusions to which he is being led. Without such preliminary reading, except where students already have clear views of the Atonement, each lesson will be something of a groping forward without always appreciating to what culmination the movement of the respective lessons is tending.  The preliminary reading need not occupy more than one week. No more time than that should be allowed for it. It is supposed that this Year Book will be completed by the first of January, 1912.  THE THEME OF YEAR BOOK IV.  The doctrine of the Atonement through the expiatory suffering and death of Christ, can only be rightly understood when considered in its relationship to the Intelligences--i. e., men--that are affected by it. Hence this treatise opens with a consideration of Intelligences as related to the Atonement. Necessarily this will involve the restatement of some of the matter of the Seventy's Year Book No. II, dealing with the \"Outline History of the Dispensations of the Gospel, Part I--, \"Prelude to the Dispensations\" where such subjects as \"Intelligences and Spirits,\" \"The Relationship of the Intelligences;\" \"The Purposes of God in Relation to Man;\" \"The Free Agency of Intelligences,\" and the like are discussed. But as the present use of the principles there set forth will be different from the former use of them, the repetition necessary to a clear understanding of the great theme to be developed may not be amiss, but, on the contrary, positively helpful to a fuller appreciation of the principles them selves, as well as a right appreciation of the bearing they have upon the subject of the Atonement.  The writer has approached his theme from a new standpoint. Instead of beginning with the work of the Christ when he appeared on earth as the son of Mary, he has begun with those eternal Intelligences that were to be affected by this earth-life, by the \"fall\" and the \"Atonement,\" and by \"Hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.\" (Paul to Titus.) This is followed by consideration of the council in heaven, wherein the order of earth-life for the spirits of men is considered, what shall accrue to them from it; necessarily the fall and plan of man's redemption; the war in heaven, the advent of man on earth; the fall; revelation of the plan for man's salvation; the Atonement in ancient times, through all the ages in fact, and so finally to the consideration of the various elements that enter into the great theme, making up the philosophy of the Atonement.  As to the importance of the subject, need anything be said? It is the very heart of the Gospel from whose pulsations the streams of both spiritual and eternal physical life proceed. It is the fact which gives vitality to all things else in the Gospel. If the Atonement be not a reality then our preaching is vain; our baptisms and confirmations meaningless; the eucharist a mere mummery of words; our hope of eternal life without foundation; we are still in our sins, and we Christian men, of all men, are the most miserable. A theme that affects all this cannot fail of being important. And yet, how our writers upon theology have neglected this subject! Save for the treatise of the late President John Taylor on the \"Mediation and Atonement of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,\" we have no work devoted wholly to the subject. President Taylor's treatise was published twenty-nine years ago (1882); there was but a very limited edition published at the time, and that is not yet sold out! Aside from this treatise--and even that is quite limited in its scope, chiefly a compilation of scripture texts upon the fact of the Atonement--our speakers and writers have treated the theme merely incidentally. It is time, then, that our Seventies--the special witnesses for the Lord Jesus Christ, including as a central fact of their testimony the Atonement, should give special and extended study to this theme of themes.  DIFFICULTY OF THE SUBJECT.  Is the subject difficult? Certainly. But \"To Become a Seventy, Means Mental Activity, Intellectual Development, and the Attainment of Spiritual Power.\" Such men will not be daunted because the subject is difficult, but rather will rejoice at it, even as a strong man rejoices to run a race, or fight a battle, or undertake hard tasks wherein lies adventure and danger and great glory. Such men will remember that as all great things are attended with risk, so the hard is the good; and \"truth's a gem that loves the deep.\" Go and search for it.  THE APPENDIX.  In an appendix there will be found a statement of \"Other Views of the Atonement\" than those set forth in the body of the treatise. These are the views of the Roman Catholic church, the great Protestant divisions of modern Christendom, and of so-called liberal Christendom, the latter comprised of those who accept--speaking broadly--the theory of evolution and higher criticism.  No lessons have been formulated in this division of the work, but the class teachers can readily make lesson formula from the divisions and subdivisions of the matter there presented if they so elect; if not then it may be left for the student's private perusal; or out of the matter may be formulated special lectures, and much advantage gained by putting the views there expounded in comparison and contrast with the doctrines of the regular text of the Year Book.  BOOKS OF REFERENCE.  It is difficult to name books of reference for this subject; such as are available are named repeatedly in the table references given with each lesson, and in the body of the work. Attention should be called to the necessity of each Seventy possessing what in previous Year Books has been called the \"Seventy's Indispensable Library.\" This library is made up of the standard books of the Church on Doctrine, viz.:  _The Bible,_  _The Book of Mormon,_  _The Doctrine and Covenants,_  _The Pearl of Great Price,_ containing _the Book of Moses, the Book of Abraham,_ and some of the _Writings of Joseph Smith._  The above books are certainly indispensable to every Seventy, and should be owned by every member of our quorums. The First Council, in their recommendations, added to the above list, _\"Richards and Little's Compendium of the Doctrines of the Gospel,\"_ and called the set the \"Seventy's Indispensable Library.\" Arrangements were made by the First Council to hav these books in suitable sizes and uniform bindings, and obtainable in sets at special prices, and they are still to be had in this form. It is also suggested that to these books be added a good standard dictionary, say either the _Students' Standard Dictionary_, Funk and Wagnall's; price, $2.50, cloth; or _Webster's College Dictionary_; price, $3.00. These books are recommended in cases where the unabridged dictionaries of these publishers are considered too expensive; when the unabridged editions can be afforded, they are all the more desirable.  The four books of Scripture referred to above are very"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60491"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Fourth Year (#1)"],["body","quoted in the text of this treatise, and are the main authorities used. Besides these it is recommended that the student obtains  _\"Mediation and Atonement of Our Lord Jesus Christ,\"_ by John Taylor;  _\"The Articles of Faith,\"_ Talmage.  _Orson Pratt's Works, Remarkable Visions and the Kingdom of God._ (These works are cited for the benefit of those who have them. We regret to say that the Works of this great apostle have been allowed to go out of print.)  _\"The Gospel,\"_ Roberts.  The _Improvement Era_ of January, 1909, Vol. XII, containing the \"King Follett Sermon,\" with explanatory notes by this writer; also the _Improvement Era_ for April, 1907, for Article on Immortality. Same author.  The Seventies should also remember that the _Improvement Era_ is the organ of the Priesthood quorums, and that from time to time supplemental articles will appear bearing upon our current work, and for this reason Seventies should subscribe, if it is possible, for this magazine in order to keep in touch with our work.  THE SEVENTY'S YEAR BOOK.  The importance of Seventies having a complete set of the Seventy's Year Books cannot be over-emphasized. There is constant reference made in the present Number to previous Numbers; and the student who is not in possession of those books is by so much deprived of the opportunity to complete his inquiry on the division of the subject he may have in hand. As there are now four of the Year Books issued, they could be bound together; or in more convenient form, two numbers can be bound together at a cost of seventy-five cents, postage prepaid, and those desirous of preserving the set would do well to order them in that form.  SCRIPTURE READING EXERCISE.  This exercise is continued in the present Year Book as being too valuable to be omitted from our lessons; and by this time it is our presumption that had it been omitted, instead of continued as a suggestion at the head of each lesson, our class teachers and the members of the classes themselves, would have continued the practice that has now been an interesting feature of the Seventy's lessons through three successful years. The purpose for which this feature of our class exercise was introduced, and the manner of conducting it, the new teachers and students will find explanations of in the Introduction of Year Book No. I, to which attention is hereby directed.  To the Seventies we now commend the great theme of this present Year Book, with the prayer that they may be impressed with its beauty, its effectiveness, and its glory.

It is a spirit[D] from age to age and there is no creation about it.\" (Joseph Smith, \"King Follett Sermon,\" April, 1844.)_  [Footnote A: This little work (206 pages) is by William Pollard, some years Professor of Rational Philosophy in St. Louis University. It is a short treatise on the \"Initial Philosophy,\" the ground work necessary for the consistent pursuit of knowledge, (1896).]  [Footnote B: I cite the abridged (teachers') edition of the Professor's, \"Principles of Psychology.\"]  [Footnote C: This sermon as published in the \"Era\" is accompanied by explanatory notes, hence the \"Era\" is cited. It is also published in \"Journal of Discourses,\" Vol. VI.]  [Footnote D: \"A spirit from age to age\"--not \"Spirit from age to age:\" but a \"spirit\"; that is an entity, a person, an individual. The Prophet's statement here could well be taken as an interpretation of Doc. & Cov. Sec. 93:29. See Lesson II.]  DISCUSSION.  _1. Intelligence Defined:_ The sense in which the term \"Intelligence\" is to be used in this discussion is that of a mind, or an intelligent being, Milton make's such use of the term as the latter when he represents Adam as saying to the angel Raphael, who has given him a lesson on human limitations:    \"How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure   Intelligence of heaven, angel serene!\"[A]  [Footnote A: \"Paradise Lost,\" viii:181.]  And so Alfred Tennyson:    \"The great _Intelligences_ fair   That range above our mortal state.\"[A]  [Footnote A: \"In Memoriam,\" lxxxv.]  God is also sometimes referred to as the \"Supreme Intelligence.\" It is in this sense, then, that I use the term Intelligence; a being that is intelligent, capable of apprehending facts or ideas; possessed of power to think.  _2. Intelligence: Consciousness:_ In other words the term Intelligence is descriptive of the thing to which it is applied. Therefore Intelligence (mind) or Intelligences (minds), thus conceived are conscious. Conscious of _self_ and of _not self_; of the _me_ and the _not me_. \"Intelligence is that which sees itself, or is at once both subject and object.\" It knows itself as thinking, that is, as a subject; thinking of its self, it knows itself as an object of thought--of its own thought. And it knows itself as distinct from a vast universe of things which are not self; itself the while remaining constant as a distinct individuality amid the great universe of things _not self_. Fiske calls Consciousness \"the soul's fundamental fact;\" and \"the most fundamental of facts.\"[A] It may be defined as the power by which Intelligence knows its own acts and states. It is an awareness of the mind. By reason of it an Intelligence, when dwelling in a body--as we best know it (man)--knows itself as seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching; also as searching, and finding; as inquiring and answering; as active or at rest; as loving or hating; as contented or restless; as advancing or receding; as gaining or loosing, and so following in all the activities in which Intelligences, as men, engage.  [Footnote A: \"Studies in Religion,\" p. 245.]  _3. Generalization:_ By another power or faculty of Intelligence (mind) it can perceive, as connected with the things that sense perceives, something that cannot be taken in by sense perception; that is to say, Intelligence can generalize. Sense can get at the individual, concrete thing only: \"this triangle,\" \"this orange\" \"that triangle,\" \"those oranges,\" etc. By the consideration of the individual, concrete object, however, the mind can form an idea, a concept, a general notion--\"triangle,\" \"orange\"--which does not specify this or that individual object, but \"fits to any individual triangle or orange past, present, or future, and even the possible oranges that never shall be grown.\"[A] In other words Intelligence can rise from consideration of the particular to the general.  [Footnote A: \"The Truth of Thought,\" p. 41.]  _4. Perception of a priori[A] Principles:_ Again there are a priori principles, which the mind can perceive to be incontrovertible and of universal application, by mere reflection upon the signification of the principles and without going into the applications.[B] Such for example as that one and one make two. That two and one make three. Also, to continue the illustration above, borrowed from the late Professor Wm. James, for some time Professor of Psychology in Harvard University.--\"White differs less from gray than it does from black; that when the cause begins to act the effect also commences. Such propositions hold of all possible 'ones,' of all conceivable 'whites' and 'grays' and 'causes.' The objects here are mental objects. Their relations are perceptually obvious at a glance, and no sense-verification is necessary. Moreover, once true, always true, of those same mental objects. Truth here has an 'eternal' character. If you can find a concrete thing anywhere that is 'one' or 'white' or 'gray' or an 'effect' then your principles will everlastingly apply to it. It is but a case of ascertaining the kind, and then applying the law of its kind to the particular object. You are sure to get truth if you can name the kind rightly, for your mental relations hold good of everything of that kind without exception.\"[C]  [Footnote A: A priori, from something prior or going before, hence from antecedent to consequent; from cause to effect. See illustrations in the text quoted from James.]  [Footnote B: \"Truth of Thought,\" p. 41.]  [Footnote C: \"Pragmatism\"--James--(1908), pp. 209, 210.]  _5. Imagination:_ By a mind-power known as imagination, or imaginative memory, Intelligences, as known to us through men, can hold before consciousness, in picture, what has been perceived by an outward sense, and this even when the outward sense has been shut off from the outward world of matter. I once saw an orange tree with a number of ripe oranges scattered through its branches, but on other branches were orange blossoms. What the outward senses then perceived, when I was standing before the tree, has been shut off, but at will I can call before the vision of my mind and hold in consciousness the picture of that tree with its mixture of ripe fruit and fruit blossoms. This power of imagination, is also constructive. Intelligences (men) can put before themselves in mental picture, combinations which are fashioned from the varied stores of memory.[A] As I have elsewhere said: I am this moment sitting at my desk, and am enclosed by the four walls of my room--limited as to my personal presence to this spot. But by the mere act of my will, I find I have the"]]]
