Would her officers see him?  That was the question that agitated his mind as he waved frantically while she drew nearer and he saw that she was one of the crack liners of the Central American Trading Company. As she raced through the water a great \"Bone\" of white spray was sent out from each side of her keen cutwater. A volume of thick black smoke rolled from her yellow funnels. She would have made a fine sight to any one less in fear of his life than Bluewater Bill.  Till she was within half-a-mile of him it seemed the big craft was going to pass him by, but suddenly, to his joy, Bill saw her change her course and bear down for him. As she drew nearer, rolling mightily in the high sea, a man on the bridge hailed him in stentorian tones through a megaphone.  \"Ahoy! what lunatic are you?\"  \"Bluewater Bill of the Eleanor Jones of Bath,--castaway,\" yelled back the drifter in the launch, who had by this time shut off his engine.  \"We'll stand by and lower a boat,\" was the next hail and soon Bill was on his way aboard the Yucatan--for that was the vessel's name--and the tiny launch, which had been the means of saving his life and almost of his losing it, was tossing far astern.  But Bill, perilous as his position was until he was actually in the Yucatan's lifeboat, had not lost his presence of mind. He realized in a flash that a castway with a pocket full of gold would be an object of suspicion and he had his own reasons for not wanting to tell how he had obtained it, so, before the ship's boat reached the launch the old mariner emptied his pockets of their golden freight and sent the coins tumbling into the sea. He retained only the one piece that he had loaned to Billy Barnes as an evidence of his good faith.  \"And now, boys,\" concluded the old mariner, \"what do you think of my story?\"  \"Why, it's the most marvelous thing I ever heard of!\" exclaimed Frank.  \"But do you think it is TRUE? You believe me?\"  \"We certainly do,\" chorused both the boys, much impressed by the old salt's narration.  \"Well, the only problem is to get to the galleon,\" resumed Bill.  \"That would be easy in the Golden Eagle,\" was Frank's quiet rejoinder. \"She could be fitted with aluminum pontoons, and, with a propeller device installed, we could start her upward from the water as easily as from the land.\"  \"By the Lord High Admiral's slippers!--do you think you could, lads?\" exclaimed the old mariner in great excitement.  \"I am certain of it,\" was the quiet rejoinder.  \"Boys, there's enough gold there to make us all millionaires.\"  \"Hardly enough for that, I should think,\" smiled Frank, \"but at least it is worth trying for. What do you say, boys, shall we make a dash for the golden galleon?\"  \"Will we? Why, Frank, if you'll lead the way we'll follow all right,\" cried Billy, wild with excitement at the notion.  Hastily the eager group sketched out the rough details of the expedition and it was agreed that the boys should start on their treasure quest immediately after the cup race--provided they could obtain their father's permission.  \"Hurray for the treasure of the Sargasso!\" shouted Billy, throwing up his hat and catching it again and almost upsetting the lamp in his enthusiasm.  But his excitement received a sudden check.  A man was racing by the house on a galloping horse and as he tore along he shouted the alarming cry of:  \"Fire! fire! fire!\"     CHAPTER VII.  A FIRE ALARM BY AEROPLANE.   They all raced out of the house and soon saw that the fire was some distance off. The glare of the flames spread redly on the sky and illuminated the low hanging clouds till they glowed like red-hot coals. It was evidently a fierce blaze.  \"It's Farmer Goggins's place!\" announced Bluewater Bill as he noted the direction of the glow.  \"That's just beyond the aviation grounds,\" cried Harry. \"I know, because old Schmidt fell into a field, with a bull in it there, one afternoon and his Green Grasshopper was nearly broken up.\"  \"Come on, boys; I'll get out my little mare and we'll drive over there,\" shouted Bill.  In a few minutes the horse was hitched to Bill's old carryall and, the boys piling in, they drove rapidly off. As they passed through the gate in Bill's neat fence, the carriage lamp they carried suddenly flashed on a dark figure that the next minute was obliterated in the darkness.  \"Hello, somebody skulking around here,\" shouted Bill, drawing up his horse almost on her haunches.  \"Hey there, come out and show yourself!\"  There was no answer.  \"I'll make it hot for you, my hearty, if I find you,\" shouted Bill. He leaped out of the rig and after entering the house returned with a revolver.  \"Go on, boys, you drive to the fire and then send the buggy back by a boy. I'm going to find who that fellow was.\"  \"Somehow, even in the second I saw him, he seemed a familiar figure to me,\" exclaimed Harry.  \"Who could it have been?\" wondered Frank.  \"Oh, some no-good hobo,\" replied Bill. \"If I catch him, I'll teach him to come snooping around folks' houses this Way.\"  \"I hope he didn't overhear our conversation about the galleon,\" suddenly exclaimed Frank, who had been struck by a sudden apprehension that perhaps this was no ordinary loafer or burglar, but some man who had got wind of Bill's discovery and meant to turn his find to advantage.  \"By jumping rat-tailed land-sharks, I never thought of that,\" exclaimed Bill. \"Why, any one that knew our secret could sell it for a large sum.\"  \"That's so,\" agreed the boys; \"but perhaps it was only a tramp and we are scaring ourselves unnecessarily.\"  \"I hope so, I'm sure,\" rejoined the old sailor, \"but now, boys, you drive on. You may manage to be of help at the fire.\"  \"Won't you come, Bill?\" asked Frank.  \"No, thank you, lad, I'll stay here and guard my shanty. That feller may hev been after some of my dried shark or stuffed land-crabs. I wouldn't put it by him to steal that picture of the schooner, Boston Girl, in a heavy blow off Hatteras. That's a real work of art, boys.\"  As the boys drove off they heard the old man grunting and grumbling and poking about among the bushes in search for the intruder.  \"I don't envy that fellow whoever he is, if Bill catches him,\" remarked Frank, as he urged the old sailor's little horse along.  \"Nor I,\" laughed Billy; \"but depend upon it he is a long way off by this time.\"  As they drew near the aviation grounds, the boys saw that the fire was indeed a serious one.  Everything in the vicinity was lit up as bright as day by the glow, and they passed scores of men, women and children from the village, all hastening along the road to the scene of the conflagration.  Farmer Goggins's place was a large one, and as they reached the orchard which surrounded the house the boys saw that a big barn at the rear of the dwelling-house was in flames and that two smaller structures had already gone. Men and boys were leading out horses and driving cows from adjoining sheds.  \"The whole place is going!\" the boys heard a man say as they drove up.  And indeed it looked so.  The flames, fanned by a brisk breeze, were roaring through the ancient timbers, devouring them eagerly. Farmer Goggins and his family, wringing their hands despairingly, gazed at the scene.  \"Where is the fire brigade?\" shouted some one.  \"They started out but they've broken down on the road,\" came back the reply. \"They won't get here before the entire farm is destroyed.\"  \"What's that?\" cried Farmer Goggins, near whom the speaker had been standing. \"The fire department's broken down. Then I am a ruined man. The barns that are burned I used for hay and though my loss is heavy I can stand it, but if the fire spreads it will burn down my dairy plant and destroy my home.\"  \"Is there no other fire department near?\" asked Frank.  \"No, none nearer than Westbury,\" was the reply.  \"Why don't you telephone for them?\"  \"We have tried to but, as luck would have it, there is something the matter with the wire and we cannot raise the Westbury exchange at all.\"  \"If only the Westbury department could be notified they might still get here in time to save the house,\" cried another onlooker, \"they've got an automobile fire-engine that just eats up the road.\"  \"That's so, but how are you going to get them. It's fifteen miles away and a horse couldn't do it in less than an hour and a quarter.\"  \"How about an auto?\"  \"Even if they was one handy, the roads are too bad, except for a high-powered car.\"  \"I have it,\" shouted Frank suddenly. \"I'll get the engines and try to hurry them here in time to save the house at least.\"  \"How's that, young feller?\" asked Farmer Goggins, who had stepped up. \"Say that again.\"  \"I said I'll get the engines for you and in jig time too,\" cried the boy.  \"Don't see how.\"  \"Well I do; watch me.\"  Leaving the horse in charge of a lad and calling on the others to \"come on,\" Frank, with his brother and Billy, raced toward the Golden Eagle's shed.  Most of the crowd followed them.  \"He's one of them flying kids,\" shouted a man.  \"He's never goin' ter fly ter Westbury ter-night. It's as black as yer hat.\"  \"Looks like he's going ter try,\" was the answer as the boys trundled the Golden Eagle out of her stable.  And this was indeed the lad's intention.  It was the work of a minute to test the gasolene tank and rapidly see that the engine was in running order.  \"How can we tell when we strike Westbury?\" asked Frank, as he and his brother clambered into the machine. Billy Barnes, it had been settled, was to wait at the aerodrome in order to save weight.  \"Why, there's two red lights at the railroad crossing there and the village is just beyond,\" cried Farmer Goggins; \"but, boys, don't risk your necks on my account.\"  \"Oh, we are not risking our necks,\" laughed Frank reassuringly; \"but, tell me, is there a good meadow or a bit of flat land there to light on?\"  \"The whole ground just beyond the red lights at the crossing is as flat as the back of your hand and unfenced,\" was the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6149"],["title","The Boy Aviators' Treasure Quest; Or, The Golden Galleon (#8)"],["body","reply, \"it is used for a circus and show ground. It will make a good place for you to light.\"  \"All right,\" cried Frank, \"that's all I wanted to know. Now then, Harry, are you ready?\"  \"All right here,\" answered the boy.  \"Then let her go.\"  The propeller roared and as the craft sped forward, with a warning shout from Frank that scattered the crowd like chaff, the lad threw on the searchlight which had been rapidly adjusted as the plane was wheeled out.  A dazzling shaft of white light cut the darkness ahead of the Golden Eagle, as on her wings, tinted crimson by the glare of the fire, she rose into the night.  Frank headed her for the direction in which he knew Westbury lay, and gradually increased the speed till the craft, her great single eye shining like some strange star, was skimming above the sleeping countryside.  Far behind them, the cheer that had greeted the boys' rising died out and the glow, too, faded as they dashed along.  It seemed almost no time at all before beneath them they heard the roar of a train, and as it dashed by far below the two red lights of the crossing were sighted.  \"Now for taking a chance,\" laughed Frank, as he set the descending blades and the Golden Eagle glided downward. It was \"taking a chance,\" indeed, and the slightest mishap might have resulted in a catastrophe.  However, Farmer Goggins's directions turned out to be quite correct and the aeroplane landed perfectly in a big field, as smooth as a board, only a few minutes after she had left the scene of the fire.  As she struck the ground there was a wild yell from down by the railroad tracks and the boys saw the old switchman on watch there dart out of his tiny hut and dash down the road shrieking:  \"Robbers! Murder! Ghosts!\" at the top of his voice.  \"Hi, there! come back,\" shouted Frank, \"we won't hurt you.\"  At the sound of a human voice the old man checked his mad career and tremblingly approached.  \"Gee! you 'most scared me to death,\" he said, as the boys stepped forward into the glare cast by the searchlight and stood revealed as two human boys and no spirits of the air, such as the old man had imagined they were, when they first alighted.  \"Say, who are ye, anyway, and what are ye doing round here in that sky-buggy?\"  \"We have come to summon help from the Westbury fire department,\" said Frank, \"can you direct us to the headquarters?\"  \"Sure, right up the street about six blocks.\"  \"Good. Is there any one on watch?\"  \"Sure, some of the boys sleep there every night.\"  \"Is it a good engine?\"  \"None better. She's an automobile engine. Goes sky-hooting 'long like a joy-rider. Just got her two weeks ago. Cost ten thousand dollars.\"  Leaving the garrulous old man to examine the Golden Eagle with timorous interest, the two boys ran at top speed down the street till they reached a building surmounted by a high tower and with a small red light burning over the door.  Frank seized the rope that dangled at one side of the portal and, rightly surmising that it was placed there to summon the firemen on duty, gave it a tug. The clamor that followed was startling. The rope was connected with a big bell in the tower, and as its clamor rang out several heads were poked out of an upper window.  \"What's the matter?\" cried a voice.  \"Big fire--Goggins's farm--Mineola fire department bust up--hurry,\" cried Frank all in a breath.  \"All right, we'll be on the job in ten minutes,\" cried the voice, and in a short time the big doors of the fire-house were flung open and lights switched on.  The Westbury fire-engine was the cause of just pride to its operators. It was a new type auto-engine and capable of making a speed of fifty miles an hour. While several men and boys, aroused by the clamor of the big bell, summoned the men who were sleeping away from the fire-house, the others got the engine going. Soon puffing and chugging like some fiery-eyed monster, the racing fire-fighter was ready to start.  \"You know the road?\" asked Frank.  \"As well as I do my own face,\" was the merry reply of the chief.  \"Suppose you fellers will follow in your buggy,\" yelled the chief as the auto-engine started on its dash.  \"We didn't come in a buggy,\" shouted back Frank.  \"Auto then?\"  \"No.\"  \"S'pose you flew,\" sarcastically cried the man on the engine.  \"That's what.\"  \"Gee-whiz,\" was all that was audible of the amazed fireman's reply as the big engine whizzed off.  Frank's assertion called for some explanation to the crowd of bystanders, and after he had given an account of their trip most of the crowd that had got out of bed at the summons of the fire-bell accompanied them to the meadow where the old watchman was still eyeing the Golden Eagle with suspicion. So closely did the curious crowd press about that it was some time before the boys were once more aboard their craft and in the air.  Fifteen minutes later they were receiving the congratulations and thanks of the crowd and Farmer Goggins, for, thanks to the timely summons of the air-ship, the auto fire-engine had made the run in time to save the most valuable of the buildings.     CHAPTER VIII.  NEARLY OUT OF THE RACE.   The day of the big race in which the various air-craft had been entered dawned fair and cloudless. There was not a breath of wind and the conditions seemed propitious for making ideal flights.  The big crowds that early thronged the grounds thought so too. They strolled about, poking their heads into various sheds and making conditions almost unbearable for the various flying-men who were busily preparing their machines within.  A band had been engaged and was blaring away at popular tunes. All the aerodromes were draped with flags, and bunting of all kinds made the grounds gay indeed.  But the gayety did not extend inside the boys' aerodrome where, in fact, dismay reigned.  To explain its cause we must go back a little and recount some happenings of the preceding night.  While the boys and Le Blanc had been sound asleep, the figure of Sanborn had upraised itself from his cot and quietly sneaked over to the aeroplane. Softly he worked with a wrench and screw-driver for some time, and then with an exclamation of:  \"That will fix you,\" he had softly tiptoed out of the tent carrying the detached main guiding lever of the ship. He rapidly traversed the deserted aviation grounds and flung the important part of the air-craft's mechanism into a clump of bushes. Thus did Sanborn carry out his promise to Malvoise and Luther Barr to cripple the Golden Eagle.  \"There, that's done,\" he said, with an evil sneer, \"and now I'll make myself scarce. I came too near to being caught by that whiskered old Apache, Bluewater Bill, the other night, to make it healthy for me round here when it is discovered that the lever is gone. However, I managed to overhear all the details of the treasure galleon and if old man Barr doesn't make the knowledge worth my while he's not so greedy after gold as I thought he was.\"  Thus musing, Sanford walked rapidly off in the direction of the village.  When the boys awoke on the eventful day, naturally their first thoughts were of the machine in which they hoped so ardently to win the aviation trophy. Their dismay may be better imagined than put into words when they discovered their loss.  \"It puts us out of the race,\" was Harry's despairing cry.  \"We can never replace it by two o'clock, the time set for the start,\" was Frank's despairing exclamation.  Suddenly they realized that Sanborn also was missing. Like a flash Frank realized that it must have been their mechanic who had done the damage. It would have been impossible for any one to enter the shed from the outside without leaving traces, as the lock was on the interior of the door.  Le Blanc raged round the shed like a wild man. It would have fared ill with Sanborn had he fallen into the hands of the Frenchman just then. Le Blanc regarded the Golden Eagle like his own child and his rage would have been comic from the antics it made him perform if the situation had not been so serious.  What was to be done?  Frank tried device after device in his anxiety to provide a substitute lever, but they all proved too frail. It was impossible to get a duplicate at such short notice, as the levers were especially made for the Golden Eagle.  \"Well, boys, it looks as if we will have to disqualify,\" finally pronounced Frank, after his fifth endeavor at a substitute lever had broken off short when a strain was placed on it.  \"I wish I could get hold of that fellow for just five minutes,\" groaned Harry.  \"I was foolish not to discharge him when I made up my mind to do so,\" rejoined Frank. \"I felt all along that the fellow was a scoundrel.\"  Bluewater Bill had entered the shed while the boys were discussing the situation and Le Blanc was tearing his hair. He was soon made acquainted with what had happened.  \"Say,\" he said finally after due consideration, \"that was a pretty heavy lever, wasn't it, boys?\"  \"Yes,\" was the reply.  \"Then he didn't carry it very fur. This fellow Sandboy, I mean.\"  \"I don't suppose so,\" rejoined Frank.  \"In that case he must have hidden it somewhere.\"  \"That's true, but that doesn't put us any nearer to finding it.\"  \"Have you tried?\"  \"No.\"  \"Well, then, here's what you do. Announce your loss on the grounds by posting a notice and offering a reward. Maybe someone will show up who has found it.\"  \"That's a pretty slim chance,\" despairingly said Frank.  \"Worth trying. I had a pretty slim chance when I was in that launch. It's slim chances that win out lots of times.\"  \"Well, perhaps, as you say, it is worth trying. Anyhow I'll write out a notice and post it on the outside of the shed.\"  Frank rapidly wrote out a description of the missing aeroplane lever and soon it was tacked up on the door of the shed. An eager crowd surrounded it at once and soon a score of men and boys were searching over the grounds in the hope of being able to claim the reward.  As the time wore on and there seemed to be no"]]]
