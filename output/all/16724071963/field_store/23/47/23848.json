I shall introduce you to my friends as a Dutch war correspondent who, nevertheless, has in him a strain of German, with a little American blood. I shall represent that you have lived several years in America, but that your heart is with the Fatherland.\"  \"And my friends?\" questioned Hal.  \"They shall be just what they represent themselves to be.\"  \"Very well,\" said Hal. \"You perhaps know best.  But I must, as soon as possible, be introduced either to the prime minister or to one of his trusted assistants.\"  \"I will tell you something,\" said his hostess.  \"The list which you seek is no longer in the hands of the prime minister.  It is now in possession of General Rentzel, chief of the secret service; and the son of the general comes frequently to see my daughter, Gladys.  But we shall talk more later.  I will leave you now and see that sufficient wardrobes are procured for you and your friends.\"  She left the room.      CHAPTER VI  THE BOYS MAKE PROGRESS  It was a merry party that gathered around the dinner table in the home of the German undersecretary of foreign affairs two nights later. But beneath the smiling faces of five members of the party was a suppressed excitement, for this dinner had been given by Mrs. Schweiring for a purpose.  The purpose was to introduce Hal, Chester and McKenzie to General Rentzel, chief of the secret service, and his son, Frederick.  Besides these two guests of honor there were present the German minister of foreign affairs and one or two other high diplomats.  The boys were in distinguished company and they knew it.  True to her word, Mrs. Schweiring had provided the three friends with an abundant wardrobe, which included evening clothes.  Dinner over, Mrs.  Schweiring, her daughter Gladys, and the wife of General Rentzel, the only women present, retired while the men produced cigars and cigarettes.  Neither Hal nor Chester smoked, but they felt called upon to accept a cigarette each.  McKenzie, however, had no such scruples, and accepted a fat cigar without hesitation.  Hal found himself in conversation with young Captain Rentzel, son of the chief of the secret service.  \"I understand you have spent some years in America?\" he questioned.  \"Why, yes,\" returned Hal.  \"Do you like the country?\"  \"Not overly much,\" replied Hal with a shrug.  \"There are some very nice people there, but they are mostly boors.\"  \"My idea exactly,\" returned the young German officer, \"although I have never been there.  Do you think America can do much harm to Germany in this war?\"  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"given time, yes; but the American people are notoriously slow in such matters.  Besides, I understand that there are quite a few German agents at work there now.  With enough of them, irreparable injury could be done to the foe before they could prevent it.\"  \"I notice you say foe,\" said the young German; \"Yet you have American blood in your veins.\"  \"A trifle,\" returned Hal quietly; \"not enough to make me lose sight of justice and right.\"  \"Good!\" cried the young German.  \"Listen.  It's true that we have many agents abroad, but some of them have fallen under suspicion and consequently will be of no further value.  We need more such men who have lived in America and know the customs, and also will not be suspected.  By the way, have you an appointment for 10 o'clock?\"  \"Why, no,\" said Hal. \"Why?\"  \"Will you go with me at that hour?\"  \"Where to?\"  \"To my father's quarters.  He, as you know, is the chief of the secret service.  As such, he has charge of the agents abroad.  I thought he might make you a proposition.\"  \"There will be no harm if I am unable to accept, will there?\" asked Hal.  \"Not a bit,\" replied the German heartily.  \"Then I'll go.\"  The next hour was spent in general conversation, after which Captain Rentzel arose to take his leave.  \"I'm going to run off with one of your friends, Miss Schweiring,\" he said, indicating Hal.  The others laughed, \"Oh, take him and show him about a bit, Frederick,\" laughed Mrs. Schweiring's husband.  \"Only be sure that you return him safely.\"  Hal followed the young captain from the house.  Half an hour later he found himself in the palatial office of the chief of the German secret service.  Hal looked carefully about the room.  A long table stood in the center.  This apparently was the personal property of General Rentzel. Great easy chairs were scattered about the room.  There was a window at the south side, and back, in the center, against the wall, was a large safe.  \"Pretty comfortable place,\" said Hal aloud.  \"Rather,\" agreed the young German.  \"Father believes in making himself comfortable.\"  General Rentzel had not arrived yet, but he put in an appearance a few moments later.  He manifested no surprise at sight of his son, but he eyed Hal askance.  \"I thought you young fellows had gone to look about the city,\" he said.  \"No, sir,\" replied his son.  \"I invited. Herr Block here to see you, sir.\"  \"You did?  Why?\"  The son explained as quickly as possible.  \"Hm-m,\" muttered the general when his son had concluded, eying Hal sharply.  \"How do I know you are what you represent yourself to be, sir?\" he demanded.  Hal smiled.  \"I'm not applying for a job, sir,\" he replied.  \"I came here at your son's suggestion.  He said you might have a proposition to make, and if I can be of service without taking too great risk, I am willing, sir.\"  Again the general meditated.  At last he said:  \"It's true that we have need of men for the work my son mentions.  To my mind, your youth would be in favor, rather than against, the success of the undertaking.  Would you be willing to go back to America?\"  \"Well, I don't care particularly about going right now,\" said Hal truthfully.  \"But there is nothing to prevent your going?\"  \"Well, no.  But I would know the nature of my work first.  I would not like to become a spy, sir.  It seems to me that spies are not made of manly caliber, sir.\"  \"You are wrong,\" was the quiet response.  \"Why, I can show you the names of men whom you would not think of suspecting, and yet who are acting for the German government in America.\"  \"Is that so, sir?\"  \"It is indeed.  Wait.\"  General Rentzel arose, approached the big safe in the rear of the room, unlocked it and took there from a small paper-bound book.  He returned to his seat at the table.  \"In this little book,\" he said, tapping the table gently with it, \"are the names of our agents in America.  See, I'll show you a name, of worldwide importance, who is acting for us.\"  General Rentzel exposed a name.  Hal glanced at it and then gave a long whistle.  \"It's no wonder you are surprised,\" said the general, smiling. \"Neither is it any wonder that our agents have been so successful in America, considering names like that.\"  \"I should say not, sir,\" returned Hal grim.  General Rentzel returned the book to his safe, closed the heavy iron door and twirled the knob.  \"What do you say, sir?\" he demanded, as he resumed his seat.  For a moment Hal seemed to hesitate.  Then he said:  \"I accept on one condition, sir.\"  \"And that?\" asked the general.  \"That,\" said Hal, \"is that I may have the week in which to put my affairs in shape.  I shall have to resign my position with my paper and attend to a few other matters, sir.\"  \"Very good, sir.  You need not call here again.  It would be unwise.  I shall see you at the Swiss ambassador's ball, which will be held four nights from tonight.  There I will give you what passports you need and other instructions.  Until then, sir, auf Wiedersehen.\"  Captain Rentzel accompanied Hal from his father's office.  \"You are in luck,\" said that worthy, \"and the pay is big.  In a year or two you will be a wealthy man.\"  Hal thanked the captain, and made his way home alone.  As he moved up the steps he was startled to see a shadowy figure lurking in the doorway.  His hand dropped to his pocket, and he advanced cautiously.  \"Don't be afraid.  Take your hand away from that revolver,\" came the voice of Gladys Schweiring.  \"Miss Gladys!\" exclaimed Hal in surprise.  \"What are you doing here? It is almost midnight.\"  \"I was waiting for you,\" was the low response.  \"I was afraid something might have happened.\"  \"It has,\" replied Hal, \"but it is good news and not bad.  Where is your mother?\"  \"In the drawing-room.\"  \"Are the others there?\"  \"Just your friends.  The guests have gone, and father has retired.\"  \"Good.  I have important information for them,\"  Hal followed the young girl into the drawing room.  Chester rose to his feet.  \"By George!  I'm glad to see you back safely,\" he said.  \"I was afraid something had happened.\"  Others echoed his words.  \"Folks,\" said Hal, \"I've news for you--good news.\"  \"What is it?\" demanded Chester eagerly.  \"Well,\" said Hal very quietly.  \"I've seen the list!\"      CHAPTER VII  THE MINISTER'S BALL  It was a gay assemblage that thronged the home of the Swiss minister four nights after Hal's interview with the chief of the German secret service.  Elegantly dressed women and well groomed and handsome officers danced and sang, and from the general tone of the evening it would have been hard to believe that Germany was engaged in a war that threatened her very existence.  Hal, Chester and McKenzie went to the ball accompanied by Mrs. Schweiring and her daughter.  Mrs. Schweiring's husband announced that he would appear later, as he had matters of importance to transact at his office.  This was the night that Hal had decided upon to make an effort to get the list of names for which the three friends were risking so much.  He had a well-conceived plan in mind.  The details he had worked out in the days following his interview with the German chief of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6083"],["title","The Boy Allies with Haig in Flanders; Or, the Fighting Canadians of Vimy Ridge (#5)"],["body"," service and his preparations had been careful and thorough.  Now he was anxious for action.  General Rentzel reached the ball late in the evening.  He paid his respects to the Swiss minister and to the latter's wife.  A few moments later he encountered Hal, and escorted the lad to a secluded nook, where he presented the lad with several documents.  \"This,\" he said, indicating one, \"is your passport into Switzerland. From there you will travel as a Swiss subject.  You will present that paper,\" and he indicated a second, \"to Herr Baumgartner in Washington. You will find him still at the Austrian embassy.  He will give you other instructions.  Also, you will receive your pay through him, and whatever other money is necessary.\"  Hal bowed.  \"Very well, sir,\" he said.  \"I don't know that there is anything further,\" said General Rentzel, \"except to warn you that treachery means death.\"  \"I am aware of that, sir,\" returned Hal quietly.  \"Very good, then.  Good luck to you.\"  The general moved away.  Hal sought Chester instantly, glancing at his watch as he passed along slowly and without apparent haste.  It was 10:30 o'clock.  \"It's time to get busy, Chester,\" he said quietly.  \"It's half-past ten, and I may require an hour and a half.  You get word to Gladys and her mother to keep General Rentzel here under some pretext until midnight.  I'm off.\"  \"Am I not going with you?\" demanded Chester.  \"No,\" said Hal.  \"I don't have time to wait, and the message must be delivered to Mrs. Schweiring or her daughter at once.  I'll pick McKenzie up on the way.  Good-bye.\"  \"Good luck,\" said Chester simply.  Hal left the room quietly.  In the hall he found McKenzie, whom he motioned to follow him.  McKenzie did so quietly.  Outside Hal found the automobile which had brought them to the ball. He leaped in and McKenzie followed.  Hal gave quick directions to the chauffeur to drive them home.  The latter asked no questions.  At the home of Mrs. Schweiring Hal ordered McKenzie to remain in the car while the lad hurried into the house.  He returned a moment later, carrying a small grip.  This he threw into the car and climbed in after it.  \"We have important business with General Rentzel,\" he told the chauffeur.  \"You will drive us there and then return to the ball for your mistress.\"  The chauffeur asked no questions.  There were so many queer things going on in Berlin that he was not even greatly interested.  General Rentzel's office was in darkness when the car pulled up before it.  Motioning McKenzie to follow him, Hal hastened up the steps.  The chauffeur, in accordance with Hal's instructions, immediately disappeared down the street with the car.  In the darkness of the vestibule, Hal tried the door.  \"Locked,\" he said.  \"Lucky we came prepared.\"  He opened the little grip he carried.  Meanwhile, Chester had carried Hal's message to Gladys.  The latter had repeated it to her mother, and these two now shadowed General Rentzel every place he moved, for they were fearful that he might decide at any moment to leave the house.  Chester kept his eyes on all three.  Chester was plainly nervous.  Had he been in the danger himself his nerves would have been as hard as steel, but the inaction while someone else was doing the work made him impatient and fanciful.  Finally General Rentzel approached the Swiss minister and paid his adieus.  Then he moved toward the cloakroom.  Halfway there he was intercepted by Mrs. Schweiring and Gladys.  \"You are not going so soon, your excellency?\" questioned Mrs. Schweiring.  \"I must,\" was the reply.  \"I have work to do at my office that will keep me until far into the night.\"  \"I'm sorry,\" was the reply.  \"Have you seen my husband?\"  \"Why, no.\"  \"I understood him to say that he had some business with you; perhaps I was mistaken, however.\"  Twice now the general had attempted to move on, but Mrs. Schweiring had prevented it.  He tried again, and she asked:  \"What time have you, your excellency?\"  General Rentzel glanced at his watch.  \"Half-past eleven,\" he said.  \"Surely, it is not that late,\" said Mrs. Schweiring.  \"Why, we have only been here a short time.\"  \"Madame,\" said General Rentzel at this juncture, \"I must ask you to excuse me.  I must be going.\"  There was no reply the other could make to this without laying herself open to suspicion.  She stepped back, and the German secret service chief passed on.  Behind him the woman and her daughter wrung their hands.  They had been unsuccessful.  In their minds they could see General Rentzel bursting in upon Hal and McKenzie in the middle of their work.  \"What are we going to do?\" cried the mother.  \"They must be warned!' cried the daughter.  \"But how?\"  \"I will warn them myself.  It is a long ways to the general's quarters.  He will be in no hurry.  I can get there ahead of him.\"  \"But if you should be discovered?\"  Gladys shrugged her shoulders and was gone before her mother could protest.  Outside she dashed up to the Schweiring automobile and cried to the chauffeur.  \"To General Rentzel's quarters!  Quick!\"  The machine sprang forward with a lurch.  Two minutes later, Gladys, peering from the car, made out as they passed what she took to be General, Rentzel's machine.  She urged the chauffeur on even faster.  Half a block from the general's quarters, she ordered her driver to stop and then to take up position down a side street, where it was dark, and wait for her.  These instructions were obeyed without question.  Gladys hurried toward the house.  There was no light to be seen as she ascended the steps and laid a hand on the door knob.  Nevertheless the girl moved silently, for she did not know what servants might be in the house.  The door opened without a sound.  Gladys advanced into the darkness.  From time to time she stopped as she moved along, but she was so afraid that General Rentzel might arrive before she could warn Hal and McKenzie that she wasted little time.  She came to a door, which opened noiselessly.  She peered into the darkness, and in what appeared to be another room she saw what looked like a star.  The girl breathed a cry of thankfulness.  She knew that she had found what she sought.  She moved forward more rapidly.  As she walked along toward the light, she suddenly tripped over an obstacle hidden by the mantle of darkness and fell to the floor.  There was a crash that resounded throughout the house.      CHAPTER VIII  HAL GETS THE LIST  When Hal and McKenzie stopped in the entrance way upon finding that the door was locked, Hal took from the little grip he carried a long skeleton key.  This had been procured for him by Mrs. Schweiring, and Hal knew that it would unlock almost any door.  To gain entrance to the house, therefore, was but the matter of an instant.  From his grip again Hal produced a small flashlight, with which he lighted their way.  Thanks to the lad's previous visit to the house, he knew right where he was going, so there was no time lost in search.  Straight to the large safe in the general's private office Hal led the way.  There he passed the light to McKenzie and placed the grip on the floor.  \"No chance it has been left unlocked, I guess,\" the lad muttered. \"However, I'll try it.\"  He shook the handle. The safe was locked.  \"As I thought,\" said Hal.  \"Well, the rest will take time.  Turn the light on the lock, McKenzie.\"  McKenzie obeyed.  From his grip Hal took an ordinary cake of soap.  This he proceeded to rub around the lock and stuff into the cracks.  This done to his satisfaction, he stepped back and surveyed his work.  \"All right, I guess,\" he said.  \"I never tackled anything like this before, but I think I know how it's done.\"  The next article he produced from the grip was a small vial.  One look told McKenzie what it was.  It contained nitroglycerine.  This Hal poured under the edge of the safe.  Then he attached a fuse and lighted it.  Immediately he threw a heavy blanket, which was the last article the grip contained, over the safe to muffle the sound of the explosion that would occur in a few moments.  \"Get back in the corner and crouch down, McKenzie,\" said Hal, and did the same thing himself.  At that moment there was a crash in the adjoining room.  Hal's revolver leaped out, as did McKenzie's, and both dashed into the room.  McKenzie flashed the light across the floor, and there, just getting to her feet, was Gladys.  \"Quick!  You must fly!\" she cried.  \"General Rentzel is on his way and will be here at any moment.\"  The fuse in the other room was burning fast, as Hal knew.  The lad determined, in that instant, that he would not leave the house without getting the list for which he had come.  He pulled Gladys back into the room where the fuse was fast burning to the safe.  McKenzie followed, and the three crouched down.  A moment and there was a muffled explosion, followed by a flash of fire.  Smoke filled the room.  With a cry to the others to stay where they were, Hal dashed to the safe.  It was as he hoped.  The door had been blown clear.  Quickly Hal explored the contents of the safe.  Then he gave a cry of delight.  His hand encountered what he felt sure was the book he sought.  He ran across the room with it to where McKenzie held the flashlight and by its glow examined his prize.  It was the list he sought.  Hal hesitated one moment, and then he pressed the book into the hands of Gladys.  \"Quick!\" he said. \"Out the window with you.  Give this to Chester and tell him to get out of Berlin at once.  Tell him he will be followed but that he must get through.\"  \"But you--\"' protested Gladys.  There came the sound of rapid footsteps in the next room.  Hal picked Gladys up in his arms, carried her to the window, and dropped her to the ground as he said in a low voice:  \"To hesitate means failure.  Do as I say and quickly.\"  He returned to McKenzie's side.  When he reached there McKenzie extinguished his light.  \"Well, we've got the list,\" he said quietly.  \"We have,\" Hal agreed, \"but"]]]
