Instantly I can be in the crowded streets of the world's metropolis. I walk through its well remembered thoroughfares, I hear the rush and roar of its busy multitudes, the rumble of vehicles, the huckster's cries, the cab-men's calls, sharp exclamations and quick retorts in the jostling throngs, the beggar's piping cry, the sailor's song, fragments of conversation, broken strains of music, the blare of trumpets, the neighing of horses, ear-piercing whistles, ringing of bells, shouts, responses, rushing trains and all that mingled din and soul-stirring roar that rises in clamor above the great town's traffic.  [Footnote A: \"Sensations, once experienced, modify the nervous organism, so that copies of them arise again in the mind after the original outward stimulus is gone. No mental copy, however, can arise in the mind, of any kind of sensation which has never been directly excited from without.  \"The blind may dream of sights, the deaf of sounds, for years after they have lost their vision or hearing; but the man born deaf can never be made to imagine what sound is like, nor can the man born blind ever have a mental vision. In Locke's words, already quoted, 'the mind can frame unto itself no one new simple idea.' The originals of them all must have been given from without. Fantasy, or Imagination, are the names given to the faculty of reproducing copies of originals once left. The imagination is called 'reproductive' when the copies are literal; 'productive' when elements from different originals are recombined so as to make new wholes\" (Wm. James: \"Psychology,\" p. 302).]  At will, I leave all this and stand alone on mountain tops in Syria, India, or overlooking old Nile's valley, wrapped in the awful grandeur of solemn silence. Here I may bid fallen empires rise and pass in grand procession before my mental vision and live again their little lives; fight once more their battles; begin again each petty struggle for place, for power, for control of the world's affairs; revive their customs; live again their loves and hates, and preach once more their religions and their philosophies--all this the mind may do, and that as easily and as quickly as in thought it may leave this room, cross the street to a neighbor's home, and there take note of the familiar objects within his habitation.[A]  [Footnote A: \"Mormon Doctrine of Deity,\" p. 132.]  _6. Ratiocination:_[A] \"The mind (Intelligence) can combine various general principles or individual facts and principles; and in the combination and comparison of them, it can perceive other facts and principles.[B] In other words, Intelligence is capable of reasoning; of building up conclusions from the data of its knowledge. It has the power of deliberation and of judgment; by which it may determine that this state or condition is better than another state or condition. That this, tending to good, should be encouraged; and that, tending to evil, should be discouraged, or, if possible, destroyed.  [Footnote A: The process of deducing conclusions from premises.]  [Footnote B: \"The Truth of Thought,\" p. 40.]  _7. Power of Volition:_ Intelligence, as embodied in man, is also conscious of the power, within certain limitations, to will, and to perform what he wills to do: To rise up, to sit down; to raise his arm, to let it fall; to walk, to run, to stand; to go to Paris, to Berlin, or to Egypt; to write a book, to build a house, to found a hospital; to control largely his actions, physical and moral; he can be sober or drunken; chaste, or a libertine; benevolent or selfish; honest or a rogue. Having deliberated upon this and that and having formed a judgment that one thing is better than another, or that one condition is better than another, he has power to choose between them and can determine to give his aid to this and withhold it from that. So that volition, within certain limitations at least, seems also to be a quality of Intelligence.[A] It is of course possible to conceive of Intelligence and its necessarily attendant consciousness, existing without volition; but Intelligence so conceived is shorn of its glory, since under such conditions it can make no use whatsoever of its powers. Its very thinking would be chaotic; its consciousness distressing. If active at all its actions would be without purpose and as chaotic as its thinking would be, unless it could be thought of as both thinking and acting as directed by an intelligent, purposeful will external to itself: which would still leave the Intelligence a mere automaton, without dignity or moral quality, or even intellectual value.[B] I therefore conclude that while it is possible to conceive of Intelligence with its necessarily attendant consciousness as without volition, still, so far as we are acquainted with Intelligence, as manifested through men, volition--sometimes named soul-freedom or free-agency is a quality that within certain limitations, attends upon Intelligences and may be an inherent quality of Intelligence, a necessary attribute of its very essence, as much so as is consciousness itself.  [Footnote A: Seventy's Second Year Book, Lesson I and IV.]  [Footnote B:    \"Freedom and reason make us men,   Take these away, what are we then?   Mere animals, and just as well   The beasts may think of heaven or hell.\"        --\"Latter-day Saints' Hymn Book,\" p. 263.]  _8. Recapitulation:_ We have found, then,  1. That Intelligences are eternal--self-existing intelligent entities;  2. That they are called Intelligences because intelligence is their chief characteristic;  3. That being intelligent consciousness is in them a necessary quality;  4. That they are both self-conscious, and conscious of an external universe not self;  5. That Intelligences have the power to generalize--to rise from the contemplation of the particular to the general, from the individual to universal;  6. That Intelligences can perceive the existence of certain a priori principles that are incontrovertible--necessary truths--which form a basis of knowledge;  7. That Intelligences as known through men possess a power of imagination or imaginative memory by which they hold pictures of sense perceptions before the mind and may form from them new combinations of thought and consciousness;  8. That Intelligences have power to reason (ratiocination), to deliberate, to form judgments;  9. That Intelligences have volition, physical, mental and moral, within certain limitations--a power both to will and to do; in other words they are free, or free agents.  It should be understood that these brief remarks respecting Intelligence and Intelligences are in no sense a treatise, even brief and cursory, on psychology; they are made merely to indicate some of the chief qualities that are inseparably connected with Intelligence and Intelligences so that when the words are used in this treatise, some definite idea may be had as to what is meant.

Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\" (Doc. & Cov., Sec. 93:29.)_  DISCUSSION.  _1. Eternity of Intelligence:_ In the preface of St. John's Gospel it is written: \"I. the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. * * And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth\" (John 1:1-4, 14). This is in plain allusion to the Christ, and bears witness, as all are agreed,[A] to the co-eternity of the Word of Christ with God, the Father.  [Footnote A: See \"Commentary,\" Jamieson,--Fauset-Brown on St. John 1:1-4. Also \"International Revision Commentary,\" Schaff--on St. John 1:1-4. The latter contrasting Gen. 1:1 with St. John's \"in the beginning,\" says that the sacred historian (Moses) starts from the beginning and comes downwards, thus keeping us in the course of time. John starts from the same point, but goes upwards, thus taking us into the eternity preceding time. In Gen. 1:1, we are told that God \"in the beginning created,\"--an act done in time. Here (John 1:1) we are told that \"in the beginning the Word was,\" a very strongly antithetical to \"come into being\" (verses 3, 14, comp. 8:58), and implying an absolute existence preceding, the point referred to. As that which is absolute self-existent, not created--that which is--is eternal, so the predication of eternity is involved in the clause before us taken as a whole. He who thus \"was in the beginning,\" who, as we afterwards read, \"was with God,\" and \"was God,\" here bears the name of the \"Word,\" Logos, which means both reason--[intelligence?] and word [expression?] For justification of the interpolated words in brackets, I refer to Dummelow's Commentary on the same passage: \"Logos has two meanings in Greek: (1) Reason or intelligence as it exists inwardly in the mind; and (2) reason or intelligence as it is expressed outwardly in speech and both these meanings are to be understood when Christ is called the \"Word of God.\" Commentary on John 1:1-4.]  In the Doctrine and Covenants this doctrine of the co-eternity of the \"Word\" with God is reaffirmed, and also is expressed more explicitly. \"John,\" the Christ is represented as saying, \"saw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60491"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Fourth Year (#3)"],["body"," and bore record of the fullness of my glory. * * * And he bore record saying, 'I saw his glory that he was in the beginning before the world was. Therefore in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation, the light and the Redeemer of the World'\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 93:6-9).  _2. Extension of the Doctrine of Co-eternity:_ But not only is the doctrine of the co-eternity of the Christ with God the Father affirmed in this revelation, but that co-eternity is extended to the spirits (Intelligences--of which more later) of men. \"Verily I say unto you,\" the Christ is represented as saying, \"I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the first born. * * * Ye, [addressing the brethren present when the revelation was given]--Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is spirit [that is, that part of you which is spirit--i. e., Intelligence--that was in the beginning with God], even the spirit of truth.\"  _3. Extension of the Doctrine of Co-Eternity to all Intelligences:_ In a subsequent verse this doctrine of co-eternity is extended to the whole race of men; \"man [the race] was also in the beginning with God.\" And that statement is immediately followed with this: \"Intelligence, or the light of truth [that which perceives truth], was not created or made, neither indeed can be\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 93:29). Let us recapitulate: The co-eternity of the Christ and God the Father \"in the beginning before the world was,\" is affirmed. Then the like co-eternity of the spirits of the men present when the revelation was given is affirmed. After which the like co-eternity of \"Man\"--used in the generic sense, meaning the race, is affirmed; followed by the declaration that \"Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be,\" then of course, it follows that Intelligences are eternal, self-existing things.  It may be urged, however, that the word \"Intelligence\" in the revelation quoted above is used in the singular, not in the plural form. And hence may refer to \"Intelligence\" in general, as being uncreated and unbeatable, and not to the eternity of individual Intelligences. But the passage immediately preceding the declaration \"Man also was in the beginning with God,\" stands as an explanation of that declaration. The word Intelligence in the passage quoted is governed as to its meaning by \"Man\" in the sentence--\"Man was also in the beginning with God:\" and now, \"Intelligence,\" [the intelligent entity in man, in the race--and surely the Intelligence in each man is a complete and separate entity] \"was not created or made, neither indeed can be.\" In other words, these Intelligences are as eternal as God is, or as the Christ is, or the Holy Spirit. This becomes more apparent when we learn in a subsequent verse of the revelation that \"man is spirit\" (verse 33). That is, in the inner fact of him, in the power and glory of him, man is not so many pounds avoirdupois of bone, muscle, lime, phosphate, water and the like; but in the great fact of him he is spirit--spirit substance and Intelligence.[A] And so far as human or revealed knowledge can aid one in forming a conclusion, there is no \"Intelligence\" existing separate and apart from persons, from intelligent entities, from individuals. Either it exists as persons, or as preceding from them, as a power or force, but never separated from them, any more than a ray of light is separated from the luminous body whence it proceeds. So that if any affirm a \"universal Intelligence,\" or \"Cosmic Mind,\" or \"Over Soul,\" in the universe, it is an influence, a power proceeding either from an individual Intelligence or from harmonized individual Intelligences, a mind atmosphere proceeding from them--a projection of their mind power into the universe, as the sun and all suns, project light and warmth into the universe.[B]  [Footnote A: \"That is the more real part of a man in which his characteristics and his qualities are. All the facts and phenomena of life confirm the doctrine that the soul is the real man. What makes the quality of a man? What gives him character as good or bad, small or great, lovable or detestable? Do these qualities pertain to the body? Every one knows that they do not. But they are qualities of the mind. Then the real man is not the body, but the living soul\" (Samuel M. Warren, \"World's Parliament of Religions,\" Vol. I, p. 480).]  [Footnote B: \"Mormon Doctrine of Deity,\" p. 166-169, where the subject is discussed at some length under the title, \"Of God, the Spirit of the Gods.\"]  _4. Proof of the Co-eternity of all Intelligences:_ In further evidence of the eternal existence of individual Intelligences I quote from the Book of Abraham:      \"If two things exist and there be one above the other, there shall     be greater things above them. * * * If there be two spirits,     and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two     spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other,     have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end,     they shall exist after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal\" (Book of     Abraham, Chs. 3, 16, 18).  To this may be added the teaching of the Prophet Joseph Smith who, in the closing days of his earthly ministry, dwelt much upon this subject and treated it with great emphasis. At the conference of the Church at Nauvoo in April, 1844, in a sermon, he said.      \"The soul--the mind of man--the immortal spirit--where did it come     from? All learned men and doctors of divinity say that God created     it in the beginning, but it is not so; the very idea lessens man     in my estimation. I do not believe the doctrine. I know better.     Hear it, all ye ends of the world, for God has told me so, if you     don't believe me, it will not make the truth without effect We say     that God himself is a self-existent being. Who told you so? It is     correct enough, but how did it get into your head? Who told you     that man did not exists in like manner, upon the same principles?     Man does exist upon the same principles. * * * The mind or the     intelligence which man possess is co-equal, [co-eternal][A] with     God himself. I know my testimony is true. * * * I am dwelling on     the immorality of the spirit of man. Is it logical to say that the     intelligence of spirits is immortal, and yet that it (i. e., the     intelligence) had a beginning? The intelligence of spirits had no     beginning, neither will it have an end. That is good logic. That     which has a beginning may have an end. There never was a time when     there were no spirits, for they are co-equal [co-eternal] with our     Father in heaven. * * * Intelligence is eternal and exists upon a     self-existent principle. It is a spirit from age to age and there     is no creation about it. * * * The first principles of a man are     self-existent with God.\"[B]  [Footnote A: The Prophet could not have intended to teach that the intelligence in man was \"co-equal with God,\" except as to being co-equal in eternity with God, since the Book of Abraham teaches that God is more intelligent than all other intelligences (Ch. iii:19), and the Prophet himself taught the same truth. Hence the insertion of the word above in brackets. It must be remembered that the report of this discourse was not stenographic and this was doubtless a verbal error, due to imperfect reporting.]  [Footnote B: King Follett Sermon, April, 1844, \"Improvement Era,\" Vol. XII, Jan. 1909. Also \"Journal of Discourses,\" Vol. VI.]  _5. Words used Interchangeably:_ Here it is necessary to repeat with some additions, what was said in Year Book II, on the use of words interchangeably: It is often the case that misconceptions arise through a careless use of words, and through using words interchangeably, without regard to shades of differences that attach to them; and this in the scriptures as in other writings. Indeed, this fault is more frequent in the scriptures perhaps than in any other writings for the reason that, for the most part, they are composed by men who did not aim at scientific exactness in the use of words. They were not in most cases equal to such precision in the use of language, in the first place; and in the second, they depended more upon the general tenor of what they wrote for making truth apparent than upon technical precision in a choice of words; ideas, not niceness of expression, was the burden of their souls; thought, not its dress. Hence, in scripture, and I might say especially in modern scripture, a lack of careful or precise choice of words, a large dependence upon the general tenor of what is written to convey the truth, a wide range in using words interchangeably that are not always exact equivalents, are characteristics. Thus the expression, \"Kingdom of God,\" \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" \"the Whole Family in Heaven,\" \"the Church of Christ,\" \"the Church of God,\" are often used interchangeably for the Church of Christ when they are not always equivalents; so, too, are used the terms \"Spirit of God,\" and \"Holy Ghost;\" \"Spirit of Christ,\" and \"the Holy Ghost;\" \"Spirit,\" and \"Soul;\" \"intelligences,\" and \"spirits,\" and \"angels.\" I mention this in passing, because I believe many of the differences of opinion and much of the confusion of ideas that exist arise out of our not recognizing, or our not remembering these facts. Hereafter let the student be on his guard in relation to the use of the words \"intelligences,\" \"spirits,\" \"soul,\" \"mind,\" etc.; and he will find his way out of many a difficulty.  Let the closing part of the quotation from the Prophet's discourse above be considered in the light of the suggestions made here respecting the use of words interchangeably. It is observed that he uses the words \"Intelligence\" and \"spirit\" interchangeably--one for the other; and yet we can discern that it is the \"intelligence of spirits,\" not \"spirits\" entire (see next subdivision) that is the subject"]]]
