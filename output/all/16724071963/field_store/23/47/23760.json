Commenting on the passage in Exodus, a somewhat celebrated authority (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown's Commentary) says:      \"An order of Seventy was to be created, either by a selection from     the existing staff of Elders, or by the appointment of new ones,     empowered to assist him [Moses] by their collective wisdom and     experience in the onerous cares of government. The Jewish writers     say that this was the origin of the Sanhedrim, or supreme appellate     court of their nation. But there is every reason to believe that it     was only a temporary expedient, adopted to meet a trying exigency.\"  Catholic commentators, however, positively assert that this appointment of the Seventy Elders \"was the first institution of the Council or Senate, called the Sanhedrim, consisting of seventy or seventy-two Senators, or Counselors.\" (Douay Bible, foot-note, Numb. xi: 16-25.)  But Dr. William Smith, in his Old Testament History, says:      \"The appointment of the Seventy Elders has often been regarded as     the germ of the Sanhedrim. They seem rather to have been a Senate,     whose office was confined to assisting Moses in the government,     and ceased with the cessation of his leadership. No trace of the     Sanhedrim is found till the return from the Babylonish captivity.     It is more certain that the manner of their consecration prefigured     the order of the Prophets.\" (Old Testament History, p. 185.)  From all this it will be seen that much confusion exists among the learned with reference to the exact nature of the office of the Seventy. From the revelations of the Lord, however, to the Prophet Joseph Smith, we learn that the Priesthood existed in Israel in the days of Moses, but that \"he took Moses out of their midst and the Holy Priesthood also,\" but that \"the lesser Priesthood continued, which Priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel\" only. With this as a key, that is, with the knowledge that the \"Holy Priesthood,\" meaning by that the higher, or Melchisedek Priesthood, existed in Israel in the days of Moses, it is fairly safe to conclude that the Seventy Elders of the two passages in question were really a quorum of the Seventy as we know it, and that perhaps the princes at the head of the twelve tribes of Israel may have occupied a position somewhat analogous to, if not identical with, that of the Twelve Apostles in the later Church, though it must be admitted that the latter suggestion, especially is merely conjecture. The conclusion with reference to the Seventy, however, takes on increased probability when the spiritual powers exercised by the Seventy described in Numb. xi: 24, 29, is taken into account; powers that are so nearly akin to those of the Seventy in the Meridian and later dispensations of the gospel.  2. _The Seventy of the New Testament:_ The opinions of ecclesiastical writers with reference to the Seventy mentioned in Luke x, seem to be as hopelessly inconclusive as those held with reference to the Seventy in the Mosaic polity.. Some, for instance, hold that \"no power or authority was formally conferred upon the Seventy, their mission being only temporary, and indeed for one divine purpose; its primary object was to prepare for the coming of the Master in the places to which they were sent; and their selection was from a wider circle of disciples, the number being now seventy instead of twelve.\" So says Edersheim (Jesus the Messiah, Vol. II, p. 136), from which it appears that he does not regard the Seventy as permanent officers in the Church, because, as he assumes, their mission was temporary.  Whereas, on the other hand, Dr. Smith holds that \"their office did not cease with the fulfillment of their immediate and temporary mission, but was to continue.\" (Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, Vol. IV, Article, Seventy Disciples.)  Jamieson-Fausset-Brown's Commentary, on the passage, says:      \"The mission [i. e., of the Seventy], unlike that of the Twelve,     was evidently quite temporary. All the instructions are in keeping     with a brief and hasty pioneering mission, intended to supply what     of general preparation for coming events, the Lord's own visit     afterwards to the same \"cities and places\" would not from want of     time, now suffice to accomplish; whereas the instructions to the     Twelve, besides embracing all those of the Seventy, contemplate     world-wide and permanent effects. Accordingly, after their return     from this single missionary tour, we never again read of the     Seventy.\"  \"We never again read of the Seventy\" should be limited, however, to the books of the New Testament, for in the ecclesiastical writers which succeed the New Testament authors, mention is made of individual members of this body of Seventy, and of their labors. For instance, Eusebius has the following passage with reference to them.      \"The names of our Savior's Apostles are sufficiently obvious to     every one, from his gospels; but of the seventy disciples, no     catalogue is given anywhere. Barnabas, indeed, is said to have been     one of them, of whom there is distinguished notice in the Acts of     the Apostles; and also in St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians.     Sosthenes, who sent letters with Paul to the Corinthians, is said     to have been one of these. Clement, in the fifth of his Hypotyposes     or Institutions, in which he also mentions Cephas, of whom Paul     also says, that he came to Antioch, and \"that he withstood him to     his face;\"[3]--says, that one who had the same name with Peter     the Apostle, was one of the Seventy; and that Matthias, who was     numbered with the Apostles in place of Judas, and he who had been     honored to be a candidate with him, are also said to have been     deemed worthy of the same calling with the Seventy. They also say     that Thaddeus was one of them; concerning whom I shall presently     relate a narrative that has come down to us. Moreover, if any one     observe with attention, he will find more disciples of our Savior     than the Seventy, on the testimony of Paul, who says, that \"he     appeared after his resurrection, first to Cephas, then to the     Twelve, and after these to five hundred brethren at once.\" Of whom,     he says, \"some are fallen asleep,\" but the greater part were living     at the time he wrote.\" (Eccl. Hist. Eusebius, Chap. xii.)  In the chapter following the one from which the foregoing quotation is taken, Eusebius refers to Thaddeus in the most positive manner as being one of the Seventy, and that he was sent by Thomas, the Apostle, to visit King Agbarus. (See Eusebius' Eccl. History, Chap. xiii.)  3. _Of Their Being More Than One Quorum of Seventy in the Meridian Dispensation:_ In all comments upon the Seventy mentioned in St. Luke, chapter x, one thing seems to have been strangely overlooked; namely, that Jesus had appointed other quorums of Seventy before those mentioned by the third Evangelist. Such is the plain implication of the first verse in said chapter, to-wit:  \"After these things the Lord appointed _other_ Seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face,\" etc. Undoubtedly, it is in their collective capacity that they are referred to here, since the term \"Seventy\" is used in the singular; and before the appointment of this Seventy mentioned in Luke, Jesus had appointed \"other Seventy,\" or quorums of Seventy, how many may not be determined. In I Cor.: xv, where Paul described the appearances of Jesus after the resurrection, it is said \"that he was seen of Cephas (Peter), then of the Twelve, after that he was seen of about five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.\" Now, taking the close relationship between the Twelve and the Seventy, the similarity of their mission and commission, (compare Luke x with Matthew x), and the fact that in the above quoted passage from Paul the appearances of Jesus is spoken of as being associated with Peter, then with the Twelve, and then of five hundred brethren at once, may it not be that those 500 brethren were those who held similar authority with the Twelve Apostles, namely, the Seventy, which would make, allowing for slight discrepancy and perhaps the attendance of the Twelve Apostles, among the five hundred, seven quorums of Seventy. (See Doc. & Cov. Sec. cvii: 95.) This is admittedly conjecture, and yet conjecture upon which strong probability attends.  4. _The Prophet's Vision of the Order in Church Government:_ It is evident from the account given in the history of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that the organization of the Twelve and the Seventy grew out of a vision he had concerning the order of Church organization, since both in his history and also in the revelation contained in the Doc. & Cov. Sec. 107, he repeatedly makes mention of that vision. In the minutes of the meeting at which the organization of the Twelve began, it is written that \"President Smith then stated that the meeting had been called because God had commanded it; and it was made known to him by vision and by the Holy Spirit.\" (History of the Church, Vol. II, p. 182, also note.)  In the revelation above referred to, describing the order of the Seventy, the Prophet says: \"It is according to the vision, showing the order of the Seventy, that there shall be seven presidents to preside over them, chosen out of the number of the Seventy.\"  5. _The First Quorums of Seventy Chosen from Zion's Camp:_ The first and second quorum of Seventy was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#4)"],["body","up, in the main, from that band of men who constituted Zion's camp, the camp, it will be remembered, that went up to the deliverance of the Saints who had been expelled from Jackson county in 1833. In the meeting referred to in the foregoing note, at which the Twelve were organized, it is stated that the Prophet related some of the circumstances attendant upon the journey of Zion's camp; its trials, sufferings, etc., and said, \"God had not designed all this for nothing, but he had it in remembrance yet; and it was the will of God that those who went to Zion (i. e., Missouri) with the determination to lay down their lives if necessary, should be ordained to the ministry and go forth to prune the vineyard for the last time.\" (History of the Church, Vol. ii, p. 182.) In an address to certain Elders assembled in Kirtland soon after the Seventy were organized, the Prophet said:      \"Brethren, some of you are angry with me, because you did not fight     in Missouri; but let me tell you, God did not want you to fight. He     could not organize his kingdom with twelve men to open the gospel     door to the nations of the earth, and with seventy men under their     direction to follow in their tracks, unless he took them from a     body of men who had offered their lives, and who had made as great     a sacrifice as did Abraham. Now the Lord has got his Twelve and     his Seventy, and there will be other quorums of Seventies called,     who will make the sacrifice, and those who have not made their     sacrifices and their offerings now, will make them hereafter.\"     (History of the Church, Vol.. II, p. 182 in note.)  From this, it appears, that the character of men who attain unto this high station in the Priesthood of God should be men who have made sacrifices for the work of God, or who are perfectly willing to make such sacrifices, even to laying down their lives for the cause.  _Organization of the Seventy in Dispensation of the Fullness of Times:_ The organization of the Seventies in the dispensation of the fulness of times began on the 28th of February, 1835, when, according to the History of the Prophet Joseph, \"The Church in council assembled, commenced selecting certain individuals to be Seventies from the number of those who went up to Zion with me in the camp (i. e., Zion's camp); and the following are the names of those who were ordained and blessed at that time (names omitted), to begin the organization of the first quorum of Seventies, according to the visions and revelations which I have received. The Seventies are to constitute traveling quorums, to go into all the earth, whithersoever the Twelve Apostles shall call them.\" (History of the Church, Vol. II, p. 201-302. See also notes on the text of those two pages.)  7. _President Joseph Young's Account of the Organization of the First Quorums of Seventy:_ The account of the organization of the Seventy given by the late Joseph Young, brother of President Brigham Young, who became the First President of the Seventy in this dispensation, is too important to be omitted, and therefore is given here in extenso:      \"On the 8th of February, in the year of our Lord 1835, the Prophet     Joseph Smith called Elders Brigham and Joseph Young to the chamber     of his residence, in Kirtland, Ohio; it being on the Sabbath day.     After they were seated, and he had made some preliminaries, he     proceeded to relate a vision to these brethren, of the state and     condition of those men who died in Zion's Camp, in Missouri. He     said, \"Brethren, I have seen those men who died of the cholera     in our camp; and the Lord knows, if I get a mansion as bright as     theirs, I ask no more.\" At this relation he wept, and for some time     could not speak. When he had relieved himself of his feelings, in     describing the vision, he resumed the conversation, and addressed     himself to Brother Brigham Young. Said he to him, \"I wish you to     notify all the brethren living in the branches, within a reasonable     distance from this place, to meet at a General Conference on     Saturday next. I shall then and there appoint twelve special     witnesses, to open the door of the gospel to foreign nations, and     you,\" said he (speaking to Brother Brigham), \"will be one of them.\"      He then proceeded to enlarge upon the duties of their calling.     The interest that was taken on the occasion of this announcement,     produced in the minds of the two Elders present a great sensation,     and many reflections; having previously notified Brother Brigham     Young that he would be one of the witnesses, but said nothing to     Joseph until he had exhausted much of his feelings in regard to the     Twelve, which took up some little time.      \"He then turned to Elder Joseph Young with quite an earnestness,     as though the vision of his mind was extended still further, and     addressing him, said: \"Brother Joseph, the Lord has made you     President of the Seventies.\"      \"They had heard of Moses and seventy Elders of Israel, and of Jesus     appointing other Seventies, but had never heard of Twelve Apostles     and of Seventies being called in this Church before. It was a     strange saying, \"The Lord has made you president of the Seventies,\"     as though it had already taken place, and it caused these brethren     to marvel.      \"The Prophet did not say that any others would be called to be the     bearers of this message abroad, but the inference might be clearly     drawn, that this was his meaning, from the language he used at the     time.      \"Agreeable to his request to Elder Brigham Young, the branches were     all notified, and a meeting of the brethren in General Conference     was held in Kirtland, in the new school house, under the printing     office, on the following Saturday, February 14th, when the Twelve     were appointed and ordained, and the Conference adjourned for two     weeks.      \"Pursuant to this adjournment, the Conference convened on Saturday,     the 28th of that month, when the first quorum of Seventies were     appointed and ordained, under the hands of the Prophet, his     Counselors, and others.      \"Adjourned meetings were held from time to time, and the second     quorum of Seventies were appointed and ordained.\"  8. _The First Report of the Seventy:_ The first report that the Seventies made of their labors seems to have given very great satisfaction to the Prophet. Under date of December 28, 1835, (less than a year after their organization) the Prophet says:      \"This day the Council of the Seventy met to render an account     of their travels and ministry, since they were ordained to that     Apostleship. The meeting was interesting, indeed, and my heart was     made glad while listening to the relation of those that had been     laboring in the vineyard of the Lord, with such marvelous success.     And I pray God to bless them with an increase of faith and power,     and keep them all, with the endurance of faith in the name of Jesus     Christ to the end.\" (History of the Church, Vol. II, p. 346.)  9. _The Anointing of the Seventy:_ The Seventies were privileged to receive their washings and anointings in the Kirtland Temple preparatory to its public dedication. The Presidency of the Seventy received their anointing and blessing under the hands of the Twelve Apostles on the 22nd of January, 1836; and had sealed \"upon their heads power and authority to anoint their brethren\"--the members of their quorums. (History of the Church, Vol. II, p. 383.) Under date of the 30th of January, 1836, members of the quorums were anointed and blessed, of which circumstance the Prophet says:      \"In the evening, went to the upper room of the Lord's house, and     set the different quorums in order. Instructed the presidents of     the Seventy concerning the order of their anointing, and requested     them to proceed and anoint the Seventy.\" (History of the Church,     Vol. II, p. 388.)  10. _The Seventy Sustained as Apostles:_ During the dedicatory services in the Kirtland Temple, March 27, 1836, when the various officers of the Church were sustained, the Seventies were sustained as \"Apostles and special witnesses to the nations to assist the Twelve,\" etc. I quote the passage in full.      \"I then called upon the quorums and congregation of Saints to     acknowledge the Twelve Apostles, who were present, as Prophets,     Seers, Revelators, and special witnesses to all the nations of the     earth, holding the keys of the kingdom, to unlock it, or cause it     to be done, among them, and uphold them by their prayers, which     they assented to by rising. I next called upon the quorums and     congregation of Saints to acknowledge the presidents of Seventies     who act as their representatives, as Apostles and special witnesses     to the nations, to assist the Twelve in opening the gospel kingdom     among all people, and to uphold them by their prayers, which they     did by rising.\" (History of the Church, Vol. II, p. 417-18.)  11. _The First Council of Seventy Lead Kirtland Camp to Missouri:_ Perhaps the greatest work achieved by the First Council of the Seventies in their organized capacity, was the organization of the Kirtland Camp, and leading it from Kirtland, Ohio, to Adam-ondi-Ahman, Missouri, a distance of 860 miles. The camp numbered 105 families, 529 souls in all. They left the vicinity of Kirtland on the 6th day of July, 1838, and arriving at Adam-ondi-Ahman on the 4th of October, of the same year. A full history of the organization of this camp and its journey is to be found in the History of the Church, Vol. III, p.. 87 to 148.  12. _Increase of Quorums at Nauvoo:_ At the October Conference, 1844, the number of the Seventy was greatly increased. On the third day of the conference, \"Elder George A. Smith moved that all in the Elders' quorum under the age of thirty-five should be ordained into the Seventies', if they are in"]]]
