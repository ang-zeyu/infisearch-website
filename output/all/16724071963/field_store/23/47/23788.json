He was God manifested in the flesh;[A] in him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;[B] it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;[C] he was the brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of his person.[D] But he was also the manifestation of, \"the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[E] Light of Christ, the God Immanent; the invisible made visible; the \"Unknown God\" of the Greeks made known in Jesus Christ through the preaching of Paul unto them; for whom they ignorantly worshiped declared he unto them by preaching Christ; saying that God whom he preached was not afar off--\"not far from every one of us: for in him we live, and move, and have our being,\"[F] making direct reference to that Spirit which fills the immensity of space, the \"Unknown God\" of the Greeks--the God Immanent, now manifested by the Christ whom Paul was preaching--from whose presence David could not flee; and to whom the darkness was the same as the light--to whom the night shineth as the day.[G]  [Footnote A: Tim iii:16 and marginal rendering of \"manifest\" in Oxford Bible.]  [Footnote B: Col. ii:9.]  [Footnote C: Col. i:19.]  [Footnote D: Heb. i:3.]  [Footnote E: St. John i:9.]  [Footnote F: Acts xvii:22-28.]  [Footnote G: Psalms cxxxix.]  _3. Moral Effect of the Conception of Immanence, Negatively Expressed:_ The conception of God as Immanent in the world is of utmost importance both as a religious and a philosophical truth. Its effect upon the mind as establishing a sense of nearness of God is most salutary in its moral effects, and uplifting in its spiritual power. To sense that one lives in the presence of the Divine Consciousness--that known unto God are all his thoughts and all his doings; to dwell with One from whom the darkness and the light are both alike; from whom there is no fleeing; for if one ascend into heaven, lo, He is there; if one make his bed in hell, behold, He is there; if one would take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth or of the sea--there also is this Immanent Spirit.[A] To live thus in a consciousness of the Divine Presence and Power, makes for righteousness of life. For where may sin and wickedness hide themselves? There is no refuge for them--no escape. If one shall say--\"surely the darkness shall cover me,\" even the night shall be light about him.[B] Iniquity may not hide itself, and as sin loves not the light, negatively the moral force of consciously living in the presence of God is very great.  [Footnote A: Psalms cxxxix.]  [Footnote B: Ibid.]  _4. Moral Effect of the Doctrine of Immanence, Affirmatively Expressed:_ Affirmatively expressed, the conception and the result of it are even greater, both morally and spiritually. To live consciously in the presence of God must be a source of annoyance and vexation to evil disposed men; and even to men inclined to virtue, an embarrassment, at times, when they recall their many failures to live in harmony with their ideals.[A] But, on the other hand, for these of the latter class, when they realize that the Divine Presence is sympathetic; that He knows, not only \"what's done,\" but also \"what's resisted;\" that He knows of the struggle for the attainment of virtue--the hungering and the thirsting after righteousness; that He knows the strength of the temptation, and the weakness of the tempted; that He knows the heart, \"each chord, its various tone; each spring, its various bias;\" and He will judge, not after the sight of the eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of the ears, but with righteousness shall He judge, and reprove with equity;[B] judging, \"not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\"[C] Men can be assured of a correct registration and truthful report of their deeds, and a judgment upon them neither partial nor prejudiced; which, while it may cause the wicked to tremble, to men conscious of the uprightness of their intentions, and of honest effort in right directions, as God gives them vision to see the right--what encouragement to earnest striving this conception of living in the very presence of God must bring! What calmness it must bring in the midst of conflict! what peace! what assurance of triumph notwithstanding failures, and losses, and the sad exhibitions of human weakness--the outgrowth of a fallen human nature!  [Footnote A: Professor Joseph Le Conte, Professor of Geology and Natural History in the University of California, answering a supposed objection that one might not live and work effectively in the presence of the Immanent Deity, said: \"It may alas! be true that this view [Immanence of God in the world] brings us too near Him in our sense of spiritual nakedness and short-coming. It may, indeed, be that we can not live and work in the continual realized presence of the Infinite. It may, indeed, be that we must still wear the evil of a practical materialism on our hearts and minds. It may, indeed, be that in our practical life and scientific work we must still continue to think of natural forces as efficient agents. But, if so, let us at least remember that this attitude of mind must be regarded only as our ordinary work-clothes--necessary work-clothes it may be of our outer lower life--to be put aside when we return home to our inner higher life, religious and philosophical. (Evolution in Its Relation to Religious Thought\"--1902--pp. 302-3.)]  [Footnote B: Isaiah xi:3, 4.]  [Footnote C: St. John vii:24.]  _5. The Helpfulness that Comes from the Sense of the Nearness of God--His Immanence:_ Moreover, if the view point of this treatise be the true one, and all the attributes of the Divine nature are carried over into the Divine Spirit that proceeds forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space--being the God Immanent--then one may be assured that living at all times and in all places in the presence of the Immanent Spirit, he resides in the atmosphere, at least, of the wisdom, the love, and the mercy of God; which can but add to his comfort, to his assurance, to his strength. Such an one with David can say--  \"Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Psalms, cxl:23, 24.]  And else he may say--  \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou are near me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort mc.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Psalm, xxiii:24.]  Under this sense of nearness, which springs from the doctrine of Immanence, one may again say with David:  \"Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;  \"To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.  \"Our soul waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our shield.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Psalms xxxiii:18-20.]  And yet again:  \"The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.  \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Psalms xxxiv:18, 19.]  Also:  \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  \"Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;  \"Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.  \"There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high.  \"God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.  \"The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.  \"The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Psalms xlvi:1-7.]  All which loving trust comes from that blessed sense of nearness of God born of the great doctrine of Immanence--God resident in the world, here and now--a dynamic power in the world--that makes for righteousness, and of which the Christ was and is the manifestation, the Revealer; and the Immanent Spirit is \"the Light of Christ.\"    LESSON IV.

Modern Revival of the Doctrine of Immanence:_ On the philosophical side of this conception of the Immanence of God, we are assured that it is the result of the modern world's (i.e. _post Kantian_) thinking.[A] Of its value to human thinking and to religion itself, John Fiske--after pointing out the fact that both Clement and Athanasius among the early Christian fathers had held somewhat to the doctrine of immanence as conceived in more modern philosophy, viz--\"God Immanent in the universe, and eternally creative\"--says:  [Footnote A: \"One can securely say that nothing of crucial import has come forward in the interest of human freedom [i.e. freedom of the human will--man as a free moral agent] since Kant started the inspiring but hitherto little fruitful conception of moral autonomy. Instead, as we have seen, the world's thinking has been absorbed in questions that thus far have ended in a persuasion of the immanence of the eternal in all things--at best the all-pervasive presence of an immanent spirit.\" Howison, \"Conceptions of God,\" Introductions p. 32.]  \"Once really adopt the conception of an ever-present God, without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground, and it becomes self-evident that the law of gravitation is but an expression of a particular mode of divine action."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60492"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Fifth Year (#6)"],["body","what is thus true of one law is true of all laws. The thinker in whose mind divine action is thus identified with orderly action and to whom a really irregular phenomenon would seem like a manifestation of sheer diabolism, forsees in every possible extension of knowledge a fresh confirmation of his faith in God. From his point of view there can be no antagonism between our duty as inquirers and our duty as worshipers. To him no part of the universe is godless. In the swaying to and fro of molecules and the ceaseless pulsations of ether, in the secular shiftings of planetary orbits, in the busy work of frost and raindrop, in the mysterious sprouting of the seed, in the everlasting tale of death and life renewed, in the dawning of the babe's intelligence, in the varied deeds of men from age to age, he finds that which awakens the soul to reverential awe; and each act of scientific explanation but reveals an opening through which shines the glory of the Eternal Majesty.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Fiske-Studies in Religion, pp. 167-3, Works Vol. IX]  _2. The World Immanent in God:_ Still one other thought from the philosophical side of the conception of Immanence is that it enables one to see not only God in nature, but as a necessary corollary, nature in God--\"Divine immanence in the world, and the reciprocal immanence of the world in God.\"[A] That is to say, in one view, God's presence and power penetrates and pervades nature--the universe; in another view, nature is received into the all-including spiritual presence of God: as the One indwells in the other; so the other dwells in the One.  [Footnote A: Howison--\"The Conception of God.\" p. 96.]  Before now the student has doubtless looked into the clear depths of a crystal-like spring of water; and has seen on the sandy floor of the spring the sunlight that tells him that the sun penetrates the water, in-dwells in the water, or, in poetic terms--    \"The sunshine in water lies sleeping.\"  And as the sunlight penetrates the water so does the water receive and hold the sunlight. As it is in the crystal spring, so is it in the ocean. And so in the universe with the immanence of God and the reciprocal immanence of the world in God. As saith the revelation:  \"Judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne, and governeth and executeth all things. He comprehendeth all things, and all things are before him, and all things are round him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by nim, and of him, even God forever and forever.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Doc. and Cov., Sec. lxxxviii:41.]  The chief value of this statement of the case--apart from the fact of it as a truth--is, it helps one to understand the completeness of the presence of God in the world; so complete is it, that the world is also in God! Also it helps one to an understanding of the more restricted view of the same principle announced in St. John, the declaration of the Christ: \"Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me\"; and that he and the Father are one[A]--i.e., the divine nature and spirit are one. One nature participated in by both Father and Son and finally to be participated in by those who are the disciples of the Christ; for in his prayer immediately preceding the hour of his passion--the most pathetic and soul-moving prayer preserved in human language--referring to his disciples he said:  [Footnote A: St. John xiv:11; also xvii.]  \"Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me, that they may be one as we are. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, and the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one. * * * I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I am them.\"[A]  [Footnote A: St. John xvii. Paul doubtless refers to the same principle when he says: \"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named; that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in Jove, may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth and length and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fullness of God.\" (Eph. iii:14-19.)  And also when he said:  \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\" (Philippians ii:5, 6.)]  _3. One Divine Nature in Many Persons:_ One divine nature, then, is the conclusion; but a divine nature in manifold persons, many, though indeed one, because harmonized into unity of purpose, and will; one divine spirit, rising from one divine nature--though participated in by many; a spirit rising from all Intelligences who have attained to the divine nature and unity in all and through all, manifesting God in his splendor and glory, as creating, sustaining, and guiding power in the universe--both Immanent and personal.  Elsewhere I have said on this subject: One cannot help being profoundly impressed with the great truth that creation, throughout its whole extent, bears evidence of being one system: that it presents at every point unity of design, and harmony in its government. Nor am I unmindful of the force there is in the deduction usually drawn from these premises, _viz._, that the Creator and Governor of the universe, must necessarily be One. But I am also profoundly impressed by another fact that comes within the experience of man, at least to a limited extent, _viz._: the possibility of intelligences arriving at perfect agreement, so as to act in absolute unity. We see manifestations of this principle in human governments, and other human associations of various kinds. And this, too, is observable, viz., that the greater and more perfect the individual intelligence, the more perfect can the unity of purpose and of effort become for the community of intelligences; so that one need only conceive the existence of perfect intelligences to operate together in order to secure perfect oneness; then shall come the one system evident in the universe, exhibiting at every point unity of design, and perfect harmony in its government. In other words, \"oneness\" can be the result of perfect agreement among many intelligences as surely as it can be the result of the existence of One Only Intelligence. Also, the decrees and purposes of the perfectly united Many can be as absolute as the decrees and purposes of the One Only Intelligence. One is also confronted with the undeniable fact that inclines him to the latter view as the reasonable explanation of the \"Oneness\" that is evidently in control of the universe--the fact that there are in existence many Intelligences, and, endowed as they are with free will, it cannot be denied that they influence, to some extent, the course of events and the conditions that obtain. Moreover, it will be found, on careful inquiry, that the explanation of the \"Oneness\" controlling in the universe, on the theory that it results from perfect agreement or unity of Many Intelligences, is more in harmony with the revelations of God on the subject than the theory that there is but One Only Intelligence that enters into its government.[A]  [Footnote A: Mormon Doctrine of Deity, pp. 137-8.]  John Stuart Mill, in his Essay on Theism, in speaking of the evident unity in nature, which suggests that nature is governed by One Being, comes very near stating the exact truth in an alternative proposition to his first remark, viz.: \"A. least, if a plurality be supposed, it is necessary to assume so complete a concert of action and unity of will among them, that the difference is for most purposes immaterial between such a theory and that of the absolute unity of the Godhead.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Essays on Religion; Theism p. 133.]  _4. Immanence and Manifestation:_ We must believe from the scriptures previously considered in these lessons that God by his spirit is everywhere and equally present, but it does not follow that the _manifestation_ of God is everywhere and equally the same. There are doubtless persons, conditions, and places, that present more favorable natures and conditions to the manifestation of this universal presence than others. Undoubtedly, if the assumption of this treatise be the right one, _viz._, that the God Immanent, for us men in the kingdom of the universe we inhabit known as \"the Light of Christ\"--carries with it the divine attributes of truth, wisdom, justice, holiness, and love, with the rest, then it follows, since like his affinity[A] to like, that there may be, as said above, persons, conditions and places more congenial to manifestation of the divine spirit than others. There are individual men and perhaps races of men more responsive to the Divine Presence and the divine attributes of which that presence is the atmosphere, than others; and where this is the case there will be the larger manifestation of God. Hence the difference observable among individuals and races and at variant times and places. Those who draw near to God, he draws near to them in manifestations of his presence and power; those who love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil, receive not the light; the manifestation of God in them either in presence or power is not possible because the conditions which attend upon that manifestation are not there.
