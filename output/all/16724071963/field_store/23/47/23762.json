They are special witnesses of God and Christ to the truth of the gospel, and that is their special and peculiar calling in the Church. Not that the whole responsibility of preaching the gospel rests upon the Twelve and the Seventy alone. That responsibility rests upon the whole body of the Church. These quorums, the Twelve and Seventy, are merely the instrumentality through which the Church discharges its obligations to the people of the world in making known to them the truth.  7. _President Joseph F. Smith on the Calling of the Seventy:_ We have also in the Church today, I am informed, 146 quorums of Seventy [the number in 1904]. These constitute a body of Elders of somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 men, whose special duty it is to respond to the call of the Apostles to preach the gospel, without purse or scrip, to all the nations of the earth. They are minute men. It is expected that they will be ready, whenever they are called, to go out in the world, or to go out to the various organizations of the Church to fulfill missions and to perform such duties as shall be required of them, in order that the work of the Lord and the work of the ministry may be upheld and sustained and carried on in the Church and throughout the world. These councils or quorums of Seventy are not always full, a full council being 70 Elders. But there are approximately 10,000 Elders who now hold that position in the Church. They are called to an apostolic calling. They are required to be special witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is expected of this body of men that they will have burning in their souls the testimony of Jesus Christ, which is the spirit of prophecy; that they will be full of light and of the knowledge of the truth; that they will be enthusiastic in their calling, and in the cause of Zion, and that they will be ready at any moment, when required, to go out into the world, or anywhere throughout the Church and bear testimony of the truth, preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, and set examples before the world of purity, love, honesty, uprightness and integrity to the truth.

The distinction in the terms \"temporal\" and \"spiritual\" are used in connection with this subject that man may understand; that is, God adapts himself to man's terms, but with God there is no such distinction as temporal and spiritual, but all things are spiritual.

As on occasion the High Priests and Elders and members of the lesser Priesthood can be used to assist in the work of the foreign ministry (Doc. & Cov., Sec. 84:106-111), so also, when at home, and not engaged in the special work of their calling, the Seventy may be employed in the home ministry, and assist the standing ministry in the wards and stakes of Zion in perfecting the Saints and edifying the body of Christ until they shall all come unto a unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, \"unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\" Paul, in his most excellent description of the Church organization, likens it unto the body of a man. Accepting his illustration it may be said that the foreign ministry may be regarded as the right arm of the Church, and the home ministry as the left arm. Now, because one is the right arm and one the left, shall either refuse to assist the other at need? Or shall this organization (the Church), which is said to be the \"body of Christ,\" be as effectual in the performance of its functions as the natural body of man is, and in every case of need have the right hand come to the assistance of the left, and _vise versa_? Right reason will approve an affirmative answer.  2. _Power of the Melchisedek Priesthood:_ The Melchisedek Priesthood holds the right of Presidency, and has power and authority over all the offices in the Church in all ages of the world, to administer in spiritual things. The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchisedek, have a right to officiate in all the offices in the Church. High Priests after the order of the Melchisedek Priesthood, have a right to officiate in their own standing, under the direction of the Presidency, in administering spiritual things; and also in the office of an Elder, Priest, (of the Levitical order), Teacher, Deacon, and member. (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 106:8-10.)  While the statements here made about the higher officers of the Church administering in the lower offices--a High Priest officiating in the office of Elder, Priest, Teacher or Deacon--are limited to High Priests, yet the principle holds good as to Seventies also. Besides note the statement, \"The Melchisedek Priesthood holds the right of presidency and has power and authority over all the offices in the Church, in all ages of the world, to administer in spiritual things;\" and as the Seventy holds this Melchisedek Priesthood, he may, under the direction of the presidency (See Ibid verse 10), administer in any of the offices of the Church; also this has always been the practice of the Church; and the practice of the Church, generally speaking, is the best interpretation of the scripture.  3. _Organization of the Seventy._ The quorums of Seventy are organized with special reference to their calling as the foreign ministry of the Church. It will be observed that their organization is different from that of every other quorum in the Church, for whereas in all other quorums of the higher Priesthood the presidency consists of one president and two counselors, in the quorum of the Seventy there are seven presidents of equal power and authority. That is to say, there is not one president and six counselors, but each of the seven is a president and in power and authority is equal with his fellow-presidents; but for the sake of order the right of presidency is recognized as being vested in the senior president by ordination. \"And it is according to the vision, showing the order of the Seventy, that they should have seven presidents to preside over them, chosen out of the number of the Seventy. And the seventh president (counting from the one last ordained) of these presidents is to preside over the six.\" In the absence of the senior president the next senior in ordination becomes the acting president. By this simple arrangement all confusion as to the right of presiding is obviated, for no sooner does the council of a quorum or any part thereof convene, than each president knows at once upon whom the responsibility of presiding rests, let them meet where they may.  By virtue of having seven presidents a quorum "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60235"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, First Year (#8)"],["body","Seventy is not easily disorganized, and this doubtless was one of the objects in view in this arrangement. One, two, three, or even six of the presidents could be sent abroad upon missions (although that is not likely to be the case at any one time) and yet the quorum would have a president left, who, with the quorum, would be competent to transact whatever of business might be necessary for that quorum.  Other duties and advantages growing out of this organization are apparent on a little reflection. Suppose, for instance, that a quorum of Seventy should be sent out bodily to preach the gospel, as the quorum of the Twelve at times have been. You would then have an organization which could be broken up into seven groups of ten men each, with a president for each group. These groups could be broken up into five pairs, and the Elders travel two and two, as the law of the gospel requires. It can be readily seen that such a quorum could be a flying column, capable of being broken up, first into groups and sent into different districts; and the groups again broken up into pairs and spread out over a wide area of country. The pairs could be called together in groups of ten for conference, for adjustment and rearrangement of traveling companions, and the groups occasionally brought together in quorum conference, report, or transact whatever business might be necessary, and again be scattered into fields of labor. In all of which there appears the very finest adaptation of means to an end; and also there appears more than mere human wisdom displayed in this organization of the quorums of the foreign ministry.  4. _Of the First Quorum of the Seventy:_ In the revelation before quoted it is said: \"And it is according to the vision, showing the order of the Seventy, that they should have seven presidents to preside over them, chosen out of the number of the seventy. * * * And these seven presidents are to choose other Seventy besides the first Seventy, to whom they belong, and are to preside over them; and also other Seventy, until seven times seventy, if the labor in the vineyard of necessity requires it.\"  It must not be understood that this passage limits the number of quorums to seven times seventy, for the Prophet, at the time the quorums were being organized, stated that \"If the first Seventy are all employed and there is a call for more laborers, it will be the duty of the seven presidents of the first Seventy to call and ordain other Seventy, and send them forth to labor in the vineyard, until if needs be, they set apart seven times seventy, and even until there are 144,000 thus set apart for the ministry.\" (See Church History, Vol. II: 221 and Notes.)  It will be observed in the quotation from the Doctrine & Covenants above that provision is made that the presidents of Seventy are to be \"chosen out of the number of the Seventy.\" It is because of this special provision that when inadvertently High Priests have been selected for presidents of Seventy they have taken their place again in the quorum of High Priests and others from among the Seventy, as provided by the law of God, chosen to fill their place. It will also be observed that the council of the First Seventy, in addition to presiding over their own quorum (the first), have a general presidency over all the quorums of the Church. It is this first quorum, members and presidents together, which constitutes what, by way of explanation, we may call _the_ quorum of Seventy, the quorum of which it is said that they are equal in authority to the quorum of the twelve special witnesses, or Apostles.  5. _Summary._ It may be said by way of recapitulation that the Seventy hold the Melchisedek Priesthood; that with the Twelve, under whose directions they labor, they constitute the foreign ministry of the Church: that their special calling is to travel and preach the gospel in all nations, first to the Gentiles and then to the Jews; that they can, on occasion be employed in the work of the ministry at home, because their Priesthood authorizes them to do good and bring to pass righteousness wherever they may be, and when acting in order and under the direction of the Twelve Apostles they may do whatever is necessary to be done in order to accomplish the purposes of God, whose ministers they are; but their organization has particular reference to their special work of preaching the Gospel in all the world.  6. _An Intelligent and Informed Ministry Contemplated in the Church:_ After this brief review of the organization and duties of the Seventies, it must be clearly manifest that it is the imperative duty of those holding this office in the Priesthood to make careful and thorough preparation to discharge the responsibilities of their high calling as the ambassadors of the Lord Jesus. Being special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world, preachers (i. e., teachers) of the gospel, and authorized under the direction of the Twelve Apostles to act in the name of the Lord in \"building up the Church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. cvii), it behooves them to become witnesses who understand the truth of which they testify, skilled workman, ambassadors of whom the Master need not be ashamed. It is evident that the Lord never designed that his ministry should be an ignorant ministry; for to the early Elders of his Church, in this last dispensation, when instructing a number of them to prepare for labor in the vineyard, he said:      \"And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another     the doctrine of the kingdom; teach ye diligently and my grace shall     attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory,     in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things     that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you     to understand. Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and     under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things     which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things     which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations,     and the judgments which are on the land, and a knowledge also of     countries and of kingdoms. That ye may be prepared in all things     when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have     called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you. * *     * Therefore, verily, I say unto you, my friends, call your solemn     assembly, as I have commanded you; and as all have not faith, seek,     ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye     out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning even by study,     and also by faith.\" (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 88:77, 78, 80 and 117, 118.)  The instructions then given to the Elders of the Church are still applicable to men engaged in the same ministry, and charged with like responsibility.  Elsewhere I have said, on the foregoing passage from the Doctrine and Covenants:      \"I think I may safely challenge any one to point out a broader     field of knowledge than is here indicated. It includes     all spiritual truth, all scientific truth, all secular     knowledge--knowledge of the past, of the present, of the     future; of the heavens, and of the earth. A knowledge of all     countries, their geography, languages, history, customs, laws     and governments--everything in fact that pertains to them. There     is nothing in the heights above or the depths below that is not     included in this field of knowledge into which the commandment     of God directs his servants to enter. I may claim for it that     it includes the whole realm of man's intellectual activities.     And the doctrine that whatever principles of intelligence man     attains unto in this life will rise with him in the morning of     the resurrection--this doctrine that nothing acquired in respect     of knowledge is ever lost, must forever form the most powerful     incentive to intellectual effort that possibly can be conjured     up by the wit of man. So that, referring to the acquirement of     knowledge, and intellectual development, Mormonism at once both     indicates the broadest field and furnishes the grandest incentive     to intellectual effort.\" (\"The Mormon Point of View in Education,\"     Improvement Era, Vol. II, p. 119.)  Commenting once upon the above passages from the Doctrine and Covenants, the writer remarked:      \"I trust no one will receive the impression that I leave out of     consideration, or have not attached proper importance to the part     which the Spirit of God takes in these things (the preaching of     the gospel). I think there is no one with whom I am acquainted     that believes more fervently than I do that in order to succeed in     preaching the gospel one must do so by the gift and by the power of     the Holy Ghost. I know that the Lord has given instruction to the     Elders of the Church that separates their methods of work, as wide     as day is separated from the night, from those methods of preaching     adopted by the world--I know that he has said: \"Think not what     ye shall say, but in the very hour that it is needed it shall be     given to you that which you shall say.\" But while I remember that,     I remember also the admonition which he has given to the Elders in     the self same passage, to the effect that they should \"treasure up     continually the words of life,\" a part of the instruction that I     have sometimes thought is too much neglected. I believe we shall     best succeed if, when treasuring up the words of life, we do it     systematically; that instead of being like an unwise builder who     throws into one promiscuous heap lime, sand, bricks and frames,     together with a hundred and one other materials that enter into     the construction of his building, that each be placed by itself,     carefully stored away where the workmen can readily find it"]]]
