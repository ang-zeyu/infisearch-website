CHAPTER XI  A DRAFT    A draft is a written order from the first party to the second party to pay to the third party a certain sum of money at a certain time.  The first party is called the \"drawer.\"  The second party is the \"drawee.\"  The third party is the \"payee.\"  There are two kinds of draft.  The first is usually where the cashier of one bank, through his own check, draws on another bank for the cash difference in their accounts with each other.  The second form of draft is the most usual and is the one we shall here consider.  The cashier's draft is always for cash and the demand is always honored. The ordinary business draft may be for cash or for goods.  The business draft is usually honored, but there are circumstances under which it may be ignored.  TO MAKE A DRAFT  But let us suppose that the draft is all right and that a merchant, let us call him Henry Thomas, and suppose him a resident of Philadelphia, has a bill against James Taylor, of Cleveland, and he wants to collect it, without recourse to law. How will he go about it?  The bill is for $100.  Mr. Thomas writes this draft:       Philadelphia, Pa., Sept. 5, 1910.    At sight pay to the order of    Johnson National Bank of Philadelphia    One hundred................... dollars.                With exchange              and charge same to                           Henry Thomas.    To James Taylor,        Cleveland, Ohio.  Having drawn his draft, Mr. Thomas takes it to the Johnson National Bank for collection. The collection is actually made by some bank in Cleveland to which the Johnson has endorsed it over.  If Mr. Thomas wished he might have sent his draft direct to the Cleveland bank, but he no doubt thought it better to transact such matters through his own bank.  Or if Mr. Thomas lived where he was not in touch with a bank, he might have drawn through any person whom he knew in Cleveland.  On receiving the draft for collection, the Cleveland bank would at once give it to a clerk who would without delay present it to Mr. Taylor.  Mr. Taylor, having written his acceptance of the draft, is given three days grace in which to make payment.  In states where days of grace are not allowed, he would have to pay at once.  Mr. Taylor writes the word \"accepted,\" with the date and his name across the face of the draft, and if he does not pay cash, he states in the writing where payment will be made.  Of course, Mr. Taylor cannot be compelled to accept a draft. There may be good and honest reasons for his not doing so, but having accepted it, in business honor he is bound to pay it.  The term \"Sight draft\" explains itself, but the order to pay a draft may indicate, and often does, the number of days allowed for payment, after presentation.  FOR COLLECTION  What should be done by the man to whom a bill or a note is due, when the debtor lives in a place where there is no bank?  In that case he must learn in some way the name of a promising person to make the collection for him.  In this case he makes out the draft as before, and adds the words \"for collection.\" This acts as a bar to any transfer of the paper.  Most banks refuse to handle a draft marked \"for collection.\"  DISHONOR  Drafts are not necessarily duns.  Some country merchants prefer to pay their bills to wholesalers in that way, so that collecting drafts is no small part of the business of the ordinary bank.  While men are not compelled to meet drafts when presented, if the amount is due and he defaults or refuses to pay he injures his own credit.  In refusing a just draft he is said to \"dishonor\" it.  So sure are wholesalers that their drafts will be met by their distant debtors that they do not hesitate to draw against them when deposited for collection, regarding them as cash to their credit in bank.  PROTESTS  When a draft is not accepted or paid when due, if it be a time draft, it is protested in the same way as a note.  The protest of a draft serves as a notice to the drawer of its non-acceptance.  Like notes and checks, drafts may be transferred by a similar endorsement.  BUYING DRAFTS  If I wanted to pay a bill for $150 to Albert Holt, living at Wallace, Kansas, and did not wish to trouble him with a check, how would I go about it?  1. I might express the cash, which would be expensive. 2. I might send it in postal order, not always certain. 3. I might send it by a trusted hand, but might have long to wait before I found a friend going out to Wallace.  I am living in New York City, and am familiar enough with banking to know that New York is a great financial center and is in constant communication with nearly all the outside banks.  The outside banks keep money in deposit here, and the New York banks, particularly in the spring and autumn, keep deposits with their correspondents.  With my $150 and a small extra sum to pay my bank for drawing the draft, I go thither and buy a draft for the sum I owe Mr. Holt.  I mail this draft to my creditor and he can cash it without loss in his home bank. Here is the form:                                No. 101.     Madison National Bank of New York.   Pay to the order of Albert Holt,   One hundred and fifty dollars ($150.)...   ..........               L. N. Jones,                                  Cashier.   To Prairie National Bank,     Wallace, Kansas.  A GOOD PLAN  When you buy a draft which you mean to send off in payment of a debt, a good plan is to have it made payable to yourself.  Let us suppose it is the case of Albert Holt. You transfer the draft to him by writing across the back, \"Pay to the order of Albert Holt,\" and add your signature.  Now as all drafts are returned, as payment vouchers, to the banks from which they were issued, and as Mr. Holt must have signed the draft to get his money, it follows that there is a record of his having received it, and this has all the force of a receipt.  Do not endorse a draft with just your name, for in that case, anyone into whose hands it falls may collect. First write \"Pay to the order of\" the person for whom it is intended.  GOOD AS CASH  A draft made payable to yourself is as good as cash, and far safer to carry.  If you are identified at any bank between the Atlantic and Pacific, you can have your draft cashed.  All banks furnish blank drafts.  Never endorse a draft made payable to yourself, and this applies to a check, until you are about to use it.  It is a good plan never to sign your name until it is actually necessary.  Some people have the foolish habit of signing their names on stray bits of paper.  Do not get into this habit, even if there is no space to fill out a note or order above the signature.     CHAPTER XII  JUST MONEY    As has been before stated, money in its broadest meaning is a medium of exchange.  Anything that can pay a debt or purchase property, in any part of a country, is the money of that country.  Every civilized country has its own minted or printed money.  The usual mediums of circulation are gold, silver, nickel and copper, the latter alloyed more or less in the United States with nickel.  Government and bank bills, while having all the purchasing power of gold, are simply promises to pay in gold, or other coin of \"redemption\", the amounts they represent.  The money of one country cannot legally be made to pay a debt in another country, unless both parties to the payment agree to it.  When gold is exchanged to settle the balances of trade between two countries, it is not reckoned, if coined, at its face value, but at its bullion value.  The word \"pecunia\" meant in ancient Greece and Rome a flock or herd.  In those days live stock were used as a medium of exchange, or money.  We keep the word and often use it as in \"pecuniary\" affairs, and when we call a moneyless man, \"impecunious.\"  UNITED STATES MONEY  The United States Government reserves to itself the right under the constitution, to coin and issue the money to be used by its own people.  Formerly we had two standards of value, gold and silver, or bimetalism.  If gold and silver were produced in relatively equal quantities, the world would go on trading with money of both kinds, but the proportions are not the same.  Among the Aztecs and Peruvians silver ranked with gold as two to one, that is, two pounds of silver would purchase as much as one pound of gold.  But when great silver mines were discovered and new methods were discovered for extracting the metal, it became more and more abundant, till it depreciated far below the former value it had in its relation to gold.  Most of the commercial nations decided to have but one standard of value, and that gold, long before the United States fell into line.  Our money measure is known as the decimal, or metric. It would be convenient, if we could follow the example of nearly all the other commercial nations, and use the metric system for all our weights and measures.  OUR METAL MONEY  In the United States Treasury at Washington, there are many million dollars in silver coins and bullion.  The gold standard has not driven silver out of circulation, for it is still found convenient to use it in settling immediately our smaller business transactions.  When the silver dollar was first coined, and indeed up to the present date, the intention was that it should contain about a dollar's worth of silver, or 374 1/4 Troy grains of the pure metal. This amount of silver was supposed to represent permanently 24 3/4 grains of pure gold, and it did so represent its value at one time, and would have continued to do so, had the relative output of both metals been the same.  Our chief mint is in Philadelphia, where is coined all the copper, nickel, silver, and gold money in use.  To imitate these metals, even where the full value is given, constitutes the criminal offence called \"counterfeiting.\"  In former times, some of our older readers will remember them, the Government meant to have the metal in each coin of about its unstamped value in the market.

FIFTY FAMOUS PEOPLE  A BOOK OF SHORT STORIES  BY JAMES BALDWIN      PREFATORY NOTE    One of the best things to be said of the stories in this volume is that, although they are not biographical, they are about real persons who actually lived and performed their parts in the great drama of the world's history. Some of these persons were more famous than others, yet all have left enduring \"footprints on the sands of time\" and their names will not cease to be remembered. In each of the stories there is a basis of truth and an ethical lesson which cannot fail to have a wholesome influence; and each possesses elements of interest which, it is believed, will go far towards proving the fallibility of the doctrine that children find delight only in tales of the imaginative and unreal. The fact that there are a few more than fifty famous people mentioned in the volume may be credited to the author's wish to give good measure.

THE GOLDEN TRIPOD     SAVING THE BIRDS    One day in spring four men were riding on horseback along a country road. These men were lawyers, and they were going to the next town to attend court.  There had been a rain, and the ground was very soft. Water was dripping from the trees, and the grass was wet.  The four lawyers rode along, one behind another; for the pathway was narrow, and the mud on each side of it was deep. They rode slowly, and talked and laughed and were very jolly.  As they were passing through a grove of small trees, they heard a great fluttering over their heads and a feeble chirping in the grass by the roadside.  \"Stith! stith! stith!\" came from the leafy branches above them.  \"Cheep! cheep! cheep!\" came from the wet grass.  \"What is the matter here?\" asked the first lawyer, whose name was Speed. \"Oh, it's only some old robins!\" said the second lawyer, whose name was Hardin. \"The storm has blown two of the little ones out of the nest. They are too young to fly, and the mother bird is making a great fuss about it.\"  \"What a pity! They'll die down there in the grass,\" said the third lawyer, whose name I forget.  \"Oh, well! They're nothing but birds,\" said Mr. Hardin. \"Why should we bother?\"  \"Yes, why should we?\" said Mr. Speed.  The three men, as they passed, looked down and saw the little birds fluttering in the cold, wet grass. They saw the mother robin flying about, and crying to her mate.  Then they rode on, talking and laughing as before. In a few minutes they had forgotten about the birds.  But the fourth lawyer, whose name was Abraham Lincoln, stopped. He got down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big warm hands.  They did not seem frightened, but chirped softly, as if they knew they were safe.  \"Never mind, my little fellows,\" said Mr. Lincoln \"I will put you in your own cozy little bed.\"  [Illustration]  Then he looked up to find the nest from which they had fallen. It was high, much higher than he could reach.  But Mr. Lincoln could climb. He had climbed many a tree when he was a boy. He put the birds softly, one by one, into their warm little home. Two other baby birds were there, that had not fallen out. All cuddled down together and were very happy.  Soon the three lawyers who had ridden ahead stopped at a spring to give their horses water.  \"Where is Lincoln?\" asked one.  All were surprised to find that he was not with them.  \"Do you remember those birds?\" said Mr. Speed. \"Very likely he has stopped to take care of them.\"  In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln joined them. His shoes were covered with mud; he had torn his coat on the thorny tree.  \"Hello, Abraham!\" said Mr. Hardin. \"Where have you been?\"  \"I stopped a minute to give those birds to their mother,\" he answered.  \"Well, we always thought you were a hero,\" said Mr. Speed. \"Now we know it.\"  Then all three of them laughed heartily. They thought it so foolish that a strong man should take so much trouble just for some worthless young birds.  \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"I could not have slept to-night, if I had left those helpless little robins to perish in the wet grass.\"  Abraham Lincoln afterwards became very famous as a lawyer and statesman. He was elected president. Next to Washington he was the greatest American.    ANOTHER BIRD STORY    A great battle had begun. Cannon were booming, some far away, some near at hand. Soldiers were marching through the fields. Men on horseback were riding in haste toward the front.  \"Whiz!\" A cannon ball struck the ground quite near to a company of soldiers. But they marched straight onward. The drums were beating, the fifes were playing.  \"Whiz!\" Another cannon ball flew through the air and struck a tree near by. A brave general was riding across the field. One ball after another came whizzing near him.  \"General, you are in danger here,\" said an officer who was riding with him. \"You had better fall back to a place of safety.\"  [Illustration]  But the general rode on.  Suddenly he stopped at the foot of a tree. \"Halt!\" he cried to the men who were with him. He leaped from his horse. He stooped and picked up a bird's nest that had fallen upon the ground. In the nest were some tiny, half-fledged birds. Their mouths were open for the food they were expecting their mother to give them.  \"I cannot think of leaving these little things here to be trampled upon,\" said the general.  He lifted the nest gently and put it in a safe place in the forks of the tree.  \"Whiz!\" Another cannon ball.  He leaped into the saddle, and away he dashed with his officers close behind him.  \"Whiz! whiz! whiz!\"  He had done one good deed. He would do many more before the war was over. \"Boom! boom! boom!\"  The cannon were roaring, the balls were flying, the battle was raging. But amid all the turmoil and danger, the little birds chirped happily in the safe shelter where the great general, Robert E. Lee, had placed them. \"He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all.\"     SPEAKING A PIECE    Two children, brother and sister, were on their way to school. Both were very small. The boy was only four years old, and the girl was not yet six. \"Come, Edward, we must hurry,\" said the sister. \"We must not be late.\" With one hand the little boy clung to his sister's arm, and with the other he held his primer.  This primer was his only book, and he loved it. It had a bright blue cover, which he was careful not to soil. And in it were some odd little pictures, which he never grew tired of looking at.  Edward could spell nearly all the words in his primer, and he could read quite well.  The school was more than a mile from their home, and the children trotted along as fast as their short legs could carry them.  At a place where two roads crossed, they saw a tall gentleman coming to meet them. He was dressed in black, and had a very pleasant face.  \"Oh, Edward, there is Mr. Harris!\" whispered the little girl. \"Don't forget your manners.\"  They were glad to see Mr. Harris, for he was the minister. They stopped by the side of the road and made their manners. Edward bowed very gracefully, and his sister curtsied.  \"Good morning, children!\" said the minister; and he kindly shook hands with both.  [Illustration]  \"I have something here for little Edward,\" he said. Then he took from his pocket a sheet of paper on which some verses were written.  \"See! It is a little speech that I have written for him. The teacher will soon ask him to speak a piece at school, and I am sure that he can learn this easily and speak it well\"  Edward took the paper and thanked the kind minister.  \"Mother will help him learn it,\" said his sister.  \"Yes, I will try to learn it,\" said Edward.  \"Do so, my child,\" said the Minister; \"and I hope that when you grow up you will become a wise man and a great orator.\"  Then the two children hurried on to school.  The speech was not hard to learn, and Edward soon knew every word of it. When the time came for him to speak, his mother and the minister were both there to hear him.  He spoke so well that everybody was pleased. He pronounced every word plainly, as though he were talking to his schoolmates.  Would you like to read his speech? Here it is:--        Pray, how shall I, a little lad,       In speaking make a figure?       You're only joking, I'm afraid--       Just wait till I am bigger.        But since you wish to hear my part,       And urge me to begin it,       I'll strive for praise with all my heart,       Though small the hope to win it.         I'll tell a tale how Farmer John       A little roan colt bred, sir,       Which every night and every morn       He watered and he fed, sir.        Said Neighbor Joe to Farmer John,       \"You surely are a dolt, sir,       To spend such time and care upon       A little useless colt, sir.\"        Said"]]]
