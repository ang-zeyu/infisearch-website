So the march was resumed at three o'clock in the morning.  Merritt's cavalry had struck the enemy at Deep Creek, and driven them north to the Appomattox, where, I presume, most of them were forced to cross.  On the morning of the 4th I learned that Lee had ordered rations up from Danville for his famishing army, and that they were to meet him at Farmville.  This showed that Lee had already abandoned the idea of following the railroad down to Danville, but had determined to go farther west, by the way of Farmville.  I notified Sheridan of this and directed him to get possession of the road before the supplies could reach Lee.  He responded that he had already sent Crook's division to get upon the road between Burkesville and Jetersville, then to face north and march along the road upon the latter place; and he thought Crook must be there now.  The bulk of the army moved directly for Jetersville by two roads.  After I had received the dispatch from Sheridan saying that Crook was on the Danville Road, I immediately ordered Meade to make a forced march with the Army of the Potomac, and to send Parke's corps across from the road they were on to the South Side Railroad, to fall in the rear of the Army of the James and to protect the railroad which that army was repairing as it went along.  Our troops took possession of Jetersville and in the telegraph office, they found a dispatch from Lee, ordering two hundred thousand rations from Danville.  The dispatch had not been sent, but Sheridan sent a special messenger with it to Burkesville and had it forwarded from there.  In the meantime, however, dispatches from other sources had reached Danville, and they knew there that our army was on the line of the road; so that they sent no further supplies from that quarter.  At this time Merritt and Mackenzie, with the cavalry, were off between the road which the Army of the Potomac was marching on and the Appomattox River, and were attacking the enemy in flank.  They picked up a great many prisoners and forced the abandonment of some property.  Lee intrenched himself at Amelia Court House, and also his advance north of Jetersville, and sent his troops out to collect forage.  The country was very poor and afforded but very little.  His foragers scattered a great deal; many of them were picked up by our men, and many others never returned to the Army of Northern Virginia.  Griffin's corps was intrenched across the railroad south of Jetersville, and Sheridan notified me of the situation.  I again ordered Meade up with all dispatch, Sheridan having but the one corps of infantry with a little cavalry confronting Lee's entire army.  Meade, always prompt in obeying orders, now pushed forward with great energy, although he was himself sick and hardly able to be out of bed.  Humphreys moved at two, and Wright at three o'clock in the morning, without rations, as I have said, the wagons being far in the rear.  I stayed that night at Wilson's Station on the South Side Railroad.  On the morning of the 5th I sent word to Sheridan of the progress Meade was making, and suggested that he might now attack Lee.  We had now no other objective than the Confederate armies, and I was anxious to close the thing up at once.  On the 5th I marched again with Ord's command until within about ten miles of Burkesville, where I stopped to let his army pass. I then received from Sheridan the following dispatch:  \"The whole of Lee's army is at or near Amelia Court House, and on this side of it.  General Davies, whom I sent out to Painesville on their right flank, has just captured six pieces of artillery and some wagons. We can capture the Army of Northern Virginia if force enough can be thrown to this point, and then advance upon it.  My cavalry was at Burkesville yesterday, and six miles beyond, on the Danville Road, last night.  General Lee is at Amelia Court House in person.  They are out of rations, or nearly so.  They were advancing up the railroad towards Burkesville yesterday, when we intercepted them at this point.\"  It now became a life and death struggle with Lee to get south to his provisions.  Sheridan, thinking the enemy might turn off immediately towards Farmville, moved Davies's brigade of cavalry out to watch him. Davies found the movement had already commenced.  He attacked and drove away their cavalry which was escorting wagons to the west, capturing and burning 180 wagons.  He also captured five pieces of artillery.  The Confederate infantry then moved against him and probably would have handled him very roughly, but Sheridan had sent two more brigades of cavalry to follow Davies, and they came to his relief in time.  A sharp engagement took place between these three brigades of cavalry and the enemy's infantry, but the latter was repulsed.  Meade himself reached Jetersville about two o'clock in the afternoon, but in advance of all his troops.  The head of Humphreys's corps followed in about an hour afterwards. Sheridan stationed the troops as they came up, at Meade's request, the latter still being very sick.  He extended two divisions of this corps off to the west of the road to the left of Griffin's corps, and one division to the right.  The cavalry by this time had also come up, and they were put still farther off to the left, Sheridan feeling certain that there lay the route by which the enemy intended to escape.  He wanted to attack, feeling that if time was given, the enemy would get away; but Meade prevented this, preferring to wait till his troops were all up.  At this juncture Sheridan sent me a letter which had been handed to him by a colored man, with a note from himself saying that he wished I was there myself.  The letter was dated Amelia Court House, April 5th, and signed by Colonel Taylor.  It was to his mother, and showed the demoralization of the Confederate army. Sheridan's note also gave me the information as here related of the movements of that day.  I received a second message from Sheridan on the 5th, in which he urged more emphatically the importance of my presence.  This was brought to me by a scout in gray uniform.  It was written on tissue paper, and wrapped up in tin-foil such as chewing tobacco is folded in.  This was a precaution taken so that if the scout should be captured he could take this tin-foil out of his pocket and putting it into his mouth, chew it.  It would cause no surprise at all to see a Confederate soldier chewing tobacco. It was nearly night when this letter was received.  I gave Ord directions to continue his march to Burkesville and there intrench himself for the night, and in the morning to move west to cut off all the roads between there and Farmville.  I then started with a few of my staff and a very small escort of cavalry, going directly through the woods, to join Meade's army.  The distance was about sixteen miles; but the night being dark our progress was slow through the woods in the absence of direct roads.  However, we got to the outposts about ten o'clock in the evening, and after some little parley convinced the sentinels of our identity and were conducted in to where Sheridan was bivouacked.  We talked over the situation for some little time, Sheridan explaining to me what he thought Lee was trying to do, and that Meade's orders, if carried out, moving to the right flank, would give him the coveted opportunity of escaping us and putting us in rear of him.  We then together visited Meade, reaching his headquarters about midnight.  I explained to Meade that we did not want to follow the enemy; we wanted to get ahead of him, and that his orders would allow the enemy to escape, and besides that, I had no doubt that Lee was moving right then.  Meade changed his orders at once.  They were now given for an advance on Amelia Court House, at an early hour in the morning, as the army then lay; that is, the infantry being across the railroad, most of it to the west of the road, with the cavalry swung out still farther to the left.    CHAPTER LXVI.  BATTLE OF SAILOR'S CREEK--ENGAGEMENT AT FARMVILLE--CORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL LEE--SHERIDAN INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY.  The Appomattox, going westward, takes a long sweep to the south-west from the neighborhood of the Richmond and Danville Railroad bridge, and then trends north-westerly.  Sailor's Creek, an insignificant stream, running northward, empties into the Appomattox between the High Bridge and Jetersville.  Near the High Bridge the stage road from Petersburg to Lynchburg crosses the Appomattox River, also on a bridge.  The railroad runs on the north side of the river to Farmville, a few miles west, and from there, recrossing, continues on the south side of it.  The roads coming up from the south-east to Farmville cross the Appomattox River there on a bridge and run on the north side, leaving the Lynchburg and Petersburg Railroad well to the left.  Lee, in pushing out from Amelia Court House, availed himself of all the roads between the Danville Road and Appomattox River to move upon, and never permitted the head of his columns to stop because of any fighting that might be going on in his rear.  In this way he came very near succeeding in getting to his provision trains and eluding us with at least part of his army.  As expected, Lee's troops had moved during the night before, and our army in moving upon Amelia Court House soon encountered them.  There was a good deal of fighting before Sailor's Creek was reached.  Our cavalry charged in upon a body of theirs which was escorting a wagon train in order to get it past our left.  A severe engagement ensued, in which we captured many prisoners, and many men also were killed and wounded. There was as much gallantry displayed by some of the Confederates in these little engagements as was displayed at any time during the war, notwithstanding the sad"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5868"],["title","Nothing to Eat (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team         NOTHING TO EAT  By Horatio Alger and Thomas Chandler Haliburton  Illustrated.

Not by the Author of “Nothing to Wear.”      The Argument      THOUGH famine prevails not at all in the city;    Though none of starvation have died in the street;    Yet many there are now exciting our pity,    Who're daily complaining of nothing to eat.     The every-day cry and the every-day fare,    That's every day heard where the Livewells are dining,    Is nothing to eat, or else nothing to wear,    Which naked and starving rich Merdles are whining.     There's Kitty Malone--Mrs. Merdle 'tis now--    Was ever on earth here before such a sinner;    Protesting, excusing and swearing a vow,    She'd nothing worth eating to give us for dinner.     Why Kitty, if starving for want of a meal,    And had'nt a cent in the world to buy meat,    You wouldn't exclaim with a more pious zeal,    “I'm dying of hunger--we've nothing to eat!!”     The Proof--the Queen of Fashion      The point I advance, if it need confirmation,    I'll prove by a witness that few will dispute,    A pink of perfection and truth in the naion    Where fashion and folly are all of a suit.     'Tis “Merdle the banker”--or rather his wife,    Whose fashion, religion, or music, or dress,    Is followed, consulted, by many through life,    As pilots are followed by ships in distress;    For money's a pilot, a master, a king,    Which men follow blindly through quicksands and shoals,    Where pilots their ships in a moment might fling    To destruction the vessel and cargo and souls.     'Twas money made Kitty of fashion the queen,    And fortune oft lends queens the scepter;    So fortune and fashion with this one we've seen    Her money and fortune in fashion has kept her;    While slaves of the queen with her hoops rules the day,    Expanding their utmost extent of expansion,    And mandates of fashion most freely obey,    And would if it bid all their souls to extinction.     The Object aimed at.      But what “lady patron” as queen holds the sway;    Or sweeping, whose hoops in the street are most sweeping;    The burthen is not of this truth-telling lay,    That should in its reading the world set to weeping,    While telling the suff'rings from head to the feet,    Of poor human beings with _nothing to eat_.     What another Poet did.      Another expounder of life's thorny mazes    Excited our pity at fortune's hard fare,    And troubled the city's most troublesome places,    While singing his ditty of “Nothing to Wear.”     “A tale worth the telling,”' though I tell for the same,    Great objects of pity we see in the street,    “With nothing to wear, though a legion by name,    Is not to buy clothing, but something to eat.     How the Author sometimes Dines.      And now by your leave I will try to expound it,    In truth as it is and the way that I found it.     My dinner, sometimes, like things transcendental    And things more substantial, like women and wine    A thing is, uncertain, and quite accidental,    And sometimes I wonder, “Oh! where shall I dine?”     It was when reflecting one evening of late,    What tavern or hotel or dining-room skinner,    With table cloth dirty and dirtier plate,    Would give me a nausea and call it a dinner,    I met with Jack Merdle, a name fully known    As good for a million in Stock-gamblers' Street,    Where none but a nabob or forger high flown    With “bulls” or with “bears” need look for a seat.     Merdle the Banker.      Now Merdle this day having toss'd with his horns    The bears that were pulling so hard at the stocks,    And gored every bull that was treading his corns,    Had lined all his pockets with “plenty of rocks,”     And home now was driving at “two forty” speed,    Where dinner was waiting--“a jolly good feed.”     Himself feeling happy, he knew by my looks,    A case full of sadness and deep destitution    Was present in person, not read of in books,    Appealing in pity for an alms institution.     Places Where Mortals Dine.      The case, too, was urgent, for there stood a sinner,    Whose fate hung on chance--a chance for his dinner;    A chance for all mortals, with truth I assert,    Who eat where his chance was, to counteract fate,    “To eat during life each a peck of pure dirt”     By eating at once the whole peck from one plate.    For true when I think of the places we eat at,    Or rather the places by hunger when driven    We rush in and swallow our bread and our meat at,    A bushel good measure in life will be given    To those who are living a “boarding-house life,”     Or those who are driven by fortune to journey,    And eat when we must with so dirty a knife,    I wish't could be done by the power of attorney;    Or where you must eat in a place called “saloon;”     Or “coffee-house” synonym of whisky and rum;    (I wish all the breed were sent off to the moon,    And earth was well clear of the coffee-house scum;)    Or where “Restauration” hangs out for sign,    At bar-room or cellar or dirty back room,    Where dishcloths for napkins are thought extra fine,    And table cloths look as though washed with a broom;    Where knives waiters spit on and wipe on their sleeves,    And plates needing polish, with coat tails are cleaned;    Where priests dine with harlots, and judges with thieves,    And mayors with villains his worship has screened.     [ILLUSTRATION: “WHERE KNIVES WAITERS SPIT ON AND WIPE ON THEIR    SLEEVES, AND PLATES NEEDING POLISH, WITH COAT TAILS ARE CLEANED.”]     Things That Mortals Eat There.      And what do you eat in the mess there compounded?    For roast beef, the gravy the soap-man should claim--    The soup some odd things might turn up if sounded,    And other “made-dishes” might turn up the same.     Decoctions that puzzle your chemical skill,    You get if you call either coffee or tea;    And milk that is made with and tastes of the swill,    As like milk, as wine is that often we see    Is like to the juice of the grape in perfection,    Or like as the candidate after election    Is like the fair thing that we hoped or expected    Before the base thief was exposed or detected;    As like truth and virtue--and more is the pity--    The men we elected to rule our own city.     In “council” while sitting, though “common” we call them,    In common opinion, if people at large    Are's common in morals, no worse could befal 'em    If Satan should take them at once in his charge.     If food as their filth was as plenty for diet,    No lack would they feel of the coveted cash,    Or power they maintain with the power of a riot,    When heads of opponents are served up as hash    By Star-chamber cooks of the club “restoration,”     That rules now the city and would rule the nation,    If “Sachems” were willing the “Wigwam” to yield,    And give the arch-traitor a fair fighting field.
