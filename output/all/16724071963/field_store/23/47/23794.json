To my inquiries relative to Ja they explained that he had not been in the village when our signals were heard, but that runners had been sent out after him and that doubtless he was already upon his way to the coast.  One of the men remembered me from the occasion of my former visit to the island; he was extremely agree-able the moment that he came close enough to recognize me. He said that Ja would be delighted to welcome me, and that all the tribe of Anoroc knew of me by repute, and had received explicit instructions from their chieftain that if any of them should ever come upon me to show me every kindness and attention.  Upon shore we were received with equal honor.  While we stood conversing with our bronze friends a tall warrior leaped suddenly from the jungle.  It was Ja.  As his eyes fell upon me his face lighted with pleasure. He came quickly forward to greet me after the manner of his tribe.  Toward Perry he was equally hospitable.  The old man fell in love with the savage giant as completely as had I. Ja conducted us along the maze-like trail to his strange village, where he gave over one of the tree-houses for our exclusive use.  Perry was much interested in the unique habitation, which resembled nothing so much as a huge wasp's nest built around the bole of a tree well above the ground.  After we had eaten and rested Ja came to see us with a number of his head men.  They listened attentively to my story, which included a narrative of the events leading to the formation of the federated kingdoms, the battle with the Mahars, my journey to the outer world, and my return to Pellucidar and search for Sari and my mate.  Ja told me that the Mezops had heard something of the federation and had been much interested in it.  He had even gone so far as to send a party of warriors toward Sari to investigate the reports, and to arrange for the entrance of Anoroc into the empire in case it appeared that there was any truth in the rumors that one of the aims of the federation was the overthrow of the Mahars.  The delegation had met with a party of Sagoths.  As there had been a truce between the Mahars and the Mezops for many generations, they camped with these warriors of the reptiles, from whom they learned that the federation had gone to pieces.  So the party returned to Anoroc.  When I showed Ja our map and explained its purpose to him, he was much interested.  The location of Anoroc, the Mountains of the Clouds, the river, and the strip of seacoast were all familiar to him.  He quickly indicated the position of the inland sea and close beside it, the city of Phutra, where one of the powerful Mahar nations had its seat.  He likewise showed us where Sari should be and carried his own coast-line as far north and south as it was known to him.  His additions to the map convinced us that Greenwich lay upon the verge of this same sea, and that it might be reached by water more easily than by the arduous crossing of the mountains or the dangerous approach through Phutra, which lay almost directly in line between Anoroc and Greenwich to the northwest.  If Sari lay upon the same water then the shore-line must bend far back toward the southwest of Greenwich--an assumption which, by the way, we found later to be true.  Also, Sari was upon a lofty plateau at the southern end of a mighty gulf of the Great Ocean.  The location which Ja gave to distant Amoz puzzled us, for it placed it due north of Greenwich, apparently in mid-ocean.  As Ja had never been so far and knew only of Amoz through hearsay, we thought that he must be mistaken; but he was not.  Amoz lies directly north of Greenwich across the mouth of the same gulf as that upon which Sari is.  The sense of direction and location of these primitive Pellucidarians is little short of uncanny, as I have had occasion to remark in the past.  You may take one of them to the uttermost ends of his world, to places of which he has never even heard, yet without sun or moon or stars to guide him, without map or compass, he will travel straight for home in the shortest direction.  Mountains, rivers, and seas may have to be gone around, but never once does his sense of direction fail him--the homing instinct is supreme.  In the same remarkable way they never forget the location of any place to which they have ever been, and know that of many of which they have only heard from others who have visited them.  In short, each Pellucidarian is a walking geography of his own district and of much of the country contiguous thereto.  It always proved of the greatest aid to Perry and me; nevertheless we were anxious to enlarge our map, for we at least were not endowed with the homing instinct.  After several long councils it was decided that, in order to expedite matters, Perry should return to the prospector with a strong party of Mezops and fetch the freight I had brought from the outer world.  Ja and his warriors were much impressed by our firearms, and were also anxious to build boats with sails.  As we had arms at the prospector and also books on boat-building we thought that it might prove an excellent idea to start these naturally maritime people upon the construction of a well built navy of staunch sailing-vessels.  I was sure that with definite plans to go by Perry could oversee the construction of an adequate flotilla.  I warned him, however, not to be too ambitious, and to forget about dreadnoughts and armored cruisers for a while and build instead a few small sailing-boats that could be manned by four or five men.  I was to proceed to Sari, and while prosecuting my search for Dian attempt at the same time the rehabilitation of the federation.  Perry was going as far as possible by water, with the chances that the entire trip might be made in that manner, which proved to be the fact.  With a couple of Mezops as companions I started for Sari.  In order to avoid crossing the principal range of the Mountains of the Clouds we took a route that passed a little way south of Phutra.  We had eaten four times and slept once, and were, as my companions told me, not far from the great Mahar city, when we were suddenly confronted by a considerable band of Sagoths.  They did not attack us, owing to the peace which exists between the Mahars and the Mezops, but I could see that they looked upon me with considerable suspicion.  My friends told them that I was a stranger from a remote country, and as we had previously planned against such a contingency I pretended ignorance of the language which the human beings of Pellucidar employ in conversing with the gorilla-like soldiery of the Mahars.  I noticed, and not without misgivings, that the leader of the Sagoths eyed me with an expression that betokened partial recognition.  I was sure that he had seen me before during the period of my incarceration in Phutra and that he was trying to recall my identity.  It worried me not a little.  I was extremely thankful when we bade them adieu and continued upon our journey.  Several times during the next few marches I became acutely conscious of the sensation of being watched by unseen eyes, but I did not speak of my suspicions to my companions.  Later I had reason to regret my reticence, for--  Well, this is how it happened:  We had killed an antelope and after eating our fill I had lain down to sleep.  The Pellucidarians, who seem seldom if ever to require sleep, joined me in this instance, for we had had a very trying march along the northern foothills of the Mountains of the Clouds, and now with their bellies filled with meat they seemed ready for slumber.  When I awoke it was with a start to find a couple of huge Sagoths astride me.  They pinioned my arms and legs, and later chained my wrists behind my back.  Then they let me up.  I saw my companions; the brave fellows lay dead where they had slept, javelined to death without a chance at self-defense.  I was furious.  I threatened the Sagoth leader with all sorts of dire reprisals; but when he heard me speak the hybrid language that is the medium of communication between his kind and the human race of the inner world he only grinned, as much as to say, \"I thought so!\"  They had not taken my revolvers or ammunition away from me because they did not know what they were; but my heavy rifle I had lost.  They simply left it where it had lain beside me.  So low in the scale of intelligence are they, that they had not sufficient interest in this strange object even to fetch it along with them.  I knew from the direction of our march that they were taking me to Phutra.  Once there I did not need much of an imagination to picture what my fate would be. It was the arena and a wild thag or fierce tarag for me--unless the Mahars elected to take me to the pits.  In that case my end would be no more certain, though infinitely more horrible and painful, for in the pits I should be subjected to cruel vivisection.  From what I had once seen of their methods in the pits of Phutra I knew them to be the opposite of merciful, whereas in the arena I should be quickly despatched by some savage beast.  Arrived at the underground city, I was taken immediately before a slimy Mahar.  When the creature had received the report of the Sagoth its cold eyes glistened with malice and hatred as they were turned balefully upon me.  I knew then that my identity had been guessed.  With a show of excitement that I had never before seen evinced by a member of the dominant race of Pellucidar, the Mahar hustled me away, heavily guarded, through the main avenue of the city to one of the principal buildings.  Here we were ushered into a great hall where presently many Mahars gathered.  In utter silence they conversed, for they have no oral speech since they are without auditory nerves.  Their method of communication Perry has likened to the projection of a sixth sense into a fourth dimension, where it becomes cognizable to the sixth sense of their audience."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6050"],["title","The Roots of the Mountains (#0)"],["body","from the 1896 Longmans, Green, and Co. edition by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org                              THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS                        WHEREIN IS TOLD SOMEWHAT OF                       THE LIVES OF THE MEN OF BURG-                          DALE THEIR FRIENDS THEIR                        NEIGHBOURS THEIR FOEMEN AND                           THEIR FELLOWS IN ARMS                               BY WILLIAM MORRIS     Whiles carried o’er the iron road,    We hurry by some fair abode;    The garden bright amidst the hay,    The yellow wain upon the way,    The dining men, the wind that sweeps    Light locks from off the sun-sweet heaps—    The gable grey, the hoary roof,    Here now—and now so far aloof.

OF BURGSTEAD AND ITS FOLK AND ITS NEIGHBOURS.   ONCE upon a time amidst the mountains and hills and falling streams of a fair land there was a town or thorp in a certain valley.  This was well-nigh encompassed by a wall of sheer cliffs; toward the East and the great mountains they drew together till they went near to meet, and left but a narrow path on either side of a stony stream that came rattling down into the Dale: toward the river at that end the hills lowered somewhat, though they still ended in sheer rocks; but up from it, and more especially on the north side, they swelled into great shoulders of land, then dipped a little, and rose again into the sides of huge fells clad with pine-woods, and cleft here and there by deep ghylls: thence again they rose higher and steeper, and ever higher till they drew dark and naked out of the woods to meet the snow-fields and ice-rivers of the high mountains.  But that was far away from the pass by the little river into the valley; and the said river was no drain from the snow-fields white and thick with the grinding of the ice, but clear and bright were its waters that came from wells amidst the bare rocky heaths.  The upper end of the valley, where it first began to open out from the pass, was rugged and broken by rocks and ridges of water-borne stones, but presently it smoothed itself into mere grassy swellings and knolls, and at last into a fair and fertile plain swelling up into a green wave, as it were, against the rock-wall which encompassed it on all sides save where the river came gushing out of the strait pass at the east end, and where at the west end it poured itself out of the Dale toward the lowlands and the plain of the great river.  Now the valley was some ten miles of our measure from that place of the rocks and the stone-ridges, to where the faces of the hills drew somewhat anigh to the river again at the west, and then fell aback along the edge of the great plain; like as when ye fare a-sailing past two nesses of a river-mouth, and the main-sea lieth open before you.  Besides the river afore-mentioned, which men called the Weltering Water, there were other waters in the Dale.  Near the eastern pass, entangled in the rocky ground was a deep tarn full of cold springs and about two acres in measure, and therefrom ran a stream which fell into the Weltering Water amidst the grassy knolls.  Black seemed the waters of that tarn which on one side washed the rocks-wall of the Dale; ugly and aweful it seemed to men, and none knew what lay beneath its waters save black mis-shapen trouts that few cared to bring to net or angle: and it was called the Death-Tarn.  Other waters yet there were: here and there from the hills on both sides, but especially from the south side, came trickles of water that ran in pretty brooks down to the river; and some of these sprang bubbling up amidst the foot-mounds of the sheer-roc"]]]
