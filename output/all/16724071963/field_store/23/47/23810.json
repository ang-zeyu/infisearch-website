H. ROBERTS  Of the First Council of The Seventy   _\"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the Only True God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou has sent.\"--Jesus._  _\"It is the First Principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God.\"--Joseph Smith._   Salt Lake City  1910    _SEVENTY'S YEAR BOOK NO. III._  _INTRODUCTION._  The Seventy's Course in Theology, Third Year, treats directly of the Doctrine of Deity. In structure and treatment of the theme, it follows the general plan of the First and Second Year Books. Therefore what was said in the Introduction to the First Year Book to \"Class Teachers;\" and on the \"Manner of Lesson Treatment;\" \"Home Reading and Preparation;\" \"Scripture Reading and Special Texts;\" and on \"Lectures,\" will be available here. As quite a number of the Quorum members will not have First and Second Year Books, it is recommended that the Presidents or Class Teachers bring the suggestions under the above headings to the attention of the classes, and read them in class. An entire class session indeed, could be well spent in consideration of methods of work.  One modification only is suggested in methods of work. Where the Seventies meet in classes that are only fragments of quorums, in instances where the number of meetings does not average more than from three to six or eight, it is thought that better results would be obtained if such a class would convert the occasion into a lesson-study meeting, for three lessons in the month, and instead of trying to deliver the lesson statement in lecture form, remain seated around the table and read the lesson, hunt up the citations given, and discuss the notes--in a word study the lesson together and profit by each other's assistance. Then, on the fourth lesson of the month--when the Seventies are supposed to meet in quorum capacity, the usual quorum methods could be followed.  _The importance of the Subject, \"The Doctrine of Deity:\"_ Of the importance of the subject treated in this present Year Book, but little need be said, as its importance is largely self-evident; but to minds that do not so conceive it, perhaps its importance will be made apparent by such expressions as these:  _\"This is life eternal that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\"--Jesus, the Christ_.  _\"It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the Character of God; and to know that we may converse with Him as one man converses with another.\"--Joseph Smith, the Prophet_.  Far be it from me to hold that faith in God, and participation in salvation, depends upon a scientific knowledge of the being, and the kind of being, God is. The Soul of man, self-conscious of the being of God, and enlightened, if only in a general way--in a way far from what would be regarded as well-arranged knowledge--may yet have faith in God. So that I am not holding that the very definite knowledge we are seeking through this treatise, is necessary to first steps in what must always be a progressive faith. I do not address the men for whom these Lessons are prepared from the standpoint that I would have them understand in order that they may believe; but rather that they may understand--as clearly as I can help them to understand--that which they already believe. Also that they may more distinctly teach that which they believe, for surely well-ordered knowledge can have no other effect upon faith than to increase it, to strengthen it.  In any event it would be neglect of duty in men if, after coming to belief, they did not study to understand what they believe. It would be doubly a neglect of duty on the part of men who are consecrated by solemn ordination to teach the true doctrine about God, and stand as Witness for him, if they should be indifferent to an understanding of the nature and character of God. The pleas that are sometimes made on the ground of incomprehensibility of the subject, resulting in recommendations that the nature and attributes of Deity had best be left hidden in the mystery supposed to enshroud them; and that God be held as an object of faith rather than of understanding--analyzed, you shall find such views bottomed rather on indifference than in grace or true modesty. What has been revealed about God may be known; beyond that our treatise does not seek to go, except where the treatise deals historically with the doctrines and speculations of theologians and philosophers. If this part of the treatise deals at times with \"Thin Thought\" and difficult abstractions, two things at least can be said for it, namely: (1) It will furnish good mental exercise; and (2) It will have the effect of making more clear by contrast the simple and beautiful doctrine of Deity as revealed in the person and character of Jesus, the Christ.  SPECIAL LESSONS.  There are five special lessons in the course, viz., Lessons V, X, XV, XXIV and XXXI, designed to be given in the form of discourses or lectures, by one or more speakers to each subject as shall be determined upon by the Presidents and Class Teachers. As suggested in previous Year Books these Lessons should be made special occasions by the Quorums; and in order that the work shall be well done, plenty of time should be allowed for preparation by making the assignment for the discourse or lecture, several weeks in advance. For example, at the second session of the classes assignments should be made for Lesson V., and so for each special Lesson, allowing from two to three weeks for preparation, having it understood that something like thorough and intelligent handling of the subject will be expected.  It is further suggested that not more than forty-five or at the outside sixty minutes be devoted to the main question, and then that fifteen or twenty minutes be allowed for criticism and the asking of questions, to be answered by the principal speaker or speakers who have had the subject in hand.  In these special Lessons, and quite aside from the main theme of which they treat are parts of two other lessons, to which the whole class should be required to give attention. These two lessons are first, Delivering a Discourse; and second, On Strength of Expression. The first subject runs through the five special lessons, the second through but four. It has been the aim of the writer to give one lesson on each of these subjects in the five and four parts respectively, into which the lessons are divided; and he entertains the hope that they will be helpful, at least to those just beginning their efforts at public speech.  _SUGGESTIONS AS TO PART III._  In Lessons under Part III, \"Conceptions of God,\" it is suggested that the effort of the classes be, simply to master the information contained in the lessons. It will not be found feasible to undertake a discussion of the various conceptions of God presented with any view to reconciliation with each other or with the scripture. Strive only for an understanding of what these conceptions are as presented by the advocates of them.  _DIVISION OF LESSONS._  Where the Lessons are thought to contain too much matter for one session of the class it is quite within the province of the Presidents or Class Teachers to divide them; and it is especially recommended that they do so in Lessons xxxii, xxxiii, xxxiv.  BOOKS OF REFERENCE.  The books of reference used in the following lessons would make an extended list, and in some cases the volumes named could only be found in reference libraries, as they are now out of print; it would therefore be of no advantage to give a complete enumeration of them here. I have given copious and extended notes upon many subdivisions of the lessons, especially where the books quoted would be difficult to obtain. The following named works, however, can be obtained and some of them are indispensable:  _The Seventy's Indispensable Library,_ consisting of the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, Richards and Little Compendium--this set of books in special and uniform bindings can be obtained; and we suggest that it would be a good thing for prospective missionaries among the Seventies to get these books in convenient form and durable bindings, so that when going upon missions they can take books with them with which they are familiar through frequent handling and reading.  _Some Standard Dictionary of the English Language,_ such as is used in high schools and academies, where unabridged Standard Dictionaries cannot be obtained.  _A Dictionary of the Bible._ (Dr. Wm. Smith's \"Dictionary of the Bible,\" the four-volume edition by Prof. H. B. Hackett, contains, it is said, \"the fruit of the ripest biblical scholarship of England\").  _Smith's Smaller Dictionary of the Bible_ (one volume) is the same work condensed. In somewhat the same line, owing to its very valuable introductory articles (thirty in number, one of which, \"Belief in God,\" we were permitted by the publishers to reproduce in the January and February numbers of the Era) is _Dummelow's \"One-Volume Bible Commentary,\"_ published by the MacMillan Company, New York.  Some _Standard Ecclesiastical_ or _Church History,_ such as Mosheim's or Dr. Neander's. The former can be had both in one or three volumes. The latter is in six volumes. In this line, and in preference to any other Church histories--after Mosheim's and Neander's--that have fallen under my notice, I recommend for the period it covers--the first ten centuries--Dr. Philip Smith's \"History of the Christian Church,\" two volumes. The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus, covering the first three and one half--nearly--Christian centuries; and the Early Christian Literature Primers, four books, covering the first seven and a half centuries.  _The History of Christianity._ This is a collection from "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60575"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Third Year (#1)"],["body","writings of Gibbon, chiefly selected chapters from the author's celebrated \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" edited and annotated by Peter Eckler. It is published in one volume, and as a history of Christianity's struggle with Pagan philosophy, and of the paganization of Christianity in the Early Christian Centuries, it is a valuable work.  _\"A History of Christian Doctrine,\"_ by Wm. G. T. Shedd (two volumes), is a valuable work. Written from a sympathetic view-point of orthodox Christianity, but valuable for its history of the development of the orthodox doctrine.  _The Nicene Creed,_ by J. J. Lias, gives detailed analysis of that somewhat famous \"symbol of the Christian faith,\" as it is sometimes called (one volume).  _\"Story of the World's Worship,\"_ by Frank S. Dobbins--1901--(one volume).  _\"Ten Great Religions,\"_ by James Freeman Clarke (two volumes). This work on the general subject, Conceptions of God, would be the best here enumerated.  _\"History of the Warfare of Science with Theology,\"_ by Andrew Dixon White (two volumes).  _\"Conflict Between Religion and Science,\"_ John William Draper (one volume). By the same Author, _\"Intellectual Development of Europe\"_ (two volumes).  _\"Science of Religion,\"_ by Max Muller (one volume). By the same Author, _\"Chips from a German Workshop\"_ (two volumes).  _The Philosophers:_ To name the works of the philosophers from Plato to modern times would be to uselessly enumerate a library. The following works, however, could perhaps be obtained by the quorums if not by individuals:  _Outlines of Lectures on the History of Philosophy,_ by Elmendorf (one volume). It is in the nature of an amplified index to the subject, and presupposes some general knowledge of it.  Maurice's _\"Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy\"_ (two volumes, 1395 pages), a noble work.  _\"Typical Modern Conceptions of God,\"_ Leighton (one volume), 1901.  Cicero's _\"Tusculan Disputations,\"_ (one volume), translated by Yonge.  Spencer's _\"First Principles,\"_ (one volume).  John Fiske's _\"Studies in Religion\"_ (one volume).  _\"The Truth of Thought,\"_ Poland, (one volume).  _\"Scientific Aspects of Mormonism,\"_ Prof. N. L. Nelson, of Brigham Young University (one volume). A work not yet fully appreciated.  Orson Pratt's Works, _\"The Kingdom of God.\"_  _\"Mormon Doctrine of Deity\"_ (Roberts).

Can'st thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?\" Job xi: 7_.  _NOTES._  1. _Tradition as a Source of the Knowledge of God:_ The first evidence men have of the existence of God comes from tradition, from the testimony of their fathers; and this has been the case from that event known in history as the Fall, until the present. Nor is this evidence unworthy of serious attention; it rests upon a surer foundation than is usually accorded it. Suppose we go back to its beginning, to its first introduction into the world, and observe how well founded it is.  According to the account given by Moses in Genesis, previous to the Fall. Adam associated with God; conversed with Him respecting the works of creation, and gave names to the cattle and all living things upon the earth. How long continued, or how intimate this association was, we are not informed in Genesis; but at all events, it was long enough continued, and sufficiently intimate to fix definitely in the minds of Adam the fact of God's existence. Then when Adam and his wife transgressed God's law, their recollection of his existence did not vanish, but they tried to hide from his presence; and were afterwards visited by the Lord, who reproved them for their sin and pronounced the penalty which would overtake them for their transgression. All I wish to call attention to in this is the fact that they knew positively of the Lord's existence before their transgression, and they did not forget his existence after that event; but, on the contrary, had a lively recollection of what they had seen and heard before they fell. This they related, undoubtedly, to their children, who, in turn, transmitted the knowledge to their children, and so from generation to generation the tradition of God's existence has been handed down until the present time.  2. _Antediluvian Tradition of God:_ It will be remembered that Adam and all the patriarchs previous to the Flood lived to a very great age. Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years, and during that time Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech, the father of Noah, were born. Indeed, the last named patriarch was fifty-six years old when Adam died; so that for a number of years he must have had the pleasure of Adam's acquaintance; while the patriarchs between Adam and Lamech all associated with him for hundreds of years, and would learn well the story that the grand Patriarch of our race would have to tell respecting Eden before the Fall.  3. _Postdiluvian Tradition of God:_ We are told in Genesis that when Lamech was one hundred and eighty-two years old he begat Noah; and since Lamech was fifty-six years old when Adam died, Adam had been dead but one hundred and twenty-six years when Noah was born. After the birth of Noah, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years, so that Noah associated with his father, who had seen Adam, for more than five hundred years; and also with a number of the other patriarchs--with Enos, the grandson of Adam, and son of Seth--with Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared and Methuselah. Then, the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth, all of whom were born before the Flood, would likewise be acquainted with a number of these worthies who had lived with Adam and heard his testimony of God's existence.  Again, Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the Flood; that would give him ample time and opportunity to teach his posterity for several generations the tradition respecting God, which he had received from a number of patriarchs, who lived previous to the Flood, and thus the said tradition became firmly fixed in the minds of men. The chronology here followed is that of the authorized version of the English Bible as summarized in the Second Lecture on Faith. Doctrine and Covenants.  4. _The Bible Here Regarded as a Body of Tradition:_ It may be thought that in the foregoing notes, dealing with tradition, we have been really appealing to Revelation, the Bible--the product of a divine inspiration resting upon men, hence Revelation--not tradition as men commonly understand tradition, viz: something handed down from age to age by oral communication without the aid of written memorials. But the Bible is sometimes regarded in more than one aspect. Commonly it is held to be a volume of inspired writings, revelation indeed; but it is also regarded as a body of traditions crystalized into writing. As such it has been used in preparing the foregoing notes.  5. _Reversed Order of Tradition:_ By this title I ask you to reverse the order of considering tradition. Instead of beginning with Adam and coming down through the generations to our own times, begin with the child of today and go up through the generations of men to Adam. How do children of our generation get their first idea of God? Ordinarily from their fathers. In Christian lands they obtain the \"God idea\" in childhood at their mothers' knee. And these mothers and fathers from the preceding generation of fathers and mothers; and these again from a preceding generation of fathers and mothers, and so following until the stream of tradition is traced to its source, which the Bible, considered as a body of tradition, now of long standing, represents to be Adam, who was \"the first man.\" It is interesting to note, in passing, that the Bible tradition--when we consider the Bible at no higher value than a volume of tradition--is confirmed in many respects by the tradition of other people than the Hebrews; namely, the Chaldeans, Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians and Egyptians. (See the Seventy's First Year Book, note 2 pp. 24, 25.[4])  6. _How True Traditions Degenerated Into Mythology:_ Traces of that tradition, (of the existence of God) and of these patriarchs connected with it, may be found in nearly all, and so far as I know, in all the mythologies of the world, as well in ancient as in modern times; as well in the mythology of the civilized Greeks and Romans, as in that of India, China, Egypt, and that of the American Indians. The tradition has evidently been corrupted, added to and twisted into fantastic shapes by the idle fancies of corrupt minds, but despite all the changes made in it, traces of this tradition are discoverable in the mythology of all lands. I believe, too, with Crabb, \"That the fictions of mythology were not invented, (always) in ignorance of divine truth, but with a wilful intention to pervert it; not made only by men of profligate lives and daring impiety, who preferred darkness to light, because their"]]]
