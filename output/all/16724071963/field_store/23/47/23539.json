They carried their muskets while out of camp and made every man they found take the oath of allegiance to the government.  I at once published orders prohibiting the soldiers from going into private houses unless invited by the inhabitants, and from appropriating private property to their own or to government uses.  The people were no longer molested or made afraid.  I received the most marked courtesy from the citizens of Mexico as long as I remained there.  Up to this time my regiment had not been carried in the school of the soldier beyond the company drill, except that it had received some training on the march from Springfield to the Illinois River.  There was now a good opportunity of exercising it in the battalion drill.  While I was at West Point the tactics used in the army had been Scott's and the musket the flint lock.  I had never looked at a copy of tactics from the time of my graduation.  My standing in that branch of studies had been near the foot of the class.  In the Mexican war in the summer of 1846, I had been appointed regimental quartermaster and commissary and had not been at a battalion drill since.  The arms had been changed since then and Hardee's tactics had been adopted.  I got a copy of tactics and studied one lesson, intending to confine the exercise of the first day to the commands I had thus learned.  By pursuing this course from day to day I thought I would soon get through the volume.  We were encamped just outside of town on the common, among scattering suburban houses with enclosed gardens, and when I got my regiment in line and rode to the front I soon saw that if I attempted to follow the lesson I had studied I would have to clear away some of the houses and garden fences to make room.  I perceived at once, however, that Hardee's tactics--a mere translation from the French with Hardee's name attached --was nothing more than common sense and the progress of the age applied to Scott's system.  The commands were abbreviated and the movement expedited.  Under the old tactics almost every change in the order of march was preceded by a \"halt,\" then came the change, and then the \"forward march.\"  With the new tactics all these changes could be made while in motion.  I found no trouble in giving commands that would take my regiment where I wanted it to go and carry it around all obstacles. I do not believe that the officers of the regiment ever discovered that I had never studied the tactics that I used.    CHAPTER XIX.  COMMISSIONED BRIGADIER-GENERAL--COMMAND AT IRONTON, MO.--JEFFERSON CITY --CAPE GIRARDEAU--GENERAL PRENTISS--SEIZURE OF PADUCAH--HEADQUARTERS AT CAIRO.  I had not been in Mexico many weeks when, reading a St. Louis paper, I found the President had asked the Illinois delegation in Congress to recommend some citizens of the State for the position of brigadier-general, and that they had unanimously recommended me as first on a list of seven.  I was very much surprised because, as I have said, my acquaintance with the Congressmen was very limited and I did not know of anything I had done to inspire such confidence.  The papers of the next day announced that my name, with three others, had been sent to the Senate, and a few days after our confirmation was announced.  When appointed brigadier-general I at once thought it proper that one of my aides should come from the regiment I had been commanding, and so selected Lieutenant C. B. Lagow.  While living in St. Louis, I had had a desk in the law office of McClellan, Moody and Hillyer.  Difference in views between the members of the firm on the questions of the day, and general hard times in the border cities, had broken up this firm. Hillyer was quite a young man, then in his twenties, and very brilliant. I asked him to accept a place on my staff.  I also wanted to take one man from my new home, Galena.  The canvass in the Presidential campaign the fall before had brought out a young lawyer by the name of John A. Rawlins, who proved himself one of the ablest speakers in the State.  He was also a candidate for elector on the Douglas ticket.  When Sumter was fired upon and the integrity of the Union threatened, there was no man more ready to serve his country than he.  I wrote at once asking him to accept the position of assistant adjutant-general with the rank of captain, on my staff.  He was about entering the service as major of a new regiment then organizing in the north-western part of the State; but he threw this up and accepted my offer.  Neither Hillyer nor Lagow proved to have any particular taste or special qualifications for the duties of the soldier, and the former resigned during the Vicksburg campaign; the latter I relieved after the battle of Chattanooga.  Rawlins remained with me as long as he lived, and rose to the rank of brigadier general and chief-of-staff to the General of the Army--an office created for him--before the war closed.  He was an able man, possessed of great firmness, and could say \"no\" so emphatically to a request which he thought should not be granted that the person he was addressing would understand at once that there was no use of pressing the matter.  General Rawlins was a very useful officer in other ways than this.  I became very much attached to him.  Shortly after my promotion I was ordered to Ironton, Missouri, to command a district in that part of the State, and took the 21st Illinois, my old regiment, with me.  Several other regiments were ordered to the same destination about the same time.  Ironton is on the Iron Mountain railroad, about seventy miles south of St. Louis, and situated among hills rising almost to the dignity of mountains.  When I reached there, about the 8th of August, Colonel B. Gratz Brown --afterwards Governor of Missouri and in 1872 Vice-Presidential candidate --was in command.  Some of his troops were ninety days' men and their time had expired some time before.  The men had no clothing but what they had volunteered in, and much of this was so worn that it would hardly stay on.  General Hardee--the author of the tactics I did not study--was at Greenville some twenty-five miles further south, it was said, with five thousand Confederate troops.  Under these circumstances Colonel Brown's command was very much demoralized.  A squadron of cavalry could have ridden into the valley and captured the entire force. Brown himself was gladder to see me on that occasion than he ever has been since.  I relieved him and sent all his men home within a day or two, to be mustered out of service.  Within ten days after reading Ironton I was prepared to take the offensive against the enemy at Greenville.  I sent a column east out of the valley we were in, with orders to swing around to the south and west and come into the Greenville road ten miles south of Ironton.  Another column marched on the direct road and went into camp at the point designated for the two columns to meet. I was to ride out the next morning and take personal command of the movement.  My experience against Harris, in northern Missouri, had inspired me with confidence. But when the evening train came in, it brought General B. M. Prentiss with orders to take command of the district.  His orders did not relieve me, but I knew that by law I was senior, and at that time even the President did not have the authority to assign a junior to command a senior of the same grade.  I therefore gave General Prentiss the situation of the troops and the general condition of affairs, and started for St. Louis the same day.  The movement against the rebels at Greenville went no further.  From St. Louis I was ordered to Jefferson City, the capital of the State, to take command.  General Sterling Price, of the Confederate army, was thought to be threatening the capital, Lexington, Chillicothe and other comparatively large towns in the central part of Missouri.  I found a good many troops in Jefferson City, but in the greatest confusion, and no one person knew where they all were.  Colonel Mulligan, a gallant man, was in command, but he had not been educated as yet to his new profession and did not know how to maintain discipline. I found that volunteers had obtained permission from the department commander, or claimed they had, to raise, some of them, regiments; some battalions; some companies--the officers to be commissioned according to the number of men they brought into the service.  There were recruiting stations all over town, with notices, rudely lettered on boards over the doors, announcing the arm of service and length of time for which recruits at that station would be received.  The law required all volunteers to serve for three years or the war.  But in Jefferson City in August, 1861, they were recruited for different periods and on different conditions; some were enlisted for six months, some for a year, some without any condition as to where they were to serve, others were not to be sent out of the State.  The recruits were principally men from regiments stationed there and already in the service, bound for three years if the war lasted that long.  The city was filled with Union fugitives who had been driven by guerilla bands to take refuge with the National troops.  They were in a deplorable condition and must have starved but for the support the government gave them.  They had generally made their escape with a team or two, sometimes a yoke of oxen with a mule or a horse in the lead.  A little bedding besides their clothing and some food had been thrown into the wagon.  All else of their worldly goods were abandoned and appropriated by their former neighbors; for the Union man in Missouri who staid at home during the rebellion, if he was not immediately under the protection of the National troops, was at perpetual war with his neighbors.  I stopped the recruiting service, and disposed the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5862"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 3. (#0)"],["body","MEMOIRS OF U. S. GRANT, Part 3.  by U. S. Grant    CHAPTER XXVII.  HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO MEMPHIS--ON THE ROAD TO MEMPHIS--ESCAPING JACKSON --COMPLAINTS AND REQUESTS--HALLECK APPOINTED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF--RETURN TO CORINTH--MOVEMENTS OF BRAGG--SURRENDER OF CLARKSVILLE--THE ADVANCE UPON CHATTANOOGA--SHERIDAN COLONEL OF A MICHIGAN REGIMENT.  My position at Corinth, with a nominal command and yet no command, became so unbearable that I asked permission of Halleck to remove my headquarters to Memphis.  I had repeatedly asked, between the fall of Donelson and the evacuation of Corinth, to be relieved from duty under Halleck; but all my applications were refused until the occupation of the town.  I then obtained permission to leave the department, but General Sherman happened to call on me as I was about starting and urged me so strongly not to think of going, that I concluded to remain.  My application to be permitted to remove my headquarters to Memphis was, however, approved, and on the 21st of June I started for that point with my staff and a cavalry escort of only a part of one company.  There was a detachment of two or three companies going some twenty-five miles west to be stationed as a guard to the railroad.  I went under cover of this escort to the end of their march, and the next morning proceeded to La Grange with no convoy but the few cavalry men I had with me.  From La Grange to Memphis the distance is forty-seven miles. There were no troops stationed between these two points, except a small force guarding a working party which was engaged in repairing the railroad. Not knowing where this party would be found I halted at La Grange. General Hurlbut was in command there at the time and had his headquarters tents pitched on the lawn of a very commodious country house.  The proprietor was at home and, learning of my arrival, he invited General Hurlbut and me to dine with him.  I accepted the invitation and spent a very pleasant afternoon with my host, who was a thorough Southern gentleman fully convinced of the justice of secession. After dinner, seated in the capacious porch, he entertained me with a recital of the services he was rendering the cause.  He was too old to be in the ranks himself--he must have been quite seventy then--but his means enabled him to be useful in other ways.  In ordinary times the homestead where he was now living produced the bread and meat to supply the slaves on his main plantation, in the low-lands of Mississippi.  Now he raised food and forage on both places, and thought he would have that year a surplus sufficient to feed three hundred families of poor men who had gone into the war and left their families dependent upon the \"patriotism\" of those better off.  The crops around me looked fine, and I had at the moment an idea that about the time they were ready to be gathered the \"Yankee\" troops would be in the neighborhood and harvest them for the benefit of those engaged in the suppression of the rebellion instead of its support.  I felt, however, the greatest respect for the candor of my host and for his zeal in a cause he thoroughly believed in, though our views were as wide apart as it is possible to conceive.  The 23d of June, 1862, on the road from La Grange to Memphis was very warm, even for that latitude and season.  With my staff and small escort I started at an early hour, and before noon we arrived within twenty miles of Memphis.  At this point I saw a very comfortable-looking white-haired gentleman seated at the front of his house, a little distance from the road.  I let my staff and escort ride ahead while I halted and, for an excuse, asked for a glass of water.  I was invited at once to dismount and come in.  I found my host very genial and communicative, and staid longer than I had intended, until the lady of the house announced dinner and asked me to join them.  The host, however, was not pressing, so that I declined the invitation and, mounting my horse, rode on.  About a mile west from where I had been stopping a road comes up from the southeast, joining that from La Grange to Memphis.  A mile west of this junction I found my staff and escort halted and enjoying the shade of forest trees on the lawn of a house located several hundred feet back from the road, their horses hitched to the fence along the line of the road.  I, too, stopped and we remained there until the cool of the afternoon, and then rode into Memphis.  The gentleman with whom I had stopped twenty miles from Memphis was a Mr. De Loche, a man loyal to the Union.  He had not pressed me to tarry longer with him because in the early part of my visit a neighbor, a Dr. Smith, had called and, on being presented to me, backed off the porch as if something had hit him.  Mr. De Loche knew that the rebel General Jackson was in that neighborhood with a detachment of cavalry.  His neighbor was as earnest in the southern cause as was Mr. De Loche in that of the Union.  The exact location of Jackson was entirely unknown to Mr. De Loche; but he was sure that his neighbor would know it and would give information of my presence, and this made my stay unpleasant to him after the call of Dr. Smith.  I have stated that a detachment of troops was engaged in guarding workmen who were repairing the railroad east of Memphis.  On the day I entered Memphis, Jackson captured a small herd of beef cattle which had been sent east for the troops so engaged.  The drovers were not enlisted men and he released them.  A day or two after one of these drovers came to my headquarters and, relating the circumstances of his capture, said Jackson was very much disappointed that he had not captured me; that he was six or seven miles south of the Memphis and Charleston railroad when he learned that I was stopping at the house of Mr. De Loche, and had ridden with his command to the junction of the road he was on with that from La Grange and Memphis, where he learned that I had passed three-quarters of an hour before.  He thought it would be useless to pursue with jaded horses a well-mounted party with so much of a start. Had he gone three-quarters of a mile farther he would have found me with my party quietly resting under the shade of trees and without even arms in our hands with which to defend ourselves.  General Jackson of course did not communicate his disappointment at not capturing me to a prisoner, a young drover; but from the talk among the soldiers the facts related were learned.  A day or two later Mr. De Loche called on me in Memphis to apologize for his apparent incivility in not insisting on my staying for dinner.  He said that his wife accused him of marked discourtesy, but that, after the call of his neighbor, he had felt restless until I got away.  I never met General Jackson before the war, nor during it, but have met him since at his very comfortable summer home at Manitou Springs, Colorado.  I reminded him of the above incident, and this drew from him the response that he was thankful now he had not captured me.  I certainly was very thankful too.  My occupation of Memphis as district headquarters did not last long. The period, however, was marked by a few incidents which were novel to me.  Up to that time I had not occupied any place in the South where the citizens were at home in any great numbers.  Dover was within the fortifications at Fort Donelson, and, as far as I remember, every citizen was gone.  There were no people living at Pittsburg landing, and but very few at Corinth.  Memphis, however, was a populous city, and there were many of the citizens remaining there who were not only thoroughly impressed with the justice of their cause, but who thought that even the \"Yankee soldiery\" must entertain the same views if they could only be induced to make an honest confession.  It took hours of my time every day to listen to complaints and requests.  The latter were generally reasonable, and if so they were granted; but the complaints were not always, or even often, well founded.  Two instances will mark the general character.  First:  the officer who commanded at Memphis immediately after the city fell into the hands of the National troops had ordered one of the churches of the city to be opened to the soldiers.  Army chaplains were authorized to occupy the pulpit.  Second: at the beginning of the war the Confederate Congress had passed a law confiscating all property of \"alien enemies\" at the South, including the debts of Southerners to Northern men.  In consequence of this law, when Memphis was occupied the provost-marshal had forcibly collected all the evidences he could obtain of such debts.  Almost the first complaints made to me were these two outrages.  The gentleman who made the complaints informed me first of his own high standing as a lawyer, a citizen and a Christian.  He was a deacon in the church which had been defiled by the occupation of Union troops, and by a Union chaplain filling the pulpit.  He did not use the word \"defile,\" but he expressed the idea very clearly.  He asked that the church be restored to the former congregation.  I told him that no order had been issued prohibiting the congregation attending the church.  He said of course the congregation could not hear a Northern clergyman who differed so radically with them on questions of government.  I told him the troops would continue to occupy that church for the present, and that they would not be called upon to hear disloyal sentiments proclaimed from the pulpit.  This closed the argument on the first point.  Then came the second.  The complainant said that he wanted the papers restored to him which had been surrendered to the provost-marshal under protest; he was a lawyer, and before the establishment of the \"Confederate States Government\" had been the attorney for a number of large business houses at the North; that \"his government\" had confiscated all debts due \"alien enemies,\" and appointed commissioners, or officers, to"]]]
