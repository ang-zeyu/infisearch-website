On arriving he discovered two men in tartans, with their backs to the opposite wall, furiously assaulted by a throng of Edward's soldiers. At this sight, the Scots who accompanied Wallace were so enraged that, blowing their bugles to encourage the assailed, they joined hand to hand with their gallant leader, and attacking the banditti, each man cut his opponent to the ground.  Such unexpected assistance reanimated the drooping strength of one of the two, with whom the cry had issued.  He sprung from the wall with the vigor of a tiger, but at the moment received a wound in his back, which would have thrown him at the feet of his enemies, had not Wallace caught him in his left arm, and with his right, cleared the way, while he cried to his men who were fighting near him-\"To the Glen!\"  As he spoke, he threw the now insensible stranger into their arms.  The other man, whose voice had first attracted Wallace, at the instant sunk, covered with blood, on the pavement.  Two of the servants, obeying their master, carried their senseless burden toward the horses; but the third, being hemmed in by the furious soldiers, could not move.  Wallace made a passage to his rescue, and effected it; but one base wretch, while the now wounded Scot was retreating, made a stroke which would have severed his head from his body, had not the trusty claymore of Wallace struck down the pending weapon of the coward, and received his rushing body upon its point.  He fell with bitter imprecations, calling aloud for vengeance.  A dreadful cry was now raised by the whole band of assassins: \"Murder!-treason!-Arthur Heselrigge is slain!\"  The uproar became general.  The windows of the adjoining houses were thrown open; people armed and unarmed issued from their doors and pressed forward to inquire the cause of the alarm.  Wallace was nearly overpowered; a hundred swords flashed in the torchlight; but at the moment he expected they would be sheathed in his heart, the earth gave way under his feet, and he sunk into utter darkness.  He fell upon a quantity of gathered broom; and concluding that the weight of the thronging multitude had burst his way through the arch of a cellar, he sprung to his feet; and though he heard the curses of several wretches, who had fallen with him and fared worse, he made but one step to a half-opened door, pointed out to him by a gleam from an inner passage.  The men uttered a shout as they saw him darken the light which glimmered through it; but they were incapable of pursuit; and Wallace, aware of his danger, darting across the adjoining apartment, burst open a window, and leaped out to the foot of the Lanark hills.  The oaths of the soldiers, enraged at his escape, echoed in his ears, till distance sunk them into hoarse murmurs.  He pursued his way over the craigs; through the valley, and across the river, to the cliffs which embattle the garden of Ellerslie.  Springing on the projecting point of the nearest, he leaped into a thicket of honeysuckles.  This was the favorite bower of his Marion!  The soft perfume, as it saluted his senses, seemed to breathe peace and safety; and as he emerged from its fragrant embrace, he walked with a calmer step toward the house. He approached a door which led into the garden.  It was open.  He beheld his beloved leaning over a couch, on which was laid the person he had rescued.  Halbert was dressing his wounds.  Wallace paused for a moment, to contemplate his lovely wife in this more lovely act of charity.  Her beautiful hands held a cup to the lips of the stranger; while her long hair, escaped from its band, fell in jetty ringlets, and mingled with his silver locks.  \"Marion!\" exclaimed the overflowing soul of her husband.  She looked up at the well-known sound, and with a cry of joy, rushing forward, threw herself into his arms; her tears flowed, she sobbed--she clung to his breast.  It was the first time Wallace had been from her; she had feared it would have been the last.  The hour--the conflict--the bleeding stranger!  But now he was returned--he was safe!  \"Art thou indeed here!\" exclaimed she.  Blood fell from his forehead upon her face and bosom: \"O, my Wallace!\" cried she, in agony.  \"Fear not, my love! all is well, since our wounded countryman is safe.\"  \"But you, bleed!\" returned she.  No tears now impeded her voice. Terror had checked their joyful currents; and she felt as if she expected his life-blood to issue from the wound on which she gazed.  \"I hope my preserver is not hurt?\" inquired the stranger.  \"Oh, no!\" replied Wallace, putting back the hair from his forehead; \"a mere trifle!\"  That the action had discovered the gash to be wider than he thought, he saw in the countenance of his wife!  She turned deadly pale.  \"Marion,\" said he, \"to convince you how causeless your fears are, you shall cure me yourself; and with no other surgery than your girdle!\"  When Lady Wallace heard his gay tone, and saw the unforced smiles on his lips, she took courage; and, remembering the deep wounds on the stranger, whom she had just assisted to dress, without any alarm for his life, she began to hope that she need not now fear for the object dearest to her in existence.  Rising from her husband's arms, with a languid smile she unbound the linen fillet from her waist; and Halbert having poured some balsam into the wound, she prepared to apply the bandage; but when she lifted her husband's hair from his temple--that hair which had so often been the object of her admiration, as it hung in shining masses over his arching brows!-when the clotted blood met her fingers, a mist seemed to pass over her sight; she paused for a moment; but rallying her strength, as the cheerful sound of his voice conversing with his guest assured her fear was needless, she tied the fillet; and, stealing a soft kiss on his cheek when she had finished, she seated herself, yet trembling, by his side.  \"Gallant Wallace!\" continued the stranger-agitation had prevented her hearing what had preceded this-\"it is Donald Earl of Mar, who owes his life to you.\"  \"Then blessed be my arm,\" exclaimed Wallace, \"that has preserved a life so precious to my country!\"  \"May it indeed be blessed!\" cried Lord Mar; \"for this night it has made the Southrons feel there is yet one man in Scotland who does not fear to resist oppression, and to punish treachery.\"  \"What treachery?\" inquired Lady Wallace, her alarmed spirit still hovering about her soul's far dearer part; \"is any meant to my husband?\"  \"None to Sir William Wallace, more than to any other brave Scot,\" replied the earl: \"but we all see the oppression of our country; we all know the treachery by which it was subjugated; and this night, in my own person, I have felt the effects of both.  The English at Lanark dispatched a body of men to Bothwell Castle (where my family now are), on a plea, that as its lord is yet absent, they presume he is adverse to Edward, and therefore they must search his dwelling for documents to settle the point.  Considering myself the representative of my brother-in-law, Lord Bothwell, and suspecting that this might be only a private marauding party, I refused to admit the soldiers; and saw them depart, swearing to return next day with a stronger force, and storm the castle.  To be ascertained of their commission, and to appeal against such unprovoked tyranny, should it be true, I followed the detachment to Lanark.  \"I saw Heselrigge the governor.  He avowed the transaction; but awed by the power which he thinks I possess in the country, he consented to spare Bothwell while I and my family remain in it.  It being nearly dark, I took my leave, and was proceeding toward my servants in the courtyard when a young man accosted me.  I recognized him to be the officer who had commanded the party I had driven from the castle. Heselrigge having told me that he was his nephew, I made no hesitation to go back with him, when he informed me that his uncle had forgotten something of importance, and begged me to return.  I followed his steps; but instead of conducting me to the room in which I had conversed with Heselrigge, he led me along a dark passage into a small apartment, where telling me his uncle would attend me, he suddenly retreated out of the door, and before I could recollect myself I heard him bolt it after him.  \"I now saw myself a prisoner; and alarmed at what might be intended to my defenseless family, I made every essay to force the door, but it was in vain.  Driven to despair, I remained in a state of mind not to be described, when the bolt was withdrawn, and two men entered, with manacles in their hands.  They attempted to seize me, telling me I was the prisoner of King Edward.  I did not listen further, but wounding one with my dagger, felled the other to the ground; and darting past him, made my way through what passages I cannot tell, till I found myself in a street leading from behind the governor's house.  I ran against some one as I rushed from the portal; it was my servant Neil. I hastily told him to draw his sword and follow me.  We then hurried forward; he telling me he had stepped out to observe the night, while the rest of my men were awaiting me in the house, wondering at my delay.  \"Rejoiced at my escape, and fearing the worst of consequences from the treachery of Heselrigge, I was hastening onward, determined to pursue my way on foot to the protection of my family, when, at the turning of an angle which leads to the Bothwell road, we were suddenly surrounded by armed men.  The moon shone full on their faces, and I discovered they were Southrons, and that young Heselrigge was at their head.  \"He aimed a blow at my head with his battle-ax, and in a voice of triumph exclaimed to his soldiers, 'The plunder of Bothwell, my lads! Down with its lord! All but the lady Helen shall be yours!\"  \"In a moment every sword was directed toward me.  They wounded me in several places; but the thought of my daughter"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6086"],["title","The Scottish Chiefs (#4)"],["body","supernatural vigor to my arm, and I defended myself till the cries of my servant brought you, my brave deliverer, to my rescue.  But, while I am safe, perhaps my treacherous pursuer has marched toward Bothwell, too sure to commit the horrid violence he meditates; there are none to guard my child but a few domestics, the unpracticed sword of my stripling nephew, and the feeble arms of my wife.\"  \"Be easy on that head,\" interrupted Wallace: \"I believe the infamous leader of the banditti fell by my hand, for the soldiers made an outcry that Arthur Heselrigge was killed; and then pressing on me to take revenge, their weight broke a passage into a vault, through which I escaped-\"  \"Save, save yourself, my master!\" cried a man rushing in from the garden. \"You are pursued-\"  While he spoke he felt insensible at Wallace's feet.  It was Dugald whom he had rescued from the blow of Heselrigge, and who, from the state of his wound had been thus long in reaching Ellerslie.  Wallace had hardly time to give him to the care of Halbert, when the voice of war assailed his ears.  The tumult of men demanding admittance and the terrible sound of spears rattling against the shields of their owners, told the astonished group within that the house was beset by armed foes.  \"Blood for blood!\" cried a horrid voice, which penetrated the almost palsied senses of Lady Marion.  \"Vengence on Wallace, for the murder of Heselrigge!\"  \"Fly, fly!\" cried she, looking wildly at her husband.  \"Whither?\" answered he, supporting her in his arms.  \"Would this be a moment to leave you, and our wounded guest?  I must meet them.\"  \"Not now!\" cried Lord Mar.  \"Hear you not how numerous they are?  Mark that shout! they thirst for blood.  If you have love, pity, for your wife, delay not a moment.  Again-\"  The uproar redoubled, and the room was instantly filled with shrieking women in their night-clothes, the attendants of Lady Wallace.  She almost expiring, on her husband's breast.  \"O my lord!\" cried the terrified creatures, wringing their hands, \"what will become of us!  The Southrons are at the gates, and we shall be lost forever!\"  \"Fear not,\" replied Wallace; \"retire to your chambers.  I am the person they seek: none else will meet with injury.\"  Appeased by this assurance, the women retreated to their apartments; and Wallace, turning to the earl, who continued to enforce the necessity of his flight, repeated, that he would not consent to leave his wife in such a tumult.  \"Leave me,\" cried she, in an inarticulate voice, \"or see me die.\"  As she spoke, there was a violent crash, and a tremendous burst of imprecations.  Three of Wallace's men ran panting into the room.  Two of the assailants had climbed to the hall window; and had just been thrown back upon the cliffs, where one was killed.  \"Conceal yourself,\" said the Scots to Wallace; \"for in a few minutes more your men will not be able to maintain the gates.\"  \"Yes, my dear lord,\" cried Halbert, \"there is a dry well at the end of the garden; at the bottom of that you will be safe.\"  \"By your love for me, Wallace--by all you owe to the tender affections of your grandfather, hearken to him!\" cried Lady Marion, falling at his feet, and clasping his knees.  \"I kneel for my life in kneeling for yours!  Pity the gray hairs of Sir Ronald, whom your untimely death would bring to the grave!  Pity your unborn child!  Fly, Wallace, fly if you would have me live!\"  She was pale and breathless.  \"Angel of my life,\" exclaimed Wallace, straining her to his heart, \"I obey thee.  But if the hand of one of the desperate robbers dares to touch thy hallowed person-\"  \"Think not so, my lord,\" interrupted Halbert; \"it is you they seek. Not finding you, they will be too eager in pursuit to molest your lady.\"  \"I shall be safe,\" whispered Marion; \"only fly--while you are here, their shouts kill me.\"  \"But thou shalt go with me,\" returned he; \"the well will contain us all.  But first let our faithful Halbert and these honest fellows lower Lord Mar into the place of refuge.  He being the cause of the affray, if discovered, would be immediately sacrificed.\"  Lord Mar acquiesced; and while the contention was so loud without, as to threaten the tearing down of the walls, the earl was carried into the garden.  He was followed by Sir William Wallace, to whose arm his wife yet fondly clung.  At every cry of the enemy, at every shock they gave to his yet impregnable gates, she breathed the shorter, and was clasped by the lord of her heart still more closely to his bosom.  At the well-side they found the earl bound with rope that was to lower him to the bottom.  By great care it was safely done; and the cord being brought up again, before it was tied round Wallace (for his agonized wife insisted he should descend next), he recollected that the iron box at his side might hurt the wounded nobleman by striking him in his descent; and, unbuckling it, he said it contained matters of great value, and ordered it to be lowered first.  Lord Mar, beneath, was releasing it from the rope, when a shout of triumph pierced their ears.  A party of the English, having come round the heights, had leaped the wall of the garden, and were within a few yards of the well.  For Wallace to descend now was impossible.  \"That tree!\" whispered Marion, pointing to an oak-tree near which they stood. As she spoke, she slid from his arms, and along with the venerable Halbert, who had seized her hand, disappeared amid the adjoining thicket.  The two servants fled also.  Wallace, finding himself alone, the next instant, like one of his native eagles, was looking down from the towering top of the wood upon his enemies.  They passed beneath him, denouncing vengeance upon the assassin of Arthur Heselrigge!  One, who by the brightness of his armor seemed to be their leader, stopped under the tree, and complained he had so sprained his ankle in leaping the wall, he must wait a few minutes to recover himself.  Several soldiers drew toward him; but he ordered them to pursue their duty, search the house, and bring Wallace, dead or alive, before him.  They obeyed; but others, who had gained admittance to the tower through the now forced gates, soon ran to him with information that the murderer could nowhere be found.  \"But here is a gay ladie,\" cried one; \"perhaps she can tell of his hiding-place.\" And at moment Marion, with Halbert, appeared amongst a band of men.  The lighted torches which the soldiers held, shone full on her face.  Though pale as monumental marble, the exquisite beauty of her features, and the calm dignity which commanded from her eyes, awed the officer into respect and admiration.  \"Soldiers, stand back!\" cried he, advancing to Lady Wallace.  \"Fear not, madam.\"  As the words passed his lips, a flight of arrows flew into the bosom of the tree.  A piercing shriek from Marion was her only answer.  \"Hah! my lady's falcon!\" cried Halbert alarmed, doubly, for the fate of his master.  A sudden agitation of the branches having excited an indefinite suspicion in a body of archers who stood near, with one impulse they had discharged their arrows to the spot. Halbert's ready excuse, both for the disturbance in the tree and his lady's shriek, was prompted and warranted true by the appearance of a large bird, which the rushing of the arrows had frighted from her nest; she rose suddenly from amongst the branches, and soared away, far to the east, with loud screams.  All being again still, Marion hoped that her husband had escaped any serious injury from the arrows; and turning with recovered composure to the officer, heard him, with a glow of comfort, reprimand his men for daring to draw their bows without his orders.  Then addressing her, \"I beg your pardon, madam,\" said he, \"both for the alarm these hot-headed men have occasioned you, and for the violence they have committed in forcing one of your sex and beauty before me.  Had I expected to have found a lady here, I should have issued orders to have prevented this outrage; but I am sent hither in quest of Sir William Wallace, who, by a mortal attack made on the person of the Governor of Lanark's nephew, has forfeited his life.  The scabbard of his sword, found beside the murdered Heselrigge, is an undeniable proof of his guilt.  Direct us to find him, and not only your release, but the favor of the English monarch will await your allegiance.\"  \"I am Sir William Wallace's wife,\" returned the gentle Marion, in a firm tone; \"and by what authority you seek him thus, and presume to call him guilty, I cannot understand.\"  \"By the authority of the laws, madam, which he has violated.\"  \"What laws?\" rejoined she; \"Sir William Wallace acknowledges none but those of God and his country.  Neither of these has he transgressed.\"  The officer replied, \"This night he assassinated Arthur Heselrigge in the streets of Lanark; and that condemns him, by the last declaration of King Edward: Whatever Scot maltreats any one of the English soldiers, or civil officers garrisoned in the towns of Scotland, shall thereby forfeit his life, as the penalty of his crime.\"  \"A tyrant's law, sir, to which no freeborn Scot will submit!  But even were it allowed by my countrymen, in this case it can have no hold on my husband.  That he is a Scot, he glories: and not that he maltreated any Englishman in the streets of Lanark, do I glory; but because, when he saw two defenseless men borne down by a band of armed soldiers, he exposed his unshielded breast in their defense; one of the two died, covered with wounds.  That the governor's nephew also fell, was a just retribution for his heading so unequal a contest, and no crime in Sir William Wallace; for he slew him to preserve a feeble old man, who had a hundred English swords leveled at his life.\"  The officer paused for a moment, and then, ordering his soldiers to fall further back, when they were at a sufficient distance, he offered to take Lady Wallace's hand.  She withstood his motion with a"]]]
