PREFACE    TO THE READER.--What this book wants is not a simple Preface but an apology, and a very brilliant and convincing one at that. Recognising this fully, and feeling quite incompetent to write such a masterpiece, I have asked several literary friends to write one for me, but they have kindly but firmly declined, stating that it is impossible satisfactorily to apologise for my liberties with Lindley Murray and the Queen's English.  I am therefore left to make a feeble apology for this book myself, and all I can personally say is that it would have been much worse than it is had it not been for Dr. Henry Guillemard, who has not edited it, or of course the whole affair would have been better, but who has most kindly gone through the proof sheets, lassoing prepositions which were straying outside their sentence stockade, taking my eye off the water cask and fixing it on the scenery where I meant it to be, saying firmly in pencil on margins \"No you don't,\" when I was committing some more than usually heinous literary crime, and so on.  In cases where his activities in these things may seem to the reader to have been wanting, I beg to state that they really were not.  It is I who have declined to ascend to a higher level of lucidity and correctness of diction than I am fitted for.  I cannot forbear from mentioning my gratitude to Mr. George Macmillan for his patience and kindness with me,--a mere jungle of information on West Africa.  Whether you my reader will share my gratitude is, I fear, doubtful, for if it had not been for him I should never have attempted to write a book at all, and in order to excuse his having induced me to try I beg to state that I have written only on things that I know from personal experience and very careful observation.  I have never accepted an explanation of a native custom from one person alone, nor have I set down things as being prevalent customs from having seen a single instance.  I have endeavoured to give you an honest account of the general state and manner of life in Lower Guinea and some description of the various types of country there.  In reading this section you must make allowances for my love of this sort of country, with its great forests and rivers and its animistic-minded inhabitants, and for my ability to be more comfortable there than in England.  Your superior culture-instincts may militate against your enjoying West Africa, but if you go there you will find things as I have said.  January, 1897.    PREFACE TO THE ABRIDGED EDITION OF TRAVELS IN WEST AFRICA.    When on my return to England from my second sojourn in West Africa, I discovered, to my alarm, that I was, by a freak of fate, the sea- serpent of the season, I published, in order to escape from this reputation, a very condensed, much abridged version of my experiences in Lower Guinea; and I thought that I need never explain about myself or Lower Guinea again.  This was one of my errors.  I have been explaining ever since; and, though not reconciled to so doing, I am more or less resigned to it, because it gives me pleasure to see that English people can take an interest in that land they have neglected.  Nevertheless, it was a shock to me when the publishers said more explanation was required.  I am thankful to say the explanation they required was merely on what plan the abridgment of my first account had been made.  I can manage that explanation easily.  It has been done by removing from it certain sections whole, and leaving the rest very much as it first stood. Of course it would have been better if I had totally reformed and rewritten the book in pellucid English; but that is beyond me, and I feel at any rate this book must be better than it was, for there is less of it; and I dimly hope critics will now see that there is a saving grace in disconnectedness, for owing to that disconnectedness whole chapters have come out without leaving holes.  As for the part that is left in, I have already apologised for its form, and I cannot help it, for Lower Guinea is like what I have said it is.  No one who knows it has sent home contradictions of my description of it, or its natives, or their manners or customs, and they have had by now ample time and opportunity.  The only complaints I have had regarding my account from my fellow West Coasters have been that I might have said more.  I trust my forbearance will send a thrill of gratitude through readers of the 736-page edition.  There is, however, one section that I reprint, regarding which I must say a few words.  It is that on the trade and labour problem in West Africa, particularly the opinion therein expressed regarding the liquor traffic.  This part has brought down on me much criticism from the Missionary Societies and their friends; and I beg gratefully to acknowledge the honourable fairness with which the controversy has been carried on by the great Wesleyan Methodist Mission to the Gold Coast and the Baptist Mission to the Congo.  It has not ended in our agreement on this point, but it has raised my esteem of Missionary Societies considerably; and anyone interested in this matter I beg to refer to the Baptist Magazine for October, 1897.  Therein will be found my answer, and the comments on it by a competent missionary authority; for the rest of this matter I beg all readers of this book to bear in mind that I confine myself to speaking only of the bit of Africa I know--West Africa.  During this past summer I attended a meeting at which Sir George Taubman Goldie spoke, and was much struck with the truth of what he said on the difference of different African regions.  He divided Africa into three zones:  firstly, that region where white races could colonise in the true sense of the word, and form a great native-born white population, namely, the region of the Cape; secondly, a region where the white race could colonise, but to a less extent--an extent analogous to that in India--namely, the highlands of Central East Africa and parts of Northern Africa; thirdly, a region where the white races cannot colonise in a true sense of the word, namely, the West African region, and in those regions he pointed out one of the main elements of prosperity and advance is the native African population.  I am quoting his words from memory, possibly imperfectly; but there is very little reliable printed matter to go on when dealing with Sir George Taubman Goldie, which is regrettable because he himself is an experienced and reliable authority.  I am however quite convinced that these aforesaid distinct regions are regions that the practical politician dealing with Africa must recognise, and keep constantly in mind when attempting to solve the many difficulties that that great continent presents, and sincerely hope every reader of this work will remember that I am speaking of that last zone, the zone wherein white races cannot colonise in a true sense of the word, but which is nevertheless a vitally important region to a great manufacturing country like England, for therein are vast undeveloped markets wherein she can sell her manufactured goods and purchase raw material for her manufactures at a reasonable rate.  Having a rooted, natural, feminine hatred for politics I have no inclination to become diffuse on them, as I have on the errors of other people's cooking or ideas on decoration.  I know I am held to be too partial to France in West Africa; too fond of pointing out her brilliant achievements there, too fond of saying the native is as happy, and possibly happier, under her rule than under ours; and also that I am given to a great admiration for Germans; but this is just like any common-sense Englishwoman.  Of course I am devoted to my own John; but still Monsieur is brave, bright, and fascinating; Mein Herr is possessed of courage and commercial ability in the highest degree, and, besides, he takes such a lot of trouble to know the real truth about things, and tells them to you so calmly and carefully--and our own John--well, of course, he is everything that's good and great, but he makes a shocking fool of himself at times, particularly in West Africa.  I should enjoy holding what one of my justly irritated expurgators used to call one of my little thanksgiving services here, but I will not; for, after all, it would be impossible for me to satisfactorily thank those people who, since my publication of this book, have given me help and information on the subject of West Africa.  Chief amongst them have been Mr. A. L. Jones, Sir. R. B. N. Walker, Mr. Irvine, and Mr. John Holt.  I have not added to this book any information I have received since I wrote it, as it does not seem to me fair to do so.  My only regret regarding it is that I have not dwelt sufficiently on the charm of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],["title","Travels in West Africa: Congo Fran√ßais, Corisco and Cameroons (#1)"],["body","Africa; it is so difficult to explain such things; but I am sure there are amongst my readers people who know by experience the charm some countries exercise over men--countries very different from each other and from West Africa. The charm of West Africa is a painful one:  it gives you pleasure when you are out there, but when you are back here it gives you pain by calling you.  It sends up before your eyes a vision of a wall of dancing white, rainbow-gemmed surf playing on a shore of yellow sand before an audience of stately coco palms; or of a great mangrove- watered bronze river; or of a vast aisle in some forest cathedral: and you hear, nearer to you than the voices of the people round, nearer than the roar of the city traffic, the sound of the surf that is breaking on the shore down there, and the sound of the wind talking on the hard palm leaves and the thump of the natives' tom- toms; or the cry of the parrots passing over the mangrove swamps in the evening time; or the sweet, long, mellow whistle of the plantain warblers calling up the dawn; and everything that is round you grows poor and thin in the face of the vision, and you want to go back to the Coast that is calling you, saying, as the African says to the departing soul of his dying friend, \"Come back, come back, this is your home.\"                                       M.

It was in 1893 that, for the first time in my life, I found myself in possession of five or six months which were not heavily forestalled, and feeling like a boy with a new half-crown, I lay about in my mind, as Mr. Bunyan would say, as to what to do with them.  \"Go and learn your tropics,\" said Science.  Where on earth am I to go? I wondered, for tropics are tropics wherever found, so I got down an atlas and saw that either South America or West Africa must be my destination, for the Malayan region was too far off and too expensive.  Then I got Wallace's Geographical Distribution and after reading that master's article on the Ethiopian region I hardened my heart and closed with West Africa.  I did this the more readily because while I knew nothing of the practical condition of it, I knew a good deal both by tradition and report of South East America, and remembered that Yellow Jack was endemic, and that a certain naturalist, my superior physically and mentally, had come very near getting starved to death in the depressing society of an expedition slowly perishing of want and miscellaneous fevers up the Parana.  My ignorance regarding West Africa was soon removed.  And although the vast cavity in my mind that it occupied is not even yet half filled up, there is a great deal of very curious information in its place.  I use the word curious advisedly, for I think many seemed to translate my request for practical hints and advice into an advertisement that \"Rubbish may be shot here.\"  This same information is in a state of great confusion still, although I have made heroic efforts to codify it.  I find, however, that it can almost all be got in under the following different headings, namely and to wit:  -  The dangers of West Africa. The disagreeables of West Africa. The diseases of West Africa. The things you must take to West Africa. The things you find most handy in West Africa. The worst possible things you can do in West Africa.  I inquired of all my friends as a beginning what they knew of West Africa.  The majority knew nothing.  A percentage said, \"Oh, you can't possibly go there; that's where Sierra Leone is, the white mans grave, you know.\"  If these were pressed further, one occasionally found that they had had relations who had gone out there after having been \"sad trials,\" but, on consideration of their having left not only West Africa, but this world, were now forgiven and forgotten.  I next turned my attention to cross-examining the doctors. \"Deadliest spot on earth,\" they said cheerfully, and showed me maps of the geographical distribution of disease.  Now I do not say that a country looks inviting when it is coloured in Scheele's green or a bilious yellow, but these colours may arise from lack of artistic gift in the cartographer.  There is no mistaking what he means by black, however, and black you'll find they colour West Africa from above Sierra Leone to below the Congo.  \"I wouldn't go there if I were you,\" said my medical friends, \"you'll catch something; but if you must go, and you're as obstinate as a mule, just bring me--\" and then followed a list of commissions from here to New York, any one of which--but I only found that out afterwards.  All my informants referred me to the missionaries.  \"There were,\" they said, in an airy way, \"lots of them down there, and had been for many years.\"  So to missionary literature I addressed myself with great ardour; alas! only to find that these good people wrote their reports not to tell you how the country they resided in was, but how it was getting on towards being what it ought to be, and how necessary it was that their readers should subscribe more freely, and not get any foolishness into their heads about obtaining an inadequate supply of souls for their money.  I also found fearful confirmation of my medical friends' statements about its unhealthiness, and various details of the distribution of cotton shirts over which I did not linger.  From the missionaries it was, however, that I got my first idea about the social condition of West Africa.  I gathered that there existed there, firstly the native human beings--the raw material, as it were--and that these were led either to good or bad respectively by the missionary and the trader.  There were also the Government representatives, whose chief business it was to strengthen and consolidate the missionary's work, a function they carried on but indifferently well.  But as for those traders! well, I put them down under the dangers of West Africa at once.  Subsequently I came across the good old Coast yarn of how, when a trader from that region went thence, it goes without saying where, the Fallen Angel without a moment's hesitation vacated the infernal throne (Milton) in his favour.  This, I beg to note, is the marine form of the legend.  When it occurs terrestrially the trader becomes a Liverpool mate.  But of course no one need believe it either way--it is not a missionary's story.  Naturally, while my higher intelligence was taken up with attending to these statements, my mind got set on going, and I had to go. Fortunately I could number among my acquaintances one individual who had lived on the Coast for seven years.  Not, it is true, on that part of it which I was bound for.  Still his advice was pre- eminently worth attention, because, in spite of his long residence in the deadliest spot of the region, he was still in fair going order.  I told him I intended going to West Africa, and he said, \"When you have made up your mind to go to West Africa the very best thing you can do is to get it unmade again and go to Scotland instead; but if your intelligence is not strong enough to do so, abstain from exposing yourself to the direct rays of the sun, take 4 grains of quinine every day for a fortnight before you reach the Rivers, and get some introductions to the Wesleyans; they are the only people on the Coast who have got a hearse with feathers.\"  My attention was next turned to getting ready things to take with me.  Having opened upon myself the sluice gates of advice, I rapidly became distracted.  My friends and their friends alike seemed to labour under the delusion that I intended to charter a steamer and was a person of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.  This not being the case, the only thing to do was to gratefully listen and let things drift.  Not only do the things you have got to take, but the things you have got to take them in, present a fine series of problems to the young traveller.  Crowds of witnesses testified to the forms of baggage holders they had found invaluable, and these, it is unnecessary to say, were all different in form and material.  With all this embarras de choix I was too distracted to buy anything new in the way of baggage except a long waterproof sack neatly closed at the top with a bar and handle.  Into this I put blankets, boots, books, in fact anything that would not go into my portmanteau or black bag.  From the first I was haunted by a conviction that its bottom would come out, but it never did, and in spite of the fact that it had ideas of its own about the arrangement of its contents, it served me well throughout my voyage.  It was the beginning of August '93 when I first left England for \"the Coast.\"  Preparations of quinine with postage partially paid arrived up to the last moment, and a friend hastily sent two newspaper clippings, one entitled \"A Week in a Palm-oil Tub,\" which was supposed to describe the sort of accommodation, companions, and fauna likely to be met with on a steamer going to West Africa, and on which I was to spend seven to The Graphic contributor's one; the other from The Daily Telegraph, reviewing a French book of \"Phrases in common use\" in Dahomey.  The opening sentence in the latter was, \"Help, I am drowning.\"  Then came the inquiry, \"If a man is not a thief?\" and then another cry, \"The boat is upset.\"  \"Get up, you lazy scamps,\" is the next"]]]
