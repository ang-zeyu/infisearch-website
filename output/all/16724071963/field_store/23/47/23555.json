Prompted by my anxiety lest Lee should get away some night before I was aware of it, and having the lead of me, push into North Carolina to join with Johnston in attempting to crush out Sherman, I had, as early as the 1st of the month of March, given instructions to the troops around Petersburg to keep a sharp lookout to see that such a movement should not escape their notice, and to be ready strike at once if it was undertaken.  It is now known that early in the month of March Mr. Davis and General Lee had a consultation about the situation of affairs in and about and Petersburg, and they both agreed places were no longer tenable for them, and that they must get away as soon as possible.  They, too, were waiting for dry roads, or a condition of the roads which would make it possible to move.  General Lee, in aid of his plan of escape, and to secure a wider opening to enable them to reach the Danville Road with greater security than he would have in the way the two armies were situated, determined upon an assault upon the right of our lines around Petersburg.  The night of the 24th of March was fixed upon for this assault, and General Gordon was assigned to the execution of the plan.  The point between Fort Stedman and Battery No. 10, where our lines were closest together, was selected as the point of his attack.  The attack was to be made at night, and the troops were to get possession of the higher ground in the rear where they supposed we had intrenchments, then sweep to the right and left, create a panic in the lines of our army, and force me to contract my lines.  Lee hoped this would detain me a few days longer and give him an opportunity of escape.  The plan was well conceived and the execution of it very well done indeed, up to the point of carrying a portion of our line.  Gordon assembled his troops under the cover of night, at the point at which they were to make their charge, and got possession of our picket-line, entirely without the knowledge of the troops inside of our main line of intrenchments; this reduced the distance he would have to charge over to not much more than fifty yards.  For some time before the deserters had been coming in with great frequency, often bringing their arms with them, and this the Confederate general knew.  Taking advantage of this knowledge he sent his pickets, with their arms, creeping through to ours as if to desert.  When they got to our lines they at once took possession and sent our pickets to the rear as prisoners. In the main line our men were sleeping serenely, as if in great security.  This plan was to have been executed and much damage done before daylight; but the troops that were to reinforce Gordon had to be brought from the north side of the James River and, by some accident on the railroad on their way over, they were detained for a considerable time; so that it got to be nearly daylight before they were ready to make the charge.  The charge, however, was successful and almost without loss, the enemy passing through our lines between Fort Stedman and Battery No. 10.  Then turning to the right and left they captured the fort and the battery, with all the arms and troops in them. Continuing the charge, they also carried batteries Eleven and Twelve to our left, which they turned toward City Point.  Meade happened to be at City Point that night, and this break in his line cut him off from all communication with his headquarters.  Parke, however, commanding the 9th corps when this breach took place, telegraphed the facts to Meade's headquarters, and learning that the general was away, assumed command himself and with commendable promptitude made all preparations to drive the enemy back.  General Tidball gathered a large number of pieces of artillery and planted them in rear of the captured works so as to sweep the narrow space of ground between the lines very thoroughly.  Hartranft was soon out with his division, as also was Willcox.  Hartranft to the right of the breach headed the rebels off in that direction and rapidly drove them back into Fort Stedman.  On the other side they were driven back into the intrenchments which they had captured, and batteries eleven and twelve were retaken by Willcox early in the morning.  Parke then threw a line around outside of the captured fort and batteries, and communication was once more established.  The artillery fire was kept up so continuously that it was impossible for the Confederates to retreat, and equally impossible for reinforcements to join them.  They all, therefore, fell captives into our hands.  This effort of Lee's cost him about four thousand men, and resulted in their killing, wounding and capturing about two thousand of ours.  After the recapture of the batteries taken by the Confederates, our troops made a charge and carried the enemy's intrenched picket line, which they strengthened and held.  This, in turn, gave us but a short distance to charge over when our attack came to be made a few days later.  The day that Gordon was making dispositions for this attack (24th of March) I issued my orders for the movement to commence on the 29th. Ord, with three divisions of infantry and Mackenzie's cavalry, was to move in advance on the night of the 27th, from the north side of the James River and take his place on our extreme left, thirty miles away. He left Weitzel with the rest of the Army of the James to hold Bermuda Hundred and the north of the James River.  The engineer brigade was to be left at City Point, and Parke's corps in the lines about Petersburg. (*42)  Ord was at his place promptly.  Humphreys and Warren were then on our extreme left with the 2d and 5th corps.  They were directed on the arrival of Ord, and on his getting into position in their places, to cross Hatcher's Run and extend out west toward Five Forks, the object being to get into a position from which we could strike the South Side Railroad and ultimately the Danville Railroad.  There was considerable fighting in taking up these new positions for the 2d and 5th corps, in which the Army of the James had also to participate somewhat, and the losses were quite severe.  This was what was known as the Battle of White Oak Road.    CHAPTER LXIV.  INTERVIEW WITH SHERIDAN--GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC --SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE ON FIVE FORKS--BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--PARKE AND WRIGHT STORM THE ENEMY'S LINE--BATTLES BEFORE PETERSBURG.  Sheridan reached City Point on the 26th day of March.  His horses, of course, were jaded and many of them had lost their shoes.  A few days of rest were necessary to recuperate the animals and also to have them shod and put in condition for moving.  Immediately on General Sheridan's arrival at City Point I prepared his instructions for the move which I had decided upon.  The movement was to commence on the 29th of the month.  After reading the instructions I had given him, Sheridan walked out of my tent, and I followed to have some conversation with him by himself --not in the presence of anybody else, even of a member of my staff.  In preparing his instructions I contemplated just what took place; that is to say, capturing Five Forks, driving the enemy from Petersburg and Richmond and terminating the contest before separating from the enemy. But the Nation had already become restless and discouraged at the prolongation of the war, and many believed that it would never terminate except by compromise.  Knowing that unless my plan proved an entire success it would be interpreted as a disastrous defeat, I provided in these instructions that in a certain event he was to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac and his base of supplies, and living upon the country proceed south by the way of the Danville Railroad, or near it, across the Roanoke, get in the rear of Johnston, who was guarding that road, and cooperate with Sherman in destroying Johnston; then with these combined forces to help carry out the instructions which Sherman already had received, to act in cooperation with the armies around Petersburg and Richmond.  I saw that after Sheridan had read his instructions he seemed somewhat disappointed at the idea, possibly, of having to cut loose again from the Army of the Potomac, and place himself between the two main armies of the enemy.  I said to him: \"General, this portion of your instructions I have put in merely as a blind;\" and gave him the reason for doing so, heretofore described.  I told him that, as a matter of fact, I intended to close the war right here, with this movement, and that he should go no farther.  His face at once brightened up, and slapping his hand on his leg he said:  \"I am glad to hear it, and we can do it.\"  Sheridan was not however to make his movement against Five Forks until he got further instructions from me.  One day, after the movement I am about to describe had commenced, and when his cavalry was on our extreme left and far to the rear, south, Sheridan rode up to where my headquarters were then established, at Dabney's Mills.  He met some of my staff officers outside, and was highly jubilant over the prospects of success, giving reasons why he believed this would prove the final and successful effort.  Although my chief-of-staff had urged very strongly that we return to our position about City Point and in the lines around Petersburg, he asked Sheridan to come in to see me and say to me what he had been saying to them. Sheridan felt a little modest about giving his advice where it had not been asked; so one of my staff came in and told me that Sheridan had what they considered important news, and suggested that I send for him. I did so, and was glad to see the spirit of confidence with which he was imbued. Knowing as I did from experience, of what great value that feeling of confidence by a commander was, I determined to make a movement at once, although on account of the rains which had fallen after I had started out the roads were still"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5865"],["title","Personal Memoirs of  U. S. Grant, Part 6. (#5)"],["body","heavy.  Orders were given accordingly.  Finally the 29th of March came, and fortunately there having been a few days free from rain, the surface of the ground was dry, giving indications that the time had come when we could move.  On that date I moved out with all the army available after leaving sufficient force to hold the line about Petersburg.  It soon set in raining again however, and in a very short time the roads became practically impassable for teams, and almost so for cavalry.  Sometimes a horse or mule would be standing apparently on firm ground, when all at once one foot would sink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet would sink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of the quicksands so common in that part of Virginia and other southern States.  It became necessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as we advanced, to move our artillery upon.  The army had become so accustomed to this kind of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was done very rapidly.  The next day, March 30th, we had made sufficient progress to the south-west to warrant me in starting Sheridan with his cavalry over by Dinwiddie with instructions to then come up by the road leading north-west to Five Forks, thus menacing the right of Lee's line.  This movement was made for the purpose of extending our lines to the west as far as practicable towards the enemy's extreme right, or Five Forks.  The column moving detached from the army still in the trenches was, excluding the cavalry, very small.  The forces in the trenches were themselves extending to the left flank. Warren was on the extreme left when the extension began, but Humphreys was marched around later and thrown into line between him and Five Forks.  My hope was that Sheridan would be able to carry Five Forks, get on the enemy's right flank and rear, and force them to weaken their centre to protect their right so that an assault in the centre might be successfully made.  General Wright's corps had been designated to make this assault, which I intended to order as soon as information reached me of Sheridan's success.  He was to move under cover as close to the enemy as he could get.  It is natural to suppose that Lee would understand my design to be to get up to the South Side and ultimately to the Danville Railroad, as soon as he had heard of the movement commenced on the 29th.  These roads were so important to his very existence while he remained in Richmond and Petersburg, and of such vital importance to him even in case of retreat, that naturally he would make most strenuous efforts to defend them.  He did on the 30th send Pickett with five brigades to reinforce Five Forks.  He also sent around to the right of his army some two or three other divisions, besides directing that other troops be held in readiness on the north side of the James River to come over on call.  He came over himself to superintend in person the defence of his right flank.  Sheridan moved back to Dinwiddie Court-House on the night of the 30th, and then took a road leading north-west to Five Forks.  He had only his cavalry with him.  Soon encountering the rebel cavalry he met with a very stout resistance.  He gradually drove them back however until in the neighborhood of Five Forks.  Here he had to encounter other troops besides those he had been contending with, and was forced to give way.  In this condition of affairs he notified me of what had taken place and stated that he was falling back toward Dinwiddie gradually and slowly, and asked me to send Wright's corps to his assistance.  I replied to him that it was impossible to send Wright's corps because that corps was already in line close up to the enemy, where we should want to assault when the proper time came, and was besides a long distance from him; but the 2d (Humphreys's) and 5th (Warren's) corps were on our extreme left and a little to the rear of it in a position to threaten the left flank of the enemy at Five Forks, and that I would send Warren.  Accordingly orders were sent to Warren to move at once that night (the 31st) to Dinwiddie Court House and put himself in communication with Sheridan as soon as possible, and report to him.  He was very slow in moving, some of his troops not starting until after 5 o'clock next morning.  When he did move it was done very deliberately, and on arriving at Gravelly Run he found the stream swollen from the recent rains so that he regarded it as not fordable.  Sheridan of course knew of his coming, and being impatient to get the troops up as soon as possible, sent orders to him to hasten.  He was also hastened or at least ordered to move up rapidly by General Meade.  He now felt that he could not cross that creek without bridges, and his orders were changed to move so as to strike the pursuing enemy in flank or get in their rear; but he was so late in getting up that Sheridan determined to move forward without him.  However, Ayres's division of Warren's corps reached him in time to be in the fight all day, most of the time separated from the remainder of the 5th corps and fighting directly under Sheridan.  Warren reported to Sheridan about 11 o'clock on the 1st, but the whole of his troops were not up so as to be much engaged until late in the afternoon.  Griffin's division in backing to get out of the way of a severe cross fire of the enemy was found marching away from the fighting.  This did not continue long, however; the division was brought back and with Ayres's division did most excellent service during the day.  Crawford's division of the same corps had backed still farther off, and although orders were sent repeatedly to bring it up, it was late before it finally got to where it could be of material assistance. Once there it did very excellent service.  Sheridan succeeded by the middle of the afternoon or a little later, in advancing up to the point from which to make his designed assault upon Five Forks itself.  He was very impatient to make the assault and have it all over before night, because the ground he occupied would be untenable for him in bivouac during the night.  Unless the assault was made and was successful, he would be obliged to return to Dinwiddie Court-House, or even further than that for the night.  It was at this junction of affairs that Sheridan wanted to get Crawford's division in hand, and he also wanted Warren.  He sent staff officer after staff officer in search of Warren, directing that general to report to him, but they were unable to find him.  At all events Sheridan was unable to get that officer to him.  Finally he went himself.  He issued an order relieving Warren and assigning Griffin to the command of the 5th corps. The troops were then brought up and the assault successfully made.  I was so much dissatisfied with Warren's dilatory movements in the battle of White Oak Road and in his failure to reach Sheridan in time, that I was very much afraid that at the last moment he would fail Sheridan.  He was a man of fine intelligence, great earnestness, quick perception, and could make his dispositions as quickly as any officer, under difficulties where he was forced to act.  But I had before discovered a defect which was beyond his control, that was very prejudicial to his usefulness in emergencies like the one just before us.  He could see every danger at a glance before he had encountered it. He would not only make preparations to meet the danger which might occur, but he would inform his commanding officer what others should do while he was executing his move.  I had sent a staff officer to General Sheridan to call his attention to these defects, and to say that as much as I liked General Warren, now was not a time when we could let our personal feelings for any one stand in the way of success; and if his removal was necessary to success, not to hesitate.  It was upon that authorization that Sheridan removed Warren.  I was very sorry that it had been done, and regretted still more that I had not long before taken occasion to assign him to another field of duty.  It was dusk when our troops under Sheridan went over the parapets of the enemy.  The two armies were mingled together there for a time in such manner that it was almost a question which one was going to demand the surrender of the other.  Soon, however, the enemy broke and ran in every direction; some six thousand prisoners, besides artillery and small-arms in large quantities, falling into our hands.  The flying troops were pursued in different directions, the cavalry and 5th corps under Sheridan pursuing the larger body which moved north-west.  This pursuit continued until about nine o'clock at night, when Sheridan halted his troops, and knowing the importance to him of the part of the enemy's line which had been captured, returned, sending the 5th corps across Hatcher's Run to just south-west of Petersburg, and facing them toward it.  Merritt, with the cavalry, stopped and bivouacked west of Five Forks.  This was the condition which affairs were in on the night of the 1st of April.  I then issued orders for an assault by Wright and Parke at four o'clock on the morning of the 2d.  I also ordered the 2d corps, General Humphreys, and General Ord with the Army of the James, on the left, to hold themselves in readiness to take any advantage that could be taken from weakening in their front.  I notified Mr. Lincoln at City Point of the success of the day; in fact I had reported to him during the day and evening as I got news, because he was so much interested in the movements taking place that I wanted to relieve his mind as much as I could.  I notified Weitzel on the north side of the James River, directing him, also, to keep close up to the enemy, and take advantage of the withdrawal of troops from there to promptly enter the city of Richmond.  I was afraid that Lee would regard the possession of Five Forks as of so much importance that he would "]]]
