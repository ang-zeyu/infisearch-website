I don’t like to see it—a little powder now and then is quite another thing.”  We were conversing like old friends now. I put another question.  “Did she seem nervous or upset at all?”  “Not a bit. She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she was amused at something. That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.”  “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?”  “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on, and, as my John says, money is money nowadays.”  I concurred heartily with John’s by no means original remarks.  “The young man now,” said Mrs. James, reverting suddenly to a former point in the conversation. “He was upset. His eyes, light eyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining. Excited, _I_ thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong. Not even when he came out again looking all queer.”  “How long was he in the house?”  “Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.”  “How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?”  “I should say so maybe.”  “He was clean-shaven, you say?”  “Yes, miss—not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.”  “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse.  Mrs. James stared at me with awe.  “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it _was._ However did you know?”  “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly.  Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith.  “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.”  “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?”  “Just the ordinary kind, miss. I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?”  I accepted them, and went on my way to the Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints.  The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance.  That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence my question to Mrs. James.  Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low old-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key, I passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn and mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had come here “smiling to herself” a few days ago feel no chill of premonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil.       CHAPTER VII   Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs. I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction. I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry.  There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully, but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue.  I had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor.  The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven. The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there was a cupboard. My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to the lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite window.  At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find!  I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking. It was just as dusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three days—that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any length of time, it would have been thickly coated.  Who had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films.  I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously. Was the smell of moth balls becoming an obsession with me? I could swear that the roll of films smelt of it also? I held them under my nose. They had, as usual, a strong smell of their own, but apart from that I could clearly detect the odour I disliked so much. I soon found the cause. A minute shred of cloth had caught on a rough edge of the centre wood, and that shred was strongly impregnated with moth balls. At some time or another the films had been carried in the overcoat pocket of the man who was killed in the Tube. Was it he who had dropped them here? Hardly. His movements were all accounted for.  No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman.  I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon.  Very elated, I left the house, returned the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before. But in that case I _must_ find out the whereabouts of Kilmorden Castle, for to-day was actually the 14th. Three days. Little enough—almost hopeless when one had no idea of where to look!  It was too late to hand in my roll to-day. I had to hurry home to Kensington so as not to be late for dinner. It occurred to me that there was an easy way of verifying whether some of my conclusions were correct. I asked Mr. Flemming whether there had been a camera amongst the dead man’s belongings. I knew that he had taken an interest in the case and was conversant with all the details.  To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera. All Carton’s effects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his state of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind.  That was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why should he be carrying a roll of films?  I set out early next morning to take my precious roll to be developed. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of each film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my roll.  He looked at me.  “You’ve made a mistake, I think,” he said, smiling."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61168"],["title","The Man in the Brown Suit (#7)"],["body","  “Oh, no,” I said. “I’m sure I haven’t.”  “You’ve given me the wrong roll. This is an _unexposed_ one.”  I walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is good for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be! But nobody relishes the process.  And then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices, I came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of one of the company’s boats, and it was labelled “Kenilworth Castle.” A wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went in. I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this time!) I murmured:  “Kilmorden Castle?”  “On the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?”  “How much is it?”  “First class, eighty-seven pounds——”  I interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly the amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket.  “First class,” I said.  I was now definitely committed to the adventure.       CHAPTER VIII     _(Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)_   It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace. I am a man who likes a quiet life. I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved. I hate being involved.  All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral.  Guy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working fellow, admirable in every respect. I know no one who annoys me more. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to get rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face. He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner—the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for them.  I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and airily—trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously. That is what makes him so difficult to live with.  Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence. He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there.  “My dear fellow,” I cried, “you shall go to-morrow. I will pay all your expenses.”  January isn’t the usual time for going to Florence, but it would be all one to Pagett. I could imagine him going about, guide-book in hand, religiously doing all the picture galleries. And a week’s freedom was cheap to me at the price.  It has been a delightful week. I have done everything I wanted to, and nothing that I did not want to do. But when I blinked my eyes open, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at the unearthly hour of 9 a.m. this morning, I realized that freedom was over.  “My dear fellow,” I said, “has the funeral already taken place, or is it for later in the morning?”  Pagett does not appreciate dry humour. He merely stared.  “So you know, Sir Eustace?”  “Know what?” I said crossly. “From the expression of your face I inferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred this morning.”  Pagett ignored the sally as far as possible.  “I thought you couldn’t know about this.” He tapped the telegram. “I know you dislike being aroused early—but it _is_ nine o’clock”—Pagett insists on regarding 9 a.m. as practically the middle of the day—“and I thought that under the circumstances——” He tapped the telegram again.  “What is that thing?” I asked.  “It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman has been murdered in your house.”  That aroused me in earnest.  “What colossal cheek,” I exclaimed. “Why in _my_ house? Who murdered her?”  “They don’t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once, Sir Eustace?”  “You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?”  “The police——”  “What on earth have I to do with the police?”  “Well, it was your house.”  “That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.”  Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily.  “It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he remarked lugubriously.  I don’t see why it should have—and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him—but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter.  “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily.  Again I believe he is right. If it is disreputable to have a woman murdered in your house, it becomes more disreputable if the woman is a foreigner. Another idea struck me.  “Good heavens,” I exclaimed, “I hope this won’t upset Caroline.”  Caroline is the lady who cooks for me. Incidentally she is the wife of my gardener. What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but she is an excellent cook. James, on the other hand, is not a good gardener—but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to live in solely on account of Caroline’s cooking.  “I don’t suppose she’ll stay after this,” said Pagett.  “You always were a cheerful fellow,” I said.  I expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends that I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify.  _Three days later._  It is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England in winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this trouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to impossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline has been pacified—with double pay. We could have sent her a cable to that effect from Cannes. In fact, as I have said all along, there was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall go back to-morrow.  _One day later._  Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts.  “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn.  “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate—very delicate.”  “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.”  He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion.  “My dear Pedler! The common post!”  It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’ Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents.  “If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.”  “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler—I assure you there are reasons.”  “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off——”  “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.”  “Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.”  “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?”  “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.”  “You would be doing the Government a great service—a very great service. You would not find them—er—ungrateful.”  “Meaning, you want me to be the postman?”  “Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is _bona fide._ Everything would be eminently satisfactory.”  “Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.”  “You will find the climate of South Africa delightful—quite delightful.”  “My dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there shortly before the war.”  “I am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round the package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts’s own hands, you understand? The _Kilmorden Castle_ sails on Saturday—quite a good boat.”  I accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He shook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively.  I walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental policy.  It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young men with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks.  Jarvis returned.  “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, "]]]
