Of this fact Bancroft remarks:      The Mexicans were much troubled and distressed by an eclipse of     the sun. They thought that he was much disturbed and tossed about     by something, and that he was becoming seriously jaundiced. This     was the occasion of a general panic, women weeping aloud, and men     howling and shouting and striking the hand upon the mouth. There     was an immediate search for men with white hair and white faces,     and these were sacrificed to the sun, amid the din and tumult of     singing and musical instruments. It was thought that should the     eclipse become once total, there would be an end of the light, and     that in the darkness the demons would come down to the devouring of     the people. [24]  It was also the traditional remembrance of the terror of darkness, connected with the death of Messiah, which undoubtedly created the anxiety concerning the renewal of fire at the conclusion of each cycle of fifty-two years recognized in the Mexican chronology. The Mexicans, as represented in some of the notes we have quoted from different authors, hold the tradition of the destruction of the world at four successive epochs. And, says, Prescott:      They looked forward confidently to another such catastrophy, to     take place like the preceding, at the close of a cycle, when the     sun was to be effaced from the heavens, the human race from the     earth, and when darkness of chaos was to settle on the habitable     globe. The cycle would end in the latter part of December, and,     as the dreary season of the winter solstice approached, and the     diminished light of day gave melancholy presage of its speedy     extinction their apprehensions increased; and on the arrival     of the five unlucky days which close the year, they abandoned     themselves to despair. They broke in pieces the little images of     their household gods, in whom they no longer trusted. The holy     fires were suffered to go out in the temples, and none were lighted     in their own dwellings. Their furniture and domestic utensils     were destroyed; their garments torn in pieces; and everything     was thrown into disorder, for the coming of the evil genii who     were to descend on the desolate earth. On the evening of the last     day, a procession of priests, assuming the dress and ornaments of     their gods, moved from the capital towards a lofty mountain, about     two leagues distant. They carried with them a noble victim, the     flower of their captivities, and an apparatus for kindling the     new fire, the success of which was an augury of the renewal of     the cycle. On reaching the summit of the mountain, the procession     paused till midnight; when, as the constellation of the Pleiades     approached the zenith, the new fire was kindled by the friction of     the sticks placed on the wounded breast of the victim. The flame     was soon communicated to a funeral pile, on which the body of the     slaughtered captive was thrown. As the light streamed up towards     heaven, shouts of joy and triumph burst forth from the countless     multitudes who covered the hills, the terraces of the temples and     the house-tops, with eyes anxiously bent on the mount of sacrifice.     Couriers, with torches lighted at the blazing beacon, rapidly bore     them over every part of the country; and the cheering element was     seen brightening on altar and hearthstone, for the circuit of many     a league, long before the sun, rising on his accustomed track,     gave assurance that a new cycle had commenced its march, and that     the laws of nature were not to be reversed for the Aztecs. The     following thirteen days were given up to festivity. [25]  Whence this terror of the darkness? Whence this rejoicing at the assurance of continued light, unless back of both terror and rejoicing somewhere in the history of the people there was some such circumstance as described in the Book of Mormon which gave cause for this terror of darkness on the one hand, and the rejoicing at the assurance of a continuation of light on the other?

After finishing his academic education he went to Spain where he was kindly received at court. He visited several other countries of Europe, made himself acquainted with their languages and returned home and devoted the rest of his life chiefly to the illustration of the national history and antiquities of his country. He composed various works, but his \"Antiquities of Mexico\" is the only one which went to press. His history covers the whole period from the first occupation of Aauhuac to the middle of the fifteenth century, at which time his labors were unfortunately terminated by his death, which occurred in 1780. In the early portion of his \"Antiquities\" he endeavored to trace the migratory movements and historic annals of the race who entered the country. \"Every page,\" remarks Prescott, \"bears testimony of the extent and fidelity of his researches.\" (Conquest of Mexico, Vol. I., p. 40.) The author of the history of the \"Antiquities of Mexico,\" tom. I., chapter ii, dates the first migration of the Nahuas from the year 2,237, after the creation\" quoted by Nadaillac \"Prehistoric America,\" p. 261. This date is somewhat in agreement with the time at which the Book of Mormon represents the Jaredites as arriving in the western world.  7. Adolf Bastian was born in June, 1826. He was a Prussian ethnologist of note, being professor of that science at Berlin, and demonstrator of the ethnological museum. He succeeded Virchow as president of the Berlin Anthropological society.

I.  _Messiah in the Western Hemisphere._  The appearance of Messiah in the western hemisphere, no less than the signs of his birth and death, is a circumstance that would undoubtedly find lodgment in the tradition of the native Americans. The manner of it, as described in the Book of Mormon, was as follows: It appears that a short time after the cataclysms which were the sign to the western world of Messiah's death, a number of people in the land Bountiful--a district of country in South America where the isthmus of Panama joins the south continent, and most likely including some part of that isthmus--were in the vicinity of a temple that had escaped destruction, and were conversing upon the many physical changes which had taken place in the land, and also of this same Jesus, of whose death they had received such appalling evidences, when--but let me quote the account of the event from the Book of Mormon:      And it came to pass that while they were conversing one with     another, they heard a voice as it came out of heaven; and they cast     their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which     they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud     voice; and notwithstanding it being a small voice, it did pierce     them that did hear to the centre, insomuch that there was no part     of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce     them to the very soul and did cause their hearts to burn. And it     came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood     it not;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59951"],["title","New Witnesses for God (Volume 3 of 3) (#4)"],["body","again the third time they did hear the voice, and did     open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound     thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence     the sound came; and behold the third time they did understand the     voice which they heard; and it said unto them, \"Behold my beloved     son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name:     hear ye him.\" And it came to pass as they understood, they cast     their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a man     descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe, and     he came down and stood in the midst of them, and the eyes of the     whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their     mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they     thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them. And it came to     pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people,     saying, Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified     should come into the world; and behold, I am the light and the life     of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the     Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon     me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of     the Father in all things from the beginning. And it came to pass     that when Jesus had spoken these words, the whole multitude fell to     the earth, for they remembered that it had been prophesied among     them that Christ should shew himself unto them after his ascension     into heaven. [1]  The task before us now is to ascertain if there is anything in the native American traditions which sustain the probability of this historical incident. Of course the reader must not be surprised if he finds the native traditions on such a subject very much confused. All such traditions, as I have before remarked, are so confused. Besides it must be remembered that there were several great characters among the inhabitants of the western world, according to the Book of Mormon, who would likely be confounded with Messiah in the native traditions; such as Moriancumr and Coriantumr among the Jaredites, the first and the last great leaders, respectively, of that ancient people. Then there is the first Nephi, Mulek, the first Mosiah, and several of the Lord's apostles chosen from among the Nephites that are likely to be confounded with Messiah and their mission with his ministry among the people. But notwithstanding this confusion, I think evidences of this advent of Messiah in the western world are traceable in the native traditions; and I should be much disappointed if I had found it otherwise, for of all incidents in Book of Mormon history, the advent of Messiah is the most important.  II.  _Of the Culture-Heroes of America._  Speaking of American \"culture-heroes\" in general, Bancroft says:      Although bearing various names and appearing in different     countries, the American culture-heroes all present the same general     characteristics. They are all described as white, bearded men,     generally clad in long robes; appearing suddenly and mysteriously     upon the scene of their labors, they at once set about improving     the people by instructing them in useful and ornamental arts,     giving them laws, exhorting them to practice brotherly love and     other Christian virtues, and introducing a milder and better form     of religion; having accomplished their mission, they disappear     as mysteriously and unexpectedly as they came; and finally,     they are apotheosized and held in great reverence by a grateful     posterity. In such guise or on such mission did Quetzalcohuatl     appear in Cholula, Votan in Chiapas, Wixepecocha in Ojaca, Zamna,     and Cukulcan with his nineteen disciples, in Yucatan, Gucumatz in     Guatemala, Viracocha in Peru, Sume and Paye-Tome in Brazil, the     mysterious apostle mentioned by Rosales, in Chili, and Bochica in     Colombia. Peruvian legends speak of a nation of giants who came by     sea, waged war with the natives, and erected splendid edifices,     the ruins of many of which still remain. Besides these, there are     numerous vague traditions of settlements or nations of white men,     who lived apart from the other people of the country, and were     possessed of an advanced civilization. [2]  I suggest, in passing, that the part of the tradition which relates to the existence \"of settlements or nations of white men who lived apart from the other people of the country, and were possessed of an advanced civilization,\" refers to those conditions that prevailed when the Nephites and Lamanites occupied the land; the former an industrious, civilized race, the latter an idle, savage race, conditions frequently referred to in the Book of Mormon, in describing the status of the Nephites and Lamanites, respectively.  Observe also that Bancroft, in the foregoing statement, says of some of the characters that, having accomplished their mission, they mysteriously disappeared. There are several such characters spoken of in the Book of Mormon. Such was the case with the second Alma, a noted Nephite character of the first half of the century immediately preceding the advent of Messiah. He was the first president or \"judge\" of the Nephite republic, also high priest of the Church, uniting in his person the two offices--a thing not unusual among the Nephites, [3] nor among the native Americans, if their annals may be trusted. [4] After completing his life's mission, and making a remarkable prediction concerning the destruction of the Nephite people, Alma departed out of the land, \"and it came to pass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial we know not of. Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord.\" [5] In a similar manner, Nephi, the father of Nephi, the apostle, a very noted Nephite leader and prophet, departed out of the land in the same mysterious manner. [6]  The quotation just made from Bancroft on the culture-heroes of America represents them as quite numerous; we shall see, however, as we proceed, that a number of them are the same person remembered in different countries under different names and titles, and that in the character and mission of each there is much similarity. Because of this similarity, however, it must not be supposed that it is my intention to claim each of these \"culture heroes\" as a more or less tradition-distorted representation of Messiah; and the life and mission of the culture-hero a distorted account of Messiah's advent and mission among the Nephites. Quite to the contrary, I believe that the traditions concerning some of these \"culture-heroes\" more nearly represent other Book of Mormon characters than they do Messiah. Such, for instance, is Votan, the supposed founder of the Maya confederation. Some things in his character and career make him more nearly resemble Moriancumr, the leader of the Jaredite colony, than Messiah. Bancroft, in one summary of the legends respecting him, says:      Votan, another mysterious personage, closely resembling     Quetzalcohuatl in many points, was the supposed founder of the     Maya civilization. He is said to have been a descendant of Noah and     to have assisted at the building of the Tower of Babel. After the     confusion of tongues he led a portion of the dispersed people to     America. There he established the kingdom of Xibalba and built the     city of Palenque. [7]  Then again, in some respects, Votan resembles the first Nephi. He is said to have come to America one thousand years B. C.; [8] Nephi came early in the sixth century B. C.; Votan brought with him seven families; the Nephite colony, as nearly as may be estimated, on reaching America, consisted of eight families. [9] Votan came to America by divine commandment; so, too, did the Nephite colony. [10] Votan wrote a book, in which he inscribed a complete record of all he had done; [11] so, also, did Nephi. [12] Votan united in his person the qualities of high priest and king; so, also, did Nephi.  After saying all this, however, it has to be admitted that there are some things in the legends concerning Votan which do not run parallel with the career of Nephi. Such, for instance, as his alleged visit to Spain, Rome, Jerusalem, where, in the latter place, he saw the temple of Solomon building; also his visit to the Euphrates valley, where he saw the unfinished Tower of Babel. The part of his story which describes his finding in America a colony of the same race as his own people, reminds one of the first Mosiah, who found the people of Zarahemla, in the valley of the Sidon. It will be remembered that these people came from Jerusalem, were Jews, and are known as the colony of Mulek. These varied legends concerning Votan resembling in the respects here pointed out the several Book of Mormon characters, lead one to regard as reasonable the supposition advanced by nearly all writers who speak of him, that Votan is a generic name; and that the legends which center about this name represent the exploits of several of America's culture-heroes, [13] and, as I believe, of several Book of Mormon characters.  III.  _The Peruvian Tradition of the Messiah._  The natives of Chili have the following tradition concerning one of their culture-heroes, which closely resembles Messiah as he was revealed to the Nephites:      Rosales, in his inedited (i. e. unpublished) History of Chili,     declares that the inhabitants of that extremely southern portion     of America, situated at the distance of so many thousand miles     from New Spain, and who did not employ paintings to record     events, accounted for their knowledge of some of the doctrines of     Christianity by saying, \"that in former times, as they had heard     their fathers say, a"]]]
