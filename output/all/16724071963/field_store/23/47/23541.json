I had not force enough at Corinth to attack Price even by stripping everything; and there was danger that before troops could be got from other points he might be far on his way across the Tennessee.  To prevent this all spare forces at Bolivar and Jackson were ordered to Corinth, and cars were concentrated at Jackson for their transportation.  Within twenty-four hours from the transmission of the order the troops were at their destination, although there had been a delay of four hours resulting from the forward train getting off the track and stopping all the others.  This gave a reinforcement of near 8,000 men, General Ord in command.  General Rosecrans commanded the district of Corinth with a movable force of about 9,000 independent of the garrison deemed necessary to be left behind.  It was known that General Van Dorn was about a four days' march south of us, with a large force.  It might have been part of his plan to attack at Corinth, Price coming from the east while he came up from the south.  My desire was to attack Price before Van Dorn could reach Corinth or go to his relief.  General Rosecrans had previously had his headquarters at Iuka, where his command was spread out along the Memphis and Charleston railroad eastward.  While there he had a most excellent map prepared showing all the roads and streams in the surrounding country.  He was also personally familiar with the ground, so that I deferred very much to him in my plans for the approach.  We had cars enough to transport all of General Ord's command, which was to go by rail to Burnsville, a point on the road about seven miles west of Iuka.  From there his troops were to march by the north side of the railroad and attack Price from the north-west, while Rosecrans was to move eastward from his position south of Corinth by way of the Jacinto road.  A small force was to hold the Jacinto road where it turns to the north-east, while the main force moved on the Fulton road which comes into Iuka further east.  This plan was suggested by Rosecrans.  Bear Creek, a few miles to the east of the Fulton road, is a formidable obstacle to the movement of troops in the absence of bridges, all of which, in September, 1862, had been destroyed in that vicinity.  The Tennessee, to the north-east, not many miles away, was also a formidable obstacle for an army followed by a pursuing force.  Ord was on the north-west, and even if a rebel movement had been possible in that direction it could have brought only temporary relief, for it would have carried Price's army to the rear of the National forces and isolated it from all support.  It looked to me that, if Price would remain in Iuka until we could get there, his annihilation was inevitable.  On the morning of the 18th of September General Ord moved by rail to Burnsville, and there left the cars and moved out to perform his part of the programme.  He was to get as near the enemy as possible during the day and intrench himself so as to hold his position until the next morning.  Rosecrans was to be up by the morning of the 19th on the two roads before described, and the attack was to be from all three quarters simultaneously.  Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi to detain any cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a sudden dash into Corinth until I could be notified.  There was a telegraph wire along the railroad, so there would be no delay in communication.  I detained cars and locomotives enough at Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord's command at once, and if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead of Iuka I could have thrown in reinforcements to the number of 7,000 or 8,000 before he could have arrived.  I remained at Burnsville with a detachment of about 900 men from Ord's command and communicated with my two wings by courier.  Ord met the advance of the enemy soon after leaving Burnsville.  Quite a sharp engagement ensued, but he drove the rebels back with considerable loss, including one general officer killed.  He maintained his position and was ready to attack by daylight the next morning.  I was very much disappointed at receiving a dispatch from Rosecrans after midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka, saying that some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear of his column was not yet up as far as Jacinto.  He said, however, that he would still be at Iuka by two o'clock the next day.  I did not believe this possible because of the distance and the condition of the roads, which was bad; besides, troops after a forced march of twenty miles are not in a good condition for fighting the moment they get through.  It might do in marching to relieve a beleaguered garrison, but not to make an assault.  I immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans' dispatch and ordered him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound of guns to the south or south-east.  He was instructed to notify his officers to be on the alert for any indications of battle. During the 19th the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit sound either towards the point where Ord was, or to Burnsville where I had remained.  A couple of hours before dark on the 19th Rosecrans arrived with the head of his column at garnets, the point where the Jacinto road to Iuka leaves the road going east.  He here turned north without sending any troops to the Fulton road.  While still moving in column up the Jacinto road he met a force of the enemy and had his advance badly beaten and driven back upon the main road.  In this short engagement his loss was considerable for the number engaged, and one battery was taken from him. The wind was still blowing hard and in the wrong direction to transmit sounds towards either Ord or me.  Neither he nor I nor any one in either command heard a gun that was fired upon the battle-field.  After the engagement Rosecrans sent me a dispatch announcing the result.  This was brought by a courier.  There was no road between Burnsville and the position then occupied by Rosecrans and the country was impassable for a man on horseback.  The courier bearing the message was compelled to move west nearly to Jacinto before he found a road leading to Burnsville. This made it a late hour of the night before I learned of the battle that had taken place during the afternoon.  I at once notified Ord of the fact and ordered him to attack early in the morning.  The next morning Rosecrans himself renewed the attack and went into Iuka with but little resistance.  Ord also went in according to orders, without hearing a gun from the south of town but supposing the troops coming from the south-west must be up by that time.  Rosecrans, however, had put no troops upon the Fulton road, and the enemy had taken advantage of this neglect and retreated by that road during the night.  Word was soon brought to me that our troops were in Iuka.  I immediately rode into town and found that the enemy was not being pursued even by the cavalry. I ordered pursuit by the whole of Rosecrans' command and went on with him a few miles in person.  He followed only a few miles after I left him and then went into camp, and the pursuit was continued no further. I was disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka--but I had so high an opinion of General Rosecrans that I found no fault at the time.    CHAPTER XXIX.  VAN DORN'S MOVEMENTS--BATTLE OF CORINTH--COMMAND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE.  On the 19th of September General Geo. H. Thomas was ordered east to reinforce Buell.  This threw the army at my command still more on the defensive.  The Memphis and Charleston railroad was abandoned, except at Corinth, and small forces were left at Chewalla and Grand Junction. Soon afterwards the latter of these two places was given up and Bolivar became our most advanced position on the Mississippi Central railroad. Our cavalry was kept well to the front and frequent expeditions were sent out to watch the movements of the enemy.  We were in a country where nearly all the people, except the negroes, were hostile to us and friendly to the cause we were trying to suppress.  It was easy, therefore, for the enemy to get early information of our every move. We, on the contrary, had to go after our information in force, and then often returned without it.  On the 22d Bolivar was threatened by a large force from south of Grand Junction, supposed to be twenty regiments of infantry with cavalry and artillery.  I reinforced Bolivar, and went to Jackson in person to superintend the movement of troops to whatever point the attack might be made upon.  The troops from Corinth were brought up in time to repel the threatened movement without a battle.  Our cavalry followed the enemy south of Davis' mills in Mississippi.  On the 30th I found that Van Dorn was apparently endeavoring to strike the Mississippi River above Memphis.  At the same time other points within my command were so threatened that it was impossible to concentrate a force to drive him away.  There was at this juncture a large Union force at Helena, Arkansas, which, had it been within my command, I could have ordered across the river to attack and break up the Mississippi Central railroad far to the south.  This would not only have called Van Dorn back, but would have compelled the retention of a large rebel force far to the south to prevent a repetition of such raids on the enemy's line of supplies.  Geographical lines between the commands during the rebellion were not always well chosen, or they were too rigidly adhered to.  Van Dorn did not attempt to get upon the line above Memphis, as had apparently been his intention.  He was simply covering a deeper design; one much more important to his cause.  By the 1st of October it was fully apparent that Corinth was to be attacked with great force and determination, and that Van Dorn, Lovell,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5862"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 3. (#4)"],["body",", Villepigue and Rust had joined their strength for this purpose.  There was some skirmishing outside of Corinth with the advance of the enemy on the 3d.  The rebels massed in the north-west angle of the Memphis and Charleston and the Mobile and Ohio railroads, and were thus between the troops at Corinth and all possible reinforcements.  Any fresh troops for us must come by a circuitous route.  On the night of the 3d, accordingly, I ordered General McPherson, who was at Jackson, to join Rosecrans at Corinth with reinforcements picked up along the line of the railroad equal to a brigade.  Hurlbut had been ordered from Bolivar to march for the same destination; and as Van Dorn was coming upon Corinth from the north-west some of his men fell in with the advance of Hurlbut's and some skirmishing ensued on the evening of the 3d.  On the 4th Van Dorn made a dashing attack, hoping, no doubt, to capture Rosecrans before his reinforcements could come up.  In that case the enemy himself could have occupied the defences of Corinth and held at bay all the Union troops that arrived.  In fact he could have taken the offensive against the reinforcements with three or four times their number and still left a sufficient garrison in the works about Corinth to hold them.  He came near success, some of his troops penetrating the National lines at least once, but the works that were built after Halleck's departure enabled Rosecrans to hold his position until the troops of both McPherson and Hurlbut approached towards the rebel front and rear.  The enemy was finally driven back with great slaughter:  all their charges, made with great gallantry, were repulsed.  The loss on our side was heavy, but nothing to compare with Van Dorn's.  McPherson came up with the train of cars bearing his command as close to the enemy as was prudent, debarked on the rebel flank and got in to the support of Rosecrans just after the repulse.  His approach, as well as that of Hurlbut, was known to the enemy and had a moral effect. General Rosecrans, however, failed to follow up the victory, although I had given specific orders in advance of the battle for him to pursue the moment the enemy was repelled.  He did not do so, and I repeated the order after the battle.  In the first order he was notified that the force of 4,000 men which was going to his assistance would be in great peril if the enemy was not pursued.  General Ord had joined Hurlbut on the 4th and being senior took command of his troops.  This force encountered the head of Van Dorn's retreating column just as it was crossing the Hatchie by a bridge some ten miles out from Corinth.  The bottom land here was swampy and bad for the operations of troops, making a good place to get an enemy into.  Ord attacked the troops that had crossed the bridge and drove them back in a panic.  Many were killed, and others were drowned by being pushed off the bridge in their hurried retreat.  Ord followed and met the main force.  He was too weak in numbers to assault, but he held the bridge and compelled the enemy to resume his retreat by another bridge higher up the stream.  Ord was wounded in this engagement and the command devolved on Hurlbut.  Rosecrans did not start in pursuit till the morning of the 5th and then took the wrong road.  Moving in the enemy's country he travelled with a wagon train to carry his provisions and munitions of war.  His march was therefore slower than that of the enemy, who was moving towards his supplies.  Two or three hours of pursuit on the day of battle, without anything except what the men carried on their persons, would have been worth more than any pursuit commenced the next day could have possibly been.  Even when he did start, if Rosecrans had followed the route taken by the enemy, he would have come upon Van Dorn in a swamp with a stream in front and Ord holding the only bridge; but he took the road leading north and towards Chewalla instead of west, and, after having marched as far as the enemy had moved to get to the Hatchie, he was as far from battle as when he started.  Hurlbut had not the numbers to meet any such force as Van Dorn's if they had been in any mood for fighting, and he might have been in great peril.  I now regarded the time to accomplish anything by pursuit as past and, after Rosecrans reached Jonesboro, I ordered him to return.  He kept on to Ripley, however, and was persistent in wanting to go farther.  I thereupon ordered him to halt and submitted the matter to the general-in-chief, who allowed me to exercise my judgment in the matter, but inquired \"why not pursue?\"  Upon this I ordered Rosecrans back.  Had he gone much farther he would have met a greater force than Van Dorn had at Corinth and behind intrenchments or on chosen ground, and the probabilities are he would have lost his army.  The battle of Corinth was bloody, our loss being 315 killed, 1,812 wounded and 232 missing.  The enemy lost many more. Rosecrans reported 1,423 dead and 2,225 prisoners.  We fought behind breastworks, which accounts in some degree for the disparity.  Among the killed on our side was General Hackelman.  General Oglesby was badly, it was for some time supposed mortally, wounded.  I received a congratulatory letter from the President, which expressed also his sorrow for the losses.  This battle was recognized by me as being a decided victory, though not so complete as I had hoped for, nor nearly so complete as I now think was within the easy grasp of the commanding officer at Corinth.  Since the war it is known that the result, as it was, was a crushing blow to the enemy, and felt by him much more than it was appreciated at the North.  The battle relieved me from any further anxiety for the safety of the territory within my jurisdiction, and soon after receiving reinforcements I suggested to the general-in-chief a forward movement against Vicksburg.  On the 23d of October I learned of Pemberton's being in command at Holly Springs and much reinforced by conscripts and troops from Alabama and Texas.  The same day General Rosecrans was relieved from duty with my command, and shortly after he succeeded Buell in the command of the army in Middle Tennessee.  I was delighted at the promotion of General Rosecrans to a separate command, because I still believed that when independent of an immediate superior the qualities which I, at that time, credited him with possessing, would show themselves.  As a subordinate I found that I could not make him do as I wished, and had determined to relieve him from duty that very day.  At the close of the operations just described my force, in round numbers, was 48,500.  Of these 4,800 were in Kentucky and Illinois, 7,000 in Memphis, 19,200 from Mound City south, and 17,500 at Corinth. General McClernand had been authorized from Washington to go north and organize troops to be used in opening the Mississippi.  These new levies with other reinforcements now began to come in.  On the 25th of October I was placed in command of the Department of the Tennessee.  Reinforcements continued to come from the north and by the 2d of November I was prepared to take the initiative.  This was a great relief after the two and a half months of continued defence over a large district of country, and where nearly every citizen was an enemy ready to give information of our every move.  I have described very imperfectly a few of the battles and skirmishes that took place during this time.  To describe all would take more space than I can allot to the purpose; to make special mention of all the officers and troops who distinguished themselves, would take a volume. (*9)    CHAPTER XXX.  THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST VICKSBURG--EMPLOYING THE FREEDMEN--OCCUPATION OF HOLLY SPRINGS--SHERMAN ORDERED TO MEMPHIS--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI--VAN DORN CAPTURES HOLLY SPRINGS--COLLECTING FORAGE AND FOOD.  Vicksburg was important to the enemy because it occupied the first high ground coming close to the river below Memphis.  From there a railroad runs east, connecting with other roads leading to all points of the Southern States.  A railroad also starts from the opposite side of the river, extending west as far as Shreveport, Louisiana.  Vicksburg was the only channel, at the time of the events of which this chapter treats, connecting the parts of the Confederacy divided by the Mississippi.  So long as it was held by the enemy, the free navigation of the river was prevented.  Hence its importance.  Points on the river between Vicksburg and Port Hudson were held as dependencies; but their fall was sure to follow the capture of the former place.  The campaign against Vicksburg commenced on the 2d of November as indicated in a dispatch to the general-in-chief in the following words: \"I have commenced a movement on Grand Junction, with three divisions from Corinth and two from Bolivar.  Will leave here [Jackson, Tennessee] to-morrow, and take command in person.  If found practicable, I will go to Holly Springs, and, may be, Grenada, completing railroad and telegraph as I go.\"  At this time my command was holding the Mobile and Ohio railroad from about twenty-five miles south of Corinth, north to Columbus, Kentucky; the Mississippi Central from Bolivar north to its junction with the Mobile and Ohio; the Memphis and Charleston from Corinth east to Bear Creek, and the Mississippi River from Cairo to Memphis.  My entire command was no more than was necessary to hold these lines, and hardly that if kept on the defensive.  By moving against the enemy and into his unsubdued, or not yet captured, territory, driving their army before us, these lines would nearly hold themselves; thus affording a large force for field operations.  My moving force at that time was about 30,000 men, and I estimated the enemy confronting me, under Pemberton, at about the same number.  General McPherson commanded my left wing and General C. S. Hamilton the centre, while Sherman was at Memphis with the"]]]
