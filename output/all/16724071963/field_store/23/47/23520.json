The night before General Lee had held a council with his principal generals, when it was arranged that in the morning General Gordon should undertake to break through my cavalry, and when I neared my troops this movement was beginning, a heavy line of infantry bearing down on us from the direction of the village.  In front of Crook and Mackenzie firing had already begun, so riding to a slight elevation where a good view of the Confederates could be had, I there came to the conclusion that it would be unwise to offer more resistance than that necessary to give Ord time to form, so I directed Merritt to fall back, and in retiring to shift Devin and Custer to the right so as to make room for Ord, now in the woods to my rear.  Crook, who with his own and Mackenzie's divisions was on my extreme left covering some by-roads, was ordered to hold his ground as long as practicable without sacrificing his men, and, if forced to retire, to contest with obstinacy the enemy's advance.  As already stated, I could not direct General Ord's course, he being my senior, but hastily galloping back to where he was, at the edge of the timber, I explained to him what was taking place at the front. Merritt's withdrawal inspired the Confederates, who forthwith began to press Crook, their line of battle advancing with confidence till it reached the crest whence I had reconnoitred them.  From this ground they could see Ord's men emerging from the woods, and the hopelessness of a further attack being plain, the gray lines instinctively halted, and then began to retire toward a ridge immediately fronting Appomattox Court House, while Ord, joined on his right by the Fifth Corps, advanced on them over the ground that Merritt had abandoned.  I now directed my steps toward Merritt, who, having mounted his troopers, had moved them off to the right, and by the time I reached his headquarters flag he was ready for work, so a move on the enemy's left was ordered, and every guidon was bent to the front.  As the cavalry marched along parallel with the Confederate line, and in toward its left, a heavy fire of artillery opened on us, but this could not check us at such a time, and we soon reached some high ground about half a mile from the Court House, and from here I could see in the low valley beyond the village the bivouac undoubtedly of Lee's army.  The troops did not seem to be disposed in battle order, but on the other side of the bivouac was a line of battleâa heavy rear-guardâconfronting, presumably, General Meade.  I decided to attack at once, and formations were ordered at a trot for a charge by Custer's and Devin's divisions down the slope leading to the camps.  Custer was soon ready, but Devin's division being in rear its formation took longer, since he had to shift further to the right; Devin's preparations were, therefore, but partially completed when an aide-decamp galloped up to with the word from Custer, \"Lee has surrendered; do not charge; the white flag is up.\"  The enemy perceiving that Custer was forming for attack, had sent the flag out to his front and stopped the charge just in time.  I at once sent word of the truce to General Ord, and hearing nothing more from Custer himself, I supposed that he had gone down to the Court House to join a mounted group of Confederates that I could see near there, so I, too, went toward them, galloping down a narrow ridge, staff and orderlies following; but we had not got half way to the Court House when, from a skirt of timber to our right, not more than three hundred yards distant, a musketry fire was opened on us.  This halted us, when, waving my hat, I called out to the firing party that we were under a truce, and they were violating it.  This did not stop them, however, so we hastily took shelter in a ravine so situated as to throw a ridge between us and the danger.     pb195.jpg (113K) Full Size    We traveled in safety down this depression to its mouth, and thence by a gentle ascent approached the Court House.  I was in advance, followed by a sergeant carrying my battleflag.  When I got within about a hundred and fifty yards of the enemy's line, which was immediately in front of the Court House, some of the Confederates leveled their pieces at us, and I again halted.  Their officers kept their men from firing, however, but meanwhile a single-handed contest had begun behind me, for on looking back I heard a Confederate soldier demanding my battle-flag from the color-bearer, thinking, no doubt, that we were coming in as prisoners.  The sergeant had drawn his sabre and was about to cut the man down, but at a word from me he desisted and carried the flag back to my staff, his assailant quickly realizing that the boot was on the other leg.  These incidents determined me to remain where I was till the return of a staff-officer whom I had sent over to demand an explanation from the group of Confederates for which I had been heading.  He came back in a few minutes with apologies for what had occurred, and informed me that General Gordon and General Wilcox were the superior officers in the group.  As they wished me to join them I rode up with my staff, but we had hardly met when in front of Merritt firing began. At the sound I turned to General Gordon, who seemed embarrassed by the occurrence, and remarked: \"General, your men fired on me as I was coming over here, and undoubtedly they are treating Merritt and Custer the same way.  We might as well let them fight it out.\"  He replied, \"There must be some mistake.\"  I then asked, \"Why not send a staff-officer and have your people cease firing; they are violating the flag.\" He answered, \"I have no staff-officer to send.\"  Whereupon I said that I would let him have one of mine, and calling for Lieutenant Vanderbilt Allen, I directed him to carry General Gordon's orders to General Geary, commanding a small brigade of South Carolina cavalry, to discontinue firing.  Allen dashed off with the message and soon delivered it, but was made a prisoner, Geary saying, \"I do not care for white flags: South Carolinians never surrender....\"  By this time Merritt's patience being exhausted, he ordered an attack, and this in short order put an end to General Geary's \"last ditch\" absurdity, and extricated Allen from his predicament.  When quiet was restored Gordon remarked: \"General Lee asks for a suspension of hostilities pending the negotiations which he is having with General Grant.\"  I rejoined: \"I have been constantly informed of the progress of the negotiations, and think it singular that while such discussions are going on, General Lee should have continued his march and attempted to break through my lines this morning.  I will entertain no terms except that General Lee shall surrender to General Grant on his arrival here.  If these terms are not accepted we will renew hostilities.\"  Gordon replied: \"General Lee's army is exhausted.  There is no doubt of his surrender to General Grant.\"  It was then that General Ord joined us, and after shaking hands all around, I related the situation to him, and Gordon went away agreeing to meet us again in half an hour.  When the time was up he came back accompanied by General Longstreet, who brought with him a despatch, the duplicate of one that had been sent General Grant through General Meade's lines back on the road over which Lee had been retreating.  General Longstreet renewed the assurances that already had been given by Gordon, and I sent Colonel Newhall with the despatch to find General Grant and bring him to the front.  When Newhall started, everything on our side of the Appomattox Court House was quiet, for inevitable surrender was at hand, but Longstreet feared that Meade, in ignorance of the new conditions on my front might attack the Confederate rearguard.  To prevent this I offered to send Colonel J. W. Forsyth through the enemy's lines to let Meade know of my agreement, for he too was suspicious that by a renewed correspondence Lee was endeavoring to gain time for escape.  My offer being accepted, Forsyth set out accompanied by Colonel Fairfax, of Longstreet's staff, and had no difficulty in accomplishing his mission.  About five or six miles from Appomattox, on the road toward Prospect Station near its intersection with the Walker's Church road, my adjutant-general, Colonel Newhall, met General Grant, he having started from north of the Appomattox River for my front the morning of April 9, in consequence of the following despatches which had been sent him the night before, after we had captured Appomattox Station and established a line intercepting Lee:   \"CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS, April 8, 1865â9:20 P. M.  \"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, \"Commanding Armies of the U.  S.  \"General: I marched early this morning from Buffalo Creek and Prospect Station on Appomattox Station, where my scouts had reported trains of cars with supplies for Lee's army.  A short time before dark General Custer, who had the advance, made a dash at the station, capturing four trains of supplies with locomotives.  One of the trains was burned and the others were run back toward Farmville for security.  Custer then pushed on toward Appomattox Court House, driving the enemyâwho kept up a heavy fire of artilleryâcharging them repeatedly and capturing, as far as reported, twenty-five pieces of artillery and a number of prisoners and wagons.  The First Cavalry Division supported him on the right.  A reconnoissance sent across the Appomattox reports the enemy moving on the Cumberland road to Appomattox Station, where they expect to get supplies.  Custer is still pushing on.  If General Gibbon and the Fifth Corps can get up to-night, we will perhaps finish the job in the morning.  I do not think Lee means to surrender until compelled to do so.  \"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.\"    \"HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, April 8, 1865â9:40 p.m.  \"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT. \"Commanding Armies U.

Sheridan, Volume 2, Part 5 (#7)"],["body","writing the accompanying despatch, General Custer reports that his command has captured in all thirty-five pieces of artillery, one thousand prisonersâincluding one general officerâand from one hundred and fifty to two hundred wagons.  \"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.\"  In attempting to conduct the lieutenant-general and staff back by a short route, Newhall lost his bearings for a time, inclining in toward the enemy's lines too far, but regained the proper direction without serious loss of time.  General Grant arrived about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, Ord and I, dismounted, meeting him at the edge of the town, or crossroads, for it was little more.  He remaining mounted, spoke first to me, saying simply,  \"How are you, Sheridan?\"  I assured him with thanks that I was \"first-rate,\" when, pointing toward the village, he asked, \"Is General Lee up there?\" and I replied: \"There is his army down in that valley, and he himself is over in that house (designating McLean's house) waiting to surrender to you.\"  The General then said, \"Come, let us go over,\" this last remark being addressed to both Ord and me. We two then mounted and joined him, while our staff-officers followed, intermingling with those of the general-in-chief as the cavalcade took its way to McLean's house near by, and where General Lee had arrived some time before, in consequence of a message from General Grant consenting to the interview asked for by Lee through Meade's front that morningâthe consent having been carried by Colonel Babcock.  When I entered McLean's house General Lee was standing, as was also his military secretary, Colonel Marshall, his only staff-officer present.  General Lee was dressed in a new uniform and wore a handsome sword.  His tall, commanding form thus set off contrasted strongly with the short figure of General Grant, clothed as he was in a soiled suit, without sword or other insignia of his position except a pair of dingy shoulder-straps.  After being presented, Ord and I, and nearly all of General Grant's staff, withdrew to await the agreement as to terms, and in a little while Colonel Babcock came to the door and said, \"The surrender had been made; you can come in again.\"  When we re-entered General Grant was writing; and General Lee, having in his hand two despatches, which I that morning requested might be returned, as I had no copies of them, addressed me with the remark: \"I am sorry.  It is probable that my cavalry at that point of the line did not fully understand the agreement.\" These despatches had been sent in the forenoon, after the fighting had been stopped, notifying General Lee that some of his cavalry in front of Crook was violating the suspension of hostilities by withdrawing.  About 3 o'clock in the afternoon the terms of surrender were written out and accepted, and General Lee left the house, as he departed cordially shaking hands with General Grant.  A moment later he mounted his chunky gray horse, and lifting his hat as he passed out of the yard, rode off toward his army, his arrival there being announced to us by cheering, which, as it progressed, varying in loudness, told he was riding through the bivouac of the Army of Northern Virginia.  The surrender of General Lee practically ended the war of the rebellion.  For four years his army had been the main-stay of the Confederacy; and the marked ability with which he directed its operations is evidenced both by his frequent successes and the length of time he kept up the contest.  Indeed, it may be said that till General Grant was matched against him, he never met an opponent he did not vanquish, for while it is true that defeat was inflicted on the Confederates at Antietam and Gettysburg, yet the fruits of these victories were not gathered, for after each of these battles Lee was left unmolested till he had a chance to recuperate.  The assignment of General Grant to the command of the Union armies in the winter of 1863-64 gave presage of success from the start, for his eminent abilities had already been proved, and besides, he was a tower of strength to the Government, because he had the confidence of the people.  They knew that henceforth systematic direction would be given to our armies in every section of the vast territory over which active operations were being prosecuted, and further, that this coherence, this harmony of plan, was the one thing needed to end the war, for in the three preceding years there had been illustrated most lamentable effects of the absence of system.  From the moment he set our armies in motion simultaneously, in the spring of 1864, it could be seen that we should be victorious ultimately, for though on different lines we were checked now and then, yet we were harassing the Confederacy at so many vital points that plainly it must yield to our blows.  Against Lee's army, the forefront of the Confederacy, Grant pitted himself; and it may be said that the Confederate commander was now, for the first time, overmatched, for against all his devicesâthe products of a mind fertile in defenseâGeneral Grant brought to bear not only the wealth of expedient which had hitherto distinguished him, but also an imperturbable tenacity, particularly in the Wilderness and on the march to the James, without which the almost insurmountable obstacles of that campaign could not have been overcome.  During it and in the siege of Petersburg he met with many disappointmentsâon several occasions the shortcomings of generals, when at the point of success, leading to wretched failures.  But so far as he was concerned, the only apparent effect of these discomfitures was to make him all the more determined to discharge successfully the stupendous trust committed to his care, and to bring into play the manifold resources of his well ordered military mind. He guided every subordinate then, and in the last days of the rebellion, with a fund of common sense and superiority of intellect, which have left an impress so distinct as to exhibit his great personality.  When his military history is analyzed after the lapse of years, it will show, even more clearly than now, that during these as well as in his previous campaigns he was the steadfast Centre about and on which everything else turned.

At Nottoway Court House I heard of the assassination of the President.  The first news came to us the night after the dastardly deed, the telegraph operator having taken it from the wires while in transmission to General Meade.  The despatch ran that Mr. Lincoln had been, shot at 10 o'clock that morning at Willard's Hotel, but as I could conceive of nothing to take the President there I set the story down as a canard, and went to bed without giving it further thought.  Next morning, however, an official telegram confirmed the fact of the assassination, though eliminating the distorted circumstances that had been communicated the night before.  When we reached Petersburg my column was halted, and instructions given me to march the cavalry and the Sixth Corps to Greensboro', North Carolina, for the purpose of aiding General Sherman (the surrender of General Johnston having not yet been effected), so I made the necessary preparations and moved on the 24th of April, arriving at South Boston, on the Dan River, the 28th, the Sixth Corps having reached Danville meanwhile.  At South Boston I received a despatch from General Halleck, who immediately after Lee's surrender had been assigned to command at Richmond, informing me that General Johnston had been brought to terms.  The necessity for going farther south being thus obviated we retraced our steps to Petersburg, from which place I proceeded by steamer to Washington, leaving, the cavalry to be marched thither by easy stages.  The day after my arrival in Washington an important order was sent me, accompanied by the following letter of instructions, transferring me to a new field of operations:   \"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES. \"Washington, D. C., May 17, 1865.  \"GENERAL: Under the orders relieving you from the command of the Middle Military Division and assigning you to command west of the Mississippi, you will proceed without delay to the West to arrange all preliminaries for your new field of duties.  \"Your duty is to restore Texas, and that part of Louisiana held by the enemy, to the Union in the shortest practicable time, in a way most effectual for securing permanent peace.  \"To do this, you will be given all the troops that can be spared by Major-General Canby, probably twenty-five thousand men of all arms; the troops with Major-General J.
