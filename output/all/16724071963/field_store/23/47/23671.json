He looked from Squire Green's mean, crafty face to his father's in anxiety and apprehension. Were all his bright dreams of future success to terminate in this?      CHAPTER VIII. HARRY'S DECISION   Squire Green rubbed his hands as if he had been proposing a plan with special reference to the interest of the Waltons. Really he conceived that it would save him a considerable sum of money. He had in his employ a young man of eighteen, named Abner Kimball, to whom he was compelled to pay ten dollars a month. Harry, he reckoned, could be made to do about as much, though on account of his youth he had offered him but two dollars, and that not to be paid in cash.  Mr. Walton paused before replying to his proposal.  \"You're a little too late,\" he said, at last, to Harry's great relief.  \"Too late!\" repeated the squire, hastily. \"Why, you hain't hired out your boy to anybody else, have you?\"  \"No; but he has asked me to let him leave home, and I've agreed to it.\"  \"Leave home? Where's he goin'?\"  \"He has not fully decided. He wants to go out and seek his fortune.\"  \"He'll fetch up at the poorhouse,\" growled the squire.  \"If he does not succeed, he will come home again.\"  \"It's a foolish plan, neighbor Walton. Take my word for't. You'd better keep him here, and let him work for me.\"  \"If he stayed at home, I should find work for him on my farm.\"  Mr. Walton would not have been willing to have Harry work for the squire, knowing well his meanness, and how poorly he paid his hired men.  \"I wanted to help you pay for that cow,\" said the squire, crossly. \"If you can't pay for't when the time comes you mustn't blame me.\"  \"I shall blame no one. I can't foresee the future; but I hope to get together the money somehow.\"  \"You mustn't ask for more time. Six months is a long time to give.\"  \"I believe I haven't said anything about more time yet, Squire Green,\" said Hiram Walton, stiffly. \"I don't see that you need warn me.\"  \"I thought we might as well have an understandin' about it,\" said the squire. \"So you won't hire out the boy?\"  \"No, I cannot, under the circumstances. If I did I should consider his services worth more than two dollars a month.\"  \"I might give him two'n a half,\" said the squire, fancying it was merely a question of money.  \"How much do you pay Abner Kimball?\"  \"Wal, rather more than that,\" answered the squire, slowly.  \"You pay him ten dollars a month, don't you?\"  \"Wal, somewheres about that; but it's more'n he earns.\"  \"If he is worth ten dollars, Harry would be worth four or six.\"  \"I'll give three,\" said the squire, who reflected that even at that rate he would be saving considerable.  \"I will leave it to Harry himself,\" said his father.  \"Harry, you hear Squire Green's offer. What do you say? Will you go to work for him at three dollars a month?\"  \"I'd rather go away, as you told me I might, father.\"  \"You hear the boy's decision, squire.\"  \"Wal, wal,\" said the squire, a good deal disappointed--for, to tell the truth, he had told Abner he should not want him, having felt confident of obtaining Harry. \"I hope you won't neither of ye regret it.\"  His tone clearly indicated that he really hoped and expected they would. \"I bid ye good night.\"  \"I'll hev the cow back ag'in,\" said the squire to himself. \"He needn't hope no massy. If he don't hev the money ready for me when the time is up, he shan't keep her.\"  The next morning he was under the unpleasant necessity of reengaging Abner.  \"Come to think on't, Abner,\" he said, \"I guess I'd like to hev you stay longer. There's more work than I reckoned, and I guess I'll hev to have somebody.\"  This was at the breakfast table. Abner looked around him, and after making sure that there was nothing eatable left, put down his knife and fork with the air of one who could have eaten more, and answered, deliberately: \"Ef I stay I'll hev to hev more wages.\"  \"More wages?\" repeated Squire Green, in dismay. \"More'n ten dollars?\"  \"Yes, a fellow of my age orter hey more'n that.\"  \"Ten dollars is a good deal of money.\"  \"I can't lay up a cent off'n it.\"  \"Then you're extravagant.\"  \"No I ain't. I ain't no chance to be. My cousin, Paul Bickford, is gettin' fifteen dollars, and he ain't no better worker'n I am.\"  \"Fifteen dollars!\" ejaculated, the squire, as if he were naming some extraordinary sum. \"I never heerd of such a thing.\"  \"I'll work for twelve'n a half,\" said Abner, \"and I won't work for no less.\"  \"It's too much,\" said the squire. \"Besides, you agreed to come for ten.\"  \"I know I did; but this is a new engagement.\"  Finally Abner reduced his terms to twelve dollars, an advance of two dollars a month, to which the squire was forced to agree, though very reluctantly. He thought, with an inward groan, that but for his hasty dismissal of Abner the night before, on the supposition that he could obtain Harry in his place, he would not have been compelled to raise Abner's wages. This again resulted indirectly from selling the cow, which had put the new plan into his head. When the squire reckoned up this item, amounting in six months to twelve dollars, he began to doubt whether his cow trade had been quite so good after all.  \"I'll get it out of Hiram Walton some way,\" he muttered. \"He's a great fool to let that boy have his own way. I thought to be sure he'd oblige me arter the favor I done him in sellin' him the cow. There's gratitude for you!\"  The squire's ideas about gratitude, and the manner in which he had earned it, were slightly mixed, it must be acknowledged. But, though he knew very well that he had been influenced only by the consideration of his own interest, he had a vague idea that he was entitled to some credit for his kindness in consenting to sell his neighbor a cow at an extortionate price.  Harry breathed a deep sigh of relief after Squire Green left the room.  \"I was afraid you were going to hire me out to the squire, father,\" he said.  \"You didn't enjoy the prospect, did you?\" said his father, smiling.  \"Not much.\"  \"Shouldn't think he would,\" said his brother Tom.  \"The squire's awful stingy. Abner Kimball told me he had the meanest breakfast he ever ate anywhere.\"  \"I don't think any of his household are in danger of contracting the gout from luxurious living.\"  \"I guess not,\" said Tom.  \"I think,\" said Jane, slyly, \"you'd better hire out Tom to the squire.\"  \"The squire would have the worst of the bargain,\" said his father, with a good-natured hit at Tom's sluggishness.  \"He wouldn't earn his board, however poor it might be.\"  \"The squire didn't seem to like it very well,\" said Mrs. Walton, looking up from her mending.  \"No, he fully expected to get Harry for little or nothing. It was ridiculous to offer two dollars a month for a boy of his age.\"  \"I am afraid he will be more disposed to be hard on you, when the time comes to pay for the cow. He told you he wouldn't extend the time.\"  \"He is not likely to after this; but, wife, we won't borrow trouble. Something may turn up to help us.\"  \"I am sure I shall be able to help you about it, father,\" said Harry.  \"I hope so, my son, but don't feel too certain. You may not succeed as well as you anticipate.\"  \"I know that, but I mean to try at any rate.\"  \"If you don't, Tom will,\" said his sister.  \"Quit teasin' a feller, Jane,\" said Tom. \"I ain't any lazier'n you are. If I am, I'll eat my head.\"  \"Then you'll have to eat it, Tom,\" retorted Jane; \"and it won't be much loss to you, either.\"  \"Don't dispute, children,\" said Mrs. Walton. \"I expect you both will turn over a new leaf by and by.\"  Meanwhile, Harry was busily reading the \"Life of Franklin.\" The more he read, the more hopeful he became as to the future.      CHAPTER IX. LEAVING HOME   Monday morning came, and the whole family stood on the grass plat in front of the house, ready to bid Harry good-by. He was encumbered by no trunk, but carried his scanty supply of clothing wrapped in a red cotton handkerchief, and not a very heavy bundle at that. He had cut a stout stick in the woods near by, and from the end of this suspended over his back bore the bundle which contained all his worldly fortune except the twenty-five cents which was in his vest pocket.  \"I don't like to have you go,\" said his mother, anxiously. \"Suppose you don't get work?\"  \"Don't worry about me, mother,\" said Harry, brightly. \"I'll get along somehow.\"  \"Remember you've got a home here, Harry, whatever happens,\" said his father.  \"I shan't forget, father.\"  \"I wish I was going with you,\" said Tom, for the first time fired with the spirit of adventure.  \"What could you do, Tom?\" said Jane, teasingly.  \"Work, of course.\"  \"I never saw you do it yet.\"  \"I'm no more lazy than you,\" retorted Tom, offended.  \"Don't dispute, children, just as your brother is leaving us,\" said Mrs. Walton.  \"Good-by, mother,\" said Harry, feeling an unwonted moistening of the eyes, as he reflected that he was about to leave the house in which he had lived since infancy.  \"Good-by, my dear child,\" said his mother, kissing him.  \"Be sure to write.\"  \"Yes I will.\"  So with farewell greetings Harry walked out into the world. He had all at once assumed a man's responsibilities, and his face grew serious, as he began to realize that he must now look out for himself.  His native village was situated in the northern part of New Hampshire. Not far away could be seen, indistinct in the distance, the towering summits of the White Mountain range, but his back was turned to them. In the south were larger and more thriving villages, and the wealth was greater. Harry felt that his chances would be greater there. Not that he had any particular place in view. Wherever there was an opening, he meant to stop.  \"I won't come back till I am better off,\" he said to himself. \"If I don't succeed it won't be for want of trying.\"  He walked five miles"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5977"],["title","Bound to Rise; Or, Up the Ladder (#7)"],["body","stopping. This brought him to the middle of the next town. He was yet on familiar ground, for he had been here more than once. He felt tired, and sat down by the roadside to rest before going farther. While he sat there the doctor from his own village rode by, and chanced to espy Harry, whom he recognized.  \"What brings you here, Harry?\" he asked, stopping his chaise.  \"I'm going to seek my fortune,\" said Harry.  \"What, away from home?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I hadn't heard of that,\" said the doctor, surprised.  \"You haven't run away from home?\" he asked, with momentary suspicion.  \"No, indeed!\" said Harry, half indignantly. \"Father's given his permission for me to go.\"  \"Where do you expect to go?\"  \"South,\" said Harry, vaguely.  \"And what do you expect to find to do?\"  \"I don't know--anything that'll bring me a living.\"  \"I like your spunk,\" said the doctor, after a pause. \"If you're going my way, as I suppose you are, I can carry you a couple of miles. That's better than walking, isn't it?\"  \"I guess it is,\" said Harry, jumping to his feet with alacrity.  In a minute he was sitting beside Dr. Dunham in his old-fashioned chaise. \"I might have known that you were not running away,\" said the doctor. \"I should be more likely to suspect your Brother Tom.\"  \"Tom's too lazy to run away to earn his own living,\" said Harry, laughing, \"as long as he can get it at home.\"  The doctor smiled.  \"And what put it into your head to start out in this way?\" he asked.  \"The first thing, was reading the' Life of Franklin.'\"  \"To be sure. I remember his story.\"  \"And the next thing was, because my father is so poor. He finds it hard work to support us all. The farm is small, and the land is poor. I want to help him if I can.\"  \"Very commendable, Harry,\" said the doctor, kindly.  \"You owe a debt of gratitude to your good father, who has not succeeded so well in life as he deserves.\"  \"That's true, sir. He has always been a hard-working man.\"  \"If you start out with such a good object, I think you will succeed. Have you any plans at all, or any idea what you would like to do?\"  \"I thought I should like to work in a shoe shop, if I got a chance,\" said Harry.  \"You like that better than working on a farm, then?\"  \"Yes, sir, There isn't much money to be earned by working on a farm. I had a chance to do that before I came away.\"  \"You mean working on your father's land, I suppose?\"  \"No, Squire Green wanted to hire me.\"  \"What wages did he offer?\"  \"Two dollars a month, at first. Afterwards he got up to three.\"  The doctor smiled.  \"How could you decline such a magnificent offer?\" he asked.  \"I don't think I should like boarding at the squire's.\"  \"A dollar is twice as large at least in his eyes as in those of anyone else.\"  By this time they had reached a place where a road turned at right angles.  \"I am going down here, Harry,\" said the doctor. \"I should like to have you ride farther, but I suppose it would only be taking you out of your course.\"  \"Yes, doctor. I'd better get out.\"  \"I'll tell your father I saw you.\"  \"Tell him I was in good spirits,\" said Harry, earnestly. \"Mother'll be glad to know that.\"  \"I will certainly. Good-by!\"  \"Good-by, doctor. Thank you for the ride.\"  \"You are quite welcome to that, Harry.\"  Harry followed with his eyes the doctor's chaise. It seemed like severing the last link that bound him to his native village. He was very glad to have fallen in with the doctor, but it seemed all the more lonesome that he had left him.  Harry walked six miles farther, and then decided that it was time to rest again. He was not only somewhat fatigued, but decidedly hungry, although it was but eleven o'clock in the forenoon. However, it must be considered that he had walked eleven miles, and this was enough to give anyone an appetite.  He sat down again beside the road, and untying the handkerchief which contained his worldly possessions, he drew therefrom a large slice of bread and began to eat with evident relish. There was a slice of cold meat also, which he found tasted particularly good.  \"I wonder whether they are thinking of me at home,\" he said to himself.  They were thinking about him, and when an hour later the family gathered around the table, no one seemed to have much appetite. All looked sober, for all were thinking of the absent son and brother.  \"I wish Harry was here,\" said Jane, at length, giving voice to the general feeling.  \"Poor boy,\" sighed his mother. \"I'm afraid he'll have a hard time. I wish he had stayed at home, or even have gone to Squire Green's to work. Then we could have seen him every day.\"  \"I should have pitied him more if he had gone there than I do now,\" said his father. \"Depend upon it, it; will be better for him in the end.\"  \"I hope so,\" said his mother, dubiously.  \"But you don't feel sure? Well, time will show. We shall hear from him before long.\"  We go back to Harry.  He rested for a couple of hours, sheltered from the sun by the foliage of the oak beneath which he had stretched himself. He whiled away the time by reading for the second time some parts of the \"Life of Franklin,\" which he had brought away in his bundle, with his few other possessions. It seemed even more interesting to him now that he, too, like Franklin, had started out in quest for fortune.  He resumed walking, but we will not dwell upon the details of his journey. At six o'clock he was twenty-five miles from home. He had not walked much in the afternoon when, all at once, he was alarmed by the darkening of the sky. It was evident that a storm was approaching. He looked about him for shelter from the shower, and a place where he could pass the night.      CHAPTER X. THE GENERAL   The clouds were darkening, and the shower was evidently not far off. It was a solitary place, and no houses were to be seen near by. But nearly a quarter of a mile back Harry caught sight of a small house, and jumping over the fence directed his steps toward it. Five minutes brought him to it. It was small, painted red, originally, but the color had mostly been washed away. It was not upon a public road, but there was a narrow lane leading to it from the highway. Probably it was occupied by a poor family, Harry thought. Still it would shelter him from the storm which had even now commenced.  He knocked at the door.  Immediately it was opened and a face peered out--the face of a man advanced in years. It was thin, wrinkled, and haggard. The thin white hair, uncombed, gave a wild appearance to the owner, who, in a thin, shrill voice, demanded, \"Who are you?\"  \"My name is Harry Walton.\"  \"What do you want?\"  \"Shelter from the storm. It is going to rain.\"  \"Come in,\" said the old man, and opening the door wider, he admitted our hero.  Harry found himself in a room very bare of furniture, but there was a log fire in the fireplace, and this looked comfortable and pleasant. He laid down his bundle, and drawing up a chair sat down by it, his host meanwhile watching him closely.  \"Does he live alone, I wonder?\" thought Harry.  He saw no other person about, and no traces of a woman's presence. The floor looked as if it had not been swept for a month, and probably it had not.  The old man sat down opposite Harry, and stared at him, till our hero felt somewhat embarrassed and uncomfortable.  \"Why don't he say something?\" thought Harry.  \"He is a very queer old man.\"  After a while his host spoke.  \"Do you know who I am?\" he asked.  \"No,\" said Harry, looking at him.  \"You've heard of me often,\" pursued the old man.  \"I didn't know it,\" answered Harry, beginning to feel curious.  \"In history,\" added the other.  \"In history?\"  \"Yes.\"  Harry began to look at him in increased surprise.  \"Will you tell me your name, if it is not too much trouble,\" he asked, politely.  \"I gained the victory of New Orleans,\" said the old man.  \"I thought General Jackson did that,\" said Harry.  \"You're right,\" said the old man, complacently. \"I am General Jackson.\"  \"But General Jackson is dead.\"  \"That's a mistake,\" said the old man, quietly. \"That's what they say in all the books, but it isn't true.\"  This was amusing, but it was also startling. Harry knew now that the old man was crazy, or at least a monomaniac, and, though he seemed harmless enough, it was of course possible that he might be dangerous. He was almost sorry that he had sought shelter here. Better have encountered the storm in its full fury than place himself in the power of a maniac. The rain was now falling in thick drops, and he decided at any rate to remain a while longer. He knew that it would not be well to dispute the old man, and resolved to humor his delusion.  \"You were President once, I believe?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" said the old man; \"and you won't tell anybody, will you?\"  \"No.\"  \"I mean to be again,\" said the old man in a low voice, half in a whisper. \"But you mustn't say anything about it. They'd try to kill me, if they knew it.\"  \"Who would?\"  \"Mr. Henry Clay, and the rest of them.\"  \"Doesn't Henry Clay want you to be President again?\"  \"Of course not. He wants to be President himself. That's why I'm hiding. They don't any of them know where I am. You won't tell, will you?\"  \"No.\"  \"You might meet Henry Clay, you know.\"  Harry smiled to himself. It didn't seem very likely that he would ever find himself in such distinguished company, for Henry Clay was at that time living, and a United States Senator.  \"What made you come here, General Jackson?\" he inquired.  The old man brightened, on being called by this name.  \"Because it was quiet. They can't find me here.\"  \"When do you expect to be President again?\"  \"Next year,\" said the old man. \"I've got it all arranged. My friends are to blow up the capitol, and I shall ride into Washington on a white horse. Do you want an office?\"  \"I don't know but I should like one,\" said Harry, amused.  \"I'll see what I can do for you,\" said the old man, seriously. \"I can't put you in my Cabinet. That's all arranged. If you would like to be Minister to"]]]
