We are not spying on you or anybody, and if you--\"  Dick was permitted to go no further.  While Bill Goss was speaking the _Spray_ had been caught by a sudden puff of wind and sent over to starboard.  Now the _Falcon_ came on swiftly, and in an instant her sharp bow crashed into the Rover boy's boat. The shock of the collision caused the _Spray_ to shiver from stem to stern, and then, with a jagged hole in her side, she began to slowly sink.     CHAPTER II  THE ENCOUNTER ON THE RIVER   For the instant after the collision occurred none of the Rover boys uttered a word.  Tom and Sam stared in amazement at Mumps, while Dick gazed helplessly at the damage done.  \"Pull her away, quick, Bill!\" cried Mumps in a low voice to the old sailor, who at once sprang forward and shoved the two yachts apart with a long boathook.  Then the rudder of the _Falcon_ was put hard a port, and she swung, away for a distance of half a dozen yards.  \"We are sinking!\" gasped Tom, who was the first of the three brothers to find his voice.  \"Mumps, you rascal, what do you mean by this work?\" demanded Dick.  And then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to Sam. \"Steer for the shore and beach her--if you can.\"  \"I don't believe we can make it, Dick.  But we can try.\"  \"We'll have you locked up for this, Mumps,\" shouted Tom.  \"I couldn't help it--it was an accident,\" returned the former sneak of Putnam Hall glibly.  \"You should have kept out of the way.\"  \"We'll see about that later on.\"  \"Maybe you want us to help you.\"  \"We shan't ask you for the favor,\" burst out Sam.  \"I'd rather drown first.\"  But Sam did not exactly mean this.  He and his brothers could all swim, and he felt certain that they were in no immediate danger of their lives.  \"You had better not ask any favors.  I wouldn't pick you up for a barrel of money.\"  \"I think we'll have to settle this in court, Mumps,\" said Dick, as quietly as he could.  \"You can't prove I ran you down.\"  \"Don't you dare to have us hauled up,\" put in Bill Goss.  \"It was an accident, jest as John says.  I reckon as how it will teach ye a lesson not to follow us ag'in.\"  By this time the two yachts were once more so far apart that talking from one to the other became difficult.  Besides this, the Rover boys felt that they must turn their whole attention to the _Spray_, so no more was said.  The yacht had been struck just at the water line and the hole made in her side was all of six inches in diameter.  Through this the water was pouring into the hold at a lively rate.  \"We're going down as sure as guns,\" groaned Tom.  \"Steer her right for the shore, Sam.\"  This was done, and just as the _Spray_ began to settle they ran upon a muddy and rocky flat about thirty feet from the river bank proper.  \"There, we can't go down now,\" said Dick, with something of a sigh of relief.  \"Let us lower the mainsail and jib before the wind sends us over on our beam ends.\"  The others understood the value of the advice, and soon the mainsail of the yacht came down with a bang, and the jib followed.  The _Spray_ seemed inclined to list to port, but stopped settling when her deck line touched the surface of the river.  \"That settles yachting for the present,\" said Dick in deep disgust.  \"And the worst of it is, we haven't even a small boat to go ashore in,\" added Sam.  \"What's to do?\"  \"There is a rowboat putting out from the shore now,\" cried Tom. \"Hullo, there!\" he shouted, and waved his hand.  The shout was returned, and the rowboat was headed, in their direction.  As it came closer they saw that its occupant was a middle-aged man of pleasant appearance.  \"So you had a smash-up, eh?\" shouted the man, as soon as he came near.  \"Anybody hurt?\"  \"Our boat is hurt,\" answered Tom dryly.  \"Much of a hole?\"  \"Big enough to put us on the bottom.\"  \"So I see.  Want me to take you ashore?\"  \"Yes,\" put in Dick, \"if you will be kind enough to do it.\"  \"Certainly; always willing to aid anybody in distress.  That other craft run you down in short order, didn't she?\"  \"Did you see it?\" burst out Sam eagerly.  \"To be sure I did.\"  \"Then you know it was her fault.\"  \"I do.  She had no right to follow you up as she did.\"  \"I'm glad you saw the mix-up, Mr...\"  \"Martin Harris is my name. I'm an old boatman around here--keep boats to hire, and the like. And who is this I'm to take ashore?\"  \"My name is Sam Rover.  These are my two brothers, Dick and Tom.\"  \"Do you know who it was ran into you?\"  \"It was the _Falcon_, a yacht owned by a Mr. Fenwick.  His son and a man he called Bill Goss were aboard.\"  At this Martin Harris drew down his mouth.  \"A bad set, those. I know 'em well.\"  \"And we know, Fenwick, too,\" put in Dick, \"He's a regular sneak.\"  \"That's right--takes after his father, who did his best to defraud me in a boat deal.  And that Bill Goss is a sneak, too, and worse,\" and Martin Harris shook his head decidedly.  \"Well, we can't talk about those people now,\" said Dick.  \"We're in a mess and must get out of it the best way we can. As you are an old boatman, what would you advise us to do?\"  \"Come ashore with me and then get Dan Haskett to take your boat in charge and fix her up. He can stop that leak somehow and pump her out and have her all right inside of twenty-four hours.\"  \"Where can we find this Haskett?\"  \"Come into my boat and I'll take you to him.\"  The rowboat was now close at hand, and one after another the Rover boys stowed themselves away in the craft. Then Martin Harris took up the oars and started for the river bank.  He turned down the stream a bit and landed them at an old dock over which hung the sign: \"Daniel Haskett, Boat Builder and Repairer jobs Promptly Attended to--Charges Small.\"  Dan Haskett proved to be an elderly man, who was somewhat deaf, and it took the boys some time to make him understand the situation.  \"We've had a smash-up,\" began Dick.  \"Cash up?\" said the deaf man.  \"Cash up for what?\"  \"We've had a smash-up!\" repeated the boy in a louder tone.  \"We want our boat mended.\"  \"What's ended?\" asked the boat builder.  \"Your boat?\"  \"Almost ended,\" roared Tom. \"We--want--you--to--fix--up--our--boat,\" he yelled.  \"Oh, all right.  Where is she?\"  Dick pointed with his finger, and at once the boat builder understood.  \"There's a hole in her side,\" bawled the boy.  \"We want it patched up.\"  \"All right; I can do that.\"  \"Can we have her by tomorrow?\"  \"How's that?\"  And Dan Haskett placed his hand to his ear.  \"Can--we--have--her--by--tomorrow?\" yelled Dick.  \"I guess so.  I'll have to see how badly she is damaged first.\"  Haskett got out a small boat of his own and, taking Dick with him, rowed over to the wreck.  He pronounced the injury small and said the boys could have their boat by noon the next day.  The charges would be twelve or fifteen dollars.  \"We'll be getting off cheaper than I thought,\" said Tom, on Dick's return.  \"Ought to come out of Mumps' pocket.\"  \"That's so,\" added Sam.  \"By the way, I wonder what he meant by saying we were dogging him?\"  \"I can't say,\" replied Dick.  \"But I've been thinking that he can't be up to any good, or he wouldn't be so suspicious.\"  \"Just exactly my idea!\" burst out Tom.  \"Do you know what I half imagine?\"  \"Well?\"  \"That Mumps is cruising around waiting for Dan Baxter to join him.\"  \"But Baxter went to Chicago.\"  \"He won't stay there--not as long as his father is in the East. He will be back before long, if he isn't back already.\"  \"But he took that money belonging to his father.\"  \"What of that?  His father can't do anything against him, for he himself is worse than his son, as we all know.  Besides, his father is most likely still in the hospital.\"  \"If you young gentlemen want to sail around until tomorrow noon, I can take you out in one of my boats,\" remarked Martin Harris. \"I've got a first-class yacht, the _Searchlight_, that I can let you have reasonably.\"  \"Thanks, but I would just as lief stay on shore until our boat is mended,\" answered Dick.  \"But I want to pay you for what you did for us,\" he added.  \"Oh, that's all right.\"  But the boys thought otherwise, and in the end gave Martin Harris two dollars, with which the boatman was highly pleased.  \"Remember, I saw that accident,\" he said, on parting.  \"I can prove it was the _Falcon's_ fault.\"  \"We'll remember that,\" answered Dick.  From time to time they had watched the _Falcon's_ course until the yacht had disappeared down the river.  After a short debate the brothers decided to put up at a hotel which stood not far away, on a high cliff overlooking the noble Hudson.  \"We've been on the water for nearly two weeks now,\" said Dick, \"and to sleep in a real bed will be something of a novelty.\"  As it was in the height of the summer season the hotel was crowded; but some guests were just departing, and they managed to get a fairly good room on the second floor.  This had a double bed, and a cot was added, to accommodate Sam; Dick and Tom sleeping together, as usual.  It was supper time when the boys arrived, and as soon as they had registered and washed up and combed their hair, they descended to the spacious dining room, where fully a score of tables were set.  \"This way, please,\" said the head waiter, and showed them to a table at one side, overlooking one of the wide verandas of the hotel.  \"I'm as hungry as a bear!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"You can't serve us any too quick,\" he added, to the waiter who came up to take their orders.  \"Yes, sah, do the best I can, sah,\" grinned the colored man. \"What kind of soup, please?\"  \"I'll have ox-tail--\" began Tom, when he happened to glance out of the window.  As his gaze fell upon a man sitting in an easy chair on the veranda he uttered a low whistle.  \"By jinks, boys, look!  Josiah Crabtree, as sure as you're born!\" he whispered.     CHAPTER III  JOSIAH CRABTREE FREES HIS MIND   The individual to whom Tom referred had been a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5875"],["title","The Rover Boys on the Ocean; Or, A chase for a fortune (#2)"],["body","master at Putnam Hall, but his disagreeable ways had led to his dismissal by Captain Putnam.  Josiah Crabtree was a tall, slim individual, with a sharp face and a very long nose.  During the past term at Putnam Hall he had been very dictatorial to the Rover boys, and it must be confessed that they had made life anything but a bed of roses for him. Crabtree had been very desirous of marrying a certain widow by the name of Stanhope, but the marriage was opposed by Dora, the widow's daughter, and as Dick was rather sweet on Dora, he had done all he could to aid the girl in breaking off the match, even going so far as to send Crabtree a bogus letter which had taken the teacher out to Chicago on a hunt for a position in a private college that had never existed.  Dick knew that Crabtree was comparatively poor and wished to marry the widow so that he could get his hands on the fortune which the lady held in trust for her only child.  \"It is Crabtree,\" said Dick, as he gave a look.  \"I wonder how he liked his trip to Chicago?\" laughed Sam. \"Perhaps the Mid-West National College didn't suit his lofty ideas.\"  \"Hush! don't let him hear you talk of that,\" returned Dick.  \"He might get us into trouble.\"  \"What kind of soup, sah?\" interrupted the waiter, and then they broke off to give their order, and the waiter hurried off to fill it.  \"I'd like to know if he has been around the Stanhope cottage again,\" mused Dick, as he sipped his soup.  \"Dick can't bear to think of anybody around Dora,\" laughed Tom.  \"I don't want _him_ around,\" retorted the elder Rover, growing red in the face.  \"He wants the Stanhopes' money and that's all he does want.  I don't believe he really loves Mrs. Stanhope.\"  \"But why does she encourage him?\" came from Sam.  \"Why don't she send him about his business?\"  \"Oh, she is sickly, as you know, and he seems to have a peculiar hypnotic influence over her, at least that's what Dora thinks.\"  \"What are you laughing at, Tom?\"  \"I--I was thinking of the time we put the crabs in old Crabtree's bed,\" answered the younger brother.  \"No, you, weren't--\"  \"Well?\" demanded Tom, as Dick paused.  \"You were laughing because I  mentioned Dora, and--\"  \"'Pon my honor I wasn't,\" smiled Tom, but his look belied his words.  \"You were.  If I mention her cousins, Grace and Nellie Laning, I guess the laugh will be on you and Sam--\"  \"We'll call it quits,\" answered Tom hurriedly.  \"They're all nice girls, eh, Sam?\"  \"To be sure.  But, I say, hadn't we best keep out of old Crabtree's way?\"  \"I don't know as it's necessary,\" said Dick.  \"I'm not afraid of him, I'm sure.\"  \"Oh, neither am I, if you are going to put it that way,\" answered the youngest Rover.  \"If he's stopping here I'm going to have some fun with him,\" grinned Tom.  The evening meal was soon finished, and the boys took a stroll around the grounds.  They were just on the point of retiring when Dick drew his brothers' attention to a figure that was stealing through a nearby grove of trees.  \"There goes Crabtree.\"  \"I wonder where he is going,\" mused Sam.  \"Where does that path lead to?\"  \"Down to the river,\" came from Tom.  And then he added suddenly: \"Come, let us follow him.\"  \"What's the good,\" grumbled Dick.  \"I'm tired out.\"  \"There may be some chance for fun.  Come on,\" and thus urged Dick and Sam followed their fun-loving brother.  The path through the grove ran directly to the cliff overlooking the Hudson, at a point where a series of stone steps led up from the water's edge.  As they gained a spot where they could look down upon the river, Dick uttered a short cry.  \"Look, boys, a yacht!\" he said, pointing through the moonlight. \"I'll wager it is the _Falcon_!\"  \"And Mumps is coming to meet Josiah Crabtree,\" put in Sam.  \"But what would he want to see Crabtree about?\" demanded Tom.  \"That remains to be seen. Remember at Putnam Hall the only friends Josiah Crabtree had were Dan Baxter and Mumps.\"  \"That is true, Dick.  See, Crabtree has his handkerchief out and is waving it as a signal.\"  \"And here comes somebody up the steps. Mumps, sure enough,\" whispered Sam.  \"Let us get behind the trees and learn what is going on,\" came from Dick, and the three brothers lost no time in secreting themselves in the immediate vicinity.  \"Well, John, I've been waiting for you,\" said Josiah Crabtree, as Mumps came forward and the two shook hands.  \"So have I been waiting for you,\" returned the former sneak of Putnam Hall.  \"Why didn't you come yesterday?\"  \"It was impossible to do so, my lad.  Is that the _Falcon_ down there?\"  \"It is.\"  \"Who is in charge of her?\"  \"A sailor named Bill Goss.\"  \"Is he a--ahem--a man to be trusted?\"  \"I guess I can trust him,\" snickered Mumps. \"If he dared to give me away, I could send him to jail.\"  \"You mean that you--er--have him--ahem--in your power?\"  \"That's it, Mr. Crabtree.\"  \"Very good.  And is be, a good sailor?\"  \"As good as any on the river.\"  \"Then he can sail the yacht down the river without mishap?\"  \"He can take her to Florida, if you wish to go that far.\"  \"No, I don't want to go that far--at least, not at present.\"  \"Don't you think you ought to let me in on your little game,\" went on Mumps earnestly.  \"So far I'm in the dark.\"  \"You will know all very soon, John--and you shall be well paid for what you do.\"  \"That's all right.  But if it isn't lawful--\"  \"I will protect you, never fear.\"  \"Where is Dan Baxter?\"  \"Hush!  It will be best not to mention his name, my lad.\"  \"'But where is he?\"  \"I cannot say exactly.\"  \"Is he around Lake Cayuga?\"  \"Well--ahem--more than likely he is.  To tell the truth, he is very anxious to see his father.\"  \"To bone him for some more money?\"  \"I think not.  Daniel thinks a great deal of his parent, and when Mr. Baxter was so seriously injured--\"  \"Dan didn't care much for that.  He isn't that kind.\"  \"Daniel is a better boy than you think, John.  He loves his parent, and when that imp of a Rover got Mr. Baxter into trouble Daniel was very much exercised over it.\"  \"Gracious, but that's rich,\" murmured Dick.  \"_I_ got him into trouble.  I guess the rascal did that for himself.\"  \"Well, we won't talk about that, professor,\" went on Mumps.  \"You didn't stay in Chicago long.\"  \"No, I--ahem--the position offered to me did not suit my views, so I declined it.\"  \"Gee-christopher!\" came from Tom, and each of the Rovers could scarcely keep from laughing.  \"I think those Rover boys put up a job on you,\" said Mumps.  \"At least, I got an inkling that way.\"  \"Indeed.  I would like to wring their necks, the imps!\" burst out Josiah Crabtree.  \"Oh, what have I not suffered at their hands! At one hotel where I stopped they placed live crabs--But let that pass, the subject is too painful.  To come back to the point.  I can have the _Falcon_ at any time that I may need her?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And you will promise to say nothing to a soul about what is done on the trip I propose?\"  \"I will.\"  \"Very good, You see, this is a--er--a delicate matter.\"  \"Are you going to marry Mrs. Stanhope and use the yacht for your honeymoon?\" said Mumps somewhat slyly.  \"Hardly--although that would not be a bad idea, my lad.  But now I have a different deal on hand--something very much different.  If you do not object I'll take a look at your yacht and interview this sailor you mention.\"  \"All right, come ahead.\"  Mumps led the way down the rocky steps and Josiah Crabtree followed, moving slowly that he might not fall.  Creeping to the edge of the cliff, the Rover boys saw the pair reach the _Falcon_ and go on board.  \"Now what is in the wind?\" said Dick, as soon as the pair were out of hearing.  \"That's a conundrum,\" replied Tom. \"I'll wager one thing though--old Crabtree is up to no good.\"  \"I believe you are right.  I wish we could hear the rest of what is going on.\"  \"Can't we get close to the yacht?\" suggested Sam.  \"See, the sky is clouding over.  I don't believe they will see us going down the stairs.\"  They talked the plan over for a moment, then began to descend the steps, keeping as low down as possible and close to some brush which grew up in the crevices of the stones.  Soon the river bank was gained at a point not over fifty feet from where the yacht lay.  They halted behind a large stone close to the water's edge.  By straining their eyes in the darkness they saw Mumps, Crabtree, and Bill Goss in earnest conversation in the stern of the vessel. A low murmur came to their ears, but not a word could be understood.  \"We must get closer,\" was Dick's comment, when to the surprise of all they saw the sailor hoist the mainsail of the _Falcon_.  A gentle breeze was blowing, and soon the yacht was leaving the shore.  They watched the craft until the gathering darkness hid her entirely from view.     CHAPTER IV  THE DISASTROUS RESULT OF A TRICK   \"She's gone!\"  \"Yes; and I wonder where to, Tom?\"  \"I don't believe the yacht will go very far,\" said Sam.  \"Maybe old Crabtree merely wants to see what sort of a sailing craft she is.\"  \"We can watch here for a while,\" returned Dick.  They sat down on a rock and waited, in the meantime discussing the strange situation.  They could reach no conclusion but that Josiah Crabtree had some plot he wanted to put into execution. \"And it's something underhand, too,\" was Dick's comment.  At last they grew tired of waiting and almost fell asleep.  This being the case they returned to the hotel and made their way to the bed chamber.  Soon each was sleeping soundly.  When they awoke the sun was shining brightly--and it was half-past seven o'clock.  \"All up!\" shouted Tom, and dragged Sam out by the foot.  Soon they were dressed and made their way to the dining room.  They had scarcely seated themselves when Josiah Crabtree came in and was shown to a seat directly opposite the boys.  He did not notice them at first and began to eat a dish of oatmeal silently and rapidly.  Tom nudged Sam, and the younger Rover nudged his oldest brother, and a snicker went up.  At this Josiah Crabtree glanced at them "]]]
