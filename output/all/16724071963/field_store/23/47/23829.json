She simply runs away from them.  However, the activities of the raider have become so serious that the government has decided she must be captured at all hazards.\"  \"Which is where we come in,\" guessed Frank.  Lord Hastings gazed at the lad sternly.  \"Frank,\" he said, \"it's a wonder to me that your tongue hasn't got you into trouble long ago.  Now, if you'll listen, I'll proceed.\"  Frank sat back abashed.  \"Excuse me, sir,\" he said.  \"It won't happen again.\"  \"All right, then,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"As I say, it seems impossible to come up with this raider by speed, so she must be captured or sunk by strategy.  Now, I'll explain the plans to you, that you may know what to do and what will be expected of you.\"  Lord Hastings talked slowly for several hours, and the lads listened with unflagging interest.  When His Lordship had finished it was almost midnight.  \"Now, are you sure you understand?\" he asked, getting to his feet.  \"Perfectly, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Very well, then, you had better turn in.  You will sail aboard the Algonquin at five tomorrow evening.  I will see that your reservations are made and that you are supplied with sufficient funds.\"  The lads went to bed.  When Jack and Frank went aboard the Algonquin the following evening half an hour before the sailing hour, they were dressed as civilians. Each wore a heavy traveling suit and overcoat and a steamer cap.  Lord Hastings accompanied them aboard and introduced them to the captain, Stoneman by name, with whom His Lordship was well acquainted.  Then Lord Hastings went ashore.  The Algonquin was an American vessel and sailed under American registry.  \"I don't believe any raider will bother us,\" said Jack.  \"Never can tell,\" declared Frank.  \"What's our destination, anyhow?  I forgot to ask.\"  \"Buenos Ayres,\" replied Jack.  \"Wonder if there are many passengers aboard?\"  \"Doesn't look like it.  We'll have a look at the passenger list.\"  They did so and found that the only passengers on the trip were two women, registered as Mrs. Silas Wheaton and Miss Elizabeth Wheaton.  \"Looks like we would be pretty much to our ourselves,\" grinned Jack.  \"So much the better,\" said Frank.  The Algonquin was not, in the true sense of the word, a passenger steamer.  She had accommodations for some, but she was primarily a freighter, detoured this trip to carry a cargo of oil to the Argentine capital.  The vessel lifted anchor and steamed down the Thames promptly at 5 o'clock.  At 6 the lads found themselves at dinner at the captain's table.  There, too, they found Mrs. Wheaton and her daughter, Elizabeth.  Introductions followed.  \"I do hope we do not meet a submarine on the way,\" declared Miss Wheaton, who could not have been more than eighteen.  \"I guess we are safe enough on that score,\" smiled Jack.  \"Then they tell me there is a German raider operating off the coast of South America,\" said the girl.  \"We may be captured.\"  \"Pooh!\" exclaimed her mother.  \"Didn't I see guns front and back on this ship as I came abroad?\"  \"You mean fore and aft, mother,\" said the girl, smiling.  \"Yes, I saw the guns, too, but I don't imagine they would be much protection against a German raider.\"  \"Then what are they there for?\" Mrs. Wheaton wanted to know.  Jack and Frank laughed, and Captain Stoneman allowed a smile to wrinkle the corners of his mouth.  \"Well, they won't dare attack us,\" said Mrs. Wheaton.  \"If they do the United States will make Germany pay for it.\"  \"I guess Germany is not worrying about the United States right now,\" said Jack quietly.  \"We'll make her worry,\" declared the woman.  \"We're going to declare war and then the Kaiser will wish he had let us alone.  Besides, there are probably American ships of war off the coast of South America.  They will not allow us to be molested by a German raider.\"  \"But, perhaps they won't be able to help it,\" mother, said the girl.  \"Of course they will be able to help it,\" said the mother.  \"Now don't talk about this foolishness to me any more.\"  She arose and left the table.  Her daughter followed her a few moments later.  \"If the Germans get her they'll find they have caught a tartar,\" declared Jack.  \"So they will,\" declared Captain Stoneman.  \"By the way, Captain,\" said Frank, \"do you fear the raider will attack us?\"  \"She will if she knows we are around,\" declared the captain grimly.  \"And we are not prepared to fight her, sir?\" asked Frank.  \"Hardly,\" said the captain quietly.  \"What's your crew?\" demanded Jack.  \"First, second and third officers, chief engineer, assistant and forty men,\" was the reply.  \"And nothing worth while to shoot with,\" grinned Frank.  The captain brought his hand down hard upon the table.  \"No!\" he bellowed.  \"And still with these pirates sailing the seas, the American government won't allow us to carry guns big enough to do any damage.\"  \"Well, we'll hope for the best,\" said Frank, rising.  The lads made their way on deck.      CHAPTER IV  THE RAIDER  Word of the United States' declaration of war upon Germany was flashed to the Algonquin on the fourth day out.  It brought a thrill to Frank and to Captain Stoneman, an American himself.  Mrs. Wheaton, however, was the only person aboard who did any bragging as a result of it.  She declared that now the United States had come to the rescue of the world, she had no fear of German raiders or Germans in any other shape or form.  The Algonquin was still two days out from Buenos Ayres.  It was night. Came a hail from the lookout forward,  \"Ship, sir!\" he sang out.  \"Where away?\"  demanded Captain Stoneman from the bridge.  \"Dead ahead, sir!\"  Half an hour later the light of an approaching vessel became visible to all on deck.  \"The raider, do you suppose?\" asked Frank, who stood near the captain.  \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain angrily.  \"It may be and it may not be.\"  A moment later the searchlight of the approaching vessel picked the Algonquin out of the darkness.  \"Drat those searchlights!\" shouted the angry captain.  \"If it wasn't for those things a man would have a chance.\"  The wireless operator hurried up.  \"Message, sir,\" he exclaimed.  \"Well, why don't you give it to me.  What are you standing there for?\"  \"Vessel orders us to heave to or she'll put a shell into us, sir,\" said the operator, paying no attention to the captain's anger.  \"She will, eh?  What right has a bloodthirsty pirate like that to tell me what I can do?  I won't do it.\"  Nevertheless Captain Stoneman gave the command to heave to.  \"What's he sign himself?\" he demanded of the wireless operator.  \"He doesn't sign himself at all,\" was the reply.  \"Drat him!\" exclaimed the captain again.  \"Oh, well, we'll see what happens.\"  Half an hour later a small boat from the vessel that had accosted them scraped alongside the Algonquin.  \"Throw over a ladder,\" came a voice in English.  \"I'm coming aboard you.\"  The captain of the Algonquin growled again but he gave the necessary order.  A moment later three figures scrambled on deck.  At sight of the first man, Captain Stoneman's frown changed to a smile and he stepped quickly forward.  \"Dash me if it isn't Lansing!\" he exclaimed.  \"When did you get into the service, old man?\"  The man in the uniform of a naval officer looked at the captain closely a moment, then extended a hand.  \"Well, well, well!\" he exclaimed.  \"If it isn't Stoneman.  Where you bound, Captain?\"  \"Buenos Ayres.  What ship are you?\"  \"American cruiser Pioneer, Stoneman.  I'm the first officer.\"  \"Good for you, son,\" exclaimed the captain.  \"First I took you for that German raider they say is sailing about in these parts.\"  \"That's what I took you to be,\" declared the lieutenant.  \"I know there is no need searching your ship, Captain.  You're true blue, but I'll have to have a look at your papers.\"  \"Perfectly proper,\" said Captain Stoneman.  \"Come below.\"  The two disappeared below, but returned on deck a few moments later.  \"Who are your passengers, Captain?\" asked the American officer.  Captain Stoneman explained.  \"Guess I'd better have a look at them anyhow, if it's no trouble,\" said the lieutenant.  \"No trouble at all, Bo's'n,\" he called, \"summon all passengers on deck.\"  Frank and Jack were already there, and approached.  The American officer asked them a few questions, and then waved them away.  \"All right,\" he said.  Mrs. Wheaton and her daughter appeared a few moments later.  The former was angry. She approached the lieutenant.  \"What do you mean by holding us up in this high-handed fashion?\" she demanded.  \"Necessity of war, madam,\" said the lieutenant with a bow.  \"Necessity fiddlesticks,\" was the reply.  \"Who are you, anyhow?\"  \"I'm Lieutenant Lansing, American cruiser Pioneer, madam,\" came the reply.  Mrs. Wheaton's manner underwent an immediate change.  \"You'll pardon me, Lieutenant,\" she exclaimed.  \"Of course, I know you must do your duty.\"  After a few words with Mrs. Wheaton and her daughter, Lieutenant Lansing turned again to Captain Stoneman.  \"All right, Captain,\" he said, \"you may proceed.  If leave you now just a word, though.  Look out for that raider.  She's around here some place.  If you sight her, fire your guns, and if I'm within hearing I'll come up.  Work your wireless, too.  I'm here to nail that fellow.\"  \"Very good,\" said Captain Stoneman.  \"You can count on me, Lansing.\"  The two men shook hands and the American naval officer, followed by his men, disappeared over the side.  Captain Stoneman gave a signal and the Algonquin moved on again.  \"Didn't take the United States very long to get started, did it?\" said Frank, as they descended below.  \"I should say not,\" was Jack's reply.  \"Still, I am afraid American cruisers will have no more success in nabbing the raider than have British vessels.\"  \"Don't forget we're on the job,\" said Frank, with a smile.  \"I'm not forgetting it,\" said Jack.  \"The sooner we come up with that fellow the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6072"],["title","The Boy Allies with Uncle Sam's Cruisers (#3)"],["body"," it will please me.\"  \"Same here.\"  \"Well, guess we may as well turn in,\" said Jack.  \"Probably will be nothing doing tonight.\"  Five minutes later the lads were asleep.  Morning dawned clear and bright and Captain Stoneman congratulated himself that he was fast nearing his destination.  \"Tomorrow morning at this time and we will be safe,\" he said at the breakfast table.  \"Pooh,\" said Mrs. Wheaton.  \"What is there to be afraid of?  Don't you know that the American cruiser Pioneer is in these waters?\"  \"But she is not in sight, mother,\" said her daughter.  \"I'd like to know what difference that makes.  Lieutenant Lansing knows that there are Americans aboard the Algonquin.  He will not desert us.\"  \"I am afraid,\" said Frank, \"that Lieutenant Lansing has more important duties just now than seeing that the Algonquin reaches port safely.\"  \"And what can be more important, I'd like to know?\" demanded Mrs. Wheaton.  \"Well, there are a whole lot of things,\" said Frank, \"one of which is to nab this German raider, and I'll venture to say that the Pioneer is paying more attention to the raider right now than it is to the Algonquin.\"  \"Young man,\"  said Mrs. Wheaton, \"it is perfectly plain to me that you do not know what you are talking about.\"  Frank flushed, and was about to reply.  But he caught the eye of Miss Wheaton and remained silent.  A few moments later he excused himself and left the table.  Fifteen minutes later Elizabeth Wheaton approached him on deck.  \"Don't mind mother,\" she said with a smile.  \"It is just her way.  She means no harm.\"  \"Probably not,\" agreed Frank with a smile, \"but you will admit that it is rather annoying.\"  Before the girl could reply, there came a hail from the lookout forward.  \"Ship, sir!\"  \"Where away?\" called the first officer, who held the bridge.  \"Dead ahead!\" came the reply.  Indeed, a ship was plainly visible to all on deck at that moment.  It came to the first officer in a flash that this vessel bearing down on the Algonquin was in all probability the German raider.  He summoned the captain.  Captain Stoneman came jumping on deck.  He gave one look at the approaching vessel, and then cried angrily, forgetting his grammar absolutely as he did so.  \"That's her!  That's her as sure as I'm a foot high.\"      CHAPTER V  ABOARD THE RAIDER  Captain Stoneman now became the man of action that Jack and Frank knew he could be.  \"Mr. Bronson!\" he summoned the first officer, who approached hastily. \"Mr. Bronson,\" continued the captain, \"you point that gun aft toward the heavens and you fire it until I tell you to stop.  Mr. Taylor, you do the same with the gun forward.\"  The captain glanced around.  His third officer was busy.  He called to Jack.  \"Mr. Templeton,\" he cried, \"you go below and tell my wireless operator to pick up the cruiser Pioneer.  You tell him I said not to stop trying, or I'll be down and attend to him myself.\"  Jack hurried away to obey the command.  Frank approached Captain Stoneman.  \"Can I be of any assistance, sir?\" he asked.  The captain glared at him angrily.  \"No,\" he shouted; then added: \"Yes.  You stand at the hatchway there and don't you let either of those women come on deck.  If you do, I'll toss you overboard.\"  Frank went to his post.  So far there had been nothing to indicate that the approaching ship was other than a peaceful vessel.  She had, so far as Captain Stoneman knew, made no effort to pick up the Algonquin with her wireless.  \"I wonder,\" said Captain Stoneman to himself, \"whether that pirate is going to blow me up without warning, or whether that wireless operator of mine has gone to bed?  I'll go down and find out.\"  He ordered his first officer away from the gun aft to take the bridge and ran below to the wireless room.  \"Any message from the ship ahead?\" he demanded.  \"No, sir,\" was the operator's reply.  \"What's all that 'click-clicking' about?\"  \"I'm trying to pick up the Pioneer, sir.\"  \"Humph!  Can't you raise her?\"  \"No, sir.\"  Captain Stoneman returned on deck without further words.  He relieved the first officer and ordered him back to the gun aft.  At almost the same moment, the forward gun, pointed high, spoke.  \"That'll raise the Pioneer if she's around here,\" said Captain Stoneman aloud.  The aft gun also spoke now, and then both boomed again.  An instant later a cloud of smoke burst from the approaching vessel, followed by a heavy boom.  A solid shot passed over the Algonquin and splashed in the water beyond.  \"Humph!\" said Captain Stoneman again.  \"Signal to heave to, eh?  Well, I can't afford to disregard it.\"  He signaled the engine room and the Algonquin a few moments later came to a stop.  \"Now, come on, you pirates,\" mumbled Captain Stoneman.  \"Come on aboard and tell me what you want.\"  A boat put off from the raider, for such the strange vessel proved to be.  It came toward the Algonquin rapidly.  Captain Stoneman motioned to Frank.  \"Better let the women come up now,\" he said quietly, \"and Mr. Bronson, pipe all hands from below.\"  Before the small boat reached the Algonquin's side, all passengers and members of the crew were on deck.  Frank pressed close to Jack.  \"Got your gun?\" he asked.  \"In my boot,\" was the quiet reply; \"and yours?\"  \"All right.  How about your little decoration?\"  Jack took a small object from his pocket and put it in the left-hand button hole of his coat.  Frank followed his example.  \"What is the meaning of this outrage?\" demanded Mrs. Wheaton, as she watched the small boat approach.  \"Meaning is that we are prisoners of the German raider,\" answered Captain Stoneman, who overheard the remark.  \"And why?\" demanded the woman.  \"I heard guns fired above here. Couldn't you hit anything?\"  \"We didn't try, madam,\" said the captain.  \"We fired those guns to notify the Pioneer we had encountered the raider.\"  \"Well, why didn't you shoot at her?\" demanded Mrs. Wheaton.  Captain Stoneman was about to make an angry retort, but restrained himself with a visible effort.  The raider's boat scraped alongside the Algonquin.  \"Throw down a ladder here,\" said a voice in English, though with a heavy German accent.  Captain Stoneman growled ominously, but he ordered the command obeyed. A moment later a German naval officer appeared on deck.  He was closely followed by half a dozen other figures.  The officer approached Captain Stoneman.  \"You are the commander of this vessel?\" he asked.  \"I am,\" was the reply.  \"What of it?\"  \"You'd best keep a civil tongue in your head,\" said the German. \"What's your destination, and the nature of your cargo?\"  \"Buenos Ayres; oil,\" growled the captain, answering both questions briefly.  \"Good!\" said the German.  \"We are in need of oil.\"  He turned to one of his men.  \"Below with you,\" he said.  \"Take three men and unloosen a hundred barrels of oil.  I'll send a boat after them.\"  The man saluted and went below, followed by several of his companions. The German officer turned again to Captain Stoneman.  \"You and your men, and these two ladies,\" he indicated Mrs. Wheaton and her daughter, \"will be prisoners aboard the Vaterland.  Captain Koenig will make you as comfortable as possible.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Captain Stoneman briefly.  \"I know enough about you Germans and what to expect.\"  \"Silence!\" thundered the German, \"or I shall have you placed in irons.\"  Captain Stoneman shrugged his shoulders, but he held his tongue.  Now, for the first time, the German officer appeared to notice that Jack and Frank were not members of the Algonquin crew.  He motioned them to approach.  \"You are passengers?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Jack.  The German took a quick step forward as he noticed the little emblem on Jack's coat.  He glanced at Frank and saw one there, too.  He tapped the one that Jack wore with his finger.  \"Where did you get that?\" he asked sharply.  \"Where could I get it but in one place?\" was Jack's reply.  \"You are no German,\" said the officer.  \"I was not born in Germany, it is true,\" said Jack, \"but my ancestors were.  I am what some people are pleased to call a German-American.\"  \"Good!\" exclaimed the German officer.  \"But what are you doing here?\"  \"That,\" said Jack, \"is rather a long story and one that I am commanded to tell to Captain Koenig.\"  The German officer hesitated.  \"You come together?\" he asked at length, indicating Frank.  \"Yes,\" said Jack.  \"Well,\" said the German, \"you will realize that I must be careful.  I must see if you are armed.\"  He examined the lads' clothing carefully.  \"You will follow me,\" he said a few moments later.  The crew of the Algonquin, meantime, was being transferred to the Vaterland.  Jack and Frank found themselves in the last boatload to go.  Aboard the Vaterland, as the two lads followed their captor to the cabin of the German commander, Frank saw the disgust in the eyes of Elizabeth Wheaton as he passed her.  It was plain that she, at least, took him for what he represented himself to be to the German officer.  \"Oh, well,\" said the lad, as he walked along, \"it cannot be helped.\"  Captain Koenig asked the lads several sharp questions which apparently satisfied him that they were what they claimed to be.  \"But I cannot land you yet,\" he said.  \"Any time within the month will do, Captain,\" said Jack.  \"We still have a little time.  We do not need to reach New York until two days before the meeting.  You can set us ashore some place in time enough for us to get there.\"  \"I'll do better than that,\" said the captain.  \"I'll set you ashore on the coast of Florida three weeks from today.\"  \"Good!\" said Jack.  \"Now,\" said the captain, \"if you care to accompany me on deck, you shall see the last of the ship that carried you here.\"  The lads followed the captain on deck.  The latter summoned his first officer.  \"Fuses all set?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir.  The explosion should occur within one minute.\"  All turned their eyes to the abandoned Algonquin.  Suddenly there was a terrible explosion.  A sheet of flame sprang from the doomed vessel.  She"]]]
