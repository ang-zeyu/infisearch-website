Sometimes checks are dated ahead, for reasons satisfactory to the maker and payee.  A check drawn on August 5th, but dated August 20th cannot be collected till the latter date.  Never date a check ahead unless you are positive that you will have the money in bank to meet it on the day named.  Never, if you can avoid it in trade, receive a post-dated check.  Cash or deposit your checks as soon as possible after they are received.  If the bank should fail, while you are holding the check, the maker cannot be held for the loss.  CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT  Often when a depositor is travelling, he finds it convenient to carry with him a form of paper that is as good as cash, and much better in the event of loss.  Banks will issue \"certified checks\" to depositors. These checks are stamped by the bank \"certified\" with the date and officer's signature attached.  On issuing such a check, the bank debits the receiver's account with the amount, and so can guarantee the payment whenever or wherever presented.  Such a check may be received with as much certainty of its value as if it were a bank bill.  When a person places money in a bank with no intention of checking it out for some time to come, he may have issued to him a \"Certificate of deposit.\"  While holding this certificate he cannot check against the money in the bank.  The holder of a certificate of deposit may transfer it.  The money may be paid in part by the bank, if the certificate is presented, and the amount is endorsed on the back.  To withdraw all the money the certificate must be surrendered.  USE OF CHECKS  There is no form of commercial paper in such general use as the check.  The total of all the checks in use at some seasons is far more than the total of all the money in all the banks.  Checks are balanced in the money centers through what are known as clearing houses. In these a bank is charged with checks against it and credited with those in its favor.  The differences are settled by cash.  Often a few thousand dollars will settle check accounts amounting to millions.  If by any chance you should receive a check in which your name is misspelled, or not given as you write it, endorse the check exactly as the name is written on the face, then add your name in the regular way.     CHAPTER IX  SAVINGS BANKS    While of National importance, savings banks are chartered by the respective states in which they exist, and as such are distinctly local institutions.  Unlike the National, the savings bank is not established as a money-making corporation.  The ostensible and actual purpose of the savings bank is to encourage people of small means to save.  The savings bank provides a safe place for the care of such deposits, and it pays such rates of interest on such deposits as are warranted by the earnings of its investments after paying the expenses incident to the proper conduct of its officers.  When a savings bank receives authorization to act, through a charter from the state, the organizers choose a board of directors and the proper officers.  Usually the officers occupying positions of trust and responsibility are required to give bonds for the proper discharge of their duties.  HOW BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED  With all the legal conditions complied with, and a suitable office provided, the savings bank is ready for business.  Some savings banks will receive on deposit any sum from five cents to five thousand dollars.  Other banks will not receive less than one dollar at a time, nor more than a thousand.  We have heard of \"penny savings banks,\" but they are rarely chartered, and are organized, only to encourage thrift among children.  Fractional parts of a dollar are not usually reckoned as drawing interest.  Some banks require as much as three, four or five dollars before allowing interest.  Savings banks in the eastern states pay from three to four per cent. In the west it is sometimes as high as six.  Each bank has certain dates at which calculation of interest begins. As a rule this is January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st.  Money deposited at any time between these dates does not draw interest till the beginning of the next quarter.  But never mind the interest.  The best time to make a deposit is when you have the money.  The bank is safer than your pocket.  HOW TO DEPOSIT  Count your money carefully and make a memorandum of the amount before giving to the savings bank to deposit.  Hand the money to the officer--usually \"the receiving teller\"-- authorized to receive it.  The teller writes down the name, age, occupation and residence of the depositor.  If money is deposited in the name of one under legal age, the names of the parents and the birthplace of the minor are also recorded.  The adult depositor must write his name in a book provided by the bank for the signature of clients.  When these conditions are complied with, the depositor receives a memorandum book, known as a \"deposit book\", in which, with his name and date, is written the amount of his first deposit.  The deposit book must be carefully guarded, for without its presentation at the savings bank money cannot be drawn. You cannot check against your savings bank account, as with a commercial bank.  HOW THE ACCOUNT GROWS  After the first account is opened the rest is easy.  On the second, as on all subsequent visits, the deposit book, with the amount to be entered, is handed to the receiving teller. He counts the money, makes a record of it for his own use, enters it on your book as a deposit, and hands the book back. That is all.  Whenever interest is due it is written down in the book as if it were a cash deposit.  The interest, if desired, will be paid in cash, but if allowed to remain, it begins at once to earn interest for itself.  Interest grows like a rolling snow ball. On such small beginnings great fortunes have been built.  Savings banks keep a reserve, made up of earnings in excess of interest and all expenses.  This reserve earns money.  The money so earned is reckoned as a net profit, and it may be distributed, and usually is, among its depositors as a \"dividend.\"  THE LIMIT OF DEPOSIT  Different banks have different limits of deposit, that is fixed sums beyond which they will not receive.  The limit is from one thousand to five thousand dollars.  When the fortunate depositor has reached the limit with one savings bank, there is no law to prevent his opening another account with another, or with any number of similar banks.  Remember the savings banks are not meant for capitalists, but for small depositors.  After deposits and interests have reached a total of $1,600, the interest will not go on earning interest, but will be regarded simply as a deposit.  This is in compliance with law.  Depositors, posted as to the law, open another account with another bank, and keep on till the interest limit is reached.  HOW TO DRAW MONEY  A savings bank depositor may either draw money himself or through some properly authorized person.  This is the method:  The deposit book is presented to the paying teller. The owner states the sum he wants to draw.  Having assured himself that the bearer of the book is the right person, the teller takes a receipt in a book kept for the purpose, for the amount, enters the same on the right hand or debit side of the book, and hands out the money.  There is a form of authorization for another to draw, printed on the deposit book. This must be copied and its directions complied with.  Most banks will not allow depositors to draw out less than a fixed sum, say $5.00.  This saves trouble, and prevents thoughtless depositors from going to the bank every time they want a dollar.  Before a depositor can draw a large sum from a savings bank he may be compelled, under the law, to give from one week to six weeks' notice of his intention.  This provision may not prevent a run on the bank, but it gives the managers time to provide for it.  Read the rules in the deposit book.  HOW SAVINGS BANKS EARN  How can a bank that does not discount notes or deal in loans and commercial paper earn money? How can it pay interest?  While they may be individually small, the aggregate of all the deposits in a savings bank may, and often do, amount to many millions.  This money is not allowed to lie idle.  Under the skilled direction of the bank officers, the money, instead of lying idle in the vaults, is invested in many ways, but always in accordance with the laws of the state under which the bank is chartered.  Much of the money is invested in mortgages on real estate, never on personal property.  National bank stocks, sound railroad bonds, and other forms of reliable interest security are fields for the investment of savings bank funds.  Savings banks are subject to the periodic inspection of state officers appointed for the purpose.  The failure of a savings bank through bad investments or the dishonesty of officials is very rare.  Avoid all banks that promise more than the regular rate of interest.  Private banks may be, and usually are, honestly conducted, but to be safe, deposit only with a bank that is regularly chartered and is subject to the inspection of the law.  The savings bank is the best for the wage earner.     CHAPTER X  NOTES--DRAFTS    The promissory note is a most useful kind of commercial paper, and it is in general use in business.  If a man has not sufficient ready cash to pay for the real estate he is about to purchase, he makes up the difference by a note, which note is secured by a mortgage on the property.  Remember the mortgage must always be regarded as security. The note represents the debt.  Often wholesalers take a note as part or even full payment for a bill of goods to a retailer.  If the wholesaler needs money, he endorses these notes and putting them in his bank draws against them, less the discount he has to pay for the accommodation.  As has been shown, an account may be transferred and sold, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6167"],["title","Business Hints for Men and Women (#7)"],["body","a note is more convenient for that purpose.  AN ILLUSTRATION  As with a check the maker of a note is known as a \"drawer,\" the person in whose favor it is drawn is the \"payee.\"  Notes may be written in pencil, but it is better and safer to write with ink on good paper.  Supposing you buy a team of horses, or it may be a bill of goods, from John Brown, for $350.  Now you have only $100 in cash. What are you to do?  Mr. Brown, knowing you to be reliable, says: \"That's all right, friend Jones. You pay me the $100 cash for which I will give you a receipt, then I will take your note for six months, payable at my bank.\"  You agree to this; pay out the money, make and deliver the note and take the property in question, which is now yours as much as it had been his before the transfer.  The following would be a legal form in which to make the note:    $250.                             Summit, N. J.                                   October 10, 1910.   Six months after date I promise to pay to   the order of John Brown..............   Two hundred and fifty ...... dollars,....   At the Lincoln National Bank of Summit   .......... Value received.                           George Jones.     No. 1. Due April 14, 1911.  Now, if before the expiration of this note, you want to make a payment on it of, say, $75, you take the money to Mr. Brown, who endorses on the back of the note, \"Received on the within note $75, January 3rd.,\" if that be the date, and signs, \"John Brown.\"  It may be well to remember that while a running account may be collected at any time, the law cannot prevent the maker of a promissory note from selling all his belongings and leaving the country before the note is due.  DAYS OF GRACE  Notes may be \"time\" notes, that is where there is a specified time for payment, or \"demand\" notes. The latter are collectable on presentation.  With the time notes \"three days grace\" are allowed after the expiration of the date for payment. No such favor is allowed in the case of demand notes.  These grace days do not seem businesslike. Why not add them to the date in the note? Well, it is a custom, quite as old as the greater part of our laws, and so it must be observed.  Under the law a note is payable at the home or business place of the drawer, unless otherwise specified.  INDORSING NOTES  A note secured by a mortgage has its payment guaranteed.  The usual way of securing the payment of a note given in business is to have it endorsed with a good name across the back, as in endorsing a check.  By writing your name across the back of another man's note you announce to all the holders of that note that you know the maker and that if he does not pay it you will.  In most states the indorser of a note cannot be held responsible for payment, unless the holder notifies him, within twenty-four hours after the note comes due, that the maker cannot or will not pay.  If an indorsed note changes hands, each indorser is responsible to all endorsers who follow him and also to the last holder of the note.  If an indorser, that is, one into whose hands the note has come after the first endorsement, should not wish to guarantee payment, he writes before his name, \"Without recourse to me.\"  This is known as a \"qualified endorsement.\"  A NEGOTIABLE NOTE  Most notes are negotiable; that is because they may be sold, like any other personal property, or the ownership may be transferred from one person to another.  No note is negotiable that does not bear on its face, the words, \"Pay to bearer,\" or \"Pay to the order of,\" followed by the payee's name.  JOINT NOTES  When two persons sign a note they become jointly and individually responsible for its payment.  Such persons are known as \"joint makers.\"  If one signs his name on the back of a note before it has been handed to the payee, he makes himself not only an endorser, but a joint maker.  If the maker of such a note refuses to pay on the expiration of time stated, he is liable for the amount without any notification.  DISCOUNTING NOTES  If a business man borrows from a bank on his note, he must pay for the privilege.  Interest is a sum paid for the use of money.  Interest is reckoned as a certain percentage yearly on the principal.  Interest on interest is called \"compound interest\" and is unused in ordinary business transactions.  Instead of collecting interest when the amount borrowed on a note is due, or deducting it from the principal in advance, it discounts the note at the rate agreed on and pays the rest.  This is called bank discount and its rate is variable, depending on the abundance or scarcity of money.  Money is a marketable article, and the price, like that of wheat or cotton, is governed by supply and demand.  INTEREST ON NOTES  A note may be made payable \"with interest,\" or not, as the parties concerned may agree.  If nothing is said about interest in the note, no interest can be collected.  Again a note may go into details and specify that \"the interest shall be ten per cent, payable semi-annually,\" provided always that the rate shall not be higher than the legal interest of the state.  Excessive interest is known as \"usury.\" It invalidates all the interest, and in some places the principal is forfeited.  When the holder of an interest note receives interest payment he must record the date and sum on the back of the note.  PROTESTS  If a note comes due on Sunday or on a legal holiday, payment must be made on the following day.  Holidays are appointed by the separate states.  The United States recognizes no day as a holiday, except Sunday, and that is acknowledged through custom.  It is customary for banks to notify makers of notes held by them a few days before time set for payment; but this is not required by law.  If a note lies unpaid in bank the day set for payment, as soon as the office closes for regular business the note is protested.  The protest is made before a notary public; he is usually an employee of the bank.  In the protest formal objection is made against the breaking of the promise, and demanding that the matter be set right by the maker, or on his failure, by the indorser.  The indorser, who has to pay, has a claim for the amount on the maker of the note, as he would have for money loaned or goods sold, and he can sue to collect.  A note that is not paid within a fixed time is said to be \"outlawed.\"  Remember the indorser of a note must be notified within twenty- four hours of the failure of the drawer to make good.  NOTICES  The object in protesting a note is to fix the liability on the endorser.  If there be more than one endorser notice of protest must be sent to all at the same time.  It is better, where possible, to serve the notices on the indorsers in person.  The payee must also be notified.  ACCOMMODATIONS  There is a form of note sometimes used in business which is given without any consideration on the part of the maker. This is known as an \"accommodation note.\"  The maker of such a note does not expect to pay it, nor does the man in whose favor it is drawn expect to do so.  An accommodation note is an instrument by the sale of which, or through a bank, money may be raised for immediate use.  The maker in this case is a friend who loans his name.  As there was no value received such a note could not be collected by the payee.  But if it passes into the hands of a third party, who endorses it, then the maker of the note can be compelled to pay.  A LOST NOTE  A note may be lost or stolen.  The losing of a note does not release the maker from payment of the full amount on the date and at the place named.  The loser should at once notify the maker of his loss.  A man who buys, before its maturity, a lost or stolen note, may collect the full amount from the maker, provided the note is payable to \"bearer\" and no notice of the loss has been published.  When the maker of a lost note pays the amount to the original owner, he should receive from him what is known as a \"bond of indemnity.\"  This bond is to secure him against paying a second time.  NOTES ABOUT NOTES  There are some things worth remembering about promissory notes.  1. Never give one if you can pay cash. 2. A note made on Sunday is worthless in some states. 3. A note given under compulsion is worthless. 4. Notes made by a drunken person, or obtained by any form of fraud cannot be collected under law. 5. Notes bear interest only when so stated in body of note. 6. The holder of a note has a legal claim against every indorser. 7. Each indorser is responsible to every indorser who follows him. 8. Notes are valid without reference to the kind of paper, or whether they are written with pen or pencil. 9. Losing a note does not release the maker from payment. 10. If no time is set in a note for payment, it becomes due as soon as it is made. 11. Where a note is made in one state and is payable in another, it is governed by the laws of the state in which it is to be paid. 12. Notes payable on demand draw no interest until after they have been presented for payment. 13. If a note reads \"with interest\" and no rate is specified then it draws the legal interest in the state in which it was made. 14. Demand notes are not entitled to days of grace. 15. If no place of payment is named in a note, it should be presented to the maker personally in business hours. 16. The misspelling of a word or words in no way invalidates a note. 17. If a person who cannot write makes a note his mark should be properly witnessed. 18. The makers of a joint note must be sued jointly. 19. If the words and the figures in a note disagree, the words take precedence. 20. A note signed by a firm may be collected from either of the partners. 21. When a payment is made on a note secured by a mortgage, the amount is endorsed on the note, never on the mortgage. 22. A note given by a minor is void, unless given for actual necessities, like food and clothing. 23. If a note made by a minor is acknowledged when he comes of age it is"]]]
