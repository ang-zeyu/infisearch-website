We don't do things like city girls.\"  \"'Deed we don't!\" exclaimed Dotty. \"I used to live in the city, and when I went to Berwick it was like a different world. But I've come to like it now.\"  \"I like it,\" said Bernice, decidedly. \"I think we have a lot more fun in Berwick than we could in New York. To live, I mean. Of course, this visit here is lovely, but it's the novelty and the strange sights that make it so. I wouldn't want to live in New York.\"  \"Neither would I,\" and Dolly shook her head very positively.  \"I would,\" said Alicia. \"I'd just love to live here, in a house like Uncle Jeff's, and have all these cars and servants and everything fine.\"  \"No, thank you,\" Dolly rejoined. \"It's beautiful for a week, but it makes my head go round to think of living like this always.\"  \"Your head is not very securely fastened on, anyway,\" and Alicia grinned at her. \"You'll lose it some day!\"  \"Maybe so,\" smiled Dolly, affably, and then they suddenly found they were back home.  \"Good time, girlies?\" called out Mrs. Berry, as they entered. \"Lunch is all ready; sit down and eat it, and get dressed for the matinee afterward, Mr. Fenn got fine seats for you,--near the front. You'll like the play, I know.\"  And like the play they did. It was a light opera, of the prettiest type, full of lovely scenery, gay costumes and bright, catchy music. \"The Lass and the Lascar\" was its name, and the lass in question was a charming little girl who seemed no older than the quartette themselves. The Lascar was a tall, handsome man, whose swarthy East Indian effects were picturesque and attractive. He had a magnificent baritone voice, and the girls sat breathless when he sang his splendid numbers. All four were fond of music and even more than the gay splendour of the show they enjoyed the voices and orchestra.  \"Isn't he wonderful!\" exclaimed Alicia, as the curtain fell on the first act. \"Oh, girls, isn't he SUPERB! I'm MADLY in love with him!\"  \"He has a beautiful voice,\" agreed Dolly, \"but I couldn't be in love with him! He's too,--too ferocious!\"  \"But that's his charm,\" declared Alicia, rolling her eyes in ecstasy. \"Oh, he is ideal! He's fascinating!\"  The curtain rose again, and the Lascar proved even more fascinating. He was a daredevil type, as Lascars have the reputation of being, but he was gentle and affectionate toward the Lass, who, for some inexplicable reason, scorned his advances.  \"What a FOOL she is! WHAT a fool!\" Alicia whispered, as the coquettish heroine laughed at the impassioned love songs of her suitor. \"I should fall into his arms at once!\"  \"Then there wouldn't be any more opera,\" laughed Bernice. \"That fall into his arms is always the last episode on the stage.\"  \"That's so,\" agreed Alicia, \"but how can she flout him so? Oh, girls, isn't he the grandest man? I never saw such a handsome chap! What a lovely name he has, too: Bayne Coriell! A beautiful name.\"  \"Good gracious, Alicia! don't rave over him like that! Somebody will hear you!\"  \"I don't care. I never saw any one so wonderful! I'm going to get his picture when we go out. I suppose it's for sale in the lobby. They usually are.\"  \"Are they?\" asked Dolly. \"Then I want to get one of the Lass. Marie Desmond, her name is. Can I, do you think?\"  \"Yes, of course, Dollykins. You get that and I'll get my hero, my idol, Bayne Coriell!\"  As it chanced the photographs were not on sale at the theatre, but an usher told Alicia where they could be bought, and she directed Kirke to stop there on the way home.  She bought several different portraits of the man who had so infatuated her and Dolly bought two photographs of Miss Desmond. The other girls said they didn't care for any pictures, and laughed at the enthusiasm of Alicia and Dolly.  \"I want this,\" Dolly defended herself, \"because sometime I'm going to be an opera singer. I did mean to sing in Grand Opera, and maybe I will, but if I can't do that, I'll sing in light opera, and I like to have this picture to remind me how sweet Miss Desmond looks in this play.\"  \"Pooh,\" said Alicia, \"that's all very well. But I want these pictures of Bayne Coriell because he's such a glorious man! Why, he's as handsome as Apollo. And, girls, I don't believe he's hardly any older than we are.\"  \"Oh, he must be,\" returned Dotty. \"Why, he's twenty-two or more, I'm sure.\"  \"Maybe he is twenty, but not more than that. Oh, how I wish I could meet him! Think of the joy of talking to a man like that!\"  \"Well, it's not likely you'll ever meet Bayne Coriell,\" said Bernice, laughing at the idea; \"so you needn't hope for that!\"     CHAPTER VI  A MATINEE IDOL   \"Oh, Uncle Jeff,\" Alicia cried, as they gathered round the dinner-table that same night, \"we went to the splendidest play! It was a light opera, 'The Lass and the Lascar.' Have you seen it?\"  \"No, my dear, I rarely go to the theatre; never to foolish pieces like that! But it's all right for you young people. So you enjoyed it, did you? How did you like--\"  But Alicia's babble interrupted him. \"Oh, Uncle, it was simply out of sight! And the hero! Ah-h-h!\"  Alicia leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes as if the memory of the hero was overwhelming.  \"Took your fancy, did he?\" asked her uncle, with a twinkle in his eye. \"Good-looking chap?\"  \"Good-looking faintly expresses it!\" and Alicia returned to consciousness. \"He was like a Greek god! And his CHARM! Oh, Uncle Jeff, he is just indescribable! I wish you could SEE him.\"  \"Must be a paragon! What did the rest of you girls think! Were you hit so hard?\"  Dotty laughed. \"He was splendid, Uncle Forbes,\" she said, \"but we didn't fall so head over heels in love with him as Alicia did. He has a stunning voice and he's a fine actor.\"  \"Oh, more than that!\" raved Alicia. \"He's a DARLING! a man of a THOUSAND!\"  \"A young man?\" asked Mr. Forbes.  \"Yes,\" replied Bernice. \"Alicia thinks he isn't twenty, but he can't be much more. He looked a mere boy.\"  \"Wasn't that because he was made up as a young character in the play?\"  \"Partly,\" admitted Alicia. \"But he's a very young man, anyway. Oh, Uncle Jeff, I'm just CRAZY over him! I think I shall go to see that play every chance I can possibly get. Could we go to an evening performance?\"  \"Speak for yourself, John!\" cried Bernice. \"I don't want to see that play again! I enjoyed it heaps, and I think Mr. Coriell was fine, but next time we go I'd rather see something else.\"  \"So would I,\" said the two D's together.  \"How can you say so!\" and Alicia looked at the others in scorn. \"You'll never find any actor who can hold a candle to Coriell! I have his picture, Uncle,\" and, excusing herself, she left the table to get them.  \"H'm, yes, a good-looking man,\" agreed Mr. Forbes, as he scrutinised the photographs. \"But, Alicia, you mustn't fall in love with every operatic tenor you see. I believe this Coriell is a 'matinee idol,' but don't allow him to engage your young affections.\"  \"Too late with your advice, Uncle Jeff!\" and Alicia gazed raptly at the pictures. \"I ADORE him! and the fact that my adoration is hopeless makes it all the more interesting. Oh, isn't he a WONDER!\"  Gaily she set the pictures up in front of her, propping them on glasses or salt cellars, and continued to make mock worship at his shrine.  \"Don't be silly, Alicia,\" commented her uncle, but she only shook her head at him, and gave a mournful sigh.  The girls spent the evening much the same as they had done the night before. They all sat in the stately drawing-room, and endeavoured to make conversation. But Uncle Jeff was hard to talk to, for he rarely stuck to one subject for more than five minutes at a time, and abruptly interrupted the girls when they were trying their best to be entertaining.  Alicia continued to chatter about her new-found enthusiasm, until her uncle commanded her to desist.  \"May I beg of you, Alicia,\" he said, sternly, \"to cease raving over that man? He's doubtless old enough to be your father, and would be bored to death could he hear your nonsense about him!\"  Alicia looked put out, but a glance at her uncle's face proved his seriousness, and she said no more about the actor.  The evening wore away, but it seemed to the girls as if it never would be ten o'clock. And it was greatly to their relief, when, at about half-past nine, Mr. Forbes bade them good-night and went off upstairs.  \"It is all the queerest performance,\" said Bernice. \"What in the world does Uncle Jeff want of us,--I can't make out. The outlook seems to be that we can have all the fun we want daytimes, and pay for it by these ghastly evening sessions.\"  \"There's something back of it all,\" said Alicia, astutely. \"This revered uncle of ours, Bernie, has something up his sleeve.\"  \"I think so, too,\" said Dotty. \"He scrutinises us all so closely, when he thinks we're not looking. But I, for one, am quite willing to put up with these evenings for the sake of the fun we have in the daytime.\"  \"I should say so!\" agreed Dolly. \"We never can thank you enough, Bern, for bringing us.\"  \"And I'm glad to have you here,\" said Mrs. Berry, entering the room. \"You're like a ray of sunshine in this dull house,--like four rays of sunshine.\"  \"But WHY are we here?\" insisted Alicia. \"You must know why, Mrs. Berry. Do tell us.\"  \"You're here, my dears, because Mr. Forbes invited you. There is no other reason,--no other explanation. And now, tell me, did you like the play?\"  \"Did we LIKE it!\" exclaimed the volatile Alicia, \"we're just crazy over it. Why, the chief actor--\"  \"Now, 'Licia,\" protested Dolly, \"if you're going to begin raving over that man again!\"  \"Well, I am!\" declared Alicia. \"I just can't help it!\"  Nor did she seem able to curb her enthusiasm, for after the girls went to their rooms, she kept on extolling Mr. Coriell until the others were tired of the subject.  And even when the D's were nearly ready for bed, and, in kimonos, were brushing their hair,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5893"],["title","Two Little Women on a Holiday (#8)"],["body"," Alicia burst into their room, exclaiming, \"I've the grandest plan! I'm going to invite Mr. Coriell to come here and call on me!\"  \"Alicia Steele!\" Dotty cried, \"you're not going to do any such thing!\"  \"Yes, I am. Uncle Jeff said we could invite anybody we wanted to,--that's permission enough for me.\"  \"But he didn't mean some one you don't know at all,--and an actor at that!\"  \"I don't care. He didn't make any exceptions, and I'm going to do it. I'm going to write the note.\"  She went back to her own room, and sat down at the pretty little escritoire that was there.  \"How shall I address him?\" she asked, but more of herself than the others.  \"Not at all!\" said Dolly, and she took the pen from Alicia's fingers. \"You must be crazy to think of such a thing!\"  \"Don't do it, Alicia,\" begged Dotty; \"tell her not to, Bernice.\"  \"I don't care what she does,\" and Bernice laughed. \"It's none of my affair. I think it would be rather good fun, only I know he wouldn't come.\"  \"I think he would,\" said Alicia. \"Anyway, I'm going to tell him how I adored his acting and his singing, and I guess he'll be glad to come to call at Jefferson Forbes' house! I think I'll ask him to afternoon tea. Why, it isn't such a terrible thing, as you seem to think, Dolly. Anybody has a right to write to an actor,--they expect it. He probably gets hundreds of notes every day.\"  \"Then he won't notice yours. He can't possibly accept a hundred invitations.\"  \"Oh, they don't all invite him. Any way, I'm going to write.\"  Alicia found another pen, and soon produced this effusion:  \"My dear Mr. Coriell.  \"I'm just simply crazy over your performance in 'The Lass and the Lascar' and I feel that I MUST meet you. I shall DIE if I don't! Please, oh, PLEASE give me an opportunity. Will you come to see me at my uncle's house, Mr. Jefferson Forbes? Can you come to-morrow or Friday? I can't EXIST if you say No! So grant the plea of  \"Your devoted admirer,  \"ALICIA STEELE.\"  \"It's perfectly horrid!\" and Dolly's fair face grew flushed with anger. \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Alicia.\"  \"Now, look here, Dolly Fayre,\" and Alicia's eyes flashed, \"I won't be dictated to by a little country ignoramus! I've had experience in the ways of the world, and you haven't. Now suppose you let me alone. It's none of your business, as you very well know.\"  \"Dolly was only advising you for your own good!\" Dotty flashed out, indignant at the rebuff to her chum; \"but, truly, Doll, it isn't up to you to tell Alicia what to do. This is her uncle's house, not yours, and you're in no way responsible for her doings.\"  \"I know it,\" and Dolly looked serious, \"but I know, too, Alicia will be sorry and ashamed if she sends that silly letter!\"  \"Let her be, then,\" counselled Bernice. \"If Uncle Jeff doesn't like it, that's Alicia's affair, not ours. Leave her alone, Dolly.\"  But Dolly made one more effort.  \"Listen, Alicia,\" she said, pleadingly; \"at least, ask Mrs. Berry's advice. She's awfully indulgent, you know, and if she says all right,--then go ahead.\"  Alicia looked at Dolly. To tell the truth, she had misgivings herself about the plan, but she was too proud to be advised.  \"I'll tell you what,\" she decided, at last; \"you said, only to-day, Dolly, that you'd be glad to do something for me. Now, prove that you meant it. You go and ask Mrs. Berry if we can do this. She's awfully fond of you, and she'd say yes to you quicker'n she would to me. So, if you're so anxious for her consent, go and ask her. She's in her room,--I just heard her go in.\"  \"But, Alicia,\" and Dolly looked dismayed, \"_I_ don't want to do this thing! Why should I ask Mrs. Berry for what YOU want?\"  \"Because you said you'd be glad to do me a favour. I knew you didn't mean it! I knew you'd fizzle out when the time came!\"  \"She hasn't fizzled out!\" exclaimed Dotty. \"Doll never breaks a promise. But, say, Alicia, I'll go and ask Mrs. Berry. How's that?\"  \"No, Dolly's got to go, if any one does. She said she'd love to do me a favour, now let her do it.\"  It was evidently a test case with Alicia, and one glance at her determined face convinced Dolly, that she would never be forgiven if she failed to do this thing.  \"All right,\" she said, slowly, \"I'll go and ask Mrs. Berry. But I shall tell her it's for you, Alicia. I shan't let her think I want to ask that man here!\"  \"Hold on, Dolly. Don't you think it would be nice if he should come, with Mrs. Berry's permission?\"  \"Yes, I think that would be lots of fun; but she won't give permission, Alicia. I know that as well as I know my own name!\"  \"Of course, she won't, if you go about it that way! I depend on you to coax her or get around her some way to MAKE her say yes. See? Don't think that you can go in there and say 'May we?' and have her say 'No,' and let that end it! I tell you you've got to get her consent. You've got to do this for me, because you said you'd do whatever I asked you.\"  \"Oh, Alicia!\" and Dotty shook her head vigorously, \"Doll never said THAT!\"  \"Well, she meant that. And what's the use of her doing anything I can do for myself? But you all know she's Mrs. Berry's pet of the four of us--\"  \"No, I'm not,\" and Dolly looked deeply troubled.  \"Yes, you are, and it's just because you're so mild and meek. Now, will you go and ask her? You'll have to be quick or she'll have gone to bed.\"  \"Yes, I'll go,\" and Dolly showed sudden determination.  \"And will you promise to do all you can to make her say yes--\"  \"I'll do that, Alicia, but I can't promise to make her say yes.\"  \"You can if you coax her. And don't let her think it's all for my benefit. Because it isn't. You girls will have just as much fun as I will, if he comes.\"  Dolly twisted up her golden curls in a loose knot, and still in her trailing dressing-gown, she went down the hall to Mrs. Berry's room and tapped gently at the door.  It was opened at once, and Dolly was glad to see Mrs. Berry had not yet begun her preparations for the night, so she was not disturbing her.  \"What is it, dearie?\" asked the kind-hearted lady; \"come in. Sit down.\"  Dolly sat down in a little rocker, and was suddenly seized with a fit of shyness. The request she had come to make seemed so impossible, that she couldn't put it into words. Mrs. Berry saw her embarrassment, and kindly strove to put her at ease.  \"How do you like my room?\" she said, cordially; \"you've never been in here before.\"  \"It's lovely,\" said Dolly, looking about at the pretty furnishings; \"it's in a sort of back extension, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, this a narrower part of the house, and gives me an outlook on our tiny yard as well as on the side street. It's a very satisfactory room, except for my neighbour,\" and she laughed.  \"Who is the unsatisfactory neighbour?\" asked Dolly, smiling in response.  \"Not the people next door, they're quiet enough; but they have a parrot, and he's in the room just across from this, and he chatters so often that it is sometimes very annoying. Look over, you can see him now.\"  Sure enough, as Dolly looked from the window, she saw a big Polly in a cage at the opposite casement. Only thin lace curtains were between, and Dolly could clearly see the beautiful bird.  \"It's a lovely parrot,\" she said, \"but I suppose his chatter is just as bothersome as if he were a homelier bird. Well, Mrs. Berry,\" and she turned from the window, \"I've come to ask you something.\"  \"And something that you hesitate to ask,--I can see that. But don't be afraid, dear. Tell me what it is, and if I have to refuse you, at least I won't do it harshly.\"  \"I know you won't!\" and Dolly felt ashamed of her fears. \"Well, it's just this. Alicia,--that is, we're all of us just crazy over the hero in the play we saw this afternoon, and we--that is, we think it would be nice if we could--if we could ask him to--to call here, on us.\"  The dreaded speech was made, and though Mrs. Berry looked surprised, she didn't exclaim in horror at the idea.  \"Whose plan is this?\" she asked, quietly.  \"Why,--well,--we all want it.\"  \"Yes, but who first thought of it?\"  \"Alicia spoke of it, and--the others agreed,--we all agreed,--that it would be lots of fun,--if you approved of it.\" Now Mrs. Berry could see a hole through a millstone, and she knew as well as if she had been told, that the others had planned this thing,--probably Alicia or Bernice,--and had made Dolly their spokesman, because of her good-natured acquiescence.  \"What do YOU think of the idea?\" she said smiling.  \"At first it seemed to me a very forward thing to do,\" Dolly replied, looking very sober; \"but if you think it's all right, I'd like to meet Mr. Coriell. You see, I'm going to be an opera singer myself, some day, and there are a few questions I'd like to ask him.\"  Mrs. Berry gasped. \"You do beat the dickens!\" she exclaimed. \"So you're going on the stage, are you?\"  \"Yes, I think so.\"  \"Then of course you ought to meet an actor. Tell Alicia to go ahead and ask this man. Tell her to invite him to tea on Friday. I'll arrange a pretty tea-party for you.\"  \"Oh, I'll tell her! She'll be SO glad!\" and Dolly departed, quite unconscious that she had unwittingly betrayed Alicia's principal part in the scheme.     CHAPTER VII  GREAT PREPARATIONS   Demurely Dolly went back to her room. The other girls were breathlessly awaiting her return, and pounced on her for the news.  \"At least you got back alive!\" cried Dotty as she grabbed Dolly by the arms and danced her up and down the room.  \"But what did she say?\" demanded Alicia, in fiery impatience.  \"Don't you wish you knew!\" and Dolly fell into a teasing mood, and when Dolly Fayre felt like teasing, she was adept at it!  \"Tell us! Tell us!\" cried Bernice. \"Oh, Dolly, tell us!\"  \"Tell you what?\" asked Dolly, with an innocent stare.  \"Tell us what Mrs. Berry said.\"  \"Oh, she asked me how I liked her room, and she showed me the parrot next door. It's a beautiful bird--\"  \"Never mind a bird! What did she say about Mr. Coriell?\"  \"Why, we talked about the parrot first. You"]]]
