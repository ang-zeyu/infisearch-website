And of course none of you will be so unkind as to remind him of what he said.\"  The students rose thoughtfully to their feet, and Ernol passed out with the rest. He had no idea what it was all about, nor the slightest suspicion that his eyes and ears had been used.  But the doctor had learned something of enormous value. He had learned that, when his agent was in a semiconscious state, his--the doctor's--conscious mind could influence the agent.  It was not Ernol, but the doctor, who had made the slip!       VI  THE WORLD'S BOSSES      Van Emmon was afterward unable to recall any experience between his entering the sublimial state and becoming tele-conscious. That is, his only recollection was of a definite scene, experienced through the eyes and ears of his agent.  The place was a large high-ceilinged room, its architecture suggesting some public building. In the center, and directly in front of Van Emmon's agent, stood a large, rectangular table, about which sat a number of men. Van Emmon counted nine of them.  The whole atmosphere was solemn and important. Van Emmon was reminded of old photographs of cabinet meetings in Washington, of strategy boards during the great war. He listened intently for something to be said.  Near the foot of the table--Van Emmon's agent sat at the head--a tall man with an imposing, square-cut beard rose to his feet. He gazed at each of the other eight in turn, significantly; and when he spoke the geologist was so impressed with the deadly seriousness of the scene that he forgot to be amazed at his ability to understand what was said, forgot to marvel that these men were, undeniably, human beings of exceptional character.  \"Gentlemen,\" said the man who had risen, \"I do not need to remind you of the seriousness of this occasion. I only wish to congratulate you, and myself, on the fact that we now have a chairman to whom we can look with confidence. I say this without meaning any reflection upon his predecessor.\"  He sat down, and immediately a white-haired man with a wide, complacent type of face arose and declared: \"No reflection is felt, sir. On the contrary, I am exceedingly glad that Mr. Powart is to take my place. I only wish that the commission felt free to discard its rule of choosing by lots; I should like to present Mr. Powart with the chair for as long a period as he would care to fill it.\"  He took his seat amid a general murmur of approval, while nine pair of eyes were turned in unison upon the pair Van Emmon was sharing. His agent, then, was chairman of some sort of a council, known as \"the commission.\"  Powart got to his feet. Even in this simple act his motions were swift and sure; they harmonized perfectly with the way he talked.  \"Thanks, both you. To be frank, I am glad, for the sake of the association, that the youngest commissioner has come to its head at this time. If there were a younger than myself, I would say the same.\"  He paused and glanced at some memoranda in his hand. Van Emmon was struck, first, by the smooth skin and perfect formation of the hand and wrist; and, second, by the peculiar writing on the papers. He had no idea what it meant, although his agent certainly did. (Afterward the four concluded that, in the case of words written in code or otherwise requiring an effort of the agent's conscious mind, the people on the earth, being in touch only with the subconscious, were never informed. But they never had any trouble in understanding anything that was said aloud.)  \"If there are any special matters which should be handled in general session, now is the time to bring them up,\" said Powart, and remained standing.  An undersized man with a remarkably large head of hair spoke up from the righthand side of the table: \"I want to suggest that it is high time we sent another expedition to Alma.\"  \"I agree,\" from the man who had been Powart's predecessor. Apparently these ten men had nearly dispensed with parlimentary rules. \"What are the prospects, Powart?\"  \"First rate. Runled's old space-boat has been renovated recently, and I understand that enough of the required materials have been mined to insure one round trip.\"  \"It is very fortunate that we shall be able to visit Alma again, even though we use up our entire supply in the attempt. It seems that we shall soon need, and need badly, certain chemical secrets which they alone possess.\"  \"When can the boat start?\"  \"Within a week. I shall keep in touch with the crew by wireless, and advise you of their progress from time to time. Alma is a sort of a hobby with me; I wouldn't mind taking the trip myself.\"  There was a long pause. Powart waited, as though in expectation of further remarks, then gave another glance at his memoranda and began:  \"Of course, we are mainly concerned with the demonstration in Calastia. As to its cause, I may mention that Eklan Norbith was in a hospital at the time, having a substitution. Had he been on the spot, the uprising would have been checked before any one heard of it.  \"But it now seems that Calastia, during the last few hours, has become a seething hotbed of rebellion. Of course, we have isolated the district, and a search for arms is now in progress.  \"The head of the recalcitrants is a man named Ernol. He takes his confinement as a matter of course, and no amount of pressure will induce him to talk. Neither can we get anything from his companions, nor from his son.  \"It is up to us to decide what measures to adopt.\"  A large, pugnacious-looking man on the left put in the first comment. \"Would it not be a saving of time to provoke violence, in one way or another, and thus form a pretext for disposing of the entire lot?\"  \"I admire your bluntness,\" remarked the former chairman across the table, \"although I can't say as much for your philosophy. It is our duty to keep everybody contented; we cannot do any public weeding-out until the others are satisfied that the malcontents are really weeds.\"  \"That is clear enough,\" spoke the shock-headed man. \"What are the conditions, Powart?\"  \"Nearly normal. The percentage of overhead is only slightly higher than average. Until Ernol moved into the locality every one seemed contented with the regular arrangements.\"  \"What is his contention?\"  \"The usual democratic nonsense. He claims that the commission is autocratic, down to its last deputy. Denies that we have the right to apportion one-half the earnings to the workers and the other half to the owners. States that our system is wasteful, unjust, and demoralizing.\"  \"And what does he propose?\"  \"Democratic control of industry. You know--that old line of talk.\"  \"Does he deny that the commission has abolished poverty and war?\"  \"No; but he points out that our present standard of living has not changed for generations, and argues that degeneration must result. Of course, he is right in his fact but wrong in his conclusion.\"  \"Doesn't he admit the necessity of some sort of an international governing body?\"  \"Yes; but he claims that the commission should be elected by direct vote of the people!\"  A general smile of derision greeted this. The only face that remained serious was that of the shock-headed man. He said:  \"There must be a slip somewhere, Powart. Isn't there a heavy fine and imprisonment for teaching such stuff? How did Ernol ever get hold of the notion?\"  \"Probably through tradition. We can't keep people from talking to their own children; perhaps Ernol's great-grandparents told him of the days when every one was allowed to vote.\"  The shock-headed man got another idea. \"What has the man to say against our system of voting in proportion to property interests?\"  \"Says it's all right in principle; but he claims that the earth belongs to one and all, equally, and therefore each should have an equal voice in its disposition and government.\"  This time there was no smiling. The pugnacious-looking man spoke for the rest when he said:  \"We cannot allow such ideas to gain headway, Powart! Have you a plan?\"  \"We must keep a close watch upon Calastia, and allow no one to leave its borders. As for Ernol, I have concluded that the best thing will be--turn him loose!\"  They looked at him in consternation. He explained:  \"I have been reading up the experience of the past few centuries in such cases; and if there is one thing that stands out clearer than any other it is this: the surest way to make the public sympathize with a radical is to persecute him. But disregard him and ridicule him, and his philosophy doesn't last long.  \"Instead of trying to make an example of this chap, by severely punishing him, we shall let him go. It may be that he will object to this; he may have discovered the same truths I have been reading, and would like nothing better than to become a 'martyr.' But we shall force him out, if need be.\"  \"But suppose he continues his talking?\"  \"In that case we must simply watch our chance, and take him secretly; if need be, arrest a thousand others at the same time. The main thing is secrecy; so that the people cannot know, no matter what they may suspect, what has become of him. His final dispostion will be a question of mere exediency.\"  The former chairman approved heartily. \"You've got the right idea, Powart. Is there anything further on tap?\"  Powart put his notes away. \"Every national report is the same as usual; all quiet, and people apparently well satisfied.  \"If there is no further business, we may consider ourselves adjourned.\"  The men got to their feet with the usual accompanying noises. The tall man with the square-cut beard immediately came and offered Powart his hand. Van Emmon noticed that they shook hands almost exactly as Americans would.  \"Things seem to be coming your way, my boy,\" said the bearded man, his keen eyes softening slightly. \"I saw"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5965"],["title","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix (#6)"],["body","paper this morning. Congratulations! She is one girl in millions. Has she fixed the date?\"  \"No. Mona was rather taken by surprise--to be frank with you, uncle.\"  As Powart spoke, he was eyeing the door and nodding permission for an attendant to enter. The man stepped obsequiously forward and presented a message, for all the world like any ordinary aerogram. Powart opened it while his uncle signed.  The chairman gave a low whistle of surprise. \"Mona had an accident with her flier, a little while ago, and was rescued by \"--he looked closer at the aerogram--\"a chap named Fort. She is now recuperating on board the Cobulus.\"  The tall man took the message and read it himself, while Powart glanced about the room. Van Emmon caught a glimpse of a clock, and he noted the pendulum especially. But before he could learn anything further, Dr. Kinney's hand jerked as before, and the gong rang. The four awakened.  They had been \"visiting\" over an hour.       VII  A WORLD BECALMED      \"I think we have learned enough to form some general conclusions,\" said the doctor, after the four had told what each had heard and seen. \"Van Emmon's friend, Powart, seems to be anything but a democrat. He probably represents the most aristocratic element on the planet; while this man Fort, who rescued the girl, is also probably a member of the leisure class.  \"On the other hand, we have Smith's agent, whose name we do not know; he seems to be one of the working class, which Powart despises. The two are at opposite ends of the social scale. Young Ernol, whose father is in trouble, appears to be a rising young revolutionist.  \"But Mona--to use the name Powart gave his fiancee--Billie's surgeon--the girl whose life Fort saved--she is not so easy to classify. On the earth we would call her occupation a middle-class one; but that remark she made about people being cattle gives me the impression that she is an aristocrat at heart. I call her a mystery, for the time being.  \"As for the planet itself--of course, the people simply refer to it as the earth, or some term which translates that way to us. We need a name for it. What shall we call her--this daughter of Capella's?\"  \"Capellette,\" from Billie promptly.  \"Fine!\" The other two looked their approval. \"Now, we are ready to analyze things. What shall we say of her people in general?\"  \"Speaking for my surgeon,\" observed Billie, \"doesn't she argue a rather high degree of development?\"  The others were plainly willing for the doctor to take the lead. He rubbed his knuckles harder than ever as he considered Billie's suggestion.  \"A higher degree of development? H-m! Not easy to say. Safer to assume that the development is higher in spots, not in general. Perhaps we'll do well to consider other things first.  \"Take those two clocks, for instance. The one that I saw had a pendulum of ordinary length, which vibrated twice as fast as that\"--indicating an astronomical clock at his side. \"What about the time-piece you saw, Van?\"  \"Twenty-five-hour dial, and a pendulum of the usual length, same as yours. But--it vibrated no faster than any I ever saw before.\"  \"You're sure?\" At the emphatic nod the doctor frowned. \"We are forced to conclude that Capellette is not as round as our earth. No other way to account for such a difference in gravitation as the two clocks indicate. Roughly, I should say that the planet's diameter, at the place where I saw the clock, is fifty per cent greater than at the point where Van's agent is located; maybe ten thousand miles in its greatest diameter, Capellette.  \"Having greater gravitation would explain why that disabled aircraft which Smith saw fell so very slowly; the planet has much more air than the earth, which means far greater density near the surface. It also explains those big sailing cruisers; nothing else can.  \"At any rate, we can guess why we have seen no surface travel. The people of Capellette never tried to work out such a thing as an automobile; why should they, with the birds to imitate, and extra dense air all about them?  \"I think we have found the key.\" The doctor cogitated for a second or two.  \"However, let's consider that schoolroom a bit. It was in no way different from what you will find on the earth right now. Why?\"  Smith had a notion. \"There is such a thing as perfection. Like some electrical apparatus; you simply can't improve them.\"  \"Sounds reasonable,\" from Van Emmon.  \"Yes. And that is undoubtedly how the Capellettes look at the matter.  \"Why haven't they got talking-pictures? Because they've perfected the silent variety, of course. Why don't they reform their ways of living, instead of replacing a worn-out heart with a new one? They've perfected surgery, that's why! And why haven't they tried the screw-propeller? They've perfected the bird-wing principle!\"  \"But that doesn't explain,\" objected Billie, \"why they've been content with an autocratic system of government.\"  Van Emmon considered this a dig at Powart. \"Why, of course their government is autocratic, dear! How else can it be protective?\"  \"You seem to have a lot of admiration for your Mr. Powart,\" laying her hand on his.  \"I have. He and the others seem to be highly capable fellows, who have undertaken to maintain happiness, and have made good.\"  \"But without the direct consent of the people.\"  \"What of that?\" warmly. \"Most folks don't care to burden their heads with law-making, anyhow. They'd rather leave it up to specialists.\"  \"Who are only too willing, my dear, to handle the matter--at their own price!\"  The doctor put in hastily: \"From what you tell me, Van, this commission determines the living conditions for the majority, although it has no popular authority whatever. Moreover, conditions are no better than they were a hundred years ago. There's been no progress. Powart admits that.  \"Now, placing that fact alongside the rest, I reach this conclusion: that the people of Capallette, no matter what may have been their experience in the past, do not now care for revolutionary ideas. They want standardization, not change.  \"It all roots back in that extra dense air of theirs. See why?\"  Apparently the three did not. The doctor explained: \"Life is much easier for them than for us. It is no great struggle to gain a livelihood where transportation is so easy and simple. In consequence of this their advancement was much more rapid than ours here on the earth, up to a certain point; and they've reached that point already.  \"Coming back to that commission again: instead of trying out a democratic form of government, in which every citizen would be equally responsible regardless of property--they've standardized the protective, paternalistic principle.\"  \"Which is precisely the correct method!\" insisted the geologist. \"Radical changes of any kind are always dangerous. The only safe method is to improve what we already have.\"  \"Suppose,\" remarked Billie--\"suppose government becomes so thoroughly standardized that it can't be improved further?\"  \"Then it becomes permanent.\"  \"If it isn't overthrown.\"  The doctor smilingly interposed. \"Let me finish and get this out of my system. By their own confession, the commission's chief function is to keep the majority in ignorance, which is said to be the same thing as bliss. This man Ernol and his pitiful rebellion only serve to prove the rule.  \"In a word, the Capellans have carried the principle of improvement, as opposed to reform, to its logical conclusion. They can go no further.\"  \"And why not?\" challenged Van Emmon. \"Because the fittest have survived, on Capellette as elsewhere. These commissioners are the fittest.\"  The doctor nodded gravely. \"True enough, Van. But the point I want to make is, the commissioners have put an end to the processes of evolution. They won't allow progress. They stopped all that a century ago.  \"Friend, Capellette is a world that has given up. It has quit!\"       VIII  THE UPPER CRUST      The next time Billie went into the tele-conscious state, forty-eight hours later, she found that she had \"arrived\" in the midst of a conversation. It told her worlds.  \"I answered the telephone,\" some one was saying, \"and Mr. Powart clearly said that he would be here within the hour.\" [Footnote: The word hour is used advisedly. Of course, the Capellan hour may have an entirely different length from ours.]  \"I suppose it is just as well,\" answered the surgeon whom Billie now knew as Mona. \"Yes, I dare say it is quite as well.\"  \"Is there any reason why he shouldn't, dear?\" inquired the other party, a middle-aged woman, magnificently dressed, of decidedly distinguished appearance.  \"No, mother,\" replied the girl; \"not so far as he is concerned. But--Mr. Fort also is coming to-day.\"  The older woman saw nothing alarming about this. \"I am glad to hear it. He impressed me as being a very nice boy, although rather impulsive.\"  \"You don't understand. It's going to be very embarrassing for me. Mr. Fort warned me last night--laughingly, of course, but I think he meant it--that he intended to propose to-day.\"  Swift anxiety came to the mother's face. For a while she kept silence. And while Mona's conscious mind was occupied with thoughts which Billie could not fathom, her subconscious mind was faithfully taking in all that her roving eyes beheld.  The two Capellans were seated upon the terrace of a large, handsome house, whose architecture Billie tentatively classified as semi-Moorish. Mona next glanced into the grounds, telling Billie that the house was set upon a knoll, high up on the ridge of a tremendous range of mountains. Similar houses dotted what landscape was visible through a mass of foliage. It was just the sort of residence colony that Billie herself would have chosen.  Then the eyes came back to the mother, who was saying: \"Perhaps, my dear, you would rather that I told Mr. Fort of your engagement.\" She watched the daughter as though expecting her to refuse the offer.  Which is just what the heart-specialist did, with a "]]]
