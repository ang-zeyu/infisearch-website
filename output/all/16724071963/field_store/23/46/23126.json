The troubled night-bird, calling plaintively, Wanders on restless wing; The cedars, chanting vespers to the sea, Await its answering, That comes in wash of waves along the strand, The while the moon slips into shadow-land.  O! soft responsive voices of the night I join your minstrelsy, And call across the fading silver light As something calls to me; I may not all your meaning understand, But I have touched your soul in shadow-land.    MARSHLANDS   A thin wet sky, that yellows at the rim, And meets with sun-lost lip the marsh's brim.  The pools low lying, dank with moss and mould, Glint through their mildews like large cups of gold.  Among the wild rice in the still lagoon, In monotone the lizard shrills his tune.  The wild goose, homing, seeks a sheltering, Where rushes grow, and oozing lichens cling.  Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight, Sail up the silence with the nearing night.  And like a spirit, swathed in some soft veil, Steals twilight and its shadows o'er the swale.  Hushed lie the sedges, and the vapours creep, Thick, grey and humid, while the marshes sleep.    JOE   AN ETCHING  A meadow brown; across the yonder edge A zigzag fence is ambling; here a wedge Of underbush has cleft its course in twain, Till where beyond it staggers up again; The long, grey rails stretch in a broken line Their ragged length of rough, split forest pine, And in their zigzag tottering have reeled In drunken efforts to enclose the field, Which carries on its breast, September born, A patch of rustling, yellow, Indian corn. Beyond its shrivelled tassels, perched upon The topmost rail, sits Joe, the settler's son, A little semi-savage boy of nine. Now dozing in the warmth of Nature's wine, His face the sun has tampered with, and wrought, By heated kisses, mischief, and has brought Some vagrant freckles, while from here and there A few wild locks of vagabond brown hair Escape the old straw hat the sun looks through, And blinks to meet his Irish eyes of blue. Barefooted, innocent of coat or vest, His grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest, Both hardy hands within their usual nest-- His breeches pockets--so, he waits to rest His little fingers, somewhat tired and worn, That all day long were husking Indian corn. His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound, With lazy yawns he slips towards the ground, Then with an idle whistle lifts his load And shambles home along the country road That stretches on, fringed out with stumps and weeds, And finally unto the backwoods leads, Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough The axe of pioneer, the settler's plough.    SHADOW RIVER   MUSKOKA  A stream of tender gladness, Of filmy sun, and opal tinted skies; Of warm midsummer air that lightly lies In mystic rings, Where softly swings The music of a thousand wings That almost tones to sadness.  Midway 'twixt earth and heaven, A bubble in the pearly air, I seem To float upon the sapphire floor, a dream Of clouds of snow, Above, below, Drift with my drifting, dim and slow, As twilight drifts to even.  The little fern-leaf, bending Upon the brink, its green reflection greets, And kisses soft the shadow that it meets With touch so fine, The border line The keenest vision can't define; So perfect is the blending.  The far, fir trees that cover The brownish hills with needles green and gold, The arching elms o'erhead, vinegrown and old, Repictured are Beneath me far, Where not a ripple moves to mar Shades underneath, or over.  Mine is the undertone; The beauty, strength, and power of the land Will never stir or bend at my command; But all the shade Is marred or made, If I but dip my paddle blade; And it is mine alone.  O! pathless world of seeming! O! pathless life of mine whose deep ideal Is more my own than ever was the real. For others Fame And Love's red flame, And yellow gold: I only claim The shadows and the dreaming.    RAINFALL   From out the west, where darkling storm-clouds float, The 'waking wind pipes soft its rising note.  From out the west, o'erhung with fringes grey, The wind preludes with sighs its roundelay,  Then blowing, singing, piping, laughing loud, It scurries on before the grey storm-cloud;  Across the hollow and along the hill It whips and whirls among the maples, till  With boughs upbent, and green of leaves blown wide, The silver shines upon their underside.  A gusty freshening of humid air, With showers laden, and with fragrance rare;  And now a little sprinkle, with a dash Of great cool drops that fall with sudden splash;  Then over field and hollow, grass and grain, The loud, crisp whiteness of the nearing rain.    UNDER CANVAS   IN MUSKOKA  Lichens of green and grey on every side; And green and grey the rocks beneath our feet; Above our heads the canvas stretching wide; And over all, enchantment rare and sweet.  Fair Rosseau slumbers in an atmosphere That kisses her to passionless soft dreams. O! joy of living we have found thee here, And life lacks nothing, so complete it seems.  The velvet air, stirred by some elfin wings, Comes swinging up the waters and then stills Its voice so low that floating by it sings Like distant harps among the distant hills.  Across the lake the rugged islands lie, Fir-crowned and grim; and further in the view Some shadows seeming swung 'twixt cloud and sky, Are countless shores, a symphony of blue.  Some northern sorceress, when day is done, Hovers where cliffs uplift their gaunt grey steeps, Bewitching to vermilion Rosseau's sun, That in a liquid mass of rubies sleeps.  The scent of burning leaves, the camp-fire's blaze, The great logs cracking in the brilliant flame, The groups grotesque, on which the firelight plays, Are pictures which Muskoka twilights frame.  And Night, star-crested, wanders up the mere With opiates for idleness to quaff, And while she ministers, far off I hear The owl's uncanny cry, the wild loon's laugh.    THE BIRDS' LULLABY   I  Sing to us, cedars; the twilight is creeping   With shadowy garments, the wilderness through; All day we have carolled, and now would be sleeping,   So echo the anthems we warbled to you;         While we swing, swing,         And your branches sing,     And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.  II  Sing to us, cedars; the night-wind is sighing,   Is wooing, is pleading, to hear you reply; And here in your arms we are restfully lying,   And longing to dream to your soft lullaby;         While we swing, swing,         And your branches sing,     And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.  III  Sing to us, cedars; your voice is so lowly,   Your breathing so fragrant, your branches so strong; Our little nest-cradles are swaying so slowly,   While zephyrs are breathing their slumberous song.         And we swing, swing,         While your branches sing,     And we drowse to your dreamy whispering.    OVERLOOKED   Sleep, with her tender balm, her touch so kind,         Has passed me by; Afar I see her vesture, velvet-lined,         Float silently; O! Sleep, my tired eyes had need of thee! Is thy sweet kiss not meant to-night for me?  Peace, with the blessings that I longed for so,         Has passed me by; Where'er she folds her holy wings I know         All tempests die; O! Peace, my tired soul had need of thee! Is thy sweet kiss denied alone to me?  Love, with her heated touches, passion-stirred,         Has passed me by. I called, \"O stay thy flight,\" but all unheard         My lonely cry: O! Love, my tired heart had need of thee! Is thy sweet kiss withheld alone from me?  Sleep, sister-twin of Peace, my waking eyes         So weary grow! O! Love, thou wanderer from Paradise,         Dost thou not know How oft my lonely heart has cried to thee? But Thou, and Sleep, and Peace, come not to me.    FASTING   'Tis morning now, yet silently I stand, Uplift the curtain with a weary hand, Look out while darkness overspreads the way,             And long for day.  Calm peace is frighted with my mood to-night, Nor visits my dull chamber with her light, To guide my senses into her sweet rest             And leave me blest.  Long hours since the city rocked and sung Itself to slumber: only the stars swung Aloft their torches in the midnight skies             With watchful eyes.  No sound awakes; I, even, breathe no sigh, Nor hear a single footstep passing by; Yet I am not alone, for now I feel             A presence steal  Within my chamber walls; I turn to see The sweetest guest that courts humanity; With subtle, slow enchantment draws she near,             And Sleep is here.  What care I for the olive branch of Peace? Kind Sleep will bring a thrice-distilled release, Nepenthes, that alone her mystic hand             Can understand.  And so she bends, this welcome sorceress, To crown my fasting with her light caress. Ah, sure my pain will vanish at the bliss             Of her warm kiss.  But still my duty lies in self-denial; I must refuse sweet Sleep, although the trial Will reawaken all my depth of pain.             So once again  I lift the curtain with a weary hand, With more than sorrow, silently I stand, Look out while darkness overspreads the way,             And long for day.  \"Go, Sleep,\" I say, \"before the darkness die, To one who needs you even more than I, For I can bear my part alone, but he             Has need of thee.  \"His poor tired eyes in vain have sought relief, His heart more tired still, with all its grief; His pain is deep, while mine is vague and dim,             Go thou to him.  \"When thou hast fanned him with thy drowsy wings, And laid thy lips upon the pulsing strings That in his soul with fret and fever burn,             To me return.\"  She goes. The air within the quiet street Reverberates to the passing of her feet; I watch her take her passage through the gloom             To your dear home.  Beloved, would you knew how sweet to me Is this denial, and how fervently I pray that Sleep may lift you to her breast,            And give you rest--  A privilege that she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5625"],["title","Flint and Feather: Collected Verse (#7)"],["body","can claim. Would that my heart could comfort you the same, But in the censer Sleep is swinging high,            All sorrows die.  She comes not back, yet all my miseries Wane at the thought of your calm sleeping eyes-- Wane, as I hear the early matin bell            The dawn foretell.  And so, dear heart, still silently I stand, Uplift the curtain with a weary hand, The long, long night has bitter been and lone,             But now 'tis gone.  Dawn lights her candles in the East once more, And darkness flees her chariot before; The Lenten morning breaks with holy ray,             And it is day!    CHRISTMASTIDE   I may not go to-night to Bethlehem, Nor follow star-directed ways, nor tread The paths wherein the shepherds walked, that led To Christ, and peace, and God's good will to men.  I may not hear the Herald Angel's song Peal through the Oriental skies, nor see The wonder of that Heavenly company Announce the King the world had waited long.  The manger throne I may not kneel before, Or see how man to God is reconciled, Through pure St. Mary's purer, holier child; The human Christ these eyes may not adore.  I may not carry frankincense and myrrh With adoration to the Holy One; Nor gold have I to give the Perfect Son, To be with those wise kings a worshipper.  Not mine the joy that Heaven sent to them, For ages since Time swung and locked his gates, But I may kneel without--the star still waits To guide me on to holy Bethlehem.    CLOSE BY   So near at hand (our eyes o'erlooked its nearness In search of distant things) A dear dream lay--perchance to grow in dearness Had we but felt its wings Astir. The air our very breathing fanned It was so near at hand.  Once, many days ago, we almost held it, The love we so desired; But our shut eyes saw not, and fate dispelled it Before our pulses fired To flame, and errant fortune bade us stand Hand almost touching hand.  I sometimes think had we two been discerning, The by-path hid away From others' eyes had then revealed its turning To us, nor led astray Our footsteps, guiding us into love's land That lay so near at hand.  So near at hand, dear heart, could we have known it! Throughout those dreamy hours, Had either loved, or loving had we shown it, Response had sure been ours; We did not know that heart could heart command, And love so near at hand!  What then availed the red wine's subtle glisten? We passed it blindly by, And now what profit that we wait and listen Each for the other's heart beat? Ah! the cry Of love o'erlooked still lingers, you and I Sought heaven afar, we did not understand 'Twas--once so near at hand.    THE IDLERS   The sun's red pulses beat, Full prodigal of heat, Full lavish of its lustre unrepressed; But we have drifted far From where his kisses are, And in this landward-lying shade we let our paddles rest.  The river, deep and still, The maple-mantled hill, The little yellow beach whereon we lie, The puffs of heated breeze, All sweetly whisper--These Are days that only come in a Canadian July.  So, silently we two Lounge in our still canoe, Nor fate, nor fortune matters to us now: So long as we alone May call this dream our own, The breeze may die, the sail may droop, we care not when or how.  Against the thwart, near by, Inactively you lie, And all too near my arm your temple bends. Your indolently crude, Abandoned attitude, Is one of ease and art, in which a perfect languor blends.  Your costume, loose and light, Leaves unconcealed your might Of muscle, half suspected, half defined; And falling well aside, Your vesture opens wide, Above your splendid sunburnt throat that pulses unconfined.  With easy unreserve, Across the gunwale's curve, Your arm superb is lying, brown and bare; Your hand just touches mine With import firm and fine, (I kiss the very wind that blows about your tumbled hair).  Ah! Dear, I am unwise In echoing your eyes Whene'er they leave their far-off gaze, and turn To melt and blur my sight; For every other light Is servile to your cloud-grey eyes, wherein cloud shadows burn.  But once the silence breaks, But once your ardour wakes To words that humanize this lotus-land; So perfect and complete Those burning words and sweet, So perfect is the single kiss your lips lay on my hand.  The paddles lie disused, The fitful breeze abused, Has dropped to slumber, with no after-blow; And hearts will pay the cost, For you and I have lost More than the homeward blowing wind that died an hour ago.    AT SUNSET   To-night the west o'er-brims with warmest dyes; Its chalice overflows With pools of purple colouring the skies, Aflood with gold and rose; And some hot soul seems throbbing close to mine, As sinks the sun within that world of wine.  I seem to hear a bar of music float And swoon into the west; My ear can scarcely catch the whispered note, But something in my breast Blends with that strain, till both accord in one, As cloud and colour blend at set of sun.  And twilight comes with grey and restful eyes, As ashes follow flame. But O! I heard a voice from those rich skies Call tenderly my name; It was as if some priestly fingers stole In benedictions o'er my lonely soul.  I know not why, but all my being longed And leapt at that sweet call; My heart outreached its arms, all passion thronged And beat against Fate's wall, Crying in utter homesickness to be Near to a heart that loves and leans to me.    PENSEROSO   Soulless is all humanity to me To-night. My keenest longing is to be Alone, alone with God's grey earth that seems Pulse of my pulse and consort of my dreams.  To-night my soul desires no fellowship, Or fellow-being; crave I but to slip Thro' space on space, till flesh no more can bind, And I may quit for aye my fellow kind.  Let me but feel athwart my cheek the lash Of whipping wind, but hear the torrent dash Adown the mountain steep, 'twere more my choice Than touch of human hand, than human voice.  Let me but wander on the shore night-stilled, Drinking its darkness till my soul is filled; The breathing of the salt sea on my hair, My outstretched hands but grasping empty air.  Let me but feel the pulse of Nature's soul Athrob on mine, let seas and thunders roll O'er night and me; sands whirl; winds, waters beat; For God's grey earth has no cheap counterfeit.    RE-VOYAGE   What of the days when we two dreamed together?   Days marvellously fair, As lightsome as a skyward floating feather   Sailing on summer air-- Summer, summer, that came drifting through Fate's hand to me, to you.  What of the days, my dear? I sometimes wonder   If you too wish this sky Could be the blue we sailed so softly under,   In that sun-kissed July; Sailed in the warm and yellow afternoon, With hearts in touch and tune.  Have you no longing to re-live the dreaming,   Adrift in my canoe? To watch my paddle blade all wet and gleaming   Cleaving the waters through? To lie wind-blown and wave-caressed, until Your restless pulse grows still?  Do you not long to listen to the purling   Of foam athwart the keel? To hear the nearing rapids softly swirling   Among their stones, to feel The boat's unsteady tremor as it braves The wild and snarling waves?  What need of question, what of your replying?   Oh! well I know that you Would toss the world away to be but lying   Again in my canoe, In listless indolence entranced and lost, Wave-rocked, and passion tossed.  Ah me! my paddle failed me in the steering   Across love's shoreless seas; All reckless, I had ne'er a thought of fearing   Such dreary days as these, When through the self-same rapids we dash by, My lone canoe and I.    BRIER   GOOD FRIDAY  Because, dear Christ, your tender, wounded arm   Bends back the brier that edges life's long way, That no hurt comes to heart, to soul no harm,   I do not feel the thorns so much to-day.  Because I never knew your care to tire,   Your hand to weary guiding me aright, Because you walk before and crush the brier,   It does not pierce my feet so much to-night.  Because so often you have hearkened to   My selfish prayers, I ask but one thing now, That these harsh hands of mine add not unto   The crown of thorns upon your bleeding brow.    WAVE-WON   To-night I hunger so, Beloved one, to know If you recall and crave again the dream That haunted our canoe, And wove its witchcraft through Our hearts as 'neath the northern night we sailed the northern stream.  Ah! dear, if only we As yesternight could be Afloat within that light and lonely shell, To drift in silence till Heart-hushed, and lulled and still The moonlight through the melting air flung forth its fatal spell.  The dusky summer night, The path of gold and white The moon had cast across the river's breast, The shores in shadows clad, The far-away, half-sad Sweet singing of the whip-poor-will, all soothed our souls to rest.  You trusted I could feel My arm as strong as steel, So still your upturned face, so calm your breath, While circling eddies curled, While laughing rapids whirled From boulder unto boulder, till they dashed themselves to death.  Your splendid eyes aflame Put heaven's stars to shame, Your god-like head so near my lap was laid-- My hand is burning where It touched your wind-blown hair, As sweeping to the rapids verge, I changed my paddle blade.  The boat obeyed my hand, Till wearied with its grand Wild anger, all the river lay aswoon, And as my paddle dipped, Thro' pools of pearl it slipped And swept beneath a shore of shade, beneath a velvet moon.  To-night, again dream you Our spirit-winged canoe Is listening to the rapids purling past? Where, in delirium reeled Our maddened hearts that kneeled To idolize the perfect world, to taste of love at last.    THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS   Into the rose gold westland, its yellow prairies roll, World of the bison's freedom, home of the Indian's soul. Roll out, O seas! in sunlight bathed, Your plains wind-tossed, and grass enswathed.  Farther than vision ranges, farther than eagles fly, Stretches the land of beauty, arches the perfect sky, Hemm'"]]]
