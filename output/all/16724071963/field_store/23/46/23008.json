D.W.]      BARBARA BLOMBERG  By Georg Ebers  Volume 5.   CHAPTER XXI.  The Emperor Charles loved his sister Mary, and he now desired to show her how dear she was to his heart.  She had been obliging to him, and he had in mind the execution of a great enterprise which she had hitherto zealously opposed, yet for which he needed her co-operation.  It satisfied him to know that the father of his love would be absent from Ratisbon for the present.  He did not care who accompanied him.  When the regent reproached him for having taken Sir Wolf Hartschwert from her without a word of consultation, although she was unwilling to spare him, he had instantly placed Wolf at her disposal again.  The simplest and cheapest plan would have been to let Blomberg pursue his journey alone; but the monarch feared that the despatch might not be quickly delivered if anything happened to the old man on the way, and he had said before witnesses that he would not allow him to go without companionship.  He scarcely thought of Barbara's filial feeling.  She loved him, and the place which she gave to any one else in her heart could and must therefore be extremely small.  How powerfully the passionate love for this girl had seized him he dared not confess to himself.  But he rejoiced in the late love which rejuvenated him and filled him with a joy in existence whose fresh blossoming would have seemed impossible a few days before.  How superb a creature he had found in this German city, from which, since its change of religion, he had withdrawn his former favour!  In his youth his heart had throbbed ardently for many a fair woman, but she surpassed in beauty, in swift intelligence, in fervour, in artistic ability, and, above all, in sincere, unfeigned devotion every one whom his faithful memory recalled.  He would hold fast to the loved one who bestowed this happiness and fresh vigour of youth.  To make warm the nest which was to receive his dear nightingale he had conquered the economy which was beginning to degenerate into avarice, and also intended to accomplish other sacrifices in order to procure her the position which she deserved.  He no longer knew that he had wounded her deeply the night before.  He was in the habit of casting aside whatever displeased him unless it appeared advantageous to impose restraint upon himself; and who would ever have dared to resist the expression of his indignation?  Had Barbara obeyed her hasty temper and returned him a sharp answer, he certainly would not have forgotten it.  The bare thought of her dispelled melancholy thoughts from his mind; the hope of soon seeing and hearing her again rendered him friendly and yielding to those about him.  The trivial sin which this sweet love secret contained had been pardoned in the case of the man bound by no older obligation, after a slight penance, and now for the first time he fully enjoyed the wealth of the unexpected new happiness.  It must also be acceptable to Heaven, for this was distinctly shown by the more and more favourable turn of politics, and he held the return gift.  That it was the right one was proved by the nature of the gratifying news brought by the very last despatches.  They urged him directly toward the war which hitherto, from the most serious motives, he had avoided, and, as his royal sister correctly saw, would destroy a slowly matured, earnest purpose; for it forced him to renounce the hope of effecting at Trent a reformation of the Church according to his own ideas, and a restoration of the unity of religion in a peaceful manner by yielding on one side and reasonable concessions on the other.  He had long since perceived that many things in the old form of religion needed reformation.  If war was declared, he would be compelled to resign the hope that these would be undertaken by Rome, and the opposition, the defiance, the bold rebellion of the Protestant princes destroyed every hope of propitiation on their part.  They were forcing him to draw the sword, and he might venture to do so at this time, for he need now feel no fear of serious opposition from any of the great powers around him. Maurice of Saxony, too, was on the point of withdrawing from the Smalkalds and becoming his ally; so, with the assistance of Heaven, he might hope to win the victory for the cause of the Church, and with it also that of the crown.  With regard to the probability of this war, he had much to expect from the activity of his sister in the Netherlands, and though she now advocated peace, in the twelfth hour, which must soon strike, he could rely upon her.  Yet she was a woman, and it was necessary to bind her to him by every tie of the heart and intellect.  He loved Barbara as warmly as he was capable of loving; but had Mary that evening required his separation from the singer as the price of her assistance in promoting his plans, the desire of the heart would perhaps have yielded to the wishes of the statesman.  But the regent did not impose this choice; she did not grudge him his late happiness, and gratefully appreciated the transformation which Barbara's rare gifts had wrought.  The affectionate sister's heart wished that the bond which produced so favourable a result might be of the longest possible duration, and she had therefore personally attended to the furnishing of the Prebrunn house, and made all sorts of arrangements to render Barbara's life with the marquise, not only endurable, but pleasant.  The Emperor had allowed a considerable sum for this purpose, but she did not trouble herself about the amount allotted.  If she exceeded it, Charles must undertake the payment, whether he desired it or not.  Her vivid imagination had showed her how she, in the Emperor's place, would treat the object of his love, and she acted accordingly, without questioning him or the girl for whom her arrangements were made.  Nothing was too expensive for the favoured being who dispelled the Emperor's melancholy, and she had proved how much can be accomplished in a brief space where there is good will on all sides.  By her orders entirely separate suites of apartments had been prepared for Barbara and the marquise.  Quijada had selected four of her own saddle horses for the stable of the little castle, and supplied it with the necessary servants.  Her steward had been commissioned to provide the servants wanted in the kitchen, and one of her Netherland officials had received orders to manage the household of the marquise and her companion, and in doing so to anticipate Barbara's wishes in the most attentive manner.  One of her best maids, the worthy and skilful Frau Lamperi, though she was reluctant to part with her, had been sent to Prebrunn to serve Barbara as garde-robiere.  The advice that the Emperor's love should take her own waiting maid also came from her.  She knew the value, amid new circumstances, of a person long known and trusted.  The idea that Barbara would take her own maid with her rested, it is true, on the supposition that so well-dressed a young lady, who belonged to an ancient family, must as surely possess such a person as eyes and hands.  Barbara had just induced Frau Lerch to accompany her to Prebrunn.  The old woman's opposition had only been intended to extort more favourable terms.  She knew nothing of the regent's arrangements.  Queen Mary was grateful to Charles for so readily restoring the useful Sir Wolf Hartschwert, and when the latter presented himself he was received even more graciously than usual.  She had some work ready for him.  A letter in relation to the betrothal of her nieces, the daughters of King Ferdinand, was to be sent to the Imperial Councillor Schonberg at Vienna.  It must be written in German, because the receiver understood no other language.  After she had told the knight the purpose of the letter, she left him; the vesper service summoned her, and afterward Barbara detained her as she sang to the Emperor, alone and accompanied by Appenzelder's boy choir, several songs, and in a manner so thoroughly artistic that the Queen lingered not only in obedience to her brother's wish, but from pleasure in the magnificent music, until the end of the concert.  Just as Wolf, seated in the writing room, which was always at his disposal, finished the letter, the major-domo, Don Luis Quijada, sought him.  He had already intimated several times that he had something in view for him which promised to give Wolf's life, in his opinion, a new and favourable turn.  Now he made his proposal.  The duties imposed upon him by the service compelled him to live apart from his beloved, young, and beautiful wife, Dona Magdalena de Ulloa, who had remained at his castle Villagarcia in Spain.  She possessed but one true comforter in her solitude--music.  But the person who had hitherto instructed her--the family chaplain--was dead.  So far as his ability and his taste were concerned, it would have been easy to replace him, but Quijada sought in his successor qualities which rarely adorned a single individual, but which he expected to find united in the knight.  In the first place, the person he desired must be, like the chaplain, of noble birth; for to see his wife closely associated with a man of inferior station was objectionable to the Spanish grandee, who was perhaps the most popular of all the officers in the army, not only on account of his valour in the field, but also for the kindly good will and absolute justice which he bestowed upon even the humblest soldier.  That the chaplain's successor must be a good artist, thoroughly familiar with Netherland and Italian music, was a matter of course.  But Don Luis also demanded from Dona Magdalena's new teacher and household companion graceful manners, a modest"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5565"],["title","Barbara Blomberg — Volume 05 (#1)"],["body","sition, and, above all things, a character on which he could absolutely rely.  Not that he would have cherished any fears of the fidelity of the wife whom he honoured as the purest and noblest of her sex, and of whom he spoke to the knight with reverence and love; he desired only to guard her from any occurrence that might offend her.  Wolf listened in surprise.  He had firmly resolved that on no account would he stay in Ratisbon.  What could he find save fresh anxiety and never-ending anguish of the heart if he remained near Barbara, who disdained his love?  He possessed little ambition.  It was only for the sake of the woman he loved that he had recently made more active exertions, but with his excellent acquirements and the fair prospects which were open to him at the court, it seemed, even to his modest mind, too humble a fate to bury himself in a Spanish castle in order to while away with music the lonely hours of a noblewoman, no matter how high her rank, how beautiful and estimable she might be, or how gladly he would render her admirable husband a favour.  Quijada had said this to himself, and perceived plainly enough what was passing in the young knight's thoughts.  So he frankly confessed that he was well aware how few temptations his invitation offered a man endowed with Wolf's rare advantages, but he came by no means with empty hands--and he now informed the listening musician what he could offer him.  This certainly gave his proposal a different aspect.  The aristocratic Quijada family--and as its head he himself--had in its gift a rich living, which annually yielded thousands of ducats, in the great capital of Valladolid.  Many a son of a distinguished race sought it, but he wished to bestow it upon Wolf.  It would insure him more than a comfortable support, permit him to marry the woman of his choice, and, if he remained several years in Villagarcia, afford him the possibility of accumulating a neat little property, as he would live in Quijada's castle as a welcome guest and scarcely ever be obliged to open his purse strings.  Besides, music was cultivated in Valladolid, and if Don Luis introduced him to the clergy there, it might easily happen that they would avail themselves of his great knowledge and fine ability and intrust to him the amendment and perhaps, finally, the direction of the church music.  As Dona Magdalena often spent several months with her brother, the Marquis Rodrigo de la Mota, Wolf could from time to time be permitted to visit the Netherlands or Italy to participate in the more active musical life of these countries.  Wolf listened to this explanation with increasing attention.  The narrow path which buried itself in the sand was becoming a thoroughfare leading upward.  He was glad that he had withheld his refusal; but this matter was so important that the prudent young man, after warmly thanking Don Luis for his good opinion, requested some time for consideration.  True, Quijada could assure him that, for the sake of his wife, Dona Magdalena de Ulloa, whom from childhood she had honoured with her special favour, the regent would place no obstacle in the way of his retirement from her service.  But Wolf begged him to have patience with him.  He was not a man to make swift decisions, and nowhere could he reflect better than in the saddle during a long ride.  He would inform him of his determination by the first messenger despatched from Brussels to the Emperor.  Even now he could assure him that this generous offer seemed very tempting, since solitude always had far more charm for him than the noisy bustle of the court.  Quijada willingly granted the requested delay, and, before bidding him farewell, Wolf availed himself of the opportunity to deliver into his hands the papers collected by his adopted father, which he had on his person.  They contained the proof that he was descended from the legal marriage of a knight and a baroness; and Don Luis willingly undertook to have them confirmed by the Emperor, and his patent renewed in a way which, if he accepted his proposal, might also be useful to him in Spain.  So Wolf took leave of the major-domo with the conviction that he possessed a true friend in this distinguished man.  If the regent did not arbitrarily detain him, he would show himself in Villagarcia to be worthy of his confidence.  On the stairs he met the Emperor's confessor, Don Pedro de Soto. Wolf bowed reverently before the dignified figure of the distinguished Dominican, and the latter, as he recognised him, paused to request curtly that he would give him a few minutes the following day.  \"If I can be of any service to your Reverence,\" replied Wolf, taking the prelate's delicate hand to kiss it; but the almoner, with visible coldness, withdrew it, repellently interrupting him: \"First, Sir Knight, I must ask you for an explanation.  Where the plague is raging in every street, we ought to guard our own houses carefully against it.\"  \"Undoubtedly,\" replied Wolf, unsuspiciously.  \"But I shall set out early to-morrow morning with her Majesty.\"  \"Then,\" replied the Dominican after a brief hesitation, \"then a word with you now.\"  He continued his way to the second story, and Wolf, with an anxious mind, followed him into a waiting room, now empty, near the staircase.  The deep seriousness in the keen eyes of the learned confessor, which could look gentle, indulgent, and sometimes even merry, revealed that he desired to discuss some matter of importance; but the very first question which the priest addressed to him restored the young man's composure.  The confessor merely desired to know what took him to the house of the man who must be known to him as the soul of the evangelical innovations in his native city, and the friend of Martin Luther.  Wolf now quietly informed him what offer Dr. Hiltner, as syndic of Ratisbon, had made him in the name of the Council.  \"And you?\" asked the confessor anxiously.  \"I declined it most positively,\" replied Wolf, \"although it would have suited my taste to stand at the head of the musical life in my native city.\"  \"Because you prefer to remain in the service of her Majesty Queen Mary?\" asked De Soto.  \"No, your Eminence.  Probably I shall soon leave the position near her person.  I rather feared that, as a good Catholic, I would find it difficult to do my duty in the service of an evangelical employer.\"  \"There is something in that.  But what led the singer--you know whom I mean--to the same house?\"  Wolf could not restrain a slight smile, and he answered eagerly: \"The young lady and I grew up together under the same roof, your Eminence, and she came for no other purpose than to bid me farewell.  A lamb that clings more firmly to the shepherd, and more strongly abhors heresy, could scarcely be found in our Redeemer's flock.\"  \"A  lamb!\" exclaimed the  almoner with  a slight touch of scorn.  \"What are we to think of the foe of heresy who exchanges tender kisses with the wife of the most energetic leader of Protestantism?\"  \"By your permission, your Eminence,\" Wolf asserted, \"only the daughter offered her her lips.  She and her mother made the singer's acquaintance at the musical exercises established here by the Council.  Music is the only bond between them.\"--\"Yet there is a bond,\" cried De Soto suspiciously.  \"If you see her again before your departure, advise her, in my name, to sever it.  She found a friendly welcome and much kindness in that house, and here at least--tell her so--only one faith exists.  A prosperous journey, Sir Knight.\"  The delay caused by this conversation induced Wolf to quicken his pace. It had grown late, and Erasmus Eckhart had surely been waiting some time for his school friend in the old precentor's house.  This was really the case, but the Wittenberg theologian, whose course of study had ended only a fortnight before, and who, with his long, brown locks and bright blue eyes, still looked like a gay young student, had had no reason to lament the delay.  He was first received by Ursel, who had left her bed and was moving slowly about the room, and how much the old woman had had to tell her young fellow-believer from Wittenberg about Martin Luther, who was now no longer living, and Professor Melanchthon; but Erasmus Eckhart liked to talk with her, for as a schoolmate and intimate friend of Wolf he had paid innumerable visits to the house, and received in winter an apple, in summer a handful of cherries, from her.  The young man was still less disposed to be vexed with Wolf for his delay when Barbara appeared in Ursel's room.  Erasmus had played with her, too, when he was a boy, and they shared a treasure of memories of the fairest portion of life.  When Wolf at last returned and Barbara gave him her hand, Erasmus envied him the affectionate confidence with which it was done.  She was charged with the warmest messages from her father to the knight, and conscientiously delivered them.  The old gentleman's companion had advised starting that evening, because experience taught that, on a long ride, it was better for man and beast to spend the night outside the city.  They were to put up at the excellent tavern in Winzer, an hour's journey from Ratisbon, and continue the ride from that point.  Wolf knew that many couriers did the same thing, in order to avoid delay at the gate, and only asked whom her father had chosen for a companion.  \"A young nobleman who was here as a recruiting officer,\" replied Barbara curtly.  She had not heard until the last moment whom her father had selected, and had only seen Pyramus Kogel again while the captain's groom was buckling his knapsack upon the saddle.  He had ridden to the house, and while she gazed past him, as though an invisible cap concealed him from her eyes, he asked whether she had no wish concerning her father at heart.  \"That some one else was to accompany him,\" came her sharp reply.  Then, before the captain put his foot into the stirrup, she threw her arms around "]]]
