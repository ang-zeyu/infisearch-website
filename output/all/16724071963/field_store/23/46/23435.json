There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book!  Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.  \"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!\" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel, \"he's only a German doll!\"  The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.  Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice. He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.  At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty. The policeman had disappeared.  But the envelope remained.  \"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid it is a summons,\" said Pickles.  \"No,\" replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, \"it is the rates and taxes, L 3 19 11 3/4.\"  \"This is the last straw,\" said Pickles, \"let us close the shop.\"  They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.  Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.  Pickles is at present a gamekeeper.  The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.  Of course there are the trades-men's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.  But a person cannot live on \"seed wigs\" and sponge-cake and butter-buns--not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's!  After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.  But they did not keep \"self-fitting sixes\"; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.  Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.  And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.  And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but \"very snug;\" which is not the way to carry on a retail business.  So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to re-open the shop--\"Henny's Opening Sale! Grand co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come try, come buy!\"  The poster really was most 'ticing.  There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.  Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.  And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.  There is something to please everybody.  THE END     THE STORY OF MISS MOPPET   THIS is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!  THIS is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten.  THIS is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.  SHE thinks it is a very hard cupboard!  THE Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.  MISS MOPPET ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire.  THE Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the bell-pull.  MISS MOPPET looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer.  MISS MOPPET holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a hole in the duster. The Mouse comes VERY close.  AND then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!  AND because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.  SHE ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball.  BUT she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it--there was no Mouse!  HE has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard!  THE END    THE TALE OF MR. JEREMY FISHER  FOR STEPHANIE FROM COUSIN B.   ONCE upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.  THE water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.  But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!  HE was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond--  \"I WILL get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.\"  MR. JEREMY put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.  THE boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.  MR. JEREMY took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. \"I know a good place for minnows,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  MR. JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it.  Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.  THE rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.  \"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  HE punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.  \"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  A GREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.  Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.  ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.  \"I trust that is not a rat,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; \"I think I had better get away from here.\"  MR. JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!  \"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!\" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.  BUT what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!  THE stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.  AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  AND while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!  A GREAT big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash--and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\"--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!  BUT the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.  MR. JEREMY bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.  HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.  \"WHAT a mercy that was not a pike!\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!\"  HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.  SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat,  AND Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.  AND instead of a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!  THE END     THE TALE OF TIMMY TIPTOES  FOR MANY UNKNOWN LITTLE FRIENDS, INCLUDING MONICA   ONCE upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.  TIMMY TIPTOES sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled--\"Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring.\" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--\"The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.\" \"Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring-time,\" replied prudent Timothy.  WHEN Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.  Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.  EVERY day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.  WHEN these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled down--down--down inside.  \"How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!\" said Goody.  \"I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,\" said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.  THEY did collect quantities--because they did not lose them! Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.  The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to dig, and he could not remember. And"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/582"],["title","A Collection of Beatrix Potter Stories (#8)"],["body","he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!  UNFORTUNATELY, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.  The first one sang--\"Who's bin digging-up MY nuts? Who's-been-digging-up MY nuts?\"  And another sang--\"Little bita bread and-NO-cheese! Little bit-a-bread an'-NO-cheese!\"  THE squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang--\"Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts? Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?\"  Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.  BUT when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!  Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting--\"Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?\"  THEY caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs. \"We will leave him here till he confesses,\" said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole--  \"Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts?\"  TIMMY TIPTOES made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and still.  GOODY TIPTOES picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.  Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.  She wandered all over the wood, calling--  \"Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?\"  IN the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?  It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the house was full of provisions.  THE Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--\"Besides, I found a few buried!\" It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities--\"But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself? My wife will be anxious!\" \"Just another nut--or two nuts; let me crack them for you,\" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!  NOW Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.  \"IT is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?\"  \"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not not know that anybody lived here,\" said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; \"but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too.\" \"I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me,\" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.  SHE led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.  Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together--      \"My little old man and I fell out,     How shall we bring this matter about?     Bring it about as well as you can,     And get you gone, you little old man!\"  \"You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,\" said Goody Tiptoes. \"Yes, I could,\" said the Chipmunk, \"but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!\"  Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--      \"For the diddlum day     Day diddle dum di!     Day diddle diddle dum day!\"  THEN Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--\"Timmy Tiptoes! Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!\" And Timmy replied, \"Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? Why, certainly!\"  He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.  Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.  AND so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.  Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.  BUT Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable.  AT last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.  CHIPPY HACKEE went home in a hurry!  AND when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still.  And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a little padlock.  AND whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings--\"Who's-been-digging-up MY-nuts? Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?\" But nobody ever answers!  THE END    THE PIE AND THE PATTY-PAN      Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?     In walks the little dog--says \"Pussy are you there?     How do you do mistress Pussy? Mistress Pussy, how do you do?\"     \"I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!\"                                        Old Rhyme.   ONCE upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.  \"Come in good time, my dear Duchess,\" said Ribby's letter, \"and we will have something so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And YOU shall eat it all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!\" wrote Ribby.  Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer:--\"I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. _I_ was just going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat something MOST DELICIOUS.\"  \"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,\" wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added--\"I hope it isn't mouse?\"  And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out \"isn't mouse\" and changed it to \"I hope it will be fine,\" and she gave her letter to the postman.  But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.  \"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!\" said Duchess to herself--\"I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.\"  Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.  \"It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam--Oh I do wish I could eat my own pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!\"  Duchess considered and considered and read Ribby' s letter again--  \"A pink and white pie-dish-and YOU shall eat it all. 'You' means me--then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins..... Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?\"  Duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness!  Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.  \"The top oven bakes too quickly,\" said Ribby to herself. \"It is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast--rather big mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog infinitely superior company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.\"  Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.  Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front-door and put them straight; the hearth-rug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.  Then she spread a very clean white table-cloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace. The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.  When Ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish, and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.  When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.  Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot"]]]
