Some body, not long since turning over my writing tables, found by chance a memoriall of something I would have done after my death: I told him (as indeed it was true), that being but a mile from my house, and in perfect health and lustie, I had made haste to write it, because I could not assure my self I should ever come home in safety: As one that am ever hatching of mine owne thoughts, and place them in my selfe: I am ever prepared about that which I may be: nor can death (come when she please) put me in mind of any new thing. A man should ever, as much as in him lieth, be ready booted to take his journey, and above all things, looke he have then nothing to doe but with himselfe.       Quid brevi fortes jaculamur aevo      Multa:      [Footnote: Hor. 1. ii. Od. Xiv]       To aime why are we ever bold,      At many things in so short hold?  For then we shall have worke sufficient, without any more accrease. Some man complaineth more that death doth hinder him from the assured course of an hoped for victorie, than of death it selfe; another cries out, he should give place to her, before he have married his daughter, or directed the course of his childrens bringing up; another bewaileth he must forgoe his wives company; another moaneth the losse of his children, the chiefest commodities of his being. I am now by meanes of the mercy of God in such a taking, that without regret or grieving at any worldly matter, I am prepared to dislodge, whensoever he shall please to call me: I am every where free: my farewell is soone taken of all my friends, except of my selfe. No man did ever pre pare himselfe to quit the world more simply and fully, or more generally spake of all thoughts of it, than I am assured I shall doe. The deadest deaths are the best.     --Miser, de miser (aiunt) omnia ademit.      Vna dies infesta mihi tot praemia vitae:      [Footnote: Luce. 1. iii. 941.]       O wretch, O wretch (friends cry), one day,      All joyes of life hath tane away:  And the builder,     --manent (saith he) opera interrupta,      minaeque Murorum ingentes.      [Footnote: Virg. Aen. 1. iv. 88.]       The workes unfinisht lie,      And walls that threatned hie.  A man should designe nothing so long afore-hand, or at least with such an intent, as to passionate[Footnote: Long passionately.] himselfe to see the end of it; we are all borne to be doing.       Cum moriar, medium solvar et inter opus      [Footnote: Ovid. Am. 1. ii. El. x. 36]       When dying I my selfe shall spend,      Ere halfe my businesse come to end.  I would have a man to be doing, and to prolong his lives offices as much as lieth in him, and let death seize upon me whilest I am setting my cabiges, carelesse of her dart, but more of my unperfect garden. I saw one die, who being at his last gaspe, uncessantly complained against his destinie, and that death should so unkindly cut him off in the middest of an historie which he had in hand, and was now come to the fifteenth or sixteenth of our Kings.       Illud in his rebus non addunt, nec tibi earum,      Iam desiderium rerum super insidet uno.      [Footnote: Luce. 1. iii. 44.]       Friends adde not that in this case, now no more      Shalt thou desire, or want things wisht before.  A man should rid himselfe of these vulgar and hurtful humours. Even as Churchyards were first place adjoyning unto churches, and in the most frequented places of the City, to enure (as Lycurgus said) the common people, women and children, not to be skared at the sight of a dead man, and to the end that continuall spectacle of bones, sculs, tombes, graves and burials, should forewarne us of our condition, and fatall end.       Quin etiam exhilarare viris convivia caede      Mos olim, et miscere epulis spectacula dira      Certantum ferro, saepe et super ipsa cadentum      Pocula, respersis non parco sanguine mensis.      [Footnote: Syl. 1. xi. 51]       Nay more, the manner was to welcome guests,      And with dire shewes of slaughter to mix feasts.      Of them that fought at sharpe, and with bords tainted      Of them with much bloud, who o'er full cups fainted.  And even as the AEgyptians after their feastings and carousings caused a great image of death to be brought in and shewed to the guests and bytanders, by one that cried aloud, \"Drinke and be merry, for such shalt thou be when thou art dead: \"So have I learned this custome or lesson, to have alwaies death, not only in my imagination, but continually in my mouth. And there is nothing I desire more to be informed of than of the death of men; that is to say, what words, what countenance, and what face they shew at their death; and in reading of histories, which I so attentively observe. It appeareth by the shuffling and hudling up[Footnote: Collecting] of my examples, I affect[Footnote: Like] no subject so particularly as this. Were I a composer of books, I would keepe a register, commented of the divers deaths, which in teaching men to die, should after teach them to live. Dicearcus made one of that title, but of another and lesse profitable end. Some man will say to mee, the effect exceeds the thought so farre, that there is no fence so sure, or cunning so certaine, but a man shall either lose or forget if he come once to that point; let them say what they list: to premeditate on it, giveth no doubt a great advantage: and it is nothing, at the least, to goe so farre without dismay or alteration, or without an ague? There belongs more to it: Nature her selfe lends her hand, and gives us courage. If it be a short and violent death, wee have no leisure to feare it; if otherwise, I perceive that according as I engage my selfe in sicknesse, I doe naturally fall into some disdaine and contempt of life. I finde that I have more adoe to digest this resolution, that I shall die when I am in health, than I have when I am troubled with a fever: forsomuch as I have no more such fast hold on the commodities of life, whereof I begin to lose the use and pleasure, and view death in the face with a lesse undanted looke, which makes me hope, that the further I goe from that, and the nearer I approach to this, so much more easily doe I enter in composition for their exchange. Even as I have tried in many other occurrences, which Caesar affirmed, that often some things seeme greater, being farre from us, than if they bee neere at hand: I have found that being in perfect health, I have much more beene frighted with sicknesse, than when I have felt it. The jollitie wherein I live, the pleasure and the strength make the other seeme so disproportionable from that, that by imagination I amplifie these commodities by one moitie, and apprehended them much more heavie and burthensome, than I feele them when I have them upon my shoulders. The same I hope will happen to me of death. Consider we by the ordinary mutations, and daily declinations which we suffer, how Nature deprives us of the sight of our losse and empairing; what hath an aged man left him of his youths vigor, and of his forepast life?       Heu senibus vita portio quanta manet      [Footnote: Com. Gal. 1. i. 16.]       Alas to men in yeares how small      A part of life is left in all?  Caesar, to a tired and crazed [Footnote: diseased] Souldier of his guard, who in the open street came to him, to beg leave he might cause himselfe to be put to death; viewing his decrepit behaviour, answered pleasantly: \"Doest thou thinke to be alive then?\" Were man all at once to fall into it, I doe not thinke we should be able to beare such a change, but being faire and gently led on by her hand, in a slow, and as it were unperceived descent, by little and little, and step by step, she roules us into that miserable state, and day by day seekes to acquaint us with it. So that when youth failes in us, we feele, nay we perceive no shaking or transchange at all in our selves: which in essence and veritie is a harder death, than that of a languishing and irkesome life, or that of age. Forsomuch as the leape from an ill being unto a not being, is not so dangerous or steepie; as it is from a delightfull and flourishing being unto a painfull and sorrowfull condition. A weake bending, and faint stopping bodie hath lesse strength to beare and under goe a heavie burden: So hath our soule. She must bee rouzed and raised against the violence and force of this adversarie. For as it is impossible she should take any rest whilest she feareth: whereof if she be assured (which is a thing exceeding humane [Footnote: human] condition) she may boast that it is impossible unquietnesse, torment, and feare, much lesse the least displeasure should lodge in her.       Non vultus instantis tyranni      Mente quatit solida, neque Auster,      Dux inquieti turbidus Adria,      Nec fulminantis magna Jovis manus.      [Footnote: Hor. I. iii. Od. iii.]       No urging tyrants threatning face,      Where minde is found can it displace,      No troublous wind the rough seas Master,      Nor Joves great hand, the thunder-caster.  She is made Mistris of her passions and concupiscence, Lady of indulgence, of shame, of povertie, and of all for tunes injuries. Let him that can, attaine to this advantage: Herein consists the true and soveraigne liberty, that affords us meanes wherewith to jeast and make a scorne of force and injustice, and to deride imprisonment, gives [Footnote: Gyves, shackles] or fetters.         --in manicis, et      Compedibus, savo te sub custode tenebo.      Ipse Deus simui atque volam, me solvet: opinor      Hoc sentit, moriar. Mors ultima linea rerum est.      [Footnote: Hor. I. i. Ep. xvi. 76.]       In gyves and fetters I will hamper thee,      Under a Jayler that shall cruell be:      Yet, when I will, God me deliver shall,      He thinkes, I shall die: death is end of all.  Our religion hath had no surer humane foundation than the contempt of life. Discourse of reason doth not only"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5637"],["title","Literary and Philosophical Essays: French, German and Italian (#4)"],["body"," and summon us unto it. For why should we feare to lose a thing, which being lost, cannot be moaned? but also, since we are threatened by so many kinds of death, there is no more inconvenience to feare them all, than to endure one: what matter is it when it commeth, since it is unavoidable? Socrates answered one that told him, \"The thirty tyrants have condemned thee to death.\" \"And Nature them,\" said he. What fondnesse is it to carke and care so much, at that instant and passage from all exemption of paine and care? As our birth brought us the birth of all things, so shall our death the end of all things. Therefore is it as great follie to weepe, we shall not live a hundred yeeres hence, as to waile we lived not a hundred yeeres agoe. \"Death is the beginning of another life.\" So wept we, and so much did it cost us to enter into this life; and so did we spoile us of our ancient vaile in entring into it. Nothing can be grievous that is but once. Is it reason so long to fear a thing of so short time? Long life or short life is made all one by death. For long or short is not in things that are no more. Aristotle saith, there are certaine little beasts alongst the river Hyspanis, that live but one day; she which dies at 8 o'clocke in the morning, dies in her youth, and she that dies at 5 in the afternoon, dies in her decrepitude, who of us doth not laugh, when we shall see this short moment of continuance to be had in consideration of good or ill fortune? The most and the least is ours, if we compare it with eternitie, or equall it to the lasting of mountains, rivers, stars, and trees, or any other living creature, is not lesse ridiculous. But nature compels us to it. Depart (saith she) out of this world, even as you came into it. The same way you came from death to life, returne without passion or amazement, from life to death: your death is but a peece of the worlds order, and but a parcell of the worlds life.     --inter se mortales mutua vivunt,      Et quasi cursores vitae lampada tradunt.      [Footnote: Lucret. ii. 74. 77.]       Mortall men live by mutuall entercourse:      And yeeld their life-torch, as men in a course.  Shal I not change this goodly contexture of things for you? It is the condition of your creation: death is a part of yourselves: you flie from yourselves. The being you enjoy is equally shared betweene life and death. The first day of your birth doth as wel addresse you to die, as to live.       Prima quae vitam dedit, hora, carpsit.      [Footnote: Sen. Her. Sw. ckor. Iii.]       The first houre, that to men      Gave life, strait, cropt it then.       Nascentes morimur, finisque ab origine pendet:      [Footnote: Manil. At. l. iv]       As we are borne we die; the end      Doth of th' originall depend.  All the time you live, you steale it from death: it is at her charge. The continuall worke of your life, is to contrive death: you are in death, during the time you continue in life: for, you are after death, when you are no longer living. Or if you had rather have it so, you are dead after life: but during life, you are still dying: and death doth more rudely touch the dying than the dead, and more lively and essentially. If you have profited by life, you have also beene fed thereby, depart then satisfied.       Cur non ut plenus vitae conviva recedis?      [Footnote: Lucret. 1. iii. 982.]       Why like a full-fed guest,      Depart you not to rest?  If you have not knowne how to make use of it: if it were unprofitable to you, what need you care to have lost it to what end would you enjoy it longer?     --cur amplius addere quaeris      Rursum quod pereat male,      et ingratum occidat omne?      [Footnote: Lucret. 1. iii. 989.]       Why seeke you more to gaine, what must againe      All perish ill, and passe with griefe or paine?  Life in itselfe is neither good nor evill: it is the place of good or evill, according as you prepare it for them. And if you have lived one day, you have seene all: one day is equal to all other daies. There is no other light, there is no other night. This Sunne, this Moone, these Starres, and this disposition, is the very same which your forefathers enjoyed, and which shall also entertaine your posteritie.       Non alium videre patres, aliumve nepotes      Aspicient.      [Footnote: Manil. i. 523.]       No other saw our Sires of old,      No other shall their sonnes behold.  And if the worst happen, the distribution and varietie of all the acts of my comedie, is performed in one yeare. If you have observed the course of my foure seasons; they containe the infancie, the youth, the viriltie, and the old age of the world. He hath plaied his part: he knowes no other wilinesse belonging to it, but to begin againe, it will ever be the same, and no other.       Versamur ibidem, atque insumus usque,      [Footnote: Lucret. 1. iii. 123.]       We still in one place turne about,      Still there we are, now in, now out.       Atque in se sua per vestigia volvitur annus.      [Footnote: Virg. Georg. 1. ii. 403.]       The yeare into it selfe is cast      By those same steps, that it hath past.  I am not purposed to devise you other new sports.       Nam tibi praterea quod machiner, inveniamque      Quod placeat nihil est; eadem suni omnia semper.      [Footnote: Lucret. 1. ii. 978.]       Else nothing, that I can devise or frame,      Can please thee, for all things are still the same.  Make roome for others, as others have done for you. Equalitie is the chiefe ground-worke of equitie, who can complaine to be comprehended where all are contained? So may you live long enough, you shall never diminish anything from the time you have to die: it is bootlesse; so long shall you continue in that state which you feare, as if you had died, being in your swathing-clothes, and when you were sucking.     --licet, quot vis, vivendo vincere secla.      Mors sterna tamen, nihilominus ilia manebit.      [Footnote: Ib. 1126.]       Though yeares you live, as many as you will,      Death is eternall, death remaineth still.  And I will so please you, that you shall have no discontent.       In vera nescis nullum fore morte alium te,      Qui possit vivus tibi te lugere peremptum,      Stansque jacentem.      [Footnote: Idt. 1. Iii. 9.]       Thou know'st not there shall be not other thou,      When thou art dead indeed, that can tell how      Alive to waile thee dying, Standing to waile thee lying.  Nor shall you wish for life, which you so much desire       Nec sibi enim quisquam tum se vitamque requirit,      [Footnote: ib. 963.]      Nec desiderium nostri nos afficit ullum.      [Footnote: Ib. 966.]       For then none for himselfe or life requires:      Nor are we of our selves affected with desires.  Death is lesse to be feared than nothing, if there were anything lesse than nothing.       --multo mortem minus ad nos esse putandum,      Si minus esse potest quam quod nihil esse videmus.      [Footnote: Ib. 970.]       Death is much less to us, we ought esteeme,      If lesse may be, than what doth nothing seeme.  Nor alive, nor dead, it doth concern you nothing. Alive because you are: Dead, because you are no more. Moreover, no man dies before his houre. The time you leave behinde was no more yours than that which was before your birth, and concerneth you no more.       Respice enim quam nil ad nos anteacta vetustas      Temporis aeterni fuerit.      [Footnote: Ib. 1016.]       For marke, how all antiquitie foregone      Of all time ere we were, to us was none.  Wheresoever your life ended, there is it all. The profit of life consists not in the space, but rather in the use. Some man hath lived long, that hath a short life, Follow it whilst you have time. It consists not in number of yeeres, but in your will, that you have lived long enough. Did you thinke you should never come to the place, where you were still going? There is no way but hath an end. And if company may solace you, doth not the whole world walke the same path?     --Omnia te, vita perfuncta, sequentur.      [Footnote: Ib. 1012.]       Life past, all things at last      Shall follow thee as thou hast past.  Doe not all things move as you doe, or keepe your course? Is there any thing grows not old together with yourselfe? A thousand men, a thousand beasts, and a thousand other creatures die in the very instant that you die.       Nam nox nulla diem, neque noctem aurora sequuta est,      Que non audierit mistus vagitibus aegris      Ploratus, mortis comites et funeris atri.      [Footnote: Id. i. ii. 587.]       No night ensued day light; no morning followed night,      Which heard not moaning mixt with sick-mens groaning,      With deaths and funerals joyned was that moaning.  To what end recoile you from it, if you cannot goe backe. You have seene many who have found good in death, ending thereby many many miseries. But have you seene any that hath received hurt thereby? Therefore it is meere simplicitie to condemne a thing you never approve, neither by yourselfe nor any other. Why doest thou complaine of me and of destinie? Doe we offer thee any wrong? is it for thee to direct us, or for us to governe thee? Although thy age be not come to her period, thy life is. A little man is a whole man as well as a great man. Neither men nor their lives are measured by the Ell. Chiron refused immortalitie, being informed of the conditions thereof, even by the God of time and of continuance, Saturne his father. Imagine truly how much an ever-during life would be lesse tolerable and more painfull to a man, than is the life which I have given him. Had you not death you would then uncessantly curse, and cry out against me, that I had deprived you of it. I have of purpose and unwittingly blended some bitternesse amongst it, that so seeing the commoditie of its use, I might hinder you from over- greedily embracing, or indiscreetly calling for it. To continue in this moderation that is, neither to fly from life nor to run to"]]]
