The kind we get over here are no good. But I've seen the ones that come from Paris, and they're just as different as day and night. I'd like the Venus of Milo and the Mona Lisa and the Victory and--oh, well--I'll make you out a list. There are several Madonnas that I want, and several more that I DON'T want. And I do NOT want any of Nattier's pictures or a \"Baby Stuart,\" but I do want some of Hinde's hair curlers--the tortoise-shell kind, I mean--and you can only get them in Paris.\"  By this time Patty was shaking with laughter at Marian's list, and she asked her if she didn't want anything else but photographs and hair curlers.  \"Why, yes,\" said Marian, astonished; \"I've only just begun. You know photographs don't cost much over there, and of course the curlers won't count for a present. I thought you meant to bring me something nice.\"  \"I do,\" said Patty, looking at her cousin, who was so comically in earnest. \"You just go on with your list, and I'll bring all the things, if I have to buy an extra trunk to bring them in.\"  \"All right, then,\" said Marian, encouraged to proceed. \"I want a bead bag--one of those gay coloured ones made of very small beads, worked in old-fashioned flowers, roses, you know, or hibiscus--not on any account the tulip pattern, because I hate it.\"  \"You'd better write out these instructions, Marian, or I shall be sure to get tulips by mistake.\"  \"Don't you do it, Patty; I'll write them all down most explicitly. And then I want a scarf, a very long one, cream-coloured ground, with a Persian border in blues and greys. But not a palm-leaf border--I mean that queer stencilled sort of a design; I'll draw a pattern of it so you can't mistake it.\"  \"But suppose I can't find just that kind, Marian.\"  \"Oh, yes, you can! Ethel Holmes has one, and hers came from Paris. And you've all winter to look for it, you know.\"  \"Well, I'll devote the winter to the search, but if I don't find it along toward spring I'll give it up. What else, Marian?\"  \"Well, I'd like a lot of Napoleon things. Some old prints of him, you know, and perhaps a little bronze statuette, and a cup and saucer or pen-wiper, or any of those things that they make with pictures of Napoleon on. And then--oh! Patty, I do want some Cyclamen perfumery. It's awfully hard to get. There's only one firm that makes it. I forget the name, but it's Something Bros. & Co., and their place is across the Seine.\"  \"Across the Seine from what?\"  \"Why, just across. On the other side, you know. Of course I don't know across from what, because I've never been to Paris; but everybody who has lived there always just says 'across the Seine,' and everybody knows at once where they mean. You'll know all right after you've lived there a little while.\"  \"Marian, you're a wonder,\" declared Patty. \"I don't think I ever knew anybody with such a perfect and complete understanding of her own wants as you seem to have. I hope you haven't mentioned half the things I'm to bring you, but don't tell me the rest now. I might change my mind about going. But you buy a large blank book and write out all these orders at full length, giving directions just when to cross the Seine and when to cross back again, and I'll promise to do my very best with the whole list.\"  \"Patty, you're a darling,\" said Marian, \"and I'm almost reconciled to having you go when I think of having souvenirs brought to me that I really want.\"  \"Marian,\" said Patty, struck with a sudden thought, \"your idea of the difference between desirable and undesirable souvenirs is an interesting one. Now I shall bring little gifts to all my friends and relatives, I expect, and if you happen to know of anything that would be especially liked by Uncle Charlie or Aunt Alice or any of your family, or the Tea Club girls, I wish you'd make another list and put those things all down for me. It would be the greatest kind of a help.\"  Marian promised to do this, and Patty felt sure that she would be glad of the lists later on.  Aunt Isabel and Ethelyn also came to say good-bye to Patty, but their demeanour was very different from Marian's.  Aunt Isabel was much impressed by the fact that Patty was going to travel with the rich Farringtons, but she expressed a doubt as to whether it would do Patty much good in a social way after all. For she knew something of Mrs. Farrington's habits and tastes, and they in no way corresponded to her own.  Ethelyn informed Patty that she need not bring her any souvenir unless she could bring something really nice. \"I do hate the little traps and trinkets most people bring,\" she said; \"but if you want to bring me a bracelet or locket or something really worth while, I'd be glad to have it.\"  \"Well,\" exclaimed Patty, \"I certainly have most outspoken cousins! They don't seem to hesitate to tell me what to bring and what not to bring them. But I'm sure of one thing! Bumble Barlow won't be so fussy particular; she'll take whatever I bring and be thankful.\"  \"So will I,\" said Nan, laughing; \"anything no one else wants, Patty, you may give it to me.\"  \"Don't spend all your money buying presents, child,\" said Aunt Isabel; \"you'd better buy pretty clothes for yourself. I will give you a list of the best places to shop.\"  \"Thank you, Aunt Isabel, I'll take the list with pleasure; but of course my purchases will be at the advice of Mrs. Farrington. She dresses Elise quite simply, and will probably expect me to do the same.\"  Aunt Isabel sniffed. \"You ought to have gone to Paris with me,\" she said. \"You're growing up to be a good-looking girl, Patty, and the right kind of clothes would set you off wonderfully.\"  Patty said nothing, but as she glanced at Ethelyn's furbelows she felt thankful she was not going to Paris with Aunt Isabel.  But Patty found that there was quite a great deal of shopping to be done before she sailed.  Nan took these matters in charge and declared that Patty needed a complete though not an elaborate steamer outfit.  Nan dearly loved buying pretty clothes and was quite in her element making Patty's purchases. A dark blue tailor-made cloth, trimmed with touches of green velvet, was chosen for her travelling costume.  Her \"going-away dress\" Marian persisted in calling it, just as if Patty were a bride; but as Marian burst into tears every time she mentioned Patty's going away, her words were so indistinct that it mattered little what terms she used.  Then Nan selected one or two pretty light gowns of a somewhat dressy nature for dinner on board the steamer, and one or two simple evening gowns for the ship's concert or other festive occasions. A white serge suit was added for pleasant afternoons on deck, and some dainty kimonos and negligees for stateroom use.  Patty was delighted with all these things, but could scarcely take time to appreciate them, as she found so many other things to do by way of her own preparations. So many people came to see her and she had to go to see so many other people. Then she had to have her photographs taken to leave with her friends, and she was constantly being invited to little farewell luncheons or teas.  \"Indeed,\" as Patty expressed it, \"the whole two weeks of preparation seems like one long, lingering farewell; and when I'm not saying good-bye to any one else, I'm trying to stop Marian's freshly flowing tears.\"  The girls bought Patty parting gifts, and though they were all either useful or pretty, Patty appreciated far more the loving spirit which prompted them.  \"I made this all myself,\" said Hilda, as she brought Patty a dainty sleeping gown of blue and white French flannel, \"because it's utterly impossible to buy this sort of thing ready-made and have it just right. If you don't say this is just right I'll never make you another as long as I live.\"  \"It's exactly right, Hilda,\" said Patty, taking the pretty garment. \"I know I shall dream of you whenever I wear it, and that's too bad, too, for I ought to devote some of my dreams to other people.\"  \"This is a cabin bag,\" said Lorraine, bringing her offering. \"I didn't make it myself, because this is so much neater and prettier than a homemade one. You see it has a pocket for everything that you can possibly require, from hairpins to shoehorn. Not that you'll put anything in the pockets--nobody ever does--but it will look pretty decorating your cabin wall.\"  \"Indeed I shall put things in it,\" said Patty. \"I'm a great believer in putting things in their right places, and I shall think of you, Lorraine, whenever I'm trying to get the things out of these dinky little pockets, and probably not succeeding very well.\"  \"This is my gift,\" said Adelaide Hart; \"it isn't very elaborate, but I made it all myself, and that means a good deal from me.\"  Patty opened the parcel and found a piece of cretonne about a yard square, neatly hemmed along each of the four sides, and having a tape loop sewed on each corner.  \"It's perfectly beautiful,\" said Patty, \"and I never saw more exquisite needlework; but would you mind telling me what it is for? It can't be a handkerchief, but I don't know of anything else that's exactly square.\"  \"How ignorant you are,\" said Adelaide with pretended superiority. \"That, my inexperienced friend, is a wrap for your best hat.\"  \"Oh,\" said Patty, not much enlightened.  \"You see,\" Adelaide kindly went on to explain, \"as soon as you get on board your steamer you take off your best hat and put it exactly in the middle of this square, having first spread the square out smoothly on the bed or somewhere. Then you take up these four corners by the loops and hang the whole thing on the highest hook in your stateroom. Thus, you see, your best hat is carried safely across; it is not jammed or crushed, and it is protected from dust.\"  \"I see,\" said Patty gravely; \"and I suppose the dust is something awful on an ocean "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5731"],["title","Patty in Paris (#4)"],["body","steamer.\"  The laugh seemed to be on Adelaide at this, but she joined in it and prophesied that when Patty returned she would confess that that gift had proved the most useful of all.  Clementine Morse brought a large post-card album which she had filled with views of New York City.  \"I know you will be homesick before you're out of sight of land,\" she said; \"but if you're not you ought to be, and I hope these pictures will make you so. When you look at this highly colored representation of Grant's tomb and realise that it is but a few miles from your own long-lost hearthstone, I'm sure you will feel qualms of patriotism--or something.\"  \"I think very likely,\" said Patty, laughing. \"But, Clementine, how many trunks do you suppose I shall need to hold my farewell gifts? This album will take up considerable space.\"  \"I know it,\" said Clementine, \"but you needn't put it in your trunk. You can carry it on board in your hand, and then when you go ashore you can carry it in your hand. I don't believe they will charge you duty on it, especially as it will probably be nearly worn out by that time.\"  \"I'm sure it will,\" said Patty, \"not only from my own constant use of it, but I know everybody on board will want to borrow it and enjoy these works of art.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Clementine; \"and then, Patty, when you're in Paris you can throw away all these New York cards and fill it up with Paris views and bring it home and give it back to me.\"  \"I certainly will, Clem; that's a first-rate idea.\"  Mary Sargent brought a French phrase book. It was entitled \"French Before Breakfast,\" and as Mary explained that the French people never had breakfast until noon, Patty would have ample time to study it.  Patty accepted the little book with many thanks and promised Mary she would never eat breakfast, at noon or any other hour, until she had thoroughly mastered at least one of the phrases.     CHAPTER IV  AN AQUATIC PARTY   Of course all were agreed that Patty must have a farewell party of some sort; and as Nan dearly loved elaborate affairs, she had decided that it should be an Aquatic Party.  Patty frankly confessed her ignorance as to what an Aquatic Party might be, whereupon Nan informed her that she had only to wait until the occasion itself to find out.  So busy was Patty herself that she took no hand in the preparations for the party, and indeed Nan required no help. That capable and energetic young matron secured the services of some professional decorators and able-bodied workmen, but the direction and superintendence was entirely in her own hands.  Patty was consulted only in regard to her own costume for the occasion.  \"You see,\" said Nan, coming into Patty's room one morning, \"I don't know whether you would rather say good-bye to your friends in the guise of a kelpie or a pixy or a jelly-fish.\"  \"Cut out the jelly-fish,\" said Patty, laughing, \"for they're horrid, floppy old things, I'm sure. As to the others, what's the difference between a kelpie and a pixy?\"  \"Oh, a great deal of difference,\" declared Nan, wagging her head wisely; \"a kelpie is an imaginary water sprite, you know, and a pixy is a--a--why, a sort of make-believe fairy who lives in the water.\"  \"Well, I'm glad that you see a difference in your two definitions. For my part I don't see anything to hinder my being a kelpie and a pixy both, even if I'm not twins.\"  \"Well, they're not so very different, you know. One is a kelpie, and one is a pixy; that's about all the difference.\"  Patty laughed. \"Well, if it will help you out any to have me make a choice,\" she said, \"I'll choose to be a kelpie. What's the latest thing in kelpie costumes?\"  \"Oh, it will be lovely, Patty! I'll have it made of pale green silk, with a frosted, silvery, shimmering effect, you know, and draped with trailing green seaweed and water grasses.\"  \"Lovely!\" agreed Patty. \"And what would the pixy costume have been, if I had chosen that?\"  \"Just the same,\" confessed Nan, laughing; \"but it's easier to have something definite to work at. You can wear my corals, Patty, and, with your hair down, you'll be a perfect kelpie.\"  Patty smiled at her young stepmother's enthusiasm, and Nan ran away to begin preparations for the kelpie costume.  The night of the party the whole Fairfield house was so transformed that it must scarcely have recognised itself.  The large front drawing-room represented the arctic regions in the vicinity of the North Pole. Frames had been erected which, when covered with sheets, simulated peaks of snowy mountains and snow-covered icebergs. Here and there signs, apparently left by explorers, told the latitude and longitude, and a flag marked the explorations Farthest North. Over these snow peaks scrambled white polar bears in most realistic fashion, and in one corner an Esquimau hut was built.  The ceiling represented a clear blue sky, and the floor the blue water of the open polar sea.  By a clever arrangement of electric lights through colored shades a fair representation of the Aurora Borealis was made to appear at intervals.  The library, which was back of the drawing-room, had been transformed into an aquarium. All round the walls, waves of blue-green gauze simulated water, in which papier-mache fish were gliding and swimming. The illusion was heightened by other fishes, which, being suspended from the ceiling by invisible threads, seemed to be swimming through the air.  Altogether the effect, if not entirely realistic, was picturesque and amusing, and coral reefs and rocky cliffs covered with seaweed gave aquatic impressions, even if not entirely logical.  But Nan's pride was what she chose to call the Upper Deck. This was a room on the second floor, a large front room, which had been made to represent the upper deck of a handsome yacht. Sail-cloth draped and held up by poles formed the roof and sides, and a realistic railing surrounded it. A dozen or more steamer chairs stood in line, strewn with rugs, pillows and paper-backed novels. Coils of rope, lanterns, life-preservers, and other paraphernalia added to the realism of the scene, and at one side a carefully constructed window opened into the steward's cabin. The steward himself, white-duck-suited and white-capped, was prepared to serve light refreshments exactly after the fashion of a correct yachting party.  When the guests began to arrive and were dressed in various costumes, each representing some type or phase of water pleasures, the scene took on a gay and festive air.  Patty's kelpie costume was a great success, and the girl never looked prettier than as she stood receiving her guests in the pretty green silk gown, trailing with seaweed and shimmering with silver dust. Her curly golden hair was wreathed with soft green water-grasses, and her rosy cheeks and dancing eyes made her look like a mischievous water sprite.  Nan's own costume was that of a fish-wife, and though very different from Patty's, it had all the picturesqueness of the quaint costume of the Breton fisher-folk. A basket slung over her shoulder held realistic-looking fishes, and Nan looked quite as if she might have stepped out of the frame of a picture in the French Academy.  Mr. Fairfield, not without some difficulty, had been induced to represent Neptune. False flowing white hair and beard, a shining crown and trident, and a voluminous sea-green robe made him a gorgeous sight.  The three stood near the North Pole to receive their guests, and formality was almost lost sight of in the hilarity caused by the procession of picturesque costumes.  There were pirates of fierce and bloodthirsty mien; there were jolly Jack Tars and natty ship officers; there were water babies, mermaids, fishermen, and many dainty yachting costumes. Then there were queer and grotesque figures, such as a frog, a lobster, and a huge crab.  Altogether the motley procession presented a most interesting appearance, and Patty was glad when the guests had all arrived and she could leave her post and mingle with the crowd.  It was not long before a group of Patty's most intimate friends had gathered on the Upper Deck to chat. Patty herself had been snugly tucked into a deck chair by Kenneth, who insisted on showing her just how the proceeding should be accomplished.  \"Nothing shows your ignorance, my child, on board ship,\" he was saying, \"like not knowing how to manage your steamer rug and pillow.\"  \"But,\" said Patty, \"I shall then have on a suitable gown that will stand rough usage; but I beg of you, Ken, stop tucking that rug around my delicate kelpie decorations.  \"Oh,\" said Kenneth, \"you're a kelpie, then! Strange I didn't recognise you at once, but I so rarely meet kelpies in the best society. Now I'm Captain Kidd.\"  \"Are you?\" cried Elise gaily; \"now I had an idea you were Admiral Farragut; but then one so rarely meets Captain Kidd in the best society.\"  \"That's so,\" said Kenneth; \"and think how long it will be, girls, before you have the pleasure of meeting this particular Captain Kidd in any society. I tell you, I envy you. You're going to have the time of your life in Paris, and I wish to goodness I could go along with you.\"  \"Oh, do, Kenneth,\" cried Patty; \"we'd have just the best time ever! Can't you give up college and put in a lot of study over there?\"  \"No, indeed, I can't; I'm only just wishing I could. There's no harm in wishing, you know. But if you'll stay until next summer, perhaps I'll come over and see you during vacation, and then we can all come home together.\"  \"That would be fine,\" said Elise, \"and we're just as likely to stay until summer as not. But then, on the other hand, we're just as likely to come home as soon as we get there. You never can tell what those absurd parents of mine are going to do.\"  Meantime a strange-looking figure was walking across the Upper Deck toward the group that surrounded Patty. It was impossible not to recognise the character, which was meant to be a representation of Noah. But it was the well-known Noah of the"]]]
