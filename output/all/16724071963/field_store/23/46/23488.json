Many of the rebel families expected Buckner to reach Louisville at any moment.  That night, General Anderson sent for me, and I found with him Mr. Guthrie, president of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, who had in his hands a dispatch to the effect that the bridge across the Rolling Fork of Salt Creek, less than thirty miles out, had been burned, and that Buckner's force, en route for Louisville, had been detained beyond Green River by a train thrown from the track.  We learned afterward that a man named Bird had displaced a rail on purpose to throw the train off the track, and thereby give us time.  Mr. Guthrie explained that in the ravine just beyond Salt Creek were several high and important trestles which, if destroyed, would take months to replace, and General Anderson thought it well. worth the effort to save them.  Also, on Muldraugh's Hill beyond, was a strong position, which had in former years been used as the site for the State \"Camp of Instruction,\" and we all supposed that General Buckner, who was familiar with the ground, was aiming for a position there, from which to operate on Louisville.  All the troops we had to counteract Buckner were Rousseau's Legion, and a few Home Guards in Louisville.  The former were still encamped across the river at Jeffersonville; so General Anderson ordered me to go over, and with them, and such Home Guards as we could collect, make the effort to secure possession of Muldraugh's Hill before Buckner could reach it.  I took Captain Prime with me; and crossed over to Rousseau's camp.  The long-roll was beaten, and within an hour the men, to the number of about one thousand, were marching for the ferry-boat and for the Nashville depot.  Meantime General Anderson had sent to collect some Home Guards, and Mr. Guthrie to get the trains ready.  It was after midnight before we began to move.  The trains proceeded slowly, and it was daybreak when we reached Lebanon Junction, twenty-six miles out, where we disembarked, and marched to the bridge over Salt River, which we found had been burnt; whether to prevent Buckner coming into Louisville, or us from going out, was not clear.  Rousseau's Legion forded the stream and marched up to the State Camp of Instruction, finding the high trestles all secure.  The railroad hands went to work at once to rebuild the bridge.  I remained a couple of days at Lebanon Junction, during which General Anderson forwarded two regiments of volunteers that had come to him.  Before the bridge was done we  advanced the whole camp to the summit of Muldraugh's Hill, just back of Elizabethtown.  There I learned definitely that General Buckner had not crossed Green River at all, that General Sidney Johnston was fortifying Bowling Green, and preparing for a systematic advance into Kentucky, of which he was a native, and with whose people and geography he must have been familiar.  As fast as fresh troops reached Louisville, they were sent out to me at Muldraugh's Hill, where I was endeavoring to put them into shape for service, and by the 1st of October I had the equivalent of a division of two brigades preparing to move forward toward Green River.  The daily correspondence between General Anderson and myself satisfied me that the worry and harassment at Louisville were exhausting his strength and health, and that he would soon leave.  On a telegraphic summons from him, about the 5th of October, I went down to Louisville, when General Anderson said he could not stand the mental torture of his command any longer, and that he must go away, or it would kill him.  On the 8th of October he actually published an order relinquishing the command, and, by reason of my seniority, I had no alternative but to assume command, though much against the grain, and in direct violation of Mr. Lincoln's promise to me.  I am certain that, in my earliest communication to the War Department, I renewed the expression of my wish to remain in a subordinate position, and that I received the assurance that Brigadier-General Buell would soon arrive from California, and would be sent to relieve me.  By that time I had become pretty familiar with the geography and the general resources of Kentucky.  We had parties all over the State raising regiments and companies; but it was manifest that the young men were generally inclined to the cause of the South, while the older men of property wanted to be let alone--i.e., to remain neutral.  As to a forward movement that fall, it was simply impracticable; for we were forced to use divergent lines, leading our columns farther and farther apart; and all I could attempt was to go on and collect force and material at the two points already chosen, viz., Dick Robinson and Elizabethtown.  General George H. Thomas still continued to command the former, and on the 12th of October I dispatched Brigadier-General A. McD. McCook to command the latter, which had been moved forward to Nolin Creek, fifty-two miles out of Louisville, toward Bowling Green.  Staff-officers began to arrive to relieve us of the constant drudgery which, up to that time, had been forced on General Anderson and myself; and these were all good men.  Colonel Thomas Swords, quartermaster, arrived on the 13th; Paymaster Larned on the 14th; and Lieutenant Smyzer, Fifth Artillery, acting ordnance-officer, on the 20th; Captain Symonds was already on duty as the commissary of subsistence; Captain O. D. Greene was the adjutant-general, and completed a good working staff.  The everlasting worry of citizens complaining of every petty delinquency of a soldier, and forcing themselves forward to discuss politics, made the position of a commanding general no sinecure.  I continued to strengthen the two corps forward and their routes of supply; all the time expecting that Sidney Johnston, who was a real general, and who had as correct information of our situation as I had, would unite his force with Zollicoffer, and fall on Thomas at Dick Robinson, or McCook at Nolin: Had he done so in October, 1861, he could have walked into Louisville, and the vital part of the population would have hailed him as a deliverer.  Why he did not, was to me a mystery then and is now; for I know that he saw the move; and had his wagons loaded up at one time for a start toward Frankfort, passing between our two camps.  Conscious of our weakness, I was unnecessarily unhappy, and doubtless exhibited it too much to those near me; but it did seem to me that the Government at Washington, intent on the larger preparations of Fremont in Missouri and McClellan in Washington, actually ignored us in Kentucky.  About this time, say the middle of October, I received notice, by telegraph, that the Secretary of War, Mr. Cameron (then in St. Louis), would visit me at Louisville, on his way back to Washington.  I was delighted to have an opportunity to properly represent the actual state of affairs, and got Mr. Guthrie to go with me across to Jeffersonville, to meet the Secretary of War and escort him to Louisville.  The train was behind time, but Mr. Guthrie and I waited till it actually arrived.  Mr. Cameron was attended by Adjutant-General Lorenzo Thomas, and six or seven gentlemen who turned out to be newspaper reporters.  Mr. Cameron's first inquiry was, when he could start for Cincinnati, saying that, as he had been detained at St. Louis so long, it was important he should hurry on to Washington.  I explained that the regular mail-boat would leave very soon--viz., at 12 M.--but I begged him to come over to Louisville; that I wanted to see him on business as important as any in Washington, and hoped he would come and spend at least a day with us.  He asked if every thing was not well with us, and I told him far from it; that things were actually bad, as bad as bad could be.  This seemed to surprise him, and Mr. Guthrie added his persuasion to mine; when Mr. Cameron, learning that he could leave Louisville by rail via Frankfort next morning early, and make the same connections at Cincinnati, consented to go with us to Louisville, with the distinct understanding that he must leave early the next morning for Washington.  We accordingly all took hacks, crossed the river by the ferry, and drove to the Galt House, where I was then staying.  Brigadier- General T. J. Wood had come down from Indianapolis by the same train, and was one of the party.  We all proceeded to my room on the first floor of the Galt House, where our excellent landlord, Silas Miller, Esq., sent us a good lunch and something to drink. Mr. Cameron was not well, and lay on my bed, but joined in the general conversation.  He and his party seemed to be full of the particulars of the developments in St. Louis of some of Fremont's extravagant contracts and expenses, which were the occasion of Cameron's trip to St. Louis, and which finally resulted in Fremont's being relieved, first by General Hunter, and after by General H. W. Halleck.  After some general conversation, Mr. Cameron called to me, \"Now, General Sherman, tell us of your troubles.\"  I said I preferred not to discuss business with so many strangers present.  He said, \"They are all friends, all members of my family, and you may speak your mind freely and without restraint.\"  I am sure I stepped to the door, locked it to prevent intrusion, and then fully and fairly represented the state of affairs in Kentucky, especially the situation and numbers of my troops.  I complained that the new levies of Ohio and Indiana were diverted East and West, and we got scarcely any thing; that our forces at Nolin and Dick Robinson were powerless for invasion, and only tempting to a general such as we believed Sidney Johnston to be; that, if Johnston chose, he could march to Louisville any day.  Cameron exclaimed: \"You astonish me! Our informants, the Kentucky Senators and members of Congress, claim that they have in Kentucky"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5851"],["title","Memoirs of General W. T. Sherman, Volume I., Part 2 (#6)"],["body","of men, and all they want are arms and money.\"  I then said it was not true; for the young men were arming and going out openly in broad daylight to the rebel camps, provided with good horses and guns by their fathers, who were at best \"neutral;\" and as to arms, he had, in Washington, promised General Anderson forty thousand of the best Springfield muskets, instead of which we had received only about twelve thousand Belgian muskets, which the Governor of Pennsylvania had refused, as had also the Governor of Ohio, but which had been adjudged good enough for Kentucky.  I asserted that volunteer colonels raising regiments in various parts of the State had come to Louisville for arms, and when they saw what I had to offer had scorned to receive them--to confirm the truth of which I appealed to Mr. Guthrie, who said that every word I had spoken was true, and he repeated what I had often heard him say, that no man who owned a slave or a mule in Kentucky could be trusted.  Mr. Cameron appeared alarmed at what was said, and turned to Adjutant-General L. Thomas, to inquire if he knew of any troops available, that had not been already assigned.  He mentioned Negley's Pennsylvania Brigade, at Pittsburg, and a couple of other regiments that were then en route for St. Louis.  Mr. Cameron ordered him to divert these to Louisville, and Thomas made the telegraphic orders on the spot.  He further promised, on reaching Washington, to give us more of his time and assistance.  In the general conversation which followed, I remember taking a large map of the United States, and assuming the people of the whole South to be in rebellion, that our task was to subdue them, showed that McClellan was on the left, having a frontage of less than a hundred miles, and Fremont the right, about the same; whereas I, the centre, had from the Big Sandy to Paducah, over three hundred miles of frontier; that McClellan had a hundred thousand men, Fremont sixty thousand, whereas to me had only been allotted about eighteen thousand.  I argued that, for the purpose of defense we should have sixty thousand men at once, and for offense, would need two hundred thousand, before we were done.  Mr. Cameron, who still lay on the bed, threw up his hands and exclaimed, \"Great God! where are they to come from?\"  I asserted that there were plenty of men at the North, ready and willing to come, if he would only accept their services; for it was notorious that regiments had been formed in all the Northwestern States, whose services had been refused by the War Department, on the ground that they would not be needed.  We discussed all these matters fully, in the most friendly spirit, and I thought I had aroused Mr. Cameron to a realization of the great war that was before us, and was in fact upon us.  I heard him tell General Thomas to make a note of our conversation, that he might attend to my requests on reaching Washington.  We all spent the evening together agreeably in conversation, many Union citizens calling to pay their respects, and the next morning early we took the train for Frankfort; Mr. Cameron and party going on to Cincinnati and Washington, and I to Camp Dick Robinson to see General Thomas and the troops there.  I found General Thomas in a tavern, with most of his regiments camped about him.  He had sent a small force some miles in advance toward Cumberland Gap, under Brigadier-General Schoepf.  Remaining there a couple of days, I returned to Louisville; on the 22d of October, General Negley's brigade arrived in boats from Pittsburg, was sent out to Camp Nolin; and the Thirty-seventh Indiana., Colonel Hazzard, and Second Minnesota, Colonel Van Cleve, also reached Louisville by rail, and were posted at Elizabethtown and Lebanon Junction.  These were the same troops which had been ordered by Mr. Cameron when at Louisville, and they were all that I received thereafter, prior to my leaving Kentucky.  On reaching Washington, Mr. Cameron called on General Thomas, as he himself afterward told me, to submit his memorandum of events during his absence, and in that memorandum was mentioned my insane request for two hundred thousand men.  By some newspaper man this was seen and published, and, before I had the least conception of it, I was universally published throughout the country as \"insane, crazy,\" etc.  Without any knowledge, however, of this fact, I had previously addressed to the Adjutant-General of the army at Washington this letter:   HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OP THE CUMBERLAND, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY, October 22, 1881.  To General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.  Sir: On my arrival at Camp Dick Robinson, I found General Thomas had stationed a Kentucky regiment at Rock Castle Hill, beyond a river of the same name, and had sent an Ohio and an Indiana regiment forward in support.  He was embarrassed for transportation, and I authorized him to hire teams, and to move his whole force nearer to his advance-guard, so as to support it, as he had information of the approach of Zollicoffer toward London.  I have just heard from him, that he had sent forward General Schoepf with Colonel Wolford's cavalry, Colonel Steadman's Ohio regiment, and a battery of artillery, followed on a succeeding day by a Tennessee brigade.  He had still two Kentucky regiments, the Thirty-eighth Ohio and another battery of artillery, with which he was to follow yesterday.  This force, if concentrated, should be strong enough for the purpose; at all events, it is all he had or I could give him.  I explained to you fully, when here, the supposed position of our adversaries, among which was a force in the valley of Big Sandy, supposed to be advancing on Paris, Kentucky.  General Nelson at Maysville was instructed to collect all the men he could, and Colonel Gill's regiment of Ohio Volunteers.  Colonel Harris was already in position at Olympian Springs, and a regiment lay at Lexington, which I ordered to his support.  This leaves the line of Thomas's operations exposed, but I cannot help it.  I explained so fully to yourself and the Secretary of War the condition of things, that I can add nothing new until further developments, You know my views that this great centre of our field is too weak, far too weak, and I have begged and implored till I dare not say more.  Buckner still is beyond Green River.  He sent a detachment of his men, variously estimated at from two to four thousand toward Greensburg.  General Ward, with about one thousand men, retreated to Campbellsburg, where he called to his assistance some partially-formed regiments to the number of about two thousand. The enemy did not advance, and General Ward was at last dates at Campbellsburg.  The officers charged with raising regiments must of necessity be near their homes to collect men, and for this reason are out of position; but at or near Greensburg and Lebanon, I desire to assemble as large a force of the Kentucky Volunteers as possible.  This organization is necessarily irregular, but the necessity is so great that I must have them, and therefore have issued to them arms and clothing during the process of formation. This has facilitated their enlistment; but inasmuch as the Legislature has provided money for organizing the Kentucky Volunteers, and intrusted its disbursement to a board of loyal gentlemen, I have endeavored to cooperate with them to hasten the formation of these corps.  The great difficulty is, and has been, that as volunteers offer, we have not arms and clothing to give them.  The arms sent us are, as you already know, European muskets of uncouth pattern, which the volunteers will not touch.  General McCook has now three brigades--Johnson's, Wood's, and Rousseau's.  Negley's brigade arrived to-day, and will be sent out at once.  The Minnesota regiment has also arrived, and will be sent forward.  Hazzard's regiment of Indiana troops I have ordered to the month of Salt Creek, an important point on the turnpike-road leading to Elizabethtown.  I again repeat that our force here is out of all proportion to the importance of the position.  Our defeat would be disastrous to the nation; and to expect of new men, who never bore arms, to do miracles, is not right.  I am, with much respect, yours truly,  W. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General commanding.   About this time my attention was drawn to the publication in all the Eastern papers, which of course was copied at the West, of the report that I was \"crazy, insane, and mad,\" that \"I had demanded two hundred thousand men for the defense of Kentucky;\" and the authority given for this report was stated to be the Secretary of War himself, Mr. Cameron, who never, to my knowledge, took pains to affirm or deny it.  My position was therefore simply unbearable, and it is probable I resented the cruel insult with language of intense feeling.  Still I received no orders, no reenforcements, not a word of encouragement or relief.  About November 1st, General McClellan was appointed commander-in-chief of all the armies in the field, and by telegraph called for a report from me.  It is herewith given:   HEADQUARTERS THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Louisville, Kentucky, November 4, 1861  General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.  Sir: In compliance with the telegraphic orders of General McClellan, received late last night, I submit this report of the forces in Kentucky, and of their condition.  The tabular statement shows the position of the several regiments. The camp at Nolin is at the present extremity of the Nashville Railroad.  This force was thrown forward to meet the advance of Buckner's army, which then fell back to Green River, twenty-three miles beyond.  These regiments were substantially without means of transportation, other than the railroad, which is guarded at all dangerous points, yet is liable to interruption at any moment, by the tearing up of a rail by the disaffected inhabitants or a hired enemy.  These regiments are composed of good"]]]
