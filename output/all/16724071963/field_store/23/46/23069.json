D.W.]      IN THE BLUE PIKE, Complete  By Georg Ebers  Volume 1.   Translated from the German by Mary T. Safford    CHAPTER I.  \"May a thunderbolt strike you!\"  The imprecation suited the rough fellow who uttered it.  He had pointed out of doors as he spoke, and scarcely lowered the strange tones of his voice, yet of all the rabble who surrounded him only two persons understood his meaning--a fading, sickly girl, and the red-haired woman, only a few years her senior, who led the swearing man by a chain, like a tame bear.  The Nuremberg magistrates had had Cyriax's tongue cropped for gross blasphemy, and listeners could scarcely comprehend the words he mangled in his gasping speech.  The red-haired woman dropped the knife with which she was slicing bread and onions into a pot, and looked at her companion with an anxious, questioning glance.  \"Nuremberg Honourables,\" he stammered as fast as he could, snatched his wife's shawl from her shoulders, and drew it over his unkempt head.  The woman beckoned to their travelling companions--a lame fellow of middle age who, propped on crutches, leaned against the wall, an older pock-marked man with a bloated face, and the sickly girl--calling to them in the harsh, metallic voice peculiar to hawkers and elderly singers at fairs.  \"Help  Cyriax  hide.  You  first, Jungel!  They needn't recognise him as soon as they get in.  Nuremberg magistrates are coming.  Aristocratic blood-suckers of the Council.  Who knows what may still be on the tally for us?\"  Kuni, the pale-faced girl, wrapped her bright-coloured garment tighter around her mutilated left leg, and obeyed.  Lame Jungel, too, prepared to fulfil red-haired Gitta's wish.  But Raban had glanced out, and hastily drew the cloth jerkin, patched with green and blue linen, closer through his belt, ejaculating anxiously:  \"Young Groland of the Council.  I know him.\"  This exclamation induced the other vagabonds to glide along the wall to the nearest door, intending to slip out.  \"A Groland?\" asked Gitta, Cyriax's wife, cowering as if threatened with a blow from an invisible hand.  \"It was he--\"  \"He?\" laughed the chain-bearer, while he crouched beside her, drawing himself into the smallest space possible.  \"No, Redhead!  The devil dragged the man who did that down to the lower regions long ago, on account of my tongue.  It's his son.  The younger, the sharper.  This stripling made Casper Rubling,--[Dice, in gambler's slang]--poor wretch, pay for his loaded dice with his eyesight.\"  He thrust his hand hurriedly into his jerkin as he spoke, and gave Gitta something which he had concealed there.  It was a set of dice, but, with ready presence of mind, she pressed them so hard into the crumb of the loaf of bread which she had just cut that it entirely concealed them.  All this had passed wholly unnoticed in the corner of the long, wide room, for all the numerous travellers whom it sheltered were entirely occupied with their own affairs.  Nothing was understood except what was said between neighbour and neighbour, for a loud uproar pervaded the tavern of The Blue Pike.  It was one of the most crowded inns, being situated on the main ferry at Miltenberg, where those journeying from Nuremberg, Augsburg, and other South German cities, on their way to Frankfort and the Lower Rhine, rested and exchanged the saddle for the ship.  Just at the present time many persons of high and low degree were on their way to Cologne, whither the Emperor Maximilian, having been unable to come in April to Trier on the Moselle, had summoned the Reichstag.  The opening would take place in a few days, and attracted not only princes, counts, and knights, exalted leaders and more modest servants of the Church, ambassadors from the cities, and other aristocrats, but also honest tradesfolk, thriving money-lenders with the citizen's cloak and the yellow cap of the Jew, vagrants and strollers of every description, who hoped to practise their various feats to the best advantage, or to fill their pockets by cheating and robbery.  This evening many had gathered in the spacious taproom of The Blue Pike. Now those already present were to be joined by the late arrivals whom Cyriax had seen ride up.  It was a stately band.  Four aristocratic gentlemen at the head of the troop were followed by an escort of twenty-five Nuremberg mercenaries, a gay company whose crimson coats, with white slashes on the puffed sleeves, presented a showy spectacle.  Their helmets and armour glittered in the bright light of the setting sun of the last day of July, as they turned their horses in front of the wide gateway of The Blue Pike to ride into Miltenberg and ask lodgings of the citizens.  The trampling of hoofs, the shouts of command, and the voices of the gentlemen and their attendants outside attracted many guests to the doors and windows of the long, whitewashed building.  The strollers, however, kept the place at theirs without difficulty; no one desired to come near them.  The girl with the bandaged foot had now also turned her face toward the street.  As her gaze rested on the youngest of the Nuremberg dignitaries, her pale cheeks flushed, and, as if unconsciously, the exclamation: \"It is he!\" fell from her lips.  \"Who?\"  asked red-haired Gitta, and was quickly answered in a low tone  \"I mean Lienhard, Herr Groland.\"  \"The young one,\" stuttered Cyriax.  Then, raising the shawl, he continued inquisitively:  \"Do you know him?  For good or for evil?\"  The girl, whose face, spite of its sunken cheeks and the dark rings under the deep-set blue eyes, still bore distinct traces of former beauty, started and answered sharply, though not very loudly, for speech was difficult:  \"Good is what you call evil, and evil is what you call good.  My acquaintance with Lienhard, Herr Groland, is my own affair, and, you may be sure, will remain mine.\"  She glanced contemptuously away from the others out of doors, but Cyriax, spite of his mutilated tongue, retorted quickly and harshly:  \"I always said so.  She'll die a saint yet.\"  Then grasping Kuni's arm roughly, he dragged her down to him, and whispered jeeringly:  \"Ratz has a full purse and sticks to his offer for the cart.  If you put on airs long, he'll get it and the donkey, too, and you'll be left here. What was it about Groland?  You can try how you'll manage on your stump without us, if we're too bad for you.\"  \"We are not under eternal obligations to you on the child's account,\" added red-haired Gitta in a gentler tone.  \"Don't vex my husband, or he'll keep his word about the cart, and who else will be bothered with a useless creature like you?\"  The girl lowered her eyes and looked at her crippled limb.  How would she get on without the cart, which received her when the pain grew too sharp and the road was too hard and long?  So she turned to the others again, saying soothingly:  \"It all happened in the time before I fell.\"  Then she looked out of doors once more, but she did not find what she sought.  The Nuremberg travellers had ridden through the broad gateway into the large square courtyard, surrounded by stables on three sides.  When Cyriax and his wife again called to her, desiring to know what had passed between her and Groland, she clasped her hands around her knees, fixed her eyes on the gaystuffs wound around the stump where her foot had been amputated, and in a low, reluctant tone, continued:  \"You want to learn what I have to do with Herr Groland?  It was about six years ago, in front of St. Sebald's church, in Nuremberg.  A wedding was to take place.  The bridegroom was one of the Council--Lienhard Groland. The marriage was to be a very quiet one--the bridegroom's father lay seriously ill.  Yet there could have been no greater throng at the Emperor's nuptials.  I stood in the midst of the crowd.  A rosary dropped from the belt of the fat wife of a master workman--she was decked out like a peacock--and fell just in front of me.  It was a costly ornament, pure gold and Bohemian garnets.  I did not let it lie there.\"  \"A miracle!\" chuckled Cyriax, but the girl was obliged to conquer a severe attack of coughing before she could go on with her story.  \"The chaplet fairly burned my hand.  I would gladly have given it back, but the woman was no longer before me.  Perhaps I might have returned it, but I won't say so positively.  However, there was no time to do it; the wedding party was coming, and on that account  But what is the use of talking?  While I was still gazing, the owner discovered her loss. An officer seized me, and so I was taken to prison and the next day was brought before the magistrates.  Herr Groland was one of them, and, since it wasn't certain that I would not have restored the property I found, he interceded in my behalf.  When the others still wished to punish me, he besought my release because it was my first offence.  So we met, and when I admit that I am grateful to him for it, you know all.\"  \"H'm,\" replied Cyriax, giggling, as  he nudged his wife in the side and made remarks concerning what he had just heard which induced even red- haired Gitta to declare that the loss of his tongue was scarcely a misfortune.  Kuni indignantly turned her back upon the slanderer and gazed out of the window again.  The Nuremberg Honourables had disappeared, but several grooms were unbuckling the knapsacks from the horses and carrying them into the house.  The aristocratic travellers were probably cleansing themselves from the dust of the road before they entered the taproom.  Kuni thought so, and gazed sometimes into vacancy, sometimes into her own lap.  Her eyes had a dreamy light, for the incident which she had just related rose before her mind with perfect clearness.  It seemed as though she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5587"],["title","In the Blue Pike â€” Complete (#1)"],["body","gazing a second time at the wedding procession which was approaching St. Sebald's, and the couple who led it.  Never had she beheld anything fairer than the bride with the myrtle wreath on her beautifully formed head, whence a delicate lace veil floated over her long, thick, golden hair.  She could not help gazing at her as if spellbound.  When she moved forward, holding her bridegroom's hand, she appeared to float over the rice and flowers strewn in her path to the church--it was in February.  As Kuni saw the bride raise her large blue eyes to her lover's so tenderly and yet so modestly, and the bridegroom thank her with a long joyous look of love, she wondered what must be the feelings of a maiden who, so pure, so full of ardent love, and so fervently beloved in return, was permitted to approach the house of God, accompanied by a thousand pious wishes, with the first and only man whom she loved, and to whom she wished to devote herself for her whole life.  Again, as at that time, a burning thrill ran through her limbs.  Then a bitter smile hovered around her lips.  She had asked herself whether the heart of one who experienced such joys, to whom such a fate was allotted, would not burst from sheer joy.  Now the wish, the hope, and every new resolve for good or ill were alike over.  At that hour, before the door of St. Sebald's, she had been capable of all, all, perhaps even the best things, if any one had cherished her in his heart as Lienhard Groland loved the beautiful woman at his side.  She could not help remembering the spell with which the sight of those two had forced her to watch their every movement, to gaze at them, and them only, as if the world contained nothing else.  How often she had repeated to herself that in that hour she was bewitched, whether by him or by her she could not decide.  As the throng surged forward, she had been crowded against the woman who lost the rosary.  She had not had the faintest thought of it when the bailiff suddenly snatched her from her rapturous gazing to stern reality, seizing with a rude grip the hand that held the jewel.  Then, pursued by the reviling and hissing of the populace, she had been taken to prison.  Now she again saw herself amid the vile rabble assembled there, again felt how eagerly she inhaled the air as she was led across the courtyard of the townhall into the presence of the magistrates.  Oh, if she could but take such a long, deep breath of God's pure air as she did then! But that time was past.  Her poor, sunken chest would no longer permit it.  Then she fancied that she was again standing before the judges, who were called The Five.  Four magistrates sat with the Pfander--[Chief of police]--at the table covered with a green cloth, but one, who surpassed all the others both in stature and in manly beauty, was the selfsame Lienhard Groland, who yesterday had led to the altar the wonderfully lovely girl who had bewitched her.  She felt how the blood had mounted into her cheeks when she again saw him who could know nothing of her except that she was a jade, who had stolen another person's property.  Yet her glance soon met his, and he must have been blind had he not read in the radiant lustre of her blue eyes, which had early learned to woo applause and promise love, what he was to her, and how gratefully her heart throbbed for him.  After the other gentlemen had treated her harshly, and threatened to put her in the stocks, he interceded for her, and entreated his brother magistrates to let mercy, in this instance, take the place of justice, because she was so young, and perhaps had intended to return the rosary later.  Finally he bent smiling toward his companions and said something to them in a subdued tone.  The voice was so low that his intention to keep her in ignorance of it was evident.  But Kuni's hearing had been as keen as a bird's, and not a word escaped her.  He could not help regarding it as an evil omen for him and his young wife if a girl, hitherto unpunished, should be plunged into disgrace and perhaps made miserable throughout the rest of a long life on account of his wedding procession.  How high her heart had throbbed at this request, and when it was granted, the discussion closed, and she herself informed that she would be set free, she hurried after her preserver, who had left the Council chamber with the other magistrates, to thank him.  He permitted her to detain him, and when she found herself alone in his presence, at first, with streaming eyes, she was unable to utter a word.  He laid his hand kindly on her shoulder to soothe her, and then listened to her assurance that, though she was a strolling rope-dancer, she had never taken other people's property.  Now she closed her eyes to have a clearer vision of the picture evoked by memory, which rose so vividly before her.  Again she saw herself seize his hand to kiss it humbly, yet with fervent devotion; again she met the patronizing but friendly smile with which he withdrew it, and a thrill of happiness ran through every nerve, for she imagined she once more felt his slender white hand soothingly stroke her black hair and burning cheeks, as if she were a sick child who needed help.  Later years had never granted her aught more blissful than that moment.  As had often happened before, the memory of it overmastered her with such power that she could not escape it, but recalled his every look and movement.  Meanwhile, she imagined that she heard his voice, whose deep, pure tones had pleased her ear, alive to harmony, more than any to which she had ever listened, counselling her to give up her vagrant life, and again received his assurance that he pitied her, and it would grieve him if she, who seemed worthy of a better fate, should be ruined, body and soul, so young.  Thus absorbed, she neither saw nor listened to anything that was occurring near her or in the large room of the tavern, but stood gazing into vacancy as if rapt away from earth.  True, Cyriax and the others had lowered their voices, for they were talking about her and the aristocratic couple on whose wedding day Kuni had stolen the rosary.  Raban, a tall, lank vagabond with red-rimmed eyes, whose ugly face bristled with a half-grown black beard, had a few more particulars to give concerning the bride and bridegroom.  He wandered about the world and, whenever he stretched out his hand to beg, gave the pretext that he was collecting the price of blood required for a man whom he had killed in self-defence, that his own head might not fall under the axe of the executioner.  His dead father had heated the furnaces in the smelting works at Eschenbach, near Nuremberg, and the bride was Katharina, the eldest of the three daughters of the owner, old Harsdorffer of the Council.  He had been a man of steel and iron, and opposed Lienhard Groland's father at every point, not excepting even their official business.  When he discovered that the young man was carrying on a love affair with his daughter, he had summoned him before a court of justice for a breach of the law which forbade minors to betroth themselves without parental consent.  The magistrates sentenced Lienhard to five years' exile from the city but, through the Emperor's mediation, he was spared the punishment.  Old Harsdorffer afterward succeeded in keeping the suitor away from his daughter a long time, but finally relinquished his opposition.  \"The devil came soon enough and broke his stiff neck,\" added Cyriax, on whom the vagabond's story had had the same effect as a red rag upon a bull.  Spite of the old slanderer's mutilated tongue, invectives flowed fast enough from his lips when he thought of young Frau Groland's father. If the Groland outside resembled his father-in-law, he would like to drink him a pledge that should burn like the plague and ruin.  He snatched a flask from his pocket as he spoke, and after a long pull and a still longer \"A-ah!\" he stammered:  \"I've been obliged to bid farewell to my tongue, yet it feels as if it were sticking in my throat like the dry sole of a shoe.  That's what comes from talking in this dog-day heat.\"  He looked into the empty bottle and was about to send Kuni out to fill it again.  In turning to do so he saw her pale face, wan with suffering, but which now glowed with a happy light that lent it a strange beauty.  How large her blue eyes were!  When he had picked her up in Spain she was already a cripple and in sore distress.  But Groland probably knew what he was about when he released her.  She must have been a pretty creature enough at that time, and he knew that before her fall she was considered one of the most skilful rope-dancers.  An elderly woman with a boy, whose blindness helped her to arouse compassion, was crouching by Raban's side, and had just been greeted by Kuni as an old acquaintance.  They had journeyed from land to land in Loni's famous troupe, and as Raban handed Cyriax his own bottle, he turned from the dreaming girl, whose services he no longer needed, and whispered to the blind boy's mother--who among the people of her own calling still went by the name of Dancing Gundel--the question whether yonder ailing cripple had once had any good looks, and what position she had held among rope-dancers.  The little gray-haired woman looked up with sparkling eyes.  Under the name of \"Phyllis\" she had earned, ere her limbs were stiffened by age, great applause by her dainty egg-dance and all sorts of feats with the balancing pole.  The manager of the band had finally given her the position of crier to support herself and her blind boy.  This had made her voice so hollow and hoarse that it was difficult to understand her as, with fervid eloquence, vainly striving to be heard by absent-minded Kuni, she began: \"She surpassed even Maravella the Spaniard.  And her feats at Augsburg during the Reichstag--I tell you, Cyriax, when she ascended the rope to the belfry, with the pole and without--\"  \"I've just"]]]
