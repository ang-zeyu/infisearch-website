Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.   When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.  It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the greenhouse, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.  When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit- tobacco.     THE TALE OF TWO BAD MICE  [For W.M.L.W., the Little Girl Who Had the Doll's House]     Once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney.  It belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.  Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.  There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges.  They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.   One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.  Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again. Tom Thumb was a mouse.  A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.  The doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug. They pushed the front door--it was not fast.   Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!  Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!  Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red.  The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.  \"It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.\"  Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.  \"It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,\" said Hunca Munca.  The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.   \"Let it alone,\" said Tom Thumb; \"give me some fish, Hunca Munca!\"  Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.  Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash!  The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!  Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges.  As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.   Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top-- there was no soot.  While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled-- Rice--Coffee--Sago--but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.  Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.  But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.   With Tom Thumbs's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearth-rug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse- hole; but they managed it somehow.  Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird- cage, and several small odds and ends. The book-case and the bird- cage refused to go into the mousehole.  Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.   Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.  What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda! Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark.  The book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal- box--but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda's clothes.   She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.  The little girl that the doll's-house belonged to, said,--\"I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!\"  But the nurse said,--\"I will set a mouse-trap!\"  So that is the story of the two Bad Mice,--but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.   He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.  And very early every morning-- before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!    THE TALE OF MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE   [For the Real Little Lucie of Newlands]     Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! \"I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?\"  The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--  \"Sally Henny-penny, have YOU found three pocket-handkins?\"  But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  \"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\"  And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig. Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little- town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.   Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!  Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.  Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg- cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were footmarks of a VERY small person.  Lucie ran on, and on.  The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--       \"Lily-white and clean, oh!      With little frills between, oh!      Smooth and hot-red rusty spot      Never here be seen, oh!\"    Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out \"Who's that?\"  Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams-- just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.  There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.  Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!  \"Who are you?\" said Lucie. \"Have you seen my pocket-handkins?\"   The little person made a bob- curtsey--\"Oh yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear- starcher!\" And she took something out of the clothesbasket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.  \"What's that thing?\" said Lucie- \"that's not my pocket-handkin?\"  \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!\"  And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.  Then she took something else off a clothes-horse--\"That isn't my pinny?\" said Lucie.  \"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.   \"There's one of my pocket- handkins!\" cried Lucie--\"and there's my pinny!\"  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  \"Oh that IS lovely!\" said Lucie.  \"And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?\"  \"Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],["title","The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#4)"],["body","yard! She'll very soon go barefoot!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  \"Why, there's another hankersniff-- but it isn't mine; it's red?\"  \"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out that smell.\"  \"There's another one of mine,\" said Lucie.   \"What are those funny little white things?\"  \"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.\"  \"There's my last pocket-handkin!\" said Lucie.  \"And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?\"  \"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!\" said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle. \"Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.\"  \"What are these dear soft fluffy things?\" said Lucie.  \"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.\"  \"Will their jackets take off?\" asked Lucie.  \"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're ALWAYS marked at washing!\" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.   And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!  Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIRPINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.  When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.   And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.  Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!  And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.  So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.   Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say \"Good-night,\" and to thank the washer-woman.--But what a VERY odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown-and her petticoat?  And HOW small she had grown-- and HOW brown--and covered with PRICKLES!  Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG!  * * * * * *  (Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?  And besides--I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)     THE PIE AND THE PATTY-PAN          Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?      In walks the little dog--says \"Pussy are you there?      How do you do Mistress Pussy? Mistress Pussy, how           do you do?\"      \"I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!\"                                         [Old Rhyme]    Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.  \"Come in good time, my dear Duchess,\" said Ribby's letter, \"and we will have something so very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And YOU shall eat it all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!\" wrote Ribby.  \"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,\" wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added--\"I hope it isn't mouse?\"  And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out \"isn't mouse\" and changed it to \"I hope it will be fine,\" and she gave her letter to the postman.  But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.   \"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!\" said Duchess to herself--\"I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And MY pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.\"  Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.  \"Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?\"  Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.  \"The top oven bakes too quickly,\" said Ribby to herself.   Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.  Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen.  When Ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.  When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.  Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.  And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village.  Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.   As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply ran! Straight away to Ribby's house!  Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.  Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. Then she went home.  There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door. But there was nobody there.  Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.  \"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in! And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,\" said Duchess, \"but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!\"   Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.  Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her dress.  She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob. She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.  She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. \"I am glad I used the BOTTOM oven,\" said Ribby, \"the top one would certainly have been very much too hot.\"  Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party.  At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity. \"Is Mrs. Ribston at home?\" inquired Duchess in the porch.   \"Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?\" cried Ribby. \"I hope I see you well?\"  \"Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?\" said Duchess. \"I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!\"  \"Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!\"  \"I think it wants another five minutes,\" said Ribby. \"Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?\"  \"Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?\"  \"With pleasure, my dear Duchess.\"  Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--  \"How good that pie smells! I do love veal and ham--I mean to say mouse and bacon--\"  She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.   Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.  Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.  \"I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,\" said Ribby.  \"I think\"--(thought Duchess to herself)--\"I THINK it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.\"  The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.  \"A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?\" said Ribby.  \"Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.\"  \"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?\"  \"The patty pan that held up the pie-crust,\" said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.   \"Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,\" said Ribby; \"I don't think that it is necessary in "]]]
