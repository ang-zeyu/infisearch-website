For “Gearge” was six feet one and three-quarters in his stockings.  He had a face in some respects like a big baby’s.  He had a turn-up nose, large smooth cheeks, a particularly innocent expression, a forehead hardly worth naming, small dull eyes, with a tendency to inflammation of the lids which may possibly have hindered the lashes from growing, and a mouth which was generally open, if he were neither eating nor sucking a “bennet.”  When this countenance was bathed in flour, it might be an open question whether it were improved or no.  It certainly looked both “vairer” and more “voolish!”  There is some evidence to show that he was “lazy,” as well as “lang,” and yet he and Master Lake contrived to pull on together.  Either because his character was as childlike as his face, and because—if stupid and slothful by nature—he was also of so submissive, susceptible, and willing a temper that he disarmed the justest wrath; or because he was, as he said, not such a fool as he looked, and had in his own lubberly way taken the measure of the masterful windmiller to a nicety, George’s most flagrant acts of neglect had never yet secured his dismissal.  Indeed, it really is difficult to realize that any one who is lavish of willingness by word can wilfully and culpably fail in deed.  “I be a uncommon vool, maester, sartinly,” blubbered George on one occasion when the miller was on the point of turning him off, as a preliminary step on the road to the “gallus,” which Master Lake expressed his belief that he was “sartin sure to come to.”  And, as he spoke, George made dismal daubs on his befloured face with his sleeve, as he rubbed his eyes with his arm from elbow to wrist.  “Sech a governor as you be, too!” he continued.  “Poor mother! she allus said I should come to no good, such a gawney as I be!  No more I shouldn’t but for you, Master Lake, a-keeping of me on.  Give un another chance, sir, do ’ee!  I be mortal stoopid, sir, but I’d work my fingers to the bwoan for the likes of you, Master Lake!”  George stayed on, and though the very next time the windmiller was absent his “voolish” assistant did not get so much as a toll-dish of corn ground to flour, he was so full of penitence and promises that he weathered that tempest and many a succeeding one.  On that very eventful night of the storm, and of Jan’s arrival, George’s neglect had risked a recurrence of the sail catastrophe.  At least if the second man’s report was to be trusted.  This man had complained to the windmiller that, during his absence with the strangers, George, instead of doubling his vigilance now that the men were left short-handed, had taken himself off under pretext of attending to the direction of the wind and the position of the sails outside, a most important matter, to which he had not, after all, paid the slightest heed; and what he did with himself, whilst leaving the mill to its fate and the fury of the storm, his indignant fellow-servant professed himself “blessed if he knew.”  But few people are as grateful as they should be when informed of misconduct in their own servants.  It is a reflection on one’s judgment.  And unpardonable as George’s conduct was, if the tale were true, the words in which he couched his self-defence were so much more grateful to the ears of the windmiller than the somewhat free and independent style in which the other man expressed his opinion of George’s conduct and qualities, that the master took his servant’s part, and snubbed the informer for his pains.  In justice to George, too, it should be said that he stoutly and repeatedly denied the whole story, with many oaths and imprecations of horrible calamities upon himself if he were lying in the smallest particular.  And this with reiteration so steady, and a countenance so guileless and unmoved, as to contrast favorably with the face of the other man, whose voice trembled and whose forehead flushed, either with overwhelming indignation or with a guilty consciousness that he was bearing false witness.  Master Lake employed him no more, and George stayed on.  But, for that matter, Master Lake’s disposition was not one which permitted him to profit by the best qualities of those connected with him.  He was a bit of a tyrant, and more than one man, six times as clever, and ten times as hard-working as George, had gone when George would have stayed, from crossing words with the windmiller.  The safety of the priceless sails, if all were true, had been risked by the man he kept, and secured by the man he sent away, but Master Lake was quite satisfied with his own decision.  “I bean’t so fond myself of men as is so mortal sprack and fussy in a strange place,” the miller observed to Mrs. Lake in reference to this matter.  Mrs. Lake had picked up several of her husband’s bits of proverbial wisdom, which she often flattered him by retailing to his face.  “Too hot to hold, mostly,” was her reply, in knowing tones.  “Ay, ay, missus, so a be,” said the windmiller.  And after a while he added, “Gearge is slow, sartinly, mortal slow; but Gearge is sure.”     CHAPTER V.   THE POCKET-BOOK AND THE FAMILY BIBLE.—FIVE POUNDS’ REWARD.  OF the strange gentleman who brought Jan to the windmill, the Lakes heard no more, but the money was paid regularly through a lawyer in London.  From this lawyer, indeed, Master Lake had heard immediately after the arrival of his foster-son.  The man of business wrote to say that the gentleman who had visited the mill on a certain night had, at that date, lost a pocket-book, which he thought might have been picked up at the mill.  It contained papers only valuable to the owner, and also a five-pound note, which was liberally offered to the windmiller if he could find the book, and forward it at once.  Master Lake began to have a kind of reckless, gambling sort of feeling about luck.  Here would be an easily earned five pounds, if he could but have the luck to find the missing property!  That ten shillings a week had come pretty easily to him.  When all is said, there _are_ people into whose mouths the larks fall ready cooked!  The windmiller looked inside the mill and outside the mill, and wandered a long way along the chalky road with his eyes downwards, but he was no nearer to the five-pound note for his pains.  Then he went to his wife, but she had seen nothing of the pocket-book; on which her husband somewhat unreasonably observed that, “A might a been zartin _thee_ couldn’t help un!”  He next betook himself to George, who was slowly, and it is to be hoped surely, sweeping out the round-house.  “Gearge, my boy,” said the windmiller, in not too anxious tones, “have ’ee seen a pocket-book lying about anywheres?”  George leaned upon his broom with one hand, and with the other scratched his white head.  “What be a pocket-book, then, Master Lake?” said he, grinning, as if at his own ignorance.  “Thee’s eerd of a pocket-book before now, thee vool, sure-ly!” said the impatient windmiller.  “I’se eerd of a pocket of hops, Master Lake,” said George, after an irritating pause, during which he still smiled, and scratched his poll as if to stimulate recollection.  “Book—book—book! pocket-_book_!” shouted the miller.  “If thee can’t read, thee knows what a book is, thee gawney!”  “What a vool I be, to be sure!” said George, his simple countenance lighted up with a broader smile than before.  “I knows a book, sartinly, Master Lake, I knows a book.  There’s one,” George continued, speaking even slower than before,—“there’s one inzide, sir,—a big un.  On the shelf it be.  A Vamly Bible they calls un.  And I’m sartin sure it be there,” he concluded, “for a hasn’t been moved since the last time you christened, Master Lake.”  The miller turned away, biting his lip hard, to repress a useless outburst of rage, and George, still smiling sweetly, spun the broom dexterously between his hands, as a man spins the water out of a stable mop.  Just before Master Lake had got beyond earshot, George lowered the broom, and began to scratch his head once more.  “I be a proper vool, sartinly,” said he; and when the miller heard this, he turned back. “Mother allus said I’d no more sense in my yead than a dumbledore,” George candidly confessed.  And by a dumbledore he meant a humble-bee. “It do take me such a time to mind any thing, sir.”  “Well, never mind, Gearge,” said the miller; “if thee’s slow, thee’s sure.  What do ’ee remember about the book, now, Gearge?  A don’t mind giving thee five shilling, if thee finds un, Gearge.”  “A had un down at the burying, I ’member quite well now, sir.  To put the little un’s name in ’twas.  I thowt a hadn’t been down zince christening, I be so stoopid sartinly.”  “What are you talking about, ye vool?” roared the miller.  “The book, sir, sartinly,” said George, his honest face beaming with good-humor.  “The Vamly Bible, Master Lake.”  And as the windmiller went off muttering something which the Family Bible would by no means have sanctioned, George returned chuckling to a leisurely use of his broom on the round-house floor.  Master Lake did not find the pocket-book, and after a day or two it was advertised in a local paper, and a reward of five pounds offered for it.  George Sannel was seated one evening in the “Heart of Oak” inn, sipping some excellent home-brewed ale, which had been warmed up for his consumption in a curious funnel-shaped pipkin, when his long lop-ears caught a remark made by the inn-keeper, who was reading out bits from the local paper to a small audience, unable to read it for themselves.  “Five pound reward!” he read.  “Lor massy!  There be a sum to be easily earned by a sharp-eyed chap with good luck on ’s side.”  “And how then, Master Chuter?” said George, pausing, with the steaming mug half-way to his lips.  “Haw, haw!” roared the inn-keeper:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5601"],["title","Jan of the Windmill: A Story of the Plains (#6)"],["body"," “you be a sharp-eyed chap, too!  Do ’ee think ’twould suit thee, Gearge?  Thee’s a sprack chap, sartinly, Gearge!”  “Haw, haw, haw!” roared the other members of the company, as they slowly realized Master Chuter’s irony at the expense of the “voolish” Gearge.  George took their rough banter in excellent part.  He sipped his beer, and grinned like a cat at his own expense.  But after the guffaws had subsided, he said, “Thee’s not told un about that five pound yet, Master Chuter.”  The curiosity of the company was by this time aroused, and Master Chuter explained: “’Tis a gentleman by the name of Ford as is advertising for a pocket-book, a seems to have lost on the downs, near to Master Lake’s windmill.  ’Tis thy way, too, Gearge, after all.  Thee must get up yarly, Gearge.  ’Tis the yarly bird catches the worm.  And tell Master Lake from me, ’ll have all the young varments in the place a driving their pigs up to his mill, to look for the pocket-book, while they makes believe to be minding their pigs.”  “’Tis likely, too,” said George.  And the two or three very aged laborers in smocks, and one other lubberly boy, who composed the rest of the circle, added, severally and collectively, “’Tis likely, too.”  But, as George beat his way home over the downs in the dusk, he said aloud, under cover of the roaring wind, and in all the security of the open country,—  “Vive pound! vive pound!  And a offered me vive shilling for un.  Master Lake, you be dog-ged cute; but Gearge bean’t quite such a vool as a looks.”  After a short time the advertisement was withdrawn.     CHAPTER VI.   GEORGE GOES COURTING.—GEORGE AS AN ENEMY.—GEORGE AS A FRIEND.—ABEL PLAYS SCHOOL-MASTER.—THE LOVE-LETTER.—MOERDYK.—THE MILLER-MOTH.—AN ANCIENT DITTY.  ONE day George Sannel asked and obtained leave for a holiday.  On the morning in question, he dressed himself in the cleanest of smocks, greased his boots, stuck a bloody warrior, or dark-colored wallflower, in his bosom, put a neatly folded, clean cotton handkerchief into his pocket,—which, even if he did not use it, was a piece of striking dandyism,—and scrubbed his honest face to such a point of cleanliness that Mrs. Lake was almost constrained to remark that she thought he must be going courting.  George did not blush,—he never blushed,—but he looked “voolish” enough to warrant the suspicion that his errand was a tender one, and he had no other reason to give for his spruce appearance.  It was, perhaps, in his confusion that he managed to convey a mistaken notion of the place to which he was going to Mrs. Lake.  She was under the impression that he went to the neighboring town, whereas he went to one in an exactly opposite direction, and some miles farther away.  He went to the bank, too, which seems an unlikely place for tender tryst; but George’s proceedings were apt to be less direct than the simplicity of his looks and speech would have led a stranger to suppose.  When he reached home, the windmiller and his family were going to bed, for the night was still, and the mill idle.  George betook himself at once to where his truckle-bed stood in the round-house, and proceeded to light his mill-candlestick, which was stuck into the wall.  From the chink into which it was stuck he then counted seven bricks downwards, and the seventh yielded to a slight effort and came out.  It was the door, so to speak, of a hole in the wall of the mill, from which he drew a morocco-bound pocket-book.  After an uneasy glance over his shoulder, to make sure that the long dark shadow which stretched from his own heels, and shifted with the draught in which the candle flared, was not the windmiller creeping up behind him, he took a letter out of the book and held it to the light as if to read it.  But he never turned the page, and at last replaced it with a sigh.  Then he put the pocket-book back into the hole, and pushed in after it his handkerchief, which was tied round something which chinked as he pressed it in.  Then he replaced the brick, and went to bed.  He said nothing about the bank in the morning nor about the hole in the mill-wall; and he parried Mrs. Lake’s questions with gawky grins and well-assumed bashfulness.  Abel overheard his mother’s jokes on the subject of “Gearge’s young ’ooman,” and they recurred to him when he and George formed a curious alliance, which demands explanation.  It was not solely because the windmiller looked favorably upon the little Jan that he and Abel were now allowed to wander in the business parts of the windmill, when they could not be out of doors, to an extent never before permitted to the children.  Part of the change was due to a change in the miller’s man.  However childlike in some respects himself, George was not fond of children, and he had hitherto seemed to have a particular spite against Abel.  He, quite as often as the miller, would drive the boy from the round-house, and thwart his fancy for climbing the ladders to see the processes of the different floors.  Abel would have been happy for hours together watching the great stones grind, or the corn poured by golden showers into the hopper on its way to the stones below.  Many a time had he crept up and hidden himself behind a sack; but George seemed to have an impish ingenuity in discovering his hiding-places, and would drive him out as a dog worries a cat, crying, “Come out, thee little varment!  Master Lake he don’t allow thee hereabouts.”  The cleverness of the miller’s man in discovering poor Abel’s retreats probably arose from the fact that he had so rooted a dislike for the routine work of his daily duties that he would rather employ himself about the mill in any way than by attending to the mill-business, and that his idleness and stupidity over work were only equalled by his industry and shrewdness in mischief.  Poor Abel had a dread of the great, gawky, mischievous-looking man, which probably prevented his complaining to his mother of many a sly pinch and buffet which he endured from him.  And George took some pains to keep up this wholesome awe of himself, by vague and terrifying speeches, and by a trick of what he called “dropping on” poor Abel in the dusk, with hideous grimaces and uncouth sounds.  He once came thus upon Abel in an upper floor, and the boy fled from him so hastily that he caught his foot in the ladder and fell headlong. Though it must have been quite uncertain for some moments whether Abel had not broken his neck, the miller’s man displayed no anxiety.  He only clapped his hands upon his knees, in a sort of uncouth ecstasy of spite, saying, “Down a comes vlump, like a twoad from roost.  Haw, haw, haw!”  Happily, Abel fell with little more damage to himself than the mill-cats experienced in many such a tumble, as they fled before the tormenting George.  But, after all this, it was with no small surprise that Abel found himself the object of attentions from the miller’s man, which bore the look of friendliness.  At first, when George made civil speeches, and invited Abel to “see the stwones a-grinding,” he only felt an additional terror, being convinced that mischief was meant in reality.  But, when days and weeks went by, and he wandered unmolested from floor to floor, with many a kindly word from George, and not a single cuff or nip, the sweet-tempered Abel began to feel gratitude, and almost an affection, for his quondam tormentor.  George, for his part, had hitherto done some violence to his own feelings by his constant refusal to allow Abel to help him to sweep the mill or couple the sacks for lifting.  He would have been only too glad to put some of his own work on the shoulders of another, had it not been for the vexatious thought that he would be giving pleasure by so doing where he only wanted to annoy.  And in his very unamiable disposition malice was a stronger quality even than idleness.  But now, when for some reason best known to himself, he wished to win Abel’s regard, it was a slight recompense to him for restraining his love of tormenting that he got a good deal of work out of Abel at odd moments when the miller was away.  So well did he manage this, that a marked improvement in the tidiness of the round-house drew some praise from his master.  “Thee’ll be a sprack man yet, Gearge,” said the windmiller, encouragingly.  “Thee takes the broom into the corners now.”  “So I do,” said George, unblushingly, “so I do.  But lor, Master Lake, what a man you be to notice un!”  George’s kinder demeanor towards Abel began shortly after the coming of the little Jan, and George himself accounted for it in the following manner:—  “You do be kind to me now, Gearge,” said Abel, gratefully, as he stood one day, with the baby in his arms, watching the miller’s man emptying a sack of grain into the hopper.  “I likes to see thee with that babby, Abel,” said George, pausing in his work.  “Thee’s a good boy, Abel, and careful.  I likes to do any thing for thee, Abel.”  “I wish I could do any thing for thee, Gearge,” said Abel; “but I be too small to help the likes of you, Gearge.”  “If you’re small, you’re sprack,” said the miller’s man.  “Thee’s a good scholar, too, Abel.  I’ll be bound thee can read, now?  And a poor gawney like I doesn’t know’s letters.”  “I can read a bit, Gearge,” said Abel, with pride; “but I’ve been at home a goodish while; but mother says she’ll send I to school again in spring, if the little un gets on well and walks.”  “I wish I could read,” said George, mournfully; “but time’s past for me to go to school, Abel; and who’d teach a great lummakin vool like I his letters?”  “I would, Gearge, I would!” cried Abel, his eyes sparkling with earnestness.  “I can teach thee thy letters, and by the time thee’s learned all I know, maybe I’ll have been to school again, and learned some more.”  This was the foundation of a curious kind of friendship between Abel and the miller’s man.  On the same shelf with the “Vamly Bible,” before alluded to, was a real old horn-book,"]]]
