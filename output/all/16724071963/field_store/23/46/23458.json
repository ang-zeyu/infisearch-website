Now, however, there is a difficulty about your making a change.”  “What is that, sir?”  “Herbert would not give his consent. The fact is, Grant, Herbert finds so much pleasure in your society, and derives so much advantage from the increased exercise you lead him to take, that I think you will have to make up your mind to stay.”  Grant's face showed the pleasure he felt.  “I shall be very glad to stay, Mr. Reynolds,” he answered, “if you are willing to have me.”  “I had this in view from the first,” said the broker, “but I wanted to see how you and Herbert got along. I wished to be sure, also, that your influence on him would be good. Of that I can have no doubt, and I am glad to receive you as a member of my family.”  There was one member of the household, however, who was not so well pleased with the proposed arrangement. This was Mrs. Estabrook, the housekeeper.  As the week drew to a close, she said, one evening after the boys had retired:  “How much longer is the office boy to stay here, Mr. Reynolds?”  “Why do you ask?” inquired the broker.  “Only with reference to domestic arrangements,” answered the housekeeper, disconcerted.  “He will remain for a considerable time, Mrs. Estabrook.”  “I--I thought he was only going to stay a week.”  “He is company for Herbert, and I think it desirable to keep him.”  “Herbert soils his clothes a deal more now than he used to do,” said the housekeeper, discontentedly. “I am sure I don't know where the other boy carries him.”  “Nor I, but I am not afraid to trust him with Grant. As to the clothes, I consider them of very small account, compared with my boy's health.”  Mrs. Estabrook knitted in silence for five minutes. She was by no means pleased with her employer's plan, having taken a dislike to Grant, for which, indeed, her chief reason was jealousy. She had a stepson, a young man of twenty-one, in Mr. Reynolds' office, whom she would like to have in the house in place of Grant. But Mr. Reynolds had never taken notice of her occasional hints to that effect. The housekeeper's plans were far-reaching. She knew that Herbert was delicate, and doubted if he would live to grow up. In that case, supposing her stepson had managed to ingratiate himself with the broker, why might he not hope to become his heir? Now this interloper, as she called Grant, had stepped into the place which her own favorite--his name was Willis Ford--should have had. Mrs. Estabrook felt aggrieved, and unjustly treated, and naturally incensed at Grant, who was the unconscious cause of her disappointment. She returned to the charge, though, had she been wiser, she would have foreborne.  “Do you think a poor boy like this Grant Thornton is a suitable companion for a rich man's son, Mr. Reynolds? Excuse me for suggesting it, but I am so interested in dear Herbert.”  “Grant Thornton is the son of a country minister, and has had an excellent training,” said the broker, coldly. “The fact that he is poor is no objection in my eyes. I think, Mrs. Estabrook, we will dismiss the subject. I think myself competent to choose my son's associates.”  “I hope you will excuse me,” said the housekeeper, seeing that she had gone too far. “I am so attached to the dear child.”  “If you are, you will not object to the extra trouble you may have with his clothes, since his health is benefited.”  “That artful young beggar has wound his way into his employer's confidence,” thought Mrs. Estabrook, resentfully, “but it may not be always so.”  A few minutes later, when the housekeeper was in her own sitting-room, she was told that Willis Ford wanted to see her.  Mrs. Estabrook's thin face lighted up with pleasure, for she was devotedly attached to her stepson.  “Bring him up here at once,” she said.  A minute later the young man entered the room. He was a thin, sallow-complexioned young man, with restless, black eyes, and a discontented expression--as of one who thinks he is not well used by the world.  “Welcome, my dear boy,” said the housekeeper, warmly. “I am so glad to see you.”  Willis submitted reluctantly to his stepmother's caress, and threw himself into a rocking chair opposite her.  “Are you well, Willis?” asked Mrs. Estabrook, anxiously.  “Yes, I'm well enough,” muttered the young man.  “I thought you looked out of sorts.”  “I feel so.”  “Is anything the matter?”  “Yes; I'm sick of working at such starvation wages.”  “I thought fifteen dollars a week a very good salary. Only last January you were raised three dollars.”  “And I expected to be raised three dollars more on the first of July.”  “Did you apply to Mr. Reynolds?”  “Yes, and he told me I must wait till next January.”  “I think he might have raised you, if only on account of the connection between our families.”  “Perhaps he would if you would ask him, mother.”  “I will when there is a good opportunity. Still, Willis, I think fifteen dollars a week very comfortable.”  “You don't know a young man's expenses, mother.”  “How much do you pay for board, Willis?”  “Six dollars a week. I have a room with a friend, or I should have to pay eight.”  “That leaves you nine dollars a week for all other expenses. I think you might save something out of that.”  “I can't. I have clothes to buy, and sometimes I want to go to the theatre, and in fact, nine dollars don't go as far as you think. Of course, a woman doesn't need to spend much. It's different with a young man.”  “Your income would be a good deal increased if you had no board to pay.”  “Of course. You don't know any generous minded person who will board me for nothing, do you?”  “There's a new office boy in your office, isn't there?”  “Yes, a country boy.”  “Did you know he was boarding here?”  “No; is he?”  “Mr. Reynolds told me to-night he was going to keep him here permanently, as a companion for his little son.”  “Lucky for him.”  “I wish Mr. Reynolds would give you a home here.”  “I would rather he would make it up in money, and let me board where I please.”  “But you forget. It would give you a chance to get him interested in you, and if Herbert should die, you might take his place as heir.”  “That would be a splendid idea, but there's no prospect of it. It isn't for me.”  “It may be for the office boy. He's an artful boy, and that's what he's working for, in my opinion.”  “I didn't think the little beggar was so evil-headed. He seems quiet enough.”  “Still waters run deep. You'd better keep an eye on him, and I'll do the same.”  “I will.”  The next day Grant was puzzled to understand why Willis Ford spoke so sharply to him, and regarded him with such evident unfriendliness.  “What have I done to offend you?” he thought.    CHAPTER XIII -- TWO VIEWS OF TOM CALDER    Thus far nothing had been said about the compensation Grant was to receive for his work in the broker's office. He did not like to ask, especially as he knew that at the end of the first week the matter would be settled. When he found that he was to remain for the present at the house of his employer he concluded that his cash pay would be very small, perhaps a dollar a week. However, that would be doing quite as well as if he paid his own board elsewhere, while he enjoyed a much more agreeable and luxurious home. He would be unable to assist his father for a year or two; but that was only what he had a right to expect.  When Saturday afternoon came, Mr. Reynolds said: “By the way, Grant, I must pay you your week's wages. I believe no sum was agreed upon.”  “No, sir.”  “We will call it six dollars. Will that be satisfactory?”  “Very much so, Mr. Reynolds; but there will be a deduction for board.”  Mr. Reynolds smiled.  “That is a different matter,” he said. “That comes to you as Herbert's companion. It is worth that to me to have my boy's happiness increased.”  Grant was overjoyed at the bright prospect opened before him, and he said, with glowing face: “You are very kind, Mr. Reynolds. Now I shall be able to help my father.”  “That is very creditable to you, my boy. Willis, you may pay Grant six dollars.”  Willis Ford did so, but he looked very glum. He estimated that, including his board, Grant would be in receipt of twelve dollars a week, or its equivalent, and this was only three dollars less than he himself received, who had been in the office five years and was a connection of the broker.  “It's a shame,” he thought, “that this green, country boy should be paid nearly as much as I--I must call and tell mother.”  Grant was a very happy boy that evening. He resolved to lay aside three dollars a week to send to his mother, to save up a dollar a week and deposit it in some savings bank, and make the other two dollars answer for his clothing and miscellaneous expenses.  On the next Monday afternoon Grant walked home alone, Mr. Reynolds having some business which delayed him. He thought he would walk up Broadway, as there was much in that crowded thoroughfare to amuse and interest him.  Just at the corner of Canal Street he came across Tom Calder. Tom was standing in a listless attitude with his hands in his pockets, with apparently no business cares weighing upon his mind.  “Hello, Grant!” he said, with sudden recognition.  “How are you, Tom?”  “I'm all right, but I'm rather hard up.”  Grant was not surprised to hear that.  “You see, there's a feller owes me seven dollars, and I can't get it till next week,” continued Tom, watching Grant's face to see if he believed it.  Grant did not believe it, but did not think it necessary to say so.  “That's inconvenient,” he remarked.  “I should say it was. You couldn't lend me a couple of dollars, could you?”  “I don't think I could.”  Tom looked disappointed.  “How much do you get?” he asked.  “Six dollars a week.”  “That's pretty good, for a boy like you. I wish you'd take a room with me. It would come cheaper.”  “I shall stay where I am for the present,” said Grant.  He did not care to mention, unless he were asked, that he was making his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5834"],["title","Bimbi: Stories for Children (#0)"],["body","Sutherland, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.    Bimbi  Stories for Children  By Louise De La Ramee       CONTENTS  THE NURNBERG STOVE THE AMBITIOUS ROSE TREE LAMPBLACK THE CHILD OF URBINO FINDELKIND     THE NURNBERG STOVE     August lived in a little town called Hall. Hall is a favorite name for several towns in Austria and in Germany; but this one especial little Hall, in the Upper Innthal, is one of the most charming Old-World places that I know, and August, for his part, did not know any other. It has the green meadows and the great mountains all about it, and the gray-green glacier-fed water rushes by it. It has paved streets and enchanting little shops that have all latticed panes and iron gratings to them; it has a very grand old Gothic church, that has the noblest blendings of light and shadow, and marble tombs of dead knights, and a look of infinite strength and repose as a church should have. Then there is the Muntze Tower, black and white, rising out of greenery, and looking down on a long wooden bridge and the broad rapid river; and there is an old schloss which has been made into a guardhouse, with battlements and frescos and heraldic devices in gold and colors, and a man-at-arms carved in stone standing life-size in his niche and bearing his date 1530. A little farther on, but close at hand, is a cloister with beautiful marble columns and tombs, and a colossal wood-carved Calvary, and beside that a small and very rich chapel; indeed, so full is the little town of the undisturbed past, that to walk in it is like opening a missal of the Middle Ages, all emblazoned and illuminated with saints and warriors, and it is so clean, and so still, and so noble, by reason of its monuments and its historic color, that I marvel much no one has ever cared to sing its praises. The old pious, heroic life of an age at once more restful and more brave than ours still leaves its spirit there, and then there is the girdle of the mountains all around, and that alone means strength, peace, majesty.  In this little town a few years ago August Strehla lived with his people in the stone-paved, irregular square where the grand church stands.  He was a small boy of nine years at that time,--a chubby-faced little man with rosy cheeks, big hazel eyes, and clusters of curls the brown of ripe nuts. His mother was dead, his father was poor, and there were many mouths at home to feed. In this country the winters are long and very cold; the whole land lies wrapped in snow for many months; and this night that he was trotting home, with a jug of beer in his numb red hands, was terribly cold and dreary. The good burghers of Hall had shut their double shutters, and the few lamps there were flickered dully behind their quaint, old-fashioned iron casings. The mountains indeed were beautiful, all snow-white under the stars that are so big in frost. Hardly any one was astir; a few good souls wending home from vespers, a tired post-boy, who blew a shrill blast from his tasseled horn as he pulled up his sledge before a hostelry, and little August hugging his jug of beer to his ragged sheepskin coat, were all who were abroad, for the snow fell heavily and the good folks of Hall go early to their beds. He could not run, or he would have spilled the beer; he was half frozen and a little frightened, but he kept up his courage by saying over and over again to himself, \"I shall soon be at home with dear Hirschvogel.\"  He went on through the streets, past the stone man-at-arms of the guardhouse, and so into the place where the great church was, and where near it stood his father Karl Strehla's house, with a sculptured Bethlehem over the doorway, and the Pilgrimage of the Three Kings painted on its wall. He had been sent on a long errand outside the gates in the afternoon, over the frozen fields and the broad white snow, and had been belated, and had thought he had heard the wolves behind him at every step, and had reached the town in a great state of terror, thankful with all his little panting heart to see the oil lamp burning under the first house shrine. But he had not forgotten to call for the beer, and he carried it carefully now, though his hands were so numb that he was afraid they would let the jug down every moment.  The snow outlined with white every gable and cornice of the beautiful old wooden houses; the moonlight shone on the gilded signs, the lambs, the grapes, the eagles, and all the quaint devices that hung before the doors; covered lamps burned before the Nativities and Crucifixions painted on the walls or let into the woodwork; here and there, where a shutter had not been closed, a ruddy fire-light lit up a homely interior, with a noisy band of children clustering round the house-mother and a big brown loaf, or some gossips spinning and listening to the cobbler's or the barber's story of a neighbor, while the oil wicks glimmered, and the hearth logs blazed, and the chestnuts sputtered in their iron roasting pot. Little August saw all these things, as he saw everything with his two big bright eyes, that had such curious lights and shadows in them; but he went needfully on his way for the sake of the beer which a single slip of the foot would make him spill. At his knock and call the solid oak door, four centuries old if one, flew open, and the boy darted in with his beer and shouted with all the force of mirthful lungs: \"Oh, dear Hirschvogel, but for the thought of you I should have died!\"  It was a large barren room into which he rushed with so much pleasure, and the bricks were bare and uneven. It had a walnut- wood press, handsome and very old, a broad deal table, and several wooden stools, for all its furniture; but at the top of the chamber, sending out warmth and color together as the lamp shed its rays upon it, was a tower of porcelain, burnished with all the hues of a king's peacock and a queen's jewels, and surmounted with armed figures, and shields, and flowers of heraldry, and a great golden crown upon the highest summit of all.  It was a stove of 1532, and on it were the letters H. R. H., for it was in every portion the handwork of the great potter of Nurnberg, Augustin Hirschvogel, who put his mark thus, as all the world knows.  The stove, no doubt, had stood in palaces and been made for princes, had warmed the crimson stockings of cardinals and the gold-broidered shoes of archduchesses, had glowed in presence- chambers and lent its carbon to help kindle sharp brains in anxious councils of state; no one knew what it had seen or done or been fashioned for; but it was a right royal thing. Yet perhaps it had never been more useful than it was now in this poor, desolate room, sending down heat and comfort into the troop of children tumbled together on a wolfskin at its feet, who received frozen August among them with loud shouts of joy.  \"Oh, dear Hirschvogel, I am so cold, so cold!\" said August, kissing its gilded lion's claws. \"Is father not in, Dorothea?\"  \"No, dear. He is late.\"  Dorothea was a girl of seventeen, dark-haired and serious, and with a sweet sad face, for she had had many cares laid on her shoulders, even whilst still a mere baby. She was the eldest of the Strehla family; and there were ten of them in all. Next to her there came Jan and Karl and Otho, big lads, gaining a little for their own living; and then came August, who went up in the summer to the high alps with the farmers' cattle, but in winter could do nothing to fill his own little platter and pot; and then all the little ones, who could only open their mouths to be fed like young birds,--Albrecht and Hilda, and Waldo and Christof, and last of all little three-year-old Ermengilda, with eyes like forget-me- nots, whose birth had cost them the life of their mother.  They were of that mixed race, half Austrian, half Italian, so common in the Tyrol; some of the children were white and golden as lilies, others were brown and brilliant as fresh fallen chestnuts. The father was a good man, but weak and weary with so many to find for and so little to do it with. He worked at the salt furnaces, and by that gained a few florins; people said he would have worked better and kept his family more easily if he had not loved his pipe and a draught of ale too well; but this had only been said of him after his wife's death, when trouble and perplexity had begun to dull a brain never too vigorous, and to enfeeble further a character already too yielding. As it was, the wolf often bayed at the door of the Strehla household, without a wolf from the mountains coming down.  Dorothea was one of those maidens who almost work miracles, so far can their industry and care and intelligence make a home sweet and wholesome and a single loaf seem to swell into twenty. The children were always clean and happy, and the table was seldom without its big pot of soup once a day. Still, very poor they were, and Dorothea's heart ached with shame, for she knew that their father's debts were many for flour and meat and clothing. Of fuel to feed the big stove they had always enough without cost, for their mother's father was alive, and sold wood and fir cones and coke, and never grudged them to his grandchildren, though he grumbled at Strehla's improvidence and hapless, dreamy ways.  \"Father says we are never to wait for him; we will have supper, now you have come home, dear,\" said Dorothea, who, however she might fret her soul in secret as she knitted their hose and mended their shirts, never let her anxieties cast a gloom on the children; only to August she did speak a little sometimes, because he was so thoughtful and so tender of her always, and knew as well as she did that there were troubles about money,--though these troubles were vague to them both, and the debtors were patient and kindly, being neighbors all in the old twisting streets between the guardhouse and the river.  Supper was a huge bowl of soup, with big slices of brown bread"]]]
