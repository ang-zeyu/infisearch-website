But on warm, and especially on dark summer nights he always appeared at his best. Then he went gaily flitting through the meadows. And sometimes he even danced right in Farmer Green's dooryard, together with a hundred or two of his nearest relations.  No one could help noticing those sprightly revelers, flashing their greenish-white lights through the gloom. And many of the field people, as well as the folk that lived in the farmhouse, thought that the dancers made a pretty sight.  But there were others who said that the Firefly family might better be spending their time in some more serious way.  Benjamin Bat, who lived in Cedar Swamp, was one of those who found fault with the merry dancers. He grumbled a good deal about them--and especially about Freddie Firefly.  \"He's so proud of that light he carries!\" Benjamin often exclaimed, \"Now, if he could hang by his feet from the limb of a tree--and SLEEP at the same time--he'd have something to boast of!\"  No doubt Benjamin Bat was jealous. Anyhow, Solomon Owl declared that there was still another reason why Benjamin did not like Freddie Firefly. Solomon claimed that Benjamin would have liked to EAT Freddie. But he didn't quite dare to grab him for fear of getting burned by Freddie's light.  If that was so, then it was no wonder that Freddie kept flashing his light in the dark. And it was lucky that he had a light, because--like Benjamin Bat himself--he was a night-prowler.  Unlike Farmer Green, Freddie believed that the night air was very healthful. And together with all his family, he thought that a damp place was much to be preferred to a dry one.  He often remarked that the pollen upon which he frequently dined tasted best when the dew was upon it. And he never could understand why Buster Bumblebee's sisters, the ill-tempered workers, always gathered nectar for their honey-making in the daytime.  \"Everyone to his own taste!\" Freddie sometimes said. \"And I suppose that those who sleep from sunset to dawn don't know what they're missing.\"  Johnnie Green, who went to bed almost as early as the Bumblebee family, couldn't help envying Freddie Firefly and all his sprightly company. Johnnie thought it must be great fun to frolic the whole night long--if only Solomon Owl wouldn't scare a person half out of his wits with that unearthly hooting of which Solomon was so fond.  But you may be sure that Freddie Firefly never bothered HIS head over Solomon Owl. Perhaps he knew that Solomon was too busy hunting for mice to take notice of anybody so small as he was, even if he did carry a bright light everywhere he went.     II  A FINE PLAN   Chirpy Cricket was one of Freddie Firefly's neighbors. He was a good neighbor for anybody to have, too, because he was one of the most cheerful of all the field and forest-folk that lived in Pleasant Valley. Freddie Firefly liked him. And he often remarked that he would rather hear Chirpy Cricket sing than sing himself.  Since he was so fond of hearing Chirpy's songs, it was lucky for Freddie that his sprightly neighbor usually chose to sing at night, when Freddie could better enjoy his shrill ditty. And Freddie frequently went out of his way on a fine, dark, summer's night to find Chirpy Cricket and thank him for his kindness.  At such times Chirpy Cricket always smiled mysteriously, saying \"I'm glad my voice pleases you.\" But it must be confessed that he was not singing for Freddie Firefly's benefit at all. He was singing for his own entertainment--and maybe to please some lady of his acquaintance as well. And he chose night time for his chirping because he didn't dare sing during the day. He knew that after sunset almost all the birds were asleep--except for Solomon Owl and Willie Whip-poor-will and a few other feathered folk who preferred the dark to the daylight. They were not so numerous that they worried Chirpy very much. But between dawn and sunset there were altogether too many birds awake to please him. Then Chirpy Cricket kept quite silent. He didn't wish to draw attention to himself by singing, because he didn't care to be gobbled up by any bird, no matter how handsome or hungry the bird might be.  Perhaps it is a wonder that Chirpy could be so cheerful as he was, living under such difficulties as he did. But on the other hand, maybe he felt so carefree at night that he couldn't help being jolly.  Anyhow, he was always ready for a good time. And if there was no good time at hand, usually Chirpy Cricket could think of some sort of frolic.  And so, at last, he hit upon the idea of a torchlight procession. Somebody had told him that Farmer Green's family had seen such a parade in the village one evening. And Chirpy Cricket saw no reason why he and his friends should not enjoy one too, right there in the shadow of Blue Mountain.  \"What they can do in the village, we can do here!\" he exclaimed. And though it was still broad daylight--being not later than the middle of the afternoon--Chirpy set out at once to find Freddie Firefly, because he simply had to get Freddie to help him.  He found Freddie in the swampy part of the meadow, near the place where the cat-tails grew. And though Freddie was a bit sleepy, he became wide awake the moment he heard Chirpy Cricket's voice.  \"I've thought of a fine plan!\" Chirpy Cricket cried. \"I'm going to have a torchlight procession and I want you and all your family to take part in it.\"     III  FREDDIE AGREES TO HELP   Never in all his life had Freddie Firefly heard of a torchlight procession--nor of any other sort of procession, either. So when Chirpy Cricket first mentioned his plan it was no wonder that Freddie looked somewhat blank.  But when Chirpy explained that a procession was a parade, which meant that you followed a leader--and a good many others--in a long line, Freddie Firefly began to understand.  \"I need you and a few hundred of your nearest relations to furnish the lights,\" Chirpy Cricket continued. \"And I wish you'd ask your whole family to take part in the procession, for we really can't have too many of you.\"  \"When will the procession take place?\" Freddie Firefly wanted to know.  \"To-night, as soon as it's dark enough!\" Chirpy told him.  \"And where are we going to march?\"  \"Oh, all around the meadow!\" said Chirpy Cricket. \"The line will form along the stone wall by the roadside. ... Do you think you'll be there?\" he inquired somewhat anxiously.  \"You certainly can count on me,\" Freddie Firefly promised. \"Of course, I can't very well accept your invitation for more than about fifty-five of my brothers--and maybe six dozen of my cousins. But I HOPE there'll be more of us than that.\"  \"Well, I hope so, too,\" Chirpy Cricket said. \"But even if there were no more than you can promise, we ought to have enough. Fifty-five and six dozen make one hundred and twenty-seven; and you make one hundred and twenty-eight.\"  \"Yes,\" replied Freddie Firefly, though he thought it would have been more polite had Chirpy Cricket counted him first instead of last, since he was the first of his family to be invited. But he really couldn't be angry with anyone so cheerful as Chirpy Cricket.  \"I'll have to leave you now,\" Chirpy announced, \"for I must be on my way. I shall have to make a great many calls before sunset, because I want to invite all my friends to join the procession. ... I'll see you later,\" he said, as he turned away.  He had not gone far before he stopped and called to Freddie Firefly.  \"Don't forget to bring your light with you to-night!\" he cautioned him.  \"I'll try not to!\" Freddie shouted. But if the truth was known, he couldn't have forgotten his light, even if he had wanted to! It was just as much a part of him as his eyes or his six legs. But Chirpy Cricket didn't seem to know that. And Freddie Firefly didn't choose to enlighten him.  Then Chirpy Cricket hurried away. He went straight to the clover field, because he wanted to ask Buster Bumblebee to take part in the torchlight procession. And Chirpy knew that the clover field was the best place to look for him, on account of Buster's being so fond of clover juice.  Reaching the field where the red clover grew, Chirpy began to hunt for the biggest blossom of them all. And when he found it, there was Buster Bumblebee, sitting on top of it and enjoying a hearty meal.  He listened, between sucks at the sweet juice, to Chirpy Cricket's invitation. He seemed interested, too.  \"What music are you going to have at your parade?\" he inquired, for Buster was very fond of music.  Chirpy Cricket replied that he hadn't thought much about that, but he said he expected to sing.  Buster Bumblebee grunted when he heard that. To tell the truth, he didn't care much for Chirpy's voice, which he considered"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5727"],["title","The Tale of Freddie Firefly (#1)"],["body","too shrill.  \"Are you going to take part in the procession?\" Chirpy asked him.  \"I'll let you know to-morrow,\" said Buster Bumblebee. \"Ah, but that will be too late!\" Chirpy cried. \"We're going to have the procession to-night.\"  \"To-night!\" Buster exclaimed. \"Then I can't come. For I shall be sound asleep right after sunset.\"     IV  GETTING READY   Buster Bumblemee's mind was made up. Although Chirpy Cricket told him it would be a shame for him to miss the torchlight procession, which was sure to be a great success, because Freddie Firefly had promised to be there with one hundred and twenty-seven of his relations, Buster still shook his head.  \"I wouldn't think of such a thing as staying out after dark!\" he declared with much firmness.  \"But you ought to see the Firefly family when they're all lighted up!\" Chirpy Cricket cried.  \"Are they as bright as the sun?\" Buster asked.  \"N-no--but they're brighter than some of the stars,\" Chirpy replied.  \"Well, I don't care if they are,\" said Buster. \"I need my rest at night. And you'll have to get along without me, though of course, I'm much obliged for the invitation.\"  Seeing that further urging was useless, Chirpy Cricket left Buster and hurried away to find Jennie Junebug. And to his delight, she said at once that she would be much pleased to attend the torchlight procession. She did wish, however, that he had invited her earlier, because she would have liked a new gown for the occasion.  \"Oh, come just as you are!\" said Chirpy Cricket.  \"What! With my apron on?\" Jennie Junebug exclaimed.  Chirpy Cricket went off laughing. Buster Bumblebee had caused him some disappointment. But now he was feeling quite cheerful again.  As he went from place to place inviting his friends to come to the torchlight procession that night, he found that a good many felt as Buster Bumblebee did. They declined to break their life-long rule of going early to bed. But there were others, such as Mr. Moses Mosquito, Kiddie Katydid, and Mehitable Moth, who said at once that they were glad he asked them and that they wouldn't miss the fun for anything.  Meanwhile Freddie Firefly was just as busy as Chirpy Cricket. And he had somewhat better luck. For not only did fifty-five of his brothers and six dozen of his cousins promise to take part in the procession--and bring their lights, too--but at least three hundred others, including some of Freddie's second and third cousins, agreed gladly to join in the evening's sport.  So before dark Freddie sent a message to Chirpy Cricket by Greenie Grasshopper, telling him that he might count on a big turnout of the Firefly family.  That was good news. And Chirpy Cricket felt so happy that he began to sing earlier in the evening than was his custom.  While it was still dusk he went to the stone wall where the procession was to form. And of course he had to wait there a long time before the first of the Firefly family appeared.  Even for a person as cheerful as Chirpy Cricket, it was hard to wait. But he consoled himself by chirping his loudest.  \"I suppose Freddie Firefly and all his relations are very busy getting their lights ready,\" he thought.  At last, when it was quite dark, Freddie Firefly lighted on a head of timothy grass close beside the stone wall and began to flash his light right in Chirpy Cricket's face.  \"Here I am, just as I promised!\" he called.     V  AT THE STONE WALL   \"Where's the rest of your crowd?\" Chirpy Cricket asked Freddie Firefly, when they met by the stone wall. \"It's getting darker every minute. And the torchlight procession ought to start right away.\"  \"They're coming,\" said Freddie. \"If you look sharp you can see them now, crossing the meadow.\"  Chirpy Cricket tried to see through the blackness of the night. After gazing steadily for a few moments he was able to make out a patch of twinkling lights, which looked a good deal like stars, except that they were too low. Since they kept growing brighter, Chirpy Cricket knew that they must be moving towards him, and that many of the Firefly family had accepted his invitation.  Soon a great host of Freddie's relations surrounded Chirpy Cricket. They flashed their lights in his eyes, so that he was almost blinded by the glare. And it was only with much difficulty that he could see Moses Mosquito, Kiddie Katydid, and Mehitable Moth, who had also arrived by that time.  \"What are we going to do?\" everybody asked Chirpy Cricket at the same time. So there was nothing he could do but mount the wall and make a speech.  \"Friends--\" he said, in his loudest voice--\"I'm glad to see so many of you present. Our torchlight procession is going to be an even greater success than the one that Farmer Green went to see in the village--if you'll only follow my directions.\"  \"We will!\" his listeners cried.  \"Please don't ask us to march after dawn breaks, for we'll be ready for bed by that time,\" Freddie Firefly interrupted.  \"I understand,\" Chirpy Cricket replied. \"And now this is what I want you all to do: you must fall in line one behind another. And when everybody's ready I'll take my place at the head of the procession and lead you all around the farm, and right past Farmer Green's window, too.\"  \"Forming a line is going to be hard work,\" somebody objected.  But Chirpy Cricket arranged that matter simply enough.  \"Just form your line along the stone wall\" he directed them. \"The wall is straight enough. And to tell the truth, that's exactly why I told Freddie that we'd meet here.\"  \"But what about Moses Mosquito and Kiddie Katydid and Mehitable Moth?\" Freddie inquired somewhat anxiously.  \"Well, what about them?\" Chirpy asked him. \"What do you mean?\"  \"They haven't brought any lights,\" Freddie pointed out. \"So what's the use of their being in the procession?\"  \"Oh, that's all right!\" Chirpy Cricket assured him. \"They're going to carry the banners.\"     VI  THE BANNERS   When Chirpy Cricket mentioned \"banners,\" Mehitable Moth, Kiddie Katydid, and Moses Mosquito stepped forward with looks of pride on their faces--so far as one could see their faces by the glimmer of the flashing lights of the Firefly family. And at the same time Freddie Firefly shouldered his way through the crowd and plucked at Chirpy Cricket's sleeve.  \"Don't you think--\" he asked earnestly--\"don't you think I ought to carry one of the banners myself?\"  \"Perhaps so!\" answered Chirpy Cricket. He was so taken aback that he really didn't know what else to say. \"Which one do you prefer?\"  \"I'd have to see them before I made a choice,\" Freddie Firefly told him in a more hopeful tone.  So Chirpy ordered Kiddie Katydid and Moses and Mehitable to produce their banners, which they had left leaning against the wall.  They brought them forth fearfully, each hoping that his--or hers--wasn't going to be taken away and handed over to Freddie Firefly to carry in the procession.  \"Here are the banners!\" Chirpy Cricket said to Freddie. \"Which one do you like best?\"  Freddie looked at the banners and read them slowly, for he was not a good reader.  The first that he examined was the one Moses Mosquito had brought. And this is what it said:  WHY FUSS ABOUT A BITE, IF IT MAKES SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPY?  \"I don't care for that one at all,\" Freddie Firefly announced. And he turned then to Kiddie Katydid's banner, which he spelled out with a good deal of trouble, because it was not so well printed.  This banner made the following announcement:  HONEST TO GOODNESS, I DIDN'T DO IT!  \"Why, I don't know what that's all about!\" Freddie exclaimed impatiently. \"Let me see the third one!\" So he looked next at the banner of Mehitable Moth, which seemed to please him better, as he read it aloud:  DON'T WORRY, MRS. GREEN! I'LL CALL AT THE FARMHOUSE BEFORE FALL.  \"That's better!\" cried Freddie Firefly. \"I'll carry this banner with a great deal of pleasure. And I can call at the farmhouse to-night--if Farmer Green's family doesn't go to bed too early.\"  But there was one difficulty about Freddie's plan. Mehitable Moth did not like to have her banner, which she had made with great pains, taken away from her like that. And she drew Chirpy Cricket to one side and began talking to him in an undertone.  Soon he turned again to Freddie Firefly, saying, \"She thinks that if you're going to carry her banner in the procession you ought to let her take your light.\"  \"Oh, I can't do that!\" Freddie exclaimed quickly. \"I wouldn't THINK of doing that!\"  \"It would be only fair, it seems to me,\" Chirpy Cricket observed.  \"Well, I won't do it, anyhow,\" Freddie declared. \"I'd stay out of the procession first. And so would all my relations, too.\"  Chirpy Cricket began to look worried. And it was no wonder. For he knew he could have no torchlight procession without the Firefly family. But pretty soon he cheered up noticeably.  \"I know what you can do!\" he announced. \"You can ride on top of Mehitable Moth's banner and keep flashing your light on it!\"     VII  THE TORCHLIGHT PARADE   At last the torchlight procession was about to begin its march. Chirpy Cricket took his place at its head, as leader. And close behind him came Mehitable Moth, gaily bearing her banner aloft, with Freddie Firefly perched on top of it, and flashing his greenish-white light so that its rays fell full upon the words, which told Farmer Green's wife not to worry, because Mehitable Moth agreed to pay her a call before cold weather set in.  It would be hard to say which was the prouder--the person under the banner or the one on top of it. Anyhow, Chirpy Cricket was prouder than both of them together, because his torchlight procession promised to be a great success.  \"Are you ready?\" he cried, looking back at the marchers, who stretched behind him in a long line beside the stone wall.  Everybody shouted \"Aye, aye, sir!\" So Chirpy Cricket pranced away across the meadow, wearing a broad smile. Probably he had never before looked quite so cheerful.  But he had not gone far before something happened that drove the smile"]]]
