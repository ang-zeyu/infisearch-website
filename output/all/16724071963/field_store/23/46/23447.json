Remember that I was young; remember that the hand which touched me was a woman's.  \"Will you promise?\"  \"Yes.\"  One word! The little familiar word that is on everybody's lips, every hour in the day.  Oh me! and I tremble, now, when I write it.  We set our faces towards London, and walked on together in the first still hour of the new day--I, and this woman, whose name, whose character, whose story, whose objects in life, whose very presence by my side, at that moment, were fathomless mysteries to me.  It was like a dream.  Was I Walter Hartright? Was this the well-known, uneventful road, where holiday people strolled on Sundays? Had I really left, little more than an hour since, the quiet, decent, conventionally domestic atmosphere of my mother's cottage? I was too bewildered--too conscious also of a vague sense of something like self-reproach--to speak to my strange companion for some minutes.  It was her voice again that first broke the silence between us.  \"I want to ask you something,\" she said suddenly.  \"Do you know many people in London?\"  \"Yes, a great many.\"  \"Many men of rank and title?\" There was an unmistakable tone of suspicion in the strange question.  I hesitated about answering it.  \"Some,\" I said, after a moment's silence.  \"Many\"--she came to a full stop, and looked me searchingly in the face--\"many men of the rank of Baronet?\"  Too much astonished to reply, I questioned her in my turn.  \"Why do you ask?\"  \"Because I hope, for my own sake, there is one Baronet that you don't know.\"  \"Will you tell me his name?\"  \"I can't--I daren't--I forget myself when I mention it.\" She spoke loudly and almost fiercely, raised her clenched hand in the air, and shook it passionately; then, on a sudden, controlled herself again, and added, in tones lowered to a whisper \"Tell me which of them YOU know.\"  I could hardly refuse to humour her in such a trifle, and I mentioned three names.  Two, the names of fathers of families whose daughters I taught; one, the name of a bachelor who had once taken me a cruise in his yacht, to make sketches for him.  \"Ah! you DON'T know him,\" she said, with a sigh of relief.  \"Are you a man of rank and title yourself?\"  \"Far from it.  I am only a drawing-master.\"  As the reply passed my lips--a little bitterly, perhaps--she took my arm with the abruptness which characterised all her actions.  \"Not a man of rank and title,\" she repeated to herself.  \"Thank God! I may trust HIM.\"  I had hitherto contrived to master my curiosity out of consideration for my companion; but it got the better of me now.  \"I am afraid you have serious reason to complain of some man of rank and title?\" I said.  \"I am afraid the baronet, whose name you are unwilling to mention to me, has done you some grievous wrong? Is he the cause of your being out here at this strange time of night?\"  \"Don't ask me: don't make me talk of it,\" she answered.  \"I'm not fit now.  I have been cruelly used and cruelly wronged.  You will be kinder than ever, if you will walk on fast, and not speak to me.  I sadly want to quiet myself, if I can.\"  We moved forward again at a quick pace; and for half an hour, at least, not a word passed on either side.  From time to time, being forbidden to make any more inquiries, I stole a look at her face. It was always the same; the lips close shut, the brow frowning, the eyes looking straight forward, eagerly and yet absently.  We had reached the first houses, and were close on the new Wesleyan college, before her set features relaxed and she spoke once more.  \"Do you live in London?\" she said.  \"Yes.\" As I answered, it struck me that she might have formed some intention of appealing to me for assistance or advice, and that I ought to spare her a possible disappointment by warning her of my approaching absence from home.  So I added, \"But to-morrow I shall be away from London for some time.  I am going into the country.\"  \"Where?\" she asked.  \"North or south?\"  \"North--to Cumberland.\"  \"Cumberland!\" she repeated the word tenderly.  \"Ah! wish I was going there too.  I was once happy in Cumberland.\"  I tried again to lift the veil that hung between this woman and me.  \"Perhaps you were born,\" I said, \"in the beautiful Lake country.\"  \"No,\" she answered.  \"I was born in Hampshire; but I once went to school for a little while in Cumberland.  Lakes? I don't remember any lakes.  It's Limmeridge village, and Limmeridge House, I should like to see again.\"  It was my turn now to stop suddenly.  In the excited state of my curiosity, at that moment, the chance reference to Mr. Fairlie's place of residence, on the lips of my strange companion, staggered me with astonishment.  \"Did you hear anybody calling after us?\" she asked, looking up and down the road affrightedly, the instant I stopped.  \"No, no.  I was only struck by the name of Limmeridge House.  I heard it mentioned by some Cumberland people a few days since.\"  \"Ah! not my people.  Mrs. Fairlie is dead; and her husband is dead; and their little girl may be married and gone away by this time.  I can't say who lives at Limmeridge now.  If any more are left there of that name, I only know I love them for Mrs. Fairlie's sake.\"  She seemed about to say more; but while she was speaking, we came within view of the turnpike, at the top of the Avenue Road.  Her hand tightened round my arm, and she looked anxiously at the gate before us.  \"Is the turnpike man looking out?\" she asked.  He was not looking out; no one else was near the place when we passed through the gate.  The sight of the gas-lamps and houses seemed to agitate her, and to make her impatient.  \"This is London,\" she said.  \"Do you see any carriage I can get? I am tired and frightened.  I want to shut myself in and be driven away.\"  I explained to her that we must walk a little further to get to a cab-stand, unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty vehicle; and then tried to resume the subject of Cumberland.  It was useless.  That idea of shutting herself in, and being driven away, had now got full possession of her mind.  She could think and talk of nothing else.  We had hardly proceeded a third of the way down the Avenue Road when I saw a cab draw up at a house a few doors below us, on the opposite side of the way.  A gentleman got out and let himself in at the garden door. I hailed the cab, as the driver mounted the box again.  When we crossed the road, my companion's impatience increased to such an extent that she almost forced me to run.  \"It's so late,\" she said.  \"I am only in a hurry because it's so late.\"  \"I can't take you, sir, if you're not going towards Tottenham Court Road,\" said the driver civilly, when I opened the cab door. \"My horse is dead beat, and I can't get him no further than the stable.\"  \"Yes, yes.  That will do for me.  I'm going that way--I'm going that way.\" She spoke with breathless eagerness, and pressed by me into the cab.  I had assured myself that the man was sober as well as civil before I let her enter the vehicle.  And now, when she was seated inside, I entreated her to let me see her set down safely at her destination.  \"No, no, no,\" she said vehemently.  \"I'm quite safe, and quite happy now.  If you are a gentleman, remember your promise.  Let him drive on till I stop him.  Thank you--oh! thank you, thank you!\"  My hand was on the cab door.  She caught it in hers, kissed it, and pushed it away.  The cab drove off at the same moment--I started into the road, with some vague idea of stopping it again, I hardly knew why--hesitated from dread of frightening and distressing her--called, at last, but not loudly enough to attract the driver's attention.  The sound of the wheels grew fainter in the distance--the cab melted into the black shadows on the road--the woman in white was gone.   Ten minutes or more had passed.  I was still on the same side of the way; now mechanically walking forward a few paces; now stopping again absently.  At one moment I found myself doubting the reality of my own adventure; at another I was perplexed and distressed by an uneasy sense of having done wrong, which yet left me confusedly ignorant of how I could have done right.  I hardly knew where I was going, or what I meant to do next; I was conscious of nothing but the confusion of my own thoughts, when I was abruptly recalled to myself--awakened, I might almost say--by the sound of rapidly approaching wheels close behind me.  I was on the dark side of the road, in the thick shadow of some garden trees, when I stopped to look round.  On the opposite and lighter side of the way, a short distance below me, a policeman was strolling along in the direction of the Regent's Park.  The carriage passed me--an open chaise driven by two men.  \"Stop!\" cried one.  \"There's a policeman.  Let's ask him.\"  The horse was instantly pulled up, a few yards beyond the dark place where I stood.  \"Policeman!\" cried the first speaker.  \"Have you seen a woman pass this way?\"  \"What sort of woman, sir?\"  \"A woman in a lavender-coloured gown----\"  \"No, no,\" interposed the second man.  \"The clothes we gave her were found on her bed.  She must have gone away in the clothes she wore when she came to us.  In white, policeman.  A woman in white.\"  \"I haven't seen her, sir.\"  \"If you or any of your men meet with the woman, stop her, and send her in careful keeping to that address.  I'll pay all expenses, and a fair reward into the bargain.\"  The policeman looked at the card that was handed down to him.  \"Why are we to stop her, sir? What has she done?\"  \"Done! She has escaped from my Asylum.  Don't forget; a woman in white. Drive on.\"    V  \"She has escaped from my Asylum!\"  I cannot say with truth that the terrible inference which those words suggested flashed upon me like a new revelation.  Some of the strange questions put to me by the woman in white, after my ill-considered promise to leave her free to act as she pleased, had suggested the conclusion either that she was naturally"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],["title","The Woman in White (#5)"],["body","and unsettled, or that some recent shock of terror had disturbed the balance of her faculties. But the idea of absolute insanity which we all associate with the very name of an Asylum, had, I can honestly declare, never occurred to me, in connection with her.  I had seen nothing, in her language or her actions, to justify it at the time; and even with the new light thrown on her by the words which the stranger had addressed to the policeman, I could see nothing to justify it now.  What had I done? Assisted the victim of the most horrible of all false imprisonments to escape; or cast loose on the wide world of London an unfortunate creature, whose actions it was my duty, and every man's duty, mercifully to control?  I turned sick at heart when the question occurred to me, and when I felt self-reproachfully that it was asked too late.  In the disturbed state of my mind, it was useless to think of going to bed, when I at last got back to my chambers in Clement's Inn.  Before many hours elapsed it would be necessary to start on my journey to Cumberland.  I sat down and tried, first to sketch, then to read--but the woman in white got between me and my pencil, between me and my book.  Had the forlorn creature come to any harm? That was my first thought, though I shrank selfishly from confronting it.  Other thoughts followed, on which it was less harrowing to dwell.  Where had she stopped the cab? What had become of her now? Had she been traced and captured by the men in the chaise? Or was she still capable of controlling her own actions; and were we two following our widely parted roads towards one point in the mysterious future, at which we were to meet once more?  It was a relief when the hour came to lock my door, to bid farewell to London pursuits, London pupils, and London friends, and to be in movement again towards new interests and a new life. Even the bustle and confusion at the railway terminus, so wearisome and bewildering at other times, roused me and did me good.    My travelling instructions directed me to go to Carlisle, and then to diverge by a branch railway which ran in the direction of the coast. As a misfortune to begin with, our engine broke down between Lancaster and Carlisle.  The delay occasioned by this accident caused me to be too late for the branch train, by which I was to have gone on immediately.  I had to wait some hours; and when a later train finally deposited me at the nearest station to Limmeridge House, it was past ten, and the night was so dark that I could hardly see my way to the pony-chaise which Mr. Fairlie had ordered to be in waiting for me.  The driver was evidently discomposed by the lateness of my arrival.  He was in that state of highly respectful sulkiness which is peculiar to English servants.  We drove away slowly through the darkness in perfect silence.  The roads were bad, and the dense obscurity of the night increased the difficulty of getting over the ground quickly.  It was, by my watch, nearly an hour and a half from the time of our leaving the station before I heard the sound of the sea in the distance, and the crunch of our wheels on a smooth gravel drive.  We had passed one gate before entering the drive, and we passed another before we drew up at the house.  I was received by a solemn man-servant out of livery, was informed that the family had retired for the night, and was then led into a large and lofty room where my supper was awaiting me, in a forlorn manner, at one extremity of a lonesome mahogany wilderness of dining-table.  I was too tired and out of spirits to eat or drink much, especially with the solemn servant waiting on me as elaborately as if a small dinner party had arrived at the house instead of a solitary man.  In a quarter of an hour I was ready to be taken up to my bedchamber.  The solemn servant conducted me into a prettily furnished room--said, \"Breakfast at nine o'clock, sir\"--looked all round him to see that everything was in its proper place, and noiselessly withdrew.  \"What shall I see in my dreams to-night?\" I thought to myself, as I put out the candle; \"the woman in white? or the unknown inhabitants of this Cumberland mansion?\" It was a strange sensation to be sleeping in the house, like a friend of the family, and yet not to know one of the inmates, even by sight!    VI  When I rose the next morning and drew up my blind, the sea opened before me joyously under the broad August sunlight, and the distant coast of Scotland fringed the horizon with its lines of melting blue.  The view was such a surprise, and such a change to me, after my weary London experience of brick and mortar landscape, that I seemed to burst into a new life and a new set of thoughts the moment I looked at it.  A confused sensation of having suddenly lost my familiarity with the past, without acquiring any additional clearness of idea in reference to the present or the future, took possession of my mind. Circumstances that were but a few days old faded back in my memory, as if they had happened months and months since.  Pesca's quaint announcement of the means by which he had procured me my present employment; the farewell evening I had passed with my mother and sister; even my mysterious adventure on the way home from Hampstead--had all become like events which might have occurred at some former epoch of my existence.  Although the woman in white was still in my mind, the image of her seemed to have grown dull and faint already.  A little before nine o'clock, I descended to the ground-floor of the house.  The solemn man-servant of the night before met me wandering among the passages, and compassionately showed me the way to the breakfast-room.  My first glance round me, as the man opened the door, disclosed a well-furnished breakfast-table, standing in the middle of a long room, with many windows in it.  I looked from the table to the window farthest from me, and saw a lady standing at it, with her back turned towards me.  The instant my eyes rested on her, I was struck by the rare beauty of her form, and by the unaffected grace of her attitude. Her figure was tall, yet not too tall; comely and well-developed, yet not fat; her head set on her shoulders with an easy, pliant firmness; her waist, perfection in the eyes of a man, for it occupied its natural place, it filled out its natural circle, it was visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays.  She had not heard my entrance into the room; and I allowed myself the luxury of admiring her for a few moments, before I moved one of the chairs near me, as the least embarrassing means of attracting her attention.  She turned towards me immediately. The easy elegance of every movement of her limbs and body as soon as she began to advance from the far end of the room, set me in a flutter of expectation to see her face clearly.  She left the window--and I said to myself, The lady is dark.  She moved forward a few steps--and I said to myself, The lady is young.  She approached nearer--and I said to myself (with a sense of surprise which words fail me to express), The lady is ugly!  Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly contradicted--never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the face and head that crowned it. The lady's complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her upper lip was almost a moustache.  She had a large, firm, masculine mouth and jaw; prominent, piercing, resolute brown eyes; and thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead.  Her expression--bright, frank, and intelligent--appeared, while she was silent, to be altogether wanting in those feminine attractions of gentleness and pliability, without which the beauty of the handsomest woman alive is beauty incomplete.  To see such a face as this set on shoulders that a sculptor would have longed to model--to be charmed by the modest graces of action through which the symmetrical limbs betrayed their beauty when they moved, and then to be almost repelled by the masculine form and masculine look of the features in which the perfectly shaped figure ended--was to feel a sensation oddly akin to the helpless discomfort familiar to us all in sleep, when we recognise yet cannot reconcile the anomalies and contradictions of a dream.  \"Mr. Hartright?\" said the lady interrogatively, her dark face lighting up with a smile, and softening and growing womanly the moment she began to speak.  \"We resigned all hope of you last night, and went to bed as usual.  Accept my apologies for our apparent want of attention; and allow me to introduce myself as one of your pupils.  Shall we shake hands? I suppose we must come to it sooner or later--and why not sooner?\"  These odd words of welcome were spoken in a clear, ringing, pleasant voice.  The offered hand--rather large, but beautifully formed--was given to me with the easy, unaffected self-reliance of a highly-bred woman.  We sat down together at the breakfast-table in as cordial and customary a manner as if we had known each other for years, and had met at Limmeridge House to talk over old times by previous appointment.  \"I hope you come here good-humouredly determined to make the best of your position,\" continued the lady.  \"You will have to begin this morning by putting up with no other company at breakfast than mine.  My sister is in her own room, nursing that essentially feminine malady, a slight headache; and her old governess, Mrs. Vesey, is charitably attending on her with restorative tea.  My uncle, Mr. Fairlie, never joins us at any of our meals: he is an invalid, and keeps bachelor state in his own apartments.  There is nobody else in the house but me. Two young ladies have been staying here, but they went away yesterday, in despair; and no wonder.  All through their visit (in consequence of Mr. Fairlie's invalid condition) we produced no such convenience in the house as a flirtable, danceable, small-talkable "]]]
