Moreover, she could again devote herself without fear to her ardently beloved art, for even honest old Appenzelder declared that he liked to listen to her, though her voice still lacked much of the overpowering magic of former days.  She was in a position, too, to gratify many a taste for whose satisfaction she had often yearned, yet she could not attain a genuine and thorough new sense of happiness.  The weeks which, a few years after her John's recognition, she spent with self-sacrificing devotion beside her husband's couch of pain, which was to become his deathbed, passed amid anxiety and grief, and when her affectionate, careful nursing proved vain, and Pyramus died, deep and sincere sorrow overpowered her.  True, he had not succeeded in winning her to return his tender love; but after he had closed his eyes she realized for the first time what a wealth of goodness and fidelity was buried with him and lost to her forever.  Her youngest boy, soon after his father's death, was torn from her by falling into a cistern, and she yielded herself to such passionate grief for his loss that she thought she could never conquer it; but it was soon soothed by the belief that, for the sake of this devout child, whose training for a religious life had already commenced, Heaven had resigned its claims upon John, and that the boy was dwelling in the immediate presence of the Queen of Heaven.  Thus, ere she was aware of it, her burning anguish changed into a cheerful remembrance.  Earlier still--more than two years after Wolf's departure--tidings closely associated with the sorrow inflicted through her John had saddened her.  The ship which was to bear the loyal companion of her youth to Spain was wrecked just before the end of the voyage, and Wolf went down with it.  Barbara learned the news only by accident, and his death first made her realize with full distinctness how dear he had been to her.  The letter which she had addressed to her son was lost with the man in whom Fate had wrested from her the last friend who would have been able and willing to show her John clearly and kindly a correct picture of his mother's real character.  For two years she had hoped that Wolf would complete her letter in his own person, and tell her son how her voice and her beauty had won his father's heart.  Quijada had known it; but if he spoke of her to his wife and foster-son, it was scarcely in her favour--he cared little for music and singing.  So the loss of this letter seemed to her, with reason, a severe misfortune.  What she now wrote to John could hardly exert much influence upon him.  Yet she did write, this time with the aid of Hannibal.  But the new letter, which began with thanks for the financial aid which the son had conferred upon his mother through his royal brother, was distasteful both to her pride and her maternal affection.  Half prosaic, half far too effusive, it gave a distorted idea of her real feelings, and she tore it up before giving it to the messenger.  Yet she did not cease to hope that, in some favourable hour, the heart of the idol of her soul would urge him to approach his mother; but year after year elapsed without bringing her even the slightest token of his remembrance, and this omission was the bitter drop that spoiled the happiness which, after the death of her youngest boy, was clouded by no outward event.  When at last she addressed herself to John in a third letter, which this time she dictated to Hannibal as her heart prompted, she received an answer, it is true, though not from him, but from Dona Magdalena.  In kind words this lady urged her not to write to \"her\"--Dona Magdalena's--son in future.  She had taught him to think of the woman who bore him with fitting respect, but it would be impossible for him to maintain the relation with her.  She must spare her the explanation of the reasons which made this appear to be an obstacle to his career. Don John would prove in the future, by his care for her prosperity and comfort, that he did not forget her.  She had no right, it is true, to counsel her; but when she transported herself into the soul of the woman who had enjoyed the love of the Emperor Charles, and on whom Heaven had bestowed a son like John of Austria, she felt sure that this woman would act wisely and promote her real welfare if she preferred communion with her Saviour, in the quiet of a cloister, to the bustle of life amid surroundings which certainly were far too humble for her.  Barbara felt wounded to the inmost depths of her being by this letter. Had the officious adviser, who had certainly despatched the reply without her son's knowledge, been within her reach, she would have showed her how little inclination she felt to be patronized by the person who, after alienating the son's heart from his mother, even presumed to dictate to her to rob herself of her last claim upon his regard.  True, in one respect she agreed with the writer of the letter.  Precisely because it appeared as if Heaven had accepted her sacrifice and the grandeur for which she had made it seemed to be awaiting her son, she ought to attempt nothing that might impede his climbing to the height, and her open connection with him might easily have placed stones in his path.  His elevation depended upon King Philip, whose boundless pride had gazed at her from his chilling face.  So she resolved to make no more advances to her child until the day came --and a voice within told her that come it must--when he himself longed for his own mother.  Meanwhile she would be content with the joy of watching his brilliant course from the distance.  The miracles which she had anticipated and prayed for in his behalf were accomplished.  First, she heard that Count Ribadavia's splendid palace would be prepared for her son, that the sons of noble families would be assigned to attend him, and that a body-guard of Spaniards and Germans and a train of his own were at his command.  Then she learned in what a remarkable manner Elizabeth of Valois, the King's new wife, favoured the lad of thirteen.  At the taking of the oath by which the Cortes recognised Don Carlos as the heir to the throne, John had been summoned directly after the Infant as the first person entitled to homage.  Next, she learned that he had entered the famous University of Alcala de Henares.  And his classmates and friends?  They were no less important personages than Don Carlos himself and Alessandro Farnese, John's nephew, the son of that Ottavio at whose admission as Knight of the Golden Fleece Barbara had made at Landshut the most difficult resolution of her life.  He was said to share everything with these distinguished companions, and to be himself the handsomest and most attractive of the illustrious trio. He was particularly inseparable from Alessandro, the son of the woman now ruling as regent in Brussels, who was John's sister.  What reply would he have made to this illustrious scion of one of the most ancient and noble royal races if a letter from her had reached him, and the duke's son had asked, \"Who is this Frau Barbara Blomberg?\" or, as she now signed herself, \"Madame de Blomberg\"?  The answer must have been: \"My mother.\"  Oh, no, no, never!  It would have been cruel to expect this from him; never would she place her beloved child, her pride, her joy, in so embarrassing a position.  Besides, though she could only watch him from a distance, thanks to his generosity or his brother's, she could lead a pleasant life.  To sun herself in his glory, too, was sufficiently cheering, and must satisfy her.  He spent three years at the University of Aleala, and nothing but good news of him reached her.  Then she received tidings which gave her special joy, for one of the wishes she had formed in Landshut was fulfilled.  He had been made a Knight of the Golden Fleece, and how becoming the jewel on the red ribbon must be to the youth of one-and- twenty!  How many of her acquaintances belonging to the partisans of the King and Spain came to congratulate her upon it!  Because John had become Spanish, and risen in Spain to the position which she desired for him, she wished to become so, and studied the Spanish language with the zeal and industry of a young girl.  She succeeded in gaining more and more knowledge of it, and, finally, through intercourse with Spaniards, in mastering it completely.  At that time the prospects for her party were certainly gloomy; the heretical agitation and the boldness of the rebellious enthusiasts for independence and liberty surpassed all bounds.  The King therefore sent the Duke of Alba to the Netherlands to restore order, and, with the twenty thousand men he commanded, make the insurgents feel the resistless power of offended majesty and the angered Church.  Barbara and her friends greeted the stern duke as a noble champion of the faith, who was resolved to do his utmost.  The new bishoprics, which by Granvelle's advice had been established, the foreign soldiers, and the Spanish Inquisition, which pursued the heretics with inexorable harshness, had roused the populace to unprecedented turmoil, and induced them to resist the leading nobles, who were indebted to the King for great favours, to the intense wrath of these aristocrats and the partisans of Spain.  Barbara, with all her party, had welcomed the new bishoprics as an arrangement which promised many blessings, and the foreign troops seemed to her necessary to maintain order in the rebellious Netherlands.  The cruelty of the Inquisition was only intended to enforce respect for the edicts which the Emperor Charles, in his infallible wisdom, had issued, and the hatred which the nobles, especially, displayed against Granvelle, Barbara's kind patron, the greatest statesman of his time and the most loyal servant of his King, seemed to her worthy of the utmost condemnation.  The scorn with which the rebels, after the compromise signed by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5570"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 10 (#5)"],["body"," highest nobles, had called themselves Geusen, or Beggars, and endangered repose, would have been worthy of the severest punishment.  What induced these people to risk money and life for privileges which a wise policy of the government--this was the firm conviction of those who shared Barbara's views--could not possibly grant, was incomprehensible to her, and she watched the course of the rebels with increasing aversion.  Did they suppose their well-fed magistrates and solemn States-General, who never looked beyond their own city and country, would govern them better than the far-sighted wisdom of a Granvelle or the vast intellect of a Viglius, which comprised all the knowledge of the world?  What they called their liberties were privileges which a sovereign bestowed.  Ought they to wonder if another monarch, whom they had deeply angered, did not regard them as inviolable gifts of God?  The quiet comfort of former days had been clouded, nay, destroyed, by these patriots.  Peace could be restored only by the King's silencing them. So she wished the Spaniards a speedy success, and detested the efforts of independent minds; above all, of William of Orange, their only too clear- sighted, cautious, devoted leader, also skilled in the arts of dissimulation, in whom she recognised the most dangerous foe of Spanish sovereignty and the unity of the Church.  When, by the Duke of Alba's orders, the Counts Egmont and Horn were executed one June day in the market place of Brussels, opinions, even of members of the Spanish party, were divided, especially as Count Egmont was a Catholic, and had acted finally according to the views of the government.  Barbara sincerely lamented his terrible end, for she had seen in him a brilliant model for her John.  In hours of depression, the sudden fall of this favourite of the people seemed like an evil omen.  But she would not let these disquieting thoughts gain power over her, for she wished at last to enjoy life and, as the mother of such a son, felt entitled to do so.  She regarded this cruel deed of Alba as a false step at any rate, for, though she kept so far aloof from the Netherland burghers and common people, she perceived what deep indignation this measure aroused.  Meanwhile the Prince of Orange, the spirit and soul of this execrable rebellion, had escaped the sentence of the court.  Nevertheless, she regarded Alba with great admiration, for he was a man of ability, whom the Emperor Charles had held in high esteem.  Besides, after her husband's death the haughty noble had been courteous enough to assure her of his sympathy.  Moreover, a time was just approaching in which she withdrew too far from this conflict to follow it with full attention, for her son's first deed of heroism became known in Brussels.  The King had appointed John to the command of the fleet, and sent him against the pirates upon the African coast.  He could now gather his first laurels, and to do everything in her power for the success of his arms, Barbara spent the greater portion of her time in church, praying devoutly.  In September he was greeted in Madrid as a conqueror, but her joy was not unclouded; for the Infant Don Carlos had yielded up his young life in July as a prisoner, and she believed him to be her John's best friend, and lamented his death because she thought that it would grieve her hero son.  But this little cloud soon vanished, and how brilliantly the blue sky arched above her the next year, when she learned that Don John of Austria had received the honourable commission of crushing the rebellion of the infidel Moriscoes in Andalusia!  Here her royal son first proved himself a glorious military hero, and his deeds at the siege of Galera and before Seron filled her maternal heart with inexpressible pride.  The words which he shouted to his retreating men: \"Do you call yourselves Spaniards and not know what honour means?  What have you to fear when I am with you?\" echoed in her ears like the most beautiful melody which she had ever sting or heard.  Yet a dark shadow fell on these radiant joys also; her John's friend and foster-father, Don Luis Quijada, had been wounded in these battles, and died from his injuries.  Barbara felt what deep pain this would cause her distant son, and expressed her sympathy to him in a letter.  But the greatest happiness was still in store for her and for him.  On the 7th of October, 1571, the young hero, now twenty-four years old, as commander of the united fleets of Spain, Venice, and the Pope, gained the greatest victory which any Castilian force had ever won over the troops of the infidels.  Instead of the name received at his baptism, and the one which he owed to his brother, that of Victor of Lepanto now adorned him.  Not one of all the generals in the world received honours even distantly approaching those lavished upon him.  And besides the leonine courage and talent for command which he had displayed, his noble nature was praised with ardent enthusiasm.  How he had showed it in the distribution of the booty to the widow of the Turkish high admiral Ali Pasha!  This renowned Moslem naval commander had fallen in the battle, and his two sons had been delivered to Don John as prisoners.  When the unfortunate mother entreated him to release the boys for a large ransom, he restored one to her love with the companions for whose liberty he had interceded, with a letter containing the words, \"It does not beseem me to keep your presents, since my rank and birth require me to give, not to receive.\"  These noble words were written by Barbara Blomberg's son, the boy to whom she gave birth, and who had now become just what her lofty soul desired.  After the conquest of Cyprus, the Crescent had seriously threatened the Cross in the Mediterranean, and it was Don John who had broken the power of the Turks.  Alas, that her father could not have lived to witness this exploit of his grandson!  What a happy man the victory of Lepanto, gained by his \"Wawerl's\" son, would have made him!  How the fearless old champion of the faith would have rejoiced in this grandchild, his deeds, and nature!  And what honours were bestowed upon her John!  King Philip wrote to him, \"Next to God, gratitude for what has been accomplished is due to you.\"  A statue was erected to him in Messina. The Pope had used the words of Scripture, \"There was a man sent by God, and his name was John.\"  Now, yes, now she was more than rewarded for the sacrifice of Landshut; now the splendour and grandeur for which she had longed and prayed was far, far exceeded.  This time it was gratitude, fervent gratitude, which detained her in church.  The child of her love, her suffering, her pride, was now happy, must be happy.  When, two years later, Don John captured Tunis, the exploit could no longer increase his renown.  At this time also happened many things which filled the heart of a woman so closely connected with royalty sometimes with joy, sometimes with anxiety.  In Paris, the night of St. Bartholomew, a year after her son had chastised the Moslems at Lepanto, dealt the French heretics a deep, almost incurable wound, and in the Netherlands there were not gallows enough to hang the misguided fanatics.  Yet this rebellious nation did not cease to cause the King unspeakable difficulties and orthodox Christians sorrow.  On the sea the \"Beggars\" conquered his Majesty's war ships; Haarlem, it is true, had been forced by the Spanish troops to surrender, but what terrible sacrifices the siege had cost where women had taken part in the defence with the courage of men!  And, in spite of everything, Alba's harshness had been futile.  Then Philip recalled him and put in his place the gentle Don Luis de Requesens, who had been governor in Milan.  He would willingly have made peace with the people bleeding from a thousand wounds, but how could he concede the toleration of the heretical faith and the withdrawal of the troops on which he relied?  And how did the rebels show their gratitude to him for his kindness and good will?  The Beggars destroyed his fleet, and, though the brother of William of Orange had been defeated upon the Mooker-Heide, this by no means disheartened the enraged nation, resolved upon extremes, and their silent but wise and tireless leader.  In Leyden the obstinacy of the foes of the King and the Church showed itself in a way to which even Barbara and her party could not deny a certain degree of admiration.  True, the nature of the country aided the rebels like an ally.  Mortal warriors could not contend against wind and storm.  But he who from without directed the defence here, who had issued the order to break through the dikes, and then with shameful effrontery had founded in the scarcely rescued city a university which was to nurture the spirit of resistance in the minds of the young men, was again the Prince of Orange; and who else than he, his shrewdness and firmness, robbed Requesens of gratitude for his mildness and the success of his honest labours?  But how much easier was the part of the leader of the enemy, who in Brussels had escaped the fate of Egmont, than the King's kindly disposed governor!  When Barbara chanced to hear the men of the people talking with each other, and they spoke of \"Father William,\" they meant the Prince of Orange; and with what abuse, both verbally and in handbills, King Philip and the Spanish Government were loaded!  To Barbara, as well as to the members of her party, William of Orange, whom she often heard called the \"Antichrist\" and \"rebel chief,\" was an object of hatred.  Now he frustrated the kind Requesens's attempt at mediation, and it was also his fault that two provinces had publicly revolted from the Holy Church.  The Protestant worship of God was now exercised as freely there as in Ratisbon.  Like William of Orange, most of the citizens professed the doctrine of Calvin, but there was no lack of Lutherans, and the clergyman whose sermons attracted the"]]]
