Just so!\" said Mr. Fairlie, consulting the tablettes. \"Louis, take down that portfolio.\" He pointed, as he spoke, to several portfolios placed near the window, on mahogany stands. \"No.  Not the one with the green back--that contains my Rembrandt etchings, Mr. Hartright.  Do you like etchings? Yes? So glad we have another taste in common.  The portfolio with the red back, Louis.  Don't drop it! You have no idea of the tortures I should suffer, Mr. Hartright, if Louis dropped that portfolio.  Is it safe on the chair? Do YOU think it safe, Mr. Hartright? Yes? So glad.  Will you oblige me by looking at the drawings, if you really think they are quite safe.  Louis, go away. What an ass you are.  Don't you see me holding the tablettes? Do you suppose I want to hold them? Then why not relieve me of the tablettes without being told? A thousand pardons, Mr. Hartright; servants are such asses, are they not? Do tell me--what do you think of the drawings? They have come from a sale in a shocking state--I thought they smelt of horrid dealers' and brokers' fingers when I looked at them last.  CAN you undertake them?\"  Although my nerves were not delicate enough to detect the odour of plebeian fingers which had offended Mr. Fairlie's nostrils, my taste was sufficiently educated to enable me to appreciate the value of the drawings, while I turned them over.  They were, for the most part, really fine specimens of English water-colour art; and they had deserved much better treatment at the hands of their former possessor than they appeared to have received.  \"The drawings,\" I answered, \"require careful straining and mounting; and, in my opinion, they are well worth----\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" interposed Mr. Fairlie.  \"Do you mind my closing my eyes while you speak? Even this light is too much for them.  Yes?\"  \"I was about to say that the drawings are well worth all the time and trouble----\"  Mr. Fairlie suddenly opened his eyes again, and rolled them with an expression of helpless alarm in the direction of the window.  \"I entreat you to excuse me, Mr. Hartright,\" he said in a feeble flutter.  \"But surely I hear some horrid children in the garden--my private garden--below?\"  \"I can't say, Mr. Fairlie.  I heard nothing myself.\"  \"Oblige me--you have been so very good in humouring my poor nerves--oblige me by lifting up a corner of the blind.  Don't let the sun in on me, Mr. Hartright! Have you got the blind up? Yes? Then will you be so very kind as to look into the garden and make quite sure?\"  I complied with this new request.  The garden was carefully walled in, all round.  Not a human creature, large or small, appeared in any part of the sacred seclusion.  I reported that gratifying fact to Mr. Fairlie.  \"A thousand thanks.  My fancy, I suppose.  There are no children, thank Heaven, in the house; but the servants (persons born without nerves) will encourage the children from the village.  Such brats--oh, dear me, such brats! Shall I confess it, Mr. Hartright?--I sadly want a reform in the construction of children.  Nature's only idea seems to be to make them machines for the production of incessant noise.  Surely our delightful Raffaello's conception is infinitely preferable?\"  He pointed to the picture of the Madonna, the upper part of which represented the conventional cherubs of Italian Art, celestially provided with sitting accommodation for their chins, on balloons of buff-coloured cloud.  \"Quite a model family!\" said Mr. Fairlie, leering at the cherubs. \"Such nice round faces, and such nice soft wings, and--nothing else.  No dirty little legs to run about on, and no noisy little lungs to scream with.  How immeasurably superior to the existing construction! I will close my eyes again, if you will allow me. And you really can manage the drawings? So glad.  Is there anything else to settle? if there is, I think I have forgotten it. Shall we ring for Louis again?\"  Being, by this time, quite as anxious, on my side, as Mr. Fairlie evidently was on his, to bring the interview to a speedy conclusion, I thought I would try to render the summoning of the servant unnecessary, by offering the requisite suggestion on my own responsibility.  \"The only point, Mr. Fairlie, that remains to be discussed,\" I said, \"refers, I think, to the instruction in sketching which I am engaged to communicate to the two young ladies.\"  \"Ah! just so,\" said Mr. Fairlie.  \"I wish I felt strong enough to go into that part of the arrangement--but I don't.  The ladies who profit by your kind services, Mr. Hartright, must settle, and decide, and so on, for themselves.  My niece is fond of your charming art.  She knows just enough about it to be conscious of her own sad defects.  Please take pains with her.  Yes.  Is there anything else? No.  We quite understand each other--don't we? I have no right to detain you any longer from your delightful pursuit--have I? So pleasant to have settled everything--such a sensible relief to have done business.  Do you mind ringing for Louis to carry the portfolio to your own room?\"  \"I will carry it there myself, Mr. Fairlie, if you will allow me.\"  \"Will you really? Are you strong enough? How nice to be so strong! Are you sure you won't drop it? So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr. Hartright.  I am such a sufferer that I hardly dare hope to enjoy much of your society.  Would you mind taking great pains not to let the doors bang, and not to drop the portfolio? Thank you.  Gently with the curtains, please--the slightest noise from them goes through me like a knife.  Yes. GOOD morning!\"  When the sea-green curtains were closed, and when the two baize doors were shut behind me, I stopped for a moment in the little circular hall beyond, and drew a long, luxurious breath of relief. It was like coming to the surface of the water after deep diving, to find myself once more on the outside of Mr. Fairlie's room.  As soon as I was comfortably established for the morning in my pretty little studio, the first resolution at which I arrived was to turn my steps no more in the direction of the apartments occupied by the master of the house, except in the very improbable event of his honouring me with a special invitation to pay him another visit.  Having settled this satisfactory plan of future conduct in reference to Mr. Fairlie, I soon recovered the serenity of temper of which my employer's haughty familiarity and impudent politeness had, for the moment, deprived me. The remaining hours of the morning passed away pleasantly enough, in looking over the drawings, arranging them in sets, trimming their ragged edges, and accomplishing the other necessary preparations in anticipation of the business of mounting them.  I ought, perhaps, to have made more progress than this; but, as the luncheon-time drew near, I grew restless and unsettled, and felt unable to fix my attention on work, even though that work was only of the humble manual kind.  At two o'clock I descended again to the breakfast-room, a little anxiously.  Expectations of some interest were connected with my approaching reappearance in that part of the house.  My introduction to Miss Fairlie was now close at hand; and, if Miss Halcombe's search through her mother's letters had produced the result which she anticipated, the time had come for clearing up the mystery of the woman in white.    VIII  When I entered the room, I found Miss Halcombe and an elderly lady seated at the luncheon-table.  The elderly lady, when I was presented to her, proved to be Miss Fairlie's former governess, Mrs. Vesey, who had been briefly described to me by my lively companion at the breakfast-table, as possessed of \"all the cardinal virtues, and counting for nothing.\" I can do little more than offer my humble testimony to the truthfulness of Miss Halcombe's sketch of the old lady's character.  Mrs. Vesey looked the personification of human composure and female amiability.  A calm enjoyment of a calm existence beamed in drowsy smiles on her plump, placid face.  Some of us rush through life, and some of us saunter through life. Mrs. Vesey SAT through life.  Sat in the house, early and late; sat in the garden; sat in unexpected window-seats in passages; sat (on a camp-stool) when her friends tried to take her out walking; sat before she looked at anything, before she talked of anything, before she answered Yes, or No, to the commonest question--always with the same serene smile on her lips, the same vacantly-attentive turn of the head, the same snugly-comfortable position of her hands and arms, under every possible change of domestic circumstances.  A mild, a compliant, an unutterably tranquil and harmless old lady, who never by any chance suggested the idea that she had been actually alive since the hour of her birth.  Nature has so much to do in this world, and is engaged in generating such a vast variety of co-existent productions, that she must surely be now and then too flurried and confused to distinguish between the different processes that she is carrying on at the same time. Starting from this point of view, it will always remain my private persuasion that Nature was absorbed in making cabbages when Mrs. Vesey was born, and that the good lady suffered the consequences of a vegetable preoccupation in the mind of the Mother of us all.  \"Now, Mrs. Vesey,\" said Miss Halcombe, looking brighter, sharper, and readier than ever, by contrast with the undemonstrative old lady at her side, \"what will you have? A cutlet?\"  Mrs. Vesey crossed her dimpled hands on the edge of the table, smiled placidly, and said, \"Yes, dear.\"  \"What is that opposite Mr. Hartright? Boiled chicken, is it not? I thought you liked boiled chicken better than cutlet, Mrs. Vesey?\"  Mrs. Vesey took her dimpled hands off the edge of the table and crossed them on her lap instead; nodded contemplatively at the boiled chicken, and said, \"Yes, dear.\"  \"Well, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5830"],["title","A Garland for Girls (#0)"],["body","Team         A GARLAND FOR GIRLS  By Louisa May Alcott    TO R.A.

If my girls find a little beauty or sunshine in these common blossoms, their old friend will not have made her Garland in vain.  L.M. ALCOTT.  SEPTEMBER, 1887.     MAY FLOWERS   Being Boston girls, of course they got up a club for mental improvement, and, as they were all descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers, they called it the Mayflower Club. A very good name, and the six young girls who were members of it made a very pretty posy when they met together, once a week, to sew, and read well-chosen books. At the first meeting of the season, after being separated all summer, there was a good deal of gossip to be attended to before the question, “What shall we read?” came up for serious discussion.  Anna Winslow, as president, began by proposing “Happy Dodd;” but a chorus of “I've read it!” made her turn to her list for another title.  “'Prisoners of Poverty' is all about workingwomen, very true and very sad; but Mamma said it might do us good to know something of the hard times other girls have,” said Anna, soberly; for she was a thoughtful creature, very anxious to do her duty in all ways.  “I'd rather not know about sad things, since I can't help to make them any better,” answered Ella Carver, softly patting the apple blossoms she was embroidering on a bit of blue satin.  “But we might help if we really tried, I suppose; you know how much Happy Dodd did when she once began, and she was only a poor little girl without half the means of doing good which we have,” said Anna, glad to discuss the matter, for she had a little plan in her head and wanted to prepare a way for proposing it.  “Yes, I'm always saying that I have more than my share of fun and comfort and pretty things, and that I ought and will share them with some one. But I don't do it; and now and then, when I hear about real poverty, or dreadful sickness, I feel so wicked it quite upsets me. If I knew HOW to begin, I really would. But dirty little children don't come in my way, nor tipsy women to be reformed, nor nice lame girls to sing and pray with, as it all happens in books,”  cried Marion Warren, with such a remorseful expression on her merry round face that her mates laughed with one accord.  “I know something that I COULD do if I only had the courage to begin it. But Papa would shake his head unbelievingly, and Mamma worry about its being proper, and it would interfere with my music, and everything nice that I especially wanted to go to would be sure to come on whatever day I set for my good work, and I should get discouraged or ashamed, and not half do it, so I don't begin, but I know I ought.” And Elizabeth Alden rolled her large eyes from one friend to another, as if appealing to them to goad her to this duty by counsel and encouragement of some sort.  “Well, I suppose it's right, but I do perfectly hate to go poking round among poor folks, smelling bad smells, seeing dreadful sights, hearing woful tales, and running the risk of catching fever, and diphtheria, and horrid things. I don't pretend to like charity, but say right out I'm a silly, selfish wretch, and want to enjoy every minute, and not worry about other people. Isn't it shameful?”  Maggie Bradford looked such a sweet little sinner as she boldly made this sad confession, that no one could scold her, though Ida Standish, her bosom friend, shook her head, and Anna said, with a sigh: “I'm afraid we all feel very much as Maggie does, though we don't own it so honestly. Last spring, when I was ill and thought I might die, I was so ashamed of my idle, frivolous winter, that I felt as if I'd give all I had to be able to live it over and do better. Much is not expected of a girl of eighteen, I know; but oh! there were heaps of kind little things I MIGHT have done if I hadn't thought only of myself. I resolved if I lived I'd try at least to be less selfish, and make some one happier for my being in the world. I tell you, girls, it's rather solemn when you lie expecting to die, and your sins come up before you, even though they are very small ones. I never shall forget it, and after my lovely summer I mean to be a better girl, and lead a better life if I can.”  Anna was so much in earnest that her words, straight out of a very innocent and contrite heart, touched her hearers deeply, and put them into the right mood to embrace her proposition. No one spoke for a moment, then Maggie said quietly,--  “I know what it is. I felt very much so when the horses ran away, and for fifteen minutes I sat clinging to Mamma, expecting to be killed. Every unkind, undutiful word I'd ever said to her came back to me, and was worse to bear than the fear of sudden death. It scared a great deal of naughtiness out of me, and dear Mamma and I have been more to each other ever since.”  “Let us begin with 'The Prisoners of Poverty,' and perhaps it will show us something to do,” said Lizzie. “But I must say I never felt as if shop-girls needed much help; they generally seem so contented with themselves, and so pert or patronizing to us, that I don't pity them a bit, though it must be a hard life.”  “I think we can't do MUCH in that direction, except set an example of good manners when we go shopping. I wanted to propose that we each choose some small charity for this winter, and do it faithfully. That will teach us how to do more by and by, and we can help one another with our experiences, perhaps, or amuse with our failures. What do you say?” asked Anna, surveying her five friends with a persuasive smile.  “What COULD we do?”  “People will call us goody-goody.”  “I haven't the least idea how to go to work.”  “Don't believe Mamma will let me.”  “We'd better change our names from May Flowers to sisters of charity, and wear meek black bonnets and flapping cloaks.”  Anna received these replies with great composure, and waited for the meeting to come to order, well knowing that the girls would have their fun and outcry first, and then set to work in good earnest.  “I think it's a lovely idea, and I'll carry out my plan. But I won't tell what it is yet; you'd all shout, and say I couldn't do it, but if you were trying also, that would keep me up to the mark,” said Lizzie, with a decided snap of her scissors, as she trimmed the edges of a plush case for her beloved music.  “Suppose we all keep our attempts secret, and not let our right hand know what the left hand does? It's such fun to mystify people, and then no one can laugh at us. If we fail, we can say nothing; if we succeed, we can tell of it and get our reward. I'd like that way, and will look round at once for some especially horrid boot-black, ungrateful old woman, or ugly child, and devote myself to him, her, or it with the patience of a saint,” cried Maggie, caught by the idea of doing good in secret and being found out by accident.  The other girls agreed, after some discussion, and then Anna took the floor again.  “I propose that we each work in our own way till next May, then, at our last meeting, report what we have done, truly and honestly, and plan something better for next year. Is it a vote?”  It evidently was a unanimous vote, for five gold thimbles went up, and five blooming faces smiled as the five girlish voices cried, “Aye!”  “Very well, now let us decide what to read, and begin at once. I think the 'Prisoners' a good book, and we shall doubtless get some hints from it.”  So they began, and for an hour one pleasant voice after the other read aloud those sad, true stories of workingwomen and their hard lives, showing these gay young creatures what their pretty clothes cost the real makers of them, and how much injustice, suffering, and wasted strength went into them. It was very sober reading, but most absorbing; for the crochet needles went slower and slower, the lace-work lay idle, and a great tear shone like a drop of dew on the apple blossoms as Ella listened to “Rose's Story.” They skipped the statistics, and dipped here and there as each took her turn; but when the two hours were over, and it was time for the club to adjourn, all the members were deeply interested in that pathetic book, and more in earnest than before; for this glimpse into other lives showed them how much help was needed, and made them anxious to lend a hand.  “We can't do much, being 'only girls,'” said Anna; “but if each does one small chore somewhere it will pave the way for better work; so we will all try, at least, though it seems like so many ants trying to move a mountain.”  “Well, ants build nests higher than a man's head in Africa; you remember the picture of them in our old geographies? And we can do as much, I'm sure, if each tugs her pebble or straw faithfully. I shall shoulder mine to-morrow if Mamma is willing,” answered Lizzie, shutting up her work-bag as if she had her resolution inside and was afraid it might evaporate before she got home.  “I shall stand on the Common, and proclaim aloud, 'Here's a nice young missionary, in want of a job! Charity for sale cheap! Who'll buy? who'll buy?'” said Maggie, with a resigned expression, and a sanctimonious twang to her voice.  “I shall wait and see what comes to me, since I don't know what I'm fit for;” and Marion gazed out of the window as if expecting to see some interesting pauper waiting for her to appear.  “I shall ask Miss Bliss for advice; she knows all about the poor, and will give me a good start,” added prudent Ida, who resolved to do nothing rashly lest she should fail.  “I shall "]]]
