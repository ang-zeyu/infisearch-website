If the treasure should be found--as it might be--somewhere hidden on that little plot of ground with a palace on it on our side of the river, our problem would be fairly easy. There'd be some way of--ah--making sure the fund would be properly administered.  But if Gungadhura found it in the hills, and kept quiet about it as he doubtless would, he'd have every sedition-monger in India in his pay within a year, and the consequences might be very serious.\"  \"Who is the other man--the one the British didn't choose?\" asked Tess.  \"A very decent chap named Utirupa--quite a sportsman.  He was thought too young at the time the selection was made;  but he knew enough to get out of the reach of the new maharajah immediately.  They have a phrase here, you know, 'to hate like cousins.'  They're rather remote cousins, but they hate all the more for that.\"  \"So you'd rather that the treasure stayed buried?\"  \"Not exactly.  But he tossed ash from the end of his cigar to illustrate offhandedness.  \"I think I could promise ten per cent. of it to whoever brought us exact information of its whereabouts before the maharajah could lay his hands on it.\"  \"I'll tell that to my husband.\"  \"Do.\"  \"Of course, being in a way in partnership with Gungadhura, he might--\"  \"Let me give you one word of caution, if I may without offense.  We-- our government--wouldn't recognize the right of--of any one to take that treasure out of the country.  Ten per cent. would be the maximum, and that only in case of accurate information brought in time to us.\"  \"Aren't findings keepings?  Isn't possession nine points of the law?\" laughed Tess.  \"In certain cases, yes.  But not where government knows of the existence somewhere of a hoard of public funds--an enormous hoard--it must run into millions.\"  \"Then, if the maharajah should find it would you take it from him?\"  \"No.  We would put the screws on, and force him to administer the fund properly if we knew about it.  But he'd never tell.\"  \"Then how d'you know he hasn't found the stuff already?\"  \"Because many of his personal bills aren't paid, and the political stormy petrels are not yet heading his way.  He's handicapped by not being able to hunt for it openly.  Some ill-chosen confidant might betray the find to us.  I doubt if he trusts more than one or two people at a time.\"  \"It must be hell to be a maharajah!\" Tess burst out after a minute's silence.  \"It's sometimes hell to be commissioner, Mrs. Blaine.\"  \"If I were Gungadhura I'd find that money or bust!  And when I'd found it--\"  \"You'd endow an orphan asylum, eh?\"  \"I'd make such trouble for you English that you'd be glad to leave me in peace for a generation!\"  Samson laughed good-naturedly and twisted up the end of his mustache.  \"Pon my soul, you're a surprising woman!  So your sympathies are all with Gungadhura?\"  \"Not at all.  I think he's a criminal!  He buys women, and tortures animals in an arena, and keeps a troupe of what he is pleased to call dancing-girls. I've seen his eyes in the morning, and I suspect him of most of the vices in the calendar.  He's despicable.  But if I were in his shoes I'd find that money and make it hot for you English!\"  \"Are you of Irish extraction, Mrs. Blaine?\"  \"No, indeed I'm not.  I'm Connecticut Yankee, and my husband's from the West.  I don't have to be Irish to think for myself, do I?\"  Samson did not know whether or not to take her seriously, but recognized that his chance had gone that morning for the flirtation he had had in view-- very mild, of course, for a beginning;  it was his experience that most things ought to start quite mildly, if you hoped to keep the other man from stampeding the game.  Nevertheless, as a judge of situations, be preferred not to take his leave at that moment.  Give a woman the last word always, but be sure it is a question, which you leave unanswered.  \"You've a beautiful garden,\" he said;  and for a minute or two they talked of flowers, of which he knew more than a little;  then of music, of which he understood a very great deal.  \"Have you a proper lease on this house?\" he asked at last.  \"I believe so. Why?\"  \"I've been told there's some question about the title.  Some one's bringing suit against your landlord for possession on some ground or another.\"  \"What of it?  Suppose the other should win--could he put us out?\"  \"I don't know.  That might depend on your present landlord's power to make the lease at the time when he made it.\"  \"But we signed the agreement in good faith.  Surely, as long as we pay the rent--?\"  \"I don't know, I'm sure.  Well--if there's any trouble, come to me about it and we'll see what can be done.\"  \"But who is this who is bringing suit against the landlord?\"  \"I haven't heard his name--don't even know the details.  I hope you'll come out of it all right.  Certainly I'll help in any way I can.  Sometimes a little influence, you know, exerted in the right way--well--Please give my regards to your husband--Good morning, Mrs. Blaine.\"  It was a pet theory of his that few men pay enough attention to their backs,--not that he preached it;  preaching is tantamount to spilling beans, supposing that the other fellow listens;  and if he doesn't listen it is waste of breath.  But he bore in mind that people behind him had eyes as well as those in front.  Accordingly he made a very dignified exit down the long path, tipped Mrs. Blaine's sais all the man had any right to expect, and rode away feeling that he had made the right impression. He looked particularly well on horseback.  Theresa Blaine smiled after him, wondering what impression she herself had made;  but she did not have much time to think about it.  From the open window behind her she was seized suddenly, drawn backward and embraced.  \"You are perfect!\" Yasmini purred in her ear between kisses.  \"You are surely one of the fairies sent to live among mortals for a sin!  I shall love you forever!  Now that burra-wallah Samson sahib will ride into the town, and perhaps also to the law-court, and to other places, to ask about your landlord, of whom he knows nothing, having only heard a servant's tale.  But Tom Tripe will have told already that I am at the burra commissioner's house, and Gungadhura will send there to ask questions.  And whoever goes will have to wait long.  And when the commissioner returns at last he will deny that I have been there, and the messenger will return to Gungadhura, who will not believe a word of it, especially as he will know that the commissioner has been riding about the town on an unknown errand.  So, after he has learned that I am back in my own palace, Gungadhura will try to poison me again.  All of which is as it should be. Come closer and let me--\"  \"Child!\" Tess protested. \"Do you realize that you're dressed up like an extremely handsome man, and are kissing me through a window in the sight of all Sialpore?  How much reputation do you suppose I shall have left within the hour?  \"There is only one kind of reputation worth the having,\" laughed Yasmini; \"that of knowing how to win!\"  \"But what's this about poison?\" Tess asked her.  \"He always tries to poison me.  Now he will try more carefully.\"  \"You must take care!  How will you prevent him?\"  By quite unconscious stages Tess found herself growing concerned about this young truant princess.  One minute she was interested and amused.  The next she was conscious of affection.  Now she was positively anxious about her, to use no stronger word.  Nor had she time to wonder why, for Yasmini's methods were breathless.  \"I shall eat very often at your house.  And then you shall take a journey with me.  And after that the great pig Gungadhura shall be very sorry he was born, and still more sorry that be tried to poison me!\"  \"Tell me, child, haven't you a mother?\"  \"She died a year ago.  If there is such a place as hell she has gone there, of course, because nobody is good enough for Heaven.  But I am not Christian and not Hindu, so hell is not my business.\"  \"What are you, then?\"  \"I am Yasmini.  There is nobody like me.  I am all alone, believing only what I know and laughing at the priests.  I know all the laws of caste, because that is necessary if you are to understand men.  And I have let the priests teach me their religion because it is by religion that they govern people.  And the priests,\" she laughed, \"are much more foolish than the fools they entice and frighten.  But the priests have power. Gungadhura is fearfully afraid of them.  The high priest of the temple of Jinendra pretends to him that he can discover where the treasure is hidden, so Gungadhura makes daily offerings and the priest grows very fat.\"  \"Who taught you such good English?\" Tess asked her;  for there was hardly even a trace of foreign accent, nor the least hesitation for a word.  \"Father Bernard, a Jesuit.  My mother sent for him, and he came every day, year after year.  He had a little chapel in Sialpore where a few of the very low-caste people used to go to pray and make confessions to him.  That should have given him great power;  but the people of this land never confess completely, as he told me the Europeans do, preferring to tell lies about one another rather than the truth about themselves. I refused to be baptized because I was tired of him, and after my mother died and she was burned with the Hindu ritual, he received orders to go elsewhere.  Now there is another Jesuit, but he only has a little following among the English, and can not get to see me because I hide behind the purdah.  The purdah is good--if you know how to make use of it and not be ruled by it.\"  They were still in the window, Yasmini kneeling on the cushions with her face in shadow and Tess with her back to the light.  \"Ah!  Hasamurti comes!\" said Yasmini suddenly.  \"She is my cheti.\" (Hand-maiden.)  Tess turned swiftly, but all she saw was one of the three beggars down by the little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5606"],["title","Guns of the Gods: A Story of Yasmini's Youth (#8)"],["body"," twisting himself a garland out of stolen flowers.  \"Now there will be a carriage waiting, and I must leave my horse in your stable.\"  The beggar held the twisted flowers up to the sun-light to admire his work.  \"I must go at once.  I shall go to the temple of Jinendra, where the priest, who is no man's friend, imagines I am a friend of his.  He will promise me anything if I will tell him what to say to Gungadhura;  and I shall tell him, without believing the promises.  One of these days perhaps he will plot with Gungadhura to have me poisoned, being in agreement with the commissioner sahib who said to you just now that it is not good to know too much!  But neither is it good to be too late!  Lend me a covering, my sister--see, this is the very thing.  I shall leave by the little gate. Send the gardener on an errand.  Are the other servants at the back of the house?  Of course yes, they will be spying to see me leave by the way I came.\"  Tess sent the gardener running for a basket to put flowers in, and when she turned her head again Yasmini had stepped out through the window shrouded from head to heels in a camel-hair robe such as the Bikanir Desert men wear at night.  The lower part of her face was hooded in it.  Provided you wear a turban you can wear anything else you like in India without looking incongruous.  It is the turban that turns the trick.  Even the spurs on the heels of riding-boots did not look out of place.  \"You'll sweat,\" laughed Tess.  \"That camel-hair is hot stuff.\"  \"Does the panther sweat under his pelt?  I am stronger than a panther. Now swiftly!  I must go, but I will come soon.  You are my friend.\"  She was gone like a shadow without another word, with long swift strides, not noticing the beggars and not noticed by them as far as any one could tell. Tess sat down to smoke a cigarette and think the experience over.  She had not done thinking when Dick Blaine returned unexpectedly for early lunch and showed her a bag-full of coarsely powdered quartz.  \"There's color there,\" he said jubilantly.  \"Rather more than merely color! It's not time to talk yet, but I think I've found a vein that may lead somewhere. Then won't Gungadhura gloat?\"  She told him at great length about Yasmini's visit, dwelling on every detail of it, he listening like a man at a play, for Tess had the gift of clear description.  \"Go a journey with her, if you feel like it, Tess,\" he advised.  \"You have a rotten time here alone all day, and I can't do much to 'liven it.  Take sensible precautions but have a good time anyway you can.\"  Because Yasmini had monopolized imagination she told him last of all, at lunch, about the commissioner's call, rehearsing that, too, detail by detail, word for word.  \"Wants me to find the treasure, does he, and call the game on Gungadhura? What does he take me for?  One of his stool-pigeons?  If it's a question of percentage, I'd prefer one from the maharajah than from him.  If I ever stumble on it, Gungadhura shall know first go off the bat, and I'll see the British Government in hell before I'll answer questions!\"  \"They'd never believe Gungadhura hadn't rewarded you,\" said Tess.  \"What of it?\" he demanded.  \"What do we care what they believe?  And supposing it were true, what then?  Just at present I'm in partnership with Gungadhura.\"      Chapter Four   Jinendra's Smile  Deep broods the calm where the cooing doves are mating And shadows quiver noiseless 'neath the courtyard trees, Cool keeps the gloom where the suppliants are waiting Begging little favors of Jinendra on their knees. Peace over all, and the consciousness of nearness, Charity removing the remoteness of the gods; Spirit of compassion breathing with new clearness \"There's a limit set to khama;  there's a surcease from the rods.\" \"Blessed were the few, who trim the lights of kindness, Toiling in the temple for the love of one and all, If it were not for hypocrisy and gluttony and blindness,\" Smiles the image of Jinendra on the courtyard wall.   \"The law .... is like a python after monkey's in the tree-tops.\"  Yasmini, hooded like a bandit in the camel-hair cloak, resumed an air of leisurely dignity in keeping with the unhurried habit of Sialpore the moment she was through the gate.  It was just as well she did, for Mukhum Dass, the money-lender, followed by a sweating lean parasite on foot, was riding a smart mule on his customary morning round to collect interest from victims and oversee securities.  He was a fat, squat, slimy-looking person in a black alpaca coat, with a black umbrella for protection from the sun, and an air of sour dissatisfaction for general business purposes--an air that was given the lie direct by a small, acquisitive nose and bright brown eyes that surely never made bad bargains.   Yasmini's hooded figure brought him to a halt just at the corner, where the little road below the Blaines' wall joined the wider road that led down-hill.  Business is business, and time a serious matter only for those who sign promissory notes;  he drew rein without compunction.  \"This house is yours?\" she asked, and he nodded, his sharp eyes shining like an animal's, determined to recognize his questioner.  \"There is a miscalculating son of lies who brings a lawsuit to get the title?\"  He nodded again--a man of few words except when words exacted interest.  \"Dhulap Singh, is it not?  He is a secret agent of Gungadhura.\"  \"How do you know?  Why should the maharajah want my property?\"  \"He hunts high and low for the Sialpore treasure.  Jengal Singh, who built this house, was in the confidence of Gungadhura's uncle, and a priest says there will be a clue found to the treasure beneath the floor of this house.\"  \"A likely tale indeed!\"  \"Very well, then--lose thine house!\"  Yasmini turned on a disdainful heel and started down-hill.  Mukhum Dass called after her, but she took no notice. He sent the sweating parasite to bring her back, but she shook him off with execrations. Mukhum Dass turned his mule and rode down-hill after her.  \"True information has its price,\" he said.  \"Tell me your name.\"  \"That also has its price.\"  He cackled dryly.  \"Natives cost money only to their owners--on a hundi.\" (Promissory note.)  \"Nevertheless there is a price.\"  \"In advance?  I will give a half-rupee!\"  Once more Yasmini resumed her way down-hill.  Again Mukhum Dass rode after her.  \"At any rate name the price.\"  \"It is silence firstly;  second, a security for silence.\"  \"The first part is easy.\"  \"Nay, difficult.  A woman can keep silence, but men chatter like the apes, in every coffee shop.\"  His bargain-driver's eyes watched hers intently, unable to detect the slightest clue that should start him guessing.  He was trying to identify a man, not a woman.  \"How shall I give security for silence?\" he asked.  \"I already hold it.\"  \"How?  What?  Where?\"  The money-lender betrayed a glimpse of sheer pugnacity that seemed to amuse his tormentor.  \"Send thy jackal out of ear-shot, tiger.\"  He snapped at his parasite angrily, and the man went away to sit down.  Then:  \"Where are the title-deeds of the house you say you own?\" she asked him suddenly.  Mukhum Dass kept silence, and tried to smother the raging anger in his eyes.  \"Was it Mukhum Dass or another, who went to the priest in the temple of Jinendra on a certain afternoon and requested intercession to the god in order that a title-deed might be recovered, that fell down the nullah when the snakes frightened a man's mule and he himself fell into the road?  Or was it another accident that split that car of thine in two pieces?\"  \"Priests cackle like old women,\" growled the money-lender.  \"Nay, but this one cackled to the god.  Perhaps Jinendra felt compassionate toward a poor shroff (money-lender) who can not defend his suit successfully without that title-deed.  Jengal Singh died and his son, who ought to know, claims that the house was really sold to Dhulap Singh, who dallies with his suit because he suspects, but does not know, that Mukhum Dass has lost the paper--eh?\"  \"How do you know these things?\"  \"Maybe the god Jinendra told!  Which would be better, Mukhum Dass-- to keep great silence, and be certain to receive the paper in time to defend the lawsuit,--or to talk freely, and so set others talking?\"  Who knows that it might not reach the ears of Jengal Singh that the title-deed is truly lost?\"  \"He who tells secrets to a priest,\" swore the money-lender, \"would better have screamed them from the housetop.  \"Nay--the god heard.  The priest told the god, and the god told a certain one to whom the finder brought the paper, asking a reward.  That person holds the paper now as security for silence!\"  \"It is against the law to keep my paper!\"  \"The law catches whom it can, Mukhum Dass, letting all others go, like a python after monkeys in the tree-tops!\"  \"From whom am I to get my paper for the lawsuit at the proper time?\"  \"From Jinendra's priest perhaps.\"  \"He has it now?  The dog's stray offspring!  I will--\"  \"Nay, he has it not!  Be kind and courteous to Jinendra's priest, or perhaps the god will send the paper after all to Dhulap Singh!\"  \"As to what shall I keep silence?\"  \"Two matters.  Firstly Chamu the butler will presently pay his son's debt. Give Chamu a receipt with the number of the bank-note written on it, saying nothing.\"  \"Second?\"  \"Preserve the bank-note carefully for thirty days and keep silence.\"  \"I will do that.  Now tell me thy name?\"  Yasmini laughed.  \"Do thy victims repay in advance the rupees not yet lent?  Nay, the price is silence!  First, pay the price;  then learn my name. Go--get thy money from Chamu the butler.  Breathe as much as a hint to any one, and thy title-deed shall go to Dhulap Singh!\"  Eying her like a hawk, but with more mixed emotions than that bird can likely compass, the money-lender sat his mule and watched her stride round the corner out of sight.  Then, glancing over her shoulder to make sure the man's parasite was not watching her at his "]]]
