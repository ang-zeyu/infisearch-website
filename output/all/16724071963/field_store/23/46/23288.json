And since I can't do that, I ought not to go back to the clover-patch at all. For if I did, it would be about the same as breaking a promise. ... No! I'll go to the dance instead!\" And away he flew.  Luckily the dance was not half finished when he reached it. And he had such a pleasant time that he forgot all about that Bumblebee worker, stuck fast to the thistle blossom.  But you may be sure that Peppery Polly did not forget him. After her friends set her free the following morning she spent the whole day looking for Freddie Firefly.  But he lay very low. And all the rest of the summer he shunned the clover field--and the flower garden, too.     XIV  JENNIE JUNEBUG   On the day--or rather, on the night--when he first met Jennie Junebug, Freddie Firefly was ill at ease. In fact it might be truthfully said that he was quite upset.  One beautiful, warm, dark night early in the summer Freddie was hurrying to join a big family party which was already gathering in the hollow beyond the hill.  He was scooting along through the damp air, flashing his light at the rate of about thirty-six times a minute, when a heavy body bumped into him and knocked him head over heels upon the grass-carpeted ground.  It was no wonder that he felt upset. And he felt quite peevish, too, as he picked himself up and looked about him to see what had happened.  The next moment he was flashing his light into the blinking eyes of an enormous fat person, who seemed to be dazed, either by the shock of the collision or by the light--Freddie Firefly couldn't tell which.  \"Why don't you look where you're going?\" Freddie cried impatiently. \"You knocked the breath out of me. And you almost broke one of my legs.\" The next instant he was heartily ashamed of himself; for he saw, to his surprise, that he was talking to a lady. \"Oh! I beg your pardon!\" he cried. \"Ex--excuse me! I hope you're not seriously injured?\"  \"Oh, no!\" wheezed the fat lady. \"I'm all right. It's no matter, I assure you. I'm quite used to running into things after dark.\"  Freddie Firefly didn't quite like being referred to as a THING. But he was too polite to say so.  \"You ought to be careful,\" he told the strange fat lady. \"It's dangerous for one of your weight--\"  \"Oh, don't!\" she exclaimed quickly. \"PLEASE don't tell me I'm fat! I've tried every remedy I know and I can't lose a single pound!\"  \"Don't you think that flying makes you thinner?\" Freddie Firefly asked her.  But the stout person shook her head dolefully.  \"It only seems to make me bigger,\" she groaned.  \"Then why do you do it?\"  \"Oh, I just adore flying!\" she cried. \"Don't you?\"  Freddie Firefly admitted that he did like to fly. And he was sorry, the next moment, that he had made such a statement. For the fat lady blinked happily at him. And clasping her hands together, she said:  \"Oh, do let's fly together, then!\"  Freddie Firefly was so taken aback that at first he couldn't think what to say. But at last he managed to stammer a reply.  \"Why--why--I--I'll be glad to, but I don't even know your name!\" he told her.  \"It's Jennie Junebug,\" she explained, as she fanned herself with a fan made from a white clover leaf.  \"You're a newcomer in these parts, aren't you?\" Freddie Firefly inquired.  \"I just arrived here this month,\" she informed him. \"This is the month of June, you know. And I'm one of the well-known Junebug family. ... I already know who you are,\" she continued. \"You've been pointed out to me. You are Freddie Firefly; and you can't deny it.\"     XV  THE FAT LADY'S SECRET   Somehow, the longer Freddie Firefly talked with Jennie Junebug, the more he wished that he might fly off and leave her there in the meadow. But he had just the same as told her that he would be glad to fly with her. And he really didn't see how he could escape that unpleasant duty.  \"Well, we may as well move on,\" he said at last. \"Where were you going when we ran into each other?\"  \"Oh, nowhere in particular!\" she answered. \"Where were YOU going?\"  Freddie Firefly had to bite his lip to keep from telling her that he had been on his way to a family party in the hollow beyond the hill. He certainly didn't want to go there in the company of that strange fat lady.  \"I WAS going over the hill,\" he faltered at last. \"But I'd rather stay here in the meadow with you.\"  \"How nice of you to say that!\" Jennie Junebug murmured. \"And now let's begin flying at once!\" she said.  So they rose into the air. But they hadn't flown more than a few feet when Jennie once more banged squarely into her companion.  It was a terrific blow. And Freddie Firefly soon found himself lying flat on the ground. He was so nearly stunned that he scarcely knew what had happened.  \"What fun!\" the fat lady gurgled right in his ear, with a horrible laugh. \"Come! Let's do it again!\"  \"Do it again!\" Freddie Firefly repeated after her, as a sudden fear gripped him. \"Do you mean to tell me that you ran into me ON PURPOSE?\" \"Why, certainly!\" she replied. \"Running into a light is more than half the fun of flying.\"  Her terrible secret was out at last. If Freddie Firefly had been older and wiser he would have known, in the beginning, that his first collision with the fat lady was no accident. The whole Junebug family were alike in one respect: preferring to fly at night, whenever they saw a light anywhere they made straight for it as fast as they could fly. Sometimes they landed with a crash against one of the farmhouse windows. Sometimes they struck the lantern, if Farmer Green happened to be carrying it across the farmyard. It really made little difference to a Junebug what he--or she--hit, so long as it gleamed brightly out of the night.  Well, Freddie Firefly saw at last that he was in a terrible fix. He knew now why Jennie Junebug had asked him to fly with her. It was on account of his flashing light! And the dreadful creature actually expected him to fly for her so that she might have the pleasure of bowling him over every time he rose into the air.  Such a practice was disagreeable, to say the least. Indeed, Freddie Firefly thought it was positively dangerous, for him.  \"Come! Come!\" Jennie Junebug urged him playfully, even while he lay on the ground trying to get his breath. \"If you don't hurry and fly some more I shall knock you over right where you are!\"  Freddie Firefly answered her with a faint moan. He couldn't run away from her. So he thought of hiding. But he had promised to fly with her. And she was a lady.  What could he do?     XVI  FREDDIE'S ESCAPE   There was really nothing Freddie Firefly could do except struggle to his feet and try to think at the same time. Flashing his light upon Jennie Junebug he saw that she was looking at him fondly. And that made him detest her more than ever.  \"You seem to be enjoying yourself,\" he said spitefully.  \"Yes, indeed!\" the fat lady exclaimed. \"I haven't had such sport for a whole week. One of your cousins flew with me one night. And we had a fine time. No doubt we'd be enjoying each other's company yet, if I hadn't had a bit of bad luck.\"  \"What was that?\" Freddie Firefly asked her quickly. He thought that if he could only keep his dreadful companion TALKING, perhaps she would forget about FLYING--and knocking him down. \"What was your bad luck?\" he repeated impatiently.  Jennie Junebug paused and wiped her eyes.  \"It was dreadful!\" she said at last, as soon as she could control her shaking voice. \"It was the worst accident that ever happened to me. ... Your cousin broke his neck!\"  Although Freddie Firefly sank back with a groan, she did not seem to notice him.  \"Your cousin--\" she continued--\"your cousin was the easiest thing to knock down that I ever saw. Why, once I knocked him over thirty-three times in one minute--or in other words, as fast as he flashed his light. . . . I had struck him so many times that he was growing weaker. Earlier in the evening, when he flashed thirty-six times to the minute, he was a little too quick for me.\"  \"Don't stop! Tell me more!\" Freddie Firefly begged her, as the fat lady ceased talking and fanned herself rapidly. And then, while she continued to tell him about his unfortunate cousin, Freddie set his wits to work upon a plan to escape from the dreadful creature. He hardly knew what she was saying. But every time she paused he urged her on again with a \"Yes, yes!\" or a \"Go on! Go on!\"  At first a wild hope came to him that he might be able to keep her talking all night. Then, of course, he would be safe; because when daylight came she would no longer be able to see his light.  But he soon had to give up that plan, for he saw plainly enough that the fat lady was growing restless. And at last she told him flatly that she had talked all she cared to.  \"I'm ready to fly now,\" she announced with an awful eagerness.  \"One moment!\" he said hastily. \"Your fan--I see you've torn it! And if you'll let me take it I'll try to find you another just like it.\"  \"Will you?\" Jennie Junebug asked him gratefully. \"And will you promise to come back just as soon as you've found me a PERFECT match for my fan?\"  \"I promise!\" said Freddie Firefly, snatching the fan out of her hands in his haste. \"Wait right here!\" he cautioned her. And then he leaped into the air and started away.  BANG! He hadn't flown longer than forty-six seconds when Jennie Junebug floored him again.  \"I simply couldn't resist hitting you once more!\" she said sweetly. \"And now, hurry! Or I shall never be able to let you leave me.\"  Freddie Firefly needed no more urging. Though he was sore in every limb (and he had a great many!) he made his escape quickly.  All the rest of the night he worked hard, trying to find a white clover leaf that exactly matched the one that Jennie Junebug had carried for a fan. But every single clover leaf was different"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5727"],["title","The Tale of Freddie Firefly (#5)"],["body","Jennie's in one way or another. Freddie Firefly had hoped that it would be so. For if he had found one precisely like Jennie Junebug's, he would have had to take it to her, as he had promised.  How long the fat lady waited for him in the meadow, Freddie Firefly never knew. And to tell the truth, he didn't care. He was too happy because he had escaped the fate of his cousin, to bother his head over Jennie Junebug.     XVII  BAD BENJAMIN BAT   For a long time Benjamin Bat had had his eye on Freddie Firefly. And every time the two met, Benjamin stopped to tell Freddie how plump he was growing.  \"You're just about ready to--AHEM!\" Benjamin remarked when he came upon Freddie in Farmer Green's dooryard one fine evening.  \"What did you say?\" Freddie inquired.  \"Never mind!\" Benjamin Bat answered. \"I was only talking to myself. It's a habit I have.\"  \"You're a queer one!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed. \"But it's no wonder. People say that you've hung upside down so much that the inside of your head is all topsy-turvy.\"  \"When he heard that remark Benjamin Bat promptly flew into a rage.  \"You'd better be careful!\" he warned Freddie. \"I don't allow anybody to talk to me like that.\"  \"Oh! You mustn't mind what I just said,\" Freddie Firefly replied. \"I was only talking to myself--AHEM AHEM!\"  But strange to say, Freddie's answer failed to please Benjamin.  \"Your remark was very disagreeable, anyhow,\" he declared.  \"Well--so was yours,\" Freddie retorted stoutly.  \"How can you say that?\" Benjamin Bat inquired with a sly look. \"I didn't finish it, did I?\"  \"No!\" replied Freddie. \"But you can't fool me. I know what you meant, as well as you do.\"  And straightway Benjamin Bat looked most uncomfortable, because he had been thinking that Freddie Firefly HAD BECOME PLUMP ENOUGH TO EAT.  Indeed, there was only one thing that kept Benjamin from devouring Freddie Firefly right then and there. And that was Freddie's flashing light. Yes! Benjamin Bat was afraid that if he touched Freddie Firefly he would get burned.  Once a forest fire broke out while Benjamin was asleep in the woods. And he didn't wake up until the tree in which he was hanging by his heels had begun to blaze. Luckily he escaped with his life. But the flames singed the tips of his wings and gave him such a fright that ever afterward he feared a fire or a light of any kind. And now he did wish that Freddie Firefly would put out his light, just for a short time. So he said, after a few moments:  \"Don't you think you ought to stop flashing your light?\"  \"Do you mean--\" asked Freddie--\"do you mean that I ought to keep it glaring steadily all the time?\"  \"Oh, no!\" Benjamin Bat replied hurriedly. \"I mean that you ought to put it out for a while.\"  \"Why should I do that?\" Freddie Firefly wanted to know.  \"To please Farmer Green, of course,\" Benjamin replied glibly. \"Don't you know that a light always draws mosquitoes? And it can't be very pleasant for Farmer Green to have half the mosquitoes in the neighborhood crowding into his dooryard.\"  \"What would be the use of my putting out my light, when all my relations are flashing theirs?\" Freddie asked.  \"Well, maybe they'd follow your example,\" Benjamin Bat suggested. \"And just think what a good turn you'd be doing Farmer Green!\"     XVIII  PLEASING FARMER GREEN   Now, when Benjamin Bat spoke of his doing Farmer Green a good turn, Freddie Firefly looked puzzled.  \"What has Farmer Green ever done for me?\" he inquired.  \"What has he done?\" Benjamin cried. \"Hasn't he furnished you a fine meadow in which to dance at night? And doesn't he let you come here in his dooryard whenever you please? I should think THAT was something to be thankful for!\"  \"Now that you speak of it, I don't know but that you're right,\" Freddie Firefly admitted, \"though I never thought of such a thing before.\" And not wishing to be ungrateful to Farmer Green, he promptly put out his light.  Of course, that was just what Benjamin was waiting for. And since he could see perfectly in the dark, without a moment's warning he rushed straight at Freddie Firefly, with his mouth wide open.  If Freddie hadn't happened to flash his light just at that moment he would never have flashed it again.  As soon as Benjamin Bat saw the greenish-white gleam he was so afraid of getting burned--not knowing that Freddie's light could not harm him--he was so afraid that he swerved sharply to one side and zigzagged about the yard for a few seconds.  But he soon returned to speak to Freddie Firefly once more.  \"You made a good beginning,\" he told Freddie. \"But you turned your light on again too quickly. Just keep dark until I tell you to shine, and with a little practice you'll be able to do the trick very well. And Farmer Green will certainly be pleased. Now, just try it again!\"  But Freddie Firefly could not forget how terrible Benjamin had looked a few moments before. And he began to suspect that Benjamin Bat was playing a trick of his own.  \"It seems to me,\" said Freddie, \"that you are a little too anxious about Farmer Green.\"  \"Oh! no, indeed!\" Benjamin Bat declared. \"Farmer Green is a fine man. He's a great friend of mine. He furnishes me a whole tree near the swamp, in which I sleep every day. If you passed that way any time between dawn and sunset you could see me hanging by my heels from one of the branches.\"  \"Just where is your tree?\" Freddie Firefly inquired.  Having no idea that Freddie could do him the slightest harm, Benjamin Bat explained that his special, favorite tree was a great cedar, which stood close to the old bridge that crossed Black Creek, at the lower end of the swamp.  \"I know where that is; and I'll go over there to-morrow and take a look at you,\" Freddie Firefly remarked.  \"Do!\" said Benjamin Bat.  \"And I'll bring Solomon Owl with me,\" Freddie added. \"For I know he'd like to see you, too.\"  \"Don't!\" cried Benjamin Bat. \"Oh, don't do that!\"  \"What's the matter?\" Freddie Firefly asked Benjamin Bat. \"Why don't you want me to fetch Solomon Owl to your tree, to see you hanging by your heels when you're fast asleep?\"  \"Solomon Owl is no friend of mine,\" Benjamin Bat explained with a shudder. \"He'd eat me in a minute, if he could catch me.\"     XIX  BENJAMIN FEELS GUILTY   Freddie Firefly and Benjamin Bat faced each other in Farmer Green's dark dooryard.  \"Yes!\" Benjamin Bat's thin voice quavered. \"Don't EVER bring Solomon Owl to my tree in the daytime. Although he doesn't see so well when it's light as he does at night, he could catch me without much trouble when I was asleep. And he would eat me in a minute--or only half a minute, maybe.\"  \"Well, wouldn't you like that?\" Freddie Firefly inquired, as if he were greatly surprised.  \"Certainly not!\" said Benjamin Bat. \"You talk like a--AHEM!\"  \"Perhaps I do,\" Freddie Firefly retorted. \"But I should think it would be just as jolly for you to be eaten by Solomon Owl as it would be for me to be eaten by you.\"  Benjamin started violently.  \"What in the world ever put such a strange idea into your head?\" Benjamin Bat cried. He was greatly astonished, for he had not supposed that Freddie Firefly suspected exactly what was in his mind.  \"You put that idea into my head yourself,\" Freddie Firefly said very sternly.  And the moment Benjamin Bat heard that, he felt very sheepish. But unlike most people who feel ashamed, he did not hang his head. Strangely enough, Benjamin Bat was never so proud as when his head hung lower than his heels. And he had a habit, when he felt guilty or uncomfortable, of RAISING his head, instead of dropping it. So now he lifted his head very high.  And by that tell-tale sign Freddie Firefly knew at once that Benjamin Bat would have flushed with dismay, had he only known how.  \"You're a rascal!\" Freddie cried fiercely, flashing his light again and again in Benjamin Bat's eyes, until that gentleman blinked so fast that it seemed as if his eyes must be in danger of turning inside out.  \"You'd better be off!\" Freddie Firefly shouted. \"And if you ever come to me again, coaxing me to put out my light--so you can eat me--I'll certainly bring Solomon Owl to your tree when you're asleep there.\"  Still Benjamin Bat made no move. Yet he wanted to go away because he was in terror of being burned by Freddie Firefly's light. But he did not dare turn his back upon Freddie Firefly and his light and fly away. And he began to be sorry that he had never learned to fly backwards.  \"Please--\" Benjamin Bat stammered at last--\"please do me a favor. I'm not feeling very well. I'm afraid I'm going to be ill. Maybe you'll be good enough to go and ask my friend Farmer Green to step outside his house a moment. Just tell him I'm in trouble,\" he whined.  \"Trouble!\" Freddie Firefly sneered, for he knew well enough--by this time--that Benjamin Bat was scared, though he couldn't quite guess the reason for Benjamin's fright. \"You'll be in worse trouble if I show Solomon Owl where you sleep in the daytime.\"  \"Stand back!\" Benjamin Bat shrieked suddenly. \"You'll singe my wings if you're not careful!\"  Then Freddie Firefly knew exactly what Benjamin feared. And he was so amused that he couldn't help taking a turn around the dooryard, to dance and laugh and shout.  And when he came back to the place where he had left Benjamin Bat, that odd gentleman had vanished.  The terrified Benjamin had floundered away toward the swamp. And never, afterward, did he have a word to say to Freddie Firefly.  But whenever Freddie Firefly caught sight of Benjamin Bat's dark shape, flitting in a zigzag path across the moon, he always cried out in a loud voice:  \"Look out, Benjamin Bat! Mr. Moon will singe your wings if you're not careful.\"     XX  MRS. LADYBUG'S ADVICE   Finding himself face to face with Mrs. Ladybug one night in Farmer Green's meadow, Freddie Firefly noticed, even before she spoke, that the little lady was not in a cheerful mood. In fact, she frowned at him darkly and pointed one of her knitting needles straight at him as she began to"]]]
