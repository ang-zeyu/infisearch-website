But you didn't tell me what you came to the city for?”  “I'm coming here for good,” announced Grant.  “You haven't got a place, have you?” ejaculated Tom, in surprise.  “Yes, I am to enter the office of Mr. Reynolds, a stock broker. There is his sign.”  “You don't say so I. Why, that's just the sort of place I wanted. How did you get the chance?”  “I got acquainted with Mr. Reynolds on board the cars that day we came to New York together.”  “And you asked him for the place?”  “I asked him this morning.”  “You might have given me the chance,” grumbled Tom, enviously. “You knew it was the sort of place I was after.”  “I don't think I was called upon to do that,” said Grant, smiling. “Besides, he wouldn't have accepted you.”  “Why not? Ain't I as smart as you, I'd like to know?” retorted Tom Calder, angrily.  “He heard us talking in the cars, and didn't like what you said.”  “What did I say?”  “He doesn't approve of boys smoking cigarettes and going to bucket shops. You spoke of both.”  “How did he hear?”  “He was sitting just behind us.”  “Was it that old chap that was sittin' with you when I came back from the smoking car?”  “Yes.”  “Just my luck,” said Tom, ruefully.  “When are you goin' to work?” asked Tom, after a pause.  “Next Monday.”  “Where are you going to board? We might take a room together, you know. It would be kind of social, as we both come from the same place.”  It did not occur to Grant that the arrangement would suit him at all, but he did not think it necessary to say so. He only said: “I am going to Mr. Reynolds' house, just at first.”  “You don't say so! Why, he's taken a regular fancy to you.”  “If he has, I hope he won't get over it.”  “I suppose he lives in a handsome brownstone house uptown.”  “Very likely; I've never seen the house.”  “Well, some folks has luck, but I ain't one of 'em,” grumbled Tom.  “Your luck is coming, I hope, Tom.”  “I wish it would come pretty soon, then; I say, suppose your folks won't let you take the place?” he asked, suddenly, brightening up.  “They won't oppose it.” “I thought they wanted you to go to college.”  “I can't afford it. It would take too long before I could earn anything, and I ought to be helping the family.”  “I'm goin' to look out for number one,” said Tom, shrugging his shoulders. “That's all I can do.”  Tom's mother was a hard-working woman, and had taken in washing for years. But for her the family would often have lacked for food. His father was a lazy, intemperate man, who had no pride of manhood, and cared only for himself. In this respect Tom was like him, though the son had not as yet become intemperate.  “I don't think there is any chance of my giving up the place,”  answered Grant. “If I do, I will mention your name.”  “That's a good fellow.”  Grant did not volunteer to recommend Tom, for he could not have done so with a clear conscience. This omission, however, Tom did not notice.  “Well, Tom, I must be going. Good-by, and good luck.”  Grant went home with a cheerful face, and announced his good luck to his mother.  “I am glad you are going to your employer's house,” she said. “I wish you could remain there permanently.”  “So do I, mother; but I hope at any rate to get a comfortable boarding place. Tom Calder wants to room with me.”  “I hope you won't think of it,” said Mrs. Thornton, alarmed.  “Not for a moment. I wish Tom well, but I shouldn't like to be too intimate with him. And now, mother, I think I ought to write to Uncle Godfrey, and tell him what I have decided upon.”  “That will be proper, Grant.” Grant wrote the following letter, and mailed it at once:  “DEAR UNCLE GODFREY:  I am afraid you won't like what I have to tell you, but I think it is my duty to the family to give up the college course you so kindly offered me, in view of father's small salary and narrow means. I have been offered a place in the office of a stock broker in New York, and have accepted it. I enter upon my duties next Monday morning. I hope to come near paying my own way, and before very long to help father. I know you will be disappointed, Uncle Godfrey, and I hope you won't think I don't appreciate your kind offer, but I think it would be selfish in me to accept it. Please do forgive me, and believe me to be  Your affectionate nephew, GRANT THORNTON.”  In twenty-four hours an answer came to this letter. It ran thus:  “NEPHEW GRANT:  I would not have believed you would act so foolishly and ungratefully. It is not often that such an offer as mine is made to a boy. I did think you were sensible enough to understand the advantages of a professional education. I hoped you would do credit to the name of Thornton, and keep up the family reputation as a man of learning and a gentleman. But you have a foolish fancy for going into a broker's office, and I suppose you must be gratified. But you needn't think I will renew my offer. I wash my hands of you from this time forth, and leave you to your own foolish course. The time will come when you will see your folly.  GODFREY THORNTON.”  Grant sighed as he finished reading this missive. He felt that his uncle had done him injustice. It was no foolish fancy, but a conscientious sense of duty, which had led him to sacrifice his educational prospects.  On Monday morning he took the earliest train for New York.    CHAPTER X -- A DAY IN WALL STREET    Grant went at once on his arrival in the city to Mr. Reynolds' office. He had in his hand a well-worn valise containing his small stock of clothing. The broker was just leaving the office for the Stock Exchange as Grant entered.  “So you are punctual,” he said, smiling.  “Yes, sir, I always on time.”  “That is an excellent habit. Here, Harry.”  In answer to this summons, Harry Becker, a boy two years older and correspondingly larger than Grant, came forward. He was a pleasant-looking boy, and surveyed Grant with a friendly glance.  “Harry,” said Mr. Reynolds, “this is your successor. Do me the favor of initiating him into his duties, so that when you leave me he will be qualified to take your place.”  “All right, sir.”  The broker hurried over to the Exchange, and the two boys were left together.  “What is your name?” asked the city boy.  “Grant Thornton.”  “Mine is Harry Becker. Are you accustomed to the city?”  “No, I am afraid you will find me very green,” answered Grant.  “You are not the boy to remain so long,” said Harry, scrutinizing him attentively.  “I hope not. You are going to Europe, Mr. Reynolds tells me.”  “Yes, the governor is going to take me.”  “The governor?”  “My father, I mean,” said Harry, smiling.  “I suppose you are not sorry to go?”  “Oh, no; I expect to have a tip-top time. How would you like it?”  “Very much, if I could afford it, but at present I would rather fill your place in the office. I am the son of a poor country minister, and must earn my own living.”  “How did you get in with Mr. Reynolds?” asked Harry.  Grant told him. “Is he easy to get along with?” he inquired, a little anxiously.  “He is very kind and considerate. Still he is stanch, and expects a boy to serve him faithfully.”  “He has a right to expect that.”  “As I am to break you in, you had better go about with me everywhere. First, we will go to the post-office.”  The two boys walked to Nassau Street, where the New York post-office was then located. Harry pointed out the box belonging to the firm, and producing a key opened it, and took out half a dozen letters.  “There may be some stock orders in these letters,” he said; “we will go back to the office, give them to Mr. Clark to open, and then you can go with me to the Stock Exchange.”  Ten minutes later they entered the large room used by the brokers as an Exchange. Grant looked about him in undisguised astonishment. It seemed like a pandemonium. The room was full of men, shouting, gesticulating and acting like crazy men. The floor was littered with fragments of paper, and on a raised dais were the officers of the Exchange, the chief among them, the chairman, calling rapidly the names of a long list of stocks. Each name was followed by a confused shouting, which Grant learned afterward to be bids for the stock named. There were several groups of brokers, each apparently interested in some leading security. In each of the galleries, one at each end, overlooking the stock room, curious spectators were watching what was going on.  Harry Decker was amused at Grant's look of surprise and bewilderment.  “You'll get used to it in time,” he said. “Say--there is Mr. Reynolds. I must speak to him.”  Mr. Reynolds stood near a placard on which, in prominent letters, was inscribed “Erie.” Harry handed him a paper, which he took, glanced at quickly, and then resumed his bidding.  “He has just bought one thousand Erie,” said Harry, aside, to Grant.  “One thousand?”  “Yes, a thousand shares, at fifty-five.”  “Fifty-five dollars?”  “Yes.”  “Why, that will make fifty-five thousand dollars,” ejaculated Grant, in wonder.  “Yes, that is one of the orders I brought over just now.”  “A man must have a great deal of capital to carry on this business, if that is only an item of a single day's business.”  “Yes, but not so much as you may imagine. I can't explain now, but you'll understand better as you go on. Now we'll go back and see if there's anything to do in the office.”  Not long afterward Harry had to come back to the Exchange again, and Grant came with him. He found something new to surprise him.  A tall man of dignified presence was walking across the floor, when a fellow member with a sly stroke sent his tall hat spinning across the floor. When the victim turned the mischief-maker was intent upon his memorandum book, and the tall man's suspicions fell upon a short, stout young man beside him. With a vigorous sweep he knocked the young man's hat off, saying, “It's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5833"],["title","Helping Himself; Or, Grant Thornton's Ambition (#7)"],["body"," a poor rule that don't work both ways.”  This led to a little scrimmage, in which a dozen were involved. The brokers, staid, middle-aged men, most of them, seemed like a pack of school boys at recess. Grant surveyed the scene with undisguised astonishment.  “What does it mean, Harry?” he asked.  “Oh, that's a very common occurrence,” said Harry, smiling.  “I never saw grown men acting so. Won't there be a fight?”  “Oh, it's all fun. The brokers are unlike any other class of men in business hours,” explained Harry. “It's one of the customs of the place.”  Just then, to his astonishment, Grant saw his employer, Mr. Reynolds, pursuing his hat, which was rolling over the floor. He was about to run to his assistance, but Harry stopped him.  “No interference is allowed,” he said. “Leave them to their fun. I used to think it strange myself, when I first came into the Exchange, but I'm used to it now. Now we may as well go back to the office.”  There is no occasion to follow the boys through the day's routine. Grant found his companion very obliging, and very ready to give him the information he needed. Many boys would have been supercilious and perhaps been disposed to play tricks on a country boy, but Harry was not one of them. He took a friendly interest in Grant, answered all his questions, and did his best to qualify him for the position he was to assume.  Before the office closed, Grant and his new friend went to the bank to make a deposit of money and checks. The deposit amounted to about twenty thousand dollars.  “There must be plenty of money in New York,” said Grant. “Why, up in Colebrook, if a man were worth twenty thousand dollars he would be considered a rich man.”  “It takes a good deal more than that to make a man rich in New York. In the stock business a man is likely to do a larger business in proportion to his capital than in the mercantile business.”  On their way back from the bank, Grant came face to face with Tom Calder. Tom was busily engaged in talking to a companion, some years older than himself, and didn't observe Grant. Grant was by no means prepossessed in favor of this young man, whose red and mottled face, and bold glance made him look far from respectable.  “Do you know those fellows?” asked Harry Becker.  “The youngest one is from Colebrook.”  “He is in bad company. I hope he is not an intimate friend of yours?”  “Far from it. Still, I know him, and am sorry to see him with such a companion.”  At four o'clock Mr. Reynolds proposed to go home. He beckoned to Grant to accompany him.    CHAPTER XI -- GRANT MAKES A FRIEND    “What do you think of your first day in Wall Street?” asked Mr. Reynolds, kindly.  “I have found it very interesting,” answered Grant.  “Do you think you shall like the business?”  “Yes, sir, I think so.”  “Better than if you had been able to carry out your original plan, and go to college?”  “Yes, sir, under the circumstances, for I have a better prospect of helping the family.”  “That feeling does you credit. Have you any brothers and sisters?”  “One of each, sir.”  “I have but one boy, now nine years old. I am sorry to say he is not strong in body, though very bright and quick, mentally. I wish he were more fond of play and would spend less time in reading and study.”  “I don't think that is a common complaint among boys, sir.”  “No, I judge not from my own remembrance and observation. My wife is dead, and I am such a busy man that I am not able to give my boy as much attention as I wish I could. My boy's health is the more important to me because I have no other child.”  Grant's interest was excited, and he looked forward to meeting his employer's son, not without eagerness. He had not long to wait.  The little fellow was in the street in front of the house when his father reached home. He was a slender, old-fashioned boy in appearance, who looked as if he had been in the habit of keeping company with grown people. His frame was small, but his head was large. He was pale, and would have been plain, but for a pair of large, dark eyes, lighting up his face.  “Welcome home, papa,” he said, running up to meet Mr. Reynolds.  The broker stooped over and kissed his son. Then he said: “I have brought you some company, Herbert. This is Grant Thornton, the boy I spoke to you about.”  “I am glad to make your acquaintance,” said the boy, with old-fashioned courtesy, offering his hand.  “And I am glad to meet you, Herbert,” responded Grant, pleasantly.  The little boy looked up earnestly in the face of his father's office boy.  “I think I shall like you,” he said.  Mr. Reynolds looked pleased, and so did Grant.  “I am sure we shall be very good friends,” said our hero.  “Herbert,” said his father, “will you show Grant the room he is to occupy?”  “It is next to mine, isn't it, papa?”  “Yes, my son.”  “Come with me,” said Herbert, putting his hand in Grant's. “I will show you the way.”  Grant, who was only accustomed to the plain homes in his native village, was impressed by the evidence of wealth and luxury observable in the house of the stock broker. The room assigned to him was small, but it was very handsomely furnished, and he almost felt out of place in it. But it was not many days, to anticipate matters a little, before he felt at home.  Herbert took Grant afterward into his own room.  “See my books,” he said, leading the way to a bookcase, containing perhaps a hundred volumes, the majority of a juvenile character, but some suited to more mature tastes. “Do you like reading?” asked Grant.  “I have read all the books you see here,” answered Herbert, “and some of papa's besides. I like to read better than to play.”  “But you ought to spend some of your time in play, or you will not grow up healthy.”  “That is what papa says. I try to play some, but I don't care much about it.”  Grant was no longer surprised at the little boy's delicacy. It was clear that he needed more amusement and more exercise. “Perhaps,” he thought, “I can induce Herbert to exercise more.”  “When do you take dinner?” he asked.  “At half-past six. There is plenty of time.”  “Then suppose we take a little walk together. We shall both have a better appetite.”  “I should like to,” replied Herbert; “that is, with you. I don't like to walk alone.”  “How far is Central Park from here?”  “A little over a mile.”  “I have never seen it. Would you mind walking as far as that?”  “Oh, no.”  So the two boys walked out together. They were soon engaged in an animated conversation, consisting, for the most part, of questions proposed by Grant, and answers given by Herbert.  Not far from the park they came to a vacant lot where some boys were playing ball.  “Now, if we only had a ball, Herbert,” said Grant, “we might have a little amusement.”  “I've got a ball in my pocket, but I don't use it much.”  “Let me see it.”  Herbert produced the ball, which proved to be an expensive one, better than any Grant had ever owned.  “There, Herbert, stand here, and I will place myself about fifty feet away. Now, throw it to me, no matter how swiftly.”  They were soon engaged in throwing the ball to each other. Grant was a good ball player, and he soon interested the little boy in the sport. Our hero was pleased to see Herbert's quiet, listless manner exchanged for the animation which seemed better suited to a boy.  “You are improving, Herbert,” he said, after a while. “You would make a good player in time.”  “I never liked it before,” said the little boy. “I never knew there was so much fun in playing ball.”  “We shall have to try it every day. I suppose it is about time to go home to supper.”  “And we haven't been to Central Park, after all.”  “That will do for another day. Are boys allowed to play ball in the park?”  “Two afternoons in the week, I believe, but I never played there.”  “We shall have to try it some day.”  “I should like to play--with you.”  They reached home in full time for dinner. At the dinner table Mr. Reynolds was struck by the unusually bright and animated face of his son, and his good appetite.  “What have you been doing to make you so hungry, Herbert?” he asked.  “I took a walk with Grant, and we had a fine game of ball.”  “I am glad to hear it,” said the broker, much pleased. “If you want to become stout and strong like Grant, that is the best thing for you to do.”  “I never liked playing ball before, papa.”  “That is a compliment to you, Grant,” said the broker, smiling.  “I think,” he said to the prim, elderly lady who presided over the household, acting as housekeeper, “Herbert will be the better for having a boy in the house.”  “I don't know about that,” said Mrs. Estabrook, stiffly. “When he came into the house he had mud on his clothes. He never did that till this boy came.”  “I won't complain of that, if his health is improved.”  Mrs. Estabrook, who was a poor relation of Herbert's mother, pursed up her mouth, but did not reply. In her eyes, it was more important that a boy should keep his clothes whole and clean than to have color in his cheeks, and health in his frame.  “I hope that boy won't stay here long,” she thought, referring, of course, to Grant. “He'll quite spoil Herbert by making him rough and careless of his appearance.”  “Well, Herbert, and how do you like Grant?” asked Mr. Reynolds, as his son was bidding him good-night before going to bed.  “I am so glad you brought him here, papa. I shall have good times now. You'll let him stay all the time, won't you?”  “I'll see about it, Herbert,” answered his father, smiling.    CHAPTER XII -- MRS. ESTABROOK'S PLANS    Grant was going home with Mr. Reynolds at the close of the fourth day, when it occurred to him to say what had been in his mind for some time: “Isn't it time, Mr. Reynolds, for me to be looking out for a boarding place?”  The broker smiled, and said with assumed concern: “Are you dissatisfied with your present boarding place?”  “How could I be, sir?” returned Grant, earnestly. “But you told me I could stay with you a week, while I "]]]
