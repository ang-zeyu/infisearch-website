So that Noah was 84 years old when Enos died, 176 when Cainan died, 234 when Mahalaleel died, 366 when Jared died, 595 when Lamech died, and 600 when Methuselah died.  43. We can see from this that Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Methuselah, Lamech, and Noah, all lived on the earth at the same time; and that Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Methuselah, and Lamech, were all acquainted with both Adam and Noah.  44. From the foregoing it is easily to be seen, not only how the knowledge of God came into the world, but upon what principle it was preserved: that from the time it was first communicated, it was retained in the minds of righteous men, who taught, not only their own posterity, but the world; so that there was no need of a new revelation to man, after Adam's creation to Noah, to give them the first idea, or notion of the existence of a God: and not only of a God, but of the true and living God.  45. Having traced the chronology of the world from Adam to Noah, we will now trace it from Noah to Abraham. Noah was 502 years old When Shem was born; 98 years afterwards the flood came, being the 600th year of Noah's age. And Moses informs us that Noah lived after the flood, 350 years, making him 950 years old when he died. Genesis 9:28-29.  46. Shem was 100 years old when Arphaxad was born. Genesis 11:10. Arphaxad was 35 when Salah was born. Gen. 11:12. Salah was 30 when Eber was born. 11:14. Eber was 34 when Peleg was born, in whose days the earth was divided. 11:16. Peleg was 30 when Reu was born. 11:18. Reu was 32 when Serug was born. 11:20. Serug was 30 when Nahor was born. 11:22. Nahor was 29 when Terah was born. 11:24. Terah was 70 when Haran and Abraham were born. 11:26.  47. There is some difficulty in the account given by Moses of Abraham's birth. Some have supposed that Abraham was not born until Terah was 130 years old. This conclusion is drawn from a variety of scriptures, which are not to our purpose at present to quote. Neither is it a matter of any consequence to us whether Abraham was born when Terah was 70 years old, or 130. But in order that there may no doubt exist upon any mind in relation to the object lying immediately before us, in presenting the present chronology we will date the birth of Abraham at the latest period, that is, when Terah was 130 years old. It appears from this account that from the flood to the birth of Abraham, was 352 years.  48. Moses informs us that Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad, 500 years. Gen. 11:11. This added to 100 years, which was his age when Arphaxad was born, makes him 600 years old when he died. Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah, 403 years. 11:13. This added to 35 years, which was his age when Salah was born, makes him 438 years old when he died. Salah lived after he begat Eber, 403 years. 11:15.--This added to 30 years, which was his age when Eber was born, makes him 433 years old when he died.--Eber lived after he begat Peleg, 430 years. 11:17. This added to 34 years, which was his age when Peleg was born, makes him 464 years old. Peleg lived after he begat Reu, 209 years. 11:19. This added to 30 years, which was his age when Reu was born, makes him 239 years old when he died. Reu lived, after he begat Serug, 207 years. Gen. 11:21. This added to 32 years, which was his age when Serug was born, makes him 239 years old when he died. Serug lived after he begat Nahor, 200 years. 11:23. This added to 30 years, which was his age when Nahor was born, makes him 230 years old when he died. Nahor lived after he begat Terah, 119 years. 11:25. This added to 29 years, which was his age when Terah was born, makes him 148 years old when he died. Terah was 130 years old when Abraham was born, and is supposed to have lived 75 years after his birth: making him 205 years old when he died.  49. Agreeable to this last account, Peleg died in the 1996th year of the world, Nahor in the 1997th, and Noah in the 2006th. So that Peleg, in whose days the earth was divided, and Nahor, the grandfather of Abraham, both died before Noah--the former being 239 years old, and the latter 148. And who cannot but see that they must have had a long and intimate acquaintance with Noah?  50. Reu died in the 2026th year of the world, Serug in the 2049th, Terah in the 2083rd, Arphaxad in the 2096th, Salah in the 2126th, Shem in the 2158th, Abraham in the 2183rd, and Eber in the 2187th: which was four years after Abraham's death. And Eber was the fourth from Noah.  51. Nahor, Abraham's brother, was 58 years old when Noah died, Terah 128, Serug 187, Reu 219, Eber 283, Salah 313, Arphaxad 344, and Shem 448.  52. It appears from this account, that Nahor, brother of Abraham, Terah, Nahor, Serug, Reu, Peleg, Eber, Salah, Arphaxad, Shem, and Noah, all lived on the earth at the same time. And that Abraham was 18 years old when Reu died, 41 when Serug and his brother Nahor died, 75 when Terah died, 88 when Arphaxad died, 118 when Salah died, 150 when Shem died, and that Eber lived 4 years after Abraham's death. And that Shem, Arphaxad, Salah, Eber, Reu, Serug, Terah, and Nahor, the brother of Abraham, and Abraham, lived at the same time.--And that Nahor, brother of Abraham, Terah, Serug, Reu, Eber, Salah, Arphaxad, and Shem, were all acquainted with both Noah and Abraham.  53. We have now traced the chronology of the world agreeable to the account given in our present Bible, from Adam to Abraham, and have clearly determined, beyond the power of controversy, that there was no difficulty in preserving the knowledge of God in the world from the creation of Adam, and the manifestation made to his immediate descendants, as set forth in the former part of this lecture, so that the students in this class need not have any dubiety resting on their minds, on this subject; for they can easily see, that it is impossible for it to be otherwise; but that the knowledge of the existence of a God, must have continued from father to son, as a matter of tradition at least. For we cannot suppose, that a knowledge of this important fact, could have existed in the mind of any of the before--mentioned individuals, without their having made it known to their posterity.  54. We have now shown how it was that the first thought ever existed in the mind of any individual, that there was such a Being as a God, who had created and did uphold all things: that it was by reason of the manifestation which he first made to our father Adam, when he stood in his presence, and conversed with him face to face, at the time of his creation.  55. Let us here observe, that after any portion of the human family are made acquainted with the important fact that there is a God, who has created and does uphold all things, the extent of their knowledge, respecting his character and glory, will depend upon their diligence and faithfulness in seeking after him, until like Enoch the brother of Jared, and Moses, they shall obtain faith in God, and power with him to behold him face to face.  56. We have now clearly set forth how it is, and how it was, that God became an object of faith for rational beings; and also, upon what foundation the testimony was based, which excited the inquiry and diligent search of the ancient saints, to seek after and obtain a knowledge of the glory of God; and we have seen that it was human testimony, and human testimony only, that excited this enquiry, in the first instance, in their minds--it was the credence they gave to the testimony of their fathers--this testimony having aroused their minds to inquire after the knowledge of God, the enquiry frequently terminated, indeed always terminated when rightly pursued, in the most glorious discoveries, and eternal certainty.  _Question_.--Is there a being who has faith in himself, independently?  _Answer_.--There is. Q. Who is it? A. It is God. Q. How do you prove that God has faith in himself independently?  A. Because he is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient; without beginning of days or end of life, and in him all fullness dwells. Eph 1:23: Which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all. Col 1:19. For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell. [§ II. ¶ 2.]  Q. Is he the object in whom the faith of all other rational and accountable beings center, for life and salvation?  A. He is.  Q. How do you prove it?  A. Isa. 45:22. Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. Romans 11:34,35,36. For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counselor? or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, to whom be glory for ever. Amen. Isa. 40: from the 8th to the 18th verses. O Zion that bringest good tidings; [or, O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion?] get you up into the high mountain: O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings; [or, O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem] lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! Behold the Lord your God will come with strong hand [or, against the strong]; and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. [Or, recompense for his work]. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather his lambs with his arms, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young. Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counselor, hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?

And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. All nations are before him as nothing, and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. Jer. 11:15, 16: He [the Lord] hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his Wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. When he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 1 Cor 8:6 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. [§ II. ¶ 2.]  Q. How did men first come to the knowledge of the existence of a God, so as to exercise faith in him?  A. In order to answer this question, it will be necessary to go back and examine man at his creation; the circumstances in which he was placed, and the knowledge which he had of God. [§ II. ¶ 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.]. First, when man was created he stood in the presence of God. Gen. 1:27,28. From this we earn that man, at his creation, stood in the presence of his God, and had most perfect knowledge of his existence. Secondly, God conversed with him after his transgression. Gen 3: from the 8th to the 22nd. [§ II. ¶ 13,14,15,16,17.] From this we learn that, though man did transgress, he was not deprived of the previous knowledge which he had of the existence of God. [§ II. ¶ 19.] Thirdly, God conversed with man after he cast him out of the garden. [§ II. ¶ 22,23,24,25.] Fourthly, God also conversed with Cain after he had slain Abel. Gen 4: from the 4th to the 6th. [§ II. ¶ 26,27,28,29.]  Q. What is the object of the foregoing quotation?  A. It is that it may be clearly seen how it was that the first thoughts were suggested to the minds of men of the existence of God, and how extensively this knowledge was spread among the immediate descendants of Adam. [§ II. ¶ 30,31,32,33.]  Q. What testimony had the immediate descendants of Adam, in proof of the existence of God?  A. The testimony of their father. And after they were made acquainted with his existence, by the testimony of their father, they were dependent upon the exercise of their own faith, for a knowledge of his character, perfections, and attributes. [§ II. ¶ 23,24,25,26.]  Q. Had any other of the human family, besides Adam, a knowledge of the existence of God, in the first instance, by any other means than human testimony?  A. They had not. For previous to the time that they could have power to obtain a manifestation for themselves, the all-important fact had been communicated to them by their common father: and so from father to child the knowledge was communicated as extensively, as the knowledge of his existence was known; for it was by this means, in the first instance, that men had a knowledge of his existence. [§ II. ¶ 35,36].  Q. How do you know that the knowledge of the existence of God was communicated in this manner, throughout the different ages of the world?  A. By the chronology obtained through the revelations of God.  Q. How would you divide that chronology in order to convey it to the understanding clearly?  A. Into two parts: First, by embracing that period of the world from Adam to Noah; and secondly, from Noah to Abraham: from which period the knowledge of the existence of God has been so general, that it is a matter of no dispute in what manner the idea of his existence has been retained in the world.
