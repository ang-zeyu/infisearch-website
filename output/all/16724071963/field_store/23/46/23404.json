It had just popped into his head by way of something to say. But Sammy Jay is sharp, and he noticed right away that Peter didn't answer but began to talk about other things.  “Ha, ha!” thought Sammy to himself, “I believe he didn't come alone, I wonder now if he brought Miss Fuzzytail with him.”  Right away Sammy began to peer down into the Old Briar-patch, twisting and turning so that he could see in every direction, and all the time talking as fast as his tongue could go. Two or three times he flew out over the Old Briar-patch, pretending to try to catch moths, but really so that he could look down into certain hiding-places. The last time that he did this he spied little Mrs. Peter, who was, you know, Miss Fuzzytail. At once Sammy Jay started for the Green Forest, screaming at the top of his voice:  “Peter Rabbit's married! Peter Rabbit's married!”     CHAPTER XXIII  PETER INTRODUCES MRS. PETER      It's what you do for others,      Not what they do for you,    That makes you feel so happy      All through and through and through.                             Peter Rabbit.  Peter Rabbit made a wry face as he listened to Sammy Jay shrieking at the top of his voice as he flew through the Green Forest and over the Green Meadows,” Peter Rabbit's married!” “Peter Rabbit's married!” He saw the Merry Little Breezes who, you know, are the children of Old Mother West Wind, start for the dear Old Briar-patch as soon as they heard Sammy Jay, and he knew that they would be only the first of a lot of visitors. He hurried to where Mrs. Peter was hiding under a sweet-briar bush.  “Do you hear what that mischief-maker, Sammy Jay, is screaming?” asked Peter.  Mrs. Peter nodded. “Don't--don't you think it sounds kind of--well, kind of NICE, Peter?” she asked in a bashful sort of way.  Peter chuckled. “It sounds more than KIND of nice to me,” said he. “Do you know, I used to think that Sammy Jay never did and never could say anything nice, but I've just changed my mind. Though he isn't saying it to be nice, it really is the nicest thing I've ever heard him say. We haven't been able to keep our secret, so I think the very best thing we can do is to invite everybody to call. Then we can get it over with and have a little time to ourselves. Here come the Merry Little Breezes, and I know that they will be glad to take the invitations for us.”  Mrs. Peter agreed, for she thought that anything Peter did or suggested was just about right. So the Merry Little Breezes were soon skipping and dancing over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest with this message:  “Mr. and Mrs. Peter Rabbit will be at home in the Old Briar-patch to their friends to-morrow after-noon at shadow-time.”  “Why did you make it at shadow-time?” asked Mrs. Peter.  “Because that will give all our friends a chance to come,” replied Peter. “Those who sleep through the day will have waked up, and those who sleep through the night will not have gone to bed. Besides, it will be safer for some of the smallest of them if the Black Shadows are about for them to hide in on their way here.”  “How thoughtful you are,” said little Mrs. Peter with a little sigh of happiness.  Of course, every one who could walk, creep, or fly headed for the Old Briar-patch the next day at shadow-time, for almost every one knows and loves Peter Rabbit, and of course every one was very anxious to meet Mrs. Peter. From the Smiling Pool came Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Jerry Muskrat, Spotty the Turtle, and old Grandfather Frog. From the Green Forest came Bobby Coon, Unc' Billy Possum and Mrs. Possum, Prickly Porky the Porcupine, Whitefoot the Woodmouse, Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Blacky the Crow, Sammy Jay, Ol' Mistah Buzzard, Mistah Mockingbird, and Sticky-toes the Treetoad. From the Green Meadows came Danny Meadow Mouse, Old Mr. Toad, Digger the Badger, Jimmy Skunk, and Striped Chipmunk, who lives near the old stone-wall between the edge of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest. Johnny and Polly Chuck came down from the Old Orchard and Drummer the Woodpecker came from the same place.  Of course Old Man Coyote paid his respects, and when he came everybody but Prickly Porky and Digger the Badger and Jimmy Skunk made way for him with great respect. Granny and Reddy Fox and Hooty the Owl didn't call, but they sat where they could look on and make fun. You see, Peter had fooled all three so many times that they felt none too friendly.  Very proud looked Peter as he stood under a bramble-bush with Mrs. Peter by his side and introduced her to his many friends, and very sweet and modest and retiring looked little Mrs. Peter as she sat beside him. Everybody said that she was “too sweet for anything”, and when Reddy Fox overheard that remark he grinned and said:  “Not for me! She can't be too sweet for me, and I hope I'll have a chance to find out just how sweet she is.”  What do you suppose he meant?     CHAPTER XXIV  DANNY MEADOW MOUSE WARNS PETER RABBIT   Good advice Is always needed  But, alas! is seldom heeded,                                   Peter Rabbit.   Danny Meadow Mouse waited until all the rest of Peter Rabbit's friends had left the Old Briar-patch after paying their respects to Peter and Mrs. Peter, He waited for two reasons, did Danny Meadow Mouse. In the first place, he had seen old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox hanging about a little way off, and though they had disappeared after a while, Danny had an idea that they were not far away, but were hiding so that they might catch him on his way home. Of course, he hadn't the slightest intention of giving them the chance. He had made up his mind to ask Peter if he might spend the night in a corner of the Old Briar-patch, and he was very sure that Peter would say he might, for he and Peter are very good friends, very good friends indeed.  The second good reason Danny had for waiting was this very friendship. You see, Peter had been away from the Green Meadows so long that Danny felt sure he couldn't know all about how things were there now, and so he wanted to warn Peter that the Green Meadows were not nearly as safe as before Old Man Coyote had come there to live. So Danny waited, and when all the rest of the callers had left he called Peter to one side where little Mrs. Peter couldn't hear. Danny stood up on his hind legs so as to whisper in one of Peter's ears.  “Do you know that Old Man Coyote is the most dangerous enemy we have, Peter Rabbit? Do you know that?” he asked.  Peter Rabbit shook his head. “I don't believe that, Danny,” said he. “His terrible voice has frightened you so that you just think him as bad as he sounds. Why, Old Man Coyote is a friend of mine.”  Then he told Danny how Old Man Coyote had done him a good turn In the Old Pasture in return for a good turn Peter had once done him, and how he said that he always paid his debts.  Danny Meadow Mouse looked doubtful. “What else did he say?” he demanded. “Nothing, excepting that we were even now,” replied Peter.  “Ha!” said Danny Meadow Mouse.  The way he said it made Peter turn to look at him sharply.  “Ha!” said Danny again. “If you are even, why you don't owe him anything, and he doesn't owe you anything. Watch out, Peter Rabbit! Watch out! I would stick pretty close to the Old Briar-patch with Mrs. Peter if I were you. I would indeed. You used to think old Granny Fox pretty smart, but Old Man Coyote is smarter. Yes, Sir, he is smarter! And every one of the rest of us has got to be smarter than ever before to keep out of his clutches. Watch out, Peter Rabbit, if you and Old Man Coyote are even. Now, if you don't mind, I'll curl up in my old hiding-place for the night. I really don't dare go back home to-night.”  Of course Peter told Danny Meadow Mouse that he was welcome to spend the night in the Old Briar-patch, and thanked Danny for his warning as he bade him good-night. But Peter never carries his troubles with him for long, and by the time he had rejoined little Mrs. Peter he was very much inclined to laugh at Danny's fear.  “What did that funny little Meadow Mouse have to say?” asked Mrs. Peter.  Peter told her and then added, “But I don't believe we have anything to fear from Old Man Coyote. You know he is my friend.”  “But I don't know that he is mine!” replied little Mrs. Peter, and the way she said it made Peter look at her anxiously. “I believe Danny Meadow Mouse is right,” she continued, “Oh, Peter, you will watch out, won't you?”  And Peter promised her that he would.     CHAPTER XXV  PETER RABBIT'S HEEDLESSNESS     Heedlessness is just the twin    of thoughtlessness, you know,  And where you find them both at once,    there trouble's sure to grow.                                    Peter Rabbit.  Peter Rabbit didn't mean to be heedless. No, indeed! Oh, my, no! Peter thought so much of Mrs. Peter, he meant to be so thoughtful that she never would have a thing to worry about. But Peter was heedless. He always was heedless. This is the worst of a bad habit--you can try to let go of it, but it won't let go of you.  So it was with Peter. He had been heedless so long that now he actually didn't know when he was heedless.  When there was nobody but himself to think about, and no one to worry about him, his heedlessness didn't so much matter. If anything had happened to him then, there would have been no one to suffer. But now all this was changed. You see, there was little Mrs. Peter. At first Peter had been perfectly content to stay with her in the dear Old Briar-patch. He had led her through all his private little paths, and they had planned where they would make two or three more. He had showed her all his secret hiding-places and the shortest way to the sweet-clover patch. He had pointed out where the Lone Little Path came down to the edge of the Green Forest and so out on to the Green Meadows. He had shown her where the Crooked Little Path came down the hill.

Chéruel and Ad. Régnier _fils_. Nor is it all of equal interest. I thought, therefore, that a selection might prove acceptable to the busy or faint-hearted reader, and perhaps even whet his appetite for the work itself. In making the selection I have practically confined myself to the first two-thirds of the _Mémoires_, that is to say, to the reign of Louis XIV, and I have chosen the passages with a view to illustrating that reign during the period of its declining splendour. In the first four chapters we have the Roi-Soleil and Mme de Maintenon presented to us in their daily life. There follows the account of the review at Compiègne, which gives us some measure of Louis’s boundless extravagance, and the greater part of the famous chapters on the death of Monseigneur, surely one of the greatest things in literature. Lastly there are thirteen portraits, including such masterpieces as Conti, Cardinal d’Estrées, Fénelon, the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy, and the Duke of Orléans. In my notes I have confined myself to the modest task of illustrating Saint-Simon from himself, and of supplying such other biographical details as seemed necessary. No one can annotate Saint-Simon without being indebted to M. de Boislisle’s masterly edition now in progress, but for my purpose the full and careful index of MM. Chéruel and Régnier has been of even greater service. The index to vols. I.-XXVIII. of M. de Boislisle’s edition appeared after my work was practically finished.    A. T.

Historians now recognise that “memoirs do not supply the certainty of history,” for if the writers have dim memories, they have also lively imaginations. Saint-Simon, the prince of memoir-writers, did not, it is true, begin to transcribe his memoirs till he was well past sixty, but from the age of twenty he had collected materials and made systematic notes. His memoirs were not merely the pastime of his old age but the serious business of his whole life. The result is that he has left us a picture of the Court of Versailles at the close of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth which is unsurpassed in interest. This interest is above all things human. The men and women who fill his canvas are vividly alive. With a few powerful and incisive strokes he first sketches their lineaments and then with merciless penetration proceeds to lay bare their souls. But his memoirs are also coloured by his own alert and energetic personality. They not only portray his age, but they reveal himself; to judge of the fidelity of the picture, we must know something of the man.  Saint-Simon came of an ancient stock, being descended in the direct male line from Matthieu de Rouvroy, surnamed Le Borgne, who fought at Crécy and Poitiers, and Marguerite de Saint-Simon. His immediate ancestors, a branch of the family which dropped the name of Rouvroy for that of Saint-Simon, if not exactly illustrious, followed their monarchs loyally in war and administered their estates successfully in peace. His father, Claude de Saint-Simon, who was born in 1607, chiefly owing to his address in the hunting field rose into high favour with Louis XIII, who created him a _duc et pair_ in 1636. But he fell into disgrace soon afterwards and was ordered by Richelieu to retire from the Court to the fortress of Blaye on the Gironde, of which he was governor. His vacillating attitude on the outbreak of the Fronde made him acceptable neither to Mazarin nor to the rebellious princes, and he did not return to Paris till after the troubles were over. In 1672 he married as his second wife Charlotte de l’Aubespine, by whom he had an only son, born on January 16, 1675, and christened Louis after his royal godfather. At the age of seven, the young Vidame de Chartres, according to the custom of many noble families, was put under the charge of a governor, but his character and opinions were largely moulded by his father and mother. The latter, a highly virtuous woman of method and good sense, applied herself assiduously to the development of his mind and body. From his father he imbibed a profound antipathy for Mazarin, the families of Lorraine, Bouillon, and Rohan, and all Secretaries of State.  In December, 1691, when he was nearly seventeen, he was formally presented to the King, and enrolled as a cadet in the regiment of the Grey Musketeers. In this capacity he took part in the siege of Namur, which is the first event recorded in his memoirs. In 1693, having been given the command of a company of cavalry, he fought at Neerwinden, and at the end of the campaign bought the colonelcy of a regiment. Shortly before this he had succeeded his father as governor of Blaye and Senlis. He was only nineteen, when he gave a signal proof of his energy and of the importance which he attached to matters of precedence, by helping to organise a resistance to the claim of the Maréchal de Luxembourg to take precedence of all _ducs et pairs_ except the Duc d’Uzès. The Dukes lost their case, largely, Saint-Simon alleges, owing to the partiality of the First President of the _Parlement_, Achille de Harlay.  In the following year (1695) he married Gabrielle de Durfort, the eldest daughter of the Maréchal-Duc de Lorges, a nephew of Turenne. She was a blonde with a fine complexion and figure, and being a modest and excellent woman made him an admirable wife. He on his side was a devoted husband, and he always speaks of her in his _Memoirs_ with the greatest affection and esteem.  After the Peace of Ryswick (1697) his regiment was disbanded, and, on the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, five years later, failing to receive a nomination as Brigadier, he retired from the service on the plea of ill-health. “Voilà encore un homme qui nous quitte,” said the King, and he looked coldly on Saint-Simon in consequence. It was characteristic of the little Duke’s overweening sense of his own importance that before taking this step he held a solemn consultation with six distinguished friends, the Chancellor Pontchartrain, and five Dukes, Lorges, Durfort-Duras, Choiseul, Beauvillier, and La Rochefoucauld, of whom the first three were Marshals of France.  The loss to the army was not irremediable, and the gain to literature was immense. Henceforth Saint-Simon could devote himself with singleness of purpose to the real business of his life. It was in July, 1694, in the camp of Germersheim on the Old Rhine, that “he began to write his memoirs,” by which expression we must understand, not that he began to write a continuous narrative, but that from this time he systematised his observations and inquiries and made careful notes of the results. We learn from a letter to his friend, M. de Rancé, the famous reformer of La Trappe, that his original intention was to relate in detail all personal matters and merely to touch superficially on general events. But he soon abandoned this"]]]
