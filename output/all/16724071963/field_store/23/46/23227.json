Estralla remembered that all those people in the stories were black; but who could tell but what there was some place in the world where white people were sold? Anyway, she resolved that wherever Missy Sylvia went she would go with her.  In a few moments she saw a chance to run over the gangplank. She went straight toward the cabin door and peered in. Yes, there was Missy Sylvia on the broad cushioned seat under the window. Very softly Estralla tiptoed across the cabin. Just as she was about to speak Sylvia's name the sound of approaching footsteps startled her, and, sure that she would be sent on shore by whoever might discover her, she looked about for a hiding-place, and the next instant she was curled up under the very seat on which Sylvia was asleep.  It was not long before Estralla followed her missy's example. But she was wide awake when Captain Carleton came into the cabin.  As soon as he returned to the deck Estralla crawled out from her hiding-place and looked about her. \"Wake up, Missy,\" she whispered leaning over Sylvia; and Sylvia sat up quickly, with a little cry of astonishment.  \"Don't you be skeered,\" said Estralla softly, \"'cause I ain' gwine to let you be carried off. I knows jes' how slaves are ketched. Yas'm, I does. My mammy tole me. They gits folks in ships and carries 'em off an' sells 'em to folks. An' I ain' gwine to let 'em have you, Missy.\" There were tears in Estralla's eyes. She knew that her own brother had been sold the previous year and taken to a plantation in Florida. She had heard her mother say that she, Estralla, might be sold any time. She knew that slavery was a dreadful thing.  \"Where are they taking us?\" questioned Sylvia, for she realized that the vessel was moving swiftly through the water. She wondered why Captain Carleton had gone away. Seeing Estralla there gave her a dreadful certainty that what the little darky said might be true. Perhaps the vessel might have others on board who were being taken off to be sold, as Estralla declared.  \"Yas, Missy. My mammy's tole me jes' how white folks gets black folks fer slaves. Takes 'em away from their mammies, an' never lets 'em go back. Yas!\" And Estralla's big eyes grew round with terror.  \"But I am a white girl, Estralla,\" said Sylvia.  Estralla shook her head dolefully.  \"Yas, Missy. But I'se gwine to git you safe home. You do jes' as I tell you an' you'll be safe back with your mammy by ter-morrow!\" she declared.  \"You lay down and keep your eyes tight shut till I comes back,\" she added, and Sylvia, tired and frightened, obeyed.  The schooner was now coming to her landing at Fort Sumter. Estralla managed to get on deck without being noticed. She did not know where they were, but wherever it was she resolved to get Sylvia out of the vessel, and ran back to the cabin.  \"Now, don' you speak to nobuddy. Jes' keep right close to me,\" she whispered. And Sylvia obeyed. The two little girls crept up the cabin stairs, and crouching close to the side of the cabin made their way toward the stern of the vessel.  The crew and the soldiers and Captain Carleton were now all toward the bow. A small boat swung at the stern of the schooner.  \"Now, Missy, we's got to git ourselves into that boat and row back home,\" whispered Estralla, grasping the rope.  At that moment Sylvia turned to look back. She could see a tall officer on the forward deck, and without an instant's hesitation she ran toward him calling:  \"Captain Carleton! Captain Carleton!\" He turned smilingly toward her, and Sylvia clasped his hand.  \"I didn't know where I was,\" she said.  \"You are at Fort Sumter. And it's all my fault,\" he answered. \"I forgot all about you until we were nearly here. But one of my men is going to sail you safely home. What's this?\" he added, as Estralla appeared by Sylvia's side.  \"It's Estralla. Her mammy is our cook,\" said Sylvia.  The Captain looked a little puzzled. He wondered how the little darky had got on board the vessel without being seen.  \"Well, she will be company for you. And you must ask your father and mother to forgive my carelessness in taking you so far from home,\" said the Captain.  It was sunset when Sylvia and Estralla, escorted by one of the soldiers from Fort Sumter, came walking up East Battery. Mrs. Fulton was on the piazza, and Mrs. Waite and Grace were with her. Grace was the first to see and recognize Sylvia, and with a cry of delight ran to welcome her.  The soldier had a note for Mrs. Fulton explaining that Sylvia, apparently on her way from school, had wandered down to the landing, and of Captain Carleton's forgetting her presence in the cabin, so that Sylvia was not questioned that night in regard to her disappearance from Miss Patten's. Grace knew nothing of Sylvia's encounter with Elinor Mayhew, so no one could imagine why she had started for home without a word to Miss Patten.  Mrs. Fulton was too rejoiced to have her little girl safely at home to question or blame her.  Sylvia was not hungry. The officer in charge of Fort Sumter had given the two children an excellent supper. But she was tired and very glad to have a warm bath and go straight to bed.  \"Oh, Mother! This has been the most horrid day in all my life,\" she said, as her mother brushed out the tangled yellow hair, and helped her prepare for bed.  \"It has been rather hard for your father and me,\" Mrs. Fulton reminded her; \"we began to fear some dreadful thing had happened to our little girl. Promise me, Sylvia, never to run away from school again.\"  Sylvia promised. She wished she could tell her mother that it was not school she ran away from; that she was trying to escape the taunts and unfriendliness of her schoolmates. But she remembered her promise. She had declared proudly that she should not tell, and hard as it was she resolved that she would keep that promise. But she wished with all her heart that she need not go to school another day.  \"Do I have to go to Miss Patten's school, Mother?\" she asked in so unhappy a voice that Mrs. Fulton realized something unpleasant had happened.  \"We will talk it over to-morrow, dear,\" she said; \"go to sleep now,\" and Sylvia crept into the white bed quite ready to sleep, but wondering how she could talk about going to school, and still keep her promise, when to-morrow came.     CHAPTER V  ESTRALLA AND ELINOR   In the morning Sylvia did not refer to what had happened the day before, so her mother decided not to question her. Grace and Flora both arrived at an early hour to accompany Sylvia to school. They were eager to hear how she had happened to be on the schooner which had carried arms to Fort Sumter from the Charleston Arsenal. But Sylvia did not seem to want to talk of her adventure, and both the little southern girls were too polite to question her.  \"Father says those guns don't belong to the United States, they belong to South Carolina.\"  Sylvia did not reply. She recalled one of her lessons, however, where she had learned that the United States meant each and every State in the Union and she remembered what Captain Carleton had said.  \"Mother says I may go with you on Saturday, Flora,\" interrupted Grace; \"I wish it was Friday this minute.\"  \"So do I,\" agreed Flora laughingly; \"and we must teach Sylvia to ride on one of the ponies this time.\"  For on the previous visit Sylvia had said that she wished she could ride as Flora did.  \"Oh! Truly? Flora, do you really mean it?\" Sylvia asked.  \"Of course I do. We will have a ride Saturday afternoon and again Sunday,\" replied Flora.  With the pleasure of the plantation visit in store Sylvia for the moment forgot all about her dread of facing the girls at school. Miss Patten detained her at the door of the schoolroom with a warmer greeting than usual, but said: \"My dear, I want to talk with you at recess;\" but her smile was so friendly and her words so kind that Sylvia was not troubled. As she passed Elinor's seat she did not look up, but the whisper, \"Yankee,\" made her flush, and brought back all her dislike of the tall, handsome Elinor.  At recess, after the other girls had left the schoolroom, Miss Patten came to Sylvia's desk and sat down beside her.  \"Sylvia, dear,\" she said gently, \"I want you to tell me why you started off alone yesterday. Had anything happened here at school to make you so unhappy that you did not want to stay?\"  Sylvia looked up in surprise. Why, Miss Patten seemed to know all about it, she thought. How easy it would be to tell her the whole story. But suddenly she resolved that no matter what Miss Patten knew, she, Sylvia, must not break her word. So she looked down at her desk, and made no reply.  \"I am sure none of the other pupils would mean to hurt your feelings, Sylvia. But if any of them have carelessly said something that sounded unkind, I know they will apologize,\" continued the friendly voice; and again Sylvia looked up. If she told what Elinor and May had said she was now sure that Miss Rosalie would make them both say they were sorry; and Sylvia remembered that she had declared to them that they should do exactly that.  \"Would they really, Miss Patten?\" she asked in so serious a voice that the teacher believed for the moment that she would soon know the exact reason why Sylvia had fled from the school; and she was right, she was about to hear it, but not from Sylvia. There was a little silence in the quiet pleasant room where the scent of jessamine and honey-suckle came through the open windows, and no sound disturbed the two at Sylvia's desk. Sylvia was assuring herself that she really ought to tell Miss Patten; but somehow she could not speak. If she broke a promise, even to an enemy, as she felt Elinor Mayhew to be, she would despise herself. But Elinor would have to apologize for the way she had treated Sylvia. Just at this moment of hesitation a round woolly head appeared at one of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5696"],["title","A Yankee Girl at Fort Sumter (#5)"],["body","open windows. Two small black hands rested on the window-sill, and a moment later Estralla, in her faded blue dress, was standing directly in front of Miss Patten and Sylvia.  \"I begs pardon, Missy Teacher. But I knows my missy ain't done nuffin' to be kept shut up for. An' I knows why she runned off yesterd'y. Yas'm. I heered dat tall dark girl an' nuther girl sayin' as how Missy Sylvia was a Yankee. Yas'm; and as how they was glad they called her names. Yas'm, I sho' heered 'em say those very words,\" and Estralla bobbed her head, and stood trembling in every limb before \"Missy Teacher,\" not knowing what would happen to her, but determined that the little white girl, who had protected her, and given her the fine pink dress, should not be punished.  \"Oh, Estralla!\" whispered Sylvia, her face brightening.  Miss Rosalie stood up, and rested her hand on Sylvia's shoulder.  \"And so you would not tell, or complain about your schoolmates?\" Then without waiting for a reply, she leaned over and kissed Sylvia. \"That is right, dear child. I am proud to have you as a pupil. Now,\" and she turned to Estralla, \"you run home as fast as you can go. Your young mistress is not being punished, and will not be. But you did just right in coming to tell me. But the next time you come remember to come in at the door!\" and Miss Rosalie smiled pleasantly at the little darky, whose face now was radiant with delight.  \"Yas'm. I sho' will 'member,\" and with a smile at Sylvia, Estralla tiptoed toward the open door and disappeared.  It was a very grave teacher who watched her pupils return to their seats that morning. It was a time when all the people in the southern city were anxious and troubled. There had always been slaves in South Carolina, and now the Government of the United States was realizing that the black people must not be kept in servitude; that they had the same rights as white people; and it was difficult for the Charleston people to acknowledge that this was right.  Miss Rosalie was a South Carolinian, and she was sure that Charleston people did right to insist on keeping their slaves, even if it meant war. And it now seemed likely that the North and South might come to warfare. The word \"Yankee\" was as hateful to Miss Rosalie as it was to Elinor Mayhew, and for that very reason she determined that Elinor should make a public apology for calling one of her schoolmates a \"Yankee.\" To the Carolinians the name meant the name of their enemies, and it seemed to Miss Rosalie a very dreadful thing to accuse this little northern girl of being an enemy.  After the girls were all seated she said in a very quiet tone:  \"Elinor, please come to the platform.\"  For a moment Elinor hesitated. Then she walked slowly down the aisle and stood beside Miss Patten.  \"Now, young ladies, I do not need to explain to you the meaning of the word 'courtesy.' You all know that it means kindness and consideration of the rights and feelings of others. You know as well the meaning of the word 'hospitality'; that it means that any person who is received beneath your roof is entitled to courtesy and to more than that, to protection. Even savages will protect any traveler who comes into their home, and give the best they have to make him comfortable.\" Miss Rosalie stopped a moment, and then said: \"If there is anyone of you who has not known the meaning of the two words to which I refer, will she please to rise.\"  The girls all remained seated.  \"Elinor, you will now apologize for having failed in courtesy and in hospitality to one of my pupils.\"  Elinor stood looking out across the schoolroom. Her mouth was tightly closed, and apparently she had no intention of obeying.  \"Do I have to apologize for speaking the truth?\" she demanded.  The girls held their breath. Was it possible that Elinor dared defy Miss Patten? Grace and Flora were sadly puzzled. They were the only pupils who did not understand the exact reason, Elinor's treatment of Sylvia, for Miss Patten's demand.  The teacher did not respond, and Elinor did not speak. Then after a moment Miss Patten said, \"Take your seat, Elinor. I shall make this request of you again at the beginning of the afternoon session. If you do not comply with it you will no longer be received as a pupil in this school.\"     CHAPTER VI  SYLVIA AT THE PLANTATION   When the afternoon session opened Elinor Mayhew was not in her usual place. Grace and Flora had been told by the other girls what had happened on the day of Sylvia's disappearance from school. May Bailey had declared that Sylvia must have \"run straight to the teacher,\" and that she was a telltale as well as a \"Yankee.\" Grace had defended her friend warmly.  \"I don't know how Miss Rosalie found out, but I'm sure Sylvia did not tell,\" she declared.  Flora was unusually quiet. There were many scornful looks sent in Sylvia's direction that afternoon, which Miss Patten noticed and easily understood. Before school was dismissed she said that she had a brief announcement to make.  \"I want to say to you that the pupil whom Elinor treated with such a lack of courtesy did not inform me of the fact. Nor would she say one word against any of her schoolmates when I questioned her. Someone who overheard Elinor's unfriendly remarks came and told me.\"  Flora Hayes smiled and drew a long breath. She did not blame Sylvia for being a \"Yankee,\" but it had troubled her to think of her new friend as a \"telltale,\" whatever her provocation might have been. The other girls began to look at Sylvia with more friendly eyes, and as they ran down the steps several found a chance to nod and smile at her, or to exchange some word. So Sylvia began to feel that her troubles were over, if Elinor Mayhew did not return to school.  \"Father, are you sure 'Yankee' doesn't mean anything beside 'American'?\" she asked in a very serious tone, as she sat beside Mr. Fulton on the piazza that evening. They were quite alone, as Mrs. Fulton had stepped to the kitchen to speak to Aunt Connie.  \"The girls at school all think it means something dreadful,\" she added.  \"Let me see, Sylvia. You study history, don't you?\" responded her father slowly. \"Of course you do; and you know that George Washington and General Putnam and General Warren, and many more brave men, defended this country and its liberty?\"  \"Why, yes,\" replied Sylvia, greatly puzzled.  \"The men of South Carolina were among the bravest and most loyal of the defenders of our liberties. And when America's enemies called American men 'Yankees' they meant General Washington and every other American who was ready to defend the United States of America. So if any of your friends use the word 'Yankee' scornfully they agree with the enemies of the Union. No one need be ashamed of being called a 'Yankee.' It means someone who is ready to fight for what is right.\"  But Sylvia still wondered. \"The girls don't think so,\" she said.  \"Well, that is because they don't understand. They will know when they are older,\" said Mr. Fulton. He did not imagine that any of the companions of his little daughter had treated her in an unfriendly fashion, and thought it a good opportunity to make her understand the real meaning of the word.  \"You are a Yankee girl. And that means you must always try to protect other people who need protection,\" said her father.  Sylvia's face brightened. She could easily understand that. It meant that she must not let Estralla get a whipping when she had not deserved it; and she was glad she had not told the real story of the broken pitcher. She resolved always to remember what her father had said.  The remainder of the week passed pleasantly. Elinor Mayhew did not return to school, and the other girls profited by her example and no longer teased or taunted the little northern girl.  Saturday morning proved to be perfect weather for the drive to the Hayes plantation. The sun shone, the clear October air was full of autumnal fragrance, and when the Hayes carry-all, drawn by two pretty brown horses, and driven by black Chris, the Hayes coachman, and Flora's black mammy on the seat beside him, stopped in front of Sylvia's house and Flora came running up the path, Sylvia and Grace were on the steps all ready to start.  There was plenty of room for all three girls on the back seat, and Flora declared that Sylvia should sit between Grace and herself. Mrs. Fulton and Estralla stood at the gate and watched the happy little party drive off. Estralla looked very sober. Ever since the adventure at Fort Sumter the little colored girl had felt that she must look after Missy Sylvia carefully. And she was not well pleased to see her young mistress disappear from her watchful eyes.  \"What a funny name 'Estralla' is,\" laughed Flora, as Sylvia called back a good-bye.  \"Oh, that isn't her name, really,\" explained Grace. \"You know my Uncle Robert owns her, and Auntie Connie named her after Aunt Esther and Cousin Alice. Her name is really Esther Alice. But the colored people never speak as we do.\"  \"How can anybody 'own' anybody else, even if their skin is black?\" asked Sylvia.  Both her companions looked at her in such evident surprise that Sylvia was sure she ought not to have asked such a question. Suddenly she remembered that Flora's \"Mammy\" and \"Uncle Chris,\" as Flora called him, were negroes, and of course must have heard. She resolved not to ask another question during her visit.  Their way took them through pleasant streets shaded by spice trees and an occasional oak. From behind high walls came the fragrance of orange blossoms, ripening pomegranates and grapes. Very soon they had crossed the Ashley River, and now the road ran between broad fields of cotton where negroes were already at work gathering the white fluffy crop which would be packed in bags and bales and shipped to many far distant ports.  The three little friends talked gaily of the pleasant visit which had just begun. Sylvia was hoping that Flora would again speak of the promised ride on one of"]]]
