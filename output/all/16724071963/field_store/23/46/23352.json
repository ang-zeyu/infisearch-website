So Hyde easily became the hero of the hour; he was permitted to teach the girls the charming old-world step of the Pas de Quatre, and afterwards to sing with them merry airs from Figaro, and sentimental airs from Lodoiska, and to make Rem's heart burn with anger at the expression he threw into the famous ballad \"My Heart and Lute\" which the trio sang twice over with great feeling.  Fortunately, some of Doctor Moran's neighbours called early in the evening. Then whist parties were formed; and while the tables were being arranged Cornelia found an opportunity to reason with Rem. \"I never could have believed you would behave so unlike yourself,\" she said; and Rem answered bluntly--\"That Englishman has insulted me ever since he came into the room.\"  \"He is not an Englishman,\" said Cornelia.  \"His father is an Englishman, and the man himself was born in England. The way he looks at me, the way he speaks to me, is insulting.\"  \"I have seen nothing but courtesy to you, Rem.\"  \"You have not the key to his impertinences. To-morrow, I will tell you something about Lieutenant Hyde.\"  \"I shall not permit you to talk evil of him. I have no wish to hear ill reports about my acquaintances, Their behaviour is their own affair; at any rate, it is not mine. Be good-tempered, Rem; you are to be my partner, and we must win in every game.\"  But though Cornelia was all sweetness and graciousness; though Rem played well, and Lieutenant Hyde played badly; though Rem had the satisfaction of watching Hyde depart in his chair, while he stood with a confident friendship by Cornelia's side, he was not satisfied. There was an air of weariness and constraint in the room, and the little stir of departing visitors did not hide it. Doctor Moran had been at an unusual social tension; he was tired, and not pleased at Rem for keeping him on the watch. Cornelia was silent. Rem then approached his sister and said, \"it is time to go home.\" Arenta looked at her friend; she expected to be asked to remain, and she was offended when Cornelia did not give her the invitation.  On the contrary, Cornelia went with her for her cloak and bonnet, and said not a word as they trod the long stairway but \"Oh dear! How warm the evening is!\"  \"I expected you would ask me to stay with you, Cornelia.\" Arenta was tying her bonnet strings as she made this remark, and her fingers trembled, and her voice was full of hurt feeling.  \"Rem behaved so badly, Arenta.\"  \"I think that is not so. Did I also behave badly?\"  \"You were charming every moment of the evening; but Rem was on the point of quarrelling with Lieutenant Hyde. You must have seen it. In my father's house, this was not proper.\"  \"I never saw Rem behave badly in my life. Suppose he does quarrel with that dandy Englishman, Rem would not get the worst of it. I have no fear for my brother Rem! No, indeed!\"  \"Bulk does not stand for much in a sword game.\"  \"Do you mean they might fight a duel?\"  \"I think it is best for you to go home with Rem. Otherwise, he might, in his present temper, find himself near Becker's; and if a man is quarrelsome he may always get principals and seconds there. You have told me this yourself. In the morning Rem will, I hope, be reasonable.\"  \"I thought you and I would talk things over to-night. I like to talk over a new pleasure.\"  \"Dear Arenta, we shall have so much more time, to-morrow. Come to-morrow.\"  But Arenta was not pleased. She left her friend with an air of repressed injury, and afterwards made little remarks about Cornelia to her brother, which exactly fitted his sense of wounded pride. Indeed, they stood a few minutes in the Van Ariens' parlour to exchange their opinions still further--  \"I think Cornelia was jealous of me, Rem. That, in plain Dutch, is what it all means. Does she imagine that I desire the attentions of a man who is neither an American nor a Dutchman? I do not. I speak the truth always, for I love the truth.\"  \"Cornelia does desire them; I think that--and it makes me wretched.\"  \"Oh, indeed, it is plain to see that she has fallen in love with that black-eyed man of many songs and dances. Well, then, we must admit that he danced to perfection. One may dislike the creature, and yet tell the truth.\"  \"Do you truly believe that Cornelia is in love with him?\"  \"Rem, there are things a woman observes. Cornelia is changed to-night. She did not wish me to stay and talk about this man Hyde--she preferred thinking about him--such reveries are suspicious. I have felt the symptom. But, however, I may be wrong. Perhaps Cornelia was angry at Hyde, and anxious about you--Do you think that?\"  Rem would not admit any such explanation; and, indeed, Arenta only made such suppositions to render more poignant those entirely contrary.  \"Ever since she was a little girl, twelve, eleven years old, I have loved her,\" said Rem; \"and she knows it.\"  \"She knows it; that is so. When I was at Bethlehem, I read her all your letters; and many a time you spoke in them of her as your 'little wife.' To be sure, it was a joke; but she understood that you, at least, put your heart in it. Girls do not need to have such things explained. Come, come, we must go to our rooms; for that is our father I hear moving about. In a few minutes he will be angry, and then--\"  She did not finish the sentence; there was no necessity; Rem knew what unpleasantness the threat implied, and he slipped off his shoes and stole quietly upstairs. Arenta was not disinclined to a few words if her father wished them; so she did not hurry, though the great Flemish clock on the stair-landing chimed eleven as she entered her room. It was an extraordinarily late hour, but she only smiled, as she struck her pretty fore-fingers together in time with it. She was not disposed to curtail the day; it was her method, always, to take the full flavour of every event that was not disagreeable.  \"And, after all,\" she mused, \"the evening was a possibility. It was a door on the latch--I may push it open and go in--who can tell? I saw how amazed he was at my beauty when I first entered the parlour--and he is but a man--and a young man who likes his own way--so much is evident.\" She was meanwhile unclasping her pearl necklace, and at this point she held it in her hands taking the fourth bead between her fingers, and smiled speculatively.  Then she heard her brother moving about the floor of the room above her, and a shadow darkened her face. She had strong family affections, and she was angry that Rem should be troubled by any man or woman, living:  \"I have always thought Cornelia a very saint,\" she muttered; \"but Love is the great revealer. I wonder if she is in love--to tell the truth, she was past finding out. I cannot say that I saw the least sign of it--and between me and myself, Rem was unreasonable; however, I am not pleased that Rem felt himself to be badly used.\"  It was to this touch of resentment in her drifting thoughts that she performed her last duties. She did not hurry them. \"Very soon there will be the noise of chairmen and carriages to disturb me,\" she thought; \"and I may as well think a little, and put my things away.\"  So she folded each dainty blue morocco slipper in its separate piece of fine paper, and straightened out her ribbons, and wrapped her pale blue robe in its holland covering, and put every comb and pin in its proper place, all the time treading as softly as a mouse. And by and by the street was dark and still, and her room in the most perfect order. These things gave her the comfort of a good conscience; and she said her prayers, and fell calmly asleep, to the flattering thought, \"I would not much wonder if, at this moment, Lieutenant Hyde is thinking about me.\"  In reality, Lieutenant Hyde was at that moment in the Belvedere Club, singing the Marseillaise, and listening to a very inflammatory speech from the French Minister. But a couple of hours later, Arenta's \"wonder\" would have touched the truth. He was then alone, and very ill satisfied; for, after some restless reflections, he said impatiently--  \"I have again made a fool of myself. I have now all kinds of unpleasant feelings; and when I left that good Doctor's house I was well satisfied. His daughter is an angel. I praise myself for finding that out. She made me believe in all goodness; yes, even in patriotism! I, that have seen it sold a dozen times! Oh, how divinely shy and proud she is! I could not get her one step beyond the first civilities; even my eyes failed me to-night--her calm glances killed their fire--and she barely touched my hand, though I offered it with a respectful ardour, she must have understood:\"--then he looked admiringly at the long, white hand and thoroughbred wrist which lay idly on the velvet cushion of his armchair; an exquisite ruffle of lace just touched it, and his eyes wandered from the ruffle to the velvet and silver embroidery of his coat; and the delicate laced lawn of his cravat.  \"I have the reputation of beauty,\" he continued; \"and I am perfectly dressed, and yet--yet--this little Beauty seemed unconscious of my advantages. But I cannot accept failure in this case. The girl is unparagoned. I am in love with her; sincerely in love. She fills my thoughts, and has done so, ever since I first saw her. It is a pure delight to think of her.\"  Then he rose, threw off his velvet and lace, and designedly let his thoughts turn to Arenta. \"She is pretty beyond all prettiness,\" he said softly as he moved about, \"She dances well, talks from hand to mouth, and she gave me one sweet glance; and I think if she has gone so far--she might go further.\" At this reflection he smiled again, and lifting a decanter slowly poured into a goblet some amber-coloured sherry; saying--   \"I dare not yet drink to the unapproachable Cornelia; but I may at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5757"],["title","The Maid of Maiden Lane (#4)"],["body","pour the wine to the blue-eyed goddess, with the pearl necklace, and the golden hair;\" and as he lifted the glass, a memory from some past mirthful hour came into his remembrance; and he began to hum a strain of the song it brought to his mind--                   \"Let the toast pass,                    Drink to the lass      I'll warrant, she'll prove an excuse for the glass.\"  It was remarkable that he did not take Arenta's brother into his speculations at all, and yet Rem Van Ariens was at that very hour chafing restlessly and sleeplessly under insults he conceived himself to have received, in such fashion and under such circumstances as made reprisal impossible. In reality, however, Van Ariens had not been intentionally wounded by Hyde. The situation was the natural result of incipient jealousy and sensitive pride on Rem's part; and of that calm indifference and complaisance on Hyde's part, which appeared tacitly to assert its own superiority and expect its recognition as a matter of course. Indeed, at their introduction, Rem had affected Hyde rather pleasantly; and when the young Dutch gentleman's opposition became evident, Hyde had simply ignored it. For as yet the thought of Rem as a rival had not entered his mind.  But this is the way of Love; its filmiest threads easily spin themselves further; and a man once entangled is bound by that unseen chain which links the soul to its destiny.     CHAPTER III  HYDE AND ARENTA   Seldom is Love ushered into any life with any pomp of circumstance or ceremony; there is no overture to our opera, no prologue to our play, and the most momentous meetings occur as if by mere accident. A friend delayed Cornelia a while on the street; and turning, she met Hyde face to face; a moment more, or less, and the meeting had not been. Ah, but some Power had set that moment for their meeting, and the delay had been intended, and the consequences foreseen!  In a dim kind of way Hyde realized this fact as he sat the next day with an open book before him. He was not reading it; he was thinking of Cornelia--of her pure, fresh beauty; and of that adorable air of reserve, which enhanced, even while it veiled her charms. \"For her love I could resign all adventures and prison myself in a law book,\" he said, \"I could forget all other beauties; in a word, I could marry, and live in the country. Oh how exquisite she is! I lose my speech when I think of her!\"  Then he closed his book with impatience, and went to Prince's and bought a little rush basket filled with sweet violets. Into their midst he slipped his visiting card, and saw the boy on his way with the flowers to Cornelia ere he was satisfied they would reach her quickly enough. This finished, he began to consider what he should do with his day. Study was impossible; and he could think of nothing that was possible. \"It is the most miserable thing,\" he muttered, \"to be in love, unless you can go to the adored one, every hour, and tell her so,\"--then turning aimlessly into Pearl Street, he saw Cornelia.  She was dressed only in a little morning gown of Indian chintz, but in such simple toilet had still more distinctively that air of youthful modesty which he had found so charmingly tantalizing. He hasted to her side. He blessed his good angel for sending him such an enchanting surprise. He said the most extravagant things, in the most truthful manner, as he watched the blushes of pleasure come and go on her lovely face, and saw by glimpses, under the veiling eyelids, that tender light that never was on sea or land, but only on a woman's face when her soul is awakening to Love.  Cornelia was going to the \"Universal Store\" of Gerardus Duyckinck, and Hyde begged to go with her. He said he was used to shopping; that he always went with his mother, and with Lady Christina Griffin, and Mrs. White, and many others; that he had good taste, and could tell the value of laces, and knew how to choose a piece of silk, or match the crewels for her embroidery; and, indeed, pleaded his case so merrily, that there was no refusing his offer. And how it happened lovers can tell, but after the shopping was finished they found themselves walking towards the Battery with the fresh sea wind, and the bright sunshine and the joy of each other's presence all around them.  \"Such a miraculous piece of happiness!\" the young fellow ejaculated; and his joy was so evident that Cornelia could not bear to spoil it with any reluctances, or with half-way graciousness. She fell into his joyous mood, and as star to star vibrates light, so his soul touched her soul, through some finer element than ordinary life is conscious of. A delightsome gladness was between them, and their words had such heart gaiety, that they seemed to dance as they spoke; while the wind blowing Cornelia's curls, and scarf, and drapery, was like a merry playfellow.  Now Love has always something in it of the sea; and the murmur of the tide against the pier, the hoarse voices of the sailor men, the scent of the salt water, and all the occult unrecognized, but keenly felt life of the ocean, were ministers to their love, and forever and ever blended in the heart and memory of the youth and maid who had set their early dream of each other to its potent witchery. Time went swiftly, and suddenly Cornelia remembered that she was subject to hours and minutes, A little fear came into her heart, and closed it, and she said, with a troubled air, \"My mother will be anxious. I had forgotten. I must go home.\" So they turned northward again, and Cornelia was silent, and the ardour of her lover was a little chilled; but yet never before had Cornelia heard simple conversation which seemed so eloquent, and so full of meanings--only, now and then, a few brief words; but oh! what long, long thoughts, they carried with them!  At the gates of her home they stood a moment, and there Hyde touched her hand, and said, \"I have never, in all my life, been so happy. It has been a walk beyond hope, and beyond expression!\" And she lifted her face, and the smile on her lips and the light in her eyes answered him. Then the great white door shut her from his sight, and he walked rapidly away, saying to his impetuous steps--  \"An enchanting creature! An adorable girl! I have given her my heart; and lost, is lost; and gone, is gone forever. That I am sure of. But, by St. George! every man has his fate, and I rejoice that mine is so sweet and fair! so sweet! so sweet! so fair!\"  Cornelia trembled as she opened the parlour door, she feared to look into her mother's face, but it was as serene as usual, and she met her daughter's glance with one of infinite affection and some little expectancy. This was a critical moment, and Cornelia hesitated slightly. Some little false sprite put a ready excuse into her heart, but she banished it at once, and with the courage of one who fears lest they are not truthful enough, she said with a blunt directness which put all subterfuge out of the question--  \"Mother, I have been a long time, but I met Lieutenant Hyde, and we walked down to the Battery; and I think I have stayed beyond the hour I ought to have stayed--but the weather was so delightful.\"  \"The weather is very delightful, and Lieutenant Hyde is very polite. Did he speak of the violets he sent you?\"  \"I suppose he forgot them. Ah, there they are! How beautiful! How fragrant! I will give them to you, mother.\"  \"They are your own, my dear. I would not give them away.\"  Then Cornelia lifted them, and shyly buried her face in their beauty and sweetness; and afterwards took the card in her hand and read \"Lieutenant George Hyde.\" \"But, mother,\" she said, \"Arenta called him Joris.\"  \"Joris is George, my dear.\"  \"Certainly, I had forgotten. Joris is the Dutch, George is the English form. I think I like George better.\"  \"As you have neither right nor occasion to call him by either name, it is of no consequence Take away your flowers and put them in water--the young man is very extravagant, I think. Do you know that it is quite noon, and your father will be home in a little while?\"  And there was such kind intent, such a divining sympathy in the simple words, that Cornelia's heart grew warm with pleasure; and she felt that her mother understood, and did not much blame her. At the same time she was glad to escape all questioning, and with the violets pressed to her heart, and her shining eyes dropped to them, she went with some haste to her room. There she kissed the flowers, one by one, as she put them in the refreshing water; and then, forgetting all else, sat down and permitted herself to enter the delicious land of Reverie. She let the thought of Hyde repossess her; and present again and again to her imagination his form, his face, his voice, and those long caressing looks she had seen and felt, without seeming to be aware of them.  A short time after Cornelia came home, Doctor Moran returned from his professional visits. As he entered the room, his wife looked at him with a curious interest. In the first place, the tenor of her thoughts led her to this observation. She wished to assure herself again that the man for whom she had given up everything previously dear to her was worthy of such sacrifice. A momentary glance satisfied her. Nature had left the impress of her nobility on his finely-formed forehead; nothing but truth and kindness looked from his candid eyes; and his manner, if a little dogmatic, had also an unmistakable air of that distinction which comes from long and honourable ancestry and a recognized position. He had also this morning an air of unusual solemnity, and on entering the room, he drew his wife close to his heart and kissed her affectionately, a token of love he was not apt to give without thought, or under every circumstance.  \"You are a little earlier to day,\" she said. \"I am glad of it.\"  \"I have had a morning full of feeling. There is no familiarity with Death, however often you meet him.\"  \"And you have met Death"]]]
