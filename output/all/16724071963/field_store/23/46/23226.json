The little darky chuckled and laughed now as if she had not a trouble in the world.  \"Listen, Estralla! Here, pick up every bit of the pitcher and put the pieces on the chair. Nobody shall know that you broke it. And now you take this wet towel and your dress and spread them somewhere outdoors to dry. You can tell your mammy I gave you the dress. Now, run quick. My mother may come.\"  Estralla stood quite still looking at Sylvia. She had stopped laughing.  \"Will you' mammy scold you 'bout dat pitcher?\" she asked.  \"I don't know. Anyway, nobody shall know that you broke it. You won't be whipped. Run along,\" urged Sylvia.  But Estralla did not move. \"I don't keer if I is whipped,\" she announced. \"I guess, mebbe, my mammy won't whip hard.\"  \"Sylvia, Sylvia,\" sounded her mother's voice, and both the little girls looked at each other with startled eyes.  \"Run,\" said Sylvia, giving Estralla a little push. \"Run out on the balcony.\" Estralla did not question the command, and in a moment, carrying dress and towel, she had vanished through the open window.  \"Why, child! What has happened?\" exclaimed Mrs. Fulton, coming into the room and looking at the overturned footstool, the pieces of the broken pitcher, and at Sylvia standing in the middle of the floor with an anxious, half-frightened expression.  \"Don't look so frightened, dear child. A broken pitcher isn't worth it,\" said Mrs. Fulton smilingly. \"It's only hot water, and won't hurt anything. Only Father is waiting for breakfast, so use cold water this morning. Here is your blue muslin--I'll tie your sash when you come down,\" and giving Sylvia a kiss her mother hurried away.  \"My landy!\" whispered Estralla, peering in from the balcony window. \"Your mammy's a angel. An' so is you, Missy. I was gwine tell her the trufe if she'd scolded, I su'ly was. Landy! I'd a sight ruther be whipped than have you scolded, Missy.\"  Sylvia looked at her in astonishment. Estralla, with round serious eyes, stood gazing at her as if she was ready to do anything that Sylvia could possibly ask.  \"Run. It's all right,\" said Sylvia with a little smile, and Estralla, with a backward look over her shoulder, went slowly out of the room.  \"I'm gwine to recollect this jes' as long as I live,\" Estralla whispered as she made her way back to the kitchen. \"Nobuddy ever cared if I was whipped before, or if I wasn't whipped. An' I'll do somethin' fer Missy sometime, I will. An' she give me dis fine dress too.\" She bent over and smoothed out one of the little ruffles, and chuckled happily.  Her mammy was busy preparing breakfast when Estralla slid quietly into the kitchen. When she did look around and saw the child wearing the pink dress she nearly dropped the dish of hot bacon which Jennie was waiting to take to the dining-room.  \"Wha' on earth did you get you' pink dress? Did Missy give it to you? Well, you step out to the cabin and take it off. This minute! Put you' blue frock right on. Like as not her mammy won't let you keep it,\" and Aunt Connie hurried Jennie off to the dining-room with the breakfast tray.  Estralla did not know what to do. Her blue dress was hung over a syringa bush behind the cabin. And at the dreadful thought that Mrs. Fulton might take away the pink dress she began to cry.  \"Missy Sylvia said 'twas faded. She said to put it on,\" whimpered Estralla.  Aunt Connie began to be more hopeful. If the dress was faded--and she turned and looked at it more closely.  \"Well, honey, 'tis faded. An' I guess Missy Sylvia's mammy won' take it back. An' it's the Sabbath day, so you jes' wear it,\" she said, patting the little woolly head. \"Mammy's glad to have you dressed up; but you be mighty keerful.\"  \"Yas, Mammy. I jes' love Missy Sylvia,\" replied the little girl, now all smiles, and forgetting how nearly she had come to serious trouble.  Nothing more was said to Sylvia about the broken pitcher; but when Jennie put the room in order, and brought down the broken pieces, Aunt Connie exclaimed: \"Good massy! It's a good thing my Estralla didn't do that! I'd 'a' cuffed her well, I su'ly would.\"  Sylvia did not think to tell her mother about the gift of the pink dress to Estralla. She did not feel quite happy that she had not explained the broken pitcher to her mother; but she had promised Estralla that she would not tell, and Sylvia knew that a promise was a very serious thing, something not to be easily forgotten.  She did not see Estralla again that day, and Jennie brought the hot water as usual the next morning.  Grace and Mammy Esther called for Sylvia on Monday morning, and Sylvia at once told her friend that she had been named from the song. This seemed very wonderful to Grace, and she listened to Sylvia's explanation of \"excelling\" instead of \"spelling,\" and said she didn't think it was of any consequence.  But when Sylvia told her what Captain Carleton had said about the forts, Grace shook her head and looked very serious.  \"Don't tell Elinor Mayhew, Sylvia. Because really South Carolina does own the forts. My father said so. He said that South Carolina was a Sovereign State,\" she concluded.  \"What's that? What's a 'sovereign'?\" questioned Sylvia.  Grace shook her head. It had sounded like a very fine thing when her father had spoken it, so she had repeated it with great pride.  \"We can ask Miss Rosalie,\" she suggested.  Mammy Esther left the girls at the gate of Miss Patten's garden. As they went up the path Flora Hayes came to meet them.  \"I was waiting for you,\" she said. \"I want to ask you both to come out to our plantation next Saturday and spend Sunday. My mother is going to write and ask your mothers if they will give me the pleasure of your company.\"  \"I am sure I can come,\" declared Grace, \"and I think it's lovely of you to ask me.\"  \"You'll come, won't you, Sylvia?\" said Flora, putting her arm over the little girl's shoulders as they went up the steps.  \"Yes, indeed; thank you very much for asking me,\" replied Sylvia. She had visited the Hayes plantation early in the summer, and thought it a more wonderful place even than the big mansion on Tradd Street where the Hayes family lived in the winter months. Mr. Hayes owned hundreds of negroes, and raised a great quantity of cotton. The house at the plantation was large, with many balconies, and cool, pleasant rooms. Flora had a pair of white ponies, and there were pigeons, and a number of dogs. Sylvia was sure that it would be a beautiful visit, especially as Grace would be there.  As she went smilingly toward her seat in the schoolroom she passed Elinor Mayhew, who was already seated.  \"Yankee!\" whispered Elinor sharply, looking at her with scornful eyes.  But Sylvia, remembering that her father had said that all Americans were Yankees, nodded to the older girl and responded: \"Yankee your-self!\"     CHAPTER III  SYLVIA IN TROUBLE   The Hayes plantation was about ten miles distant from Charleston, on the opposite side of the Ashley River. Flora told Sylvia and Grace that the Hayes coachman would drive them out, and that they would start early on Saturday morning. Sylvia, remembering her former visit, knew well how delightful the drive would be, and thinking of the pleasure in store quite forgot to be troubled by Elinor Mayhew's hostility.  At recess the girls usually walked about in the garden, or tossed a ball back and forth. Miss Rosalie would sit on the broad piazza overlooking the garden, her fingers busy with some piece of delicate embroidery.  To-day, as they filed out and down the steps, Elinor whispered to several of her companions. And suddenly Sylvia realized that she was standing alone. Grace Waite had lingered to speak to Miss Rosalie; Flora had been excused just before recess, as her black mammy had arrived with a note from Mrs. Hayes. The other girls were gathered in a little group about Elinor, who was evidently telling them something of great interest. Sylvia walked slowly along toward a little summer-house where Miss Patten sometimes had little tea-parties. She hoped Grace would not stay long with Miss Patten. The other girls were between Sylvia and the arbor, and none of them moved to let her pass; nor did any of them speak to her, as she paused with a word of greeting.  \"Now, girls,\" she heard Elinor say; and the others, half under their breath, but only too distinctly for Sylvia, called out: \"Yankee, Yankee!\" Then like a flock of bright-colored birds they ran swiftly into the summer-house.  For a moment Sylvia stood quite still. She realized that Elinor meant to be hateful; but she remembered that her father had said that all Americans were called \"Yankees,\" and she was not a coward. She went straight on to the arbor. Elinor Mayhew stood on the steps.  \"You are just as much a Yankee as I am. And you ought to be proud of it,\" declared Sylvia, facing the older girl.  \"Hear that, girls!\" called Elinor to the group about her. There was a little angry murmur from the others.  \"Don't you dare say that again, Miss Boston,\" called May Bailey, who stood next to Elinor.  Sylvia was now thoroughly angry. She knew of no reason why these girls should treat her in so unkind a fashion. She felt very desolate and unhappy, but she faced them bravely.  \"Yankees! Yankees! It's what all Americans are,\" she declared defiantly.  In an instant the little girls were all about her. Elinor Mayhew was holding her hands, and the others were pushing her along the path to the shore. The thick growing shrubs hid them from the house. Sylvia did not cry out or speak. She was not at all afraid, nor did she resist.  \"We ought to make her take it back,\" said May Bailey, as Elinor stopped, and they all stood in a close group about Sylvia.  \"Of course she's got to take it back, and apologize on her knees,\" declared Elinor. \"She might as well learn that South Carolinians will not be insulted,\" and Elinor lifted her head"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5696"],["title","A Yankee Girl at Fort Sumter (#3)"],["body","oudly.  \"I won't take it back!\" retorted Sylvia, \"and you are the ones who will have to apologize. Yes, every one of you, before I will ever speak to you again.\"  \"Hear that, girls! Wouldn't it be dreadful if she never spoke to us again!\" sneered Elinor.  \"She means she will tell Miss Rosalie,\" said one of the girls.  \"I don't, either. I can look after my own afffairs,\" retorted Sylvia bravely. \"I'm not a tell-tale. Although I suppose girls who act the way you do would tell.\"  \"Get down on your knees,\" commanded Elinor, trying to push the little girl.  \"There's the bell,\" and they all turned and scampered back to the house, leaving Sylvia on the path; for Elinor had let go of her so suddenly that she had fallen forward.  Her knees were hurt, and one of her hands was bruised by the fall. For a moment she lay sobbing quietly. She was angry and miserable. She had been brave enough when the girls had seemed to threaten her, but now her courage was gone. She could not go back to the schoolroom and face all those enemies. If Miss Rosalie came in search of her she might not be able to resist telling her what had happened; and, miserable and unhappy as she was, Sylvia resolved that she would never tell.  \"But Elinor Mayhew and all the rest of them shall be sorry for this. Yes, they shall,\" she sobbed as she got to her feet and turned toward the shore. She knew she must either go straight back to the schoolroom or else find a hiding-place until they had ceased to search for her. There was a wall at the foot of the garden, covered with fragrant jessamine and myrtle. If she could only get over that wall, thought Sylvia, she would be safe. She ran swiftly forward and began to scramble up, grasping the sturdy vines, and finding a foothold on some bit of rough brick. She reached the top just as she heard Miss Rosalie's servant calling her name.  Sylvia looked down to the further side. The vines drooped over and below the wall a high bank of sand sloped to the shore. Holding tight to the vines she slid down, hitting her bruised knees against the rough surface. The vines cut her hands, and when she tumbled into the sand her dress was torn and soiled, her pretty hair-ribbon was gone, and her once white stockings were grimy. Beside these misfortunes her hands were bleeding. Never in all her life had Sylvia been so wretched. She sat quite still in the warm sand, and wondered what she could do. If she went home her mother would insist upon an explanation of her untidy condition. Beside that Sylvia was not sure if she could find her way home unless she climbed back into the garden. She looked along the shore at the landing-place not far distant where several boats were bobbing up and down in the wash of the incoming tide. She could see boats coming and going between the forts and the city. She could see grim Fort Sumter, with its guns that seemed to look straight at her. She watched a schooner coming across the bay, and realized that it was coming to that very wharf. A number of men landed, and several carts came down and boxes were unloaded, and negroes carried them to the schooner.  Sylvia got up and walked along the shore until she was near the wharf, and stood watching the negroes as they lifted the heavy boxes. She wished she could ask one of them to tell her the way home. Then she noticed a tall figure in uniform coming up the wharf.  \"It's Captain Carleton!\" she exclaimed joyfully, quite forgetting for the moment her torn dress and scratched hands as she ran toward him.  \"Why! Is it Sylvia Fulton?\" exclaimed the surprised Captain, looking down at the untidy little figure. \"Why, what has happened?\"  \"Oh, dear,\" sobbed Sylvia, \"I guess I'm lost.\"  \"Well, well! It's lucky you came down to this wharf. Come on board the schooner, and we'll see to these little hands first thing,\" and the good-natured Captain rested a kindly hand on the little girl's shoulder and walked down the wharf. Sylvia heard the men talking of the Charleston Arsenal, and of the boxes of arms which were to be taken on the schooner to Fort Sumter.  The Captain bathed the little hurt hands and flushed face, talking pleasantly to the little girl about the schooner, and asking her if she did not think it a much finer craft than her father's small boat; so in a little while she was comforted and quite at home.  \"Now, sit here by the cabin window, and I will come back and take you home as soon as I settle this trouble about my supplies,\" and the Captain hurried back to the wharf.  Sylvia sat quite still and looked out of the round port-hole. She felt very tired, and leaned her head against the cushioned wall. She could hear the monotonous chant of the negroes, and feel the swaying motion of the vessel, and soon was fast asleep. She did not know when the schooner was towed out into the channel, nor when the sails were hoisted and they went sailing down the bay.  For Captain Carleton had entirely forgotten his little guest. When he hurried back to the wharf he discovered a little group of Charleston citizens, one of whom was Elinor Mayhew's father, disputing the right of the United States officers to take guns from the Charleston Arsenal to Fort Sumter; and when the matter was settled he had hurried the departure of the vessel. Not until they were ready to land at the fort did he remember his little friend. He went down to the cabin, and found Sylvia fast asleep.  \"Poor little Yankee! I wonder what will happen to her if South Carolina really leaves the Union,\" he thought, and then his face grew troubled as he remembered that Mr. and Mrs. Fulton must be in great trouble and anxiety over the disappearance of their little daughter. But first of all he must see the schooner's cargo safely unloaded at Fort Sumter, and send his men back to Fort Moultrie; then he would take Sylvia home, or find some way to notify her parents that she was safe and well cared for.     CHAPTER IV  AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY   When Sylvia did not come in with the other girls Miss Patten sent a maid in search of her. But she did not search very carefully. She called Sylvia's name a few times, sauntered about the garden, and then reported: \"Can't find Missy Sylvia.\"  She was then told to go straight to Mrs. Fulton's house on the East Battery and see if Miss Sylvia had reached home. Miss Patten did not feel anxious. She thought it probable that the little northern girl did not realize the rules of the school, had become tired, and so started for home.  \"Did Miss Sylvia say anything to any of you young ladies about leaving the grounds?\" she questioned the pupils. But they all declared that they knew nothing of her whereabouts.  \"She was on the path behind us when the bell rang,\" volunteered May Bailey.  Elinor's face was unusually flushed, and she kept her eyes on her book. Probably the \"little Yankee,\" as she called Sylvia even in her thoughts, had run home to tell her mother of the trouble.  By the time Miss Patten's messenger had reached the Fulton house Sylvia was in the cabin of the little schooner. The girl gave her message to Mrs. Fulton in so indefinite a manner that at first Sylvia's mother hardly understood whether Sylvia was in the garden of the school, or had started for home. Estralla was standing near the steps and began whimpering: \"Oh, Missy Sylvia los'! That w'at she say. She lost!\"  \"Nonsense, Estralla! Sylvia could not be lost in Miss Patten's garden,\" said Mrs. Fulton; but she decided to return to the school with the maid.  As they went down the street Estralla followed close behind. Her bare feet made no noise, but now and then she choked back a despairing little wail. For the little colored girl was sure that some harm had befallen her new friend.  When Mrs. Fulton appeared at the school-room door Miss Patten was greatly alarmed. Elinor Mayhew and May Bailey exchanged a look of surprised apprehension. They felt sure that Sylvia had hurried home and told her mother just what had happened. If she had, and Mrs. Fulton had come to inform Miss Patten, they knew there would be unpleasant things in store for them.  In a short time a thorough search for the lost girl was in progress. Servants were sent along the streets, and Mrs. Fulton hastened home thinking it possible that Sylvia might be in her own room.  No one paid any attention to the little colored girl in the faded blue cotton gown who wandered about the paths and around the summer-house. Estralla noticed two of the older girls talking together, and heard the taller one say: \"Well, wherever she is, she needn't think we will ever take back one word. She IS a Yankee!\"  \"They'se done somethin' to my missy,\" decided Estralla. \"They'se scairt her.\" She ran down the path toward the wall at the end of the garden, and stopped suddenly; for right in front of her, caught on the jessamine vine which grew over the wall, she saw a fluttering blue ribbon. \"Dat's off'n Missy Sylvia's hair, dat ribbon is,\" she whispered, reaching up for it. Holding it fast in her hands she looked closely at the mass of heavy vines, and nodded her little woolly head. \"Dat's w'at she done. She dumb right up here, to git away frum those imps o' Satan w'at was a plaguein' her,\" decided Estralla, and in an instant she was going up the wall in a much easier manner than had been possible for Sylvia. She dropped on the further side, just as Sylvia had done, and traced Sylvia's steps to near the landing-place. Then she stopped short. Men were loading boxes on a schooner at the end of the pier, and she could see a tall officer in uniform standing on the deck of the vessel.  \"Hullo, here's another small girl. Black one this time,\" said one of the white sailors.  \"Yas, Massa! Please whar' is my missy?\" replied the little darky eagerly.  \"Safe in the cabin,\" nodded the good-natured man.  Estralla slipped behind a pile of boxes, and watched for a chance to get on board the vessel without being seen. She had heard many tales, told by the older colored people, of little"]]]
