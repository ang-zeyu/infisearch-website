So much the worse for her; he was the Emperor.  As for Barbara, with the subtle power of presentiment of a loving heart she felt that his passion was waning, and tortured her mobile intellect to discover the right cause.  If the luckless star was connected with it, why had he not blamed her openly?  No, no!  Adrian had already predicted it; his constancy could not be relied upon, and if war was in prospect he forgot everything that was usually dear to his heart, and the appearance of the Duke of Saxony certainly seemed to indicate an outbreak.  Many an intimation of the Emperor, Granvelle, and the almoner seemed to suggest this, and, deeply troubled, she went to rest.  During the silent night her worst fears became certainty.  She recalled to mind every hour which they had spent alone together. Some change had certainly taken place in him of late.  During her visit as a page the passion of former days had once more glowed hotly, as the fire on the hearth blazes up brightly before it expires.  The alteration had begun with the reproaches for her visit to the suffering Wolf.  Now he was aiming to rid himself of her, though with a considerate hand.  And she, what could she do to win back the man who held every fixed resolve as firmly as the rocks of the cliff hold the pine which grows from them?  Nothing, except to bear patiently whatever he inflicted upon her.  This, however, seemed to her so impossible and painful, so humiliating and shocking, that she sprang from her bed and for a long time paced with bare feet the sleeping-room, which was but dimly lighted by the lamp. Yet all her thoughts and pondering were futile, and when she lay down again she slept until mass.  By daylight she found that she had regarded matters in far too dark a light.  True, Charles probably no longer loved her as ardently as before, yet she need scarcely fear the worst at present.  But the bare thought of having so soon lost the power to bind him to her aroused a storm of feeling in her passionate soul, and when it subsided bitter thoughts followed, and a series of plans which, on closer examination, proved impracticable.  The day dragged slowly along.  During the ride in the country she was so depressed and downcast that her companions asked what troubled her.  The lonely evening seemed endless.  A short letter from her father, which informed her that he had not expected too much of himself, and was in good health, she cast aside after reading.  During the night the feeling of unhappiness and apprehension increased.  But the next morning the sun shone brightly into her windows, and after mass a messenger from the Golden Cross announced that Duke Maurice of Saxony had arrived, and in the afternoon his Majesty wished to see her and hear her sing.  This news cheered her wonderfully; but while Fran Lerch was dressing her she, too, missed the star, and it seemed to Barbara that with it she had lost a portion of her charm.  In going out, the marquise met her in the corridor, but Barbara passed without returning her greeting.  When she arrived, the company had assembled in the chapel.  The Duke of Saxony sat between the Emperor and Granvelle.  What a handsome, knightly man this Maurice was!  A prince from head to foot, young, and yet, while talking with the Emperor and Granvelle, grave and self-possessed as if he felt himself their peer.  And what fire glowed in his bright glance whenever it rested upon her!  In the chase and over the wine-cup this brave soldier and subtle statesman was said scarcely to have his equal.  Many tales of his successes with fair women had been told her.  He pleased her, too, in spite of the bold, free manner in which he gazed at her, and which she would not have tolerated in any one else.  After she had finished the last song, the duke expressed his appreciation in gay, flattering words, at the same time complimenting her beauty.  There had been something remarkably winning in his compliments; but when she pleased her imperial lover, the acknowledgment was very different. Then there was no mere praise clad in the form of enthusiastic homage, but in addition always acute remarks.  With the recognition blended opinions which revealed the true connoisseur.  This Maurice was certainly wise and brave, and, moreover, far handsomer than his imperial master; but what illumined Charles's prominent brow and brilliant eyes she had never beheld in any one else.  To him, to him alone her heart belonged, worthy of esteem as the duke, who was so much his junior, appeared.  While taking leave the Saxon held her hand in his for a time and, as she permitted it, she met a glance from her lover which warned her to be ware of incautious familiarity with this breaker of hearts.  Barbara felt as if a sudden brightness had filled her soul, and on her way home the seed which that look had cast into it began to put forth vigorous shoots.  The ardent young Saxon duke would have been a dangerous rival for any one, even the handsomest and most powerful of men.  Suppose that she should profit by the wish he showed so plainly, and through jealousy bind the man whom she loved anew and more firmly than ever?  She probably admitted to herself that in doing so she would incur a great risk, but it seemed easier to lose her greatest treasure entirely than only to half possess it; and when she had once looked this thought in the face it attracted her, as with the gaze of a basilisk, more and more strongly.  The afternoon of the following day, with the marquise, she entered the scene of festivity under the lindens.  To punish Barbara for not returning her greeting, the gray-haired lady in waiting had at first been inclined to excuse herself on the plea of illness; but the taste for amusement with which her nature was still pervaded, as well as curiosity to see the much-discussed Duke Maurice, and the desire to watch Barbara's conduct, drew her to the place where the festival was held.  Ratisbon had done her best to receive this guest, whom she especially desired to honour, with all possible magnificence.  Flags and streamers bearing the colours of the empire, with the Burgundian red and gold of the Emperor, the silver-crossed keys on a red field of the city of Ratisbon, and with the Saxon coats of arms, rose amid the leafy tops of the lindens, and floated from tall poles in the sunny May air.  The blue and yellow Saxon flag, with the black and yellow chevron in the field and a lozenged chaplet from the left corner to the top, was more frequently seen than any other banner.  Even though this festival was held for Duke Maurice, no one could fail to notice how much more space was given to his escutcheon than to the Emperor's.  The entertainment had opened at noon with a tournament and riding at the ring.  The duke had participated in the sport a short time, and carried off several rings on his sword while in full career.  The Emperor had held aloof from this game, in which he had formerly joined gladly and with much skill, but, on the other hand, he had promised to appear at the festival under the lindens, which was to last until night.  The Council had had a magnificent tent erected for him, Duke Maurice, and the court, and in order to ornament the interior suitably had allowed the use of the beautiful tapestries in the town hall.  These represented familiar incidents from famous love tales: Tristan and Isolde seeing the face of King Mark in the mirror of the spring, Frau Venus as, surrounded by her court, she receives Tannhauser in the Horselberg, and similar scenes.  Other art textiles showed incidents in the lives of forest people--little men and women in striped linen garments, wonderful trees and birds such as no human eye ever beheld--but above the hangings a row of coats of arms again appeared, in which the imperial escutcheon alternated with the Saxon.  The front of the tent, covered with red and white material, stood open, permitting the guests who did not belong to the court to survey the interior.  Artistic platters, large dishes, in which dainty sweets and fruits were gracefully heaped and the cathedral of Ratisbon and other devices stood, the costly silverware of the city, and many beautifully formed wine flagons attracted the gaze.  Beside these were dishes of roast meats, fish, and cakes for the illustrious guests.  Stewards and guards of the Council, clad in red and white, with the crossed keys in silver embroidery on the shoulder, offered refreshments. Two superb thrones stood ready for the Emperor and the duke, easy-chairs for the cardinals, princes, and counts, stools for the barons, knights, and ladies.  Opposite to the tent stands were erected for the Council, the patrician families, and the other ladies and gentlemen whom the city had invited to the festival.  In their midst rose a large, richly decorated stage for the Emperor's orchestra, which, with his Majesty's permission, had been induced to play a few pieces, and by the side of the stands was a towerlike structure, from whose summit the city pipers of Ratisbon, joined by those of Landshut, were to be heard.  A large, round stage, encircled by a fence of young birch logs, had been built for dancing amid the leafy lindens, and stood directly opposite to the imperial tent.  Near the linden-shaded square at the shooting house were posted the cannon and howitzers, which were to receive the distinguished guests with loud volleys and lend fresh animation to the festival.  The Lindenplatz belonged to the same suburb of Prebrunn in which stood the little castle of the Prince Abbot of Berchtesgaden, which Barbara occupied.  So, during the short distance which she and the marquise had to traverse in litters, uproar, music, and the thunder of artillery greeted them.  This exerted an intoxicating influence upon Barbara, who had been so long absent from such scenes.  At home she had abandoned her intention of arousing the Emperor'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5566"],["title","Barbara Blomberg — Volume 06 (#6)"],["body","jealousy; now her excited nerves urged her to execute it.  The advantage she hoped to derive was well worth the risk. But if the bold game failed, and the proud, sensitive monarch should be seriously angry----  Just then shots crashed again, music and shouts echoed more loudly in her ears.  \"A Blomberg does not fear,\" and with newly awakened defiance she closed her ears to the warning voice.  The festival was commencing.  She, too, would be gay for once, and if she was cautious the bold enterprise must succeed.  A merry evening awaited her and, if all went well, on the morrow, after a few unpleasant hours, her lover's whole heart would once more be hers.  When she reached the scene of festivity it was already thronged with richly attired princes and counts, knights and ladies, citizens of Ratisbon, as well as nobles and distinguished townspeople from the neighbouring castles, citadels, and cities.  Music and a loud medley of shouts and conversation greeted her at her entrance.  Her heart throbbed quickly, for she did not forget her daring purpose, and a throng of memories of modest but more carefree days rushed upon her.  Here, when a little girl, she had attended the May festival Virgatum-- which owed its name to the green rods or twigs with which the school children adorned themselves--and played under yonder lindens with Wolf, with the wilder Erasmus, and other boys.  How delightful it had been!-- and when the enlarged band of city pipers struck up a gavotte her feet unconsciously kept time, and she could not help thinking of the last dance in the New Scales, the recruiting officer who had guided her so firmly and skilfully in the Schwabeln, and through him of her father, of whom she had not thought again since the good news received two evenings before.  She still stood at the crowded entrance gazing around her.  The interior of the imperial tent could not be seen from here, but she could overlook the stand of the noble families, and there she saw her cousins Anne Mirl and Nandl Woller, with Martina Hiltner beside them.  She had refused to receive all three in her little castle at Prebrunn; the true reason she alone knew.  Her excuse had perhaps appeared to the girls trivial and unkind.  Now her glance met Nandl's, and her warmhearted friend beckoned eagerly to her; but her mother drew her arm down, and it was evident that the corpulent lady said something reproving.  Barbara looked away from the stand, and the question where her place was here suddenly disturbed her.  She had received no invitation from the Council of the city, and perhaps she would have been refused admittance to the stand.  She did not know whether before the Emperor's arrival she would be received in the court tent, which Cardinal Madrucci of Trent, in superb scarlet robes, was just approaching, and an oppressive anxiety again subdued the courage which had just resolved on the boldest venture.  At that moment Baron Malfalconnet saw her, and instantly approached. Gaily offering one arm to her and the other to the marquise, he escorted both to the tent, whispering meanwhile in Barbara's ear, \"Glowing summer, between spring and winter,\" and, as soon as he had taken them to the buffet, off he hurried again to offer his arm to the Margravine of Leuchtenberg, who was followed by two charming daughters, with pretty pages bearing their trains.  How the gold, jewels, and shining armour in the tent glittered!  How the crimson glowed, the plumes waved, the heavy velvet attracted the eye by rich hues, the light laces by their delicate fineness!  How the silk rustled, and one superb piece of fur vied with the other in costliness, the white with the red rose in beauty!  Barbara involuntarily looked at her sea-green brocade, and felt its heavy texture and the softness of the fur trimming on the overdress, which at home she had called a masterpiece of Frau Lerch's work.  She could be satisfied with her appearance, and the string of pearls on her neck and the bracelet which her lover had sent to her, after her visit in the page's costume, were also costly ornaments.  The magnificent star was missing; in its place she wore at the square-cut neck of her dress two beautiful halfblown roses, and her mirror had showed her how becoming they were.  She did not need gold or gems.  What gave her power to subdue the hearts of men was of higher value.  Yet, when she mingled among the other dignitaries, she felt like an intruder in this circle.  The marquise had left her, and joined those of her own rank.  Most of the ladies were strangers to Barbara, and she was avoided by those whom she knew; but, to make amends, she was soon surrounded by many aristocratic gentlemen, and her mobile nature speedily made her forget what had just depressed her joyous spirit.  Then the cannon and culverins thundered louder, the blare of trumpets rent the air with deafening shrillness, the ringing of bells in all the steeples of Ratisbon, the exulting shouts of the crowd upon the stands and in the whole Lindenplatz poured in mighty waves of sound into the tent, where the nobles and aristocratic ladies around Barbara now raised their voices also.  With a throbbing heart she mingled her cheers with those of the others and, like them, waved her handkerchief and her fan.  The man whom she loved was approaching!  This crashing and echoing, this wild uproar of enthusiastic shouts and cries, this flutter of flags and waving of handkerchiefs were all in his honour and, stirred to her inmost soul by impetuous enthusiasm and ardent gratitude, her eyes grew dim with tears, and she joined far more loudly and freely in the cheers of the multitude than the aristocrats around her, to whom court etiquette dictated reserve on all occasions, even this one.  The loving woman saw nothing save the man who was advancing.  How should she have noticed the scornful glances which her unrestrained vivacity elicited?  Her gaze was fixed solely upon the one sun to which the little stars around her owed their paler or brighter radiance.  She scarcely noticed even the handsome young prince at Charles's side.  Yet Duke Maurice would have been well worthy of her whole attention, for with what a free, proud step he advanced, while his imperial master used his arm as a support!  Charles also looked magnificent in the Castilian court costume, with the chain of the Grand Master of the Golden Fleece about his neck; but the young Saxon duke was considerably his superior in height, and the silver- embroidered, steel-gray suit of Spanish cut and the black velvet mantle trimmed with a border of marten fur, were extremely becoming.  Both saluted the crowd that welcomed them so warmly and loudly, gazing meanwhile at the festal scene, the Emperor with haughty, almost indifferent dignity, the duke with less reserve and more eager gestures.  Barbara knew the sovereign, and when she saw him thrust his lower lip slightly forward she was sure that something vexed him.  Perhaps she ought not to venture to irritate the lion that day.  Was his anger roused by the boldness of the city magistrates, who dared to favour the Saxon escutcheon and banners so openly?  It seemed to her exasperating, punishable insolence.  But perhaps in his greatness he did not grudge this distinction to a guest so much his inferior, and it was only the gout again inflicting its pangs upon his poor tortured foot.  The way was strewn with leaves and green branches, and the Saxon was leading her lord directly over the hard little boughs in the middle of the path.  Barbara would fain have called to him to look at the ground and not up at the banners and escutcheons bearing his colours, whose number seemed to flatter him.  Had Charles been leaning on her arm, she would have performed the office of guide better.  At last the distinguished pair, with the companions who followed them, reached the tent and took their seats upon the thrones.  Again Maurice gazed eagerly around him, but Charles vouchsafed the Lindenplatz and stands only a few careless glances.  He had no time to do more, for the young Landgravines of Leuchtenber; and several other newcomers at court were presented to him by the Count of Nassau, and, after greeting the occupants of the tent by a gracious gesture, the monarch addressed a few kind words to each.  Barbara was obliged to content herself with the others, yet her heart ached secretly that he gave her no word of welcome.  Then, when the performances began and the chamberlains and major-domo seated the aristocratic ladies and older dignitaries according to their sex and rank, and she was thus placed very far in the rear, she felt it as a grievous injustice.  Was she no longer the love of the man who reigned over everything here?  And since no one could deny this claim, why need she be satisfied with a place beside the insignificant ladies of honour of the princelings who were present?  How forsaken and ill-treated she seemed to herself!  But there was Don Luis Quijada already making his way to her to bring a greeting from his Majesty and escort her to a place from which she could have a better view of what the city had arranged for the entertainment of the distinguished guest.  So she was not wholly forgotten by her lover, but with what scanty alms he fed her!  What did she care for the exhibition which was about to begin?  The minutes dragged on at a snail's pace while the lanterns on the lindens and poles, the torches, and pitch pans were lighted.  Had not the gentlemen and ladies been so completely separated, it might perhaps have been a little gay.  But, as it was, no one of the aristocratic women who surrounded her granted her even one poor word; but the number of glances, open and secret, cast at her became all the greater as one noble dame whispered to another that she was the singer whom his Majesty condescended to distinguish in so remarkable a manner.  To know that she was thus watched might be endured, as she was aware that she"]]]
