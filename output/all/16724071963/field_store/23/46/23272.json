This co-ordination becomes a continuity which generates motor habits or tendencies to action.  There now comes up for consideration the question as to why this relation of the organism, to more or less distinct objects, takes the particular form of conscious perception, and further, why does everything happen as if this consciousness were born of the internal movements of the cerebral substance? To answer this question, we must turn to perceptual processes, as these occur in our everyday life. We find at once that \"there is no perception which is not full of memories. With the immediate and present data of our senses, we mingle a thousand details out of our past experience.\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 24 (Fr. p. 20).] To such an extent is this true that the immediate data of perception serve as a sign to bring much more to the mind. Psychological experiments have conclusively proved that we never actually perceive all that we imagine to be there. Hence arise illusions, examples of which may be easily thought of--incorrect proof-reading is one, while another common one is the mistake of taking one person for another because of some similarity of dress. What is actually perceived is but a fraction of what we are looking at and acts normally as a suggestion for the whole. Now, although it is true that, in practice, Perception and Memory are never found absolutely separate in their purity, yet it is necessary to distinguish them from one another absolutely in any investigation of a psychological nature. If, instead of a perception impregnated with memory-images, nothing survived from the past, then we should have \"pure\" perception, not coloured by anything in the individual's past history, and so a kind of impersonal perception. However unreal it may seem, such a perception is at the root of our knowledge of things and individual accidents are merely grafted on to this impersonal or \"pure\" perception. Just because philosophers have overlooked it, and because they have failed to distinguish it from that which memory contributes to it, they have regarded Perception as a kind of interior and subjective vision, differing from Memory only by its greater intensity and not differing in nature. In reality, however, Perception and Memory differ fundamentally.  Our conscious perception is just our power of choice, reflected from things as though by a mirror, so that representation arises from the omission of that in the totality of matter which has no bearing on our needs and consequently no interest for us. \"There is for images merely a difference of degree and not of kind between 'being' and 'being consciously perceived.'\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 30 (Fr. p. 25).] Consciousness--in regard to external perception--is explained by this indeterminateness and this choice. \"But there is in this necessary poverty of conscious perception, something that is positive, that foretells spirit; it is, in the etymological sense of the word, discernment.'\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 31 (Fr. p. 26).] The chief difficulty in dealing with the problems of Perception, is to explain \"not how Perception arises, but how it is limited, since it should be the image of the whole and is in fact reduced to the image of that which interests you.\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 34 (Fr. p. 29).] We only make an insuperable difficulty if we imagine Perception to be a kind of photographic view of things, taken from a fixed point by that special apparatus which is called an organ of perception--a photograph which would then be developed in the brain-matter by some unknown chemical and psychical process. \"Everything happens as though your perception were a result of the internal motions of the brain and issued in some sort from the cortical centres. It could not actually come from them since the brain is an image like others, enveloped in the mass of other images, and it would be absurd that the container should issue from the content. But since the structure of the brain is like the detailed plan of the movements among which you have the choice, and since that part of the external images which appears to return upon itself, in order to constitute perception, includes precisely all the points of the universe which these movements could affect, conscious perception and cerebral movement are in strict correspondence. The reciprocal dependence of these two terms is therefore simply due to the fact that both are functions of a third, which is the indetermination of the Will.\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 35 (Fr. p. 29).]  Moreover, we must recognize that the image is formed and perceived in the object, not in the brain, even although it would seem that rays of light coming from a point P are perceived along the path of the sensori-motor processes in the brain and are afterwards projected into P. There is not, however, an unextended image which forms itself in consciousness and then projects itself into the position P. Really, the point P, and the rays which it emits, together with the retina and nervous elements affected in the process of perception, all form a single whole. The point P is an indispensable factor in this whole and it is really in P and not anywhere else that the image of P is formed and perceived.[Footnote: Cf. Matter and Memory, p. 37 (Fr p. 31), also paper entitled Notre croyance a la loi de causalite in the Revue de metaphysique et de morale, 1900, p. 658.]  In the field of \"pure\" perception, that is to say, perception unadulterated by the addition of memory-images, there can arise no image without an object. \"Sensation is essentially due to what is actually present.\" [Footnote: Le Souvenir du present et la fausse reconnaissance, p. 579 of Revue philosophique, Dec., 1908; also L'Energie spirituelle, p. 141 (Mind-Energy).] Exactly how external stimuli, such as rays of a certain speed and length, come to give us a certain image, e.g., the sensation \"red\" or the sound of \"middle C,\" we shall never understand. \"No trace of the movements themselves can be actually perceived in the sensation which translates them.\" [Footnote: Time and Free Will, pp. 34-35 (Fr. p. 26).] We only make trouble by regarding sensations in an isolated manner and attempting to construct Perception from them. \"Our sensations are to our perceptions, that which the real action of our body is to its possible or virtual action.\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 58 (Fr. p. 48).] Thus, everything happens as if the external images were reflected by our body into surrounding space. This is why the surface of the body, which forms the common limit of the external and internal, is the only portion of space which is both perceived and felt. Just as external objects are perceived by me where they are, in themselves and not in me, so my affective states (e.g. pains--which are local, unavailing efforts) are experienced where they occur, in my body. Consider the system of images which we term the \"external world.\" My body is one of them and around it is grouped the representation, i.e., its eventual influence on others. Within it occurs affection, i.e., its actual effort upon itself. It is because of this distinction between images and sensations that we affirm that the totality of perceived images subsists, even if our body disappears, whereas we cannot annihilate our body without destroying our sensations. In practice, our \"pure\" perception is adulterated with affection, as well as with memories. To understand Perception, however, we must--as previously insisted upon--study it with reference to action. It is false to suppose \"that perception and sensation exist for their own sake; the philosopher ascribes to them an entirely speculative function,\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 311 (Fr p. 261).] a proceeding which gives rise to the fallacies of Realism and Idealism.  It has been said that the choice of perceptions from among images in general is the effect of a \"discernment\" which foreshadows spirit. But to touch the reality of spirit, we must place ourselves at the point where an individual consciousness continues and retains the past in a present, enriched by it.[Footnote: See Chapter VI on la duree. Time--True and False.] Perception we never meet in its pure state; it is always mingled with memories. The rose has a different scent for you from that which it has for me, just because the scent of the rose bears with it all the memories of all the roses we have ever experienced, each of us individually.[Footnote: Time and Free Will, pp. 161-162 (Fr. p. 124).] Memory, however mingled with Perception, is nevertheless fundamentally different in character.[Footnote: Le Souvenir du present et la fausse reconnaissance, Revue philosophique, Dec., 1908, p. 580; also L'Effort intellectuel, Revue philosophique, Jan., 1902, p. 23; L'Energie spirituelle, pp. 141 and 197 (Mind-Energy).] \"When we pass from 'pure' Perception to Memory, we definitely abandon matter for spirit.\" [Footnote: Matter and Memory, p. 313 (Fr. p. 263).]     CHAPTER IV  MEMORY   Definition--Two forms--memorizing power related to habit; recalling power or \"pure\" memory.

The \"Box\" theory--Memory records everything--Dreams--The well-balanced mind--Memory a manifestation of spirit.   The importance of Memory is recognized by all persons--whether psychologists or not. At the present time there is a growing interest in systems of memory-training offered to the public, which aim at mental efficiency as a means to success in life. Indeed, from the tone of some advertisements seen in the press, one might be prompted to think that Memory itself was the sole factor determining success in either a professional or a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],["title","The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#0)"],["body","by Charles Keller for Tina with OmniPage Professional OCR software donated by Caere Corporation, 1-800-535-7226.

TOD THE TALE OF PIGLING BLAND GINGER AND PICKLES     THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT   Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were--      Flopsy,           Mopsy,                Cotton-tail,                     and Peter.  They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.  \"Now, my dears,\" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, \"you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"  \"Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.\"   Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.  Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries;  But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!   First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;  And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.  But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!   Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, \"Stop thief.\"  Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.  After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.   Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.  Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.  And rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.   Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower- pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.  Presently Peter sneezed-- \"Kertyschoo!\" Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,  And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.  Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.  After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around.   He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.  Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he has heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.   He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe-- scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!  Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.  Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.  Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.   Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.  He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!  I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.  His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!  \"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.\"  But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.    THE TAILOR OF GLOUCESTER  \"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass; And entertain a score or two of tailors.\" [Richard III]  My Dear Freda:  Because you are fond of fairytales, and have been ill, I have made you a story all for yourself--a new one that nobody has read before.  And the queerest thing about it is--that I heard it in Gloucestershire, and that it is true--at least about the tailor, the waistcoat, and the                \"No more twist!\" _Christmas_   In the time of swords and peri wigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets--when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta--there lived a tailor in Gloucester.  He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on a table from morning till dark.  All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippetted, piecing out his satin, and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester.  But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very, very poor. He cut his coats without waste; according to his embroidered cloth, they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table--\"Too narrow breadths for nought--except waistcoats for mice,\" said the tailor.  One bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat (a coat of cherry- coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses) and a cream- coloured satin waistcoat for the Mayor of Gloucester.   The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself: \"No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!\" said the Tailor of Gloucester.  When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window- panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table.  There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat; and there were pocket-flaps and cuffs and buttons, all in order. For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta, and for the button- holes of the waistcoat there was cherry-coloured twist. And everything was ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient--except that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk.  The tailor came out of his shop at dark. No one lived there at nights but little brown mice, and THEY ran in and out without any keys!   For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long, narrow passages.  But the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow. And although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen.  He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.  \"Miaw?\" said the cat when the tailor opened the door, \"miaw?\"  The tailor replied: \"Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence), and, Simpkin, take a china pipkin, but a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk, and a penn'orth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence but me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST.\"   Then Simpkin again said \"Miaw!\" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.  The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.  \"I shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat--\"  Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--  Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!  \"Now what can that be?\""]]]
