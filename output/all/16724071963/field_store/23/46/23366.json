The genitive _ni_ may be added, _lea fainia_ go with him; _fainia_ moreover, and.  _Sia_ means at, at home, and always has the suffixed pronoun.  By the ordinary Melanesian idiom place at comes to be used of motion to: _siagamelu chez nous_, _siena ere_ beside the fire, _lea mai siegu_ come here to me. _Usi_ means over, on behalf of, for: _gera ngisu usia_ they spat on him, _na captain usia na too_ a captain over the people, _na taba olisia usia na aigi_ a redemption for the people.  The genitives have been dealt with under nouns: _i_ is in most general use, both are used to express purpose, and _ni_ also denotes for, belonging to: _fasia muka manata ni bae uri_ think not to say thus, _gera mou ni oli_ they feared to return, _ka ote nia ni rosuli_ he is tired of obeying.  2. Compound prepositions.  Some of these are nouns used with the locative; the pronoun is suffixed as the actual object or as the anticipatory object when a noun follows: _i fafo_ above, _i fara_ beneath, _i lao_ within. The locative need not be used with _lao_: _lao rodo_ in the night, _lao tala_ in the path, _lao salo_ in the sky.  Some are constructed from verbal nouns to which the suffixed pronoun is always added: _fonosia_ in front of him, _nia initoo fonosi gera_ he ruled over them, _fonosi taa_ to meet what? for what purpose? Certain verbs are used as prepositions: _maasi_ to await, _garangi_ to be near.   CONJUNCTIONS.  Copulative, _ma_. Adversative, _ta_, _ma ta_ Connective, _ta_. Disjunctive, _langi_, _langi fa_, _ma langi_, _ma ka langi_. Conditional, _ana_, _ma ana_, _saea_. Illative, _fi fe_.  A mark of quotation is _saea_, _uri_. Neither, nor, is expressed by a negative followed by _ma_. Until is _dao ana_, _lea dao ana_.   NUMERALS.  The numerical system is decimal. All numbers over the tens are expressed in tens.  1. Cardinals.  1. _eta_, _ta_, _te_. 2. _e rua_, _ro_. 3. _e olu_. 4. _e fai_. 5. _e lima_. 6. _e ono_. 7. _e qalu_. 8. _e fiu_. 9. _e siqa_. 10. _e tangafulu_, _aqala_.  In numbers other than _eta_ the initial _e_ is omitted in quick counting. In composition one is _ta_, two is _ro_, _te_ generally means only: _rua_ is reduplicated into _ruarua_, _tau ruarua_ equidistant.  The prefix _too_ forms distributives: _too ro doo_ two things at a time. _Nima_ is used as well as _lima_ for five. Though _qalu_ eight, appears in the translations as used of an indefinite number it is doubtful whether such use is correct. _Tangafulu_ is the tenth of a series; _aqala_ is used for ten denoting a unit, _aqala fono_ a full ten.  To express units above ten _mana_ is employed: _aqala mana fai_ fourteen.  One hundred is _tangalau_: _tangale doo_ one hundred things. The sum above the hundred is expressed by _mana_: _tangalau fai aqala mana fai_ one hundred and forty-four. One thousand is _too_.  2. Ordinals.  The cardinals with a substantival ending _na_ form ordinals.  First, _etana_.  Fourth, _faina_. Seventh, _fiuna_. Second, _ruana_. Fifth, _limana_. Eighth, _qaluna_. Third, _oluna_.  Sixth, _onona_.  Ninth, _siqana_.  Ordinals precede the noun: _ruana na mwane_ the second man.  Ordinals are used to express the number of times: _eruana lau nia lea go_ he went away the second time.  _Ruana_ also means fellow: _na ruana gera_ their fellows.  Tenth is expressed by _tangafulu ana_: _aqala maaedangi mana ruana_ the twelfth day, _tangalau ro aqala mana etana_ one hundred and twenty-first.  _Efita_ how many, is used with the substantival termination _na_: _efitana_ what number?  3. Multiplicatives.  The article _fe_ is employed to form multiplicatives: _guka fai fe olila_ I shall return four times, _sasigu ka fita fe ode doo taala fuagu_ how often shall my brother harm me? _tafe_ once.  The causative _fa_ does not make multiplicatives except in the case of _faoroa_ often.   EXCLAMATIONS.  _Iu_, _iuka_, assent. _Oto mone_ is that so? _Ne_ is used in questions, _ati ne satamu_ what is your name? _na mwela a Joseph e langi ne_ Is He not the son of Joseph? _Aia_ sums up, so there, well then! _Oimae_ alas! The noun _ai_, person, is added to proper names to call attention, _Joe ai_ hey, Joe!
