When the sedan chair was at last set on the ground in front of the lowest step of the platform, Barbara thought that her heart would burst; for while the singers in the balcony began the \"Venite populi mundi,\" so familiar to her, and the cheers redoubled, Charles descended, and in what a guise she saw him again!  He looked ten years older, and she felt with him the keen suffering which every step must cause.  This time it was not Quijada, but the Duke of Alba, who offered him the support of his mailed arm, and, leaning on it, he ascended the low stage.  While doing so he turned his back to Barbara, and as with bent figure and outstretched head he wearily climbed the two stairs leading to the platform, he presented a pitiable spectacle.  And have you loved this wreck of a man with all the fervour of your heart?  the girl asked herself; does it still throb faster for him? could you even now expect from him a fairer happiness than from all these handsome warriors and nobles in the pride of their manly vigour?  To this old man you have sacrificed happiness and honour, given up your father and the noblest, best of friends!  Fierce indignation for her own folly suddenly seized upon her with such overmastering power that she looked away from the sovereign toward the singers, who were summoning the whole world to pay homage to yonder broken-down man, as though he were a demigod.  A bitter smile hovered around her lips as she did so, but it vanished as swiftly as it had come; for when she again fixed her eyes upon the monarch, she would gladly have joined in the mighty hymn.  As if by a miracle, he had become an entirely different person.  Now he stood before the throne in the full loftiness and dignity of commanding majesty.  A purple mantle fell from his shoulders, and the Duke of Alba was placing the crown on his head instead of the velvet cap.  Oh, no, she need not be ashamed of having loved this man, and she was not; for she loved him still, and was fully and joyously aware that whatever he suffered, whatever tortured and prematurely aged the man still in his fourth decade, no one on earth equalled him in intellect and grandeur.  And as pages then placed the velvet cushions on the carpet; as the Duke of Parma, the gonfaloniere on whose head rested the blessing of the representative of Christ, bent the knee before his imperial father-in- law, and the proud Alba and the other Knights of the Golden Fleece who were present did the same; as Charles, the grand master of the order, took from the cushion the symbol of honour which Count Henry of Nassau handed to him, and placed the golden sheepskin with the red ribbon around Duke Ottavio's neck, while the plaudits, the ringing of bells, and the thunder of the artillery echoed more loudly than ever from the stone walls of the courtyard, tears filled Barbara's eyes and, as when the Emperor passed at the head of the bridal procession in Prebrunn, her voice again blended with the enthusiastic shouts of homage to the man standing in majestic repose before the throne, the man who was the most exalted of human beings.  She understood only a few words of the brief speech which the monarch addressed to the new Knight of the Golden Fleece.  She saw for the first time the dignitaries of so many different nations upon whom she was gazing down, and most of whom she did not even know by name.  But what did she care how they were called and who they were?  Her eyes were fixed only on Charles and the young man in the armour artistically inlaid with gold, peach-coloured silver brocade, and white silk, who was kneeling before him.  Suppose that a son of hers should be permitted to share such an honour; suppose that Charles should some day bend down to her child and kiss his brow with the paternal affection which he had just showed to the young duke whom he had wedded to his daughter?  And this daughter was the child of a mother who was her sister in sorrow, and had been her superior in nothing, neither in birth nor in beauty.  She said this to herself while she was intently watching the progress of the solemn ceremonial.  How lovingly and with what enthusiastic reverence Ottavio was now gazing up into the face of his imperial father-in-law, and with what grateful fervour, as the youngest Knight of the Fleece, he kissed his hand!  Not only outwardly but in heart--the warm light of their eyes revealed it--these men, so unlike in age and gifts, were united; yet Ottavio was not Charles's own son, as another would have been whom she wished to withhold from such a father, and in her selfish blindness to withdraw from the path to the summit of all earthly splendour and honour.  Who gave her the right to commit so great, so execrable a robbery?  What could she, the poor, deserted, scorned toy of a king--give to her child, and what the mightiest of the mighty yonder?  If he was ready to claim as his own the young life which she expected with hopeful yearning, it would thereby receive a benefit so vast, a gift so brilliant that all the wealth of love and care which she intended to bestow upon it vanished in darkness by comparison.  Charles's resolve, which she had execrated as cruel, was harsh only against her who had angered him, and who could give him so little more; for her child it meant grandeur and splendour, and thereby, she thought in her vain folly, the highest happiness attainable for human beings.  Still she gazed as though spellbound at the decorated stage, but the ceremony was already rapidly approaching its close.  The great nobles surrounded the new Knight of the Fleece to congratulate him, the Duke of Alba first; but vouchsafed a few brief, gracious words only to a few dignitaries, and then, this time assisted by Quijada, descended to the sedan chair.  Barbara had learned from Frau Traut that his Majesty knew that she was here in the ladies' apartments.  Would he now raise his eyes to her, though but for a brief space?  He was already standing at the door of the sedan chair, and until now had kept his gaze bent steadily upon the ground.  Meanwhile he must be experiencing severe pain; she saw it by the lines around the corners of his mouth.  Now he placed his sound right foot upon the little step; now, before drawing the aching left one after it, he turned toward Quijada, whose hand was supporting him under the arm; and now--no, she was not mistaken--now he raised his eyes with the speed of lightning toward the ladies' apartments, and for one short second his glance met hers.  Then his head vanished in the sedan chair.  Nevertheless, he had looked toward her, and this was a great boon.  With all her strength she made it her own, and soon she felt absolutely sure that when he knew she was so near him he had been unable to resist the desire to gaze once more into her face.  Perhaps it was intended for a precious farewell gift.  As soon as the sedan chair, amid cheers and the blare of trumpets, had disappeared in the direction of the drawbridge and the great main entrance, Barbara retired to her room.  Frau Traut knew not whether she ought to bless or bewail having obtained permission for her to witness the bestowal of the Fleece.  At any rate, another great transformation had taken place in this extremely impressionable young creature.  Barbara's impetuous nature seemed destroyed and crushed, and the bright gaiety which had pleased Frau Dubois so much the first day of their meeting had greatly diminished.  Only on special occasions her former fiery vivacity burst forth, but the sudden flame expired as quickly as it had blazed and, dreamily absorbed in her own thoughts, she obeyed her with the docility of a child.  This swift and marked change in the disposition of her charge, whom Quijada and her own husband had described as so totally different, awakened her anxiety; yet it was easy to perceive that the volcano had not burned out, but was merely quiescent for the time.  During the night the dull indifference which she showed in the day abandoned her, and her attentive companion often heard her sobbing aloud.  It did not escape Frau Tract's notice that since Barbara had seen the Emperor again in the Trausnitz courtyard a mental conflict had begun which absorbed her whole being, but the girl did not permit her any insight into her deeply troubled soul.     CHAPTER IX.  The Emperor Charles departed on the morning after the bestowal of the Golden Fleece, and two days later Barbara willingly obeyed the leech's prescription to seek healing at the springs of Abbach on the Danube, a few miles south of Ratisbon, which was almost in the way of those returning thither from Landshut.  The waters there had benefited the Emperor Charles fourteen years before, and Barbara remained there with Frau Traut and Lamperi, who had returned to her, until the trees had put on their gay autumn robes and were casting them off to prepare for the rest of winter.  The hope of regaining the melody of her voice induced her conscientiously to follow the physician's prescriptions but, like the sulphur spring of Abbach,[??] they produced no considerable effect.  Barbara's conduct had also altered in many respects.  The girl who had formerly devoted great attention to her dress, now often needed to be reminded by Frau Dubois of her personal appearance when she went with her to walk or to church.  She avoided all intercourse with other visitors to the spring after Ratisbon acquaintances had intentionally shunned her.  The Wollers' country residence, where she had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5568"],["title","Barbara Blomberg — Volume 08 (#8)"],["body","been a welcome guest for weeks every summer, was near Abbach.  Anne Mirl was betrothed, and Nandl was on the eve of accepting a young suitor.  Both were still warmly attached to their cousin, although they had been told that, by an open love intrigue, she had forfeited the right to visit the respectable home of modest maidens.  But the man who had honoured her with his love was no less a personage than the Emperor Charles, and this circumstance only increased the sympathy which the sisters felt for their much-admired friend.  In spite of their mother's refusal to permit them to ride to the neighbouring town and visit Barbara, they did so, that they might try to comfort her; but though their unfortunate cousin received them and listened to them a short time, she earnestly entreated them to obey their mother and not come again.  Frau Traut perceived that she not only desired to guard the inexperienced girls from trouble, but that their visit disturbed her.  The thoughts which were in her mind so completely absorbed her that she now studiously sought the solitude which she had formerly shunned like a misfortune.  Even Pyramus Kogel's short letter, informing her of her father's convalescence, and the news from the seat of war which Frau Traut communicated to her to divert her thoughts, and which she had usually anticipated with impatient expectation, awakened only a fleeting interest.  Toward the end of the first week in September her companion could inform her that the Emperor Charles had met the Smalcalds at Ingolstadt and, in spite of a severe attack of the gout, had ridden-- with his aching foot in linen bandages instead of in the stirrup--from regiment to regiment, kindling the enthusiasm of his troops by fiery words.  Then Barbara at last listened with more interest, and asked for other details.  Frau Dubois, to whom her husband from time to time sent messengers from the camp, now said that the encounter had not come to an actual battle and a positive decision, but his Majesty had heeded the shower of bullets less than the patter of a hailstorm, and had quietly permitted Appian, the astronomer, to explain a chart of the heavens in his tent, though the enemy's artillery was tearing the earth around it.  But even this could not reanimate the extinguished ardour of Barbara's soul; she had merely said calmly: \"We know that he is a hero.  I had expected him to disperse the heretics as the wolf scatters the sheep and destroy them at a single blow.\"  Then taking her rosary and prayer book, she went to church, as she did daily at this time.  She spent hours there, not only praying, but holding intercourse with the image of the Madonna, from which she dill not avert her eyes, as though it was a living being.  The chaplain who had been given to her associated with this devout tendency of his penitent the hope that Barbara would decide to enter a convent; but she rebuffed in the firmest manner every attempt to induce her to form this resolve.  In October the northeast wind brought cold weather, and Frau Traut feared that remaining for hours in the chilly brick church would injure her charge's health, so she entreated Barbara to desist.  But when the latter, without heeding her warning, continued to visit the house of God as before, and to stay the same length of time, Frau Dubois interposed a firm prohibition, and on this occasion she learned for the first time to what boundlessly vehement rebellion her charge could allow passion to carry her.  True, soon after Barbara, with winning tenderness, besought her forgiveness, and it was readily granted, but Frau Traut knew of no other expedient than to fix the first of November, which would come in a few days, for their return to Ratisbon.  Barbara was startled.  During the night her companion heard her weeping vehemently, and her kind heart led her to her bedside.  With the affectionate warmth natural to her, she entreated the unhappy girl to calm herself, and to open her troubled heart to one who felt as kindly toward her as a mother; and before these friendly words the defiance, doubts, and fear which had closed Barbara's heart melted.  \"You may take it from me,\" she cried, amid her streaming tears.  \"What can a poor girl give it save want and shame?  Its father, on the contrary--If he adopts and rears it as his child--O Frau Traut! dare I, who already love it more than my own life, rob it of the happiness to which it has a right?  If the Emperor acknowledges it, whether it is a boy or a girl, merciful Heaven, to what Magnificence, what splendour, what honour my child may attain!  My brain often reels when I think of it.  The little daughter of Johanna Van der Gheynst a Duchess of Parma, and why should he place the girl whom I shall perhaps give him in a more humble position?  Or if Heaven should grant me a son, his father will raise him to a still greater height, and I have already seen him before me a hundred times as he hangs the Fleece on the red ribbon round his neck.\"  Here her voice, still uncertain, failed, but she allowed Frau Traut to clasp her to her heart and, in her joy at this decision, which relieved her of a grave anxiety, to kiss her brow and cheeks.  She had at last perceived, the kindly consoler assured the weeping girl, what the most sacred duty commanded, and the course that promised to render her, after so much suffering, one of the happiest of mothers.  All that had hovered before her as glittering dreams would be fulfilled, and when her child, as the Emperor's, took precedence of the highest and greatest in the land, she could say to herself that it owed this to the sacrifice which she, its mother, had voluntarily made for its sake.  Barbara had told herself the same thing in many lonely hours, and most frequently in the brick church at Abbach, opposite to the image of the Mater dolorosa.  She whose intercession never remained unheard had yielded up, with an aching heart, her divine son, and she must imitate her.  And how much easier was her fate than that of the stainless virgin, who beheld her child, the Redeemer of the world, die upon the cross, while hers, if she resigned him, would attain the highest earthly happiness!  Frau Traut by no means overlooked the vanity of these motives.  She was only too well aware that there is no greater boon for a child than the mother's loyal, anxious love, and Barbara's delusion grieved her.  She would gladly have cried: \"Keep your child, overwhelm it with love, be good and unselfish, so that, in spite of your disgrace, it must honour you.\"  But the Emperor's command and her husband's wish were paramount. Besides, as Barbara was situated, it could not help being better for the child if the father provided for its education.  The soul of her charge now lay before her like an open book.  The spectacle of the brilliant honour bestowed upon Duke Ottavio Farnese had sowed in her heart the seeds which had now ripened to resolution.  She could not know that the vivandiere's assistant on the highway, with her abandoned child, had cast the first germ into Barbara's mind.  Moreover, she was content to be able to send such welcome tidings to the camp. The disclosure of the resolve which she had reached after such severe conflicts exerted a beneficial influence upon Barbara.  Her eyes again sparkled brightly, and the indifference with which she had regarded everything that happened to herself and those about her vanished.  For the first time she asked where she was to find shelter in Ratisbon; the Emperor's command closed Wolf's house against her; the Prebrunn castle was only a summer residence, unfit for winter use.  So it was necessary to seek new quarters, and Barbara did not lack proposals.  But the answer from camp must be awaited, and it came sooner than Frau Dubois expected.  The messenger who brought it was her husband.  His Majesty, he said, rejoiced at Barbara's decision, and had commissioned him to take her at once to Ratisbon and lodge her in the Golden Cross.  The imperial apartments were still at the monarch's disposal, and the owner of the house, whom Barbara did not wish to meet, had gone to Italy to spend the winter.  Herr Adrian did not mention what a favour the sovereign was showing Barbara by parting with his trusted servant for several days, but she told herself so with joyful pride, for she had learned how greatly Charles needed this man.  The Emperor had dismissed Quijada from attendance on his person. He knew the Castilian's value as a soldier, and would have deemed himself forgetful of duty had he withheld so able an assistant from the great cause which he was leading.  At the end of the first week in November Barbara again entered the Golden Cross in Ratisbon.  The great house seemed dead, but Adrian, in his royal master's name, provided for the comfort of the women, who had been joined by Sister Hyacinthe.  In the name of Frau Dubois, to whom his Majesty gave it up, Adrian took possession of the Golden Cross, and as such Barbara was presented to the newly engaged servants, while his wife was known by them as a Frau Traut from the Netherlands.  No inhabitant of Ratisbon was informed of the return of their young fellow-citizen, and Barbara only went out of doors with her companion early in the morning or in the twilight, and always closely veiled. But few persons had seen her after her illness, and on returning home she often mentioned the old acquaintances whom she had met without being recognised by them.  The apartments she occupied were warm and comfortable.  The harp and lute had been sent from Prebrunn with the rest of her property, and though she would not have ventured to sing even a single note, she resolved to touch their chords again.  Playing on the harp afforded her special pleasure, and Frau Traut fancied she could understand her thoughts while doing so.  The tones often sounded as gentle as lullabies, often as resonant and impetuous as battle songs. In reply to a question"]]]
