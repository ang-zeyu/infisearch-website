Before presenting the sermon, Mrs. Bemis read the following letter from a former pastor of the church:    _Rev. Mary Baker Eddy_--Dear Teacher, Leader,   Guide: Laus Deo. It is done. At last you begin to   see the fruition of that you have worked, toiled,   prayed for. The prayer in stone is accomplished.    Across 2,000 miles of space, as mortal sense puts   it, I send my hearty congratulations. You are   fully occupied, but I thought you would willingly   pause for an instant to receive this brief message   of congratulation. Surely it marks an era in the   blessed onward work of Christian Science. It is a   most auspicious hour in your eventful career.   While we all rejoice, yet the mother in Israel,   alone of us all, comprehends its full significance.   Yours lovingly,    LANSON P. NORCROSS.     (_Boston Sunday Globe_, January 6, 1895.)  EXTRACT.  Stately Home for Believers in Gospel Healing.--A Woman of Wealth Who Devotes All to Her Church Work.   Christian Science has shown its power over its students, as they are called, by building a church by voluntary contribution, the first of its kind, a church which will be dedicated to-day, with a quarter of a million dollars expended and free of debt.  The money has flowed in from all parts of the United States and Canada without any special appeal, and it kept coming until the custodian of funds cried \"enough\" and refused to accept any further checks by mail or otherwise. Men, women, and children lent a helping hand, some giving a mite and some substantial sums. Sacrifices were made in many an instance which will never be known in this world.  Christian Scientists not only say that they can effect cures of disease and erect churches, but add that they can get their buildings finished on time even when the feat seems impossible to mortal senses. Read the following from a publication of the new denomination:    One of the grandest and most helpful features of   this glorious consummation is this: that one month   before the close of the year every evidence of   material sense declared that the church's completion   within the year 1894 transcended human possibility.   The predictions of workman and onlooker alike were   that it could not be completed before April or May   of 1895.  Much was the ridicule heaped upon the hopeful, trustful ones, who declared and repeatedly asseverated to the contrary. This is indeed, then, a scientific demonstration. It has proved, in most striking manner, the oft-repeated declarations of our text-books, that the evidence of the mortal senses is unreliable.  A week ago Judge Hanna withdrew from the pastorate of the church, saying he gladly laid down his responsibilities to be succeeded by the grandest of ministers--the Bible and \"SCIENCE AND HEALTH WITH KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES.\" This action it appears, was the result of rules made by Mrs. Eddy. The sermons hereafter will consist of passages read from the two books by readers, who will be elected each year by the congregation.  A story has been abroad that Judge Hanna was so eloquent and magnetic that he was attracting listeners who came to hear him preach rather than in search of the truth as taught. Consequently the new rules were formulated.  But at Christian Science headquarters this is denied; Mrs. Eddy says the words of the judge speak to the point, and that no such inference is to be drawn therefrom.  In Mrs. Eddy's personal reminiscences, which are published under the title of \"Retrospection and Introspection,\" much is told of herself in detail that can only be touched upon in this brief sketch.  Aristocratic to the backbone, Mrs. Eddy takes delight in going back to the ancestral tree and in tracing those branches which are identified with good and great names both in Scotland and England.  Her family came to this country not long before the Revolution. Among the many souvenirs that Mrs. Eddy remembers as belonging to her grandparents was a heavy sword, encased in a brass scabbard, upon which had been inscribed the name of the kinsman upon whom the sword had been bestowed by Sir William Wallace of mighty Scottish fame.  Mrs. Eddy applied herself, like other girls, to her studies, though perhaps with an unusual zest, delighting in philosophy, logic, and moral science, as well as looking into the ancient languages, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.  Her last marriage was in the spring of 1877, when, at Lynn, Mass., she became the wife of Asa Gilbert Eddy. He was the first organizer of a Christian Science Sunday-School, of which he was the superintendent, and later he attracted the attention of many clergymen of other denominations by his able lectures upon scriptural topics. He died in 1882.  Mrs. Eddy is known to her circle of pupils and admirers as the editor and publisher of the first official organ of this sect. It was called the _Journal of Christian Science_, and has had great circulation with the members of this fast-increasing faith.  In recounting her experiences as the pioneer of Christian Science, she states that she sought knowledge concerning the physical side in this research through the different schools of allopathy, homeopathy, and so forth, without receiving any real satisfaction. No ancient or modern philosophy gave her any distinct statement of the science of mind healing. She claims that no human reason has been equal to the question.  And she also defines carefully the difference in the theories between faith cure and Christian Science, dwelling particularly upon the terms belief and understanding, which are the key words respectively used in the definitions of these two healing arts.  Besides her Boston home, Mrs. Eddy has a delightful country home one mile from the state house of New Hampshire's quiet capital, an easy driving distance for her when she wishes to catch a glimpse of the world. But for the most part she lives very much retired, driving rather into the country, which is so picturesque all about Concord and its surrounding villages.  The big house, so delightfully remodeled and modernized from a primitive homestead, that nothing is left excepting the angles and pitch of the roof, is remarkably well placed upon a terrace that slopes behind the buildings, while they themselves are in the midst of green stretches of lawns, dotted with beds of flowering shrubs, with here and there a fountain or summer-house.  Mrs. Eddy took the writer straight to her beloved \"lookout\"--a broad piazza on the south side of the second story of the house, where she can sit in her swinging chair, revelling in the lights and shades of spring and summer greenness. Or, as just then, in the gorgeous October coloring of the whole landscape that lies below, across the farm, which stretches on through an intervale of beautiful meadows and pastures to the woods that skirt the valley of the little truant river, as it wanders eastward.  It pleased her to point out her own birthplace. Straight as the crow flies, from her piazza, does it lie on the brow of Bow hill, and then she paused and reminded the reporter that Congressman Baker from New Hampshire, her cousin, was born and bred in that same neighborhood. The photograph of Hon. Hoke Smith, another distinguished relative, adorned the mantel.  Then my eye caught her family coat of arms and the diploma given her by the Society of the Daughters of the Revolution.  The natural and lawful pride that comes with a tincture of blue and brave blood, is perhaps one of her characteristics, as is many another well born woman's. She had a long list of worthy ancestors in colonial and revolutionary days, and the McNeils, and General Knox, figure largely in her genealogy, as well as the hero who killed the ill-starred Paugus.  This big, sunny room which Mrs. Eddy calls her den--or sometimes \"mother's room,\" when speaking of her many followers who consider her their spiritual leader--has the air of hospitality that marks its hostess herself. Mrs. Eddy has hung its walls with reproductions of some of Europe's masterpieces, a few of which had been the gifts of her loving pupils.  Looking down from the windows upon the tree-tops on the lower terrace, the reporter exclaimed: \"You have lived here only four years, and yet from a barren waste of most unpromising ground has come forth all this beauty!\"  \"Four years!\" she ejaculated; \"two and a half, only two and a half years.\" Then, touching my sleeve and pointing, she continued: \"Look at those big elms! I had them brought here in warm weather, almost as big as they are now, and not one died.\"  Mrs. Eddy talked earnestly of her friendships.... She told something of her domestic arrangements, of how she had long wished to get away from her busy career in Boston, and return to her native granite hills, there to build a substantial home that should do honor to that precinct of Concord.  She chose the stubbly, old farm on the road from Concord within one mile of the \"Eton of America,\" St. Paul's school. Once bought, the will of the woman set at work, and to-day a strikingly well kept estate is the first impression given to the visitor as he approaches Pleasant View.  She employs a number of men to keep the grounds and farm in perfect order, and it was pleasing to learn that this rich woman is using her money to promote the welfare of industrious workmen in whom she takes a vital interest.  Mrs. Eddy believes that \"the laborer is worthy of his hire,\" and, moreover, that he deserves to have a home and family of his own. Indeed, one of her motives in buying so large an estate was that she might do something for the toilers, and thus add her influence toward the advancement of better home life and citizenship.

This particular phase of religious belief has impressed itself upon a large and increasing number of Christian people, who have been tempted to examine its principles, and doubtless have been comforted and strengthened by them. Any new movement will awaken some sort of interest. There are many who have worn off the novelty and are thoroughly carried away with the requirements, simple and direct as they are, of Christian Science. The opposition against it from the so-called orthodox religious bodies keeps up a while, but after a little skirmishing, finally subsides. No one religious body holds the whole of truth, and whatever is likely to show even some one side of it will gain followers and live down any attempted repression.  Christian Science does not strike all as a system of truth. If it did, it would be a prodigy. Neither does the Christian faith produce the same impressions upon all. Freedom to believe or to dissent is a great privilege in these days. So when a number of conscientious followers apply themselves to a matter like Christian Science, they are enjoying that liberty which is their inherent right as human beings, and though they cannot escape censure, yet they are to be numbered among the many pioneers who are searching after religious truth. There is really nothing settled. Every truth is more or less in a state of agitation. The many who have worked in the mine of knowledge are glad to welcome others who have different methods, and with them bring different ideas.  It is too early to predict where this movement will go, and how greatly it will affect the well established methods. That it has produced a sensation in religious circles, and called forth the implements of theological warfare, is very well known. While it has done this, it may, on the other hand, have brought a benefit. Ere this many a new project in religious belief has stirred up feeling, but as time has gone on, compromises have been welcomed.  The erection of this temple will doubtless help on the growth of its principles. Pilgrims from everywhere will go there in search of truth, and some may be satisfied and some will not. Christian Science cannot absorb the world's thought. It may get the share of attention it deserves, but it can only aspire to take its place alongside other great demonstrations of religious belief which have done something good for the sake of humanity.  Wonders will never cease. Here is a church whose treasurer has to send out word that no sums except those already subscribed can be received! The Christian Scientists have a faith of the mustard-seed variety. What a pity some of our practical Christian folk have not a faith approximate to that of these \"impractical\" Christian Scientists.     (_Jackson Patriot_, Jackson, Mich. January 20, 1895.)  EXTRACT.  CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.   The erection of a massive temple in Boston by Christian Scientists, at a cost of over $200,000, love offerings of the disciples of MARY BAKER EDDY, reviver of the ancient faith and author of the text-book from which, with the New Testament at the foundation, believers receive light, health, and strength, is evidence of the rapid growth of the new movement. We call it new. It is not. The name Christian Science alone is new. At the beginning of Christianity it was taught and practiced by Jesus and his disciples. The Master was the great healer. But the wave of materialism and bigotry that swept over the world for fifteen centuries, covering it with the blackness of the Dark Ages, nearly obliterated all vital belief in his teachings. The Bible was a sealed book. Recently a revived belief in what he taught is manifest, and Christian Science is one result. No new doctrine is proclaimed, but there is the fresh development of a principle that was put into practice by the founder of Christianity nineteen hundred years ago, though practiced in other countries at any earlier date. \"The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done, is that which shall be done, and there is no new thing under the sun.\"  The condition which Jesus of Nazareth, on various occasions during the three years of his ministry on earth, declared to be essential, in the mind of both healer and patient, is contained in the one word--FAITH. Can drugs suddenly cure leprosy? When the ten lepers were cleansed and one returned to give thanks in Oriental phrase, Jesus said to him: \"Arise, go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.\" That was Christian Science. In his \"Law of Psychic Phenomena\" Hudson says: \"That word, more than any other, expresses the whole law of human felicity and power in this world and of salvation in the world to come.\" It is that attribute of mind which elevates man above the level of the brute, and gives dominion over the physical world. It is the essential element of success in every field of human endeavor. It constitutes the power of the human soul. When Jesus of Nazareth proclaimed its potency from the hilltops of Palestine he gave to mankind the key to health and heaven, and earned the title of \"Savior of the World.\" Whittier, grandest of mystic poets, saw the truth:    \"That healing gift He lends to them     Who use it in His name;   The power that filled his garment's hem     Is evermore the same.\"  Again, in a poem entitled \"The Master,\" he wrote:    \"The healing of his seamless dress     Is by our beds of pain;   We touch Him in life's throng and press,     And we are whole again.\"  [Footnote: About 1868, the author of SCIENCE AND HEALTH healed Mr. Whittier with one visit, at his home in Amesbury, of incipient pulmonary consumption.--M.B. EDDY.]  That Jesus operated in perfect harmony with natural law, not in defiance, suppression, or violation of it, we cannot doubt. The perfectly natural is the perfectly spiritual. Jesus enunciated and exemplified the principle; and, obviously, the conditions requisite in psychic healing to-day are the same as were necessary in apostolic times. We accept the statement of Hudson: \"There was no law of nature violated or transcended. On the contrary, the whole transaction was in perfect obedience to the laws of nature. He understood the law perfectly, as no one before him understood it; and in the plentitude of his power he applied it where the greatest good could be accomplished.\" A careful reading of the accounts of his healings, in the light of modern science, shows that he observed, in his practice of mental therapeutics, the conditions of environment and harmonious influence that are essential to success. In the case of Jairus' daughter they are fully set forth. He kept the unbelievers away, \"put them all out,\" and permitting only the father and mother, with his closest friends and followers, Peter, James, and John, in the chamber with him, and having thus the most perfect obtainable environment, he raised the daughter to life.    \"Not in blind caprice of will,   Not in cunning sleight of skill,   Not for show of power, was wrought   Nature's marvel in Thy thought.\"  In a previous article we have referred to cyclic changes that came during the last quarter of preceding centuries. Of our remarkable nineteenth century not the least eventful circumstance is the advent of Christian Science. That it should be the work of a woman is the natural outcome of a period notable for her emancipation from many of the thraldoms, prejudices, and oppressions of the past. We do not, therefore, regard it as a mere coincidence that the first edition of Mrs. Eddy's \"SCIENCE AND HEALTH\" should have been published in 1875. Since then she has revised it many times, and the ninety-first edition is announced. Her discovery was first called \"the science of divine metaphysical healing.\" Afterward she selected the name Christian Science. It is based upon what is held to be scientific certainty, namely,--that all causation is of Mind, every effect has its origin in desire and thought. The theology--if we may use the word--of Christian Science is contained in the volume entitled \"SCIENCE AND HEALTH WITH KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES.\"  The present Boston congregation was organized April 19, 1879, and has now over 4,000 members. It is regarded as the parent organization, all others being branches, though each is entirely independent in the management of its own affairs. Truth is the sole recognized authority. Of actual members of different congregations there are between 100,000 and 200,000. One or more organized societies have sprung up in New York, Chicago, Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Detroit, Toledo, Milwaukee, Madison, Scranton, Peoria, Atlanta, Toronto, and nearly every other centre of population, besides a large and growing number of receivers of the faith among the members of all the churches and non-church-going people. In some churches a majority of the members are Christian Scientists, and, as a rule, are the most intelligent.  Space does not admit of an elaborate presentation on the occasion of the erection of the temple, in Boston, the dedication taking place on the 6th of January, of one of the most remarkable, helpful, and powerful movements of the last quarter of the century. Christian Science has brought hope and comfort to many weary souls. It makes people better and happier. Welding Christianity and Science, hitherto divorced because dogma and truth could not unite, was a happy inspiration.    \"And still we love the evil cause,     And of the just effect complain;   We tread upon life's broken laws,     And mourn our self-inflicted pain.\"     (_The Outlook_, New York, January 19, 1895.)
