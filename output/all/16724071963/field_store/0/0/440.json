Cracky, I was glad it was moonlight, that’s one sure thing.  As soon as he had a good fire started he stuffed some of the damp excelsior in and shut the door, and told Artie Van Arlen (he’s their patrol leader) to hold a rag over the crack in the door, because the black smoke was pouring out that way, especially because the damper in the pipe was shut.  I didn’t stay there long, because the smoke was too thick for me and when I saw Artie bind a wet rag over Wig’s eyes and mouth, I knew then it was going to be mighty bad in that little cabin.  “Have another ready,” I heard him say; “better have three or four of them.”  Then he put his hand on the damper in the pipe and turned it and then the smoke in the cabin wasn’t so bad. He just turned it around quick and kept turning it around and that let little puffs of smoke through, and I heard the fellows up on the roof shouting, “Hurrah!” so I knew it was working all right. He sent up a lot of little puffs like that, just so as to draw attention, and he kept doing it so long I got impatient.  “No use talking till you know somebody’s listening,” he said, kind of pleasant like to me. I guess maybe he never liked me very much, because I didn’t want that badge to get into their patrol, and anyway he’s kind of sober, sort of, and maybe he thought I had too much nonsense. But, oh, boy, I was strong for him now. And I could see how he began to cough and I was worried.  Then he groped around to get hold of the damper, for he was blindfolded and the smoke in there was getting thicker and thicker. Then he gave it a quick turn, then waited a few seconds, then held it lengthwise with the pipe for about twenty seconds.  _R_ I said to myself.  Then he opened the damper three times, each about twenty seconds, and I could hear the fellows up on the roof shouting.  “O! It’s a good O! Bully for Wig Weigand!”  “Give me another towel, quick,” he said to Artie. “Is the window open? You better go up, Kid.”  It was the first time he ever called me kid and he had to cough when he said it. But I just couldn’t move. There was something in my throat and my eyes that wasn’t smoke, and I said, “I can stand it if you can—Wig.”  “Go on up, kid,” he said, “we’ve—got—got—her—talking—now,” and he coughed and choked.  “Go on up, Roy,” Artie Van Arlen said.  Up on the roof all the fellows were sitting around the edge with their legs over, watching the black column in the sky, and shouting when they read the letters. But I was thinking about those fellows down in that cabin filled with smoke and how they were doing that all on account of me.  “Pretty smoky down there,” one of the Elks said to me.  “You said something,” I told him.  “He’s marking up the sky all right, if he can only stick it out,” another fellow said. “Who’s down there with him?”  “Artie,” I said.  “They’ll stick it out, all right,” Westy Martin said; “it’s easier for Artie, he can stay near the window.”  “Bully for you, Wig, old boy!” somebody shouted, just as the E in _SAFE_ shot up. And I knew what it meant—it meant that the words _Roy is safe_ had been printed in great big black letters across the sky.  Then it came faster and faster and it seemed as if he must be turning that damper like a telegraph operator moves his key. “Don’t worry,” it said, “reports false,” “Roy Blakeley safe,” “Roy safe,” “Blakeley alive.” He said it all kinds of different ways.  Once Artie came up coughing and choking and watched a few seconds to see if the wind was blowing the smoke away as fast as the signs were made, because that was important.  “It’s lucky we have that wind,” he said, and then went down again in a hurry.  Pretty soon we could see some searchlights far away and I guess they were on the ships. But ours was different and nearer to Bridgeboro, and people would be sure to see it, only maybe they wouldn’t understand it and that’s what made me worry. I’m good on reading smudge signals, even though I never sent many and I never have to have the _Handbook_ when I read the code, that’s one thing. And I didn’t pay much attention to all the talking and yelling, only kept my eyes up in the sky, watching that long smoky column. It beat any searchlight _you_ ever saw. “Roy alive”—“Roy alive” it kept saying and sometimes “don’t worry.” I didn’t see how any fellow could manage a smudge and send it so fast and keep his spaces. The last word before it stopped was _SAFE_, or that’s what it was meant to be, only the short flash for E didn’t come. The fellows all began shouting when there wasn’t any more, and I heard Pee-wee shout downstairs, “Aren’t you going to put the name of the boat?”  “Do you want him to crack the sky open?” I heard a fellow say, and they all laughed.  But I remembered how that last E didn’t come and I started down the ladder for all I was worth. I scrambled around the narrow part of the deck to the window and called, but nobody answered. The smoke was coming out thick.  “Wig,” I said, “are you there? Are you all right? Artie, where are you?”  I had to turn away my face on account of the smoke. I pulled off my scout scarf and tied it over my mouth, so that it covered my ears too. Then I looked in and down low, because I knew that the smoke wouldn’t be so thick near the floor. And I saw Wig Weigand lying there right under the stove pipe and his hand was reaching up holding the damper, and his hand was all white like and his eyes were wide open and staring. Then I shouted for all I was worth.  “Doc! come down—hurry! Send Doc Carson down, Wig Weigand is dead—he’s suffocated.”                                    CHAPTER X                                 THE RAVENS   Doc Carson is a Raven and he’s our First Aid Scout. He always has some things with him, because that’s our rule. But you can bet I didn’t wait for him. And I didn’t care if I was killed or not, I didn’t, if Wig Weigand was killed.  So I jumped right through the window and the smoke got into my eyes and made my ears ring, but I didn’t care. I could taste it all thick, too, but I didn’t care. That was the smoke that had to do what Wigley Weigand told it to, and he scribbled all over the sky with it, that’s what he did, and now it had turned around and killed him.  I knew that up to six or seven inches from the floor there is never much smoke and I knew he must have lain down low when he was almost unconscious and worked that damper. And those fellows up there had been laughing and cheering all the while, when he was lying there like that.  I didn’t see Artie anywhere and there wasn’t any sound. I lay down flat and crawled over to Wig and you bet I worked quick. I tied his hands together with my scout scarf—it was the Silver Fox scarf—and I tied the scarf around my neck.  “Wig,” I said, but he didn’t speak and his legs and his neck hung loose, sort of, and it kind of scared me. Then I crawled to the window, because I couldn’t see the door, dragging him after me. Then I did something I never thought I could do, but maybe you’ve noticed you can do most anything when you have to. I just stood up, then fell down again, coughing and choking, and my ears were buzzing all the time. But I didn’t care, I just stood up again with him hanging to me, and I grabbed the window sill and dragged him half way across it and with his head outside, and then I staggered and tried to grab something and my eyes were stinging and, oh, I don’t know, all of a sudden my head knocked and I didn’t know any more.  Mr. Ellsworth says that Doc ought to write the rest of this chapter, but he wouldn’t, and it’s just like him. The next thing I knew I was sitting on the lowest step and Connie Bennett was holding my head. “You’re all right,” he said, “but you got a good bump. You were only there a few seconds.”  “Did you pull me out?” I said. “Where’s Wig?”  “Doc brought him around,” he said, “he got him breathing, then it was easy. We can’t find Artie.”  Maybe it was funny, but just then I didn’t seem to be thinking about Artie. I felt my head and found I had a big bump on it. “I should worry about that,” I said. “Where’s Wig?”  Then I got up and went around the cabin to the forward deck and there were all the fellows and Wig sitting up and Doc Carson holding him and moving him, so as to keep him breathing—scout fashion.  “All righto, kid,” Doc said, kind of pleasant, “you’re a brick.”  I always thought that I was as big as he was, but he called me kid, and I didn’t care. Anyway, I couldn’t see him very good, I admit that. Because—oh, well, maybe you can understand.  “Artie’s missing,” he said. “You didn’t see anything of him in there?”  “I couldn’t see at all, hardly,” I told him.  Then Wig turned his head and looked at me and he was all white and weak looking, especially when he smiled. And he had the remains of my Silver Fox scarf, all torn, around his neck.  “All right?” he said very low.  But I just couldn’t speak to him. I don’t know what made me do it, but I went up to him and he looked at the bump on my forehead and said, “Hurt?”  “You should worry about that,” I told him. Then I kind of fixed the Silver Fox scarf better, so that it was around his neck and I tied it in the Silver Fox knot. “Your fellows won’t mind if you wear it a little while,” I said, and then I unfastened his own scarf, yellow and brown, and tied it around my neck. “There’s no fellow can get this away from me to-night,” I said, “I’m going to wear the Raven scarf—I am.”  Then, all of a sudden, I noticed that Doc had gone away and I was holding his head up alone. So I let it down on the cushion very easy and I saw we were all alone. Maybe you won’t understand and it’s hard to tell you. But I didn’t say anything; I just stayed there and rubbed his forehead.  “We told her,” he said, kind of as if he was weak and tired.  “Yop,” I said, “you told her.”  “Somebody’ll get it—maybe,” he said.  “I ain’t thinking about that,” I said, “I’m only thinking"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10552"],["title","Roy Blakeley: His Story (#8)"],["body","how you did it. I—I don’t want the signalling badge in my patrol now, honest I don’t, Wig. I want it to stay where it belongs. And I want there to be only just the one in the troop. I got mad first. That’s because I’m always getting mad, I guess. But there will never be any signalling badge in my patrol, Wig. That’s going to be the rule.”  “There’ll be a Gold Cross though,” he said. And then he shut his eyes.  But I stayed right there—just because—oh, I don’t know, just because I wanted to stay right there. You can’t always tell why you want to do a thing.                                    CHAPTER XI                                    LOST   Now when Wig said that about the Gold Cross I thought it was just because he was weak and didn’t know what he was saying. Because, maybe you know as well as I do, that the Gold Cross isn’t so easy to get. Only one fellow in our troop ever got it, and that was Tom Slade. Maybe I took a chance when I went into all that smoke, I’m not saying I didn’t, but if I got anything at all, it would be the Bronze Medal, I guess, but nix on the Gold Cross. You don’t find gold crosses growing around on every bush, you can bet. Anyway, I didn’t want any honor medal because I knew Wig wouldn’t get one (because they’re only for lifesaving) and, gee, if he didn’t deserve one, I’m sure I didn’t.  Anyway this wasn’t any time to be thinking about medals, because Artie Van Arlen was missing and that was the principal thing we had to think about. He wasn’t on the house-boat, that was one sure thing, because we looked everywhere and couldn’t find him. Wig said he remembered somebody speaking to him when he was lying there, and he guessed it must have been Artie. He didn’t know what he said though.  The fellows were all excited about it, especially because the boat was just beginning to float, and we didn’t know whether we’d better anchor there and wait to see if he turned up. Two of the fellows climbed down and swam around and the rest kept calling. It wasn’t very deep yet and they could even feel around the flats, but they couldn’t find him anywhere.  I went around and looked at the window and even then the cabin was filled with smoke, but not so thick. Believe me, I wished that Tom Slade was there then, because he’s great on deducing and finding clues and all like that. That’s why we always called him Sherlock Nobody Holmes. Anyway, I couldn’t make out what happened. Artie might have staggered up against the window to get air, but I didn’t see how he could fall out, and if he was able to climb out then why didn’t he come up where the rest of us were?  I couldn’t make anything out of it; all I knew was he was gone. I knew he must have been drowned and his body been carried up by the tide, which was running up strong now.  Well, you can bet we didn’t have any fun drifting up. Nobody said anything much; we just sat around the edge of the deck with our staffs and pushed her off, whenever she ran against the shore.  Charlie Seabury sat next to me and after a while he said, “Who’s going to tell his people?”  “I am,” I told him, “because I’m to blame for the whole business.”  “Nobody’s to blame,” he said.  “Yes, I am,” I said, “they just did it on account of me.”  “That’s because all the fellows like you,” he said, “and they like to do anything for you.”  Anyway, it wasn’t so necessary, I see that now, and it’s just the same as if I killed him. Gee, I wish it was I that got killed, I know that. Cracky, I deserved to after being such a fool.  After that, nobody spoke for a long time, then Hunt Ward, who’s in the Elk Patrol, said, “It’s the first fellow in our troop that died. I guess we won’t go up to camp now.”  “Not in this boat, anyway,” I said.  Then after a while I said, “We’ll send his name in and they’ll print it in _Boys Life_.”  “I know,” Hunt said, “with a black line around it.”  Yet we kind of kept hoping all the time, even though we knew there wasn’t any sense in it.  “_You_ thought _you_ were a goner,” Hunt said, “and you came back all right.”  Now I was a big fool that it didn’t put a certain idea in my head when he said that, but I only said, “Yes, but that was different.”  Then Dorry Benton, who was two or three fellows away from me, said, “One thing is sure, he went through the window and into the water. Maybe he was half conscious and didn’t remember there was only a narrow strip of deck there. And he must have tumbled right off it.”  “I don’t know,” I said, “only if he isn’t in the boat then he must be in the water and if he fell in the water and couldn’t swim or shout either, then he must be drowned.”  Then nobody said anything and we just sat there keeping her off shore and watching her drift up. When we got around Bentley’s turn we could see the lights in Bridgeboro and then was when I began to realize and I hated to get home. I wished the tide wouldn’t take us so fast. Some of the fellows walked around on the roof, but none of them said anything. I wished it was me instead of Artie, I know that. I ought to have been satisfied to escape without getting the Ravens to do that—I mean send that message for me. Anyway, I made up my mind I’d be the one to tell Mr. Ellsworth about it, and Artie’s people too, and I’d take all the blame.  I guess nobody said anything more all the way up, until we came near the Field Club landing. The shore is like low cliffs here and after we got her over against it, a couple of the fellows got out and towed her along with ropes, till we came to the long float.  “Are we going to tie her at the float?” Connie Bennett asked, very sober like. Gee, it sounded funny to hear someone speak. Doc Carson said, “Yes.” He was kind of like head of the three patrols now, because he has the most sense of all of us, I guess, and Tom Slade, who is head of the Elks, is away and I decided, all of a sudden, that I wasn’t much of a patrol leader, and Artie—he was—he wasn’t there.  “Look out for that canoe,” somebody said, just as we were coming alongside the float.  “They shouldn’t have left it there,” Connie said; “that’s no place for a canoe.” I guess we were all kind of nervous and cranky like.  Then I saw that there was a black figure sitting on the lowest step of the boathouse. I was just going to call “Who’s there?” when Doc said, “Pull that canoe out of the way before we smash it in.”  So I jumped off onto the float and grabbed the canoe, and g-o-o-d night! it was my Indian dugout.                                   CHAPTER XII                             ARTIE’S ADVENTURE   Then I heard one of the fellows shouting, “_Look who’s here!_” and I saw the fellow who had been sitting on the steps coming toward the float, and I could tell it was Artie Van Arlen. Then I could hear Pee-wee dancing on the cabin roof and screaming, “The plot grows thicker! The plot grows thicker!”—good night, the kid was almost having a fit.  “If it wouldn’t be too much trouble,” I said to Artie, “would you please relate your adventures. I see that you’re not dead.”  “Well, not so you’d notice it,” he said, “but I guess I came pretty near it.”  Then I could see he was all in and must have had a pretty hard time of it, but I couldn’t help kidding him, because I was feeling so good to know he was safe. Believe me, that fellow had some adventure.  “It was lucky for me,” he said, “that you tied this crazy canoe or whatever you call it——”  “That is an Indian dugout, if anyone should ask you,” I said, “and if I wanted to sell it to an antiquary——”  “A what?” Pee-wee shouted down from the cabin roof.  “An antiquary,” I said; “comes from the Latin word _aunt_ and the Chinese word _query_, meaning to _ask questions_—otherwise the same as Pee-wee. As I was saying, if I wanted to sell it to an antiquary I could get a large check for it.”  “How large?” Pee-wee shouted.  “About eight inches by two and a half inches; now, shut up!” I said.  Cracky, you should have heard those fellows laugh.  “Well, whatever it is,” said Artie, “it’s lucky for me that you tied it just under the cabin window, because I fell into it—I fell in good and hard.”  “I think you fell in soft,” I said; “it shows how thoughtful I am. A scout is foresighted——”  “You make me sick!” Pee-wee shouted.  “Tell Doc Carson to give you some medicine,” I answered.  Laugh! Because, you see, we were all feeling so good about Artie being saved that we’d laugh at nothing, like a lot of girls. But girls are all right, I have to admit that.  Let’s see, where was I? Oh, yes, I was telling you about Artie. You see when I first arrived with that canoe I tied it just under the cabin window and then scrambled up through the window. So there it was all the time. Lucky thing, too. Only the funny thing was we never missed it—we were punk scouts, that’s sure.  Then Artie told us how it was. “After the smoke got so thick that I was dizzy and couldn’t see, I got scared and groped around for Wig. I couldn’t find him anywhere and he didn’t answer. I didn’t know whether all of the signal had been sent or not, but anyway I knew I couldn’t stand it in there any longer. I thought Wig must have climbed out of the window. So I decided I would do the same thing. Oh, but didn’t I have some job finding it! I lay down flat, I knew enough to do that anyway, and then I crawled around with one hand up feeling for the window sill. When I found it I was so dizzy I just hung to it and I thought I was a goner sure.”  “I know how you felt,” I said, “because I was in the same trouble myself.”  Then he said how he dragged himself up to the window sill and tried to shout, but couldn’t. Then he fell across it and kind of wriggled out. He didn’t have his senses, but he knew enough to know that there was a narrow part of the deck, just a passageway sort of, outside, and he thought he’d fall on that. But it was lucky he didn’t. He fell past it right into the water and that brought him to his senses, kind of. So he sputtered and groped around till he happened to clutch the Indian dugout and "]]]
