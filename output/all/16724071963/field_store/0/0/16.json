Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!     Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!  See how he scorneth human arguments,     So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail     Than his own wings, between so distant shores.  See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,     Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,     That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!”  Then as still nearer and more near us came     The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,     So that near by the eye could not endure him,  But down I cast it; and he came to shore     With a small vessel, very swift and light,     So that the water swallowed naught thereof.  Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;     Beatitude seemed written in his face,     And more than a hundred spirits sat within.  “In exitu Israel de Aegypto!”     They chanted all together in one voice,     With whatso in that psalm is after written.  Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,     Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,     And he departed swiftly as he came.  The throng which still remained there unfamiliar     Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,     As one who in new matters makes essay.  On every side was darting forth the day.     The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts     From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,  When the new people lifted up their faces     Towards us, saying to us: “If ye know,     Show us the way to go unto the mountain.”  And answer made Virgilius: “Ye believe     Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,     But we are strangers even as yourselves.  Just now we came, a little while before you,     Another way, which was so rough and steep,     That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.”  The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,     Become aware that I was still alive,     Pallid in their astonishment became;  And as to messenger who bears the olive     The people throng to listen to the news,     And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,  So at the sight of me stood motionless     Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if     Oblivious to go and make them fair.  One from among them saw I coming forward,     As to embrace me, with such great affection,     That it incited me to do the like.  O empty shadows, save in aspect only!     Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,     As oft returned with them to my own breast!  I think with wonder I depicted me;     Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;     And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.  Gently it said that I should stay my steps;     Then knew I who it was, and I entreated     That it would stop awhile to speak with me.  It made reply to me: “Even as I loved thee     In mortal body, so I love thee free;     Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”  “My own Casella! to return once more     There where I am, I make this journey,” said I;     “But how from thee has so much time be taken?”  And he to me: “No outrage has been done me,     If he who takes both when and whom he pleases     Has many times denied to me this passage,  For of a righteous will his own is made.     He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken     Whoever wished to enter with all peace;  Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore     Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,     Benignantly by him have been received.  Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,     Because for evermore assemble there     Those who tow’rds Acheron do not descend.”  And I: “If some new law take not from thee     Memory or practice of the song of love,     Which used to quiet in me all my longings,  Thee may it please to comfort therewithal     Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body     Hitherward coming is so much distressed.”  “Love, that within my mind discourses with me,”     Forthwith began he so melodiously,     The melody within me still is sounding.  My Master, and myself, and all that people     Which with him were, appeared as satisfied     As if naught else might touch the mind of any.  We all of us were moveless and attentive     Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,     Exclaiming: “What is this, ye laggard spirits?  What negligence, what standing still is this?     Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,     That lets not God be manifest to you.”  Even as when, collecting grain or tares,     The doves, together at their pasture met,     Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,  If aught appear of which they are afraid,     Upon a sudden leave their food alone,     Because they are assailed by greater care;  So that fresh company did I behold     The song relinquish, and go tow’rds the hill,     As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;  Nor was our own departure less in haste.     Purgatorio: Canto III   Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight     Had scattered them asunder o’er the plain,     Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,  I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,     And how without him had I kept my course?     Who would have led me up along the mountain?  He seemed to me within himself remorseful;     O noble conscience, and without a stain,     How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!  After his feet had laid aside the haste     Which mars the dignity of every act,     My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,  Let loose its faculties as if delighted,     And I my sight directed to the hill     That highest tow’rds the heaven uplifts itself.  The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,     Was broken in front of me into the figure     Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;  Unto one side I turned me, with the fear     Of being left alone, when I beheld     Only in front of me the ground obscured.  “Why dost thou still mistrust?” my Comforter     Began to say to me turned wholly round;     “Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?  ’Tis evening there already where is buried     The body within which I cast a shadow;     ’Tis from Brundusium ta’en, and Naples has it.  Now if in front of me no shadow fall,     Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,     Because one ray impedeth not another  To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,     Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills     That how it works be not unveiled to us.  Insane is he who hopeth that our reason     Can traverse the illimitable way,     Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!  Mortals, remain contented at the ‘Quia;’     For if ye had been able to see all,     No need there were for Mary to give birth;  And ye have seen desiring without fruit,     Those whose desire would have been quieted,     Which evermore is given them for a grief.  I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,     And many others;”—and here bowed his head,     And more he said not, and remained disturbed.  We came meanwhile unto the mountain’s foot;     There so precipitate we found the rock,     That nimble legs would there have been in vain.  ’Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,     The most secluded pathway is a stair     Easy and open, if compared with that.  “Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill     Slopes down,” my Master said, his footsteps staying,     “So that who goeth without wings may mount?”  And while he held his eyes upon the ground     Examining the nature of the path,     And I was looking up around the rock,  On the left hand appeared to me a throng     Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,     And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.  “Lift up thine eyes,” I to the Master said;     “Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,     If thou of thine own self can have it not.”  Then he looked at me, and with frank expression     Replied: “Let us go there, for they come slowly,     And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.”  Still was that people as far off from us,     After a thousand steps of ours I say,     As a good thrower with his hand would reach,  When they all crowded unto the hard masses     Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,     As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.  “O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!”     Virgilius made beginning, “by that peace     Which I believe is waiting for you all,  Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,     So that the going up be possible,     For to lose time irks him most who most knows.”  As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold     By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand     Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,  And what the foremost does the others do,     Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,     Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;  So moving to approach us thereupon     I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,     Modest in face and dignified in gait.  As soon as those in the advance saw broken     The light upon the ground at my right side,     So that from me the shadow reached the rock,  They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;     And all the others, who came after them,     Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.  “Without your asking, I confess to you     This is a human body which you see,     Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.  Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded     That not without a power which comes from Heaven     Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.”  The Master thus; and said those worthy people:     “Return ye then, and enter in before us,”     Making a signal with the back o’ the hand  And one of them began: “Whoe’er thou art,     Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well     If e’er thou saw me in the other world.”  I turned me tow’rds him, and looked at him closely;     Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,     But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.  When with humility I had disclaimed     E’er having seen him, “Now behold!” he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1002"],["title","Divine Comedy, Longfellow's Translation, Purgatory (#2)"],["body","id,     And showed me high upon his breast a wound.  Then said he with a smile: “I am Manfredi,     The grandson of the Empress Costanza;     Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee  Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother     Of Sicily’s honour and of Aragon’s,     And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.  After I had my body lacerated     By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself     Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.  Horrible my iniquities had been;     But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,     That it receives whatever turns to it.  Had but Cosenza’s pastor, who in chase     Of me was sent by Clement at that time,     In God read understandingly this page,  The bones of my dead body still would be     At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,     Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.  Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,     Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,     Where he transported them with tapers quenched.  By malison of theirs is not so lost     Eternal Love, that it cannot return,     So long as hope has anything of green.  True is it, who in contumacy dies     Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,     Must wait upon the outside this bank  Thirty times told the time that he has been     In his presumption, unless such decree     Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.  See now if thou hast power to make me happy,     By making known unto my good Costanza     How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,  For those on earth can much advance us here.”     Purgatorio: Canto IV   Whenever by delight or else by pain,     That seizes any faculty of ours,     Wholly to that the soul collects itself,  It seemeth that no other power it heeds;     And this against that error is which thinks     One soul above another kindles in us.  And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen     Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,     Time passes on, and we perceive it not,  Because one faculty is that which listens,     And other that which the soul keeps entire;     This is as if in bonds, and that is free.  Of this I had experience positive     In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;     For fifty full degrees uprisen was  The sun, and I had not perceived it, when     We came to where those souls with one accord     Cried out unto us: “Here is what you ask.”  A greater opening ofttimes hedges up     With but a little forkful of his thorns     The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,  Than was the passage-way through which ascended     Only my Leader and myself behind him,     After that company departed from us.  One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,     And mounts the summit of Bismantova,     With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;  With the swift pinions and the plumes I say     Of great desire, conducted after him     Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.  We mounted upward through the rifted rock,     And on each side the border pressed upon us,     And feet and hands the ground beneath required.  When we were come upon the upper rim     Of the high bank, out on the open slope,     “My Master,” said I, “what way shall we take?”  And he to me: “No step of thine descend;     Still up the mount behind me win thy way,     Till some sage escort shall appear to us.”  The summit was so high it vanquished sight,     And the hillside precipitous far more     Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.  Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:     “O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold     How I remain alone, unless thou stay!”  “O son,” he said, “up yonder drag thyself,”     Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,     Which on that side encircles all the hill.  These words of his so spurred me on, that I     Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,     Until the circle was beneath my feet.  Thereon ourselves we seated both of us     Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,     For all men are delighted to look back.  To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,     Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered     That on the left hand we were smitten by it.  The Poet well perceived that I was wholly     Bewildered at the chariot of the light,     Where ’twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.  Whereon he said to me: “If Castor and Pollux     Were in the company of yonder mirror,     That up and down conducteth with its light,  Thou wouldst behold the zodiac’s jagged wheel     Revolving still more near unto the Bears,     Unless it swerved aside from its old track.  How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,     Collected in thyself, imagine Zion     Together with this mount on earth to stand,  So that they both one sole horizon have,     And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road     Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,  Thou’lt see how of necessity must pass     This on one side, when that upon the other,     If thine intelligence right clearly heed.”  “Truly, my Master,” said I, “never yet     Saw I so clearly as I now discern,     There where my wit appeared incompetent,  That the mid-circle of supernal motion,     Which in some art is the Equator called,     And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,  For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence     Tow’rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews     Beheld it tow’rds the region of the heat.  But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn     How far we have to go; for the hill rises     Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.”  And he to me: “This mount is such, that ever     At the beginning down below ’tis tiresome,     And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.  Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,     That going up shall be to thee as easy     As going down the current in a boat,  Then at this pathway’s ending thou wilt be;     There to repose thy panting breath expect;     No more I answer; and this I know for true.”  And as he finished uttering these words,     A voice close by us sounded: “Peradventure     Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.”  At sound thereof each one of us turned round,     And saw upon the left hand a great rock,     Which neither I nor he before had noticed.  Thither we drew; and there were persons there     Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,     As one through indolence is wont to stand.  And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,     Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,     Holding his face low down between them bowed.  “O my sweet Lord,” I said, “do turn thine eye     On him who shows himself more negligent     Then even Sloth herself his sister were.”  Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,     Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,     And said: “Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.”  Then knew I who he was; and the distress,     That still a little did my breathing quicken,     My going to him hindered not; and after  I came to him he hardly raised his head,     Saying: “Hast thou seen clearly how the sun     O’er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?”  His sluggish attitude and his curt words     A little unto laughter moved my lips;     Then I began: “Belacqua, I grieve not  For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated     In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?     Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?”  And he: “O brother, what’s the use of climbing?     Since to my torment would not let me go     The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.  First heaven must needs so long revolve me round     Outside thereof, as in my life it did,     Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,  Unless, e’er that, some prayer may bring me aid     Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;     What profit others that in heaven are heard not?”  Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,     And saying: “Come now; see the sun has touched     Meridian, and from the shore the night  Covers already with her foot Morocco.”     Purgatorio: Canto V   I had already from those shades departed,     And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,     When from behind, pointing his finger at me,  One shouted: “See, it seems as if shone not     The sunshine on the left of him below,     And like one living seems he to conduct him.”  Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,     And saw them watching with astonishment     But me, but me, and the light which was broken!  “Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,”     The Master said, “that thou thy pace dost slacken?     What matters it to thee what here is whispered?  Come after me, and let the people talk;     Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags     Its top for all the blowing of the winds;  For evermore the man in whom is springing     Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,     Because the force of one the other weakens.”  What could I say in answer but “I come”?     I said it somewhat with that colour tinged     Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.  Meanwhile along the mountain-side across     Came people in advance of us a little,     Singing the Miserere verse by verse.  When they became aware I gave no place     For passage of the sunshine through my body,     They changed their song into a long, hoarse “Oh!”  And two of them, in form of messengers,     Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,     “Of your condition make us cognisant.”  And said my Master: “Ye can go your way     And carry back again to those who sent you,     That this one’s body is of very flesh.  If they stood still because they saw his shadow,     As I suppose, enough is answered them;     Him let them honour, it may profit them.”  Vapours enkindled saw I ne’er so swiftly     At early nightfall cleave the air serene,     Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,  But upward they returned in briefer time,     And, on arriving, with the others wheeled     Tow’rds us, like troops that run without a rein.  “This folk that presses unto us is great,     And cometh to implore thee,” said the Poet;     “So still go onward, and in going"]]]
