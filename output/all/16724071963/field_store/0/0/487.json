Taug saw him depart, and then, quite casually, the big beast hunted closer and closer to Teeka in his search for food.  At last he was within a few feet of her, and when he shot a covert glance at her he saw that she was appraising him and that there was no evidence of anger upon her face.  Taug expanded his great chest and rolled about on his short legs, making strange growlings in his throat.  He raised his lips, baring his fangs.  My, but what great, beautiful fangs he had! Teeka could not but notice them.  She also let her eyes rest in admiration upon Taug's beetling brows and his short, powerful neck.  What a beautiful creature he was indeed!  Taug, flattered by the unconcealed admiration in her eyes, strutted about, as proud and as vain as a peacock.  Presently he began to inventory his assets, mentally, and shortly he found himself comparing them with those of his rival.  Taug grunted, for there was no comparison.  How could one compare his beautiful coat with the smooth and naked hideousness of Tarzan's bare hide? Who could see beauty in the stingy nose of the Tarmangani after looking at Taug's broad nostrils? And Tarzan's eyes! Hideous things, showing white about them, and entirely unrimmed with red.  Taug knew that his own blood-shot eyes were beautiful, for he had seen them reflected in the glassy surface of many a drinking pool.  The bull drew nearer to Teeka, finally squatting close against her. When Tarzan returned from his hunting a short time later it was to see Teeka contentedly scratching the back of his rival.  Tarzan was disgusted.  Neither Taug nor Teeka saw him as he swung through the trees into the glade.  He paused a moment, looking at them; then, with a sorrowful grimace, he turned and faded away into the labyrinth of leafy boughs and festooned moss out of which he had come.  Tarzan wished to be as far away from the cause of his heartache as he could.  He was suffering the first pangs of blighted love, and he didn't quite know what was the matter with him.  He thought that he was angry with Taug, and so he couldn't understand why it was that he had run away instead of rushing into mortal combat with the destroyer of his happiness.  He also thought that he was angry with Teeka, yet a vision of her many beauties persisted in haunting him, so that he could only see her in the light of love as the most desirable thing in the world.  The ape-boy craved affection.  From babyhood until the time of her death, when the poisoned arrow of Kulonga had pierced her savage heart, Kala had represented to the English boy the sole object of love which he had known.  In her wild, fierce way Kala had loved her adopted son, and Tarzan had returned that love, though the outward demonstrations of it were no greater than might have been expected from any other beast of the jungle.  It was not until he was bereft of her that the boy realized how deep had been his attachment for his mother, for as such he looked upon her.  In Teeka he had seen within the past few hours a substitute for Kala--someone to fight for and to hunt for--someone to caress; but now his dream was shattered.  Something hurt within his breast.  He placed his hand over his heart and wondered what had happened to him.  Vaguely he attributed his pain to Teeka.  The more he thought of Teeka as he had last seen her, caressing Taug, the more the thing within his breast hurt him.  Tarzan shook his head and growled; then on and on through the jungle he swung, and the farther he traveled and the more he thought upon his wrongs, the nearer he approached becoming an irreclaimable misogynist.  Two days later he was still hunting alone--very morose and very unhappy; but he was determined never to return to the tribe.  He could not bear the thought of seeing Taug and Teeka always together.  As he swung upon a great limb Numa, the lion, and Sabor, the lioness, passed beneath him, side by side, and Sabor leaned against the lion and bit playfully at his cheek.  It was a half-caress. Tarzan sighed and hurled a nut at them.  Later he came upon several of Mbonga's black warriors.  He was upon the point of dropping his noose about the neck of one of them, who was a little distance from his companions, when he became interested in the thing which occupied the savages.  They were building a cage in the trail and covering it with leafy branches.  When they had completed their work the structure was scarcely visible.  Tarzan wondered what the purpose of the thing might be, and why, when they had built it, they turned away and started back along the trail in the direction of their village.  It had been some time since Tarzan had visited the blacks and looked down from the shelter of the great trees which overhung their palisade upon the activities of his enemies, from among whom had come the slayer of Kala.  Although he hated them, Tarzan derived considerable entertainment in watching them at their daily life within the village, and especially at their dances, when the fires glared against their naked bodies as they leaped and turned and twisted in mimic warfare.  It was rather in the hope of witnessing something of the kind that he now followed the warriors back toward their village, but in this he was disappointed, for there was no dance that night.  Instead, from the safe concealment of his tree, Tarzan saw little groups seated about tiny fires discussing the events of the day, and in the darker corners of the village he descried isolated couples talking and laughing together, and always one of each couple was a young man and the other a young woman.  Tarzan cocked his head upon one side and thought, and before he went to sleep that night, curled in the crotch of the great tree above the village, Teeka filled his mind, and afterward she filled his dreams--she and the young black men laughing and talking with the young black women.  Taug, hunting alone, had wandered some distance from the balance of the tribe.  He was making his way slowly along an elephant path when he discovered that it was blocked with undergrowth.  Now Taug, come into maturity, was an evil-natured brute of an exceeding short temper.  When something thwarted him, his sole idea was to overcome it by brute strength and ferocity, and so now when he found his way blocked, he tore angrily into the leafy screen and an instant later found himself within a strange lair, his progress effectually blocked, notwithstanding his most violent efforts to forge ahead.  Biting and striking at the barrier, Taug finally worked himself into a frightful rage, but all to no avail; and at last he became convinced that he must turn back.  But when he would have done so, what was his chagrin to discover that another barrier had dropped behind him while he fought to break down the one before him! Taug was trapped.  Until exhaustion overcame him he fought frantically for his freedom; but all for naught.  In the morning a party of blacks set out from the village of Mbonga in the direction of the trap they had constructed the previous day, while among the branches of the trees above them hovered a naked young giant filled with the curiosity of the wild things.  Manu, the monkey, chattered and scolded as Tarzan passed, and though he was not afraid of the familiar figure of the ape-boy, he hugged closer to him the little brown body of his life's companion.  Tarzan laughed as he saw it; but the laugh was followed by a sudden clouding of his face and a deep sigh.  A little farther on, a gaily feathered bird strutted about before the admiring eyes of his somber-hued mate.  It seemed to Tarzan that everything in the jungle was combining to remind him that he had lost Teeka; yet every day of his life he had seen these same things and thought nothing of them.  When the blacks reached the trap, Taug set up a great commotion. Seizing the bars of his prison, he shook them frantically, and all the while he roared and growled terrifically.  The blacks were elated, for while they had not built their trap for this hairy tree man, they were delighted with their catch.  Tarzan pricked up his ears when he heard the voice of a great ape and, circling quickly until he was down wind from the trap, he sniffed at the air in search of the scent spoor of the prisoner.  Nor was it long before there came to those delicate nostrils the familiar odor that told Tarzan the identity of the captive as unerringly as though he had looked upon Taug with his eyes.  Yes, it was Taug, and he was alone.  Tarzan grinned as he approached to discover what the blacks would do to their prisoner.  Doubtless they would slay him at once.  Again Tarzan grinned.  Now he could have Teeka for his own, with none to dispute his right to her.  As he watched, he saw the black warriors strip the screen from about the cage, fasten ropes to it and drag it away along the trail in the direction of their village.  Tarzan watched until his rival passed out of sight, still beating upon the bars of his prison and growling out his anger and his threats. Then the ape-boy turned and swung rapidly off in search of the tribe, and Teeka.  Once, upon the journey, he surprised Sheeta and his family in a little overgrown clearing.  The great cat lay stretched upon the ground, while his mate, one paw across her lord's savage face, licked at the soft white fur at his throat.  Tarzan increased his speed then until he fairly flew through the forest, nor was it long before he came upon the tribe.  He saw them before they saw him, for of all the jungle creatures, none passed more quietly than Tarzan of the Apes.  He saw Kamma and her mate feeding side by side, their hairy bodies rubbing against each other.  And he saw Teeka feeding by herself.  Not for long would she feed thus in loneliness, thought Tarzan, as with a bound he landed amongst them.  There was a startled rush and a chorus of angry and frightened snarls, for Tarzan had surprised them; but there was more,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/106"],["title","Jungle Tales of Tarzan (#3)"],["body","o, than mere nervous shock to account for the bristling neck hair which remained standing long after the apes had discovered the identity of the newcomer.  Tarzan noticed this as he had noticed it many times in the past--that always his sudden coming among them left them nervous and unstrung for a considerable time, and that they one and all found it necessary to satisfy themselves that he was indeed Tarzan by smelling about him a half dozen or more times before they calmed down.  Pushing through them, he made his way toward Teeka; but as he approached her the ape drew away.  \"Teeka,\" he said, \"it is Tarzan.  You belong to Tarzan.  I have come for you.\"  The ape drew closer, looking him over carefully.  Finally she sniffed at him, as though to make assurance doubly sure.  \"Where is Taug?\" she asked.  \"The Gomangani have him,\" replied Tarzan.  \"They will kill him.\"  In the eyes of the she, Tarzan saw a wistful expression and a troubled look of sorrow as he told her of Taug's fate; but she came quite close and snuggled against him, and Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, put his arm about her.  As he did so he noticed, with a start, the strange incongruity of that smooth, brown arm against the black and hairy coat of his lady-love. He recalled the paw of Sheeta's mate across Sheeta's face--no incongruity there.  He thought of little Manu hugging his she, and how the one seemed to belong to the other.  Even the proud male bird, with his gay plumage, bore a close resemblance to his quieter spouse, while Numa, but for his shaggy mane, was almost a counterpart of Sabor, the lioness.  The males and the females differed, it was true; but not with such differences as existed between Tarzan and Teeka.  Tarzan was puzzled.  There was something wrong.  His arm dropped from the shoulder of Teeka.  Very slowly he drew away from her.  She looked at him with her head cocked upon one side.  Tarzan rose to his full height and beat upon his breast with his fists.  He raised his head toward the heavens and opened his mouth.  From the depths of his lungs rose the fierce, weird challenge of the victorious bull ape.  The tribe turned curiously to eye him.  He had killed nothing, nor was there any antagonist to be goaded to madness by the savage scream.  No, there was no excuse for it, and they turned back to their feeding, but with an eye upon the ape-man lest he be preparing to suddenly run amuck.  As they watched him they saw him swing into a near-by tree and disappear from sight.  Then they forgot him, even Teeka.  Mbonga's black warriors, sweating beneath their strenuous task, and resting often, made slow progress toward their village.  Always the savage beast in the primitive cage growled and roared when they moved him.  He beat upon the bars and slavered at the mouth.  His noise was hideous.  They had almost completed their journey and were making their final rest before forging ahead to gain the clearing in which lay their village.  A few more minutes would have taken them out of the forest, and then, doubtless, the thing would not have happened which did happen.  A silent figure moved through the trees above them.  Keen eyes inspected the cage and counted the number of warriors.  An alert and daring brain figured upon the chances of success when a certain plan should be put to the test.  Tarzan watched the blacks lolling in the shade.  They were exhausted. Already several of them slept.  He crept closer, pausing just above them.  Not a leaf rustled before his stealthy advance.  He waited in the infinite patience of the beast of prey.  Presently but two of the warriors remained awake, and one of these was dozing.  Tarzan of the Apes gathered himself, and as he did so the black who did not sleep arose and passed around to the rear of the cage.  The ape-boy followed just above his head.  Taug was eyeing the warrior and emitting low growls.  Tarzan feared that the anthropoid would awaken the sleepers.  In a whisper which was inaudible to the ears of the Negro, Tarzan whispered Taug's name, cautioning the ape to silence, and Taug's growling ceased.  The black approached the rear of the cage and examined the fastenings of the door, and as he stood there the beast above him launched itself from the tree full upon his back.  Steel fingers circled his throat, choking the cry which sprang to the lips of the terrified man.  Strong teeth fastened themselves in his shoulder, and powerful legs wound themselves about his torso.  The black in a frenzy of terror tried to dislodge the silent thing which clung to him.  He threw himself to the ground and rolled about; but still those mighty fingers closed more and more tightly their deadly grip.  The man's mouth gaped wide, his swollen tongue protruded, his eyes started from their sockets; but the relentless fingers only increased their pressure.  Taug was a silent witness of the struggle.  In his fierce little brain he doubtless wondered what purpose prompted Tarzan to attack the black. Taug had not forgotten his recent battle with the ape-boy, nor the cause of it.  Now he saw the form of the Gomangani suddenly go limp. There was a convulsive shiver and the man lay still.  Tarzan sprang from his prey and ran to the door of the cage.  With nimble fingers he worked rapidly at the thongs which held the door in place.  Taug could only watch--he could not help.  Presently Tarzan pushed the thing up a couple of feet and Taug crawled out.  The ape would have turned upon the sleeping blacks that he might wreak his pent vengeance; but Tarzan would not permit it.  Instead, the ape-boy dragged the body of the black within the cage and propped it against the side bars.  Then he lowered the door and made fast the thongs as they had been before.  A happy smile lighted his features as he worked, for one of his principal diversions was the baiting of the blacks of Mbonga's village. He could imagine their terror when they awoke and found the dead body of their comrade fast in the cage where they had left the great ape safely secured but a few minutes before.  Tarzan and Taug took to the trees together, the shaggy coat of the fierce ape brushing the sleek skin of the English lordling as they passed through the primeval jungle side by side.  \"Go back to Teeka,\" said Tarzan.  \"She is yours.  Tarzan does not want her.\"  \"Tarzan has found another she?\" asked Taug.  The ape-boy shrugged.  \"For the Gomangani there is another Gomangani,\" he said; \"for Numa, the lion, there is Sabor, the lioness; for Sheeta there is a she of his own kind; for Bara, the deer; for Manu, the monkey; for all the beasts and the birds of the jungle is there a mate.  Only for Tarzan of the Apes is there none.  Taug is an ape.  Teeka is an ape.  Go back to Teeka. Tarzan is a man.  He will go alone.\"                                 2                   The Capture of Tarzan  THE BLACK WARRIORS labored in the humid heat of the jungle's stifling shade.  With war spears they loosened the thick, black loam and the deep layers of rotting vegetation.  With heavy-nailed fingers they scooped away the disintegrated earth from the center of the age-old game trail.  Often they ceased their labors to squat, resting and gossiping, with much laughter, at the edge of the pit they were digging.  Against the boles of near-by trees leaned their long, oval shields of thick buffalo hide, and the spears of those who were doing the scooping.  Sweat glistened upon their smooth, ebon skins, beneath which rolled rounded muscles, supple in the perfection of nature's uncontaminated health.  A reed buck, stepping warily along the trail toward water, halted as a burst of laughter broke upon his startled ears.  For a moment he stood statuesque but for his sensitively dilating nostrils; then he wheeled and fled noiselessly from the terrifying presence of man.  A hundred yards away, deep in the tangle of impenetrable jungle, Numa, the lion, raised his massive head.  Numa had dined well until almost daybreak and it had required much noise to awaken him.  Now he lifted his muzzle and sniffed the air, caught the acrid scent spoor of the reed buck and the heavy scent of man.  But Numa was well filled.  With a low, disgusted grunt he rose and slunk away.  Brilliantly plumaged birds with raucous voices darted from tree to tree.  Little monkeys, chattering and scolding, swung through the swaying limbs above the black warriors.  Yet they were alone, for the teeming jungle with all its myriad life, like the swarming streets of a great metropolis, is one of the loneliest spots in God's great universe.  But were they alone?  Above them, lightly balanced upon a leafy tree limb, a gray-eyed youth watched with eager intentness their every move.  The fire of hate, restrained, smoldered beneath the lad's evident desire to know the purpose of the black men's labors.  Such a one as these it was who had slain his beloved Kala.  For them there could be naught but enmity, yet he liked well to watch them, avid as he was for greater knowledge of the ways of man.  He saw the pit grow in depth until a great hole yawned the width of the trail--a hole which was amply large enough to hold at one time all of the six excavators.  Tarzan could not guess the purpose of so great a labor.  And when they cut long stakes, sharpened at their upper ends, and set them at intervals upright in the bottom of the pit, his wonderment but increased, nor was it satisfied with the placing of the light cross-poles over the pit, or the careful arrangement of leaves and earth which completely hid from view the work the black men had performed.  When they were done they surveyed their handiwork with evident satisfaction, and Tarzan surveyed it, too.  Even to his practiced eye there remained scarce a vestige of evidence that the ancient game trail had been tampered with in any way.  So absorbed was the ape-man in speculation as to the purpose of the covered pit that he permitted the blacks to depart in the direction of their village"]]]
