One of the chaps had had a hamper sent him, and they smuggled the grub upstairs; and when they thought the coast was clear, they spread a sheet on the floor, and laid out the grub as if it were on a table-cloth.  The fellow who was standing treat was rather a swell in his way, and among other things he'd got his jam put out in a flat glass dish.  It was a fine feed, and they'd just begun, when they heard some one coming.  They'd only just got time to turn out the gas and jump into bed before the door opened, and in came one of the masters called Weston.  Well, of course, they all pretended to be asleep.  But the master had heard them scrambling about, and he walked in the dark up the aisle between the beds, saying, 'Who's been out of bed here?'  Then all of a sudden he stuck his foot into the glass jam-dish, and it slid along the floor, and down he came bang in the middle of all the spread.  John said that when the gas was lit they couldn't help laughing at old Weston: he'd rammed one elbow into a box of sardines, and there was a cheese-cake stuck in the middle of his back.  But oh, there was a row, I can tell you!\"  This yarn produced others, and the time passed pleasantly enough, until full justice had been done to the provisions, and hardly a crumb remained.  \"Phew! isn't it hot?\" said Diggory; \"let's open the window a bit. The moon must be full,\" he continued, as he raised the sash; \"it's nearly as light as day.  I can see all down the garden, and--hullo! quick, put the candle out!\"  Every one started to his feet, and the light was extinguished in a moment.  \"What is it--what's the matter?\" they all asked.  \"There's some one in the playground,\" whispered Diggory, as the others crowded round him. \"You see the door at the bottom of the garden; well, just when I spoke some one opened it and looked up at the house, and then shut it again. It must have been Blake, and he's seen our light.\"  \"It can't be Blake,\" answered Acton; \"he's gone to Fenley to play in a cricket match, and isn't coming back till to-morrow morning.  Old Welsby went to bed hours ago; and, besides, what should either of them want to be doing down there at this time of night?  You must have been dreaming, Diggy.\"  \"No, I wasn't; I saw it distinctly.  It must be old Blake.  He's come home sooner than he expected, and  I shouldn't wonder if he's going round by the road to take us by surprise.\"  \"He can't do that,\" answered Acton, \"because I've got the key of the shed, and the door-key's hung up inside.\"  Acton remained watching at the window while the others hastily cleared away all traces of the feast; the Triple Alliance retired to their own room, and nothing further was heard or seen of the mysterious visitor.  The next morning it was discovered that Mr. Blake had not returned from Fenley, and the five other members of the supper club were inclined to regard Diggory's vision of the midnight intruder as a sort of waking nightmare, resulting from an overdose of cake and pork-pie.  Two days later Cross came into the schoolroom in a great state of excitement.  \"Look here, you fellows,\" he exclaimed: \"some one keeps taking away my things out of the shed, and not putting them back.  Last week I missed a saw and two chisels, and now that brace and nearly all the bits are gone.  It's a jolly shame!\"  Carpentering was Cross's great hobby, and his collection of tools was an exceptionally good one, both as regards quantity and quality.  Every one, however, denied having touched the things mentioned.  A general search was made; but the missing articles could not be found, and at length the matter was reported to Mr. Welsby.  The latter was evidently greatly displeased on hearing the facts of the case.  As soon as dinner was over he called the school together, and after standing for some moments in silence, frowning at the book he carried in his hand, said briefly,--  \"With regard to these tools, there is a word which has never been used before in connection with any pupil at The Birches, and which I hope I may never have occasion to use again.  I can hardly think it possible that we have a _thief_ in the house.  I am rather inclined to imagine that some one has removed the things and hidden them away in joke; if so, let me tell him that the joke has been allowed to go too far, and that, unless they are returned at once, a shadow of doubt will be cast upon the honour and integrity of all here present.  It is impossible for such large articles as a saw and a brace to be mislaid or lost on such small premises as these, and I trust that before this evening you will report to me that the things have been found.  I have purposely allowed the key of the shed to remain in your own possession, feeling certain that your behaviour as regards each other's property would be in accordance with the treatment which one gentleman expects to receive from another.  You may go.\"  There was little in the nature of a scolding in this address, and yet something in it caused every one to leave the room in a state of great excitement.  Acton and Jack Vance especially fairly boiled with wrath.  \"What old Welsby says is quite right,\" remarked the latter; \"and until those things are found, we may all be looked upon as thieves.\"  The search, however, proved fruitless; and, what was worse, in turning over the contents of the shed, Acton discovered that a bull's-eye lantern belonging to himself had disappeared from the shelf on which it usually stood; while Mugford declared that a box of compasses, which he had brought down a few days before to draw a pattern on a piece of board, was also missing.  Directly after tea Acton button-holed Diggory, and taking him aside said, \"Look here, I'm in an awful rage about these thing's being prigged, because, of course, I've got the key of the shed; and didn't you hear what old Welsby said about it?  It looks uncommonly as if I were the thief.  You remember what you said the other night when we had that feed, about seeing that man?  D'you think there _is_ any one who comes here at night and steals things?\"  \"Well, I'm certain I saw some one in the playground when I told you. It was a man; but whether he comes regularly and goes into the shed I don't know, but I think we ought to be able to find out.\"  \"How?\"  \"Oh, some way or other; I'll tell you to-morrow.\"  That night, long after the rest of the house were asleep, the Triple Alliance lay awake engaged in earnest conversation; and in the morning, as the boys were assembling for breakfast, Diggory touched Acton on the shoulder and whispered,--  \"I say, we've thought of a plan to find out if any one goes into the shed at night.\"  \"Who's 'we'?\"  \"Why, the Triple Alliance; we thought it out between us.  Sneak out of the house directly after evening 'prep,' and meet me in the playground, and I'll show you what it is.\"  At the time appointed Acton ran down the path, and found Diggory waiting for him by the shed.  \"Look,\" said the latter, \"I've cut a little tiny slit with my knife in each door-post, about three feet from the ground, and I'm going to stretch this piece of black cotton between them.  No one will see it, and if they go through the door, the thread will simply draw out of one of the slits without their noticing it, and we shall see that it's been disturbed.  Jack Vance says that when he's been out shooting with his guv'nor he's seen the keeper put them across the paths in a wood to find out if poachers have been up them.  Now unlock the door, and let's go inside.\"  In front of the bench, where the ground had been much trodden, there was a great deal of loose dust.  Diggory went down on his hands and knees, and producing an old clothes-brush from his pocket, swept about a square yard of the ground until the dust lay in a perfectly smooth surface.  \"There,\" he said, rising to his feet again; \"we'll do this the last thing every night, and any morning if we find the cotton gone we must look here for footprints, and then we ought to be able to tell if it's a man or a boy.\"  \"Don't you think we ought to tell Blake about that man you saw?\" asked Acton, as they walked back to the schoolroom.  \"Well, I don't see how we can,\" answered Diggory.  \"The first thing he'll ask will be,' Who saw him?' I shall say, 'I did;' and then he'll want to know how I saw the playground door from my bedroom window, which looks out on the road; and then the fat'll be in the fire, and it'll all come out about that supper.\"  Regularly every evening, as soon as supper was over, the two boys stole down into the playground to set their trap; but when morning came there was no sign of the shed having been entered.  This went on for nearly a month, but still no result.  \"I don't think it's any good bothering about it any more,\" said Acton; \"the thief doesn't mean to come again.\"  \"Well, we'll set it to-night,\" answered Diggory, \"and that shall be the last time.\"  The following morning Acton was sauntering towards the playground, when Diggory came running up the path in a state of great excitement. \"I say, the cotton's gone!\"  Acton rushed down, unlocked the door of the shed, and went inside.  \"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, as Diggory followed; \"_it is_ some man.  Look at these footprints, and hobnailed boots into the bargain!\"    CHAPTER V.   CATCHING A TARTAR.  It was impossible for two boys to keep such an important discovery to themselves, and the shed was soon filled with an eager crowd, all anxious to view the mysterious footprints.  The Triple Alliance gained fresh renown as the originators of the scheme by which the disclosure had been made, and it was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10027"],["title","The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (#8)"],["body","decided that the matter should be reported to Mr. Blake.  The master cross-questioned Acton and Diggory, but seemed rather inclined to doubt their story.  \"I think,\" he said, \"you must be mistaken.  I expect the piece of cotton blew away, and the foot-marks must have been there before. I don't see what there is in the shed that should make it worth any one's while to break into it; besides, if the door was locked, the thief must have broken it open, and you'd have seen the marks.\"  Certainly nothing seemed to have been touched, and as no boy complained of any of his property having been stolen, the subject was allowed to drop, and the usual excitement connected with the end of term and the near approach of the holidays soon caused it to be driven from every one's thoughts and wellnigh forgotten.  With the commencement of the winter term a fresh matter filled the minds of the Triple Alliance, and gave them plenty of food for discussion and plan-making.  On returning to Chatford after the summer holidays, they discovered that all three were destined to leave at Christmas and proceed to Ronleigh College, a large school in the neighbourhood, to which a good number of Mr. Welsby's former pupils had been transferred after undergoing a preliminary course of education at The Birches. Letters from these departed heroes, containing disjointed descriptions of their new surroundings, awakened a feeling of interest in the doings of the Ronleigh College boys.  The records of their big scores at cricket, or their victories at football, which appeared in local papers, were always read with admiration; and the name of an old Birchite appearing in either of the teams was a thing of which every one felt justly proud.  \"I wish I was going too,\" said Acton, addressing the three friends; \"but my people are going to send me to a school in Germany.  My brother John is there; he's one of the big chaps, and is captain of the football team this season.  I'm going to get the _Denfordshire Chronicle_ every week, to see how they get on in the matches.\"  Early in October the goal-posts were put up in the field, and the Birchites commenced their football practice.  Mr. Blake was a leading member of the Chatford Town Club, and although six a side was comparatively a poor business, yet under his instruction they gained a good grounding in the rudiments of the \"soccer\" of the period.  The old system of dribbling and headlong rushes was being abandoned in favour of the passing game, and forwards were learning to keep their places, and to play as a whole instead of as individuals.  \"Come here, you fellows,\" said the master, walking into the playground one morning, with a piece of paper in his hand; \"I've got something to speak about.\"  The boys crowded round, wondering what was up.  \"I've got here a challenge from Horace House to play a match against them, either on our ground or on theirs.  I think it's a pity that you shouldn't have an opportunity of playing against strangers.  Of course they are bigger and heavier than we are, and we should probably get licked; but that isn't the question: any sportsman would sooner play a losing game than no game at all, and it'll be good practice.  We always used to have a match with them every term; but some little time ago there seemed to be a lack--well, I'll say of good sportsmen among them, and the meetings had to be abandoned.  I've talked the matter over with Mr. Welsby, and he seems willing to give the thing another trial.\"  An excited murmur ran through the crowd.  \"Wait a minute,\" interrupted the speaker, holding up his hand. \"Mr. Welsby has left it with me to make arrangements for the match, and I shall only do so on one condition.  I know that since the event happened to which I referred a moment ago a decidedly unfriendly spirit has existed between you and the boys at Mr. Phillips's.  Now an exhibition of this feeling on a football field would be a disgrace to the school.  You must play like gentlemen, and there must be no wrangling or disputing.  They are agreeable for a master to play on each side, so I shall act as captain.  Anything that has to be said must be left to me, and I shall see you get fair play.  Do you clearly understand?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Very well, then, I'll write and say we shall be pleased to play them here on Saturday week.\"  The prospect of mooting the Philistines in the open field filled the mind of every boy with one thought, and the whole establishment went football mad.  It  was played in the schoolroom and passages with empty ink-pots and balls of paper, in the bedrooms with slippers and sponges, and even in their dreams fellows kicked the bed-clothes off, and woke up with cries of \"Goal!\" on their lips.  Mr. Blake arranged the order of the team, and remarking that they would need a good defence, put himself and Shaw as full backs.  Acton took centre forward, with Jack Vance on his right, while Diggory was told off to keep goal.  At length the eventful morning arrived.  Class 2 came utterly to grief in their work; but Mr. Blake understood the cause, and set the same lessons over again for Monday.  It was the first real match most of the players had taken part in, and as they stood on the ground waiting for their opponents to arrive, every one was trembling with excitement.  The only exception was the goal-keeper, who leaned with his back against the wall, cracking nuts, and remarking that he \"wished they'd hurry up and not keep us waiting all day.\"  At length there was a sound of voices in the lane, and the next moment the enemy entered the field, headed by their under-master, Mr. Fox.  Young Noaks and Hogson pounced down at once upon the practice ball, and began kicking it about with great energy, shouting at the top of their voices, and evidently wishing to make an impression on the spectators before the game began.  \"I say,\" muttered Jacobs, \"they're awfully big.\"  \"Well, what does that matter?\" answered Diggory, cracking another nut and spitting out the shell.  \"They aren't going to eat us; and as for that chap Noaks, he's all noise--look how he muffed that kick.\"  Mr. Blake tossed up.  \"Now, you fellows,\" he said, coming up to his followers, \"we play towards the road; get to your places, and remember what I told you.\"  With young Noaks as centre forward, Hogson and Bernard on his right and left, and other big fellows to complete the line of hostile forwards, the home team seemed to stand no chance against their opponents. The visitors bowled them over like ninepins, and rushed through their first line of defence as though it never existed.  But Mr. Blake stood firm, and kept his ground like the English squares at Waterloo. Attack after attack swept down upon him only to break up like waves on a rock, and the ball came flying back with a shout of \"Now, then!  Get away, Birches!\"  Twice the Horace House wing men got round Shaw, and put in good shots; but Diggory saved them both, and was seen a moment later calmly rewarding himself with another nut.  Gradually, as the time slipped away and no score was made, the Birchites began to realize that being able to charge wasn't everything, and that their opponents could do more with their shoulders than with their feet, and soon lost control of the ball when bothered by the \"halves.\"  The play of the home eleven became bolder--the forwards managed a run or two; and though the Philistines had certainly the upper hand, yet it soon became obvious to them that it was no mere \"walk over,\" and that victory would have to be struggled for.  Noaks and the two inside forwards evidently did not relish this state of things; they had expected an easy win, and began to show their disappointment in the increased roughness of their play.  At length, just before half-time, a thing happened which very nearly caused Mr. Blake's followers to break their promise.  Cross was badly kicked while attempting to take the ball from Hogson, and had to retire from the game.  There were some black looks and a murmur of indignation among the home team, but Mr. Blake hushed it up in a moment.  \"I think,\" he said pleasantly, \"that the play is a trifle rough.  Our men,\" he added, laughing, \"are rather under size.\"  Noaks muttered something about not funking; but Mr. Fox said,--  \"Yes, just so.  Come, play the game, boys, and think less about charging.\"  The loss of their right half-back was distinctly felt by the Birchites during the commencement of the second half, and Diggory was called upon three times in quick succession to save his charge.  He acquitted himself like a brick, and the last time did a thing which afforded his side an immense amount of secret satisfaction.  He caught the ball in his hands, and at the same moment Noaks made a fierce rush, meaning to knock him through the goal.  Diggory, with an engaging smile, hopped on one side, and the Philistine flung himself against the post, and bumped his head with a violence which might have cracked any ordinary skull.  He came back scowling.  A moment later Jack Vance ran into him, and took the ball from between his feet.  Noaks charged viciously, and in a blind fit of temper deliberately raised his fist and struck the other player in the face.  \"_Stop!_\"  It was Mr. Blake's voice, and he came striding up the ground looking as black as thunder.  \"I protest against that deliberate piece of foul play.  I have played against all the chief clubs in the district, and in any of those matches, if such a thing had happened, this man would have been ordered off the ground.\"  There was a buzz of approval, in which several of the Philistines joined.  \"You are quite right, Mr. Blake,\" answered Mr. Fox.  \"I deeply regret that the game should have been spoiled by a member of my team.--Noaks,\" he added, turning to the culprit, \"put on your coat and go home; you have disgraced yourself and your Comrades.  I shall see that you send a written apology to the boy you struck.\"  \"Bravo!\" whispered Acton; \"old Fox is "]]]
